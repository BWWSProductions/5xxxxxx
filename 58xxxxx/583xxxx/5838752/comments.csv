,The_White_Rusky,2012-01-25T22:45Z,"i love how a documentary gets released mid 2009 and people don't realize that the latest data in it is from the previous year. so, how can you blame the democrats or obama, who got inaugurated in 2009, for something that happened while they weren't in office. are you people retarded? hello, any brain cells in that head of yours? who the fuck was the president when this data was being collected? Bush. Bush. President George W Bush. Do you get it? THE REPUBLICANS WERE IN OFFICE ILLEGALLY FOR 8 YEARS. Ok? You getting it? THEY ARE THE CAUSE OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE COLLAPSE! You fucking morons."
