Whoever remastered this doesn't seem to care that ""Jabberwocky"" has a nasty splice at about 0:50 during the work ""snatch"" -- maybe that's on the original master, but it's still really annoying. I love this album anyhow, but I always modify track 2 with music-editing software to make it sound natural."
