Release Notes:
Right, loaded video into dgindex made .d2v then made .avs script...added a brightness filter and sharpness script
onto it, then loaded into vdubmod, lowered the red a touch and added slight yellow, tweaked the saturation to
try and remove some of that orange...done some other slight touches also, overall it looks pretty good...for the 
audio we filtered lap's, created a LFE bass channel, center channel, and used russians 5.1 surround channel for the 
english surround channel...so it's nice 5.1 Audio...Enjoy the brilliant movie
