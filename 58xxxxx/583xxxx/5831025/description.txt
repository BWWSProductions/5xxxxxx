    Award-winning actor and Broadway star Alan Cumming made    
    his name playing roles in films such as Goldeneye and     
    X-Men. However his childhood was spent far from the      
    glamour of Manhattan where he now lives.                  
                                                               
    Growing up in the small town of Aberfeldy, Scotland,      
    Alan knew very little about his family history. With     
    his parents now both in their seventies, he feels it's    
    time to see if he can clear up one big question            
    lingering in the family's past.                           
                                                             
    The mystery relates to Alan's maternal grandfather,       
    Thomas Darling. A career soldier who spent most of his     
    life away from home serving in the army, he died, aged    
    just 35, in mysterious circumstances in Malaysia.        
                                                              
    Alan begins by visiting his mother Mary in Dundee, to      
    see what she can tell him about her father. Mary has      
    few memories of him, but she has some documents          
    relating to his military career and a medal he won in     
    the Second World War. She hopes these clues will get       
    Alan started in his search.                               
                                                             
    Alan travels to France where he finds out about his       
    grandfather's extraordinary bravery during the             
    evacuation of Dunkirk - he's thrilled by his              
    grandfather's medal-winning exploits.                    
                                                              
    Eventually Alan's journey takes him to Malaysia where      
    he discovers the shocking story of how his grandfather    
    really died and makes one last moving discovery about    
    the lasting impact his grandfather made on the village    
    where he was stationed in the months leading up to his     
    death.
