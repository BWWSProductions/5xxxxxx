,roxtar666,2011-03-01T09:29Z,"While the bitrate is good, the sample rate is off (48 kHz = DVD audio).

You can't burn this to CD.  (CD requires 44.1 kHz)

:( A recode would be bad.  Find another track.

This track is fine for your computer / ipod.  Don't expect to burn this to CD though."
,KevanGC,2011-03-05T10:35Z,I had no problems burning it to a CD. What u talkin bout?
,TomSnaps,2011-04-28T00:14Z,"@roxtar666 

Who uses CDs anymore anyway? You need to come out of the 90s son!"
