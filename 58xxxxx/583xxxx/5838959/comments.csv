[V],twentyforty,2010-09-19T06:58Z,"Sorry, no - for both."
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-19T08:54Z,"I found Painted Veil. There are many torrents available, many direct downloads, in sizes from 400 to 8000 MB. Therefore. Only one thing is possible: 272p for portables (don't worry, 90% of my encodes are in such format) - because no such version is available.

Three Monkeys stays out."

Hey friend, i requested these movies as i didnt find any BR rip or dvdrip of size around 400 mb with H264 compression. And i m sure these are really nice movies. But its still fine. Will try to find some other source or wait. Well, i have some other request:
Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993) 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108065/
25th Hour (2002)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307901/
If you like these you can skip my above two request.
Untill now I loved all Christian Bale s movies so now i will try this movie Equilibrium.
Thanks .

[V],twentyforty,2010-09-19T12:49Z,"@i_am_sid: I made decisions based on availability, not the quality (rating) of requested movies.
All movies suggested are good, 25th hour is one of my favored...
Also, I am governed by various ""technical"" factors too - as for instance. 25th hour is 135 minutes long - and by that factor alone can be 272p only. 
So, I would up The Painted Vail and 25th hour early as today, as 272p DVDrip both, Bobby Fischer when first slot open up, 'cause next week is crowded as hell.

Regarding your really limited download and upload capabilities - and in sense that requester HAVE obligation to seed non-stop for 48h - I think that you should stop doing the request - for a while... Somehow, it doesn't look fair toward others for all reasons out there.

I hope that you would understand what I meant by that."

Thanks mate for accepting my request. Sorry for over requesting. I actually do so as I dont find any one making requests. 
I like your uploads as I like mp4 more than mkv. If you rip a movie at 700mb and it is well seeded, I can download 1 and a half movie. So i would request a rip around 480p.
And yes it very bad and unfair  that i can not seed 24 hrs. But im seeding the requested movies plus 13 music albums (count was 24 three days ago and seeding since 7 months when i got internet connection) which has no or low seed. So 50kbps (max upload speed) is divided into these uploads. I'm trying.
If you find me over requesting, just add them to your list and give time like 15 days, a month or so. 
But please make them 480p or at least 360p. I would like really that a lot. But still its up to you. 
Ive never seen 272p , Ill try it.
Thanks again."
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-19T19:22Z,"@i_am_sid: I need 2.6 seconds to distribute 700 MB (one movie) and little above 1 second for 272p. Judging from that, anyone who have listened to my begging not to interfere just till initial-seeding is over have real life opportunity to have experience of fastest download ever.

Therefore, my job is pretty much over when I hit 32 or 52:1 ratio, I downloaded the source, encoded for several hours, uploaded file to server (I still need, let say, 3 hours for UL of 700 MB), but from there is pretty much in concern of downloaders. 

272p and 320p as my main formats are, understandably, for people who have not god-given surrounding for huge downloads which cost a fortune and ate 10% each of their monthly allowance.

My regulars are mainly very very cost-aware people, by necessity.
I exist because of them. And 272p (as 320p) suits their needs perfectly."
,i_am_sid,2010-09-23T19:38Z,Thanks. Good movie and great quality. +1
