False Flag Operations - final disc

Final disc of "7/7 The Big Picture" - new documentary investigating the July 7th, 2005, London Bombings. This part of the series asks the big question, were 9/11 and 7/7 false flag operations?

We may never know the full details, but in drawing from historical cases like Gulf of Tonkin, Pearl Harbor, Operation Gladio, and the information already presented in the series, it becomes clear that our western governments have a lot of explaining to do either way.
