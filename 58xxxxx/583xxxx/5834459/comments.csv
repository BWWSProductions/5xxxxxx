[V],globeplus,2010-09-17T05:16Z,"I forgot to say that the freeware FREEARC is needed to extract the arc files , the conception of this file is very easy , we are talking here about DEMOS for a couple of nice upcoming football games an this demos come out available almost at the same time and they are only demos , so in that perspective a nice worked file with both certainly ok of course the the games will be separated but in this case they are only demos , in the FIFA just donÂ´t have the english comments while the gameplay and in the PES a video with 3 or 4 minutes was obrigatory beeing displayed every single time that you finish a game and you canÂ´t skip at least looked like that , shore that if you donÂ´t mind to watch the video at the first time , at the secnd or third time you have to trust me that start to be borring that every single time that you finish a single exhibition game you really need to be watching a video for 3 or 4 minutes , so in this perspective i removed this video and was really the only thing on pes game .
Considerations maked , happy gaming everyone ."
,vikycool,2010-09-17T13:19Z,hey hw long it'll take to extract arc files. . i waited for 1 hr . . cant see anythin like extractin .:( . . pls help :)

,vikycool,2010-09-17T13:40Z,guys i hav downloaded many games from globe . . i'm sure it'll work . . but i cant understand dis arc file format . . :( 
,vikycool,2010-09-17T14:16Z,hey i jus extracted arc file of fifa demo and clicked globe converter . . but i cudnt find d setup.exe file . . can u help me wer it'll be ???
,vikycool,2010-09-17T14:57Z,hey i jus finished installin fifa 11. . wen i click fifa.exe its showin e0001 error . . dunno wt 2 do ?? help me globe :)
[V],globeplus,2010-09-17T15:33Z,"Use this link to extract the arc files : http://www.free
arc.org/Download.aspx
or get my GLOBARC extractor autorun from my blog : http://globe1.word
press.com/
and when making the extractions it is recommended to restart the computer before to donÂ´t get interferences from background applications consuming necessary ram to the extraction , it is needed close 1 gb ram to do the extraction , so restart the computer and to the extractions preferencially without doing nothing else , my file is very pratical and the user really get the gameplay in maximum quality or the normal stuff without nothing beeing borring , if for FIFA the comments can be nice they start to be borring after a while listening the same things more or less and can make the player be a little bit less concentrated in the gameplay and normally the game have an option to deabilitate them , so really no big deal that and it is nothing that interfere with the gameplay , on PES it was a nice video showing the general new things , things that the player get the touch after playing a few games but with a detail : this video takes 3 or 4 minutes and it is obrigatory to watch with no key escaping the showing of the video every single time the user finish an exhibition match , so it was like this you finish the game then wait 3 or 4 minutes to the video pass then you can play other game and this every single time you finish to play a game , like this it is really just play and after you finish a game you get on the demo menu to do wherever you want including play another game , the video is really just showing the new general features for this 2011 version but after playing a few games you get the touch , in the end no big deal because the remove of this video and evrything else it is just complete total normality on the demo itself , ok i hope this comment help the generality of the users and happy gaming !!!"
,vikycool,2010-09-17T15:33Z,hey guys in fifa 11 it'll show dat e0001 error if u don hav a graphic card . .

[V],globeplus,2010-09-17T15:35Z,This comment just to say that the links above in the before comment to get the freearc or the globarc need to be copied in sucession to the address bar then click ok and get on the links destination . 
[V],globeplus,2010-09-17T15:37Z,To vickycool : you didn´t extracted the arc file correctly probably just follow my recomendations in the before comments to get yor demos correctly and don´t forget to read the instructions.txt with the file to help you getting the demos with normality .

[V],globeplus,2010-09-17T16:23Z,"To vikycool : restart the computer and do only that and check what is the executables files that you have running on the computer during the start of the operative system maybe you have programs limitating your run or any kind of virus not meaning with this that is like this , so to your start menu of the computer ans call the dos command probably on the acessories then write at the command prompt msconfig.exe and the program that shows your inicial running files will appear then go to the Startup tab and check what is the programs starting with the computer and desactivate the ones that you think not really essencial then on the way out of making your choices choose to the computer reiniciate and when you get again on the desktop do only the extraction ."
[V],globeplus,2010-09-17T17:22Z,"To vikycool : don´t use the universal extractor to extract arc files use the freeware FREEARC or my GLOBARC , the links are in the before comments ."
,jaiit_84,2010-09-18T04:57Z,your extraction of both the demos pes2011 and fifa2011 works great. i followed  your instructions and it works very well. waiting for your upcoming pc games rip/extraction. please rip all cricket games. please
,argoni,2010-09-18T08:03Z,"Hi.
plz excuse me for my question and sorry for my bad English!
does this file work correctly?
are you sure?
because i have downloaded a file with size:460mb
and it was wrong.
i have IzArc for extract ac files?
is it good?"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-18T08:56Z,"To jaiit_84 : sorry but cricket games try to find nice torrent files for that ones , i work many nice new pc games but i canÂ´t work all of them , thank you for understanding this .
To argoni : what you write in your comment is a kind of madness thing because the fiule have 705 mb and really is impossible have only that size , check your computer and your torrent file and the file folder because that is simply madness .
I still trying to understans why users with mad parameters in things relationated to my files insist in write comments but this a kind of things that i donÂ´t understand but thinking a little bit more and we can ask : it is possible a thing that doesnÂ´t make sense at all beeing happen ? is this for real  ? and what about the all other users that look happy having the file ? can make any sense think that is something wrong with the file beside the complete nonsense ? 
What i mean is that refections like this can make sense in a total foulish situation that donÂ´t make sense and when this strange things happen it is better look whatÂ´s going on with the computer or the program files before making some bizarre suggestions , i donÂ´t really mind beeing writing this comment but i take thye oportunity just to call some common sense in case of strange situations downloading files . Thank you and i hope you get the file correct soon as possible , one of this days i can really think in stop uploading files but still a nice percentage of nice users of the files that can appreciate a nice work ."
,NYDant,2010-09-18T11:12Z,"@globeplus
you are great mate...
i downloaded almost all your rips...
they work perfect just had problems with metro 2033
i downloaded the demos before you uploaded your work here
anyways thanks and i hope you 
you rip the final release of fifa 11 and other great upcoming games asap....
thanks btw"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-18T12:00Z,"Thanks NYDant , it is for users like you that i keep more as possible my competent work with a good analysis of the possible files , sometimes just between you and me i have the feeling that no matter what i do that is only someone out there trying to find ways to depreciate my work no matter if it is good or not , the true is that is always complicate looking like a normal uploader and that maybe because i do pratical files not the more current full files stuff but still a nice percentage of possible users in the torrents that for many reasons can appreciate nice competent work in this type of files , in the end i try to be just another valid option to the users that can always get borred with the upload anyway but still doing his work passing the adversities no matter what . Thank you for your comment and i will try keep my nice competent work when i get the possibility , iÂ´d like to this type of work beeing watched in the other way generality speaking but that can be really tough ..."

[V],globeplus,2010-09-19T00:52Z,"To argoni : i hope you donÂ´t think that i didnÂ´t wanted to give you the file but generally speaking the downloadings speeds to get the file are positive and we are talking here in 705 mb on 2 complete demos with only a secondary things not essencial missing , in total downloading from file planet taking the necessary time , this 2 demos have more than 2.3 gb , so getting 705 mb for both demos with them fully playable certainly a very nice work and for example the FIFA have installation and the PES just 1 video was removed because it is only a demo and the user when finish a game must watch a 3 or 4 minutes video until get back to the main menu and that was the only thing removed , so i didnÂ´t made it the link because 705 mb for both in acceptable nice torrent file certainly more fast and less size than 1and something like it is for FIFA demo or more than 1.3 gb like it is for PES demo , so thanks for understanding but this small size getting both canÂ´t be that bad . Thank you for understanding ."
,dbzgt4,2010-09-21T12:10Z,"globe please help me this is about mafia 2 non steam torrent i posted it here because its your newest so the prob is when i click on mafia2,exe nothing happens this may be because of reg entries as i have not installed the game on desktop help me fast please"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-21T21:44Z,"To dbzgt4 : no , i donÂ´t think that the problem is the worked executable but you probably have some problem on the game folder , what you ned to do is to usae the instructions.txt that comes with the file and check if all the necessary steps to have the game folder correct was done including the move  of the music and the video folders to the sds folder after the conversion work . The worked executable work fine and you can always use the skidrow crack too if you want is up to you but of course you need the game folder absolutly correct to run the game properly ."
