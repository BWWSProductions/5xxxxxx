A surprise hit comedy, American Pie follows four high school friends -- Jim (Jason Biggs), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Oz (Chris Klein) -- through their sexually frustrated senior year as they strive for the most eagerly anticipated rite of adulthood: losing one's virginity. This sweet treat offers an affectionate look at a time in our lives when we try to hold onto our dignity -- and end up failing miserably.
