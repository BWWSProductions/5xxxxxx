Cannonball Adderley Sextet - Nippon Soul 
Year Of Release: 1963
Label: Riverside
Quality: CBR 320 kbps 

Recorded live in Tokyo on July 14th and 15th, 1963, Nippon Soul is not the Asian-jazz fusion suggested by the title (check out Cal Tjaderâ€™s Several Shades of Jade and Breeze From the East for that), but a solid live set that showcases one of Cannonball Adderleyâ€™s finest groups, featuring himself, brother Nat Adderley on cornet, bassist Sam Jones, drummer Louis Hayes, and most notably pianist Joe Zawinul and reedsman Yusef Lateef. Both near the beginnings of their careers, Zawinul and Lateef nonetheless dominate this set; two of the original tracks are by Lateef, including the centerpiece â€œBrother John,â€ for John Coltrane and featuring an astonishing extended Lateef solo on oboe, an instrument not normally associated with jazz, but which takes on an almost Middle Eastern fluidity and grace in its approximation of Coltraneâ€™s â€œsheets of soundâ€ technique. Zawinul arranged the standards for the group, reinterpreting Cole Porterâ€™s warm â€œEasy to Loveâ€ as a fleet bebop vehicle for a wicked Adderley solo and working the â€œCome Sundayâ€ section of Duke Ellingtonâ€™s â€œBlack, Brown and Beigeâ€ into a full gospel-style call and response between himself and Jones. Often overlooked, this is one of Adderleyâ€™s finest albums. The CD reissue includes an extra track, an extended take on â€œWork Song.â€ ~ Stewart Mason, All Music Guide
