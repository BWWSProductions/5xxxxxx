,Cvballa3g0,2010-10-09T03:28Z,@hortonofdoom: It's probably because the resolution is 1280x720(720p). Just a wild guess.

Hi hortonofdoom  and Cvballa3g0;
Thanks for your input.
I cannot explain why it is as it is. My program could convert DVD to AVI in various formats. I dont know if the format 1280x720 is affecting the size of the file.
""Trusted"" means (to me) that my torents are no fakes.
