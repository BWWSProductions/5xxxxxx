The latest Live from Darylâ€™s House spotlights the powerhouse vocals of Jones, who has made a name for herself with four independently released albums, including the latest, I Learned the Hard Way, recorded at their House of Soul Studios, which debuted at #15 on the Billboard charts when it was released earlier this year on their own Daptone label. The Boston Globe raved that Jones â€œsings of hard times, infidelity, and other life lessons with total authority.â€ Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kingsâ€™ cover of Woody Guthrieâ€™s â€œThis Land Is Your Landâ€ was featured in the opening credits of last yearâ€™s Oscar-nominated movie Up in the Air, and included on the soundtrack album.
