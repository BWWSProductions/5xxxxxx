,kkronik,2010-09-25T07:22Z,"Hey excellent torrent, HOTD 1 works, had a small graphical issue but nonetheless awesome, HOTD 2 works fine , i am still having trouble downloading HOTD3 i had to go download 7file and I am still stuck on the screen when it comes to the setup.exe. If anyone out there has any advice I would appreciate it."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-09-25T08:23Z,"@kkronik i can probably even fix the graphical issues you are having too. especially if it's cuz you're on win 7 or win vista. anyhow, after you extract hod3, run the setup, let it install. then take the crack and place it in the installation directory replacing the original .exe file. simple as that."
,drbuster,2010-09-25T18:34Z,thanks fot this
,kkronik,2010-09-28T21:30Z,"ok thank you, I wasnt fully extracting it, this is my first time with torrents, I just would like clearing up on the last part, where exactly shoud the crack folder be, it is already in my installation folder."
,kkronik,2010-09-28T21:41Z,"okay, never mind lol i just got it.. but is there a way to make HOTD3 run as fast as the others."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-10-06T23:46Z,"@kkronik you might need a better graphics card. check www.canirunit.com see if the game is on there and if it is, that site will tell you if your pc can handle the game"

,Ghostryx,2011-08-04T14:59Z,"!::Graphical Issues Solved::!
For the people that have some graphical issues, you just install the game properly and then go to the launcher and right click, properties, compatibility, and just ""check"" the visual definitions boxes. For a friend of mine it solved the Problem :D He was running win7.
And seeding now, tnks for the upload!"
,ipodmonesta,2011-10-14T23:43Z,hate it how people put more than one game in one zip file. now its even worse! its an exe file! DAMN SHIT I ONLY WANT HOTD 1!
,shinobiung,2012-01-29T12:09Z,"graphical issues with HOD3 occur due to the lack of system detection which is typical of this type of game installation ie hacked and zipped, some settings are stuck on the hackers preferences, hence when you use them they dont quite work as your system is different. Its just laziness on part of the hacker. Sometimes you can edit the .ini files or use .dll from your other games. But this version of HOD3 will have very limited graphics. ie below 1080 x 782"
,0rochimaru,2012-05-09T07:47Z,Works fine in Windows 7 64-bit.  Thanks.
,ChiggerLemon,2012-05-27T19:31Z,Why is HOD2 labled as a trojan?
