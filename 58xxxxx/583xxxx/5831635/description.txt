Everlife is a Christian pop rock band made of three sisters, Amber, Sarah, and Julia Ross.

Everlife originated in Indiana, Pennsylvania. The band originated in the winter of 1997 with Sarah on the drums, Amber on the guitar, and Julia on keyboard. Their first #1 radio hit, "Lead the Way", first found prominent rotation on LA's Radio Disney.

Everlife eventually relocated to Hollywood, CA with their parents where they signed a record deal with SHELTERecords, but were quickly picked up by Hollywood Records following the release of their first album.

Everlife is currently managed by Tattered Suit Entertainment.

After signing with Disney, they contributed singles to several Disney soundtracks. They eventually dropped Walt Disney Records in 2007, but continue a strong relationship with Disney. They opened for The Cheetah Girls on their last few days of touring in 2006/2007, and Miley Cyrus on the last six dates of her Best of Both Worlds Tour.
