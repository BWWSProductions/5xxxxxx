,ddawg,2010-09-17T05:54Z,"""Somebody's Baby"" is on the Best of Jackson Browne (Compliation)"
,ddawg,2010-09-17T06:21Z,"I'm don't participate on other torrent sites so feel free to upload this torrent elsewhere.  FYI: Each individual CD is upload ready containing .cue, audiochecker.log, sfv (simple file verification) and nfo's (text file containg  pertitent CD info) and of course all cover-art"
,ddawg,2010-09-17T14:43Z,"hupsis you're either mistaken or too stupid to be online (I suspect the later).  The only thing here are .flac, text, and jpg and oh one .mpg"
[T],rjordan21,2010-09-17T20:13Z,ddawg this looks incredible..... any idea where the worm comment is coming from though?  I recently caught a virus that fried my motherboard while I was trying to upload my first torrent.  It was a very expensive problem....
[T],rjordan21,2010-09-17T20:36Z,"ddawg,  Awesome torrent but any idea where the worm comment comes from?  I only ask because I recently had a very expensive experience uploading my first torrent and getting a virus that fried my motherboard.  "
[T],rjordan21,2010-09-18T14:15Z,I downloaded this wonderful torrent without any incident.  Thank you so much ddawg for this great music.
,komputertogo,2010-09-22T21:09Z,"Normally when a posted responds to a worm/trogen/virus like this one did, IT MEANS THE WORM IS REAL.
He gets pissed off that he got caught so fast.
If no worm he would be more civil. 
I will download it and report back.
You can check the file online"

,ddawg,2010-09-26T18:43Z,"komputertogo what I get pissed off with his newbies running their mouths.  I spent more than a few $$ buying CD's, Ripping them, doing the reasearch.  The twit that ran his mouth should have first verified his claims, should have reported what worm, specified which if any file was suspect... he should have also looked at what files the torrent contained.  They should have also looked at the number of torrents i've uploaded as well as the fact that I'm a trusted uploader."
,ddawg,2010-09-26T18:54Z,"And not to mention the fact that what person trying to do harm includes audiochecker files.

Also interesting is the fact that both you and the twit have uploaded zero torrents... which makes me wonder why someone whould complain about a torrent no one else has but TPB"
,artworks3d,2011-02-04T04:43Z,"Thanks for the awesome JB torrent!! BTW, where's the [1967] First Album (unreleased)? Everything else is there, but not that one... Anyway, thanks again!
KL"
,Roycer,2011-10-06T17:17Z,What a great collection.  Thanks.
,yawg,2012-03-07T02:56Z,I miss half of the audio files and most of the covers folders are empty. What is this?? I use a Mac running OSX Tiger.
,yawg,2012-03-09T21:17Z,"This torrent has been corrupted - many internal errors when converting the FLAC files and when playing them the player stops and pieces of some tracks are missing. I downloaded this torrent 3 times, every time with the same results. A pity -it's mostly great music."
