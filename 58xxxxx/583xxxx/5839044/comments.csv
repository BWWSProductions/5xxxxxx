,asighkick,2010-09-19T04:03Z,"Thanks verovenlo.... my apologies for neglecting to thank you for the current series too :(

Still getting Series One of X Factor although some seem to be struggling including:

The.X.Factor.s01.e06.Boot.Camp.VeroVenlo
The.X.Factor.s01.e09.Top.9.Performances.VeroVenlo
The.X.Factor.s01.e10.Top.8.Performances.VeroVenlo
The.X.Factor.s01.e13.Top.5.Performances.VeroVenlo
The.X.Factor.s01.e14.Top.4.Performances,VeroVenlo
The.X.Factor.s01.e16.Top.2.Performances.VeroVenlo
The.X.Factor.s01.e16.Final

These show no seeds at the moment, so not sure what is going on.  Also we have the missing S01E13 Top 5 Results.

Thanx from New Zealand"
,Goffus,2010-09-19T04:10Z,you re awesome
[V],verovenlo,2010-09-19T04:17Z,i reseeded them all but the morons aint going to seed back who finished those torrents
,midge218,2010-09-19T04:49Z,thanks mate
,asighkick,2010-09-19T07:20Z,"My message below may be confusing, I meant that we still need a brand new upload of S01E13 Results.

Perhaps the problem is that you seeded too many at once and we were unable to get them with our slow connections.

Please consider reseeding them again BUT ONLY ONE EVERY TWO DAYS starting with E06.

p.s. my neighbour is Sighco (not to be confused with me ;-)

Still seeding every episode of S01 that we have.

Tnx"

Much appreciated bro!"
,topec,2010-09-19T21:26Z,Thanks.
[V],verovenlo,2010-09-19T23:23Z,u can be a seeder by not stopping the torrents after u finished downloading them keep them running as long as u can to keep the torrents alive thank u
,MartZuid,2010-09-20T09:22Z,"Great, but I also would like to see the followup of this doublebill which has been broadcasted last night."
