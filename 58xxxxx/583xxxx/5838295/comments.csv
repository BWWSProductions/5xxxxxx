,DJkid90,2010-09-18T14:28Z,"Another good news - It is the fastest dl. speed i ever had :-)

One more request - "" The Universe - Series ""

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1051155/

It's very interesting no uploader has uploaded in a small size.

It will justify your work. And most important it will spread knowledge ;-)

Thank you !!!"

,kanha,2010-09-18T17:21Z,"@20-40
can u plz do ""Generation Kill (2008)"" mini tv series
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995832/
i really need that....plz reply...."
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-18T18:43Z,"@kanha: I cannot. BluRay is 29.8 GB, H264 encoding would take 24 h at least, and then upload another 14 hours - and during that time I must stop all other jobs. I cannot do that. Sorry. Net is full of DVDrips in XviD format, by the way."
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-18T18:52Z,"@DJkid90: ""Universe"" repeats the same stuff over and over again - from first three seasons.

Morgan Freeman have done much better job with Through.the.Wormhole and I have done all 8 episodes and as a reply to your e-mail message I could send you MU links for that."
