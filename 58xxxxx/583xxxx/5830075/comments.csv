[V],jainmehul,2010-09-16T13:20Z,Buddy Dont Take Me Wrong.... I Do like ur uploads but major of them are transcodes.. (thats the thing i dont like)...

[V],jainmehul,2010-09-17T06:54Z,I feel to laugh on ur replies.....
,offtheric,2010-09-18T10:36Z,"Hey NOS1977, I appreciate your uploads @320kbps, just wondering why not in stereo??? I am not familiar with what formats to use, just know that I get the clearest sound from uploads done in stereo. Joint or dual sound flat & lifeless...but I do appreciate ALL your efforts, thanx, OffTheRic"
[V],jainmehul,2010-09-19T06:58Z,"Dont take me wrong buddy... but kinda hate ur uploadzz... earlier when i didn't had spectro.i used to think to you were god,but when i got spectro i reversed the statement.... if also 50% of a torrent which says 320 kb are legit 320kb(20.3 or 20.5 cutoff),then also it can be swallowed,but from 21 songz... just 3 songz legit...... although you dont stop buddy.. alot of people depend on you.... :)"
