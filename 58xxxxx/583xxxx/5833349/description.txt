"Winner Revealed"

After enduring a series of intense pressure tests 
and grueling challenges, the moment has finally 
come for one MASTERCHEF contestant to claim the 
title of America's Best Home Cook. In the season 
finale, judges Gordon Ramsay, Joe Bastianich and 
Graham Elliot determine which amateur cook truly 
has the potential to transform their culinary 
dreams into reality. The contestants who have 
made it this far in the competition have earned 
the judges' respect, but only one will walk away 
with $250,000 and a cookbook-publishing deal and 
embark on a life-changing journey. Find out which 
contestant will be named America's first-ever 
MASTERCHEF.

Enjoy :)
