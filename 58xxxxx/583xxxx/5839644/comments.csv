I wonder how these commenters can claim Journal from Plague Lovers was a departure from form, they obviously have no idea what the Manic Street Preachers were and could never have considered a funeral parade for all the ignorant with The Holy Bible providing the soundtrack."
,r6489c,2010-09-25T12:08Z,^Completely agree. The Holy Bible is the definative Manics album for me. I'll have a listen to this but if it'n not an improvement on SATT then I doubt I'll buy it.
