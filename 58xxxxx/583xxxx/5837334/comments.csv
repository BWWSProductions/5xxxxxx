,rudyman,2010-09-20T19:35Z,"I did everything as instructed, but when i mount the cd and try to play, it gives me : please insert the correct tony hawk`s underground disc 1, select ok and restart application
Ideas? :("
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-09-25T08:20Z,"@kisu14 you create folder 1 yourself. read the instructions very very carefully.

@rudyman try mounting with daemontools or ultraiso. those are the only 2 mounting programs i've ever cared to use, i know it works on daemontools pro. so torrent that and try. if not then maybe you messed up somewhere along the way. try reinstalling and do it very carefully. or use my contact info."

,JazzAlchemist,2011-01-18T14:14Z,"Hey, I can't get this to work, Im not really sure I understand your instructions, and i dont know if im using Ultraiso right. But this is where i got to. I was up to the run this before installing part, i clicked install, and then nothing happened, but a key was generated, but i was never asked for a key. can anyone help? i think i just need to start over. the instructions were a bit vague with a few things. "

,Dsigned,2011-02-14T00:21Z,"I did everything exactly how its instructed here and try to mount it in many programs (daemon, virtual CloneDrive, UltraIso,...) but still giving me: please insert the correct tony hawk`s underground disc 1, select ok and restart application.
Someone knows what to do? Thx"
,phoenix61,2011-03-12T10:13Z,I'm using windows 7 64-bit - the problem i have is that none of the keys respond - not even in the menu - so I can't go anywhere with it.. Such a bummer :(
,Hamashedo,2011-05-29T07:01Z,"I dont see any comments sayin this works, and sad to admit that I didnt read them before I grabbed this. I'm fairly sure what you've done here is upload a rip of THUG that essentially has no crack. So, you CAN play this game...if you have an actual disc for the game.  You can try all the mounting/burning programs you want, but in honesty, there doesnt seem to be anyway to get this to work. You have disk 1, yes, but even if you burn it and use that to play, it won't let you.  That is, I could be wrong. FuCtUpPuNk could prove me wrong by coming up with an answer thats not ""use a different program"". I've had the disk mounted. I've burned it and tried that. I've even downloaded a whole other copy of Disk 1and mounted it. There is no crack. You need the disk."
,OggyBones666,2011-08-23T01:27Z,FINALLY!!! JESUS H. CHRIST! FINALLY SOMEONE GIVES DIRECTIONS ON HOW TO INSTALL!
,OggyBones666,2011-08-23T16:08Z,What the fuck dude? all there is in the folder after downloading is a couple notepad documents and contact info? What the hell is this supposed to be? some kind of joke?
,Aronsk8,2011-10-11T20:03Z,"Hey, I have a Mac, but everything works fine because I use Crossover and 7z, but when i clicked on the ""run this before installing"" it didn't work, because crossover couldn't extract it, so what should I do, but good torrent anyway PLEASE HELP!"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-11-04T07:36Z,@anyone having problems READ THE README. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY AS I HAVE THEM!!!!! should be no problem. i use my own torrent for this on all 3 of my cumputers...2xp 32 bit and 1 7 64 bit....works just fine. to play the game u must keep the disc mounted. idk what you're doing wrong but it is something.....READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND DO NOT SKIP STEPS
,xUBERJEWx,2012-01-05T11:32Z,"Thanks man.  When I installed everything was working but my screen was black.  Turns out it doesn't like dual monitors.

100% prefect.  Gonna try put everything into an iso so there will only be one file ever needed."
,pvtdarkness,2012-01-22T13:37Z,"dude i cant find the motherfucking ""thugcd1"" file to mount it!!! SOMEONE HELP ME PLS! ur instructions arent clear enough.."
,pvtdarkness,2012-01-22T14:10Z,UR INSTRUCTIONS SUCK DUDE.......
,boozemonster616,2012-03-15T20:50Z,"For those still struggling, here is what I did.

1. Extract the rar file.
2. Mount ""thug cd1"" with daemon tools lite (its free)
3. Go to ""My Computer"" and open the ""THUG_1"" cd (just double click as you would a normal folder)
4. Copy and paste everything on the cd to a new file named ""THUG""
5. Copy contents of the folder ""cd2-3"" into the newly created ""Thug"" folder overwriting as you go.
6. Open the ""run this before installing"" file.
7. Install.
8. When asked for a serial/cd key. open the keygen and generate one.
9. Mount the ""thug cd1"" image (if not still mounted) and play."
,PirateEm,2012-05-12T19:42Z,"Good torrent. Thanks Fuctuppunk.

My only complaint is without a crack you have to mount the .iso in order to play. Not a big deal though.

Oh and the instructions weren't clear at all.

For anyone else, use boozemonster616's instructions.
And thanks booze for posting them. They worked perfectly."
