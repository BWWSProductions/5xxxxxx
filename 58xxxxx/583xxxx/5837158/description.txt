
In a brand new series of Grand Designs, Kevin McCloud is once again amazed by the ingenuity and determination of the families who set out to build their dream homes. And, with the recession taking its toll on their budgets, these Grand Designers must come up with bolder ideas than ever before. This series' innovative builds include an enormous underground urban pad; an attempt to build and occupy a factory-made kit house in just four weeks; and a conversion of two barns that takes a radical new direction when one is found to be a national treasure. In the first episode, architectural designer Lincoln Miles and his wife, artist Lisa Traxler, want to build own their own home on the Isle of Wight. But good land is hard to find, so they turn to an increasingly popular solution: bungalow gobbling - buying a property on a prime piece of land and transforming it.
