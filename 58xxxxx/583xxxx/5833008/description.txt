"Something 'Bout Love" is the official first single by singer-songwriter David Archuleta from his second upcoming pop album The Other Side of Down projected to be released on October 5, 2010.

The music video for the song premiered on August 5 on VEVO. It was directed by Declan Whitebloom, who directed Crush back in 2008. The video was released on iTunes on August 10.

The video starts with Archuleta walking down a sidewalk while singing the intro. There was also a scene featuring David's brother playing basketball with his friends and also another showing a boyfriend helping his girlfriend skateboard. The video mainly focuses on Archuleta in a party singing somewhere in a crowd and also singing in an alley. Halfway through the video, a nerdy man is seen alone with no friends while the crowd is having all the fun. Then not long later a girl walks over to him and they make conversation. Also, Archuleta receives a text a little after that scene. Towards the end, Archuleta is seen taking shots of the crowd having fun partying with a Sony Cybershot camera.
