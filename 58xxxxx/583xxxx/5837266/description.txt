    After a chemical leak at the Hope Centre in Papua New Guinea (an         
    organisation devoted to feeding underdeveloped countries) turns its      
    staff into flesh-eating zombies, a four-man commando squad led by        
    Mike London are sent to investigate. They run into a TV news crew led    
    by celebrity reporter Lea, who are after the same story, but when        
    they discover that the entire country has been overrun by zombies,       
    what are the chances of them getting the message across? Unlike most     
    zombie films, this actually tries to make a serious point - that if      
    we don't feed the Third World, they'll come and feed on us!
