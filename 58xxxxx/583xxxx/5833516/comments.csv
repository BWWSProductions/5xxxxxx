Possibly the worst movie ever made ..., "
,APDJOKER,2010-10-21T08:03Z,"""TIT-ANTICS 2"" New name for this movie

This is a low budget travesty EPIC FAILURE of a movie.  Special effects are so 1980's blue screen. Now a days they use a green screen for better special effects.                                                                                             "
