Folks with regular Windows Media Player are bound to need to pay a visit at:
http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html
For a codec. From there, you go here for the codec pack that includes .mkv:
http://www.cccp-project.net/

The player you may choose to install from the pack seems nice enough, so you can consider it.

As for the movie itself, well, although it's not quite what I'd like to watch in a Stargate movie which should be about space and exploration foremost, but at least the script isn't as flimsy as the first movie's and it also seems to have had a bigger budget as it has its impressive moments.
Overall, worth downloading and watching once or thrice."
