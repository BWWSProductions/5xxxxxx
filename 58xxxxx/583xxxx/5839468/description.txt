Biography

Rock singer Sammy Hagar is most famous for being the Van Halen vocalist from 1985 until 1996, after original frontman David Lee Roth quit the band. Their sound changed much over the Hagar years, from Roth's hard-rocking ways to a more polished, commercial style dubbed "Van Hagar". While the band continued to sell millions of records and go on sell-out tours, many fans of the Roth-era albums refused to accept Hagar as an adequate replacement, and disliked their new style. In 1996, Hagar left the band too, again because of disagreements with Eddie van Halen.
