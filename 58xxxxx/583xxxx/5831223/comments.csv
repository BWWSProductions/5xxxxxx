,Saki33,2010-12-09T16:56Z,"Thanks for the upload. Downloads quickly.

I have watched up to s05e04 without a problem. That one will play on computer, but pixelates and jumpy vid on Nbox. Samsung tv refuses to play it at all. I have tried downloading that episode from other sources and every one of them is defective. "
,Saki33,2010-12-10T00:43Z,"In season 7, two episode 3 and no episode 5? Odd. Is one of them misidentified?"
,Saki33,2010-12-10T16:23Z,"Yes, mislabeled. Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 7/Curb.Your.Enthusiasm.S07E03 is really episode 5, Denise Handicapped."
,Fat_Jesus,2010-12-31T19:34Z,"Yeah Denise Handicapped I had to track down somewhere else. But it's there.

And no big deal, love the show, and thought I'd upload the complete  for everyone. 

Uploading Ghost Adventures season 4 when the last three (or is it four) episodes air in Jan."
,doser69,2011-07-23T05:17Z,"Season 4 are not DVDRips

Season 7 Episode 5 is called ""S07E03."" for some reason

But thanks for Season 1,2,3,5,6 which are DVDRips

Shame they aren't in RARs and you forgot to say which Group released each series, with the Release Name"
