Dead Rising 2 Chuck Greene moved to the glamorous and glitzy Fortune City, the last and largest temple of entertainment in America, where he will face a field full of zombies with the only goal of eliminating as many as possible and stay alive .

Fortune City players can carry two objects, a roll of tape and a little imagination to create a weapon to kill combined with zombies. A piece of wood and a mowing machine can become a portable reaper that cut up the zombies, a garden rake and a car battery can be combined to shock. 2-player cooperative mode and competition for up to 4, hundreds of zombies and brilliant combination of weapons are the pillars of the most terrifying and wild game of the year.
