Starring Emmy Award winner Jimmy Smits (â€œNYPD Blue,â€ â€œThe West Wingâ€), â€œOutlawâ€ is a new drama from executive producer  John Eisendrath (â€œAlias,â€ â€œFelicity,â€ â€œPlaymakersâ€). Cyrus Garza (Smits) is a U.S. Supreme Court justice who abruptly quits the high-level position. A playboy and a gambler, Garza had always adhered to a strict interpretation of the law until he realized the system he believed in was flawed. 

Show Nfo - Playboy Supreme Court Justice Cyrus Garza has an epiphany -- which leads him to make a radical decision to step down and go into private practice. Garza's first case -- a last ditch attempt to save a condemned client from death - tests his mettle and resolve as they have never been tested before. Aided by a legal team comprised of his best friend, respected defense attorney Al Druzinsky, loyal law clerk Mereta Stockman, Yale-educated and conservative Eddie Franks and sassy private eye Lucinda Pearl, Garza seems likely to make his mark as a legal crusader. However, by flouting the system and turning maverick, he may have made some dangerous enemies in very high places -- enemies who, even now, may be actively plotting against him.
