[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-16T19:43Z,"@ monu432 - We need to talk in private. (^_^) Do not worry, nothing is wrong. I just would like you to talk to you, but not here, way to public. Also I know several people who would like to talk with you. Anyways, please send me an email at either the hotmail.co.uk or the hotbox.ru account. I would prefer the hotmail, so we can instant message.  Also if possible could you take a picture of the setup, it would definitely help. Waiting eagerly for your email! (*_*) "
