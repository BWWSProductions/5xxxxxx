,zzzpanman,2010-09-16T13:37Z,"Hi SH@R!
First - this is a very good quality file a10/v10
But i was missing info about the source it was ripped from (you state that 'this dvdrip has been converted' to...); or maybe just a sample, and whether any modifications like audio dubbing or anything was made - all maybe because I couldn't believe it was the real thing.
But this is the real deal and a damn nice 1 :)
THX for uploading!"
[V],jainmehul,2010-09-16T13:54Z,Please post some screens??......
,Shar1973,2010-09-16T17:49Z,"Hi zzzpanman
I see what you mean. The only thing I did was downloading ISO files and converted it to AVI with a program I have. Before the upload I make sure that the quality of the AVI should be close to perfect. Added the pictures and infofiles to it and thats it. So what should mention in my torrent when I upload the file? And thanks for the compliment you are really helping me a lot.

p.s. to  jainmehul;
Do you mean that (besides my pictures)you also would like to see a page of pictures?

Just read your note of yesterday about the screenshots. Could not find this tool. Will try to seach and add this when I upload my next DVDRip today or tomorrow. For me you earn the blue skull. Thanks again for helping me out.

,SiCCnD,2010-09-22T03:03Z,why does it say its 4 hours long?
,Shar1973,2010-09-25T23:29Z,"Hi SiCCnD;
I guess that the first (general) part is reffering to the (input) time the program needs to convert the movie from ISO to AVI. The 2nd part is the output (1h-41 mn)
