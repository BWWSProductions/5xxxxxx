,jackalope77,2010-09-17T23:10Z,"Just download Firefox and Adblock Plus add-on.  Sometimes I forget that TPB even has ads, cuz I cant see them!

Something definitely goes wrong with TPB every day, but it is still so much better than any other torrent site out there that it is worth the occasional suffering and inability to edit your uploads, lol."
,lacalves,2010-09-18T15:21Z,"hi ctang,
Remember Layer Cake? (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5604418), there are 8 leechers stuck at 99,8% is there any way you could seed this movie again?
Love your uploads, love more when you upload untouched dvd9 ;)"
,jackalope77,2010-09-18T20:40Z,"Everyone take a look at this:

http://thepiratebay.org/search/ntsc/0/3/202

That is a link to search for NTSC in the DVDr category.  Look at the seeders for each torrent.  Only the torrent that say NL subs or Swedish have any seeds at all.  Everything else has 1-3 seeds or 0 seeds.  Is there a problem with the trackers we are using?  My latest upload is taking forever to get out there, already twice as long as the one before it and still only halfway there.  Any suggestions?"
,the604,2010-09-19T15:48Z,"Hey ctang, thanks for all the great uploads!

REQUEST: Body Of Lies-special edition  w/extras

If you can! Thanks"

[T],ctang,2010-09-20T04:30Z,"oh and by the way, this and The wedding singer should have a lot more seeders coming up very soon"
,trytryagain1,2010-09-20T23:00Z,"No problem Agentbay, old news.  Damn Ctang talk about a classic, can't wait to check this one out, thanks."
[T],ctang,2010-09-22T00:28Z,"well hows this, i deleted this off my computer before i burned it to a disc so now i get to download my own release...FUCK!!!"
,trytryagain1,2010-09-22T03:38Z,Sorry to laugh but damn that is funny.  That is the sort of thing that I would do.
[T],ctang,2010-09-22T04:43Z,haha me too lol...just took 5 hours for me to alphabetize all my dvd's...wow my back is killing me
