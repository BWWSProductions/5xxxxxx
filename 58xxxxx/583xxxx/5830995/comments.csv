,Teletubbie,2010-09-18T09:48Z,"Since it is a Wave 6 game it has to have the SS version set to 2. If you know how to use the ABGX, then you see it is a SS version one. You have to patch it with the version 2 files found at ABGX.NET.
Since the files are not there YET, don't even bother to burn and less play it.. If You don't want the big ban hammer up Your ... in November.
So, wait until it is verified at ABGX.NET or buy the game. Simple as that."

,MrKnugen,2010-09-20T17:59Z,"flyersserbia yeah i think so.. you probably get banned :(
maybe if you delete all saves from it before you connect to internet you wouldn't get banned.. but i think you will anyway :(   "
,flyersserbia,2010-09-20T18:47Z,but i play with my xbox about 2years and i play before release day and i never was banned!! lucky or what???:)
,DIGGLER18,2010-09-21T17:25Z,"Hi! Is it only me who has a problem with the burning? Just can`t seem to get it to work,have tried it 2 times and it`s not working:("
,shittii,2010-09-23T10:12Z,Still no ABGX verification for this PAL version of the game. Over a week has passed since the original release date. I'm getting itchy. :)

,gymrat780,2011-09-14T04:20Z,"One gay thing about this game for those that like season mode, is that if you quit a game even at the beginning, it sims it, usually it is an L. Fuking gay as hell."
