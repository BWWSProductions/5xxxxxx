From AbrahamVerghese.com:

Abraham Verghese's first novel has gained considerable momentum in the 
year since its publication and is now on several prestigious "Best of 
2009" lists.

In April, the American Booksellers Association announced the winners 
of the 2010 Indies Choice Book Awards, reflecting the spirit of 
independent bookstores nationwide. Cutting for Stone won the award for 
Adult Fiction.The award will be presented at BookExpo America 2010 in 
New York later this month. Cutting for Stone also won the award for
Fiction for books published in 2009 from the Northern California Independent
Bookseller Association.

The story is a riveting saga of twin brothers, Marion and Shiva Stone, 
born of a tragic union between a beautiful Indian nun and a brash British 
surgeon at a mission hospital in Addis Ababa. Orphaned by their mother's 
death in childbirth and their father's disappearance, and bound together 
by a preternatural connection and a shared fascination  with medicine, 
the twins come of age as Ethiopia hovers on the brink of revolution.

But it's love, not politics -- their passion for the same woman -- that 
will tear them apart and force Marion to flee his homeland and make his 
way to America, finding refuge in his work at an underfunded, overcrowded 
New York City hospital. When the past catches up to him, wreaking havoc 
and destruction, Marion has to entrust his life to the two men he has 
trusted least in the world: the surgeon father who abandoned him and the
brother who betrayed him.
