 "This is a interesting read, and provides a useful overview of the organisation and activities of Germany's comparatively small band of Special Forces units." - Military History Encyclopedia on the Web (November 2009)

"Other recommendations for specialty military history collections include Gordon Williamson's German Special Forces of World War II, telling of German's wartime elite units." -The Bookwatch (January 2010)

"In his book, author Gordon Williamson has a look at the beginnings of these forces, including the rivalry between the army and the Waffen SS. Then there are sections on these units in the Army, SS, Kriegsmarine, and Luftwaffe. All of this is illustrated by a goodly selection of period photographs and that artwork of Mike Chappell. This includes uniforms that were worn by the various units through the war. A truly interesting and somewhat unique look at units that have not had all that much written about them. A book I found quite engrossing and one that I can easily recommend to you." -Scott Van Aken, Modeling Madness / www.modelingmadness.com (February 2010)
Product Description
A long-overdue study of the troops that made up Germany's elite special forces of World War II. Such forces included the legenday Skorzeny Commandos who carried out such audacious tasks as the glider-borne rescue of Mussolini, and the kidnapping of the son of the Hungarian regent, Admiral Horthy. This book also includes details of lesser-known units such as the Brandenburgers, who operated behind enemy lines in captured uniforms, and the KleinkampfverbÂ¿nde who were the forerunners of modern-day naval combat troops like the US Navy SEALs. Complete with uniform and kit detail together with action accounts of many of these daring operations, this book is a must-have for any special forces enthusiast.
