Is There Anything New Like A Working Norton Trial Reset For Norton 2011???"
[T],armesht,2010-09-14T23:04Z,if you can post such as this appl. or post norton for 30 days 
,gwapsako,2010-09-15T14:02Z,"in the event the 90days runs out and there is still no trial reset, just uninstall NIS 2011 using revo uninstaller and clean it w/ CCleaner. Then reinstall the 90 day trial and update.
and there you go! another 90 days! it worked for me w/ NIS 2010 165 day trial everytime"
,gwapsako,2010-09-15T15:48Z,corrections guys...i think you need to use Norton removal tool for the NIS 2011 instead of revo
,rogamosh,2010-09-15T16:20Z,Is There No Permanent Solution???
,bullseye[0],2010-09-16T19:27Z,"Has anyone tried NTR2010-v1.7 or v2.9.6 
to see if it resets to 365"
,rogamosh,2010-09-17T02:05Z,NTR 2010 1.7 IS Not Working...It's Working With The NIS 2011 Beta Version But In Case Of The Final Release It's Not Working.....I Haven't Tried NTR 200 2.9.6......
,echo873,2010-09-18T12:07Z,2.9.6 works just fine. Never tried any other versions myself. Wonder how did you get your hands on such old versions designed for older Nortons.
