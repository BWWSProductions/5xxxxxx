            When the number of computers in existence and their           
            processing capacity exceeds that of all mankind, a point      
            of technological singularity is encountered.                  
            A massive economic and systematic crisis hits the entire      
            world. Nobody knows the exact cause, and all solutions to     
            fix it, are failing. We are about to lose our position as     
            a dominant specie on the planet, in favor of something we     
            have created... computers.

            When you are being framed for crime, it's up to you to
