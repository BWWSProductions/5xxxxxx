Sailor Moon Stupid was a fanfiction piece written by Kevin Bruner which was then adapted into a radioplay by Laura Vasilion.

It put the Sailor Moon Universe in a parody that made me laugh through my childhood. (Side note to that: I would put Parental Guidance on parts of this. Not real bad, just PG13)
