I found this torrent on another site and hopefully it will cross-seed correctly...

It includes a 2 hour, 38-track score (apparently the official score is 19 tracks).  The official MP3s are 128 while the added tracks are 192 but... anyway.

The licensed-music folder contains 80 minutes in 27 tracks - which is less than other torrents but the quality is consistent at 192.

All in all, after comparing with other Bioshock OSTs here on TPB, I'm sure you'll agree this is the best...

Just be sure to use the M3U playlist files instead of the internal tags (sorry but I didn't want to alter the original torrent).
