,Mr.Lucifero,2011-12-05T21:29Z,"Jonzee...I love your collection even though most of your films have not been transfer to blu-ray as of yet....I have to tell you that I'm constantly amazed at the quality of your uploads....Nice DVD quality!!!....As good as it gets without being a blu-ray....I only give out V/9 & V/10 rating for blu-ray quality uploads and V/8 and V/8.5 for DVD quality uploads....This film, much like ""The Petrified Forest"", ""The Public Enemy and ""Bullets or Ballots"" from your collection, gets a V/8.5 rating from me....Fantastic DVD quality!!!....I have a request...I can't find a good copy of ""I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" and Errol Flynn's ""The Prince and the Pauper""....Any chance of you uploading these two film in the future??....KEEP THE OLD WARNER BROS. CLASSICS COMING!!!....Thanx for the good work... 8)"
