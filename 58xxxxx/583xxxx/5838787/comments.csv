,hairyassapeman,2010-09-18T21:16Z,Do you need a valid beta key to play it?
,thenat17,2010-09-18T21:56Z,"yesm if dont have it, you dont play ! so dont dl ! the game have a securom and serial and code , so torrent users dont play .
no crack, no download. no reason."
,Likeadidas95,2010-09-18T21:57Z,i hope this works like charm ! :)
,Likeadidas95,2010-09-18T21:58Z,"AWH, SERIAL KEY ?! shiiittee ! :s"
,Tenonrs,2010-09-18T22:48Z,"There is a txt file in this torrent, i managed to translate it and it says:
1, to the official website to download the latest version of the TDU2 Beta version (do not use the first version of the time)
2, install the game, and upgrade to the latest version
3, the crack extract the files to the game's installation folder, overwrite the original EXE file
4, run ""TestDrive2.exe"" to start the game (Note: Do not use UpLauncher.exe start the game, otherwise it will not break automatically upgraded to version)
5, use the official server is open note
6, into the game, you will be prompted serial number is wrong, leave it alone, simply press OK to start after the normal game.

SO MAYBE WE CAN PLAY THIS WITHOUT KEY"
,kevmeister95,2010-09-19T06:59Z,"I'm curious...if you can play this game without the serial, is that the offline mode that yer playin'?  because their server's should have legitimate users tagged by serial key...right?"
,CaptainJacSparrow,2010-09-19T07:48Z,A key nor a crack is needed.  It plays straight out the box.
,Likeadidas95,2010-09-19T10:54Z,"m, im going to try this out .. idont care if this need key or smth .. i just dl .. mby crack or smth comes out too ! i have always trust "" thenoobish "" torrents and he is very good uploader :)"
,thenat17,2010-09-19T11:07Z,they are NO more BETA KEYS !! so you dont play... // official forum tdu2.com
,cschrille1,2010-09-19T12:10Z,"OH MY GOD IT FREAKING WORKS BRO!!!. Thank you so much man. I just exe'd the Testdrive2.exe and whoop, Im ingame :D. Also an idea is to play in offline mode just to  be safe."
,hairyassapeman,2010-09-19T14:24Z,Well I'll give it a try and see what happens.
,T.Radius4,2010-09-19T16:20Z,"Hey, Maybe a huge NOOB question,

The Bin file in the Winrar file, do I have to mount that with magicIso or something?

And is the crack inside of the Bin file?"
,cschrille1,2010-09-19T16:24Z,"Just use the exe file and it will install it for you. I think its precracked so DONT use the Uplauncher.exe when its done, use Testdrive2.exe to launch the game."
,T.Radius4,2010-09-19T17:11Z,"thanks for the reply , but why are there BIN files then , and what does step 3 do in the readme?

''3, the crack extract the files to the game's installation folder, overwrite the original EXE file''"
,cschrille1,2010-09-19T18:41Z,"Dont do anything, just install it through the exe in the .rar file. After its done just run Testdrive2.exe.
If you have a problem with not being able to visit car store (the game just loads forever) tell me and i will help you."
,T.Radius4,2010-09-19T19:08Z,"Thanks!

I am still downloading at 62,4Kb/s :S so I tell you when I need help!

Thanks!"

,justcause28,2010-09-19T21:32Z,This workd for me until I try and enter the only car dealership I see on the map and then its stuck in an endless loading loop.
,JeffL4P,2010-09-19T22:52Z,"There is no virus.  I am playing it right now.  The only problem I am having is I don't have any money.  In the real beta, you have $999,999,999 in money or something like that.  Is there a way to fix this or has anybody played this and started with money?

Thanks.

~ Jeff"
,T.Radius4,2010-09-19T23:06Z,"@Deantjah yes I also have the problem with my ESET antivirus, when I install the beta there's a report of a trojan, so after the installation the infected files are removed directly, I just tried to start the game and I see a loading sign right under in the screen and then I get an crash report :S "
,JeffL4P,2010-09-19T23:09Z,"There is no virus!!  Like I said, I am playing it right now with no problems except having $0 which is annoying because you can't buy any new cars and you can't make any money either.

~ Jeff"
,justcause28,2010-09-19T23:31Z,There is no virus in this. Ive played this for the past hour and its a total waste of time because theres no offliune career mode and theres no offline races. You can earn money by passing traffic fast and close. also if you want to buy a car you can trade the POS car you got at the start for the Lancia.
,fernandostyle88,2010-09-19T23:58Z,Dude. This has 2 trojan's! Can somebody make a proper crack for this version? (with no trojan's)
,JeffL4P,2010-09-20T00:46Z,"I'm the true beta (if you get chosen,) you get a ton of money to do whatever with."
,gamer_84,2010-09-20T02:30Z,Can somebody upload just exe file in this torrent or where can I find it
,justcause28,2010-09-20T03:30Z,Dude if this had two trojands Avast would have told me so and blocked it and Trojan remover didnt find anything so its what you call a false positive dude.
,JeffL4P,2010-09-20T03:42Z,Did anybody happen to figure out how to make any money yet?  I'm stuck at $0.
,fernandostyle88,2010-09-20T09:11Z,"@justcause28
My antivir avira says that testdrive2.exe and TDU2.dll has a trojan.
so are you sure that i can take the risk?

thx"
,hairyassapeman,2010-09-20T10:04Z,"I can confirm it works.  Just install and run the testdrive2.exe afterwards. No need for a crack or serial.  Just make an offline profile.   My Norton Antivirus doesn't detect any virus.

Having said that, there doesn't seem to be much you can do. I drove around Ibiza for awhile, bought some new clothes, but the game got stuck in an endless loading loop when I visited the car dealership.  I haven't found any offline races yet. 

You can earn money by passing traffic, just go fast and pass them very closely.  Watch the top of the screen and you'll see money start to be made. Just bank it before you crash or you lose it.

Seems all this is really good for is to see what it will be like to cruise around Ibiza."
,fernandostyle88,2010-09-20T10:33Z,"same here game got stuck in an endless loading loop when I visited the car dealership.

someone know how to fix this? thx"
,sleby,2010-09-20T12:46Z,"fix for endless loop: try alt+f4 during the loop and start the game again. after that you will be able to enter the car saloon. it works for me anyway..
you can then trade your shitty mustang for lancia delta intergrale or test drive few other cars..
but it's pointless in playing this game because there is no offline challenges, besides all the shitty driving physics.."
,sleby,2010-09-20T15:06Z,"oh yea, and you can store money in bank with enter.. and this way of collecting money sucks also.."
,kevmeister95,2010-09-20T17:03Z,"my guess is there will eventually be an open beta.  when they do that, then all a guy SHOULD have to do is authenticate yer profile then everything should unlock.  "
,T.Radius4,2010-09-20T17:06Z,"Allright! it works!

but I dotn have fucking money :S"
,rienieeeeee,2010-09-20T17:16Z,Can somebody help. Because if i install the game. TDU2.DLL won't install and TDU2.EXE what did i wrong?
,defxtreme,2010-09-20T17:55Z,I only get TDU2.DLL error and i ignore it and when i want to launch game than another error comes up!
,JeffL4P,2010-09-20T17:59Z,I may have to reinstall it because I can't even make money by passing traffic..
,h3ll4b0y,2010-09-20T18:03Z,"guys to get money try a memory editor (eg: cheat engine,...)"
,rienieeeeee,2010-09-20T19:27Z,Where is the exe located because he gives errors when i try install it. The TDU2.dll and TDU2.EXE are not installed. When i re-instal it. It stay giving error.
,rienieeeeee,2010-09-20T19:50Z,A important tip! If you use NOD virus scanner. Put it off. Or you can't install him.
,JeffL4P,2010-09-20T21:02Z,"Does anybody know of a ""money trainer?"""

,T.Radius4,2010-09-21T16:04Z,why cant we go online? because we don''t have a seriial?
,T.Radius4,2010-09-21T17:18Z,isnt there a trainer for the beta?
,cschrille1,2010-09-21T17:45Z,To play this game online you will need a serial. To get a serial you need to get chosen for closed beta. So no we cant play online.

,JeffL4P,2010-09-22T16:19Z,"It's all good.  I figured out that if you can get a hold of someone's game save that is already in the beta, just replace the ""profilelist.dat"" and the three files inside the folder with your name on it that contains the gamesave in My Documents and then you're good to go."
,kevmeister95,2010-09-22T16:33Z,@JeffL4P;  you wouldn't have access to one of the game saves...would you?
