

The Israeli offensive in Gaza was described by Amnesty international as "22 days of death and destruction." Sharyn Lock's eye-witness account brings home the horror of life in Gaza beneath the bombs.

Lock went to the Gaza strip as volunteer, thinking the greatest danger she faced was sneaking past the Israeli sea blockade in a fishing boat, but soon after her arrival Israel attacked Gaza's 1.5 million inhabitants by land, air and sea. With others from the International Solidarity Movement, Lock volunteered with Palestinian ambulances, assisting them as they faced overwhelming civilian casualties. Her candid and dramatic blog from Gaza gave the world an insight into the conflict that the mainstream media -- unable to enter Gaza -- couldn't provide.

Gaza: Beneath the Bombs provides a view of Gaza difficult to glimpse from outside -- of a people who face their oppression not only with courage but with humor.
