Bat-Manga!: The Secret History of Batman in Japan is a 2008 book published by Pantheon Books. The book was designed by Chip Kidd with the assistance of photographer Geoff Spear. It collects a Japanese shÅnen manga adaptation of the American comic book series Batman by Jiro Kuwata simply entitled Batman and also includes photographs of vintage Batman toys from Japan.  

In 1966, Batman manga was created during the Batman craze in Japan, when the hit US TV series came to Japanese television audiences. The shÅnen magazine ShÅnen King and its publisher ShÅnen GahÅsha licensed the rights to make their own Batman stories, with Batman\'s original publisher, DC Comics full consent. A year later, the stories stopped. They were never collected in Japan, and never translated into English. Bat-Manga!: The Secret History of Batman in Japan, collects and translates the series for the first time, appearing alongside stunning photographs of the worldâ€™s most comprehensive collection of vintage Japanese Batman toys, along with an exclusive interview with Jiro Kuwata, the manga master who originally wrote and drew the Batman manga series. 

This is The Dynamic Duo as youâ€™ve never seen them, with a distinctly Japanese, atomic-age twist as they battle aliens, mutated dinosaurs, and villains who wonâ€™t stay dead.
