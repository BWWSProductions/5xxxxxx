The main objective of the game is to pick up customers and take them to their chosen destination as fast as possible. Along the way, money can be earned the game is primarily a score attack title by performing stunts such as the "Crazy Through" near misses with other vehicles; both risk and reward are higher when driving against the flow of traffic and "Crazy Drift" extended, barely controlled skidding. It pays large dividends to avoid all other traffic in general. A really severe head on collision can send the cab up into the air, where it will come down facing the wrong direction. Hence, you lose precious time on your route.
