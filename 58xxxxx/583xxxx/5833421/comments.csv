He changed his name after he was deported from the U.S., but his teachings are the same - dangerous and insane."

,HeyNonnyNonnyNonnyMus,2010-10-08T11:52Z,"The fact that you believe that your fellow humans might be 'humanoids' is a bizarre one and shows the dangers of following the Bhagwan's 'teachings'.  De-humanizing those people around you enables you to easily mistreat them -- or even poison them, as the Bhagwan's followers did in 1984.

You sound to me like someone who needs psychiatric help, not the droning lectures of a obsessive and lunatic."
