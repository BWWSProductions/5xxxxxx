You are the Stranger, a man hardened by your years as a gunslinger. The only thing harder than you are the rocks you sleep on at night. You have arrived in a troubled town looking for peace and quiet, but you're not that lucky.

Framed for a crime you didn't commit, you must use your skills as a gunslinger to evade the law and fight to stay alive in a corrupt western town where everyone wants you dead. Fight your way through ten action packed levels.

Save the day by thwarting a train heist, go one on one with other gunslingers, fight your way through an abandoned mine and save the girl from a rich tycoon Hell-bent on seeing you dead. Then ride off into the sunset.if you're still alive
