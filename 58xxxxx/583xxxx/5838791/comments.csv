,-1.kbps,2010-09-19T07:10Z,"what do you mean? Its every NIN song besides the FREE ghost Tracks and maybe one movie track

if your a NIN fan, this torrent is perfect for you.. I dont know what else to say. NIN fans only.. its my first torrent.."
,sucksucker,2010-09-19T18:20Z,I think you missed some.
,-1.kbps,2010-09-19T20:43Z,"Your right, the CD pretty Hate Machine isnt on the list

I may upload pretty hate machine as a separate torrent since I somehow forgot to include it.

Ghosts and the slip were available free of charge so I didnt include it in this torrent. "

,-1.kbps,2010-09-19T22:23Z,"lol crap, I wish i could change the title because its starting to NOT be a master collection at all.."
,PMartinez,2010-10-28T01:01Z,you should change it to Nine Inch Nails (Major Releases) since he has also released a dozen singles (which are all like EPs with new material) and several remix albums.
