,wolfbane3,2010-09-21T08:49Z,"can anyone give any comments on the quality of this torrent? i have downloaded about half of it, and i cant quite tell yet. and with my pathetic net speed, 13gb is a major commitment, and some reassurance on the quality would b appreciated :)

one small point, based on the partial video i can get, it seems like this is the rip from a russian bluray. is that correct?"
