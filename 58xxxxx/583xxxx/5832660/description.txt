Torche  is a band from Miami, Florida, United States, they play a distinctive style of stoner/ sludge metal. The band categorizes their music as â€˜â€™stoner popâ€™â€˜.

The group was formed in 2004 by Steve Brooks (ex-Floor), Juan Montoya (ex-Floor, ex-Cavity, ex-Ed Matusâ€™ Struggle), Jonathan NuÃ±ez and Rick Smith (who also played in the grindcore bands Shitstorm and Tyranny of Shaw, and the screamo band Tunes for Bears to Dance To). According to MTracks.com: â€œTheir music has a unique, hard-hitting sound that provokes a wide range of emotions, and they have a large fan base throughout the world.â€ They have toured with Mogwai, Isis, Pelican, Black Cobra, Baroness, Jesu, The Sword, Stinking Lizaveta, Harvey Milk and Boris. Steve Brooks, however, has said that they donâ€™t consider themselves a metal band. In describing the bandâ€™s sound, Smith said in an interview: â€œTo me itâ€™s mostly a combination of everything we listen to collectively as a band. We take what we like from what we grew up on and use it as creatively as we can. I think the meshing of different sounds comes naturally just because we all have different musical backgrounds yet have a ton of common interests.â€ In terms of touring, Brooks said Torche is getting more of a young crowd.

On April 8, 2008, the band released their second full-length, entitled Meanderthal. It was produced by Kurt Ballou (Converge, Genghis Tron). It was met with critical acclaim, including that from Decibel Magazine who ranked Meanderthal #1 on their list of the Top 40 Extreme Albums of 2008 as well as an 8.2/10 by Pitchfork Media. In an interview, Brooks said the band themselves came up with the albumâ€™s concept in terms of artwork and packaging. Brooks has also said that in terms of writing material, the band focuses on what they like, rather than worrying about a â€œbacklashâ€ from their fans.

In late 2008 Juan Montoya left the band, a move credited to musical differences. Steve Brooks said â€œHe is an amazing guitarist, but we are just not on the same pageâ€¦ but Torche will still carry on as a 3 piece bandâ€.

Torche has fulfilled this statement by embarking on several tours, including one with the band dredg and another with a reunited Harvey Milk.
