,Cody_Watson,2010-09-25T05:13Z,"@fr3ak82 No twilight eh? Explain this description in the .nfo file:
As a string of mysterious killings grips
Seattle, Bella, whose high school graduation 
is fast approaching, is forced to choose between her love for vampire Edward and her friendship with werewolf Jacob.

Sounds like Twilight to me, nevertheless, I just downloaded and checked the links and they all link to the ACTUAL knight and day."
