,PSY6661,2012-03-06T22:47Z,"quick question, ive never done any downloading of playstation games before, so im curious about this...if i downloaded this game and then placed it on my flash drive then did the necessary steps needed to make sure all the files were there, would i be able to install it on my ps3's hard drive and then play it off of that?"

,zzirhp,2012-03-16T21:03Z,"Seems like every racing game I search for all come back as PAL..where the hell are the NTSC-U releases?

Anyone know if PAL games will work on an NTSC-U console that has a ModBo 4.0 installed??"
,zzirhp,2012-03-16T21:09Z,"Disregard my previous question. Just read this in the description of my ModBo 4.0

""The Modbo 4 also has auto media detection for direct booting and All Region DVD Support.""

So it sounds as though I should be able to run PAL games on my NTSC-U console."
,zzirhp,2012-03-16T21:12Z,"Can someone PLEEAAASE upload:
""Dirt to Daytona"" or ""NASCAR Dirt to Daytona"" for PS2? (same game, I'm just not positive of the exact title)

I've been dying to find this game because it has sprint cars, the only upload here at TPB has no seeds :("
,Erx31,2012-04-23T17:54Z,"Works great on my ps2 modded slim!
