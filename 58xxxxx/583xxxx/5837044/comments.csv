,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-05-08T00:54Z,"for some reason the multiplayer isn't working, i don't know if it is that no one is online or that i didn't unblock internet connection for the game, but when i made a internet server i was playing normaly, so is it that this version is outdates, i didn't unblock, or no one is on"
