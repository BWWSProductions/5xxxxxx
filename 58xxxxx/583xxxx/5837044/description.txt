Day of the Zombie. Made by Groove Games. Basically the exact same thing as Land of the Dead but with a new single player and a few new features.

story mode is funner and set up better than lotd too, though the story is kinda weak and stupid. you play as 3 different people: a college student looking for his lady, a college janitor trying to save his school (thinks it's all student pranks), and an army soldier (trying to find civilians i guess).

INSTALLATION:
Extract
Mount or Burn
Install
Play (no cracks or serials needed)


ENJOY AND FREAKING SEED!!!!!
