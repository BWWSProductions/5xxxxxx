,jechko,2010-09-16T15:42Z,Has anyone tried it already
,2LTPhan,2010-09-19T20:14Z,Thanks it worked perfectly. You need to use the serial in the txt not the ones he listened in the description. Btw it only last for 121 days.
,dhonzie_zerda,2010-09-20T20:35Z,"thank u very much to the uploader....
did anyone tested the key?
can someone could re upload the key.txt only 'cuz the link is broken......
THANKS IN ADVANCE..."
,TheState,2010-09-29T01:26Z,"Yeha link is broken, can someone toss up a serial?"
,dothackjhe,2010-09-30T15:52Z,The serials in this torrent have already been blacklisted by BitDefender's server. I had experienced a good working serial key got blacklisted by BitDefender after some time of using it. We should wait for a good working patch for this one just like what I'm using on my p1r4t3d copy of BitDefender 2010. I still got 13000+ days of use for BitDefender 2010 and that is thanks for the good working patch for it.
,dothackjhe,2010-09-30T15:53Z,My first statement about serial keys in this torrent being blacklisted are just my personal assumptions. 
,xmassacre,2010-10-01T22:43Z,anyone tried the same patch for the 2010 release as ive had instances where an older patch will still work with newer software. Im actually still quite happy with my 2010 release so gonna stay put for a while
,shotinthe,2010-10-02T20:40Z,"This thing just recycles instructions to reboot your computer before installation, which is meaningless.
Conclusion: after trying or several hours, bogus torrent."
,Tatletz,2010-10-16T02:07Z,"This torrent is useless,it doesn't work. Serials are not valid. Tried the patch for BD 2010 with no success. Looks like we must wait for a proper patch for BD 2011. "
,rayder75,2010-10-22T22:46Z,"To pkaji123,

Look, I know I should not complain but you should at least follow your own torrent comments to help us out here. If you put something out give us wisdom or guidance to help you get the skulls and seed your work. Your torrent is crap I am sorry to say :-("
,THENECRO0,2010-11-07T16:23Z,wow this is great software i love uuu
,GigaTorrent,2010-11-10T00:48Z,Sorry to say. Your torrent is crap. NO SERIALS
,Eternity920,2010-11-18T03:34Z,"You may try this key...

BITDEFENDER TOTAL SECURITY 2010 : 

8FE2F56786009B332EA9

356 days

It worked fine for me...

Tell me if it worked for you too. 훯혵"
,Eternity920,2010-11-18T03:56Z,Its 2011... sorry.훯혵
,Akrome,2010-11-18T18:17Z,"Guys dis one is a freaking virus, it make my PC lag so much and freeze, now i have to reformat my comp dont download dis"
,dothackjhe,2010-11-20T06:00Z,"@Eternity920

The serials didn't worked for me. Even the serials included in this torrent doesn't work. A

Anyone got a working (even trial keys) just to install this software? Box has already made a patch for BitDefender 2011. All I need right now is to install this and apply the patch. ."
,weblapro,2010-11-29T11:20Z,absolutelly not worked for me
,TMcGrath,2010-12-20T23:26Z,"This product works beautifully. Here's some things to clear up any confusion:

I did exactly what you would imagine. I installed the application, and entered the serial number...

BUT it immediately told me that the serial was not for BitDefender Total Security 2011. It was for BitDefender Total Security 2011 WITH ONLINE BACKUP! So it asked me if I wanted to install it with online backup support, and I clicked on ""Hell Yes"" (not really). It installed the program like a charm, and I'm not using free internet backup from BitDefender's servers. Woo!

Best.Torrent.Ever.

My specs:

Sony Vaio NW Series
Windows 7 Ultimate x64
Dual Core Intel Processors @ 2.4 Ghz"
,TMcGrath,2010-12-20T23:32Z,"*now

The serial given with this torrent works to install the trial. You'll have to find a serial to permanently install it, or use Box's patch."
,bbbplayer55,2010-12-30T04:34Z,serial don't work. There should have been a crack.
,bbbplayer55,2010-12-30T04:34Z,And all of the keys you listed don't work.
,darshak_bhatti,2011-01-04T05:54Z,hey does BOX's patch works????????
,omaewayowai,2011-02-06T11:46Z,"There is actually nothing wrong with the serials. I'm guessing why it isn't working for the rest of you is because you didn't update the software after the install. But the serial only works for 162 days. So when it is about to expire, just replace the serial with a new working serial."
,coolghazi2011,2011-02-22T19:44Z,"Hey guys does anyone know if it detects keygen and serials what will happen then ??? can we solve this problem or not cuz recently im just wondering to install this AV to my pc.on my pc nod32 is working just fine what would u guys recommend it for me ??? plzzz do comment me okay u guys :)

Many thanks to the uploader."
,Neysayer,2011-07-28T21:12Z,"This is one of the shittiest uploads I've ever seen. One serial number??? ONE??? wow... what was the fucking point of even uploading it??? I might as well just go to the actual fucking website and download the demo. Fucking stupid. And the icing on the cake?... that ONE serial number doesn't even fucking work! LOL And when you TRY to just ""skip through registration"" it doesn't even give you the option to click on ""NEXT"" to skip it!! HAHA!!! This shit is great. Fuck this dumbass torrent."
