,dangitsalex,2011-08-10T01:51Z,I can't seem to install Shadowgrounds. I click install.exe and an error comes up.
,A.P.,2011-11-29T22:10Z,this torrrent is pure excrement. dont even bother downloading. the first game has a shitty custom installer that just gives you an error and the second game also gives you an error everytime you try to launch it.
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-03-30T20:59Z,"@A.P. if you'd have payed more attention you would have noticed there is a way to contact me located in this and ALL of my other torrents. i may have been able to help you but apparently you were being stupid and would rather just troll. both games work just fine without giving any errors but if u get an error contact me, it's not that hard to fix..."
