BTW, I figured out why some of you guys were stuck on 97.5% on one of the other AUTOSPORT torrents and changed some settings so this should not happen again (specifically, I've upped the Seed While Ratio from 150% to 300% and also now allow continued uploading when the Seeding Goal is reached)."

Well after starting with my Motoring News (Newspaper) for from 65 - 72 ( Extreme poverty as a kid ) then getting into Autosport but this was expensive as it had glossy pages and some  "" colour "" thanks for allowing me still to get it as I moved Off World on the other side of the Planet.

Thanks for all your efforts - Ta ... Rick"
