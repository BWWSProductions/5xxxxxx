J. Cole - Best Of... So Far (2010)

This compilation is created by: Real HipHopHead

Despite the fact that J. Cole has not dropped an album, he is being hyped as one of the best newcomers in the game. His first two mix tapes could have been albums they were so smooth. Don't sleep. 

His debut album is scheduled for a December release date.

This 'Best Of...' collection is AMAZING
