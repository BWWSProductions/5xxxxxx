If youÃ¢Ã‚â‚¬â„¢re Selena Gomez, you dance. At least, you get the world on its feet with A Year Without Rain. A follow-up to Kiss & Tell, Selena and The SceneÃ¢Ã‚â‚¬â„¢s gold-certified Hollywood Records debut CD, A Year Without Rain shows Selena and her band, The Scene, in a whole new light, this one pulsating, multicolored and ready for the mirrored ball.
