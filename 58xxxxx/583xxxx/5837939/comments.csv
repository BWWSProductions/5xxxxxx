I need to tell you this:

you will have to delete all the preference files (ambrosia files) and the Snapz X License file from >user>library>preferences directory.

then eliminate the old Snapz from the login items.

Restart the computer

Then install, and add it to the login items

Then restart  (again) will bring up the new Snapz you can register then. 

--- and of course.....

THANK YOU SEEDERS ;-)"

,jesus99,2010-11-03T21:37Z,"License code is date sensitive.

You will need to set your Mac's date back to Sept 18, 2010 before installing/serializing. Go into Date & Time, uncheck the automatic sync, then manually set the date. Then install and enter the license info.

After that you can turn automatic date/time sync back on.

P.S. Jesus loves you all"
