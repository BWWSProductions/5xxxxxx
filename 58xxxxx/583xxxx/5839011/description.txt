LYRICS

[CHOURS] X3
I wanna boom bang bang with your body yo
Were gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl lemme rock you rock you like a rodeo
(Its gonna be a bumpy ride)

[VERSE 1]
I wanna pull you over, pull you under
Make your body surrender to mine
Girl you can make me suffer, do whatever
Cuz i know youre one of a kind

Tell me who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body wind, like me
You will never find someone like me

Who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body wind, like me
You will never find someone like me

[CHOURS] X2
I wanna boom bang bang with your body yo
Were gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl lemme rock you rock you like a rodeo
(Its gonna be a bumpy ride)

[VERSE 2]
Imma spin you around, push your buttons
Buy you plenty of stuff
Then ill take you down, to the bottom
Work you all the way to the top


Tell me who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body wind, like me
You will never find someone like me

Who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body wind, like me
You will never find someone like me
