Plot++++++++++
Max Fischer is a precocious 15-year-old whose reason for living is his attendance at Rushmore, a private school where he is not doing well in any of his classes, but where he is the king of extracurricular activities - from being in the beekeeping society to writing and producing plays, there is very little after school he does not do. His life begins to change, however, when he finds out he is on academic probation, and when he stumbles into love with Miss Cross, a pretty teacher of the elementary school at Rushmore. Added to the mix is his friendship with Herman Blume, wealthy industrialist and father to boys who attend the school, and who also finds himself attracted to Miss Cross. Maxs' fate becomes inextricably tied to this odd love triangle, and how he sets about resolving it is the story in the film.
