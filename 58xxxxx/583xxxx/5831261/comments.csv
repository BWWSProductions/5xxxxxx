,jackalope77,2010-09-15T20:21Z,"I have a WS version, but its non-anamorphic, so it isnt really much better, unless youre using an old tv.  i think theres a criterion edition out there.  someone needs to post it."
[T],ctang,2010-09-15T21:10Z,"jackalope77:  i believe what you have is the same as what this is

,jackalope77,2010-09-15T21:57Z,"@ctang: yup thats what my copy is like.  i would still label that widescreen, its just not anamorphic, that is, enhanced for 16x9 TVs."
[T],ctang,2010-09-15T22:31Z,ya i would say your right but in a way its deceptive because it really really isnt WS (although the actual image is...why they would ever do this is beyond me)...what would you call this then non-anamorphic WS of is there another term for this...thanks
,jackalope77,2010-09-16T22:23Z,"ctang: thats exactly what it is, non-anamorphic widescreen.  full-screen usually indicates that the movie has undergone the pan-and-scan process, which involves taking a widescreen image and chopping off the sides to make it fit on a traditional square TV without the black bars on the top and bottom.

unfortunately, when dvd's first appeared no one really had widescreen TVs so almost none of the discs were widescreen enhanced since it was unnecessary. as widescreen TVs became the norm, dvd producers started taking advantage but some of the discs sadly still made it through with non-anamorphic transfers.  MGM dvd's are especially bad for that, although at least all the studios have gotten it right (mostly) on blu-ray.

watching non-anamorphic content on an old TV will look like normal widescreen, but watching this content on a 16x9 TV will cause it to be all stretched out across the middle of the screen instead of expanding to the whole flat panel. i bought this same copy of rushmore back when i had a square TV, but sadly i cant stand to watch it anymore, except on the old TV in my room ;)"
[T],ctang,2010-09-17T00:16Z,"to watch on a WS tv, why dont you zoom out with your dvd player (well if it supports it)...by the way, thanks for that info (i knew almost all of it except for the history and am always game to learn about that)...it helps a lot!!!"
,jackalope77,2010-09-17T04:04Z,"you can definitely zoom if you are using a standard-defintion TV.  i have a 26"" widescreen CRT in my room and i can watch non-anamorphic content on that no prob by zooming it.  but the 52"" LCD in my living room doesnt work the same way. 480i content like dvd's are automatically upconverted to 1080p but you can still see the digital artifacts from the conversion.  zooming in makes it look horrible, since most of the pixels in the image are artificially created by the dvd player."
[T],ctang,2010-09-17T04:47Z,"on my tv (not the 65"" rear projection) there is a setting to make it not upscale (well its 720p but i would think it would be the same for 1080)...you may want to look more closely at the settings on the tv and hopefully for your sake it has that option"
,jackalope77,2010-09-17T06:09Z,"oh, my tv doesnt upscale, its the dvd player that does that.  i can turn it off, sure, but then the dvd would display in its native resolution of 480i and would look like a little box in the middle of the screen.

but its not a big deal, i dont have much non-anamorphic content and what i do have i am doing my best to upgrade, mostly on blu-ray these days.  rushmore isnt out yet, but i will definitely get it when it is, along with everything else by wes anderson because he's awesome.  i have fantastic mr fox on blu ray, and it is the best thing ever."
[T],ctang,2010-09-17T06:20Z,thats probably where i found the setting too...if you zoom from that point doesnt it make it look like it should
,jackalope77,2010-09-17T09:23Z,"you can get the picture to fit the shape of the TV, but expanded that much it just looks terrible.  anyway, easier just to stick with anamorphic stuff.  very rarely do non-anamorphic dvd's come out these days.  except for trailer park boys season 7, which was non anamorphic for some annoying reason.  and yes i know you have never heard of that, only canadians have, lol."
[T],ctang,2010-09-17T17:05Z,i have actually heard of it...i cant recall where i saw it b4 but i have seen at least one episode
