,bobbertjames,2010-09-17T20:09Z,Thank YOu!!! much anticipated album! how are you liking it?
,krazyq,2010-09-17T20:43Z,"album sucks to be honest, its so light and boring. He didn't even put exposure which was his huge hit.
Armin's Mirage is the winner of 2010!!!"
[T],-inspiron-,2010-09-17T22:15Z,"Hey guys , actually i liked it , but not that much , the first song is great , citadel and sanctuary but i totally agree with  krazyq  i listened to it 2 or 3 times and i got bored and no exposure tune in it also and only 10 songs , i've expected it to be much better , cheers :D"
,bobbertjames,2010-09-21T04:50Z,"I'm enjoying it for the most part. I definitely agree with Mirage taking it though!! love that album! I really want to find the bonus track for this album: it's titled (i will be the same feat. emma hewitt) 

help if you can. thank you again! :P"
,AsBest73,2010-09-22T21:08Z,Great album! Take a soul much deeper than Mirage. Armin must find a new way to realize himself.
[T],-inspiron-,2010-09-24T23:21Z,"this is the bonus tracks only in this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5850610

,Jrexxx,2010-09-26T21:47Z,"Kinda disappointed.. :S thought it will be better, especially that gareth has been talking and preparing for this for so long... As for me the album of the year is without any doubt Schulz's Do you dream. Anw thanks a lot for the upload!"
,MintyNg,2010-10-05T05:14Z,"its pretty chill, i like it thanks for the upload ! "
,civoniz,2010-11-28T09:52Z,"Don't listen to anyone saying this is a bad album or whatver else. Clearly these people don't like Gareth Emery's style that much. Personally I DO. Following this guy ever since he has gone solo with the Garuda Recird Label.

Now to the album, Its and alright album. If you are into Gareth's music, this will suit your ears just fine.
The End"
,LOLiverPB,2010-12-12T14:15Z,"well I dont got much to listen to atm anyway, the latest ASOT has been kinda bad tbh, cant wait for episode 500 tho, 450 was so fucking sick."
