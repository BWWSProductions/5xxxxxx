nothing to say's about this torrent??"
,hectorc01,2010-09-16T21:44Z,"thanks tgleader installed fine on galaxy s took me a while but yr instructions are spot on i was a bit confused on the bit copying maps to memory card hear what i did.... 

on step 5 just drag and drop the eu (if that the one you want!) on to the removable drive(i mounted my phone to act as mass storage in settings) then once copied unmount the phone then from home screen go to my files scroll to bottom and click sd then long press on eu then hit move it will go back a screen hie move here then long press eu again hit copy then hit copilot takes about 20 min to copy, hope this makes sense.........

thanks again uploader works a treat"
,tgcleader,2010-09-18T13:56Z,"Yea when you copy the map or maps you copy the folder names EU, NA, OP, or AF to sdcard/copilot and put it in the folder copilot. You dont want to copy whats in the folder of EA, NA, OP, or AF to sdcard/copilot cause then it wont read in the copilot app that you have maps installed so you copy the whole folder."
,Nerz84,2010-09-19T22:51Z,"the maps are only showing canada and very top of united states, is there a way to get rest of states? im using samsung captivate"
,tgcleader,2010-09-24T11:19Z,Hmmm I didnt know about that it was working fin where I was. What states is it not showing?
,kallekula33,2010-09-25T15:32Z,"Can't get this work on my Samsung Galaxy S with Android 2.1(Eclair). I installed the app in the internal SD card on the phone, register it and it works fine. Then I create a folder on the external SD card like this \SDcard\copilot , then I copy the whole EU folder to that location, however the app doesn't recognise any maps when I start it. Am I missing something here or what ? Please give me exakt step by step instructions please. Thanks for the support and great upload by the way :-). Cheers."
,Nerz84,2010-09-25T17:35Z,"i'm running on a galaxy s too (captivate), it only shows the very top part of US. and not just states because its like there is just a line where it stops, i think i stops south of like detroit"
,lambo_sv,2010-09-28T17:25Z,"thx alot for this amezing stuff!
works great on samsung galaxy s :)"
,ghstboi,2010-09-28T23:18Z,"For those that get the US map only to detroit is because map selection is on Canada, you can change map selection by going to menu and click on the blue left arrow. On the next window click switch map and select the US map."
,kallekula33,2010-09-29T21:18Z,"I can't get this work on my X10. The application simply won't accept the provided code. For instance, I can't input B or S in the fields, and the code contains both B and S. It's quite strange. Can someone confirm this ? Either the code is wrong or it just won't run properly on X10 :-( "
,kallekula33,2010-09-29T21:37Z,"The code is not working on my SonyEricsson X10 :-( , have no idea what's wrong. Does anybody have an idea why ? Please advice how to proceed. "
,shaney08,2010-09-30T19:35Z,"Thanks for the upload tgcleader!!! It's because of guys like you that I decided to go with an android phone :)

One problem though. I installed the AF maps but I get an error when CoPilot starts up:
""POI set standard - Version does not match network version""
The only POI's that show up are the World Cup Stadiums. Nothing else. No restaurants. No malls. Nothing. The CoPilot website recommends to activate the programs using the ID. (I dont have an ID of course). Any ideas how else I can sort this out?

@ kallekula33
I also had a little trouble entering the ""B"" on my Desire. I exited the keyboard. When I brought the keyboard back up again... the ""B"" worked."
,nofear24,2010-10-10T22:19Z,Sony X10 when putting the code in dont put in capitals it makes it capitals anyway. The (b) will work then. otherwise seems to work. also said POI version incorrect but it went in anyway and I can navigate route etc. Awesome been wanting this program forever!!! Thanx
,stadtaffe,2010-10-21T10:24Z,"any chance of posting just the southern african maps (south africa etc..) 

thanks :)"
,slidepast,2010-10-25T19:49Z,"Hi Thanks for the great upload working beautifully on Cyanogen Mod 6.0 HTC Dream.

The only problem I have is that I'm from South Africa and I get the
""POI set standard - Version does not match network version"" when loading the maps.

I'd really appreciate it you could post a stand alone copy of the fixed AF maps

Thanks Again "
,nofear24,2010-10-27T23:54Z,I will upload it with just the SA maps. If it gives the error POI standard just click OK and it carries on. well mine does without any problems.
,nofear24,2010-10-28T00:25Z,"Here is just the South African maps. rarred and the copilot directory. It is missing the readme and the original copilot APP will add them later.

,S3nd41,2010-11-08T17:00Z,"Is there some website where I can get updated maps like every few months or so? When were the maps on this torrent released, does anyone know?"
,kiwij,2010-11-10T02:16Z,"Doesn't work for me.  Galaxy S 2.2 (JPO/Doc's ROM 7.2).  After installation, it asks for language, then next screen asks to DL a voice, it attemps to DL a voice, then I get ""Error Downloading Files"" and the program quits.  No oppurtunity to enter serial or anything. What a waste of 3gb."
,kiwij,2010-11-10T02:35Z,"Update: was able to install application using Espanol, and then changed it to English UK once installation was complete.  I have an additional problem, I install OC (Australia + New Zealand), but I only have australian maps, if I enter an NZ city it doesn't show up in the list.  When I view a map of my current location it is empty."
,kiwij,2010-11-10T02:41Z,Australia works fine. When I view my old copy of copilot it used /copilot/OC/Australasia rather than /Australia and /New Zealand.
,kiwij,2010-11-10T02:46Z,"If you want NZ maps to work then only copy /copilot/OC/australia.  Then copy the data from inside the NZ directory and overwrite the data in the australian directory.  Obviously this will mess up australia as some of the australian files get overwritten, but atleast you will have NZ navigation working correctly."
,juze21,2010-11-16T18:10Z,"Works great on GalaxyS!
To write B in activation code I had to double-click it..."
,EdTown,2010-11-24T18:03Z,"Thanks much for the upload. Works great on the Droid X. I shouldn't be greedy, but is it safe to try to enable the Live Traffic feature though a data connection?"

,WhoDateBeDare,2010-12-31T22:26Z,"Works on HTC HD2 - Android - MCCM SE V3.4 FroyoStone Sense.
Was getting the 'Multiple Cities' message.
Connected to PC as SD mounted drive.
Removed SD/CoPilot
UnPlugged from PC and Plugged back in.
Connected as HTC Sync
Waited to finish Syncing
Installed copilot_8.2.0.218.apk again (never asked for key)
Ran copilot
Asked for maps
exited copilot
unplugged and replugged as mounted drive.
This time I copied ALL speech, OC,NA,EU,AF to sd\copilot
unplugged and replugged with HTCSync.
Finished CoPilot setup.
Ran thru Switch Maps and selected only Australia.
Now working correctly with NO multiple cities.


Had to be HTCSync and actively connected to internet for the voice to download properly.
But I think only because I hadn't copied all files properly.  Otherwise I don't think CoPilot would need to connect to internet to download voices.

,mycroft_holmes,2011-01-03T03:27Z,To input the serial guys don't capitalise the letters it will do that automatically other wise you wont be able to enter B ..swype is best turned off.
,freejellyman,2011-01-05T19:53Z,"Anyone got any newer maps? These maps have the version 2009.02 which is over 2 years old.

To see the version of the maps, just look in the folders for a version.dat and view the contents in a text editor.

Would love to get a hold of some newer maps.

Thanks guys!"

,nostradamus123,2011-03-06T18:55Z,"Works great in Canada on Galaxy with Froyo 2.2 (no data used !!) Thanks tgcleader... Here is  what I did: 
In step 5 just drag and drop the eu (if that the one you want!) on to the removable drive(i mounted my phone to act as mass storage in settings) then once copied unmount the phone then from home screen go to my files scroll to bottom and click sd then long press on eu then hit move it will go back a screen hie move here then long press eu again hit copy then hit copilot takes about 20 min to copy, hope this makes sense.........
Important: when you copy the map or maps you copy the folder names EU, NA, OP, or AF to sdcard/copilot (not the content) and put it in the sub-folder copilot. I Repeat:- DONT  copy whats in the folder of EA, NA, OP, or AF to sdcard/copilot (Just create blank folders)

Following this delete the original subfolder which was under sdcard/copilot/copilot"
,lrld12,2011-03-30T13:32Z,Fabulous - straight in to my HTCF Wildfire - perfect.  Thank YOU!
,SKOERFY,2011-04-07T14:37Z,"I can't get this one to work on my Sony Ericson Xperia X10.
I'll explane my problem and hope someone knows the answer.

The install file says:

1. Copy the .apk to SD Card and install using a Astro File Manager (Which Is Free On the android Market)
CHECK! SO FAR SO GOOD

2. Once installed run copilot and follow the setup until the end key screen appears
CHECK! STILL SO FAR SO GOOD

3. when propted use the following key to regester 

   8N248-B4555-2JJBS-63762-9MK43 

If you screw up entering the key you have to slide your finger acrossed the screen and 
highlight the area you want to redo and re enter it. you cannot delete it atleast you cant on the Droid X 
cause there is no physical keyboard I dont know about the others.

I HAD THIS PROBLEM AND GOOLGED ABOUT IT AND FOUND THAT I HAD TO JUSE COM.ALK.COPILOT.APK, SO I INSTALLED IT.
NOW I CAN PUT IN THE KEY FROM ABOVE.
THAN I PUSH THE >> BUTTON TO GO AHEAD, BUT I GET A MESSAGE THAT THE KEY IS NOT RIGHT... SO 1 PUSH THE X BUTTON AND I AUTOMATICLY EXIT COPILOT.

4. Straight after an online registration page apears, click the X button at the bottom of the screen to exit copilot,


   **********DO NOT REGISTER!!!!!! ONCE AGAIN CLICK THE X BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN DO NOT TRY TO CREATE OR SING IN WITH EXISTING COPILOT ID IT WILL NOT WORK AND YOU WILL HAVE TO REDO IT***********


5. Now copy the folder for eather NA = North America and Canada, EU = Europe, AF = Africa, OC = Australia and New Zeland, or you can copy all Maps to the newly created copilot folder on your sd card (It should look like sd\copilot\(Then Ether NA,EU,AF, OC, Or All)
   Make sure you copy NA, EU, AF, or OC to the folder copilot dont not copy whats in caise these folder or else it wont reconize that you have maps installed.

I MADE A MAP IN SDCARD\COPILOT NAMED EU SO IT LOOKS LIKE THIS: SD\CARD\COPILOT\EU   IT'S BLANK SO THERE NOTHING IN IT...
THAN I COPPIED ALL THE STUFF FROM YOUR EUROPE MAP: CITIES, DATA, PLACES, POLYGONS, SAVE.

6. now run copilot again and finish the setup. It will have you setup which language you want to setup. 
WHEN I START COPILOT AGAIN I HAVE TO PUT IN THE KEY AGAIN, BUT STILL IT WON'T WORK.
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT I MUST DO?"
,ScytheNL,2011-04-24T13:28Z,"Just installed with EU maps to T-mobile Xperia X10 2.1.1 Seems to work fine, did not ask for serial or registration :)

,tgcleader,2011-05-04T19:17Z,"I have been getting flooded with emails lol. Any ways here are some FAQ. 

Q: When I try to download the voices I get an error.

A: You must be connected to wifi for this to work.

Q: it wont let me type certain letters or it duplicates letters.

A: exit out of copilot and go to your browser or text message just something where you can type then put the first [art of the key in then copy it then go to copilot and paste it. Keep repeating steps til the wo;e key is entered.

Q: Some of the middle east maps arnt there.

A: for some reason copilot included part of those in the Canada maps.

Q: Maps arnt showing up when I put them on my sd card.

A: you must put the map folder within the copilot folder. Also dont just put the map files in the copilot folder. They have to be included in the countries folder. For instance it would be Copilot/NA or what ever country your trying to use. If its multiple countries then incluse each country folder."
