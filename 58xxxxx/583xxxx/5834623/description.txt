Release Notes:
Right...sources used were russian video .mpg and own line audio...encoded video a couple times to see if i could
get it looking somewhat watchable...it has scenes missing, it's nothing important, just about why
animals were dying, so i didn't replace it...now onto video work. It was very red in some scenes, and others was
pretty normal, i lowered red a whole lot, using green to balance it, so some scenes look a little green but nothing
major....i used a heavy denoise filter, and a deblock filter to try and get rid of all the damn noise, and blockyness.
I also used a ghost remover to try and fix some of the other problems....i also used a brightness filter and a
contrast filter to try and brighten the movie up, as it was pretty dark...now onto the audio, first 10minutes had a 
damn load of static, it was horrid, we removed as much as we possible could, i included 2 sample's one from 1st 10min
and then another from the movie, it's easily listenable, the audio had other problems, iNK went out and got the line to 
find when he came home the stereo channels had bad static, so I had to convert it to mono, then duplicate the mono channel,
run a stereo processor, then noise filter, then a restoration filter. First 10 minutes were the worst spots, had to 
use heavy noise filter which took away a little bit of the audio life, also used a few other filters on video and
audio just to try and make it somewhat watchable, anyway, take it or leave it but no moaning. Enjoy.
