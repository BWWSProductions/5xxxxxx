,patiodude,2011-01-04T23:31Z,"Very nice. The resolution is absolutely NOT 1080p (it's actually 1280 x 528) but very high quality and comes out very nicely on my 1440p screen (which is 1440 x 2560). 
+1 for download!"

Why fuck with us, dude? "
,faraday0,2011-03-13T18:51Z,"Beware - no english subtitles included in this torrent (despite of what the description claims). Also, couldn't find any fitting subs to this version. I'm hearing impaired, so as far as I'm concerned, this torrent is useless. 

Please, don't lie in the descriptions, you just make people angry.  "

English subtitles for the first part.

Still, DON'T CLAIM THERE ARE SUBS INCLUDED IF THEY AREN'T."
