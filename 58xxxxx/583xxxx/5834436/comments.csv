,ekarth22,2010-10-05T05:46Z,uxtheme.dll is patched or not?
,spawn3731,2010-10-06T06:45Z,It does ask for a product key.
,piraatbreker,2010-10-13T07:51Z,"@ Stun,

 It werks nice upload torrent of yours  seeding now forever  he he he"
[V],vtwin88cube,2010-10-14T07:22Z,It's asking for a key. I'm mounting the image in VMware Workstation. So now I'm in the process of trying to get it to take a key from a list that I downloaded.
[V],vtwin88cube,2010-10-14T07:42Z,"Here's a key that worked for me...
Q8CWH-73232-WV7J3-Y2YRY-64B688
I would not advise trying to activate with this key.
It is good though to get the app powered up."
[V],vtwin88cube,2010-10-14T07:44Z,"Stun...

Thanks for the up : )"
,zesty1,2010-10-15T08:13Z,CLEAN INSTALL ONLY Thats why it asks for a key!
,zesty1,2010-10-15T08:16Z,Clean install only?
,Joshgt2,2010-11-02T18:32Z,"So, if this is asking for a key, but it is also a clean install only, then where do we find a key for this? I thought that the point of having an integrated key was to have it so that you wouldn't need to get a key."
,PimpTee,2010-12-09T05:00Z,"I forget exactly why, but I'm pretty sure VMWare ask for a key no matter what."
