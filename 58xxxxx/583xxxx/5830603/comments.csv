That's really strange. Try to uninstall and install. Also, make sure the program runs as an administrator. Go to the file directory and right click on the .exe and make sure they run as administrator too. That should fix it. If not, contact Ea chat support. They dont ask for key or anything :D"
,blah16,2010-11-03T22:19Z,"The link for the Key Gen does work, can u get another one plz, i would really like to play the game."

,RockyRockTheBoss,2011-07-15T09:59Z,You can just burn the game on a dvd disc and play it that way. That's what I do

I actually bought the game, I just destroyed my disc. These codes work, I used them for my game and for my friends, they can be used over and over again. This is exactly how it appears when you buy the game. Sidenote: This is a great game pack. I definitely recommend downloading if not actually buying it, EA deserves the money here."
,wolfeking,2011-07-18T04:59Z,"moridar - thank you, thank you 1000 times. I lost my manual that had the codes to my disk. Your codes there worked. My favorite disk is in action once again. "
,pyrosatyr,2011-07-26T23:14Z,I'm not that great with this stuff and can't get the game to work. It keeps saying I need to enter a CD ROM and I can't figure out what to do to override that. Not that tech savy
,zermbie,2011-08-19T11:31Z,"pyrosatyr - Not sure about the whole CD issue. Are you clicking on the Command & Conquer The First Decade launcher shortcut that was placed on your desktop during install? Or the direct .exe's in the file folders? Cause if you try to launch, say, YURI.exe, it gives me the no CD problem, but using the Launcher it works fine. If you got rid of the launcher shortcut, it's under the launcher folder in your first decade folder, called ""TFDLauncher.exe""

Also, not sure if anybody else had this problem, but when I tried to launch RA2 or Yuri's revenge, I got a ****FATAL**** something blah blah error. Found a fix that works, figured I'd share it and what not.

After installing fully, if you get the ***FATAL*** error, go to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\EA GAMES\Command & Conquer The First Decade\Command & Conquer Red Alert(tm) II\RA2"" (or wherever you installed the game) and right click on RA2.exe, click on security, then on edit, then allow full control to all users. After, click on compatability tab and click ""change settings for all users,"" then select run this program as an administrator, and run this program in compatability mode for: ""Windows 98 / Windows ME."" Do this again for RA2MD.exe, YURI.exe, game.exe, and 
gamemd.exe. This worked for me on Windows 7. Enjoy.

It's well worth a little bit of hassle for a damn good game."
,mrredhatter,2011-09-14T15:29Z,No SN in torrent? No keygen? WTF!
,Paradigm2,2011-09-23T18:39Z,"I know some are having issues with ""no CD"" errors I never had to mount anything and 1 all through RA2 work except Generals and Tiberian Sun I understand generals because it is newer and i believe tiberian sun is newer too I'll try the internal launchers like some have mentioned. otherwise any help?"
,Paradigm2,2011-09-23T18:42Z,oh and any suggestions on what to set my video settings to for C&C original (Tiberian Dawn) the game works but video has chopped up colours and mixed up wrong colours as well
,matt2887,2011-11-20T09:06Z,"Thanks up-loader and seeders. Great torrent, great game. my disk cracked on me and I needed a new way to install /play the game. For anyone who has an issue with needing a CD to PLAY the games, the best think I know and can suggest is to install the game from this file pack, then use ImgBurn to make this file pack into an ISO and use Daemon Tools to mount the image and play. Links below! Enjoy!
