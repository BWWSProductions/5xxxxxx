[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-14T23:22Z,"@ penguin1-1 - If you really want me to do Burn Notice S04 and Royal Pains S02 first I will do them.
Sorry I did not mention them."
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-14T23:27Z,"@ everyone right now I am encoding last nights Hung, Weeds, and Rizzoli and Isles."

,TwoLOUD,2010-09-14T23:46Z,This show blows....how is there a season 2....
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-15T01:15Z,"@ kombatrat - I will do malcolm in the middle, but it will take some time.  Also, about the software, it depends on a lot of things. It would be easier to answer your question if we could talk via instant messaging.    Please send me an email to this address   angelicdemon69@hotmail.co.uk      and then we can go from there.

@ TwoLOUD - Hey, I happen to like this show and among a lot of other shows. I watch a lot of tv shows and movies. I like a wide variety of shows. I dont watch alot of live tv though, cuz I dont like commercials. 

@ Anime91 - Do you have any suggestions? If so, please provide links. 

@ everyone - I am encoding last nights The Big C, and then I will encode The Sleeping Dictionary, Machete (Telesync), Downstream, Blood Surf, and a few other things. "
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-15T01:16Z,@ Anime91 - I would be glad to do just about anything as long as I can get it. (^_^)
