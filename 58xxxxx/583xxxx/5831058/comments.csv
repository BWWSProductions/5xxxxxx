,Pimbax,2010-09-15T03:59Z,"Im just gonna say this .

I downloaded and played this game .

And it sucks, complete sucks .

2 easy and boring .

Dont waste ur time downloading this game, even no the demo lol .

About the torrent, its a good torrent, but the game just sucks .

Sorry, but it is the true :\"
,shhash,2010-09-15T04:16Z,Its just a matter of time before seeds grow in number and download speeds will skyrocket. Hang on pirates. My speed is 90kb/s down and 140kb/s up. At least far better than direct download which stopped twice after completing 500 MB download.
[V],Mbb15,2010-09-15T10:19Z,"this game SUCKS, its exactly the same as pes2009 and pes2010 for pc, its such a stupid xbox port, this game is AWFUL"
,Firewolf5,2010-09-15T11:57Z,"hey again...

just to say, it is worth downloading this... cuz you can start getting used to the new play key style...besides, like pes 2010 demo... the real game was very different from the demo... same will happens to 2011 demo and 2011 real game.

besides... it seems the graphics are slightly better :)"
,Firewolf5,2010-09-15T13:40Z,"forgot to say... i love this new ""engine play style for pc"". More difficult to move around, pass correctly = more fun = more real game challenge.   ((dont forget many and many tricks arent available on the demo))"
,ronaldoo1,2010-09-15T14:18Z,"if you are not gay, you just get yourself a manly PS3 , en enjoy the wonderful demo there, not on faggoty-pc"
[V],Mbb15,2010-09-15T15:50Z,"ronaldoo1

,pesmaniac,2010-09-22T16:27Z,"@ronaldoo1
Fuck u"
,bloodred125,2010-09-25T03:10Z,"why would i get it for PS3? You do realise with the hi res's and graphics options are far superior to PS3? + its exactly the SAME port. Its a demo , no commentary and many things are NOT in the demo its just to wet the appetite NOT to play full game. PS3 is still only Dx9 adn PC's are up to Dx11 now. People that think Consols are better are insane."
,Luis344,2010-10-02T19:33Z,"nice upload ;) now downloading at 350 kb/s
