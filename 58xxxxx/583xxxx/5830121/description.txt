├óΓé¼╦£Greater Eastern├óΓé¼Γäó is the seventh route to be released by Making Tracks and extends upon our \"Great Eastern\" route from Ipswich through to Norwich. The route is depicted as it was at the turn of the millennium, with Anglia Railways &First Great Eastern  changing over to National Express\'s \"one\".

Greater Eastern includes many challenging activities to drive express intercity services using the Class 86/Mk2 Push Pull sets and the later Class 90/Mk3a sets including the new Mk3 DVT on long distance services from Ipswich and Norwich to London with various locomotive classes on the many freight services in the region. We have also included the Class 315, 321 & 360 \"Desiro\" units for use on the many local and outer suburban services.

\'Greater Eastern├óΓé¼Γäó is an extension to Great Eastern by Making Tracks and you will need to have Microsoft├é┬« Train Simulator & Great Eastern already installed. Due to the extremely high detail included in the route and rolling stock, it requires the MSTSbin patch to work.

The included activities represent realistic scenarios based on real-life traffic, so you will be able to undertake a number of entertaining and challenging opportunities to immerse yourself in railway operations.

Greater Eastern by Making Tracks is an extremely detailed product.
While every effort has been made to ensure it performs as well as possible, this level of detail comes at a \'cost\' in PC\'s power required to run it. PC\'s with a lower specification will be more sucessful in running this product if they have MSTSbin installed which improves the memory management within MSTS.
