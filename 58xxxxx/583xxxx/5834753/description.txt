                    Hounded.                                 
                    Drama series. When a teenage girl is found  
                    dead, the police cannot be sure a crime was  
                    committed. But the girl's mother is convinced  
                    that her daughter was raped, and further  
                    investigation uncovers a murder weapon and a  
                    possible suspect. Senior crown prosecutor James  
                    Steel remembers this particular suspect well -  
                    and he is positive the man is guilty. Steel  
                    pursues him with every power available to him,  
                    pushing the law to its limit. Is Steel's  
                    instinct correct or is he persecuting an  
                    innocent man?
