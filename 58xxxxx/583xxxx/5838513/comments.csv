I tried downloading this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5414793/Zumba_the_complete_package_3xDVD5_Retail_DD5.1[NLUPPER]

I created a VIDEO_TS folder, moved the files from a DVD into that, and created a disk image of it using Disk Utility, I then burnt it to a DVD which plays in my computer (and is recognized as a DVD), but in DVD players it just says error, and/or ejects it.

How do I make it work? What did I do wrong?

Will this work?"
