There are other methods with other devices or you can buy a designated board for it. Since it has to be plugged in the entire time to use the jailbreak.
Google PSGROOVE for more info."

,norberg18,2010-09-17T22:22Z,hey gamerguuy. thx 4 the torrent! is it possible to install PS3 FTP Server with this?
[T],gamerguuy,2010-09-17T22:37Z,"I am sorry but there are no such files.The only way you can do it is by the calculator,phones,etc.There is no way to do it by just using a usb only.The usb that you see in the video of jailbreaking are not some normal usbs,they are custom built usb only for jailbreaking ps3 and even if you copy the files from that usb to a normal usb it will not work either.SO better buy the calculator or the usb from p,s,j,a,i,l,b,r,e,a,k.,com(remove,)"
,dark-ways10,2010-09-17T23:43Z,ok thx for a great torrent anyway but some people said if u have the files of the ps3 jailbreak and u copy them to a normal usb it will work so that is why I am asking u thx

@lorikano its possible, search for PS3 FTP Server on google, then you can transfer files over 4gb. or you can buy a docking station for the hdd, its NOT able to transfer files over 4gb, but easier to handle (like an external hdd)."

If you already have a Android phone (from the supported list) you can just download the PSFREEDOM zip file, flash it via Recovery Menu from the Phone, and boot the PS3 into DEV mode."

1) I've pulled the stream cabel out of my ps3
2) i started ps3jb on my calculator
3) i pressed 1 (on the calculator)
4) i've connected my calculator to my ps3
5) than i pressed eject QUICKLY
6) MY ps3 ( cooling) made lots of noise
7) nothing show up on my calculator, so i've pulled out the stream cabel and put it in directly after
8) on my calculator: working...
9) after 1 HOUR waiting my calculator turned off (i didn't read working...done)
but however i check my ps3 and i don't see any new options under ""game"" section in my ps3

My ps3 is 10 days old
My calculator got the newest software"
