1959 was a good year for Latin jazz when jazz lovers, coming to the second Montery Jazz Festival, attended a pre-concert in nearby Carmel and discovered Cal Tjader, who had been in the comparative backwater of the West coast playing and recording jazz tunes with a Latin rhythm section. That night, listeners heard Willie Bobo on timbales and drum set and Mongo Santamaria on bongos and other percussion. They found Paul Horn on flute and also saxophone, Lonnie Hewitt on piano, and Al McKibbon on bass, while Tjader mellowed the timbre with his vibes. Only a few tunes had an up-tempo, vigorous Afro-Cuban feel; straight ahead ballads, such as Laura and We'll Be Together Again, and mainstream grooves, original or neo-standards, such as Walkin' with Wally and 'Round Midnight, were well represented. After all, this was a mixed, mainly mainstream audience, and there was something for everyone. This 78-minute live album, consisting of tracks from the two original LPs, sound great. That is good engineering, both at the time and with mastering afterwards. The album, in short, is historic and brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable. I particularly liked the Latin pieces, Tu Crees Que, for instance. ~ Dr. Debra Jan Bibel
