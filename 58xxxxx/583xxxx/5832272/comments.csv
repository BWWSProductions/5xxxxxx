,twiX.swe,2010-09-15T17:14Z,"I don't understand. What's the ""Content\0000000000000000\45418933\00080000\
"" thing?
Should I ignore it, and just burn the game or what?"
,AlexHSH,2010-09-15T17:21Z,"Path in torrent is wrong! 

Correctly path is:
Content\0000000000000000\45418933\00080000 
(16 zeros, not 12)

Sorry. "

,NADER0AZ,2010-09-18T21:22Z,i cant burn it plz anyone help.........???
,NADER0AZ,2010-09-18T21:26Z,theres a problem when i close the tray its said mixed...anyone help
,twiX.swe,2010-09-19T17:54Z,"@NADER0AZ;
It says Mixed Media because it's a Wave 6 game, and you most probably have a flashed xbox 360 which only runs games up to Wave 4 or 3. 
Therefore, you need the Activate ISO cd, and burn it to a Dual Layer disc and put it in to the Xbox 360 before you put in the Fifa 11 Demo dvd. "
,twiX.swe,2010-09-19T21:50Z,"Grr. I did it all successfully, until I pressed play game, and it says:
""Disc can't be read.
1. Clean the disc.
2. Restart console""

What should I do to avoid this message?"
,twiX.swe,2010-09-19T21:55Z,"Can someone please help?
I did everything exactly as I should. But when I press Play Game on the console, an error appears saying:

""The disc could not be read.
1. Clean the disc.
2. Restart the console.
""

I'm doing the Xtaf thing. Don't know why it doesn't work."
