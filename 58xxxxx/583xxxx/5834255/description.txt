       "Suspicious Minds" is a song written by Mark James aka Francis Zambon in 1968. It is a song about being trapped in a mistrusting and dysfunctional relationship. Originally, and most notably, a hit for Elvis Presley in 1969, "Suspicious Minds" was widely regarded as the single that jump-started Presley's career after his successful '68 Comeback Special. It was his eighteenth and last number-one single in the United States. Rolling Stone later ranked it #91 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 1986, the band Fine Young Cannibals' cover version of the song, which featured backing vocals by Jimmy Somerville, reached #8 on the UK Singles chart.
       "She Drives Me Crazy" is a song recorded by the Fine Young Cannibals, included on their 1989 album "The Raw and the Cooked". The song peaked at #5 in the band's native UK in January 1989 before hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on April 15, 1989. It also made number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. A remixed version was released in 1997.
       " Good Thing" is a song recorded by Fine Young Cannibals, the second single pulled from their album "The Raw & the Cooked". The song was their second U.S. number one, topping the Billboard Hot 100 on July 8, 1989. It also peaked at #7 on the UK singles chart.The song made its first appearance in the 1987 film "Tin Men". Fine Young Cannibals portrayed a nightclub band in the movie, performing this song and three others (including the single's b-side "Social Security"). The film is set in Baltimore in 1963, and the song's retro-soul style is consistent with that setting.
       "Don't Look Back" is a song by Fine Young Cannibals. It was released as the third single from the band's 1989 album "The Raw and the Cooked".
