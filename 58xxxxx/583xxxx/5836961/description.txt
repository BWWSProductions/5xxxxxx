WARNING: THIS MOVIE CONTAINS ONE OF THE MOST BRUTALLY GRAPHIC SCENES EVER DEPICTED ON FILM. On September 12, 1994, in the rural town of Smith Haven, Washington, a call was placed to 9-1-1. When police arrived at the scene of the crime, what they discovered was in fact the most horrific and disturbing crime they had ever encountered. The town sheriffs son had brutally beaten his mother to deathâ€¦it was all captured on home video. Now, thirteen years later, we invite you to bear witness to this deranged young man with a dark secret as he is transferred from the Yellow Glen Rehabilitation Center to a maximum-security facility.
