,phr3akin,2010-09-19T18:17Z,"If you want to play it in NO$GBA there's a fix, add this code in Cheats, select Action Replay DS and in RAW mode.

Tested and worked for me."
,fakebest,2010-09-19T20:28Z,why is there so much useless characters in the description making the page very long.
,TwisTtheTwiTcH,2010-09-19T22:36Z,"Works on M3i Zero

,phr3akin,2010-09-20T00:41Z,"Because I pasted the NFO from BAHAMUT for both games, didn't realize it will look so bad, now I cant edit the info, sorry."
,woopie1,2010-09-20T15:02Z,i tried adding that code to NO$GBA but it didnt work :( it stays frozen the bottom screen is white and the top screen has some random Japanese words..help please?
,franksaysblah1,2010-09-22T02:36Z,"Both starts fine on desmume, but when i start a new game it freezes, im new to desmume, any help would be appreciated? thanks"
,jhandberu,2010-09-23T11:13Z,"Worked for me on No$GBA after adding that cheat. Thanks a ton phr3akin.

@woopie1,
You have to double-click the icon that appears in the cheats window after you enter the code and press OK. There should be a check mark beside the icon for it to work"
,jhandberu,2010-09-23T11:31Z,"Wait, scratch that. It only works till the main menu. When I select any of the top two options, the screens go black and nothing happens. The third option (wi-fi) does lead to a screen, but why would I want that on an emulator... The fourth one has a picture of Jigglypuff with some text and what I'm assuming is a reset button. So anyway, the game's not starting. Any help?"
,omgrobotz,2010-10-02T10:35Z,Black and white both work like a charm on Acekard 2i + AKAIO 1.7.1! Patches perfectly too. Thanks uploader~
,omgrobotz,2010-10-02T10:38Z,"@ jhandberu

Try using the latest version of Nocash? Btw, top two menu options are ""New Game"" and ""Mystery Gift"" respectively.. last option is ""Mic test"""
,crawfish10,2010-10-04T13:00Z,doesnt work on acekard 2i with update
,lukelovesfootball,2010-10-17T00:07Z,"Hey, i got it to work, but its in japanees. is there a patch anywere or a fully english version?"
