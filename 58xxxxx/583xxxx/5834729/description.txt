This collection from the very talented Kerry Ellis is worth every penny. Fans of both her and Brian May of Queen will be left delighted. The range of her vocal is outstanding, and the tracks on here leave you with a satisfied feeling once complete. Stand out songs (though all are good) are the opening 'Dangerland' the smooth 'I'm not that girl' and the rock chick version of 'Love it when you Call'. Queen's 'Save Me is delivered beautifully.
Kerry and Brian compliment each other very well. It should be noted that Roger Taylor of Queen contributes on drums on one track as does his son Rufus Taylor, again on drums, on several others. I totally recommend this album to you, plus it was a great bonus to have pre ordered and obtained a signed copy !!. Love it.
