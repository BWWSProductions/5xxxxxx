The Grand Design is a popular-science book written by physicists Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow and published by Bantam Books in 2010. It argues that invoking God is not necessary to explain the origins of the universe, and that the Big Bang is a consequence of the laws of physics alone. 

The authors of the book point out that a Unified Field Theory may not exist. Albert Einstein and other physicists had proposed such a theory based on an early model of the universe containing three-dimensions and time. Since then, significantly changed models of the universe have been suggested. Many physicists now believe that the universe has 10, or even 11 (M-Theory) dimensions.
