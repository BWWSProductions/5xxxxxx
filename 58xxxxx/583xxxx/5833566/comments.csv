google and search for ""vlc player"" once installed open the movie and sub will automatically display along with it."

,alterfurz,2011-01-03T21:42Z,To get subtitles to work rename Heartbreaker.2010.FRENCH.DVDRip.XviD-AYMO.txt to Heartbreaker.2010.FRENCH.DVDRip.XviD-AYMO.srt

but BEWARE! the sub. is incorrect (i know french) it does not translate everything! I recommend another one"
,tybomb,2011-03-06T00:28Z,"  The subs are useless. If you need the English subs to watch this movie then don't bother because whoever translated this sure as hell isn't bilingual.

  If you took subs from a differen't movie and put them in this movie it would be an improvement over whats there.  At least they would make sense independant of the movie."

Subtitles: 3

The subtitles are just comprehensible enough to be able to follow the story, but add a whole new level of comedy to this pretty good French rom com. Some really nutball translations in the subs had us in hysterics."
,anichani,2012-01-14T10:37Z,Does anyone have the movie in ENGLISH please?
