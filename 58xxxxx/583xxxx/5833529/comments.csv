,SebMeb,2011-05-13T23:31Z,it's a terrible program anyway. burning always end up having mixed results. chances are 3/10 would fail. go for Roxio Creator 2011 Pro instead.
,SebMeb,2011-05-13T23:33Z,"this software has compatibility issues anyway, burning results in 3/10 becoming coasters. Go for Roxio Creator 2011 - compatible with many different drives and hasn't failed 10/10 so far. :)
