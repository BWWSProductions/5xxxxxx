,CherryDaisy1990,2010-10-19T21:21Z,Zou je het bestand eens na willen kijken?? Bij mij zat er na de download geen video of audio ts bestand in het winrar mapje
,sub-seven,2010-11-10T08:57Z,"This is legit and it works, but you need to burn it with imgburn, or if you want to extract the mt2s file you need to download virtualclonedrive and mount it. WinRAR cannot read this file, that is why it's blank."
,sigenapipol,2010-11-19T20:59Z,i cant get this to work..i mounted it on virtual clone drive and it gives an error that the file is corrupted..please help
,admireme,2011-03-13T20:03Z,"Guys, I can't get this to work either, and I'm no noob...
Has any one actually managed it ?"
,mak_2137,2011-05-11T13:32Z,"Hi!! I have downloaded this file but I have no access to the file. I have tried mounting with all the Image Mounters but I am unable to read this .iso with mds file. Please help. Its says the file is corrupt or the file system is not recognized by Windows. I just want to mount and play the movie, don't want to burn it. Please reply."
,throwing_wheel,2011-05-13T02:56Z,"The latest version of PowerISO, 4.7, successfully extracted the contents."

,phusg,2011-08-17T23:50Z,"Latest Daemon Tools can't extract the contents of the iso which my MPC-HC can't play. Winrar 4.01 can extract the .mt2s which I can now play.

Thanks!"
,dafiber,2011-10-28T23:53Z,Tried several players including XBMC (which plays ISO files without any problem) but this files seems to be corrupt. Anyone got a good version with dutch/english language?
