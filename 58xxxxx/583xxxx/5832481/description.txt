Josh Grenier aka Bmoney Grenier (Google Him) is a rising artist who loves the sounds of hip hop/r&b. He has produced for many other artists over the years, his homemade beatz and mixing and catchy hooks and lyrical verses have "Wowed" other artists and executives in the studio. Lyrically creative which helps his beatz jump off the stages! Started off in Toronto towards our very own E-town and now has created a buzz in the Vancouver hip hop scene. The future is bright for Bmoney. This is the year I believe he really has found his studio perfection.
