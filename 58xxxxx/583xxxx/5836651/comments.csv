i'm very sorry but this is my last upload
of coast to coast my account is just expired.
I would be very grateful if somebody replaced me for upload,the awakening movement of people must continue."
,bravos2u,2010-09-18T16:55Z,"Lyrian, Just read Your comment.

I can pay You $15 via PayPal now, which would be half of the 6 month subscription. 

Would that be okay ?

If that will not work, I can pay the $30 within the next few weeks.

I agree with You, it's very important for there to be a global awakening to create a ""tipping point"" of awareness. For FAR too long people around the globe have been kept in various degrees of ""darkness"".

This is my email address  jameskrasnow@Gmail.com  Just put from ""Lyrian on TPB"" in the subject area. I'm in the USA.

Let me know either way...  AND.....Thank You Lyrian for everything You've done here on TPB for everyone here.

,mkmacabre,2010-09-24T23:59Z,"Lyrian, thanks for everything so far!!!

Bravos2u, good call mate!

I would do this myself, but the usual money and time thing keeps cropping up, hope you two can work this out anyways as i am not too keen on downloading from the anonymous!"
,SerSpec-V,2010-10-03T17:37Z,Please someone else upload C2C or post links to other sites that enable you to DL it. I'm one of the mass unemployed and can't afford to pay for it. 
,SerSpec-V,2010-10-03T23:13Z,I tried to download from ConCen but it only let me download 1 show and my bitcomet won't connect to DL any other shows so I don't know what's happening there? That's why I ask for alternative sites.
,nIx76,2010-10-17T11:49Z,"Lyrian, Would it be possible to include the name of the host in the title of the torrent?

Thank you and have a good day."

Ive never done this before but I think I did it right. I started with the 10-18-2010 show but its not at the top of the coast to coast am search. I found it under recent uploads section so I know it uploaded. Anyone know how to get it to the top of a coast coast am search?
