General Information
-------------------------

Release Name.........: The.Kennedy.Assassination.24.Hours.After.720p.HDTV.DD2.0.MPEG2
Air Date.............: October 18, 2009
Documentary Name.....: The Kennedy Assassination: 24 Hours After
Episode Synopsis.....: In 2009, 46 years after he was shot, JFK will be gone
                     for as long as he was alive. While the moments and hours
                     after his tragic assassination were some of the most
                     formative and important for our country, that story has
                     rarely, and only partially, been told. For the first
                     time, using never-before-seen transcripts only recently
                     made public, this film pieces together the 24-hour period
                     after the shots were fired. The timeline reveals startling
                     new information about the death of the president and the
                     traumatic transfer of power to his successor, Vice
                     President Lyndon B. Johnson. From new details about
                     when JFK really died, to the truth behind LBJ's Oath
                     of Office photo on Air Force One,  this special uncovers
                     an unfamiliar story born out of one of the most crucial
                     days in American history.
