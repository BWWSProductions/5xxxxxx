Poetry On Record: 98 Poets Read Their Work (1888-2006) is an engrossing 
collection  of poems read by the people who wrote them, from the dawn 
of sound recording to the current day. Over the course of four CDs and 
an info-packed book, it tells the story of the past 120 years of poetry 
in English, from Romanticism (Dylan Thomas) to Modernism (T.S. Eliot), 
from the Harlem Renaissance (Langston Hughes) to Black Arts (Amiri 
Baraka), from rhyme and meter (Alfred, Lord Tennyson) to free verse 
(Adrienne Rich), and beyond. Equally important, it allows listeners to 
understand exactly how the poets intended their poems to be read aloud. 
Poetry On Record is the most comprehensive collection of its kind and 
is a must-have for any fan of poetry, or for anyone who wants an 
expertly chosen overview as a starting point.
