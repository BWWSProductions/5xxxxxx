The art is simply breathtaking and varied. The main character Navis visits all kinds of worlds, from lush jungle to wasteland, from fantasy settings to steam punk and back to sci-fi. Every locale is drawn in extreme detail by Philippe Buchet.

I'd advise you to buy it if available. It's quite cheap and the art looks simply better on paper.
