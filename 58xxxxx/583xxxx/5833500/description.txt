This is a real-time and interactive version of "Pipe Dream", a music animation by Animusic. Its originally an ATI graphics demo to demonstrate the Radeon 9700s abilities, but it also works on NVidia cards (Geforce 5 and higher).


Additional Info & Tips:

This is a Tweaked version: It loads faster, runs in Developer Mode (more functions) and without the ATI and Animusic logos. Before you run the demo, change the resolution, multisampletype and quality by editing Sushi.ini
You can force the Aspect Ratio and the Refresh Rate by removing the slashes and modify the values. If you get an D3DAw Error, try to lower the multisample settings. 

Run without loading screen: Create a shortcut to PipeDream.exe and add this parameter: -noloading

Example: "PipeDream Directory\PipeDream.exe" -noloading
