Beatles: Up Close and Personal documents the history of the most celebrated rock band in history. In addition to archival footage of John, Paul, George, and Ringo, rock journalists discuss the band's formidable influence. ~ Perry Seibert, All Movie Guide 
This DVD takes you on a journey into the very hearts of the most successful and influent band of them all.


Through the Memories, Recollections and insights of those who knew the Beatles the best, the programme examines the creative processes and personal chemistry that contributed to some of the greatest music ever made. Among those who interviewed Pete Best, the groupâ€™s original drummer who was unceremoniously sacked in 1962 and Norman Smith, the bands sound engineer from 1962 to 1966.


This is your chance to get up close and personal with rockâ€™s greatest band; to discover how the band made the amazing step from â€˜love me doâ€™toâ€™Sgt Pepperâ€™ in just four years. The DVD also features superb rare footage of the Beatles in action in the concert and in the TV Studio.
