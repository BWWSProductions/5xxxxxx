,vector1818,2010-09-18T17:35Z,"Same here, what is wrong with imdb? This movie sucked! Val Kilmer was fucking boring! At some times of the movie, someone would ask him something and he would just sit there staring at the wall. What the fuck is that all about! This part was perfect for him to act insane and he totally destroyed it. Don't even bother downloading!"
