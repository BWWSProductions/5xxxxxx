Meat Loaf played at the NIght of the Proms during their 2001 tour through Belgium, Netherlands and Germany.
Night of the proms is an event where classical music and rock are brought together and what songs suit such a night better than Meat's Steinman songs.

This dvd has 6 great tracks starting with Bonnie Tyler singing Steinman's Total Eclipse from the Heart. After that Meat Loaf enters the stage and the show is on!

Because there never was a concert footage I made this myself. I collected all the songs Meat Performed and combined them in one concert. Hope you enjoy this dvd
