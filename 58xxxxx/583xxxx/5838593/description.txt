This eight-song album is a collaboration between the acclaimed rock icon and musician, songwriter, and producer Daniel Lanois, known for his work with U2, Bob Dylan, Peter Gabriel, Brian Eno, Emmylou Harris, Willie Nelson, The Neville Brothers and many others. 
'What's striking about 'Le Noise' is the way it both summarizes and distills Young's singular approach to music, predominantly just Neil and a guitar: his big, white hollow-body Gretsch electric slashing and burning for most of the tracks, a couple built around picked and strummed acoustic instruments. Both are recorded and amplified - literally and metaphorically - by Lanois' signature soundscapes that loop vocals, and enhance the guitars' bass notes through distortion boxes, synthesizers and other electronics.'
