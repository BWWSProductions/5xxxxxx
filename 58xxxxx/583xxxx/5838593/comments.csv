You are a fucking moron. 

This is the best shit he's done since Freedom. It may even be better than Ragged Glory as far as his all-out rock albums go. If you want something that's not like Neil Young at all you go listen to Transformer Man, and even that's Neil Young! Neil Young is whatever Neil Young is, always has been.

In the future, if you're not still a moron, you'll realize this."

While somewhat harsh, RallyTa has an absoltely correct point!

Neil Young is whatever he happens to be at the time and this album is VERY representative of Neil Young on two of his most major sonic tendencies namely acoustic and noise - the solo acoustic troubadour and the ax-wielding lead guitarist of Crazy Horse!

Le Noise combines both in a rather interesting conceptual method which seeks to meld both of Neil's main musical personalities into a third hybrid - the acoustic troubadour embellished by walls of self-generated noise and atmosphere sounding something akin to an acoustic troubadour and a one man band albeit guided by atmospheric sound wizard Daniel Lanois.

Not the relaxed listening of Harvest, or its revisitation; Harvest Moon nor the raging noise fest of Ragged Glory or Rust Never Sleeps but still interesting and unmistakably Neil Young!"
