,eldeladi,2010-09-30T04:51Z,"Actually this torrent works. you just have to transfer the content to your internal hard drive either by ftp or by using this new back up manager called open manager

,gramaxo,2010-12-11T19:38Z,you consola topo need the BLES..... YOU DONÂ´T HAVE THIS
,DS_Maol,2011-02-15T09:03Z,here you have: BLES00673
,DS_Maol,2011-02-15T09:11Z,"athoslifepub - > install the update file for the game first, then it works fine like hell."
,Sidewayys,2011-02-19T07:59Z,"Works great! Downloaded, used FTP server to transfer to internal, then ran using multiMAN. Said yes to update and works beautifully. Thanks for the up!"
,TommyZG,2011-02-20T21:42Z,"Thank you for the great upload, it works. I also used FTP and MultiMan as backup manager. It's not Spanish :-) the game language is English. Haven't tried the update option, still not sure will it mess anything up, but I'll try it tomorrow. Thanks again!"
,frozoman,2011-02-25T16:42Z,"I'll solve this once and for all. This is how I got it to work. There is probably other methods but I don't know about them. After you download, create a folder named 'BLES00673' and put all the downloaded files in there. Copy that BLES folder to a pendrive or external HDD formatted with FAT32. I have kmeaw 3.55 with Multiman 1.6 on my PS3. If you don't have that, update Multiman to its last version. Inside multiman, there is a thing called file browser. On the left side, open up you PS3 hdd and open a folder named GAMES (I think multiman creates this folder automatically). On the right side, open up you pendrive or external hdd with the analog stick, select the BLES... folder and hit 'O' it will prompt a copy message. Copy to the 'games' folder. Once that is done, go back to Multiman's main 'games' page and run Dirt 2. EXIT TO XMB IN ORDER TO PLAY. When prompted the update, say yes. (no it won't brick you PS3) After the update, the PS3 is probably going to say that there is corrupt data in the game files. Let it fix that and you will now be able to play. Hope I helped you guys. Been trying this for quite a while and this is how it worked for me."
,PS3Vortex,2012-01-06T04:47Z,Are you sure thats how you get the game to work? ?I have a ps3 version 3.55 with multiman version 2.9. Will this game work okay?
