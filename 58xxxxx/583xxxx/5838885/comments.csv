,pintokhan,2011-01-10T12:38Z,can someone please help us noobies and give a step-by-step process on how to put this on our jailbroken ps3?
,crila,2011-01-15T01:12Z,"@pintokhan
You download PS3 FTP Server, its a program for your PS3. It should be in .pkg format. You put it on a USB Stick formated in FAT32, you insert the USB STick in a USB Port of the PS3, you go to menu and install this Program. Then you start the program from PS3 menu and there will be a screen that will show your IP adress. Something like 192.168.1.5. I assume you have connected your PS3 ti internet. You write that number down, that IP that appears and you go to your computer. You download and install CuteFTP from a torrent, after installation you open the program and on the left  side up you insert that IP, you write at Port 21 and press Connect button. CuteFtp will connect to your PS3 and you will see the folders from your PS3 HDD. In the middle of the prgram there are two windows, the left one shows your PS folders and the right window show PS3 file. In the left window you browse to the game you want to upload (untill you see the folder like BLUS30264) and in the right window you go toÈ˜ dev_hdd0/game/LAUN12345/GAMEZ. In the folder GAMEZ you put the game from the left window. If in LAUN12345 there is no GAMEZ folder you create one in CuteFTP right-clicking in LAUN12345 folder and create new folder (like in windows). When you are in Gamez folder in the rigt window you right click in left window over the game name (ex: BLUS30264) and from the drop down menu choose Upload. And wait to trasfer the game. I hope you understand, if you don`t read on CuteFTP site, they have some sceenshots there). You have to let PS3 FTP Server running in PS3, in that window where it shows your IP while you transfer the file. When it`s over you can close both program."
,deadone111,2011-01-29T18:11Z,Need help.  Game stuck at square enix title screen.  What vids do I need to rename/ remove?  On 3.55 cfw.
,deadone111,2011-01-30T05:47Z,"Nvm, found out i needed to download a modified eboot and place the white_data under FF13GAME folder of the hard drive.  Works great."
,slayer_bro_29,2011-02-22T04:12Z,"guys, when im extracting it to my external HDD its says that it cannot paste more than 4 GB of size... i have to convert it into ntfs... but the ps3 only reads fat32 format... and it always stop extracting when it already extracted 23.7 GB.. somebody help me please...."
,sketch81,2011-03-29T11:09Z,"other than the fact that this torrent seemed to be missing half of the necessary files to actually run it (sfb, eboot, sfo files etc) once i got the 8mb that was missing from elsewhere this release works fine running from external on kmeaw 3.55 using multiman

remove the end credits (the 5gb video file) and the other 4.1gb is fine to copy - its actually just under the fat32 cut off but gets rounded up - can get 4,200,000 bytes or such on a fat32 drive, thanks anyway guys, may have just been an unraring issue with the missing files but game is working fine as we speak

,filipmolnar,2012-02-23T20:12Z,"Hi, I downloaded this torrent twice and it seems to me that some core files (EBOOT, sfo, sfb) are missing. Am I doing something wrong or is this torrent really corrupt? I am quite confused as some people wrote that it works great...
I am using CFW 3.55 and several managers (multiman 2.0 was mentioned I have that (or a newer version, I just updated)) and it is not even found, I think the EBOOT file would be needed for that, but as there is no eboot...

So my questions is:
Is this torrent corrupt? Do other people miss core files(there was one guy with a comment that he misses them too)? If so - could someone mail them to me?

Thanks!"

,gulfan143,2012-02-25T20:35Z,hi.. i have the same problem with Deja_pro. i am stuck now where the team got into the aircraft and the screen is just all black now.. can somebody help me with this... please....
,filipmolnar,2012-02-26T13:45Z,"How to make it work:
Download torrent. Extract torrent. Check if EBOOT, sfb and sfo file are present in their respective directories. There is one BIG file in the movie folder. Use Opensplit (free to DL) and plitt the BIG file. remove the BIG file from its directory (delete or whatever). Now move the whole MRTC0003 (or something like that) to your GAMES folder on your external drive. It should copy fine. Start with the latest multiman.

No errors up so far and I just got past the part where they escape from the crystal lake (did not want to write major spoilers - this is after a few of the boss fights)

Thank you very much thenoobish! Great upload!"
