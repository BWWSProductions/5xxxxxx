"Mallorca Scars is a one-man-band consisting of Lukas Thomasson, a 19 year
old guy from Lund, Sweden. The music is an alternative form of electro-pop
with emotion, some dark/light humour and uplifting beats.

The name "Mallorca Scars" is a fantasy about Mallorca - of being a kid on
charter with parents who leave you alone in the hotel room while they're out
partying ( "grisfestandes" ).
