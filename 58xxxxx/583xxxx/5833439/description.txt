SONOIO is a solo project of Alessandro Cortini (part of the Nine Inch Nails lineup from 2005 to 2008 and a member of Modwheelmood).
SONOIO, which comes from the italian phrase â€œsono ioâ€, which means â€œitâ€™s meâ€, consists of solely Alessandro Cortini.
It is the first time that Alessandro composes music all by himself, not in a band context.
