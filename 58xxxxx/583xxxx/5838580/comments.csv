,berklon,2010-09-18T17:48Z,Saw the sample of this release on the newsgroups.  Looks and sounds like a TS to me.

,QborT,2010-09-18T18:51Z,"Be warned, this is not an actual DvDRip it is merely a mislabled TC

It has been nuked for ghosting and no retail proof

Release was nuked: custom.pixel.shape_ghosting_provide.proof.of.retail"
,thadream101,2010-09-18T19:10Z,Thanks 4 the warning
,xults,2010-09-19T07:25Z,green skull ... goes toshow that they do not mean that much!
,EbilPhish,2010-09-19T16:58Z,"@xults: It's supposedly a scene release, so it's the scene that fucked up not the uploader. It's already all around the place."
,xults,2010-09-19T18:06Z,EbilPhish. fair comment. But are uploaders supposed to chech the validity of the uploads before releasing them ? I certainly would be banned on some other websites for this sort of conduct!
,QborT,2010-09-19T18:13Z,"xults You don't know what you are talking about, I suggest keeping comments to yourself until you learn that uploaders are not always the ripper."
,xults,2010-10-10T21:47Z,uploaders are not always the ripper.. good excuse for uploading mislabled movies... or not!
,xults,2010-10-10T23:22Z,and what the fuck have you uploade obort... fuck all.. so fuck off
