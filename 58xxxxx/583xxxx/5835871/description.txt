Season 8, Episode 6: Avatar

Dr. Lee and his team have modified one of the virtual reality chairs last seen in 

"The Gamekeeper" to host a combat simulation for training Stargate personnel. 

After claiming the simulation isn't realistic, Teal'c agrees to help the 

scientists refine it. Inside, he faces steadily mounting hazards. Worse, his own 

ego prevents him from leaving until the last Goa'uld is destroyed. Each time he 

dies in the scenario, the chair shocks him. Teal'c must find a way past the 

barriers of his own mind to escape before the virtual deaths sum to real fatality.

series of "incidents" since he took an apartment off-base and the Air Force is not 

pleased. Daniel Jackson attempts to explain why and how to keep a low profile, but 

Teal'c cannot help getting involved with a young woman whose boyfriend abuses her. 

In doing so he inadvertently plays into the hands of a mysterious group with 

access to Stargate knowledge...
