any chance you can seed Arlington Road?  Thanks in advance.  Great up!"
,zerosk8a,2010-09-19T08:49Z,"I apologize, but i cant seed that because its already off my hard drive. Sorry man.. "
,zerosk8a,2010-09-19T08:50Z,"Correction, i can because i remembered i didnt delete it yet, so yes, i will seed it 1 more time until there is 200% but then it is gone, so i hope you are downloading.."
,cwebstop,2010-09-20T03:47Z,Thanks zerosk8a. 20% so far. Thanks
,zerosk8a,2010-09-24T02:38Z,"I love how im at 220% seed ratio, and im still the only seed. Seriously people im trying to move on to the next one, so please seed after you download, at least give back 100% seed. It wont kill you, but if you dont seed i might. "
