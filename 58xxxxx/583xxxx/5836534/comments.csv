,puppyup,2010-12-31T04:29Z,"Noone wants the dubbed shit, except for cultureless people."
,erikjen1,2011-02-24T18:27Z,Thank you!!  Seeding.
,circlesofchange,2011-03-31T09:35Z,"Hey, this was originally written in SWEDISH!!! If you want the watered down hollywood version wait for that crap to come out and download it! Quit your bitching! awesome books, GREAT movies, whatever with the subtitles. Do Americans not know how to read anymore?!?!?"
,micky63,2011-04-03T02:50Z,"hey, got a question...not about the pointless bitching but in regards to the torrent.
  How is the quality of these titles?? just curious"
,poOison,2011-04-04T00:23Z,Just a fantastic film thanks for the insertion!!
,mikhv67,2011-05-31T04:36Z,why would anyone dub a movie when it has sub titles. Dubbed movies are for morons. 
,lurcheous,2011-08-27T09:36Z,Please can someone seed this 
,shifty420,2011-09-05T07:24Z,"wtf do u care how other people enjoy a movie. i read more than any of you, and i still prefer to have english dub, doesnt make me any less intelligent. i'd prefer to see whats happening on screen rather than constantly reading the dialogue. read the books if you want to read the story rather than watch it. "
,isaias61,2011-09-25T23:15Z,"it's a swedish movie and I read somebody wrote that they want subtitles for this german movie or whatever. Americans dont care to watch movies in their original language because they just dont care about other nationalities and are not even aware they exist, please forgive them, they are just ignorants!!

I cant stand watching dubbed movies, they take away the essence of the film. "
,mvewtcher,2011-09-27T07:49Z,"Can't get Dragon Tattoo or Kicked the Hornet to play back on any Media Player that I have, but the Played with Fire does. Normally don't have a problem with avi or dvd files. Anyone have any ideas? "
,metalyger,2011-12-25T07:12Z,I don't get why so many people are complaining about the first movie being dubbed. It's a good dub that sounds/looks natural. You can just as easily download the movie from another torrent and get the sequels on this one.
,majalogan,2011-12-27T22:09Z,"Could some-one please do a proper release of these EXCELLENT Stieg Larsson Millennium Trilogy movies ?

Thank you very much to all the people that have put them out so far, but there is no high quality proper release out yet, believe me, I've trawled through them all. What we need is:

- extended versions (movies approx 3 hours each rather than approx 2h30m)

- bluray 720p or, even better 1080p (not DVD rip!)

- original Swedish language, *with optional English subs* and *optional* English dubs for those who want it


The boxset has been out for months so I'm surprised no-one has released them yet from the US Blurays.
