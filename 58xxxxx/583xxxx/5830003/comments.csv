,Duper167,2010-10-22T18:50Z,Why are all of the songs cropped?  There's not a single full-length song in this download.  
,broblaster,2010-11-08T03:00Z,He thought it would be a good idea to cut off the ends of the songs to make it fade in and out. I think the Gorillaz have their own transitions in mind.
