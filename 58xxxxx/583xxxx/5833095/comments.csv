,wk87,2010-09-16T19:38Z,Hey. I got a white screen on my DS after testing out this rom. IM currently using  R4ultra. Can someone help me? thanks
,kreem,2010-09-16T20:22Z,@wk87 - is the white screen just when you try to use this rom or for every game you try (ie - has this rom screwed your ds?)
,rurik1967,2010-09-16T20:47Z,"Not sure why you get a white screen, game should load and work fine."
,porteztova,2010-09-17T07:15Z,i register just to let u know this version is working!!!! thanks rurik1967 for the share!! i've been waiting this for ages! thank you...

,wk87,2010-09-17T11:43Z,"@kreem.
Only this rom shows a white screen on my ds. Other games i had in my card work perfectly fine. Im currently using R4ultra that is using v1.55 kernel downloaded from R4ultra.com. It seems there are no longer any firmware updates since 2009. I also not sure why it shoes a white screen when i download the game. Can someone check for me?"

The game running fine now :)"
,jovillin,2010-09-20T01:26Z,Why is the file size huge?  It doesn't fit on my 4gb card even after ive deleted about 10 games.
,jovillin,2010-09-20T01:30Z,"Nevermind, I got it."
,jonathanfcpotter,2010-09-25T10:13Z,"The game works until i try and save, the next time i play the game i have to start again. Has anyone else experienced this issue?"
,jonathanfcpotter,2010-09-25T10:15Z,"This game works and saves, or at least until i turn the DS off and try and play the game again. I then have to start all over again. Has anyone else experienced this issue?"
,personofwonder,2010-09-26T20:04Z,"I tried it on AceKard RPG AKAIO 1.7.1, i was unable to save the game, neither on diablolic box.

More likely the problem of my firmware.

Just want to mention anyway."
,omgrobotz,2010-09-28T02:55Z,"Thank you uploader!

Confirmed working on Acekard 2i w/ AKAIO 1.7.1 firmware. "
,Dappleblood,2010-09-28T16:06Z,"- jonathanfcpotter

the problem probably is in your ds flashcard... not the game itself. try changing the filesize of the save file... that might work.

or better yet, buy the original game, that way, there will be more Layton games."
,mikeov41,2010-10-17T21:06Z,"this one works great on R4

,Brainsnack,2010-10-22T20:48Z,"Works perfectly on AceKard 2i with Akaio 1.8.0
