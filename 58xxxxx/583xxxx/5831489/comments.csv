,dearghoul,2010-10-11T11:31Z,"You're begging for trouble using anybody's keymaker. They're almost always full of virus nastiness. Too bad, cuz I love those groovy 8 bit tracks they always play!
Sorry, Stun, blue skull or not, I'm not gonna open a keymaker ever again...

This torrent
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5831489/OO.Defrag.Workstation.v14.0.177.Incl.Keymaker-CORE
has a single key in a text file which works perfectly. I even used a slightly fresher version directly off the O&O website and it worked fine.
I'd just put the info here, but it's rude to hijack his good work. Go get it! 
You want the pro version, not the workstation anyway."

,dearghoul,2010-10-11T13:10Z,"And thinking about it a bit more, why on earth would anyone even give you a keymaker when they can just use their own to make some keys and put them in a text for you. That's seriously dodgy and tells you they're probably up to no good."
