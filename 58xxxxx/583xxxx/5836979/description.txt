Icewind Dale Game Description:

In the northernmost reaches of the Forgotten Realms lies the frozen and untamed region known as Icewind Dale. Journey deep into the Spine of the World Mountains, a harsh and unforgiving territory teeming with fearsome and merciless beasts. There you must confront an ancient evil that threatens to unleash an unspeakable horror upon the face of Faerun.

Welcome to the Northern Faerun, where winter never ends. In this harsh realm of ice only a few tough survivors live, and nowadays even those hardy few find the conditions a tad tougher.

You and your party have just arrived at a small fishing village, where an expedition will soon begin to help a troubled nearby tree-village, Kuldahar.

In this hack-n-slash RPG you play a combat oriented Baldur's Gate -- the graphics, the system, and the interface are just the same. The only real difference between the two is there is a lot more enemies to kill and much fewer NPCs to talk to. Nevertheless the title, with the other Infinity Engine Games (Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment), marks a great age in RPG history.


Features:

* Battle Ice Trolls, Giants, and hordes of terrifying Undead. Over 70 types of new
  monsters (for a total of over 150) put your valor to the test in real-time 
  combat using the Badlur's Gate adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 
  game system.

* Adventure through a wide range of breathtaking environments and beautifully 
  rendered, scrolling terrain. Explore the region known as Icewind Dale, from 
  magnificent temples and ancient ruins, to volcanic cavers and icy plains.

* The Bioware Infinity Engine, the same engine used to create Baldur's Gate brings
  Icewind Dale to life with ynamic real-time lighting and weather effects,
  astounding combat, incredible spell effects, and visually rich Immersive 
  gameplay.

* Complete multiplayer support for up to six players over LAN or Internet 
  connections.

* Higher level character advancement and party based adventuring let you develop
  characters of formidable power and skills.


Heart of Winter Expansion-

Pick up after the conclusion of Icewind Dale, peace has returned to Icewind Dale. Or so it seems as there is a plot afoot by the northern Barbarians to attack the Ten Towns. It is up to you and your party to investigate and stop this plot.

This expansion on the original game is definitely along the same lines. The game focuses on epic battles and powerful magics, relying on the plot only to provide a background for the fighting and spell-casting. You can import your party from the original game and continue your adventure. Includes new weapons, armors, and enemies. Battles are now much more Baldur's Gate 2-sequel than in the original, relying heavily on strategy and spell-casting to combat very powerful enemies.



Icewind Dale 2 Description:

Just a generation after the events depicted in the first Icewind Dale, a new threat has appeared in the Northern region of Forgotten Realms. Something - or somebody - is trying to cut off the Ten Towns area from the rest of the world. Hordes of monsters invade peaceful towns and kill their citizens. You play as a party of adventurers who happen to be in the region, and upon their arrival they are requested to help to defend the town of Targos against monster invasion. But once they have accepted the quest, the adventurers realize it will only be the beginning of a long and perilous journey...

Icewind Dale II is a role-playing game that uses the Infinity Engine, first introduced in Baldur's Gate. Like its predecessor, it is more combat-oriented than Baldur's Gate games. The combat is a mixture of turn-based and real-time styles. In the beginning of the game, you create your entire party, up to six characters. Icewind Dale II uses the 3rd edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. There are new character classes (such as monk or sorcerer), new races (for example drow) and many new spells. The game features isometric pre-rendered backgrounds, like its predecessors.
