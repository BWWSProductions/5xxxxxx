,spencerdoken,2011-01-15T00:54Z,"It works great, until I finish the Prologue and try to go to the Shaengarne Ford.  At that point, it always freezes and crashes during the loading screen.  Anyone else experience this?"
,Domiengo,2011-01-24T23:15Z,"Hi, i downloaded this torrent, but when I run µthe AUTORUN.EXE and I click install, there comes something poppin up that says ""Setup is unable to find_SETUP.DLL, which is needed to complete the installation""
Error 103
What file am I missing, and where can i find that file?
I'm not experienced with downloading games.

[V],Big_dude,2011-01-27T05:53Z,"try mounting the image then run setup, just follow the included read me or read first in the download it should work, I only tested this on xp."
,urinfamousr,2011-03-01T06:31Z,for som reason when i install the patch for IWD and try to run it freezes. i tried installing it bit by bit from the main game to the patch the HOW and it seems as soon as i install the first patch v106 the game will no longer work. runing win7
,Mr_n_MrsDreadJonny,2011-03-04T15:21Z,thnx big dude always wanted to play these never had time b4. now let the fun begin :) !
,studvader,2011-04-03T19:51Z,"i downloaded everything and unzipped it to my desktop then i mounted icewinddale.iso using the program that was in the torrent and wallah... it opens up the boot screen so i click ""install direct X"" and it installs fine then i click the ""install button"" and it gives me the hourglass like its loading but then it just exits out and it does this every single time is there something im doing wrong?"
,Indoril,2011-04-25T10:49Z,Install doesn't seem to work under Win7 64. Seems to be a problem with the game rather then the torrent.
,Cyphist,2011-04-28T05:49Z,"Worked Great Using Daemon Tools. Nicely Packaged. If you have alot of lag during spellcasting ename the ""3D Support"" or whatever that is."
,Cyphist,2011-04-29T00:16Z,"*Enable, Sorry for that. And also wanted to add thanks to all the seeders out there!"

,Lumoboy,2011-05-28T05:41Z,"Downloaded at 2,5mb/s :) Nice seeds and AWESOME games, thx alot for this!"
,TheEvilCouncil,2011-06-01T07:33Z,"Great torrent, only problem was that there was no config.exe file. I assume everyone else has had this problem too? If anyone has found somewhere to download it or would be willing to upload, it would be much appreciated, thanks :)"
,xvanx,2011-06-09T06:16Z,im having the same problem as studvader where when i click english and install on the IWD1 it acts like its gonna load and then the setup never appears =/ any ideas on a fix? i would really love to play the 1st one b4 i do the 2nd 1
[V],Big_dude,2011-06-10T06:47Z,"Just mount the image with included daemon tools don't use the patch and install and play the game, from only that virtual drive letter. Keep the image mounted.

Try to enable winxp support I didn't test this on win7 or vista"
,Gaffler,2011-07-16T23:24Z,Any chance of there being more seeds for this torrent?  xD  Tnx.
,rob66699,2011-08-14T10:54Z,"Downloaded this twice, both times ""archive corrupt""
I get errors with 7zip and winrar when trying to unpack this :( the iso's contain no data.
I have never had a problem like this before and have DL'd lots of games from TPB
I am getting a version of this game from another source right now, just thought I should say something about my problems with this."
,SCTW,2011-08-23T20:33Z,"Thanks for a great torrent! It made my day.

Got both games to work on windows 7 64-bit. Some problems with Icewind Dale 1, disconnected from internet and turned of virusprotection (McAfee is whack) during install and the game is working fine so far. Icewind Dale 2, no problems on win 7 at all.

The no-cd patch gave me an error, so I didn't bother with that one. And expansions works fine.

So it works on windows 7. And once again, great torrent :) "
,AsmodiusMKII,2011-08-30T09:39Z,"I have been attempting to run Icewind dale and HOW mounted on the virtual clone iso with all patches installed in order, however i am always asked for the disk to be placed in drive E  (laptop cd drive) even though the images are mounted in drive F...its driving me crazy how do I get around this?? X_x"
[V],Big_dude,2011-09-02T06:51Z,Uninstall everything clean up all icewind dale even registry now mount the original image with your f: drive or virtual drive reinstall do your updates and keep the image mounted.  It should work.

,venillagorilla,2011-10-30T18:12Z,"Thanks Bigdude for the torrent! I love this game and i cant wait to start playing it again! 
IWD 2 installed flawlessly but im having trouble instaling IWD 1... 
When i try to run the Setup.exe it just doesnt show up. 
I have the image mounted on a virtual drive using Daemon Tools and IWD 2 installed just fine. 
Any ideas on what i should do?"
,venillagorilla,2011-10-30T18:13Z,Oh and i am also running on Windows 7 64bit
,picklator,2011-11-08T00:20Z,The readme says to mount Icewind dale.iso.  there is no such file.  There is an icewind.ICO. dont know if thats the same thing or not.  can anyone help?
,Krypt_Skiddie,2011-12-30T08:36Z,10/10. Great torrent. Even includes imageburn for you nubs out there.
,sjohasten,2012-01-25T21:48Z,Mitt spel stänger ner sig när jag ska skapa en online server. Någon som vet vad jag kan göra? prövade patch men funkade inte
,sjohasten,2012-01-25T21:50Z,"My game crashes when i create an online server. Anyone know how to fix this? tried patch, dident work"
,ontarah,2012-02-04T03:41Z,"Could you by chance just upload the CD cracks?  I have the game legit, but dumb errors basically render HoW disc unworkable.  From searching on Google this error is common, and the game has long since stopped being supported.  I have a full install so if I could just trick the computer to not reading the disc, it would be great."
,mazzer10,2012-02-13T14:59Z,"Thanks, I was missing Icewind Dale disk 1! "
,pwrplyr,2012-04-23T05:41Z,"i am on windows vista , game installed and works great however when i save the game it saves and when i goto load it it starts me back at the begining of the game.....any thoughts?.....thanks for the upload  big dude"
,elias7676,2012-05-06T21:44Z,"I'm having some trouble. i can install the icewind dale 1 and the HOW expansion, but after i install the 1.06 patch, it won't work.
