I can't yet decide whether some of the instrumental songs are essential to create the atmosphere that this album has or just filler and the french language doesn't suit very much  this kind of albums. Anyway, this record is amazing, it works brilliantly as a whole and I never get tired of it. Not my favourite Calexico but probably one of my year 2000's top albums
