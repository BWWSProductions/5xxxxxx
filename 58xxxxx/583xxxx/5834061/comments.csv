I'm Really Sorry That Installation Didn't Turn Out Like You Wanted It... Didn't Your Old Windows Files Be Put Inside Of A Folder Called ""Old Windows Files""? It Should Be Located In The Main Hard Drive ""C"" That's Usually The Default Drive Letter."

Naw, If Your Product Key Is For ""SP1"" Then It Won't Work For ""SP2"" :(

You Need A ""SP1"" Product Key For ""SP1""

You Need A ""SP2"" Product Key For ""SP2""

But You Need Too Use The ""Reccomended"" Activation Program That's Included In This Torrent Too Activate Windows :)"
