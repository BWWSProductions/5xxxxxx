I didn't laugh at any other film as much as at these three ;-) they make you pee in the pants, lol."

Use MPC   http://cccp-project.net/ to be able to automatically recognize & play
the external Audio tracks or mux the Audio in MKV with mkvmerge
http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix if you wish to use other player."
