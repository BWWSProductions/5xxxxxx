Be aware, the 720p version (with Russian Audio) is fake, upscaled from ordinary dvd. Also forced to 720p when normally should have been 691p (for 1280p) to keep the 1.85 AR.
I downloaded because I lov this movie, but realized it looked even worse then mine (less detailed, colder colors and with 384 KB/s English Audio which is hard to hear probably converted from 25 Frames to 23.976).
