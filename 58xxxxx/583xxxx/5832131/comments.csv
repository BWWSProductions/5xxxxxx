Unfortunately, the writter doesn't know a shit about cold weather & snow... a wolves pack in a ski center...lol ...and I don't think they would have stay sitting on a freezing bench... you would freeze from your ass in 20 minutes... why don't they use their googles, put their hoodie and zip their coat to protect from the cold? why would wolves attack just for the fun of killing something, and quit without touching their prey...anyway. The more the movie advance, the more you tell to yourslef, the movie last that long because they fully exploit the stupidity of the characters, that would have taken 10 minutes to go down & no broken legs for anyone having the ability to think.. Anyway, THanks for the upload & the prime quality of HDLITE!!! Audio: 10 Video:10"
