,ianken,2011-01-31T00:58Z,"This is the NTSC DVD, which is converted from PAL. The rip has not accounted for that and therefor has a glitch every second or so. Need to decimate by 6 after the inverse telecine. Then pitch correct the audio and change it's lenght.

Or, rip the PAL version to 25fps. Ya know, whichever is easier."
