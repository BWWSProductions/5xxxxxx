ScanSpyware v3.8

ScanSpyware is a typical spyware remover made by the same named company. It is a simple,
but quite effective on-demand scanner. The program does not use false positives. Our tests
revealed that ScanSpyware is able to correctly identify and eliminate common spyware and
adware infections.

The application checks the Windows registry, running processes, web browser cookies, local
files and folders. It allows running two system scan types - Quick Scan and Complete Scan.
The first one is the most effective. It usually takes 7-8 minutes to complete. Quick Scan
is a bit faster, but less thorough. ScanSpyware can also check separate user-defined disks
and directories. However, such custom scans usually take a long time. The program uses large
spyware definitions database updated on a regular basis. ScanSpyware does not have any additional
tools. Its only functions are scanning, Backup/Restore and Ignore List.

The program's interface is simple and user-friendly. However, it could be more convenient.

The free version refuses to remove any malware it finds and asks to register and purchase the
full product.

The official web site is www.scanspyware.net. Orders are made via reputable services using secure
connection.

In the middle of 2004, ScanSpyware's previous version was added to several corrupt anti-spyware
lists because of false positives and aggressive advertising. However, the situation has changed.
Recent ScanSpyware versions do not produce false positives, and the official web site does not
serve unsolicited advertisements anymore.
