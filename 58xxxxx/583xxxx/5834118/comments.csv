Do not make the mistake of using them, or help honnom to share this.
But if you just want to check and delete then it can work."
,B_wayne,2010-09-22T23:13Z,"Hey guy, no offense to the uploader (BoardinGG) but I generally do not download anything from this site that does not have one of the skulls next to their names because I am worried about viruses and shit like that. 
Can someone please confirm that BoardinGG's torrents are safe? I would love to download the missing WSOP episodes that I need but it seems like EZTV does not have all of them yet.
Help!"
