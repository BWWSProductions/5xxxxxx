Thanx"
,JH360,2010-09-17T10:11Z,"Well, it's the best one I've come across so far (it doesn't sound like the iPhone app rip), but there is so much clipping! :("
,TPB_helper,2010-09-23T23:13Z,Thank you :)
,phantom240,2010-09-26T19:40Z,"This album is absolute garbage. I wouldn't waste my bandwidth on it, to be totally honest. Serj's style doesn't lend itself well to softer music. If you liked ""Elect the Dead"", then prepare yourself for something completely different. 

I'll continue to seed for a few weeks. After that point, I'm deleting this pile of shit called an album. I have 1.5TB of space, and I wouldn't waste the 101.3mb of space this album takes up on that drive. it's that bad."
,Teslacoil33,2010-09-27T14:18Z,@phantom240: My god it is easy to be a critic. How about you try better?
,trebla44,2010-10-27T09:18Z,This is an imperfect harmony...thats why..lol@phantom240
,setxwageslave,2010-11-09T02:21Z,thank you xaiosheen for the up... @phantom: I suspect you do not play an instrument or understand the effort it takes to compose an album. what do you have to offer to the world? what do you know about armenia?
