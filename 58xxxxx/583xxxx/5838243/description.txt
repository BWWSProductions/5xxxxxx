Synopsis
The Shout is a 1978 film by Jerzy Skolimowski based on a short story by Robert Graves. It stars Alan Bates as a mysterious traveling musician in Devon who invades the lives of a young couple, played by Susannah York, and John Hurt. He has learned from an Aboriginal shaman how to produce a "terror shout" that can kill anyone who hears it unprotected. The North Devon coastline, specifically Saunton Sands and Braunton Burrows, was used for the bulk of the location shooting.
