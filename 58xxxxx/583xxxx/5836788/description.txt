Machete 2010 TS (Telesync) V2 

For those of you who do not know what a Telesync is here is the meaning of it - A telesync (TS) is a bootleg recording of a film recorded in a movie theater, often with a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth (but the video is often just cam video), with a direct connection to the sound source (often an FM microbroadcast[citation needed] provided for the hearing-impaired, or from a drive-in theater).

This has hardcoded English subs for the Non-English speaking parts, plus this is the full movie. So enjoy! And as soon as an R5, SCR, DVDSCR, BRRip, DVDRip, or a better Telesync is available I will encode it.

Here is a pic for subs -  http://img828.imageshack.us/img828/5121/vlcsnap2010091711h22m33.png/  

Notes from Source: Full Telesync - meaning there are no missing scenes. So enjoy!

Movie Nfo - The highly skilled Federale Machete is hired by some unsavory types to assassinate a senator. But just as he\'s about to take the shot, he notices someone aiming at him and realizes he\'s been set up. He barely survives the sniper\'s bullet, and is soon out for revenge on his former employers, with the reluctant assistance of his old friend Cheech Marin, who has become a priest and taken a vow of nonviolence. If you hire him to take out the bad guys, make sure the bad guys aren\'t you!

Three years ago in Mexico, determined Federale Machete is betrayed and set-up by his boss, resulting in his wife and child being murdered by drug kingpin Torrez. Now, in Texas, Machete resurfaces when hired to assassinate Senator McLaughlin, an extreme advocate against illegal immigration. Once again betrayed and set-up, Machete plots his revenge against the men who\'ve wronged him with the help of resistance fighter Luz, ICE Agent Sartana, and the shotgun-toting Padre.
