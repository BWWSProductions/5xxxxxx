This here is the Billboard top 100 for the year 2000.  This is from the actual end of year charts.  All of the songs are unedited, unless that's the only way they're available.  All of the songs are in MPEG4 (AAC) format and ripped by me personally.  The exception being I Don't Wanna by Aaliyah.  I was forced to download this song because it is only available on the Romeo Must Die soundtrack.  If anyone has the actual disc let me know I would love a copy of it.  I hope you enjoy, as this has taken me a couple weeks to compile.  Here is the track listing.
