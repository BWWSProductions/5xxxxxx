Group News

Six Years in the driver's seat, and we're still
alive and strong. We now  look  back  upon  six
consecutive years of nonstop action, as we have
given the mp3 scene access to some  of the best
rock and metal bands our universe offers.
Join us in a toast, and wish us luck and stabi-
lity for the next six years of musical adven-
tures. As always, we buy the music we like and
we expect you to do the same!
