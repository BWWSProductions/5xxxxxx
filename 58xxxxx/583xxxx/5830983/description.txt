From the Back Cover

You are what you think...

Everything you do in life is determined by the quality of your thinking. If you aren't thinking clearly, you're at the mercy of everyone else-from dishonest politicians
 to aggressive, stop-at-nothing ad agencies. Unfortunately, many people never give any thought to how they think. No wonder they're susceptible to the frustration, pain,
 ineffectiveness, and financial loss that result directly from poorly considered thinking.

Critical Thinking is about becoming a better thinker in every aspect of your lifeâ€”as a professional, as a consumer, citizen, friend, parent, and even as a lover. Drs. 
Richard W. Paul and Linda Elder, leaders of the Center for Critical Thinking, identify the core skills of effective thinking, then help you analyze your own thought
 processes so you can identify your weaknesses and overcome them.

As you learn how to think more effectively, you'll empower yourself as never before, discovering new opportunities, avoiding disastrous mistakes, and gaining new 
clarity throughout your entire life.
