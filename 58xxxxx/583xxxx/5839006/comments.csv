,KYJellyFish,2010-10-04T01:56Z,Why are people so persistant in giving thier opinions on these movies on this site. I think most of are interested in Vidoe and Audio quality nothing more. Also just look at the picture you know its not going to be great...

,Subjazz,2010-11-08T06:08Z,"Someone should go out and kill the writers / producer and the sad case that directed this piece of crap. Universal studios is either desperate, pathetic or just planning to deflate the American dollar because they are going bankrupt. This movie is not even worth the film it was recorded with."
,WEBLEYYYY,2010-12-17T21:53Z,"Is this worse than Adventureland? If so, it will be the shittest movie ever made in my books"
