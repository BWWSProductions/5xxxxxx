Maria McKee's voice--equal parts Dolly and Aretha--had frequently been great, one song at a time, but it wasn't until You Gotta Sin that this former Lone Justice singer was perfect start to finish. McKee's best batch of songs ever are complimented here by the twisted guitar of Jayhawk Gary Louris, which matches McKee, scream for scream, especially on the closing title track where Maria sends packing the guy she's been chasing all along. She's all over the place--"I'm Gonna Soothe You" is soul, "Only Once" honky-tonk, "I Can't Make It Alone" hard-edged pop--but it all works because McKee has finally reconciled her spirituality with her need for the sensual, over-the-top anthem. --David Cantwell
