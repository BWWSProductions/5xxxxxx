,omarooof,2010-09-29T01:58Z,"HOW TO ACTIVATE UPTODATE 18.2 ON PC

1. INSTALL USING A BOGUS FIRST & LAST NAME AND A PRODUCT ID FROM 2 CAPITAL LETTERS AND 5 DIFFERENT NUMBERS FROM 0 THROUGH 9. EX:HK23754
2. CLOSE UPTODATE
3. GO TO c:\INSTALL FOLDER\UpToDate\app\ AND EDIT param.xml USING NOTEPAD OR WORDPAD. BACKUP ALL THE FILES FROM APP FOLDER BEFORE YOU PROCEED!
4. REPLACE THE LAST DIGIT OF YOUR INSTALLATION CODE WITH A DIFFERENT DIGIT. SO IF YOUR INSTALLATION CODE WAS HK23754, REPLACE 4, WITH A DIFFERENT DIGIT FROM 0 THROUGH 9. LET S SAY 8. SO THE CODE WILL BECOME HK23758
5. WHEN UPTODATE 18.2 OPENS PRESS THE ACTIVATE BUTTON UNTIL IT WILL SAY IT S ACTIVATED . YOU WILL PROBABLY NEED TO TRY STEP 4 SEVERAL TIMES UNTIL YOU RE SUCCESSFUL."
