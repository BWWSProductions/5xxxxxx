Synopsis:

Get ready to kick some serious past with the wildly inappropriate UNRATED version of HOT TUB TIME MACHINE. The outrageous laughs bubble up when four friends share a crazy night of drinking in a ski resort hot tub, only to wake up with serious hangovers in 1986 â€“ back when girls wore leg warmers, guys watched â€œRed Dawnâ€ and Michael Jackson was black! Now, nice-guy Adam (John Cusack), party animal Lou (Rob Corddry), married man Nick (Craig Robinson) and mega-nerd Jacob (Clark Duke) must relive a wild night of sex, drugs and rock-n-roll and try to change their future â€“ forever!
