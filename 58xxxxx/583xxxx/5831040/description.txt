                    Acclaimed filmmaker Shane Meadows makes his  
                    televisual debut with the much-anticipated  
                    follow-up to his BAFTA award-winning film, This  
                    Is England. The dawn chorus has nothing on a  
                    bunch of pissed-up mates on stolen golf buggies  
                    serenading old pal Shaun. He's now back in the  
                    fold, but the gang has some issues... Gadget  
                    loves Kelly, but she doesn't love him. Woody  
                    and Milky love Lol, but she isn't sure who she  
                    loves. Things come to a head when Lol goes back  
                    home to find her dad Mick has returned to the  
                    bosom of his family. Shaun, on the other hand,  
                    is having a great time; the World Cup is  
                    hotting up, he has friends and a new job in the  
                    VHS industry. However, his mum is shagging his  
                    new boss Sandhu, so he's not too happy about  
                    that! And Gadget gets a surprise when he meets  
                    Trudy's son Winston.
