Ripped into speex format. All tracks from the original audio CDs are retained. An xspf (XML Shareable Playlist Format) playlist is included with all tracks in order.

Speex is a free and open audio codec specifically designed for the human voice. Because its purpose is so specific, it can compress its lossy audio very well while retaining a pleasant quality for human voice. Speex will play in VLC and other players, even more with plugins.
