New World Dis-Info: The Machinations of Myth & Meme in Modern Media

Everett Tucker of Mystic Politics returns to the show to discuss how our conception of the modern (and ancient) power structure is formed by the same lineages of pharaohs and god-men of old, garbed in a 1850-year-old disguise of Christianity. We will explore the religious, royal, and political prowess of the church, through tentacles & off-shoots such as The John Birch Society (JBS), The Council For National Policy (CNP), The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), The Tavistock Institute, and the largest weapon in their arsenal, what Tsarion would describe as the Subversive use of Sacred Symbolism in modern Media (read- Medes). We will also question whether there are divisions within the power structure and what possible â€œnew worldsâ€ await us. Are the left wing and right wing of competing? We discuss how disinformation agents are used to attract newly â€œawakenedâ€ people and perpetuate misconceptions and division. With an emphasis on education & sober research, we hope this will change the way in which you allow others to shape your perception.
