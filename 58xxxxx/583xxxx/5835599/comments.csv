You deserve a ""Rainbow Skull"" for these. I was going to make a request but I forgot when I read this list.
Keep rocking
Thanks
P.S. - Please keep the quality. Three colors trilogy was a little bit disappointment. But still many thanks."

,tofushoyu,2010-10-15T17:42Z,Thanks a lot!
,puppyup,2010-11-03T20:51Z,This rip is fucked. Sound is cut off after 01:32:13 although there are still scenes before and during the end credits.
,cheaterxs,2010-12-13T13:18Z,AAC will sound good with 64kbps. Increasing it will lead to a bigger sized file..However 128 kbps is nominal for Mp3. Thanks for the up.
,frogshare,2011-06-16T13:23Z,"Total rubbish. Sound is cut off at the end, therefore missing for the bonus scenes during the end credits. Also, 650MB simply doesn't give a proper quality for that resolution. Don't bother to download."
,pacana,2012-04-29T15:02Z,Thanks! the video was pretty clear but the near of epilogue and the credits turned out mute.
