,sioux104,2011-07-23T15:31Z,"Well, well... Second comment from this little girl in under an hour,; on different torrents and after they finished and installed without problems...
(that's my polite way of saying there souldn't be any complaints about low seed counts... I'm running at my dl max rate of 750Kb/s)

I'm on quite a streak with your torrents, cfreakdog... and hoping it will just go on and on. *smiles*

(BTW... I gave you the wrong xfire nick before... try arcti-gurl instead.)
