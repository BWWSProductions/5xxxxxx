[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-19T02:57Z,"@ TwoLOUD - Finally some positive feedback from you. Just kidding. (^_^) Thanks for the nice comment. I like when people comment about a movie or show or whatever, that I can get a feel for that persons personal preferences, so then I know what people like and I then can recommend stuff to them. Like penquin1-1 likes a lot of tv shows that I like. htctouch likes pretty much most of the stuff that I like. 

Thank you once again for the nice and positive comment.


@ Everyone - I am currently working on a few Music Video packs 2 of which are Lil Wayne and Nickelback and a few movies and tv shows.  I will upload 1 of the music video packs and see what people think and people like it I will upload some more. So if anyone wants a music video pack of a certain artist or band, just leave a comment or send me an email. (^_^) "
