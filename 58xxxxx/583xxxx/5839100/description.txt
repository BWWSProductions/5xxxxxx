I recommend that everyone watch this movie, cuz its funny!  I think that I have probably watched it probably 30 times since it came out in 2001 and it still makes me laugh. 

Also, I think that I still have a VHS copy of this in a box somewhere. LOL! (^_^)

I am doing my best to fill everyones requests, and in the meantime, I am trying expose everyone to my personal taste in tv-shows, movies, and porn. lol.
