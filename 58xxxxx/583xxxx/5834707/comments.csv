,daftracket,2010-11-21T04:44Z,"yup basically made an account just to comment this. absolutely no audio. no fixes i can find. wont play audio in media player, final media player, or quicktime pro. video is a 10/10 though."
,daftracket,2010-11-21T04:46Z,"erm scratch the quicktime one. it wont even play in quicktime. ""bad movie atom found"" error. no clue. maybe its just me, though. thanks anyway. will seed for a couple days."
,SellSoultheMachine,2011-02-15T08:01Z,"about that movie atom thing.. download a program called handbrake and convert it. it takes awhile to do it (about an hour or a lil bit more) but it makes it work with crystal clear quality..

PB rocks!! kickass!!!"
