Description:
Judge Dredd is back. The comic book character who acts as judge, jury, and executioner makes another video game appearance in a first-person shooter set in the 22nd century, where crime and hopelessness run rampant amidst the chaos left behind from a nuclear holocaust. Players will battle vampires, the undead, and even a cadre of Dark Judges as they try to maintain some semblance of order in a world gone wild. In keeping with the spirit of the comic, some perpetrators of lesser crimes need to be arrested while others must be taken out with extreme prejudice. The ultimate goal is to confront the evil Judge Death, who has taken it upon himself to cause as much mayhem and destruction to the beleaguered city as possible.
