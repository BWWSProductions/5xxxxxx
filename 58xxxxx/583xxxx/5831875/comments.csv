Guys ..keep Seeding .. ISP dont charge for UPLOADs ..so Help others too. I wish 20-40 torrents are longest seediong ones. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-15T20:12Z,"Unfortunately hakuna, today is the day of Hit&Run bastards - and from the first season onward, SoA fans and me never have such problems.

I am most rabid on Hit& Run - and today SoA has INCREDIBLE 98 percent of idiotic downloaders who probably have no fucking clue how hard is my policy regarding Hit&Run.

So - as the matter of principle - I would NOT encode next SoA episode, maybe never again. Other shows, for less, have been dropped out without hesitation.

But - 14000 finished downloads and 77 seeders is lower than I can or will tolerate.

Next week, I hope that XviD would be 525 MB and [eztv] would be delighted with such crowd."

But what about your true followers, like me, who do our very best to seed like mad? We do truly appreciate you. I will be really upset. Thank you for this episode a million times; if it really is to be the last in this format, then I am truly sad. :)"
