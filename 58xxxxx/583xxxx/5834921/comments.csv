,earthshine,2010-09-17T19:15Z,"110 gig!!...hang on,just nipping out to buy a new hd!"
,greedyDEADsoul,2010-09-18T03:49Z,"The idea is to pick-and-choose what you want from this torrent, although I do have room for this entire thing on my internal HDD alone, haha."
,Matt90977,2010-09-18T09:35Z,I got plenty of drive space for the whole thing. have downloaded bigger ones.  I only want a couple vids from this one.  there seems to be no seeder though.....
,money56,2010-09-18T10:25Z,I am seeding 24/7 so this should be fully seeded in about a month cause i have a shitty internet plan at the moment only 1.5 mbps upsteam and 3 mbps down im hoping to upgrade soon to a 24mbps down and like 12mbps up but only after i get a new job interview next week so heres to a new job with full beniffts and big bucks coming in  
,nuclearlion73,2010-09-22T02:00Z,"14.1% Completed so far. Gah, the suspense is killing me!

I would be very surprised if I don't get the job thats how confident I am good luck with the download and sorry it's taking so long i have been seeding day and night regardless of what the tracker is showing.  
,metalfingerface,2010-12-06T17:55Z,seed it i didnt spend the last 3 days downloading to 28 percent just to get a shit ton of vids that dont work
,pratik_src,2011-06-26T15:45Z,how the hell did u upload this torrent....how long did it took???

,Drbj69,2011-10-01T13:09Z,good job bro but it will be more appreciate if you split it thank you ;p
,schlierkamp,2012-02-20T09:24Z,"424 megs of 110 gigs dLed. 6 days, 11 hrs, to go. 

Anyone who has never had a subscription to sapphic erotica, I highly recommend it. 

Just remember not to do what I did. Don't dL and then watch one video. Instead, dL as many videos in a day as is humanly possible. Keep doing that until your 1-month subscription is over and then your lifetime porn collection is pretty much complete for a long, long time. =)

money56, was just looking into Xfinity. Found out about that 250 gig per month cap. So lame. I heard it might be different as a business. But, I haven't looked into it. Even at $200 USD per month, 105Gb/s is mighty tempting since no one else, not even Verizon FiOS (not available in my state anyway), has that kind of dL speed.

Thanks. Looking forward to one week from now =)"
