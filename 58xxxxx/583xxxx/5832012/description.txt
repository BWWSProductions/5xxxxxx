ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    Says Herman:                                                   ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã                                                                   ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    â€œFor years, fans have been asking us to record a live album,   ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    but honestly, we never really had the time due to our          ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    worldwide touring commitments and studio album recording.      ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    However, due to the overwhelmingly positive feedback from      ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    fans on the â€˜Ultra Beatdown World Tourâ€™, we decided to         ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    finally put some real thought into it...                       ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã                                                                   ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    â€œThe idea was to record every single show from the last leg    ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    of the tour, so we could pick the best take of each song       ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    without needing to do any overdubs in the studio; keeping the  ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    whole thing â€˜LIVEâ€™ like all the classic live metal albums.     ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã                                                                   ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    â€œThese recordings really capture the raw sonic energy of a     ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    Dragonforce show in fine detail. It is so real that you can    ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    hear the noise of the crowd and experience the show as it was  ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    that night â€“ you can even hear the guitar pedals being         ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    stepped on!â€                                                   ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã                                                                   ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    FORMED IN 1999, Dragonforce â€“ a multi-national amalgam of      ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    players at the very top of their game â€“ have spent the past    ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    decade proving that virtuoso musicianship and strong           ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    songwriting values can appeal to rock fans right across the    ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    board; itâ€™s a journey that has seen the band playing sold-out  ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    headline shows around the world, including in markets as far   ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    afield as China, Hawaii, New Zealand, Russia & Columbia,       ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    forging a telling relationship with the â€˜Guitar Heroâ€™          ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    franchise, and tucking four strong studio albums under their   ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    collective belt, with sales currently topping the two million  ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    mark worldwide.                                                ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã

ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    And now, whilst seeking a replacement for recently departed    ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    singer ZP Theart, the band have delivered a set of recordings  ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    that successfully highlight the non-stop energy and            ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
ÃžÂ²ÃÃžÃ›Ã    entertainment-or-bust ethos of the Dragonforce musicians in    ÃžÃ›ÃÃžÂ²Ã
