,INVADERMUFFIN,2010-10-23T02:14Z,"Yep, same thing for Doom 2 and The Final Doom"
,Sephiroth93,2010-12-14T20:40Z,"Those who can't play Doom on windows vista/7, use zdoom to play them. or just download my pack which have Ultimate Doom, Doom 2 and Final Doom with both wads.

[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-02-11T06:26Z,i hate it when people do that. advertise their shitty torrents on my good one.... guess ima go do the same :)
,Sephiroth93,2011-02-16T03:57Z,"I believe I didn't advertise? It's pretty much same to me what people use, and oh btw... This does not work on my windows 7 ultimate 64-bit without zdoom so get your facts right before come to yell things... Just saying...

Crappy torrent? Mine is A: Smaller B: It's just unrar and go..."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-03-09T11:04Z,"im on windows 7 home premium 64-bit with intel i7core 920 cpu with 2.8 ghz per cpu with 8 cpu's total, 4 virtual and 4 physical. nvidia geforce gtx 260 with 1.5 gb video ram, 9gb ram, and 1tb hd. IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY ON MINE :) (and my other 3 pc's too) i think i might report you as a spammer, i see no reason as to why you had to post a link on my torrent to yours, mine has zdoom inside too btw. oh and if people want they can use mine without installing too, but itr's better to just install because than it creates shortcuts for you so you don't have to do so. it also places the folder somewhere out of your way so your desktop doesn't get all cluttered. for some people (believe it or not) they don't understand what to do if you can't install it, even though it says what to do in the instructions..... "
,Bigtreetim78,2011-03-10T03:01Z,D/Loading now... hope Final Doom works good.... been trying to find it for a while.  Will comment again.  Thanx for the up.
,Bigtreetim78,2011-03-10T03:21Z,"Well, got it installed and it does start up but having color probs and it wont let me use the mouse even though I set up config like I wanted.  IF neone knows where I can find ""just"" Final Doom PC, let me know, already have good copies of Ult. Doom and Doom 2. Tanx agin."
,kithylin,2011-04-04T04:02Z,"PLEASE do not label your torrent ""All the older doom games"" when this is the WINDOWS VERSION THAT IS NOT THE OLDER VERSION thanks for wasting my time.... sigh... Back to searching for the actual ms-dos version somewhere on this site."
