Singer-songwriter Bruce Hornsby rocketed to popular and critical attention in the mid-1980s with his sophisticated and soulful rock music. The master pianist and his backing group take the stage here at the Rockpalast in 1990, performing a set which includes such hits as "Jacob's Ladder," "Mandolin Rain," and the chart topping "The Way It Is." Hornsby beautifully demonstrates both his vocal range and his impeccable piano stylings, while the Range provide a full yet unobtrusive supporting sound.
