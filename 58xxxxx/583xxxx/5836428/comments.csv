,Bluefalconjp,2010-10-31T16:16Z,"Thanks ADHDerby, it works perfectly.  Just a question, though.  I noticed that the cursor stays up for 3 seconds in full screen mode instead of 1 sec as in the previous releases.  Is there a way to fix that?  How would I go about fixing this myself.  I hate having 3 seconds of my movies covered up by full screen controls, cursors, etc.  Thanks."
[T],ADHDerby,2010-11-02T20:02Z,"You're welcome! :)

@ Bluefalconjp: I did change the cursor hide time.
You can find it in the Registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\CyberLink\PowerDVD10
Look for MouseHideTime, the value data should be 1

You will need to edit the skin to change the hide time of the full screen controls.
My previous Skinpack does not work with this version. :/

You can find the value in PRELOADSKIN.XML
Search for AutoHideAnimation and change the Duration value to 1000 (3 times)"

,keithasdf,2010-11-18T07:09Z,"don't know why, sometime the True Theatre HD actually screw up the dvd quality, opposing the meaning of the function's intent. If my laptop resoultion's is only 1280x800, is this function a redundant to me??
i did switch the HD off many times trying to get a decent picture, but somehow it not as good as PowerDVD 8, may be i remember wrong.
any thought on that?"
,keithasdf,2010-11-18T07:21Z,"don't know why, sometimes the Theater HD  function screw up the quality instead. The only dvd so far gave better quality under the help with the HD function were the Matrix RL and Revolution. Playing Doom for example, it screwed up bad.

Tried switching off HD and meadow with other functions many times, still was unable to get a balanced pictures. 

I seems that PowerDVD 8, the one i was using before, although the pictures were not as sharp, but was better than 10 even with no HD setting.

PDVD10 however produces better picture if the pictures consist of very clear definition of dark and brighter areas, but then again these are not consistent overall during the playback.  

on a side note, my laptop resolution  is only 1280x800, is this HD function redundant to me?? 

i noticed the best way to view dvd is to get one of those old 1024x720 CRT screen, but is impossible to get one nowadays.....

any thought? "
