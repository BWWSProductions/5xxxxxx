,MercenarySoldier,2012-03-27T07:56Z,"Ha ha ha! I like your comment ""Support the companies whose software you actually enjoy."" Everyone knows ENCORE makes some of the shittiest software that you can ever make. You don't believe me? Go to www.amazon.com and type in Hoyle Casino Games 2011 and see if it's not 2 stars (if it is even that high, last time I checked it's one star). So no, I will not support ENCORE, I am just downloading this game for some mild entertainment. I will probably not take it seriously."

get this http://wincdemu.sysprogs.org/

It will probably ask for restart

after you restart, unpack the files

bouble click the .iso file or whatever comes out of the unpacking and it should ask what letter drive you want to mount it as.

just pick whatever letter you want

it will mount up

look under ""computer"" and it should now show that the game disk is there and find the setup.exe file on the disk

and now go through install crap

simple?"
