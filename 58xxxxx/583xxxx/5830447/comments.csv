I have a Japanese animated movies in my mind. I dont know if you would like to upload anime movie but here it is:
 Origin - Spirits of the past 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493247/
I'm hesitating to ask you for this as my request doesn't seems to get enough attention from others. But im sure it will be as good as my other request.(similar to Princess Mononeke and Spirited Away ). Its theme song is really great. Pleeease.
Thankyou.
