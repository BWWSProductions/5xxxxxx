Composed in 1723, "The Four Seasons" is the chiefly famous work of Vivaldi, and among the most popular pieces of symphony barroque. A work appears here arranged by Michiru Oshima, Larry Coryell, Kazuhito Yamashita and Kazumi Watanabe concerning a duet of guitars and, presenting a fairly interesting that instruments takes to a high degree distinct coloration of the original, without changing the central idea of the music. Yamashita plays guitar by nylon strings while Larry played with steel strings, creating an interaction of style that is very well explored during the music.The interpretation of the two is very good and very different from each other.
