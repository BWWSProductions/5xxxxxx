,Fallerup,2011-10-01T13:46Z,it won't let me past the loading screen when I'm done creating my party :(
,vintara,2011-10-17T20:11Z,The game freezes after a few seconds. When i alt+tab and then max the screen again it's over. But after a few seconds i have it all over again. Anyone got a solution for this?
,vintara,2011-10-17T20:13Z,"At the starting town the game freezes after a few seconds. When i alt+tab and then max the screen, it's all over again after a few seconds. Anyone got a clue on how to solve this issue?"
,vintara,2011-10-17T20:13Z,sorry for double post
,blahsieblah,2011-11-09T17:27Z,Okay I so did not know you could mount rar files with daemon tools. So anyone having a problem downloading cause they had a brain fart like me just mount the disk1.iso even though it is not in iso format.
,Syruzak,2012-02-15T13:44Z,"okay, I mount the CD, the menu appears, I click install and then nothing happens, I even tried to set compatibility with XP SP3 on the setup.exe and autorun.exe but still nothing"
