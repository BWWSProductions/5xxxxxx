In 2007, there was a book called the "Star Wars Vault" which had tons of random photos and files from the Lucasfilm archives.

The book also included two CDs with fifteen total tracks.  This torrent is those two CDs.  They include interviews with Lucas, the stars, John Williams, parts of the Star Wars Radio Drama, radio commercials for the movies, etc.

It's a total of 15 tracks.  I hope you enjoy!
