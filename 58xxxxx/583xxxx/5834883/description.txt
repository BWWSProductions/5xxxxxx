- 1975 - Fish Rising -

He characterised himself as an "Electric Gipsy" and nowadays embodies one of the figureheads of Ambient/Space Rock. While working on his first solo project, Hillage still rendered assistance for the band mates of GONG till their album SHAMAL in 1975. Except for DAEVID ALLEN, who left the band, most GONG members are likewise participating in Steve's FISH RISING album, that proves as a worthy successor of GONG's RADIO GNOME INVISIBLE trilogy. With FISH RISING the spirit of early GONG lived on, deep in contrast to the direction the band took itself.
