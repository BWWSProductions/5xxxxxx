FINE YOUNG CANNIBALS FINEST is a greatest-hits collection with three previously-unreleased tracks.

Fine Young Cannibals includes: Roland Gift (vocals); Andy Cox (guitar); David Steele (keyboards, bass).

Fine Young Cannibals only released two albums, so it's slightly unusual that they even have a greatest-hits collection like Fine Young Cannibals Finest. After all, a dedicated fan will have both records, and casual fans will only want the singles on The Raw & the Cooked, thereby eliminating the audience for the collection. Despite these misgivings, Finest does its job well, featuring 12 of their biggest hits and best-known songs plus two unreleased cuts to entice collectors. If you want the highlights, Finest is fine, but most fans will want to stick with the two original albums. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine
