    An elaborate Hollywood retelling of the Bible stories narrated by the    
    film's director John Huston. We open with the Creation of the World      
    and arrive at the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve and continue on to    
    Cain and the murder of Abel. Next, we visit Noah and his ark with its    
    spectacular flood sequence. Then we come to the story of Nimrod, King    
    of Babel, the emergence of man's vanity and the heights to which it      
    could aspire if unchecked. Finally we cover Abraham, a mystic who        
    spoke personally with God, a leader of men, a builder of nations, a      
    pioneer and a warrior and Sarah. At the time she conceived her first     
    child, the event being forecast by an Angel of the Lord. Three such      
    Heavenly Messengers appeared in the course of events which befell        
    Abraham and Sarah.
