,gameboygamer,2010-09-17T16:33Z,"I dont think you have downloaded this torrent yet otherwise u wont be saying so.
I dont know about all the time but when i completed the game it came as a message that the album is unlocked now fully.
You will also see that message when you will complete the last chapter i.e Chapter 15 yourself.
Just do and then tell me whether it is there or not!"

,gameboygamer,2011-08-12T21:11Z,"@BOOZ-47

I dont care if the game doesn't start for u.
The saved games files may not work for all. 

Play yourself again and dont search for saved game if u r upto insulting the uploaders."
