,Primitive1,2010-09-22T09:48Z,"You should see the comments and fix these problems. Otherwise, get your useless torrent off this website.

I am having the same problem:
unable to find resources, missing CD.

This is the worst torrent I had ever seen on Pirate Bay. 
This is a very BAD TORRENT.

I suggest anyone who see this comment, do not download this torrent. It is a trap."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-09-25T08:16Z,"@Primitive1 you are an idiot. that said. you both are probably on windows 7 or windows vista. RUN THE INSTALLATION AS ADMIN!!!!! if you don't know how than you should not be on that os and should not own a pc. hell, you could even try running the installation in compatibility for windows xp, as i have tested this on an xp os and it worked perfectly. btw i just upload torrents, that doesn't mean that i care to fix every single little problem.

also check the F***ing reame me, i included a way to get my tech help. read before you post!!!!"
,gotestra,2010-09-25T16:45Z,"Hey!Please dont get into a fight,and dont use abusive language.Its not good.And also @primitive1 YOU SHOULD ALSO CHECK THE READ ME FILE BEFORE YOU POST FOR HELLS SAKE!!!"
,Raddaya,2010-10-21T11:44Z,"Hey guys, punk told me over message that, after you install it, you should activate ""setup.bat"".(It could also just say setup), then play it. Then you won't get ""unable to find resources"". ^^"
,gabouille,2010-12-17T20:52Z,For Hells Sake the Update doesnt work
,zammysage22,2010-12-21T22:26Z,"Step by step instructions: 

1. Download.

4. After installation go to ""C:\NovaLogic\Delta Force Land Warrior"" Or where ever you installed it to
5. Run a file called ""Setup.bat""
6. Run Dflw.exe and enjoy!"

,e-thug,2012-01-20T07:58Z,"works indeed, I ran all the unzips, installs, unpacks and register files in frustration before reading here though. did setup.bat last but as pointed out by zammy that file was probably doin the trick. could have mentioned that in the readme so people dont go downloading yet another one and start hating. win vista 32bit here"
