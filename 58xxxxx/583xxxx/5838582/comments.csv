,tylr,2010-09-19T05:33Z,"hey buddy.. seriously no point if ur not doin movies in 400 -> 450 mb

..tat was the initial reason y i liked mkv formats..
^_^"
[V],prashant22,2010-09-19T06:06Z,"@tylr
buddy if the size is too small like 450mb then the video quality is nt that good..it becomes kind of choppy or pixelated....
so i keep the video bit rate around 800kbps...this results is a better picture quality...n size is nt that big its just 150-200mb more..."
