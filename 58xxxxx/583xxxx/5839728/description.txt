Combat: Task Force 121 is a first-person-shooter that is solid but very underwhelming. It takes the very basics of FPS gameplay movement, shooting, grenades and does them acceptably well, but it doesnâ€™t do anything beyond the basics. There was no effort to innovate and the result is a bare bones experience where you have seen and done everything before.

Weapon balance and level design are also detrimental to the overall experience. There are only six guns in the game along with some C4 explosives, grenades, and a combat knife. The guns are the typical pistol, assault rifle, SMG, sniper rifle and shotgun that you would expect. The problem is that while the shotgun in usually a one-hit kill, the other weapons seem to take an unusually large number of shots to get the job done. Level design furthers the weapon problems because the levels are mostly made up of tight corridors which donâ€™t allow you to really use the weapons to their full potential since shotguns+narrow corridors=why would you use any other weapons? The sniper rifle is also practically worthless because there arenâ€™t any good sniping spots in the levels.
