Patrician IV is the sequel to the historical trading simulation and strategy series. 
You are a merchant in northern Europe in the late Middle Ages when the Hanseatic 
League was flourishing. Your goal is to rise to the most successful and influential 
member of the Hanse, ultimately being elected Elderman, leader of the trading 
league. You start bargaining with common goods, build up your own production and 
establish a merchant fleet. Later on, you will gain more and more political influence 
and even found new towns.

However, a Hanse merchant's life can also have its dark sides. 
On your way to power you have to hold your ground against fierce rivals, whom you have to fight with 
economic competition, price wars or impure means such as sabotage. Will you even 
engage in piracy?
