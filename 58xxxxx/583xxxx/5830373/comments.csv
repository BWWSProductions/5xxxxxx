does anybody have any?
or an idea how come"

,adam1516,2010-09-15T21:58Z,"hhmmm I've added the game to the firewall and it STILL wants to connect. The only way I can get it to work is physically unplug the internet cable - not very practical.

Anyone any suggestions?"
,FarazSeyedi,2010-09-17T18:01Z,I thought this wasn't coming out before 21.
,Crunox,2010-09-17T18:20Z,"no offense, but the game doesn't work at ALL. it needs internet to be played. if i unplug my internet and try to launch i get the message ""pat4 has stopped working"".

with internet i get the message ""key is invalid"". soooo...what's next? what do I do now?"
,Crunox,2010-09-17T18:24Z,doesn't work at ALL. game doesn't launch when I launch it without internet. game doesn't launch with internet because the product key is invalid..what's next?
,badsector,2010-09-18T04:25Z,"SOLUTION:
right after the install, the game patches itself to Kalypso Launcher 1.1.1.3.  the serials didn't worked with this version so we need to revert to the old one.
You can find a dll KalypsoLauncher.dll in the game's directory. the size of this dll is 103k, this is the updated dll.  Mount the disk image and you can find the old dll(size 95k) on it. 
Copy and overwrite the KalypsoLauncher.dll from the disc to the game directory.
The serieals now working with this version(1.1.1.0). But, BLOCK THE GAME FROM THE INTERNET, WITH UNPLUG CABLE OR WITH GOOD FIREWALL!! IF YOU DON'T,THE GAME PATCHES ITSELF AGAIN!! (if it happends, do this procedure again)
(btw good game but its crash frequently, and didnt well optimized, it is stressed my GPU, even with very low graph settings)"
,D33f,2010-09-18T15:06Z,"Updating this game is higly recommended, as it adds quite a few nice features.

1) Install the game
2) disable the internet connection for the game. You can do this by going to the advanced settings for the windows firewall, and then add a rule for outgoing connections for the patrician4.exe
3) run the game and enter one of the serial keys, then exit
4) download the patch online, i got it from here:
http://patches.gamersgate.com/patrician_iv_113.exe
5) when installing, make sure to put it in the right folder! It's wrong by default (patrizier 4 instead of patrician 4)

now you can play the game without any troubles"
,Kooh,2010-09-18T20:14Z,"Wow thanks D33f, patching the game that way actually worked for me :o"
,hongsydney,2010-09-20T22:45Z,"D33f  How did u do the update???
The update 1.3 ask for activate....i got stuck here...can u help???"
,JesShare,2010-09-21T00:28Z,"I figured out how to patch this without the activation thing. Even if you've used the gamersgate patch that has securom activation, you can just download the retail game patch from another site like brothersoft and install over it.

its whatever patch is less than the 160mb patch from gamersgate. The one that works is like 148mb. You still need to block the internet connection probably - I just installed the patch and ran the game with my connection disabled."
,habuki0,2010-09-21T17:50Z,works great thanks :) had to block both incoming/outgoing connections on my firewall so it would work but works a treat now 
,mamalimankan,2010-09-21T20:24Z,hey can you please supply me with a extra cd key they are not working .... guys i need help im stuck at the cd key part
,Kooh,2010-09-22T00:14Z,I can't believe people can't even follow simple instructions here. Just unplug your freakin internet cable and reinstall the game if you are too retarded to figure how to use a firewall properly.

JesShare"
,stenzxz,2010-09-23T13:32Z,"Just in case... very easy step-by-step ""guide""
I have Win7, and this worked for me.
1. Download and install (don't run the game)
2. Go to Control Panel and open Windows Firewall and select Advanced settings
3. Go to Outbound rules and press New rule button on the right side
Rule type: Program; Browse (Patrician IV exe file); Block the connection; make sure that everything is checked and name the rule.ĂÂ´
Run and enter the serial key
So far I could run the game, but not after the patching. My suggestion: don't patch."
,Antiquado,2010-09-25T10:57Z,"For people without firewall software:

1) Create a new text document
2) name the document: Patrician IV.bat
3) In the document, type this text:
ipconfig /release
C:
cd\[you install dir - e.g. c:\games\Patrician IV]
Patrician4.exe
ipconfig /renew
4) Double-click Patrician.bat

Whenever you want to play, just double click the Patrician IV.bat - it will disable your Internet while you play Patrician, and enable it again when you are done."
,deus-ex-nihilo,2010-09-27T16:36Z,"it works also with patch!
1. install game
2. disable internet

6. play game"
,Kaupo,2010-09-28T19:47Z,"All works fine for me.

,Mart726,2010-09-30T13:04Z,"The game has a problem with iZ3D driver.

While the patch works on the Vista Laptop it does install on the Destop but when i click the Patrician.exe icon it opens a box giving me a request key to give to the game develpers to get a new serial key
iN CASE ANYONE HAS GOT THROUGH THE PROBLEM PLEASE COMMENT"
,MrTTAO,2010-10-03T05:46Z,"first, this really should have had a proper crack, what a half assed release.

Second, the game is v1.0... in v1.0 the game is unplayably buggy, on many system it crashes on launch. The official list of bugs fixed from v1.0 to v1.13 is horrifying.

Therein is the problem. V1.0 will take any serial you input as long as it is blocked from an internet connection, this is done via firewall or disconnecting from the internet. Do not try to edit the hosts file to point it at local host, it will go into an infinite loop and crash.
it is trying to connect to launcher01.kalypsomedia.com for the interested. I was going to try just pointing it at a junk IP rather then local host... but there is no point in bothering...

why? because as I said, v1.0 is unplayable...
v1.13 has been linked in this thread, it can be gotten here: http://patches.gamersgate.com/patrician_iv_113.exe

it will NOT take any of the serials provided, whether you are connected to the internet or not, they simply do not work. It demands online activation, but it will not even try (it makes no connection attempts according to fiddler) when you input any of the serials herein (makes sense, they would have included serial bans in the patch).

bottom line... you can try running the v1.0, and deal with the bugs.
Reviews are mixed, but tending to be low, all say its horribly buggy. There is no demo, and the DRM on the patch stands uncracked... So there is absolutely no way to try this before you buy it, and its probably a turd. Pass"

,Blarg6969,2010-12-14T20:21Z,"This is a VERY long game with a long lead into the real gameplay. It takes a a couple hours of just trading meat and cheese before you get to begin making any serious headway. Fun game for anyone that enjoys dominating the trade scene in games like Civilization, except this is not even close as easy to master. Do not bother to play this game without the 1.1.3 patch!

1. Install Game
2. Disable Internet (I disable network adapter in the network settings)
3. Start Game

but there is no possibility to downloade it. 
Could you please inform about functional crack or release new one for version 1.3?"
,sacerdose,2011-04-20T22:41Z,"Alright everyone. I think every single post to make the game work has some mistake in it. After finally having figured out how to play WITH a patch that actually makes the game enjoyable (the 1.0 version crashes and sucks!), I've decided to give you a guide to install this game that actually works.

*Note: This guide is to enable you to play the 1.1.3 version of the game. For versions 1.2 and 1.3, I have no clue how to play the game without buying it.
All you need to enjoy this game is patch 1.1.3.

So:

1) Mount the game (use Daemon Tools for this) and install. Don't run it yet.

2) This part if VERY IMPORTANT. The game does not allow you to play it if you let the internet to communicate with it. Therefore you need to block the communication between the two.
Here's how to do that:

2.1) Go to Control Panel and open Windows Firewall and select Advanced settings.
2.2) Go to Outbound rules and press New rule button on the right side.
2.3) Rule type: Program; Browse (Patrician IV exe file); Block the connection; make sure that everything is checked and name the rule.

3) Run the game (shortcut on your desktop should work).

4) Enter CD Key. This one should work PAT4-G6UW2-5RLEB-7YP2X-N77PA.

5) Now exit the game, since you've only got the crappy 1.0 version to work at this point.

6) Download the correct 1.1.3 patch which enables you to play WITH the internet communication blocked from THIS site: http://www.gamershell.com/download_63696.shtml (hit download at the bottom, and download again after 5 seconds on the next page.) D33F's little guide on page one linked the wrong 1.1.3 patch which CRASHES if you block the internet.
*The correct patch to download is indeed the 148MB one, not the 157MB one.

7) Patch the game. You will have to select the correct folder to patch the game since its default location to patch is WRONG. Normally you will need to patch to: C:\Program Files\Kalypso Media\Patrician IV

8) Once patch is done. Run the game! Should work from the desktop.

9) ENJOY!"

Still running.

BUT im facing with a serious problem. Have huge graphic failures, cannot play the game at all on Emachines acer, T4400 intel pentium, 4 GB ram.

Dont know why. I have win 7 64, got the newest directx which was 550 mb by the way.
Even read after, so i got the 9.0c as well for win 7 64.

Cannot see the boats, the wall, its killing the graphic card. The menu and the video in the beginning works well in all resolutions. Im completly confused, any ideas?

,RegPulp,2012-04-13T22:43Z,"i believe ""scribe20"", after quickly doing a search with google, (only took 4 minutes.....), found this

russian forum, translated by google

""I can not find a working crack / nocd for 1.3 Eng. version of the Trivium crack does not work. + Crack for the Russian version of the database, does not work on the English version""


as i thought (quite easy to work out), the russian version of the game comes with startforce protection, the english version does not, so that fact alone would more and likely make the executable non-interchangeable, and that is not even factoring in that the english version of the game does not comes with russian version, so again suggesting the two countries having there own individual releases.

i wish people would use there sense before misleading people.
