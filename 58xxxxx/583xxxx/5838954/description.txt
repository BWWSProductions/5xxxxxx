
Giorgos Zampetas was a composer and singer, but most of all one of the most outstanding soloists on the bouzouki, with the most distinctive sound. Zampetas was born on January 25, 1925, in Athens. He was the son of Mihalis Zampetas (a barber) and Marika Moraiti. 
In 1940 his family moved to Aigaleo and Zampetas created a special bond with this city, where he lived for the rest of his life. 
Zampetas started playing at clubs in 1950 and in 1952 wrote his first song, "San Simera San Simera," for Prodromos Tsaousakis. 

In 1959 Manos Hadjidakis offered Zampetas the bouzouki soloist role for his recordings. During the following years Zampetas participated in many sessions, enriching the songs of Mikis Theodorakis, Stavros Xarhakos, Yannis Markopoulos, Mimis Plessas, and many other composers with his playing. 
In the '60s he reached the peak of his career, appearing in the biggest clubs of the time, touring throughout America and Europe, and composing many hit songs for the burgeoning Greek cinema. 
Zampetas also wrote music for more than 100 movies, including Kokkina Fanaria, Lola, and many others; he composed many songs for theatrical plays as well. During this decade Zampetas developed his characteristic playing style, marking his songs as unique and recognizable even to the present day, distinguished for their melodic introductions and lyrical expression. 

In the '70s he changed his music style and began composing mainly satirical songs -- including such hits as "O Thanasis," "O Penintaris," and "Malista Kyrie" -- and once again Zampetas had a major impact on the Greek music scene. He also wrote music for a number of films during the decade. 
In the '80s the music genre that had brought Zampetas to prominence began to decline, and as a result he faced difficulties with recording companies. Unfortunately, his career was on the decline and so was he. 
He died March 10, 1992, at the age of 67 after a long illness.
