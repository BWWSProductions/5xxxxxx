Synopsis:

Alex has one sweet life. After walking away from his death-by-accounting job, heâ€™s now a video game tester at Brainasium, the company responsible for the worldwide gaming phenom of â€œEternal Death Slayer.â€ At 35, he may be the oldest tester in the business (heâ€™s called â€œGray Bushâ€ by his co-workers), but heâ€™s also the best. But when his roommate fails to pay the rent for six months because heâ€™s spent every last cent at Madame Wuâ€™s Filipino Palace, Alex unfortunately finds himself on the street. Alexâ€™s last resort is to move in with three hot babes â€” thatâ€™s what he tells his friends, at any rate. In actuality, the 35-year-old finds himself living with his sweet and loving 80-year-old grandma Lilly, along with her two roommates.
