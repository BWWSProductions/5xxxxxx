Release Notes:

Umm Well this is a proper of some bullshit group who cant
rip but whateva we kick ass like always  Smoke Dat Ganja
Nigro
Real Proper Reason:
Not sure what kind of retail did gnvr have, looked all over the
internet couldn't find one with 14tracks, anyway this isn't the
reason. Us as a group we are pro .cue wherever it's needed
mixcds etc. This isn't the case though. If you listen close
tracks hardly blend with each other. So here's a proper .us
retail with scans and all and ripped as separate tracks as it's
supposed to be since THIS IS NOT a mixcd.
