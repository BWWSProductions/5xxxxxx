Are you sure your computer hasn't been hacked?"

@WillKane- wondering if you're referring to that p0rn u/l ? It does seem out of the ordinary realm of JW's usual offerings...

JW: if that skin flick wasn't your u/l, you should check in with a Mod. According to some of the threads in the forum, some accounts have been hacked.

OTOH: if that is yours, just ignore this! LOL!!

Have a safe weekend, all."

I do think that someone has my password, so I have changed it. I think the language used on those uploads was Swedish? But I can assure all of you, those uploads were not mine."
