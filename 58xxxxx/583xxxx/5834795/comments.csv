,sage1210,2010-09-18T03:51Z,"my bad.

a shortcut on desktop link to the wrong place."
,AeonwOw,2010-09-19T00:34Z,Hey when i go to offline practice it loads all the way and then closes swarm.
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-09-25T08:27Z,@AeonwOw perhaps your pc can't handle the game? other than that i have no idea. try looking it up on canirunit . com that site will tell you if your pc can or can't handle a certain game.
,fluster84,2010-09-25T08:34Z,"I run the game with the ""Alien Swarm No-Steam"" shortcut on desktop, then go to Offline play > Select Squad and Level 1 loads, and it plays ok. But is there a way that I can select other levels? Sorry if this seems like a noob question but I just can't seem to select other levels."
,joel.westerlund,2010-11-23T18:52Z,"This release does not run for me with the provided nosteam shortcut.
It only gives me an errormessage stating that revLoader has crashed.
The regular game starts, but then ofc can't be played since it complains about Steam.
I tried lots of crap, googled the revLoader since I had no experience with it.
Eventually I just started looking all over the place and saw the rev.ini, modified it so that all paths were correct and with the right Big and small letters for filenames etc.
Then started the revLoader.exe only, without the .bat-files or shortcuts.

That worked.

Thanks for the upload, I just feel sorry for the less debugging kind of downloader. ;)

I'm using Win7 64bit if it matters."
,fallout11,2011-06-02T23:36Z,"Worked great for me (offline) with the ""Alien Swarm.Bat"" file in the game directory."

,Sploder,2011-11-07T14:23Z,"I get an engine error ""couldnt allocate any server IP port, tried 2 adresses"". Pretty sure this is something to do with my computers internet settings but I dont know how to fix it.

Any ideas?"
,Sploder,2011-11-07T14:28Z,"Ok never mind, I thought I'd told my firewall to let it through but I guess it had other ideas. Problem solved. Thanks to all who tried to help!"
