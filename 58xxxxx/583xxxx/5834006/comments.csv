,jrem_17,2010-11-18T01:29Z,is this compatible with magicdisc?
,some-young-guy,2010-11-18T19:24Z,"Thank you C-U for neglecting to tell us that when one installs SP2, your entire partition is dismounted and saved into a folder titled Windows.Old inside the C: folder.  I am thankful that your SP2 D/L rate greatly increased in the late hours when I paused all other activity in uTorrent, but because my partition was dismounted, I can no longer seed this SP2 or any other torrents I was seeding.  I guess I will have to spend the better part of the next 36 hours reconfiguring my machine to accommodate SP2.

Anyone considering using this torrent, it will force you to format your partition which means out with the Old and in with the New.  Ensure that you back everything up before rebooting with this SP2."

Do You Mean This MagicDisc?

http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm

""some-young-guy""

No No No Wait, Hold Up A Minute, There Is No Possible Way That You Can Format Your Exsisting Operating System And Your Old Windows Files Be Put Into A Folder Named ""Old Windows Files""

If THAT Happened, Then You Did A Upgrade Type Installation, That Is Your Fault, Not Mine, I'm Sorry That You Didn't Intend To Do What You Did, But Anyone And Everyone Knows That IF You Format Your Old Operating System That Format Means Erasing Everything, Nothing From Your Exsisting Operating System Will Be Backed Up Anywhere.

Is There Anything Else I Can Help You With? :)"
,some-young-guy,2010-11-18T21:30Z,"I accept that wiping my system was my fault as you were not the one to press my restart button with the SP2 disc in the drive, I was.

I would suggest that you retract the statement of ""everyone everywhere knows"" because everyone everywhere does not know.  In fact, if you would be so kind, please remedy this and future situations by editing the language used in the description field of your uploads to reflect only pertinent information such as the fact that if you do not intend to format your partition, please seek another torrent as there are no other options for this one.

I also wish to correct my own error as this and the previous message applies to the Home Premium of Vista SP2, not the home basic and I'm not sure if they've been created the same way.

I'm not looking to point fingers and I request forgiveness if I've offended you.  I do however wish for the miles of useless Windows history that is scripted below to be replaced with actual useful language and FAQ type responses that the next man not get caught with his pants down like I did."
,some-young-guy,2010-11-20T01:24Z,"""MMC could not create the snap-in""

Can't seem to work around this.  Have been through Windows Features under the programs menu, but other research suggests that this might need to be remedied via the registry.

C-U, are you aware that this is an SP2 related issue?  I can't no longer access device manager, and this wasn't a problem until most recently.  Any suggestions?"
,some-young-guy,2010-11-20T15:29Z,http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=3BD8561F-77AC-4400-A0C1-FE871C461A89&displaylang=en&pf=true I am downloading this update with the hopes that the updates have the correct MMC as the current SP2 MMC does not have any of the snap ins.  It's just an empty shell.
[T],Computer-User,2010-11-21T19:39Z,"""some-young-guy""

I'm Really Sorry That Installation Didn't Turn Out Like You Wanted It... Didn't Your Old Windows Files Be Put Inside Of A Folder Called ""Old Windows Files""? It Should Be Located In The Main Hard Drive ""C"" That's Usually The Default Drive Letter.

""some-young-guy""

Will You Give Me Some More Information On This? No-One Else, Not Even Me... Is Having The Problem That You're Having. :)

In All Of My Windows Vista Operating Systems, I Don't Have Anything To Do With The Service Pack 2, All Of My Windows Vista Are Full, Retail & Untouched. :)

The Only Thing I Have Done Too All Of My September Releases Is Include Every Windows Update Up Too September 2010.

My November Releases I've Included Every Windows Update Up Too November 2010 And Packed The November Torrents With Alot Of Goodies, But Still Every Operating System Of Mine, Remains Untouched :) :)

When you open containing folder there are 3 items there the first being a folder named ''Windows vista activation'' the second being a txt doc and the third an iso file named ''Windows Vista Home Basic SP2 (32 Bit).iso''"
