,isis5,2010-09-17T19:51Z,Thank you! This show is starting to look good and I appreciate you posting it!
,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-09-19T04:15Z,"If you ( everybody ) look at a torrent and it has no screenshots or link to boxcover/official info about the file  google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out who dont know what the file is ! please dont be lazy and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself , the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now !
also seed dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets you upload eg a 50mb download service probably has a 1.5mb upload speed, the faster you upload the faster you download thats how bittorent works."

,NitLions,2010-09-20T01:34Z,zeit how could u possibly post that and then not do it yourself?? U do understand u took all that time to ask people to do something and then refused to do it yourself instead of showing people what u want them to do. Waste of time brosef
