                    The Tears of Uther Pendragon. Part 2.    
                    Fantasy drama. With Merlin gravely ill from the  
                    Serket's poison, Morgana and Morgause continue  
                    with their evil plan. They have mentally  
                    incapacitated Uther and convinced his enemy,  
                    Cenred, to invade Camelot. The fate of the  
                    kingdom now rests on Arthur's shoulders. The  
                    Prince and his Knights resist the invaders, but  
                    Cenred's soldiers are not the only threat they  
                    face. Can Merlin stop Morgana in time to save  
                    Arthur from the enemy within?
