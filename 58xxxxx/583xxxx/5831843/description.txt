This add-on pack for MS s FS2002 and FS2004 simulators will let you fly a number of Lockheed C-130 variants. This Just Flight package in a single stroke takes an already superb Hercules simulation and pushes it off the scale of our reviewing grades. If we had an Ultra Classic award we could bestow for the finest turboprop aircraft, we could perhaps do full justice to this add-on. As it is, our PC Pilot Classic award will have to suffice for such an incredible achievement as Just Flight s C-130 Hercules.
