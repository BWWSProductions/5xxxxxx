NHL: Stanley Cup 2008-2009 Champions: Pittsburgh Penguins 

trying to explain the Penguin comeback season of 2009, firing of the head coach 2 months into season, losing key players in the off season, pens fans still reeling from getting crushed in the 2008 Stanley Cup Championship by the same Red Devils whom we wrestled it from in 2009, is a very difficult thing to present on one single short DVD. Personally I thought this captured the bulk of the season and the difficulties experienced by the Pittsburgh Penguins our 2009 Stanley Cup Champions!! Who can forget the last 6 seconds of game 7! Seemed like 10 minutes/forever to me! 3 shots on goal!
