[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-26T20:28Z,"@ mickemus66 - what I use is Handbrake.   
http://handbrake.fr/details.php/ 

I do not have a BluRay Drvie/Reader on any my PCs, but Handbrake handles/encode BRRips and stuff like Superman Batman Apocalypse 2010 720p BluRay X264-QCF. It works great with everything that I have thrown at it. Great quality and small sizes. Also its free, so give it a try."
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-26T20:33Z,@ Tiestick2003 - I will gladly do Boardwalk Empire and the new season of Dexter.
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-27T19:38Z,"@ Tiestick2003 - Ask and you shall recieve. (^_*)

,rakz2cul,2010-10-21T11:38Z,it has been a long time since your last upload...i hope you will come back with your superb uploads
[V],poppedtart,2010-10-23T01:56Z,"HR is posting, so why bother!  Long live HR!"
,krillert,2010-10-23T03:46Z,I saw that but why do you need to post new movies only? There are a lot of great HD movies out there that we ATV users cannot see. You have done a great job with your encodings so far anyway.
,Salchichon,2010-10-23T07:40Z,HolyRoses And poppedtart r the same ppl just wanted to let u guys know
,krillert,2010-10-23T12:04Z,There is no logic in that.
,lfcchrisft9,2010-10-23T12:34Z,"Could you upload Entourage seasons 5,6 and 7 for ipod please. Thanks"
,rakz2cul,2010-10-23T19:05Z,sometime i wonder you and HR are the same human being...
,Salchichon,2010-10-23T21:55Z,@rakz2cul yes they r why do think one account stops posting and the other one start posting again...
,rakz2cul,2010-10-25T19:58Z,it is really not a big issue for me whether HolyRoses And poppedtart are the same person...the most important thing is that HolyRoses And poppedtart doing excellent job...everyone including me must very very thankful to all these superb up-loaders..with out them all this amazing downloads would have not been possible...big thanks & and keep up the good works...
