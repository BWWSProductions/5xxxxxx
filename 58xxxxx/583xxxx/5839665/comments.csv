I have the same problem PLEASE someone help "
,Lestat57,2011-06-29T18:09Z,"Croc 1: Win7, took a while until installation even began (I already gave it up when it started all of a sudden), no movies, no music. Other than that it works perfectly."

,lolwut180,2011-12-27T04:36Z,"I can't get it to do anything. An error keeps coming up and saying that my computer is missing ""ads.dll"" or something like that. Can anyone help me to fix it! I really want to get this game to work!!!"
