,only1alive,2010-09-17T23:10Z,"Saying something is legal to DL on a pirate site is sure to make people NOT download it.

It's kinda like telling your kid to not do something.  If he things it's wrong, it must be fun!  If it's something ok to do then it must be boring/suck.

By this movie being released for free on the bay, it basically is worse than a straight-to-DVD film."
,jessemana,2010-09-17T23:54Z,"Well, i disagree. i think that releasing the video on Tpb for free is a great idea, because if i had to pay for it, i wouldn't have even clicked on the link."
,honunetcti,2010-09-18T00:00Z,"shouldnt have put a link to the trailer.  I watched it, the movie looks shiite.

,wind_highlander,2010-09-18T03:22Z,"The idea IS capable of changing the world. THIS is the real sense behind TPB, not only downloading illegal stuff and biting at the system, but creating something new, something better. How many films won't be shown because capitalism sees no $$$ in them? How many artists are frustrated by having no chance to publish their work? How many of us do know what is being made in Indonesia, Mexico or Tanzania??? How else can an ignored but otherwise talented director show what he/she is doing if not posting/ having it posted here? I've had the same idea before, but hey, how good TPB thought of it too AND DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!! Cheers! Way to go!!! "
,redorlando,2010-09-18T03:50Z,Thank you for this wonderful gift.  I hope your bravery catches on and we see more wonderful films we would otherwise never get to see or hear about.  Thanks again. 
,sumdumnam,2010-09-18T04:23Z,"video was a little twitchy for me in places (with recent VLC) -- not horrible, but noticable.  i suspect that pirates are the current experts in encodings like XviD, and content creators have some catching up to do.

still, interesting movie, and i applaud the creators' decision to release it via TPB."
,ojaideadhead,2010-09-18T04:26Z,Thanks alot..Looks great. Keep up the good work! viva la independence!! Independent Movies too!
,below90hz,2010-09-18T04:36Z,"this is EXACTLY what I've been telling my friends about: if all the greedy corporate pigs in the movie and music industry would stop fighting file sharing and actually EMBRACE it, they would make a shiteload of money.

Its so effing simple and obvious:  if they would just create their own damn accounts and upload ""official"" movie and music torrents with a paypal link in the description and just ask people to donate based on how much they like it, they'd be MAKING money off file sharing instead of throwing away money trying to fight it.

Honestly, most people who pirate would NEVER pay $20 for a music CD or $35 for a BluRay. And I am not paying $1.39 a song on iTunes either. So they are not ""losing money"" because we pirate. You can't lose a sale on someone who never had any intention of buying. BUT, we are, in reality, an untapped market. So Hollywood, MIAA, how do you get money from from people who think you are greedy? Show us you're not and ASK us to donate if we like what we download. That's fair. That would be a mutually beneficial arrangement. 

So Stina Bergman, Bravo. I hope you are blazing a trail for many more to follow."

,SentFromHell,2010-09-18T09:10Z,"The whole thing (releasing via TPB) seems like a good idea regardless of how odd it may seem, this  might be the beginning of something big. As far as the movie, it's a pretty good film, kind of weird and somewhat confusing but totally worth watching"
,dewy721,2010-09-18T10:03Z,"PirateBoy09 its like this...
If your attention span doesn't last more than 10 minutes its not gonna make sense to you.

The psychological plot is analogous to that of good sex; nuances executed subtlety and thoughtfully yet with provocativeness than is only appreciable to those that can last more than 10 minutes.

In other words: take the time to enjoy it, the movie is a puzzle that puts itself together eloquently at the last few moments. Kind like the movie ""Memento"" just in a bit more of a conceptually elegant way."

,papayrus,2010-09-18T21:32Z,Doesn't it seem obvious that people who down a free movie that was actually pretty good are either less than 12 years old or maybe Holly Wood trolls. Maybe Holly Wood YOU SUCK there is like rarely a movie worth watching from Holly Wood any more. I guess all the good directors spoiled dumb fuck kids took over and thats why we get crap movies out of Holly Wood any more. There is still a few good ones every once and awhile. So good job to the Holly Wood directors that actually have an imagination and do good too bad its only like 5% of all the movies they produce. I am an American by the way so you know I dont back up Holly Wood whatever movies anymore accept the few hard earned good ones.

,themixingbowl,2010-09-19T18:28Z,"Very cool idea. Thanks ThePirateBay for helping the independent film makers by promoting their hard work. I have helped seed it all night, and will continue to seed. I hope those who enjoy the film donate a couple dollars as well as those who appreciate the effort or just think it's cool they would give it to the bay first."
,djuvck,2010-09-19T18:41Z,very cool..

,enzy,2010-09-19T19:01Z,"Very nice movie, thanks!!  "
,JetboyOZ,2010-09-19T22:26Z,"Don't know if this will be my kind of movie, but the fact that someone is willing to make a movie and make it free domain is the first step into the right direction, and enough to get me to watch it.

tl;dr - Take note hollywood!"
,eaerp,2010-09-19T22:30Z,"This is such a great movie!

,leilarj,2010-09-20T19:42Z,"Thanks Pirate Bay!
V:10 A:10 M:VI!"
,Brian1454,2010-09-21T18:59Z,i'm downloading this just because of the idea of spreading your movie with torrents! brilliant
,PasteKBrain,2010-09-21T22:54Z,"Even though I haven't finished the film yet, I think the idea itself of first releasing a movie through TPT is a real good one. It shows people that good movies still are being produced adn are worth being seen in the cinema. I'll seed as much as I can to support this movie and its creators.

Please excuse my mistakes I'm not english-born."
,myn4m3sux,2010-09-22T07:46Z,"great fil, watched about 5 minutes of it and cant understand it, but i shall seed to support

if there is anyway to get some subtitles that would be great so i could enjoy the film, otherwise ill just seed"
[V],bigbluesea,2010-09-22T08:19Z,"Show the world that this ship will never sink!

We have crossed all Oceans,we are one,we are strong and we will continue to conquer!"
,Bitmaster,2010-09-22T12:26Z,"I haven't seen it yet, but my seed ratio on this movie is 92.6. I'll seed to an even hundred methinks :)"
,iprattle,2010-09-25T07:44Z,"As I downloaded this, I read a few comments. Some people were harsh. I just finished it. I actually liked the movie. As an American, I can't help but think it is very Euro-tragic. A very European coming-of-age story. That's not meant as an insult. 

Yes, it is a little slow moving. I think that's probaby the American in me as this movie seems on pace with many other European flicks I've seen. But it is important to note it is suspenseful and to some extent, character-driven instead of explosions & car crash thrills. 

I hasten to add, it is a very poignant movie and deserves to be downloaded and shared.

That said, if there were another movie by the same people, I would download it. 

If you like good, thought-provoking movies and depressing films--or if you like things like ""Man Bites Dog,"" you'll enjoy this film."

,xMajesticMeteorx,2010-09-27T18:35Z,"I just seen it and really really enjoyed.  Seen it here on torrent download.


Very melancholy and memorable and bittersweet. Quite a unique film and the first foreign ""artsy"" effort I've not been inclined to fast-forward through.

I really wish this success and hope to see an update on all the actors someday. The women were all so pretty, and surely those girls are all becoming foxes now too, lol.

Thought it was chilling how the young narrator girl says, ""In Sweden people don't die from hunger; they find other ways to die..."" But this is not a cold movie. In fact I spewed a mouth-full of beer when that one clod husband thinks he'll stay another night and screw the wife if she'll make good on the tandoori chicken.

I wasn't offended at all about the somewhat chubby girl and the comments by her ass father, and she was quite a... sport about it and her oblivious ""screw you"" attitude was funny and priceless. But understand that in America there'd likely be ass reviewers that'd raise overwrought flags about that just as they do with the ""nigger"" word over here.

This film needs to be on the message boards and forums of big popular blogs and chat rooms. For I am just a lonely voice here at LiveJournal aand Facebookthat nobody visits :-(

They should leave it on TPB front page longer! It was the first and nothing took its place afterward. What was the rush to hustle it off after a mere 48 hours or so? 
And sadly TPB was suffering temporary outages I believe throughout your run-- probably enacted by the same sorts that refused you even the most meager of a theater distribution package for Die Beauty.

I'm not sure what I'd expected from Sweden images other than cold and Bjorn Borg. And it was surprising to me that this looks much like Summer in rural mid America and not at all a miserable permafrost prison.

I like the sort of dead pan, realistic acting throughout this.

And hey the dudes are all fine in their roles and believable. That strange Coroner guy did make me nervous though, and I've a feeling his Stepford daughter will have him in the river soon.

This deserves to be listed at IMDB.com, for I like it better than ""Fargo"" that won the Oscar in 1996."

( Update: If you do a search on Stina Bergman you'll find it on IMDB.com-- but the mofos at IMDB wont let you comment unless you ""Confirm"" your identity with a credit card and getting a pin# confirmation by way of your cell-phone, which I WONT DO! < Sort of stupid of IMDB.com, in that ANYBODY can make a ""Review"" over there on a quicky account without ""Confirming."" )  "
