,proDL,2010-10-19T18:13Z,"Works great in Windows XP Pro SP3. 

BUT!! 

I have tried on 2 different Windows 7 Pro PC's and I keep getting an error with the ""Keymaker"" ""Unable to get environment information!"" I have tried using Admin access, making a second account with and without admin access and using Admin credentials, turning off the Firewall, Windows Defender and all AV software. I am out of ideas, if anyone has been able to get it to work in Windows 7 I would love to know how. 

Maybe it has something to do with the cracks I have installed to allow Windows to work and update, that will be my next try."

What to do?"
,kraftseeder,2010-12-14T00:25Z,"Just run it
""Unable to run without user priveleges!""
Run as admin
""Unable to get environment information""

What to do?"

FIXED: Our previous keygen would give you the  on x86_64 systems with Windows 7 that have multiple network cards, regardless of AV software. This has been fixed in this version. If you did not have any problems with our previous release, you do not need this.

Google for 'radmin keymaker fixed embrace'"
