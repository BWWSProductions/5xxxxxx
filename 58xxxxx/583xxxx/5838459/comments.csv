,fakebest,2010-09-19T19:21Z,@sk8rboy361 why would you say that people come here to do the opposite and someone is not going to mod there 360 to buy games except for a select few that are into having backups of there discs and most of them make there own backup not download it.

,piido1,2010-09-19T22:11Z,Will i get banned from xbox live for playing this before the official release date?
,SamuDeAur,2010-09-20T00:23Z,"@piido1,  Yes, just make sure that you are signed in as Guest or just don't sign in at all until the release.

But you can still play though just dont play on a xbox live profile (MU) create a guest profile."
,Marques777,2010-09-20T03:58Z,game works great. 
,BigDet,2010-09-20T04:25Z,Thanks and the game works great
,TheTriib4l,2010-09-20T10:46Z,i have played online and so have 50 000 others still no ban hammer
,Nirvana22,2010-09-20T11:11Z,"I've downloaded multiple film torrents, but never a 360 game. So not entirely sure how it works.

I have a 360 slim, it's not chipped or modded at all. I know you can buy region free games and still play them, but if I downloaded this, would it work on a legit 360?. And as long as I only play it offline, and don't sign in till the release date, I shouldn't get banned?."
,SYNAESTHE5IA,2010-09-20T12:10Z,"Nirvana22,

If your console isn't modded, don't download it. You'll just wasting time and bandwidth as you won't be able to play it."
,Nirvana22,2010-09-20T12:24Z,"Okay cheers :). I'd rather play the 360 version, I wasn't too keen on the 1st game, the save points put me off, but this one looks pretty good and I liked Case Zero on the Arcade. I'll probably just download the PC version and play it for a few hours to see if it's worth buying the full game.

Cheers for the help though :)."
,HKsininen,2010-09-20T17:32Z,Fucking Super Zombies in the end :D
,Quadratus,2010-09-20T20:26Z,"If you play this before release date you risk being banned. It does not matter if you sign in as a guest or with your xbox live account, because Microsoft bans the actual xbox, not the account. And yes, you can be banned even if you play offline, since you will be flagged, which can result in a ban once you do go online."
,Nightm4r3z,2010-09-20T23:00Z,"hi guys im having some trouble here,...anyway to stealth patch this as abgx360's down? thank you P>S Seeding this too OBVIOUSLY lol"
