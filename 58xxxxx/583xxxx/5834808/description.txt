this is a nice zombie 3d game. has pretty fun graphics and amazing game play. travel around shooting the hell out of zombies, or use melee if you prefer. save different civilians with weapons and they'll travel with you. you can play as any of the 5 characters at any time thoughout the whole game the other 4 will be controlled by the cpu.

weapons and abilities:
main guy: has a handgun and a crowbar
2nd guy: is a police officer and has a shotgun and a tazer
3rd guy: a construction worker with a chainsaw and tovs
4th: is a lady nurse, she heals your injured and can give a temp invincibility shot
5th: not sure what he is but he has a machine gun and something else (forgot what).

ENJOY AND PLEASE SEED!!!
