This video is most of the show from 'The Airborne Toxic Event' at Town Hall in New York City on September 11, 2010.

It was my concert recording with my Flip minoHD, and I failed at doing a good job aiming the thing at the stage while keeping it mostly hidden in my shirt pocket, but the audio is pretty good.   The new songs from the soon to be released album are amazeballs!
