Resources for Study of Islam and Qur'an - A Collection:


The last few weeks have witnessed intensified levels of Islamophobia. It started with the controversy over building a Muslim Community Center in a location about 6 blocks away from "ground zero" where the twin towers of the World Trade Center (WTC) once stood. Although the project was approved by a Manhattan Community Board by a vote of 29 to 1, some people made an issue of the project in an attempt to raise religious fanaticism against Islam and Muslims. This resulted in wide demonstrations against the proposed center, and was followed by many acts of vandalism against Islamic mosques and centers in several cities in the USA.

The above controversy was then followed by a threat from a pastor in a Florida church, Rev. Terry Jones, to burn hundreds of copies of the Qur'an on Sept. 11. Although he backed down from his threat, several incidents of burning the Qur'an took place in several cities in the USA.  

These kind of acts can only fuel religious intolerance and fanaticism. On the positive side, however, these acts increased the interest of many people to know more about Islam.
