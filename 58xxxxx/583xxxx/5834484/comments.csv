I'M GOING TO BUY A TV TUNER...BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT THAT MUCH...MY TV IS VERY FAR AWAY FROM MY COMPUTER...SO IF I BOUGHT A TV TUNER CARD...WHAT SHOULD I DO TO GET THE CABLE OF THE TV TO THE COMPUTER....STILL YOU KNOW...I NEED BOTH TV AND THE TV TUNER AT THE SAME TIME...SO MY QUESTION IS...CAN I GET TWO CONNECTION OF ONE CABLE TV CONNECTION, ONE FOR MY COMPUTER AND ANOTHER FOR MY TV ITSELF...OR DO I NEED TO BUY ANOTHER ASIANET TV CONNECTION FOR THIS... ???

2ND QUESTION : WHICH IS YOUR TV TUNER CARD AND IS IT GOOD AND HOW MUCH RS. DOES IT COST ?

a suggestion...u might know this already...there are many rare and classic malayalam films almost daily telecasted in the channel called WE (mammootty's channel) and other regional language films in the channel called rosebowl...try to record those using tv tuner and upload it here....once i got a tv tuner...then i'll start creating torrents.. eagerly waiting for your reply.."
,navjkar,2010-12-02T16:33Z,"thanks for an amazing selection of Malayalam Cinema.

Just would prefer good quality rips if possible."
[T],faukka,2010-12-09T03:40Z,"first of all i dont have a tuner card
the rip i told was given to me from someone else
tv tuner and tv can be used simultaneously using a connector
there are 2 tuner cards - external and internal
internal is used for cutting
it will cost you about 1200 rs"
