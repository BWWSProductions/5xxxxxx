StarCraft II includes three completely distinct and balanced races – the Protoss, Terran, and Zerg, which have been overhauled and re-imagined with a number of new units for each. Also, now the game runs on a vibrant new 3D-graphics engine capable of rendering beautiful landscapes as well as massive army sizes – promising an exhilarating StarCraft experience."
