[T],FaMoUz,2010-09-17T04:03Z,sreens look alright better than tha TS.V2 but not for 14.33GB.. did u at least use a codec like XviD or H264...
,afkuser,2010-09-20T04:10Z,"monkey884 has 2 torrents total.
Both are supposedly this movie.
Neither are real.  Think about it."
,the_know_how,2010-09-20T18:34Z,because format is mp4
,monkey884,2010-09-20T20:59Z,format mp4 HD qulality 1980x1080
,Martin_84,2010-10-22T19:33Z,"Haha. Somebody is toying with us. This is cinema video, recorded with camera, and converted in mp4, probably with thought that the quality will be better. Color is dull, edges are blurry and sound is horrible. Dont download this, it is not worth 14.33 gb."
,anton1212,2010-10-27T20:10Z,I have no problem with large files for true 1080 HD but this is more like third generation VHS quality. I just downloaded a 1.4Gb xvid version that is much better quality and it has nearly 8000 seeders!
