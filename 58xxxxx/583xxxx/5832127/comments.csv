,macune88,2011-06-09T07:15Z,"wow you have some really good torrents, i downloaded your fates and this one, but i had a problem with fate 2 because when i run the setup it goes to the wild tangenet  fate undiscovered  installation page that has a bunch of broken images could you please help me?"
,sioux104,2011-07-23T14:26Z,"This is aboout the 40th torrent rom you I have dl'd now cfreakdog, so I figured it was past time I left you a comment...

As always, this one is a trouble free dl and install; and as always it works great. Might not sound like much of a compliment, but 40 torrents straight without a single problem is kind of astonishing compaired to the usual success rate at PB...

Keep on doing what you do ok? And would you check your xfire inbox for me at least once this week and accept my request? My nick is nunitataqa and I would like to have a talk with you about your torrent work. *smiles*"
