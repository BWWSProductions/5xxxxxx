    * Alan Bartlett Shepard, was the second person and the first American in space (May 5, 1961). He later commanded the Apollo 14 mission in 1971 and became the fifth person to walk on the Moon. The Main Character name has been derived from his name.
    * Shepard is always male in advertisements.
    * You can customize and use any first name you want â€“ but itâ€™s never shown or heard during game play.
    * The male Shepard also seems to speak with a hint of Canadian dialect. This may be because Mark Meer, the voice of the male Shepard, is Canadian.
    * The default names of both the male and female Shepard are the names for unidentified missing persons (John and Jane Doe).
    * Mass Effect 2 is an action role-playing game developed by BioWare  and published by Electronic Arts. The game is a sequel to Mass Effect, and the second game of the series."
