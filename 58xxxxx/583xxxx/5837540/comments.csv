Nice effort"
,Strikefear13,2010-09-18T07:23Z,Works perfectly on Acekard 2i with newest firmware.
,nick2504,2010-09-18T08:07Z,"i got r4 menu 1.2:( so if billy is right it's not working for me, but i'll try it out on ds sim so i hope it does work"
,puny9,2010-09-18T11:07Z,"Confirming this works on the latest DesMuME. I'm able to save and level up fine. 

Any word on if there's a walkthrough or translation or something for those of us that don't speak Japanese?"
,Frogger89,2010-09-18T17:25Z,"You guys are all idiots it doesnt even work on Acekard2i all it shows is a Whie screen after loading

,TheNikko,2010-09-18T20:37Z,"^ are you fucking retarded? the other torrent isn't fake, i've tried it and IT WORKS on desmume, but the other one didn't give any exp. will dw this to see if it fixes it.
if you have to be sceptical on the internet, dw yourself and see if it works, don't listen to ONE dude saying it doesnt work.

,Frogger89,2010-09-18T21:03Z,it doesnt work on Acekard 2i all i see on loading screen si a white blur and nothing else happens
,billy1989,2010-09-18T23:29Z,"Now confirming this does work on DesMuME, the newest version, but to play it on desmume u have to have a got CPU, otherwise it will run slow, ill wait until a workin copy comes out for the ds.

Thanks sllim"
,billy1989,2010-09-18T23:29Z,^^^^^Sorry Good CPU
,Frogger89,2010-09-18T23:37Z,ya it runs slow on DesMuME unless ur CPU speed is good
,billy1989,2010-09-19T15:38Z,"well i also have a quad core processor and it works just as fast as the ds, not sure wat the problem is battleaxe, do u have much memory, or do u have alot of processes runnin mayb, try killin some processes.:)"
,fakebest,2010-09-19T20:33Z,"these pokemon torrents for black and white are not fake they just are new and like most new ds games you need it to be patched for your card or an update for your card which might not be available yet also these are Japanese making them useless to English speaking people ( I really don't see why English does not come out at the same time or before seeing how there is a such a big market for it) English version will be out by next spring, summer at the latest"

,supernapalm,2010-09-19T21:41Z,"I'm using the Acekard 2i with the latest AKAIO firmware (Version 1.7.1) and I have had no problems at all running it, exp works and everything.

Older cards probably wouldn't work with this game, unless the firmware is still being actively updated by someone. If you really want to play this on a console and still have a R4 you might want to consider upgrading. Like I said the Acekard 2i works fine as long as it's updated but I'm sure there are others that work, you just need to do some research (GBATemp is a good place for it)."
,sllim126,2010-09-20T03:03Z,"Something that I found that helps speed up the game in DeSmuME is to change the frame rate

Config > Frame Skip > 1

It I'm pretty sure it makes it skip every other frame, but it really sped up my game, hope it works for you"
,nick2504,2010-09-20T08:25Z,does it work on R4 wood 1.12?
,jsps13,2010-09-21T14:30Z,"This one did the trick for me on my EDGE card, working pretty good. The sounds are a little off though, some notes seem to be missing, can't figure that out."
,jgoodwin27,2010-09-21T21:40Z,"just started playing it on 0.9.6 of DesMuME so far so good... Thanks a lot, will be looking foward to an english version!"
,turnup,2010-09-27T00:31Z,"I'm sorry, i'm new to all of this. How do you get this to play with desmume?"
