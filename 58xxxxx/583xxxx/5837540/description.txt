PokÃ©mon Black & PokÃ©mon White are the first games of the long anticipated fifth generation of PokÃ©mon. These games are due for release in Japan in September 18th 2010 and are said to bring about a revolution of PokÃ©mon. .

These games are set to feature the previously established assortment of PokÃ©mon, but will also contain a massive amount of brand New PokÃ©mon.

In addition to that, PokÃ©mon Black and PokÃ©mon White take the 3D attributes previously included in PokÃ©mon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold & SoulSilver and take them to new levels by including things like fully 3D bridges and a completely 3D city.

PokÃ©mon Black & White are set in the region known as Isshu. Isshu is a region far away from the previous regions, requiring you to get there by Boat or Plane. It has a large city called Hiun City, with loads of buildings and sky scrapes for you to explore. Outside of the city and Isshu remains to be predominantly industrialised with various factories and train tracks existing in the various areas. As the games are set in a region far away, the main game will not feature any old PokÃ©mon until you have beaten the main story. The games also have you playing as protagonists older than the previous playable characters.

PokÃ©mon Black & PokÃ©mon White are to be compatible in with the games of the previous generation; Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold & SoulSilver through the aspect of the game known as the PokÃ©Shifter.
