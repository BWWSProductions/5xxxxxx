Before watching this movie I recommend watching \"Earthlings\" first.
You will then better understand why they do it:

Subs in Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, czech. Not 100% correct, Dutch is perfect.

Please watch both movies and let it change your view on this world.
Decide for yourself who are the real terrorists!
