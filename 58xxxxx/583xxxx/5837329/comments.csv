To request a reseed of any prior STOSSEL, please make a comment in the most recent episode's comment box, and be prepared to wait a couple of days, as I generally check comments only a couple of times per week. I will service your request with priority, once seen."
,adfs8p08,2010-09-19T21:39Z,I am very happy that you did this cause hulu deleted the first few shows of his. I d/l the rest of the shows off hulu and thanks to you I was able to get the first 8 shows. I could get them off utube and then stitch them together but you have better quality. Thanks

20100708-Stossel-[The Trouble with Lawyers]

But it also says there is a special this Saturday

The Battle for the Future (Saturday @ 9pm ET)

Please be sure to record & upload this also.

Not sure if the above will pre-empt Freedom Watch this week."
