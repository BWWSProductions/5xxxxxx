The fifth compilation from BFW recordings, featuring music from current and future BFW releases, from August to October 2010. 
This album spans a wide range of music - ambient, IDM, drone, post rock and shoegaze - but has a much more experimental vibe than previous compilations. 
It is a fantastic collection of new music and a damn good listen.
