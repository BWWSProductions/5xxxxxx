[T],ADHDerby,2010-09-22T10:02Z,Tip: The gate to the Vinci mansion is open! :) The garden of the mansion has no textures and is not solid but you can follow the way to the sightseeing point.
,Damien74,2010-11-22T09:11Z,"Great job! I've finnished the game but I really don't feel like picking up the last 5 playboys on my own! 
Why did they release this game like this.. with textureless areas and stuff like that. Really lazy! :( "
,Damien74,2010-12-03T22:31Z,Since I installed this one I can't load a chapter from the meny. Only free mode is available. How do I get it fixed? :/
,Damien74,2010-12-03T23:05Z,"Ok I found the problem. This game was saved with ""made man pack"" installed. If you do not have this pack installed you won't be able to load a chapter. You'll need to start from scratch OR download the pack."
