,vladhunter,2010-09-18T03:35Z,Tom Cruise is a sick piece of shit. A Scientologist brainwashing mouthbreathing inbred piece of shit. Do not support him by even watching his movies. Fuck him.

,IndigoAK,2010-09-18T12:18Z,"I don't personally give a fuck what actors or actresses do in their free time.  I'm not paying (or downloading) to know their personal, political, religious, or sexual interests - I'm paying to see them act.  What they do on their own time is no concern of mine.

That said, if everybody adopted a similar attitude, actors and actresses wouldn't spend so much time trying to make you care, they'd just do their fucking jobs."

,Ahroo,2010-09-19T14:50Z,Priests stop raping the alter boys because they grow up to be corrupt politicians that overtax us or cops on power trips that get off on being dickheads. And FFS stop joining the US military because were no longer in control of our government. Like the idea of people masturbating to your genitalia? Go through the naked body scanner at some airports. They save that shit in a data base no lie.

In the United States, a new law proposal called The Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA) was introduced last week, and there will be a hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee this Thursday.

If passed, this law will allow the government, under the command of the media companies, to censor the internet as they see fit, like China and Iran do, with the difference that the sites they decide to censor will be completely removed from the internet and not just in the US.
