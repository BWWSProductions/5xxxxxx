The numbers are simple. Whatâ€™s complicated is what we do with money. We use money to soothe our feelings and buy respect, to show how much we care or how little. We donâ€™t simply earn, save, and spend money: we flirt with it, crave it, and scorn it; we punish and reward ourselves with it.

Without realizing it, we give money meaning it doesnâ€™t really haveâ€”what former psychiatrist and current business coach David Krueger calls our â€œmoney story.â€ And in the process of playing out that money story, we often sacrifice the most important things in our life: our health, freedom, relationships, and happiness.

The Secret Language of Money is a guided tour to the subconscious meanings we give money, the conflicted ways our braindeals with money, the reasons we tend to make the same money mistakes over and overâ€”and most importantly, how you can change all that.

A brilliant blend of cutting-edge science and real-world application, The Secret Language of Money helps you rewrite your money story and find that elusive balance of wealth, health, and joy we all seek.
