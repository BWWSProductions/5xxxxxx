[color=pink]Release Notes:[/color]
Right sorry on delay on this....added the missing scenes, which was about 2minutes 10 seconds...where as before i
thought it was alot less. Used our video we encoded before, which we already had in parts from the source files,
so it was a case of finding the parts on russian video, and matching them up with our video. Russian video we
slightly filtered, but not a big deal as it don't last long :), The audio we resynced our full line audio, to
make it a complete ts, with all missing scenes ;), Audio we filtered removing the noise, making it sound alot
more healthy.
