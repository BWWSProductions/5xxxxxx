Synopsis:

Sacha Baron Cohen brings his most over-the-top character to life in the comedy that has started more conversations, generated more controversy and dared to go further than ever before! As BrÃ¼no travels the world in search of fame, no one -- whether they are celebrities, politicians or even terrorists -- will be spared from his signature sense of style and his wickedly off-kilter manner! And yes, they are all real situations!
