This SHOULD equate to every song that Agalloch has ever created. Includes the compilation, Der Wanderer Ã¼ber Dem Nebelmeer, which features an ambient collaboration between the band and Mathias Grassow, along with many contributions from other bands. In my opinion, this is the best band in existence. Enjoy. :)
