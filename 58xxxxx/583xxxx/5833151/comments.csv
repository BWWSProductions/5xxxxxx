anyways, next will be The Wedding Singer (only because i have it encoded already) but it wont be up til probably friday sometime because i have to be able to seed the movies i currently have up and, like i have said before, i can only upload at 65 kbps"

[T],ctang,2010-10-03T17:44Z,download utorrent (its free) and then open up the torrent you downloaded from this page...wait for the files to download and then locate the files on your hard drive...torrents are just advanced p2p downloading and works similar to how limewire works...i say similar but really the only similarities is that they both work by p2p (by the way that means pear-to-peer)...let me know if that helps
