,Gromnir,2010-10-07T09:13Z,"1. i do think it's the longer version, saw the first two in the ""cinema""(as the AMERICANS say).

2. the quality is fucking awesome. 


This is the one to download, even if you are Swedish."

Use Media Player Classic > Options > Inside filter > Audio Switcher > Audio time shift 

you can controll the Audio speed.

Once you got the right time,  then you can also use  TsMuxeR  you can burn TS files with time shift changed as you like. This is what I always do when auido doesn't fit.

,sexy_bitch7412,2011-11-25T10:09Z,is the audio in english for all 3?
