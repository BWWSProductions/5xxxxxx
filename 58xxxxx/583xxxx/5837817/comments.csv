,MichiganMan,2010-09-24T04:16Z,"Hey!  Thanks for arranging these - I haven't seen them since I was a kid.  I was wondering what ""restored"" meant.  I d'loaded this set and see that the opening credits are missing from ep #4 on.  Why is that?"
[T],Jonzee,2010-10-06T12:42Z,"I'm not sure why the opening credits were not included with the majority of episodes, but I think it was an effort to avoid repetition. I watched these on TV in 1971 while living in Salina Kansas, they ran in syndication all over the usa long ago, they were great after school fun. The reason they are labled as ""restored"" is because they really are a big improvement from earlier commercially marketed versions. this set can be found on the site http://scifistation.com/frames11.html"
