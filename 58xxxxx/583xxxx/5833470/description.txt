Jonathan Miller's classic documentary TV series The Body in Question from 1978.

This has NEVER been commercially released in any form, so this is clearly a TV rip. From the page on TheBox:
"Source is a 1st generation copy of an old NTSC recording which was then transferred to disc. So these are certainly not broadcast quality, but still very watchable."

Huge, massive, uncontrollable thanks to thebox.bz (http://thebox.bz/details.php?id=3435), the Anonymous uploader, UKNova and whoever it was who recorded this copy and stuck it on the internet in the first place!
