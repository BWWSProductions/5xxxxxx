Don't forget to block it with Little Snitch."

Maybe you're not using Little Snitch?

I'm sorry you're experiencing problems. I just uninstalled Acorn. Installed again. Saw the Purchase in the menu. Quit the app. Tried the keygen and worked perfectly.
I believe Acorn is calling home and blocking your machine."
