,TwEaKzz,2010-09-20T20:05Z,"It's the end of an era. As the World Turns to me will always be the best soap of all time. I've been watching it since I was like 10 or so, on and off due to my Mom watching it but once I reached my mid to late teens, I was hooked and never missed an episode. I'm now 30 and I will always cherish this great show.

Thanks for all your uploads Claudia and I wish you and everyone else all the best :)

Later days."

Anyway, the offer still stands, if you ever come to holland again you' re invited, change the cc to 2c and add hotmail to contact us "
[V],ClaudiaZ,2010-09-21T20:31Z,"First of all, I'm so sad ATWT's over :-( A part of oneself goes when a show you've watched for so long finally ends. I wish no more soaps would be cancelled next year!

Thanks to you all guys for sharing this year uploading ATWT with me, it's been a pleasure and I really hope you are enjoying some of the (still) remaining soaps that me or any of the other uploaders are doing. 

Now I ask you all, which soap do you prefer I'll redo? Days, AMC or OLTL?"
