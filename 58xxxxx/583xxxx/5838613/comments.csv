[V],twentyforty,2010-09-18T20:00Z,"@prank0007: Sorry, I would not."
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-18T20:06Z,"@prank0007: Doing 720p from TS is not what I ever have done.

I suggest you to wait for DVDrip or BluRay and go from there."
,prank0007,2010-09-18T21:10Z,"bro misundestanding
its step up 2 (2008) im talking about not step up 3

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1023481/"
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-18T21:35Z,"Yes. But as 352p. Movie (BluRay) has 16/9 aspect, not theatrical 2.35/1. Such screen ratios must be 320p or 352p in order to keep the file-size down.

Let me know."
,prank0007,2010-09-19T09:11Z,"aa sorry but was expecting in 720p
anyways thnks 4 responding"
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-19T11:45Z,"You know the dancing scene in the rain - near the end? Well, that particular scenes need over 3000 kbps in 720p to look good - below that - video is unbearably ugly. 16/9 or 2.35/make all difference in the world - of H264 low-bitrate encoding.

Also, the movie is 107 minutes long - and regarding the duration and content - 720p should be 700 MB - something I am not prepared to do in this case."
,prank0007,2010-09-19T12:47Z,"totally agreed friend

thnks for the detailed info"
