Markets! Finance! Scandal! Global Debt Collapse!

Max and Stacy look at emails from viewers on their â€œPeak Americaâ€ moments and then check out the scandals of the Irish choice of being â€œgood Europeansâ€ or â€œbad Europeansâ€, as a result of bankers offering only â€œbad banksâ€; while Iceland refuses to settle at any price. 

In the second half of the show, Max goes Down Under to talk to economist Steve Keen about the global debt collapse.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
