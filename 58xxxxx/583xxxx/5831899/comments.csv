,giggedyguy,2010-09-24T01:41Z,"Key generator is a mess. Select a license, then there is a TINY box where supposedly you enter some key (which isn't given). If you enter a string of numbers of your own, it tells you ""Max license is 9"". Nothing, nada. It's about as bad a key generator that I've seen. And it is UNIVERSALLY included in all downloads of this program.  And ALL of them are triple archived, like that's supposed to accomplish anything.

Best to check if what you upload actually works to begin with, but thanks for the effort."
