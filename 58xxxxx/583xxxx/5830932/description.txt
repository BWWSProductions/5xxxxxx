*** INFORMATION ABOUT THIS COPY ***

Provenance: Retail CD media -> WAV (with cdparanoia) -> FLAC.

Included:
  FLAC lossless audio files
  icedax-generated CD metadata (icedax is a fork of cdda2wav)
  ripping/encoding logs

Metadata (within the FLAC files and in the filenames) was initially obtained from freedb.org.  All metadata was meticulously verified and corrected against the track information which is printed on the cardboard sleeve for the release.

A note about the capitalization of track 8, "Everything is wrong": the name of this track is listed twice within the cardboard sleeve.  In both cases, "wrong" is clearly shown in lower-case.  Despite the stylized calligraphy that is used, the capitalization of all track names is readily apparent wherever they appear on the cardboard sleeve.  (On the label side of the compact disc, all track names are listed in lower-case.)

A note about the popping sounds which start at about 5 minutes into track 5, "Love Or Prison": This is probably the artist's intent, and not an error that occurred during ripping.  Another copy of this album that was ripped separately by another person, and probably with different hardware and software, exhibits the same sound in track 5.
