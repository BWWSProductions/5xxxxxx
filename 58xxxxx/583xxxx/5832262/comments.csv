,GeekHillbilly,2010-09-15T18:08Z,You might want to reseed this.Getting a no file found error after clicking on the torrent.
,Shanefpt,2010-09-15T22:31Z,"Anyone else having the same problem GeekHillbilly is having? 

Seeds have multiplied to 14 (thanks for staying connected guys) in about 8 hours, and there are 19 peers currently connected, so I would like to know if anyone else is suffering the same problem.

I am going to convert an H264/MPEG-4 AVC version (1.2GB) within the next 24 hours. I need to go perform a gig right now. :-) 

Please, if anyone else is having this error, let me know, feedback solves most issues. "
