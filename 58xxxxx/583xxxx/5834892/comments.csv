,kreem,2010-09-17T07:48Z,Thanks! Been waiting for this one. Seems to work fine for me (using R4I card)

use woods firmware with moonshell and should resolve freezing/crashing issues with R4 cart"
,SalmoO,2010-09-17T17:17Z,"Thanks for the upload, but it freezes for TTDS and GEi !!"
,iso100,2010-09-18T03:17Z,"The game freeze for me as well after the end of the first dialog, after something like a few minutes of gameplay (in the lobby room). I'm using M4DS Real with latest firmware (V4.8e X)."
,winzen,2010-09-18T06:10Z,supercard mini freeze after first ...:
,mykee01,2010-09-18T16:03Z,"Freezes After Mail Scene
using latest wood firmware"
,kreem,2010-09-18T21:56Z,I take it back - it does work right up to the point where you try to open your mailbox (just like mykee says) What a pisser - I really want this game. Guess I'll keep looking..
,kreem,2010-09-19T00:40Z,Tried another torrent as well - that let me dial the combination and collect the mail then got dual black screens. Guess this game needs some kind of patch. Might be forced to put my hand in my pocket for this one..
,winzen,2010-09-19T04:34Z,tried all combos no go plus other torrents but think blackcats version works if u can get it!
,iso100,2010-09-19T06:05Z,I guess we'll just have to be patient and wait for software updates. And thanks for the upload by the way :)
[T],simmyboy80,2010-09-19T15:08Z,"sorry people are experiencing freezing issues with this ROM , i have had my sister been testing ROM with M3i zero with 4.8e firmware and she has no freezing issues so i am perplexed with some of the comments with M3 users"
,vanlovedao,2010-09-20T02:24Z,"@simmyboy80

tried formatting the card n using wood 1.12, yet it freeze so much i cant get past chapter 1 T_T

how did u make it work?"
,kreem,2010-09-20T07:29Z,The japanese version works fine so all I can assume is that there is some kind of problem with the rom. I've bought it now anyway - should have it some time this week - I'll see if I can extract the rom myself and if it works ok I'll upload.
,vanlovedao,2010-09-20T11:00Z,wood 1.13 is out! r4 can run the game alrite now! thank u for the clean rom!
,jsps13,2010-09-21T14:27Z,It's also a no-go with the latest v1.11 on the EDGE card.
,suepernatural,2010-09-25T09:40Z,"I had the same freezing problem.  Saw the comments on here & downloaded the R4 v1.13 software from here 
http://www.r4i-software.com/Kernel/Wood_R4_v1.13.rar

no more freezing, thanks guys & thanks for the UL simmyboy80"
,kreem,2010-09-26T11:14Z,"Can someone maybe give me some advice - I've got a cartridge that says R4 upgrade revolution for DS - currently I'm using something called moonshell and to date, most things work ok - what I want to know is if I buy another SDHC memory card and install this R4 V1.13 software on it will it work?  There seems to be so many different cartridges using different software - I'm confused!"
,kreem,2010-09-27T20:11Z,Guess I'll have to figure it out myself..
[T],simmyboy80,2010-09-30T21:42Z,"@kreem

if you have r4 cart then use woods firmware 1.13 along with moonshell 2.0 and above and most roms will work , just keep a lookout for updates to the woods firmware , 

hope this helps"
,winzen,2010-10-01T12:26Z,BUT WHAT ABOUT supercard???
[T],simmyboy80,2010-10-01T13:46Z,"@winzen

I cannot help with supercard , its up to the SCDSoneI team to create a fix for it , try asking on there forum page or something"
,kreem,2010-10-01T20:38Z,Thanks simmyboy - I think I don't have a genuine R4 cart - the wood software doesnt work with it - all I get is a red 'menu' with a ? when I start the DS.  Bummer...
,KiLLeRSweeT,2010-10-01T23:24Z,Use kernel 1.35 with wood 1.12 and all the games work or add my mail larspetersson30@hotmail.com and ill send you info and the new kernel so all the games work with R4i gold.
,kreem,2010-10-02T10:13Z,"@Killersweet
My card only seems to start when it has the following software on it: R4.DAT, R4Menu, moonshl2, moonmemo

It just refuses to start with anything else - I just get the red 'menu' and a ? on the top screen. What am I doing wrong??"
,KiLLeRSweeT,2010-10-03T12:36Z,"add my msn and ill help you okay, cuz im going to football now..."
,kreem,2010-10-04T21:09Z,"@killersweet
Ok m8 - I've added you. I've ordered a M3i Zero now, so I'll be able to see if it works with that rather than my imitation R4 cart."
,kreem,2010-10-06T21:53Z,"Seems to work with the m3i zero (altho I've noticed a vertical line glitch that appears on the right screen while talking to people from time to time) The m3i zero runs all the games my R4i cart wont tho, so it's been worth it (I guess...)"
,iso100,2010-11-09T04:40Z,still no news about the M3DS real compatibility?
,iso100,2010-11-11T12:58Z,"Team SXS released a patch for the game
found it here

,valleyboy22,2010-11-20T12:06Z,how do i get the cracked version from the link??
,valleyboy22,2010-11-20T12:06Z,how do i get the patched version from the link??

:)

now the rom works perfect even on M3DS real "
,kreem,2010-12-27T13:46Z,@iso100 - the download from that link is identical to the rest - it crashes upon exiting the mailbox. Haven't tried it on the m3Izero card - expect it'll be just the same - thanks for wasting my time asshole.
,kreem,2010-12-27T14:24Z,The rom works (or at least it doesnt crash after the mailbox scene) with the patch. You can download the patch from DS Scene. 
,kreem,2010-12-27T14:26Z,The rom works after it's been patched - you can download the patch from DS Scene or just google it (but beware - DS Scene was the only genuine place I could find it)
,iso100,2011-01-17T13:43Z,It worked for me sorry it didn't work for you fat turd.
,Sifrabraindamaged,2011-01-30T22:43Z,"Thanks for putting this on man!
Really appreciate it!
Got wood on my original r4, so I'm sure it'll work like a charm :)"
