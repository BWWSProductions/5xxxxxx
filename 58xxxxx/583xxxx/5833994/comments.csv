,jamdog17,2010-09-20T09:17Z,"VIRUS!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Game would not install completely or run, tried multiple times, even with Admin settings. Ran uninstall.exe from file folder Process would not run. ThreatFire Stopped 2 illegal processes ""install.exe"" tried to copy itself to another location and ""uninstall.exe"" tried to copy itself to another location. Ran test while quarantined, virus came back as Trojan. RevoUnistaller could not find program, went to Hunter mode and forced removed, manually cleaned up remaining files. Do not download"

There are no virus lol.
It must be your computer, who already has a virus.
Ow yea and it installs fine, works fine, dont know what u have done wrong.
Try installing it again"
,234Crows,2010-10-06T20:12Z,"@jamdog17: I get lots of virus warnings from this file too.

I am using a legit, up-to-date version of McAfee.
If I scan the .exe file it gives the warning:
""Kkrunchy Packed virus found"""
,upper_United,2010-10-08T11:14Z,There are no virus. Many times virus scanners flag cracked .exe files
,godoffire2004,2010-11-09T09:23Z,"Norton Security Suite 2010 found a virus:
Infostealer.gamepass

Not sure if the virus is for real or not, but I'm not taking my chances.

I cannot say whether or not the game works because I did not continue with the installation after that. 
Here's some more information about the possible virus: http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2006-111201-3853-99"
,Azraelalpha,2010-12-23T06:15Z,"No Viruses here, folks.

@godoffire2004:
That was the exact same comment you left on the original game release. Please check your computer as you may have been already infected before downloading anything from this place."

@ 234Crows: idiot 
@ godoffire2004: idiot

,goopydoo,2011-01-20T10:37Z,Okay finished downloading installed fine no funny stuff. Has both expansions. Works just fine. Thanks!
,k4libr,2011-01-25T15:59Z,"Confirm both things: uninstall is virus infected and the game works.

Just in case you missed the important part... VIRUS!"
,fontane143,2011-02-13T17:14Z,"man i hope this work on my pc played this on onlive and its a pretty cool game, i got a intergrated video card whitch i hate, my ati radeon x1900 series was stolen hope this intergrated video card work for it piece of crap"
,JCass3383,2011-04-03T17:56Z,"After installing i get ""failed to start becasue X3DAudio1_6.dll was not found."" I ran as admin, and reinstalled it, no luck."
,JCass3383,2011-04-03T18:02Z,I also get Heuristic Virus (Suspicious.Cloud.5 - Risk High) found in uninstall.exe! Something smells funny. Norton 360 V. 4
,flatusgass,2011-04-05T06:57Z,"It's only $5 right now on Steam. Dont be cheap little children, just pay for it and avoid all of this extreme stupidity."
,Aigre,2011-04-26T17:28Z,Preliminary Scan with Synmantic Endpoint Protection found no viruses.
,Aigre,2011-04-26T17:29Z,I've had bad experiences with large single exe files though...
,MrZeroGravity996,2011-05-12T15:02Z,"@Upper_United



Why it has no Sound? Even I Maxed it Out. And I can't Open the Achievments Option"
,upper_United,2011-05-25T16:33Z,"@MrZeroGravity996


I dont know why u dont got any sound...
It works fine for everyone else.
Try reinstalling it.
And as far as i remember, been some time since i played it, the Achievments Option is properly for online play only. But cant remember."
,hamvai22,2011-10-01T21:38Z,"no virus found [Eset Smart Security 5.0 Update 6509 (20111001)]

install is ok [run as admin]

game runs perfectly"
,Aigre,2011-10-25T05:19Z,"A Heuristic Virus is something that LOOKS like a virus. Most EXE files, keygens, cracks and trainers tend to look like that.

It also tends to make noobs nervous... so I think it should be avoided."
,ihackett,2011-12-18T22:42Z,"Game cannot be played due to a X3DAudio1_6.dll error, and no one has given a fix for this. Not a waste of time as is more of a disappointment."
,trippay,2012-01-07T14:04Z,the x3daudio1_6.dll error is down to an outdated version of directx.  either update dx or do a google search for the file and place it in your \windows\system32 folder and that should fix it.
,trippay,2012-01-07T14:05Z,and as was mentioned -- there is no virus here.  false positive due to cracked version is all.
