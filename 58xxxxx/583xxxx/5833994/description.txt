Defense Grid Gold Edition

Defense Grid: The Awakening is a unique spin on tower defense gameplay that will appeal to players of all skill levels. A horde of enemies is invading, and it's up to the player to stop them by strategically building fortification towers around their base. Beautiful environments, spectacular effects, and a dynamic, engaging soundtrack bring the world to life. The controls are intuitive and the gameplay is deep â€” the special attacks and properties of each tower work together to provide many ways to succeed.

Defense Grid: Borderlands is the highly challenging expansion that not only provides four new maps and multiple challenge modes for each map, but it also brings 3 new challenge types to Defense Grid, adding a total of 30 new challenge modes across the original 20 maps in the Awakening campaign. Super Grinder, Campaign Reversed, and Poison Core modes create new strategic situations and require new approaches to solve.

Defense Grid: Resurgence is the first set of premium expansion for Defense Grid: The Awakening and is made up of 8 new highly polished and balanced maps from the original creators. Each week in June over four consecutive weeks a new pair of maps will be released providing new environments and strategic experiences and requiring new ways of thinking to beat back the aliens and protect your cores. Each map pack contains 2 maps each with a campaign mode and 4 additional modes associated with the design of that level. New Steam achievements and high-score leaderboards are associated with each map pack.
