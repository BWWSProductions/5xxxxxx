David Williams on Vyzygoth Radio - the Right of Self Determination



This is a one hour interview that radio host Vyzygoth (Keith Hansen) had with David Williams of Matrix Solutions on 08-21-10. A number of interesting topics relevant to libertarians are touched on but primarily David discusses what he calls 'The Right of Self-Determination,' which, for those unfamiliar with his work, is his ground plan for getting out of the matrix (i.e., out from under the control of any government). An important underlying theme presented by both Vyzygoth and himself is the view that the Constitution was written and instituted to benefit the Founding Fraudsters and their progeny, not the common citizen. If true freedom is your goal, then the Constitution is the problem, not the solution. I agree with that premise. I do, however, disagree with David on some of his views concerning any real degree of integrity possessed by the Founders (most specifically, the ringleaders), to wit, pledging their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor, which was naught but pretentious rhetoric. More importantly, I call into question the integrity of those in power today to honor this right of self-determination later on, when their consolidation of power reaches its apex. After all, their goal is world domination, no exceptions. Nevertheless, I wish David well on his chosen pathway and affirm that those interested in this subject can greatly benefit from his years of research.  

This torrent contains both the mp3 audio file and a three-part powerpoint type flash video version created by David to help make it more easily understood, which I have compiled into a single flv file.
