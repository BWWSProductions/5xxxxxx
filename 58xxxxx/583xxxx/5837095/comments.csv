,CPeckerwood,2010-09-17T23:55Z,thanks for not reseeding dumbasses. at most there were 4 seeders and I was connected to none of them.. DL slowed to a crawl after 50% and I am now downloading what I hope to be a better version at the same time. And that one luckily has lots of seeders
[T],nskid11,2010-09-17T23:58Z,"OK, I have a 40KB/s max upload speed, and I haven't even uploaded to 1:1 share ratio yet, ergo, there is only 1 seeder."
[T],nskid11,2010-09-18T00:00Z,"Current average completion is 83.2%, download speed will jump though the roof in about 10-20 minutes."
[T],nskid11,2010-09-18T00:07Z,"I have a 40KB/s connection, and I'm the only seeder, average completion is 87%, expect the speed to jump in 10-20 minutes."
,CPeckerwood,2010-09-18T00:35Z,"Sorry I didnt mean to imply that you were the dumbass.

I meant all those completing the download and not staying around to seed.

Well now that its done downloading for me, I'd like to thank you (thats you nskid11) for uploading in the first place. I was pleasantly surprized to see QI was back, as I've missed it dearly.

Was just a bit of a fly in the ointment seeing the seed number go up, only to go down to one a few seconds later along with  my download speed."
,CPeckerwood,2010-09-18T00:37Z,"I didnt mean to call you a dumbass, nskid11.

I was referring to all those that had completed the download, only to leave soon after."
[T],nskid11,2010-09-18T01:25Z,"My point was at the point you complained, no one had completed the download from me. :P"
,CPeckerwood,2010-09-18T01:52Z,"Point taken, sorry to have made such a stink.

Seems I have more to learn about torrents.

Could be the multiple seeders I see appear and disappear is you on different trackers, and they get killed cause its a duplicate connection. 
Thats my current theory anyway :P"
,masinadetuns,2010-09-18T11:52Z,will u upload the xl version too??   it will be awsome if u ll do :D   And thanks for the show!!
[T],nskid11,2010-09-18T13:40Z,"Yep XL version will be up by 10:00 BST tonight, with any luck."
