extraction had a lot of problems.
the install wouldnt work, the install intro crashed, and or gave a memory error.
so had to download winace to extract the game.

but a really nice job on getting this to such a small size.

and dont forget to say whats ripped in the description...."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-09-20T08:07Z,"you are probably on windows vista or 7, if on those systems you must run a lot of .exe files for older systems as admin and sometimes in compatibility for a previous os too. i recommend running it for xp. i have win 7 home premium 64-bit right now but this is not a pc i ever attempted to install this too, only my old xp 32-bit pc."

[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-10-05T14:16Z,"@hitesh78 pariah has always had so many problems running on certain graphics cards. it has errors where ppl cant play it full screen or when the game starts it will be black or brown. then there's so many other errors too. so you prolly need a different card, what card? i wouldn't know. i use nvidia geforce gtx 260. works beautifully on mine"
,Manservice,2010-10-09T13:06Z,"When I go into the folder where I installed it, which file will I launch? ""sonic"" crashes at start, ""autorun"" demands me the disc... Blah.So yeah."
,iamitg,2010-11-09T21:36Z,"Amazing. Your torrent works, but with a sound problem: When playing the game, the same background sound plays over and over again, like infinite loop. Dispite this, the game works perfectly. Thank You."
,Sioax,2011-01-16T00:55Z,"iamitg has my same problem. But it's not infinite loop. I checked the bgm mp3 files and all of them had the same beginning song when played and that causes all the boss fights and stages to have the same back ground music. How did this error occur? Do you have the correct bgm mp3 files? The game plays fine after selecting all the exe files, extracting and starting the setup.bat file. I didn't even know what I was doing when I started clicking on everything, but random clicking and experimenting is what got me to get this game to work."
,Sioax,2011-01-16T06:37Z,"I downloaded the torrent thats second to this one. It doesn't have the sound problem this one has and it allows you to change settings. The crack in the other is bad though, because you have to have disk 2 in a virtual drive every time to play it. Your exe file is well cracked and plays perfect without the need of disk 2 in the virtual drive. The second torrent plus your exe file makes the perfect torrent!"
,muchomacho333,2011-01-23T21:26Z,"Thanks for the upload! Downloaded in about 10 minutes :)
But I also have the sound problem :-("
,Ciellemi,2011-02-22T13:53Z,"Whenever I'm trying to start a game fby using eiher ''autorun'' or ''sonic'' the game doesn't even starts, but still crashes..... Help please?"
,Skittlz8D,2011-05-24T18:27Z,anyone that has gotten it to work correctly...can you write the steps on how to install it?? It willl be greatly appreciated =D
,Cyrez60659,2011-10-20T20:55Z,"For anyone having the music error (same music on every stage), go to this link: http://snesorama.us/board/showthread.php?p=360335 - and download the Sonic Adventure DX OST. Replace the downloaded files with the music files in your installation folder and everything will be fine."
,TJ1941,2011-11-29T03:31Z,"Nice, downloaded fast. Extracted fine and runs fine. A few questions to address though. I did download the sound files to fix the ""infinite loop"" and whenever i hit the windows key it closes out my game.. Any fix to that? How do i fix the resolution as well..? thanks"
,HelpGame,2012-04-09T02:02Z,"(WARNING THERE'S ALOT OF SETUPS) This is How to make SADX work (i only do XP tuts)
First download the torrent, then go to the folder which u downloaded it in, then use a archive opening program (  preferably win-rar ) and extract all files to any folder wanted and click install (by myth) and wait for the installation to go by, next after it is done installing, Exit the program and find the folder u installed it on and click setup.reg, when it's done click setup.bat wait for it to finish loading(this will take a pretty long time for a slow computer)it should exit by itself, when it does you go click sonic.exe and PLAY (ENJOY!)
oh and  P.S. download the sonic adventure OST file if ur music went wrong (same background music for every stage) its in Cyrez's description
OR download the link from this description
