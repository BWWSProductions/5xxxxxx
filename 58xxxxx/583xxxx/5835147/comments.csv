,Urthurian,2011-08-07T10:30Z,"Followed through simple four steps on Read Me, won't play.  Tested on all modes (e.g. Windows 95, 98/ME, XP, Vista), with and without UAC, also with and without 1.1.4 patch.  Says: ""The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect...""  Googled for ten minutes and find out there are more ppl with this problem than Justin Bieber haters, yet no known solution.

In sum = This does not work  (at least for me)"
,zedj_93,2011-08-13T03:45Z,I registered for this website just to say that both .exe files in this torrent have trojans that activate when you run them. NOBODY DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT. >:U
