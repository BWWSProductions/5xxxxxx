,bamsen82,2010-09-16T19:08Z,yeah right... i have eps 1- 59 now... so... you are too slow
,bamsen82,2010-09-16T19:12Z,you are too slow to get them out.. i have 1- 59 so no thanks you... 
,RThsA,2010-09-18T01:37Z,"I'm not the slow one, you are. 53-59 have been released in uncut versions, yes. I don't do uncut versions. I do cut versions from Disney XD.

If you don't like that, go download their releases and quit commenting on mine. This is mainly released so people can compare to the uncut episodes, especially if say the Disney XD airing gets ahead of iTunes releases and such. I also release the cut versions because people might want to show their younger kids episodes of this without all the blood and such in it."
