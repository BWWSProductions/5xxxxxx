Tokyo - Day 04 2010

Languages : English ONLY on this one.
Due to some f**k up beyond my control, I can only provide the English broadcast for this dayâ€™s events.  Back to our regularly scheduled program tomorrow.  Gomennasai!
The *.AVI recording was made from digital cable through S-cable, then reprocessed to 720x480 Xvid *.AVI from its original *.MPG format.  The *.AVI has both English and Japanese.
Hereâ€™s the latest AKI BASHO (2010) from Tokyo.
