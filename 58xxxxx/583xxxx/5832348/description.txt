Itâ€™s no wonder that weâ€™ve become wary of the Internet and concerned about the Internet privacy.

Then how can you stay safe online?

â€¢ Get Unbanned from Forums and Blocked Websites
Change your IP address and then you can get yourself unbanned from any forums or other blocked websites that have ever banned you.

When connecting to the Internet, your home computer is assigned a public IP address by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP address is an Internet Protocol address, a unique identifying number. It is used to identify all the different computers and websites on the Internet, and it could be used to track your communications with all websites or programs that connect to the Internet. This is known as Direct Internet Connection.

If you run Platinum Hide IP on your computer, it will modify your Internet Connection Settings and use an anonymous Proxy Server which acts as an intermediary between a home network and the rest of the Internet and makes requests for Internet information on your behalf, using its own IP address instead of yours.

Platinum Hide IP is compatible with many web browsers such as Internet Explorer, FireFox, Opera, Maxthon, MyIE browsers.  All websites visited or E-mails sent using these browsers will show you are connecting from one of our fake IP addresses.
