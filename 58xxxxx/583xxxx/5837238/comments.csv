,Rhowen,2010-09-18T02:39Z,Do I need steam in order to play?
,alibugra,2010-09-18T09:57Z,"it doesnt work. when u try to start game, it says ""can't find luaide.dll"""
,demos44,2010-09-18T10:32Z,works 100% ....
,elmardq5,2010-09-19T12:32Z,"The game starts ok, but whenever I try to play the Orcs on the March-campaign, the original game starts. Are the beginnings identical or do I really have to play through the original game once more? I deleted all my previous savegames"

You didn't install right if that happened. Make sure you have Armored Princess installed with Skidrow crack. Then install Crossworlds and then copy that Skidrow crack to Armored princess directory. "

 Apparently you have to, as I have all previous  game saves and had to start from the beginning."
,Metropaul2,2010-09-22T23:05Z,"Works perfectly well!

This isn't the regular expansion type. The new quests are low level as well as high, and so are the new units/spells. So using savegames from before the expansion is useless."
,D17,2010-10-02T12:10Z,Thank you +1
,SiN-R,2010-10-09T05:05Z,there is a new patch v1.0.0.1
,triusis,2010-10-09T17:35Z,"yes, there is a patch, but is there a crack? :) it would fix the crash with assassins skill"
,jesusshockwave,2012-06-16T11:10Z,Could someone upload a mac version of this? Please? It is possible. It goes for $20 in the mac app store. Anyone feeling up to the challenge? THANKS!
