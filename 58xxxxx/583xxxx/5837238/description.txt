Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties.

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible.

On with the game release information:

King's Bounty: Crossworlds is the expansion for the famous
King's Bounty: Armored Princess role-playing game. The new
release in the series will include the "Orcs on the March"
expansion, the two new independent campaigns "Champion of the
Arena" and "Defender of the Crown" and a convenient editor

additional content for the game and alter it in any way you
wish.

Princess installed on your PC

2 brand new campaigns (Champion of the Arena with boss battles
in a gladiatorial tournament and Defender of the Crown with
battles in unique tactical arenas with a random selection of
enemies and allies)

Game Editor for King's Bounty: Armored Princess

Install Notes:

1. Unpack release
2. Mount image or burn it
3. Install (require King's Bounty: Armored Princess installed)
4. Copy the cracked content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD
to the main installation folder and overwrite
5. Play the game

Additional Notes:

Since this expansion expands the original King's Bounty:
Armoured Princess, you'll need our previously release from
last year: Kings.Bounty.Armored.Princess-SKIDROW

Also keep in mind, that this expansion installs into the main
folder of King's Bounty: Armored Princess, so when the setup
locates that folder, it's no mistake.

Don't blame your stupidity on our behalf, because if it does
not work for you, you're not installing into the right folder.
