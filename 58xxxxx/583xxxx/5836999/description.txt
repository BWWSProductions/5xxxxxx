In the days following Mark Linkous's suicide, as writers tried to find the words to evoke the decaying beauty of the Sparklehorse main-man's hushed alt-country, many turned to the simplicity of his tune "Sad & Beautiful World." The song is little more than its title; a repeated refrain â€”"it's a sad and beautiful world"â€” elemental in its simplicity. It even delivers a couplet that's doubled in profundity ever since Linkous put a bullet through his heart in a Knoxville alley: "sometimes days go speeding past/sometimes this one seems like the last." 

"Sad & Beautiful World" is found on the debut Sparklehorse LP, Vivadixiesubmarinetransmissionplot. Though the album gained most of its attention, on its initial release, from buzzing, distorted, anthemic alt-rock numbers like "Someday I Will Treat You Good" and "Hammering the Cramps," its longevity, its influence, and its cult following came about through those sad, sad songs where Linkous whispered in a cracked voice over sparse guitars and swimming radio static. 

Over the years, Linkous would refine his shadowy, atmospheric, mood-music craft, leading to collaborations with everyone from Tom Waits to Fennesz to Danger Mouse, and other classic cuts like "It's a Wonderful Life" (whose music video was, memorably, made by amazing Canadian filmmaking anachronist Guy Maddin). 

But, nothing quite captured Linkous's abundant talents like his debut album; one that will continue to charm and inspire listeners long after he's gone.
