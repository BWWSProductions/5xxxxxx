[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-19T02:41Z,"@ penguin1-1 - Can you give me a reminder of what all you wanted, cuz lately I have been forgetting stuff like crazy and not thinking straight.This reason for this is I have a Severe Sinus Infection which makes me feel really shitty and the Meds, little sleep, and doing a lot of physical activities to help with the prep for and the working of the church garage sale, and doing a lot of other stuff (which my doctor said not to and get plenty of rest) has kinda left me drained mentally and physically. 
But, other than that I am good, plus I have be given great news about some other things. (^_^) "
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-19T03:03Z,"@ Everyone - I am currently working on a few Music Video packs 2 of which are Lil Wayne and Nickelback and a few movies and tv shows.  I will upload 1 of the music video packs and see what people think and people like it I will upload some more. So if anyone wants a music video pack of a certain artist or band, just leave a comment or send me an email. (^_^) "

,haznii,2010-09-19T17:53Z,didn't u upload that earlier?
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-19T18:55Z,"@ haznii - Yes, I did, but it was encoded with my old specs and different software and it only looked good on PSP, iPod, and Zune, everything else it looked bad, cuz of the resolution and few other things. Plus the old torrent was bigger in size and resolution @ 320 x 240, also someone wanted me to re-encode it with my new specs.
So this one is better."
