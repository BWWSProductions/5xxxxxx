,Tel69,2011-04-03T08:02Z,"To follow on from what LamboP said
""Wireshark + name resolution reveals the activation host to be vodka.alcohol-soft.com""
You need to block that site either on your router and/or editing your hosts file."

,Franpa,2011-05-02T11:06Z,This torrent is actually 2.0.0.1331 and not the newest one available. The install file is labeled Alcohol120_retail_2.0.0.1331.exe and does not install over the top of 2.0.1.1820 as 2.0.1.1820 is newer.
,Franpa,2011-05-02T11:08Z,It also says in the title bar during installation that it is 2.0.0.1331.
,Franpa,2011-05-02T11:13Z,"This torrent is mislabeled, it is not the newest version available. This torrent actually contains  v2.0.0.1331. You can confirm by downloading the file, seeing that the file is labeled as v2.0.0.1331 and even in the title bar during installation it is listed as v2.0.0.1331. Heck it refuses to install over 2.0.1.1820 because 2.0.0.1331 is older."
