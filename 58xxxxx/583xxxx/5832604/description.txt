The Guitar Song. is a 25-song, double album with thematically linked sets of songs dubbed the â€œBlack Albumâ€ and the â€œWhite Album.â€ â€œThe original idea was always to do a double album,â€ says Jamey. â€œThe album is a tale. The first part of it is a very dark and sordid story. Everything after that is progressively more positive, reassuring and redemptive.â€ The â€œBlackâ€ songs include the menacing, â€œPoor Man Blues,â€ the defiant â€œCanâ€™t Cash My Checks,â€ the sighing and bluesy â€œEven the Skies Are Blueâ€ and the chilling â€œHeartache.â€ The lighter, â€œWhiteâ€ songs are highlighted by the strongly autobiographical â€œThatâ€™s Why I Write Songs,â€ the languid â€œFront Porch Swing Afternoon,â€ the rocking â€œGood Times Ainâ€™t What They Used to Beâ€ and the easy-going groove tune â€œMacon.â€ The ambitious projectâ€™s textures are many and varied. â€œBaby Donâ€™t Cryâ€ is a lullaby. â€œI Remember Youâ€ is a gospel song. â€œThatâ€™s How I Donâ€™t Love Youâ€ is a deeply sad power ballad. â€œBy the Seat of Your Pantsâ€ tells of lifeâ€™s lessons. The title tune, â€œThe Guitar Song,â€ is told from the point of view of two forgotten guitars hanging on a pawn shop wall. â€œPlaying the Partâ€ and â€œCalifornia Riotsâ€ come from feeling out of place as a country boy in Hollywood. As a lover of classic country sounds, he regularly performs oldies in his stage shows. The Guitar Song contains â€œFor the Good Times,â€, â€œSet `Em Up Joeâ€ and â€œMental Revengeâ€. â€œLonely at the Topâ€ is an undiscovered Keith Whitley song.
