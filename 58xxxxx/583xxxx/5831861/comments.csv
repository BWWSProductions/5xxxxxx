open the torrent in your client and select start from the right click menu download one of my recent torrents and add the trackers from it to your torrent and seeding will most likely start in a few minutes "

I am not requesting any new movies now as your list is full for this month. But please provide us some insight on what you are gonna upload this month.

Cheers "
,azrash,2010-09-20T10:18Z,"@metalcore dude this is a dvdrip! It it good for a dvdrip, try to find BRrip or BDrip to get better quality.

@gunnersrock
congrats on the pink skull bro! "
,ruudsach,2010-10-04T19:32Z,"Can I see snapshots or screenshots of these movies?

Its unbelievable that you provide almost 720p rips, FOUR-SIX times less than original size.

Please also provide some screenshots of these so called great rips for such small size.

Even RMVB gives this size [300~450MB] but has rendering issues with every player except MPC, and that too is a re-enc of DVDRip.

If ye are busy, which I count that you are, some of your fans who have downloaded this great HD rips kindly upload some screenshots and provide its links here"
,ruudsach,2010-10-10T17:11Z,"I have seen 2 of your releases.

Great quality for such small size.

I am commenting here because do these French movies need subtitles files differently or you being a smart guy have rendered english subtitles directly to the file.

I am hoping you did. Thanx"
,devil.92,2011-03-20T10:10Z,wtf????whr r the subtitles????is this a joke???n why is everyone parising this guy for uploadin this movie..wat good is this without the f***** subtitles
,devil.92,2011-03-20T10:15Z,i wasted my time downloadin this s*** without any subtitles...whoever uploaded this is a big A hole..wat were u thinkin or is this ur idea of a sick joke??
,devil.92,2011-03-20T10:21Z,hey sorry for the above two comments i din check tht movie..they were already present..good work boyy.sorry for hate comments :)
,ash93,2012-05-04T09:27Z,"the subtitles are not showing in the movies. the movie is not working on vlc so tried divx player (which worked). now there are no sub titles. 
any ideas??"
