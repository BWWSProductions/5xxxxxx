Thank you for your help romeo. It doesn't work though. After I extract to PS3/SAVEDATA and connect to PS3, it shows corrupted data, so I can't copy it. Thank you anyway, I guess the actual game is corrupted or something."
,Strikefear13,2010-09-28T22:31Z,Game's fine.  He probably just doensn't know how to properly jailbreak a PS3.
,r0m4n,2010-10-28T13:12Z,i havent heard of that savedata method... lol
,sheri103,2010-11-06T12:35Z,"lol @ddsromeo2000. you need ps jailbreak or psfreedom or psgroove for jailbreaking ur ps3.
(press power button followed by eject quickly)
then get the backup manager. (and blackbox's ftp server if you want this on the ps3 internal hd). use filezilla to copy to ps3 in the path dev_hdd0/game/LAUN12345/GAMEZ 

OR

copy the BLUS30185 folder to a GAMEZ folder created on a usb."
