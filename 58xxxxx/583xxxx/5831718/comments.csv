video quality is only slightly better than a standard DVD rip"
,RedReved,2011-04-12T01:55Z,"everything came out alright, but when i try to play on ps3 keeps giving me file corrupted message, i've tried erasing and transferring back to external hd but still same thing... this seems to happen with certain downloads, some will work fine on the computer but on the ps3 things sometimes get weird, i think its a FAT32 thing... 
Anywho... decent quality but I'm going to have to try downloading from another person. "
