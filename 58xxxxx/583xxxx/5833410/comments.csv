,Maxster1209,2012-06-07T16:55Z,I have psp 6.60 Pro-B 10. I'll try this out and get y'all the feedback.
,Maxster1209,2012-06-25T12:33Z,"Kk, it's working. Played through the whole game without problems. But here's a possible fix: DON'T compress this into a .cso file. It broke the game for me. Leave it as an .iso and it should work fine. PSP 3000 6.60 Pro B10."
