Many people have DVD players that will not play AVI files with AC3 audio. I solved the problem by using MediaCoder (a free programme) to change the audio from AC3 to MP3, while copying the XVID video unchanged. Go to the video tab in MediaCoder, select Copy Video, uncheck Auto-Select for Source and Encoder, and select MEncoder for Source and Encoder (the default XVID encoder does not support streaming). On the Audio tab, select Encoder ""LAME MP3"" and Format ""MP3"". On the Container tab, select AVI."
