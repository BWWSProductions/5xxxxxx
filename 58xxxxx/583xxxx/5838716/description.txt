Jack of All Trades is a half-hour long syndicated comedy/action television series which ran for two seasons in 2000.The program is set at the turn of the 19th Century on the fictional French-controlled island of Palau-Palau in the East Indies. Jack Stiles is an American secret agent sent there by President Jefferson. While there, he meets his British contact and love interest, English spy Emilia Rothschild. Together, the two work to stop Napoleon  and various other threats to the United States. To the public, Jack is seen as Emilia's servant (she sometimes serves as his), but when the need arises, he transforms into a masked hero: the Daring Dragoon.The show contained many on-going gags, such as deliberate historical inaccuracies (such as Canada being a French territory rather than part of the British Empire), Jack being responsible for many important historical events but not receiving credit, Emilia inventing a miraculous invention in an obvious deus ex machina, and Jack and Emilia's ongoing romantic tension.
