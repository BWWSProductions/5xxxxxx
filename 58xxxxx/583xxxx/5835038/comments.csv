,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-09-19T04:34Z,"If you ( everybody ) look at a torrent and it has no screenshots or link to boxcover/official info about the file  google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out who dont know what the file is ! please dont be lazy and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself , the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now !
also seed dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets you upload eg a 50mb download service probably has a 1.5mb upload speed, the faster you upload the faster you download thats how bittorent works.
