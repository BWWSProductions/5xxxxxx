All the information and material contained in the 850 screens of the programme is based on Byzantine tradition. For example, use is made of illustrated capital letters (drop cap) from Byzantine manuscripts and borders copied from Byzantine icons.
The combination of traditions and modern technology reveals just how alive these traditions are in todayâ€™s world.
