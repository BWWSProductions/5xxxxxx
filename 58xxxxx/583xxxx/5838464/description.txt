NTENTION:
The intention for any fan-edit that i am currently working on is quite simply to follow the simple moto of â€œless is moreâ€. If it does not fit or disrupts the flow of the movie and you can edit it out without ruining story and continuity, then it has got to go. No questions asked!

EDITING DETAILS

For this particular edit, I took many ideas & concepts from â€œthe black knight risesâ€ edit and incorporated them with my own ideas to produce what I believe is the ultimate revenge of the sith edit that you can put along side the original trilogy. Just goes to show that by taking the time to truely evaluate a movie on its merits, that underneath the surface a good movie exists!
