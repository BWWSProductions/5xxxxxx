,kndlks,2010-10-12T04:55Z,"sorry mate, doesn't seem to work for me..
i got en error message during the sound installation part.. then the installation continued and i got the message all was ok.. when i run the generals.exe i get a launcher icon but the game doesn't start..."
,Adeniss,2010-10-29T11:09Z,"Yeah this game doesn't work. Same thing kndlks mentioned, sound install failed and the game hangs on the launch screen.
Thanks for the effort though."
,Adeniss,2010-10-29T16:43Z,Just some more information. Turns out the hang launch is a common problem with this game and there are a number of forums about it. The trick is to just leave it for 5 minutes and the game usually starts.

,shinjikenny,2012-01-07T03:35Z,"What is the original unpacked size of this file?
And how were you able to compress it this small? :D
My installed C&C Generals is about 1.55GB and I was only able to compress it to 0.99GB using 7z ultra compression setting :("
