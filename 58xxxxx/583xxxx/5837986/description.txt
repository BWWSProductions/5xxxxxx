    When the team reinvestigate the death of university        
    professor Richard Symes, Lane finds himself going         
    undercover in his 'spiritual home', the London Library.  
    While Lane embraces his new academic persona, the case    
    stirs up regrets for Halford, forcing him to reassess      
    some decisions he made in the past.
