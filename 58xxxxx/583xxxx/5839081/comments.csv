,dontaskdonttell,2011-08-10T01:20Z,"muzik62, your rips are practically unusable (unless one hates music). check the ""Valses"" for an example and you'll find that there a huge gaps between the tracks. same appears in many other instances.
ok, this comes for free aso aso ... but once you make the trouble to rip, tag, torrent, etc, why not do it properly?
and what's the hassle making flacs anyway--once you make mp3/320. filesize is almost the same.
little sad, this."
