,billybob45,2010-12-05T02:55Z," uploaders thanks for your efforts but please always test burn your uploads ! keep titles for each file under 106 characters so popular dvd burning software like roxio works, we need to be able to burn everything we download to dvd's so we have back ups of everything as harddrives can fail or get virus's etc...keep each files name to the point eg 

0521002508.Cambridge.University.Press.Remembering.Partition.Violence.Nationalism.and.History.in.India.Jan.2002.pdf

is too long edit it to say 

Remembering.Partition.Violence.Nationalism.and.History.in.India.Jan.2002.pdf

we dont need to be told who published each book in every file name and explain any numbering system you give , if you dont do this it can take every person hours to edit file names so their dvd burning software can work !"

The torrent seems to be corrupted.
Is it possible to upload again, uncorrupted?

Thanks! "
