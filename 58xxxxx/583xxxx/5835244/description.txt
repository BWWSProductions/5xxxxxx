Once again the seeding for this season will be VERY slow until NCIS Season 3 has some additional seeders. Once I see about 4 seeders for NCIS Season 3, 2 and 1, I will suspend seeding those episodes and put all my bandwidth behind this torrent. I should be able to push up all the files in about 25 hours.

Please help keep this and my 5 seasons of Las Vegas seeds strong. NCIS Season 5 is waiting. Season 6 & 7 are .m4v / .mp4 conversions from TV broadcasts (not DVD) but are very good quality so they will also follow. 

Once NCIS is finished I will start ripping the TV show 24 from DVD and putting it up.

I hope these .m4v / .mp4 rips are appreciated. If not...tough!

I downloaded DVD\\\'s of NCIS and ripped H.264 MP4 files of each episode. The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using Handbrake with an Apple TV standard so they can be played on any iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes. They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.

For whatever reason dark areas of the original DVD appear slightly red. I also notice this on broadcast episodes and I think this is induced in the production of the show, but is more noticeable on the DVD\\\'s. This is not a rip defect.

There are no subtitles or alternate languages.

NCIS, also known as NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service, is an American police procedural drama television series revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which conducts criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.

The fourth season of NCIS begins with one of the investigators being charged with assassinating an Iranian prisoner. Former Mossad intelligence agent Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), who was introduced last season, has been framed, and there\\\'s only one man who can clear her name. Unfortunately, lead investigator Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) has retired to Mexico. But since Harmon is the star of the show, Gibbs returns to the United States to help out his colleague. 

While most of his former team is happy, Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) has mixed feelings (During Gibbs\\\' absence, DiNozzo became the de facto head of the team, and going back to being Gibbs\\\' underling doesn\\\'t sit well with the usually easygoing special agent.). Like William Petersen on CSI, Harmon is instrumental to the success of NCIS. Low-key and sarcastic, he injects humor and drama into a role that could\\\'ve come off as dull. And while other cast members may come and go, his presence makes even some of the weaker storylines forgivable. 

In general, this season--which originally aired from 2006 to 2007--is full of well-developed plot lines that drive each episode along at a good pace. But there are some subplots that are trite: When agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) reveals that that book he\\\'s writing is based on his co-workers, it\\\'s not much of a reveal. Also, the serial-killer storyline in this season overstays its welcome by at least one episode. As NCIS director Jennifer Shepard, Lauren Holly makes a sometimes unlikable character come to life, especially when Shepard\\\'s motives are questionable. As the show\\\'s name suggests, the majority of crimes featured revolve around military personnel, but some of the show\\\'s best moments occur when they touch of the personal relationships between the characters.
