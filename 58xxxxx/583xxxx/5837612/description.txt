From listening to his grandmother recite epic poems from memory to curling up in bed while his father read funny verses, award-winning actor John Lithgow grew up with poetry. Ever since, John has been an enthusiastic seeker of poetic experience, whether reading, reciting, or listening to great poems. 

William Blake, Emily Dickinson, Edgar Allan Poe, and Dylan Thomas are just a few names among Lithgow's comprehensive list of poetry masters. His essential criterion is that "each poem's light shines more brightly when read aloud." This unique package provides a multimedia poetry experience with a bonus MP3 CD of revelatory poetry readings by John and the familiar voices of such notable performers as Eileen Atkins, Kathy Bates, Glenn Close, Billy Connolly, Jodie Foster, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Lynn Redgrave, Susan Sarandon, Gary Sinise, and Sam Waterston. 

Every reader will enjoy reciting or listening to these poems with the entire family, appreciating how each one comes to life through the spoken word in this superlative poetry collection.

His essential criterion is that "each poem's light shines more brightly when read aloud." William Blake, Emily Dickinson, Edgar Allen Poe, and Dylan Thomas are just a few names among Lithgow's comprehensive list of poetry masters. Family members can take turns reciting or listening to these poems, and enjoy how each one comes to life through the spoken word in this engaging poetry collection.

The introduction by Lithgow and his commentary are both interesting and beneficial for a greater understanding of the poems and poets. He makes the poems easily accessible to a wide audience, places them in their time and poetic schools of thought, and gives capsule biographies of them. Sometimes a word is defined to help place the poet in his/her context better, such as the word â€œModernist.â€ Other poems that Lithgow likes by each poet are also mentioned, and occasionally he has a famous quote from them in a rectangular box that relates how they feel about poetry and life in general.
