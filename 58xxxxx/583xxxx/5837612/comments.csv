Thanks to the seeders.

I do like this collection - very nice background on the 
authors, contexts for the poems, and some great readings.

(IMHO) In many ways, nicer to have fewer poems, with more
discussion, that just a straight readings of many poems (see 
some of my other poetry offerings)."
,surjagain,2010-09-26T03:54Z,Thank you very much for this.. this is absolutely the best. I completely agree with you that it's best to listen to a few quality poems and know about them and understand them rather than just keep reading a large number of poems.
