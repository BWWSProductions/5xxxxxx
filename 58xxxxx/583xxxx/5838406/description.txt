Release Notes :

Munich-based record label Permanent Vacation have unveiled details for their
second compilation, Selected Label Works 2, due for release next month.

Permanent Vacation has dabbled in a variety of styles since its debut five years
ago, from vocal club tracks to GDR-era experimental music. That said, the
label's overall focus has always been on disco-flavored house, as exemplified by
tunes like Tensnake's "Coma Cat" and Azari & III's "Reckless (With Your Love)."
Selected Label Works 2 collects some of the imprint's biggest tracks from the
past year, including cuts by John Talabot, Woolfy and Sally Shapiro. The
two-disc package also features previously unreleased cuts by Midnight Magic,
Lexx, Moonoton and the Boom Clap Bachelors.
