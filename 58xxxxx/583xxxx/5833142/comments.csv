,psiphity,2010-09-16T23:21Z,"PS hey everyone, this is NOT the English version, everyone keeps this one going around and labels it E or EU and its not its D or DE for GERMAN. So unless you speak german, you won't be able to play this one. Thanks anyway guy. Been loooking for this one every torrent site on the net, seems no one has it in English yet."

,ambermae,2010-12-06T18:02Z,"This game is really simple to understand, even if you don't speak German (fyi you can also choose French). It's a simple match-3 (or more) puzzle game, mixed in with some spot-the-difference and hidden object minigames between levels. I really enjoyed its simplicity and the whimsical guitar music is sweet too. Thanks Simmyboy. "
