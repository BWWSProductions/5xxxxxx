Weezer return to their indie rock roots on 'Hurley', their first release on Epitaph and the start of a new chapter in the bands storied career. In many ways, Weezer have always been the unlikeliest of pop rock bands, earning major radio and video play for leftfield singles like "Undone The Sweater Song" and "Buddy Holly", songs that hardly seem calculated to become radio hits. It is exactly this uncalculated quality that the band returns to on their eighth album. 'Hurley' is as warm and embracing as the glowing smile on actor Jorge Garcias face that graces the cover, as ragged and endearing as fan favorite 'Pinkerton', as bold and hooky and open as "Pork and Beans". In other words, 'Hurley' is in the classic tradition of the best Weezer albums, clever and confessional and quirky and hugely sing along.
