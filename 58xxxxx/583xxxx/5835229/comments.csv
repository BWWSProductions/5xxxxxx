,Nitram1955,2010-09-19T21:48Z,"Download - OK
Tutorial - OK
Installation - OK
Patch - OK
After launching any scanning - the app disappears from the screen and its icon in the tray goes grey, saying ""Removed from memory"".
Is this behavior OK?"
,Nitram1955,2010-09-19T22:33Z,"Actually it says:
Service part of the program was unallocated from computer memory.
What does it mean? I can't finish any scanning.
How can I prevent the unallocation?"

,TheDepandable,2010-09-29T13:09Z,Does anybody have the solution to the problem posted by Nitram1955? I suffer the same as him and arulkarthik
,RebelRick,2010-10-02T04:54Z,I had the same problem as Nitram1955 on Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit but had no problems at all scanning on Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit that I'm using right now.On the 64 bit system I am using Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 with the Kaspersky key exploit v0.53 and have no problems with that so this Pure patch must not do well with 64 bit systems.WHO KNOWS?!Let us all know if you do.
,sandipani,2010-11-11T14:27Z,is this going to work with latest pure version 9.1.0.124
