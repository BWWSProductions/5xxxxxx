IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Russian dvd9 .............Thanks guys
AUDIO:iNK - Prism................. Thanks and top work :)
Here we go with our encode, adding it to the 10 out already :P
Well for this we used the 5gig + dvdr and ripped the video and filter it using a script and some of the filters in vdub.
The main things we did was made it brighter, reduced some chroma, made it sharper, also tweaked the rgb colours aswell as using a white balance.
Audio wise ... full credit goes to ink and prism, we just muxed their audio to our encode.
