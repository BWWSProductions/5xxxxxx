,seedammit,2010-09-15T23:08Z,"I'm gonna wait for reviews for this game to come out before I download it.

I've got too many games I wanna play and not enough time to waste on mediocre games, this one looks good, but I'm gonna wait and see"

,NitrogenUA,2010-09-15T23:31Z,"Tested Online mode via psnlover - works fine. Also, Data Install works for me. Missed the first PhantasySP, but this one could be a nice MMO =)"
,pretoman,2010-09-16T13:56Z,"Tested and worked on psp 3006 5.03gen-c
Nice game"
,miktran,2010-09-16T18:06Z,"doesn´t work on M33-6, I will evaluate now upgrading to GEN"
,miktran,2010-09-16T18:34Z,"Now updated my PSP 200x to 5.50 GEN-D3
but the game only works after instalation of Prometheus2"
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-16T21:16Z,"
pretoman, yepp. So far this is full iso. Cinematics and music - all in place. I should had specify an uncompressed filesize - it is over 1.1 gig. Gotta remember that for next releases. Thanks.

miktran, strange, this works on mine PSP-200x 5.50 GEN-D3 without any prometheus. Using Sony NP9660 UMD mode. Either way, i'm glad you got it working. Cheers."
,enzoboycombo,2010-09-17T17:20Z,"help me...i have a 5.50 GEN-D3.....
its not working...i've downloaded 2 phantasy star 2 already...none worked....

sorry to bother just a newbie"

http://www.psp-hacks.com/2010/06/20/cfw-5-50-prometheus-released-for-psp-1000-psp-2000-models/

prometheus seplugin i play it fine"
,enzoboycombo,2010-09-18T01:27Z,will i DL promethues or custom firm ware
,enzoboycombo,2010-09-18T01:31Z,i downloaded prometheus what will get and where will i put it
,Fenris8969,2010-09-18T21:10Z,Anyone got a link for the manual scan download? You can only learn so much from the tutorials and online.
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-18T23:58Z,"enzoboycombo, look closely, there is a manual by the link that Jayzen_Freeze pointed out:
""Install 5.50 Prometheus by simply copying the extracted archive directory to ms0:/PSP/GAME and running it from the XMB, like any other homebrew. The required files to run 6.20-required games will be copied to the appropriate spot and then you’re all set.""

Good luck."
,Fenris8969,2010-09-19T21:13Z,"Forgot to include, this works on my PSP2001 5.50Gen-A Full and my friends PSP1000 with 5.50Gen-A Full as well."
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-20T03:07Z,"Fenris8969, i've just formed private online party and took some time to learn things from NPC. Now i know almost everything i wanted about PhSP's game mechanics. It is common thing when developers put all the crucial info into NPCs. Good luck."
,JIHUIN,2010-09-22T08:06Z,"Thanks a lot...I tested the game on CFW 5.50 GEN-D3 and works perfectly great...but when I test it in 5.50 GEN-B (full) the icon and the menu of the game will appear but once you start the new game the screen will turn black and your PSP will shutdown. In other words, this game is for 5.50 GEN-D3 only...any FIX to run this on 5.50 GEN-B and 5.00 M-33?"
,killboxalpha,2010-09-22T11:20Z,"Working on my phat PSP M33-6

Thanks again"
,thovader,2010-10-02T14:15Z,"Thank you very much for the upload!
Works great on my PSP (fat) with 5.50 GEN-D3!"
,tat2darms,2010-10-09T23:29Z,Nitrogen you kick ASS!
,miktran,2010-11-07T02:48Z,"If it doesn´t work on your PSP M33-6 , there are 2 options: 
- Install Prometheus for M33-6 (which sometimes mess with old save games)
- Use plug-in M33_620.prx , which seems best option for this game (as you can enable/disable plugin anytime)"
,ravenis13,2010-11-21T02:45Z,please seeds need it asap
