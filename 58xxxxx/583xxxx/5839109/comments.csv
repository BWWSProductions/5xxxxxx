But can i ask why do you guys make torrents?
you pay for going to the cinema (which is fun though)
you pay for DVDS Blurays but what for?
you make the torrent paid like 20 euro for the bluray disc..

And you get nothing for that in return so WHY?
just for fun or not?"

Oke i paid the provider and i pay for newsgroups but that,s al the rest is all free.

So we can bring you the movies for free. But if you realy like a movie you can always buy it.
That,s what i do. 

Greeting Linday"
