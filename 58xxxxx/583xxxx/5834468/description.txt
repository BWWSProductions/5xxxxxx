And finally I finished scanning the last two Legends of Percevan books. The series are still coming out in french, but these books cover the french books 7-12, and the french book 13 only just came out, so wont see more in english till book 15 is out I guess :).

This is one of my favorite childhood books, and they are finally being released in english, so grab it, and enjoy. And remember to buy the book, to ensure the rest of the series will be out, its a VERY reasonably priced 20$ or less for a 160 page hardcover.
