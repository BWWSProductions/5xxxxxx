,Damien74,2010-09-19T05:39Z,"pkaji123: you're an idiot. Stop lying.

aidandabest09: you have to disconnect your internet. When Kaspersky can't connect you will get the choice to manually add key. Don't forget to remove old one first."

,kanp,2010-09-19T15:02Z,"Nice Trick to buy 3user 1 year kaspersky genuine license very cheap @15~16$ only!-

buy kaspersky from www.ebay.in as Indian distribution of Kaspersky version is very cheap.

You may ask seller to mail you the activation code through email rather than shipping the CD.

I have helped my many friends by this way who are living outside from India.

Enjoy."
