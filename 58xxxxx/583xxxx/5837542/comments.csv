,TheNikko,2010-09-19T17:46Z,"WORKS on m3 ds simply (and other r4 clones) if you turn off reset in game (wood r4 fw)!!

,fakebest,2010-09-19T20:34Z,"these pokemon torrents for black and white are not fake they just are new and like most new ds games you need it to be patched for your card or an update for your card which might not be available yet also these are Japanese making them useless to English speaking people ( I really don't see why English does not come out at the same time or before seeing how there is a such a big market for it) English version will be out by next spring, summer at the latest."
,TheNikko,2010-09-19T21:00Z,"i agree, the localization could have gone faster, but i don't complain. i already did diamond in japanese completely on my own, so i expect to do this too. its not hard, its actually better, as it makes the games harder.
also, there seems to be something wrong with the c gear thing you get from makomo. i guess it tries to initialize ir, which our flashcards don't have. so just say no to any questions regarding the c gear"
,sllim126,2010-09-20T03:04Z,"Something that I found that helps speed up the game in DeSmuME is to change the frame rate

Config > Frame Skip > 1

It I'm pretty sure it makes it skip every other frame, but it really sped up my game, hope it works for you"
