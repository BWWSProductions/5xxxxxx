PrisM NOTES:
Right, loaded video into dgindex made .d2v then made .avs script... added a brightness filter and sharpness script onto it, then loaded into vdubmod, lowered the red a touch and added slight yellow, tweaked the saturation to try and remove some of that orange... done some other slight touches also, overall it looks pretty good... for the audio we filtered lap's, created a LFE bass channel, center channel, and used russians 5.1 surround channel for the english surround channel... so it's nice 5.1 Audio... Enjoy the brilliant movie ;)
