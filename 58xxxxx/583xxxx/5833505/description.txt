Windows Internet Explorer 9 (abbreviated as IE9) is the upcoming version of the Internet Explorer web browser from Microsoft. It is currently available in open beta, released September 15, 2010.

IE9 will have complete or nearly complete support for all CSS 3 selectors, border-radius CSS 3 property, faster JavaScript, and embedded ICC v2 or v4 color profiles support via Windows Color System. IE9 will feature hardware-accelerated graphics rendering using Direct2D, hardware accelerated text rendering using DirectWrite, hardware accelerated video rendering using Media Foundation, imaging support provided by Windows Imaging Component, and high fidelity printing powered by the XPS print pipeline.[1]

IE9 also supports the HTML5 video and audio tags and the Web Open Font Format.[2] Some industry experts claim that Microsoft will release IE9 as a major out-of-band version that is not tied to any particular version of Windows.[3]

The system requirements for IE9 are Windows 7 or Windows Vista SP2 (with Platform Update and IE8); Windows XP is not supported.[4][5]
