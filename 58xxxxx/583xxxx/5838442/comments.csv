Great quality torrent. Don't know why it has any -1's. People need to learn how to get the proper codecs.

Compared this with: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6104870/The.Prestige.2006.720p.BluRay.x264-ESiR

Watched both on 50"" Tv, and one on top of the other at exact same sound levels and time. Couldn't see any differences. Chose this torrent and deleted the other 4+ GB file. Still gave both +1 for being great torrents. Neon SHOULD put more info into film's description like other U'lders. So we can quickly compare. Thanks regardless. Great torrent

,kingjoser,2012-06-03T06:15Z,Audio way too low
,ironymon,2012-06-06T20:38Z,"SPOILER DON'T READ BELOW


The end explanation is mind boggling. So basically, he teleports there but leaves a copy of himself at the same spot, yet, he can't know if he did the teleport or his copy, neither can he tell difference cause they both have same memory.. even when he said DON't he still shot, and he can't know if he's a clone or not, i say he's clone since at least 2nd teleport lool."
