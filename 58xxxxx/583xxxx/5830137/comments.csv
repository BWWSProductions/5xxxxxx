,principlemajor,2010-09-14T23:54Z,"Why some names are repeated too much in both the males and females section?
Also some male names are mentioned in the female section.
Example: in female section 538 is Hanifa and in male section, it's the same at 568 but spelled as Hanifah."
,diablogoa,2010-09-15T05:31Z,The reason for repetition is that in Arabic language if you pronounce a word little different (different spelling) it has a different meaning. But if you still find the exact repetitions please try to ignore them and move forward. No human can be completely error free.
,emmemmess,2010-09-15T06:41Z,"Boys and Girls names in each others sections... and you call that an ""error""??

Nah, its either a deliberate ""error"" to mislead or a lack of knowledge.

Either way, its not worth downloading if someone might end up giving a child a different gender name!!

Shame... kill the torrent please."
,emmemmess,2010-09-15T06:44Z,"Just noticed, its your only upload... figured it right then - not worth downloading!!

There are plenty websites with correct guidelines, spellings, and gender - ALL FREE!!!"
,diablogoa,2010-09-15T09:54Z,"I am not here to argue and neither is it a deliberate ""error"". I myself have collected all these names from reliable Islamic websites. Its only that they don't have all the names in a single file but many webpages each having some 50 names. I just collected all the names and made a single file to make it easy for printing or reference. The websites are searchtruth and guidedways (.com) which you can check for yourself. Its my only upload, yes, as everyone starts with first one. And i found it worth sharing so I uploaded it. Still if you don't like it, just delete the file and search on the wide web for yourself. I am sure you will get the correct guidelines at many places InshaAllah. I made this file because at first I also tried to search on web and on torrent sites a single file with all the names in it. I got a torrent but it was dead so I thought better to do some work and collect all the names, make a single file and upload it myself for others. 
Still I like healthy criticism, it makes you better and better. So thanks for the comments and finding mistakes."

,logtran001,2010-10-17T12:29Z,"Thanks for the list.  

And bodthedog is an OBVIOUS retard and asshole.  But I'm curious why someone who knows that Israel is racist and Apartheid has a problem with Islam, nobody knows the evil of Israel better than Muslims."
,scottsasse,2010-11-14T00:05Z,"Oh shit thanks for this! This torrent made me realize that I accidently named my baby girl a boys name. So i just set her on fire and will make my wives give me new baby with right name after I beat them up!! Thanks, good day, come again, allah akBOOM!!!"
