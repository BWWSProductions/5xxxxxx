* According to French wine laws, it is forbidden to include the word â€œChampagneâ€ in the title of sparkling wines, unless it is made in Champagne, France.
* â€œGuaroâ€ is a liquor or brandy made from sugar cane in Costa Rica. It is a shortened name for â€œaguardiente de canaâ€.
* Three toasts are common in Belgium: Cheers, Sante (French) and Gezondheid (Dutch).
* In Wales, the term â€œPubâ€ came from the Public Houses, where town folk would socialize and resolve disputes.
* There are no restrictions on carrying alcohol in public in Jamaica.
* As tequila ages it takes its color from the oak barrels in which it sits. The longer it ages, the darker the color.
* The legal drinking age in Ireland is eighteen (18).
* The national beer of Belize is Belikin. However, although there are 500,000 bottles manufactured every year, it is difficult to find outside of Belize. Only 24,000 bottles are exported a month and they are all exported to Los Angeles, CA.
