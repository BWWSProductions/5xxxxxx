Owen Pallett follows his critically acclaimed album Heartland with an EP of brand new material. A Swedish Love Story brims with pop melodies, sweeping strings and joyous emotion. From the opening trackâ€™s propulsive rhythm and soaring vocals, to the taut and energetic strings of "Scandal at the parkade", into the gorgeous and epic closer "Donâ€™t stop", the A Swedish Love Story EP is a stunning mini-masterpiece.

A Swedish Love Story will be released on 10" and digital on the 27th of September. It's available for pre-order now from the Domino Mart.

Here's the tracklist:
01. A man with no ankles
02. Scandal at the parkade
03. Honour the dead, or else
04. Donâ€™t stop




Here's what Owen has to say about A Swedish Love Story:
To contrast Heartland's convoluted record process, and also to cut myself a break, I recorded this EP in New York City over a week, using not much more than my violin, my Moog, a bass and a drum kit. It's closer in sound to my first album Has A Good Home than anything else. It's called A Swedish Love Story in tribute to one of my favourite films En Karlekshistoria and as a love letter to the Swedish pop stars who inspired it. This is probably the most posi record I'll ever make, enjoy the mood while it lasts.
