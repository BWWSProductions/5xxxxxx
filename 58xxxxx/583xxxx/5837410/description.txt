      "Lively Up Yourself" is the opening track on Bob Marley&The Wailers 1973 album  "African Herbsman".
"African Herbsman" is a compilation of The Wailers songs, released by Trojan Records in 1973, shortly after their major-label debut album "Catch a Fire" had been released by Island Records.This album is a collection of some of the songs that The Wailers recorded in Jamaica together with producer Lee Perry from 1970 to 1971, before they received international recognition. Included are also two of the group's self-productions, "Trenchtown Rock" and "Lively Up Yourself", that both had been big hits in Jamaica.
      "Man in the Hills" is a reggae album by Jamaican musician Burning Spear (Winston Rodney), released in 1976 on Island Records.It is a simple and unadorned album, with songs that reminisce about Spear's childhood in St. Anne's Bay, Jamaica."Man in the Hills", the titular album opener evokes the superiority of rural living over urban. In Jamaican history, the roots of radical protest, a national identity and the Rastafari movement, grew from communities formed by escaped slaves in the hills and (after emancipation in 1838) the so-called "Free Villages".
      "Legalize It" is an album by Peter Tosh. It was his debut album as a solo artist. The album was recorded at Treasure Isle and Randy's, Kingston, Jamaica in 1975 and released in 1976.
      "Get Up, Stand Up" is a reggae song written by Bob Marley and Peter Tosh.The song originally appeared on The Wailers' 1973 album "Burnin'". It was recorded and played live in numerous versions by The Wailers and Bob Marley & The Wailers, along with solo versions by Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer The song was frequently performed at Marley's concerts, often as the last song. "Get Up, Stand Up" was also the last song Marley ever performed on stage, on September 23, 1980 at the Stanley Theater in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
      Althea & Donna were a Jamaican reggae singing duo, best known for their 1977 single "Uptown Top Ranking" which was a number one hit in the United Kingdom in 1978.  It was produced by Joe Gibbs using a re-recording of the riddim of the 1967 Alton Ellis' song "I'm Still In Love", which had already been re-popularised in the 1970s by Marcia Aitken's cover "I'm Still In Love With You Boy" and the deejay track "Three Piece Suit" by Trinity, to which "Uptown" was an 'answer record'. They released the album of the same name in 1978, on which they are backed by The Revolutionaries, on the Virgin Records subsidiary Front Line, and several more singles, but never met with any more tangible success thereafter.
     Judy Mowatt started her career as part of the all-female singing group, The Gaylettes in 1967. In 1974, she got her big break by joining Bob Marley's backing vocal trio the "I-Threes".Mowatt is also a solo artist who has released albums such as 1980s  "Black Woman".
     "Johnny B. Goode" is a 1958 rock and roll song composed by Chuck Berry. It is one of Berry's most important songs, being listed #7 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. "Johnny B. Goode" is among the most widely covered rock and roll songs in history.

01. AFRICAN TRADITIONAL MUSIC   ( deep roots )  

         African music has been a major factor in the shaping of what we know today as blues and jazz. These styles have all borrowed from African rhythms and sounds, brought over the Atlantic ocean by slaves.

 02.  BLUES   

           Important source of modern rock'n'roll, absolutely essential to the sound we think of as 60's rock, was, first, the Blues. Blues has evolved from an unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of African-American slaves (imported from West Africa; principally present day Mali, Senegal, the Gambia and Ghana).
           Blues began as the music of black sharecroppers in the poor cotton-farming region of the Mississippi Delta, and traveled north to Chicago with the sharecroppers as thousands of them moved north in search of a better life. It was in Chicago that the blues went from acoustic solo guitar music to electric guitar-electric bass-drums combos.
            Blues can be subdivided into several subgenres ranging from country to urban blues that were more or less popular during different periods of the 20th century. Best known are the Delta, Piedmont, Jump and Chicago blues styles. In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called blues rock evolved.


02.01  Delta Blues artists - Prewar blues : 
 
             The Delta blues is one of the earliest styles of blues music. Guitar and harmonica are the dominant instruments used. "Delta blues" is a style as much as a geographical appellation: Skip James and Elmore James, who were not born in the Delta, were considered Delta blues musicians. Performers traveled throughout the Mississippi Delta, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Tennessee. Eventually, Delta blues spread out across the country, giving rise to a host of regional variations, including "Chicago blues" and "Detroit blues". Muddy Waters, Little Milton, B.B. King, and Howlin' Wolf were just a few of these important Chicago blues artists.

02.02   Early post-war blues :

          After World War II and in the 1950s, new styles of electric blues music became popular in cities such as Chicago, Detroit and St. Louis. Electric blues used amplified electric guitars, electric bass, drums, and harmonica played through a microphone. Chicago became a center for electric blues in the early 1950s. Chicago blues is influenced to a large extent by the Mississippi blues style, because many performers had migrated from the Mississippi region. Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, and Jimmy Reed were all born in Mississippi and moved to Chicago during the Great Migration.

03 . JAZZ  &  SWING BANDS 
  
              A jazz band (or jazz ensemble) is a musical ensemble that plays jazz music usually without a conductor. Jazz bands usually consist of a rhythm section and a horn section. The rhythm section of a jazz band consists of the percussion, double bass or bass guitar, and usually at least one instrument capable of playing chords, such as a piano, guitar,The horn section consists of wind and brass instruments, which play the melody and main accompaniment. Typical horns found in a big jazz band include 4 to 5 trumpets, saxophones (2-3 altos, 2 tenors, and a baritone), 3-4 trombones, and a bass trombone. 
              Swing music, also known as swing jazz or simply swing, is a form of jazz music that developed in the early 1930s and had solidified as a distinctive style by 1935 in the United States. Swing uses a strong anchoring rhythm section which supports a lead section that can include brass instruments, including trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophones and clarinets or stringed instruments including violin and guitar; medium to fast tempos; and a "lilting" swing time rhythm. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise a new melody over the arrangement. 
             Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, and Duke Ellington's bands are some of the most famous. Except for Duke Ellington, all those bands were primarily dance bands, with big swinging backbeats.

          Roaring Twenties is a phrase used to describe the 1920s, principally in North America, that emphasizes the period's social, artistic, and cultural dynamism.It was the age of prohibition, it was the age of prosperity, and it was the age of downfall.It was the decade of bath tub gin, the model T, the $5 work day, the first transatlantic flight, and the movie.  At the same time, amusement, fun and lightness were cultivated in jazz and dancing, in defiance of the horrors of World War I, which remained present in people's minds. In music, the three sounds were jazz, jazz, and jazz. The period is also often called "The Jazz Age".

05. COUNTRY MUSIC 

            Country music (or country and western) is a blend of popular musical forms originally found in the Southern United States and the Appalachian Mountains (Tennessee, Virginia, West Wirginia, and Kentucky). It has roots in traditional folk music, Celtic music, gospel music, and old-time music and evolved rapidly in the 1920s.

05.01. Early recorded country music 

            The first commercial recording of what can be considered country music was "Sallie Gooden" by fiddlist A.C. Robertson in 1922. Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family are widely considered to be important early country musicians. Rodgers fused hillbilly country, gospel, jazz, blues, pop, cowboy, and folk; and many of his best songs were his compositions, including â€œBlue Yodelâ€, which sold over a million records and established Rodgers as the premier singer of early country music.

05.02 Country music 1930s-1960s

            Many musicians performed and recorded songs in any number of styles. During the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or Western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood. Some of the popular singing cowboys from the era were Gene Autry, the Sons of the Pioneers and Roy Rogers .Country musicians began recording Boogie in 1939. During World WarII, honky tonk country was popularized by Ernest Tubb ("I'm Walking The Floor Over You"), who took the sound to Nashville, where he was the first musician to play electric guitar on Grand Ole Opry. In the 1950s, honky tonk entered its golden age, with the massive popularity of Webb Pierce, Hank Locklin, Lefty Frizzell, George Jones, and Hank Williams.
           By the end of World War II, many musicians performed music known as bluegrass .In the post-war period, country music was called "folk" in the trades, and "hillbilly" within the industry.In 1944, Billboard replaced the term "hillbilly" with "folk songs and blues," and switched to "country" or "country and western" in 1949 . Gospel music, too, remained a popular component of country music.

          06.02  ROCK AND ROLL & ROCKABILLY 

          Rock and roll  is a genre of popular music that evolved in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Its roots lay mainly in blues, rhythm and blues, country, folk, gospel, and jazz. The style subsequently spread to the rest of the world and developed further, leading ultimately to modern rock music. 
          Rockabilly is one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music, and emerged in the early 1950s. The term rockabilly is a portmanteau of rock and hillbilly, the latter a reference to the country music (often called hillbilly music in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style's development. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues. Many  popular rock and roll singers of the time, such as Fats Domino, Chuck Berry and Little Richard, came out of the black rhythm and blues tradition, making the music attractive to white audiences, and are not usually classed as "rockabilly".

        Rockabilly Revival early 1970s  (return to the simple, loud, fast, emotionally-direct music of early rock and roll).

Other musicians turned back to the original rock and roll music of the 1950s for inspiration, and in the late 1970s, an underground rockabilly revival began to emerge.

06.04. DOO-WOP 

           Doo-wop is a style of vocal-based rhythm and blues music, which developed in African-American communities in the 1940s and which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1950s and 1960s With its smooth, consonant vocal harmonies, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&B styles of the 1950s and 1960s.. There is confusion regarding which recording was the "first" to contain the phrase "doo-wop". There is general acknowledgement that the first hit record to use the syllables "doo-wop" in the refrain was the 1955 hit, "When You Dance" by The Turbans, in which the chant "doo-wop" can clearly be heard . Important African American doo-wop groups included The Marcels, The Coasters, The Drifters, The Moonglows, Clovers,  â€˜Little Anthony and the Imperials,The "5" Royales , The Flamingos , The Dells, The Cadillacs, The Midnighters and The Platters.

06.05. SOUL MUSIC 

         Soul music has its roots in gospel music and rhythm and blues. The hard gospel vocal quartets of the 1940s and 1950s were big influences on major soul singers of the 1960s. Many consider the birthplace of soul music to be northern United States inner cities, particularly Chicago. Other cities, such as New York, Detroit, Memphis and Florence, quickly followed, creating their own soul styles based on their regional gospel roots. Sam Cook, Ray Charles Solomon Burke, Little Richard, James Brown,Fats Domino and  Aretha Franklin  are considered to be one of the pioneers and founders of soul music.

07.01.00.  BRITISH ROCK IN THE 1960s 

          British rock describes a wide variety of forms of music made in the United Kingdom. Since around 1964, with the "British Invasion" of the United States spearheaded by The Beatles, British rock music has had a considerable impact on the development of American music and rock music across the world. British rock has produced many of the most significant groups and performers in rock music internationally, and has initiated or significantly developed many of the most influential sub-genres, including beat music, progressive rock, heavy metal music, punk, post punk, new romanticism, and indie rock.


07.01.01  BRITISH BEAT BANDS, BEATLEMANIA AND THE â€œBRITISH INVASIONâ€

       British beat is a rock music genre that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s. Beat music is a fusion of rock and roll, doo wop, skiffle, R&B and soul. The beat movement provided most of the bands responsible for the British invasion of the American pop charts in the period after 1964, and provided the model for many important developments in pop and rock music.
      Beatlemania is a term that originated during the 1960s to describe the intense fan frenzy directed toward The Beatles during the early years of their success, particularly by teenage girls. The word is a portmanteau of "Beatles" and "mania". Andi Lothian, a former Scottish music promoter, claims that he coined the term while speaking to a reporter at the Caird Hall Beatles concert that took place as part of the Beatles Mini-Tour of Scotland, on 7 October 1963,
        On 7 February 1964, the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite ran a story about The  Beatles' United States arrival in which the correspondent said "The British Invasion this time     goes by the code name Beatlemania". Other acts that were part of the "invasion" included 
Peter and Gordon, The Animals, Manfred Mann, Petula Clark, Freddie and the Dreamers, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, Herman's Hermits, The Rolling Stones, The Troggs,  Donovan ,The Who, The Kinks, and The Dave Clark Five;

07.02.00  AMERICAN  ROCK  IN THE 1960s

       American rock is rock music from the United States.  During the 1960s, pychedelic rock dominated the later half of the decade with bands such as The Doors, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, and The Jimi Hendrix Experience obtaining success. Other artists to achieve success included folk rocker Bob Dylan, surf rock band The Beach Boys, and southern rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival.


07.02.01.  SURF MUSIC 

         Surf music is a genre of popular music associated with surf culture, particularly Orange County and other areas of Southern California. It was particularly popular between 1961 and 1965, has subsequently been revived and was highly influential on subsequent rock music. Although beginning as a purely instrumental form, surf music achieved its greatest commercial success as vocal music. Most associated with this movement were the Beach Boys. Other vocal surf acts followed, including one-hit wonders like Ronny & the Daytonas with "G. T. O." (1964) and the Rip Chords with "Hey Little Cobra", which both reached the top ten, but the only other act to achieve sustained success with the formula were Jan & Dean, who had a number 1 hit with "Surf City".

07.02.02  FOLK AND COUNTRY ROCK 

         Folk rock is a musical genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. The genre was pioneered  by the Los Angeles band The Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and Bob Dylan penned material with rock instrumentation, in a style heavily influenced by The Beatles and other British bands. The term "folk rock" was itself first used by the U.S. music press to describe The Byrds' music in June 1965, the same month that the band's debut album was issued. Inspired by British psychedelic folk and the North-American style of folk rock, Pentangle, Fairport, and other related bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire.

07.03.00.  BRITISH BLUES BOOM  ( late 1950s and early 1960s )

         In parallel with beat music, in the late 1950s and early 1960s a British blues scene was developing recreating the sounds of American R&B and later particularly the sounds of bluesmen Robert Johnson, Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters. Initially led by purist blues followers such as Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies, it reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1960s, when it developed a distinctive and influential style dominated by electric guitar and made international stars of several proponents of the genre including The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, Eric Clapton, Fleetwood Mac and Led Zeppelin. A number of these moved through Blues-rock to different forms of rock music, with increasing emphasis on technical virtuosity and improvisational skills. As a result British blues helped to form many of the sub-genres of rock, including psychedelic rock and heavy metal music. Since then direct interest in the blues in Britain has declined, but many of the key performers have returned to it in recent years, new acts have emerged and there have been a renewed interest in the genre.

07.04.00.  BLUES ROCK AND HARD ROCK IN THE 1960s


         Blues-rock is a hybrid musical genre combining bluesy improvisations over the 12-bar blues and extended boogie jams with rock and roll styles. The style began to develop in the mid-1960s in England and the United States, While the early blues-rock bands "attempted to play long, involved improvisations which were commonplace on jazz records", by the 1970s, blues rock got heavier and more riff-based. By the "early '70s, the lines between blues-rock and hard rock were barely visible"

         Hard rock (or heavy rock) is a loosely defined genre of rock music which has its earliest roots in mid-1960s garage, blues rock and psychedelic rock. It is typified by a heavy use of distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and sometimes pianos and keyboards. One of the major influences of hard rock is blues music. American and British rock bands began to modify rock and roll, adding to the standard genre harder sounds, heavier guitar riffs, bombastic drumming and louder vocals. This sound created the basis for hard rock. Hard rock emerged with groups of the late-1960s, such as The Who, Deep Purple, Iron Butterfly, Blue Cheer, Vanilla Fudge, and Led Zeppelin who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock.
         Later, Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock, which combined elements of jazz, blues and rock and roll. He was one of the first guitarists to experiment with new guitar effects like phasing, feedback and distortion, after guitarists such as Link Wray, Dave Davies of the Kinks, Pete Townshend of The Who, Eric Clapton of Cream and Jeff Beck of The Yardbirds.

07.05.00.  PSYCHODELIC POP AND ROCK 

           Psychedelic rock evolved in the 60s as an offshoot of the rock and roll movement combining elements of pop,rock, electronic music, eastern influences - particularly sitars, and other diverse elements. Inspired by the use of mind altering drugs like cannabis, mescaline, psilocybin, and especially LSD, psychedelic rock broke with traditional rock and laid the roots for Krautrock and experimental rock genres of the seventies and eighties. Psychedelic music could be interpreted as simply a "surreal and dreamy feeling" in a particular song, instead of a specific genre with rules to follow. In some cases, this simply requires writing one coherent song, then to experiment recording that song in the studio while under "psychedelic influence", yielding very surreal musical results.
        Psychedelic pop is a musical style inspired by the harder, louder songs of psychedelic rock but applied more to a pop music setting.

07.06.00.  THE JIMI HENDRIX STORY 

        Jimi Hendrix is often considered to be the greatest electric guitarist in the history of rock music. After initial success in Europe, he achieved fame in the United States following his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. Later, Hendrix headlined the iconic 1969 Woodstock Festival and the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. Hendrix often favored raw overdriven amplifiers with high gain and treble and helped develop the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback. Hendrix was one of the musicians who popularized the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock which he often used to deliver an exaggerated pitch in his solos, particularly with high bends and use of legato. He was influenced by blues artists such as B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Albert King, and Elmore James, rhythm and blues and soul guitarists Curtis Mayfield, Steve Cropper, as well as by funk and some modern jazz.
       Hendrix synthesized many styles - hard rock, blues-rock, acid rock, psychedelic rock, funk rock and  blues, in creating his musical voice and his guitar style was unique.      
       Hendrix won many of the most prestigious rock music awards in his lifetime, and has been posthumously awarded many more, including being inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Hendrix was ranked number 3 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock behind Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. Hendrix was ranked number 3 on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of Rock N' Roll, behind the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. He has been voted by Rolling Stone, Guitar World, and a number of other magazines and polls as the best electric guitarist of all time. Guitar World's readers voted six of Hendrix's solos among the top "100 Greatest" of all time: "Purple Haze" , "The Star-Spangled Banner" , "Machine Gun" , "Little Wing", "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)" and "All Along the Watchtowerâ€.

 07.09.00  SOUL MUSIC 

          Soul music is a music genre originating in the United States combining elements of gospel music and rhythm and blues.The genre occasionally uses improvisational additions, twirls and auxiliary sounds. Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and plastic body moves, are an important feature. Other characteristics are  "a call and response" between the soloist and the chorus, and an especially tense vocal sound.
          Subgenres of Soul music : Detroit soul,  Deep soul and southern soul, Memphis soul, New Orleans soul, Chicago soul, Philadelphia soul, Psychedelic soul, Country soul,  Blue-eyed soul and Brown-eyed soul 
                    



07.09.01  DETROIT SOUL  (The Motown Sound) 

             is a style of soul music with a distinct pop influence.

07.09.02  SOUTHERN SOUL 

           Southern soul is a type of soul music that emerged from the Southern United States and originated from a combination of styles, including blues, country and western, early rock and roll, and a strong gospel influence. The focus of the music was not on its lyrics, but on the "feel" or the groove. This rhythmic force made it a strong influence in the rise of funk music. It has also been tagged deep soul or even country soul. Southern soul is often identified with artists like Professor Longhair, Allen Toussaint, Lee Dorsey, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Joe Tex, James Brown, Isaac Hayes, Carla Thomas, The Staple Singers, Sam and Dave and many others.
         Memphis soul is stylish, funky, uptown soul music that is not as hard edged as Southern soul. The Memphis soul sound was similar to the related Motown Sound from Detroit Michigan. After the rise of disco in the late 1970s, Memphis soul declined somewhat in popularity.
Stax Records, founded in 1957, was a major factor in the creation of the Southern soul and Memphis soul music styles.

07.09.03  PSYHODELIC SOUL  

            is a concept used to categorize music that features elements of psychedelic rock and soul/funk music. This kind of music thrived during the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Psychedelic soul is often connected to artists such as Sly & the Family Stone and Funkadelic. Others, most notably The Temptations and their producer Norman Whitfield, War, The Undisputed Truth, and The 5th Dimension,followed the path laid out by the work of Sly Stone and his band. Psychedelic soul led the way for a harder, less subdued sound to permeate through black music, leading the way for the mainstream funk music of the early 1970s and later, disco.

08. THE SEVENTIES  (the decade of 1970-1979)
  
             One of the first events of the 70s was the break up of the Beatles in 1970. However, the seventies were also when many legendary rock bands started, or hit their peak, including Queen, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Lynyrd Skynyrd, AC/DC, Fleetwood Mac, Status Quo, Free, Aerosmith, the Eagles, Black Sabbath, Kiss, Heart, The Who, The Doors, Uriah Heep, and Van Halen, to name a few. The first half of the 1970s saw many jazz musicians from the Miles Davis school achieve cross-over success through jazz-rock fusion. Art rock, progressive rock and  glam rock were also popular. One of the most successful European groups of the decade was the quartet ABBA. The Swedish group, first found fame when they won the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest. To many people, the Seventies will be most remembered for the rise in disco music.The mid-seventies saw the rise of punk music from its protopunk/garage band roots in the 1960s and early 1970s. Towards the end of the decade, Jamaican reggae music, already popular in the Caribbean and Africa since the early 1970s, became very popular in the U.S. and in Europe.

08.01  ROCK MUSIC  

             or simply rock -  is a loosely defined genre of popular music that developed during and after the 1960s. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll and rockabilly, which themselves evolved from rhythm and blues, country music and other influences. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, rock music developed different subgenres  such as pop rock, soft rock, glam rock, hard rock, heavy metal, progressive rock, and punk rock. When it was blended with folk music it created folk rock, with blues to create blues-rock and with jazz, to create jazz-rock fusion. In the 1970s, rock incorporated influences from soul, funk, and latin music.

08.02. PROGRESSIVE  ROCK 

            Progressive rock is a subgenre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s as part of a "mostly British attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibilityâ€
Music critic Piero Scaruffi states that the "bands that nurtured prog-rock through its early stages were Traffic, Jeff Beck, Family, Jethro Tull, and Genesis; while King Crimson, Yes, and Van der Graaf Generator represent the genre at its apex"..Bands had formed by the end of the 1960s, including The Moody Blues (1964), Pink Floyd (1965), Soft Machine (1966), Barclay James Harvest (1966), Gong (1967), Genesis (1967), Jethro Tull (1967), The Nice (1967), Yes (1968), Caravan (1968), King Crimson (1969), Supertramp (1969) and Gentle Giant (1969). Although almost all of these bands were from the UK, the genre was growing popular elsewhere in continental Europe. Triumvirat led Germany's significant progressive rock movement, while Tangerine Dream, Faust, Can and Neu! led the related Berlin School and Krautrock movements. Focus and Trace formed in the Netherlands, France produced Ange, Gong, and Magma. Spain produced numerous prog groups, including Canarios and Triana. Scandinavia was represented by: Norwegian band Popol Vuh, Swedish band Kaipa and Finnish band Wigwam. Progressive rock's popularity peaked in the mid-1970s. By this time, several North American progressive rock bands had been formed. Kansas, which had actually existed in one form or another since 1971, became one of the most commercially successful of all progressive rock bands.

08.03	 BLUES ROCK AND SOUTHERN ROCK 

          Blues-rock is a hybrid musical genre combining bluesy improvisations over the 12-bar blues and extended boogie jams with rock and roll styles. The style began to develop in the mid-1960s in England and the United States, as what Piero Scaruffi called, a "genre of rhythm'n'blues played by white European musicians".
         American blues-rock had been pioneered in the early 1960s by guitarist Lonnie Mack, but the genre began to take off in the mid-60s as acts followed developed a sound similar to British blues musicians. Key acts included Paul Butterfield (whose band acted like Mayall's Bluesbreakers in Britain as a starting point for many successful musicians), Canned Heat, the early Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Johnny Winter, The J. Geils Band and Jimi Hendrix with his power trios, The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Band of Gypsys, whose guitar virtuosity and showmanship would be among the most emulated of the decade.
         By the 1970s blues-rock had become heavier and more riff-based, exemplified by the work of Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, and the lines between blues-rock and hard rock "were barely visible

       Blues-rock bands like Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd and eventually ZZ Top from the southern states, incorporated country elements into their style to produce distinctive Southern rock.

08.04. FOLK ROCK AND COUNTRY ROCK

       Folk rock is a musical genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. The term "folk rock" was itself first used by the U.S. music press to describe The Byrds' music in June 1965, the same month that the band's debut album was issued.  Dylan himself was also influential on the genre, particularly his recordings with an electric rock band on the Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde albums. Dylan's July 25, 1965 appearance at the Newport Folk Festival with an electric backing band is also considered a pivotal moment in the development of folk rock
       Country rock is sub-genre of rock music , formed from the fusion of rock with country. The term is generally used to refer to the wave of rock musicians who began to record country-flavored records in the late 1960s and early 1970s, beginning with Bob Dylan,  Poco , New Riders of the Purple Sage,   Nitty Gritty Dirt Band ,Doobie Brothers and The Byrds ; reaching its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists like Emmylou Harris and the Eagles;

08.06   HARD ROCK ( heavy rock )

           Hard Rock  is a sub-genre of rock music which has its earliest roots in mid-1960s garage and psychedelic rock. It is typified by a heavy use of distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, pianos, and other keyboards. The terms "hard rock" and "heavy metal"  have often been used interchangeably, particularly in discussing bands of the 1970s, a period when the terms were largely synonymous. For example, the 1983 Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll includes this passage: "known for its aggressive blues-based hard-rock style, Aerosmith was the top American heavy-metal band of the mid-Seventies.
           Hard rock emerged with groups of the late-1960s, such as The Who, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Iron Butterfly, Blue Cheer and Led Zeppelin who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock. During the 1970s, hard rock developed a variety of sub-genres. Aerosmith, Queen, Kiss, Thin Lizzy, Rush, Bad Company, Metallica, Guns N' Roses, AC/DC and MÃ¶tley Crue were just a few of these important hard rock groups .

08.08  RHYTHAM AND BLUES -  Soul, Funk & Disco 

          Rhythm and blues (also known as R&B, R'n'B or RnB) is the name given to a wide-ranging genre of popular music, originally created by African Americans in the late 1940s and early 1950s in the USA. It drew on swing and jazz rhythms and blues vocals, and was an important influence on rock and roll. It diversified into soul, funk, and other styles. By the early 1960s, the music industry category previously known as rhythm and blues was being called soul music, and similar music by white artists was labeled blue eyed soul. By the 1970s, the term rhythm and blues was being used as a blanket term to describe soul, funk, and disco.A blanket term is a word or phrase that is used to describe multiple groups of related things.


 08.08.01  SOUL

         By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic rock and other genres. Early 1970s recordings by The Detroit Emeralds, such as Do Me Right, are a link between soul and the later disco style. Motown Records artists such as Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson contributed to the evolution of soul music, although their recordings were considered more in a pop music vein than those of Redding, Franklin and Carr. Artists like James Brown led soul towards funk music, which became typified by 1970s bands like Parliament-Funkadelic and The Meters.During the 1970s, some slick and commercial blue-eyed soul acts like Philadelphia's Hall & Oates and Oakland's Tower of Power achieved mainstream success, as did a new generation of street-corner harmony or city-soul groups like The Delfonics and Howard University's Unifics. Philly soul and most other soul genres were dominated by disco-inflected tracks. During this period, groups like The O'Jays and The Spinners continued to turn out hits.

08.08.02  FUNK  

           Funk is an American musical style that originated in the mid to late 1960s when African American musicians blended soul music, soul jazz and R&B into a rhythmic, danceable new form of music.Unlike R&B and Soul songs, which had many chord changes, funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord.Influential African American funk performers include James Brown, Sly and the Family Stone, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, Curtis Mayfield, The Meters, The Funk Brothers, Bootsy Collins, Rick James, and Prince. Notable 1970s funk bands included Rufus feat. Chaka Khan, Earth, Wind & Fire, Eric Burdon & War, Tower of Power, Average White Band, The Ohio Players, The Commodores, Kool & the Gang and Cameo, though many of these most famous bands in the genre also played disco and soul extensively. Funk music was a major influence on the development of 1970s disco music.

08.08.03  DISCO 

         Disco is a genre of dance-oriented music whose origins, like other genres of music, are hard to place at a single defining point. Most agree that the first disco songs were released in 1973, but some claim Manu Dibango's 1972 Soul Makossa to be the first disco record. The first article about disco was written in September 1973 by Vince Aletti for Rolling Stone Magazine. In 1974 New York City's WPIX-FM premiered the first disco radio show.Well-known  1970s disco performers included Evelyn "Champagne" King, Tavares, Chic, Bee Gees, Donna Summer, Grace Jones, Gloria Gaynor, Diana Ross, the Village People, Sylvester, The Jacksons and others .......

      Disco songs â€“ funk oriented backgrounds

       Funk music was a major influence on the development of disco music. Funk musicians blended soul music, soul jazz and R&B into a rhythmic, danceable new form of music. Disco funk
typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass, Hammond organ, and drums playing interlocking rhythms. Funk bands sometimes have a horn section of several saxophones, trumpets, and in some cases, a trombone, which plays rhythmic "hits".

         Ska arose in the studios of Jamaica around 1959; it developed from the earlier mento genre. Ska is characterized by a walking bass line, accentuated guitar or piano rhythms on the offbeat, and sometimes jazz-like horn riffs.
         Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor to ska, and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals and The Paragons. 
Rocksteady uses some of the sound elements of rhythm and blues and ska but it  is slower and more relaxed than ska. Rocksteady arose at a time when young people from the Jamaican countryside were flooding into the urban ghettos of Kingston â€” in neighborhoods such as Riverton City, Greenwich Town and Trenchtown. Many of them became delinquents who exuded a certain coolness and style. These unruly youths became known as rude boys.
         Reggae as a musical term first appeared in print with the 1968 rocksteady hit "Do the Reggay" by The Maytals, but it was already being used in Kingston, Jamaica as the name of a slower dance and style of rocksteady.  By the late 1960s, the Rastafari movement became more popular in Jamaica and rocksteady became less popular. 
The Wailers, a band started by Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer  are perhaps the most recognised band that made the transition through all three stages of early Jamaican popular music: ska, rocksteady and reggae. Other significant reggae pioneers include Prince Buster, Desmond Dekker and Jackie Mittoo. 
         Eric Clapton's 1974 cover of the Bob Marley song "I Shot the Sheriff" helped bring reggae into the mainstream. By the mid 1970s, reggae was getting radio play in the UK on John Peel's radio show, and Peel continued to play reggae on his show throughout his career. Reggae began to enjoy a revival in the UK that continued into the 1980s, exemplified by groups like Steel Pulse, Aswad, UB40, and Musical Youth. Other reggae artists who enjoyed international appeal in the early 1980s include Third World, Black Uhuru and Sugar Minott.

10. THE  EIGHTIES  (the decade of 1980-1989)

     The decade began with an anti-disco backlash in the US, and  80s music would be characterized by the widespread use of synthesizers and keyboards. In the United States, MTV was launched and music videos began to have a huge effect on the record industry. Pop artists such as Duran Duran, Madonna, Queen, and Michael Jackson mastered the format and helped turned this new product into a profitable business. Hard rock, heavy metal, big hair bands, and glam metal, experienced extreme popularity, becoming one of the most dominating music genres of the 1980s.New wave and synthpop, techno and house music became popular phenomena throughout the decade, especially in the early and mid eighties. The hip hop scene continued to evolve ..

           New Wave is a genre of rock and pop music that emerged in in the middle to late 1970s alongside punk rock. The term at first generally was synonymous with punk rock before being considered a genre in its own right that incorporated aspects of electronic and experimental music, mod subculture, and disco and 1960's pop music. For most of the remainder of the 1980s the term "New Wave" was used in America to describe nearly every new pop or pop rock artist that largely used synthesizers. The period saw a number of one hit wonders.
           Synthpop is a subgenre of pop and electronic music in which the synthesizer is the dominant musical instrument. It originated during the New Wave era of the late 1970s and to mid-1980s, and it has continued to exist and develop ever since.
           New Romanticism was a music and fashion movement that peaked in the United Kingdom during the early 1980s. The movement was associated with bands such as Visage, Adam and the Ants, Ultravox, Spandau Ballet, Brian Eno and Roxy Music.Other key artists from the early-mid 1980s include Eurythmics, Talk Talk, A Flock of Seagulls, Tears for Fears, Pet Shop Boys, Devo, OMD, Japan, Thomas Dolby, Alphaville, Thompson Twins, Bronski Beat, Heaven 17, Howard Jones, Blancmange,Paul Haig, Norman Iceberg, Animotion, Propaganda, Modern Talking, Missing Persons, Real Life and The System.

10.06 UNDERGROUND METAL  

             Many subgenres of heavy metal developed outside of the commercial mainstream during the 1980s. Sharpe-Young's multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: thrash metal, death metal, black metal, power metal, and the related subgenres of doom and gothic metal.

During the 1980s, certain thrash metal bands established a prototype for black metal. This so-called "first wave" included bands such as Venom, Bathory, Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. Other artists usually considered part of this movement include Sodom and Destruction (from Germany), Bulldozer and Death SS (from Italy), Tormentor (from Hungary), Root (from Czech Republic), Mercyful Fate (from Denmark), SarcÃ³fago (from Brazil) and Blasphemy (from Canada).

It also featured the rise of contemporary country music music as a major genre.

10.03. HEAVY  METAL  (1990-1999)

           The era of metal's mainstream dominance in North America came to an end in the early 1990s. Glam metal fell out of favor due not only to the success of grunge, but also because of the growing popularity of the more aggressive sound typified by Metallica and the post-thrash groove metal of Pantera and White Zombie. In the mid- and late 1990s came a new wave of U.S. metal groups inspired by the alternative metal bands and their mix of genres. Dubbed "nu metal", bands such as P.O.D., Korn, Papa Roach, Disturbed, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, and Linkin Park incorporated elements ranging from death metal to hip hop, often including DJs and rap-style vocals.

10.03.01 THRASH METAL  (1990-1999)

         In the 1990s, many veteran thrash metal bands began changing to more accessible, radio-friendly styles. Metallica were a notable example of this shift, particularly with their mid to late 90's albums Load (1996), and ReLoad (1997), which both displayed minor blues and pop rock influences, and were seen as a major departure from the band's earlier sound. Megadeth took a more accessible route with their 1992 album Countdown to Extinction, and Testament released the mainstream and melodic The Ritual in 1992. A number of more typical thrash albums were released in the 1990s and all of those albums were commercial high points.

10.03.02  GROOVE  METAL  (or POST THRASH METAL )

         Groove metal  is a subgenre of heavy metal that emerged in the early 1990s. Early progenitors of the genre such as Exhorder, Pantera, Sepultura and White Zombie claim influence from their peers and contemporary thrash metal bands such as Slayer, Megadeth and Metallica, blues-laden traditional heavy metal such as Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden as well as hardcore punk bands such as Black Flag.

10.03.02 ALTERNATIVE METAL
           Alternative metal is a genre of heavy metal that gained popularity in the early 1990s. Most notably, alternative metal bands are characterized by heavy guitar riffs. Like it's relative, alternative rock, alternative metal also has a dilute, softer sound to it. As the 90s progressed, alternative metal's sound became more standardized as newer bands drew inspiration for the same collective set of influences that included Rage Against the Machine, Linkin Park, Korn, Deftones,HIM, Fear Factory, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, Primus and Helmet.  Korn, in particular, with its downtuned riffs and aggressive dissonance, created the sonic template for a new movement, which became known as nu metal. Many post-grunge bands like Alter Bridge, Hurt, 30 Seconds to Mars, Papa Roach, Hoobastank and Breaking Benjamin are also either influenced by or can be considered alternative metal.

East Coast hip hop has been noted as the first and original form of hip hop. According to Allmusic, "At the dawn of the hip-hop era, all rap was East Coast rap. 


        West Coast Hip hop  is a hip hop music subgenre that encompasses any artists or music which originates in the westernmost region of the United States.
       The gangsta rap subgenre of West Coast hip hop began to dominate from a radio play and sales standpoint during the early 90s. Gangsta rap reflects the violent lifestyles of some inner-city youths. After the national attention that Ice-T and N.W.A created in the late 1980s and early 1990s, gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop. By the end of the 90s decade, hip hop's focus began to shift back towards the East Coast and also to a fastly emerging Southern hip hop scene.

But there is a beat in the back. Many times will an R&B singer feature a rapper/hip-hop artist, and vice-versa. R&B can be relaxing, or sometimes it can be party music. It is a very nice form of music. Artists like BeyoncÃ© Knowles, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez and Usher have released a series of #1's. Destiny's Child is considered the most successful female group of all time, selling over 80 million records worlwide. Soulful R&B continues to be popular, with artists such as Rihanna, who continues to fuse R&B vocals with music from different genres.

11.09.01	DEATH  METAL

            Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It typically employs heavily distorted guitars, deep growling vocals, blast beat drumming, and complex song structures with multiple tempo changes.

11.09.02	BLACK  METAL  (2000 â€“ 2009)

            Musically, black metal artists developed the style of their 1980s precursors as a distinct genre that was separate from thrash metal. Philosophically, an aggressive anti-Christian sentiment became a must for any artists to be finalized as "black metal". Ihsahn of Emperor believes that this trend may have developed simply from "an opposition to society, a confrontation to all the normal stuff." A dark, misanthropic mentality was complemented visually with the use of corpsepaint, which was also most prevalent during this period as a statement to separate black metal artists from other rock bands of the era.

Like it's relative, alternative rock, alternative metal also has a dilute, softer sound to it.

Korn, in particular, with its downtuned riffs and aggressive dissonance, created the sonic template for a new movement, which became known as nu metal. Many post-grunge bands like Alter Bridge, Hurt, 30 Seconds to Mars, Papa Roach, Hoobastank and Breaking Benjamin are also either influenced by or can be considered alternative metal.


10.03.03  NU-METAL (2000 â€“ 2010)

12.10.	FUSION OF DIFFERENT MUSICAL STYLES (2000 â€“ 2009)

         A fusion genre is a music genre that combines two or more genres. Artists who work in fusion genres are often difficult to categorise within non-fusion styles. Most styles of fusion music are influenced by various musical genres. While there are many reasons for this, the main reason is that most genres evolved out of other genres.
