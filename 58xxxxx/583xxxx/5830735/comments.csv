,kandykanemw1,2010-09-15T00:35Z,I want to thank you too. Im orginally from the UK and now in the states use to get the show on BBC America until they decided to charge to watch its great thanks to you for your hard efforts. i wish you luck even as bad as the system is its worse here if you dont have any medical. The states will never have a system like that because they make to much money here.

It's only really for tests at first, so I hope to be back on duty for Monday.

I hope they have a tv in the hospital !!
