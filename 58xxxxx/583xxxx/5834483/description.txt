Class of the Titans (2010) 

Long ago, three Olympiansâ€”Zeus, Poseidon, and Hadesâ€”battled the Titans. Hades provided their means of defeating the Titans with his creation, the Kraken. After the Titans' defeat, Zeus created land-animals (including humans) and ruled them while Poseidon ruled the sea and its creatures. But Zeus deceived Hades and forced him to rule the Underworld. Zeus and his fellow gods on Mount Olympus rely on the prayers of humans to sustain their power.
