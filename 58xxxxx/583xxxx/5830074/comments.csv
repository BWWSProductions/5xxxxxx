,Orchonic,2010-10-14T02:54Z,"Yes there are subtitles, they are outside of the .rar file....  not in the unpack, but next to the .rar file..."
,DaktahTorr,2010-11-14T02:06Z,Sorry... pls help... I only see the svf and nfo files outside the rar files. When I run the .mkv file on my WD TV Live there are no subtitles. What do you mean by the statement above and how do I get subtitles the subtitles to work on the WD TV Live? Much appreciated and thanks for the up.
,DaktahTorr,2010-11-20T08:05Z,My subtitle issue was resolved with the latest WD TV Live firmware update to v1.03.49 here http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/updates/?family=wdfwdtv_live
,S3nd41,2011-03-04T01:12Z,11GiB? You must be dreaming ffs. I'll wait for a 2GB rip.
,Junky099,2011-04-04T00:46Z,"Lol, S3nd41, some people have internet fast enough to make downloading BluRays worthwhile, so you don't have to go here and complain how this size is to big :P"
,pewpew,2011-09-02T01:18Z,"Thanks for the torrent.

For some strange reason, when I play this file on my PS3 through PS3 Media Server, the sound refuses to play.  It doesn't recognize the DTS track or something.  However it DOES play fine through my PC.  

Strange thing is that I'm able to play DTS tracked video files just fine on PS3 Media Server, such as my copy of Avatar with DTS-HD audio.  The PS3 see the track just fine and passes it through to my audio receiver and the DTS light comes on.  Just not on this one file.  Not complaining so much as warning anyone intending to play it on PS3 Media Server before they download an 11gb file. Thanks!"

Keeping a copy of the torrent to share (like a good little pirate) and a copy of the movie to watch means I have to maintain 22GB worth of this movie on my hard drive.

Wasted space FTL."
