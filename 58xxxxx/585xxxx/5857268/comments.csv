There is a lot of bending, and when they bend, the speakers crackle. I have a very good sound system so when I heard it crackle on my laptop, I moved it to the home theater and it definitely crackles, to the point of damaging. Be careful"

people keep stating that this movie is bad, think one person said it was bad and people can't make up their own minds and just keep repeating what they've been told...

its based off a cartoon, and for a huge change is following the original plot... the fx blends into the movie and nothing feels forced ... the actors w/in the movie are trying to reproduce the roll of their counter parts from the cartoon, without pulling any of themselves in the roll, not an easy thing to do ... and ... hell.  watch it, there's lots of baddies getting their asses kicked."

Theyve cramed in 8 hours  of storytelling in to 1,40 hours. Theres so much missing from the plot its incredible, theyve cut out all the travels.  Sokka isnt even funny, theyve made him in to a strong quiet type....but hes not.  
As far as the acting goes.....Iroh and Zuko are talanted and do stand out. the rest are just ...bleh.

As far as how this movie is, this is just book 1 of probabably 5 to maybe 10 movies, each movie is going to be 1 book, like this movie was book 1 water bending, next is going to be earth, then air, then fire and whatever comes after that comes. 

As far as the crackeling goes, you do need to get better speakers cause i have a set of creative high defenition surround sound speakers with subwoofer and i never heard no crackeling.

This literally tops my list of worst movies ever. I'm slightly bitter because I loved the original series, but even without that it's a terrible movie.

Do you think anyone gives a flyin fuck what anyone here thinks about the movie, less then 1% of downloaders posted anything about this movie.  Congrats on being the 1% who complain about everything and everyone in life, and ironically enough, no one cares...1% complain, 6000 more downloaded.  So stfu, rate the QUALITY of the upload, and go back to double dunking ur waffles while u search for the newest porn videos.  If you wanna bitch, go cry in a corner or MAKE A BETTER MOVIE.  If you cant its because all your good at is being a wannabe critic, imbd.com > noobs.  Only reason you didnt like it is because there was no porn in it, no references to WoW and no fat bitch ass kiddies stuffing there face with whatever candy there mommies bought for there lunchs.

Audio is really bad ripped, i get sound puffs from the effects. sounds like the speakers is about the break every time they use their powers in the movie.

Video quality is good, nothing to complain about. You see the fire flaming, the water flowing and the air blowing.. very realistic haha :P

Movie has many flaws, one of them that this is only the beginning of a serie of movies that hopefully is released alot faster than LoTR, Harry Potter and other movie series. One other flaw is that the actual martial art sometimes look very very bad. like they should have practice alot more on the moves. Some bad acting can also be seen but not as often as bad martial arts. 

Conclusion: this has potential to be a rather ok movie with alot of mystic hidden around their adventure and i really hope this raises the bar ALOT on upcoming movies with similar plot or category. But i think if you can accept the movie for what it is and look through all the flaws it will not be wasted time to bring your loved one/s in and put this movie on.
