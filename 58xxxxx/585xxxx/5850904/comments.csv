,covertop,2010-09-25T02:46Z,"Downloading now and I have no doubts that this will work, pretty much everything globe does is perfect!  Will comment after it's done, nice seed speed too!!!! :D"
,D0gmeat,2010-09-25T02:47Z,"Appreciate the compression! Wasn't interested enough in the game to waste 2 Gb on a download but this smaller size is worth enough to take a look at.

Thanks!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-25T03:16Z,"Thank you for your credits about the work and both of you are absolutly right , this 9th game of the series is like this , have lot of levels anyway independtly of the size , the traditional intriguing puzzles that is usual on the series and a new little different style with a isometric gameplay but all the usual carachteristics of a lara croft game is on this one too , but of course afte seeing the size of this new game of the series and comparing to the 8th game the Tomb Raider underworld it is really the case to ask : how it will be in styl and size the next Tomb Raider game ? one thing we know , in all this game series the players are used to be surpreended by the new games and certainly this one donÂ´t miss that too . Thank you again and i hope to see everyone start playing the game faster as possible ."
,rocco_sifredi,2010-09-25T07:00Z,"Isometric ????????? WTF ? Not even in 1996 ....Tomb Raider wasn't that bad...This is one of those morons idea, who think that what is not broken , must be fixed. "

,covertop,2010-09-25T14:15Z,"Globe! You are ""The Man""  as usual, easy install and works like a charm :D  It's a good thing Globe is still here ripping this shit for us otherwise I think we'd be stuck with full blown d/l's from Skidrow and Reloaded, which I love them too but Globe, Globe, Globe!!!!!! I could just kiss you man lolol.

1. Extract with Peazip to wherever your games directory is
2. Right click Globe Converter.exe and ""run as administrator"" in Windows 7 64bit
3. Wait about 10-15 min depending on your system
4. Create desktop shortcut from lcgol.exe and your good to go.

Tried tested and true once again from the very best ripper there is, you better believe it! ;)"

,fluster84,2010-09-26T19:45Z,"Awesome work globe.. as usual, keep it up and thanks. "
,urza4315,2010-09-27T03:34Z,"Hey globe the game works good BUT there is a problem, I don't know if it's a problem with your release or a bug with the game but I thought I should let you know...

In the level ""Stronghold Passage"" one of the challenge tombs is unsolvable. You know the one where with the big grid of retracting spikes? Some spikes that are supposed to retract when you hit the switch, do not retract making the puzzle unsolvable. Do you know if this is a bug with the game or a problem with the crack?"
,lucasla,2010-09-27T20:27Z,Its possible to play online with Hamachi?

[V],globeplus,2010-09-28T15:25Z,"MESSAGE TO THE USERS (part 1) : Ok this a disclaimer from a little disappointed uploader with the atitudes from some users , itis the next thing : of course that i maded the main work with the fantastic work from the original 2 giga and something file and my file is a real clone from that one with absolutly nothing missing , what i mean is that any possible not me or the coders for that fiule are not responsable for circunstancial bugs , the true is that i realize with a more deep analysis that with the use of trainers or not in some specific points of the gameplay the user can get a surpreendent circunstancial bug specially with trainers and that is a thing that not me or the original file coders can guess , my wish and i hope this be very clear is always that the users get the all game in perfect conditions , it is absolutly beeing thinking even for a second that i want to upload a game file that the users in half of the game or close to the end get a borring bug , the true is that sometimes because the worked executables in one or another game is susceptible to get bugs in the middle of the game and we have a few examples already , what we have to do in this cases , is not beeing criticising but try to finf a way out or a new worked executable with everything ok (to be continue)"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-28T15:29Z,"MESSAGE TO THE USERS (part 2) : never cros my mind open the executable or the support dlls and put bugs in there and my wish is for for shore that the users get the full game with the normal gameplay , ok use the all levels unlocked file in case of circunstancial bugs and happy gaming .

,Ramsay21,2010-09-29T10:33Z,"Thanks globe for this wonderfull work. Also, I think that you convert wii games to pc, so can you please convert the mario games New Super Mario Bros. Wii that can be played on pc.

Also, if anyone is stuck in the game then they can download the save game files from here - http://forums.techarena.in/video-games/1365386.htm"

,aceveda05,2010-09-30T13:48Z,why the game crashes in the temple where u should run to the top of ladder like walls!?
,klicko94,2010-10-01T13:08Z,works perfectly :)

,AkA_Nomad,2010-10-03T07:54Z,globe u have the blessings from every 1 :D 
,amigaOS,2010-10-03T10:51Z,"Globe, not trying on your parade but 2 torrents I have downloaded from and both have problems. This game crashes right before entering second level and there seems to be no fix from your side. Also the complete saves list you quoted, is not suggested unless anybody wants to finish this game only in easy mode only!"
,dun3rr,2010-10-03T15:18Z,hey could you upload somewhere a save after the first map? all unlocked save is nice but it pretty much spoils the fun of discovering things since you already have all weapons and artifacts :)
,wowme,2010-10-04T19:36Z,"I got a diagnostic message error from 7-zip, it won't open the file. 

Anyone knows what this is about or do i have to exctract with another programm? If so which? 

Thanks."
,vj-ulez,2010-10-05T10:16Z,"excellent work by globe+.. thanks a lot.. worked like a charm following the simple instructions.. seeding,,"
[V],globeplus,2010-10-08T18:51Z,"To all the distracted users :
i have a all levels unlocked available at the comments and i donÂ´t see to many files with that , its users saying that donÂ´t see any fix , can happen circunstancial , maybe it is possible to play all the game without a single problem and sometimes aftera bug if the level is repeated maybe nothing happen but the problem is that the saves catch the bug on the continue feature , so for really repeat a level that get a circunstancial bug is to backup the current save before starting a level but i suggest that the best thing is to download the all levels unlocked and any worry disappear and the yser can play the all game for shore no matter what ."
