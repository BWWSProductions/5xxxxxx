I don't know either when people get a green or a pink skull. A green skull means that you're a VIP: a very important person, that's what you are right know I think. A green skull means that you're a trusted person, maybe then you need to upload 150 or more torrents which are clean and not fake/real... ;-) Don't know exactly....."
,MitsEvX,2010-09-27T20:34Z,correction: a PINK skull means that you're a trusted person.... (A)
