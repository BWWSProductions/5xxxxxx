"Harder, Better, Faster, Browner"

Kenny West is a single dad and struggling rapper 
whom Cleveland takes under his wing in attempt to 
prove his own prowess after receiving some 
surprising news about his childhood basketball 
camp nemesis. Together, Cleveland and Kenny write, 
record and perform a new hit single, "Be-Cleve in 
Yourself." The track burns up the charts and 
ignites Kenny's new rap career, but leaves 
Cleveland behind in the dust.

Enjoy :)
