This is the latest version of Windows XP Professional,
SP3 version,
with the install included is a nice screensaver called dream aquarium.

Burn it on a cd for use as an OS.

Use VMWare Workstation (my other upload) for virtual installation.

Included is a keygen.


This is a keygen for WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL SP3,
please verify what your anti-virus says about this.
I checked and used this without any problem.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<BUT>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Don't EVER use those stupid online virus scan.
Because it fucks you really hard.
It wil almost ALWAYS tell you there is a virus in a file if you scan it.

Try Spybot Search & Destroy/ Malwarebytes Anti-Malware/Or of course your regular virus scan!

Screenshot can be uploaded if someone ask for it!

If you like this, please give a comment.
And seed please!

Enjoy!


p.s. This is for installing WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL SP3.
This can't be used to registrate at microsoft because they didn't verify your serial, no, it was created.
