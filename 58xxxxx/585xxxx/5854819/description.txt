From RecordedBooks.com:

Philip Roth is one of the most prestigious names in American literature, 
having won the National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Faulkner 
Award, the National Book Award, and the Pulitzer Prize in fiction. For 
the first time ever, Roth delves into the realm of alternate history 
with the astounding novel that builds from the premise: What if Charles 
A. Lindbergh, a noted anti-semite, defeated FDR in the 1940 presidential 
election? Listeners hungry for thought-provoking fiction with 
contemporary relevance will find a veritable feast.

From Wiki:

The Plot Against America is an alternate history in which Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt is defeated in the presidential election of 1940 by 
Charles Lindbergh.

The novel follows the fortunes of the Roth family during the Lindbergh 
presidency, as antisemitism becomes more accepted in American life and 
Jewish-American families like the Roths are persecuted on various 
levels. The narrator and central character in the novel is the young 
Philip, and the care with which his confusion and terror are rendered 
makes the novel as much about the mysteries of growing up as about 
American politics. Roth based his novel on the isolationist ideas 
espoused by Lindbergh in real life as a spokesman for the America First 
Committee and his own experiences growing up in Newark, New Jersey. The 
novel depicts the Weequahic section of Newark which includes Weequahic 
High School from which Roth graduated.
