It says 0 seeders, but that's not true. It downloaded pretty fast."
,JohnnyGhost,2010-09-28T06:58Z,"OMG, why are you people not seeding this? I've watched 171 episodes religeously, and your quiting on me now?..... Weeeeaaaak!"
,Sketti11,2010-09-29T01:02Z,Once again Audio Is shotty unless I use WMP. I appreciate the Upload. Cuz its hard to get this anywhere else. But audio was to loud off the bat and distorted.
,Sketti11,2010-09-29T01:16Z,And I have been seeding this for 5 hrs. Why does it still show that there is no Seeders?
[T],lscook1970,2010-09-29T20:15Z,"I just changed capture cards, so i hope the audio with vlc player will be fixed, WMP plays fine. I have no idea why this shows no seeders, I have been seeding for 4 days, the upload date is even wrong. I email TPB about this, still no fix. There are seeds on this. And will be until i put together a season 9 download. "
