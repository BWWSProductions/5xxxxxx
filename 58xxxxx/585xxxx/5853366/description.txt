Here we go dudes 
This Program Extracts The Mods You Download So You Can See The Mods In The Ingame-Mod Menu/Installed.. And Then After Activate Em !!!

 1. Install 7-zip if you don\'t have it yet (it\'s a free, light and in my opinion the best compression tool/technology now).

2. After downloading the mod through the mod browser, locate the .civmod file on your hard disk. Probably it\'s on your {Documents folder}\\My Games\\Civilization V\\MODS folder with a hashed filename (i.e. \"7815696ecbf1c96e6894b779456d330e.civmod\").

3. If you installed 7zip with the windows explorer extensions on, right-click this .civmod file and extract the files inside. The extracted files can stay in or out some subfolder, as long they are inside the MODS folder. (If you didn\'t istall 7zip with extensions you\'ll have to open 7zip and look for the civmod file to extract its contents).

4. Now you can delete the civmod file, the mod should be listed on mod browser to be enabled.
