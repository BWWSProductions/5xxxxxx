works like a charm :D
but mabye its your pc spec
cuz when iv played like 4-5 hour in a row then  exit and play again right after it gives me CTD all the time at intro or at making new modded game (lack of memory) i just restart my computer even when i got a brand new computer like 10 days ago lol :/ "
,anuzbitt,2010-09-27T14:17Z,"but it sounds like the release of the game you got is no good :( 
mabye its the chinese release ? or Arctic0ne ?"
,chris1010,2010-09-28T10:34Z,"hey man...with this you show that you really care...nevertheless it is totally unnecessary to use this becasue of a simple reason... 
1. In Civ V menue you go to mods - downloads and now you can browse through all available mods and download and install them just by clicking.It works !
2. ANY PROBLEM people encounter with crashes and so on is for a hardware, system configuration or driver/update issues.
I have a brand new windows7 x86 system with clean registry and before installing anything else updated every piece of software to the latest + I really encourage everybody to search manually for update KB976264 for Win7 from Feb 2010 which increases compatibility with games (YOU WONT GET THIS BY AUT UPDATE!)...since July I installed some of the  pickiest cracked games out there like GTA IV,MassEffect2,Borderlands+all DLC,Anno1404,Dragon Age Origens/Awakening+all DLC,Fallout 3 GOTY (Unleashed release) and others and until today not encountered a real problem with none of them except for the ocasional crash all games have from time to time...regarding Civ V now
I play ArcticOne's release in Dx10 with SKIDROW crack for about 40 hours WITHOUT any issue...no freeze..no crash...loaded all sort of safes, autosaves and mods from inside the game or from menue...downloading mods from the net and installing....everything works perfect...certainly one of the most stable games from release since years and actually I play the true earth loc mod without issues since about 10h...everything works...no workarounds needed no restrictions found...saves...autosaves...all perfect"
,anuzbitt,2010-09-28T12:18Z,"nice info about the update chris2010 
but well its weird cuz my release when i download mods online and go to the install screen the mods aint there to install or to be ticked green.....total blank screen.... but if you use the program to unpack the mods into the MOD folder ect :D the mods are there to be ticked....mabye you got a better updated release than i do ?"
,chris1010,2010-09-28T17:29Z,anuzbitt ...well...strange...when i'am at home I will have a look about installing the mods...it was 3 clicks nothing else...arctic ones release is from steam and its an already updated version 1.0.0.17 but dont know for sure if that has something to do with it.....about the update for win7...I swear that it will make a huge difference specially with older games...when I got the new machine in July I installed a bunch of older games and everything worked without any problems even though it was not on the win7 compatibility list except for Medival Total War but only cause it uses a graphic feauture which was removed from modern graphic cards above GT6800 so the game will crash...
,cptforge_gil,2010-09-29T21:42Z,"SKIDROW works!

i know this is irrelevant in this topic but did SKIDROW released crack for kane and lynch 2?
the other one is not working in my win7 ultimate 64bit

thanks in advance"
,maylolik,2011-01-27T20:04Z,"these steps ARE necessary if u installed the game to a different drive than C:. So u ppl who think u know it all, and everything works just fine, plz stfu"
,Bvrns,2011-07-23T17:36Z,Does anyone know how to use MODS with the latest cracked version (v1.0.1.348)???
