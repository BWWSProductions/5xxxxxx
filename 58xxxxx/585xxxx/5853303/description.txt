A lion, a zebra, a giraffe, and a hippo are best friends, comfortably living in the safe haven of the Central Park Zoo. Their world is turned upside down when they're packed into crates to be shipped away. But when an accident at sea strands them on the shores of Madagascar, they end up in one outrageous predicament after another, as these human-kept animals figure out just how tough it is to survive in the wild.
