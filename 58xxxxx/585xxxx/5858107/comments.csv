[V],phatwarez,2010-10-01T21:47Z,Old games are posted here and there but definitely not a complete season.

I was looking for the 2005 game with San Fran when Nathan Vasher ran back a missed field goal for 108 yards before the half.  It was a great game!  Do you have it?"
[V],phatwarez,2010-10-02T08:57Z,"Nope, can't find it anywhere. 5 years old... most of the torrents from back then are long dead. You might find some highlight clip from the game but definitely not a full game."

It's a funny recap, Chris Berman's fastest 3 minutes thing he does on ESPN."

Thanks."
,krp2nte,2010-10-04T03:45Z,"First off--many thanks for these.  I have been using my EyeTV to record games for my homie in Iraq (soldier--not random Iraqi!).

Anyway I accidentally trimmed the whole game today instead of the pre and post game bs.

Any chance you'll have today's game UL'd soon? (GB v DET)

Thanks again.  Go Pack Go!!"
,domlom,2010-10-05T20:20Z,Can someone help me?  Is there a reason I can't hear the commentary?  I assume it has something to do with multi channel audio but I don't know what to do.
,sidestep29,2012-02-10T01:26Z,"I've tied downloading this for a couple hours now and nothing is happening so idk if its the torrent or if nobody is seeding it anymore, if you guys could that would be great cuz id love to get this whole season downloaded"
