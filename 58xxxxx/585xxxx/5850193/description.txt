Butterfly Photographers Handbook.


This book, like its predecessor, The Art and Science of Butterfly Photography,
is divided into two sections. The first section deals with the butterfly itself
(types, behaviors, habitats, etc.), and the second part provides information on
how to photograph these creatures. The main difference between this book
and the previous book is that digital photography is so much easier than film
photography. Many readers will be able to start taking great photographs after
reading just a few chapters in this book.
