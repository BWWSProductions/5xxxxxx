*Sorry for the quick V2. Same Source as before, Quality is pretty much the same, I just keep the AVI smaller(closer size to source) & Subs smaller/less intrusive in this release. Sample included this time.*

This is the Machete R5 with FULL ENG Hardcoded Subs. This is the Machete R5 downloaded from Heist(thanks Heist) and Full Eng Subs from subscene via spaniel(thanks spaniel).
