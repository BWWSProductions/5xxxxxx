I have been looking for a good copy of The Zen of Scream for a long time and all I could find was incomplete copies. A singer from another band loaned me a copy of it and The Zen of Scream 2 (NOT IN THIS TORRENT). So I'm passing it on to you guys.  The Zen of Scream 2 torrent will be uploaded soon. 

Torrent info: You will need winrar or like program to open it. Most DVD burning programs will burn it. I use Magic DVD copier. The RAR file will give you a full functioning DVD of disc 1 with Chapters and all the other options.  Sorry I donâ€™t have disc 2 which is for female vocal training. Enjoy!

The Zen of Screaming is an instructional DVD by Melissa Cross, a vocal coach whose speciality is unclean vocal techniques used in extreme metal music styles among others. It helps singers learn how to strengthen their bodies so they can perform growled or screamed vocals. On the DVD many guest musicians, such as Randy Blythe of Lamb of God, appear to demonstrate the exercises.

In the early '90s, a passionate and unrestrained movement of singers emerged from the underground that would test the extreme limits of the human voice. Heeding the call of the warriors of rock and metal for over 15 years, Melissa Cross developed a vocal training method that has since been embraced by these artists who value raw power and passion above everything in their performance. Her groundbreaking vocal technique can enhance range and increase endurance without sacrificing intensity and individuality.
