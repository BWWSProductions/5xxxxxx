,Kona_Guy,2010-09-24T22:45Z,"Thank you kind sir, i will seed for 1 year!"
,DoTTGaMMa,2010-09-24T22:45Z,"YESS! It works 100% thank you lol I'm forced seeding non-capped with my T1 Connection because its so good.// High bandwidth also.

I downloaded Arctic Ones and it didn't work, I extracted the folder to my C drive... Didn't alter anything and moved the contents of this .ZIP download into it and now it start up with th shortcut file instantly! Thank you."
,telep_man,2010-09-24T22:46Z,"Anybody who used this and got that mother fucker arcticone's release to work, please can you give us some guidelines?"
,DoTTGaMMa,2010-09-24T22:51Z,"Another note:
Calibration of In-Game keys coordinates are just a bit off to the left instead of directly on the icons... By Changing my Resolution to my native pixels and restarting my game it worked fine."
,telep_man,2010-09-24T22:51Z,"If theres anyone who used this crack to get the arcticone's (that sorry motherfucker) release to work, can you please explain exactly what you did, cuz I cant figure it out."
,DoTTGaMMa,2010-09-24T22:55Z,"Telep_man:

Take the .ZIP download from Artic0nes download and extract all the files to a folder in your Primary C Drive. Once it's done DONT edit or change anything in the extracted folder! Download this and extract all the files into a folder on your desktop. Then take all the contents and move them into the C Drive civilization extract folder... Copy, Replace, & Merge all contents.

Then Click the SHORTCUT icon in the folder, not the .exe or anything.

BAM it should work :)

btw make sure you downloaded arctic0nes torrent from him, not a reuploader...

This is the one I used...

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5846266/Civilization_V_-_Deluxe_Edition

and a BTW for everyone the current seeders now are 513/ 572 leech."
,MannyZanny,2010-09-24T22:59Z,I applied the SKIDROW crack and the single player works fine but the multiplayer LAN fails to connect to another computer and stalls on the downloading game info or a message like that. Anyonw have success with multiplayer LAN?
,DoTTGaMMa,2010-09-24T23:11Z,"Download Arctic0nes Civilization V Torrent... (MAKE SURE ITS FROM HIM, NOT FROM A RE-UPLOADER.)

LINK: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5846266/Civilization_V_-_Deluxe_Edition

Once downloaded, (DO NOT EDIT ANY FILES IN THE .ZIP ARCHIVE!)
Extract all contents of the .ZIP [using WinRAR] to the following location...

C:/[Make a folder, ex: ""CIV5EXT""]
So it would look something like C:/civ5ext(For advanced users)

OR you can make the folder in your C/ Primary drive called ""CIV5EXT"" and do a Drag-&-Drop Operation selecting all the contents from Arctic0nes CIV5 Download into your new folder titled ""CIV5EXT""[Simple for noobish users, both methods work exactly the same by the way...]

Once you have done so(DO NOT EDIT ANY FILES OR CHANGE ANYTHING WITHIN THE NEW EXTRACT FOLDER IN YOUR C DRIVE)
Download this torrent
Once downloaded, (DO NOT EDIT ANY FILES IN THE .ZIP ARCHIVE!)
Extract all contents of the .ZIP [using WinRAR] to a new folder on your desktop...

Once you have done so, select all the items in the crack folder, and drag and drop them into the C DRIVE folder ""CIV5EXT"" that has the game from ArcticOne in it.

[Replace & Merge all Files; Admin prompt needs to be bypassed to achieve this needed step.]

Once thats done

SELECT THE SHORTCUT ICON in the C Drive folder and the game should run...

Everything is clean and updated, you should be 100% :)

note to people: Using the .exe and launch.exe things may not work all the time apparently... From what I've heard its best to use the shortcut(Which I know links it to the .exe but this is what I've heard, and I trust my ears.)"
,MPEGMASTER,2010-09-24T23:45Z,"it works, tnks."
,telep_man,2010-09-24T23:48Z,"Dottgamma,

If ur talking about the shortcut named ""Play Civilization V"", it says that the specified path doesnt exist."
,telep_man,2010-09-24T23:53Z,"And once I ""targeted"" it to launcher.exe, its the same old story, i see firaxis and gamespy logos and then back to desktop."
,telep_man,2010-09-24T23:59Z,"Now my comments have gone missing too. I was saying that I did exactly what you said, Dottgamma, I only changed the target of the shortcut (""Play Civilization V"") - suppose you forgot to mention that - but its the same thing, I see the logos and then back to desktop."
,mlech,2010-09-25T00:05Z,"This says 0 seeders, but it actually has plenty of seeding, took < 1 minute to download.  Works with Articone's release.  Thanks !!!"
,telep_man,2010-09-25T00:21Z,"FINALLY!

I got it workin with this crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5850674/Civilization_5_%282010%29_PC_Crack_Only_---_SkidROW

,Supra33,2010-09-25T01:09Z,is this crack for the ArcticOne release?
,mcgee_w,2010-09-25T04:29Z,Confirmed: works with Artic0ne's release.
,dothackjhe,2010-09-25T06:41Z,"The crack doesn't work with ArcticOne's upload of Civilization V. BitDefender 2010 blocks the exe of the crack due to viruses -- persistent virus. I had to restart the PC just to stop the 'block the ball' gameplay between BitDefender 2010 and the crack. So far, there's no harm to the PC. "
,dothackjhe,2010-09-25T06:56Z,"I tried it twice with ArcticOne's release, it doesn't work. The crack seems to be a malware to me. The folder where the game is installed acts funny after trying to launch the game. "
,dothackjhe,2010-09-25T07:16Z,Some people are claiming that this crack works!! Dammit I'm confused! @_@ BitDefender 2010 kept blocking a codec.exe from the crack whenever I try to run the game. And it seems like the codec.exe is very persistent so as to reach around 1000+ of it at BitDefender's quarantine vault. 
,br00tality,2010-09-25T08:18Z,"dude it works with ArcticOne's release. just copy all the files from this crack to your game directory and run through shortcut. 2 things though..

1. Into movie cant be skipped but skips automatically shortly after it starts.

2. I crashed 4 hours in and theres no autosaves ;_;"
,Hellcattt,2010-09-25T09:27Z,"Thanks, working good with Arctic0ne release. "

,misery89,2010-09-25T10:29Z,"Works perfectly, just run the game from the launcher not the play bla bla revloader and you are good, and if your game still crashes, jus download the skidrow version and use the crack on it, im on the arc version with the rev loader but the game works perfectly, thanks skidrow, seriously the robin hoods of our time, ive done a debate paper on you people on ma uni, u people should get ur respect"
,dothackjhe,2010-09-25T10:51Z,"@br00tality

How often do you experience crashes in the game? I guess I'll have to try running the game again. "
,dothackjhe,2010-09-25T11:18Z,"@br00tality

Dude, now I'm positive that the cracks here are a virus. I've scanned the contents of the crack folder, and it found the three exe of the crack as virus. Scanned it using BitDefender 2010. "
,noso33,2010-09-25T12:20Z,"i downloaded it,,and i worked perfectly,,but when i try multiplayer,,it writes that i must have steam active !!,,anyone can help?"
,Evilspark,2010-09-25T12:53Z,"Works perfectly with articone's release.
Played 6 hours yesterday, though now I have some problems. When I go to advanced settings the game freezes and I'm forced to quit, before that when advanced settings was still working, the game freezed while loadig. I can still play without going to advanced settings though."
[V],Mbb15,2010-09-25T14:56Z,"Found this on the internet: (I dont give any support)

Confirmed and working way of playing Civilization 5 Online:

1) Install Civilization 5 Skidrow release
2) Apply Skidrow crack
3) Edit steamclient.dll (in game directory) using notepad or hex editor replacing SKIDROW with your Steam Username - Screenshot
4) Start Steam and login to account u entered in steamclient.dll (you can create new account or use existing one)
5) Run Civilization 5 and go to Multiplayer (not LAN!)
6) Play the game! - Screenshot

Notes:
1. Editing steamclient.dll and starting a game will give you an error, just ignore it.
2. You dont need Tunngle or Hamachi.
3. Connecting to LAN games using this method with Tunngle / Hamachi not working! - stuck on Retrieving Host Information.
4. You can use SmartSteam or regular Steam, no difference just be logged in."
,rurik1967,2010-09-25T15:13Z,"I tried this torrent crack for hours, the file size only 28meg, you would think with 1200 seeders it would work, after 3 hours of game crashing after the 2K intro, trying differant settings, updating Nvidia,Phsyis, C++ drivers to no avail, I read somewhere the true filesize was 83.7 meg, so I did some searching and found it.

Did a fresh install with ActicOne, unzipped the crack, and copied everything over to fresh install and selected overwrite everything. To my surprise, it worked flawlessly, and I have been playing no without probs for last hour.

1 note, the 28meg file I originally downloaded, the 3 exe files to lauch game, came up with trojan virus, I had to disable norton360 just to get it to copy to game folder.

This crack here im uploading doesnt have any virus warnings etc.

I hope this helps someone.

,br00tality,2010-09-25T17:32Z,"@dothackjhe

only happened once. i also take back the thing about the intro movie. you just cant skip the 2 logos in the beginning. cracks usually come up as false positives as well."
,Dimmis80,2010-09-25T18:33Z,This crack works great with Artic0nes release.For me at least.So @Mbb15 thanks about the crack.Anyone knows how to activate the AA or other DX10 Visual options for the game without install SP2.I have SP1 and i don't care to install SP2 for this game only.(All my other games new and old are great with SP1).And i can't find a script to change that or something.?Is there a way.??
,calvorin,2010-09-25T19:02Z,"This crack works perfectly.  Thank you very much.  I was just wondering if anyone knows a way to get LAN functioning?  Is the problem that it sees the two copies, both using this crack as the same game?  If we buy a copy of the game, would we be able to play using this crack as one, and the legit copy as the other?  Any help would be much appreciated."

,DoTTGaMMa,2010-09-26T01:35Z,"For everyone thats having troubles making this work its either for the following reasons:

1.)- You have never torrented anything.
2.)- You have no common sense to try a Trial & Error.
3.)- Your not using Skidrows Crack.
4.)- You decided to edit, and move files incorrectly, something it seems everyone is failing on.
5.)- Try doing Clean Installs.

I believe my directions on the front page should help you if you are still having troubles..."
