[T],ctang,2010-09-30T15:33Z,"ok i just thought i would give people a heads up on what i am going to upload next...Next will be The Fantastic Mr. Fox...i may do One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Almost Heroes if people want it...i am only going to do them if i get a couple people that actually want them so let me know by PM (need at least 3 people for each movie asking for them to upload them for me to do them)

,mcthom,2010-09-30T16:59Z,Thank you very much! I'll seed this for at least a week since I'm the one who made you upload this.
,Metal1Dead,2010-10-01T00:35Z,"can someone please upload a DVD9 ntsc version of the movie ""up"" , i know djfred's copy is available but it has errors in the first chapter . And thank you ctang for this movie !"
,TYLERRRR,2010-10-01T06:46Z,"Thanks a lot ctang. The Fantastic Mr. Fox would be fine. Anyway can you upload releases with 3 tracks like djfred back in his time (English, Spanish and French). Sadly that most of recent prominent movies were posted in eng-spa versions (for example Clash of Titans)... Thanks in advance. "
[T],ctang,2010-10-01T17:19Z,"i will only post what i can get and if eng-spa or eng-fre is all i can get than that is what i upload...i dont plan on it being like that but thats just the way it goes...i dont know where djfred is located but perhaps he lives in an area where eng-fre-spa are all predominate languages and also fall in an ntsc region but i dont...to be honest, where i live i dont know a single person who speaks french fluently and i only know one person where their native language is spanish (but she knows english good enough to watch movies in english)...it is really a wonder that i get anything that isnt just english, but sometimes i do get only english titles but they are mostly older movies

,Metal1Dead,2010-10-02T02:09Z,"is tpb having some errors lately or something , hi ctang did u notice that the seeders and leechers were zero since the past two days or so for this torrent ???"
[T],ctang,2010-10-02T05:45Z,the forum said that for now the trackers aren't being scraped (checked)
,themasteronetwo,2010-10-02T07:37Z,"Hey Due, thanks for ur advice about software, i have windows in my mac now and yeah u were right in everything.... :) thank u very much bro....

,trytryagain1,2010-10-03T23:27Z,"What up Ctang.  Saw that you were thinking about One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Yeah budy there is a classic.  I am surprised as all hell that no one has replied to that one.  Well in that case here I am numero uno.  I would love to see that one come up.  Thanks...Oh yeah I must say thank you for this one first, well I guess it is second now.  Well thanks for this one my wife digs this one."
,dadeohdan,2010-10-04T01:34Z,Thank you ctang....My kids are waiting on Beauty and the Beast........Thanks again
[T],ctang,2010-10-04T05:34Z,"if your looking for beauty and the beast you will be waiting quite a while bc i dont have it...sorry bout that one

as for one who flew over the cuckoos nest, i posted that on here and on D and you are the first to reply to me on either site (although i did see it on there so maybe thats why nobody requested it)...if you arent on D then send me an email and i can get you a D invite that way i dont have to upload it and you still can have it since only 1 person replied to me (by they way, its is nice to have someone actually reply and read more than the first comment on the torrent!!)

-ctang (by the way, here is my email chrtang_bg@yahoo.com if you want the invite)"
,trytryagain1,2010-10-04T06:21Z,"Thanks for the kind words Ctang and thanks for the invite as well. Tater has so graciously already set me up on D.  I really appreciate the gesture though!!!
I'll check out D and see if I can find the Cuckoo's Nest over there.  THANKS AGAIN"
,trytryagain1,2010-10-05T03:56Z,"Found it last night I think I'm at around 30% now, thanks again."
,mrluckyman,2010-10-05T23:24Z,hey Ctang.  I finally copy protected dvds with CloneDVD but you gotta use DVDFab Passkey that's how it won't know it is protected :)
[T],ctang,2010-10-06T01:13Z,"mrluclyman:  i  really hate to say this but i do not have any idea what you are trying to say...im really not trying to be a dick

trytryagain1:  glad you found it...did you get it done yet...how is the quality?"
,mrluckyman,2010-10-06T14:39Z,"do u remember few months ago or weeks ago.  that i can't copy protected dvds with Clonedvd right?  so I do now because I got DVDFab Passkey installed then use clonedvd to copy protected while DVDFab Passkey removed protected like CSS, RC, APS, UOPS, etc... you should try it by install ""DVDFab Passkey"" which located at: http://www.dvdfab.com/passkey.htm and download it and restart your laptop/PC/Mac whatever u use for take a effect so once it is enabled then u can put dvds in your pc/mac and it will removed protected and invalid cell or fake vts before u use Clonedvd so Clonedvd won't know that protected dvd is existed because of passkey removed before u use Clonedvd.  so do u understand what im saying?"
[T],ctang,2010-10-06T18:36Z,"yes i do now...i use dvdfab platinum to strip all the copy protection from my dvd's and use dvdfab passkey when i already have the files on my computer (use it when i download a dvd from the internet and want to make sure there isnt any copy protection on the disc)...by the way, i was tired when i read your comment and when i read it the next day i kinda understood what you were saying but thank you for clarifying
