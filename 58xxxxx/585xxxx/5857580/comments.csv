Thanks in advance, and please go easy, this is the first time i've downloaded a game (other than NDS)."
,Murt3N,2010-11-17T14:52Z,"@ypay4it

You need to download a noCD/DVD crack.
Something like: crack fifa 11 pc.

Download it,
Go ot C./ Program files,
Open the map : EA sports or something like that,
replace the file inside the crack map with the file in your program files,
Play fifa 11 ! :D
If it doesnt work, say it, I give you other options :)

Good luck !"

What you do is copy the crack file and paste it into the GAME folder in which you installed the game to."

Thanks."
,Floriske,2012-04-10T09:38Z,"I've installed the game, but when I want to start it, it says: fifaconfig doesn't work any more, searching for a solution.
And when I want to copy the crack en past it over the game, it says: The program cannot be start becouse d3dx9_41.dll is missing on your pc. You can probably fix this problem by installing the programme again.
But I did this three times! Can somebody help me please? I really want to play this game!

And, don't look after my english, I've only had three years."
