,DDRobert,2010-11-01T19:04Z,"anilpiggy, it might be one of the ones that HAS TO be installed on the INTERANAL HDD to run, I know NFS - Shift and DiRT 2 have to be. As well as Red Dead Redemption, but only if you can't ftp to an external (due to one file being WAY over the 4GB hard limit on FAt32 HDD's)"
,tyler-fn-durden,2010-11-07T19:57Z,this didnt work for me it would just hang at the dagger both from external and internal....I found a USA version and it works fine so......

,brugger,2011-01-09T22:41Z,"I'm not able to run the game, the PS3 only reads external drive in FAT32 format and there is a file larger than 4Gb this game. How are you doing to play this game? And as you are able to put the file larger than 4 Gb external hard drive in FAT32 format?
I need help to solve this problem, I use PS3Key jailbreak, everything runs so far the only problem is to get the file into the external HD."
,skyz_ero,2011-01-16T01:43Z,"Did not work for me on external. Same issue as Brugger. Probably why I had the same problem as r0m4n, chromep2, and tyler."

,Dielk,2011-08-19T18:05Z,"NOT WORKING on 3.55 Kmeaw cfw

It will freeze up on some point at chapter 1. You will be stuck at the spinning dagger screen (loading screen). When you try to quit the game, the ps3 will beep 3 times and then shut down. Tried every fix i could get on the net (eboot and param.sfo fix, disabling auto-save feature, deleting the update 1.09, deleting game data) but not of em works. Can somebody give me a link on a USA version, heard that one works."
