	Somewhat fact-based story of the lives and attempted 1962 escape of several inmates in the famous correctional facility. Young inmate Clarence Carnes masterminds a grand escape involving several inmates who have nothing to lose, serving life sentences. (Taken from the IMDb) 

	Here's one I can't find anywhere for downloading. I recorded the original to VHS in the early '80s. This is a fairly good, VHS quality copy, and personally, I think it's quite watchable. I actually met Clarence Carnes once! Hope you can enjoy this one as much as I do. ;-)
