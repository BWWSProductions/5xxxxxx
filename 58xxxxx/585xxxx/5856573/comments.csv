Several of us stuck at 98.7%.
Thanks."
,c.biyuan,2010-11-20T02:06Z,"If you're stuck at 98.7% the .mp3 files might play anyway. They're identical to the ones in the equivalent torrent I uploaded (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5852709), and I'm seeding this one using those (though my client still tells me the files are 98.44~99.49% done, with the demonoid txt file missing).

If they actually don't play you can try that other torrent (point it at the same files so you don't have to start from zero)."
