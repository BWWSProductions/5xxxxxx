Barbarosa (1982)
Gary Busey, Willie Nelson

Plot summary:
Karl Westover, an inexperienced farm boy, runs away after
unintentionally killing a neighbor, whose family pursues
him for vengeance. He meets Barbarosa, a gunman of near-
mythical proportions, who is himself in danger from his
father-in-law Don Braulio, a wealthy Mexican rancher. Don
Braulio wants Barbarosa dead for marrying his daughter
against the father's will. Barbarosa reluctantly takes
the clumsy Karl on as a partner, as both of them look to
survive the forces lining up against them.
