From BrillianceAudio.com:

 It is 1951 in America, the second year of the Korean War. A studious, 
law-abiding, intense youngster from Newark, New Jersey, Marcus Messner, 
is beginning his sophomore year on the pastoral, conservative campus of 
Ohioâ€™s Winesburg College. And why is he there and not at a local college 
in Newark where he originally enrolled? Because his father, the sturdy, 
hard-working neighborhood butcher, seems to have gone mad â€“ mad with fear 
and apprehension of the dangers of adult life, the dangers of the world, 
the dangers he sees in every corner for his beloved boy. 

As the long-suffering, desperately harassed mother tells her son, the 
fatherâ€™s fear arises from love and pride. Perhaps, but it produces too 
much anger in Marcus for him to endure living with his parents any 
longer. He leaves them and, far from Newark, in the midwestern college, 
has to find his way amid the customs and constrictions of another 
American world. 

Indignation, Philip Rothâ€™s twenty-ninth book, tells the story of the 
young manâ€™s education in lifeâ€™s terrifying chances and bizarre 
obstructions. It is a story of inexperience, foolishness, intellectual 
resistance, sexual discovery, courage, and error. It is a story told with 
all the inventive energy and wit Roth has at his command, at once a 
startling departure from the haunted narratives of old age and experience 
in his recent books and a powerful addition to his investigations of the 
impact of American history on the life of the vulnerable individual.

Amazon.com Review

Amazon Best of the Month, September 2008: Enter once again into the echo 
chamber of Philip Roth's memory and imagination. In the second year of 
the Korean War, a butcher's son--a straight-A student wound tight with 
aspiration--flees Newark and his father's increasingly unhinged fears for 
his safety. Heading midwest, he finds a strange collegiate land of 
fraternities, football heroes, V-neck pullover sweaters and white 
buckskin shoes, panty raids, and mandatory chapel services, and, most 
startlingly, a young woman with desires of her own. Like another fiction 
grandmaster of his generation, Alice Munro, Roth seems able to spin 
infinite surprising tales from a few familiar building blocks, and in 
Indignation, his 25th novel, he has constructed a taut, haunting (and, as 
always, funny) story that ranks among his best. Reading at times like a 
buttoned-down Portnoy's Complaint (if it's possible to imagine such a 
thing), Indignation records a series of small explosions against '50s 
propriety and the dire consequences they lead to, capturing the misery of 
desire amid repression, along with the greater terror of being trapped in 
endless, relentless memory.
