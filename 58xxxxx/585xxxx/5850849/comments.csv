If you ( everybody ) look at a torrent and it has no screenshots ( for porn) or link to boxcover/official info about the file ( for films or tvseries etc) google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out who dont know what the file is ! please dont be as  lazy as 95% of tpb users and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself , the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now !
also seed dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets you upload eg a 50mb download service probably has a 1.5mb upload speed, the faster you upload the faster you download thats how bittorent works.
im not a hypocrite sometimes when i go to post info tpb says error etc failed to write..i dont have time to remember to go back to the files i couldnt help out on..so if u spot files needing info please help out"
