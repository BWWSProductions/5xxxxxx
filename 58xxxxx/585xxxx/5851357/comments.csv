,OrpheusDude,2011-01-02T11:53Z,"To big_dad_e: If you're going to go to the trouble to upload a Criterion Collection release, why the hell do you not include any of the extras (i.e. director's commentary) that make Criterion DVDs so special (and damned expensive)?  As much as I thank you for this torrent, I truly wish you would have uploaded at least the first of two discs as a VIDEO_TS file with all the extras, and maybe the second disc as well.  And your .avi upload isn't that great, by the way.  Just watching on my laptop, a great deal of the darker parts of the film (of which there are many) are annoyingly pixelated.  Next time, do a VIDEO_TS rip, please!"
