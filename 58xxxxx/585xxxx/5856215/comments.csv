Thanks for the upload."
,jet233,2010-10-13T10:37Z,thanks for the upload....can u tell me how to install this in my PC. 
,lwiee123,2010-10-17T14:05Z,"do i only have to place the file on a usb stick and then put it in my ps3?
plzz tell me"
,Omis_oz,2010-10-20T12:08Z,"xs1.... I have the same problem as you. I have quite a few games working on the PS3 but after sitting though a 230 MB download update to the games, i get an initial video and then a blank screen. Will post again if I see what is going wrong as you might have same problem, as it seems many other people are successful with the torrent.... so can't be rocket science."
,Omis_oz,2010-10-20T13:41Z,"ok xs1... the games fine. I think my ftp server may have been a little overloaded the first time round and messed up a file or two. So just cleaned out old files and did it again. Only other recommendation is have another original ps3 disk in the drive, even if using supposedly diskless boot manager."
,DDRobert,2010-10-20T20:40Z,I haven't got any game to run diskless! but this one is so small I could burn it to a DVD and rip it using Backup Manager without ftp
,DDRobert,2010-10-21T06:01Z,"nevermind on the burning to a DVD idea, I tried that and when I go to backup manager to copy it to internal hdd it says error - gay boobs!"
,ray328,2010-10-26T18:58Z,"works on inside , not on extern disk... tested on PSBreak v.1.1."

,SmokyMcPot1010,2010-11-17T16:46Z,"If i write this on a dvd-r then, Boot it using swapmagic 3 on my ps2 if it would work? Just asking a question i dont want any dumbass remarks."
,SmokyMcPot1010,2010-11-17T16:49Z,"bobby667788, For my nigga, there is a way, if you go to your local walmart They have dvd-r 4.7, and i believe something around 10 gb disks. If you use one of those im sure it'll work for you"
