PLOT SUMMARY Four American soldiers who are in Iraq are sent on a mission to recover plates for printing 100 dollar bills that were used to print a billion dollars. After doing the job and returning to the base their commanding officer is killed in an explosion and the plates are stolen by another operative. They would be court martialed and sent to different prisons. 6 months later, the leader, Hannibal Smith is visited by a CIA spook who tells him he knows where the man who took the plates is and wants him and his men to recover it. So he helps him escape and he breaks out the others and they go after the plates. But after doing it, they discover that the spook might not be ok. And a military intelligence officer who was involved with one of them is pursuing them."

Movie was alright, could have been better. Movie was better than the horrible review it got. You can't expect this movie to be as good as the old tv show. worth watching."

,JazzTrmpter,2011-01-10T07:07Z,"Hey, thanks for the upload! 

When you include subtitles in the download, does that mean that there are parts that need subtitles?  Or are they just there optionally?  

If anyone else who downloads more of FXG's work than I do can answer this as well, thanks!"
,Ozzy_fan,2011-01-18T01:24Z,"Hey FXG_TEAM, 
I am fairly new to Torrents compared to most people on here. Let me start by saying Thank you Very Much for all of your hard work on all of these quality ups of yours!!! Your u/l's are always top quality & I never have to read the comments for A=?, V=?. if it saysâ€¦ By  FXG_team, Itâ€™s golden! I always trust your d/lâ€™s !!! I was wondering if you & your team accept donations of any kind? I myself donâ€™t think seeding alone plus a polite comment here and there is thank~you enough. I do seed as often & as much as I can however. If I may ask another question. My G/F wants to see  â€œFlicaâ€œ & ""Flicka 2"" in a bad way, Would you happen to have them? I would love to have both for her to watch back-to-back. When sheâ€™s happyâ€¦ Iâ€™m happy :o)~ I will give you my email addy so you can answer my first & second questions, if you get the time. I appreciate you sharing all of these quality torrents with everyone. Thanks once again for all of your hard work...it is very much appreciated!!!  Ozzyfan
