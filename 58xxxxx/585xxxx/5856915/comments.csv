So this is censored version?"
,nehoc,2011-04-24T20:34Z,"Ignore my previous post, found an answer:

(Editor's Note: The first thing you see when playing Paramount's Wonder Boys DVD is a note that this edition has been ""edited for content."" IMDb.com notes ""In the theatrical version Tobey Maguire mistakenly refers to Alan Ladd's death as a suicide. After complaints from Ladd's family, Paramount has announced that the offending line will be modified in all future releases of the film, including home video."" Paramount has told us that this is the only change in the home-video version of Wonder Boys, a seamless, unnoticeable edit that does not materially affect the film itself.)"
