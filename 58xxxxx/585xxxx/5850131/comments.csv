,hafina,2010-09-25T16:54Z,"Hi thethingy - just curious, what happened to your permanently activated office?"
[V],thethingy,2010-09-25T17:07Z,"hafina, it wasjust a serial and all the activations are now used up, if you got activated then office stays activated"
,hafina,2010-09-25T21:05Z,"thethingy - well I thought so. I am in the clear (office-wise at least), but I just wondered if all the bickering scared you off. Keep up the good work!"
,jersson,2010-09-25T23:08Z,What happened to your Office registered for ever my man. Did you take it away from PB ?
[V],thethingy,2010-09-25T23:33Z,"jersson, activations were used up, ill post another shortly if that one dont get more activations added"
[V],thethingy,2010-09-26T00:02Z,"hafina, no that chesOmaster or whatever is just a fool, thinks keeping a mak that's not his is going to stop it being use, whoever buys a 1000 mak will obviously need 1000 activations so the mak will die like all mak's will die"
,Turgoo,2010-09-26T09:06Z,Look like you need to active the software with a purchased license number to get sound i avchd (.mts) files to work.   http://forums.adobe.com/message/3159720

,stroozberry,2010-09-30T00:47Z,"hey I'm pretty new at this and, this may sound like a REALLY dumb question, but when I go to the Command prompt, and perform the actions said on he instructions, it gives me an error message...

""the requested operation requires elevation""

is it supposed to do that? o.o"
[V],thethingy,2010-10-01T00:07Z,"stroozberry, that's just to flush the dns cash so the hosts blocks work straight away, you can restart for that to happen also, but right click the cmd and select run as admin."
,modesto007,2010-10-07T08:22Z,"@Thethingy

,mike882,2010-10-26T22:49Z,"this is gr8! nice work as always thethingy! clean full wrking dl! did not have any problems..

one thing, steps 7-8 in the hosts set-up files are hard to follow (at least for me). From what i understand you have to a) copy lines after the "":: 1 local host"" line to a .txt in desktop and rename the file in etc folder (hostsbackup), b) copy the hosts file that you dl here to the etc folder, c) copy the data from the desktop .txt to the new hosts file.

hope this helps ;)"

,Markymoo123,2010-11-11T15:47Z,"Hey thethingy, what your doing is great, hoever when i try to download any of your adobe selection, they just constantly stay in the 'connecting' status. Im talking 4 hours for one before i cancelled, is this normal? because all the ones i tried did have many seeders. Thanks mate. "
,Markymoo123,2010-11-11T15:59Z,"Hey man this is fantastic stuff, but i struggle to download, even after all the seeders it says im still 'connecting' am i doing something wrong? ive tried 5 of your adobe selection. Hope this makes sense. Thanks in advance. "

,the_Masq,2010-12-06T02:19Z,"I suspect this is a deliberately leaked version. The interface is really laggy, and the program crashes often.

,coderX,2011-04-18T14:29Z,Did everything you said to do and it worked great! I was hesitant at first because the host file looked radically different than the host files I've seen before. But I'm glad I took the risk. This works 100%! I blocked internet access to the program just to be safe.... Thank you thethingy

by the same up-loader of this torrent. It's a great series of video tuts. "
,coderX,2011-04-18T14:39Z,"PS you could have been a little more clear with your host instructions. All you have to do is copy and paste the existing hosting file onto the desktop as a backup, then copy and replace the host file in your system32 with the one given and your done. Instead, you ramble on about getting admin permission to edit the file and copying info to a text file..."
,coderX,2011-04-22T10:33Z,Ok this worked very well for a whil but when I go to export my movies I get a dialog box stating to enter an unlock for this feature. What is causing this?
,coderX,2011-04-22T10:43Z,update: exporting in anything other than flv gives me an unlock feature error.

,AryaNFirE2010,2011-05-21T23:29Z,"Well I've got it to work just fine and am making my first big project on this which is a birthday video for a friend with lots of photos and no footage. The main problem I get is that after about 30-40 mins of using, it starts slowing down and at some point I get the ""low on memory"" error and it goes too slow, when all I can do is save the project and restart to get it back to normal. I've tried all the clean up softwares and my drives have 0% fragmentation etc (solutions on their website) but I'm still getting this problem. Any help??"
,AryaNFirE2010,2011-05-21T23:32Z,"Oh and there is no problem with my memory, I can play games like Crysis2 maxed out on 45 fps. So I don't see why it should lag SO bad on a video editing software. And yes, I do render!"

,yuraku1,2011-06-30T21:15Z,"@thethingy For those having problem with the audio export (like only video, with no audio), there is a problem with the installation file... which I managed to find the solution for.

If you look at C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Elements 9\MediaIO\codecs - you will see the file dolby.vca is missing. This is an essential codec for the h264 audio encoding.

1) Now unpack the install folder from this torrent again and go into SOFTWARE folder. Now open the Data1.cab file with a program like PowerArchiver.

2) Search the file list and you should find dolby.vca

3) Extract file and then copy to C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Elements 9\MediaIO\codecs

4) You'll find now that Dolby Digital codec and sound problems don't happen anymore :)

Perhaps you can fix the installation cab, thethingy? Still, thanks for an excellent release.
