,japhy4,2011-03-12T15:23Z,"due it does work if you are a techie OK here is what you do DO THIS STEP BY STEP OK.

1. you know that file that says  ""HBEDV.KEY"" that doesn't have a program to use LEAVE IT LIKE THAT DO NOT TRY TO OMEN IT WITH A PROGRAM.

2. OK then what you do is you start instaling avira then when it gets to the activation code part there will be a little blue highlighted words that say something like ""do you already have a HBEDV. activation code""  YOU CLICK ON THAT a choose file box will come up.

3. go to the folder where you have your download and click on the HBEDV.KEY file ( if you do not see it don't panic just click on the files of type thing under the file name slot on the bottom of the box) 

4.omen the file and it will go straight on to the rest of the installation and ther you go you have aviara

your welcome everyone who was stuck on the code and comment again in you have any questions oh and sorry for any misspelled words i kinda suck at that"
,japhy4,2011-03-12T15:24Z,oh yea and sorry my last comment was for people who were stuck on the activation code
