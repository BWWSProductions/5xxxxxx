From RecordedBooks.com:

Acclaimed author Philip Rothâ€™s Patrimony won the National Book Critics 
Circle Award and was chosen by Time as best nonfiction book of the year. 
This deeply affecting memoir focuses on the time in the authorâ€™s life when 
he learned of his fatherâ€™s terminal brain cancer. A remarkable portrait of 
a father and son, this work confronts death and fear, and, ultimately, 
extracts the truth of what it means to love and be loved.

With the honesty of a skilled biographer and the sensitivity of a caring 
son, Roth chronicles the life of his father, Herman, in this gripping work 
which won a 1991 National Book Critics Circle Award. Roth holds little 
back in describing his father as a man of rare intensity and fierce 
independence who, for better or worse, stood by his principles and held 
others to his own rigorous standards. Writes Roth, "His obsessive 
stubbornness--his stubborn obsessiveness--had very nearly driven my mother 
to a breakdown in her final years." Frank throughout, Roth calls his 
father "a pitiless realist, but I wasn't his offspring for nothing, and I 
could be pretty realistic, too."
