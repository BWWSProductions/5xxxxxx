,SterLuMan,2010-09-27T17:11Z,i meant 50-ish... sry...
,wira020,2010-09-27T17:19Z,"@rockr
Yify hasnt even finish seeding to more people.. it's big.. so we need to wait a while until more people become seeders.."
,wira020,2010-09-27T17:38Z,"@starlumen
RiddlerA will do HouseMD all season soon.. and also all season of Supernatural... There's not much differences between Yify and RiddlerA's encoding... They're both great IMHO... 

p/s: am wondering if Futurama is still in the schedule.. hehe"
,LH-TAIMI,2010-09-28T21:22Z,"@rockr191 take it easy, its a 40 gigs torrent,

,Mathlol,2010-10-02T21:37Z,"Thanks for the compilation.  
For the latter fourth of the seasons, its nicer to enjoy at the individually seeded seasons at a higher video quality. 
Keep up the seeds."
,LH-TAIMI,2010-10-04T19:29Z,yepp 30% kinda and cant watch any of em to see quality :/

please seed  and return what you have got from others

still  thanks for the uploud"
,KingFisheR222,2010-10-10T22:13Z,"Please, someone, seed for God sake!!! "
,ArcWrath,2010-10-15T17:17Z,"I'm going to have to say this. If you are thinking of downloading this torrent, don't. Although majority of each episode can be downloaded, NOT ONE EPISODE WILL FINISH. Most of the file is simply not available because some people refuse to seed. Because of this a great package like this one is totally worthless. Save yourself the trouble and don't download."
,.ANCIENT.,2010-10-21T06:42Z,"23 days and now at 98.2 %, I'm gonna bust open a bottle of champagne when it's done. At all the complainers: This is a fresh torrent and has had only a single seed (YIFI), but once I hit 100% so will many others and there will be MANY seeds, and although I've already exceeded a 4:1 share ratio, I'll still seed and so will most, and THIS TORRENT IS GONNA ROCK! Thanks YIFI!"
,karlfunk,2010-10-21T14:44Z,"Ah, feels good man. Thanks for this awesome torrent, been dling it for more than three weeks and it's good to finally see it hit more seeders!

Will definitely seed for a long time! Thanks again!"
,KingFisheR222,2010-10-28T20:04Z,"SEED IT, guys, please. I've been downloading all day lond and still haven't got even the 1-st season. There 93 of those who have gotten the torrent finised and only 11 those who're seeding us!!! Please, don't be greedy ones, guys. SEED!!! "
,azztrix,2010-11-26T06:27Z,quality anyone?
,PaRiKaaLP,2010-11-30T09:49Z,"MAN U ROCK!!
ALL UR UPLOADS R GREAT !!!"
,KingFisheR222,2010-12-23T23:10Z,"Isn't it pathetic, guys, when you have been waiting for months to get a season?? Come on, damned leechers, give it mouth!! Don't be selfish. Here's 180 peers who have download it alrifgt and 4-5 is being  seeding!!! SeeeeeeeD! Unless wi're goona get it DOA!!! SeeeeeeD!!!"
,westjgames,2011-01-01T13:11Z,"Have to admit, this looks like a good torrent....  Untill you see that you are downloading at 10 kb/s... Now even though I live in Aus and the internet is shitty here, I still can download at speeds that exceed 150 kb/s, so 10kb/s is really sad. This site lists 40 seeds. There are currently 143 people seeding. However, around 726 (including myself) people are currently downloading. Actually, in the time taken to type this, the speed has dropped to 5.6 kb/s. If you are in Australia, and currently have this file, can you please not be a dick and seed it. Im only after a few eps at a time. Please, Don't Be Such A Douchbag."
,Dizzy42o,2011-01-06T21:47Z,"Could anyone tell me how this would look, after being converted and placed on dvd-r's? I'm currently finding all seasons seperately. But, these are much more compressed, and sorted. I would really love to save the time, and space, with this torrent. But, I would hate to lose too much quality. Would they look, at least, decent on a 42"" lcd?"
,geenotreally,2011-01-24T12:28Z,ALL episodes 320x240 or 352x232. Max resolution 344x240
,Vegemighty,2011-02-15T23:43Z,"Took me a week, but I got it. Great quality. Seeding commenced. "
,Dommy99,2011-03-12T16:54Z,"too bad season 13.. half the episodes are missing, half of them are doubles and renamed. ive watched seasons 14 and onward, and all are great! and great quality"

,Naota2354,2011-08-30T18:06Z,I will seed for a while once I get it fully downloaded. Know how frustrating it is to only be getting something at 1kbps from one seeder. This is a great show and I cant wait to sit down and watch the entire series.
,wadid,2011-08-31T19:41Z,i only donwload with 20 kb in sec max what happend?
,Naota2354,2011-09-02T08:12Z,"I'm getting an Element not found error, what the hell?"

,azvampyre,2012-01-18T04:39Z,"DO NOT USE U-TORRENT! Got to 93%, then it restarted, rewrote all the finished files to 0%.
Fuck you U-torrent you piece of shit!"
,azvampyre,2012-01-18T23:56Z,"After a system restore, I recovered the completed files, and have to say I wish I never recovered them.
The shows all look like 8mm quality from the 1970's and the BD movie is almost DVD quality...almost.
What a waste of bandwidth, geez."
,azvampyre,2012-01-19T00:11Z,"I forgot to mention. The movie has both chinese and english subtitles taking up a large portion of the screen...although the spoken text is in english.
PEOPLE, DON'T DOWNLOAD, DON'T SEED, GET THIS OFF THE SITE. GOD DAMN SOME PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID IT'S A MIRACLE YOU CAN AUTONOMOUSLY BREATHE!"
,polarbearable,2012-01-24T00:12Z,"Hmmm. 5 days of downloading at 60 kB/s (5% of my download bandwidth - 1.2 MB/s).  Seeds 18(557), Peers 55(1835). Says a lot about the ""Hit and run"" nature of previous peers. There's one seed/peer who appears briefly once in a while - the download speed jumps to around 800 kB/s - 1 MB/s. At least somebody has a conscience."
,thekiller13,2012-01-30T13:21Z,PLEASE PEOPLE SEED I WILL PERSONALLY SEED AFTER MY DOWNLOADS FINISH now who downloaded it SEEEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!its FRKN SLOW!

,BBizzle,2012-04-23T03:09Z,season 13 episode 16 and 17 are the same episode. I believe someone else said that all of season 13 is messed up FYI.

,mistersplunge,2012-05-05T04:35Z,"More than just season 13 (which only has about half the episodes twice in a row) are messed up. Season 15 has at least one episode with described video, and as much as I feel like a douche whining about free stuff, a lot of the episodes' quality is utter crap. There is no HDTV or DVDrip here. "
,dududus,2012-05-07T05:29Z,"These are dvd -> avi -> mkv so are quite blurry..but thanks, they look great on my phone."
,LazarheaD,2012-06-06T19:46Z,After Nostalgia critic's top 10 episodes I finally want to start watching these.
