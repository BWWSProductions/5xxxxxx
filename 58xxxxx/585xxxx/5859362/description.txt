S04E02 - The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification 

The Big Bang Theory is an American sitcom created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady.  Set in Pasadena, California, the show is about two fictional Caltech geniuses, one an experimental physicist (Leonard Hofstadter) and the other a theoretical physicist (Sheldon Cooper), who live across the hall from an attractive blonde waitress and aspiring actress (Penny). Leonard and Sheldon's geekiness and intellect are contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.
