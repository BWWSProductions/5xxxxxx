Quality is good as well."
,indie_guy,2011-11-11T17:27Z,"There are 2 versions of the same song? ""You"" What's the difference?"
,santipants,2011-12-20T13:10Z,"Don't download this garbage. The single ""You"" isn't even the real song, you can hear someone fumbling about like they used a tape recorder to record it from a speaker. Shit quality for the one song people will download it for."
