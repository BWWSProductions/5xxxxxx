,Frontline3920,2010-09-26T08:55Z,"@ hydroid

why the f*ck are you even using TPB? Obviously you know nothing about this nature of file and you also don't know what a false positive is.

Quit wasting space in the comment zone."
[V],Anacondaz,2010-09-26T10:47Z,"why no seeders mate
reply if possible"
[V],maestral,2010-09-26T10:49Z,"Ignoring all noobs upthere with false positive virus alerts, I'm wondering, how many days we get with this release? Thanx mate. Good upload as always."

,zloca,2010-09-26T20:49Z,"I got this one or I think 3.0  two weeks now .Got him on other site. It works just fine. Tested with malwarebytes, a-squared, norton AV 2010, norton AV 2011, outpost sec suite 7 and didnÂ´t find anything.And if somebody find something whats the point 2 complain if that false positive  working for you and not harm your system. Prob some people work for Symantec and love 2 spam here."
,aaruna6,2010-09-26T22:11Z,"Please seed people. It is stuck at 45%
Also is this similar to ntr 2010 wherein the subscription gets extended to 165 days?"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-26T23:50Z,"@maestral 
@aaruna6 

Norton TrialReset 2011 v3.1.0 gives 165 days. At the end of the subscription just uninstall the NTR2011-v3.1.0 and install it again."

All that you've confirmed is that you're retarded, cause you don't know how to confirm but think you can."

Please try to understand that this is a public site, so no private business
is done here. Try to keep comments torrent related. Also avoid posting the
same requests over and over again at someones torrents, and just wait
a while for an answer and before requesting the same again. 

For personal questions and requests try some forums, such as:
http://forum.suprbay.org/


I've asked you before to understand the TPB rules, and hopefully this time
you'll understand why there are certain rules here at TPB."

[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-29T23:02Z,"@gwapsako 

Just ignore the seeders/leechers stats. It's a known issue which happens sometimes, and TPB is busy fixing it."
,khadill,2010-10-13T19:39Z,"Hey Thanks Dude ,,, All Da Torrents I Use Is From U... Much Thanks Again For Making a World A Better Place"
,brianxxx,2010-10-21T17:36Z,"This Reset works quite nicely. I use this under VMWARE for my testing and experiments and normally, you have to have a clean VM or boot from Safe Mode.

This one worked like normal and without a hitch under VMWARE and Windows XP through 7 32 & 64 bit.

Very nice to see this sucker evolving! lol"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-10-22T00:16Z,"@brianxxx

,sbt2508,2010-11-18T22:25Z,"I don't really get it... 
My Anti Virus AVG keeps rejecking it. So I checked it at virustotal.com and it also said the file wasn't safe. 
But now I read these things here - but may not get the point?
So I just ask for a clear answer; should I just ignore it, because it's normal that these antivirus programs reacts at files like this one, or is it because someone have changed it?"

And now I can not erase my last comment that was sent by mistake. 
I apologize and I'm really sorry. 
Now it can hardly surprise anyone that my first question might be stupid."
,BigLilSteve,2011-01-23T15:53Z,"This has been working perfectly fine for me for the past few months, but over the last 2 weeks or so I have been getting a pop-up from Norton telling me I need to register to get the latest product updates.

My subscription hasn't expired (at 87 days presently), so I am still receiving definition updates but it's just annoying.

Anyone else getting this?"
