This 10th Season show I managed to find 
a few days ago...but had to wait till
The Pirate Bay allowed uploads again!

Unlike earlier Carol Burnett Shows that
other people encoded at 300 MB with no
deinterlacing,  this one IS deinterlaced
at 448 MB.  It's also larger because
the brief intro was included, which was a 
reunion in recent years with Carol,
Tim Conway, and the late Harvey Korman!
