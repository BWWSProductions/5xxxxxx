,Jewaids,2010-09-26T16:14Z,Why is the ps3 version 2 gb bigger than the xbox version? Can someone tell me?
,jeffmama11112,2010-09-26T16:16Z,cause microsoft are better at compressing games unlike sony :p
,beaky27,2010-09-26T16:18Z,"Or sony use blu-ray discs so can fit more into their games, where microsoft are restricted to a dual layer disc"
,Jewaids,2010-09-26T17:54Z,"No need for microsoft to compress Fifa11, because the iso is less mb than possible on a dl disc. Does the ps3 version has more detailed textures, etc? (can't imagine it does)"
[V],Morck22,2010-09-26T21:13Z,Dummies Inside... lol!!!!
,poeticpyro,2010-09-26T23:40Z,"I'm getting some killer download speeds man....

15-30 kB/s..

Could use some seeders because host doesn't output much of an upload speed."
,DoodleBop,2010-09-26T23:53Z,"Its just that the PS3 version doesn't have compressed files, enough space on BR.

But its the exact same game as X360.
Thats the objective of Sony .... make peoples think games are better on PS3 just because of the impressive capacity of the BR, but its bullshit, trust me.

The BR will only be ""decisive"" (if its still alive) the next generation of consoles (when games will be double the size)."
,given2flye,2010-09-30T15:55Z,"So, what is this ? [Ps3] ? Ps3 is not ""chiped"" yet right? "
,Quad-K,2010-10-05T06:51Z,"Actually, PS3 can be software modded now with a software called PSGroove. Look it up :)

Will download and give feedback once finished."
,simer007,2010-10-11T13:44Z,the blu ray is effective even some xbox games also come in more than 3 dual layer disks they also need bluray badly bcoz now games are getting much more than 8gb
,ray328,2010-10-24T10:54Z,"Works, just have problems with entering Tournament mode. Do you have or did something wrong? Didnt try to save game on internal, maybe is cause of that? Please help!"
,ray328,2010-10-24T19:18Z,"Solve problem with Tournament mode, must have BR disk inside, not working without. Tested with PS3Break usb.."
,Ocir,2010-10-26T08:52Z,"Ray328... How did you put this 8gb game on a external and make it work if a FAT32 hard drive can only work with 4gb files (something like that)? 


Or can you assist me in explaining how this 4gb stuff works on a external FAT32 please?

I am busy DL the game.

Thank you"
,keegznz,2010-10-27T14:31Z,"@Ocir
Because this isn't one 8gb file, it is split up into smaller sizes. Some games have files which are over 4gb hence why they don't work on a fat32 external."
,Ocir,2010-11-08T11:28Z,"Thank You Morck22!

Works great! Playing it from my external 500gb.

Thanks again!"
,Ocir,2010-11-08T11:29Z,Thank you keegznz for the reply on the FAT32 external question.  I understand now.
,sonic34,2010-11-10T10:50Z,"hi everone, i'm new to all this so will appreciate any help. how do i play this throught an external hdd? Do I need to have my ps3 chipped/modded? Sorry I know these are probable stupid questions but like i said i'm new :)"
,Ocir,2010-11-11T04:22Z,"@ sonic34

U have to have the PS3 modded.  At the moment only PS3 with software version 3.41 and below can be modded.  Once modded you create a folder under you external hardrive called GAMEZ extract the folder, usually called something like BLES1234500 or whatever, to the above mentioned GAMEZ folder on the external.

There is also an option to make use of FTP blackbox and filezilla to copy the game to your internal hrdrive of the PS3."
