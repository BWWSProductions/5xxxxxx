Pinky and Brain are genetically enhanced laboratory mice who reside
in a cage in the Acme Labs research facility. Brain is self
centered and scheming; Pinky is good-natured but
feebleminded. In each episode, Brain devises
a new plan to take over the world, which
ultimately ends in failure, usually
due to Pinky's idiocy or the
impossibility of Brain's
plan
