It only saves you 27 meg of upload bandwidth, but then everyone has to have a RAR program, decompress, and delete the RAR. In this case you only saved 4.5%. Is that really better then just having everyone download one video file and be done with it???

RAR files are for text and applications that aren't heavily compressed already.

If you can compress a video with XVid why do you not understand this???"
