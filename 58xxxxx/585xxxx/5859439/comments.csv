Failed everytime. I shut down my computer in disgust. The next day, I power up, try to install again and on first try, it worked. So, idk whats up. Just to LET EVERYONE KNOW, IT IS FOR 32 BIT SYSTEMS ONLY! IF IT WORKS ON 64 BIT, KUDOS TO YOU!"

My NOD32 doesn't detect a thing in this package!

However, your claim of 32-bit (x86) only doesn't fit with me, I run 64-bit (x64) Win 7 Ultimate and it works like a charm! :)
Perhaps it works on x64 when u install the latest Visual C libraries ;) (latest 2005, 2008 and 2010 editions) Don't know for sure, and cannot confirm that it's the problem, but it's worth a shot ;)"
