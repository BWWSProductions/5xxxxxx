         Proper notes: P0W4failure did a shitty fucking job of         
         guessed bitrate segmenting and totally destroyed the last     
         segment. Now we know segmenting isn't banned for TV XviD      
         (yet...) but if you're going to do it then at least do a      
         halfway fucking decent job of it. See included bitrate        
         graph to see the terrible guessing they did, and the          
         included quant graph to see what happened when they ran       
         out of bits at the end. Note the fairly even average quant    
         for a real 2 pass, and the huge spike in quants (and drop     
          in quality) when P0W4failure ran out of bits at the end.
