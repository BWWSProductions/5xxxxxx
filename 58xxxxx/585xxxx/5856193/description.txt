Here's a small collection of live sets and radio appearances by the indie rock band Surfer Blood that I have compiled. I wasn't the one who made any of these recordings, although I did record the KEXP and NPR streams and then split the files.

12/1/2009 - In-Studio Performance - This young West Palm Beach, Florida band made a big splash months before their debut album â€œAstro Coastâ€ was even released. Surfer Blood turns a mix of power-pop, retro-garage, surf, and more into something fresh and exciting. This set recorded live on KEXP.
