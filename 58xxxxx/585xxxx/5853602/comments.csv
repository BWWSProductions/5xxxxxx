,hootieman,2010-09-26T14:47Z,"This isn't very rare, I got the VHS screener of this way back when it came out in 1998 its quite popular"
[V],Kuthumi,2010-09-26T15:28Z,This is a DVDrip. I have never found a DVDrip for this film on any torrent sites. That's why it's very rare.
[V],Kuthumi,2010-09-26T19:23Z,"PirateBay's statistics are down at the moment. Correct for this torrent is 10 seeders, 33 leechers."
[V],Kuthumi,2010-10-08T14:59Z,"Thank you, Agentbay! Most trackers and PirateBay's statistics broke down just when I was uploading this torrent almost 2 weeks ago, and I have continued the seeding because everything is still wrong. If you have problems connecting, try adding the following trackers to the torrent:
http://tracker.publicbt.com/announce
http://tracker.ilibr.org/announce
In Vuze, you copy the tracker's url, right-click the torrent and choose Advanced>Tracker>Add tracker."

[V],Sagablanc,2010-10-12T03:42Z,"Hi kuthumi!
Have a proposition for you. Can you please contact me at: sagablanc(at)gmail.com"
,Party Hampster,2010-10-18T00:30Z,"Awesome work my friend. I was wondering if you could seed a movie I can't find anywhere but I think you might be the kinda person that would have it. I'm looking for ""By the Sword"" with eric roberts... IF there is any chance you would seed it I sure would be thankful...."
[V],Kuthumi,2010-10-19T11:32Z,"Thank you for the compliments! ""By the Sword"" is found here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4080254

If PirateBay's search engine is ""overloaded"", you can use torrentz dot com"
[V],Kuthumi,2010-12-03T17:52Z,PirateBay's statistics are wrong at the moment. This torrent is well seeded.
,InaraS,2010-12-03T23:56Z,Hi. Thanks for doing this. I have done the same for torrents I can't find. 
,jaykash_1,2011-07-22T21:16Z,How do i get it to work??
,BlacKRaiN_666,2012-03-14T01:17Z,This is the only upload of this torrent on piratebay soo..yeah I'd say it's pretty rare. There may be more on Demonoid though. Sometimes when I can't find a copy of something here there are plenty over there.
,bryentheartist,2012-04-05T04:27Z,thnx
