Just disable them , if you don't want to see them!"
,labtec10_4,2010-09-28T22:01Z,@quantron you cant do that they are hardcoded in the file ?

They not hardcoded. When you downloaded the torrent you probably downloaded everything that came with it, including the SRT and SUB files, those are the subtitels. Just find them,delete them, and you'll have subs-free Movie ;) .

BTW, raymondhome, thanks for uploading!

,apowers_1,2010-10-23T19:27Z,"If you have a hard-coded file with subs, try using a program like mkvmerge to remove them, its free and works very well.
Supports all files as well, but I have only used it on mkv files.
If you find it works on avi and mpegs, let us know.
I will also download the file and post if the srt is hard-coded or not."
,apowers_1,2010-10-23T20:31Z,"Nope, not hard-coded."
