IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO: Thanks to a very good friend...
AUDIO: Thanks to a very good friend...

Ok folks after reading some comments of missing footage, we went back and checked out the vobs we had and we found 2 of them weren't fully complete. So we go them resent and now we have a extras 4mins
Work done, well we made a script to alter the rgb colours, brightness, sharpness, contrast, chroma... also used some noise reduction filter.
The source isn't too bad for a cam but did and still does contain a few auto focus issues and also as lines across the screen... some parts look worse than others, but we cleaned them up the best we could.
Also the audio does have a slight hum to it... but still pretty decent for cam audio.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
