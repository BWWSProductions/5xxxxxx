,KungFuKane,2011-05-15T08:51Z,Thanks for the vids. Is there a trick to pixsor or does it just suck?
,OttifantSir2,2011-06-12T15:20Z,"Pixsor no longer is a viable source for images, as they lost about 90% of their database a while back when their servers got fried... No backups it would seem, as I have yet to find ONE link to them that doesn't say ""Requested Image Not Found"""
