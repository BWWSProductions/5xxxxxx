,skatealk3,2010-09-28T02:40Z,Thanks for the Upload Dude! Much Appreciated
,pro2oman,2010-10-10T21:52Z,is this really a diamond rip being 1-2 weeks before street date or is it a platinum?
,Padoogi,2010-10-13T07:00Z,Incredible quality! Works great on VLC... it will crash your WDTV though.. so maybe it's too good. :P
,Maverick1283,2010-10-23T13:29Z,"Downloaded... and disappointedly didn't work. Started for couple minutes of dark then poof nothing... also WDTV comment is true, the file just loads as nothing why? Still in search of a good copy of this film! Would like to have the Diamond Edition."
,pro2oman,2010-10-24T16:10Z,so this is not the diamond?
,skeptic4all,2011-07-21T16:14Z,Didn't work on any player. It's too big. Not worth the effort.  I even converted to different format. couldn't get it to work.  I found one 1.4gigs worked beautifully. Keep looking ...Sorry Mafiaa
,AXHEJAZ,2011-08-01T21:20Z,"For all those people who say the movie doesn't work, YOU GUY'S are amateurs, nupsters, or plain idiots! Mafiaa didn't earn VIP patch for crappy torrents! The file is in a super HD format called MKV so you need to download the ""ccc pack codec"" (just Google it and you'll see it in the suggestion box), install it and leave all the options as default. Than simply click on the movie and it will play in â€œwindows media playerâ€ if it didnâ€™t work at first DONâ€™T CRY, just right click on the movie and navigate to â€œopen withâ€ and choose windows media player (maybe you need to choose it manually) but the movie is in SUPER HD format and it truly is FLAWLESS! Thanks Mafiaa! Amateurs bow down! ;)"
,angel22d,2011-09-05T16:59Z,"wow what an awesome upload, 10 out of 10!!! keep up the good work MAFIAA!!!!"
,skellett,2012-01-24T23:52Z,"I am completely an amateur, I don't even pretend not to be. I downloaded this, and as expected it didn't work right away. On VLC I got crystal clear sound, and no image. On Media Play Classic I got picture and sound, both REALLY choppy. I downloaded the ccc pack codec, and it didn't change anything. I also googled this problem to see if I could find some help, which I then followed (changing the settings in VLC) but to no avail it doesn't work. I know it's not the download, I know it's me and I don't know what I am doing. Can anyone help me out?"
,MovieFan84,2012-06-25T23:09Z,Worked on my WDTV but there was no audio. Converted it to an Mp4 file and it worked but file size went from 6GB to 3GB.
