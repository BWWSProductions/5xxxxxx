An instrumental album, released in 2002 by the musician on his vanity label, Scrummy Records (P.O. Box 572, Amagansett, Long Island, NY 11930). I can't even find a bio of this guy, let alone a Wikipedia page.


I bought this CD at Frenchy's for $1.25, still in the original shrink wrap. I didn't know what to make of it, but my girlfriend, whose musical tastes are more Sixties/Seventies and operatic than mine, liked it. From what little I could find online, the critics hated it. So YMMV.
