If you're trying to suggest that homosexuality is genetic, you're dead wrong. There is not one iota of real science to back up this insinuation. There is more to suggest that is simply a choice. Homosexuality is as abnormal as pedophilia and bestiality, and these are choices, aren't they? Or will you also contend that they are genetic too? If homosexuality is, then shouldn't other two these be also?

Let's get real and not push some gay political agenda. If you're going to discuss science, get real science."

@Tamarindjerk4jeebus666
Why do you feel the need to troll around Gay themed torrents? You reveal too much about yourself. Go be disgusted with yourself somewhere else. Nobody is making you download gay-themed files. Go pray your gay away somewhere else. . . or you could just accept yourself as you are. 

This book is about science and research, not mythology that self-loathers use to try and make everybody as miserable as them."
,Tamarind777,2011-07-23T08:12Z,"Lol...homosexual behaviors among animals???? Lol...Animals mount each other to show dominance over another animal. What a joke. This is science? How come animals NEVER, and I repeat, NEVER engage in penetrative sex? Why is it ONLY mounting behavior? Also, twin studies don't back up this idiocy either. 

me_the_z: You have no clue what you're speaking about either. Go and read a book about TRUE science. If gays are born that way, then where is the morphological difference in kids? If folks are gay since childhood, then these differences should be there from a young age, and they're NOT. Try reading up on epigenetics. Behaviors (like gay men acting and thinking they're women) CAN cause changes in brain structure that to make certain areas look more feminine. Levay's work is voodoo nonsence!

Yes, I am very interested in this crap because I like exposing it by using their own idiocy. And I do love the Jesus who you mock. One day he will judge your sin-loving, foolish ways and find you wanting. Laugh now, for one day you will grind your teeth to powder in shame when you see that you traded Heaven and everlasting life for an orgasm. Fools!"
,MacFheorais,2011-10-15T10:13Z,"@ Tamarind777 - you haven't a clue what you're talking about. When you talk about some imaginary muppet who will ""judge your sin-loving, foolish ways and find you wanting"", and then refer to ""true science"", all you do is publicly advertise your blinding stupidity and lack of education for all to see.

How embarrassing for you. I can only assume your family were too poor to pay for even the most rudimentary scientific education. "
,stoneyyay,2012-02-14T11:07Z,"@Tamarind777 I loled at your ignorance sir. god, along with ur jesus has been disproven 100 times over now with science. a sexual devient is one thing I am not, i have sex with consenting adults, who enjoy similar activities as myself. for the record animals have exhibited homosexual behaviours for centuries, and im not talking about dominant mounting. you need to get ur shit straight before coming on here and flaming content you have no interest in downloading! thx bookzilla, this should help with my thesis! have to see if my chapters has a copy :D"
