NOTES! Many thx to IMAGiNE for the source wich i work a little bit and change the brightness and contrast,
and then i work`it a little bit the sound, & increase the volume.
I make the files much smaller without damaging the quality of the movie, and smaller files means faster downloading.
Works with all DVD Players and Compatible > PS3 & XBOX 360.

Gratitude and Respect to:
IMAGiNE, FUSiON, ELEKTRI4KA, PrisM , SecretMyth, Noir, X, LEGiON
