,pj2985,2010-10-06T17:15Z,"Burn the disc again and slower, problem glitch in the burning process. Don't run other shit on your pc while burning and dont let your screensaver come up either."
,dodoSKC,2010-10-10T18:49Z,"I believe this is the unfinished version. MARVEL uploaded it first on September 26th and as I can see, this is also updated on the exact same date. The thing is, I burned MARVEL's version and when I play any type of match THERE IS NO player of the game sequence or game wrap up feature, therefore you can't view pressbook, gatorade highlights etc. If you don't believe me, download it, but I'm afraid you'll be very disappointed."
