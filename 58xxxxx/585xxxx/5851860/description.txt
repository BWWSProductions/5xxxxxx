
Slow

You make me want to sing about love
Every time I raise my head
You make me want to tell the whole world
What Iâ€™ve found is good

Then they say
Slow
Slow this right down
Donâ€™t burn it out
Donâ€™t let it show
Slow
Oh but my heart is racing
To hold your gaze and
let it go

My love, my love my love
killinâ€™ time is easy when youâ€™re here
From dreams Iâ€™ve seen you before
Youâ€™re so familiar
And everywhere I go
Hear me calling for your love
Cause if itâ€™s you
I will disarm you
And if itâ€™s you
Do you know how to calm me down
Oh let me sleep in your arms
Then I wonâ€™t hear them singing

Slow
Slow this right down
Donâ€™t burn it out
Donâ€™t let it show
Slow
Oh but my heart is racing
to hold your gaze then
let it go

You make me want to sing about love
Even though you donâ€™t wanna know
You make me want to tell the whole world
But I know
You donâ€™t like it
You donâ€™t like it
You donâ€™t like it
