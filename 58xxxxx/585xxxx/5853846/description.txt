In 1983, Patrick Ball released the first record in his Celtic Harp series. Now, ten years and five releases later, he has completed his most personal work to date. Fiona is a collection of traditional songs that includes some of the most beautiful and haunting tunes of the Celtic world - and is named after Patrick Ball\'s new daughter, Fiona.

For many years, the Celtic harp, with its unique resonance and clear, bell-like sound was an important part of Celtic life, especially in Ireland and in France\'s Celtic province, Brittany. The few harps which survived into the 20th century, did so as museum pieces, and their incredibly large and varied repertoire began to sink into obscurity, too. Naturally, as musicians and listeners have rediscovered the beauty of these instruments, the old songs and laments have been rediscovered as well.

On Fiona, Ball includes two of Ireland\'s most enduring and memorable folk songs: She Moved Through the Fair, an oft recorded classic which can now finally be heard in its original form, and Brian Boru\'s March, an ancient tune marking the brief unification of Ireland in the 11th century. Traditional songs from Scotland and Brittany also appear, along with a work by Turlough O\'Carolan, whose popular music has been a feature of each of Patrick Ball\'s six recordings for Celestial Harmonies/Fortuna. Ball\'s wire-strung harp is the focus of this recording, but the traditional Irish pipes, whistles, and fiddle provide an occasional complement on several pieces.
