I'm Not Alone is a horror game staring Patrick Weber, an exorcist who totally has a name, who has been summoned to a mysterious Austrian mansion to free it from supernatural evil. it was released on steam as a full priced game. There are currently, no reviews of this game.

****Story****
 I'm Not Alone's story, such as it is, centres around Patrick Weber, an exorcist who possesses the ability to see into the daemon world, where he can see restless spirits and hostile presences. The title comes from the fact that this ability has left him painfully aware of the fact that he is "never alone". Patrick is called to a mansion in the Austrian mountains by its new owner, an elderly woman named Caroline, to free said mansion of demons, ghouls, and all things scary. The house was originally owned by a musician named Lilian Von Gruber, who was infamous for murdering dozens of people, including all of his servants and staff, before mysteriously disappearing. Now, the house is incredibly haunted, and Caroline has been cursed to be unable to leave the premises, fearing for her life from the numerous monsters and demons. As can be expected, these demons are none too pleased to have an exorcist in their home, and so Patrick must use his abilities to rid the mansions of all things evil. The player can use his psychic powers so that Patrick can see the daemon world, allowing him to fight the demons using a pair of magical daggers and a crossbow that fires two kinds of magical bolts.
 
A journal found early in the game describes von Gruber's descent into madness after the death of his mother, whom he was obsessed with. In an attempt to resurrect her, he became a priest of the demon lord Baphomet, murdering innocent people as sacrifices to the demon. However, even after the dozens of murders required to appease him, Baphomet betrayed the human (no surprise) and while Von Gruber's mother's body was reanimated, her soul remained in the afterlife. Instead, Thamiel, a powerful demon minion of Baphomet's, was allowed to possess the old woman's corpse, intending to destroy the world through her new avatar. However, the journal ends with Von Gruber believing that he is himself becoming possessed by the demon, and regretting all his evil deeds. There is no explanation for why Thamiel didn't destroy the world.

****Weapons****
 Patrick has access to exactly two types of weapons: a pair of daggers and a crossbow.  The two daggers have two different magical effects. The SOLVE dagger (the one bound to the left mouse button) refills Patrick's health with every successful attack on a monster. The COAGULA dagger (the right mouse button) fills up a "Panic Bar" with each attack, which, when full, triggers "Over Panic" mode. Supposedly, in Over Panic mode, Patrick's attacks become stronger and more precise, but in reality, there doesn't seem to be any difference in gameplay. The combat tutorial also states that "When the Over Panic Bar lights up, you will be able to launch a double power attack", whatever that means. Both daggers deal the same amount of damage to the enemy. The crossbow is Patrick's ranged weapon, and does more damage than the daggers, at the cost of being slower to attack. The crossbow can fire SOLVE bolts and COAGULA bolts at any time, despite there clearly being only one bolt loaded in at any given time, and just like the daggers, they refill Patrick's health and fill up his Panic Bar, respectively. There is no ammunition, Patrick never runs out of bolts.

****Monsters****
All of Von Gruber's many victims have been reanimated as monsters that Patrick must face in his struggle against evil. The majority of them are Crawlers, the murdered spirits of young men who actually do not crawl, instead sort of shuffling towards Patrick before trying a melee attack, that is unless he kills them first with his powerful crossbow, which is likely. Crawlers come in three flavours: small, big (which act identically to small ones except for having more health and dealing more damage) and a third variety which looks like the small ones but have a ranged attack.

Another variety are Virgins, the spirits of innocent virgins drowned in the backyard swamps by Von Gruber as part of his dark ritual. They also walk up to you and use a melee attack. The females have a unique model, but the males are essentially small Crawlers with different sound effects.

Other than Crawlers and Virgins, Von Gruber's many murdered servants have been reincarnated as bosses, such as a pair of twin maids armed with steak knives, a butcher armed with a large cleaver, and a gardener armed with a scythe. 

None of the enemies are especially difficult to kill: the ones with melee attacks will run up to Patrick and begin an attack, while the ones with ranged attacks will stand in one spot and shoot at him, only moving if he moves somewhere they can't hit him. His weapons cause such an exaggerated hit animation that once he gets a successful attack on a monster, he's basically already won. The only monster that differs from this is an early boss that appears to be a reanimated little girl, who crawls around on all fours (unlike the Crawlers). The little girl still doesn't use any kind of strategy, she just runs up to Patrick, attempts to attack, and then runs away in a random direction, moving around the room that way until she chooses to charge Patrick again. This would probably be a more effective strategy if she had any kind of ranged attack, but as Patrick also lacks a ranged attack at that point, the battle mainly consists of waiting for the girl to run up to you so you can slash her a couple times before she runs off again.
