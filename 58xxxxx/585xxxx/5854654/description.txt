In Raptor Force, youâ€™ll learn the secrets of these astonishing aerialists, and how theyâ€™ve mastered, more than any other type of bird, the art of soaring. And with the help of engineer and falconer Rob MacIntyreâ€™s ingenious miniature television station â€” a camera, transmitter, and battery small enough to be harnessed onto the backs of raptors â€” youâ€™ll see for yourself what itâ€™s like to fly with these deadly aces.


Take off with the biggest, fastest, and deadliest things on wings! Birds of prey are an elite group of fliers that are the envy of every human air force. Their targeting skills, cunning battle tactics, and nimbleness on the wing are unmatched by any machine. Miniature cameras mounted on large hawks as they soar and dive reveal the secrets of nature's aerial killing machines!
