[V],globeplus,2010-09-30T22:17Z,"Ok , full game without commentarys , this time all the comments was on the same file , i am still trying to get the comments one by one but it is beeing tough because they putted all together , sorry about this but it is really full gameplay , all the teams and all the competitions ."
[V],globeplus,2010-09-30T22:24Z,"I donÂ´t remember to call anyone herer at this comments to put negative comments without fundament : my work is to do pratical files and that ut is what i do , i analised this one and because all the comments was together and they are not really relevant to the gameplay for shore including that they can be disabled inside the game because they are only n extra feature , i want the possible users think with me for a second : the main gameplay after the nice work is 1,53 gb and i have the risk because they are audio files without almost no compression to have more size for the comments than for the main file , it is many users out there that appreciate this type of work specially because the size , not only the hard disc space but also the downloadable ammount that can use for a certain period of time and if it is keep it like this is to give the file more than the double of the size just for comments , i will continue my criterious analysis on the possibilitys but certainly i made it the correct option for the circunstances . Thank you for understanding . "
[V],globeplus,2010-09-30T23:13Z,"This is just for saying that i am not helping anymore after watching many isers not helping after the doaling , maybe they wanted the comments and u was find a way for that but i just don´t care about thyis file anymore and i am ashame to upload files . Sorry for my work and bye."
,yknight,2010-09-30T23:19Z,ur the best........keep it up.... don't count on these stupid people.......we need the size and the better game play if they want quality video then go see the movie in theater don't play the game you stupid morons............like us size is the matter in our country we have any speed network to download whole 6gb game.........
[V],globeplus,2010-09-30T23:32Z,"To finish just for saying that i don´t win any money for making files and i am really totally disappointed with the comportment from the uysers that listen more a couple of morrons that are trying to impernate the file than me and that simply sucks , i don´t win any money and maybe i acan be start thinking in stoping uploading files becaus eit is lot of work and the users treat the uploaders like shit and i ashamed i repeat from uploading files !"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-30T23:39Z,"FINAL STATISTIC ABOU THE POSSIBLE WORK ON THIS FILE : 1.53 - MAIN INSTALLATION FILE WITH THE GAME GAMEPLAY , COMMENTS : CLOSE 1.8 GB , I REPEAT WHAT I NORMALLY DO IS PRATICAL FILES , SOMEONE SAID YOU CUT THE FILE IN HALF ONE OF THE MY BELOVED CONCORRENTS , WELL ONLY THE COMMENTS ARE 60% OR SOMETHING OF THE FILE ... AND THEY ARE REALLY NECESSARY TO PLAY THE GAME , SUDDENLY : HEY DOESN´T MATTER THE SIZE , I WANT COMMENTS !!! WELL NOT WITH ME , I PASS ."
[V],globeplus,2010-09-30T23:52Z,"JUST ONE LAST THING : SUPPOSE THAT YOU ARE DOWNLOADING 3.2 OR 3.3 GB FOR THIS FILE WITH COMMENTS INCLUDED , THE COMMENTS ARE 7 ALL TOGETHER ON THE FILE AND THE USER WILL USE ONLY ONE , MAYBE YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK ON THE OTHERS BUT YOU WILL BE ONLY USING ONE ANYWAY THEN EACH COMMENT CAN VARIATE BETWEEN 250 AND 300 AND SOMETHING MEGA , SO YOU ARE DOWNLOADING CLOSE 1.5 GB THAT IS ON THE FILE THAT THE USER WILL NEVER USE ."
,vintermac,2010-10-01T00:12Z,"as u can c globeplus,some guys are from some stupid organization who are paid to write such comments about the torrentz and make ppl and uploaders to stop downloading..

so just dont mind them at all..

[V],globeplus,2010-10-01T07:46Z,"Sorry , for my atitude my general nice files users , what happen was the next thing and i am not the kind of the guy that is hiding something from the users as a excuse from the work : i saw yesterday in an hour , close 50 peers abandonated the file and many users after getting the file not helping , it was like the comments was the end of the world and what this guys was saying it was the indiscutible true !!! , but my felow file users , the intention on my files is to do pratical files and the question is if i addicionated the comments i get a 3.3 gb file or close to that and in that 3.3 gb that the user go to download , 1.5 gb or more he will never use for shore or is a high potencial of that , so the analisys is very simple : in a 3.3 gb file to download , 40 or more percent of the download the user will probably never use and this , in a feature like comments that is really not essential to the normal gameplay  , so the intention is to make pratical files , leaving more than 40% of the file with not only non essencial files but also futility files it is the correct work ? it is matter to ask to myself if i am doing praticak files or just simulating that i am doing them , the intention was to put them separetdly available one by one in nice links like i always but in the fifa game of this year that didnÂ´t happen , they are all together in the same file , i reallly made it an effort to separate them but for the moment wasnÂ´t possible and because this inconvenience happen it is a matter for the users simply take a posture like the file is shit and the uploader a morron ? but i ask all the gameplay with all the teams and competitions donÂ´t still available ? it is the end of the world that ? many users out there have their limitations on the internet services and for the originals they know very well possible files to download but the intention on my files is to get more pratical files as possible keeping the gameplay and that was what i did with a correct analysis of the included files for this games , the user in a possible 3.3 gb is correct , 40% of the file he will neve need it ? and i am suppose to call the file a pratical file ? Thank you and sometimes this type of work simply sucks ."
,deepak_rokz,2010-10-01T08:10Z,"And I have never thanked you for all the games that I have used of you. Thank You. All of your games that I have downloaded have worked(including fifa 11). Some took some time but, they worked. So keep em coming Globe

[V],globeplus,2010-10-01T11:26Z,"Thank you for the latest comments but including a 1.8 gb file with 7 commentarys , when the users will be using only 1 of them indepentdly of user is not my concept of a pratical file , for originals everybody knows what is the files anyway , it is because they di bullshit work basically that they feel ok tring to borring my work in anything that is possible to criticize and the true is that sometimes this type of work can sucks like the commentarys files for this fifa 11 game . Thank you for your comments and enjoy your game , still the gameplay with all the teams and all the competitions anyway available in this 1.53 gb file ."
[V],globeplus,2010-10-01T11:29Z,this comment just for saying that the commentarys work for this file is oficial aborted . thank you .

,Guuru5,2010-10-01T15:57Z,"Now you`ve outdone yourself Globe. Why can`t you spend more time creating a more playable game. One that’s easy to install. One where you don`t  have to move files around in folders before you can play. And not least a game with sound.  It looks like everything is about making the game file small. I`ll give you credit for not calling this directplay though. 
Just to be clear, I have not downloaded this. Nor will I. I haven’t downloaded anything of your handicapped work since GTA IV.  Then I got enough. "
[V],globeplus,2010-10-01T17:15Z,"To Guuru5 : it looks like you have a normal tendence for everything be complicated to you specially if youa re already predestinated to be contestating something ... do a correct analyais of the work without beeing criticising already , i do pratical that make sense , what this mean : means that if the game only need an extraction it is that what you get , if the file need a quick or not conversion work it is because it is what make sense to the present work on the game and so on and so on , one thing is for shore , i analise correctly the files on the game before decide what it will be the final work , i am not giving extra ununcessary time to the possible users just because i want , if that happen it is 
because i think that it is the best way to do the work for the present game ."

[V],globeplus,2010-10-02T00:39Z,"Thank you for the latest comments but i have to abort the work in ither languages beside the english language for the commentarys in this game , why ? because i made a wonderful discover :  the original iso have all the commentarys but even on that one the only commentary that is working is the english , god knows why ... i tried a couple of things to have the other languages separatdly too and i didnÂ´t get any success , sorry other possible commentarys languages users but i really made an effort and i find out that even on the original tghis is happening too , so the users of the file have only the possibility to get the english commentarys for this game i suppose ... Thank you for understand this peculiar situation but sometimes uploading files can really be a kind of tough , well english commentarys available and workimg perfect for only 265 mb , not the all 1.8 gb file for the commentarys that is o the original file for having only the english commentarys available inside the game anyway ."

,Jagi555,2010-10-02T07:21Z,"Nice upload, works perfectly.
The english commentary works great as well. I just have one question... 
How can I get all of the crowd sounds back? The game sounds just a bit dull... there's no roar in the crowd when you kick a goal etc."

[V],globeplus,2010-10-04T01:04Z,"To neeraj122 : you need to delete the data6.bh file and copy or overwrite the data6.big to get the improve on the crowd ambience .
To lolo501 : you need to delete the data5.bh and copy or overwrite the data5.big .
RESUMING : data5.big for commentarys , data6.big for crowd ambience both copied and overwriting and for each of the cases the data5.bh and the data6.bh must be deleted from the img folder inside the game folder , so if you apply the commentarys delete the data5.big , if you apply the crowd ambience delete the data6.big , for both delete both also ."

,joco222,2010-10-05T16:42Z,henrythegame1122 & globeplus: Thanks for your message i have in the fifa config my settings for keyboard change! Thank yout very much :D 
,fluster84,2010-10-05T18:42Z,"To make the commentaries and crowd ambience work,

1) Delete the two *.bh files in the /Game/ folder, as globe mentioned 

2) Copy and replace the two *.big files into YOUR GAME INSTALLATION FOLDER, that is the folder where you INSTALLED THE GAME WITH EA SPORTS FIFA 11 INSTALLER. 

It all works perfectly btw if you do this right."

So in my opinion hats off to you globe, and fuck-off users like shroo who are criticiseng his great efforts."
,vishal.1,2010-10-10T11:25Z,thnx a lot.continue ur fantastic works!!!!!
,imahacker22,2010-10-10T13:59Z,hi. When I install fifa 11 it says that it does not find a file. It happens when copying files.
,Jagi555,2010-10-10T15:19Z,"Hey I can confirm crowd ambience works perfectly.

I'm playing manager mode and every single game I play is either a night game or a raining game. I've played a whole season now, with not one dry day game.
Any ideas? just a bit odd that's all. The stadium is Ivy Stadium which has a day feature."
,cattivo20,2010-10-12T18:53Z,"Globe,

Is there a difference between this torrent vs the FIFA 11 RIP by globe? "
,cattivo20,2010-10-12T18:53Z,"Does any one have the same issue as I am experiencing?

When I go to create or edit players, I can not save them. I get an error message stating it can not be saved to ""Squad 1"" and sometimes I do not get the option to save the edit.

Has anyone else come across this? "
,Cr09,2010-10-21T16:01Z,"Hi Globe~~!!!
You are the best ripper in the world don't bother stupid people comments, they do this because they are jealous from your hard work, we all appreciate your work.

,triqvinden,2010-11-04T20:38Z,"It works fine !

but the sound is bugging i think because sometimes you cant hear the crowd then you just hear the ball and the eco from the ball

Sometimes when your sprinting and want to shot with the SPACE it wont react and the goalkeeper takes the ball -_- 

however this WOOORK ! "
,triqvinden,2010-11-04T20:45Z,"Ohh i forgot one thing -_-

i get Re- enter the menu selection using the control device that you wish to adjust

I belive because this is xbox rip"

,dolgila,2010-11-25T11:38Z,"Hi globe. I am wondering. Why is my version of the game has no 'career mode'? or is it that the PC version doesnt have it? Next is the FIFA 11 [atch. during the startup of the game, they asked to download a patch.I did the download but did not install it. will it ruin the whole game if i install the patch?"
,vishal.1,2010-11-26T17:50Z,@dolgila yup the pc version doesnt have the career mode (new) but it does have the tournament option while ur patch problem is that while start up of the game it tries to connect the ea servers if u r connected to internet.i think you r trying to play online mode so it asked to download the latest patch and better dont install the patch(warning) it will stop the game from running or u can download crack patch here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5978795/FIFA_2011_v1.01-FLTDOX
,dolgila,2010-12-02T11:10Z,"Thanks vishal! damn, that means I cant use the cheat found on career mode. hahah! do you guys know of any cheats? I mean, not that I don't like playing normally. It's just for pure entertainment,i guess."
,varun7838,2011-01-22T19:10Z,"dude getting commentary n crowd voice r simple ......just get demo fifa 11 n copy the data05.big,data05.bh,data06.big,data06.bh..files from the demo n replace with the ame files in the original game.......works for me........  :)"
,Unit431,2011-01-27T11:04Z,"Had some problems with extraction. It came up with random corruptions the first time I tried to extract with FreeArc -- tried it a second time and it extracted without problems. Weird. Anyway, the game works perfectly. Thanks.

Also, people have posted working links to the full commentary and crowd files. The demo audio files would most certainly be missing voice overs, so I'd suggest getting the full copies."
,soccerkid5,2011-02-05T18:01Z,It's a great download globe but I have problems loading it now . When I first started to load it it was fine but then when I reached the menu it said : '' Must update game to play '' So I got the patch and now it isn't even loading .
