Alcoholics Anonymous Big Book. - Fourth Edition

The book[2] consists of over 400 pages. The life story of Bill W. remains to be read in its contents. The personal experiences of some alcoholics are detailed as well as the series of solutions which evolved to become the twelve step program. How to use the twelve steps is explained using examples and anecdotes. Some chapters target a specific audience. One chapter is devoted to agnostics, while another is named "To Wives" (the first AA members were only men), and still another is for employers. The second part of the book (whose content varies from edition to edition) is a collection of personal stories, in which alcoholics tell their stories of addiction and recovery.
