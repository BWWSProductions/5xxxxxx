As much as any record, CSN's 1969 debut ushered in the early '70s singer-songwriter boom. Yes, this was a group, but it was one made up of three coequal composer/vocalists, each with a heady resume--Crosby an ex- Byrd, Stills in Buffalo Springfield, and Nash a former member of the Hollies. Each supplied distinctive material and contributed to CSN's trademark harmonies. The addition of Neil Young made the supergroup an edgier outfit. There's a purity to the original trio recording, however, that would never be recaptured. --Steven Stolder

One of the most enduring musical partnerships of our time, Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Crosby, Stills & Nash are revered for their peerless vocal harmonies, inspired songwriting and musical virtuosity. When the trio first sang together at a friend's Laurel Canyon house in 1968, their uncanny harmonic convergence was immediately apparent, and CSN took shape. Each member came to the new venture from other high-profile bands-Crosby from the Byrds, Stills from Buffalo Springfield, and Nash from the Hollies-and together, they formed that rarest of musical entities, a "supergroup" that lived up to its billing. CSN's 1969 self-titled debut album is one of the true masterpieces of the rock 'n' roll canon, and 1982's Daylight Again is a brilliant portrait of their musical evolution. Still touring and recording together, CSN is an American treasure.
