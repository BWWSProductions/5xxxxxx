I uploaded this because it became one of my favorite movie just a few months ago.  It's one of those movies that you don't realize are great until the end.  The video and audio are so-so, but definetely watchable.  I've been wanting a high quality version of this movie, but can't find one anywhere, unfortunately.  Anyways, this has no virus', same as all my torrents-- scanned with ESET 4.  Enjoy!
