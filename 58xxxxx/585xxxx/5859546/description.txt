Whether you're on a Windows PC or a Mac running Windows, sharing files on disks is no longer a hassle.

MacDrive for Windows takes all the guess work out disk accessibility. With MacDrive installed, your Windows computer now speaks Mac and you can access all types of Mac-formatted disks - including external hard drives, CDs, DVDs, iPod and more.

Simplify cross-platform computing
The best part about MacDrive is there is nothing to launch and nothing to learn - simply install and Windows understands Mac disks.

Along with the ability to read and write to Mac disks and volumes, you can also create Mac disks for easy file transfers and backups. The built-in MacDrive Disk Manager gives you the power to partition, format, analyze and repair disks, while the newly revamped CD/DVD Creator allows you to burn Mac CDs and DVDs.

It really is that easy
MacDrive really does help PCs and Macs get along and work together seamlessly. Sharing Mac disks is no longer a challenge. Simply pop in a disk or plug-in a drive and a little red apple will appear giving you full access to disk's contents.

If you work in a cross-platform environment with Macs and PCs you'll kick yourself for not installing MacDrive sooner.
