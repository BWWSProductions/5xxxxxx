The Purpose Of Life Part 1

What is the purpose of life? Why are we here and where are we going? Through the verses of the Holy Quran, Shaykh Khalid Yasin expounds upon the creation of the universe and this amazing world we live in - and how it came to be. With his logical style of argument, the Shaykh answers these questions with much wisdom.

The Purpose Of Life Part 2

A continuation of the first part of The Purpose of Life, Shaykh Khalid Yasin delves into the life of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) and his message, and shows that prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) came with the same message; to worship God, do good in this world and strive for the eternal life hereafter. Alhamdulillah (all praise is due to Allah); twenty-two non-Muslims reverted to Islam on the night of this lecture.
