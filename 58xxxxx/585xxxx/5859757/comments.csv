Yes, it's dupe but...
Search engine didn't find it (for me) b4 I uploaded it.

I suplied 2 snap shots, the other uploader didn't bother to.

Quality:    +0 / -1 (-1) 
You're so childish to rate it down (do you think people give a damn?), you're supposed to vote for quality and nobody downloaded it yet.

Finally I upload this ""dupe, now that we know"" with 5 MB/s, which is surely faster then the other torrent.

Oh..and this is my first ""dupe & by mistake"" not knowing about the existence of the other, this is my first upload not ripped by me, you instead upload other people's rips (many of us know who you are and trolkan is one of your many double accounts).

I will care less if will get deleted, I only did a favour for the community, or just tried to."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-10-01T12:08Z,"In fact I upload with 9 MB/s from 2 servers.

Also this torrent has a sample in case somebody wants to check it first.

Trolkan, if you're so unhappy go ahead and report it to delete it, I really don't care."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-10-02T13:03Z,"I agree, I don't like rars either and the year should have been 2009 (USA      28 October 2009 more exactly) but 2010 for some countries and blue-ray is 2010 release.
I didn't do any change on the torrent just added the trackers and removed the private one. Also copied/pasted the description from the source (my bad) so the original uploader is to be blamed about the incorrect year.
This is my first rared upload and hopefully the last. I am on a very slow internet right now and to dl from server then upload would have taken  1 week till somebody gets the 100% so I uploaded it as it was from the server.
Although I prefer to dl unrared torrents too sometimes I go for the rared ones if they are  much faster (some uploaders here upload much faster then others) (talking about dupes, well maybe 20% of the new releases are more or less dupes. I'm not interested in cat fights, those who read dozens of your comments can conclude who you are. I don't care, it's your business till your account(s) will get deleted....and you shoudn't have such big mouth from your trolkan account, instead leave comments from your pink skull account if you want to be frank."
,JOEGREEK,2011-04-29T11:02Z,thanks - I have been searching for this.will comment on quality when the download finished but I have never been let down by mkvonly -always perfect.
