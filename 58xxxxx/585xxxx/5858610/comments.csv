[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-30T23:55Z,"@ Everyone - It seems that there were a few noises (pops) on the source, so ViSiON decided to make a V2 (Version 2) release.  
The Last Airbender 2010 DVDRip V2 XviD AC3-ViSiON 

Anyways I will encode the V2 or look for something better and the upload it here. 

I watched the source on my PS3, sure there were a few pops, but it really didn't bother me a whole lot, it just startled me a little. Other than the few pops/crackles, it looked and sounded good. (^_^) "
