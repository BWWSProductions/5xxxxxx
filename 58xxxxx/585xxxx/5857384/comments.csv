,Mitala,2010-10-01T00:48Z,thanx softwarez.. donÂ´t bother .. bikemaddog must be born yesterday.. this is not even a rar file. 
,iamcims,2010-10-01T04:53Z,"bikemaddog, you're an idiot.

probably too dumb to figure out how to use .rar

also, this is a un-rar'd release, just the .avi.

ha. stupid ass.

plus, rars are almost always real, fakes can easily be spotted. for example, .wmv files which are a fraction of the right size, the show somehow uploaded before it even airs on tv, etc."
