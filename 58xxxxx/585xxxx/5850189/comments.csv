[V],mrspatula,2010-09-24T22:45Z,It's clean:  http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=7ea175879abf9b99279873ae1e0f50db7f22e341d661caff8f197908b43a2341-1285361089
,Jevin,2010-09-25T08:40Z,"I told people not to use online anti-virus scan,
because it almost ALWAYS says there is malware.

Use your standard anti-virus and you will find a clean file."

Can I get a better view ?"
,lifesoul,2010-09-27T15:47Z,It works but only activates it for a period of 180 days. Then you have to activate it again. Even my anti virus which is Microsoft essential promted that its a keygen I allowed it to continue and it activated office.
,Cavemann,2010-09-27T22:35Z,"Thanks, this worked for me. Time will tell if it is permanent, but I don't see why not."
,myconcern,2010-10-02T00:38Z,"Works it's a 180 day activation, but it has auto reactivation. You have to do it once and never again."
,Hawaii501,2010-10-04T10:52Z,Doesn't work for me.  Keep getting an error and it asks me if I want to try again.  Keep clicking yes time after time but still get the error.  Don't know what I'm doing wrong.
,Ithex,2010-10-10T21:23Z,THIS WORKS!! If you do it right
,BramBarb,2010-10-26T13:51Z,"I have tried every one of the activation things even the one that says we can only do this one month activation 4 times. I did the last one about a month ago and it activated it for only one month, but when I tried it again I only get some kind of error code. My activation has expired, is that the cause?
The other ones simply have never worked."
,kaniga,2010-10-28T09:05Z,"First I had some errors reported when trying to crack, but after going around through all the options, it worked like a charm (even though it was still reported errors).

Yair."
,MrTTAO,2010-10-28T19:01Z,"hilariously a lot of anti virus programs detect this as ""keygen"" or ""activator""... apparently working cracks are now ""malware"""
,bonemalone,2010-11-01T02:05Z,"GREAT! This one worked, thanks guys!

I had to re-arm the office products first, but after that it worked. Don't know if its gonna last for 30 days, 180 days or forever, but for now I'm happy. :)"
,volvobm430,2010-12-06T11:31Z,This one works!
,colombianwiz,2010-12-31T01:48Z,"Sophos antivirus says ""Troj/Keygen-DX""

Why ""Troj""
"
,djbillyd,2011-05-13T14:30Z,"NONE of the features of this thing works. They all give a ""Cannot Launch"" error. EVERY one the features returns that error."
,43Bojan,2011-05-31T21:06Z,"
As soon as I got the ""licence is not valid"" message in Outlook 2010 I downloaded this tool and it did the trick: product activated
Both the VL as the 180 days licence could be used with success. "
,sparky01gt,2011-06-13T01:34Z,This worked fine for me and Avast found no virus.
,tamiyx,2011-08-28T13:36Z,"10000000 thanks, youre greath !!!!!!!"
,chickenblade,2011-09-12T19:51Z, worked fine for me. it was made by razzor. its not a virus or malware. its just a crack like device. 
,surewasnt,2011-12-08T19:41Z,"This one works like a charm, gotta love Razor.

I got a bit nervous after getting the 30 days left poo-poo message, a couple of clicks later no more popups. V nice."
