,vivatpb5776,2010-10-09T13:37Z,TVRip but good quality nonetheless. Full screen not wide screen.
,Felicia182,2010-11-26T08:23Z,Seed please!! Thanks!
,BryceHaZEN,2010-11-27T07:01Z,its not all from season 2. should of said something needle dick
,Felicia182,2010-12-02T09:20Z,"Hey thanks for the upload! I hate the guy, but the clips are great! Cheers!"
,WarpWar,2011-01-23T04:48Z,Actually these are wide screen (16:9) but they aren't encoded properly (they are set to 4:3). You have to manually set it to display in 16:9 or the videos look a little squashed. I use GOM Player but others can change the aspect ratio I think.
,Hrvat89,2011-01-26T02:21Z,THX

,Brenry,2011-06-02T20:38Z,"...

Your comment on episode 19 about ""dedicated to the late Bill Cosby"" .... Bill Cosby is still alive."
,Basnagus,2011-08-10T04:39Z,"All eps work great .. good quality. 
and for that we thank you chad126"
,marduk191,2011-09-15T14:06Z,"Encoded wrong, you can switch aspect ratio to 16:9 in the player to fix that, no big deal. Some eps are interlaced wrong and you have to reinterlace then causing you to have to correct the audio delay. Not horribly bad if you use mpchc to play them I guess, lots of work though. Should probably just grab the one with 1,2,and 3 all together and try it if you are starting from scratch on the collection,maybe the files are in better shape."
,hitnrun4fun,2011-10-14T02:31Z,are these censored? dont really care about the video blur but un-bleeped would be a peach!
,ilovemycomputer,2011-11-17T22:57Z,"thanks, excellent quality.

I was reading through the comments really quick, gotta answer the stupid people.
first, its on PUBLIC TV. YES, it's going to be censored. unless youve got a buddy in the crowd camming it up, its censored, stupid.

these are all hd quality or as close as you can get.
If you have an ounce of humor you will like daniel tosh (at least 95% of his episodes; some of them are grosse).
When you're done downloading it, watch these and give chad a + or a -. don't be lazy. 80 seeds and only 8 people gave it a +? you suck dudes. lol"
,DumbLuck,2011-12-28T02:17Z,Thanks for the work you put into this!
,xpmule,2012-06-13T08:58Z,"@ilovemycomputer

your an idiot .
these are mixed quality, the ones close to 175mb are mostly ok but the over sized ones are a bloody mess of odd winky dimensions, quality, encode settings with a crappy codec (not xvid like the other 175mb ones)
not to mention the random un needed ugly black strips unevenly in the videos plus the cranky messed up aspect ratio
and sometimes visible scan lines to go along with the poor video quality..

im not gonna get into the audio lol

only 8+ ratings ?
Yeah cause buddy doesn't deserve any more than that lol

Reviews or should i say descriptions can be found at imdb or wikipedia..

""These are HD quality""
LOL yeah right uhhhhmm what part would be considered HD ????

And you need a buddy with a cam corder for uncensored footage ?
Again WTF are you that dense ?
I guess you have never seen a torrent of tv shows ruipped from a dvd

WOW
more TPB mouthy crap from morons that know nothing about what they are talking about.. Classic TPB"
