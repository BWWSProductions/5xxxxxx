Working with a team of experienced practitioners in EFT and a group of volunteer PTSD-diagnosed vets from Vietnam to the present Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, this historic film records the therapy and follow-up of those individuals who were documented undergoing treatment as well as the hundreds of other volunteer veterans who participated in a national research and testing.

This Special Edition movie has a 44 minute interview with Gary Craig, the founder of EFT.

THANKS to All the Vets that make our Freedom something we can take for Granted !!!
