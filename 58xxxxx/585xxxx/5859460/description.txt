This is the MAC OS X VMWare Image 10.6.3 upgraded to the 10.6.4 operating system. Directions are in the torrent and when selecting a CD/DVD Drive, you must select darwinboot.iso to start image!

I tried to get the whole thing into English but had issues. You can always change the language settings in the Mac Settings!

Please seed for long time!
Enjoy.
