,Jehrahl,2010-10-02T14:48Z,"Can you upload Aliens SE, please...?"
,jedenpies,2010-10-02T20:23Z,"it's extended cut or some special edition i think.
i know the dvd version by heart and after watching just first few minutes i've seen some scenes new to me. thanks a lot"
,jedenpies,2010-10-02T20:26Z,"well, i know by heart the dvd version i have :)"
,DILLINJAY,2010-10-07T17:13Z,"i believe the extended edition of this one is called 'The Restored Workprint Edition'

Fincher will never revisit the nightmare he had making this to do an authorised new director's version."
[V],-jonny-,2010-10-11T21:55Z,This is the special edition.
