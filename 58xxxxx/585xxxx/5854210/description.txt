With the threats of both the Replicators and the Goa'uld greatly diminished and 

the sister ship to the Prometheus, the Deadalus, now under construction, SG-1 is 

anxious to get a ride on the new ship. However, the mood is somewhat darkened by a 

phone call informing Dr. Jackson of Catherine Langford's death. After the funeral, 

Catherine's niece gives Daniel "a few odds and ends" that her aunt wanted him to 

have. Upon delivery it is discovered that almost her entire collection was shipped 

to Daniel's lab. He finds in one of her books a possible location of a ZPM, but 

scans of the area showed that it was no longer there. Daniel proposes that they 

use the Ancient time machine to take it from Ra at Giza in 3000 BC.
