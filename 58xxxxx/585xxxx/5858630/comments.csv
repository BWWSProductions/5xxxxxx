,theRealKarmine,2010-11-15T01:07Z,"hope this isnt the same buggy shit ive downloaded from all the other people.  im sure this is missing all the music (hence the size).....and all the menus are fucked up making this unplayable.

,SirSangi,2011-09-06T15:35Z,"How is this ""full game"" when all the fucking radio stations are missing?

Could you please not use fucking misleading titles like this in the future?"
,namtolng,2011-09-10T02:04Z,SirSangi could you please look at file sizes in the future?
,WalterLloyd,2011-11-04T12:02Z,"Don't fucking call this a full game if it's not.

How dare you fuck with this game, taking shit out. One of the great things about the GTA series is the music.

Fuck this torrent. -1"
,arandomguy452,2012-02-17T22:21Z,"is there a way to put the radio stations into the game? this torrent sounds great and all, but i would like to have the radio stations."
,d0cput,2012-03-03T15:05Z,thx walter ... *cancelled download *looking for another REAL
,danrman,2012-04-03T23:21Z,"The people complaining about it not having the soundtrack are faggots. There are two reasons it not having the radio stations.
1. Smaller size.
2. Its not very easy to find an ISO for GTA III."
