A well done album from a modern poet, â€œWishbonesâ€ is the type of CD that fans of Lyle Lovett, Robert Earl Keen, Mary Chapin Carpenter and other Texas music artists, can enjoy. Itâ€™s not a groundbreaking record by any means but one definitely worth owning for each song has a compelling story to tell.
