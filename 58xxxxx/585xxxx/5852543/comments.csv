,deathtrooper30,2010-09-25T21:27Z,"Will update with any further releases from h4x0r. 

Never pay 4 a trainer!"
,Cheezebugga,2010-09-25T21:32Z,seed? im at 0.00%
,Kronical4,2010-09-25T22:41Z,stuck at o% this is a dead torrent
,Kronical4,2010-09-25T22:46Z,"Ok finally got it downloaded, its legit."
,DoodleBop,2010-09-26T05:05Z,"Doesn't work with skidrow crack.
The trainer identifies the game, but nothing happens during the game when i push the numpad buttons even though i hear the voice (activated). And yes i'm not dumb, i run it as administrator."
,deathtrooper30,2010-09-26T13:47Z,Sometimes you have to leave the area that ur in for it to take effect or try using the pause feature. 
,iKitty,2010-09-26T14:04Z,"Hey deathtrooper, can you explain why your file contains MULDROP.Trojan? I scanned the file and looked up the virus and it says its malicious and can infect your PC and cause several problems, including having your PC Hijacked?"
,iKitty,2010-09-26T14:25Z,"Weirdd my comment doesn't show for me. but ya, can you explain what it is deathtrooper? I think it's a bit risky to try the trainer without knowing what the ""virus"" does"
,OmniC0Rp,2010-09-26T14:32Z,"Yes... sometimes you have to either switch area, or pause the game"
,iKitty,2010-09-26T14:36Z,"nevermind, I went to the original file location and it's clean. its just a false detection"
,krimik,2010-09-26T16:02Z,"The trainer seems to be working perfectly for me. I'm using Windows 7 32 bit. Did you press insert to activate the trainer before trying to use the features? Also I put the file in the game directory, doubt that causes any problems though."
,deathtrooper30,2010-09-26T18:42Z,"I have an updated version that has 15 features including a new one that instantly kills all zombies on screen. It's fun to use when trying to get somewhere or just exploring, but the game is ultimately about killing zombies right!? 

I can't edit this torrent so if I put it up it will have to be a new torrent!"
,Hampedamp,2010-09-30T14:04Z,"3sec download (Y) and it work perfect, just put it in game directory and start it, and then start the game ! press Insert to start the trainer. then read on the Trainer what you want :) "
,ghostXC,2010-10-22T01:38Z,"Works fine with Skidrow's game, if you get performance issues just tab out back to the trainer after you input the cheats and exit the trainer. All cheats will still be active in the game."
,grbavac,2010-10-22T23:14Z,Do you have trainer to ArcaniA: Gothic 4?
,TheGaMingPie,2010-11-03T17:33Z,my game closes when i press input and the cheats plz help i dont know what version i have!
,PinkFrostedCupcake,2010-12-28T08:15Z,"it works 100%, cheers mate"
