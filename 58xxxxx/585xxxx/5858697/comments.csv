,xiphone,2010-10-02T08:57Z,Could you do chuck from season 1 please?????
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-10-02T16:52Z,"@ everyone - At the time of writing this I am moving out of the my Mom's house and am having to look for another place to live. My mom told me that she would pay my rent and car insurance for a month or so, and after that I am on my own. At my Mom's, I did not have to pay for anything but gas for my car and my seedbox. I am also going to have to find a job, cuz I do not have 1. I am sorry to tell you this but I am sure that I will not have internet for a few weeks, so I will probably not be able to upload anything for a month or so, maybe less if I get a job very soon like next week. But as soon as I get feel for things and know where I stand, I will let you guys know. I will the my seedbox seeding my torrents and that we be for a month, cuz I already payed the bill for that.

I really hope that I can return very soon and upload in the near future."

[T],The_Day_Walker,2011-02-18T19:55Z,"Hey guys and gals! Thanks soooooooo much for seeding my stuff for me while i'm gone! I hope to be back in 4-6 weeks. I know i will be starting to upload stuff slowly. I will be seeding stuff from a zombie computer instead of a seedbox.  Anyway, I can't wait! In the meantime check out this person's stuff, takes requests -  http://thepiratebay.org/user/Evol_Gamer_428/ 

And try a few other people's stuff out, cuz we all started somewhere, we didn't start off as trusted, we had to work our way there so give these people a chance to be your trusted source for handheld encodes.
Also, I recently got a used iPod Touch 4G for $20 from a friend, i cleaned it myself (meaning it was hot), so now i can test stuff on the iPod Touch 4G before i upload it. "
,newkastle,2011-02-20T06:00Z,Did you get the job?? Waiting for your come back man..
[T],qwersd,2011-02-23T18:39Z,"Gr8 to hear that u r coming back TDW..;) with OOO stopping uploads, it's the perfect time for your comeback... look forward to your awesome stuff:)"
[T],The_Day_Walker,2011-02-26T21:29Z,"I'm gonna trade my iPod Touch for a 8000k HID Light kit, LED license plate lights,  Reverse/back up LED lights, and the installation of all that for my car. Don't worry i will get another iPod Touch for $50. 

No, i didn't get a job...officially. lol. I do various odd jobs, do several illegal things, and i have an off the books part-time job. 

I'm doing fine, other than this girl i was dating cheating on me twice when she was high and drunk, having to have surgery that insurance will pay for, getting into a car accident, but it will get repaired early next week. My mom and i are cool now. Enough about me."
,banukaknight,2011-02-28T14:37Z,u gonna be back soon enough boss?
[T],The_Day_Walker,2011-03-06T19:40Z,"The buddy that i'm trading the iPod Touch to is also gonna throw in 2 Blue LED strips to put in my trunk, since he couldn't install the stuff before my car went into the shop. I promise I will be back soon. "
[T],qwersd,2011-03-12T14:44Z,"@TDW hope u didn't get hurt too bad in the accident....
i would do practically anything for an iTouch for 50 bucks...;)"
[T],The_Day_Walker,2011-03-15T01:27Z,"Right now i'm encoding Daniel Tosh Happy Thoughts, Human Target S01, Lip Service S01, and some other things.  I will try to upload a couple of torrents this week."
