,dearghoul,2010-10-03T05:54Z,I see every single dexter s5e1 has zero seeds and leechers. The older seasons are all fine. Anybody else seeing the same. That is very weird. I know showtime is really headhunting people downloading dexter in general. My neighbor got our landlady a threatening letter from her isp because of DLing dexter. But I can't think how they could do anything like what I'm seeing. Weird indeed...
,dearghoul,2010-10-03T06:03Z,And thanks 2040! I like the lovecraft quote.
