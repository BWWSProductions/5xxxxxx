,coleix,2010-09-30T04:50Z,"the problem right now is that openbitorrent is down because they can't handle the load, and because open went down everybody tried using publicbt so publicbt couldn't handle the extra load either. We got to depend on DHT right now until they upgrade the servers and what not."
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-09-30T23:43Z,"@coleix

,i6789,2010-12-30T10:52Z,i have installed express edition will this work after i uninstall...any 1 tried??
,Talley123,2011-01-02T00:16Z,"i6789 you need to install express edition first.
MS  will think that you are using VS 2008 Trial.
By the way you should try VS 2010 it is the best out there."
,Talley123,2011-01-02T00:17Z,Sorry i6789 i mean you need to uninstall express first.

Thnx in advance."
,tehnores,2011-12-18T21:00Z,"Just a heads-up: if you're a highschool/college student in the US, Microsoft will give you a free, licensed copy of VS2008 and many other expensive dev tools. Visit Microsoft DreamSpark at dreamspark.com to learn more.

I would've used DreamSpark, but my school has been very lazy in creating student e-mail addresses, so I don't have one for DreamSpark to verify :/"
