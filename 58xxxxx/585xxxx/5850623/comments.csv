,dothackjhe,2010-09-25T06:52Z,Does this game work? People are usually having problems with PC games that came from steam. .
,lievenazerty,2010-09-25T12:39Z,@dothackjhe don't worry it works fine on my pc (win 7) 
,lievenazerty,2010-09-25T13:11Z,"it only works for the first lvl then you have to purchase the rest of the game. the steam_api.dll should be cracked as well to make it work completely just wait
 a few days for the reloaded crack then it'll work"
,lonewolf1994,2010-09-26T11:13Z,"wtf is this?? this isnt even cracked! after i download it and install, it just opens up steam for me to download the demo :l

did u even try this?"
,stack111,2010-09-27T06:02Z,you need to log out of steam and then run it and if it only runs as the demo you need to run it as admin thats how i got mine to work
,lonewolf1994,2010-09-27T08:24Z,"i tried it. i quit steam, went on blade kitten, pressed right click and run as administrator. all it does is reopen steam and starts downloading the demo.. is there a file or something that i need to place??"
,stack111,2010-09-30T06:23Z,did you copy the stuff in the tiny iso folder that it comes with? if not copy that and replace it with the items in the blade kitten folder if you already did try it again 
,sananji,2010-09-30T16:13Z,"Burn/mount, install, copy content from TiNYiSO folder, then play.
itÂ´s not that dificult. you guys should read the information from the upload before installing."
,mugetsu,2010-10-02T00:54Z,Is this just the demo version? 
,whatwhat16,2010-10-02T18:29Z,"This crack doesn't work sadly.

Copied the stuff from the TiNYiSO folder into the main game's folder, ran with admin, still functions as demo."
,SleepyJake,2010-10-02T20:12Z,"Hey, Everyone. This does infact work.

Get a program like PowerISO, and when you have all the files, open the Blade.Kitten-TiNYiSO folder. You should have Winrar (If not go get it, the trial DOES NOT run out, It'll just warn you it's out and ask you to buy, but still let you use it.) Now, once the folder is open, scroll all the way down until you see a .rar near an icon that looks like a computer monitor, extract those two files into the Blade Kitten folder.

Next, mount the .Cue image file using PowerISO's UI, not the right click drop down menu in the side bar, the actual Ui for it. You should get several files, such as setup.exe, and the TiNYiSO folder, Extract the Folder to wherever you can remeber, and then launch seup.exe.

After the game has installed, find it in C:/program filer/Atari/ Blade Kitten, and add all the files that are in the tinyiso folder, if youre asked to replace something, just do it. 

This got me past the demo cut put in place, if it doesn't work for you, then I'm very sorry."
,whatwhat16,2010-10-02T21:37Z,"Thank you SleepyJake!

Your instructions work perfectly for me.

Follow them to the letter, the game is unlocked fully."
,93keja,2010-10-04T19:46Z,"The torrent works perfectly!
But when I start the game my keyboard stops working.
Anybody have the same proplem?
Plz help"
,arstic,2010-10-04T23:12Z,"Game isn't cracked.  Win7, x64.

Only allows the demo level, doesn't save, etc."
,SleepyJake,2010-10-06T22:37Z,"@arstic

Follow my instructions, if you didn't already.

I can run it fine on Win7 32bit"
,arstic,2010-10-07T15:06Z,"Considering your instructions have nothing special what so ever to them and are simply a poorly written expansion of ""mount, install, move,"" something I've tried more than once, I'll just continue to dismiss this release as uncracked."
,lonewolf1994,2010-10-08T15:38Z,"thank you sleepyjack, it worked thanks to you ^_^"
,Mashero,2010-10-09T17:42Z,"I managed to make the game run on my Win7 computer. The problem I have is that when you click on New Game the cut scene plays out but when it's time for me to move around the keyboard won't work. The mouse works fine, but I cant move, go to the menu, anything so I am forced to Alt+F4 out of the game. Is there a fix for this?"
,Omocho,2010-10-13T08:09Z,"@arstic
Might as well change your name to autistic.

The simple instructions were all that was needed.
Not hard at all to know that you need to mount and install the game, then place the tinyiso folder contents into the Blade Kitten folder (there is only one other, obviously wrong, folder within that folder). Then derp, it works. So you're just a moron.

Thanks for the upload. Works great. This game is awesome."

""burn/mount, install, move"" practically doesn't need to be said. 

Adding a metric asston of broken english to ""mount, install, move"" doesn't change the fact the game isn't cracked.  It may work on your particular OS (likely some ancient cracked copy of winxp) but it doesn't work on any x64 OS and thus, is still in need of a proper crack.

Not cracked.  Demo only.  Doesn't save.  Waste of a torrent, waste of a download.  Half convinced everyone who claims it is cracked couldn't faceroll through the demo level."
,T_A_B,2010-10-20T11:43Z,Confirmed Win7 x64 = access to first level only.
,donward,2010-10-31T08:20Z,Didnt work for me on Win 7 x64 (will try with Vista x64)
,DarkLaunch357,2010-12-17T00:47Z,"uh I just saw this game on da AMD Catalyst driver installer, chicks like the one in this game make me somewhat horny brb downloading"
,nootjeh,2010-12-22T12:06Z,"everytime i click on the ""Bladekitten"" application i immediately get this http://bayimg.com/DabIkAAdJ
HOW DO I FIX THIS?"
,Louis-Thau,2010-12-31T16:51Z,"This thing is just a demo...
In short : this torrent suck for most people

However, this game cost only 3,99âŹ on Steam right now so I bought it... I strongly advise you do the same !

Regards."
,shrek15001,2011-01-20T18:05Z,the crack that came with this torrent was made for x64 systems only we need a x32 crack for windows xp and stuff
,shrek15001,2011-01-20T18:42Z,"ok after spending a bit with the game i have matched up the MB from the demo with this torrent and this torrent is nothing but a demo the real game size i imagine would be 4GB or so not 714MB

i believe this was nothing more then a fools joke trying to make them self's look good anyone can download this demo from steam for free the actual game cost $10.00 from steam do not download this torrent its a waist of time wait till someone uploads a full version of it you well see the difference in size"
,Iscariah-,2011-03-15T18:32Z,Crack works perfectly here on my Win7x64...
,mcon1964,2011-03-18T17:18Z,"I have windows 7 64bit. To those who say that
this is the full game, please explain step by
step how you did it. All I get is the demo version."
,Cerberus_NZ,2011-08-27T07:01Z,"Just wasted a number of days and a chunk of data downloading this, as went to extract the rar files and had 10 crc fails in the .bin file... what a waste"
