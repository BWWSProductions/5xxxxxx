,LittleFang,2010-09-28T15:06Z,"LOL (@ 2040's comment above).

Just wanted to say thanks for this - for all your uploads. You have the best taste in shows and I'm really looking forward to seeing this movie. It's also extremely cool that you put up a sample in files like these so that people can decide for themselves if they want to download the whole cam.. thank you."

[V],twentyforty,2010-09-29T09:32Z,"@D-zod: That's rubbish. It is A5/V5 - exactly what CAM are for.
Audio is better than any other CAM of The Town. Unless one loves constant ""peeeeeeeeep"" noise."
