Plot

Hosted by Dave Hughes and Charlie Pickering and produced by Rove McManus
genuine (ie, free of the slimy and the slick, the ersatz, the bogus, the hype)
national and international news and current affairs presented by people more
engaged in what's going on in the world than gazing at their own navels
The team is completed by Carrie Bickmore, James Mathison and Ruby Rose
