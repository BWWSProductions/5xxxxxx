In 1982 a vicious killer tore through the grounds, and students, of Crippen High School. Five years later, a film crew return to the abandoned halls in an attempt capture a recreation of those gruesome events. When the sleazy producer insists on casting ex-students and staff of the star-crossed school that survived the original ordeal, the remake becomes all too realistic. With cast and crew members mysteriously vanishing from the school grounds, it is up to original slasher spree survivor Steven and his co-ed counterpart Callie to untangle the mystery without getting dismembered themselves.
