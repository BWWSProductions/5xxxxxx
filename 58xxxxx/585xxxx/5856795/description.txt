"He's Dead, She's Dead"

When a famous psychic is murdered, Beckett and 
Castle search for her killer while also 
carrying on a spirited debate on the existence 
of extrasensory abilities. Evidence mounts on 
both sides, especially when a letter arrives 
from the victim, penned the day she was killed 
and predicting her own death -- or was it 
written by a clever killer, hoping to throw 
off the investigation?

Enjoy :)
