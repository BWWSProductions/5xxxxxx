,Torx8,2010-09-27T22:44Z,"He is a ""Trusted"" member as you can see with the purple skeleton by his name, which means 99.99% of everything he uploads are real (not fake) and working.
If something that is uploaded is corrupt or otherwise faulty, it should be considered that the release group have done something wrong, not the uploader.

Thank you again NLUpper002"
,imnangler,2010-10-06T00:55Z,This works and looks very good. I have a question: How do you get the DTS to work with the PS3 Media Server? I have digital sound but can't get DTS on. Thanks in advance.

,VelociLord,2010-10-15T02:53Z,"Are these subs hard-coded? If not, how do I play it without them on the PS3. I know how to disable them via VLC, but I copied it to my PS3 HDD with PSM. Any suggestions?"
