Taking on the Unions (9pm Saturday on Fox News Channel)

My new Fox News Special â€œThe Battle for the Futureâ€ airs Saturday at 9 EST, and Sunday at 8 and 11pm.

One of the biggest battles is over what one guest calls, parasites who will bankrupt America.  Heâ€™s talking about public sector unions. Their pay and benefits have risen astronomically, and you get to pay the bill.

But NY Transit Union boss, John Samuelsen argues, we are the richest country in the world and can afford it.  Really?

Here are some of the facts;

Public pensions have unfunded liability of $1 trillion to $3.5 trillion

Federal workers take home twice pay and benefits as private workers. Local and state workers also make more.

Total          Pay           Benefits

Private                 $59,909      $50,028         $9,881

Local/state        $67,812      $52,051        $15,761

Federal               $119,982     $79,197        $40,785

-- Average TWU union worker makes $60K without overtime or benefits.

-- 25% took 15 or more sick days.  Average was 8 sick days.

-- Fox average 3 sick days (same for men and women)

-- No FOX employee took 15 days

Relative Danger of Jobs (Deaths per 100,000 workers)

-- Fishing      128.9

--Logging     115.7

--Iron workers  46.4

--Farmers       39.5

--Firemen   3.8

--Transit workers 1.4

Some people argue that thereâ€™s no alternative to the government monopoly on municipal work, but Sandy Springs, Georgia, privatized most of itâ€™s jobs in 2005.  Now the city pays about Â½ of what it used to pay.  It enjoys a $14 million surplus, in addition to funding a $20 million reserve.
