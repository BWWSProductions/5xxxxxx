I used it to convert my Blu-RAY Star Wars set to regular DVD to have just in case and the movies look outstanding.  My disc are DVD5 and only support up to 2 hours of vid but the program was able to get it all to fit onto one disc with a menu, subtitle options, and multiple audio channel support so I highly recommend it."
