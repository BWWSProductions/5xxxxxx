have you heard about the new law congress wants to pass Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA) was introduced last week, and there will be a hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee this Thursday.

This is the kind of heavy-handed censorship you'd expect from a dictatorship, where one man can decide what web sites you're not allowed to visit

pleaseOplease take the time to sign the petetion and help torrenting stay alive

[V],mirrormaster82,2010-09-30T14:27Z,"Yep,everything that imbackagain0101 says is true,but I doubt that petition will stop this retarded law from being made.The worst news here is that this law is obviosly tackling non U.S. torrent sites such as thepiratebay,but I don`t` know exactly what is wrong with tpb since other torrent sites are functioning properly as of today... "
[V],sonilem,2010-09-30T14:34Z,"You NEED to look up the word Spam. Coz it does NOT mean leaving comments on other peoples torrents. It is Maps Spelt backwards to spell spam. Meaning a map to somwhere else. Maps, meaning a route between one place and another, a link. Hope you get it know, instead of calling people you dont even know a dumbass. But i guess that says more about the people that call other people rather than the prson your calling. Have a nice day."
,sniderjinx,2010-09-30T14:41Z,"Fooled me, I thought spam came in a tin"
