,vincentdesrd,2010-10-03T08:40Z,"Fantastic 720p quality. Very good 5.1 sound. Torrent Was a bit slow(half speed due to traker.thepiratebay.org refusing connection, whetever the helle that means!)

Overall I must say this show is brillant! Not only is it funny but it shows the ""bad"" side of living in those country with great humour from the master Karl Pilkington, but at the same time abuses him to the point where we feel he's gonna have a nourvous break down!!!

But to be completely honest I went through Dehli and hostels there are, believe or not, much cleaner and comfy that that shit hole Steve Merchant hooked him up towards the end of the show!!!

Anyway great upload and is it possible to get a 1080p source of that show or do TV channels still only output in 720p?"

Maybe there'll be 1080p if there are blurays, but it might not be filmed in a high enough res, so it might just be upscales."
