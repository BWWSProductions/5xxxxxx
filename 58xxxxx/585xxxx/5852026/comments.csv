,Karolingiska,2010-09-25T17:18Z,"Does the ~640Kbps audio make it unwatchable in some way? (Like out of sync, bad sound etc.) "
,Robin9876,2010-09-25T17:21Z,"Bone, what do you mean? Is that audio crap or something?"
,ili2882,2010-09-25T18:35Z,"no the audio is too good :)
usually the max bitrate for audio is 480 kbps for 5 chnl. but iMBT encoded it with 640kbps. There will be a proper soon. but if U can't wait this is an good rip. I would have preferred for those bits to go in video but..."
