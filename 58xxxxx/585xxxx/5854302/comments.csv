,digimike50,2010-09-26T22:45Z,"Thanks! Even though you are a long way from home, you still manage to help us fans who can't see the race, otherwise! Can wait for the Forum. Thanks, M8 - from an Englishman abroad!"

,danjoe,2010-09-27T08:10Z,"Thanx TDMK1!
3hours at 1.2 GiB is fair enough and format is too.
For my archive i'm looking for 1.2-1.4 gib file size per race.
You did a good job, but for the race itself i'm sorry for button...
Thanx again!"
,ablamboo,2010-09-27T08:44Z,"TDMK1, you're the best! If it wasn't for you, I'd have to endure the dreadful F1 coverage in the US which is broadcast on a second-rate cable channel with third-rate commentators and commercials every three seconds instead of the professional job done by the beeb ! Thank you so much!"
