2010 The Burn Comes Down    CD  Rif Mountain  RM-003CD 

Following on from their acclaimed debut, A Garland Of Song, folk revivalists The Owl Service return with a proposed run of four releases (under the banner of The Pattern Beneath The Plough) spread across the year. The first of these is the nine-song CD, The Burn Comes Down, which sequences new arrangements of traditional songs themed around winter. The recordings were made during short sessions after The View From A Hill (the forthcoming second release in the series, and a full-length album) was completed. Featuring the seven-strong Owl Service line-up and guest contributors (including Current 93's Joolie Wood) this half-hour EP tackles very faithful acappella renditions ('January Snows' and 'The Bitter Withy') as well as more modernised, electrified pieces ('Cold & Raw'), culminating in the beautifully ornate, slightly psychedelic folk-rock configuration of 'Winter (A Dirge)' based on Robert Burns' words.
