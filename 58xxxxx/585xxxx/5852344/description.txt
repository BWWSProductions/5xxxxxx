This edition is fully Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 compatible. LAN/VPN/Online works great. 

It contains the Campaigns, the secret ANTs Missions and all expansion packs as "Counterstrike" and "The Aftermath", so all multiplayer maps for online or skirmish play has been added too. To get variety the most popular online custom maps have been added into installation files.

It includes the whole Red Alert 1 soundtracks for your gameplay, of course. 
No CD or DVD required to play!
