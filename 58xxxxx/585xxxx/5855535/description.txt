Bill Nye - The Eyes of Nye Science Program (2005/XVID)

The Eyes of Nye, by Bill Nye the Science Guy.


I didn't see this on Demonoid, so I thought I would upload it. I'm not going to put any effort into some elaborate description, but if you enjoyed the educational show, Bill Nye the Science Guy, you might enjoy this.

Quote:
The Eyes of Nye is a science program airing on public television in the United States in 2005 and featuring Bill Nye. The show was more sophisticated than its predecessor Bill Nye the Science Guy, as it was aimed more toward adults and teenagers than children. All episodes were rated TV-G, except for "Addiction" and "The Evolution of Sex", both rated TV-PG. The creation of the show was motivated by the success of the television program Bill Nye the Science Guy, as well as a widespread contempt among scientists for scientific journalism in the media. The program was based in Seattle and broadcast during primetime by KCTS, the local PBS affiliate.


A sample MediaInfo of one of the videos is below. If you want the diagnostics on each of the 13 episodes, I posted them here.
