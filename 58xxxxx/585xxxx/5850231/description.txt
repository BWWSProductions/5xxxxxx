    There's trouble in Frankie Diomede's criminal empire in Genoa. A         
    French gangster has moved into Frankie's territory, so Frankie flies     
    home to take care of business. He promptly has himself arrested so       
    that he'll have the perfect alibi when his top local associate dies,     
    but then Frankie's life gets complicated: his enemies have enough        
    juice to keep him in prison for awhile, his associates and allies are    
    killed one at a time, and attempts on his life start. Help comes from    
    an unlikely source: Tony Breda, a wannabe wiseguy who's a Milanese       
    raised in Hoboken. Tony designs a plan to spring Frankie from jail,      
    and then all roads lead to Marseilles. Is Tony a future Mafia don?
