True Caribbean Pirates

Long ago scores of real pirates plied their brutal trade in the temperate waters of the Caribbean Ocean. In the 1600s and 1700s, Captain Henry Morgan, Blackbeard, Calico Jack Rackham, Ann Bonny, Mary Read, and Black Bart were among the infamous pirates whose crews lied in wait to violently raid the merchant ships of various nations. The true stories of who they were, how they operated, and their various successes and failures in this dark and deadly profession, go far beyond popular legend. THE HISTORY CHANNEL, using CGI animations, expert interviews, as well as archival imagery, explores the real-life stories behind piracy's Golden Age and the dramatic maritime exploits of the TRUE CARRIBEAN PIRATES
