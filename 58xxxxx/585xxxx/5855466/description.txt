Mike Fuentes, Drummer of Pierce the Veil, Isles and Glaciers, has a rap project on the side: MikeyWhiskeyHands!

These are the 6 songs from his Myspace. Ripped personally by yours truly. They were ripped at 320kbps, but Myspace doesn't stream music at that high quality  so im guessing its really 192-256. Either way, its the highest, (and only available) quality out there.

Enjoy.
