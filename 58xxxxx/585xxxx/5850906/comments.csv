,screemofreek,2011-02-16T21:36Z,i will seed when it is done downloading ...thanks for the upload Mork and to all those who bitch about downloading things illegally and get it all for free but still find the time to bitch about how bad the quality is or the names of the movie/songs aren't right...if you all don't like it then don't download it and go out and buy the real thing..other wise shut the fuck up if you are only gunna bitch about the torrent i;m tired of reading comments of people that think that wvery thing should be perfect and in the best quality...do you think pirates in the 1600 had shiny guns and swords and ships..no they had shitty equipment and ships in terrible condition  and you dont read about them complaining now do yah....so once again...if you got nothing nice to say....don't be afraid to SHUT THE FUCK UP AND STOP YOUR GOD DAMN BITCHING!!!!!!!!
