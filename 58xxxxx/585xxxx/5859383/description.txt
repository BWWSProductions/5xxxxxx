A Jefferson Electric Company Gaseous Tube Transformer is put to use to create a Jacob's Ladder.   With 115 VAC input, it outputs 10 KV which can arc across small air gaps. The attached electrodes extend vertically and diverge from the lowest point. The arc starts where the gap is smallest and rises until the arc is extinguished - at which point it starts over again at the bottom.

For some reason, running this attracted two different hummingbirds.
