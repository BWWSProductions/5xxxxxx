Merlin is the archetypal wizard: Welsh and Celtic in origin, but with connections in Cornwall and middle Europe and, of course, the Arthurian legends. Merlin is clearly the distant relative of Dumbledore and all those weird and wonderful wizards that people our literature.

The documentary traces Merlinâ€™s continuing presence in arts and culture across the world right up to the present day, through blockbuster films, videogames or New Age gatherings at Stonehenge. He offers something beyond mundane daily life. Itâ€™s magic. Itâ€™s irresistible.
