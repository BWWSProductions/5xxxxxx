En tout cas et surtout, bonne santĂÂŠ (and keep up the good work).
Good on ya; from an avid follower in the south of France."

,mattyjmorr,2010-10-07T23:32Z,"Shankly! Great to have you back! I only just found your latest 3 downloads. I had to resort to downloading some other, far inferior, compilations. You surely are a man of great taste...."
,mattyjmorr,2010-10-10T00:58Z,Shanks - can you seed please? And July and August 2010 too. The link to your page seemed to break.
,1shankly1,2010-10-11T13:24Z,"Thanks for the love :)

Am seeding all the 2010 Shankly torrents all the time, so shouldn't be breaking. "
