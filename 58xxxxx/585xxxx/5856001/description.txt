In this spellbinding series Professor Brian Cox visits the most extreme locations on Earth to explain how the laws of physics carved natural wonders across the solar system.

What lifts Wonders Of The Solar System above the many shows that have tackled the subject before, however, are two factors. Firstly, itâ€™s Cox himself, an enthused and interesting host, who explains things well and really helps make accessible the material. Secondly, itâ€™s the utterly stunning visuals. The BBC has mixed in CGI along with images sent directly from space to quite breathtaking effect.

Presented by Professor Brian Cox, the series takes time to investigate the solar system around us, and the many natural beauties contained within it. Across the episodes, Cox covers the likes of planets themselves, the rings of Saturn, the question of whether weâ€™re alone in the universe, and the sun itself.
