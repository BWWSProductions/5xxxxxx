Michael brings over 30 yearsâ€™ award-winning experience in feature films, broadcasting, and television advertising  to Home Baked Entertainment, including work in feature films like â€œStar Trek: The Motion Pictureâ€, â€œConeheadsâ€, â€œStargateâ€, â€œFinal Fantasyâ€, and â€œThe Day After Tomorrowâ€, as well as television work in award winning commercials and the ABC series, â€œLOSTâ€. Prior to his film career, Michael worked with NASA developing advanced image processing tools for the Viking and Voyager Missions.
