,VegasRapedMe,2010-10-21T00:03Z,Thanks dude it worked :)
,zxj00ey,2010-10-27T07:00Z,"i dont understand,, when i press update router it says i need to buy the program to make my torrents scream.. so your serial didn't work?"
,techmech,2010-11-26T07:40Z,@zxj00ey -yeah. the activation key doesn't work anymore. But if you end up purchasing it post up your code after you register so everyone can have it.  (use a fake email so u dont get spammed) i just got lazy and wanted to try this but now im even lazier. so i wont find a new key. i guess im just gonna go and attempt to configure my router myself.
,sikeman214,2011-02-08T01:02Z,"lol ""Seems torrent downloaders know this is the real deal, so why don't you buy one yourself? :D"""

,intrepid9,2011-10-16T02:28Z,Fail Serial -_-

,fc321,2011-11-25T00:36Z,"I swear to God on my life that this serial does NOT work!  Dont waste your time.  When you try to ""apply changes"" it first calls home to verify the serial with a registration server and all these serials I have tried are all BLACKLISTED.  

I even tried editing my hosts file to ban access to the ip it was using to call home but when I did that it just called home to a different ip address (They have multiple registration servers apparently).  i WASTED 30 MINUTES ON THIS CRAP AND AM NOW GIVING UP.  

I hope the programmers get anal cancer and die a slow death.  Bastards!!  

In the meantime I found another program that does similar job as PFconfig and its free:

,fc321,2011-11-25T00:40Z,"If it was like $10 I would pay it, but no way im paying $29.99 for a program i will use one time for 30 second job.  They can go FUCK themselves"

,caro1000000,2012-01-14T03:24Z,"Torrent and Serial works fine..

Just installed and after they got my router name n pw i get a nice msg on the screen to stop wasting time looking for fake passwords and go to the website and purchase their software!! lol for $30 they can suck my left testy!!
,vasukinv,2012-03-28T14:59Z,"Serial worked great, but the software turned out to be useless to my router(Beetel 110TC1).

Anyway, thank you very much for sharing, Slickinator. "
,rahuld3,2012-05-15T09:19Z,"before you forward your port, you need to have a static ip address. it wont work unless you have a static ip.
