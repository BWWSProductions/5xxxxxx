Elements of all the influences that make up Tiger Suit come together on â€œ(Still A) Weirdo.â€ A beautiful acoustic guitar line floats through organic and electronic rhythm sounds, while the lyrics are some of TunstallÃ¢Â€â„¢s most personal. â€œItÃ¢Â€â„¢s one of those rare moments where you can see yourself objectively and look into your own emotional machinery and realize what you are,â€ Tunstall says. The journey continues through the extra-terrestrial blues of â€œGolden Framesâ€ (featuring the formidable Seasick Steve), and the glam strut of the anecdotal â€œMadame Trudeaux,â€ to the up-tempo swagger and hum of â€œGlamour Puss.â€
