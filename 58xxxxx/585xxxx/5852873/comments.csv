Gentle reminder please for S01, only five (5) to go before we have the whole lot.

Please RESEED (one at a time - gives us time to download on our slow connections).

X Factor S01E06 (Boot Camp)
X Factor S01E13 (Performances)
X Factor S01E14 (Performances)
X Factor S01E16 (Final)

Plus a fresh upload of:

X Factor S01E13 Results

Thanks for all your hard work.  Please wait until after the weekend because you have 4 episodes of X & Xtra Factor S07 to upload ;)"

,DjAndy_P,2010-09-26T12:03Z,"#!%&!!!
I managed to download the xtra factor instead of x factor (again...!) and now i'm so pissed. Luckily you had uploaded (the only upload) of x factor. Thank you for that! I can't see why the others only upload xtra factor, so thank you very much!"

,geoffp,2010-09-26T15:40Z,0 seeders - 0 leechers. So how's anyone supposed to download :-(
,ramrodthelarge,2010-09-26T17:47Z,"Thanks again from Greece. As always, quality 10/10"
,asighkick,2010-09-27T01:50Z,"There is something wrong with the tracker stats as shown on the site.  Shows 0 0 but there are many seeds.

Trust me, there are hundreds or even thousands of seeds on a new upload.  Just load it and see.... you will download in no time.

Cheers from New Zealand"
