,fanoftheball,2010-09-27T07:16Z,Thank you so much.  Been waiting weeks. 
,LaLuna666,2010-09-27T15:17Z,That is just pure evil to pretend to have put up episode number 6 when people have  been waiting for weeks :P
,fanoftheball,2010-10-06T02:04Z,"Not sure what you're going on about LaLuna666, this was a good torrent and episode 6. 

Yes, we have been waiting for a while but I'm happy to wait as long as we get them. 

Speaking of which, any chance of some more episodes?"
,Malibu2,2010-10-11T00:57Z,"Thank-you for this! The British, Aussie, and N-Z versions of this show are so much more watchable the the U.S. version."
,Malibu2,2010-10-11T01:16Z,"Thanks for NZNTM! This, BNTM, and OzNTM are so much better than what we're fed in the States."
,fanoftheball,2010-10-25T13:23Z,Any chance we are going to get to see the rest of these????
