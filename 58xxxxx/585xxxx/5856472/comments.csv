[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-10-01T06:56Z,"hey bone think you can help me out? i actually had this game (from the store) but the disk got broken, meaning i have a legit key to play online but my problem is that in the release of this game that i got i cant get ""live"" to come up in the game. any ideas? great release though, works perfectly."
,somedude.1001,2010-10-01T15:21Z,@FuCtUpPuNk: I think you might want to download a direct dvdrip (no crack) of the game instead and use your key.

,sudeep_58,2010-10-02T08:12Z,"Look those having problem of black screen saying ""PROGRAM NOT RESPONDING"" go into the data folder in the game directory, there u will find converter.exe. double click it and follow on screen instruction. It will decompress the game files and your game folder size will reduce to 5.3 gb.Will took around 15 mins. Then run the game from deadrising2.exe not launcher.exe. Now if you are getting error for MSVCR100.dll error. update ur microsoft c++ 2008 to microsoft c++ 2010 from microsoft website. I have win-7, 32-bit, intel core2duo e7200 oc to 2.8ghz and xfx 9600gt 512mb. I am playing at 1366X768, 2X multisampling, 2x anistropic filtering, shadow and detail high, vsync off. smooth gameplay"

,BMW_318tds,2010-10-15T10:28Z,"After trying almost everything (C++ 2010, the Fixing crack, ...) I almost gave up hope, untill I found on a site to do the following: ""Via the control panel, set your sound cards audio sample rate to 24 bit, 48000 HZ""
THIS WORKS!!!"

,CYAM8,2011-04-17T03:59Z,"Hey guys, can anyone help me. I just downloaded the game. I am running Windows 7. I have i5 core, with dual 2.8 ghZ. Anyway, I extracted it with the arc thing and it looked okay. I ran the game, didn't work. So I used the converter, both the Globe one and the conv.exe one. It took a bout 10-15 mins each time. got c++ 10, but that didnt change a thing. I was running it from deadrising2.exe. Please help."
,sasq396,2011-08-20T05:19Z,WORKS PERFECT!!! use free arc to extract update microsoft c++ visual 2008 to 2010 and run globe converter in dead rising 2/ data
