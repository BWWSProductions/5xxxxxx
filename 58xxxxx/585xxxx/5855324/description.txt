Release Title: Dumbo 520p BRrip[Dual-Audio][End-Hindi]~BONIIN

Release Date: 23 October 1941 (USA)
Release Length: 1h 3mn

Tagline: Walt Disney's Latest . . . Most Lovable . . . Funable Characters !

Storyline:Mrs. Jumbo sadly looks on how babies are delivered by stork to colleague circus-animals 
but as even a baby elephant makes a most cumbersome package, so her so is just last to arrive, but 
soon becomes a laughing stock for the jealous herd because of his more then jumbo-size ears, so he 
gets nick-named Dumbo. When she can't stomach the public making fun of her firstborn, she is locked 
up as mad elephant, and the taunted kid finds himself all alone; well, except for a self-appointed 
mentor-protector, Timothy Q. Mouse -subsize, yet ideal to scare the jealous herd- who keeps motivating 
Dumbo. Alas inspiring the circus director to make Dumbo the top (literally) of an elephant pyramid stunt 
literally brings the house down, so he's demoted to clown. When everything seems lost, they accidentally 
discover how they ended up in a tree with a bunch of crows
