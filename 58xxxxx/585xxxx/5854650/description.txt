During the voyage, you will explore the entire ship, deck by deck, room by room, encountering mysteries that have remained hidden for almost a century. Revolutionary underwater robots were designed and built solely for the purpose of allowing the explorers to peer deep into the remains of the once great ship and bring those surreal and haunting images back to the surface.

Loaded with never-before-seen footage, revealing interviews.This unprecedented motion picture event is a must-own companion for anyone who loves TITANIC.
