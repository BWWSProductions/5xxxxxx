,Oo0oO,2010-10-12T09:48Z,"Some fixes about the problems
*When I try to install the game (run EASETUP or AUTORUN) it says 'insert cd/dvd in drive c:'
-dont remove iso from daemon tools or alcohol 120% while/before installing
*when launching the game says insert fifa 2011 cd/dvd
-do the crack u can find it inside iso/image or the link in description just copy the files inside crack folder and paste it to game directory fifa 2011
* How to change the controls?
after crack run game ""fifa.exe"" and the game engine will select ur controls automatically than u quit and go to  Fifa 2011 /fifasetup/fifaconfig but before u run the game dont forget to plug in ur controllers to pc

other problems feel free to ask."
,Oo0oO,2010-10-12T09:52Z,"@twizzaq yes u can try go to Fifa 2011/fifasetup/fifaconfig and enter game settings u config as u like the keybord and than press ok, play :)"

I've checked many times and I did not unmount the iso image from daemon tools. Another thing thats odd is that there isn't the FIFA 11 logo at drive F. Can somebody tell me how to solve this? "

,SlayerX09,2010-10-14T09:23Z,"For all the shitheads out there that talk without thinking. Yes you can play with keyboard but what's the point in doing so? you need at least 3 or 4 freaking hands to push all the necesary buttons. Cause you need to have a key for every action since on a xbox controler you can't set a button for several actions.  

Anyone who loves Fifa on keyboard should keep some distance until a real pc dvd rip will come out.

1. Unrar.

2. Burn or mount the image.

3. Install the game. Use the keygen in the Crack dir.

4. Copy over the cracked content. (edit: replace fifa.exe on the installed directory *example: C:Program Files (x86)EA SportsFIFA 11Game * with the cracked fifa.exe to be able to play it.)

5. Play the game.


6. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT!

Also the goals your player scores shows up in ""career summary"" but in the league leaders your player will be at the bottom with 0 goals no matter how many goals you score.

Does anybody know of any patches/fixes that will correct this annoying occurence?"

,pigeonhaha,2011-01-02T11:22Z,"@ iLuShn, paboz & panos00700
how far have you got in Be a Pro mode? because when you start your player is still in the RESERVE team, so any goals you score or games you win will not show up on the league table because you're not playing for the FIRST Team. I'm in my second season now and I've not had any problems so far. I made it as first team choice at my club (Siena) at about match day 19 in my season 1.

,pigeonhaha,2011-04-27T18:41Z,"@PHHN
& @AnGeLiFe

I don't think you're doing it right.....
-Mount the image
-Install the game to your computer (use the keygen when required)
-Then copy ""fifa.exe"" from the crack folder to the directory where you installed the game (...EA Sports>FIFA11>Game) This should overwrite the original ""fifa.exe""
-To play the game just run the ""fifa.exe"" file that you just copied. (You can now ignore the .iso, it is not needed to play the game, it's only used to install it.)
-You can adjust settings in ...EA Sports>FIFA11>Game>fifasetup>fifaconfig.exe

@michael95
You are correct, EA have used the FIFA10 engine from the console versions in this game. However, it is still the first FIFA game on the PC that runs a nextgen game engine. Think of it as FIFA 10.5. If you want to play the new FIFA11 engine, you can buy the console versions.

help me plz."
,Rudy_Eila,2011-06-03T19:26Z,"The game works just fine.
After installing it, you must open the image up in My computer and copy fifa.exe from the crack folder to the game's main directory in:
C:\Program Files\EA Sports\FIFA 11\Game

Make sure you replace it with the current fifa.exe

For those having control problems, go here: C:\Program Files\EA Sports\FIFA 11\Game\fifasetup

And launch fifaconfig.exe 
And set the control from there.

I have a problem here... The game works well, but sometimes after playing for like 20 minures or so, it will start lagging every like 20 seconds! :(

It is not this torrent's problem as it was a problem in the game it self, but it was fixed by EA in recent patches... But since I can't patch the game, does anyone have a way to fix this? "
,Rudy_Eila,2011-06-03T19:28Z,"@keshav_08 
Go here:
C:\Program Files\EA Sports\FIFA 11\Game\fifasetup

And launch fifaconfig.exe 
And then click game settings and you can change the video settings from there."

Also the goals your player scores shows up in ""career summary"" but in the league leaders your player will be at the bottom with 0 goals no matter how many goals you score.

,JH1970,2011-08-06T16:20Z,"Works fine on W7 64 bit.
After EA patched it, copied over cracked exe and works still.

Settings are on the fifaconfig.exe,  you can change gamepad settings to what you want, however they dont always come up first time ingame, the fix is start the game, go press ESC, go to settings/controller, move thru menu's, Esc back out.  It just seems to make the game realise the controller is there... dunno why but it always does this to me and this always solves it..

Has anyone dared to sign into their EA account with this??"

Dude, when u update the game it is pretty obvious that the EXE gets updated too , means that the crack gets overwritten. So you will need a new Crack for the latest update"

1] Update to 1.01
--> those who have updated to v1.01 use this No-CD Patch
DOWNLOAD HERE - http://d01.gamecopyworld.com/?c=725495341&d=2010&f=flt-f11u1!7z

2] XBOX Version....
--> This is not XBOX version....to promote XBOX Controller for PC [DARN YOU EA]

-->so to know the PC Keyboard controls
you need to go to :
C:/Program Files/EA Sports/FIFA 11/Game/fifasetup/ 
and there open fifaconfig.exe

--> a POP UP will be shown with 3 buttons .... ""play"" ""Game Setting"" and ""exit"".

--> select ""Game Settings"" and then select the ""In-Game Keyboard"" tab.

--> here you will see Keyboard controls on left and XBOX controls on right.

--> now i will tell you the XBOX controls and their function and you can change it to any desired ""Keyboard key""....
      A is for Pass
      B is for Shoot
      Rt is for Sprint
      Lt is for Skills

--> change them to whatever you want....

--> Play the Game.

--> ENJOY !!

P.s. - for better gaming experience first play in WORLD CLASS.... and then when you start beating the teams in World Class...switch to Semi-Pro or Pro.....and then play ONLINE ;D
