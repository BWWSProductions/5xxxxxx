After reviving mainstream interest in rockabilly almost singlehandedly in the early 1980s, the Stray Cats disbanded in '84, but two years later came the first of numerous brief reunions. The fruit of this reunion was the album ROCK THERAPY, on which the trio surrounded a new batch of their own tried-and-true retrobilly sounds with covers of songs by some of their influences--Buddy Holly, Gene Vincent, Chuck Berry, and Charlie Feathers, among others.
