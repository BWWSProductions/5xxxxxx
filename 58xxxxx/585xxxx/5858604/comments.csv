,mojeeq,2011-10-26T12:28Z,"thanx jackhammer84, for the serials"
,cheekyshenanigans,2012-04-05T07:04Z,"Super easy!

Never dealt with torrents w/ my Mac until now.  Used ÂľTorrent along with UnRarX (both free) for the download and extraction, respectively.

Steps I took to install:

1)  Open Adobe All Products Keymaker v2.1.dmg
2)  Select application of choice (not sure if this is needed)
3)  Select 'Patch hosts file'

4)  Open Lightroom 3.2.dmg
5)  Run Installation disc
6)  Select 'Use serial number'
7)  Use Core Keygen to generate a serial number; copy
8)  Paste serial number into Lightroom installation

All done!"
