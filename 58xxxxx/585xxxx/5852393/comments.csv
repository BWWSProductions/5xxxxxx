,almi726,2010-09-28T03:25Z,"VasiaZozulia--Kudos to you! You have no idea how much good you have done to us who look to advance our lives and those around us by learning another language. I am a teacher who opted to dload the program for some of my ESL students as opposed to buying it. I used your application and crack for mac, however I am not successful at installing discs 4 + 5  of American English. I get error code 3221 which asks for an update. I download the updates but to no avail. Any idea to get past this problem. I appreciate your help and wish you the best in life! You have no idea how much you are changing these students' lives!!!"
,Kyle_Rector,2010-09-29T01:18Z,"How do I know if my Rosetta Stone Application CD is compatible with my Rosetta Stone Language CD?

 Please see the chart below to see if your Application CD is compatible with your Language CD. You will find the version number for each printed on the face of the CD. You only need to install the Application once and then you can use any number of Language CDs, so long as all the Language CDs are compatible with that Application. If you have multiple Language CDs of different version, you must have a compatible Application installed for each Language CD.

Rosetta Stone Version 3

Application Version      Language Version
3.4.3                          7.1.x - 7.5 *

,skywat,2010-10-30T06:55Z,"almi726, you sound proud that you are stealing something - like you are entitled to it.  Rosetta spent a lot of money to create and market this program.  What kind of example are you setting for your students.  Make them buy a legal copy if it is useful to them.  I have a legal copy but lost one of the disks - that's why I'm copying it."
,D3xsT3r,2010-11-02T19:53Z,@skywat your still stealing dipshit!! go buy it then get off tpb with you dumb ass excuse!! i hate little fuckers like you..
,3nd3r84,2010-11-03T04:42Z,"Thanks for the great upload!  

For anyone getting errors when starting the program or loading new language levels, have you tried:
1) Enabling the viewing of hidden folders and files
2) Going into the previously hidden C:\ProgramData and under Rosetta Stone deleting the tracking.db3

I've found once I restart after doing this, Rosetta Stone will allow me to add the new levels.  The only downside is that I lose my saved progress but that's not really an issue.

Any chance for a Welsh language pack?  That would rock!"
,3nd3r84,2010-11-03T04:47Z,and it's worked perfectly on my Win7 64 :)
,LifeBringer,2010-11-08T05:49Z,"I always get suspicious when the crack executable is larger than the original. It smells of a new trojan, like the original. Also, I've had problems with VasiaZozulia's software as well."
,almi726,2010-11-16T06:04Z,"@skywat. First off, the fact that you are even REGISTERED for a site that offers pirated material for free dload refutes your point which makes you 1. a hypocrite. Instead of promoting the educational interests of my students who have just moved into the country and cannot clearly speak English, you criticize them which makes you 2. irrational. Given these two facts, I can safely assume that you do not in fact own an original copy of the software which makes you 3. a liar. So VasiaZozulia keep up the good work! And please, haters full of negative energy, please keep your thoughts and wallets in their respective places."

I downloaded it and the crack, installed the program and stopped it before launch as instructed. Then it tells you to replace the original .exe with the cracked one in the folder. However, in the folder there is only a 7.7 MB flash program and not the rosettastone3.exe program that is supposed to be there.

What exactly am I missing here? Any help would be appreciated."

I'm on  Win7 64 and Rosetta Stone allows me to set up my microphone perfectly, but does not recognize my voice during the actual activities. I don't get an error or anything, it just does not hear me speaking. Though it does seem to work if I go to the Control Panel and configure my mic before every single time I speak, but that isn't very helpful. I've tried using a different microphone and that doesn't solve the problem. Has anyone else had this problem or know how to fix it?"

,some-young-guy,2011-02-24T17:46Z,"Overwrite means to replace an existing file with a different file of the same name so copy/paste drag/drop will both have the same result.

Language CDs are ISO images that need to be mounted into a virtual CD-ROM drive such as DAEMON Tools.  A Virtual CD-ROM functions the same as an actual ROM drive with the exception that it exists only in the computer's memory and in like fashion does not mount actual CDs but rather virtual CDs such as ISO images."

Lesoleil - try going into control panel in windows and see if you can update the drivers on your microphone or set it as default. That should hopefully fix your problem. Rosetta stones website probably has some answers to these common problems. I installed on Win7 flawlessly. Not a single problem. And when in doubt restart your computer!"

if that doesn't work for you, go to rosettastone.com and try talking to a live support person.  You have to register a free account, and they don't ask for serial codes or anything like that.  That's assuming you are able to get the program installed and are just having problems with it starting up or error codes or something."
,ThorpeEli,2011-03-23T03:52Z,"does anyone have any idea how to get an activation code?  The program stops me after a certain number of lessons because it says I need to activate it.  Is there some kind of keygen that's available somewhere, or did I miss something in this torrent?

Also, I think I updated the language files.  Not the program itself, just the languages.  Will this cause the whole activation code problem I had?  If so, what should I do, just remove the languages that I updated, then reinstall them without updating?

Thanks!"

Just finished installing Rosetta 3.4.7 along with 3 levels of Arabic which all work great, so thank you for that.

My problem is, I cant install any languages on any other computer, including the same Arabic.
I burned Image to Disk and the languages installed fine on my laptop, but refuse to be recognized on any other computer. Any help would be appreciated.

Useful info : 
-Win7 64 bit on all machines.
-The image DATA was burned, not the image file. (Image file didnt work anyway)
-I hav'nt tried using any mounting software, because I want the languages on CDs. Hopefully the issue can be resolved using CDs. 
-Rosetta stone was installed on the other machines using a CD copy burned from the original download, and the same steps were taken(install, overwrite crack, restart, etc)"

Never get to the part where it asks to install languages. (I can get that far if I do not copy the crack).

,z4uQxYa4,2011-09-17T15:15Z,"Hey guys - I am not an expert by any stretch of the imagination but I downloaded everything as per the directions - yes, I even printed them to make sure I wasn't missing anything. I did the 'crack' copy over the original RS '.exe' file (it was larger) then. I did a reboot of my system. Then attempted to run RS but it stalled and gave me a 'application error 2123'.  Now, Windows 7 placed it in the Program Files (x86) - not sure if that makes any difference. I have deleted the program and removed registry keys and started from scratch - got all the same as before. Like I said, I am no expert and I am still considered a novice to this torrent stuff. Any positive suggestions, advice and guidance would be truly appreciated!
If you are one of those types who are planning on 'flaming me' - don't waste your time or mine. 
Be mature and grown up - we are all at various levels of competency when it comes to this stuff - having someone 'dump' or 'flame' you serves no purpose. "
,SumeklamKidd,2011-09-19T05:45Z,"z4uQxYa4, a few possibilities. Are you installing as administrator, without the Internet hooked up and without your virus program running? This might help. Also, make sure your virus program blocks RS before your fire up the Internet, it will connect every time and ruin your chances. The last thing I can think of, is if you were tagged by RS on the Net, you will likely have to do a fresh install before you can try it again. Hope that helps. "

,sickmuse,2011-12-18T03:55Z,"Thought I'd share what I know about installing/using Rosetta Stone and the associated language packs.

To Install:

Install Rosetta Stone program using the built in installation program BUT be sure NOT to luanch the program when the installation is complete.

Go to C:Program files/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone Version 3 and delete the blue Rosettastoneversion3 luanch file. Replace this with the file of the indentical name from the crack folder you download as part of this torrent.

*VERY IMPORTANT* Before you launch the program you MUST disable your internet connection otherwise the Rosetta Stone program will automatically search for updates.Even if you cancel the update search the program will probably usk you for an activation key afterwards. You MUST disable your internet connection EVERY TIME you use the program to avoid hassles.

*Installing Language Packs*

Once you have downloaded the language packs you want to install, you need to use a program like DAEMON TOOLS to help you load them into Rosetta Stone (there are several other free programs that will do this also). Just google DAEMON TOOLS to find the download site.

The Rosetta Stone program wants to look for language packs on a CD ROM. Daemon Tools creates a 'virtual CD ROM' to which you can add the language pack files. 

Open Daemon tools..you will see ""add images' as one of the tool bar options. Use this function to add the language pack files. Once you have added the files you need to ""mount"" them (one at a time) on the ""virtual CD ROM"". Once a file is mounted it is ready to be loaded into the Rosetta Stone program.

Make sure you internet connection is disabled and then open the Rosetta Stone program. Up in the right hand corner there is an option to ""Add or Remove Languages"" Select this an then go ahead and add the language pack you mounted on the virtual CD ROM in Daemon Tools. Once the language pack is loaded, Rosetta Stone may ask you about updates and you can chose to ""never update"". If you want to add another language pack, go pack to the Daemon Tools program and ""mount' another language pack file, then follow the same steps. Viola! ready to use.

ALL lessons of the language pack should be accessible provided you have always had your internet connection disabled whenever you've used Rosetta Stone. If you open Rosetta Stone with while still connected to the net the program will try to update the language packs. Once this has happened Rosetta Stone will ask you for an ACTIVATION CODE whenever you try to use the language packs. If you don't provide it, you will be locked out of most of the lessons.

*ACTIVATION CODES*

If the program is asking you for activation codes, then the quickiest solution is to uninstall the Rosetta Stone program and then reinstall it. When you reinstall MAKE SURE YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION IS DISABLED. You'll have to load all the language packs again.

I've seen that some people had success with entering XXXXs and 11111 asked for activation codes, but i never had luck with that. Re-installing doesn't take long. As long as you don't let the program update, you shouldn't be asked for activation codes and you should have access to all lessons.

Hope this saves some of you some time and effort.

Happy learning!

 anonymous â˘ 24 Jun 2011, 18:23 

this one works great i had trouble in the beginning like im sure plenty of you had so im gone give you a good step by step help
 1.download the torrent
 2.install exe file (next important)
 3.ok here where it got tricky for me
 4.as soon as you start the installation look for when it says extracting files with the blue status bar going across the screen.
 5.the blue bar will go across the screen 2 times ok.
 6.as soon as the first round of blue bar starts press ctrl+alt+delete and choose start task manager as fast as you can you got to be fast with this.
 7.choose the rosseta stone installation process in the applications tab to highlight it and just be ready to click end task but dont.
 8.next this is what your looking for. on the secound round of the blue status bar going across the screen right before the status bar gets right to the end or a blank dos screen keeps popping up then click end task in the task manager.
 9. the reason for this step is because if you click cancel it will rollback and erase all the files and folders that was installed.
 10. next is the same as usual dont start program go to your progam folder on c: drive in rosetta folder replace the application file with the app file in the crack folder
 11. now this is the only rosetta i can find that will load mounted iso files after these steps i tries all the rest and got rosetta to work but would not find the mounted image file
 12.start deamon tools lite mount iso
 13. start rosetta add language 

I did up to instruction 10 and now it is working. I didnt even have to restart. If you need any help just sent me a message"
