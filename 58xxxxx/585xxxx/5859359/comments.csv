,AnitialD,2010-10-01T04:19Z,There is seeders...who hasn't noticed that NOTHING shows seeders for the last few days on tpb...cmon people
,nhprm,2010-10-01T04:24Z,I think the tracker's been down lately.  Just because seeds are not reporting doesn't mean that DHT etc will not function to give you the seed you need

,NotEnoughTime,2010-10-04T04:30Z,This episode is really good. It'll be worth the wait if downloads are slow. I've already seeded once over though so it's just not showing on the description.
