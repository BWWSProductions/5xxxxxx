     An attorney in a rush to make a court             
     appointment to file legal papers involving a      
     multi-million dollar trust accidentally           
     collides with an alcoholic insurance              
     salesman, who also is a rush for a court          
     appointment involving the custody of his          
     children. The attorney leaves the scene of        
     the accident and strands the salesman,            
     causing him to miss his custody hearing.          
     During the process of the post-crash              
     discussion, the attorney accidentally drops       
     the papers he needs to present in court. The      
     judge gives him until the end of the day to       
    present the papers and thus begins a cat and      
    mouse game between the proponents.
