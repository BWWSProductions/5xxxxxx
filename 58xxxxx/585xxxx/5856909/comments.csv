Black hawk down
N more.."
,prank0007,2010-09-28T10:35Z,"not seen this movie will catch it
luks nice bro..."
,himansu_007,2010-09-28T11:02Z,"I Think You Only Give Importance Only To Video Not Audio 
Any Way If You Are Doing Predators Then Please Keep The 5.1 channel Sound .
With Out It The Movie Experience will decrease its thrilling sound qualities 

If Possible Skip The Iron Man 2 it has Been Uploaded By many Uploaders As well as in small sizes 
instead upload some user request's it Will make you popular "
[V],prashant22,2010-09-28T11:33Z,"@prank
yes i also think so it looks nice..kanha hv got some good choices...

@himansu
sorry cant keep 5.1...if u want a thrilling experience then download some 2gb version...
i upload small sized rips a 5.1 will increase the length...
n u can make requests if u want just dont tell me how should i do it or what should i do and should nt do...
no one except u have a problem with audio...just check riddlera's, pluto's, yify's or gunnersrock's uploads u'll find the audio bitrate just like mine...thats why it is possible to upload in small size..."
,himansu_007,2010-09-28T12:06Z,"i dont hv any problem with ur audio and i hv n't saying its bad i only said poor 
so if its not possible 2 put the 5.1 audio its ok .

N

i am not telling u how 2 do it or not
U do as u want i just suggest thats all"
,DSIN,2010-09-28T12:31Z,"thanx for the movie bro... 
not my type but i'll giv it a watch anyways....XD


"
,tylr,2010-09-28T12:33Z,"GokU61:
nobody's complaining, i really don wanna say this.. but u do have a good sense of making quality videos.. 
..its like creating a 'bench-mark' in itself..
...always do some interesting movies & stay the way u are, damn! u are good ^_^ congrats."
,kanha,2010-09-28T12:41Z,"@prashant22
u r right buddy....

@all
those who want 5.1ch audio they can get from other uploaders......there r plenty of uploaders on tpb like 'secretmyth' uploading in 5.1ch but their rips costs size, i.e max. of their uploads r above 1.5gb.....
so if u want u better do from others, for u'r thrilling experience........"
,himansu_007,2010-09-28T13:09Z,"@Prashant

Ok As i Said Its Upto U So R u improving Some Audio Quality Or Not ?

Like at least ac3-64KbpsTo 128Jbps or whatsoever

Anyway Whats Next Rip ?
"
[V],prashant22,2010-09-28T13:58Z,"@DISN
u really should try some movies of this genre some movies r really nice...

@tylr
thanks for ur compliments

@himansu
my friend i dont know if u read before bt i wrote once that i try my best to provide quality considering size...i dont know bt i think i hv got a internet connection with speed just like u guys must hv got...
my dwnlod speed is avg 40-45kbps
n upload speed is abt 30kbps..
so to upload a 600mb movie only takes much time...
so u see what i m trying to say...

n i'll nt use ac3..aac is better than that...abt the bitrate i dont know it will depend on movie i'll see that..

n my next upload will be iron man 2 as i said...i know u must hv downloaded that already...bt i'll upload it because it was iron man 2 movie which made me think to give ripping a try...although due to some reasons i was nt able to upload it till now...bt after 8 days i hv managed to download a 6.5gb version so i hv to upload it anyhow..."
,DSIN,2010-09-28T14:01Z,"himansu : u don't know how to request someone do u ? 
1. prashant is the encoder & he'll do wat he wants....so take it or leave it :P
2. only ure having problem with aac 35 kbps.... i should tell u that there is not  much difference in quality between this & ur ac3 64 kbps... ears can't tell ...the difference is so negligible...
3. quit ur bossy attitude... i've read some comments to know that u just don't know wen to stop(riddlerA vs kickass debate) .... 
u suggested him to increase bitrate...now he'll do it if he wants... 
XD"
,DSIN,2010-09-28T14:07Z,"@ prashant : i watched many movies like this one.... its just that i prefer psychological, thrillers, crime, action etc...& on top of that i watch anime so not much time for romantic comedies XD"
[T],MitZep,2010-09-28T14:19Z,hey pls dont do iron man predators as it has already been done by other uploaders.. pls upload some old movies such as oceans series...
[V],prashant22,2010-09-28T14:32Z,"yes himansu if u dont know i'll tell u a 32kbps aac is almost equivalent to 128kbps ac3...
as mp4 or mkv are superior to avi similarly aac is superior to ac3...

@MitZep
buddy why dont u try to undestand..i hv to do iron man 2...as i hv already finished downloading it so i hv no choice then to do it..."
[V],prashant22,2010-09-28T14:41Z,"@MitZep
oceans triology is already done by gunnersrok.."
,himansu_007,2010-09-28T14:50Z,"@Prashant

[T],MitZep,2010-09-28T15:50Z,"hey thanx i found oceans movie some of  gunnersrock torrents have gone anonymous 
that is why cudnt find it......"
,DSIN,2010-09-28T16:10Z,"@prashant :thanx bro for backing me up  ...but like i said... he doesn't know wen to giv up XD

@himansu : nice try kiddo but its 10 yr too soon for u to be able to hack me off :P now peace ^^ ...don't wanna flood here :)"
,smasudi,2010-09-28T16:29Z,"no ofeence, but dont waste ur time on these
