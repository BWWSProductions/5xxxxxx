[b]TVO - The Agenda with Steve Paikin, September 27 2010: Iran Confronts the Region[/b]

[u]The Debate: Iran Confronts the Region[/u]

There is a growing fear of Iran in the Middle East. Perhaps nowhere is this fear more palpable than among Sunni Muslims and Israelis. Will this common threat bring these two sides together? And will this foster the larger issue of possible peace in the region?

Iran Gets Nukes. So What?[/url]
for Empire (I)[/url]:

[quote]See also,Iran Gets Nukes. So What?,"[/url] for an analysis of the hideousness of the Clinton administration's sanctions policy against Iraq, and how that policy [i]inevitably and necessarily[/i] led to the Bush administration's criminal invasion of that country in 2003.

For identical reasons, punishing sanctions against Iran now so eagerly sought by the Obama administration will, in time, lead to the same result, if the policy remains unaltered. Yet many liberals and progressives again champion a strong sanctions policy as the [i]desirable[/i], supposedly "peaceful" and "realistic" alternative to war. But as shown inIran Gets Nukes"[/url] and other essays here, [b]a sanctions regime is not an alternative to war: it is the prelude to attack or invasion. Moreover, sanctions murder a hideous number of innocent people as surely as more overt acts of war.[/b][/quote]
