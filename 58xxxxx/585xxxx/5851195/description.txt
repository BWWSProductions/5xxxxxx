The Impulse! label was started as a jazz subsidiary of ABC Records in 1960 under the direction of Creed Taylor and soon after the label's creation, Bob Thiele. Impulse is known as The House That Trane Built because of John Coltrane's 1961-67 association with the label. It operated until 1979 (though new recordings had stopped by 1977; it survived on with reissues), soon after ABC was bought by MCA Records and shut down along with all of the other ABC-affilated labels. 

MCA revived the label mainly as a reissue imprint with a few new releases in the 1980s. It was reactivated as part of MCA-owned GRP with new artist signings including Diana Krall in the 1990s. Following a series of major label buy-outs and mergers, Impulse! is now part of the Verve Music Group unit of the larger multi-national Universal Music Group where it is currently a reissue-only label.
