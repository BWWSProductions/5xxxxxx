Is there a way to play wbfs files off of a FAT formatted drive now?"
[V],r3dcat,2010-10-03T11:58Z,"@wardrich: Yes you can play wii game files (wbfs, iso, ciso) off a USB drive or SD card partitioned in either WBFS or FAT32 or NTFS format. All just depends on your preference/choice in formats and software."
