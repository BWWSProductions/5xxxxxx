[V],twentyforty,2010-09-27T14:37Z,It's a glitch of TPB.
,lilars26,2010-09-27T15:29Z,Thanks 20-40.TPB has a lot of glitches these days.Another manic Monday for uploaders.For some reason they run a lot of good shows on Sunday night.
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-27T16:07Z,"It is, however, closely connected to numbers which database get from trackers. Last week or more none of the public tracker servers works - at all or just randomly, for few minutes. Reasons for that are mainly in domain ""if you stop the tracker-servers, torrents would stop to work"" - and to some extension, that is, unfortunately, the truth.

Torrent network needs places where ""hashes"" of available files are accessible by public, that way we all now what, where and how is something available.

DHT was invented to overcome that, but many of the people deliberately have disabled DHT for mostly ""mythical"" reasons - or have torrent programs which have crippled or wrong DHT implementation.

Mostly because of omnipresent stupidity, people seems to be unable to open ONE frikkin UDP port on their routers, high-numbered of course, but not the same one as for ""normal"" TCP. People have crippled - themselves. In tiny room whee HollyBolly cannot touch them."

Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers
Jon

P.S. thanks for the update on the seeding issue. I figured it was a TPB problem as these things mostly are. "
