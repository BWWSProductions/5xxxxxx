Besides the familiar melodies and memorable themes, the artists effectively inject a distinct sense of swing amid impassioned soloing and an upbeat demeanor to the Beatles' historic legacy. Here, the musicians reharmonize many of the now-familiar motifs into forums for extended improvisations, a few funk grooves, peppery interplay, and buoyantly executed rhythms, as the band should be commended for their stylized approach to the Liverpool legends' pop/rock frameworks. Thus, in lesser hands, the listener might be subjected to humdrum, straightforward renditions of songs most of us have heard ad infinitum; otherwise, the trio often instills a sense of ownership and good cheer throughout this altogether vibrant affair."
