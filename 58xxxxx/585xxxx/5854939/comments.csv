,joe28753,2010-09-27T06:34Z,"it starts playing fine in VLC (although i only have about 15% complete), so i'm assuming and hoping the rest is fine too. thanks!"
,Boodaboy,2010-09-27T07:57Z,Something here killed my laptop.  Refuses to boot now.  Says that no bootable devices exist.  Careful here.
,dark_justice1986,2010-09-27T10:44Z,"No need to be careful folks. This one is the real deal and no viruses considering it's uploaded by a trusted user.

I'm not downloading though, because I want to wait until the full season is up and then get all of them. I hate having to wait every week for another episode.. The suspense kills me."
,kater-acme,2010-09-27T11:03Z,"Boodaboy - quit yapping, the file is a all cool. You probably stuck you pencil dick in a USB slot and ruined you laptop in the process.

The DL is good, quality is fine, english subs are already available and posted around (see other Dex S05E01 torrents).

Gonna seed this one for long time and also DL the 720p version.

Tonight's the night :) Just wait for wifey to come back from work, grab a beer and enjoy the show :)

O, 1 more thing - the 550 MB files are all the same. And there are already 10 teams claiming they're the authors. Well fuck them. We'll never know who the author is. Just DL the first available one, keep seeding end never mind the fuckers who want to claim every fucking release out there."
,kater-acme,2010-09-27T11:17Z,"All fine, DL is good, no viruses. Eng subs already available.

LOL @ 10 differents groups claiming the same file upload :)"
