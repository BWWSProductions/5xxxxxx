It is really a rare thing when intellectual songs get to be radio hits.   It usually only happens during times of musical transition and turmoil, and 1992 was certainly one of those times, as the 80s underground sound had come to kick the pomp and glamour rock off the air. 

These Are Days and Candy Everybody Wants certainly got a lot of play in my area, and both are songs with triumphant hooks and bold arrangements, but still retaining Natalie's taut lyricism.   

It is the bold arrangements that really set this appart from all the Maniac's other albums, most of the folky jangle is gone and repositioned with giant musical swells, with lots of strings and bombast.  Songs like Stockton Gala Days take you to all sorts of different places, open air markets and busy sidewalks.  Alot of vitality comes through.   

There are some songs that do dip into more turgid places, some of the more dreary woman issues that Natalie would explore more in her solo work, and this drags down the record a bit, although admittedly her haunting tale in I'm Not the Man about an innocent on death row is quite stirring and a very ominous and awesome way to end the record.
