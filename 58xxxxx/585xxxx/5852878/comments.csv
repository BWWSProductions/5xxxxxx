I'm seeding this at 5MB for a ratio of 20."
,tbone3181,2010-09-26T05:49Z,why do new movies not connect to seeds? as i write this there are 438 seeds and im connected to 2. 2!!! and when i started downloading there were less than 100 seeds so where is the faster speed?

,sybex2010,2010-09-26T16:43Z,"insinuendo thanks for the upload, just had one question, are you uploading at 5MB/sec...or your connection is 5mb and your uploading at around 500kB/s?  Btw I'm getting great speed."
[V],Team_xRG,2010-09-26T17:28Z,"lol...thnx for up man :))

thats probably because tpbÂ´s trackers keep having problems.
when you (and others) make torrents itÂ´s better to add as many open external trackers as possible.

thanks for the upload btw"
