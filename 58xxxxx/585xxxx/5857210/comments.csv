,Quad-K,2010-09-28T23:52Z,"ps. There is 1200 of you at the moment! i only have a 80kB upload rate, so mostly it depends on if your peers are sharing.

Funny how TPB says 0 seeds/ peers :L"

[V],HolyRoses,2010-09-29T05:23Z,Quad-K broke the site i think.
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-29T05:58Z,"This site is always broken.  

RSS has been broken for 3 months now.  

They don't seem to pay attention to simple things like a hung server, or an error in php code, etc.

And they always try to blame it on ""cease and desist orders"" and other DMCA actions against peers and providers.  Like RSS not working, or not being able to submit a torrent have anything to do with that.  These are all php coding errors."

,PhilLesh12,2010-09-29T09:30Z,"Inside their own data center, tpb cannot provide even 99.5% reliability, service or uptime.

There are 15 year old kids providing much better reliability and continuity of service off a laptop using their mom and dad's cable modem for connectivity.

It's not about the network being screwed around with by movie studios and content owners.  It's about having code that doesn't fail.

When your code fails, you FIX IT.

RSS?  Uploading new torrents?  That's all about not fixing your code.  

If people can't upload, but can still access your site, well, um, gee, you have a problem with your code, and if you can't fix it, what the fuck are you doing running a web site?  This is basic shit.

Seriously, there are 15 year old script kiddies who could do a better job."
,Quad-K,2010-09-29T11:14Z,"No Offense guys, but keep the comments on topic. I don't want rage wars and flaming of TPB on my torrent.

Thanks."

,QborT,2010-09-29T18:40Z,"LoL Quad-K all you did was relabel the FQM release.  What a clown, and you want people to stroke your ego for what now?"
,SoftWarez,2010-09-29T19:03Z,"And so? relabel is allowed i guess. And so what, dont make such a big drama about this. Thaks for killing TPB man XD just kidding thanks for the share."

[T],extremezone,2010-09-29T21:21Z,it's because tpb is on court ... i think up function will be available after this trial

,Quad-K,2010-09-30T01:11Z,"YES THIS IS NOT MY RELEASE, and i'll make sure i state this in future uploads if this is the reaction i will get.

I was not able to identify the original source as where i downloaded it from it had been stripped of its identification as well.

I did put effort into putting this online, took me 5 hours + to find it, not to mention that it took several hours to download @ 23KB.

. I don't appreciate being called a Clown, was simply sharing a release i believed was not available on TPB. If YOU do appreciate it, then refrain from commenting."
,QborT,2010-09-30T01:11Z,"extremezone that doesn't make any sense, why would the upload feature be down because of the trial?  Are we to believe that the TPB crew is giving in? I highly doubt that.

If anything I'd say it's just a glitch and nobody is around to fix it.  But I'm just an idiot making wild assumptions so who knows."
[V],phatwarez,2010-09-30T01:53Z,"Haha, everyone is posting here. A similar thing happened not too long ago if I remember."
,gared111,2010-09-30T03:10Z,Somebody forgot to take their PMS meds.
,roryt,2010-09-30T03:15Z,"yeah this happened before. I think it took like 2 weeks to get fixed.

Thanks for the upload

BTW  i think this season premier SUCKED. Nothing really happened...anyone agree? Dexter's reactions to Rita dying are so...not human..? It's really weird actually. I know that is the way he ""is"" but still..he could at least fake it or something. "

,OhMyGuts,2010-09-30T06:51Z,semicolon there are other torrent sites that have porn.alot of the people who upload porn here upload on other sites too
,Quad-K,2010-09-30T07:02Z,"ok, so now we are talking porn on my torrent? REALLY?

I know under the circumstances its gonna be hard, but can we keep the spam to a minimum, if not just PG?"
,OhMyGuts,2010-09-30T07:25Z,grab your dick and double click for porn porn porn!sorry but i had to do it.
,OhMyGuts,2010-09-30T07:26Z,yeah thank u quad-k very fine service
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-30T07:43Z,"@semicolon, use google images to search for your porn.  You can even google for david hamilton if you tend towards the kiddies.

The porn is out there.  You don't need to rely on TPB for porn.

If you want normal people porn, and also want TV shows and Movies, join Torrentday.  http://www.torrentday.com  --  you'll need to maintain a ratio of upload to download, but they usually have TPB files 20 to 30 minutes before TPB, and since they only use their dedicated tracker, it is always significantly faster than torrents on TPB.

The only negative about TD is that they only have ""scene"" files, which means they are all rar files.
"
,OhMyGuts,2010-09-30T08:06Z,torrent day is a good site
,OhMyGuts,2010-09-30T08:08Z,check out tube8.com if ur that hard up
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-30T08:36Z,"@semicolon,

The only reason rar files suck is because they have to be unrared before you can use them.

Now that I finally figured out how to install unrar on my white light Western Digital My Book, it isn't such a big deal.  I can use RSS to pull down all of the shows I wanna watch, and they can automatically be ready watch on my tv without any action on my part.

But, before I figured that all out, I had to keep running upstairs to my PC to fix all that shit.

Most people already graduated from watching movies and TV shows on their computer monitors, and are watching TV again, watching content downloaded, and watched on their ""TV"", using devices like the ps3, wdtvlive, apple tv, whatever."
,Quad-K,2010-09-30T09:28Z,"@semicolon-fhf-1251

I'm not sure if i should be honored or humiliated being compared to an old woman, but cheers.

Although i don't feel i quite fit the description of Activist for a new business model in the new digital age, i do believe  there is going to be a social and political onslaught in concern with pirating and whether it is a vital freedom, or a devil created from the greed of us all. I think that the planets may have aligned, and i just happened to be the lucky (or unlucky) user to get the last upload in before the buggy server got the better of the site. Nothing big."
[V],phatwarez,2010-09-30T09:56Z,Lookup and join your local pirate party if you want to be an activist.
,OhMyGuts,2010-09-30T12:47Z,"so know one is gonna help me!thats because you all cant,stray cats, the album is rock therapy.u couldnt find it even if you wanted to!!!!!!!!!!!! thats a fact."
,ashm1986,2010-09-30T12:58Z,"@ OhMyGuts 

I have Rock Therapy by Stray Cats, will upload it here when the upload is working again ;)"
[V],neon,2010-09-30T13:55Z,i also have that stray cats album...mieow !!
,ashm1986,2010-09-30T14:12Z,"You up it then, lol."
,QborT,2010-09-30T17:12Z,"Thankfully the upload feature is working again and we don't have to look at this useless relabeled Quad-K bullshit.

I know relabeling is allowed but seriously it is a bottom feeder tactic.  Trying to pass of a scene upload as your own is fuckin sad.

Quad-K are you even aware that this isn't an HD rip, it was ripped from an HD source.  Yet you seem to be trying to pass it off as HD?.  It is still just a simple non HD release, again excellent fail Quad-K."
,Quad-K,2010-10-01T00:48Z,"ONCE AGAIN, i'll inform you ""QborT"" that the place i got this from did not supply sources(it was a fileserve thing). When searching ""Dexter Season 5 Episode 1"" on TPB i couldn't find anything for this episode, so i assumed it wasn't available, so i thought i do everyone a favour and upload it.

Its obviously not HD as its 550MB, its simply an indicator of good quality, in this case anyway. It doesn't take a genius to work THAT out. If anyone here was under the impression that this release is of direct HD quality, i'm not too sure they should be using torrents. Despite your beliefs, i'm not some oblivious noob with nothing better to do then steal releases and get my high. I thought it would be appreciated, as many have expressed before you.

I apologies that my uploads are not to your standard, being the awesome uploader you are....oh wait, you haven't uploaded any torrents. Sad. Go troll elsewhere."
,LefThefT,2010-10-01T11:27Z,"Well done Quad-K, Thank you. "
,QborT,2010-10-03T18:17Z,"There was about 8 version of this exact FQM release uploaded before yours.  In total over a dozen versions of Dexter season 5 episode 1 that made it onto TPB before this (I'd say that would make you an oblivious n00b, despite your beliefe that you're not).  

Plus if you couldn't figure out that this was the FQM release even if it didn't include tags.  Then that would be double failure on you

Obviously there is no uploads associated with the QborT name.  This is my commenting account, not an upload account.  If I comment with my upload account I would get dipshits returning the favor on my torrents.  Besides you have 4 torrents uploaded no reason to get all high and mighty, you simply rehash others work in an attempt for some sort of ego boost.

Nothing has to meet my standards, I am not important.  However, when uploaders pull useless n00bish kid maneuvers I do like to point it out and have a laugh at their expense.

THE ONLY REASON YOUR TORRENT GOT SO MANY HIT IS BECAUSE TPB UPLOAD FEATURE WAS FUCT WITH YOUR TORRENT BEING AT THE TOP.  I assure you won't be getting as many tonight if you try this again.  "
,Quad-K,2010-10-04T00:34Z,"Yes, i admit that i missed the other FGM vesion because they all come under the search ""Dexter FQM"" which is something i forgot to search in my rush to watch it. (although there is 8, not 11, and how could i know to search for an FQM release when i do not know who FQM is? smart.)

I'm still 500 seeders strong(with 200 leechers), and  i believe that is because i  added the appropriate keywords the other uploaders failed to do.

And if one is not aware that something exists (say, the FQM version) how can they identify it as so? Your logic is flawed and your insults are childish.

 If you were any age above 15 you would have realized by now that it was a sincere error in judgment and would drop it(notice the edit function has been broken? or did that slip your preteen mind?). But obviously your too emotionally mind fucked by your binge drinking father that you must resort to trolling on my torrent to stop yourself from going on a machete killing spree.

Seriously, gtfo."
,QborT,2010-10-04T16:52Z,"I did say 8 episodes of FQM release, not 11 so I dunno how you got that imaginary number.

The fact that you are 500 seeders strong has nothing to do with keywords.  It has everything to do with the fact that TPB's upload was buggered with this torrent at the top, giving it major exposure.  So as a result this became a hotbed for activity.  The fact that is also includes upwards of 70 comments is also a draw for downloaders that are curious.

And as far as the search goes.  I typed ""Dexter"" and all the uploads appeared (you don't need the FQM tag into the search)  yours, FQM, and all the other P2P re-encodes.  Now you're just making up bullshit to try and make yourself look less ridiculous.
"
,Quad-K,2010-10-05T01:35Z,"LOL Yea i did mix up the FQM numbers....


But you forget to mention that they are at the end of the list unless you order by upload date, in which they all show zero seeds, which at the time i was unaware of the issues that TPB was having with showing correct numbers.

And no, thats bullshit. thirty minutes after i uploaded i had 1200 leechers. Doesn't seem enough time to get really hyped over the Uploaded feature being down, if more than 5 people knew about it that quick after it occurred.

I know you think your apart of the Justice League and need to beat down on all the mislabeled torrents on TPB, but seriously. I made a mistake. I would correct it but i can't until the edit feature is online. You KNOW this, but continue to waste your time justifying yourself. Grow up."
