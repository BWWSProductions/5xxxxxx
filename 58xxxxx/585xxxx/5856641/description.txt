"Selfish"

When Della (guest star Stoner), a seemingly 
healthy and active 14-year-old, suddenly 
collapses during a skateboarding exhibition, 
House and his team struggle to diagnose her 
condition and reassure her parents who 
already have to cope with their son's 
terminal illness. After her body rejects a 
donor lung, and with time running out to 
save her life, Della's family is left with 
little hope of securing a new donor and 
faced with a seemingly impossible decision 
regarding the fate of both children. 
Meanwhile, House tries to appease an elderly 
father and his son at the clinic, and House 
and Cuddy begin to face the challenges of 
taking their romantic relationship into the 
workplace.

Enjoy :)
