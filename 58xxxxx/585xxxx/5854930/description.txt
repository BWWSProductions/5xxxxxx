"The Homecoming"

It's been a year since the Walker family was torn 
apart by a tragic car accident, and in a very un-
Walker like fashion, everyone has been avoiding 
everyone else. Truths and reality only start to set 
in when the family is forced to come together for 
Justin'shomecoming party: Nora tries to prepare for 
the party, but is not acting like the mother she 
used to be; Sarah is consumed with the Narrow Lake 
deal; Kevin has a new career as public defense 
attorney; Saul and Scotty are running their 
restaurant; and Kitty's life has become a taboo 
subject for everyone. Time has changed the Walkers.

Enjoy :)
