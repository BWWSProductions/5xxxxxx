,starsprite3,2012-06-28T00:28Z,"Thanks for the download.  Was some lagging and skipping in this episode.  Otherwise, not bad.  V/8; A/8.  Quit seeding as soon as download completed so share ratio: .462.  Wish it had seeded more, maybe would have helped.  Torrent zone you might want to check this for problems. "
