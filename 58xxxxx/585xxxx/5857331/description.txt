Storyline:

Three snowboarders they get stranded on a ski chairlift taking them to the last run of the day.
When the ski patrol switches off the night lights, the threesome realize with growing panic and dread that theyÃ¢Â€â„¢ve been left behind, dangling high off the ground with no way down.
With the resort closed until the following weekend, and frostbite and hypothermia already setting in, the trio is forced to take desperate measures to escape off the mountain before they freeze to death.
