The Move began life as one of the most stylishly garbed and musically adventurous
outfits to trawl through London's fiercely competitive mid-`60s club scene, and made
their name with a series of jaw- dropping early singles that combined lyrical whimsy
and adventurous psychedelic textures with a grasp of pop fundamentals that rivaled
Paul McCartney's. Salvo's massive, four-disc ANTHOLOGY collects all of these
seminal early singles and contains generous samplings from the remainder of the
group's career, including 30 previously unreleased tracks.

2008 limited edition four CD box set from the '60s band led by the genius mind of Roy
Wood. The first pressing comes with five exclusive Move postcards and a doublesided
poster! More than 40 years in the making. 62 career-spanning tracks and well
over three hours of Move magnificence in one superbly remastered box set! Contains
classic hit singles, B-sides, choice album cuts, a wealth of previously unreleased
material including never-before-heard songs, demos, alternate takes and live
recordings from 1966-72. The full-colour 72-page booklet with rare and unseen photos
and memorabilia includes extensive 10,000-word Move history and band interviews
with complete track-by-track info and UK discography. The Move were one of THE
great bands of the '60s and this set will make a believer out of you! it reminds the
listener of just how great The Move were and how, for a few seasons, they alchemised
chaos into pure gold.
