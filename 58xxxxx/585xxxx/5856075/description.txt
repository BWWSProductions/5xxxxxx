Show Nfo - The adventures of the "Family Guy"'s neighbor and deli owner, Cleveland Brown. 

More Nfo - This FOX animated comedy is a spin-off of the much-loved series Family Guy. The series features the adventures of Peter Griffin's neighbor Cleveland Brown. Many years ago, Cleveland made a promise to his old high school sweetheart, Donna. Cleveland, along with Cleveland Junior, move to Stoolbend, VA to start a new life with Donna and her two children. 

My personal review - I think that this show is funny, but not as funny as Family Guy. Family guy is just one of those shows that is hard to beat cuz it's the original and you expect so much of it.  Like people like the original version of a movie, lets say The Excorsist, it was just awesome, but then they remake it and people don't think that it is as good as the original.
