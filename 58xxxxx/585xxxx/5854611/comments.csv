[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-28T21:28Z,"@Shitdog3 

Just relax buddy, stay cool, and try not to say stupid things. This is working, and you can read that it's confirmed by others. 

Once avast haS been activated you should be able to update ONLY the engine and virus definitions (Auto or Manual). Probably the correct file for updating is not connected to internet. Make sure to start avast (click the start button in the avast main screen) once it's opened.


BTW: You're not a cloned person, so no need to talk in the WE form. since it's just between you and me and nodbody else."

sometimes people are unable to use programs because they are either mentally retarded or just stupid and do not understand simple basic instructions.
it appears you are one of those type of people.)
Thank you TheArfen , nice to know , i am one of this , but why did you wrote all the other things also (A feature of most of our programs is their ability to update themselves automatically. If you are connected to the Internet, virus database updates are downloaded and installed automatically without any user action. The availability of a new version is checked when an Internet connection is established, and every four hours afterwards. Update files can also be downloaded from these pages : http://www.avast.com/download-update if required e.g. if your computer does not have an Internet connection. Updates are usually released on a daily basis.
Note: No reinstallation of the program is needed for virus database updates! )
if i am one this type of people ?
I am sorry , and if you can read TheArfen , i have uninstall this here , and install another , there works for me , finish finito , bye-bye ."

but ima gonna start using you're newer avast again dude ... just about to download it now and i believe it will also work fine :D

BTW, about the win7 troubles, i posted my instructions on the last post of your previous version torrent of avast :D ... just copy-paste it here or link it or re-type it or whatever up to you if someone had troubles again :D ... did'nt noticed there's a newer one so i wrote my first comment on the older one XD"

About your avast error: the install notes says to download only engine and virus definitions, which means clicking that button only. Any other way to update avast may cause errors/problems. So always just update as the install notes adviced."

For questions and request which are not related to a torrent it's preferred to use other options, for example the forum related to TPB: http://forum.suprbay.org/

[i terminated AvastUI.exe

but i couldnt find AvastSvc.exe(i got windows 7) i did it through task manager]

but next day i started my comp then it prompted and said that ""ashbase.dll"" is not in your computer reinstalling will solve his prob

then i reinstalled it and terminated AvastUI.exe but there is a problem 

u said if the self defence module doesent disable then reboot your pc and i did now i cannot copy and paste ashbase.dll because when ever i terminate ""AAWTray.exe"" it just comes back on again and says that ashbase.exe is open in another program"

my solution was already posted on RH's previous avast 5.0.594 so i was just waiting for someone to repost it XD ... but duh no one reposted it so i'll just repost it here ...

- go to the windows task manager
- click the ""services"" tab (the 3rd tab)
- on the lower right corner click the ""Services..."" (the one with the ""run as admin"" icon), it will let you go to the services window thingy XD
- search and highlight the ""avast! antivirus""
- on the upper left click ""stop""
- and tada! the ""terminate avastsvc"" thingy is done :D

......now you can copy-paste-replace the crack on the original folder :D

note: there are 2 other services on that window that is with avast like the e-mail guard something, dont highlight them, just highlight the ""avast! antivirus"" and those two will be automatically stopped when you click stop button :D"

,AlmightyDread,2010-10-24T22:27Z,"Yes, RobbingHood, you are very clever, but I'd be willing to bet that you do everything with this ""one hand"" you refer to, because your other hand is constantly occupied by your tiny cock.

The fact is, I followed your cracking instructions, including putting in the scanning exception, and that is the way it worked out for me. I came back to qualify my first comment, to report that I installed the IS version on a laptop, and it gets the updates OK (first time, I installed Pro version on a PC). I couldn't say why one worked and not the other, I suppose it's just one of those things.

Here's a piece of advice from a braindead man: accept the fact that your torrent does not work perfectly under all circumstances, and you won't come off as such an insecure prick."

For people having trouble ending the 2 processes in task manager, go to task manager, click the services tab, in the lower right you can run it as an administrator if you have to.

Hey no problem, just trying to spread your work. Anyways, it's not a big problem, but it can be a big annoyance to a lot of people. What's the point of having a crack if you can't have it auto update? I mean, if you had a pirated license file, and it gets black listed, it does the same thing, can't update. But at least I found out how to do this. :D"

Why don't you try to download the torrent and install on a clean install of windows and let us know if it works for you before you start saying that it works perfectly fine.  I've tested this through numerous internet connections and on numerous computers and it doesn't work anymore.  The older version doesn't work either.
,undead_police,2010-11-09T13:17Z,"I agree with Reepime U should try clean installation, not that we are blaming you RobbingHood or anything like that since you providing us tons of stuffs. We just wanna let you that we are facing this issue and it would nice if u have any new updates or patches to counter this issue."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-11-09T23:33Z,"This works for 99,99% of all users, incl. myself. The other 00,01% are either stupid, trolls, or other kind of idiot.

Unless you've got a cheeseburger to offer then consider posting compaints as useless. "

,Tivoism,2010-11-10T03:28Z,Thanks RH! Took me only 2 minutes to get it working and got rid of and saved 70 mb of memory usage from using Avira. There should be a rating option here so we could rate.
,killr,2010-11-10T17:42Z,  Thanks worked great kinda hard but hey its free. Just wish there was just a button I could push LOL. 
,paranormalguy,2010-11-12T14:52Z,"Peace of cake to crack, newbz."
,shane2323,2010-11-13T15:07Z,"i had the previous version of this installed decided to go to the newer one, i'm familiar with the intallation but this time around when i try to activate the trial it say, ' tial period can not be activated please check to see if you computer is connected to the internet and your proxy settings are correct' i am connected to the internet and followed the read me !! anyone know whats up?"
,SaiyanB,2010-11-14T16:37Z,It's work for me few days ago. bt when i installed newly now it says Avast license can not be activated bcz the trial license cant activate from internet..can any 1 help me plz..
,dennis96411,2010-11-16T02:24Z,"Hey RobbingHood! The update method I found no longer work! I think avast! patched their vpsupd.exe! It says license for the product expired! I think you might wanna make a new crack, or make a definition update for this, because auto and manual way for me doesn't work."
,dennis96411,2010-11-16T02:32Z,"@RobbingHood to your old comment, I added that line about renaming it, because I followed your instructions and couldn't update definitions in the end, then I found the solution [which no longer work]."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-11-16T04:17Z,"@dennis96411 

As long as ONLY the engine and virus definitions are updated things should be fine.
To update manual use only the ""Update engine and virus definitions"" button.

Do NOT press the ""Update Program"" button, and do NOT update the program version. 
Disable ""Update Program"" at Settings-> Updates-> PROGRAM: Select ""Manual update"".

I've just updated avast, and everything is still running fine here. 
Once again: This kind of crack probably cannot be blocked as long as avast uses this system."
,dmx89,2010-11-17T01:49Z,"thnx, it works perfectly!"
,dennis96411,2010-11-17T04:28Z,@RobbingHood Are you sure? They can add some kind of crack detection in the VPS updater. How do I update now?
,dennis96411,2010-11-17T04:29Z,"PS. I never update the program, the updater never worked in the first place, why else would you think I found the manual update method which no longer work for me?"
,Jollejuicebox,2010-11-18T18:41Z,"Seems to no longer work like stated above..
If already installed it works just fine but it can no longer be installed.
any ways around it`?"
,j3rom3,2010-11-19T22:41Z,"WORKS! I love you robinhood! 

Just follow the tutorial carefully and it should work fine! Remember to close in task manager avast applications."
,odeegulmatico,2010-11-21T06:03Z,working! good 'til 2025! :D
,Castayr,2010-11-22T00:53Z,followed instructions and its so far been working perfectly
,sabian.ro,2010-11-25T12:05Z,This key is no longer valid.
[V],RobbingHood,2010-11-25T15:57Z,"@sabian.ro 

Obviously you're posting at the wrong torrent or you're just stupid, cause this has no key but crack. "
,tnas11,2010-11-25T17:47Z,can you upload the CRACK alone please!
,dennis96411,2010-11-25T18:03Z,"Actually, I get License has expired error when I try to update the definition using the manual vpsupd.exe method. I went on YouTube and found a working license, so now it updates automatically. I had to remove the cracked ashBase.dll and put the original back as well. It just doesn't work for me anymore."
,kotekk,2010-11-25T19:49Z,"It is a nice job ,works perfectly !!!!!
Installation is not easy ,but successful
Thanks a lot"
,ea_jones,2010-11-27T05:52Z,"""07. Copy/paste the included cracked ashBase.dll from the crack folder into 
    the avast program directory (replacing the original ashBase.dll file). 
    Default avast program directory -> C:\Program Files\Alwil Software\Avast5
    * You may need to copy/paste the crack as Administrator.
    * If the original ashBase.dll cannot be replaced with the cracked ashBase.dll
      then just drag out the orignal ashBase.dll, and copy/paste the cracked 
      ashBase.dll into the same directory. Or eventually copy/paste the cracked 
      ashBase.dll in Safe Mode (F8) using an Administrator account.""

With this step, I used Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware's FileASSASSIN to get rid of the old ashBase.dll."
[T],qwersd,2010-11-28T09:00Z,"got it to work..
when it says it is not able to connect to the internet, just ignore the message and restart the computer..
it worked for me.."
,cbgoding,2010-11-29T16:44Z,"Followed the instructions carefully, works fine, updates engine+definitions automatically. turned off avast in the startup, did the ashbase.dll crack in safe mode, rebooted, and it worked fine. didnt even have to use the alternate trial thing.


basically if you fail at this, it is indeed user error; stop being bad."
,3doxiemom,2010-12-06T01:28Z,"wow - this was a GREAT share! I rated it for you also. Thanks so much for your efforts on this - too bad we all have to put up with those that use the foul language and abusive talk towards you...it's really not necessary...the only comment I wanted to make about the instructions that gave me difficulty was at the point of the ashbase.dll crack copy/paste - just remember, if you can't do it logged on as YOURSELF (even if you have administrative rights, which I did!) - I just logged in in SAFE MODE and voila! Everything is working beautifully! Have it on Win XP Media Edition, VISTA, and Windows 7. All working great. Again, your efforts are greatly appreciated RobbingHood!! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year till 2025!!"

,iferhat,2010-12-27T10:46Z,After installation including crack and all DO NOT UPDATE PROGRAM you can update definitions BUT NOT PROGRAM. If you update program the crack till 2025 is wiped out of existence.

bit how do i install the other?"

avast! Internet Security includes avast! Pro Antivirus, but also it includeds a firewall.
That's not hard to find out, cause it's also mentioned in the torrent description.
Only complete idiots and people who don't read will try to install both. "
,jaxus,2011-01-20T00:12Z,works perfectly
,Ender-,2011-01-23T06:06Z,"Ok, so I installed and cracked the Antivirus one. Does this mean I cannot do the same with the Internet Security one now?"
,MICR0S0FT,2011-02-14T01:34Z,"First.. GREAT UL !!

Secondly.. answer a question time :D ...

One more time for the cheap seats...

You can only crack ""ONE"" or the other, you cannot
crack both. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS provided in
the .rar file...

Also, make sure that you set the program updates to
MANUAL otherwise you will be back on the trial
version, have to uninstall and then reinstall...
