IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO: Thanks to a very good friend... :)
AUDIO: Thanks to a very good friend... :)

Video on this was pretty good other than the odd auto focus issues. First was the colors, we messed about with the rgb colors and also brightened it up a bit, along with lowering the chroma and that dulled the real bright spots. The audio was ac3 from the source files so we opted to leave that because it sounds fairly good for cam audio. You can hear the odd laughing and such, but not bad at all. Sample was made so you could hear the laughter at one certain spot...

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
