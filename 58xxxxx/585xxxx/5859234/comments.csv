,tommo39,2010-10-01T03:31Z,thanks R.H. great program!
,orangeryderone,2010-10-01T04:38Z,"cant get past point where i am to click sys mech.exe says ""user cancelled action"""
[V],RobbingHood,2010-10-03T03:17Z,"NOTE: 
*****
The activator also works for System Mechanic v10.0.0.70, which has been released just after
this version. The only difference is that now you need to enter any email address during
installation (instead of afterwards). If the ""Next"" button then still is grayed out just
press the ""Back"" button and then again the ""Next"" button."
,shilalydawg2,2010-10-13T21:13Z,"RH, I'm having the same problem as orangeryderone. I've read through the installation instructions multiple times, but I still cannot seem to get past the part where you click ""Target Component"" and select ""SysMech.exe"". It says ""User Cancelled Action"" and doesn't allow me to do anything else.
Do you have any advice?"
,hunnicuddler,2010-10-14T05:36Z,i got it installed but the defrag won;t work
,auto14,2010-10-16T10:32Z,i have a question...whyy should i not install SysMech AntiVirus and Firewall???
,carbonash,2010-10-22T17:33Z,"works like a charm. great torrent RH. keep them coming. 

@orangeryderone  are u using the activator 1.0? use the activator 3.1 with administrative priviledges. and it is important to copy the activator into the SM folder and also activate the online patch. cheers all credit to RH"
,leon000222,2010-10-25T22:43Z,"i found this program from a comment from someone that originally used uniblues repair program, and i have to agree with him that this program is alot better, took me a bit to figure out how to make the activator work, and its a very nice prog, my only problem with it is that it likes to exit on its own, and im not sure if it crashes or if its supposed to do that."
,balcer16,2010-10-26T15:22Z,"I have a problem with this. Doing everything as you said, and when I run activator (old or new) use it restart and always my SM10 is out of dated :( ofc I did everything like in manual.. any1 knows how to repair it? maybe it is fault of v.9 when I forgot to block connection?"
,11western,2010-10-28T15:58Z,"When I open the 3.1 activator( as admin) the buttons are grayed out so I can't click on them. Had added the exceptions to avg, but still that's as far as I can get. please help"
,TheRealScrewtape,2010-10-31T13:25Z,"No viruses, trojans or other garbage with any of RH's items. If you think you are having problems, simply do not use TPB. You can always pay for software, so feel free not to use TPB."
,88turborx7,2010-11-01T02:12Z,"Great program, installed it with out a problem.  Ran a scan and fixed a bunch of problems.  The next day tried to run it again and it says :this license is disabled"" ??  It wants me to reactivate..do I have to run the activator again and every time I want to use it?"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-11-01T02:18Z,"@11western

If the activator buttons are grayed out just wait a few seconds."
,88turborx7,2010-11-02T01:42Z,"Ok, I used the activator again and was able to get another use out of it.  Once it did the scan and fixed all the problems it said ""license is disabled"" again.  what's the problem??"
,skinny_gorilla,2010-11-03T14:21Z,"Thanks RobbingHood!!!

1. Online Armor

,jkl32,2010-11-12T19:55Z,"thanx for the virus cock sucker..Hopefully u burn in hell and demons eat your testicles...you are a virus on earth and someday u will be irradiated by a cure for fuck wads, when us honest people can cipher douche bags like you!!!!"
,kejser11,2010-11-14T19:50Z,"@jkl32 If you would just have taken the time and read through the comments. You would know then that if you scan this, you are likely to get a false positive. THAT means that your AV-program think its a virus, even if it is not. Next please THINK before you post other comments making YOU look like an idiot..."
,brinta.1,2010-11-17T05:31Z,these activators don't work with 10. activators say that they can't enter registry
[V],RobbingHood,2010-11-17T09:03Z,"@brinta.1

Try running the activator as Administrator (as described in the install notes) before complaining."
,Sn2,2010-11-29T23:41Z,Hmm.. Not sure I've installed correctly.. It says that im running a standalone version and asking for a upgrade to maximum service.
,Sn2,2010-11-30T03:38Z,"Apparently I'm experiencing the same issue as 88turborx7. Whenever I rebooted the PC, the license will automatically deactivated."
,Sn2,2010-12-01T12:02Z,Out of luck. :( Any clue? :p
[V],RobbingHood,2010-12-01T12:23Z,The activator also works for the new released SM 10.1.027
,Sn2,2010-12-04T14:48Z,"Is it just me or anyone else having the same issue as me?? the license will automatically get deactivated right after rebooting the pc.

P.S: I'm not complaining, infact I really appreciate the the hard work the uploader put into this."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-12-12T23:50Z,"@Sn2 

On XP the activator 3.1 still works for the newer SM 10.1.1.1."
,Sn2,2010-12-13T15:18Z,"Hi RobbingHood

Thanks for your response. Well, im running vista. The 3.1 activator actually worked for me but whenever I rebooted my pc I get deactivated again."
,MedoAlmasry,2010-12-17T22:08Z,"I hate to break up the bad news but seems that this program can't be cacked on any other windows other than XP and NO I don't know why but I do realize that I tried it on 3 different windows 7 PCs and they all managed to get deactivated or simply cancelled the operation where as when I tried it on 2 of my old XP running machines it actually worked, now I don't know why is it that this happens but am pretty sure everyone with windows 7 won't be able to work it out, I would recommend Advanced System Optimizer as an alternative, doesn't work as good but Its pretty good too.
This was not a complain at all because I honestly appreciate the effort of the cracker but I'd recommend anyone with windows 7 the effort of trying to install and run this..."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-12-19T03:00Z,"@MedoAlmasry 

Yeah, computers are mysterious, and what works on one system sometimes doesn't work  on the exact same other system .........."
,Sn2,2010-12-19T11:06Z,"hmm.. does it only occurred on W7 or vista aswell? cos im currently running vista and experiencing the issue as everyone else does.

Btw, is there a Cracked version instead of using the activator? "
,warrior1988,2011-01-06T01:58Z,"For users having the cancelled the operation error just run the Activator in windows xp sp3 compatibility mode simply right click and go to properties click the compatibility tab and check the box run this program in compatibility mode then pick windows xp sp3

BTW RobbingHood I trust all your torrents and they all work. I havent found a torrent from you that hasnt work."
,harry_snake,2011-01-06T22:04Z,Ya same here... works at first but get deactivated in win7 automatically and wont run smhow
,akhnaten,2011-01-09T19:02Z,"Detailed instructions and everything worked initially for Windows 7.  I blocked everything from Iolo.  However, when opening the program again it said that the serial was deactivated.  Yes, I rick-clicked and made it compatible for Windows XP on every thing I used.  Bah! I wish this would work but thanks RobbingHood for putting this up here.  I know it took some time."
,husseinasfour,2011-01-10T19:47Z,hei ok i go through all the steps and then wen i get to the acivator it doesnt let me access the 3 boxes to check and activate. i have windows vista wat am i doing wrong? i need help plz ny one.?
,Nei1,2011-01-20T06:59Z,"Another option is Glary Utilities.  Free from their website.  Includes registry defragmenter, registry cleaner, junk cleaner, windows startup manager, shortcuts cleaner, temp files cleaner, history eraser, spyware remover, uninstaller, silly memory optimizer, context menu manager, file shredder, undeleter, file encrypter and decrypter, disk [usage] analysis, dupe file finder, empty folder finder, file splitter/joiner, and a little more.

Eusing Registry Cleaner is also free, has a couple more functions than Glary's reg cleaner. Interstingly, Eusing's reg cleaner looks almost identical to Glary's.

(Reg Cleaner and Reg Defragmenter are two different things.  And apparently, drive defragmenting doesn't defrag the registry, so you need a different utility for each three functions.)

New updates, perhaps every month or so.  Nothing that runs in the background.

If you use Glary Utilities on a commercial computer, they ask you to please pay.

Found out about Glary from my brother.  I'm just a user.  Might get you where you're trying to go."
,pegapalo,2011-02-08T10:57Z,"The only way I see around this so far, is to run the activator in Win XP pack 2 or 3. And just renew the license. I had 20 days left. And when used the activator, happened the same thing. License disable. Just went back to the activator, and erase license information. After that, run again the 30 days trial.. and Puff. back again in 30 days. I will like a good crack on this program. It is a nice program, Thanks Robbinghood for the post. There most be a way to activate from the host file. Or blocked for that matter. If anyone got any ideas please post. This was in win 7 ultimate."
,saikat7,2011-02-12T19:15Z,"Ok, here for who can't figure out how to do it.

1.Disconnect From internet
2. Install System Mechanic as a trial version.
3.Go to Control panel>Administrative Tool>System Configuration>Startup
4.Disable all iolo programs.
5.Restart
6.Now run the activator and click on Patch Online check & in the new window select the 'SysMech.exe'
7.Now click 'Reset License Information' & 'Subscribe Offline For 1 Month'
8.Enter the generated serial.
9.Use a customisable firewall like Comodo Internet Security to block all attempts to internet.
10.Recheck all items disabled at startup.

**Norton & Kaspersky firewall can not block System Mechanic as it is on their White list. I prefer using Bitdefender Internet Security. RobbimgHood Has a great Bitdefender torrent."
,MonkeyOnKeyboard,2011-03-03T02:32Z,For some reason the activator is refusing to download for me. I have downloaded the torrent twice extracted the files multiple time and even tried the back up but the activation is still not appearing. I can view it in the archive of the back up but when I try to copy it over into the folder I get an error stating how it cannot be found. Can some one help me?
[V],RobbingHood,2011-03-05T12:49Z,"@MonkeyOnKeyboard

Exclude the folder in which the download is stored through your av scanner. Or just temporarily disable your av scanner. When using cracks you'll need to do that.

It's also described in the install notes and info."
,KanameKuranTB,2011-04-04T13:12Z,"Thanks for the great torrent RH works great, I just have a little problem. Every time I try to use either the Program Accelerator or the Drive Accelerator the process stops before it starts... It just says ""Optimization not started"" can you please help me with this?"
,robertc2,2011-04-18T18:18Z,"DANGER!  This download contains Obfuscator virus, MSE describes it as SEVERE!"
,babuuu,2011-04-22T20:53Z,"Hey there is a problem, I installed it as directed, but the System Mechanics shuts down automatically in every 2-3 minutes!!!!!! have to restart it again and again. Well we all have to admit it is one of the toughest program to crack. Well do u have any solution for it????"
,dujma1911,2011-05-10T21:26Z,"THANK YOU RobbingHood for this upload,it works great for me."
,mathiaspereira,2011-06-06T00:14Z,"I recommend to use the keygen included only has a ""trial resetter"". Iolo is blocking keys generated from the keygen. Just reset the license information with this keygen.

Your anti-virus has found a virus on it? Use the keygen, and, after this, put on you quarantine. If this really have a virus, it don't will be active on the quarantine."

,NilDeperandum,2011-07-22T09:40Z,Works Great! Thanks RH! Follow saikat7's directions

,Zeptinune,2011-10-15T00:43Z,"Followed saikat7's instructions to the letter. Seems to work ok though even with EVERYTHING blocked System Mechanic managed to find updates though I said don't install and blocked everything. Seriously one of the most annoying programs, if not THE MOST annoying program to crack ever.

Thanks for the upload. Seems to be working ok. Though it has FC'd (force closed) once after scanning quickly for problems. Restarting the app gave me the results so yeah.

Fuck this program is as annoying as it is helpful."
,Zeptinune,2011-10-15T00:44Z,Fuck sake it just force closed again.. fucking thing. I think I'm going to have to do an uninstall...
,Zeptinune,2011-10-15T00:45Z,"Yeah fuck it. This thing is a piece of shit and just force closes in the middle of using. It obviously has detected that it's been cracked or that updates are blocked.

No one will ever successfully crack this program. I remember back in the day version 6 would actually shut your computer down if you cracked the program.

iOLO is just too smart guys... looks like I'm going to use another program."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-10-27T04:28Z,"@Zeptinune

Actually this activator is working since 2009 or so, since iolo did not change the activation for SysMech. 

Sys Mech has always been cracked like most other softwhere, but feel free to believe your own fairy tales.

As long as the install instuctions are followed this works perfectly."
,victoriajordash,2011-11-21T13:07Z,"works perfect as of 11/21/11

follow directions and block block block

thanks this is great"
,badger420,2011-11-26T07:58Z,Works!! Win 7 x64 no problems as long as you follow the directions it works great. You must restart the computer then shutdown the process for the program before it will work successfully. Down side is the the program stopped working when it was doing the repairs so i don't know what that was about...
,matrix18,2012-01-04T20:56Z,"This works.

I disabled avast (avast removes the contents of files) and unplugged internet. 

Follow instructions and succsess :)

I'm Seeding this great program forever."

,sommmen,2012-03-23T08:59Z,"seems to look perfectly fine.
im downloading it as of now, but tere aren't enough seeders to complete the download (i think, bittorrent keeps saying it)"
,ganja_mada,2012-04-25T16:00Z,"I downloaded SMP this morning and installed it.(i have a vayo, running on vista 32).
The installation went fine, i disabled the anti-virus first, then followed the instructions.
Was able to use SMP once, all was fine. But later in the day , it somehow found a way to connect to the net, and disabled all keys. So i guess we need to find a way to block the access to internet , else it will keep checking and will know that its a pirated version. Will drop a post if i find a way to do so,... i remember doing some stuff which blocked the internet access to adobe acrobat pro... need something similar here"
,Emvy,2012-05-15T19:11Z,"I have a problem with the activator.. I can't click the three options on the already installed tab.. as well as ""select target component""
the only thing i could click is ""about""
could somebody help me?"
,Bunny40,2012-05-22T04:32Z,"I noticed that Windows Update leaves the Internet connection live when configurating at shut down. This means that if Windows has closed firewalls and AV's then this leaves the PC vulnerable. But, I did upgrade Comodo Firewall and it is now allowing connections from certain programs without prompting for action. I did save a config and reloaded. Plus, when I copied an installation from another PC (C:/Program (x86)/iolo and when SM acts up, I just copy it across and it goes back to normal.. in short, turn off Internet before Windows Update restarts the PC."
,Bunny40,2012-05-22T05:04Z,"I noticed that SM Updater window has been popping up no matter what I block in Comodo FW. However, when I disable AVAST WEB SHEILD.. I do not get the notice. No idea why :/"
