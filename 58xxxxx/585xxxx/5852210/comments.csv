[V],globeplus,2010-09-25T18:54Z,"To darkpat : another thing you can try is to make a right click mouse on the executable and go to the properties then tab the compatibility and put on to execute in 640x480 and deactivate svreen dimensions with high PPP , maybe with this 2 definitions the video card donÂ´t find any problem to start the game then inside the game go to the options\pc settings and choose the resolution you want , i know a program that can be downloaded for free called vidres and the user can even select wich program run to a designated resolution but sometimes can not recognise executables ut you can make a try too :

No, its the ""old"" Problem, i can start the game, but there is only sound and the ""input not supportet"" message, so i need to change it Off agme, its PRE Setted and i have to change it in any file or folder.

So, hmm, hard job this time, maybe you can find out whats the Problem and where I can change.
OR : I have to click it blind to the options menue in game, i look at youtube if there is a gameplay with Intro..."
[V],globeplus,2010-09-25T19:47Z,"To darkpat : try my before suggestions about the properties on the executable and the VIDres program , maybe can work , meanwhile i´ll see if i find something else DO IT !!!"
,darkpat,2010-09-25T20:13Z,"Hi Globe, 
I tried what you said before, changed the propertys of the exe, but that did not work.

[V],globeplus,2010-09-25T20:45Z,"To darkpat : after lot and lot of research igot the solution that will work and tested with darksiders to use the game in windowed mode and from there do wherever you want , i think with this you can be without your problem forever no matter is the game , in darksiders work for shore , i tested , i hope your video card react correctly to the resolution change and if that happen youÂ´re ok probabbly forever about this small probelm that you have running the games , use this link and read the README.txt inside the program folder then use it on the Darksiders executable after browsing him , ok enough talk , here is the link (257 kb):

[V],globeplus,2010-09-25T20:51Z,"To darkpat :  just for saying that with me the program worked 100% ok on the Darksiders executable no doubt , it is just really a matter to see how your video card accept the change of the resolution and resolution mode style . GOOD LUCK but say something after use it , i want to know if you got success or not  ."
[V],globeplus,2010-09-25T21:06Z,"To darkpat . i tried with a little redidinition of the secreen resolution on the program and it worked for DEAD RISING 2 also , just the cursor can got hided but the cursor keys work just fine , this for dead rising 2 , in darksiders just no problem fully working ."
,dbzgt4,2010-09-25T21:14Z,globe man please seed
,darkpat,2010-09-25T21:39Z,"Hi Globe,
IT WORKED!!! i can get the game to start in a windowed mode now, but i cant change it to fullscreen, I cant set the resolution in game to nothing ecept the setted, its 1280x720. But i dont care, i can play in windowed mode too, that doesnt matter.
If you know what i can set in that little program you sended me, to make the ""window"" a little bit bigger, then write me.(in the fields were 0 (zero) is set) y=0 x=0
thats the settings now, that makes me a little bit more than half screen window)
THANKS a lot Globe for your interest in my prob, your great Upload, and all the help you give.
Pat"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-25T22:14Z,"To darkpat : the values you ask i don´t know exactly but i know a little trick , after you get the windowed mode running click in the windows key of the computer and get the cursor outside the window of the game then maximize the window in the top right corner of the window and will get the game in all screen beside the fact that still in the windowed mode , tell me if it worked for you this little trick ."
,gooby149,2010-09-26T05:08Z,im not getting good speed at all :(
,darkpat,2010-09-26T08:13Z,"Good morning Globe,
I tried what you said yesterday but if i maximise the Window, the mouse cursor doesnt ""fit"" anymore. I Means, the cursor is not where it should be. There is something like ""autocorrect mouse cursor""  but that did not work.
So i realy dont care that much, I can play now, and thats it. Thank you so much globe .
Next thing i`ll try is this release from you (Dead rising 2) and I ll tell you how it will work when i am finished downloading.

[V],globeplus,2010-09-26T08:49Z,"To all the possible users : the indicators of the torrents for the moment still not working , sometimes circunstancial bugs can cause anomalies retrieving the update data , this is an unsual thing but can happen at this i am not used to see this inconvenience all the time , so in this perspective it is just for saying that the normal progress of the torrent keep going and the interested possible users of the file can make the download with normality , the present indication 08h00m (GMT) 26/09 that i have is the next : Seeds - 48 / Peers - 270 . This is a type of circunstancial errors that sometimes can happen on the torrents . Thank you and get your file ..."
[V],globeplus,2010-09-26T10:07Z,"To darkpat : in Dead Rising it will be ok with the main executable too , i already tested but with the little inconvenience that you said with the mouse cursor hide , what you are missing is the next thing : THE CURSOR KEYS WORK PERFECTLY EVEN WITH THE MOUSE CURSOR HIDED , SO NOBODY DIES and this the principal motive that some games donÂ´t have a windowed option on the game because they want the cursor free to the users use around , some games the interaction with the window mode fgor the resolutions are perfect and then doesnÂ´t matter if the user use the window mode that the cursor still ok , some other times , some resolutions can get affected and then outside the full screen if the window is open the mouse cursor is in there but hided like a glitch but even if this happen still true that you get 100% funcional the cursor keys , so what i mean darkpat is that sometimes we have to accept a circunstancial fact in this case that some games because certain resolutions if the game goes to a window mode can get the cursor hided like a glitch but really just that , now i ask to you what you prefere , small window with the cursor or the full screen in a window without the cursor visible but the cursor keys working perfectly ? the fact of having the full screen donÂ´t compensate the hiding of the cursor ? now you understand why not all the games have the window mode option , sometimes the cursor get affected by the window and that can be areason for the window mode option not be available at some particular game . Ok enough talk , you know your options now : full screen with the cursor hided or window mode with cursor it is up to you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-09-26T10:18Z,"To darkpat : just to complement my before comment remember that the cursor is only visible to use on the menus and 90% of the time you are playing and in there don´t make any difference the cursor , so deciding for full screen with the mouse cursor hided is not a bad option too but still up to you the choice ."
[V],globeplus,2010-09-26T10:24Z,"To darkpat : i donnÂ´t want to be borring you but afetr write the before comment i get the perfect idea that you are always great , you only need a little work that doesnÂ´t matter : start in the normal window with the cursor then when you start really playig get the cursor out and change to the full screen in window and when you are playing is in full screen , when you want to return to themenu get the cursor out again and minimize to the normal window , with this little work you have the cursor on the menus and full screen when you are playing ."

For example no footsteps and shit?"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-26T11:16Z,"To maxovitj : the executable works fine but sometimes we can get little inconveniences on the general gameplay , what i got for this game was : low sound in a few videos and possible troubleshooting for the controllers , the other possible little things that canÂ´t look totally ok can happen but the original was like that , that happens not because of the work , now i ask to you guys if any of you simply donÂ´t make the work justbecause futil things like this , i mean for example that this one comparing to the big trouble and fixes Left 4 Dead 2 woth lot of fixes and possible inconveniences this one is a walk in the park comparing to that one , maybe next time i think like this : WHAT ? the original have videos without sound or very low ? forget about upload this one , then WHAT ? the controllers have the possibility to not work well ? jesus , it is better forget the work immediatly and so on and so on ."

To Mike PS : excuse me and i donÂ´t intend to offend you but your translator sucks , do the next thing : check translators on the net in places where you can put some number of words at least andget the translation immediatly , all of us knows that on the translations are always afew percent of words of context of the phrases that canÂ´t too much sense , so what you have to do is find more services for translations as possible and write always the same phrase in all the services then compare the incoming translations to se what is the services that less mistakes do on the translations . cheers and have fun on that . thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-09-26T13:58Z,"To MikePS : i sid in the before comment that your translator and get a better one and i explained a way for you to test more available translators as possible on the net because what you wrote in your comment soimply donÂ´t make any sense the context of the words , even if i make an effort to try to get the point about what you are saying i canÂ´t get it anyway  , so do my suggestion and give a walk on the net in translators services and the ones that do a better russian to engllish translation ."

here I am with the next Problem. When I try to start the Dead Rising 2 exe, i get the message. Applicatiion cant get started because it cant find the MSVCR100.dll.
New installation could solve this Problem.
What can I do? I installed It two times now, and the other People dont seem to have the same prob. Any Idea Globe?"

[V],globeplus,2010-09-27T11:39Z,"To MikePS : my generic basic compression is the maded with FREEARC (freeware) with the 1GB ram option , the freearc can give a little more improve with the 2  GB ram extarction but if i use that one the users in 2 GB ram computers that normally are ok to play any game can get problems with the extarction , the games normally too need 1gb ram to xp and 1.5gb or 2 gb for vista or 7 , so choosing the 1 gb ram option to make the compression i think it is absolutly appropriate to the compression work , for the compression this is ok but i remember that is all work preparation in more sections inside the game as possible before going to the compression itself , the compression  i repeat is absolutly the last thing to do with the game file . i hope now you be clarified with this comment about the compression work , i donÂ´t use the 7zip because the freearc gives generically a little bit more compression beside i have to recognise that needs more ram to make the extraction , for the same compression the arc file needs 1 gb ram with the option i choose , nice compression and making sense to the generic possible users under the requirements of the game and the same compression with 7zip needs close 384 mb ram , so with freearc you probably improve a few percent , not too much the compression but with 7zip you need less ram to make the extraction ."

this is the solution for your problem
Method 1: Using the console registry tool

Click Start, Run and type this command exactly as given below: (better - Copy and paste)

REG add HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System /v DisableCMD /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f


Method 2: Edit the registry directly

Open Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and navigate to:

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System]

In the right-pane, double-click DisableCMD and set it's data to 0


Method 3: Using Group Policy Editor in Windows XP Professional.

Click Start, Run, type gpedit.msc and click OK.

Navigate to User Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ System

Double-click the Prevent access to the command prompt



After that follow globe's intruction's he's the best!!"
