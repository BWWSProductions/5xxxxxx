* The player controls protagonist Chuck Greene as he fights off hordes of zombies while accomplishing specific missions. The game will include several new objects that can be used to attack the zombies. Over 7,000 zombies can be seen onscreen at any one time.Dead Rising 2 allows players to manufacture their own custom weapons at various points in the game. The player will also be able to purchase cards that will reveal item combinations that could prove deadly after being built. Such combinations include the "Hail Mary," a hand grenade duct taped to a football, "Dynameat," a stick of dynamite duct taped to a piece of meat, the "Paddlesaw," two chainsaws duct taped to a kayak paddle, and "Freedom bear," which is a giant stuffed bear with a Rambo-style headband and a machine gun that acts as a sentry.It has also been confirmed that "Infinity Mode" from Dead Rising has been removed from Dead Rising 2. Many hardcore fans of the game are very disappointed by this development .
