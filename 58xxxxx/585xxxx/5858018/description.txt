Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible

On with the game release information:

In the year 2171, the world is a changed place. The countries
have merged into massive rival super nations called USN and
OCU. The human race started a massive push into space by
building orbital elevators to set up surveillance satellites
to watch over their adversaries. However, tension rises when
one of the USN's elevators being built is destroyed by unknown
forces. Dylan Ramsey, a young engineer, finds himself quickly
caught in a swirl of destruction, conspiracies and crumbling
alliances in a new war brewing between the OCU and the USN
