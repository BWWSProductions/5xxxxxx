,dabeerz,2010-10-08T19:04Z,"I don't know about you guys, but this game runs perfectly for me. Maybe you guys didn't run the two .exe files in the ""run me 1st"" folder. The only question I have is ""is there a way to play multiplayer on this repacked version or do I have to shell out the money for a legal copy?"""
,dabeerz,2010-10-08T19:10Z,"woah, where'd my comment go o.o? Sorry, I'm new at this, so if I accidentally have a double post please forgive me. Anyways, this game runs perfectly for me, so maybe you guys messed something up like not running the two .exe files in the ""run me 1st"" folder. All I want to know is can I play multiplayer on this repack or do I have to shell out the money for the legal copy?"
,libbbio,2010-10-09T00:04Z,"some 1 can help me pls? multiplayer dont work!!

tnxs pls help me"
,paper_tigers,2010-11-29T19:42Z,"the game works well, i think any issues i have are hardware related, the black screen issue looked like it was going to be the case but i just let it sit for a minute or so and then it loaded up just fine. ill shell the cash for the legit copy in a week or so, the game looks worth while and i loved the other ones.

thanks Hero!
