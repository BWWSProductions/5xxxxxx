[T],DjAligator14,2010-09-25T12:06Z,"I use nod32 and didn't detect any viruses. 
Of course some anti-viruses will detect some files to be viruses to delete them and to not play the game because those files are illegal. All what you have to do is to stop your anti-virus from scan that file(s). If it doesn't have this option all i can recommend is disable the anti-virus or install other one."

It took 10 minutes to try and install, but then NIS 2011 found an infoseeker.gampass trogen hidden in the install.exe. Was found by SONAR. Will wait for a scene release unless someone can confirm this is a false positive."
,lucasla,2010-09-27T20:38Z,It's possible to play this version online with Hamachi?
,piledrivermaker,2010-10-01T05:02Z,"Installed it, tested it and worked fine!

It's just mine or the flow of the game is weird even in the lowest settings?

Thanks!"
