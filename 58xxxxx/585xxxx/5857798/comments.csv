,komod,2010-09-30T22:12Z,This is a port version right? Not the native version for Mac OSX?
,acorn2oaks,2010-10-01T18:13Z,"Excuse my ignorance komod, but what does that mean?  'port version'"
,kludge420,2010-10-01T21:34Z,"Acorn2Oaks: A port is a PC game using a wrapper library that maps the Windows APIs to Mac OS X APIs. Google Cider, CXZ, Wine, and Crossover and that'll give you a start to understanding game ports.

It should be noted that while ports sometimes ""work"" they still have all sorts of problems from graphic corruption to random crashes. 

In other words ports are a waste of time, they're total crap, and should never be used. You're MUCH better off using a virtual machine or boot camp."
,acorn2oaks,2010-10-01T23:17Z,Many thanks Kludge420 for the info and advice.  That does make some sense.  Having recently stumbled into the word of torrents I am on a very steep learning curve and find it fascinating.
,koesherbacon,2010-10-02T06:45Z,"Yeah, if you look at their link, it says it's a port."

,mycophage,2010-10-08T19:43Z,"It's loading up fine for me, though the first startup took a really long time. 

I ran the first tutorial (movement), and it worked fine. During the second tutorial (building cities) it crashed for no apparent reason - the app never showed up as ""not responding"" but the controls became unresponsive, and I had to quit. Haven't reproduced this behavior but I wanted to mention it in case others ran into similar issues.

My configuration: 
- MacBook Pro
- 2.6 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo

Ladies and gentlemen, this port does not work with 10.5 (there's a bug in the graphics driver and Apple don't upgrade drivers for 10.5 anymore :( ). Either upgrade to 10.6, or forget about it."

,FA1982,2010-12-21T17:45Z,"Hola a todos,

Lo siento por mi mal ingles. El juego funciona perfectamente en un IMac. Se ve perfectamente con la resoluciÃ³n mas alta. 

No he necesitado instalar Steam. He montado la imagen CivilizationV.dmg y al ejecutar ha hecho una copia en mis aplicaciones y lo he empezado a jugar perfectamente.

pd:Tengo capada la salida a la red a CivV

Â¿Mi pregunta es?

Â¿Como puedo actualizar a la ultima versiÃ³n el juego? Â¿Es posible? Como puedo extraer pluggins de mapas de steam como el mediterraneo o las civilizaciones Incas y EspaÃ±olas para subir el torrent?

Un saludo

-------------------------

Hi everyone,

Sorry for my bad English. The game works fine on an iMac. It looks perfect with the highest resolution.

I did not need to install Steam. I mounted the image CivilizationV.dmg and has run a copy of my application and I started to play well.

pd: I have closed the exit to the network CivV

My question is?

How I can upgrade to the latest version of the game? Is it possible? As I can draw maps pluggins steam as the Mediterranean or Spanish and Inca civilizations to upload the torrent?

Greetings"

Same problem. I can see the Strategic map. But the normal one is just grey, but the icons of the stuff are there.

Please help!"

,highfye,2011-03-20T19:03Z,"What a great game, but it crashes whenever I meet the US, Russian or German leaders for the first time. The screen freezes up completely, sometimes goes grey. I can hear the dialog behind the frozen screen but that's it, then I have to quit and restart. Apparently this has been addressed in the latest patch, which requires STEAM to download."
,Oktopuz,2011-03-27T17:08Z,"For those who get the gray game area, I found a solution!! Once you've started the Civ5, go to Options>Video>Fullscreen>Apply Resolution. Changing that seems to get rid of the bug and u can play without problems until you quit the app. You'll have to do that every time you start the game but it's an easy fix. *I dont have any other issues with the game btw. Works great ;)"

,Wildman496,2011-08-13T15:53Z,"It worked fine aside from rather insane loading times(I'm unable to skip the start movie either) that I'm not sure were in the original CD until around 1300-1500 AD in every campaign(I tried 3 times with 3 different maps). Once I've conquered a large portion of the players, so around 1300, the game randomly freezes completely and, as it's a full screen game, the only option is to hold the power button until your computer shuts off. This then happened around every 2 turns."
