,sergdaof,2010-09-25T15:05Z,"Worked for me, thanks a lot! The game is beautiful!"
,rurik1967,2010-09-25T15:17Z,"If someoen could leave feedback, would be great, as I said, this worked flawless for me, with all the trouble I had with the smaller crack file sizes on here."
[V],Mbb15,2010-09-25T16:06Z,"please stop advertising your torrents on my torrent, other you know what will happen"
[V],Mbb15,2010-09-25T16:08Z,"and btw did you really thought there was a virus in it and it was smaller?

when there was a virus why would they give me the vip status then?
Its smaller because it was rar'ed

stop doing this and learn how it works, rookie"
,we-need-seeds,2010-09-25T17:02Z,i dont understand how to apply this crack i know to put it in the install directory but i cant install it without a key so im confused 
,Balzard,2010-09-25T19:46Z,"@we-need-seeds : If you downloaded an uncracked/unpatched .iso that contained a Steam Setup .exe (asks for an activation code) as well as a .sim and .sid files, you need to use Phoenix SID Unpacker (Google - latest is beta 1.4), update it, and extract the contents of the files. Then, replace those files by the ones contained in the crack."
,rurik1967,2010-09-26T01:16Z,"@Mbb15 well excuse me for trying to help someone, theres a ton of people with problems of the cracks listed and this one worked flawlessly for me. Without the need of mesing with your AntiVirus settings to ignore certain files, plus the fact IT 28 meg version DIDNT WORK for me on 3 computers spending over 3hours of messing with differant settings. Rookie? ya ok im 43 yr old, have a 4 yr degree in computer electronics, and my computer experance goes all the way back to 1980 when I bought Sinclare 1000 1k ram personal computer you hooked up to a televistion (this was 1-2 years before the comadore Vic-20 and atari 400.

I realize you got a little green pirate symbol, but all I was trying to do is help some people who have had nothing but problems with the cracks that were curently availible, IE ActicOne's with over 1400 coments and still growing.

Next time I will keep my findings to myself and not say a word."
,tonton zola,2010-09-26T03:38Z,"mbb15, would you stop acting like you're pre-K? people can and in fact do have problems with torrents when thousands run the same thing flawlessly. So give it a rest.

rurik1967, your efforts are appreciated, thank you. Giving back to the community is how communities stay alive."
[V],Mbb15,2010-09-26T16:19Z,"its ok the upload torrents and always welcome to new users, but don't give false warnings about virusses, because I never uploaded a virus and its just a false-positive, gj"
[V],Mbb15,2010-09-26T16:27Z,"Lets just say this,

I dont care if you are advertising on my torrents
I do care if you give false information"
,rurik1967,2010-09-26T17:23Z,"@Mbb15 I guess i wasnt clear enough about saying the 3 filles came up with trojan virus, I should have been more clear it DIDNT have a virus, it just came up with nortons it did, as with most keygen makers or crack exe files. I ment it was anoying having to disable to copy files is all, not sure why those 3 had problems, and the 3 in this other release didnt.

Was just trying to help those who like myself, the 28meg file crack wasnt working and this other one i found worked flawless for me, was jsut hoping it would solve problem for those who couldnt get the other one to work is all.

peace out."
[V],Mbb15,2010-09-26T17:43Z,ok peace hehe
