Ruby Isle's long-in-the-works-cover-to-cover tribute to Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction. Entitled "Appetite for Destruction", it is a complete reworking of the GNR classic with electropop production. It combines the best of the 80s with the, um... best of the 80s? By the way, this isn't a joke, just look at the awesome cover designed by Chris Bilheimer!
