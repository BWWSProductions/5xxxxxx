Great find, Bitstreeem!  Thank you!"

This is cool beyond words!

Thanks for the up."

Gripe aside, this is a decent adaptation and infinitely better than the total mess John Hurt got involved with."
[T],bitstreeem,2010-09-25T19:46Z,"Hey, thanks for the comments.  Your right in that this is more faithful to the book, but O'Brien is totally miscast in this.  I have the other version, but it is sooo brooding that it really isn't one of my faves.  I know it's a brooding subject, but it's tough for me to watch it...=)  

In any case thanks again for the comments all and...

Enjoy!"
