Everytime I exit and play it again it says save file damaged."
,arcdavid,2010-10-07T01:27Z,"Thanks a lot for the game!
I have problems though...  I can run every new game I download -> Civ 5, Amnesia, Bioshock 2 (not that new), Mass Effect 2...  But I can't seem to run this game.

I have 
intel 3 gb dual processor
2 gb Ram
797 mb of available (remaining) video memory
Direct X from June 2010 (Dx11)
Newest C++ update (I forget release date)
Windows 7

When I start the game my screen goes black and my resolution changes.  It shows that little loading bar in the bottom right corner and then the program crashes.  Anyone with this problem solve it?

I tried this download and another both with the same result... so it must be my configuration or incompatibility... or maybe incompetence xD "
,arcdavid,2010-10-07T01:30Z,My refresh rate is 60 Hz like lukegoodman2001 suggests

,pimpmobile,2011-01-25T20:55Z,this is a great mech type game if your into mech games and shooters this is the game for you I love this game and anyone who say it sucks can go fuck themselves!
,taelus,2011-04-26T15:13Z,"I'm having the same issue with damaged save games.  Of note, the game also scrambles the controls settings, so I'm guessing this is something they put in to prevent piracy that hasn't been beaten in this crack."
,SirAnthrax,2011-05-04T13:13Z,"Does the multiplayer work? I tried the Multiplayer and it says ""You must be logged in to steam"". Considering the crack folder contains a steamclient.dll and .ini file I was kinda hoping it would work.

I'm trying to LAN it btw, not online!"
,SirTannen,2011-07-02T04:58Z,"@JCK18

Why even bother commenting on the game then?"
,tehovarets2,2011-08-19T18:25Z,"Wired XO controller doesn't work.
