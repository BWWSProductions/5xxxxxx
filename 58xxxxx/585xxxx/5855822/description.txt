This very well produced documentary can only be purchased locally on the Island of Sicily. It has an international selection of languages including Russian, Polish, Dutch, Spanish, Native Italian, Japanese and of course English. An Extra special brings you up to date in pictures and music for the eruptions in 2003 and 2008. The latest eruption on the 28th of August 2010 was missed by me by 12 days when I visited the site.

The Volcano is loved by the people of Sicily and is called a HE, that is Mr Vocano, not the more usual female gender.
