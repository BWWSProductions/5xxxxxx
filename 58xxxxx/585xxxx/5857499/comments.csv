,libbbio,2010-10-01T16:53Z,for me dont work anymore multiplayer....???
,tonton zola,2010-10-01T22:12Z,"This crashes in the first 10 turns in my computer. I didn't have any problems with the arcticone's release but 'upgraded' to Skidrow's just in case.

It turns out that I was wrong, but hey Skidrow is still the best out there."
,Darien7,2010-10-02T06:06Z,"Works well. Thanks skidrow guys, you are my heroes!"
,awbrab,2010-10-02T22:04Z,"Anyone have the same problem as me?
I cannot save a mod single player game but ok to save a normal single player game. Basically I do not have the Save or Load game option in Mod mode which I have in Normal mode

Pls help me, I want to play on the map I created myself"
[V],Mbb15,2010-10-03T11:25Z,dubbie it wont work on windows 95
,Valmarith,2010-10-03T14:47Z,"That sucks, Windows 7 is so expensive"
,mulder00,2010-10-06T19:54Z,Still crashes during opening movies..guess it doesn't work with XP service pack 3
,TheBiggestRickOfAll,2010-10-09T19:39Z,"I find it funny that everyone was dissing arctic the whole few days that torrent was released. What you don't realize is the time and effort it takes to crack a game. Arctic may not have been able to crack it properly, but that does not mean his torrent was a fake. Stop beating the poor guy up. He did good, we just had to wait for a skidrow crack. So you combine the two and guess what? You have a working game. So stop trolling arctic and thank him, then thank skidrow for fixing the small problem."
,heffeque,2010-10-10T18:00Z,"Doesn't work on Windows XP SP3. The demo from Steam worked flawlessly so I guess that it's the crack's fault it isn't working correctly. I see people saying that it works ok on Windows 7, but I don't want to install that bloated OS. I guess I'll wait for a better crack for Civ V because I'm sure not going to spend 50 euros on this game."
,XRA,2010-10-13T15:59Z,Can I use this on ArcticOne's release?
