[T],simmyboy80,2010-10-01T11:59Z,"@NStalken

try using AKAIO loader and ROM should run.

hope this helps"
,KiLLeRSweeT,2010-10-01T23:21Z,Use kernel 1.35 with wood 1.12 and all the games work or add my mail larspetersson30@hotmail.com and ill send you info and the new kernel so all the games work with R4i gold.
,NStalken,2010-10-02T01:04Z,"Thanks Simmy and Killer, but I dont know what any of that means, I just bought the card and downloaded the software :)"
,Herz_F,2010-10-02T07:16Z,"On my m3 DS real (firmware v 4.8 e ) its works, but completly freezes on sea travel screen.
Oh, and if you try to use limit skill 'Cross Slash' it freezes too."
,jeffnet,2010-10-03T16:10Z,"This is the same dump that is available everywhere. It's either bad, or it's got some weird AP stuff on it.

Long story short: Certain skills will crash your game, as will trying to do any of the sea stuff.

Going to have to wait a bit longer for this. Which would be better if it was actually available outside the US."
,jeffnet,2010-10-04T09:26Z,"Turns out it was both a dodgy dump and some protection. Somebody is claiming to have patched it now, but you need the full untrimmed 64MB dump (you can get it on demonoid). The patch itself is easily found."
,Herz_F,2010-10-04T14:39Z,"@jeffnet@ demonoid is closed site, they refuse registration...anyway thnx for info.
Maybe later patched version will appear on PB, i hope :)"
,jeffnet,2010-10-04T19:22Z,Annoyingly the patch is a nonsense. The waiting continues.
,jeffnet,2010-10-04T19:49Z,I tell a lie. I'd just screwed up the patching.
[T],simmyboy80,2010-10-05T10:44Z,"Look people , i dumped this ROm myself and trimmed it , there is absolutley nothing wrong with the dump , the game has AP which your flashcard makers will have to create a fix for , woods firmware will probably do it first and the rest will follow just be patient"
,KiLLeRSweeT,2010-10-05T23:49Z,"People, buy my R4i gold cart with kernel 1.35 with wood 1.12 and i promise it will work, ALL THE GAMES ARE WORKING....ill sell like 50 carts a week and NO ONE is ringing back and says omfg its not working, ITS WORKING PEOPLE"
,KiLLeRSweeT,2010-10-05T23:50Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5845568/Trackmania_Turbo[NDS](simmyboy80) look here just as i told you, look at what we are saying"
,wrtenlegacy,2010-10-07T04:05Z,"Tried this game out on my R4 using the latest Wood 1.13....Everything started up great, ran into a crash though when using the Limit Breaks(what ever they are called).....are there any suggestions or have others come across this?"
