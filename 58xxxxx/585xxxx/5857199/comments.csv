[V],twentyforty,2010-09-28T16:43Z,"5 hours, my friend... on busiest day. It stopped to be glitch like hour ago, now it's more like serious down-time. And I  have six more shows (just waiting on Start button to be pressed)."
,lilars26,2010-09-28T17:12Z,"I thought something was wrong.Yes,that is serious down time."
,nikoHD,2010-09-29T08:02Z,"Hi twentyforty. If you coulld upload a movie called The School of Rock 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332379/ 
Or, Shrek 4
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892791/
Or Tomorrow, When the war began 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1456941/
that would be great. Congrats on the green scull!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-29T11:09Z,"@nikoHD: Unfortunately, upload on TPB is not possible right now. IF and when Hollywood string puppet US senator(s) stop to force blacklisting of domain names of almost all file-sharing sites which have crippled more than 70% of benign Internet traffic, I (same goes for all uploaders) would need some time to catch up with my schedule.
Then - maybe, if, who-knows - I'll try to listen to requests.
FYI, I have old 272p of the school of rock, the war began is not out yet and Shrek 4 TS was done few months ago and one should wait for Xmas time and appearance of DVD or BluRay."
