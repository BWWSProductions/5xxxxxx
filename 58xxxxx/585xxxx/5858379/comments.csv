,LordEvoken,2010-10-01T18:21Z,Nice upload but there is no keygen.
,LordEvoken,2010-10-01T18:29Z,"This torrent didn't have the keygen but I found a working keygen and you can download it from here, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5151827/Sony.Vegas.Pro.9.0-Crack.and.Keygen.Only.

Just replace IHR or whatever with IHF (I think)
"
[V],DeGun,2010-10-01T21:33Z,"Of course there is crack , into the ""crack vegas 9"" Folder, if you can t see it it's probably your AV that blocked it without warning you , try to add the folder/Archive into exclusions list of your AV . 
clean crack so risk free . 
let me guess : your AV is something like AVG ? Avast? 

Otherwise thank you both for comments."
[V],DeGun,2010-10-01T21:35Z,"BTW good link for good keygen , follow same instructions , no mistake and all will be working .
