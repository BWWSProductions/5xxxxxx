A Year Without Rain is the second studio album by American band Selena Gomez & the Scene. The album was released on September 17, 2010. The band once again worked writers and producers from their debut, Kiss & Tell such as Rock Mafia duo Tim James, and Antonina Armato, as well as Fefe Dobson, Toby Gad, and Superspy. New contributions came from Kevin Rudolf, Katy Perry, and RedOne, among others. Whilst making use of the auto-tune effect, A Year Without Rain mainly draws from the genre of dance-pop while incorporating electropop, and containing dancehall and techno, among other influences. According to Gomez, most of the songs on the album are dedicated to the fans, while she wanted content with more melodies and empowering lyrics. Lyrical themes include topics of love, freedom, and the joy of living in the moment.
