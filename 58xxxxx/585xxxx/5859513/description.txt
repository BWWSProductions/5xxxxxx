Searing, bitter fiction based on Roth's first marriage.
Unsparing, ambitious, funny, bitter, obsessive.

Almost nicely tagged and labeled, cover scan included.
 (Note: Chapter 3 is not accurately marked.
 I just guessed at it. Another production FAIL by the
 [not too] Brilliance Audio: always 99 Tracks per CD,
 and they can't consistently make chapater breaks at 
 the start of them. Fail.)

Thanks for sharing & caring.
Cheers, FerraBit

From Wiki:

My Life As a Man is American writer Philip Roth's seventh novel. The 
work is split into two sections: the first section, "Useful Fictions," 
consisting of two short stories about a character named Nathan Zuckerman 
(although this character frequently featured in Roth's later novels, 
scholarship has revealed this not to be the same character), and the 
second section, "My True Story," which takes the form of a first-person 
memoir by Peter Tarnopol, a Jewish writer who authored the two stories 
in the first section.

My Life As a Man is the first of Roth's work that tackles the issue of 
the writer's relationship to his work, a theme he would develop in 
subsequent novels, particularly Operation Shylock. In his autobiography, 
Roth reveals that much of Tarnopol's life is based on his own 
experiences; for example, Roth's destructive marriage to Margaret 
Martinson, which is portrayed through Tarnopol's relationship with the 
character of Maureen.

A fiction-within-a-fiction, a labyrinthine edifice of funny, mournful, 
and harrowing meditations on the fatal impasse between a man and a 
woman, My Life as a Man is Roth's most blistering novel. At its heart 
lies the marriage of Peter and Maureen Tarnopol, a gifted young writer 
and the woman who wants to be his muse but who instead is his nemesis. 
Their union is based on fraud and shored up by moral blackmail, but it 
is so perversely durable that, long after Maureen's death, Peter is 
still tryingâ€” and failingâ€” to write his way free of it. Out of desperate 
inventions and cauterizing truths, acts of weakness, tenderheartedness, 
and shocking cruelty, Philip Roth creates a work worthy of Strindbergâ€” a 
fierce tragedy of sexual need and blindness.
