New.World.Order.2009.DVDRip.XviD-ViSiON

New World Order is a 2009 American documentary film directed by Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel. It explores activists who are committed to vigorously opposing what they perceive to be an emerging "New World Order".

The film concentrates on the activities of Alex Jones, Jim Tucker, Jack McLamb, Luke Rudkowski, and TimuÃ§in Leflef, with particular focus on their efforts to expose the highly secretive meetings of the Bilderberg Group, promote the 9/11 Truth Movement, and oppose the erosion of traditional American, Constitutionally-based civil and political rights and liberties.

In an interview with Oxford Film Freak, Luke Meyer said he and partner Andrew Neel decided to make the documentary because, "I have always been interested in people who refuse to accept the standard belief systems, who do what they want or what they feel they have to regardless of what other people think." Neel added, "I thought conspiracy theorists were interesting because they see the world in a very different way... I wanted to know what it was like to be one of them."[1]

The film contains archival footage of then-President George W. Bush, then-Senator (now Vice President) Joe Biden, Senator John McCain, and former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. It also includes appearances by Jim Marrs and Geraldo Rivera.

The film premiered at South by Southwest on March 13, 2009, and Independent Film Channel began broadcasting it on April 16.
