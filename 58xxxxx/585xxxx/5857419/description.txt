Jerry & Esther Hicks 
http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/index.php

For over 20 years Esther & Jerry Hicks have published hundreds of books, audio recordings and videos, and have conducted up to 60 workshops a year. Their work is derived from the teachings of "Non-Physical Source Energy" whom they refer to as "Abraham".

The Teachings of Abraham are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience.

"The thrill of the ride is carved out of the contrast. Without the contrast, you could not decide."

Answers and inspiration from the Non-Physical entity Abraham â€” whom Esther calls "infinite intelligence" and Jerry refers to as "the purest form of love I've ever encountered."

"Whenever you attend an Abraham-Hicks seminar, the first thing you'll notice that sets them apart from all others is that the seminars are interactive on many levels. The agenda is never pre-determined, but is spontaneously created by Abraham's response to the participants in the workshop. It is uncanny how Abraham is aware of not only the consensus of questions in the audience, but every individual question that arises in the room as the seminar progresses."


Thank you to all who participated to make this possible!
