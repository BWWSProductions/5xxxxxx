,t3chyo,2010-09-28T00:22Z,"Thank you!  Also big thanks to skidrow for doing the hardest work!

I already had his upload downloaded but I couldn't figure out that dam msvcr100.dll deal.  

I'm using windows 7 64bit and I put it in the system32 folder and still didnt work...

BUT you mention to put it in the windows/system folder as well so I'll see how that goes!

Thanks for providing that info and saving me some stress ;)"

one last thing, do yourself & us a favor, put the crack pipe down dude, the read me file i was kind enough to paste in the description, what you see above is what it says in the DeadRising2.dat file + has my yt url

Dead Rising 2 (c) Capcom

DRM: Microsoft SSA and ZDPP

This image contains original Dead Rising 2 installation files.

Install Notes:

1. Mount or burn.
2. Install, use any serial e.g. 00000-00000-00000-00000-00000.

(Vista users: if asked to restart after install, say yes, restart before you crack).
3. Copy the content from the CRACK folder  to your
installation directory and overwrite.
 (C:\Program Files\Capcom\Dead Rising 2).

VERY IMPORTANT SO YOU DONT BITCH THAT IT DONT WORK

4.Copy the msvcr100.dll file inside the msvcr100 folder(or google it and download it) and paste to:

Vista                 C:\Windows\System32
Windows 7 64 bit      C:\Windows\System32 & C:\Windows\System

5. Play the game

I tested this on both Vista Ultimate 32bit & Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit.
When I copied the dll file to C:\Windows\System32 on windows 7, nothing, so I copied it to C:\Windows\System as well(leaving the 1 in C:\Windows\System32 & BANG! zombie time).

[T],GWpirateGW,2010-09-28T10:06Z,"@t3chyo

despite you being a prick in your comments I found your fix,

 the problem is the sampling frequency of the sound card, Put it to 48000Hz and should have no issues, no problems (you had it to 96? yes)

so your welcome & be sure to tell ppl how I am the worst uploader who has a trust skull only to upload broken files and doesnt comment back, as he is playing Dead Rising 2, and is too busy to help the leechers who rarely ever return the 1:1 ratio, let alone say thanks."

I have helped walk 3 people through and remote installed it for 5 others via Team Viewer. I also have a video install tutorial. For people with the binkw32.dll  error. here is how I fixed the issue for a person a day ago.

1. uninstall the game.
2. download C Cleaner & clean the registry.
3. download binkw32.dll  from a dll site(google it or message me for a link) and paste that to your c:system or c:system 32 folder(id have to relook, slightly hung over atm) then reinstall the game and copy the crack. That should fix the issue

for laggers, set all settings to low. 

for game saves, sadly same as the binkw32.dll  error people, uninstall, clean registry and reinstall

now only if tpb fixes this format cause i can not edit my description, only post comments=/"

,jvezirian,2011-05-24T00:35Z,"This game makes no sense. I have installed it per the instructions, and will not run. I checked specs on Can You Run It and it tell me need ATI Radeon 3850 HD or better. I have a Radeon 4200 HD, and I have checke the specs and have read that the 4200 is above the 3850, so WTF. On top of that I run much mor extensive games as this one.

Anyone out there have any ideas?

2. right click the device you are using.
3. properties
