From BrillianceAudio.com:

"With the lover everyday life recedes," Roth writes â€” and exhibiting all his 
skill as a brilliant observer of human passion, he presents in Deception the 
tightly enclosed world of adulterous intimacy with a directness that has no 
equal in American fiction. At the center of Deception are two adulterers in 
their hiding place. He is a middle-aged American writer named Philip, living in 
London, and she is an articulate, intelligent, well-educated Englishwoman 
compromised by a humiliating marriage to which, in her thirties, she is already 
nervously half-resigned. The action consists of conversation â€” mainly the 
lovers talking to each other before and after making love. That dialogue â€” 
sharp, rich, playful, inquiring, "moving,â€ as Hermione Lee writes, "on a scale 
of pain from furious bafflement to stoic gaiety" â€” is nearly all there is to 
this audiobook, and all there needs to be. 

"A fiendishly clever piece of work... an amazing feat... Heâ€™s invented the 
purest speech, the most convincing cadences, of any American novelist." â€” 
William Pritchard, Hudson Review

From Wiki:

Deception is a 1990 novel by Philip Roth. This book marks the first time Roth 
uses his own name as the name of the main protagonist within a fictional work 
(he had previously used himself as a main character in a work of non-fiction - 
The Facts: A Novelist's Autobiography). At the center of the book are 
conversations between a married American named Philip, living in London, and a 
married Englishwomanâ€”trapped with a little child in a loveless 
upper-middle-class household. The lives of both characters are gradually 
revealed as they talk before and after making love.
