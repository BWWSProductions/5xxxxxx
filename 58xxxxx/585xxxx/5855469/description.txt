From RecordedBooks.com:

Philip Roth is the most decorated American writer of his generation. In 
Exit Ghost, this master author crafts what may be the final chapter in 
the story of his beloved hero Nathan Zuckerman. After 11 years of 
isolation in his New England mountain refuge, Zuckerman returns to New 
York City and makes three important connections that threaten his 
carefully protected sense of isolation.


Amazon.com Review

The last ordeal of Nathan Zuckerman, the indomitable literary adventurer 
of Roth\'s nine Zuckerman books, like Rip Van Winkle returning to his 
hometown to find that all has changed, Nathan Zuckerman comes back to 
New York, the city he left eleven years before. Alone on his New England 
mountain, Zuckerman has been nothing but a writer: no voices, no media, 
no terrorist threats, no women, no news, no tasks other than his work 
and the enduring of old age.

Walking the streets like a revenant, he quickly makes three connections 
that explode his carefully protected solitude. One is with a young 
couple with whom, in a rash moment, he offers to swap homes. They will 
flee post-9/11 Manhattan for his country refuge, and he will return to 
city life. But from the time he meets them, Zuckerman also wants to swap 
his solitude for the erotic challenge of the young woman, Jamie, whose 
allure draws him back to all that he thought he had left behind: 
intimacy, the vibrant play of heart and body.

The second connection is with a figure from Zuckerman\'s youth, Amy 
Bellette, companion and muse to Zuckerman\'s first literary hero, E. I. 
Lonoff. The once irresistible Amy is now an old woman depleted by 
illness, guarding the memory of that grandly austere American writer who 
showed Nathan the solitary path to a writing vocation.

The third connection is with Lonoff\'s would-be biographer, a young 
literary hound who will do and say nearly anything to get to Lonoff\'s 
\"great secret.\" Suddenly involved, as he never wanted or intended to be 
involved again, with love, mourning, desire, and animosity, Zuckerman 
plays out an interior drama of vivid and poignant possibilities.

Haunted by Roth\'s earlier work The Ghost Writer, Exit Ghost is an 
amazing leap into yet another phase in this great writer\'s insatiable 
commitment to fiction.
