[T],NoggintheNomad,2010-09-24T20:00Z,"It's English language software with multi-language proofing tools. I have just installed it, set up Little Snitch Rules (obviously) and it seems AOK so far. The crunch comes when an update appears... I can't work out how it has been cracked. However, if what the uploader says is correct, about the multi-user license, it should be fine. Shame it's still 32 bit though, typical Microsoft, always a few years behind!"
,komod,2010-09-24T20:12Z,@jammeke the language for the interface is english but it has proofing dictionary for many languages.

[T],NoggintheNomad,2010-09-24T20:48Z,"Ah well... it looks OK for a Microsoft creation, actually. Much faster than 2008, even though it's still 32-bit."

[T],NoggintheNomad,2010-09-26T18:19Z,"I scanned it thoroughly, picked up no problems. It's working fine for me. Regarding a Swedish edition: this is a month ahead of official release. I'm sure the Svenska versjon will become readily available in due course. This version does, of course, include Swedish proofing tools."
,chillin69x,2010-09-26T20:54Z,"The download was fine, but when I run the different office programs, they ask for a key. I didn't find any txt file with that info nor did I expect to. I assume that Volume Licensed means that it didn't require my input of a key. Still, it asks. Any assistance? "
,mbuttons,2010-09-27T00:30Z,Whats with the image of the skull? Its scary =X
,topjimmy68,2010-09-27T08:57Z,"I’m skeptical about this “volume license” version working for too long.  The “volume license” version of Office 2010 for Windows doesn’t ask for a product key, but tries to activate against a corporate KMS host.  If KMS cannot be contacted, the Office programs will nag about activation…and possibly stop working.  It is likely that this Office 2011 for Mac will need KMS as well."

,kayser,2010-10-05T09:54Z,"anyone having an idea how to unlicense  and wipe office 2011 completely off a disk? the registration or crack from an early beta does seem to cause problems here and it seems I cannot get rid of that license info. I tried both uninstaller from Office 2008 and the early beta (which still included an removal tool), also I removed manually all visible and invisible files and folders; no luck! somewhere a hidden PID files must remain... Any idea?"

Also, when installing, it paused and said I had to shut down Safari. Why would MS Office care about Safari running or not? Very suspicious. 

Then when I restarted Safari, the ""Welcome to Safari"" screen came up as if this was the first time I had used it. I'm very concerned that this thing has installed something to track my Safari web surfing or steal your passwords.  

Anyone else experience this?

For those worrying about closing the browsers, it hasn't shown to cause any problems. If you think about it, most of the time when you install something on a PC, windows tells you to close all applications.

,GreedyWesterner,2011-06-10T14:59Z,"@sul007

Don't panic. Little SNithc is supposed to block programs from accessing the web. What you have to do is open Little Snitch Configurations, then create rules for your program to follow. THose rules determine which apps have access to the net and which don't. Everytime an app tries to access, you will be prompted to let it or not. At first you will have A LOT of those messages but once Little Snitch understands your preferences (always click Allow/Deny FOREVER) you won't have to worry about it. Make sure you deny all connections for pirated software and allow all for legal stuff."

Office for Mac actually requires much more work to remove than that of Office for Windows!
There's no such activator like AutoKMS for Mac!
And there's no such automatic Office removal tool for Mac!
With Mac you have to manually remove all prefferences, files and folders relating to Office.
With Windows you just right-click on the suite and select Uninstall through Programs and Features in Control Panel!

,acharlot,2011-12-06T08:52Z,"HELP!!! I downloaded this file...all was working well, then my MAC notified me of an update. Once I installed the update, my applications are not recognizing English, there are weird things happening with the spacing and the punctuation, etc. Anyone know anything about this? If we download from this site, should we use the automatic updates? Please advise."

,mikael128,2012-05-28T00:46Z,"Well, this is working great, but... I dunno whether it's linked to that torrent or not, but a few days after installing it someone almost hijacked my GMail account (someone from slovenia logged in with my password obviously, and got blocked by Google for suspicious activity). So... download with caution."
,gravycat,2012-05-31T19:03Z,"Had the same thing happen as mikail128.  It works great, but my Hotmail started sending out spam the morning after installing and the account got temporarily blocked for suspicious activity until I could confirm my identity.  A virus scan doesn't show anything.  Hrm."
