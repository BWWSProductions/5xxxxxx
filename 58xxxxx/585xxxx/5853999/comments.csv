,alejandro70,2010-10-14T00:09Z,GRACIAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[V],80zforever,2010-10-15T04:37Z,Dynoss give us some clue. see what happens.
,Dynoss,2010-10-16T13:14Z,"80zforever, Thank you very much for respond.
I have put the sample here (on 4shared):

audio(slash)CyMLUUML(slash)5x005x05

So far, nobody knows anything about it...
Though there were suggestions like Japan (David Sylvia) or D. Bowie or even Fiat Lux.
But still, don't know :("
[V],80zforever,2010-10-19T17:59Z,Dynoss what's this link? does not seem like an upload link.
,Dynoss,2010-10-20T10:34Z,"PB prevent users from posting links here, but maybe this could work:

4shared..com/audio/CyMLUUML/5x005x05

Just remove that one dot behind the name 4shared"
,tac,2010-10-22T01:56Z,Dynoss - why not google the lyrics? Sounds a bit like David Sylvian music but not the voice so much
,Dynoss,2010-10-22T04:28Z,"Yes tac, I've already tried that several times before... :("
,Dynoss,2010-10-25T07:11Z,"80zforever, do you maybe know who could that be?"
[V],80zforever,2010-10-26T00:34Z,"Hi Dynoss, I have no clue who the band is but based on how it sounds I think it belongs to the synthpop era of 1987 to early 90s. If I were you I would post it on synthpop forums and see if someone knows it. "
,Dynoss,2010-10-27T05:50Z,"OK. I will try that.
I thank you anyway."
