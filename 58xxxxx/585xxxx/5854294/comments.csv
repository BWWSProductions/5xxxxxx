,noOrp,2010-09-27T02:21Z,"Thanks ! :D


***

has this been taken care of in this rip ?


Darksiders.Update.1.incl.Intaller.Fix-SKIDROW

***"
,parrot2,2010-09-27T08:28Z,"""RIP - Cutscenes - Everything else is there!""
The game is MULTI5? or your ripped the other languages too?

If you ripped languages-.. 
""RIP: - Cutscenes and NON ENGLISH SPEECHES""

It's 1.1 version?"
,kk3377,2010-09-27T09:25Z,"all cutscene ripped?
only gameplay?"
,klicko94,2010-09-27T09:59Z,so @Shroo the cutscenes will be added in a separate torrent right ?
[V],Shroo,2010-09-27T13:05Z,"@parrot2

Can you not read or you just need to ask irrelevant stuff?

Removed - Cutscenes - Nothing Else!

Another thing about this release, that the game itself/or SKIDROWS has released it English only, if you want any other languages you will have to download SKIDROW language UPDATE!

+Do not talk about the old days when you dont know anything!"
,parrot2,2010-09-27T13:51Z,"""SKIDROWS has released it English only, if you want any other languages you will have to download SKIDROW language UPDATE!""

Sorry but it's 100% wrong
SKiDROW iSO it's MULTI5 with ALL the speeches and texts, are yout tried to use Phoenix?

Download the sim decyrtper and mount the iso then you can see the languages and speechs and you don't need the update.

""Do not talk about the old days when you dont know anything! ""
Well if you think so..never mind..is not my bussiness.

But you blame Globe and you did the same time ago..so..."
[V],Shroo,2010-09-27T14:12Z,"maybe you right, but you get what you see! But when you install setup does only one language."

All my TPTB games have always installed great and run well. Dont know what it is with this one. Please help. Even the setup.bat has finished in less then 5 minutes. Is that oke? I always waited about half an hour to complete with all other games. Is there maybe a problem with that setup?
Thx people!"

are you using a 64 bits OS?"
,piromandule,2010-10-01T23:49Z,"OMG I finally get it to work well not very well but....
I uninstalled the c++ all its components and then installed again. Now I can run the game but I dont know why when I start play the game there is some strange graphic issues like, I can see my hero but cant see the world around him,like trees,buildings,enemies and after 10 min the screen goes black but the audio is there. Maybe the game is too extreme for my Pc but with other more extreme games it only stutered(the graphics). In here they disapear. Any solution? 
and one more thx @mgcg88"
