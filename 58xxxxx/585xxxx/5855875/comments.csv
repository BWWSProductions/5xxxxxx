A-D is a great start, where are the E-Z?

It would be better if you had a uniform naming convention for your songs or at least Capitalized your songs consistantly.

Also If possible include a Song List in the torrent info or at the very least in a txt or nfo file inside the torrent.

Thanks for your effortz."
