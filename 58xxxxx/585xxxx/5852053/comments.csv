,odytzi,2010-09-26T03:50Z,"Oh another version!!!
I made a collection of different versions of civ V in my Pc!!!
I also have the demo!!!

I hope this one is better...:)"
,razox95,2010-09-26T11:41Z,shroo can u please rip darksiders men ? !
,gjera,2010-09-26T15:28Z,@svadilfari this game is not for kids. I recommend you minesweeper or some lame real-time strategy. Those are usually easier...
,odytzi,2010-09-26T19:26Z,Finally this game cannot be played by the users of win XP SP3 until a patch will be released!!

,.Blue.Zombie.,2010-09-27T03:05Z,"just finished downloading 
sadly i could not get it to install,
my norton's SONAR protection deleted the 
""tptb.4.ever.exe"" file
so i've give a pass on downloading this 
sorry shroo"
[V],Shroo,2010-09-27T12:57Z,"@.Blue.Zombie.

you can install the game without that file, the file that has been deleted is release intro! but such a lame antiviruses like norton do get them recognized as something else.. lame :]"

,Unit431,2010-10-02T07:43Z,"Anyone else tested the updates? For me, the game won't start up after applying update 2 with Skidrow's crack. Not sure if the problem is related to the rip or the crack itself. I'm using Windows XP 32bit as well."
,Unit431,2010-10-02T08:15Z,"Also, I love your rips but I have a suggestion : include the original .exe files! Some games simply refuse to install patches unless you have the original exe file, and hunting down the sucker can sometimes be really hard!"
,darkwolverinex,2010-10-02T08:41Z,the leaders in the diplomacy screen are not verbally talking! i mean the voice is not there..probably a fix is needed
,daucuskarota,2010-10-04T13:47Z,"I follow the instructions to play the game and everything goes fine until I launch the game from the shortcut from the desktop and I cannot initiate the game.
