,Nhaw-T,2010-09-28T05:46Z,how about for pc?
,Paki786,2010-09-29T06:27Z,"If I burn this game right now and it's not available for online play since it's release date is next week, will I still be able to play? Also when it does release and ABGX can verify it, do I need to burn it again or will the same copy work? Thanks"
,mbizzle420,2010-09-30T07:39Z,"USA works perfectly!!

,tizzy1984,2010-10-03T07:16Z,how do you burn a xbox game on your computer i know u need a dual disk wat else do u need to do 
,buddbusta_101,2010-10-04T10:31Z,Please people SEED!!!!!! Others would like this game as well
,bitchmagnet,2010-10-05T21:57Z,"@hopelessorgy

no, since the machine will sense it's a burned game and when you try to go online again you will get banned if not stealthed properly."
,dodoSKC,2010-10-08T10:49Z,"All right, here's my question. I don't know what it is but it think this version is fucked up because I've played tons of quick games, jordan challenges etc. and THERE IS NO pressbook feature. There simply isn't any. If I'm wrong, please enlighten me because it's pissing me off."
,dodoSKC,2010-10-08T10:51Z,"For those of you who have played this exact version, am I the only one not being able to view the pressbook feature? I think there's something wrong with this game since I've played tons of quick games, jordan challengens etc. and THERE IS NO pressbook. What the?"
,dodoSKC,2010-10-08T11:43Z,"Oh and one more thing, this version of the game HAS NO player of the game sequence and NO game wrap up feature. It seems to me this is somehow the unfinished version of the game. Don't believe me? Check it out."
,hopelessorgy,2010-10-11T07:19Z,"@dodoSKC 

It has a game wrap-up and player of the game feature for me. "
,dodoSKC,2010-10-11T18:34Z,"@hopelessorgy

Do I have to turn it on somewhere or what? I don't see the problem, I've downloaded the game, burnt it and there simply is no wrap-up,POTG feature. Everything else seems to be working just fine."
,nincow,2010-10-15T13:01Z,"It's the f%#@ing DEMO as far as I can tell. All I can choose is a quick game as either the lakers or the celtics. I can't believe I wasted a disc. It might as well be a coaster for all the good this does me. Unless I'm seriously missing something here, I don't see any way to choose another team. "
,haiti1800,2010-10-15T13:58Z,"hey do you have NBA 2K11 for PS2,if you do can please upload it."

,jayman3439,2010-12-15T06:10Z,"@jace0207

,2ndSight,2011-02-28T21:42Z,"How to burn games to DVDs:
1 .Get the iso
2. Have Dual Layered DVDs
3. Download abgx360
4. Open the iso in this program
5  Let the program check and patch any errors
    on the iso (you will now have a .dvd file next     
    to your iso, dont touch!)
6. Go to Imgburn (download if you don't already
    have it)
7. Set the burn speed to 1x
8. Burn the .dvd file to the CD.
annddd...
Wallah!"
