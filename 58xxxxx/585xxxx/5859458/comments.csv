,PhilLesh12,2010-10-01T06:00Z,"Thanks Ferrelas!  You're the only one upping this to TPB, so please keep up the good work!

I hope you understood all my comments on your first episode upload...  not being ""trusted"" or ""vip"", it was hard to judge if you were for real.

You obviously are for real.

THANKS.  This show is effing hilarious."
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-01T06:03Z,"... and, I've set my seeding for this torrent to >= 500%.  and contrary to cortez_the_killer, who thinks I'm a twat, my upload speed is set to unlimited, as it always has been."
,spartan777,2010-10-01T06:24Z,Thanks ferrelas! Surprised more people aren't torrenting this show. You are the only one I know of that is. Even eztv isn't.
,mrhuxley,2010-10-01T06:32Z,You are a legend mate!
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-01T07:33Z,"Much faster this time around.  

I'll keep seeding this to make it go faster.

I, too, am amazed that eztv isn't providing this.

Someone needs to make Ferrelas a trusted member."

I'm seeding this right now, and there are 1056 seeders and 532 peers."
,dave_agaric,2010-10-02T02:04Z,"Cheers PhilLesh12, but it's not connecting for me, for some reason. Checked other torrents and they're working fine. Here's a link for anyone else having trouble."
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-02T04:22Z,"@dave_agaric,

Enable DHT and local peer exchange.  The trackers used in this torrent are broken."
,jamesworts,2010-10-02T23:56Z,"@dave_agaric
Nothing wrong here at all, mine was downloaded in about 8 minutes! on a 20meg connection, i hasve had both releases from Ferrelas, one of the nice things is the ad's are cut out of it to!! A++ all the way! 

Ferrelas, please please, keep up the good work!"

,reah2011,2010-10-05T05:00Z,downloading pretty fast :-) i keep missing this on the television so its nice to find it online! i love karl. i know hes a comedian but i cant figure out if he really is that daft or if its an act lol. thanks again Ferrelas :-) and gratz on your skull n bones :D 
[T],Ferrelas,2010-10-06T05:10Z,"Thanks for all the congratulations and positive comments. :)

I'll keep uploading, don't worry, also, credit for this goes to the box and hanibal, not my releases. :P

I don't think Karl is faking it, he doesn't seem like he would, and I can sort of understand how he thinks, I'm a little like that too, only a lot smarter than him. Round headed mank (sp?)! ^^"
,YorkHunt,2010-10-08T00:05Z,"Seems to be downloading ok, even tho had zero seeders according to this page.

Thx ferrelas, awesome show & quick upload"

Thx ferrelasfor the quick upload"
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-08T06:20Z,"Karl isn't faking it.  He might be playing it up a bit, but I believe he is really just a simple, basic person with very little desire to understand anything outside of his little world.

He's a classic provincial.  Here in America, they join the tea party when a black man becomes president.  Not because they are prejudiced, but because they just don't understand it."
,jimmybgoode,2010-10-10T17:18Z,thank you ferrelas!
