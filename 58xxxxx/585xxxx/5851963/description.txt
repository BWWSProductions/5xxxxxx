Well I got some requests to 'purify'  my Hang Cool Concert dvd. Some people didn't like the mix of audio x with video y and z mixed together.

So I created a double dvd with everything I had from the Dallas concert from August 26 and all I have from the L.A. concert from August 12

Some songs won't be complete and the audio may be bad on some songs but I tried to pick out the best quality for you all.
