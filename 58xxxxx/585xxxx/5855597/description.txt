TEA PARTY: The Documentary Film
Libertyâ€™s march has a new generation of patriots.

About The Film
The Tea Party movement of 2009 shocked the political establishment, the nation at large and left a big media machine dizzy in its wake. How did it happen? Where did it come from? Now, experience the story of the movement that's driving our national dialogue against big government spending and a Constitution under assault. "Tea Party: The Documentary Film" follows the struggles of five grassroots individuals and their transformation from home town rally goers and rally organizers to national activists in the 912 March on Washington. In the process, the film reveals what is at the heart of this nationwide surge of civic engagement - a return to and respect for a Constitutionally limited government, personal responsibility and fiscal restraint at the Federal level.

Goals for the Film
The film seeks to further the conversation about the principles of the movement among tea party activists and provide a compelling means to share the story with those on the outside who are looking to understand its true nature.
