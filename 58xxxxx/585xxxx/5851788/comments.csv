You need both 64bit and x86 installers to get it work right.

,extil3,2011-01-06T23:34Z,"For those of you wondering how to get the controller or xbox 360 controller working in the game is to simply:

1)Run the game
2)Go to options at the main menu
3)Go to PC settings at the bottom of the options menu
4)On the left you'll see ""Controller"" around the middle of the list, at this point it should be disabled, simply change it to enabled, and press ""esc"" to go back and apply the changes. Once they're applied you're 360 wired/wireless and or gamepad should work fine.  [No idea why this was done by default]

Either way I almost wound up using xpadder to solve the problem until I realized this ROFL, felt like such a n00b to. LOL

Anyhow hope this helps, cause it almost prevented me from playing the game. As for the game itself, I haven't gotten far enough into it at this point to say whether or not to download it. But I've played it for about an hour, and got a bit annoyed with the continuous load screens and videos, and found the gameplay fluent but repetitive. Hopefully this will dissolve once I learn some combos or something. Anyhow I kind of trailed off hope I helped some people....

Either; buy a legal copy of the game. ( Eliminates possibly of software lag. ) But this is unlikely.

Or; your hardware cannot run the game because the game demands more power than your computer, and most likely ( laptop ) can muster.

,drkessence,2011-01-29T21:37Z,"Game is working great, however, I still can't seem to get the controller to work.  Tried using the above method.  Nothing.  Spent an hour trying out different solutions online.  Nothing.  Supposedly, the wireless controllers plain just don't work with DR2, so that could be it.  Either way, Capcom really dropped the ball on this as even the retail versions are having controller issues.

Thanks for the game, though."

,Klawsome,2011-09-23T16:59Z,"Ok Guys, this game works 100% for me!
Let me just just fix all your problems so that everyone can enjoy this game as i do.

How To save the Game:   Find a bathroom in the game and walk up to a stall or urinal, and press E, this will let you select a Game Save File, then you can save the game. I know its a very annoying way to save the game, but its the only way, lol.

Cd Product Key:   You do not need to go online searching for Keygens and such to activate this game! When the installation process comes to a point where it asks you to enter a Product Key, just enter anything that will take up the small text box where you type in the key, i just typed AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA and it worked!

Fixing the msvcr100.dll errors:   If the game randomly crashes or wont start, its probably because you don't have the msvcr100.dll file in your Windows Folder, Google the DLL file from a trustworthy website and put it in your Windows Folder.

Game Crashes On Startup:   Some of games now a days can only be played on Desktop PC's and not Laptops. They require a higher end Video Card that most laptops don't support. Such as Just Cause 2, that game cannot be played on Laptops because of the Direct X Errors. This game might have the same problem if it crashes on started for you. But i don't know that for sure yet because i haven't tested Dead Rising 2 on a laptop yet.

System requirements:

Minimum system requirements

OS: Windows XP/Vista/7
Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.4 Ghz / AMD Athlon 64 X2 4800+
Memory: 2 Gb
Hard Drive: 8.5 Gb free
Video Memory: 512 Mb
Video Card: nVidia GeForce 8800 / ATI Radeon HD 3850

Recommended system requirements

Intel Processor - Core 2 Duo E7300 2.66GHz
AMD Processor - Phenom II X2 550
Nvidia Graphics Card - GeForce GTS 250
ATI Graphics Card - Radeon HD 3870

Hope this Fixes some of your problems! :D

,AlbinoFox,2012-03-18T02:43Z,"Great game! Do have issues with game freezing than changing into a black screen. Have to ctrl-alt-del to get to task manager and end the game. Tried a lot of stuff and can't get game to play without freezing. My computer meets every requirement and surpasses each requirement by like a gigabyte or 2. I haven't tried the 16 Hz sound fix yet. Will give that a try.
