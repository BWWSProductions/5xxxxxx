Storyline:

Amid speculation that a meteorite crashed to Earth from Mars some 15,000 years ago and contains indications of simple life forms, 'Mars Attacks!' offers definitive proof of life on the Angry Red Planet.
No single-celled organisms, these alien invaders are the big-brained variety with a flair for ray guns and planetwide pandemonium.
Citizens of Earth face their doom with gung-ho valor and brainless abandon as little green men from outer space gleefully terrorize the planet in an all-star, cross-country sci-fi comedy.
