,topstarterRHP,2010-09-27T22:45Z,"I'm getting almost 2000 KB/s. WOW! Thanks!! I will seed for a week. Any idea if scene release will include online support like it did last year??? It would be nice because if that doesn't happen I'm just delaying the process, sooner or later I will have to buy the game :("
,Pimbax,2010-09-27T23:14Z,Only 30-10 kks :\

[T],Knaster,2010-09-28T01:24Z,"Nice Stun thx :)

Btw if you perhaps found this game ""Evochron Mercenary"" and uploaded it i'd be mighty glad :)"
,topstarterRHP,2010-09-28T02:52Z,"I got the game to run by copying the files starting with ""data...."". There are like 10 or more of them in the folder named ""game"". Then I DID overwrite the ones that are in the demo folder and tried running the Demo. The game started and YES it is FIFA 11 Full but when the game is going to start the Arena it just keeps on loading and loading and loading and stays like that forever. Any idea? Do the demo and the game have to be UK version both? Because my demo is US version so that might be the problem. Stun please can you help everyone with this. I guess you know how to solve this plroblem. Do you? Waiting for reply. Thank you :)"
,nawangweallan,2010-09-28T03:25Z,"Yea, have the same problem, infinite loading screen at arena loading..."
,nawangweallan,2010-09-28T03:50Z,downloading the uk demo version now to confirm if it will work with it. will post feedback later.
,nawangweallan,2010-09-28T04:34Z,same thing with the EU version. versions don't matter.
,nawangweallan,2010-09-28T04:35Z,Same thing with the EU version. Versions don't matter.
,Pimbax,2010-09-28T07:02Z,"It works

Thx"
,nawangweallan,2010-09-28T08:11Z,"holly shit, that method works. only there's no intro, u don't choose profile and there's no arena O_o. 
guess cud use this till proper crack comes out"
,NeWAcEiN,2010-09-28T08:17Z,is proper crack is available yet???
,nawangweallan,2010-09-28T08:19Z,"hold on, i spoke too early. there's no pitch in game ))"
,NeWAcEiN,2010-09-28T08:24Z,Is the proper crack available ????
,Millerdis100,2010-09-28T08:29Z,"1. Download and install Fifa 11 demo.

2. Mount Fifa 11 ISO (''Fifa11PCRus'').

3. Go to computer, open mounted disk folder and copy everything from the disk to your harddisk, where ever you want
(etc. to desktop). But make sure you copy these files to a folder (like ''Fifa 11 Setup'' or something).

4. Copy Game and Support folder from demo directory to the directory where you copyed those disk files (to your ''Fifa 11 Setup'' folder). Copy and replace everything when it asks.

5. Now Autorun and install it.

6. Use serial: KR9R-KNDV-YGSX-GNAL-NR7A

Wait for the crack, because demo fifa.exe just wont work. ;)"
,Pimbax,2010-09-28T09:22Z,"The fifa.exe of the demo works with no problems, im using it .

The game is fully fuctional now .

But lets wait for a razer or skid version .

But follow some instructions and use the fifa.exe of the demo and use the rna file to play and to not get any loading problems .

This game is a beast !"
,nawangweallan,2010-09-28T09:39Z,actually the fix djmafra posted works. you just can't save. and u will find a few problems. but it's playable.

,lupoplain,2010-09-28T14:23Z,"Why do the instructions have to be so impossible to understand?
Here's what I did: 
1.Installed the demo
2.Took all files that start with ""data"" from the ""game"" folder of the iso
3. Pasted them over the files, where the demo was installed
4. Put an ""rna.ini"" file in the demo ""game"" folder that contained this line:

SKIP_BOOTFLOW=1

5. That's it!"
,Eevox,2010-09-28T19:00Z,"I installed FIFA 11 following the steps given by 'P0nutz'. 

I also downloaded the reloaded crack from the link 'FromVasilakion' gave. It's still not loading properly unless you make the movies skip.

Can anyone who has downloaded the reloaded release confirm if the crack is working on it.

cheers,"
,nawangweallan,2010-09-28T20:55Z,Are you guys able to save/load after that intro bypass? ))))
,Haustka,2010-09-28T22:12Z,"I'm very confused now... I downloaded demo and this full version, but I can only play demo version. 
Am I on right track? or Am I supposed to play the full version after doing all those steps?

btw I can not install the full version for some reason... it just stops intalling.
