From Wiki:
I Married a Communist is a Philip Roth novel concerning the rise and 
fall of Ira Ringold, known as "Iron Rinn." The story is narrated by 
Nathan Zuckerman, and is one of a trio of Zuckerman novels Roth wrote 
in the 1990s depicting the postwar history of Newark, New Jersey and 
its residents.

Ira and his brother Murray serve as two immense influences on the 
school-age Zuckerman, and the story is told as a contemporary 
reminiscence between Murray and Nathan on Ira's life. Although a 
communist, Ira became a star in radio theater. Personal conflicts with 
his wife, McCarthyite politicians, a gossip columnist, and his 
daughter-addled and manipulative wife all combine to destroy Ira and 
many of those around him.

Some reviewers, consider the character of Eve Frame â€” antisemitic wife 
who destroys Ira â€” to be a barely disguised retort at Roth's ex-wife, 
Claire Bloom, for her unflattering memoirs which portray a Roth unable 
to bottle his vanity and incapable of living in the same household with 
Bloom's daughter, Anna Steiger.

Amazon Review:

Ira Ringold is a self-educated radio actor, married to a spoilt, 
rags-to-riches beauty, silent-film star Eve Frame (Chave Fromkin). 
He is a Communist, and a "sucker for suffering," locked into the cycle 
of violence from which he has emerged. She has risen by assiduous 
imitation of what is "classy"--which seems to include a wide swathe of 
anti-Semitism--and ultimately denounces her husband as a Soviet spook. 
And who would be the narrator of this McCarthy-era meltdown? None other 
than Philip Roth's longtime alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, who learns the 
full tragedy several decades later, owing to a chance encounter with 
Ira's brother: "I'm the only person living who knows Ira's story," 
90-year-old Murray Ringold tells Nathan, "you're the only person still 
living who cares about it."

Characteristically, Nathan also discovers that his own story was bound 
up with the blacklistings and ruined careers of the immediate postwar 
period. It seems that he had been tainted by his association with the 
Ringolds--Murray was in fact his high-school teacher--and was denied 
the Fulbright scholarship he deserved. "They had you down for Ira's 
nephew," Murray tells Nathan. "The FBI didn't always get everything 
right." Roth's acerbic style and keen eye for emotional detail goes to 
the heart of this moment of high tragedy in which the American dream 
was damaged beyond repair.
