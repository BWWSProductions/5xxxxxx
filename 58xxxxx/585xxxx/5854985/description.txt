"Remember Paul?"

The residents of Wisteria Lane are stunned to discover 
that Paul Young is out of prison and back in the 
neighborhood with an enigmatic new wife and seemingly 
dark motives. Meanwhile, while Paul is renting 
Susan's home, she, Mike and MJ are living in an 
apartment on limited funds. But Susan sees a glimmer 
of hope in getting her life back on the Lane when 
she's offered an unorthodox job by her apartment 
manager, Maxine (Lainie Kazan); Lynette's rich and 
successful college friend, Renee (Vanessa Williams), 
pays an unexpected visit to the Scavo household; 
Gabrielle and Carlos find themselves keeping secrets 
from one another; and Bree, newly single and needing 
a fresh start after selling her business, finds 
herself tempted by Keith (Brian Austin Green) -- 
the handsome, younghandyman she's hired to update her 
house.

Enjoy :)
