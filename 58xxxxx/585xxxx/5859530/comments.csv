,puunjab,2010-10-01T06:57Z,"RAR files save about 4.6 % of the total size on XVid videos. Doesn't even save the uploader 1/20th of his upload time, but makes every single downloader have a RAR program to extract the file.

Anyone who uses RAR on one video file is too fucking stupid to know how to wipe his own ass.

I guarantee scenebalance is a tard with hershey squirts in his underwear."
