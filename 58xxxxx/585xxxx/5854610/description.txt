The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 26 September 2010


[sebaygo1]


The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

On today's show, Alex talks about Czech President Vaclav Klaus and his criticism of calls by the United Nations for "global governance" and its supranational agencies to deal with the banker created economic crisis. Alex also discusses fertility reduction vaccines developed by the eugenicists at the Rockefeller Foundation.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
