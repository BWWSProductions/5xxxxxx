A collection of various Pathfinder rpg source and reference books, in pdf format.
It's all packed together in a .zip, I didn't feel like loading each pdf separately, sorry.
I apologize for the lack of organization, I\'ll put them into subfolders and reupload soon.

First torrent, I have tons of random videos, animes, roleplaying books, etc.
Give me a message at doctorhopeless@gmail.com and I\'ll see if I have/can find from friends anything you might want.
