,Otaku073,2010-09-25T22:57Z,nice. i posted this a little over an hour ago and already have 30 people and rising. Ill keep seeding this until theres some more seeders willing to hand off the torch.
,Otaku073,2010-09-25T23:40Z,"also sorry if its a little slow on the initial seed. I have internet from ATT so its not super fast (about 50kb upload from me) but just be patient, you recieve my upload plus the data others have already recieved and when the initial seed is complete it will go much faster"
,lestatvvvvvv,2010-09-25T23:51Z,someone seeeeeed
,Otaku073,2010-09-26T00:07Z,"@lestatvvvvvv
this was just uploaded im the only seeder until someone else finishes the download just be patient"
,Otaku073,2010-09-26T09:01Z,sorry that my upload turned off at some point last night we had a party at our house and someone unplugged our router.
,Otaku073,2010-09-26T17:47Z,does anyone know why this page still says 0 seeders 0 leechers when theres like 120 people on it?
,Jintek55,2010-09-27T09:52Z,"Yeah, I'm DLing now at about 50kb.  

I wanted to ask Otaku073 a question...is this game an NTSC-U origin or is it PAL?"
,Otaku073,2010-09-27T14:18Z,"@Jintek55
Its Region Free"
,Jintek55,2010-09-27T15:45Z,"@Otaku073

Yeah, I know it's RF...I just was wondering if the source origin was NTSC-U.  Because I already have the BMP scene release which is also Region Free but the origin is PAL.  And I like to have a collection of NTSC-U origin region games is all.  Because with some games the origin can affect saved games due to the Game ID being different.  

But if you are in the USA and bought it, it's definitely NTSC-U."
,Otaku073,2010-09-27T16:23Z,Oh ok sorry yeah i bought it in the USA its definitely NTSC origin
,Otaku073,2010-09-27T22:38Z,If your wondering why your stuck at 58% thats because i want to play some xbox live and the lag is horrible with this torrent running but dont worry just keep your torrent running and i will start it back up tonight and keep it running
,Otaku073,2010-09-28T16:55Z,for some reason this is saying there are 0 seeders and 0 leechers but at the time of this comment its me seeding and 229 leechers. Whats going on??

,Otaku073,2010-09-30T04:35Z,sorry guys who stopped at 94% i came back from work and my torrent was off. I think one of my roomates turned it off but im back seeding again.
,108mob,2010-09-30T05:49Z,Alright Man I Appreciate It Letz Keep It Alive I Will Seed Once It Is Done!
,Jintek55,2010-09-30T15:41Z,Done and seeding!
,Otaku073,2010-09-30T16:47Z,Now that the torrents has alot of seeders does anyone know why the site still says 0 seeders and 0 leechers. This torrent would be alot busier if it said how many people are really on it
,cmc500,2010-10-01T05:54Z,"Yea I know, I've been seeding since it finished downloading and so far the ratio is 11:1, and I'm continuing to upload at 2 megabytes (16mbits) per second..."
,Otaku073,2010-10-01T06:54Z,"@cmc500
cool man, but i still cant figure out why this page says 0 seeders 0 leechers. Is it me or the webpage?"
,cmc500,2010-10-01T09:29Z,"@Otaku073 It ain't just you, I think that its a more widespread issue then just this page, maybe they disabled it temporarily for some reason because none of the recent torrents have any seeds/leechs according to the bay."
,bonzai37,2010-10-02T23:56Z,I'm a noob to DLing games. I Dled this. Now what do I do with the iso image? How do I burn it to a DVD so it will work in the 360? So far I've expanded the RAR files. Now what? Thanks
,Otaku073,2010-10-04T01:45Z,"@bonzai37
first of all you have to have a flashed xbox if you dont it wont play. if your xbox is not flashed just google it theres tons of tutorials for it. Once its flashed use ImgBurn to burn the img file to a DVDdl disc. it has to be a dual layer disc. Then burn and put in xbox done"
,bonzai37,2010-10-06T03:55Z,Thanks for the help everyone!
,Werepire,2010-10-07T23:30Z,do you have to put on CD or do you use a flashdrive? im completly noob at this
,issc29,2010-10-08T20:04Z,"Hey, i just burned iso via clonecd and put it in my xbox, but it does not seem to recognize a cd was placed in it. it still says ""open tray"". i am using ixtreme LT. help anyone?"
,Otaku073,2010-10-09T06:02Z,you sure your xbox is flashed correctly? do other games say open tray? What type of drive do you have?
,venneke,2010-10-12T17:40Z,"If im checking the game in ABGX is says that stealth status is uncertain, quote: ""Video partition does not match known data (could be corrupt or a new wave not seen before)

Can anyone help me with this?"
,Infliktion,2010-10-13T00:03Z,"if i knew how to do crap like this, it would be so nice. 
itd save me tons of money. i only came on here to read the frustrating

if you dont want a free Halo: Reach through torrents then why are you here? just to complain to us that you dont like Halo: Reach?"
,fersclando,2010-10-17T01:17Z,is this safe online.?
,venneke,2010-10-17T18:31Z,"@fersclando

Yes works fine online."
,lestatvvvvvv,2010-10-19T23:46Z,"I DLIng this but seen that I have to flash my xbox, what will that do to my xbox? I have the xbox elite with the 120 gb hd,,,, an xbox live set up on it and my son is on 24/7 if I flash it will he be screwed in trying to play his games ?"
,Otaku073,2010-10-20T07:20Z,"@lestatvvvvvv
there are hundreds of tutorials out there but i have noticed that the xbox elite microsoft got smarter and made those xboxes harder to flash depending on when you got it and what drive your xbox has in it. Just look up some tutorials on youtube and google and they will tell you everything you need to know."

,abcdefghijz,2010-11-13T20:39Z,fuck it up my ass all this shit is too confusing
,SaltSlasher,2010-11-23T05:38Z,"Dude, if you haven't done it before, try googling it or better yet, go to you tube and ask that question. Cause asking it in a comments box usually doesn't work. 
You have an iso and image, open the iso with abgx, and if there is anything but green then don't continue unless you find good ss and dmis. Then if all green, then take the image(.dvd) and run it through img burn, then put it in your flashed xbox."
,Furkan0707,2010-12-02T12:06Z,is anyone confirm that the game works fine ?? thx..
,Otaku073,2010-12-03T16:01Z,Everything works like it should and passes ABGX. Everyone make sure you have the new ABGX1.04
,SuperMechaCow,2010-12-05T16:14Z,"This is awesome. I didn't have to patch anything. I could have just straight burned it to DVD.

For people having trouble, make sure you run this through ABGX 360 VERSION 1.04 or higher. Also, if you're not sure how to burn an Xbox game, do a lot of thorough research on Google before posting here. It's a very particular process and if you change one little thing, even the brand and manufacturer region of the DVD, then the entire thing won't work."
,SuperMechaCow,2010-12-05T16:15Z,"OOPS! I take that back. SplitVid was too small, but ABGX auto-fixed it. Thanks again."
,Otaku073,2010-12-09T00:24Z,theres a ABGX1.0.5 out now
