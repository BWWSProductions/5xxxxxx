,ShIz0pHreeN,2010-10-01T22:28Z,"Its a virus.. it tells me that theres a dropper in it, fix it"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-10-01T23:52Z,"@ShIz0pHreeN you're a noob. idk what program you use but tbh you sound like spam. this has no virus in it. i have some pretty sweet scanners too. avira, a-squared, spybot, macaffee, trendmicro, avast, emsisoft anti malware, emdsisoft emergency kit, etc, etc, et motherf*ckin c. no virus at all, no ""dropper"" as you call it either."
,ShIz0pHreeN,2010-10-03T18:35Z,"Relax man whatever it was, i couldnt open the file bc my antivir. wrote me it was a ""dropper"". Whatever it was, it could happen to any other guy who downloads this. So if you dont believe me its your problem. And no, im not a noob. My antivir is uptodate and i scanned the whole thing, still telling me that it was a ""dropper"""
,ShIz0pHreeN,2010-10-03T18:38Z,And btw. i scanned it with avast.
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-10-05T01:15Z,"LMFAO, just because you have an updated antivir that is trash anyhow, doesn't make you a pro. i went to college to learn about computers. do something like that and you wont be a noob. also google ""false positive virus detection"" then you'll understand why i call you a noob. it's not a bad thing to be a chicken nublet, even i was one at a time, long, long ago.... lol. cheers anyhow"
,ShIz0pHreeN,2010-10-06T06:53Z,"Fine if you mean so, no reason to get angry or something. Just tried to give feedback."
,LD4WG,2010-10-18T10:18Z,"Im having a problem with xlive.dll, it stops the game from launching after it installs... Ive read that installing the games for windows live installer fixes it, so im doing that now. Also the Russian shit fucking sucks, you have to browse to the mounted RE5 disc during the install which took me a while because I didnt know what the fuck it wanted me to browse to. "
,LD4WG,2010-10-18T15:16Z,"Ok so I fixed the xlive.dll problem by simply installing Games For Windpws Live, No I get this 

""C:\Games\Resident Evil 5\nativePC\Image\Archive\LoadResource.arc"" 3 as an error, can you help me fix this? This is one buggy torrent :s"
,Eddhunter,2010-10-19T15:56Z,"OK finally i was able to instal it but when i try to run it i get this message: Failed open file. ""E:\Games Install\RESIDENT EVIL 5\nativePC\Image\archive\LoadResource.arc"" 3

can anyone help me with this..."
,killergreen420,2010-10-30T18:32Z,ssssssssssseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeddddddddd please if you download you should upload selfish bitches seeding is how you keep agood thing going durrrrr
,capiel89,2010-11-04T11:25Z,"hey guys, im having the same problem with the one who said that it was a virus...technically, when i mount the file, when start the installation, an alert from my microsoft defender show up telling me it detected trojan or wateva it is..the prob is, can anyone here tell me how am i suppose to solve this problem?....i dont wanna waste this after waiting hours to get it downloaded....pls someone guide me.."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-11-04T12:00Z,"@capiel89 turn off windows defender. it sucks anyhow and there is NO virus in this, or any of my torrents...and never will be."
,stalin0077,2010-11-09T18:47Z,"WHEN I MOUNT GAME , WITH VIRTUAL CD DRIVE ,IT'S POP UP A MESSAGE , THE LANGUAGE OF THE MESSAGE I CAN READ IT ,WHAT SHOULD I DO ?"
,Dotstorm,2010-11-14T03:50Z,"When i started the Setup it sai
Îøèáêà
---------------------------
Ôàéë ""Setup-1.bin"" íå íàéäåí â ""C:\Users\Drew\AppData\Local\Temp"". Ïîæàëóéñòà, âñòàâüòå ïðàâèëüíûé äèñê èëè âûáåðèòå äðóãóþ ïàïêó.

What should i do "
,Tchitchonisa,2010-11-28T12:16Z,"To Dotstorm: copy and past (setup-1bin and Movie folder ) from the iso image to ""C:\Users\Drew\AppData\Local\Temp"".
Then reinstall/install the game all will be good ...
Well not all because the ""images"" file is missing so this torrent is somehow useless "
,joshr_chanfan,2010-11-29T19:32Z,"Tchitchonisa is absolutely right.  You can't even mount it because it isn't a proper iso.  I used both of my rar softwares to open the ""iso"" and found that there is nothing inside.  How you manage to make a empty iso worth 4gigs is beyond me.  0_0; 

Or perhaps there's a trick to instal it.  Why don't you enlighten us.  Your description said that it's suppose to be easy."
,joshr_chanfan,2010-11-29T19:43Z,"By the way, FuCtUpPuNK, did you even test your work before you uploaded it?"
,joshr_chanfan,2010-11-29T19:53Z,"Ok, FuCtUpPuNK, I'll try to download it again.  It's possible that it screwed up on my end.  Or perhaps I was just over-looking something.  I know you're good for it.

(I suddenly had an epiphany while I was posting my last message. lol)"
,joshr_chanfan,2010-11-30T05:44Z,"Ok, so I finally was able to look inside the iso.  Albeit a rather unorthadox way of doing so, I managed to somewhat install the game.  ""Somewhat"" meaning that the game refused to fully install.  Leaving me with an incomplete installment.  

Either my computer is missing a dll or something like that that is needed to run the program , or you're not as specific as you should have been.  Either way, this game's installment is anything but easy."
,ezio325,2010-12-25T20:47Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD ITS A FUCKIN VIRUS!!!

When I tried to burn it with it showed me VIRUS: Setup.bat ............"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-01-01T00:48Z,"@ezio325 don't be an idiotic noob. there are NO VIRUSES in any of my torrents, including this one. most torrents will pop up with a false positive in virus scanners...that is something you need to know. look it up on google if you don't know what that is."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-01-01T00:51Z,"@joshr_chanfan all my torrents were tested 100% by myself. i even beat most of the games, this being one of the ones i beat. using my own torrent too. it works and is a proper iso file. i mounted with ultraiso, if that helps. why you can't mount it, i don't understand. prolly gives you an error in a different language? if so you might need to install the lang pack for that lang (id guess), hell might not even have to do that just go to microsoft website and update your crap. BAM problem solved (im 99.9% sure)"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-01-01T00:53Z,@Tchitchonisa NOTHING IS MISSING...... torrent works just fine. you just don't know how to keep your computer up to date. also don't know how to read the contact info....adding me would have solved your problems a lot faster.
,joshuasm,2011-02-25T23:15Z,"You are a piece of shit dude, this torrent has a the Trojan in it.  I know for a fact, I had to remove it after installing it.... no false positive here just a fucking positive... and this dude is trusted? fuck me.."
,obeyXme,2011-04-22T00:39Z,"No virus as  far as I can tell. Nice and tidy.

Then, it asks me for CD 1 and somehow the path  goes to the Local/Temp...etc  file. Wtf? I just open up the place where i unpacked the zip and continue. 

The setup stops and says there is no damned file (as couple others have mentioned, there is no Iso, the torrent is ""empty"") and says Abort, Ignore or Try Again ... only by pushing"" Ignore"" it installs on the comp (lol easy install) , BUT-

When i try to start through the launcher i get the folowing msg: Failed open file. C:\Program Files\RESIDENT EEVIL 5\Image\archive\LoadResource.arc""3


What am i doing wrong? "
,Marcvss,2011-04-23T13:18Z,"@ obeyXme...

Same problem here.

Think it has something to do with there being no cd crack.

As I recall all RE games are played with cd in drive."
,Marcvss,2011-04-23T13:40Z,"The game is just missing key elements like the image folder wich should be located in the NativePc folder.

In other words NO USE IN DOWNING THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!

Better down the reloaded version.

,blitzmichael2,2011-06-20T18:42Z,"just copy what's inside the ISO to the TEMP folder of your profile in Windows. by the way enable the view all files in folder options, then install"
,Joshx99,2011-07-30T16:16Z,"Everytime I try selecting a folder it comes up with a window saying some russian bullshit XD
I'm assuming it says theres a problem.
Any suggestions?"
