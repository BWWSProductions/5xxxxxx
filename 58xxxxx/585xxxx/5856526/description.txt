                    Acclaimed filmmaker Shane Meadows makes his  
                    televisual debut with the much-anticipated  
                    follow-up to his BAFTA award-winning film, This  
                    Is England - set in 1983 and in which    
                    13-year-old Shaun found escape from bullying at  
                    school when a gang of skinheads, led by the  
                    affable Woody, made him part of their 'family'.  
                    But now it's 1986... Shaun, having rejected his  
                    Mum, is living rough. Lol's, world is falling  
                    apart and she's doing everything she can to  
                    fall apart with it. She doesn't want Milky or  
                    Woody, and she certainly doesn't want anything  
                    to do with her father.
