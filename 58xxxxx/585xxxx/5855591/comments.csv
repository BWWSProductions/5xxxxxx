,daba_1,2010-09-27T16:24Z,"The musical partnership of David Crosby (born August 14, 1941), Stephen Stills (born January 3, 1945), and Graham Nash (born February 2, 1942), with and without Neil Young (born November 12, 1945), was not only one of the most successful touring and recording acts of the late '60s, '70s, and early '80s -- with the colorful, contrasting nature of the members' characters and their connection to the political and cultural upheavals of the time -- it was the only American-based band to approach the overall societal impact of the Beatles. The group was a second marriage for all the participants when it came together in 1968: Crosby had been a member of the Byrds, Nash was in the Hollies, and Stills had been part of Buffalo Springfield. The resulting trio, however, sounded like none of its predecessors and was characterized by a unique vocal blend and a musical approach that ranged from acoustic folk to melodic pop to hard rock. "

,tackfurlo,2011-10-06T20:33Z,"I'm 24 and I've already been to 2 of their concerts.  I now have 3 t-shirts and my Mom actually has bought this very CD.  I love them!  I can't believe people like Britney Spears get airtime and yet most of my friends have never heard of these guys!  This is music when it still had a soul, folks.

That said, DRM on the CD is a damn nightmare to remove - more or less an outright rootkit.  I'm pirating it instead of trying to rip it again because it's easier.

Way to go RIAA - Making paying customers suffer and doing nothing to stop pirates since the day you were founded!"
