,Andrewdiss,2010-10-01T00:48Z,"I'm definitely sorry. I will make sure to do so next time. It was truly a mistake. Although, I don't believe I will get in trouble for leaving the tag on so I will include it next time."
,Andrewdiss,2010-10-01T00:51Z,"I just went to where I had posted it and changed it so you are given credit, sorry about that again."
,LftdLorax,2010-10-01T05:36Z,"Rainy Day Daydream worked but none of your other torrents do. Its like 7 seconds of a fucking wide, narrow, blank screen. What gives?"
,sweaterpuppies1,2010-10-07T16:50Z,"Once again, Cho can't release what doesn't exist yet. Hopefully it will exist :3.

Otherwise the WEB-DLs of 12-13 are not web downloads yet... go to iTunes store, note lack of ep12-13."

The first episode was on here for a while, but then it disappeared..."
