I don't care much if you remove my [tag] from the file name but I believe you should give proper credit where it's due. Consider that I take time from my busy work week to upload this for the fans. I believe hard work and dedication deserves to at least be mentioned. Well I said what I had to say, in the end you'll have to decide what's right and wrong. I didn't mention your full name by the way since I don't feel I have to. You know how you are. 

Been fun you guys! Until next season (hopefully)
