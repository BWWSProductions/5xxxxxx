,hello40204,2010-09-25T00:46Z,"your guys know better than to put this in a hd high resolution . like most of you if everybody don't respect the rules , its going to be a mess. "
,XxxCutterxxX,2010-09-25T01:51Z,Stop putting this shit in the Hi-Res section. You guys that keep doing this crap are totally defeating the purpose of having a Hi-Res category. Even if it were 720p or 1080p its gonna look like shit compared to an actual blu-ray rip with a decent bit rate. Look at this shit... 649kbps. Why do you idiots keep wasting your time. Morons! Put this shit where it belongs PLEASE!!!!
,ManuelRivero,2010-09-25T02:03Z,720x288 isn't 720p. This is SD not HD. 
,XxxCutterxxX,2010-09-25T03:35Z,"Hey, you clever guy you.. Thats what i was saying. Whats funny is this actually looks  worse than the imagine release at 1.32Gb. Dont waste your time people this rip sucks. "
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-09-25T05:48Z,I agree. Don't put things in the wrong category. It just pisses people off. It's like labeling a movie a different movie name.
,reazonable,2010-09-25T08:32Z,I remember I downloaded Aliens vs Predators once and it turned out to be gay porn. Put stuff in proper sections please. R5 is not even a proper dvd rip quality
,papitow,2010-09-25T16:21Z,"WoW, i wasnt even going to download this movie now. I came to this post just to see why an R5 was in the HD section and found all this comments about it.
Such a shame a trusted member got to do this."
,banman,2010-09-26T01:00Z,How can we remove this falseplayer from the trusted category?
,mrpras,2010-09-26T04:05Z,it's a crap film anyway
[V],ExtraTorrentRG,2010-09-27T12:27Z,Rite im a new member to this group it is my blame that the movies are in the wrong section ill make sure this does not happen again
,gabriel1475,2010-09-30T11:56Z,"Damn right you wont! And for all the trouble, you owe each and every one of us a Whopper extra value meal! Now!!!! (no onions, beeeeeyatch!)"
