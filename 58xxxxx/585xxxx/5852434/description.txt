Ben Quick hitches a ride to Frenchman's Bend, Mississippi from two young women in a convertible, Clara Varner and her sister-in-law Eula. Clara's father is Will Varner, the domineering owner of most of the town.

Will sees in the brash newcomer a younger version of himself, ruthless and ambitious. These qualities are, in Will's opinion, sadly lacking in his only son Jody.

He is also disappointed with his schoolteacher daughter. Clara's boyfriend, genteel Southern blue blood Alan Stewart, is a mama's boy, not the kind of son-in-law Will wants. He schemes to push his daughter and Ben together, to try to bring fresh, virile blood into the family.
