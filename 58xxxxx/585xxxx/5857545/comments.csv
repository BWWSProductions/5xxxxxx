[T],whodathoughtit,2010-10-01T12:14Z,"just tried it on a 32bit windows 7 and did not work, think you need steam, but not sure "
,forcepsdragonlord,2010-10-01T18:20Z,"same thing. Do not work for me. (win7 x64).
 when i run setup in iso image nothing happened , game do not install ???    other torrent version block on first level and crash.  HELP???"
,telep_man,2010-10-01T21:19Z,"Alright, Skidrow, I knew I could count on you!

 whodathoughtit and forcepsdragonlord:

Dont know why it doesnt work for you, I have Windows 7 64bit (with UAC disabled), and I simply mounted the image, ran setup and installed DirectX and that other thing. Then I copied all the files from Skidrow folder, and that was it. Although I already had DirectX 11, I checked the box to install DirectX 9.0c and I expected it to say i have a newer version, but it actually installed something. I know its supposed to be backwards compatible, but I say you should install it anyway. "

,skyflat,2010-11-11T19:47Z,It's the FULL Version?
,rgunn4,2010-11-14T03:06Z,"Worked for me. I am using XP 32bit. I mounted the iso with DAEMON Tools lite. After installing the exe file I closed it all down, restarted my computer, copied and pasted the SKIDROW contents into the correct program files on my computer. I've played it for a few hours and had no problems at all. 

As for the game I didn't know it wasn't going to be like all the other Lara Croft, this one is not at all like those games. It plays a bit like the old school Golden Axe game. It's still pretty fun with lots of hidden treasures and challenges. Fun game overall. Thanks SKIDROW "
,PhilKessel,2010-11-18T20:33Z,"downloaded and everything works perfectly fine. 
whoever commented that this doesnt work on windows 7 64 or this torrent has any issues at all is either a) a moron or b) are trying to run this on their shitty computer. "

,Tiger_77,2010-12-05T14:43Z,"@SKIDROW

This release has two trojans contained within the crack.  One was detected by Avira and the other was detected my Malwarebytes so it can't be both false positive.  

Also in your Guardian of Light Update 1 - SKIDROW,  the cracks still contain two trojans as detected by Avira/Malwarebytes."

,JakAttack,2011-01-25T07:17Z,"Running Windows 7 64bit. I burnt it to a DVD and installed fine, ticked both boxes at the end of installation (microsoft c++ thing and direct X 9) when i click the shortcut on my desktop steam store opens up displaying LCGOL purchase information! when i go through the disk, then into the SKIDROW folder and click the run application in there, it says ""The program can't start because binkw32.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix the program"".. I didn't do step 4 (4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD to your installation directory and overwrite) because i have no idea what to do, im guessing thats the problem. Can someone please explain what i have to do there? like ... step by step? thanks in advance! "
