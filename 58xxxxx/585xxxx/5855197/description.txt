OlFa NOTES
used Cybropm source and resynced audio at point where vframes were dropped, nothing else was done...some parts are very dark and some jerkyness still exists. Hardcoded eng subs for most foreign parts, not all.

credit OlFa & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
