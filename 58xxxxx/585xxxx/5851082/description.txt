From Wiki:
American Pastoral is a Philip Roth novel concerning Seymour "Swede" Levov, a 
Jewish-American businessman and former high school athlete from Newark, New 
Jersey. Levov's happy and conventional upper middle class life is ruined by 
the domestic social and political turmoil of the 1960s, which in the novel is 
described as a manifestation of the "indigenous American berserk". 

The novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1998 and was included in Time's "All-TIME 
100 Greatest Novels". The film rights to it were later optioned by Paramount 
Pictures. In 2006, it was one of the runners-up in the "What is the Greatest 
Work of American Fiction in the Last 25 Years?" contest held by the New York 
Times Book Review.

AMERICAN PASTORAL - Seymour "Swede" Levov-a legendary high school athlete, a 
devoted family man, a hard worker, the prosperous inheritor of his father's 
Newark glove factory-comes of age in thriving, triumphant postwar America. 
But everything he loves is lost when the country begins to run amok in the 
turbulent 1960s. Not even the most private, well-intentioned citizen, it 
seems, gets to sidestep the sweep of history. American Pastoral is the story 
of a fortunate American's rise and fall-of a strong, confident master of 
social equilibrium overwhelmed by the forces of social disorder. For the 
Swede is not allowed to stay forever blissful inside the beloved hundred-and-
seventy-year-old stone farmhouse, in rural Old Rimrock, where he lives 
with his pretty wife-the college sweetheart who was Miss New Jersey of 
1949-and the lively, precocious daughter who is the apple of his eye, that is 
until she grows up to be a revolutionary terrorist.
