Skills chapters elaborate on news values and the conventions of journalism as they apply to sports writing. From leads to nut grafs, inverted pyramid to Model T, simple sentences to headlines, interviewing to using quotations, Sports Journalism focuses on the basics. The book expands the writer's experience into building relationships with sources and media contacts, using numbers and statistics, practicing AP style, and abiding by legal and ethical standards.
