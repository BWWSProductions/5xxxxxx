From Recorded Books:

Best-selling novelist Philip Roth has won Americaâ€™s four major literary 
awards, the National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Faulkner Award,
the National Book Award, and the Pulitzer Prize in fiction. The Anatomy 
Lesson is the third volume of the acclaimed Zuckerman series. Now 40 
years old, writer Nathan Zuckerman is afflicted by constant pain that 
prevents him from writing another word.

 - - -

Plagued by a debilitating, seemingly undiagnosable ailment,
the great author Nathan Zuckerman is living out his middle
-aged years on his back under the care of his harem. He 
can't write or type without spasms of pain shooting 
through his neck and shoulders, yet doctors by the 
hundreds are unable to offer an effective treatment. Could
this pain be his penance for writing the indecent 
"Carnovsky?" Zuckerman ponders this as he puffs his joint 
before sipping vodka and downing his third Percodan of the
morning.
