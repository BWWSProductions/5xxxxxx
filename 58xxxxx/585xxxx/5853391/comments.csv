Fast download - maxed out my connection. Works like a charm."
,Kvant2,2011-03-09T02:17Z,"Perfectly working!!! Many, many Thanks to you, Nikita!!!!!!!"
,kev23f,2011-04-16T14:46Z,"um, my antivirus says this has a trojan in one of the exe's - anyone else care to comment? Maybe a false positive?"
,Adam_OSFP,2011-05-02T12:54Z,"3.0.100.399.exe is a Trojan. Let your antivirus remove it. DO NOT EXECUTE IT!!! Install program, copy cracked files into installation directory, run bat file and that's it."
,ImSoJaded,2011-07-06T16:50Z,Trojan in the archive. So much for trusting the green skull :P
,keihtan,2011-11-16T14:56Z,"as Adam_OSFP stated, all files and fix are OK and WORKING, except file ""3.0.100.399.exe"" which is TROJAN WIN32/DYNAMER!DTC - so just delete this 1 crap and enjoy ;-)"
,Stacman,2011-12-10T03:22Z,"So can the retail app be downloaded and installed, and use the ""Fix"" files to patch it?"
,kokoplioko,2011-12-28T12:51Z,"Didn't execute 3.0.100.399.exe. Still works fine.
Thanks!"
,CaptHawk,2012-01-20T03:20Z,"strange.... I scanned all files with Kaspersky (legit updated version), including 3.0.100.399.exe. No trojan detected.... a false positive maybe? I also checked it online"
