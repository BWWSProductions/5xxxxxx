,lorum,2010-09-30T23:07Z,"F.B.I i am agreed with you, the price ÂŁ69.95 is crazy! and also it takes 24 hours to activate your aircraft...that is just hilarious.

and also charge you extra for a new activation code...ha ha ha"

,737300,2010-10-01T17:52Z,Installed ok but some of the vc textures don't appear correctly nor does the galley. Tried installing different ways but can't sort it. Still a great plane though. Thanks
,fturnerj,2010-10-01T21:52Z,"To correct the interior texture problem you need to take some of the texture files from the Boeing_737_900ER_FSX and add them to the aircraft you want to correct. These are the files you need to replace:
1) Replace all B737ng_vc files
2) Replace B737ng_gauges file
3) Replace B737ng_gauges_I
4) Add B737ng_interior_material_t"
,fturnerj,2010-10-01T21:54Z,If you want the Flight Attendant view you need to copy the CameraDefinition 003 from the Boeing_737_900ER_FSX to the aircraft you want. Hope this helps.
,737300,2010-10-02T14:13Z,Thanks for that fturnerj I'll give that a go. :-)
