Synopsis:

The laughs last longer with the Date Night Extended Edition, which includes a never-before-seen version of the film with hilarious added footage not shown in theatres! Steve Carell and Tina Fey are â€œa match made in comedy heavenâ€ (Ben Lyons, E!) in this uproarious adventure about an ordinary couple in the right place...on the wrong night. Phil and Claire Foster are a sensible, suburban husband and wife slogging through their daily lives and marriage. But a case of mistaken identity sets off an outrageous chain of events involving small-time thieves, big-city mobsters, corrupt cops and a crazed cabbie, as the Fostersâ€™ â€œdate nightâ€ turns into a wild ride theyâ€™ll never forget!
