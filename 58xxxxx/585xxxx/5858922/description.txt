Cambridge CAE Skills offer a bridge between communicative methodology and the needs of the exam class. Designed to prepare students for the various CAE papers, these books also consider the four skills in their wider application through the use of exciting topics and enjoyable communicative activities. The skills relevant to Papers 4 and 5 are covered in this single book. Each unit is divided into two sections, one dealing with listening and the other with speaking, linked to a common topic. Topics are innovative and unusual, offering students a genuine stimulus for speaking activities. Exam Tips boxes give students detailed advice about what to expect during each of the CAE papers, and the book offers plenty of opportunity to practise the type of activities that will be encountered during the paired interview. The cassettes feature authentic recordings from diverse sources.................
