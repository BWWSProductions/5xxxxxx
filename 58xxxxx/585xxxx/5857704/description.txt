Prefab Sprout are an alternative English pop rock band from Witton Gilbert, County Durham, who rose to fame during the 1980s. Eight of their albums have reached the Top 40 in the UK Albums Chart, and one of their singles, "The King of Rock 'N' Roll", peaked at number seven in the UK Singles Chart.
The band formed in 1978 in Newcastle. Prefab Sprout have had minimal chart success in the United States. Their 1985 album Steve McQueen was released in the US as Two Wheels Good and peaked at number 180 in the Billboard 200. In spite of limited American success, frontman Paddy McAloon has been hailed as one of the greater songwriters of his era.
