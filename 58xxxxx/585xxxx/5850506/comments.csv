Video quality is great, as is the sound, but the sync just makes it unwatchable."
,siloin869,2010-10-12T11:05Z,"Can you upload the full disk:  menus, extras, etc.  Also, the torrent says disk 1/D1:  is there another disk you can put up as well.  Thank you."

When you can buy a cheap laptop on ebay for $40, get a 700Mb file instead of this shit? NO SENSE!"
