Ryzom, one of the best ROLE PLAYING Massively Multiplayer Online Game of the moment (MMORPG), is set more than 2000 years in the future, on a living, evolving world: beautiful Atys!

A unique virtual MMORPG world

Planet Atys is not only an MMORPG, but also a living, virtual world, with five rich and diverse ecosystems. A powerful AI technology makes flora and fauna interact dynamically with each other and the ever-changing environment. 
Our MMORPG is based on Freedom

Choose and fully customize a role-play or RPG character from any of the four races of our MMORPG. The skill-based action tree then allows you to gain experience in fighting, magic, crafting and/or foraging, and to fully customize your spells and special attacks (There are thousands of possible combinations!). 
Our MMORPG is Role-play oriented

Your role-play actions influence the story line of our MMORPG. Lots of large-scale Role-Play and RPG events are organized around playersâ€™ wishes.
Multiplayer Consensual PvP

Different types of PvP combat coexist in our MMORPG, and since not everyone likes PvP in an MMORPG, you can choose whether or not to get involved. If you are looking to engage in multiplayer combat, the game offers various possibilities: Duels, GvG, FvF and full PvP. 
Strong Role-play & RPG Community

Available in English, French and German, our MMORPG Ryzom enjoys a strong, friendly and mature role-play and RPG Community. The communication between developers and players is an essential component of the unceasing improvement work of our MMORPG.
