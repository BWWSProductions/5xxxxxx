,truthy,2010-10-04T21:43Z,"audio is messed up - dialogue only in one channel - forgot if it was frontleft or -right. switching to mono sucks, you can always remapp the channels (copy the 1 dialog channel to FL or FR) - far too much effort though. (conv to wav, wav --> 6 mono wavs - change channels --> 5.1) video quality is good."
