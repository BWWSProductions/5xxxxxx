    Paulette Girard .... Narrator (voice)                                    
                                                                             
    A Tokyo geisha travels through Japan, commenting on the history of       
    Japan, life in a big city, the ways of the ama - the girls who make a    
    living by diving as deep as 70 feet in the sea to cut off oysters        
    from the rocks, and collect pearls, with the help of just a knife or     
    a piece of metal -, the beautiful Japanese men, Shintoism, her life      
    as a geisha, Japanese night-life, cabarets and strip joints, revival     
    of samurai traditions, social customs like mixed nude bathing in         
    swimming pools, and life in small villages. The film is actually a       
    travelogue documentary, with just a little romance as the girl           
    narrator returns to the south coastal island where she had seen the      
    amas and the handsome fishermen, to try her capacities of being a        
    pearl diver (she succeeds) and then she ends up by marrying the young    
    man she had noticed earlier.
