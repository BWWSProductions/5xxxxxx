"Elementary School Musical"

When Krusty the Clown is announced as the 
recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Homer 
invites Bart to accompany him on a trip to 
Oslo for the ceremony. Sensing that Lisa 
would feel left out, Marge surprises her 
with a week-long retreat at performing arts 
camp, where she where she is greeted by her 
artsy counselors (guest voices Clement and 
McKenzie) and fellow musically inclined 
campers (guest voices Michele, Monteith and 
Riley), who inspire her to embrace her 
creative side. After she returns to 
Springfield, Lisa becomes restless with her 
ho-hum suburban lifestyle and sneaks off to 
Sprooklyn in hopes of connecting with her 
inner hipster, but she soon realizes that 
the city is not the same as camp.

Enjoy :)
