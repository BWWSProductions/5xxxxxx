From Recorded Books:

Time calls Philip Roth "the uncontested master of comic irony." He is a 
best-seller and the winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, the 
National Book Award, and the Pulitzer Prize in fiction. 

The Counterlife brings back Roth's most notorious character, the novelist 
Nathan Zuckerman. Now Nathanâ€™s married brother, Henry the dentist, is 
suffering from impotence as a result of taking heart medication-and he's 
willing to risk his life in a dangerous operation just to regain his 
sexual prowess in order to satisfy the needs of his office assistant.

From Salon.com

Over the past 30 years the 7?-year-old novelist has published the most 
ambitious literary series of our time: the Nathan Zuckerman books. Taken 
together, these eight interlocking volumes -- a trilogy and epilogue 
("Zuckerman Bound"), a stand-alone novel ("The Counterlife") and a second 
trilogy ("American Pastoral," "I Married a Communist" and "The Human Stain") 
-- form an awe- if not envy-inspiring masterpiece. Who knew that authors could 
still write on such a Proustian scale? The Zuckerman oeuvre weighs in at 2,215 
clothbound pages, not counting Nathan's letter to Roth in the author's 
autobiography ("The Facts").
