,Robin9876,2010-09-27T19:28Z,"Movie suck balls :( This new Freddy is a joke, not scary at all. Why the hell they are doing these remakes... just cashing? Puke...."
,baseketball,2010-09-28T00:17Z,"Great quality up. In my opinion the movie kind of sucks but still worth watching. 

Thanks"
,auras3124,2010-10-02T23:41Z,"Stop hatin', people. This movie isn't really meant for us that grew up watching the Englund movies. It's meant to introduce a new generation to the character and terror. Admit it, the old movies aren't scary these days. not a damn bit. This is meant for the younger generation that may have never seen the old ones."
,pigsikk,2010-10-03T11:54Z,this is better than the 1st nightmare on elm street

,xSteven77x,2010-10-12T19:20Z,"Good quality but...the movie is an absolute fucking disgrace to the franchise. It couldn't be anymore cliche in a bad way if it wanted to be. FUCKING JUNK DONT WASTE THE BANDWIDTH, TIME, ELECTRICITY."
,born2b,2010-10-14T01:49Z,Thanks!
,netrek,2010-10-14T06:33Z,"auras3124 you are retarded by asserting that all old horror movies aren't scary. What a stupid generalization and you're totally wrong. Most of my favorite horror movies are older movies, they knew how to make suspense and terror without tons of stupid gore and blood everywhere."

Seems like they had to dumb down the characters just to fit the retard plot.

Worst Acting, Not Scary, Not Cool.

Thanks extremzone., but what a waste of time...

It's pretty much the same old story though and without much imagination if you've seen the original."
,Roxy.J,2010-10-17T18:03Z,"I actually like this movie. Even though it's not as good as the original ones. I saw it in the movies and I was sitting on the edge of the seat the whole time. who cares if it's not EXACTLY like the original ones? sometimes you just need to stir things up. I do agree though, horror movies now a days are trying to hard to be scary, makes them look pretty lame.
Thanks for the upload :)"
,Childosun,2010-10-23T21:14Z,great download. ruined freddy for me. but thnx
,MiscFoxes,2010-10-24T22:10Z,"A/V is 10/10. 

I actually prefer Jackie Earl Haley over Robert Englund, though I guess that's because I never liked the original Nightmare on Elm Street movies... 

And speaking from that position, I didn't much like this movie either, lol. The plot was pretty darn weak to me, and the only thing I kept waiting for was more Freddy (there wasn't nearly enough!)"
,Arc101,2010-10-27T05:43Z,"DL-ing right now, though i got to agree with the discrition about imbd false ratings and bad comments >>"

,PsykoSaia,2011-01-10T00:05Z,"Dude, don't be that guy that CONSTANTLY is bashing remakes...If u hate the movie, or even the idea of the movie, don't watch it, don't dl, dont comment! I, personally like the fun of watching a movie with up to date cgi and effects, but thats not here nor there, we're here to critique a/v quality and dl troubleshooting, if u got a problem with the story, go to the tribe movie poopshoot site n bitch if u want, theres other sites, too...or make one!"

,0201bruno84st,2011-02-14T02:02Z,"With all due respect to old Elm St. movies with Englund (which were scaring me shitless when i was a kid), this remake can imo proudly carry the name of the franchise. Good short story (cutting to the core), some decent acting (something you dont come across very often these days) and some tasty white meat (no pun intended). All in all, big surprise (for me at least) since in the last decade good horror remakes have been few and far between. Gratz to all the crew involved. Deserves much bigger rating that the IMDB gave it. Jack E. Haley kicks ass as Freddy. Oh, and this release: A10 V10 And to all you who shit on this movie... sweet dreams tonight..."
,Cgoff87,2011-02-25T20:35Z,"Are you out of your fucking mind? This version is nothing like he old ones.. Exactly 20:00 minutes into the movie hes in a girls dreams inching his way to her while she is just standing there. He has no emotion whatsoever, just a terrifying voice as hes just inching his way to her step by step. M. Night Shamylan on the other hand in the older freddies, embued a feeling of confusion amongst his victims throught a kind of imaginative comedy he and still maintained that level of fear, with that motivation there, Robert Englund kicked ass! He made it as if it were a really crazy, funny, scary dream. This new guy  has no other emotion besides scary. Now you are seriously mistaken when you say this crap is just as good as the Nightmare on elm streets with John Englund. This movie is a shame to what the entire franchise stood for, and shouldn't even bear that title. 

And as for the director, Samuel Bayer, he has never even done serious screenplay before this movie, only music videos and music documentaries and shit. So who the fuck is he? Nobody. Hell, Rob Zombie could've done better if you wanted scary.

What we got here is (One of the biggest) abominations in movie history. Anyone who downloaded it here is right to do so, because this shit is not worth the money."
,dannieaston,2011-03-24T18:26Z,good quality seriously slow download watched it at uwatchfilmsonline.com in the end least it saves time downloading 
,dannieaston,2011-03-24T18:27Z,could not get it to play had to watch it at uwatchfilmsonline.com think it may of been my player tho oh well saves time from now on
