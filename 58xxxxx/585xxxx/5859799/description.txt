Contains all 7 episodes of the hilarious misfit comedy On The Air.

Videos were cut into individual episodes & encoded with HandBrake into H.264 MP4 files with AAC 128bit audio. 

The opening credits on the first episode had some tracking blips from the initial recording so I copied the credits from episode 2 which was free of errors.

All episodes are .m4v files but the extension can be changed to .mp4 for software that doesn't recognize the iPod extensions.

Episodes were tagged with MetaX using information from:
The Official Show Page - http://www.lynchnet.com/ontheair/ep.html

*I did NOT set cnIDs since it is not in the iTunes Store &, as far as I know, an HD version doesn't even exist.
*If You want the official Copyright info I could only find the one in the end credits: "copyright MCMXCII by ZOBLOTNICK BROADCASTING CORPORATION all rights reserved." but that didn't make it in before I created the Torrent
