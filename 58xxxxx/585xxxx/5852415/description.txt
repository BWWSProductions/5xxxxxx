The Strategic Infrastructure Security course picks up right where Tactical Perimeter Defense leaves off. The second course in the SCP line-up leads to a certification of Security Certified network  Professional (SCNP). It will give a network administrator the additional hands on skills needed to protect their network from the inside out. This course teaches you about prevention techniques as well as giving the candidate an understanding of risk analysis and security policy creation in a blended technology environment. The up-to-date security lessons and intense, hands-on labs bring a real world network security to training candidates.

The is the official training for the SCNP exam and is designed to validate the foundational skills required by security professionals. These skills include, but are not limited to: Cryptography, Hardening Linux Computers, Hardening Windows Computers, Ethical Hacking Techniques, Security on the Internet and World Wide Web, Performing a Risk Analysis, Creating a Security Policy and Analyzing Packet Signatures. Strategic Infrastructure Security replaces Network Defense and Countermeasures with updated technology and intense, hands- on labs.
