,janpeters1951,2010-11-01T13:42Z,"-Have xbox360 pal, flashed,this game works pefectly for me
1)download this  torrent to your pc
2. download Imgburn(free) and install on your pc
3) use a dual layer dvd and burnspeed as low as possible for the best quality ( max. 2 speed)
burn the *.dvd file and NOT the *.iso file
when you insert the dvd for the first time it wil ask to install an update. no problem to do so
after that run the game
enjoy
