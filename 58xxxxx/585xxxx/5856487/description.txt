A business fable for anyone feeling overwhelmed, underpaid, and frustrated in their job
From the author of The Myth of Multitasking comes Invaluable, a business fable that empowers the frustrated and overworked to understand the value of their time. At the fictitious company GreenGarb, twenty-something Jason is discontent in his entry-level position, feeling his skills and knowledge are being underutilized; mid-level manager Tracy is overwhelmed by her own workload and needy direct reports; and CEO Helen needs them to sort it out productively. Jason's grandfather Charlie plants the seed of a new perspective in Jason mind: before he can get a raise, he must prove he deserves the raise. 

He must establish the value of his time, rather than expecting to be paid what he thinks he is worth. Time management consultant Phil helps them determine how they spend their time, and what it costs, with easy-to-follow worksheets that map what their actions and time are worth.

â€¢Offers solid advice for determining just how "invaluable" you are to your boss and customers
â€¢Shows how to create a productive framework of cooperation in the workplace
â€¢Includes an appendix of worksheets and examples that offer concrete tools that can be applied immediately
The Myth of Multitasking taught readers how to take control of their time. Invaluable shows readers how to increase the value of the time they do spend working............................
