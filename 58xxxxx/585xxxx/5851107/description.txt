"In Re: Officer Daniel Hale"  

Garza (Jimmy Smits) and his team head to 
Arizona when an immigration stop turns 
into a police shooting. Eddie (Jesse 
Bradford) agrees with the decision to 
take the controversial case, while Al 
(David Ramsey) wonders why he ever 
joined Garza's team. Meanwhile, Lucinda 
(Carly Pope) encourages Mereta (Ellen 
Woglom) to make her big move for Garza.

Enjoy :)
