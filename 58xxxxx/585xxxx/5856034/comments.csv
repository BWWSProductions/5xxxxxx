[V],bigbluesea,2010-09-28T05:55Z,"Whats going on

Where are the seeders???????

Why are all the new uploads not seeding?????? "
,hafina,2010-09-28T08:15Z,The seeders are there. You just can't see them on the bay - but you will see them when you start downloading.
,grizzmo,2010-09-28T08:57Z,"All the MAK keys used up?

thx a lot for the teremendous work!
iÂ´ve a question 
--> iÂ´ve installed the premiere elements 9 (yours) + this premiere elements 9 content without problems BUT everytime i open the PRE i get a kind of error telling me something like: an uncomplete set of content ( InstantMovie submittals and menu submittals etc..) was installed - if you want to install the complete set of content, put in the DVD or download the content from the internet. (excuse my bad english ;) - i had to translate the error text from german)

I de-installed the content again, download it from the adobe page, insalled it again but still the same! 
Can you plz help me? did i miss smth?

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5850131

so install that first"
,swiri,2010-10-03T15:22Z,"@ thethingy

thx for the hlep man but itÂ´s still the same.
iÂ´ve installed everything in english this time, here is the ""error-text""--> A reduced set of contant ( Instant Movies Themes, Title and Menu Templates, etc) has been installed. You can install the full content by inserting your content DVD or downloading it. Do you want to install now?

i have installed it twice: 1st straight frim the new file you gave me, and deinstalled it again after i saw it was the same - the the 2nd time i burned it on a DVD first but no change although i got the positiv feedback in both cases telling that the installation of the content was successful ;(
"
[V],thethingy,2010-10-03T22:01Z,"swiri, did you select all of the content during the install?, there is about 8 different things?"
,swiri,2010-10-03T23:36Z,"well, if you mean the fields of the content to check on the InstallShield, yes i selected all of them. (there are only 6 to check by the way!) i made a screen shot of it, where can i post it?"
[V],thethingy,2010-10-04T14:47Z,"swiri, you can post screens with this;

[V],thethingy,2010-10-06T16:12Z,"swiri, try accessing the content and if its there and you can use it then just tick the dont show again box."
,swiri,2010-10-08T15:14Z,ok - thx a lot for taking time 2 help ;)
[V],thethingy,2010-10-08T16:11Z,"swiri , no problem, did it work?"
,swiri,2010-10-08T22:02Z,"well, it might sound stupid but i really i didn´t figure out how to know if i DO access the content (or not) from the main PR window yet. I´ll let you know anyway.

Cheers"
,swiri,2010-10-11T21:11Z,"@ thethingy

well, as far as i can judge, everything works well so far :) "
,Shrededbeef,2010-11-23T06:26Z,Hi Thethingy! Thank's for your great uploads! I've been downloading (and seeding) your staff lately! My question is if there's the way to activate this? Thank's ahead!
,OCFreak,2010-12-22T21:55Z,"I still don't get how to access these? When I have installed everything, I try to open Pre9 and when I select ""PLUS members"" only type content it shows nothing. 

Where does this install the content to and how do you access it?

Thanks in advance."
,jwillrmmg,2011-03-18T16:04Z,Thanks again.

 Im confused.. in the download description it says
"" You need Premiere Elements 9 Installed first for this' (then link)"" do i have to go and download that one first? then come back to this download and download it?
and, how do i activate it? Thanks :)"
,hockeykid45,2011-05-24T23:47Z,"@ thethingy
Im confused, in the download description it says ""You need Premiere Elements 9 installed first for this; (download link)"", do i have to go and install that first, then download this one? or can i just download one of them, and another question, 
Are there already activated? or does it come with a crack or something?
thanks:)"
