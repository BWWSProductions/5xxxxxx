multiplayer lan mode howto:

- backup steamclient.dll
- open steamclient.dll in any hex editor.
- search for SKIDROW â€“ first match at 0Ã—31040 is it. you see pid before, SAVES after
- change SKIDROW to any other name â€“ keep it 7 charakters length
- save it
- start civ5, host a lan game, check if your name has changed (if it didnt work, you messed something up - try again)
- if so, you can now play lan games with friends (even over openvpn) since everyone got another name

have fun with friends ^^"

,TheFacts,2010-09-25T01:59Z,"@cal001: sounds good - you can play. anyways: stable at low settings, unstable at high settings - maybe you should run a heat-benchmark like furmark in heat-mode. perhaps your computer only crashes if some circuts are used very much, so the temperature exceeds a certain level and everything goes south.

of course, the demo running without problems doesnt fit my idea. but since it seams to run at other people, test your hardware to make sure."

You have to install the game first by running the autorun.exe file.

2. Don't click setup, but click installer.exe and go from there

3. You might need to click repair for c++ redistibutable.

4. select all inside the SKIDROW folder on the disc image, then copy and paste it into the folder Civ5 installed in.

5. Click launcher in that folder.

How do you suppose the others using XP have done it? Magic? 
Clearly it isn't XP that is the problem, and there is some other variable involved. 

For example, I haven't gotten this running on Win7 64-bit. If I've seen that others have run this on the same OS I have, I would appear thoroughly mentally deficient were I to say ""It just doesn't work on Win7 64-bit! I'll just wait for a version of this that werkz."""

And when I ""talk"" with other leaders I can do stuff for about 2 seconds, then the screen freezes or lags or whatever for about 8-12 seconds and then everything runs smoothly. 

Even the intro fucks with me, it takes it about 8-15 seconds to cancel after I've pressed the escape key.

Does anyone else have that problem? Is there a fix? Is it my comp or the game? I've tried both Skidrow's and Articone's copies, same problem with both.

,odytzi,2010-09-28T04:18Z,"1.0.0.20 patched for Civ V Released

    * Modding - Installer and permissions fixes. Should address any remaining mod download and install issues.
    * Full screen crash fix. Game will now restart in Windowed mode if it cannot find a suitable full-screen resolution on first start.
    * Hall of Fame now records data correctly when using a Windows username with special characters.
    * Fix for Puppet State production exploit.
    * Misc crash fixes.
    * Special character fix for Windows usernames: Users with non-english characters in their windows username would experience a game crash. This has been fixed, and a forthcoming fix will address an issue related to this where game victories are not recorded in the Hall of Fame.
    * Default resolution fix for DX9: Some users who have non-standard or below the minimum specification resolutions crashed before starting. Now, the system will change to Windowed mode and start so it does not crash.
    * AI city weighting: AI will not quite as freely offer up their cities when asking for peace.
    * Gold per turn glitch: When agreeing to a deal for anything above 5 gold per turn in exchange for something else (like a luxury), the deal would always only pay 5 gold per turn, regardless of the amount proposed. This has been corrected.

But when i launch, i get a split second black window and its gone. Thats it, no movie, no nothing. If I open task manager i see 'civ5.exe' running, and after a split second black window its just gone!

I did change the .ini file (to stop intro the window res was already set to 1024x768) and installed reinstalled and repaired. 

Still same effect.

Thank you Skidrow. You always have the best torrents. Your work is appreciated.
I got lucky and downloaded the torrent last night in about 70 minutes. I think that's a record. ;)
The game works perfectly for me, with no problems whatsoever. I'm using Win 7 Ultimate - 32 bit.
However, when I first installed it, it wouldn't install because of problems with Steam. Then I came here to read the comments and the first one to solve the problem was Jack Spencer, so thank you, Jack.

So for those who read this in the future:
INSTALL THE GAME USING INSTALLER.EXE AND NOT SETUP.EXE.

I noticed tons of people were having problems and some people criticized them and called them crybabies. To be fair to everyone, the readme file that accompanies the torrent says this:

 1. Unpack release
 2. Mount image or burn it
 3. Install
 4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD to your installation directory and overwrite
 5. Play the game

Note that it simply says Install. That's what's causing the problem. It should have said, Install using Installer.exe and not setup.exe and it would have saved a lot of headaches for people.

Anyway, the bottom line is it's working perfectly now and thanks again to Skidrow."

,pwxyj,2010-10-07T16:54Z,"DomFontana, 

The people who are angry (including me) are angry and frustrated because we have tried EVERYTHING. I've searched nearly all of the forums I can find and there are still people experiencing my problems, not with the torrent but with the game. I feel sorry for the people who bought this game via steam (burn in hell, fucktards) or in a retail shop. The game simply won't work. Using install.exe instead of setup (with the STEAM ICON) should be something 2% of the users get wrong. 
If ANYBODY, ANYWHERE has an idea what the problem could be please comment. 
I've tried:

Updating it
Using another crack
Updating my direct x, graphics driver, audio driver and all of the other drivers that COULD cause the problem
I've skipped the intro
I've changed the resolution in graphics.ini
I've changed the resolution on my desktop
I've set it on windowed mode
I've runned it in compability mode
I've runned it as administrator
I've deleted the cache DB* files 
My computer meets the reqs
I have done EVERYTHING and STILL the SAME FUCKING MESSAGE! (sid meiers whorefuck-bastard game of civilizatiwhore has stopped behaving like a regular game because of it's whoriness) and NOTHING more, NO ERROR LOG - NOTHING. 

Let me clarify again, I have tried EVERYTHING!
so, if anybody has a NEW idea or a fix, I humbly beg of you to post it here couse this fucking problem is driving me crazy. 

FUCK VISTA, The inbred freak that came out when Gates raped xp and is now terrorising the world like those hills have eyes creatures, yeah, that's right, Win Vista deserves a role as a monster in hills have eyes 3. He can be a freak that just won't do anything an everytime another monster asks him to help out raping the humans, he has ""stopped working and needs to shut down "". Vista would even suck as a freak, it would just go around pissing the other freaks off.   The story of Microsoft and there OP is very similiar to the Fritzl story. Gates raped it's own OP (win98) and keeps having inbred babies (vista, 7) and it will keep happen till somebody expose the incestrapewhorefuck that goes on. 

Walk in Peace. "

Make sure you have all files and the required permissions to install.   

Even when running as admin.  Any suggestions?"
,AfterJerk,2010-10-11T02:27Z,"@dexterneo and anyone else who doesn't know how to find the Skidrow directory.
If you have the ISO file mounted onto your drive (using daemon tools I believe it does an autorun) instead of using the autorun which would probably use the setup.exe you want to open the files. If there is no autorun that pops up then go into my computer, go to the drive, right click then go to open. It should bring up a directory that has all the information that is in the ISO file. On the top you should have two or three folders. Open the skidrow file then copy all of the content in that file and paste it into the installed directory for the game and overwrite all files. This should put the crack into your folder and overwrite the default launcher with the new cracked one. Either launch directly or create a shortcut on your desktop and you're good to go. Hopefully this helps anyone who could possibly be having problems with this."

1. Mount with Daemon Tools
2. Open download and install the proper exe.
In this case the installer exe. and not the setup exe. Then copy of the disc the skid row and paste in the program folder.
3. after install open the skidrow file in the programs x86 and copy everything.
4. click back arrow and paste.
5. right click on the proper civ exe and send to desktop.
6. Play
As far as the updates just copy everything to the program folder install from there and re-copy the contents of the new skidrow file.

If you need to play online change your name in the config file that was created after the patch in your documents.

If this doesn't work then its not the game because there is no other way to do it.
I have installed on 3 different computers in my house and they all play fine on the local network even.

Reasons that people have problems are because of either updates needed, outdated computers, corrupted profiles from infections, lack of following instructions, and many more.

I followed this way (by @tetris11) and install it on Win7 without problem.

Installation:
1. Mount the iso with daemon tools
2. Use the Skidrow installer to extract the files
3. My computer prompted that I was up to date with Directx 11 -> okay
4. At the end of the installer I got another window asking me to install Direct x -> Yes install/Next
5. I get another window asking me to either repair or uninstall Microsoft C++ Redistributable -> Click Repair/Install, never uninstall.
6. Exit/Close the Skidrow installer (i.e. when it's finished).
7. Go to My Computer -> Right-Click on the BD ROM/mounted Civilization iso-> open -> SKIDROW -> Copy everything with Ctrl+A and then Ctrl+C
8. Go to Program Files(x86) or just Program Files -> Sid Meier's Civilization V -> Paste everything with Ctrl+V.
9. When asked to merge folders, Copy and replace, etc. say Yes to everything, and tick the box that enables you to do it for all the future conflicts (quicker).

10. Double click Launcher (or create shortcut on desktop) --> Play!"

Also people: get a peer blocker program if you're on a PC like PeerBlock.. anti p2p companies and spammer companies seed existing downloads with intentionally corrupted files containing viruses which in turn make perfectly clean torrents... filthy and useless... like people who don't seed's mothers.... you will be shocked once you have peer block up and running."

For those using Windows 7 x64 Ultimate and having the problem where it crashes after the intro;

1) Download this; http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&displaylang=en
(its just the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008, I just knew that this one works, just in case.)

2) Go to Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 5 and open 'UserSettings',  change the 15th line so that it looks like this...
; Skip the intro video
SkipIntroVideo = 1
and save.

3) in the same folder, open up 'GraphicsSettingsDX11'
change 7th from bottom to
; Fullscreen mode
FullScreen = 0 

In the installation folder I also ran 'CivilizationV_DX11' in admin.

Make sure that you transferred the files in the info section from the cd tho!

took me ages to work this all out, I'm a complete noob!"

C:/Program Files (x86)/Sid Meirs Civilization 5"

It says 'steam_api.dll is missing"
[T],Skymocker,2011-08-05T23:19Z,"Here's What other commentors have successfully compiled...

Installation:
1. Mount the iso with daemon tools
2. Use the Skidrow installer to extract the files
3. My computer prompted that I was up to date with Directx 11 -> okay
4. At the end of the installer I got another window asking me to install Direct x -> Yes install/Next
5. I get another window asking me to either repair or uninstall Microsoft C++ Redistributable -> Click Repair/Install, never uninstall.
6. Exit/Close the Skidrow installer (i.e. when it's finished).
7. Go to My Computer -> Right-Click on the BD ROM/mounted Civilization iso-> open -> SKIDROW -> Copy everything with Ctrl+A and then Ctrl+C
8. Go to Program Files(x86) or just Program Files -> Sid Meier's Civilization V -> Paste everything with Ctrl+V.
9. When asked to merge folders, Copy and replace, etc. say Yes to everything, and tick the box that enables you to do it for all the future conflicts (quicker).

10. Double click Launcher (or create shortcut on desktop) --> Play!


HOW I GOT LAN FUNCTIONING...

The game won't let two people with the same name (IE Skidrow) into the same game, so...

1.  Open C:\Program Files\Sid Meier's Civilization V
2.  Locate at the bottom of the list a file called Steamclient.DLL
3.  Right-Click on it & select 'open with' (then select the program to use yourself).  I used notepad, but wordpad, etc., should work fine.
4.  Hit CTRL+F and search for ""skidrow"".  There are two instances of the name within the gibberish you'll be looking at.
5.  Replace the word Skidrow with your own screenname.
6.  Save.

Don't be alarmed if you get an error message about something being wrong with the file you just edited when launching the game.  Simply hit OK and the game will continue to launch.

I haven't tested this on hamachi, but it does work over an actual router.
my OS is Win 7 if it matters."

,Dzulum,2011-08-11T08:30Z,"URGENT HELP PLEASE!

0. I have Windows 7 64 bit and an adequate PC.
1. I downloaded the torrent.
2. The torrent IS NOT an ISO image. It's a RAR file that contains a bunch of files and folders. There is not an Skidrow folder in it. I extracted the whole thing to C:\Program Files (x86)\sid meier's civilization v, and changed the ""Play Civilization V"" shortcut accordingly.
4. I have tried clicking on the shortcut, choosing either ""Play with Direct X 9 or 10"" or ""Play with Direct X 11"", but nothing works. The following error message appears: The program can't start because d3dx9_42.dll is missing from your computer.  Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.""
5. I do have Direct X 11 previously installed in my computer.

YOUR HELP IS GREATLY APPRECIATED!!! THANKS A LOT!!!"

,mevidek,2011-09-01T20:10Z,"@Dzulum - a helpful tip for most torrent games: The RAR files contain the iso. Open the first RAR file, extract it to a folder on your desktop, and/or mount the iso from the extracted folder or in the RAR file. It's that simple. The crack will be found in the skidrow folder or a crack folder on the iso file, which is like a disc. To find it, right click on the iso file once mounted, click explore, and then just find the folder, and copy the cracked content to the installation directory. Hope that helped :D"

I often find a rash of complaints under either Games or Video about all the horrible experiences people are having in getting something running.  If it's simply frustration in not getting something to work on your machine, that's fine.  But to have the audacity to insult the person(s) who uploaded it, and have even attempted to correct any problems with it, is beyond my comprehension.  That's the kind of asshole who would crawl into your kitchen after two weeks in the desert, begging for something to drink... and when you hand him a glass of water, he says, ""What, no lemonade?""  

I have Win 7 64-bit, like many others here.  I mounted and loaded this game, used the supplied crack, and it works fine.  If you're having problems, please read others posts before complaining (there's typically plenty of fixes already posted).  If you're frustrated, and I understand if you are, please be conscientious in your posts.  If you have lame computer, or don't know what the hell you're doing, don't compound the problem by telling the uploader it's THEIR fault.  You just end up sounding petty and childish."
