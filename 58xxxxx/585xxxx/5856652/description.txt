"2021 Vision"

Naomi (AnnaLynne McCord) has constant flashbacks 
to her rape and begins taking sleeping pills in 
order to sleep through the night. Mr. Cannon 
(guest star Hal Ozban, Californication) invites 
Silver (Jessica Stroup) over to his apartment to 
watch his new documentary and secretly slips 
something in her drink. Meanwhile, Teddy (Trevor 
Donovan) wakes up from a night of drinking and 
realizes he hooked up with someone. Dixon 
(Tristan Wilds) learns that, despite what he 
assumed, Ivy (Gillian Zinser) is a virgin. Annie 
(Shenae Grimes) confronts her boss, Katherine 
(guest star Lisa Waltz, General Hospital) about 
her awkward behavior and is shocked when she 
makes her an offer she may not be able to 
refuse. Adrianna (Jessica Lowndes) sings a new 
stolen song at a memorial service but she soon 
regrets her decision to do so when the video 
goes viral on the web.

Enjoy :)
