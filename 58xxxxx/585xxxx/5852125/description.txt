
The architect Michael Newman has a typical middle-class family with his lovely
and gorgeous wife Donna and their son Ben and daughter Samantha, and a constant
visit of his parents. However, Michael is workaholic and under stress, trying to
satisfy his boss with overwork and get a partnership in his company, giving
priority to his work and neglecting the family issues. When the tired Michael
goes to a department store to buy an universal remote control, he rests on a
bed and he meets the weird salesman Morty that offers him a remote control
capable of controlling his own universe. Michael uses too much and loses the
control of the device, having his own life controlled by the remote control.
Then Michael sees the worthwhile parts of his personal life he missed while working,
and in the end of his life he lately concludes that the family comes first.
