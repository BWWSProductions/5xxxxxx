,pyroman6x9x9,2010-09-27T23:57Z,"For those using a xbox usb controller and the option to enable the controller is greyed out, here's a fix that works and i have been using it for the last 3 days once I figured it out.
First you need to download x360ce, you can get it here:
http://code.google.com/p/x360ce/downloads/list
Place it in your dead rising 2 install directory and run it. Once in x360ce load the ""controller (xbox 360 wireless reciever) preset then go to the advanced tab and disable ""native mode"" by unchecking it. Go to the force feedback tab and uncheck ""enable force feedback"". Then go to the options tab and set ""fake mode"" to compatibility. Now click save at the bottom, close x360ce and launch dead rising2, you can now enable it under pc settings in the options menu and all controls are pre mapped. As x360ce was run from the game folder this will not have any affect on the controller for other games.

x360ce basically creates a an xinput dll file to allow the controller to run outside of GFWL. "

,jester718,2010-09-28T23:48Z,"TO GerQ!!!! 
Try making a new user account with comp administator rights on your windows xp using a simple name like ""dodo"".  Then start dead rising 2 when using the new account. 
Because the game itself changes the name of the folder in C:/documents&settings/yourusername adding symbols in dr2 save game folder and causes corrupted save game data message. I had the same problem and this pretty lame method helped :)"

,D4681,2010-10-01T05:17Z,does anyone have their own personal way of saving the game and playing multiplayer?I want to try to use hamachi to play lan over the internet.
,rez11,2010-10-01T18:17Z,"For those with MSVCR100.dll errors, its simple, just google MSVCR100.dll download, then find a reliable website and download it, place it in your DR2 folder, where the .exe's are"
,fleebus,2010-10-03T13:55Z,"this not only works, it saves the game without any problems. I have games for windows installed already on my pc, but dr2 doesnt even seem to load it. guess it doesnt even need it to save. anyway, YES this does work. don't forget to google for the missing dll file and put it in your dr2 directory, then lower your pc sound settings in windows to  so it doesnt crash."

1....burn the downloaded game on a 4gb cd(except the CAB file Media 4)
2....after the burn just run the game from the cd withoume any crack!
3....If you wanna save your progress then you need to make an offline account on The GFWL support...because the key from another game doesent work on this one game..thats just sad...(for those who understand what i mean)"
