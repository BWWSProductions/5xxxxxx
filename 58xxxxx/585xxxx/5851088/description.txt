Formula 1 2010
Italian Grand Prix Qualifying.

Jake Humphrey introduces live coverage from Monza as qualifying begins for
the 2010 Italian Grand Prix. Red Bull Racing's Sebastian Vettel has been the
most consistent performer during qualifying this season, but could only
manage ninth on the starting grid in Italy in 2009. Lewis Hamilton was the
man who roared his way to pole position, ahead of Force India's Adrian Sutil,
who also put in a fine display to complete the front row of the grid by
qualifying in second position.
