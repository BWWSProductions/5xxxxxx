Review
"From the first moment I heard Emily sing, I knew that she was specialâ€¦she graces the English folk scene" --Shirley Collins.

"This is a remarkable work by a singer and writer so totally consumed by folk song and storytelling that she s moved to interpret and reposition it in such a boldly individual fashion." --fRoots 
Uncut, June 2010
A bewitching collection from one of the new British folk scene's most beguiling presences - **** 

Underpined by fables and folklore, then characterised by the slenderest melodic lines from sumptuously recorded guitar, harp and strings 'The Glamoury' encapsulates the mood of Shirley Collins and Karine Polwart. However, there's also an additional genreless contemporary quality contained in these addictive stories that fans of artists as far flung as Joanna Newsom could appreciate. 

Wrapped in Emily Portman's distinctive voice the whole mood is highly artistic, yet at its heart is a wellspring of very real human emotion: Fabulous 21st century folk!
