,edward1988,2010-09-27T19:36Z,"well this is the first time that i m writing a comment in this site , but after all the efforts done by Mr: TDMK1 i felt compelled to address  my gratitude to this guy who made it possible for us f1 fans to watch all the gand prixs in places where nobody cares about formula 1 .
So from all my heart i wish all the best for what you are doing and see you guys at suzuka."

,Lm602,2010-09-29T02:30Z,"the only advice i have for you is to put the practices on also. I would greatly appreciate that. but other than that i am very grateful of what you do. i live in America (unfortunately) and some people don't even know what f1 is. and the only way i can watch it on TV is on the speed channel. and they don't know what they're talking about. plus the bbc's commentators are some of, if not the best ever. Thanks again! :)"
,digimike50,2010-09-29T02:54Z,"I concur with the other commentators - without you we would have nothing to look forward to, F1-wise! Thanks very much!"
