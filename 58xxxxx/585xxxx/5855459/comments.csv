,IRE89,2010-10-01T06:42Z,"all you fuckin guys are fuckin homos you copy this shit from one fuckin guy and every copy is 20 minutes short and it leaves out an important fuckin part of the fuckin plot it would be fuckin easier for me to fuckin go to the fuckin movie myself and fuckin record it you dumb fuckin cunts don't bother DLing this fuckin shit anyway, the audio and video are watchable but who wants to see a movie with the car chase and basically the entire ending missing, the guy that filmed this must've really had to fuckin pee or something to leave those fuckin parts out."
,EinStupid,2010-10-02T15:07Z,Assholes to to those who appreciate uppers efforts are growing faster and faster. Can someone write a program to rid TPB of these fools.   Wishful thinking on my part.  THANKS SAFCUK
,IRE89,2010-10-05T08:40Z,"@ElnStupid he downloaded the torrent from someone else and then reuploaded it as his, he didn't actually do any work in this he just pawned someone elses shit copy off as his own. I've downloaded every copy of the town on here and all of them are exactly the same."
,IRE89,2010-10-05T08:43Z,"I appreciate everyone who takes the time, effort, and the risks to upload everything, not people who steal the original uploaders copy and pawn it off as their own. Especially when the original copy was watchable but left 25 minutes of the movie out."
,bc1990,2010-11-09T12:34Z,"are you guys really getting angry about a torrent? if you want to see all of the movie, go to the fucking theater."
,rexytheman,2010-11-12T17:03Z,@IRE89 isnt it funny how you complain about people stealing the vid and pawning it of as their own because isnt that what this website is based on? stealing other peoples work and pawing it off as their own?
