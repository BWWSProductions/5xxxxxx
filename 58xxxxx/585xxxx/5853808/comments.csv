,AMoveFan,2010-09-27T00:58Z,What up Felony lol so my question is I see someone on here that has a Nightmare on Elm street torrent but he uploaded it in only 472.1 mb is it possible that it is in blue ray quality because I usually know when it is in blue ray quality when the size is about 2 gb or over then that's when you get the good picture but is it worth downloading it in that small of a file Thanks ? 
,AMoveFan,2010-09-27T00:59Z,"O and btw I decided to go with your upload, because Idk about mb I don't trust that will be a good enough picture for me ."
,Screamokid,2010-09-27T23:02Z,"Hey AMoveFan, yes, go with this torrent, it will definately be far better quality than something around a tenth of it's size, it'll have a higher bitrate in both sound and image. I'm downloading the movie now :)"
,AMoveFan,2010-09-28T03:40Z,"just as I thought this was an exact blue ray upload it's a pretty picture nice 1 Felony, you should watch that 472 mb upload and tell me how crapy of a picture you think it is, #1 issue I had with it and I like quality is it was blurry really bad and it had some sort of logo that was stuck on the bottom right hand corner of the screen I think it said something like this uploader of the 472 mb sucks lol anyway very nice upload Felony."
,AMoveFan,2010-09-28T03:43Z,1 last thing I really enjoied this movie or story or plot to this Nightmare on Elm Street because it tells everything and if I remember correctly the other nightmare on elm streets didn't tell the story of Freddy Kruger. ? 
,AMoveFan,2010-09-28T04:19Z,do you know when Knight and Day will be released ?
