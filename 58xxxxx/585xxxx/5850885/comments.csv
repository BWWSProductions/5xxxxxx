,nawangweallan,2010-09-25T10:25Z,Is it just me or you can't save the game?
,rocco_sifredi,2010-09-25T19:28Z,"what a shit game...This is an INSULT for Tomb Raider fans.I saw today the game, first hand, and I'm glad I didn't pay for that abomination. Avoid it at all cost."

,caracan,2010-09-26T13:44Z,We waiting for confirmation that torrent is full of viruses .. Anyone ?
,Furious1964,2010-09-26T19:19Z,Can anyone tell me what this nfoviewer is? It comes up clean with NIS 2011 but I don't want to take any chances if it's a new virus.
,Furious1964,2010-09-26T19:21Z,"@caracan: It can't be full of viruses as the uploader is a VIP, I've d/led from him before and he always releases stuff WITHOUT any garbage in it."
,Furious1964,2010-09-26T21:17Z,Is there anything wrong with the archive? I just d/led it and WinRAR says it's corrupted and can't open it. It also has no icon for the exe.
,Furious1964,2010-09-27T02:47Z,"Somewhere along the line, the packing went FUBAR. D/led it 3 times with the same results. Please fix this."
,Furious1964,2010-09-27T05:05Z,"D/led for the third time, scanned and it came up clean, then ran the thing. It took 10 minutes to try and install, but then NIS 2011 found an infoseeker.gampass trogen hidden in the install.exe. Was found by SONAR. Will wait for a scene release unless someone can confirm this is a false positive."
,xaleel,2010-09-27T07:23Z,reminds me of trine
,Furious1964,2010-09-27T14:00Z,Will there be a scene release or is this it?
,lucasla,2010-09-27T20:33Z,It's possible to play this version online with Hamachi?
,aIcows,2010-09-29T03:14Z,"Norton found Infostealer.Gampass: ""Hundreds of users in the Norton Community have used this file. This file risk is high. Programs that infect other programs, files, or areas of a computer by inserting themselves or attaching themselves to that medium.""

I would wait for a scene release."

,PleaseDontBanMe,2010-09-29T16:09Z,Also I recommend the globe release titled PC ĂÂť LARA CROFT AND THE GUARDIAN OF LIGHT Full Game directplay. Faster download and multiple confirmations that it works fully.

,mas111,2010-10-01T19:46Z,"This is NOT a Tomb Rider game! It is probably some license stuff with Lara Croft. but it looks quite fun. Will try it.

Cheers Pirates!"
,megaone6,2010-10-02T08:26Z,"thiefdeluxe and forcepsdragonlord: it freezed for me too, but i restarted some time and it worked!!!"
,JesiahCarver,2010-10-05T14:43Z,"This has nothing to do with the uploader but the game itself is lame. Trust me, you want to save yourself the time. lol"

,remedy2,2010-10-14T01:13Z,@chrispeat- What antivirus program are you using?  Not getting any detects here although I'm just using Microsoft Security Essentials.  
,remedy2,2010-10-14T03:37Z,Ok I just downloaded Norton 2011 and scanned this file- nothing was detected.  I also scanned my computer after I installed this torrent and nothing was detected.  Not sure what you guys came up with but both Norton and Microsoft Security said it's clean.

,Miczila,2010-10-20T21:33Z,"if your game crashes where mine does try this 
when lara is hang from the last grapple on level 1
 after climbing the moving wall  after you get her to
the top and before the big explosion JUST lay off the keys let the explosion happen it should'nt kill her and not touching the key seems to keep it from crashing "
