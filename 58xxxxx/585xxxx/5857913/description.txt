Two guys by the name of Silas and Jamal decided to one day smoke something magical, which eventually helps them to ace their college entrance exam. This eventually lands them in Harvard, where they're surrounded by the world of Ivy Leaguers. Although their new lifestyle is much different from back home, they kept on having fun until their supernatural smoke runs out. Now, they are on their own and they have to rely on each other to survive.

Drug enthusiast and chemical master Silas and his friend Jamal lose their best friend Ivory to a disturbing pot related dread-lock fire, growing a pot plant in his ashes they use his heavenly connections to hook them up with all the knowledge they need to make it to Harvard... where they change the lives of the up-tight ivy league in the way only good stoner's can.
