,AMoveFan,2010-10-01T03:31Z,Just the movie itself sucks but the uploader did ok I am wandering why in some dark scenes you can see a few pixles Idk if that is the same thing with blue ray or not I haven't watched a regular blue ray disc in a while i'm wandering if the blue ray disc is clearer and crisper then a blue ray upload or if there is no difference if anybody can answer this question or if the uploader uploaded this on a high speed instead of a lower speed which would've been more accurate and cleaner ? Thank u sir for sharing and I use bs player pro it's 1 of the best players out there vlc SUCKS.
