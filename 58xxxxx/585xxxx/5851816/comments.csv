If you have problems not finding a serial key...Try 00000-00000-00000-00000-00000.

This bypassed that screen for me and enabled me to install the game."

,Dogman78,2010-09-30T20:20Z,"1st attempt: mount iso with magic disk \ install \ InstallProduct Error: 0x80070643 = no love.

2nd attempt: unziped iso \ install from the directory \ InstallProduct Error: 0x80070643 = no love.

3rd attempt: installed winlive \ install DR2 with firewall and antivirus off \ InstallProduct Error: 0x80070643 = unhappy face.

system = win xp pro SP3 duel core 2g-ram 

any suggestions?"
,Dogman78,2010-10-01T04:41Z,"Adding and/or replacing the .dll to win 32 did not fix the install error, it was worth a shot though. Seen a few people with the same error im getting but it seems like the install works for the majority of downloaders. Maybe it has to do with our systems."
,silversurfer007,2010-10-02T07:44Z,"bloodomen5, thanks a lot man! it worked perfect!

you need to add the msvcr100.dll to the folder's game not to windows folder.

I have mine installed D:\Dead Rising 2  different hard drive."

,lotzalaughs94,2011-03-12T23:45Z,"I found the solution to the save problem...

What you have to do is

1- copy every file from DR2 to the DR2 installation folder on your pc.

2- crack the game

3- run the game as admin

and its done...

it worked for me"
,Zerohour12,2011-04-30T11:27Z,"This is one tough torrent for me. I just CAN'T get it to work. I've done the msvcr100.dll thing and cracked the game. When i start the game, the black screen comes up and in a few moments, it says that Dead Rising 2 is not responding.... -.- anyone ?"
,SirLeeX,2011-06-10T17:58Z,"I made a user just to say:
Unrar the one called sr-dr2.iso (only that one!)
2. Mount it with MagicDisc etc.
3. go to computer -> dead rising 2 -> setup.exe, run it!
4. Follow on screen, serial: 0000-0000-0000-0000 etc.
5. find the installation folder for Dead rising on your cdrive!
6. Copy EVERYTHING inside the skidrow folder over to the installation folder on ur cdrive!

Hopefully i cleared up some problems, noobs be crazy!"
,NewRasputin,2011-07-03T01:07Z,The game just crashes and says Dead Rising has stopped working. help?
