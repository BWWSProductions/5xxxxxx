@fr3ak82 : My main formats are 272p and 320p. In this case, 720p is not doable."
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-26T18:59Z,"@fr3ak82: ""finally revolver.""

27 HOURS for my response (other have turned blind eye, right?) hardly qualifies as ""finally"".

BTW, doing 720p takes more than double of my PC time, needs more space on server and - you haven't payed a dime - just have asked. Be reasonable. Revolver is old movie and would be downloaded maybe 24 times.

480p is by nature, next best thing. True Guy Richie fan cannot be disappointed with 720x304 and not 2 GB - but 500 MB in perfect quality.

If anybody asks for more - one should start buying BluRay originals."
