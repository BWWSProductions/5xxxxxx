Introduction
Digital painting is huge! Itâ€™s a modern, creative
medium that is growing rapidly and is being used
in so many industries and by so many individuals â€“
hobbyists and professionals alike. This book is just a
slice of whatâ€™s out there in the digital painting world,
but within this â€œsliceâ€ we aim to offer a comprehensive
cross-section of tips and techniques from some of
the most accomplished digital artists in the industry
today. We cover a wide variety of popular subjects,
from aliens, creatures and humans through to robots,
cityscapes and natural environments, including
weather effects and many more. The styles we cover
vary from speed painting, offering a more traditional
impressionistic style, through to setting up the many
custom brushes that can provide precise, technical and
often time-saving techniques.
Speaking of traditional media, it is important to remember
that digital painting is becoming more widely accepted
and highly regarded as the techniques and resulting
imagery advance. Long gone is the time of sceptics who
regarded painting with the aid of hardware and software
as cheating; the artist still needs to be just as talented
as ever before to produce the breathtaking work you can
see throughout these pages. However, with the benefi ts
that digital painting offers, such as increased speed,
freedom to experiment, effi cient workfl ows and ease of
sharing work with online communities, more and more
artists are discovering and embracing this incredible
medium. And with guides such as this book, we strive
for everyone interested in digital art to be the best they
possibly can be by learning from the mastersâ€™ tutorials,
whilst being inspired by their gallery images.
