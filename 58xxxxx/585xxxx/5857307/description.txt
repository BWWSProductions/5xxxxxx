A compelling tale of forgiveness and reconciliation that parallels the Biblical story of Jacob and Esau.

Twin bothers Ethan and Jack struggle over their birthright - ownership of their father's business, The Abrams Group, and a treasured family heirloom. But when their father Ike dies, Ethan and Jack find nothing is as they thought it would be. An irreversible decision is made by their mother that damages the very fabric of the family. Ethan finds he must confront the choices of the past and the hurt and anger that poison his spirit. If he succeeds, he will discover the power that forgiveness holds.
