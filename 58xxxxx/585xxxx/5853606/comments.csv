,rippoff,2010-09-26T17:18Z,"Tackar, väntar redan på nästa serie.

Jag tycker också att det är bättre 
med en stor torrent."
,psycho1976,2010-10-04T01:54Z,"Thanks for the upload....Albeit a few things to consider:
-Don't rar/compress the files. Especially not into one, single large one as that simply ruins the point of doing it in the first place. (Rar'ed files are nice to use IF you are afraid of the files being corrupted in transfer, which torrent doesn't)
-Better to have the 5 discs spread out as we can then choose what part we want. Now we are forced to download the entire 20GB file.
-Seed more? Been downloading for 3, almost 4 entire days and still lacking 10 GB....

Keep up the good work feller and don't let my suggestions dishearten you. :)"

According to rar etc etc.

I think itâ€™s better to make a torrent/movie. And about format. If itâ€™s the video-files you can always reload your burned copy/copies and help seedingâ€¦

I have been helped and also helped other guys that wayâ€¦.

,Mr.Cheese,2011-03-20T16:21Z,I will stop seeding when some have got 100 %. Then someone else will have to take the baton.
,Bosse6614,2011-05-03T17:45Z,Tackar för denna uppladdning! Skulle uppskatta om någon kunde seeda denna också...!!!
