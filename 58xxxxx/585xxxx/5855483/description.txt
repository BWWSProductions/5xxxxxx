Sonny Moore, the former vocalist of From First to Last had a solo project afterwards but now he has an electronic/dubstep/dj thing going on.

Includes "My Name Is Skrillex EP" and 8 songs ripped from his Myspace by me in the spring of 2010. They were ripped at 320kbps, but Myspace doesn't stream music at that high quality  so im guessing its really 192-256. 

Enjoy.
