Is any body with a problem?
When I click on ( Fine_Homebuilding ) file it presents a message (Error-20222:Self filename could not be completed. The file name is invalid, file names can only contain character (a-z,A-Z,/:\,).
I click OK and after the program seems to start but I cannot open any article. 

Try removing the underscore or low dash between the words Fine and Homebuilding so it looks like Fine Homebuilding and tell me my friend."

Its ok. I can see the articles from the ""content"".
If there are no other complains probably the problem is on my computer (Greek Windows?) or other regulation.
Thank you."
