                    Confession.                              
                    A case hits close to home for DS Matt Devlin  
                    when he investigates the death of a police  
                    officer. The dead man was his best friend  
                    Sergeant Pete Garvey - whom he had known since  
                    they were boys. When Matt discovers that Pete  
                    had recently been in contact with their  
                    childhood parish priest Jonathan Nugent, he is  
                    suspicious because Pete claimed to have been  
                    sexually abused by Nugent as a boy. But with  
                    nothing but unfounded rumours to go on, a  
                    murder charge cannot be brought against the  
                    priest. Now married with a family of his own,  
                    can Matt really be sure they are after the  
                    right man? James and Alesha take an unusual  
                    approach in a desperate attempt to get the case  
                    solved.
