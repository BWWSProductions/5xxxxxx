Bornova Bornova is a good movie with its non famous cast, good story and new technical approach. Temelkuran built the movie with soft scenes in a suburbia where he lives. Dialogs are strong and sometimes disturbing especially female audiences but extremely warm. Bornova Bornova has an original story which we usually read on newspapers'3rd pages.If you like Demirkubuz movies you'll like Bornova Bornova.I believe Temelkuran starts a new line for the people who has a good story.Temelkuran shows us that Turkish Movies can be produced with low budget and non famous cast.You do not need a perfect hi-end camera and light systems, you do not need famous and expensive cast, you do not need CGI for a good movie.All you need is sincerity
