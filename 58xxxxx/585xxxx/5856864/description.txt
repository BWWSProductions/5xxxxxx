Synopsis:

Academy Award winners Benicio Del Toro (Traffic) and Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs) tear up the screen in this action-packed thriller. Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) is lured back to his family estate to investigate the savage murder of his brother by a bloodthirsty beast. There, Talbot must confront his childhood demons, his estranged father (Hopkins), his brotherâ€™s grieving fiancÃ©, Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada), and a suspicious Scotland Yard Inspector, Hugo Weaving (The Matrix Trilogy). When Talbot is bitten by the creature, while on its hunt, he becomes eternally cursed and soon discovers a fate far worse than death. Inspired by the classic Universal film that launched a legacy of horror, The Wolfman brings the myth of a cursed man back to its iconic origins.
