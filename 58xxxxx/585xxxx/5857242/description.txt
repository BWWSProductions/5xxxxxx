Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore star together for the first time since The Wedding Singer in one of the funniest romantic comedies in years.
Enry Roth (Sandler) lives an enviable life in a Hawaiian paradise, spending every night with a beautiful tourist in search of an island fling. It\'s a sweet life with no stringsattached...until he meets Lucy (Barrymore). He and Lucy hit off from the get-go, but the next day she acts like she doesn\'t know him. Has his karma come around to kick in the butt or what? Actually, Lucy has short-term memory loss, so every night all memory of her day is erased. But a man in love will go to any lengths to win over the girl of his dreams, and if that meanings having to find imaginative ways of doing it over again every day, than Henry\'s up for the challenge.
