From BrillianceAudio.com:

Everything is over for Simon Axler, the protagonist of Philip Rothâ€™s 
startling new book. One of the leading American stage actors of his 
generation, now in his sixties, he has lost his magic, his talent, and 
his assurance. His Falstaff and Peer Gynt and Vanya, all his great 
roles, â€œare melted into air, into thin air.â€ When he goes onstage he 
feels like a lunatic and looks like an idiot. His confidence in his 
powers has drained away; he imagines people laughing at him; he can no 
longer pretend to be someone else. â€œSomething fundamental has vanished.â€ 
His wife has gone, his audience has left him, his agent canâ€™t persuade 
him to make a comeback. 

Into this shattering account of inexplicable and terrifying 
self-evacuation bursts a counterplot of unusual erotic desire, a 
consolation for a bereft life so risky and aberrant that it points not 
toward comfort and gratification but to a yet darker and more shocking 
end. In this long day's journey into night, told with Roth's inimitable 
urgency, bravura, and gravity, all the ways that we convince ourselves 
of our solidity, all our lifeâ€™s performances -- talent, love, sex, hope, 
energy, reputation -- are stripped off. Following the dark meditations 
on mortality and endings in Everyman and Exit Ghost, and the bitterly 
ironic retrospect on youth and chance in Indignation, Roth has written 
another in his haunting group of late novels.   
The Humbling is Roth's 30th book.
