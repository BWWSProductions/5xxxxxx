Alex talks with Daryl Metcalfe, member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, who demanded answers from the Rendell administration on why a taxpayer-financed bulletin produced by an Israeli company and intended to identify terror-related threats included two Second Amendment rallies he organized this year. The company, the Institute of Terrorism Research and Response, said militia groups planned to attend one of the rallies and police would need to use "crowd control" against the participants. 
[first half of hour 2]




Alex also talks with regular guest Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster about the economy and other issues.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
