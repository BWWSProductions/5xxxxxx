,woody_76,2010-10-01T21:12Z,flv wtf why !!!!
,jr69tfgac,2010-10-01T21:16Z,its been downloaded with streamtransport app direct from bbci player and this programme only does flv format.if you compare this flv to the other pdtv ideal uploads on here it's the same quality and this is smaller file size and plays fine on vlc or wmp11 so why convert to avi just to keep same quality and make file size 240mg?
,jr69tfgac,2010-10-01T21:44Z,there are seeds mostly from demonoid
