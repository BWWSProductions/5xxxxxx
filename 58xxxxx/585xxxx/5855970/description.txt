Sara is at the top of her game. She has the chance to be chosen for an elite summer tennis program, but her hopes are dashed unexpectedly by the one person no one likes - Colton.

Colton is at the bottom of life, constantly leading others way, hurting people, giving no one respect, and making fun of other teens for not doing what he does. But then his parents pray for some intervention in his life. When he's partying one night, Colton ends up in a car wreck with Sara, and goes through an experience that changes him. But facing life after you've done everything wrong can sometimes be the hardest step, and Colton must find a way to prove to everyone---especially to Sara---that he's changed.

Edwin Carpenter from The Dove Foundation says "This is a must-see family film of redemption! Powerful and definitely worth viewing!"
