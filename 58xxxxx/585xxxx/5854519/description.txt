                    Gently Evil.                             
                    Crime drama set in an idyllic coastal village  
                    in Northumberland, 1966. When the body of a  
                    young woman is found murdered, Gently and  
                    Bacchus find themselves investigating a family  
                    with unimaginable secrets. Initially, it  
                    appears that the woman's estranged husband, and  
                    father of her young daughter, is responsible  
                    for the killing. But as they further     
                    investigate this disturbed family, they  
                    discover a far more alarming truth.
