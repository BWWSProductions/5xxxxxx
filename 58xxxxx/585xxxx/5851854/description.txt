====================== Introduction! ======================
===========================================================

 NeoGaf proudly presents a Collection of Game Posters & Covers & Artworks of all time. The first and the most massive Collection that you can find about game-art is right here, whitout need to search and downloading all those crap game-arts from multimedia news and reviews that exist. 
   * The Collection contains art of enverimont, renders, characters and so on, at a quality that not everybody gives.
     Indeed, even we don't have everything but we have a mass ( read below ) of files that even google can't get a result in looking for them.
      - NO Watermarks ( only watermarks of their origins game developers )
      - NO artificats ( yes, possible to find 10 or so )
      - They aren't taken from websites that gives them in low size with artifacts, that you could say they are more thumbs in stead of a cover or poster by having watermarks of their multimedia news and reviews where they are showing them to the public just to see how a cover looks - they have them and you don't.

====================== NOTES! ======================
====================================================

      IMPORTANT!!
 - If you don't know us, and your not part of our sources, don't start around by telling we got from you like your the single person in this vast of internet and only from you the sources could be taken. 
 So keep it to your level - This has to do more to Personal Thanking just below.

 - We know that, by letting this huge collection out, to the internet, the "grabbers" will start spreading them out whitout giving credits to the original sources ( us ).

 - You really have to be a prink to think that what you can do such thing. Already the original source is us & on the official website, where everybody will know. So is better to keep your respect up and ignorance behind if you don't want to lose the respect around you.

 - The Game-Names are put in order, but is best to use the search future from your PC, to find the game your looking for. Is best to use the name of the game series and not the name of a sequel & prequel of that game.
    For example: Ghost Recong Future Soldier where your looking inside of G Folder, but origin is [b]Tom Clancy's[/b] Ghost Recong Future Soldier.
