That serial, for whatever the reason, does not work, I tried it on 3 different systems and invalid everytime even when offline. I did some digging and found a serial for it. So for future notice, dont use the included serial, use this one:
CDZCPRO-080-0001925- XJA-KCN-KCNCREW
i am still not sure if the ""User Name"" part of the registration dialog matters, I just stuck with the default ""Your Name"" for now.  Other than the serial, the program works great on Windows 7 and XP although i hoped for more changes from when it ""was"" Corel Dream3D !! :)"

@lierbagprash
I don't know why the serial didn't work for you, but it would be good to get feedback from others."

@lierbagprash - serial given by you does not work as well.
It looks like the only one to enjoy full benefits was @winnah. Good luck, mate."

Thanks, Stun."
