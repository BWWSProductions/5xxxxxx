Two brothers, Charlie and Sam decide to go to watch a baseball game. They "borrow" their neighbor's car. Charlie decides to chase the moon to let Sam have a good time. On the way there they cannot decide which CD to listen to. Sam is killed. Thirteen years later, Charlie has grown up and is working at the Marblehead cemetery. Every evening at dusk he goes to a nearby forest where he plays with Sam. Charlie has the gift of seeing ghosts. This serves him well as an undertaker, as he can talk with the deceased.
