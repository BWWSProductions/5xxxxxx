Predators R5 Line - I encoded one 480p (Predators.2010.R5.LiNE.480p.H264[PC.Mac.PS3.Xbox].mp4 481 MB) but despite my 2 hour long work on audio - nothing good came out. Video is fixed and decent, but audio is sooooo ""thin"" that I would wait 2 weeks for future DVD/BluRay...
Sorry, I did my best."

I'll rather wait 2 weeks for a good rip then a shit like this.
