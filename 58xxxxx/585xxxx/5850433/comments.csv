,Rc123,2010-09-24T22:19Z,"Speed is quite good.  My problem is that it's crashing at the 2k games logo.  But, I'm not sure if this is a problem on my end or not.  Oh well, I'll wait and see if this one is any different."
,HWGreen,2010-09-24T22:26Z,@rc123: seeing as they are all the same... ya...
,AbbathDoomOcculta,2010-09-24T22:27Z,"wow the speed is great, im getting 600-700 kbs"
,Brunaland,2010-09-24T22:42Z,You have to apply all the skidrow files to the place you installed it and replace every file :D
,HWGreen,2010-09-24T23:22Z,"Gah, why does it torture me so? the last 5% is taking as long as the entire file so far..."
,Rc123,2010-09-24T23:37Z,Yea I did that.  It's happening to a lot of people and none of the 'fixes' I've seen on forums helped :(
,HWGreen,2010-09-25T00:03Z,"thanks to omega7.la.net.ua:49171, all i need now is about .3%... @12 KBPS"

2. Mount image or burn it                                      
3. Install                                                     
4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD to your 
 installation directory and overwrite                        
 5. Play the game

,robbles,2010-09-26T05:58Z,"why is your file size different then skidrow filesize

,jtsoldier,2010-09-26T12:48Z,"@luis: courtesy of iridis_alpha from the torrent comments section on the original, is a solution! it follows:

""they way to stop this crashing during the first movie cutscene is to set SkipIntroVideo =1 in the usersettings.ini - on XP its in C:\Documents and Settings\YOUR USER NAME\My Documents\MyGames\Sid Meier's Civilization 5 """
,TomCatJak,2010-09-26T19:44Z,"I got this to work fairly easily.

2. Run The installer.exe
3.Install
4.download the June DirectX SDK release found here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/resultsForProduct.aspx?displaylang=en&productID=9C954C37-1ED1-4846-8A7D-85FC422D1388
5.Run on DirectX 10 or 11, no need to mount. 

Thanks for the release."
,TomCatJak,2010-09-26T23:55Z,"@luis, try installing the End User Runtime also. Make sure you have the requirements. http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/

Restart your computer - this will sometimes work

Run Game Booster, close all applications/programs.

,Brunaland,2010-09-28T15:07Z,"@luis016420

what do you mean? how to install or about the game ? 

i cant edit the torrent because i get a error when i try to and this shouldnĂÂ´t be this hard there is a file inside the cd called resources install that if you get a error and disable uac , google for information and everything else should be self explanatory.
I downloaded this torrent and installed it tried it then uploaded it to piratebay.
This torrent might be bigger because it is already extracted to the disc image so saves you alot of time :D
