                    First of a new two-part crime thriller. What  
                    lies behind the door of number 27 The Hill? A  
                    routine 'domestic' call out to the house leads  
                    to a policeman's murder, the prime suspect  
                    grievously injured and a shocking discovery  
                    made. For DCI Alan Banks it is the most  
                    difficult case of his life. Five young girls  
                    have gone missing and he has just discovered  
                    the lair of a serial rapist and killer but only  
                    four bodies are found. Which means one, Leanne  
                    Wray, could still be alive... But the suspect  
                    Marcus Payne is in a coma, and the ambitious DS  
                    Annie Cabbot from Professional Standards wants  
                    to know why. As Banks pursues his line of  
                    investigation, she tails him every step of the  
                    way.
