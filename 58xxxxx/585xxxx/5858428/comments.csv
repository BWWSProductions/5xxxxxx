,memphist,2010-09-30T23:35Z,"At $1,499.95 a pop I don't think to many people would have tried the legit one.  I have tried GeekBench before not this version and I found it pretty good.  My favourite thing about it is there is not configuring. It has it's own bench levels set and it grades against those for everyone.  

As for this Torrent - I've downloaded it and worked perfectly - I've downloaded form Stun before and he has good stuff and quality  downloads, always.  So I trust this."

you're a dummy.
get your information straight.
GeekBench DOES NOT cost $1500.
it only costs $20, which is not that much.
the $1500 license is a site-license, which means, that if you're a company that has a few thousand computers and try to optimize them, you can pay that price and use GeekBench on as many computers as you want.
instead of buying one license for each computer (which is a hassle of buying for each computer seperatelly), you buy once and use the license forever.

its quite a difference between $1500 and $20, right? ;)
