,Oot-Glit,2010-09-29T00:44Z,"It might be the Automatic Level Control on whatever radio JWhitt uses. Hopefully, it is an easy thing to fix. It was not there a few weeks ago."

,tlane09,2010-09-29T23:11Z,"Hey J, thanks for the daily uploads I really appreciate it.

Have you stopped uploading the shows or have you moved to a different site?"
,Twysted1,2010-09-30T00:01Z,"He had mentioned last week about trouble on his connection and somebody coming out to fix it, my guess is he's offline or unable to record/post for the time being.  I hope it's nothing worse than that and that he gets it resolved soon.  "
,s807,2010-09-30T00:10Z,"these shows are great

Put this in Google and you'll find the 3 sites Jwhitt uploaded his latest:
The Rush Limbaugh Show 28-Sep-10 CF mp3

Enjoy!"
,thefizdude,2010-09-30T05:06Z,"I tried to paste the link or name the three sites here in a comment, but the system won't let my comment go through (lol).  It keeps giving me Database error.  Anyway, the three sites start with I, B and T.  I'm seeding now.  "
