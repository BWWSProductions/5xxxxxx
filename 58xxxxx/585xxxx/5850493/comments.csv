,very_bad_man,2010-09-26T19:37Z,"RE: URGENT:  BSkyB Letters For Processing - High Priority

My view is that an internet account holder has some opportunity for avoiding
legal responsibility for damage resulting from the acts of a third party
person when they have no explicit knowledge that their internet connection
is being used by the third party in a manner that causes damage to our
clients. This is well established case law (Smith v Littlewoods and
subsequent cases).

However, as detailed in Smith v Littlewoods, when a person has specific
knowledge that there is a risk that, or there is a high probability, their
premises will be used in a manner, which is known, by third parties to cause
damage to our clients and they had a capability to take action to prevent
such action by third parties, then they are liable for that damage.

It should however be noted that the awareness of the risk is constrained by
the Data Protection Act.

In my opinion the red patch applies - that is, no quarter....

Why would they want to know if it was politically sensitive, other than to perhaps blackmail that politician.  As the basis for what they were doing seems to be get people to pay up to avoid going to court and having their sexual interests displayed out in the open for all to see, in itself a form of blackmail.  To have a tickbox on their own internal forms which indicate when a target is politically sensitive just shows what these fuckers were all about.

Dear andy,

Welcome to eHarmony UK. By registering, you're already on your way to finding a happy, successful relationship. ""

Think you might wanna put that search on hold for a bit fat boy, at least until this shit storm blows over (which i doubt it will).

Shocking really, this bloke is so full of his own shit (re:emails) and is clearly not struggling financially but yet doesn't have the bottle to approach a chick and chat her up face to face.  The lesson of the story is: money cant buy you a real set of balls.

If you want my advice fat boy, just do what all your other pudgy little pencil pushing mates do and go pay for a hooker to sit on your fat greedy face.

Bet you wish you hadn't wasted that money on the joining fee for eharmony after receiving utterly sobering advice like that free of charge.....??"

Why did Sky give out the details of these individuals to these law firms, when Virgin Media didn't!

The following is a step by step guide on how you can get back at Sky!

1) These law firms sue individuals for downloading/uploading copyright contents.

2) They trace the indivuals via their IP address.

3) Sky then gives the address's of these individuals to these law firms.

4) These Law firms then sue the individuals for downloading/uploading copyright contents.

5) However if someone else uses your internet connection to download illegal content without prior knowledge, then that individual must be sued by the law firm.

6) However the Law firm will blame you for the security of your internet connection. making you responsibe for the illegal download.

7) However anyone with little or now knowedge of internet security will say they they were not advised about this.

8) It is the responsibly of the Internet Provider (Sky) to explain this to them before they sign up to them, because if they don't then they are responsible for the fines!

9) Cancel Sky Broadband and join Virgin Media!

Infringement of Copyright â€“ Evacuate the Dancefloor
Thank you for your letter dated 16th August 2010 and we respond using the same
numbering:
1. As far as ""fake"" or ""spoofed"" IP addresses are concerned, whilst such faking or spoofing
is possible, our client has received advice from its experts, which has confirmed that it is
not possible to enter into a successful transaction on a peer to peer network whilst
using a fake or spoofed IP address. Our client's experts will also not gather torrents
containing fake or spoofed IP addresses as a result of the technical methods they
employ. The processes and methods employed by our client's IT experts to produce
the evidence which is then submitted to the ISPs, has been the subject of a number of
detailed investigations and reports prepared by a qualified information technology
consultant including a UK expert and which has been provided to the High Court of
Justice in London following which it felt able to make an order against your clientâ€™s ISP
to disclose your clientâ€™s name and address to us. We therefore remain of the view that
there has been no mistake and that your client's internet connection was used for the
infringing act identified. Should it be necessary to issue proceedings against your client,
full details of our client's expert report will be made available as part of the disclosure
process.
2. We are unsure of the purpose of this point however, please be assured that should it
be necessary to issue proceedings against your client full details of all evidence
gathered by the monitoring system will be made available as part of the disclosure
process.
3. The work identified as being made available by your client was the Album â€˜Evacuate
the Dancefloorâ€™ which was released in the UK on the 17th July 2009.

""I am trying to think of ways of wrong-footing the SRA and taking the wind
out of their sails. Sorry for the mixed metaphor. My latest wheeze is to
contact schools or local authorities and offer to give talks to teenagers at
schools about file sharing and why we do what we do. I would offer to do
this free of charge and offer it as a service to educate young people not to
file share, to prove that the work we do is not all about the money. What do
you think? If you like it or have any other ideas let me know and we need to
get someone to cold call.write to school authorities to offer this free
service. It will improve our profile with the SRA, educate young people and
in time reduce file sharing, which will in turn benefit the creative
industries. ""



He's even prepared to lie and use school kids as a cushion to divert the attention away from the SRA about the real reason he is doing what he is doing, which is of course: exploiting the justice system to shaft everyday people out of money so he can buy flashy motors and extravagant properties.

This is because Andrew and Adam will be drafting a new letter so we can drop a couple of hundred cases over the next couple of weeks, putting pressure on those who we do not drop to settle.

If you find someone who is blind, one legged and dying, and you think they are not worth pursuing due to the possibility of bad PR, please also put them in there. However, the majority of cases will be continued.

Dear Ms Steel

Thank you for your email of earlier today.

I am sorry, but I am unable to assist you. I am one of two law firms in the country that carry out file sharing litigation work (the other firm being Gallant Macmillan). As such I am not in a sufficiently independent position to provide advice to you on how to respond to any letters from Gallant Macmillan.

However, I am aware that there is a firm called Lawdit Solicitors (ask for Michael Coyle, 023 8023 5979), who specialise in responding to cases of the type you have received. Good luck!

Regards

I was wondering if I could ask for a bit of advice.



I have received a letter from Gallant Macmillian accusing my IP address of infringements against Ministry of sound.  I have replied within the 21 days and they have replied to me stating that I have given them a form of template letter and still have to give more explanation as to why I should not be accused.

   I have come across a service designed to protect reputations damaged by the internet. My own IT guy is involved. This is how he describes it; it may be of interest: There are 2 aspects to the work:- Prevention and Removal. The basic principle is that we identify the clients key properties to protect:- Company Name; Director Names; Staff Names; Product Names; Service Names. For prevention, we aim to dominate the first 5 pages of Google with search results to pages we control.  We build mini websites, social media profile pages, articles, hub pages, to flood the internet with positive information.  We create it in such a way that no one suspects it is done purposely for brand protection. If there is negative press (any website) that is already published, we use tactics to move those web page results off the first 5 pages of Google.  Normally no one searches past the first 5 pages. We also help manage their brand/reputation on social media sites (Facebook/Twitter etc..) by registering all available profiles in their name and holding them to prevent anyone getting them and publishing negative information. We also monitor Staff commentary on social media sites about their â€œworkâ€ to ensure they are not writing negatively about their company, boss or clients. The cost is typically Â£150 per month for a minimum of 12 months, as it can sometimes take 3 â€“ 4 months to see any results. (due to the way Google works)"

Dear Sirs,

I am writing in regards to a letter I have received from yourselves today Reference: M2DA10825197, regarding the matter of Infringement of Copyright.

I am totally unaware of the allegations you are making towards myself in this case, at no time have I sought to download or upload a movie under the name of 'Xcalibur - The Lords Of Sex'.

On the date you have said this offense happened, I had only just arrived back in the UK from being on my honeymoon, the only thing that would have been connected to my ISP at the time to my knowledge, would have been my Blackberry mobile, which is unable to use P2P, let alone store 12GB of file.

I have been very alarmed at the aggressive nature of your letter, I understand the seriousness of the infringement but to be held responsible or to be I told I knowingly allowed someone to commit this act is not true, I was fast asleep at 5 am recovering from lack of sleep from my return flight.

I have today reported your firm to the SRA, and am currently writing to BBC Watchdog after reading all the reports about your firm online, as I don't seem to be the only innocent party that is being accused.

In light of my testament above, I can not sign the UNDERTAKINGS or pay the fine of Â£495 as I am not and never have been in possession of the alleged file.

If you have any further evidence that can physically point to the file being within my property at the said time, or that I knowingly allowed this to happen, then I would be interested in seeing it, although seeing that I know the infringement never happened I doubt this would be the case.

Yours sincerely
