,erroneus,2010-09-26T00:45Z,"yeah... wish I read the comment first.  It's worse than a missing file.  It's completely fubar.  Please try again?  And while you're at it, please unzip and unrar?"
,erroneus,2010-09-26T02:10Z,"Not a total loss.  They keymaker64 seems to work even though it core dumps at the end.  I was able to download the .bundle file from vmware's web site directly.  I suppose if anyone expresses interest, I will up it here.

I wonder what ever happened to RPM installation packages?  They just stopped doing it?"
