,asighkick,2010-09-27T01:51Z,"There is something wrong with the tracker stats as shown on the site.  Shows 0 0 but there are many seeds.

Trust me, there are hundreds or even thousands of seeds on a new upload.  Just load it and see.... you will download in no time."
,asighkick,2010-09-27T02:33Z,"Please double check this torrent....

It seems to be 'The Sarah Jane Adventures - Ashen Hill Manor'

HELP!!!!! "
,asighkick,2010-09-27T03:06Z,"I am checking this weird anomaly now and it 'may' be picking up an old file on my computer because it plays the complete Sarah Jane file even though only a few megs have been downloaded.

My apologies for this announcement, was trying to save people downloading it if it was faulty.

Please do your own checks - thanks."
