,dinodig,2010-10-10T13:53Z,For how many days is the trail period extended  anyway?
,abhi6,2010-10-10T20:55Z,"@dinodig
165 days, but you can extend several times = infinite days"
,MultiSource,2010-10-12T18:38Z,"Something that hit me is that when i used this on the NIS2011 Swedish 18.1.0.37 it says that i have 165days but it isnt counting down the days, shoudnt it? Can you please explain how this works exactly? cause if i could i would like it to never expire.. but as it is now im thinking, is there something wrong and will it expire tomorrow.. and will it work with the new updates that comes in the future, cause i dont want it to expire one day when im not here on the computer."
,MultiSource,2010-10-12T18:42Z,"I mean, is it supose to count down or is this a trial reseter that resets the trail period everyday?"
,abhi6,2010-10-13T07:29Z,"@MultiSource 
if it expires use NTR once again,
also this may not work with new product updates but i will upload a new version of NTR when that happens."
,MultiSource,2010-10-13T16:28Z,"you wrote ""extend several times = infinite days"", so if i extend 2 or more times, does it never expire or how does that work?"
,abhi6,2010-10-13T20:45Z,"@MultiSource
you can extend whenever it is about to expire
ie. you get 165 days on first installation, when no. od days drop below 10 ,install this once again to get 165 more days and so on... and it will never expire"
,MultiSource,2010-10-15T14:25Z,"You should have a button on the app, so that one can stop the trail for ever ;) that resets the trail period every day so i can have 165days for ever. Would be realy nice. But thanks for this one man, helped me a lot."
,blu07,2010-10-21T12:45Z,"Worked great for me. I'm running XP 32bit, took less than 5 minits to download and install, I've now got 165 days. Thanks abhi6 great upload"
,blu07,2010-10-21T12:51Z,"I forgot to say, I'm also running your norton anti virus 2011 which is also working great so thanks for that too"
,roleman13,2010-12-22T20:02Z,"heres an easier way to redownload it and use it infinite

1) Download Revosetup (Uninstaller)
2) unistall NIS 2011 using Revosetup
3) Download Norton Removal Tool
4) Run Norton Removal tool
5) Reinstall NIS 2011
6)http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5826889/
7) search the software that i listed on google"
,rahmanio,2011-02-08T17:36Z,thank you!
,lkadar,2011-02-10T07:12Z,Great! THANKS!
,mumihp,2011-02-16T13:16Z,"Thanks for this, worked great, installed, NIS 2011, then this, thanks"
,vivapiracy2k10,2011-04-11T20:29Z,"Not sure what the fuck your trial reset program did, but after installing it to NIS 18.1.0.37 and updating afterwards, the Settings option does NOT work and opens up Live Support and opens up browser to automatically hit the Norton Account website."
,lockency,2011-04-23T07:51Z,"Same as vivapiracy2k10 here. After installing the NTR, the settings button ceased working and it opens up norton support. How can I solve this problem? Because now i canÂ´t configure Norton for it to work the way i want.."
,lockency,2011-04-23T08:24Z,About the problem mentioned just above: i guess thatÂ´s why the readme file tells us to change the settings before restarting the machine. :P
,vivapiracy2k10,2011-04-23T15:19Z,"@lock: I did follow the instructions to the letter. I set my settings up the way I wanted, and rebooted, and they were instantly reset to the installation defaults.

Fuck this shit, just gonna keep using Comodo IS. It's better anyway."
,sukesh38,2011-05-02T14:03Z,bhai kisi ke pass nis 2011 ka key hai kya batao yaar emergency
