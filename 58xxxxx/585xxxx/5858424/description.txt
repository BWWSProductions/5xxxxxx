Notes:

- Broadcast live on Facebook app Nightclub City by Booyah; and KROQ.com
and CBS Radio rock station websites nationwide via Ustream.

- Prior to 'Firehouse' Tommy gets a drink from the backline and has a flamethrower
go off directly behind him resulting in him quickly moving forward away from the flames.
