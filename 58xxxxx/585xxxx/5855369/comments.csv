,wolfbane3,2010-09-30T15:15Z,no peers at all?!
,halfmonkey,2010-09-30T19:31Z,I'm having the same problem as the other guy. I've uploaded 11Gb of this file and utorrent says it's currently at 6.999 availability. So don't know what's happening?
,halfmonkey,2010-10-01T08:45Z,"Right, I think I know what the problem is, but don't know how to fix it! - The trackers in the list of trackers for this torrent are showing as offline or timed out and have never had any seeders or leecher, but some of the trackers in the list are working, but none are associated with the piratebay - I think this is why it's showing as no seeders/ leechers here, but utorrent on my PC shows as working OK."
,blu4you,2010-10-01T21:45Z,"ya I had the exact same problem on my upload, I'm a noob when it comes to torrents so I have no idea what the problem is. thx for the uploads btw"
,wolfbane3,2010-10-02T14:17Z,"ok! well, i m gonna try the torrent and c if i can connect to seeders/leechers."
,halfmonkey,2010-10-02T19:20Z,You can download this successfully - It's just that the Piratebay is listing the torrent as having no seeders or leechers.
,wolfbane3,2010-10-04T19:16Z,thanks mate :)
