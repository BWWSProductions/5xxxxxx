,kelsnic,2010-09-25T16:27Z,Thank you so much for the Days of our Lives uploads....I love it...Thank you.  Question is this a double of 9-23 or is it 9-24? 
,SoWErA,2010-09-30T17:36Z,you gonna start uploading again? even as DvdVeeken is?
,SoWErA,2010-09-30T18:27Z,"Anyway I won't mind if you let the work over to DvdVeeken permanently since his latest 2 eps vs yours is higher quality even if yours are higher resolution. Then again his takes 80mb more but I rather take 200mb more if meens higher quality)

Thanks anyway for all the other Days of our lives releases you uploaded."
