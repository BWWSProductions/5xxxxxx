,TheChosen1_,2010-10-16T22:54Z,"Hi guys.

I want to ask all of u about watching .mkv movies in notebook.When I watch a .mkv 
in my notebook , it seems like a divx or slightly better than it.I know the LCD panel 
of it isnt HD but I just wonder that does it really make a huge difference watching it in 
a 42"" or 46"" LCD or LED TV ?

Thx for ur answers guys.And thx for the movie again. "

Normaly you need a BluRay to burn your HD movies on but you can also try to convert your MKV files to M2TS with AVS Video Converter or Any Video Converter. Maybe this will help you out.
Or try to burn with another program like NTI Dragon Burn."
,coolash007,2010-12-02T20:03Z,Megan Fox means  a bad movie!.  i'll stay away.
