,grama_lama,2010-10-01T18:41Z,Impatient bastards go buy a subscription.  Thanks to the uploader.  d/l ETA 2 hours
,prydon,2010-10-02T01:54Z,"@mg112 This torrent is in fact not dead. Since my internet connection sucks however it takes a while for the other seeders to complete the download.

Patience is key!"
,mg112,2010-10-02T04:07Z,didnt mean to sound like a impatient bastard but i am thanks for the upload and tell me where do iget a subsription for it wtf are you talking bout gramar larma
,prydon,2010-10-02T04:32Z,@mg112 I am assuming grama_lama is talking about paying into a private torrent site.
,prydon,2010-10-02T04:33Z,All episodes of the 2nd season: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5861628/The_Colony__Season_2_[720p]
,18712,2010-10-02T08:28Z,"Such a good show, Jim is a fucking nut bag lol."
,spunkedunken,2010-10-02T13:22Z,"good torrent, compared to season 1 ending this one was kind of a downer though

it's the end of this season now right?"
,georgejames70,2010-10-02T16:48Z,"Thx Prydon, 
good torrent, 
i really like this show, hoping that they make a season 3 soon!"
,cpres,2010-10-03T02:15Z,Where is the standard version (non HD) version of this?  Have not been able to find it at TPB.
,mkmacabre,2010-10-04T22:31Z,"Hi,

This version will not play on my VLC player :(
"
,mkmacabre,2010-10-04T22:33Z,"PS: Since you are the only person to upload the season finale (S02E10) could i please request a normal 350mb .avi version please?

We are all dying to see the end of our fave show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thanks!!!"
,neoka28,2010-10-08T07:03Z,"Some weird shitty format that NOTHING will play, rather large download, nobody really seeding, no normal res version.... what does all this add up to? A FAIL! "
,darkbyke,2010-10-12T04:20Z,"You're all idiots that complain.  Get VLC Media player to play this file.  Update your fucking computers codecs.  Right click file ""open with vlc"" 

Goddamn.  

Thanks for the up!  "
,fallout11,2010-10-12T23:18Z,"Works great with VLC or Media Player Classic, and .mkv is a very common format.

Kinda cool ending, actually.....quite realistic, no sunshine and rainbows."
,dvalmont136,2010-10-16T20:21Z,Any chance someone could seed an .AVI copy of this episode?  Watch with family using USB port of DVD player which will not play .MKV.  Thanks much!
,mkmacabre,2010-10-17T12:46Z,"Likewise. Was burning to disc and watching on a standalone divx player hooked up to TV in living room. Unable to play .mkv

Have managed to convert to .avi, but after seven hours converting was left with a 720 .avi file that will also not play on a standalone divx player.

Regular 350mb .avi file for S02E10 required please."
,rollenaces,2010-10-18T04:52Z,"what player did you guys use to play the mvk file i have w 7. and nothing i found has worked?
Thanks"
,prydon,2010-10-21T04:30Z,These .mkv files are most easily viewable on VLC
