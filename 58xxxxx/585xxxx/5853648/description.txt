1936: Soldiers of the Third Reich roam the world seeking occult weapons for
their insane plans of conquest.  When  Fenton  Paddock,  a  former  British
soldier and hapless smuggler, is asked to look for his friend Richard,  who
went missing in Tibet, he has no idea that this search will lead him across
three continents to a secret that could turn the whole world  upside  down.
Enough mystery? Not in the mood for another  crime  story?  "Lost  Horizon"
brings the classic adventure back to its roots: the 1930s, exotic  settings
all over the world, and the dangerous quest for one of the greatest secrets
of mankind makes adventurers' hearts beat faster. The Makers of the  award
winning  Secret  Files  series  invite  you  to  experience  a  technically
outstanding, carefully designed  game  featuring  an  absolutely  thrilling
story at the side of Kim and Fenton
