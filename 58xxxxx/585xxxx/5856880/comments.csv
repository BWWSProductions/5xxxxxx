[V],phatwarez,2010-09-29T01:44Z,"Indeed, this is just an upconversion with a sharpening filter, thats all. Definitely NOT BD-Rip.
Proof:

Quote from IMDB: ""Knight and Day is expected to arrive on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on November 30"""
,AMoveFan,2010-09-29T06:22Z,It looks nice enough to me as long as it's not stupid ass cam rip when they record it in the movie theaters then i'm down.
,x7thdayx,2010-09-29T08:23Z,"LOL, look at what this place has become. Moaning and bitching about a FREE movie download that doesn't release for another 2 months, but yet the quality is very watchable for being so far out from the shelf date. And did you ever stop to think that maybe NLUPPER didn't encode this himself? And that he's just uploading it so all you other whiny pricks can enjoy a free movie that would cost you $25 otherwise. Stop bitching & maybe say thank you once in a while. Pricks.

Thank you NLUPPER. It's appreciated."
,vivaan,2010-09-30T11:33Z,"why do people upload such torrents instead ripping from the original ones...
Once they are out in the market..."
,PriSoner69,2010-09-30T23:45Z,"Picture Quality: Upscale.. OK But not 720p. Audio Quality: Terrible Telesync, Cut's Out an muffled during load sequences.

V7
A3

Crap."
,AMoveFan,2010-10-01T02:56Z,I agree this is defently not blue ray why do some of you uploaders lie about what source you are riping onto your computer for us downloaders it's in ok picture quality but I can usually tell when it is blue ray or not and this 1 isn't blue ray no way in hell.
,AMoveFan,2010-10-01T02:57Z,but anyway nice try and thanks for sharing lol.
,usucdik,2010-10-03T10:08Z,"Quality all around sucks ass plus it's choppy, and x7thdayx is a fucking idiot."
,cldrain,2010-10-19T15:26Z,I guess the word 'Thank You' has been forgotten and people are using the F word instead when receiving a free gift.     I don't see a pink skull next to your name!!!  Don't be a jerk!
,intobearzz,2010-10-20T03:38Z,"I THINK YA RIGHT ""cldrain""! WE DO FORGET SOMETIMES HOW TO THANK YOU'S TO THE UPLOADERS AND INSTEAD COMPLAIN. IT'S RARE I DO. BUTT! IT FREE FLICKS YA'LL SO I GUESS GET OVER IT! HUH? "
,S3nd41,2010-10-20T18:26Z,Stop posting crappy misleading releases.
,Nick3rs,2010-10-21T06:09Z,"Ok so its not a 720p direct rip...

The uploader shouldn't be able to say it is when its really not.

A misleading title is what bugs me...

oh and...P.S. Thanks haha"
,Metroidn1f,2010-10-22T02:34Z,"I looked at the preview while downloading it, it does not look that much like it is an upscale, but the edges were a bit pixely.  After looking at the specs on this page, the profile is baseline and there is only 1 Reference Frame!  Come on.  HD is suppose to be High Profile, Level 4.1 and for the settings, at least use the default settings."
,Edmund62,2010-10-26T11:34Z,"NLUPPER002 - You are an ulimate wanker and time waster.
This is fucking ""Greys Anatomy"" or some shit!"
,Diezzie,2010-10-26T22:43Z,"nlupper: je heb best wel goede rips tussen je uploads zitten, maar ik wil je vragen toch je info  naar waarheid te vermelden. Ik stoor me behoorlijk aan een fake DTS, AC3, resolutie (bitrate) en ook de zelf gemaakte Subs! Fijn dat je,of iemand anders, er waarschijnlijk veel tijd in steekt om een film van subs te voorzien, maar doe het dan volgens de norm aub.   "
,stedenfeldt9,2010-11-01T20:15Z,nlupper- fuck off!!!
,williehmmm,2010-11-08T02:07Z,"I think the point of people complaining is that they've downloaded a 4.7GB file that is no better than a 0.7GB file.

My video card upscales, I don't need waste my time and download an extra 4GB over what I'am actually getting.

If the source is  DVD or an R5, tell us and we'll download a file that is an efficient size for that source.  Saying it's a bluray source is just not true and pisses people off so you cannot expect thanks for wasting people time and bandwidth.

Very poor."
,Blue-eyed,2011-03-03T11:04Z,"Beware! Do not download this shitty, shitty copy. I repeat, choose another copy. That is if you do want to download this horribly awful film in the first place. The picture quality is not good, although watchable. The sound quality is very bad, it's totally distorted because it's been recorded too loud. Kind of when someone is screaming into a poorly made microphone. And last, the subtitles are very bad with misspellings and such (the English ones at least) and fucks up after about an hour and need to be delayed for a few seconds."
