Welcome to the latest edition of Hed Kandi's ever popular location-led release World Series. Next on the roster is one of the most glamorous, stylish and fashionable capitals of the world. Featuring the best upfront house from Kandi's worldwide dancefloors, Hed Kandi will be taking you on a journey to the world's most iconic and cosmopolitan fashion houses, clubbing hubs, home of the party elite and of course the birthplace of Kandi HQ in World Series: London .

Hed Kandi in-house fashionista, resident Maddox DJ and latest addition to the Hed Kandi roster, Marie Claire, is responsible for the mixes over two CDs, defining the sound of our London events. This release also brings you a bonus third CD featuring the soundtrack to the major fashion houses this year.

CD1 and CD2 are all about grooving, upfront and peak time club mixes featuring some of the hottest producers currently in the scene such as Avicii / Simian Mobile Disco / Mark Knight / Laidback Luke / ATFC / Chris Lake / Alex Guardino / Daddy's Groove and more...

The bonus disc represents the sound of the big fashion house runways and catwalks this year. Music and fashion go hand in hand with Hed Kandi and these are some of the tracks that have providing the musical backdrop for the likes of Versace, Roberto Cavalli and Stella McCartney. Artists such as Tiga, Gossip and Royksopp have been prime electronic fashion fodder this year and while taking a break from the big room grooves of discs one and two, this disc is a foray into the slick, striking and stylish world of the fashionista.

This is Hed Kandi's home city and the creative epicentre where Hed Kandi HQ hosts it's fan-led foray into house music and beyond. We invite you to join us on this journey into the slick and the stylish.

See you in the mix and as always, on the dancefloor!
