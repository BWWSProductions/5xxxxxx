From Wiki:

The Breast is a novella by Philip Roth, in which the main character,
David Kepesh, becomes a 155-pound breast. Throughout the book Kepesh 
fights with himself. Part of him wishes to give in to bodily desires, 
while the other part of him wants to be rational. Kepesh, a literature 
professor, compares his plight with that of fictional characters such as 
Gregor Samsa in Kafka's novella The Metamorphosis and Kovalyov in 
Nikolai Gogol's short story "The Nose". Throughout the novel, he 
describes the various sexual and physical feelings he has while people 
handle him, while initiating sex with his girlfriend, and while he is 
alone.
During a stay on the beach with his girlfriend, Claire, Kepesh had 
wished to have breasts, to be a breast, and he struggles with the idea 
that apparently this wish was fulfilled while other more important 
wishes were not.

From BrillianceAudio.fail

Like a latter-day Gregor Samsa, Professor David Kepesh wakes up one 
morning to find that he has been transformed. But where Kafkaâ€™s 
protagonist turned into a giant beetle, the narrator of Philip Rothâ€™s 
richly conceived fantasy has become a 155-pound female breast. What 
follows is a deliriously funny yet touching exploration of the full 
implications of Kepeshâ€™s metamorphosisâ€”a daring, heretical book that 
brings us face to face with the intrinsic strangeness of sex and 
subjectivity. 

Technically at least, THE BREAST seems to me Roth's best book so far. 
The humor and pathos (it has fair amounts of both) come from his solid 
grasp of how life is, his firm knowledge of the importance of strength 
of character and the will to live... THE BREAST is terrific for a thing 
of its kind: inventive and sane and very funny, though filthy of 
course... It's incredible, in fact, how smart he is for a man so hung 
up with his you-know-what...
"The Breast is terrific... inventive and sane and very funny. The trick
which is the heart of the book is brilliant... and rich with meaning."
-- John Gardner, New York Times Book Review, 07/17/1972


"Hilarious, serious, visionary, logical, sexual-philosophical; the 
ending amazesâ€”the joke takes three steps beyond savagery and satire and 
turns into a sublimeness of pity. One knows when one is reading 
something that will permanently enter the culture."â€”Cynthia Ozick
