i tried downloading this torrent from another computer and it's NOT seeding.  Don't waste your time....yet. Let me get back to my computer and check, it might have locked up. It's an old system and i've been having issues with it lately. Probably gonna have to build a new one soon."
,CharlieTann,2010-09-27T23:33Z,"OK, rebooted my computer and it appears to be seeding. Give it a try and let me know."
,cenzo6945,2010-09-29T07:11Z,"Hey Charlie, I'm DL it now. No seeders. I will try tonight and see what i get bro."
,cenzo6945,2010-09-30T21:57Z,"No Luck Charlie... would it be easier on your system to go about it one by one? i can't understand it, since your other uploads are working right? thanks pal, and hope we can get this one in soon."
,CharlieTann,2010-10-01T02:00Z,"Earlier i posted to the general help forum about this and am waiting for a reply. All of my other torrents worked fine...excet for my first one, so i don't know WTF is going on."
,CharlieHarper,2010-10-02T02:14Z,The First Upload Of The 1-20 Worked Fine For Me But The Im Stuck On 47.8% No Seeders Plz Help Seed & Will Continue To Seed After Download
