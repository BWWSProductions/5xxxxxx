Credit goes to Leverage for the original upload. Personally I found the video HD quality fair but nothing more (7/10). Apparently it must be due to the average source (Bluray) quality, the DVD not being a better alternative anyway.

Since I highly dislike RAR's this is the *UNRARED* version with a couple of subtitles added... in fact the ones I could gather around. (Sorry for the italian guys but I could not find any italian subtitle file at all.) Since I do not read / understand all the languages I included please leave a comment for the others if something went wrong (out of sync)...

Enjoy!!
