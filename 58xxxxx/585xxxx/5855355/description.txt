Leighton Antelman and Steve McGraw started writing music and booking shows when they were both in 7th grade.[1] The band really got their start as Next to Best playing at MooseFest 2000 in Gilbert, AZ. At that time, the band consisted of just Antelman, Taylor and Aranbul.[2] After that band broke up, Antelman and McGraw continued to write and play music. They then soon added drummer Lorenand bassist Dustin Forsgren.[3] The band came up with their name right before one of their first shows.
