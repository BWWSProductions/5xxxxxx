Synopsis:

Sometimes, four legs are better than two. Dan (Brendan Fraser, The Mummy franchise) just moved his wife and son to the woods to take a new job with a supposedly eco-friendly housing development. But the furâ€”and Danâ€™s temperâ€”is sure to fly when the local critters learn of the bleak plans for their forest home and stop at nothing to halt construction. Brooke Shields (TVâ€™s Lipstick Jungle), Matt Prokop (High School Musical 3: Senior Year), Ken Jeong (The Hangover) and Angela Kinsey (TVâ€™s The Office) co-star in this comedy for the whole family.
