Add new rule

bump rule 10 to rule 11
This new rule will save gunnersrock all the time he takes searching for rips for the lazy tw@s who dont or wont look."

""Just Uploads"" are when i upload already encoded small size rips which i find when looking for the source"

I know that i accepted your request for lord of the rings trilogy but i didn't know that riddlerA uploaded them already so try these 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5469507/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_I_%282001%29Extd_Edition_720p_x264_by_RiddlerA

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5471029/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_II_%282002%29Extd_Ed_720p_x264_by_RiddlerA

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5472865/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_III_%282003%29_Extd_Ed_720p_x264_by_RiddlerA

Riddler is the top uploader on tpb so the quality will be great, so i will appreciate it if you can cancel your request and download these instead because it doesn't make sense for me to encode almost replicas of the ones riddler uploaded but if you still want me to do them i will keep them on my list 

@All
this is why i ask you to search before requesting "
,washisth,2010-10-08T09:41Z,"@gunnersrock
Thanks man"
