,Evilness74,2010-10-02T12:45Z,"WORKS JUST PERFECT.   :)

From Evilness"
,ron916,2010-10-02T21:05Z,Virustotal.com reports this as being clean but I haven't installed it yet.
,hardlime,2010-10-07T21:31Z,"Thanks for the up chattachitto.

Otookie, look in the program data folder for win 7 on your local drive....(C:) usually.
It should be in the slysoft/anydvd hd folder....change the .reg file to .bak or something as with all other versions."
,hardlime,2010-10-07T21:45Z,Sorry meant to say change the anydvd.chk to anydvd.bak not the reg file.
,kimms,2010-10-09T02:05Z,"for Win7, the file to delete is located in C:\ProgramData\SlySoft\AnyDVD"
,thewoodishard,2010-10-13T20:37Z,"Keep getting the (Trial has ended) notification, is there any way to totally remove it. I uninstalled it and removed the files from programs and did a registry search and deleted them as best i could, then did a fresh install and i get the same notification. Is there any software to remove this. thanks"

,group23,2010-10-15T17:21Z,"Installed fine on one machine, but registration does not work on another machine.  Any ideas?"
,group23,2010-10-15T17:29Z,"Everything worked perfectly on one machine, but the registry does not work on another, and there is no anydvd.chk (or similar file) to rename.  I have tried to install older versions as well without success.  Any ideas?"
,theoriginalphantom,2010-10-19T15:08Z,"@thewoodishard
You will need to show hidden files, then browse through to program data which is normally located on your c drive. Browse through to slysoft,anydvd, then either delete the .chk file or rename it to .bak.
After that you should be all good.
Many thanks CC, great torrent as usual mate."
,moon_princessa,2010-10-19T21:12Z,do you think you could get spector pro 2010 ?
,RrobinHood,2010-10-23T19:52Z,"thewoodishard,
Didi u solv the problem?  I have exactly same truble. CanÂ´t find any .chk in anydvd map
Thanx for any help"
,halfmonkey,2010-10-31T10:17Z,Any possibility of version 6.7.1.0 ?
,mmmp9sjl,2010-10-31T11:56Z,"i've tried installing this on 3 different PC's (Windows 7 & Windows XP), and followed the instructions carefully, but couldn't find the anydvd.chk file anywhere, even with reveal hidden files on all PC's. sure it worked but after a day, it keeps saying the trial period is over, and closes the program. time to download the updated version to try.... "
,pariahdog,2010-11-01T22:06Z,"I also get the ""trial expired"" message no matter what I do. I followed the directions precisely. There is no anydvd.chk anywhere. I am running XP. My hidden files are always displayed. My internet connection is physically unplugged during and after installation. Maybe the patch only works on Windows 7. Can anyone confirm that they have gotten this working on XP? I wish I knew where they hid that damn file. I have looked everywhere. I'm going to try the next older version."
,a_p_tpb,2010-11-02T06:03Z,"To fix ""trial expired"" message, make sure hidden files are visible, navigate to Application Data folder for All Users (different for different versions of Windows).  Inside will be a file called ""zreglib"". Open with a text editor to make sure it's related to AnyDVD, then delete it."
,pariahdog,2010-11-02T17:10Z,"I did delete .zreglib from all users\application data. It's not well hidden at all. So obvious in fact that it makes me wonder if it is just a decoy. And anyDVD.chk in Windows 7 may also be a decoy. AnyDVD doesn't seem to notice when I delete it. It recreates it whenever the program is run. Somehow I have managed to reset my trial timer though. Probably from all the registry erasing I did Or maybe when I deleted ElbyCDIO.sys. There are some tools for resetting the trial which I have started trying to use. Fox Killer supposedly doesn't work anymore, but there is NovaKiller 1.5 and AnyDVD Leftover Killer. Both of which I got from Demonoid. But I would like to get rid of the trial mode and nothing seems to work for that. Why is no one working on an actual crack? I'm tempted to try cracking the executables myself. I've read that ElbyCDIO.sys in the system32\drivers directory has trial mode code in it. So that probably needs to be cracked as well. This ChatChitto stuff only seems to work in a small number of cases. Or maybe it only works on Windows 7."
,PirBay,2010-11-08T21:46Z,"Anyone have the New version? 

Version 6.7.1 it, I think has the new protection removal for AACS MKB version 19 .  Toy Story 3 and some of the other newer Blu-Rays has it as well. Getting a AACS MKB version 19 Error.  (BTW this version worked like a charm for older blu-rays.. )  Well done.  "
[V],catflap,2010-11-12T08:11Z,"i had a registering problem with 6.7.0.1
from this torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5869041
 quite a few others also had probs basically
because we did the setup wrong.

but i was finally able to clean out the system and
so i tried chattchittos 6700 and it works.

it has an easy patching app and
instructions are simple, especially
if you have win7."
,JPHaseler,2010-11-16T23:49Z,installed fine but i was not able to aquire a vital update in order to read one of my new blu ray discs
,Steppenwolf1948,2010-11-20T13:12Z,"@ catflap
I have the very same problem as many of us do. In Win7 I keep getting the ""Trial Period Expired"" message. How did you manage to clean up your system. I've looked through the registry, made hidden files visible and found the program data/slysoft/anydvd map where I renamed the file.
It didn't help. Any suggestions? "
[V],catflap,2010-11-21T18:04Z,"@Steppenwolf1948

uninstall it-

then in registry, delete EVERYTHING with
slysoft and anydvd, including folders.

when you reinstall it, instead of renaming
anydvd.chk to anydvd.bak, delete it (just move
it to a different folder so it's not
completely lost in case it doesn't work.)

but that's what i did and it worked.

and follow the installation instructions."
,fire96825,2010-11-25T08:09Z,chattchitto rocks... all of your stuff... incredible!!!  when is 6.7.3.0 anydvd coming out?
,sirceejxyz,2010-12-26T20:17Z,followed the instructions and it worked perfectly ps; i have windows 7 
,faheyd,2011-02-04T02:53Z,"It kept saying it needed a registered copy, even after deleting the chk file.  However, I went into anydvd settings and un-checked the 'automatically check for updates'"
