Deep Freeze instantly protects and preserves baseline computer configurations. No matter what changes a user makes to a workstation, simply restart to eradicate all changes and reset the computer to its original state - right down to the last byte. Expensive computer assets are kept running at 100% capacity and technical support time is reduced or eliminated completely. The result is consistent trouble-free computing on a truly protected and parallel network, completely free of harmful viruses and unwanted programs.
While Deep Freeze provides bulletproof protection, its non-restrictive approach also improves user productivity and satisfaction. Placing no restrictions on a user's ability to access all system resources, users avoid the frustration of downtime due to software conflicts, operating system corruption, virus attacks, and many other problems. Users are always assured of computers that are consistently operable and available

Deep Freeze Server Enterprise instantly protects and preserves original server configurations. It is 100% successful at restoring the server on every restart down to the last byte. Servers are always kept at peak performance because Deep Freeze prevents operating system corruption and hard disk fragmentation, and as a result, software support issues are dramatically reduced.

Deep Freeze Server Enterprise provides IT professionals with centralized deployment and flexible management control. The Enterprise Console allows IT professionals to install, control, and manage Deep Freeze server computers
