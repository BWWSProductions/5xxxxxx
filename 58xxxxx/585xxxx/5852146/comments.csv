This program is so incredibly intelligent that it is how computers should have been designed from day 2. Bill G should have thought of it! I thought that lil program ""Sandboxie"" was cool, now even Acronis Backup uses the technology. Think of what this could do for the huge school networked computers... instead of limiting everything like a kiosk computer, now students can't ruin it all for the next guys. It's complicated to set up and you got to know what your doing but it is so cool, but get ""Data Igloo"" too, peeps or you will lose everything you ever save, like torrents and porn LOL..."
