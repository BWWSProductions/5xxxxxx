Sailor is the second album by American rock band The Steve Miller Band, released in 1968. It was the last Steve Miller Band album to feature contributions by Boz Scaggs.

Sailor (October 1968 - reissued as Living In The U.S.A. in 1973)

Steve Miller (born October 5, 1943, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) is an American guitarist and singer-songwriter. Beginning his career in blues and blues rock, Miller's music later changed to a more popular-oriented sound which earned him success with a series of singles and albums from the mid 1970s through the early 1980s.

Miller developed a high degree of music business acumen. Aware that songs earn individual publishing royalties no matter what their length, he separated the 57-second electronic introduction from the song "Sacrifice" on Book of Dreams, named it "Electro Lux Imbroglio" and published it separately, earning thousands of extra dollars as a result. On the heels of this massive success, Miller took a long hiatus from recording and touring, emerging in 1981 with Circle of Love. Sales were disappointing, however, and in 1982 he returned to the pop formula with another hit album, Abracadabra. This was Miller's last great commercial success; a series of collections, live albums and attempts to find a new style appeared in 1984 (Italian X-Rays), 1986 (Living in the 20th Century) and 1988 (Born 2B Blue), but after 1993's effort, Wide River, Miller gave up recording records altogether for some considerable time.

Although the Steve Miller Band had limited peak commercial success, his ongoing popularity has been notable. In 1978, Greatest Hits 1974-1978 was released. The album contained all the big hits from his two most popular albums, Fly Like an Eagle and Book of Dreams (plus the title track from The Joker), which were recorded during the same recording sessions in 1976 and subsequently released one year apart. This popularity also fueled successful concert tours throughout the 1980s and 1990s, often with large numbers of younger people being present at the concerts, many of whom were fans of the big hits and inevitably purchased the greatest hits album. Miller would often headline shows with other classic rock acts, and played a variety of his music, including a selection of his blues work dating from the late 1960s.

On hearing the news of the death of Les Paul in 2009, Miller responded "I can not believe he is gone, I will miss him very much, my prayers go out to him."

In 2009, Miller was inducted into the Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Fame.

Miller released Bingo! on June 15, 2010. The albums of blues covers is his first in seventeen years. It is released through his own Space Cowboy label in partnership with Roadrunner/Loud & Proud Records.
