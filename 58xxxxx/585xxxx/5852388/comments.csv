[V],ClaudiaZ,2010-09-28T21:18Z,I'm having a million problems with Days episodes...I'm afraid I won't upload it by now. Sorry guys!
,eurogr,2010-09-29T04:59Z,It's oik ClaudiaZ! Thanks for the uploads! 
,SoWErA,2010-09-30T17:39Z,you gonna start uploading again? even as DvdVeeken is?
,SoWErA,2010-09-30T18:28Z,"Anyway I won't mind if you let the work over to DvdVeeken permanently since his latest 2 eps vs yours is higher quality even if yours are higher resolution. Then again his takes 80mb more but I rather take 200mb more if meens higher quality)

Thanks anyway for all the other Days of our lives releases you uploaded."
