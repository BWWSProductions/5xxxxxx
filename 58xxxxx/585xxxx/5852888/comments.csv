Some DVD players will not play AVI files with AC3 audio. I solved the problem by using MediaCoder (a free programme) to change the audio from AC3 to MP3, while copying the XVID video unchanged. Go to the video tab in MediaCoder, select Copy Video, uncheck Auto-Select for Source and Encoder, and select MEncoder for Source and Encoder (the default XVID encoder does not support streaming). On the Audio tab, select Encoder = LAME MP3 and Format = MP3. On the Container tab, select AVI."
[T],Pharos2001,2010-09-26T17:20Z,I play w/ Zoomplayer/FFDShow via HDMI on my LCD television so it does not matter. It plays fine on any DivX certified DVD players. 720*400 is max. W*H for regular televisions.
[T],Pharos2001,2010-09-26T17:27Z,+ that must be the cheapest piece of .... DVD player in the developed world I spend $$$ to get a 100% perfect quality which I then give away & then all at once I have to accommodate your BS standards?. Now you do the same i.e. Spend $$$.. Writing this BS twice? Who exactly are you?
,Tari1977,2010-10-02T13:42Z,"Pharos2001, My apologies if my post was unclear. I was not suggesting for a moment that you change your standards. I was merely trying to help others who apprecite the superb quality of your 720x400 video but, like me, have trouble playing the files on their DVD player. For your information, I have a DivX-HD certified Samsung 5500 Blu-Ray player which successfully plays a wide range of AVI, MKV, WMV and MP4 files at resolutions up to 1920x1080. Again, my sincere thanks for your postings of such high quality recordings of QI."
