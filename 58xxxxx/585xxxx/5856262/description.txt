In 1997, Pallotta wrote, directed and produced his first film, The High Road, and later produced several of Bob Sabiston's animated projects. Pallotta then worked with Linklater on his animated film Waking Life in 2003. Alex Jones makes an appearance in the film.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
