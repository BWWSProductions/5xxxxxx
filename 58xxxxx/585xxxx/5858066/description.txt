------Gameplay--------
The gameplay in Alone In The Dark differs greatly from other games in the series. It is set out through DVD-style 'episodes', where the player can choose to start the game from the beginning, or choose to skip to a section if they get stuck. If they choose to do so, the past events are recollected in a "Previously on Alone In The Dark..." cutscene at the start of the episode.

Alone In The Dark has an interchangeable first and third person camera, and puzzle solving style gameplay. The player can switch to first-person view if they choose to. The environment plays a big part of core gameplay, as the player can pick up any object (such as pipes, wood, etc.) and use it as a melee weapon. It can also be used to smash in doors, and knock objects over. Fire is generated in real-time, as objects can be set alight by holding it over the fire, and it can be extinguished. If the fire isn't extinguished fast enough, the flames will continue to regenerate. The player can pick up objects, and combine to make different styles of weapons, however only some objects can be combined with others. Any object which is shot at or thrown will be destroyed instantly.

If the player takes damage, open wounds appear on Edward's outfit. Players must use a medical spray, or if the wounds are too deep, use bandages to heal themselves. Similar to Dark Sector, if Edward takes too much damage, the screen will flash red, and a heartbeat sound will be heard indicating that he is bleeding out.

--------Plot--------
The game begins with Edward, a paranormal investigator and the main character, being taken to the roof of the building he is in to be killed. The guard is killed by an unseen force, allowing Edward to escape. He has amnesia and doesn't remember anything. As he wanders the building looking for a way out, he witnesses several people being killed or possessed by "demonic" forces. During his search for an exit, he meets Sarah Flores, an art dealer (city planner in the Wii version). Together, they make their way to the parking garage, where they find Theophile Paddington, an old man who claims to know whatÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s going on. He says that the chaos in the building was caused by a stone that, until recently, was held by Edward. It had been taken from Edward by a man named Crowley, who released its power. Theophile has the stone now, and finally states that in order to end the chaos, Edward must follow the "Path of Light", before it is too late.

The three of them take a car from the garage and head out into the city, finding it in the same kind of chaos as the building they just left. They crash the car in Central Park. There, Theophile claims that he lacks the strength to continue. He hands the stone over to Edward and asks him and Sarah to meet him at the museum, then kills himself.

On the way to the museum, Edward finds out that his last name is Carnby. He tells his name to a doctor that he meets who tends to his wounds. As the doctor checks EdwardÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s medical history, he informs Edward that the only Edward Carnby in his records disappeared in 1938.

At the museum, the ghost of Theophile explains more about the stone. It contained Lucifer after he was cast out of heaven, until Crowley released him. Lucifer now wants to use the stone to bring about the end of the world. Theophile tells Edward that there is a secret in Central Park that will allow Edward to stop Lucifer. As Edward makes his way back to Central Park, Sarah remains at the museum, e-mailing excerpts from TheophileÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s diary that she believes will help Edward. Once at Central Park, Edward meets Hermes, who holds a stone similar to the one that Edward has.

Edward and Hermes return to the museum to find Crowley holding Sarah at gunpoint, demanding EdwardÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s stone. Edward shoots Crowley in the head, then Hermes opens a cavern in the museum that leads to LuciferÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s gateway to reality. Hermes combines his stone with EdwardÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s then tells Edward that Lucifer will soon be reincarnated. As Lucifer begins to take EdwardÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s body, Sarah grabs the stone to prevent Edward from being possessed. At this point, the player is presented a choice to shoot Sarah to prevent her from being possessed, or do nothing. If the player chooses to shoot Sarah, Edward becomes possessed by Lucifer. Otherwise, Edward and Sarah say goodbye as Sarah is taken over.
