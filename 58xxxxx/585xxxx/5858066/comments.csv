,Garathy,2010-12-15T12:54Z,"Why it's not working?
It says that cfg is bad & re-install could fix it...
I did it , several times, yet it solved nothing.
What am I doing wrong?"
,ZeroSeek,2010-12-22T20:23Z,"Thx dude! Loving the zombie games. 
Do you know any games where you play as the zombie ? Instead of the humans killing the zombies. I once found a game like that but i have win 7 and it wouldn't run on it, it being a very old game."

[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-01-05T14:30Z,"@ZeroSeek you're thinking of ""stubbs the zombie""

@XxXDoWNLoADeRXxX get a life. no viruses here

@ANYONE/EVERYONE thinking it has a virus. avast sucks to start with. that virus would be a ""false-positive"" meaning it's not a virus. look it up

,Palon,2011-01-09T01:28Z,"Torrent very good, download speed also good. About 500 kb/s (I've got 6Mb internet). There are ain't viruses, but I've got one problem, I can't hear dialogs :( The game is alright, but controls sucks, if you don't have gamepad it will be really difficult to play."

,ReactorX,2012-02-14T06:35Z,"If anyone is getting in-game and/or cut scenes sound problems then I have a very simple solution. If DirectX hasn't been updated in awhile or you have missed a couple of updates then here's what you need to do: Download DirectX Web Update from here http://www.yourfilelink.com/get.php?fid=761529 - After downloading, run and the web update only installs the required updates that you are missing and doesn't change anything else. After the update is complete then you'll have sound, b/g sound, voices or whatever you didn't have in the game or/and games you didn't have before. This is from personal experience cause I download Silent Hill: Home Coming, I had cut scene voices but, no music or nothing, it was even lagging or should I say out of sync voices from cut scenes & so after searching for awhile I found out my problem. . some of my DirectX files where out of date, after installation everything was fixed. I uploaded the DirectX Web Update onto Your File Link so people wouldn't have to deal with MS but it'll help with any game having these problems. To all of you, I hope that I have been helpful to every or/and anyone so please let me know if it worked for you too. If you need more help then Ill be here to help."
,ReactorX,2012-02-14T08:00Z,"@FuCtUpPuNk I know there isn't any viruses cause I mounted the image, installed it and been playing it ever since! Sir, thank you for such a wonderful release."
