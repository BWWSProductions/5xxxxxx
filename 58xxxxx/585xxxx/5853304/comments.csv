,Sayianmagick,2010-09-26T06:10Z,Will this get you banned from Xbox Live due to Piracy?
,Dragon422,2010-09-26T06:16Z,"No one has been banned, but I will say try at your own risk."
,Sayianmagick,2010-09-26T07:29Z,Have you tried these on other consoles other than your own?  I believe that these will all be trial versions on other consoles.
,Dragon422,2010-09-26T14:52Z,"Yes, these work on other consoles."
,Dragon422,2010-09-26T15:12Z,"I realized a mistake in my instructions. Basically, if you don't see the folder named Content when you plug in your Flash Drive, instead *make* one with the name ""Content"", or alternatively, when your Flash Drive is in your Xbox, just create a new Profile on the USB, and it will create the Content folder automatically."
,bzzzzzo,2010-09-26T16:49Z,"? Dragon422: What are you talking about? This wont work unless you have a jtaged 360. If you copy the games off your harddrive, they will have YOUR digital signature on them. Only JTAG xbox can play these. Or what's your explanation?"
,Dragon422,2010-09-26T18:02Z,"bzzzzzo: These work on non-Jtag'd Xbox's, though only on Xbox Live.

It's basically the same thing as a friend coming over with a Memory Card and Xbox Arcade games, and you being able to play them on your Xbox after you sign into his account (in which you can also be signed into your account on another controller, or sign out of your *friends* account and on to yours after you start the game).

I include the original profile (modded of course, so an infinite amount of people can be signed in at one time), which works the same way as a friend's profile on your Xbox, and let's you play all their games (which you have to use the ones included in the pack, because the Digital Signature is linked to those, and trial games you already have won't work with it).

This also works with DLC (like map packs and stuff) and Games on Demand (like 360 games, such as GTA4 and Bioshock+DLC, and original Xbox games, like Black, GTA: San Andreas, and Halo: Combat Evolved), which I can also include in future packs. (I will also RAR the games separately next time, so you can manually choose which games you want to download, and which you don't, to make it easier)"
,Dragon422,2010-09-26T18:06Z,"So in other words, all these games have been bought off the original account on the Xbox Marketplace. It's just a loop hole though, that allows everyone to play the game from that one profile."
,Strikefear13,2010-09-26T18:45Z,Bzzzzo is saying shit before doing his research.  This was figured out a while back.   Works perfectly.  Thanks for the upload!
,bzzzzzo,2010-09-26T20:03Z,"Ok, thanks Dragon422. I learned something. Thanks for the upload. And Strikefear13: it was a simple question, now fuck off asshole"
,xxxmas76,2010-09-26T20:34Z,Can you do the full games on live like Need For Speed Undercover? Or just these little ones? Thanks this is a neat trick btw will be good for my new 4Gb model I'm getting this week.
,jtaker,2010-09-26T21:37Z,"Would it be possible to do Morrowind? I don't think it's an Arcade game, but would it be possible?"
,Dragon422,2010-09-26T23:10Z,"Small Tip: If you have a small Flash Drive and wish to be able to put more games on at a time, you can put the files onto the Flash Drive, and in the Memory section of the Dashboard, you can then ""Move"" them to your Hard Drive and they will still work."
,ServerModerator,2010-09-26T23:23Z,So it's important that I need Live?
,Dragon422,2010-09-27T00:26Z,"@ServerModerator: Yes, it won't work unless you're connected to Live, so if you have a banned Xbox, or just don't have Live (Silver or Gold), these won't be Full Games."
,AcidReignFalls,2010-09-27T14:38Z,It helps to seed...
,razorfishy,2010-09-28T17:22Z,"Well after some messing about with it.. I noticed to what the uploader said... if you don't see the folder named Content when you plug in your Flash Drive, instead *make* one with the name ""Content"", or alternatively, when your Flash Drive is in your Xbox, just create a new Profile on the USB, and it will create the Content folder automatically. i did this followed the rest of the instructions and this does work :) my xbox is not jtag'd its just flashed :) also it hasnt banned my xbox either :)... only thing is now i want more games lol so any chance of Toy solders and trials HD :P or any others u may have :)

this is a nice upload !!! so thx Dragon422 "
,Dragon422,2010-09-28T19:38Z,"I can upload Trials HD+DLC I believe (from what I heard, it works), though, Toy Soldier has been tried, though does not work (it might be a DRM related problem).

Another game I know that also doesn't work is Blacklight: Tango Down, due to DRM (it only works on the original Xbox it was downloaded for, even if you try to play it with the original profile on another Xbox, it won't work)."
,fales123,2010-09-28T23:06Z,"Really great work Dragon422, works like a charm! Can't wait for your next upload! Do you know how long it takes for your new upload? Can't thank you enough dude!"
,fales123,2010-09-28T23:25Z,"Really great work Dragon 422, it works like a charm! Can't wait for your next upload! How long do you think you will need untill your next upload? Can you get Shadow Complex or Deathspank in the next one? Again, thanks man! "
,Xlemonad,2010-09-29T21:49Z,thanks a lot dragon! trials + dlc would be very appreciated!
,yosnowman,2010-09-30T20:09Z,Every time I try to log into one of the accounts it says your console can't connect to xbox live and asks me if i want to test connection and then logs the account out but when i sign in my account everything is fine any help?
,yosnowman,2010-09-30T20:11Z,Oh and Limbo and Dead Rising Case Zero in your next pack would be awesome!
,xXxGamejunkiexXx,2010-10-01T16:53Z,Why you tell this work when nothing work ??? or more explication please ... i cant sign in with any of your profile and they always telling me corrupted profile ? 
,iguanas,2010-10-01T22:18Z,"Works perfectly. Thanks! I would love to have Defense Grid. I played the demo and its a very interesting and addictive game.
Thanks a lot M8.!"
,Juanxrocker,2010-10-03T06:34Z,Can we get some seeders? I'll be sure to seed when I'm done. I really wanna see if this'll work. I really wanna play Banjo-Kazooie and Plants vs. Zombies!!!
,Juanxrocker,2010-10-03T09:39Z,"Would it be possible for the next pack to have Worms 2, Snoopy Flying Ace, 3D Ultra Minigolf, South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!, Mad Tracks + DLC, I know its alot but It'd be cool if any of my suggestions make it to the next pack. Thanks and I'll be looking forward to the next pack and can someone please seed? I'm still trying to download the first pack"
,phil360,2010-10-05T16:46Z,I would love to have Shadow Complex in the next release - been dying to play that!
,dubkulture,2010-10-07T10:15Z,"YEH! great! Want Banjo & Tooie aswell, most epic game released - EVER!

,SteffanDavies,2011-07-04T21:21Z,"Same here, the profiles are corrupted, what's wrong?"
,cowmilk99,2011-07-06T11:11Z,"I did everything, but when I plug it into my Xbox, it doesn't even have anything on it. I'm thinking that's because when I open my device on the USB Xtaf program (the first time I open it before I put anything on it), there is no folder called ""0. {dir}Content"" at all. Just the "".."" is visible. Is it my flash drive? Do I need a new one?

I also noticed that when I formatted my drive to work on my Xbox, when it was done, a message popped up that said something along the lines of ""Device was formatted but it isn't suitable for Xbox 360 and you will notice big problems playing games, viewing profiles, etc. from this drive."" That's not even close to the exact wording, but I think you get it. You think that could be the problem? Do I just need a different Flash drive?"
,cowmilk99,2011-07-06T11:40Z,"Ok. I got my Xbox to recognize that it had content on the drive (turns out I had to create the ""0. {dir}Content"" folder myself. Might want to put that in the Readme or something), but now when I try to sign into the profile, I can't because it says it's corrupted! HELP! I'm stumped on this one!"
