A small pack of Xbox Live Arcade games to play without a Jtag. These are full games, and you can earn achievements and play online multiplayer (with Gold membership of course).

Requires a Flash Drive (anywhere between 1 GB and 16 GB should work, though if it's 1 GB, it won't hold some games) or a Hard Drive + Transfer Cable, an Xbox Live connection (doesn't have to be Gold) to play the games in full, and sometimes requires 2 controllers to get the games to start properly.

Step by Step Instructions on how to play are included in a text file, which I tried to make very simple for even the most basic computer user able to follow.

The games include:

Banjo-Kazooie
Duke Nukem 3D
Duke Nukem - Manhattan Project
Exit
Kingdom for Keflings
Magic the Gathering
Marathon Durandal
Metal Slug 3
Monkey Island Special Edition
Pac-Man Championship Edition
Peggle
Plants vs Zombies
Space Invaders Infinity Gene

I have tested all these games personally to work properly except Magic the Gathering and Monkey Island. Next pack will include much more games. Include some suggestions on which games you'd like to see, and I'll try to make it happen.
