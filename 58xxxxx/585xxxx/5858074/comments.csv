Imagine it like this, the ultimate zombie game, designed and programmed by politicians, lawyers, and retarded programmers.

,Duhya2,2011-08-04T07:16Z,Can i find the developer's website or blog somewhere?
,Bjjorick,2011-09-02T12:39Z,"Okay, I had the same problem the rest of you had with the error message.  This is how you fix it.

I ran the set up file.  It would get to about 70% complete, give the error message and close.  I updated everything, ran all the files, restarted, closed daemon tools, etc etc etc, nothing worked.  So i looked at the installer before closing it.  It said C:/Users/(account name, for me, Bjjorick)/APPData/Local/Temp/redist/xxx.xxx.

The xxx is any number of files it was looking for. This torrent included a redist file with it, so i mve it to  C:/Users/Bjjorick/APPData/Local/Temp/ and then ran the setup.  It ran just fine.  

Just take the redist file that came with this torrent, move it there, problem should be fixed.

I hope this helps someone."

,Atomsk1,2011-10-17T18:49Z,im really suspicious about this NSIS:fasec-CD virus being a false positive. every other false positive ive had has been a heuristically-determined generic trojan of some kind. this one is specific
,Unclesaba,2011-10-19T23:34Z,"I don't trust this torrent, my system throws a virus warning and by a few google searches on fort zombie and false positives the only site it finds is this very page. Can anybody give an url to a paradox or kerberos page that verifies that the game may give a false positive?"
,vernisan,2011-12-04T04:35Z,"Don't download this shit. Gives u a trojan virus, and is missing ALOT of files that are needed to play the game. -_-"
,kidlonewolf,2012-01-04T05:14Z,@everyone plz do not download. sorry uploader but this contains trojan.win32.generic.    which is not ssomething u want so if fuckuppunk did not know there thats that but still its not good. so again plz do not download
,MIXicant,2012-01-13T12:59Z,"No idea about the past, but as [@Atomsk1 , @Unclesaba , @vernisan , @kidlonewolf] says/suspects/et cetera, this torrent [now] has a trojan

Windows Defender (lol) called it a severe threat so tread carefully"
,Moca97,2012-01-19T14:53Z,It works just install physix and delete setup.exe
,Alenthas,2012-02-15T17:03Z,this game had a lot of potential. ruined by shitty gameplay. only if they made it an fps and made it harder to aim instead of leaving aiming to the stupid character. camera and animations are worse than I have ever seen. searching for items is pain in the ass. your character cant see a HUGE red + sign thats right in front of him.
,Shooterman6y,2012-04-03T03:13Z,Very good game worked well no problems no viruses and overall satisfaction FuCtUpPuNk is a good one to get your torrents from.
,Kamianbu,2012-04-09T11:42Z,"I admit I got the same virus warning with this installer, so I immediately deleted it.

But since this is ONLY copy of Fort Zombie I can find, I would appreciate it if someone with a skull or someone can truly verify that it works and that the virus is a false positive."

,Majestik1,2012-05-09T08:00Z,This game seems like a real MUTHER fucker to get for some reason - usually means it fukking blows. I ONLY want the game because my zombie game crazed nephew. the character in the game looks JUST LIKE HIM!!! HAHAHA - so i have to fucking have it. (he even named his cat Romero after George Romero)
,Majestik1,2012-05-09T08:47Z,"OK - HERE ARE THE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Borrowing some of Bjjorick's method, I have figure out how to install this muther fukker.

1] Go to C:/Users/*USER NAME*/APPData/Local/Temp/ and then ran the setup as Administrator. It will unpack some needed files - then you get the error. Click OK and close the installer.

2] Copy ALL the files from the 'redist' folder to the above mentioned folder (C:/Users/*USER NAME*/APPData/Local/Temp/)

3] In the Temp folder (C:/Users/*USER NAME*/APPData/Local/Temp/) double click the 'FortZombieSetup.msi' file to begin installation.

I am running this game on Windows 7 Ultimate x64 in full screen 1920x1080

Works perfect.

There is NO viruses in ANY of the installation packages whatsoever. I am running ESET v5 and ripped EVERYTHING apart using 7-Zip.

Thanks FuctUpPunk. I finally have a copy of this game.

PEACE!!!
