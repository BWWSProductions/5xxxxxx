Extermination Mode is the NEW feature and it instantly kills all zombies so you can get somewhere fast or explore without hassle."

,stickasaurus,2010-09-29T23:26Z,Avast Internet Security detects a threat. Is this a false positive?
,MektonZero,2010-09-30T05:00Z,"Just to be sure I ran it by VirusTotal, 35 of the 41 anti virus programs don't report it as a problem (it shows 35 of 43 but it's not fair to count Avast and McAfee twice because they each have two versions of their program).  Out of the 6 engines that show it as malware, they aren't specific and just report ""malware"" or ""suspicious program"".

Good enough for me to use it. :)
