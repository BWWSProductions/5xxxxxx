,gold_lion,2010-09-26T22:30Z,Uploaded by Anonymous... Let us know if any of you guys get an email about this one. Glad to here it's the real deal though.
,stuntdriv3r,2010-09-26T23:28Z,"It wasn't UL'd by a studio, so why would you get an email?"
,gold_lion,2010-09-27T06:57Z,"... In case ""anonymous"" turns out to be a studio. Are you kidding?"
,stuntdriv3r,2010-09-27T17:54Z,"It was up'd by me, First time doing so so I felt it best to be anonymous...

Seems I did alright as it is now finally showing up by the popular up-loaders. I did ask a question on how to save a VOD a few days back in one of the new Elm Street torrents but go no responses... needless to say I figured it out and all in all if mine is what others used great, I'm glad I was able to pull it off."
