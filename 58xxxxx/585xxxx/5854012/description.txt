 Ted Danson returns as caring but prickly Dr. John Becker in the third season of this hit sitcom, in which Becker considers getting back together with old flame Megan and defends himself against a lawsuit brought by a patient with a heart condition. Meanwhile, blind Jake (Alex DÃ©sert) mistakenly receives a driver's license, and gal-pal Reggie (Terry Farrell) accuses Becker of giving preferential treatment to attractive patients.
