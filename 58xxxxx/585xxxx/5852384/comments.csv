,RuneRifle,2010-09-25T20:52Z,previous torrent had a bad file in it. File removed and reuploaded.
,papreni,2010-10-12T13:31Z,so what do i have to do to download this game... sorry guys but i dont get this computer stuffslol...lol
,RuneRifle,2010-10-12T20:44Z,"1) Get WinRar if you haven't already got it.
2) Rightmouseclick on the .rar file you've downloaded
3) Extract here
4) Watch it being busy and extracting it
5) When done, there are tons of files.
5.1) For the normal Age of Empires, doubleclick on empires2.exe to play
5.2) For the expansion, doubleclick MYTH-age2_x1.exe to play.

That's all ;)"
,skapecan,2010-10-19T21:32Z,Thanks! just what I was looking for. No need to install.
,anontorrent123,2010-11-01T01:42Z,223 MB for AOE2? That seems a little large.
,anontorrent123,2010-11-01T01:46Z,"I stand corrected, it works. Good torrent, thanks!

(btw, when you extract the .rar, you dont need to create a folder, just extract everything to you C:\\Program Files folder)"
,RuneRifle,2010-11-01T15:35Z,"little large? 
well it does have some user profiles and stuff that I forgot to remove :P but it works great ;)

and it doesn't really matter where you extract it :P you can even play it portable on a USB drive^^"
,trevor1996,2010-11-05T20:53Z,do i have to mount anything or i can just play it. because i dont get that stuff
,RuneRifle,2010-11-07T13:13Z,"You can just play it, don't have to mount or anything.

If there's a file missing or something, re-download it then, i've seen it happen before. After downloading again it's fixed"
,Roban43,2010-11-21T11:48Z,"Huge thankÂ´s to Runerifle.

,EddieOwen,2010-11-24T20:33Z,"Woah, great torrent! Works perfectly + No Viruses! Downloaded in just over 10 minutes."
,xdemagosx,2010-11-29T06:07Z,"Downloaded it, went fine, went to play with got into a game, as soon as it started, the camera scrolled to the left and wouldnt move.

Any idea why? I tried to redownload it, (3 times)
Still nothing changed, fix it."
,RuneRifle,2010-11-30T12:12Z,"I'm not sure what the problem is, and what's causing this.

Maybe you should take a look on the forum and maybe ask it there. I'm sure they can help you with it.

,nyarf13,2010-12-02T16:01Z,great torrent. no need to install. thank you!
,RuneRifle,2010-12-08T14:23Z,"DirectPlay/LAN in multiplayer options does work, so i guess Hamachi will work too ;)"
,monky100100,2010-12-09T15:51Z,4 minutes 25 seconds..... downloaded in the time it took me to get a cup of coffee 
,bitteeinbit01,2010-12-12T00:43Z,"So I can put this on a usb key, start it up on my computer, then bring it to another computer to play in lan? Without even installing? I just want to confirm before downloading that I can play this online (LAN or ip). So far this seems like the best aoc upload. Also, do you think it's possible to play online (with other players) on the zone (if that even still exists)? I would need a cd key i suppose?"
,RuneRifle,2010-12-12T12:51Z,"You can put it on a usb drive, but running it, then removing the drive will stop the game because it can't recall files when it has to, so you'll need to copy it.

LAN does work. I've played this game alot of times with my sister.

Online via ZONE will not work, because you need a legit key and an account.. but if LAN works, Hamachi probably works too."
,DemonStriker85,2010-12-13T00:06Z,"What version is this? 2.0a for The age for kings and 1.0c for Expansion? If not, how do I patch it, I downloaded the patches but it won't let me patch it since it is not ""installed"". I using game ranger for this, and all the matches are those versions, and I don't know how to check the versions of the game, doesn't say the versions in the corner or anything."
,1990jjd,2010-12-14T17:25Z,There seems to be a problem with the game. Its with the conquerors expansion. When ever I start the game the screen automatically moves upward. I am not able to play the game. Is there any way to fix this. When i click onthe mini map it goes back again. Pls help.

,ron286,2011-01-06T22:22Z,"holy shit, this downloaded for me in 4mins 17s.. hahah thats a quality torrent... thanks man"
,Frikkel,2011-01-07T14:23Z,"Torrent works great, but the game kinda sucks now. It used to be real cool. One little remark: There is no sound in the beginning of the campaigns, when the story is told before each mission."
,Jackxon,2011-01-12T17:36Z,"Yep, this works! But o have a small problem, the sea looks very weird. It's purple with green lines on it! Is it normal?

Im running this on W7 X64!"
,DraughtMaster,2011-01-18T14:56Z,"This doesn't work for me. When I double click the exe file called age2_x1 the cpu says ""Could not initialize program. Age Of Empiures II not detected."" What am I supposed to do? I'm running on Vista btw."
,Kanleb,2011-02-05T22:47Z,Im running windows 7 64bit and it doesnt work for me. When I run the game I just get a black screen that I cant exit out of. any suggestions?
,Kanleb,2011-02-05T22:54Z,Also when I try and run in with the correct compatibility it does not work 
,zeca.pt,2011-02-09T17:28Z,"positive: yeah, thats a classic

negative aspect:
#1. graphics are terrible, colors f*cked 
#2. theres absolutly no audio in the cutscenes, and there are no cinematics

solutions:
#1 the only way to correct the colors is to terminate the processe ""explorer.exe"". After exiting the game, you do Ctrl+Alt+Del, ""add task"" and execute ""explorer.exe"" to make it run again.

#2, simple as downloading other torrent, here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4071194/Age_of_Empires_2___conquers
in order to have the complete audio, you must have the cds, or get a full instalation. 

this torrent, as many ""don't need to install"", are not useful if you want to play 


 though this torrent is useful to play against friends, it isnt for campaign"
,hah5000,2011-02-12T10:48Z,lol it took 5 minutes to download :-)
,Pasi98,2011-02-24T18:01Z,You Are a god!!!!!!!!! This downloaded for me 8min. 8 mb/s Internet

,Arre55,2011-07-17T21:44Z,i just get Age of Empires.rar do i need to get more?
,massivetempah,2011-09-30T11:02Z,"quick and easy install, great for njobs like me. no sound on the cutscenes though which is a massive letdown. thanks runerifle"
