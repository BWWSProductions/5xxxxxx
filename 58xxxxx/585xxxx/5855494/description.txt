Plot:
Fred Figglehorn (Lucas Cruikshank) has a crush on Judy (Pixie Lott), the girl next door. Fred's stalker, Kevin (Jake Weary), lives across the street and thwarts each attempt Fred makes to see her. When Fred finally succeeds in making it to Judy's, he finds out she has moved so he embarks on a journey to find her. Along the way, he meets Derf (also played by Cruikshank), a laid back dude that always tells him to calm down because of him always talking nonstop. His journey takes him all over town, until he discovers that Judy has moved mere minutes away. Fred's ego is hit when he discovers that Judy is having a party that he wasn't invited to, so he fuels a scheme that he believes will make him cooler than his classmates could ever imagine. Fred invites Bertha (Jennette McCurdy) to the party (but refuses to invite anyone who attended Judy's party or found the video funny), and films the entire party, doing crazy things like dressing up, dancing around, and puking cupcakes. He then forwards the video to everyone, and despite it not giving him instant popularity, Judy shows up at his house to sing with him. He proceeds to scream, ending the movie. It is also revealed who Fred's Dad (John Cena) really is by Fred's Mom (Siobhan Fallon Hogan), His Dad isn't dead or in jail, he was living by Fred all along.
