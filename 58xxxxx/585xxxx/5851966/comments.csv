,MorreE,2010-09-25T23:37Z,An english version of this game has not been released yet so it can't have english language.
,DoodleBop,2010-09-25T23:38Z,"Don't be fooled. This afternoon while looking for another torrent i ran in a lot of ""fake"" torrents (were still ger,ita, hu but written english).

Its the same release. Peoples just didn't read or test and just put it on the internet with ""english"" in it.

Waiting for someone to confirm."

BTW: I'm not sure, but it seems that now, to play online one will have to pay some additional money.... ""online pass"" or sth like that :/ am I correct?"
,puc1k83,2010-09-27T19:07Z,"Only players who will buy FIFA 11 will be able to play online for free. Everyone else will have to buy ""EA Online-Pass"" for ~10$. Shame on them!"
,tizzy1984,2010-10-03T07:24Z,how do you burn a xbox game on your computer i know u need a dual disk wat else do u need to do 
,JTyler1990,2010-10-05T01:14Z,tizzy download imgburn for free from imgburn.com. use winrar to unrar the files usually the last winrar archive file(the one wiv books) :). then open imgburn locate the file you want to burn by clicking the folder icon. select the .dvd file of the game u wanna burn (it will be the icon of imgburn. then set ur speed to 2.4x then burn..... hope that helped :)
