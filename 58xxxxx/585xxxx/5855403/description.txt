This is all the music The Historian Himself has available for download on his website www.dontmesswithdinosaurs.com as of 9/24/2010. I just made it into a single file for convenience. It includes his full album "Earth Beasts Awaken" plus 8 other promo songs. 192kbps. 

He has an interesting voice and style of music. I associate it with nerdcore but he doesn't write about computers, networking, D&D, Star Wars, etc... its more about dinosaurs, creatures, more "historic" things. 

This is my first torrent btw. I've used TPB for 2 years but I just created an account.

Enjoy.
