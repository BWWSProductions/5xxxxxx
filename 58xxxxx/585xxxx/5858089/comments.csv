,PirateAus,2010-11-09T07:09Z,"OST Means Original Sound Track so how could anyone get this confused with the movie - some people are dickheads.  With the OST, awesome audio quality and great music.  Articus Ross and Trent Reznor do it again."
,darkimus,2010-11-12T23:23Z,@PirateAus - it's Sound of Violence by Dennis de Laat.
