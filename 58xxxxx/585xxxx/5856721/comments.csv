,nukeZ3r0,2010-09-28T20:43Z,"Alright.  First of all, I didn't find a Keymaker included with this torrent.  Then, whoever uploaded it, zipped the ColdFusion installer, then split that zip into 63 .rar's and then zipped each one of those .rar's separately.  Pointless and iritating.  I'm not one to complain, especially when getting a $7,500 program for nothing, but it's not the way to do it.  Sorry.

Anyone have any idea for a key?"
,brazcafe,2010-09-29T04:54Z,The keymaker is that extra dmg file in the package. This is how CORE does its things if you at all familiar with Mac scene.
,nukeZ3r0,2010-09-29T05:49Z,There is no extra .dmg file.  Each one of those zip's contain a single .rar file needed for the complete extraction.  Which directory is it in?
