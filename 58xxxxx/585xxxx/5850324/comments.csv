[V],twentyforty,2010-09-25T08:25Z,"@nikoHD: I have said last week that I would wait for DVD or BluRay. All DVDSCR so far were well below the limits. However, I watched the movie and there are few funny moments.

@justregged: LAP is the same, but 700 MB crap. IMAGINE released V2 just this night - but they shouldn't be trusted. FLAWL3SS claims new audio source - but it's 1.47 GB and I'd check it out later."
