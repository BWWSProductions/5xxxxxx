,basketballboy012,2010-09-27T08:28Z,can someone let me know if this works
,FeAriou,2010-09-27T21:04Z,It should work. 
,basketballboy012,2010-09-28T03:59Z,i have a feeling this aint the right one because its only 5.8 gb and a normal game is around 6 something
,FeAriou,2010-09-28T14:47Z,"The Xbox360 version has been leaked into internet, so it is real. "
,basketballboy012,2010-09-28T20:52Z,why havent you downloaded yet if it works
,basketballboy012,2010-09-28T21:05Z,it wont even start downloading so something is wrong with this torrent
,acr250rider,2010-09-29T03:24Z,"Well i have trusted mork22 in the past, no reason not to now!"
,Paki786,2010-09-29T06:26Z,"If I burn this game right now and it's not available for online play since it's release date is next week, will I still be able to play? Also when it does release and ABGX can verify it, do I need to burn it again or will the same copy work? Thanks"
,FeAriou,2010-09-29T13:26Z,"The reason why I haven't download it, because I don't have a xbox plus I have already preorderd the game for my PC. "

,dodoSKC,2010-10-10T12:51Z,"I think this is the unfinished version since it's exactly the same size as the MARVEL one and on that version there IS NO player of the game sequence nor the game wrap up feature! If I'm wrong, please let me know because I'm dying to get my hands on a proper version. Once again, MARVEL'S version IS UNFINISHED, spread the word!"
,DukNasty,2010-10-10T19:01Z,give us a favor?........lol
,haiti1800,2010-10-15T13:58Z,"hey do you have NBA 2K11 for PS2,if you do can please upload it."
