,gabriel1475,2010-10-04T22:02Z,"Geez you pathetic kock-smoking failures, could you possibly be any less clear? Why does it say: ""went OOS around 59 min mark"" still???? That is what it said on the original. If it's fixed in the REPACK, wouldnt it make perfect common sense to fucking say:  OOS error fixed? Well...IS IT FIXED????"
