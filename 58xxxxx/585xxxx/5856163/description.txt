Rising is the third live album, and twentieth album overall, from Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. The live versions of Donovan's hits guaranteed that Rising would receive a release in both the United States and United Kingdom. Rising was retitled The Classics Live in the United States and 25 Years in Concert in Europe for marketing reasons. It was released in November 1990.
