Resources for Study of Islam - Collection 3 (Islamic Finance & Banking):

This upload is useful who are interested in studying the Islamic economic system. The cornerstone of  the Islamic economic system is the condemnation and prohibition of usury. The Qur'an contains many verses that condemn usury in the most strongest language. In Surah # 2, Verses 275-280 we read the following:

2:275  But those who take usury will rise up on the Day of Resurrection like someone tormented by Satanâ€™s touch. That is because they say, â€˜Trade and usury are the
same,â€™ 
2:276  but God has allowed trade and forbidden usury. Whoever, on receiving Godâ€™s warning, stops taking usury may keep his past gainsâ€“ God will be his judgeâ€“ but whoever goes back to usury will be an inhabitant of the Fire, there to remain. God blights usury, but blesses charitable deeds with multiple increase: He does not love the ungrateful sinner. 
2:277  Those who believe, do good deeds, keep up the prayer, and pay the prescribed alms will have their reward with their Lord: no fear for them, nor will they grieve. 
2:278  You who believe, beware of God: give up any outstanding dues from usury, if you 
true believers. 
2:279  If you do not, then be warned of war from God and His Messenger. You shall have your capital if you repent, and without suffering loss or causing others to suffer loss. 
2:280  If the debtor is in difficulty, then delay things until matters become easier for him; still, if you were to write it off as an act of charity, that would be better for you, if only you knew. 


and in Surah #3, Verse 130, we read:

3:130  You who believe, do not consume usurious interest, doubled and redoubled. Be mindful of God so that you may prosperâ€“


and in Surah #30, Verse 39, we read:

30:39  Whatever you lend out in usury to gain value through other peopleâ€™s wealth will not increase in Godâ€™s eyes, but whatever  you give in charity, in your desire for Godâ€™s approval, will earn multiple rewards.
