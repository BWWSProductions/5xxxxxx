,TheRealMoot,2010-09-30T19:29Z,"Played through the first quest. It works! Installs just fine and nothing appears to be wrong. Sadly the 1.40 patch is not the level 69 patch... just the one that lets you run this DLC. Still, more good Borderlands DLC."
,SirAnthrax,2010-09-30T20:16Z,"Just as topsc I downloaded another torrent. No level gain and when I died all of my trillions were gone. ALL my money -.-. Anyway, TheRealMoot seems to have tried this one and it appears to be the same. Gonna wait until the level cap is fixed tho.

So Basically, NO LEVEL GAINING and ALL MONEY LOST UPON DEATH. Beware..."
,Heretic1808,2010-09-30T21:34Z,"Dont know if this helps anyone, but i just looked at the gearbox site, and you have to install patch 1.40 before you install this. if you dont the dlc will still play, but it wont work correctly. maybe thats where the missing cash problem is coming from"
,SirAnthrax,2010-09-30T23:51Z,"Well, according to uploader the 1.40 patch is included. I guess it means it installs WITH the new DLC. If what you say is true, that 1.40 needs to be installed prior to the DLC, then how? And where is 1.40 only?"
,SirAnthrax,2010-10-01T00:12Z,"After some searching on the net, I found this > http://www.joystiq.com/2010/09/05/free-borderlands-update-will-raise-level-cap-rebalance-main-gam/ <

They say that the level cap will NOT be raised with the new DLC but to be released as a patch 12th oct. So, I guess it's not a bug....

The only thing remaining is that when I died, ALL my money dissapeared. WTF? Could someone try this out and confirm it's not just me?"
,TheRealMoot,2010-10-01T01:32Z,"Just did a test to check and see if I lost an exorbant amount of money when I die as well. Results: Let skags kill me (Outside firestone) lost $300. Jumped off the cliff at the start of the new DLC, lost $300. Let enemies in the next area kill me, Lost $300. I do not seem to be getting any kind of money glitch opun my death, but I did the test with a wimpy little character, not one of my level 50+ playthrough 2/DLC characters. I'll try again with my power house characters shortly after backing up my characters..."
,TheRealMoot,2010-10-01T01:42Z,"Okay, back from my second test with a level 61 playthough 2 character. I jumped off the cliff at the start of the DLC and lost $17 million dollars... however my character still reads as having $9.99 million dollars...

So either you lost all your money because the re-spawn fee for high level characters is obscene, some thing is specifically wrong with your game or my money counter is busted...

I'll blow through playthough 1 with my Level 61 Lilith and glitch hunt. I'll be back in a couple hours."
,lukegoodman2001,2010-10-01T02:09Z,1 nothing has shown up in game about the new missions and all my money has gone
,TheRealMoot,2010-10-01T05:32Z,"Just finished the DLC, all the quests and stuff work. Pretty funny too! There's even a hint as to where Borderlands 2 may take place... or could have just been another joke."
,kosjam72,2010-10-01T08:47Z,@TheRealMoot so is it working properly.
,ikarli,2010-10-01T16:36Z,"i can also confirm this works 100%,extracted to desktop 1st then copied/pasted the 3 files to game directory exactly same way as previous dlc's,i've played a few missions and also died it did take a lot of money off me but my cash was maxed out and still maxed out,not worth playing til the new level cap comes out if your a level 61 cos enemies are 55 and no challenge whatsoever"
,lukegoodman2001,2010-10-02T00:43Z,this is not working for i am not a novice at this but some reason when i go in to game no new missions have shown up anywhere on any board can anyone help?
,Furious1964,2010-10-02T23:46Z,"I'm having trouble with the voices for the special NPCs met in-game and I was wondering if anyone is getting this too. For example, I got the mission from Tannis, but in her intro she spoke with no sound."
,RMS_ST1NG3R,2010-10-04T10:07Z,100% working for me THANKS UPLOADER!!! AND THANKS RELOADED another fine release :D
,jzenman,2010-10-05T23:51Z,"Yeah what's up with the zero seeders and zero leechers? Never seen that before... 

Going to try this out... Hope I can still use WillowTree... I have some kick ass guns... "
,inb4_SEED,2010-10-07T06:35Z,"Don't worry about the displayed 0 seeders and leechers. It must be a problem on thepiratebay.org's end, because the trackers showed 211 seeds and 181 peers as soon as I opened this in uTorrent."
,motleymanphil,2010-10-10T15:56Z,"Great upload , thanx a million...Works flawless, and patch gets you back online again...

,somedude.1001,2010-11-04T05:17Z,"yea, patch 1.41 is out, the new lvl cap is 69. its usually a few days to a week until theres a crack"
,Buzzard0,2010-11-04T23:33Z,"Why include the patch when it will be outdated soon? -.-. There is already a 1.4.1, this will only cause problem because you´ll be replaceing the latest patch files with the 1.4 that are included"
,tops.c,2010-11-05T15:59Z,"@ RELOADED, Borderlands 1.4.1 Crack , Where?

It's been out since 11/2"
,DeerPark6180,2010-12-06T15:23Z,"I have this and patch v1.41, But I don't even know how to install this. Is installation directory Program Files for XP users? I would think so. And if I unrar it how do I get past the missing DLL message? It tells me to reinstall it to fix it.
Long story short, can someone give a step by step install process for dummies on this and the patch?"
,zain26,2010-12-17T11:23Z,"dude i may sound like a newb, but i extract the ""DLCsetup"" folder to my program files. then i run the setup and it asks me for a serial code... ive been lookin for one for 2hrs now -_- plz help"
,sonic222333,2011-01-05T18:14Z,Multi-language?
,JackSilk,2011-01-16T07:59Z,"I have the same issue as zain26. I usually have no problem torrenting games or dlc, but this one stumps me. "
,kedaxx,2011-02-12T00:28Z,"i've downloaded the torrent, unrar in game dir by following given instruction, but 1.40 update spoiled all the fun, i.e. it's overrited my boderlands reload razor's crack and doesn't work.
do u have to include the old update, or how to exclude it from downloaded files, seems a little mess for me, any advise where to get good working dlc, t
thanks anyway :)"

,brankozab,2011-03-08T16:33Z,Ok so i extracted and everything but when i start the game i get an error like missing file : wxmsw28u_core_vc_custom.dll so i downloaded the dll then an another and another.. etc... i tried the DLC but can't install it .. asks for serial..

,AZBlaster,2011-03-20T19:34Z,"It works 100% ,thank you uploader ,just do what the instruction says and it will work ,and some people said when they re spawn and they lost all of their money ,i let the bandits killed me and i only lost 3000$ in total of 40000$ after re spawn !!!"

1) Mis-encoded chinese text fucks up rtorrent because my UTF8 system expects normal characters.
2) A link to a chinese site. WHY?
3) Split-rars. This is neither ftp nor rapidshare, etc. It's a waste of people's time and disk space and is utterly redundant seeing as the bittorrent protocol chunks big files."
,Banzay27,2011-06-02T18:20Z,"Thanks, good torrent.
Though I was disappointed with the DLC. You'd think killing claptraps would be fun on another level. And it kinda is, the way they often explode with shotgun shots. But after the first couple hundred, they're just the new skags. And you'll be killing a lot more than that many, especially if you take Tannis' retarded quest line which has you gathering about 300+ claptrap components - which you have to cap them for. Let me warn you to skip that because you'll most likely be unimpressed by the end of it all. It really is in Borderlands style to be goofy and one up you, but after all that hassle, I was ticked off. Unless you're up for mindless farming for experience (lol), you ought to heed my warning.
Anyways, I guess the bosses are funny to meet and I won't tell why, you'll see it when you see it. The end fight and ""the end"" is also amusing. Beyond that though, really, it's hogwash and unimpressive, the way this was presented, I was something much more ingenious but this didn't really innovative Borderlands the slightest.
This definitely ranks somewhere among Dr. Ned's Zombie Island for its lack of vehicles. Knoxx's Armory was the best DLC because of the highways and vehicles, the most fun for me in that one was really the bumper cars experience when playing with 3 other fellas, even if they were random joiners. Really got a few chuckles out of me. Plus there's Scooter.
So if you're getting the game and all DLCs in one go just now, I recommend the original campaign and this DLC, and pass the rest. And preferably steer clear of side missions, they're almost always garbage content, no matter the game."
,Xsyiaris,2011-06-20T11:03Z,Do you need to have the regular game to play this?
,darcy102,2011-09-13T00:09Z,Awesome I downloaded all 4 of reloaded's borderlands dlcs and installed them in order with winrar and they work like a charm.If you use 7zip you may get error messages.I did and so I switched to winrar and I got access denied messages so I ran winrar again as administrator and it worked perfectly.You need to install the dlcs in order.Thanks reloaded for awesome uploads yet again.
