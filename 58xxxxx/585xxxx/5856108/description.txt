This summer, G4 is going to take you inside the world of competitive high stakes online poker, as we present "2 Months, $2 Million", a docu-series that follows the lives and adventures of four young high IQ friends trying to break the bank of the online poker world.

These four math whizzes are out to collectively earn $2 million dollars in only two months using their own money. Viewers will go inside the â€œwar roomâ€ of this interactive dream team who play poker nearly 24/7 and experience first-hand the excitement of winning big money and the agony of losing it all in a single hand.

Twenty-somethings math whizzes can't play poker all the time, so when Brian, Emil, Jay and Dani step away from their monitors, itâ€™s about experiencing all that Vegas has to offer from exclusive parties to beautiful women to high, nerd-adventure.
