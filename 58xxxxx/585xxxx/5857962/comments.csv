,RitchieRich,2010-11-27T01:13Z,"@beckaboo7:

This is the order everything should be performed.

1) Download the Adobe product of your choice.

2) Run the Host Patcher.

3) Install the Adobe product as a TRIAL!

4) Open the Adobe product.

5) It will then ask you for a serial number, at this point generate one for the product you are using.


That should be all you need to do. If it doesn't work then you did something wrong somewhere down the line."

The Host Patch Script simply adds entries in your host file. When Adobe tries to call out to their servers for activation it redirects back to itself and thinks everything is all good. After you run the script it allows you to see what it did."

,RitchieRich,2010-12-20T07:04Z,"@NeverMeant

There there should be multiple entries in your host file from the Adobe acrivation script. Try to run it again. If all else, as long as your Adobe product works then you should be fine. "

Had done a proper uninstall, before re-installing. Removed all prefs, + pref panes, + application support... 

Using CS4 on MBP 2008, Snow Leopard installed.

If I go online, I get: ""serial evoked"" So I could start working, making sure I'm offline when I on an Adobe program, it's a hassle though.

Once I got that I had to patch the host file, I figured, well, why not download the whole suite and do it all at once, but since the serials aren't working, I'm wondering if that's because the download now is CS5.5 and not CS5.

,RitchieRich,2011-12-15T01:00Z,"@hklauber

You should not have to create a subscription with Adobe. Simply run the activation blocker then install Adobe as a TRIAL then use one of the serials you generate with the keygen. Make sure you select the correct Adobe program in the keygen before you generate a serial."

,The_Roy,2012-01-14T12:24Z,"Hey man! 

The activations are working great however every time I open a package it says password is expired or no longer in use.

I then have to generate a new password each time.

Any ideas how to fix this problem?

Thanks again "
,jhboth,2012-01-16T01:37Z,worked like a charm.  had a serial number within 10 seconds of downloading this.
,westcoastartist,2012-01-22T05:57Z,I don't get why everyone is having a problem here. I had no problems with this and it works great.

Every time I try it says can't start my subscription and only option is to close. "

,aharman3,2012-03-10T04:11Z,"Having the same issue as others.  The generator and blocker seem to work on everything except Photoshop.  After generating a good solid license, it asks me to log in. Other programs are working though."
,weezer1987,2012-03-10T13:16Z,"Sorry to be a total n00b, but i've patched the host files, and when I paste in the serial number, i get the green tick, then it says below 'the software will automatically attempt to activate over the internet'. Is it OK to click continue if you have patched the host files? It doesn't work when I disconnect from the internet and try to click continue. Cheers."
,CopyrightTerrorist,2012-04-22T23:34Z,"Thank you, it works for me here on OS X Lion with Illustrator CS 5.1."
,bigwave69,2012-05-03T19:19Z,I am also getting serial numbers that keep activating the subscription edition of ps cs5 (a pay monthly option) And i cannot get past the adobe id requirement - Can someone confirm if it's just the serial number beginning with 1330 that triggers the subscription edition? I have tried patching the host file many times with no luck.
,gruntworker,2012-05-23T23:19Z,No help with InDesign CS5/Lion. Won't generate an acceptable SN.
,gruntworker,2012-05-24T12:35Z,To clarify my earlier comment - turns out I have Indesign 5.5. Doesn't work with that.
,srik369,2012-06-05T18:18Z,thanks its FUKIN HEKTIK !
