Thanks Raymondhome, I always rely on your releases"

,steviekeyz,2010-09-26T16:01Z,"I rarely get bad avi files but this one has been nuked. It does freeze 18 mins in due to a bad audio channel, VBR audio is garbage in this release.

Why do you think theres 10 different releases? Stay away from this one, the quality isn't as great as the other rips here. just saying.. and no i'm not complaining just stating the facts, bad avi file."

,mecca999,2010-09-27T00:46Z,"quality 9/10 and the movie works flawlessly,good shit "
,ockraz,2010-09-27T15:15Z,"This file works perfectly for me.  I'd ignore steviekeyz.  The sample is representative of the whole film, so DL it and you can base your judgment on that."
