,GSBuser,2011-02-16T22:52Z,It isn't pre-cracked. Its the demo version and it doesn't see .mkv files. It asks me if I want to convert .mkv files to .mp4??

You must be doing something wrong. Yes, this torrent is precracked and works just fine. I've been running it on my Mac since I've uploaded this torrent and I've had no problems yet. "
,silvertoes,2011-07-03T15:16Z,working great so far! thanks! can you update it?
