,gabriel1475,2010-10-25T12:52Z,"There doesnt seem to be a single goddamned fucking copy of this film with proper English subtitles through the whole film. The only ones I have been able to find (I tried a half dozen), only work at the beginning of the film. Fucking nubs!"
,jd_123,2010-11-10T19:40Z,"As I saw this movie on dvd first, I have to tell you there are intentionally NO subtitles for the japanese guy. Just the way this movie was made. "
,miknos,2010-11-12T04:30Z,"Great, watching the screenshots you can see the doctor with a bullet in his head. Now I know he dies."
,badass15,2010-11-12T20:29Z,"yea. and thanks to your smartass comment, now everyone knows. "

,redrum671,2011-03-31T07:26Z,"DO NOT LOOK AT THE SCREEN CAPS...even though this is a horror, the pictures kind of gives away the story part of it."
,TenRapesASecond,2011-04-05T21:20Z,Doctor will die :(.
,masterofdisasta,2011-04-12T00:35Z,"very good copy, thanks for sharing

the film sucks

there is no subs this is done purposely

we can all imagine what the chinese guy says! "" damn i need a shit, oh shit here it comes here it comeeeeeeeeees""

peace"
,TacoForce,2011-04-29T11:33Z,"Hey guys, couldn't help but notice some of you being upset by a few ""spoilers"" in the screens and comments. So I felt I should remind you of something..

This is, at best, a sub-par fecal fetish shock-horror tribute to all the terrible, terrible plot lines horror movies have given us.

If you read the part of the summary that goes, ""stitching their mouths to each others' rectums"" and are watching this film for the.. ""plot"", you should probably just go download The King's Speech or some other boring crap.

This movie is stupid, gory, and has gratuitous titty bouncing; features three tourists who's torture is to eat each others shit; oh, and the dude dies at the end.

If you still give a damn about anything but seeing what a Shit-tipede looks like, this movie isn't for you."
,hagglefaen,2011-05-13T17:18Z,Someone should seriously seed this awesome torrent...
,zaroba,2011-05-16T09:52Z,"lol people, crying over a few spoilers.

unless you've barely watched any movies in your life time you should already be able to figure out what happens in most movies just from watching the first half hour of them.  as most movies end the same way, with the good guy(s) wining and the bad guy(s) losing."
,cheekychick79,2011-05-17T15:31Z,i have downloaded this torrent and the video is fine but has no sound at all! this is the third time i have downloaded this film from 3 different sites and same problem keeps occurring...does anyone know where i can get this film free with sound? be grateful if anyone can help 
,Diskpart,2011-05-19T09:21Z,Lol dont all the bad guys die at the end of the movie?
,kingjazz,2011-05-25T17:28Z,"@Cheekychick79

You probably need some new codecs ;) picture with no sound usually means your codecs are outdated :)"
,stacycatmom,2011-05-30T03:36Z,wow this movie is wrong on so many levels.....LOVE IT :)
,Daky101,2011-06-13T16:31Z,"Thx,uploader!"

,longjohnshane,2011-09-11T05:23Z,the tosh.0 30 min spoiler on youtube made me come here to watch this movie.
,BritishHobo,2011-09-24T01:19Z,"That's bull about there intentionally being no subtitles for the Japanese guy, btw. Actually some of the best lines come from him, especially when he's struggling. I guess without the subtitles it seems less obvious it's a crazily dark comedy."
,Lilyen,2011-10-09T02:32Z,"This isn't a scary film, but to describe the film better - its sick. Not the ""good"" sick that Americans use... this is a film that will set your body in motion for being sick.

When you put your mind into whats going on, unless you're a real freak yourself.. then thats the only option you come to. So you have to stop picturing whats happening on this one and remove any empathy you may have.

In the end there's not a great plot, or message. Its just like someone telling you what happens in 2 girls and a cup for an hour and a half.

I got the subs from 1:07, but before that watching the film without subtitles seemed right. If you didn't have them after that point then it'd be weird.

Whilst different... its still no better than 6/10.

For the sound - try downloading VLC player or downloading the kazaa lite codec pack."
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-10-23T22:55Z,.BONE. is there anyway you can get hold of the Human Centipede 2? I'm in the UK and really want to see it. They are only releasing an uncut version on the 4th Nov. I would be eternally grateful if you could upload a torrent for it pleeezzzeee.
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-10-24T00:12Z,"You need the subs. The Japanese guy does say some very relevant things, particularly before he kills himself. I downloaded the dvdrip version, they have them automatically on it...."
,yelloo,2011-11-07T09:48Z,Thanks .BONE..
,chernye,2012-01-09T06:26Z,is this the unrated cut? thanks
,k.rull,2012-01-19T00:27Z,"Quality is pretty bad, it's barley good enough. But seems all torrents got shit quality. No way BR quality. I am overall disapointed with the torrent, but thanks for the upload"

,infexis1,2012-01-30T21:37Z,"This movie should be deleted from internet, burned to ashes from the video stores and the creator should die! I have never seen anything more discusting in my entire life!! OMFG how can anyone make something like this, rather give the money to chahttp://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5852511/The.Human.Centipede.2009.BRRip.XviD.Feel-Free#rity than create a movie like this. OMG please make me forget i ever saw this movie pleeeeasseeee... :("
,SystemFolder,2012-04-04T00:46Z,"@ infexis1 Make sure to watch The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence I have heard that it's even better than the first. Get the uncut version though, because it's the one with the barbed wire rape scene."
