It amazing how existence works.
All of a sudden, out of the blue, the exact material needed just appeared out of nowhere.

This one is exactly to summarize what has been said up to now. Exactly point by point.

This one is probably what many have been waiting for to put an accent on things. Highly recommended.

Discourse 2 deals with meditation mechanics.
Discourse 4 deals with issues of creativity.
Discourse 7 deals with meditation as related to the joyous state, the birds singing in the morning. It also deals with issues of zombification of children.
Discourse 9 deals with laughter.

What a treat!

These originals were in a pretty bad shape, almost as bad as it gets.
Discourse 10, at least first 6-9 minutes is almost inaudible, even after extensive amount of work on it. But, after that, it is quite audible.

Enjoy.
