Film which blends archive footage, artefacts, news archive and rare performance 
footage to tell Jimi Hendrix's life story, from childhood in Seattle to death in London.

40 years after Jimi Hendrix's death on September 18th 1970, this film tells Jimi Hendrix's
life story in his own words and is narrated by funk legend Bootsy Collins in the soft,
authoritative voice of Hendrix himself.

Blending archive footage, artefacts, news archive and rare performance footage, director
Bob Smeaton's film takes us from Hendrix's childhood in Seattle, through his spell in the
army and on to his time on the chitlin circuit backing the likes of the Isley Brothers and
Little Richard, his 'discovery' by ex-Animal Chas Chandler in New York, the formation of
the Experience in the UK and his launch and instant popstardom in London in 1966, his
stellar festival appearances at Monterey and Woodstock, his artistic progression, his last
British concert at the end of August 1970 at the Isle of Wight Festival and his tragic death
in Notting Hill..
