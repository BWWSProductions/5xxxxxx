I've posted the entire week.  In the future,  sign up to the WDM Network to get the show at 11:30AM EST with direct downloading and streaming.

Also all the Howard TV and H101 you can dream of.

,chowhall,2010-09-30T22:22Z,I tried to sign up on wushdishmeen and they banned me for using a proxy server.  I didn't mean to break the rules.  I don't even know what a proxy server is!
[V],wushdishmeen,2010-10-01T02:19Z,"Actually,  the accounts that are automatically removed for inactivity are the people who didn't post in the Welcome Thread within 90 days.

You are given 3 months to simply introduce yourself in a thread to make sure you're an actual fan and that's it.

It's hardly a favor to ask in return for the over 3000+ files we offer completely free.

You can always register again if you are removed for inactivity.  Just remember to follow the rules next time and you'll be fine."
