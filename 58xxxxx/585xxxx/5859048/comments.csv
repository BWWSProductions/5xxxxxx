[V],Shroo,2010-10-01T00:11Z,"Njoy, The game!

Btw there will be no FIFA, Pes is way better...."
,VeteranD13,2010-10-01T00:21Z,"How dare lol, you anyway whats the difference between fifa  and pes "
,VeteranD13,2010-10-01T00:22Z,O yea also is this 2011 I know it says 2011 but the picture says 2010?
[V],Mbb15,2010-10-01T00:29Z,"@Shroo 

you like non-realistic pingpong football more? :)

FIFA is much better but I enjoy both games (btw torrent picture fail)

but here's my question,

Is the language (menu and commentary) english?
"
,Pylyp,2010-10-01T00:30Z,"So this is 2011 or 2012? 

Screenshot left me confused"
,Pylyp,2010-10-01T00:31Z,"oops i meant in my previous comment 2010 ofc, not 2012)"
,given2flye,2010-10-01T00:32Z,"Pes maybe was better for pc, i heard they are going to give same gameplay of the ps3 to pc this year. But fifa + ps3 = unique. thats why im downloading pes and buying fifa. Good job on this though."
[V],Shroo,2010-10-01T00:50Z,forget the image... when this is done I might do fifa too...
,DragonF.C.Porto,2010-10-01T01:18Z,"Thanks, Obrigado..TPTB"
,VeteranD13,2010-10-01T01:32Z,Thanks shroo alltough I enjoy playing both pes and fifa thx again you're work is very much appreciated.
,AZkiller7,2010-10-01T01:34Z,"LOL at guys who think FIFA is better, i've been playing FIFA since 1996 and PES since 1998 (it was called ISS at that time) and i've to say when it comes to flexibility and quality gameplay, PES OWNZ. I only play FIFA from time to time when i feel the need to have a brief laugh at EA. Since when Americans know football (soccer) anyway !"
,Pimbax,2010-10-01T02:44Z,"Fifa is way better than this shit .

Im downloading just to see what konami did this year .

Cause, da demo sucked hard !

But whatever ."
,Cyrez60659,2010-10-01T02:51Z,No Dead Rising 2?
,D0gmeat,2010-10-01T03:12Z,"I prefer PES as it feels like football. FIFA I like solely for the eye candy, much more visually appealing.

Still thanks for the rip as it saves on DL time."

,crazyman1,2010-10-02T15:51Z,plsss rip FIFA 11 tooooo..........................
,darkdeath,2010-10-02T15:54Z,"hey shroo this is not a good rip unlike ur other rips but this is the first
Reasons-
1. first and most importantly commentary is crap, cursor will be on messi and it will say everton scores a goal LOL...
and even someone think that he should copy the commentary files from other version to make it work dnt try it , because here the commentary image file is different type means different from real game
2. secondly there is a crapy registry problem but tats not  a big issue just a simpe copying of install dir ....
3. the ingame videos such as bal videos uefa-cl video etc work but with pauses afiter every 3 sec and i hv tested it on gtx285.
so people its your choice."
,bd201020,2010-10-02T16:07Z,"Thanks Shroo, Would be perfect if it weren't for the Commentary being messed up. A fix would be great if possible??. The commentary really makes the game that much better.

 Forget Fifa11 I got both and Fifa11 really does suck compared to PES2011."
[V],Shroo,2010-10-02T16:15Z,"I am not a developer of a game, download pes patch that will fix some problems. I am not responsible for ingame bugs, mistakes, go and email KONAMI I am sure they will respond to you! "
[V],blaze69,2010-10-02T17:10Z,"Good answer Synergy... 
haha..

Hey hope u included the original .exe file in this so the game can be patched... I haven't finished Downloading yet. But Thanks very Much synergy..."
,bd201020,2010-10-02T17:18Z,"Hi Shroo. My understanding is that the commentary works ok in other versions. I realize the fix could be to just download the other versions available but thought pointing out the commentary issue might be something you had an interest in trying to do a quick fix for etc. Thanks again for your efforts, all your rips on a whole are awesome!

Hey guys I worked out how to fix the commentary problem. Go into the ""img"" folder and you will see a file named ""dt00_f"" (its 422mb). You need to change the ""f"" to an ""e"" and the commentary will be fixed. 



Simple fix :-)"
