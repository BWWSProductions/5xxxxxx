Good morning folks,

This is a ALAC (.M4A) best of the dirty projectors !
I did it myself, so, all these songs are the best together in MY opinion, to introduce you in dave longstreth's world.

The tracklist :

1 knotty pine
2 I will truck
3 stillness is the move
4 two sheep asleep
5 when the world comes to an end
6 useful chamber
7 ground underfoot
8 not having found
9 finche's song at oceanic parking lot
10 likeness of uncles
11 no embrace
12 all we are
13 how do my mind work
14 the bride
15 temecula sunrise
16 two brown finches
17 darkened car
18 two young sheeps


If you have one, tell me what would be your best of the dirty projectors !

If you like this music, buy the LP !



Have a nice day√¢
