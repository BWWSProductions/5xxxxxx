,kajeybby,2010-09-27T03:32Z,Can we have a quality check?
,llama2oo9,2010-09-27T03:37Z,No Problem Remember share and seed :) 
,llama2oo9,2010-09-27T03:38Z,Most Tracks are 128kbs and a few are 256kbs 
,kajeybby,2010-09-27T04:11Z,It'd probably be a good idea to wait for a better quality leak.
,darkpepito,2010-09-27T04:20Z,it's awesomeÂĄÂĄ
[T],zombifuzz,2010-09-28T23:36Z,im posting a VBR in about 10 minutes.  maybe some people should just let others handle this type of music.
,alejandrovasquez940,2010-09-29T00:44Z,"i know you got your pretty little skull zombi, but i think it is kinda stupid to knock someone for trying. at least he/she took the time to put it up here. I personally have been waiting for this, and while i realize that this particular leak isn't the best quality, it got up here first so i am thankful for it.

I am really not trying to be a dick and I am sorry if it came out that way, I appreciate everything that you have put up here and have downloaded a lot of your torrents"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-09-29T17:45Z,im not trying to be a dick either.  i was the only person who ever uploaded this type of music & now everyone is coming out of the woodwork with it.  im sorry but i have a strong fan base & i post nothing but the best thats why i wasnt first on this.  maybe next time ill rush to get crap out too.
,alejandrovasquez940,2010-09-30T01:09Z,"Crap or not I appreciate the effort it took and I wanted to hear the songs. 

I am really looking forward to your VBR though to be quite honest. I really like some of the songs and I wanna hear them in all their glory haha"
,llama2oo9,2010-10-01T15:35Z,im sorry if i have upset anyone by uploading this but its an album ive been searching for for weeks and i would like to share what i have with people i know the sound quallity isnt all that in which case go buy the CD on the dates of release depending where you live and support the artist i have already got mine pre ordered and support bands i download either by buying merch goingto shows or buying the CD on release
