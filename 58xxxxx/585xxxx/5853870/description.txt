Review	by Stephen Thomas Erlewine

Following the departure of Joe Walsh, drummer Jim Fox and bassist Dale Peters recruited guitarist Dominic Troiano and vocalist Roy Kenner and set about recording the James Gang's fourth studio album, Straight Shooter. Although Troiano was a competent player, he lacked Walsh's fiery passion and knack for crafting melodic solos. In addition to Troiano's workmanlike performances, the band was saddled by a noticeable lack of strong material, since none of the members could write songs with memorable hooks.
