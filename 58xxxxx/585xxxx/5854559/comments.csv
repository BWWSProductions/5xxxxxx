,Shihaby,2010-09-27T13:49Z,"Gangstabub is right, ""I'm Single"" isn't the album version, it doesn't feature Drake.

And ""YM Banger"" is just a chopped & screwed version of ""I Am Not A Human Being"", it's not the actual song.

Other than that, great download! All the other tracks are perfect quality!"

[V],nos1977,2010-10-13T21:39Z,yes it is...
,thmz,2010-11-01T20:23Z,"Not to be a ""hater"" or anything but this has got to be the worst album Lil Wayne has ever done. The rhymes, the rhyming is nothing compared to Drake's. It's stupid for him to feature Drake in his song because Drake outraps him in every song.

""I am not a human, shout out to all my moonmen"" what does that even mean?!"
,77bigmac77,2010-12-17T03:43Z,"^^^^^^^

fuck drake that dude dangles from waynes nuts

and this ""album"" was trash, just all filler songs that didn't make carter IV so they tried to make some money off them"
,skate3dgetto,2011-01-28T09:54Z,lil wayne is getting so lazy with his music ugh
,jokha,2011-01-28T17:57Z,"there's a weird sentence in the description...
""if you don't like it... don't download it..."""
,RockinLikeAMutha,2012-06-12T10:12Z,Track 13?
