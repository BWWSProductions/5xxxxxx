NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..... The Town

Right well here we are with a nice cam for everyone to enjoy... 
Video on this was pretty good other than the odd auto focus issues. First was the colors, we 
messed about with the rgb colors and also brightened it up a bit, along with lowering the 
chroma and that dulled the real bright spots. The audio was ac3 from the source files so 
we opted to leave that because it sounds fairly good for cam audio.
You can hear the odd laughing and such, but not bad at all. Sample was made so you 
could hear the laughter at one certain spot...
