For those that know, .mkv files are primarily containers in which multiple subtitles and audio tracks can be placed. I have never seen a .mkv file that only contains the video and numerous subtitle tracks. If that were the case, the uploader should have simply encoded this as a .mp4 or an .avi and included separate audio and subtitles.

Even though I used mkvmerged to combine the English.ac3 file with the video, I do not believe this is the best way to mux a .mkv file."
