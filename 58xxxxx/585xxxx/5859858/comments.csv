,bulldoglvr,2010-10-02T01:56Z,"Segel, any chance you would be interested in splitting ""dusk til doorn""? I know you're busy with other sets though so no pressure."
,TranceStation,2010-10-02T06:25Z,"When I click on that link, it says nothing is found.  I don't know if it's just me having this problem or if anyone else is? I even posted on that torrent earlier today. "
