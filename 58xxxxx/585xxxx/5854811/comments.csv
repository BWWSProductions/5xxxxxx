,saxony2k,2010-09-29T00:43Z,"@afroebob Ah, close close close...  Ok, nowhere near close! =)  Loved the episode, but it's actually based on an Agatha Christie, Ten Little N-words, later Ten Little Indians, finally And Then There Were  None.

Who'd have figured an Agatha Christie buff for a Family Guy fan?!"
