IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:TAKERS.2010. VOBS .....Thanks to a good friend
AUDIO:TAKERS.2010. VOBS .....Thanks to a good friend

Here we go we i think our 3rd cam of this all different sources though
Anyway for this we made a small script containing crop, resize, sharpness, noise reduction, chroma, brightness contrast, rgb eq. We lowered the colours as they were quiet strong and made it a touch brighter as it was dark... some slight noise to the video which we removed aswell.
The audio... we decided to leave it how it was on the vobs with a AC3 audio track...

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
