Run wat remover , if it propose you only to uninstal then DO SO ; after run Loader , if you can t start instal cuz no option on screen it means that it has detected previous versions of loader/wat remover or chew so if the option uninstal  is highlighted then DO SO after :

after reboot each time of course RUN CHEW then you select - or not - your mobo and system brand then RUN CHEW then reboot then all ok .
