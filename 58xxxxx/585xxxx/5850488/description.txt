Ray Tango and Gabriel Cash are narcotics detectives who, while both being
extremely successful, can't stand each other. Crime Lord Yves Perret, furious
at the loss of income that Tango and Cash have caused him, frames the two for
murder. Caught with the murder weapon on the scene of the crime, the two have
alibi. Thrown into prison with most of the criminals they helped convict, it
appears that they are going to have to trust each other if they are to clear
their names and catch the evil Perret.
