,Jlas2h,2010-09-30T21:27Z,IDK What It Exactly Is But It Looks Just Like A Dvd
,MoneyLoo,2010-10-04T02:44Z,"Don't believe a word Jlash2h says, this is not even close to DVD quality, it looks like the same blurry VHS release with a watermark that came out earlier. And yes I know that when you start the movie it says that it is a dvd in the watermark warning, however the quality is much worse, it's comparable to a very bad VHS. Don't waste your time on this one."

,MoneyLoo,2010-10-15T03:36Z,"Sorry I'm not trying to come off as unappreciative of the up, I appreciate the effort and the risk of upping this. All I'm unappreciative of is the fact you said it looks like a DVD, when clearly it does not. I wasted my time getting this and got my wifes' hopes up to watch it when the kids went to bed, but we were both too disgusted by the blurry VHS quality to view it. Again, thanks for the effort, but try to be more clear about your release next time to avoid upsetting people that actually see it for what it is."
,Jlas2h,2010-10-16T02:51Z,Well To Me It Looks Like DVD
,ernie_ran,2010-10-21T19:01Z,do you have eyes?
,Jlas2h,2010-10-28T17:07Z,"Do You Have A Brain. STFU.  @ernie_ran Watch The Movie Or Not, Honestly I Dont Care If You Do Or Don't. Just Don't Go Trolling My Page Cause You Have No Life"
