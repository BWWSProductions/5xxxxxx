Recorded with the best microphones there are, such as Microtec Geffel UM-70 and AKG-460 directly to digital recorder.

The main track and track 2 are recorded in stereo.
Tracks 3_L, 3_R, 4_L and 4_R are in mono.
Tracks 4 are mostly ambient sounds of early morning on Chiquita avenue and Mercy street intersection from the window of apartment.

No processing or editing of any kind was done."
,veerenski,2010-09-26T06:12Z,"Now, the background ""noise"" you are hearing is the world. This is not a theory or some fancy ""mystical"" thing. No. It IS the reality of your world.

If you would rather hear this bird in utterly pristine, utterly quiet environment, it would not be a reality. It would be just another plastic thing, just like about anything that surrounds you.

On the main piece. The recording started before dawn, just when the sky was begging to get first glimpses of light. At that time, all is asleep and this bird just starts its song. All other birds are still asleep.

As dawn progresses, the background becomes more and more pronounced and eventually you can hardly hear the master bird.

And so is your life.

My suggestion is: whenever you are in a difficulty or confusion, listen to this song, the song of life."
,veerenski,2010-09-27T23:11Z,"What do you mean, my humble friends?
You mean THIS torrent is not deserving to be seeded?

Why all of you have gone away after downloading it? What seems to be a problem?
Are you ashamed of yourselves?

Or you want some words telling you how screwed up you are?

You want WHAT? A THEORY of ""enlightenment""?
Some recipe  on how to become better than what you are?

What do you really want here, messing around with Osho?"

""Osho - A Sudden Clash Of Thunder - Remastered""

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5856143/Osho_-_A_Sudden_Clash_Of_Thunder_-_Remastered

Discourse 7 deals with this.

Basically, Osho says: if you live your life in total joy and happiness, just like birds, except they are unconscious, then you do not need meditation and you don't need enlightenment.
Those things are needed for the sick people, that forever whine about this and that ""problem"" and forever seek, thinking they are missing something.

So, this torrent ""The Essence Of Enlightenment"" offers you no path. There is no need for any ""path"", any ""way"", any process, any improvement or that ""enlightenment"" myth.

But yes, ALL of you want some ""path"" to travel. Because you were zombified from cradle about all your ""imperfections"". You were told the way you are you are no good. You need all sorts of ""improvements"". You were made to think there is something ""wrong"" with you. You parents banged it into your head since you were born, and so did your teachers and all sorts of ""authorities"".

You were never told the biggest secret there is:
There is NOTHING ""wrong"" with you, just the way you are, even if you yourself think that you are ""wrong"" all the time.

It is just a matter of immediate switch in your consciousness. There is no need to ""transcend"" the mind. First of all, it can not be done. Secondly, without it, you are dead, or some bum, a beggar, sucking on the results of someone else's work, not trusting himself to be of any worth.

So fine, you do not think there is such a thing as ""no path"", then travel, travel ALL you want. The path is going to be hard and tedious. If you are lucky, you will see some results in about 20 years, and that is if you are lucky."
,veerenski,2010-10-01T07:22Z,"And, at the end of your long, long path you had to travel, you will come to the same state as pointed out by this torrent. INEVITABLY.

Sooner of later, you are BOUND to realize what a fool you were, spending all these years to find something you forever had, and that is innocence, sincerity and a giggle of a child, pure and uncorrupted by all the knowledge.

That is why Jesus, and not only Jesus, said:
Be like a child.

When you were born, you were utterly pure, utterly innocent and in utter joy. Every moment of your babyhood you were giggling and smiling in wander and utter ecstasy.

But then you got corrupted and so the need arose in you to get uncorrupted again, to return to that virgin spring that knows no pollution yet."
,veerenski,2010-10-03T03:38Z,"And never believe those who sell you this ""enlightenment"" thing or meditation this or meditation that.

They do not have it. That is why they are selling it.
If they had it, they'd simply give it, not sell it.
What you have you simply give.

Do you sell love?
Do you sell joy?
Do you sell laughter?
Do you sell ANYTHING authentic and sincere?

If you do, you do not have it. It is just a bluff.

Nirvana is death.
Moksha is death.
Samadhi is death.

THAT is what they are selling you.
Remember this REALLY well. You will see one day."
,veerenski,2010-10-09T00:47Z,"So, you want to know the essence of enlightenment?

Why don't you review this before you waste the rest of your life chasing it?
