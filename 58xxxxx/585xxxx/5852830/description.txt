Osho Musicians, Veeren - The Essence Of Enlightenment

This is raw master tapes of The Bird of Enlightenment.

What else can be said about it besides it is a total orgasm with existence, total spontaneity, total trust and total surrender to existence itself.

Now, this is a Caruso bird, the master singer of all birds.

It sits on electric pole and jumps several feet high in total ecstasy, being carried like a feather by its powerful wings.

This bird wakes the whole world up in the morning.
She wakes up first among other birds.
And she starts waking the whole world up.

Can you be like that?
What seems to be the problem, really?
