,rjaime,2010-09-27T20:43Z,what is the use of uploading a torrent if you wont stay around and wait for at least one person to make a full download? wtf!
[T],tzanev,2010-09-27T22:41Z,"LOL... rjaime, don't shout at eztv. That's like taking the Lord's name in vain. BTW, there is clearly a problem with the seeders/leechers numbers today."
,PheePhan,2010-09-28T03:54Z,"It still says no seeders and no leechers but I am downloading at 13 K, should have it in 8 hours."
,PheePhan,2010-09-28T04:16Z,...and now I'm up to 115 K and should be downloaded in 45 minutes. Nothing wrong with this torrent. The See and Lee numbers must be broken.
