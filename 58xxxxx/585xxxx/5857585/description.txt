IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:TAKERS.2010. Anton Studios .....Thanks
AUDIO:TAKERS.2010. Anton Studios .....Thanks

Ok heres another cam of this by us,but this time we've used the Anton studio release.
The source has a "A" watermark hardcoded in the top left and also as some spanish hardcoded subs. The picture also seems to be cropped and as some camera movement. Work done... well we've cleaned it up the best we could and also cropped most of the black borders, but due to the camera movement you still get it in some parts ... The audio we left untouched and isn't too bad for cam audio.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
