This film happens to have been shot in a 1.85:1 (16:9) ratio (same as your widescreen TV) - so it comes out as 1920x1080 on DVD. However, many ""widescreen"" movies are filmed in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, so the DVD dimensions come out to 1920x817. If you wanted a ""widescreen"" movie to be 1920x1080, then it's sides would have to be chopped off to get that height. But you dont' want to lose some of the movie, so it fills the 1920 pixel width of your TV and has black bars above and below. Anything less and you're losing part of the film."
