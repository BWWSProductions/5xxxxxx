Herod The Great

He carved a bloody path to power, built
an army of 40,000 men that instilled
terror into the hearts of both his enemies
and those he ruled, and he even
murdered his own wives and children.
Can anything about this ruthless tyrant
make him worthy of the title, Herod the
Great?

the truth about one of the Bible's most
legendary villains.
