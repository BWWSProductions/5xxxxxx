Game Description:
Spaceward Ho! is a strategic game of awesome scope. You control the entire military and economy of a spacefaring race. Your goal: explore and colonize the galaxy.

Unfortunately, you are not alone. Alien enemies bent on galactic conquest will oppose your expansion. You fight them by developing new technologies and expanding your empire, or you can ally with them to turn enemies into friends.

Terraform newly discovered worlds or mine their natural resources. Maneuver your starship fleets, both in defense of your own systems and in offensive strikes against the evil aliens. Your strategic decisions will determine the fate of the galaxy.

It's incredibly fun to play alone against the excellent computer players, and even better with other humans on the internet.

Spaceward Ho! has won numerous awards over the years, including being inducted into the MacWorld Game Hall of Fame and winning Best Network Game of the year.

The new version 5 (Mac only.. email the developer and bug him for a PC remake!) is better than ever, with free internet play on spacewardho.net, combined fleets, new battle options, an all-new user interface, and much more.
