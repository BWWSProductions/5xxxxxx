Jimi Hendrix - No More A Rolling Stone 
 
Jimi Hendrix Experience

Very rare release by Purple Haze of the Monterey'67 and 
Stockholm '67 recordings.

Jimi Plays Monterey is a posthumous live album by Jimi Hendrix 
released in February 1986. 

The album documents The Jimi Hendrix Experiences performance at 
the Monterey Pop Festival on June 18, 1967. 
As well as songs from the band's debut album Are You Experienced, 
Monterey also includes covers of "Killing Floor" (Howlin' Wolf), 
"Like a Rolling Stone" (Bob Dylan), "Rock Me Baby" (B. B. King) 
and "Wild Thing" (Chip Taylor). 

The version of "Wild Thing" on the album is one of the most notable 
live performances ever, as, in an iconic moment in rock history, 
he sets his guitar alight after the song and then smashes it.

Jimi Plays Monterey is also a short film directed by D. A. Pennebaker 
documenting the same performance as the album, also released in 1986. 
It is notable for containing several interviews with rock stars, and 
containing an art piece by Denny Dent during the performance of 
"Can You See Me".
