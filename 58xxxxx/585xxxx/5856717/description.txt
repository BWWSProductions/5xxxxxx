"To Keep Us Safe"

As the shockwave of the plane dissipates, 
President Martinez's (Blair Underwood) 
staff must work quickly to assess what 
happened and how to respond. Director of 
National Intelligence, Blake Sterling, 
(eljko Ivanek) locks down Sophia (Laura 
Innes) for interrogation. The conspiracy 
widens, engulfing FBI Agent Collier 
(guest star Heather McComb) and Carter 
(guest star D. B. Sweeney), a mercenary 
with questionable ties. Meanwhile, a 
shadowy figure, Thomas (Clifton Collins, 
Jr.), emerges with knowledge of the 
detainees and their plan.

Enjoy :)
