Hello Everyone,

I had trouble getting correct subtitles for this movie, so I made and corrected them myself. They are accurate as I could get them, going second by second through the film. Please Enjoy and thank raymondhome for releasing the movie for all of us to enjoy. 

* Please remember these subtitles will only be accurate for this version of the film 

and the timing will be off if you attempt to use them with a camera or TS version.



* To use with VLC, just choose open file in the file menu and choose to open the 

.AVI and the .SRT files in the two choice boxes. Remember to check the \"Use a 

subtitles file\" box or else it will not let you open the file. Then just press ok 

and you will be good to watch the film.
