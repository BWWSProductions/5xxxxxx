,syl3r,2010-10-04T00:23Z,"dude what the hell i cant burn it and it wont play on anything but my pc i cant even stream it to my tv you suck ass. other than that the a-10 and v-10

but just know it wont burn or stream cause the video is not in a normal format"
,wira020,2010-10-05T22:00Z,"""i cant even stream it to my tv you suck ass""

LOL.. I'm sorry but I cant help but laugh at that guy's comment... if you're smart enough to use torrent you should be smart enough to find guides on converting video file into standalone dvd or bluray or whatever it is people use to play movies on tv nowadays.. and a little thank you wont hurt..

@pewee
If using media player homecinema (MPC).. just right click on the video while it's playing and find ""Subtitle"".. the options available should be clear from there.. I dont know about VLC tho.. cause it suxs!"
,Blarg4,2010-10-09T17:42Z,is there anyway to get rid of the subtitles?
,thrillerrock,2010-10-25T15:53Z,"@Blarg4 
you just download gomplayer and just press alt+h to get rid of the subtitles"
,Raave,2010-11-08T15:49Z,"This is truly awesome! 
For only 548Mb sized file you get 1280x544 resolution!! Its amazing. Check the screen-shots if you don't believe me.
This is the best torrent of all the torrents out there!!!"
,schizo440,2010-12-20T16:50Z,"YiFY.. Thumbs up man.. Huge fan... Small quality, plays nice on even 42 inch HDTV.

What program do you use to encode MKV anyway?

cheers"
