,pillsbury3x,2011-03-25T12:44Z,"this torrent wasnt bad, but i noticed the audio wasnt very consistent. on come what(ever) may, it wasnt great, but on the self titled, Inhale in particular it was incredible. overall it is pretty good, just wish some had better quality"
,maddog7dust,2011-05-09T03:08Z,it kinda sucks... ive found better quality on youtube... thats sad
