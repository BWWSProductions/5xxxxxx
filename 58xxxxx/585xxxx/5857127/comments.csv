,Greenspoon,2010-11-14T23:04Z,"nice this is moving again, keep seeding guys, I'm gonna seed this for ages.  I have all these DVDs, and wanted to get them on my external so I considered ripping them high quality myself.  this is going to save me ages, thanks a lot for taking the effort.  Much Appreciated!  i'm 28 and this shit IS my childhood.  Bruce Timm + Mark Hammel + Kevin Conroy for the win."

,Onizuka3,2011-01-21T02:41Z,I hate the people who left the rude comments here. Reading their comments has left me ill. I want to say thank you for this torrent & the quality that went into it. Thank you :^J
,Onizuka3,2011-01-21T02:44Z,This torrent was removed. Rofl. Serves you a-holes right _.l.. Half of you wouldn't have seeded it to a 1.500 ratio anyway :^D

,MaximilianK1,2011-01-26T05:35Z,please fix the link and seed. thank you :)
,thegr8luiz,2011-03-03T11:50Z,BIG deal! A high-quality torrent that's not available for download. What's the use?
,TorrentsTPB,2011-05-30T19:52Z,"great job losangelesking!

you talk the talk and walk the walk!

for all you morons who say the link is not wkg, it is not losangeleskings issue it is with pbay.  if they decided to remove the file they would have deaded the whole page.  If you want it, just use the magnet link it works fine with many seeders.  Im probably wasting my time writing this however, because most trolls cant read they can only talk ish"
,ScareZone,2011-10-23T12:49Z,"Dude, You're awesome!"
