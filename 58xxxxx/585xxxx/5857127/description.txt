The Complete - 1990's - Batman The Animated Series. 
I ripped these myself because i could not find decent quality rips out there. 
I used Handbreak to encode these at: 460 MB an episode, also keeping its NATIVE DVD resolution as well as FLAC audio. 
I did a split screen to compare my MKV vs the DVD's, and i could not tell the difference in quality. (I chose not to convert in AVI as it is obsolete and has not been maintained since 2005)
I kept the EPIC intro's for ALL episodes, unlike some uploaders who took them out (one of the best parts of the show IMO). 


I ALSO INCLUDED ALL BONUS FEATURES FROM ALL DISC - IN ORDER. 
(As for the episodes with commentaries, they are dual audio which means 
you can switch between original/commentary audio track. 
Use VLC player)


English only. 
No other languanges / No subs AT ALL included.

Format: .MKV 
Language: English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround) 
Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1 



*NOTE - Please do not say that the episode's are out of order. 
They are in the order of the DVD's. 
If you want them in the order by air-date, then by all means go ahead and change them. 
But do not confuse people with your comments.

Now you can truly enjoy the ART and how it was meant to be seen, in high quality.

I ALSO HAVE THE FULL DVD9 VERSION COMPLETE - ALL 16 DVD'S IF YOU PREFER THAT ONE INSTEAD

PLEASE SEED
ENJOY!
