,Aprelka,2010-09-26T18:57Z,"I hope this one will work, previous two torrents were not correctly created, sorry.
Try not to delete old downloaded 88%... try to add in order to complete
there were a problem in ""Tokyo Mater"" file, all other files are the same, so you can just start this torrent"
,Aprelka,2010-09-26T19:06Z,"it seems to be a problem with TPB, because I can't edit the torrent, it bring me to a page, that says ""ERROR""
even writing the comments sort of a problem..."
,.ANCIENT.,2010-09-27T06:25Z,"Thanks for the info on the fix. I Deleted task only then re-downloaded torrent file from TPB, after which I chose same save path for movie files and was prompted to hash-check. Started again at 88.8% then quickly finished in only a few minutes. I wish there was some way to inform all the others stuck at 88.8% to do this without them checking the comments. I am happy that I did though. Thanks again for your top notch uploads."
