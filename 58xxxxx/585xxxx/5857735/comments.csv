,saskimodo,2010-10-02T12:11Z,thanks for the gear-u r a *
,rdmonty,2010-11-26T00:38Z,I think your torrents are the best on the net and I thank you. However when I download this particular one it will not open. Do I need to do anything besides click on the application?
,Shrededbeef,2010-12-09T05:37Z,What if I can't find  LIBRARY and STYLES folder? Seems that yhey don't exist in the destination folders! Please help!!
,klabru,2011-01-04T00:21Z,"First: Thank u thank u thank u. Adobe should pay you for spreading there program and enabling people to work with it.
Second: I have the same problem as BEEF, do not know where exactly to install the thing or where to make what folder. "
,DragonRider65,2011-01-05T19:46Z,"Hey guys, I am surprised the uploader (who does actually totally rock!) did not finish with instructions on how to install this material? What you need to do is click on the application and extract the contents to wherever you want to put them; I created a folder called ""library"" right in the program files folder of Adobe Encore CS5 it is in the 32 bit (x86) program files folder if you are running 64 bit? Then copy the content of the Adobe Encore CS5 Library Content folder into the new folder you just created. When you open Encore it will recognize the content and you will have the content available. I know it works because I have already done it with both the styles and the library material. Thanks for the upload, ""thethingy"", you are awesome, and I would bet that I have downloaded more of your torrents than anyone else's on any other torrent site! (And I am a Moderator at one of these even!)"
,SnapplerX,2011-02-02T05:16Z,Works Great! Thank you so much. You're torrents are amazing as always! :) Anyone who contributed to the -3 is a total idiot. You're awesome. Keep up the good work.
,vdavis,2011-03-01T19:27Z,"I am on a Mac and I put the contents of ""Adobe CS5 Encore Library"" in:

i am at a loss as to where to put the contents of ""Adobe CS5 Encore Styles""

any suggestions?"
,tabbouleh,2011-06-10T10:14Z,shokran!
,repeat123,2011-08-08T22:17Z,"How to install:

You just have to make those 2 folders yourself, if they are not displayed in: 'Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Encore CS5.1'. Just make 2 new folders called 'Library' and 'Styles' and copy the content from thethingy into those folders. Just start Encore and the new content will be working!

Thank you thethingy"
