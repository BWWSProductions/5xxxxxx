,Zendra,2011-05-15T06:19Z,"How come GoW1 is 16.11 GiB in size, and GoW2 twice as small, only 8.59 GiB? As i remember, on ps2 the second gow was larger then the first. And you say it works on internal and external, how can it be, if PS3 only reads FAT32? Can you please tell us how to tranfer the game on internal hard, but not with ftp, if there is a way with external hard, thanks"
