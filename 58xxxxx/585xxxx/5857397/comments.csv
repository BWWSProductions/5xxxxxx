,Sattori,2010-10-01T19:18Z,Thank you. Very good show. Good picture quality also. But  they should have omitted these boring flashbacks of Johansen in this episode. 
,bagdouche1225,2010-10-03T23:28Z,thanks
,Adeptguy,2010-10-04T21:16Z,"Great torrent! 20 min for me :D

,smatas,2010-10-06T05:39Z,Wow! 3660 seeds!! Done in 15 min. Ty SW :)
,CaptainBeefheart314,2010-10-06T07:45Z,"3825 seeders by now. I'm guessing TPB didn't have time to add a seedcount, or somehow they're not following the numbers yet? Pretty understandeable, seeing as it's brand spanking new... I'm anxious to see how the cliffhanger of season 1 turns out :-) Love this show, by the way! So much more real-life than Atlantis (which, incidentally, also rocks!)"
,Mastertape,2010-10-10T23:52Z,this show sucks so hard... wish it was a woman... stargate shouldn't go battlestar...
,koka3,2010-10-12T14:10Z,Thanks
,pimpmobile,2010-10-15T11:05Z,"they destroyed the stargate series with this universe crap bad acting, horrible special effects( compared to sg1 and atlantis), and lets not forget bad writing this is a drama/soap-opera there is no action its all about relationships, chick stuff!  Not to mention they are throwing christianity into the show after the series has talk mainly about enlightenment and reincarnation.  I understand they wanted to go in a new direction, but they are going in all different directions and its sucks! "
,laitblade,2010-10-16T11:11Z,@pimpmobile ure crap! stargate univers pwns
