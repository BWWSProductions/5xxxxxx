Plot:
Yaibua. The main character in Takien: The Haunted Tree

(Nang Takien) is a charming enough girl, but she has a 

pain in her neck.

That's because she hanged herself. First her city-slicker 

boyfriend showed their sex clip to his no-good co-worker 

friends. So she broke up with him. Then she lost her 

factory job in Bangkok. She goes back to her rural village 

to find that her entire family has died tragically. So she 

threw a rope up in a takien tree and stuck her head in the 

noose.

Because her death was unnatural, according to 

superstition, she is buried for a time until her spirit 

settles down and a Brahmin priest determines it's okay to 

cremate the body.

She doesn't settle down though, and goes about haunting 

the village and taking revenge on the ex-boyfriend and the 

local young gangsters who wronged her family.
