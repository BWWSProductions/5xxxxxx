,SneeKee,2010-09-30T18:59Z,How is there not a single seeder? .... must really suck if the original uploader didnt stick around to seed
,Agent.25i,2010-09-30T19:30Z,"I dunno... I think somethings up with the site... No seeders or leechers for any file uploaded in the last 5 days, and the top 100 tv shows haven't changed up either in the last 5 days."
,cmason19,2010-10-01T00:51Z,downloading now Lots of seeds and Peers.
,echoessilent,2010-10-01T02:50Z,"there are 1000's of seeds, so d/l away. PB, for some reason or another, hasn't published them for a few days now."
,xCptMorganx,2010-10-02T07:06Z,"As of this writing, 3500+ seeders.  Mine downloaded in under five minutes. 

Cheers"
