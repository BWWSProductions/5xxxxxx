,executionist,2011-04-08T22:10Z,thanks man
,namshub,2011-09-24T20:38Z,@john6425 Anyone who considers Noah's Ark to be a historical event is already a joke. They don't need any help from us to be funny.
,namshub,2011-09-24T20:41Z,"@john6425 You are spot on about NGC, Science & Discovery though. They're been outputting a whole bunch of crap for a while now. Truckers, idiots in junkyards, mechanics. It's a giant race to the bottom. TV producers love reality shows, they're cheap as shit to make because they don't have any actual content. They just find a group of bombastic dipshits and roll tape.

The BBC, however, has a load of good programming. And if you look at the credits of the decent shows on those other channels, most of the time they were originally made for and run on the Beeb."
