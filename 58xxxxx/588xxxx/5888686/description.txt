Terrifying Girls High School was released in 1973. I got this years ago and the only thing I did here was hard code the subtitles. It's a fun B flick that in it's day, was a horror flick of sorts but nowdays might be seen as more of a comedy. A real change of pace. Just DON'T end up at the Girls School of Hope.
