,darkjovirt,2010-10-15T03:45Z,@Patrick: The video is cut.. quality and texture are good.. No problem at installation.
,PatRicK_BeNetaR,2010-10-19T12:53Z,"Thanks for the response darkjovirt, It would be nice if people would include details of what has been cut from a game when uploading it.
I dont think i've seen a full version of gf1 upped yet, am I the only one who see the irony in cutting out the film sequences from games that are based on films?"
