,Plastixx,2010-12-26T04:54Z,"So I have this problem with this torrent unlike any other album I've come across: the entire CD when dragged into iTunes registers as a single track (which is well over an hour) instead of dividing up into the individual songs. I realize that it's possible to divide up the songs individually with the song times on the tracklist you've provided, but I just wanted to point out the tedium for people interested in downloading this torrent.

,deathtoallorangatans,2011-03-11T03:58Z,"this has every song on one track, which isn't smart at all. this one's better: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5923945/Kaskade-Dance.Love-2010-MTD"
,finnr2008,2011-10-21T21:31Z,"Thx, great release.
