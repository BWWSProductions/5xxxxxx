Hello there my (assumingly) African American counterpart, I will bestow upon this video a combined score of 16/20. The sound quality, while not perfect, is not of poor quality either.

Ahhh, silly silly Ebonics. To be honest though, worst Ebonics mockup ever, so he's problobly from India."

Great fun movie, humour without going over the top with plenty of action. I love the bit with John Malkovitch and the pig.

Yes there is a watermark at the top, ""property of summit entertainment"" all the way through."

Good quality early upload. Has a tiny blurred out message at the top, and every 30 minutes or so a small message appears at the bottom, warning against piracy (I lol'd).

Seeding for a week."
,Basher_101,2010-10-24T15:53Z,"Yeah, I haven't seen it... (yet) ty for uploading ^_^

but my favorite scene from the trailer is Bruce Willis getting out of his car :3 that was Epic Awesomeness!"
,loka123,2010-10-24T19:47Z,"Omg seed please!!

Will seed for 1 week after I get it!"
,nero001,2010-10-25T03:28Z,I just finished watching this movie and I was not left with a good impression. The movie did not suck as other movies in the past but it was just not a god story/plot. Mostly glamorized action/violence. Just a lot of unlikely events in an unlikely reality. I know it is a movie but still. I do not want to say not to watch it but you need to see if I am right with my assessment. I started last night and I actually fell asleep watching it about half way. 
,just3mr,2010-10-27T01:54Z,nice work :)
,bamjuice,2010-10-27T03:49Z,"I lol at every DvDScr ""Beware of piracy""

""Do not Illigaly download this move, or suffer charges of up to $250,000""

It's always a good laugh knowing that there bluffs never work, nor will they stop us.
For we are bloodsucking pirates grown from a seed.. we leech the blood then we breed some more seeds.

Long Live TPB (The Pirate Bay)

,healthygrillingtomatoes,2010-10-28T02:28Z,"Hey everyone. I love TPB and love sharing, but i need some advice i couldnt find anywhere. Sometimes when i turn off my computer and start it back up again, in my torrent program (bittorrent) where the completed files are that are uploading it says there is an error (missing files) and they wont upload unless i start it all over again. I dont want to start these downloads all over again obviously, but also dont want to be a jip and not share, what up with this as i dont want to have to delete torrents i just downloaded because they are not working, thanks for any advice.

That's the truth, the FLAWLESS copy is far better Vid quality but it has that silly banner ad so it's either a compromise or wait till the BDRip comes out."

grayish quality with strange thin bar going along the top of the movie that kind of magnifies (very annoying). also random anti piracy msg pops up, not sure how many times tho, the quality is so bad i wont be watching this torrent enough to find out.

try a different one perhaps"
