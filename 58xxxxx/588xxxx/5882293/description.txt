KC and the Sunshine Band - Give It Up [Bananas tv show promo].VOB



HQ very rare promo music video from an outstanding and rare 1980's tv show 
from Germany, broadcasted from 1981 to 1984, this is practically unknown 
in America, but this show has very well known artists of the 1980's.

The rarity of this show is that, all the appearances of very well known guests 
are a whole new promo music video production that easly could be considered as 
never seen before videos or second versions of several classic 80's videos.  (video does not have any logos)
