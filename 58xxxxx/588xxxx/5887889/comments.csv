Can you PLEASE get your hands on a ""normal"" 350mb .avi version of THE COLONY (US) S02 E10 for us???

I got all nine episodes from you ... and then you left everyone hanging for weeks by not uploading the season finale (EP10)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Only one guy has uploaded S02E10 (Prydon) but it is a 720 (1GB+) .MKV file, which a lot of us seem to have problems viewing!?!

Thanks in advance!!!"
