Uploader note:

Regards to all encoders especially Big thanx to Atom, FLAWL3SS and FraMeSToR crew

1. UNFINISHED movies HAVE synchro problemms. This is the nature of highly
  commpressed content. Also there seems to be the problemm with Haali Media
  Splitter. If you are using Media Player Classic please make sure you have
  enabled INTERNAL FILTER for MP4.
2. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you actually seen it. If you HAVE LIKED this
  release tell others about it. If you dont tell it too but dont forget to tell
  why, so I could learn from your opinion providing you something better in the
  future .
3. I can confirm the xbox360 media center extender plays this movie with no
  issues at all.
4. My releases are different than anybody else, so they SHOULD NOT be compared to
  any existing scene rules. I belive if there are different rules for Telecine
  and for DVDRip there can be also different rule for FASM QEBS releases. If the
  scene will overregulate itself, prohibiting new ideas to come it will soon
  become like our goverments.
5. If you like the movie, gratitude the creators by going to cinema, buying
  Bluray/DVD or any other possible way.
6. The movies can be directly streamable throught WWW, by Adobe Flash Player
  version 9 or higher.
7. The name FASM was derived from assembler efficiency. If you write something
  directly in assembler it is usually much faster and takes much less size,
  than the same thing written in C, Java etc... It also means FAchman SoofMan
  - founders of FASM
8. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is the h264 commpression method
  optimised directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved
  , each revision bringing quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard
  x264 encoding is explained by the same reason XVID encodes are better than
  DIVX3.
9. FASM recommends IMGBURN for burning those files into DVD.
10.Any subtitles made for different releases but the same type (Bluray Rip) should
  also work with this release.
