Synopis: Bill Nighy and Miranda Richardson star in a story of grief and celebrity, set in the intense spring and summer of New Labour\'s election victory and Diana\'s death. Nighy is a PR guru who has to stop and re-evaluate his world when his daughter threatens to leave his life, perhaps as revenge for his serial infidelities. Richardson plays a mother trying to bury her grief in an unconventional way after the loss of her young son. (IMDB)
