,demodocus88,2010-10-14T08:50Z,"@lawlersk8z

It's definitely legit. This is the same one uploaded to demonoid. It's a top quality screener, only flaw is the watermark at the top of the screen.

,.Leto.,2010-10-14T15:12Z,Decent quality but there's something wrong with the aspect ratio so it has to be corrected with your video player. The Classified release fixes that problem.

,dev183,2010-10-14T23:00Z,when i play the movie it sounds fucked up. you cant even hear the people talking??? any ideas?
,Eurokie,2010-10-15T01:02Z,"@ dev183 Go into options->Audio->Audio device(s) change it to stereo or mono depending on your speaker system!
Most movies come with 5.1 DS and therefor that option is chosen by default,You have a normal computer settup with 2 speakers right?Well if so theres your problem.Hope it was to any help ;)"

,zogulusnig,2010-10-15T07:35Z,"To all of you little monsters that have issues with the incorrect ASPECT RATIO (myself included), I was able to correct it with relative ease using HandBrake for OS X.

The original (incorrect AR) picture size is 680x360.  Change this to 680x280 and it's almost perfect.  You need to be able to change the ratio arbitrarily, as it's not a ""proper"" ratio.

I'm pretty sure I added an extra step in letting HandBrake output the file as an H264 MP4 file, as I need to run that through FFmpegX to end up with a DivX AVI that my Xbox360 can play."

What a bunch of dipshits!!!

,jzenman,2010-10-16T08:34Z,"If you want to change the aspect ratio you have settings for that in VLC player and K-Lite Codec Pack.

This is a nice screener rip. The movie was ok. The ending could have been a bit better. I'd give it about a 6.5 or 7 at best. "
,Geordie1981,2010-10-16T15:51Z,it's a nice quality film but totally could have done without the banner at the top of the screen the whole movie!
,catamaranman,2010-10-16T20:10Z,v-8/a-10 Great screener and fantastic movie!  I expected another mindless shoot-'em-up like the expendables but what I got was more on par with Oceans 11.  Lots of witty humor and acting (John Malkovich!) that makes the movie watchable again and again! 
,catamaranman,2010-10-16T20:26Z,@Silentbob:  So does every x264 encoded Blu-Ray rip get a v-10?  Every properly encoded DVD a V-9?  Perhaps we should just continue to assign a number 1-10 that best relates how WE FEEL the quality is!  BTW....no aspect ratio problems for me with VLC and its a screener so you know there is going to be a watermark...get over it!

,SlayerD,2010-10-17T16:50Z,I'm not picky and appreciate great downloads. I simply want to say thanks for what would be a good quality movie. Your effort is appreciated. The sound does not work at all and believe me I have every codec and every media player imaginable. It just gives a high pitched whistle. First time for everything I guess.

If u don't like the quality than go watch it at the theater. Spend your money. Don't write stupid comments complaining about how the quality could be better and let us true TPB subscribers watch whatever movie it is we're trying to dload.
