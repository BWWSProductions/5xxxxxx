,bigwill347,2010-12-25T23:05Z,you have to right click the torrent and open the folder. then right click it again in the torrent and remove it. Dowload VLC player for free. They ur downloaded movie should play.you're welcome probee.
,bigwill347,2010-12-25T23:07Z,well of course you gotta double click it once you remove it from the torrent downloader. sometimes files are rar or zipped to save space. gotta unrar/zip.
