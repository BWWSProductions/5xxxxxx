,tavery80,2011-04-17T07:28Z,"@hmkem - wrong.  They turn off just fine.

But, there IS a problem with the Audio 1 track, described here as the AC-3 audio.  All vocals come from the Right channel, not Center.  And effects come from the Left channel.  It almost sounds as if the sound was encoded R to L instead of F to R.  Audio 1 playback tried using WMP, SMPlayer, Media Player Classic and through a WDTV Live Plus.  

The Audio 2 track, the AAC, works fine."
,Birdsand,2011-05-06T17:02Z,I can also confirm that the AC3 audio is a problem. All to the right channel. Shame it wasn't checked before uploading.
