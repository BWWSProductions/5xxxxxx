Belshazzar's Feast start with traditional folk music, add a touch of classical and jazz, throw in a bit of pop and music hall, and top it off wry humour for a unique live experience. In November 2009 they released 'Frost Bites', the follow up to the successful 'Food Of Love'. 'Frost Bites is a collection of winter and Christmas material and its release was followed by a national tour. Belshazzar's Feast received a coveted nomination for the Best Duo Award at the 2010 BBC Folk Awards. In 1995 Paul Hutchinson (accordion) and Paul Sartin (oboe, violin and vocals) shared a musical passion borne out of the desire to earn sufficient money to support their extravagant lifestyles. Their amazing musicianship coupled with wry humour stunned audiences around Europe and the States. After a brief sabbatical, they're back!
