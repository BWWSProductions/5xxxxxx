[V],twentyforty,2010-10-12T15:58Z,"@kzrockz: Everything fine here. Triple check before scream ""Wolf!"" next time.
Read playback tips again and again.  It is ridiculous to use VLC as reference player."

[V],twentyforty,2010-10-12T21:19Z,"@kzrockz: Glad. but is quite possible that HDTV stream have errors. Every week my encodes have these errors, but they are NOT encoding errors, and strictly speaking, one could write angry letters to god, blaming for stormy weather in time of airing. If I see some minor errors, I could avoid them with cutting out affected frames, but - be reasonable, I CANNOT (and I wont) watch ALL the shows in entirety... that way you all wold be having my encodes at leas with one-two day delay - and frankly - 98% of the shows I do not watch for various reasons. My encodings do not represent What I like to watch - but What people tend to download, under my terms, of course. To share with others. To give. That's all.
Therefore,my encodings came without any special warranty, except they have been all encoded with care and honest tendency to offer decent quality for given size."
