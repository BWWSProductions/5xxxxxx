 This 1933 film starring Lionel Barrymore was lost for many years in the RKO vault and was finally released and is a gem of a film to view. Dr. Eli Watt is played by Lionel who returns to his home town in farm country and starts up practice after not being successful and returns with his son, Joel McCrea,(Jimmy Watt). Eli Watt finds that the local people in town cannot afford to pay a doctor and bargain with potatoes, squash and everything else but money. There is a patient who gives birth to a baby girl, however, the mother dies and the husband does not want his baby girl and threatens to kill the doctor. So Eli Watt decides to raise the baby girl who is later played by Frances Dee,(Joan Stockton). This is a very enjoyable film showing how country doctors operated years and years ago.
