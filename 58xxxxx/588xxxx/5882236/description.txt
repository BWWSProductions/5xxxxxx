Killian Wells is a pop singer, songwriter, and record producer from New York City.

Killian's first single to receive significant attention was "V.I.P.", released as a digital EP on July 21, 2009 on iTunes and Amazon MP3 through Wells' own indie label Inferno Records. "V.I.P." has received airplay on Top 40 stations  and was added to US Airways in-flight entertainment Hit List channel in November 2009 alongside artists like Jay Sean, Taylor Swift, and Britney Spears making Wells the only unsigned artist in the lineup. Wells co-wrote and co-produced the album version of "V.I.P." The digital EP also features remixes by LorD and Master (who also remixed Dangerous Muse), Purple Moon Banana (RuPaul), and Killian himself under the moniker Knightwriter.

The original digital EP was replaced on May 25th 2010 by a new official single mix of "V.I.P.", re-released to coincide with the debut of an accompanying music video by director Karl Giant (Ultra NatÃ©, Cyndi Lauper) 

Killian was selected by celebrity panelists Jacob Underwood and Rich Cronin as one of 30 acts to perform in the music showcase Pure Pop 2009 at the historic Webster Hall. The showcase on November 14, 2009 was Killian's first live performance. Jack Chambers (2008 season winner of So You Think You Can Dance Australia) appeared as one of Killian's dancers.

In December 2008 Killian became part of photographer Adam Bouska's NOH8 Campaign in response to California Proposition 8 (2008) Killian was the 28th individual and one of the first pop artists to join the campaign. Celebrities such as Blake Lewis, Kathy Griffin, and Pete Wentz have since lent their faces to the cause.
