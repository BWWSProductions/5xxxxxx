,Wouto1997,2010-10-13T23:25Z,"Same with me, there's something wrong with the JavaApplicationStub (i'm running Snow Leopard)"
,maxomous,2010-10-13T23:52Z,"@Wouto1997
something worth trying; download the latest version of the app here http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp
unzip and try the application inside. if still no luck the problem wont be JavaApplicationStub."

,lolrofljk,2010-10-15T01:38Z,I tryed to play offline but it said that I needed to play online once to enable offline.
,maxomous,2010-10-15T13:09Z,"@lolrofljk
check you've put the minecraft folder in the users library, not system library"
,Xgflame,2010-10-16T01:55Z,"Ha! It worked perfectly, thanks for the upload maxmous. By the way, is there any way to enlarge the game screen or remove the technical stuff in the upper right corner?"
,CosmicThePirate,2010-10-16T10:49Z,The client is still not opening...  I downloaded the one from the minecraft website and it didn't work...  I copied the minecraft folder into app support.  assistance would be greatly appreciated if anyone feels so kind :)
,Xgflame,2010-10-16T16:44Z,"@Cosmicthepirate

Make sure you downloaded the minecraft client specific to your os off of the official site. Go to your user systems for the application support, not from disk. Delete the current minecraft folder and leave the finder open open. Copy the minecraft folder from the torrent and paste it in the past minecraft's place. Then try running minecraft."
,Xgflame,2010-10-16T16:45Z,By users system i mean yourusername/library/application support.
,PeebriaN,2010-10-17T13:24Z,SEED YOOUUUU GREEDY PEOPLE :P
,PeebriaN,2010-10-17T13:29Z,I will seed for a couple days so others can get this (if it works) AMAZING GAME!! xD
,CosmicThePirate,2010-10-20T08:57Z,"@Xgflame

I feel increasingly stupider by the second.  I have downloaded this torrent, put the ""minecraft"" folder contained within into Macintosh HD/Users/myname/Library/Application Support"" gone to the minecraft website, downloaded the client, put it in macintosh HD/Applications/, double clicked the client, but to no success.  It will not startup.  


I am running OSX 10.6.4.  

I don't really know what I am doing wrong...  I feel I have followed all instructions correctly, but hey.  If you at all feel like assisting me, then I would be greatly in debt to you."
,2nb3,2010-10-22T02:36Z,it says i need to go online to activate the offline can anybody help me out?
,gregthegeek,2010-11-04T01:08Z,Not working!!! I have the Folder in Users/Max/Library/Application Support and the Minecraft.app in my Applications folder. I also downloaded the official launcher and just put it on my desktop. Anyone who can help?
,localterror,2010-11-04T21:39Z,"Besides the problems with getting this to work, it won't work in the end, since the makers of Minecraft updated it so you must login online before playing offline.

So basically, you're screwed until there is a fix, no matter what."
,gulart11,2010-11-25T18:19Z, thx man!!!
,vVPhaseVv,2010-11-26T19:23Z,"Okay so, to get this working do what it says in the text file, and then GO DOWNLOAD THE OFFICIAL APP! http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp

Now then, put the official app on your desktop, open it, and type random stuff for the user and pass. Then play offline! Worked perfect for me :D"

,samuel_5294,2011-04-13T14:15Z,"guys to run the minecraft, y download the latest version of the app here http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp then y right click and ""show package content"", then find the resource folder, there should be folder named ""Java"", go inside and double click the ""MinecraftLauncher.jar"", the new launcher should ask you to login, just login with empty username and password. It'll fail to login and show two option, select the ""play offline"". To simplify the whole process, make an alias of the jar and put it on your desktop or whereever"
,ashcz,2011-05-16T20:21Z,"Hi, any chance of an update at all?
Love the game it's just that the current version you can't make beds and stuff which makes the game a lot more effort aha"
