,sewolawen73,2011-02-12T00:25Z,"How does one burn this DVD to view on a DVD player? When I burned it and tried to play on a regular DVD player that supports DVD-Rs, it stays looped on the first 10 seconds of Phonzeit with no sound.  I tried burning with Nero and then Toast.  On Nero, I get a comment saying that the one of the files is too big and that I have to burn as a UDF - DVD ROM.  How do I go about burning that through either program? Please help and thanks for the great torrent!"
