Will it work with 2.26 ghz? Assassins creed didnt run very well. Or yeah, it lagged a little bit.

And I tried this game on windows with parallels desktop 5, And it lagged like Hell. :p"

,mack79,2010-10-28T00:37Z,"THE CRACK HAS BEEN MADE!

MACK69AC2CRACK

Instructions:

1) The crack is fairly simple. You just need a macbook that fits the requirements, and a BRAIN

2) Go to skidrows manual crack 

3) do what he says with the host file, except do it on your mac. you can find out how to do this easily if you search google ;)

4) run the necessary commands, and just do the mac equivalent of the windows commands

then run the game

5)???

6) PROFIT!

Nah, im joking about 5 and 6 lol, but the fifth step is to play the game. Umm the first thing i can say about the game is that it will give you some hiccups at first, such as a freezeup here and there, so it is reccomended that you not use any applications in the background while playing the game. other than that, it is a well made game. if this doesn't work for you, just use bootcamp and download AC2 + the windows crack and play it there.

your welcome in advance!

*As proof, there is a video on youtube of a guy playing AC2 on his iMac. I have been in correspondence with him about this method, which is also what he used to play AC2 on his mac. However, he was spanish so he couldn't really tell people how to get it. Im english so...i posted it. Later!"
,mack79,2010-10-28T00:39Z,"Also, there is a bug where the game may crash unexpectedly. however, ac2 usually has autosaved before this has happened most of the time, so i never really lost progress. in not sure what the exact issue is, but i suspect that it is a permissions issue. anyway, ill post the fix as i find out."
,Boogerland11,2010-10-28T00:47Z,Please Find a CRACK!!!
[T],Apokarteron,2010-10-28T01:50Z,"@mack79
Which one is the SKIDROW manual crack?  Elucidate your cracking method."
,Pyro7,2010-10-28T03:21Z,"Hey Mack, could you leave a link or explain it a little more like Apokarteron said?"
,mack79,2010-10-28T05:23Z,"Woah, disregard my earlier instruction. I was refering to the FIRST Skidrow crack, not the little things you see popping up now. However, I was playing tonight and the crack has ""messed up"". My savegames were deleted, and the game crashed. And I was basically kicked out of the system, because when i started the game again, it wanted a live key. I tried the crack over and it didn't work and now I am back to square 1. 

I guess this means that a new and more official crack will need to be made. If it is any help, one can base the new crack on Skidrows original offiline server crack (im too lazy to find the link). 
The host file on a mac can be edited, and an offline server can be made."
,lplucas,2010-10-28T11:39Z,"I want to try this crack. there's just 1 thing.. where is this crack you're referring to. i can't find it.. A link to the crack would be highly appreciated.
Gamer in need here, thanks in advance."
,thapheon1,2010-10-28T17:16Z,The system requirements isnt right. Or is it?
,thapheon1,2010-10-28T17:18Z,"Forgot to add, mack79, If the crack worked, and next day not, You must have done something to it, if it works one time it should work again, And lets try to find out why it didnt work next day, And fix the problem"
,zerty008,2010-10-28T18:43Z,"@mac79: how did you install the crack from skidrow in the first place?  

The crack for windows uses a modified dll (ubiorbiapi_r2.dll) that you replace with the original. For mac this is a .dylib

"
,Strykerr,2010-10-28T23:37Z,Hmm Well the skidrow crack I dled has a dll file...im assuming it replaces libBinkMachOx86.dlyib?
,filipthe1,2010-10-30T12:57Z,"Come on, guys. I need a crack or product key"
,thapheon1,2010-10-30T13:00Z,The guy from spain with assassins creed 2 was using Parallels desktop 5 to run it. a virtual machine with windows 7.
,thapheon1,2010-10-30T16:58Z,"lomotek, I think everyone needs a crack now or a product key, i guess we have to be patient, Or if mack79 tell us which skidrow crack he used, we all can try to use it somehow, Or also, i found a thing that makes an offline server, to edit the host file and start some apache server with xampp. I havent tried this yet,"
,thapheon1,2010-10-30T21:49Z,"God damn. My eyes are tired.

I've found a way to do the crack or whatever it is. Playable.

But im not sure it works, im 90% sure.

Here's the link.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5475770/Assassins_Creed_2_Server_Emulator_%28Beta%29

I've come to the very end on the steps, but i got a little error. "
,thapheon1,2010-10-30T21:55Z,"Lol, forgot to add: 

you gotta do the cmd commands in terminal, and in mac commands. I'll show you how \/

to run the python file, write the following

python /Users/yourname/whereeverYouSavedIt/tls.py

to edit the hosts file, open terminal and write: sudo nano /private/etc/hosts

then add the lines in the bottom.

click ctrl+o to save it, then ctrl+x to exit.

on step 16, to browse it, write cd /users/yourname/

and whereever you saved it."
,utron11,2010-10-30T22:29Z,"@thapheon1: your link is for windows only. Are you serious that it can work on mac? I don't think so!!!
Btw, we should try to use some trick with ipatch or something like that. Some games have been crack by that way. Good luck!!!"
,thapheon1,2010-10-30T23:24Z,"Yes i think it works, becaouse i tried it on windows and i got the same error, and its nothing to edit in the games folder. So it should work."
,Strykerr,2010-10-31T03:49Z,"Ok well I know this isn;t an issue for most users but for some reason, the sudo command wont let me type in any entries for the pass. This might be because its a school mac but its w/e. If u can crack it, let us know :) Im up for findin keygens as i check tpb OFTEN"

Thank you for the torrent btw.
"
,utron11,2010-11-16T18:38Z,"@everyone: To reduce the lag, basically, you must have the strong processor (core +2 duo +2.6GHz) and high video RAM (+512MB). Now i recommend some more things for guys who just only have computers which have low or medium configuration, and laptop (it's maybe riddiculous but it's fine for me! :) )
- Keep you computer as cool as possible (when you run the game, your PC will be very hot, and so, as time pass by, the PC will be slower and slower. So use some methods of cool down)
- For the laptop (in here i say macbook): Keep your fan run as strong as possible. In my macbook pro, first, the game run very lag and slow. But when my fan run stronger, strangely, it run smoother and faster (although it still get some lag but it's acceptable).
*The test here is done on the lowest settings. I recommend to do so!!!"

,hernin,2010-11-21T20:08Z,"@everyone
i think i know the solution for that problem when you look at the apple of eden and the video stops. It is the same solution which helped when saves where gone. You just uninstall the game, and install it again. But before that you have to do this: go to the games contents/Resources and than there is this folder called Storage, save it to your desktop, and than there is this file called orbitdll_savegame_log_aGVucmlrYXM= ,save it too. After reinstalling your game, go to contents/resources and you will see that there is no storage folder, folder called SAVES and that ""orbit"" file. Create SAVES folder (i dont realy know that this is necessary because it's allways empty) and than copy storage folder and ""orbit file"" to recources folder. Thats it. Video didn't stoped for me after this. Enjoy!"

,Ludisto,2011-01-22T14:28Z,"I downloaded this torrent (and the crack) and tried to play the game. I soon found that it is a very good game, but it's one of those games for which it is strongly advisable to use a controller. This Mac version, whether downloaded here or bought in the shops, does not provide controller compatibility. I have long had an Xbox 360 wireless controller for Windows games I used to play, and I also have a PS3 controller for my PS3. I bought and downloaded ControllerMate, a very good app that enables you to configure controllers for use in games on the Mac, but even with this app, controllers won't work on AC2. I have now bought a pre-owned AC2 for the PS3 for Â£14.99 ($23.98). I strongly recommend that you save time downloading this torrent by getting this game for a different platform that will allow you to play it with a controller. Nevertheless, thank you to Apokarteron for making this torrent available, because I wouldn't have known that the game was worth paying for had I not tried it here first."

Ok, then run the .DMG in this download. Then run the .PKG (the icon with a box).
Install it. You shouldn't get any problems with that part.  Then, when it has installed, DONT OPEN!
Open the crack folder and unzip the crack.app.zip. Then run the Assassins's creed launcher.
That should be it. Any other problems i cant help you with because i didn't get any. just thought i would help a bit seeing as there isn't any instructions :)"

,Lust3rX,2012-01-09T02:18Z,"Problem Plz Help!
I installed the game and the crack, It worked perfectly fine for a few hours. I left the computer for half the day and came back to it. All the sudden the camera movement with the mouse stopped working mid-game. Whenever I restarted the game it would freeze my computer. Then the mouse just stopped working completely when I turned the game on. I know its not a mouse problem, I tried reinstalling everything and nothing seems to work...

I'm running on OSX Lion 10.7.2 Intel Core i5 2.5 Ghz and 4 GB of Ram"

,steph0804,2012-05-04T10:40Z,"I was about to start a mission, and then the screen went white with the little diamond with a ! on it appeared in the middle. I know this is supposed to happen, but afterwards, the whiteness and the ! stayed while the radar, synch squares and other stuff stayed. So basically I could run around, but I couldn't see Ezio, the bad guys, the good guys or the scenery, which meant I had to fight blind judging by the little v's that appear on top of the bad guys' heads. but after that was over I was hoping it would turn back to normal, but it's still like that and I can't play because I have no idea where the buildings and stuff are. Help please?"
,joaolonas,2012-05-04T23:33Z,"How about quiting the game and restarting the mission?

MacBook Pro late 2011 10.7.2 (lion)
Ram: 4GB
Processor: 2.4GHz i7
Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 3000 384MB vram OR AMD Radeon HD 6770m 1gb vram (I have 2 graphics card I can choose which one I want to use, preferably the AMD because it's far superior, but if it's not compatible and I have to use the Intel 3000 card thats fine, I'm not to hung up on graphics settings so long as it doesn't lag)

Thanks"
,Verdux,2012-06-17T01:25Z,"Ok I'm running MBP late 2011 10.7.2 with 4 gigs ram AMD radeon hd 6770m 1gb vram and 2.4ghz i7... everything works great. well, not really... 

PROS: 
1: It works. 
2: I didn't have to pay for it. 
3: It's a great game. 

CONS: 
1: THE RESOLUTION is SHIT. I can't find out how to change it. Don't take me the wrong way, it's definitely playable, but for what my mac can do, I want more. I like a nice looking game, but I'm not too OCD about so I can live with that.
2: For some reason, I can't get it to run in windowed mode, and I can't alt-tab out of it. So once I start playing, the ONLY way to do something else like change my music or check emails, or w/e is to quit the game, which is incredibly annoying since I like to flick in and out of apps. But hey, I didn't pay for it, so I'm not complaining, it's just a shame. 

Anybody have any ideas? If anyone can help with my resolution and app switching problems, PLEASE email me: sng98@live.com"
,joaolonas,2012-06-23T11:38Z,Guys i was playing well the game and was almost at the end when i downloaded ACbrotherhood and then my AC2 stoped working! How come is this possible?
