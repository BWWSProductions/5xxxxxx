@skeetskeetmf

The answer to your question is in the notes for this or any of my releases.

I use ISO as the movie's container because firstly, my releases are predominantly re-encoded to burn to a single DVD5 disk, to be watched on any AVCHD compatible, blu-ray, DVD-HD, or PS3 player, and it makes it very easy for the user being able to just burn an image file. Secondly, I prefer uncompressed video formats to compressed, because you KNOW it will fit on your DVD5 disk. The video file within the container is the same, apart from mine have full blu-ray/AVCHD folder/file structure, so they are ready to burn - an MKV file isn't, unless you have an MKV compatible player, which most aren't, and a file that's under 4.36Gb.

If you want to watch the movie on your computer, you can either leave it in it's ISO format and load it onto a Virtual Drive, or you can extract the ISO, which only takes a few minutes, and watch it from the m2ts file on the same platers as an MKV file - KMplayer, etc etc.

It's horses for courses, and it really isn't that different, only that the video streamers amongst us are hooked into thinking that MKV is the only way - it isn't."
