Bought this VHS rip online not long ago. Since this movie is very hard to find and probably never will get a DVD release I decided to up it here. The picture quality is not good, but acceptable. I have no idea if he recorded it from TV or bought it on VHS. Bitrate is 4.44 Mb/sec as stated above, but I guess that is not really corresponding to the actual picture quality as this is a VHS rip.  By uploading this I am filling my own request, hehe! I hope someone else enjoys this sleeper movie.
