Please, post the iMDB link next time."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-16T09:01Z,"@Arjunnn: Of course I remember you. It's just four days gone from pointing you to HandBrake, and instead of e-mailing me with news, you posted on my torrent a link to yours. Just a tip: it's called advertising - if request haven't been placed - and very often person get banned from TPB for posting links to his own torrents on other people threads.

Regarding your question, you should use ""Well tempered Clavier"" (by settings) uTorrent, and since I have no idea Which program you use and What connection you have - I cannot give better answer."
,Arjunnn,2010-10-16T09:59Z,"sorry dude:) 
i dint kno abt dat:) 
but the software s gr8. literally converting everthing on my pc. thanx again.
my internet connection s a 2mbps broadband. i get a downl speed upto 200kbps.
now i saw ur email id. i'll contact u thru email."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-16T11:13Z,"@arjunnn: ""2mbps broadband. i get a downl speed upto 200kbps.""

Big letter B and small letter b: one stand for bytes and second one for bits. There is a big difference, LOL.

It should be ""2mbps broadband. i get a downl speed upto 200KB/s.""

... and it seems as slow connection, maybe too slow for any upload. If your line is asymmetrical DSL - your upload should be around 12.8 KB/s. Too low for today standards and especially for uploads above few images or few mp3. Sorry."
