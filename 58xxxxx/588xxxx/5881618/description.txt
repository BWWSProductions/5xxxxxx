"A Matter of Life and Death"

The White House grapples with a mysterious 
biological threat. Their only hope is to 
crack Sophia (Laura Innes) during 
interrogation. Meanwhile, Vicky (Taylor 
Cole) and Carter (guest star D.B. Sweeney) 
keep their hostage captive while they 
await further instructions. FBI Agent 
Collier (guest star Heather McComb), on 
her search for Leila (Sarah Roemer), 
stumbles upon Vicky's secret life. 
Elsewhere, a powerful businessman, Dempsey 
(guest star Hal Holbrook) with classified 
intelligence and ties to the White House, 
emerges from the shadows.

Enjoy :)
