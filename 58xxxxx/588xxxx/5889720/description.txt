What is the PimsleurÂ® difference?

The Pimsleur Method provides the most effective language-learning program ever developed. The Pimsleur Method gives you quick command of Turkish structure without tedious drills. Learning to speak Turkish can actually be enjoyable and rewarding.

The key reason most people struggle with new languages is that they aren't given proper instruction, only bits and pieces of a language. Other language programs sell only these pieces -- dictionaries; grammar books and instructions; lists of hundreds or thousands words and definitions; audios containing useless drills. They leave it to you to assemble these pieces as you try to speak. Pimsleur enables you to spend your time learning to speak the language rather than just studying its parts.

When you were learning English, could you speak before you knew how to conjugate verbs? Of course you could. That learning process is what Pimsleur replicates. Pimsleur presents the whole language as one integrated piece so you can succeed.

With Pimsleur you get:

    * Grammar and vocabulary taught together in everyday conversation,
    * Interactive audio-only instruction that teaches spoken language organically,
    * The flexibility to learn anytime, anywhere,
    * 30-minute lessons designed to optimize the amount of language you can learn in one sitting.

Millions of people have used Pimsleur to gain real conversational skills in new languages quickly and easily, wherever and whenever -- without textbooks, written exercises, or drills.

Conversational Turkish includes the 10 lessons from Pimsleur's Basic Turkish plus an additional 6 lessons.

The 16 lessons in Conversational Turkish are the same first 16 lessons in the Pimsleur Comprehensive Turkish Level 1.

The Pimsleur Method

On the surface, the Pimsleur Method is a way to begin speaking and understanding a foreign language effortlessly. In fact, it is a dynamic combination of techniques that will pull you inside a language allowing you to engage in complex conversations with confidence and fluency.

Developed after years of research (and through much trial and error), PimsleurÂ® Language Programs are simply the most effective method for teaching people to speak foreign languages. Dr. Paul Pimsleur devoted his life to language teaching and testing and was a leading expert in applied linguistics.

The Pimsleur Method is based on two key principles: the Principle of Anticipation and a scientific principle of memory training called Graduated Interval Recall. In addition, all Pimsleur courses feature highly-selected vocabulary taught in real-life situations that maximize your ability to recall and communicate on demand.
