@raywwww: Doing H264 collection conversion is a bit too much, unless you have access to some supercomputer. You cannot obtain quality by reencoding XviD into H264. I cannot play any role in it.

However, try MeGUI or HandBrake, but this is maybe step too far."

If you can afford it,you should just buy a portable hard drive that you can connect thru a USB port.This way you can keep your older stuff intact and have lots of room for new stuff.The prices for 500 gigs or 1 terabyte are very reasonable now."

,htctouch,2010-10-11T20:03Z,"same one was the problem wid me . i used megui to convert my 700 mb files . but u must google it how to use it coz its quite confusing but once u get it [the steps] its realy good.though its imposbl to get quality like 2040

just a thought - can b taken as joke
