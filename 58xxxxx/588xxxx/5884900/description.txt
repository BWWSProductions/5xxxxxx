"Strangers on a Treadmill"

Claire and Mitchell enlist each other's help 
in trying to spare their significant others 
from embarrassment - Cameron from his 
unfortunate wardrobe choices, and Phil from 
his joke-ridden speech for the realtors' 
banquet. Meanwhile Jay tries to prove a point 
to Gloria by attending a quinceaera thrown by 
one of his employees, and Haley gives Alex 
sisterly advice on how to be cool.

Back to a non-segged, non-douchebag settings,
quality encode this week, Enjoy :)
