Sculpture is a psychological horror gore-fest that tells
the story of Ashley Steele, an aspiring artist who
returns home after the death of her father only to find
the haunting memories of her repressed childhood await
her. She is commissioned to create a life-size sculpture
of the perfect man, and uses body builders from her
brother's gym as models, but soon finds herself spiraling
down a path of unspeakable psychopathic terror and murder
as she frantically tries to complete her masterpiece
