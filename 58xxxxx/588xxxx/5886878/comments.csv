Sorry to bother you. :("
,anseio,2011-05-17T07:28Z,You can use mkvmerge GUI to remove the russian track and set the english to default. mkvmerge is part of the mkvtoolnix set of applications and is easy to use.

You need to install latest ""Haali Media Splitter"" - google that. Then, you'll see it in MPC filters during playback and it'll allow you to manually switch mkv packed-inside audio & subs streams. Also in your tray."
