Ishmael is a local reporter covering a murder trial involving the 1954 death of a fisherman in a small island community in the Pacific Northwest. What first looks like a straight-forward case soon turns into a unnerving series of mysteries, intensified by flashbacks to WWII Japanese concentration camps and the realization that the wife of the accused murderer is his childhood sweetheart.
