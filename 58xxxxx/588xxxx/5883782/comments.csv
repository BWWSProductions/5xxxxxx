This YSmenu is for R$i Ultra ONLY."
,ctqsrtq,2010-10-15T18:45Z,"Lufia works without lags and saves ok.
(all version available to download http://thepiratebay.org/user/ctqsrtq/ )"
,Archolm,2010-10-19T21:18Z,"More then anything i'm interested what tools you used to create this, seeing as the firmware is in chinese... but it does fix problems on the R4i Ultra cause I tried it out with Lufia (unpatched) and that did not work on 1.56 update located on the offical site.

So I hope that you will either release an updated one with english settings or update the info on how to create this?

Many thanks!"
