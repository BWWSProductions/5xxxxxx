,lilars26,2010-10-11T15:54Z,Thank you.
,lilars26,2010-10-11T19:48Z,"For a show that has very little action,the writers are quite good at keeping us watching.Although last week Will did shoot the intruder in the head and his friend did a cleanup job,this is the exception.Now Will sleeps with a baseball bat and his dead friends wife answers the door with a gigantic butcher knife.Lots of paranoia here.It goes to show you that a show about intelligence and written with intelligence can work.IMHO"

,lilars26,2010-10-11T21:06Z,For the 1st 3 episodes I thought it was a British show.(LOL)
,hardtofind,2010-10-11T23:50Z,What is the title associated with episode 12
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-12T07:52Z,"@hardtofind: Title associated? Explain, please... or learn to use Google - I am not search engine."
,hardtofind,2010-10-12T16:39Z,"If you can take the time to upload it you can at least include the name of the episode. All the other 11 episodes have a name, or title associated with each episode. I hope this isnt too far over your head to comprehend there mister google. since when does a simple question deserve an arrogant answer. Don't let your ego over run your common sense. smart ass"

""All the other 11 episodes have a name, or title associated with each episode""?

Fuck off, and go there when they have titles for low IQ pricks like you."
,texi400,2012-03-01T22:15Z,"The episode title is ""Wayward Sons"". Much easier that waste all that bile and ill feeling.
This torrent is exceptionally poor quality BTW - but in keeping with the shabby personality of this 'twentyforty' tweeb. Much better torrents elsewhere."
