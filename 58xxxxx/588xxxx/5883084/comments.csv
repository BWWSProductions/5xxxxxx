,ckhoshor,2010-10-13T23:32Z,seed plz
[T],nlx_78,2010-10-14T12:57Z,i seed with 6mb/s
[T],nlx_78,2010-10-15T11:00Z,Think you meant a tracker-problem when it shows 0 seeds. All of my torrents have more seeds than shown in the list
,listenherenow,2010-10-16T10:22Z,"I have the copy of this from fxg and it seems to play fine - 799 megs - but only on the system - will not play proper on the divx player. plust the subs on that one sucks. 
  I will give this a try and report back since no one seems to have placed a audio video comment about this one. 

  Thanks. "
,listenherenow,2010-10-16T11:30Z,"fast download. ----------
 The audio is out of sync "" Slightly when veiwed on the PC"" almost 2 full seconds out when Played On a regular Divx player""------   

  The video is fine - very watchable - I'd rate it 8. -------
   The audio makes this not watchable to me however, seems unbearable.--------- 

   I am not sure why the sync problem is different for the pc and the Divx player. The player is not the problem howver, Several other videos in the same file folders in the same drive play perfectly at any given time.---------- 

   Seems a shame really -  i wish It was fixed properly. -----------

  by the way - the fgx - maxspeed is Much worse @799 mgs with garbled pixulated sections and that sort of goofyness. -------
This ones only real issue is the sync. ------

  I am not saying i can do better bro - - in fact - I have never learned this at all and that's why I leave it up to people that know whatthey are doing but this is not dine. - there is something incorrect. -----I know I would get it wrong so I don't post my stuff. LOL -

,Luisppk,2010-12-17T08:24Z,"This goes for everyone... windows media player ĂÂĄSUCKS! ...pls return to your senses and forget being newbies... dowloand VLC media mplayer or BS Player. Them both are free and easy to find in google.
And about the audio out of sync in the DVD Player is because it is a VBR one, and many Standalone Players can't support this kind.
You can find out downloading 'GSPOT 2.70a' is free and also easy to find with google. Is a specialprogram to see the codecs of audio and video files. look under 'audio', and find out if it is CBR o VBR. If CBR... no problem. If VBR... you really need to be lucky.

One last thing... Pls, how much time you download from torrent and yet don't know a thing? is it about laziness or just being retard? 
At least do some minimal research... 
I really hate stupid bastards crying again and again, about not being able to see a movie in windows media player! You spend hours waiting to download movies... can't do a tiny research in google trying to solve your problem?
Damn!!"
,TheMeatshack69,2011-08-13T02:11Z,Whoa chill on the negativity many people just get on here to download shit.... For their purposes knowing how to download a torrent is good enough. Just try to be cool enough not to flip when someone doesn't do exactly what you do. I'm bouts do download this shit niggaz and I'ma seed
,Mshake,2011-09-25T12:29Z,"Yo my Nigger, hahaha, he's got a point, this isnt the place for asking questions. They have an actual forum for that with instructions and all. Or just google it.But to the point...
A / 9
V / 9
Great upload and you especially have to consider the size of the file. Doesnt get better. There is no lag in the Audio for those who use VLC. Later Niggers. "
,roboboy11,2012-03-08T03:16Z,I downloaded this and it works perfectly on my mp4 player! Low quality but what would i need good quality for. If you overcome quality that's a good thing!
