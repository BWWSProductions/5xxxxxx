[V],meech,2010-11-25T19:48Z,"** Please note about the order of episodes...

The torrent follows exactly the episode order that Netflix has them in...which I assumed would be correct.

Upon doing a little research, it seems that the air dates (at least the U.S. air dates) were broadcast in a different order than the order of production.  You may have noticed this discrepancy.  Netflix, in their infinite wisdom mixed the two different progressions together for different seasons...and even gets this wrong a couple times.

For example, This season 1 torrent (and thus Netflix) follows the production order exactly.  However the air dates were different.  So if you want to follow the production date, watch season 1 as listed in the torrent.  If you wish to watch it by air date, you'll have to watch the torrent out of order.

However, Season 2 of the torrent (and Netflix) follows the actually AIR DATE that they were shown on television, not the production date...EXCEPT, the last episode ""Die Me Dichotomy"" was produced AND aired last, AFTER the 3-part ""Liars and Guns"" episodes.  Netflix (and this torrent) have ""Die Me Dichotomy"" before the 3-parter. So Netflix has this totally wrong.

Season 3 was aired in the same order of the production order...and Netflix has the same.  So whether you choose/wish to watch by the air date or the production date, Season 3 is the same for both.

Season 4 is the same as Season 3...all three: the air date, production date, and netflix order all follow the same order.

You may have a preference to choose to watch by air date, as the original viewers experienced it, or by production date as it was produced.  Whatever you choose, your best bet is to go to the following website: http://www.farscapeworld.com/episodes/

With this website, you can view the different orders...production and air date orders.  This is only an issue for seasons 1 and 2."

,fuckmenot,2011-09-30T09:02Z,"What the frell happened with my ÂľTorrent when I paused this download... missing files that are there and not continuing :P
Took me like a few microns to get back here, and relocate the torrentfile and start all over... Well, almost... I already watched 6 episodes and I'm thankfull to ones who worked for these hq rips and share em, with scifi minds alike."
,boss5705,2012-02-26T07:34Z,"Farscape-s02e19.Die.Me.Dichotomy.mkv is actually the last, ep22 and is tbc in S03.
Watching this out of order before the three ""liar.guns.money"" eps will totally ruin your day.
So thanks for the rip, but this misnumbering is a huge error."
,Tleilaxu_Ghola,2012-04-07T07:04Z,"I downloaded and watched Season 2 without reading these comments. I often do not read the comments. Well I got fucxked because season 2 is, as noted here, OUT OF ORDER. So I got to see the season finale (ep19) before the 3 part ""LIARS, GUNS and MONEY"" to set it up.

My question is; what the hell if so difficult about renaming/renumber the fucking files in the correct order before uploading the fucking thing. To hell with ""air date/production date"" bullshit. Renumbering the files IN THE CORRECT STORY ORDER BEFORE UPLOADING would save everyone the bullshit of watching the end season out of order.

Ruined my day is right. Pissed me off a little too. No point in watching ""Lies Guns and Money"" parts 1 to 3 now. might as well skip on to Season 3.

The sad thisng is, is that the fix is so easy that there is almost no excuse for it."
,husker103,2012-04-15T09:56Z,"well, thx for the comments, i know now how to watch this
i will continue reading the comments, that could save my day haha"
