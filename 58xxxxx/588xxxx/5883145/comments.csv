I didn't vote for Obama, and there are many reasons I feel he shouldn't be in office, but none of those reasons have ANYTHING to do with weather he was born in another country or if his father was a Muslim. He was raised by his mother who was NOT Muslim so he grew up in a Christian environment. YOU look up the facts.

My reasons are because he isn't doing a good job. 

Are you one of these Whacked Out Nut jobs that follows EVERY BS conspiracy theory??? If you don't like him in office, you live in a country where you have the right to VOTE!!!!!!  DO NOT VOTE for HIM!!!! If you spent your energy on a campaign against the re-election of Obama and pointing out REAL policies that were totally wrong instead of trying to force feed your insane ""theory's"" down peoples throat, you probably could help him loose his upcoming election. HE IS trying to get another 4 years. By using his bad policies, you can use the public record as your weapon. These are available for ANYONE to see. No need to try to come up with wacky conspiracy theory crap, there is enough bad decisions that can be easily proven and will ultimate have the same bottom line effect. Obama will not be in office ever again. As long as you continue down the path of conspiracy BS, you will be looked at as a Quack!"
,RC_Ebooks,2010-11-11T04:33Z,"I'm gonna give you youngsters a piece of advice on this topic based on my 50 yrs. on this stupid planet: DON'T TAKE THIS STUFF TOO SERIOUSLY! Back when I was a kid, Leonard Nimoy had a show on TV called ""In Search Of"". Well, one of my little classmates fell so IN LOVE with aliens. Bigfoot, ghosts, etc. that he taped the shows with his cassette recorder and proceeded to walk around Jr. high school, playing the damned episodes for everyone to hear... and in turn RUINED his social life for the rest of his school career. These people selling this SHIT: George Noorey, Daniken, etc. are NOT doing it for free and it is all speculation. They may be the very idiots in high school walking around with the cassette player of this crap and EVERY generation repeats this game over and over. There is NEVER AN ANSWER, only more books... overpriced videos and wacky sponsors for their shit. This GAME never changes and like religion.... bilks millions of people out of millions of bucks for nothing!

You've been WARNED, kids!"
