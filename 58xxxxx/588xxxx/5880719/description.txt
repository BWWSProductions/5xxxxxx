      The classic FabFilter sound

      With the introduction of FabFilter One in 2004, we set a new standard for 
      digital filters... and it still stands today. Now you can get that classic 
      FabFilter sound for a Micro price! With a single high-quality filter, 
      FabFilter Micro is the ultimate lightweight filter plug-in.    

      Tiny yet powerful

      FabFilter Micro's single filter is smooth and creamy, yet easily turns into 
      raw saturation and self-oscillation when tweaked using the interactive 
      filter display. It features low-pass and high-pass shapes and an envelope 
      follower to modulate the cut-off frequency.
     
      Saturation and distortion

      With the individual Input Gain and Output Gain parameters, you can fully 
      control the saturation of the internal filter, making FabFilter Micro not 
      only ideally suited for basic filtering tasks, but also capable of beautiful 
      distortion and analog saturation effects.

      FabFilter goodies

      Of course, you also get all the usual FabFilter goodies: perfectly tuned 
      knobs, MIDI Learn, Smart Parameter Interpolation for smooth parameter 
      transitions, extensive help with interactive help hints, AltiVec and SSE 
      optimization, and much more!

                   http://www.fabfilter.com/products/one.php 

  For FabFilter One, we have put tremendous effort in creating the best 
      cut-off filter ever. Our new design approach has resulted in the fattest 
      and smoothest self-oscillating digital filter you have ever heard. It has 
      been tuned carefully to achieve the character and warmth of a classic 
      analog synthesizer. FabFilter Oneâ€™s filter sounds raw but never cheap or 
      â€˜digitalâ€™, even at full resonance.

      The filter is fed by an equally high-quality solid-sounding oscillator, 
      developed from scratch to be completely aliasing-free. It features sawtooth, 
      triangle, and square wave forms with pulse width modulation.

      The oscillator and the filter can be modulated by the LFO and the EG. The 
      LFO offers triangle and square wave forms, with adjustable wave balance 
      so any wave form between sawtooth and triangle can be selected. The tempo 
      can be synchronized to the host. The EG has the usual ADSR knobs, but with 
      a perfectly fine-tuned feel. Also, it has an additional Hold setting that 
      extends the time keys are held down.

      
      What FabFilter One excels at is the attention to detail and fine-tuning 
      that is visible throughout the plug-in. For example, the portamento 
      feature doesn't just slide from one note to another, but uses a carefully 
      selected algorithm to make your playing more lively and give it just that 
      little extra bit of magic.

      Smart Parameter Interpolation handles changes to any of FabFilter One's 
      parameters, ensuring both responsiveness and smooth transitions. There 
      are no annoying digital clicks and zipper effects, and even MIDI controller 
      changes are handled perfectly smooth.

      Naturally, the FabFilter One plug-in handles all parameter changes at sample 
      accuracy and it can be used with arbitrary sample rates. All parameters are 
      fully automatable within your favorite host and via MIDI Learn. The included 
      help file describes all features of FabFilter One in detail, together with 
      overviews and tutorials to create various types of sounds.

      Ultra-flexible side-chain routings

      Apart from its beautiful sound and character, you also get very flexible 
      routing. In Expert mode, external side chain input is available and you can 
      choose between mono, stereo, or mid/side processing with completely 
      customizable channel linking and routing.

      Especially suitable for live performance, FabFilter Simplon is a simplified 
      version of FabFilter Volcano 2  with two independent multimode filters 
      providing low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass responses with 12/24/48 dB/
      octave slopes. The filters can be used in serial or parallel mode.

      Originally developed for FabFilter One, Simplon's filters were designed 
      from the ground up to be the fattest and smoothest self-oscillating digital 
      filters possible. Simplon's filters sound raw but never cheap or â€˜digitalâ€™, 
      even at full resonance.

      Each filter offers three different filter characteristics that define the 
      unique sound and overdrive of the filter. They range from smooth filters 
      with moderate overdrive to raw, self-oscillating over-the-top madness!

      In combination with the response and slope settings, FabFilter Simplon 
      offers up to 27 different filter types.

      Tweak the filters with Simplon's large interactive filter display that 
      shows both filter curves and lets you drag them around. You can adjust 
      the filters separately or both at the same time.

      And of course, you get all the usual FabFilter goodies: perfectly fine-tuned 
      knobs that work both in vertical and circular drag modes, interactive MIDI 
      Learn, Smart Parameter Interpolation for smooth parameter transitions, great 
      presets, extensive help file with interactive help hints, sample accurate 
      automation for all parameters, AltiVec and SSE optimization, and much more.
