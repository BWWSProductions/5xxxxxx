,gaaraisgod,2010-10-17T05:37Z,"Thanks for this one man :)

I'm kind falling behind on my movie quota for the because I've been getting better quality for my favorites like Alien and DiAMOND's 700MB rip was just too big for me at the moment.

It would be so cool if you, HR, RiddlerA and Off.On.Off could coordinate your releases. We could get so much more content covered that way... Just a thought"
