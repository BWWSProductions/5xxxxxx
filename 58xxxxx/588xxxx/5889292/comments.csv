I'm new at this and have seven days now course I work now with the trail version."
[T],trialanderror,2010-12-05T09:09Z,"@Lanoe:
After installation, just copy the MusicMaker.exe over to the installation directory (typically C:\Program Files\MAGIX\Music_Maker_17_Download-Version)
and replace the existing file."
