    The giant squid was long thought to be the stuff of        
    legend. It was only in the late 19th century that it      
    was first officially recorded by scientists, after one   
    leviathan squid washed up on a beach in New Zealand.      
    Related to slugs and snails, this monster from the deep    
    along with its cousin the colossal squid, is the          
    largest invertebrate in the world. It has never been     
    filmed in its natural habitat hundreds of metres down,    
    but occasionally specimens are brought to the surface      
    by deep-sea trawlers.                                     
                                                             
    Joy Reidenberg and Mark Evans fly out to New Zealand to   
    join a team of experts and dissect a rare specimen of a    
    giant squid and a bizarre octopus that inhabits the       
    'midnight zone' over a kilometre deep, where there is    
    no light at all.                                          
    From the moment they set eyes on these cephalopods, the    
    dissection team is fascinated by the alien anatomy of     
    these strange cousins.                                   
                                                              
    The team discover that the giant squid has teeth on its    
    tentacles and tongue, a throat that dives through the     
    middle of its brain, and three hearts that power blue    
    blood through a muscle-filled jet-propulsion cloak.       
    They investigate how octopus and squid are masters of      
    disguise and survive underwater warfare using             
    camouflage, ink jets and spectacular light shows.        
                                                              
    They piece together the puzzle of how the giant squid      
    hunts, how it jets through the water, how its             
    quick-fire beak pulverises food and why it has such      
    enormous eyes. They also discover the brutal truth        
    about giant squid sex.
