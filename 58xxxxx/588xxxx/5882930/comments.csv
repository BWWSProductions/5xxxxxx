But how come most of the wii files are like in little seperate folders all over like this one.
Arte there some steps that i must make to combine them or something? "

Simply select the first numbered .rar file of the series and select to unpack. 
It will then re-assemble the contained file, which in this cse will be the game disc .iso file ready for burning etc. 

You can use a program like WinRAR, WinZIP, 7zip etc to unpack the files. "
