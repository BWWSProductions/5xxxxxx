,trojani1982,2010-11-05T12:43Z,thank you it works fine
,celulose,2010-11-08T09:14Z,I used this program to learn to type the normal way. I always just pecked the keys really fast and i always had to look at the key bored. Now i'm typing slower but I know once I get good ill be able to type way better then I could before. Plus now I can type without looking. This program rocks.
,Quantumenergy,2010-11-10T22:19Z,"Read me says: 
""5. Right Click on file ""tmaster8.net"" and go to properties and apply attribute ""Read Only""
But there is no tmaster8.net!
So, it goes back to Trial Version every second time I start the program.
Sad story."
,Quantumenergy,2010-11-10T22:32Z,"Ops, just found tmaster8.net!
ItÂ´s in ""ProgramData"" and not in ""Program"" in Swedish W7
Now lets see...
:) ?"
,Bang_2009,2010-11-12T13:33Z,"For those people who can't find ""tmaster8.net"" there reason for that .I found out why you can't find it.Ok .the reason is because you are might use different windows on your PC .like windows XP or ....""tmaster8.net"" It's shows in different name's like this ""tmaster.exe.m anifest""Close the program and go to my computer C:/Program Files/TypingMaster

Right Click on file ""tmaster8.net"" or ""tmaster.exe.m anifest"" and go to properties and apply attribute ""Read Only""

Then you can enable network adapters / internet connection. I just found out when you done all this ""tmaster8.net"" going to be visible for after that."

thanks to''Bang-2009''"
,Peekajinx,2011-01-11T16:37Z,"I installed this yesterday and followed the directions by shutting off my internet before putting in the key. Then I found the file called tmaster.exe.manifest and applied Read-Only to it. I then turned my internet back on and opened the program. This seemed to work fine last night, but when I opened the program this morning it went back to the trial version. Any suggestions?"

,halfacluemaybe,2011-08-26T20:56Z,Thanks for the upload!
,DarthDerp,2011-10-01T05:46Z,"Okay, here we go...

1) Disable your internets

2) Install the program

3) Launch program and enter license

4) Close program

5) Set windows folders to ""Show Hidden Files and Folders""; to do this is slightly different  on XP and Vista/7. Google it if you don't know how to do it.

6) Computer > C: > Program Data > tmaster8.net (it's hidden in this directory). Right-click, hit properties and set the file to ""read-only""

7) Just to be safe, firewall block all the .exe's in the typing program folder.  Excluding the uninstaller, I counted six of them. 

After trying to get my lazy ass to touch type for years, this bare bones program finally got me to do it, so it works if you do a lesson a night for about a month. Thanks for the torrent pardeep333."
