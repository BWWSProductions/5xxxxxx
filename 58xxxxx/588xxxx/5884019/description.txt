George Friedman - America\'s Secret War: Inside The Hidden Worldwide Struggle Between America and Its Enemies (2004) Audio Book



Dubbed by Barron\'s as \"The Shadow CIA\", Stratfor, George Friedman\'s global intelligence company, has provided analysis to Fortune 500 companies, news outlets, and even the U.S. government. Now Friedman delivers the geopolitical story that the mainstream media has been unable to uncover, the startling truth behind America\'s foreign policy and war effort in Afghanistan, Iraq, and beyond.

Stratfor, one of the world\'s most respected private global intelligence firms, has an unmatched ability to provide clear perspective on the current geopolitical map. In America\'s Secret War, George Friedman identifies the United States\' most dangerous enemies, delves into presidential strategies of the last quarter century, and reveals the real reasons behind the attack of September 11, and the Bush administration\'s motivation for the war in Iraq. It describes in eye-opening detail America\'s covert and overt efforts in the global war against terrorism: Not only are U.S. armies in combat on every continent but also, since September 11, the intelligence services of dozens of nations have been operating in close partnership with the CIA.

America\'s Secret War is an unprecedented look at the new world war being waged behind the scenes today. It is sure to stir debate and capture headlines around the world.
