[T],jonnoel1,2010-10-14T09:07Z,"well if youre gonna upload it, at least let it seed, otherwise its just a dead useless torrent."
[T],jonnoel1,2010-10-14T09:27Z,"BTW.....thanks for seeding it too, I appreciate it, and I'm going to talk to the site mods to request that you get a trusted user (pink) skull by your name since you have good uploads. You may want to reseed any torrents that have fallen inactive so they dont decline you. Good luck....thanks again."
