The story involves a group of Western expatriates catching wild animals in Africa and selling them to zoos, led by Sean Mercer (John Wayne).

At the outset, Little Wolf (Bruce Cabot), aka "The Indian," is injured during a rhinoceros chase. He is rushed to the hospital at Arusha, where he needs a blood transfusion. None of the team can provide the required rare blood type, but a young Frenchman, Charles "Chips" Maury (Gerard Blain) can. Chips is hired as a replacement for The Indian as the international group tries to fill all its animal orders for the season.

A wildlife photographer, Anna Maria D'Allesandro (Elsa Martinelli), arrives to take photos of the animals caught by Mercer's men for a zoo that will be buying the bulk of that season's captures. She is at first mistaken for a man because of the introduction letter she'd signed with only her initials. She soon acquires the nickname "Dallas."

During her stay, Dallas also becomes known as Mama Tembo (Mother of Elephants) for her efforts to save three baby elephants, culminating in a chase through the streets of Arusha in Tanzania. She also develops a crush on Mercer. There are romantic subplots between the other characters as well.
