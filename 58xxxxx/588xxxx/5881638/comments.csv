Then I thought that SI had something to do with it so I tried disabling it in the data files, yet the problem still occurs. I'm running vista 32-bit with a gtx 460. i've also tried compatability mode for xp.

just to make sure i didn't do anything incorrectly:

1. I mounted the iso with poweriso, installed oblivion
2. mounted the SI iso and installed it, followed by the update.
3. Then I copied the crack to the game directory, and installed mods afterwards.

any ideas on a fix?"

it is oblivion + all the expansions... which give you the same content as GOTY Deluxe, but isn't actually the GOTY Deluxe

,MrTTAO,2011-01-14T20:55Z,"actually, upon further inspection it is NOT even all the content of the GOTY Deluxe. It is all the content of GOTY... what is the difference between GOTY and GOTY deluxe? the deluxe version comes with ""Fighter's Stronghold"" update as well. This doesn't."
,MrTTAO,2011-01-15T01:55Z,"After a long search (downloading every single version of oblivion on TPB) I finally found a real GOTY edition... it was literally the last one I tried, one with the fewest seeds... I quickly discovered why... It turns out that bethusda put securom DRM on the setup.exe files such that INSTALLING the game requires the original CD inserted (or a cracked setup.exe, available seperately from reloaded and a PITA to incorprate)... and even UNINSTALLING requires the original CD (turns out a lot of frustrated people who has stopped playing years ago, came to uninstall, couldn't find their CD, and now can't uninstall it)... I was hoping to save installs (12 seperate installs total!) but its just not worth it. Might as well stick with the 12 install method...
This version gets commended for including a patch and a crack for that patch. Best way to get all oblivion is to download THIS version followed by downloading the ""Fighter's Stronghold"" DLC separately."

This is how you fix it. It took me freaking ages to find out how, but it's pretty simple.
First, mount the second disc, the one with SI on it.
Now try and install the update. If it works, you're all good my friend.
If you get that ""Old file not found"" thing, then don't worry, I got you covered.
Just click Install Shivering Isles instead, that includes the patch that fixes the purple ground.
That's how I fixed mine.

Mounting is a term when you use a program like Daemon Tools Lite to mount a disc image like the one you will get in this torrent as a normal disc. Then, it acts pretty much as if you inserted a real disc, letting you install it and everything.
I gotta say though, if you don't know what mounting is you should probably read up a bit more before trying to install this kind of program. It can get really confusing, even to those with experience."

STEP 2-AFTER ITS DONE DOWNLOADING OPEN THE THING TO SEE THE FILES
STEP 3-OPEN ""DAEMON TOOLS LITE"" DOWNLOAD IT IF YOU HAVE TO
STEP 4-MOUNT IMAGE BY DRAGGING ""The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion+Expansions\Oblivion.iso
STEP 5-CLICK ON ""AUTORUN"" OR GO INTO THE FILES IF IT DOESNT WORK AND CLICK ON ""INSTALL""
STEP 6-INSTALL BY GOING THROUGH ALL THE STUFF AND SAVE IT TO YOUR DESKTOP (WHEN INSTALLING IT MAY TAKE A WHILE SINCE ITS A BIG GAME)
STEP 7-IF YOU WANT THE EXPANSIONS DO THE SAME THING WITH THE OTHER FILE FROM UTORRENT AND INSTALL THOSE BUT ONLY AFTER OBLIVION IS INSTALLED AND WORKS
STEP 8- SET SETTINGS TO THE LOWEST AS POSSIBLE VERY IMPORTANT COS THE SCREEN WILL BE MESSED UP IN THE STARTING CELL AND SEWERS
STEP 9-AFTER YOU EXIT THE SEWERS AND GET OUTSIDE THEN YOU CAN CHANGE THE SETTINGS LIKE SCREEN RESOLUTION
STEP 10-NOW THAT YOUR OUT OF THE SEWERS YOU CAN NOW INSTALL THE EXPANSIONS BY DOING STEP 2-6 BUT WITH THE EXPANSIONS FILE WHICH SAYS SI_KOTN.iso instead of Oblivion.iso
STEP 11-INSTALL THEM GOING THROUGH THE STEPS 
STEP 12- PLAY THE GAME FROM THE DESKTOP IMAGE
STEP 13-HAVE FUN!!!!!! 0h and dont delete the game from daemon tools lite, if it says please insert the disk mount the game again (you dont have to install again or install the expansions again) run autoplay and it will take you to the game"

,Seno941,2012-02-23T13:41Z,"brilliant download ive downloaded it before on my old computer, love it, keep up the good work .BONE. !!"
,NakanoSan,2012-02-25T20:11Z,"If you are crashing, disable SLI if you're running an SLI system. It's known to crash Oblivion a lot."
,Jamcamz1,2012-03-04T21:46Z,"I keep on getting told to ""Insert the disc"" can somebody please help me out?"
,ghost1773,2012-03-12T17:21Z,"Well I cannot get this version to work.  I have the same problem many other commenters complain about; when I start the game it immediately crashes - ""Oblivion has stopped responding...""

I am new to torrents and daemon tools, but it all seems pretty self explanatory, so I'm not sure if it is operator error, missing files in the torrent, or some unique ctd on startup with Oblivion.  

I realize many here have had total success with this torrent, so I am open to any help you may be able to offer.

I am using XP"
,CoreySaw,2012-03-15T10:48Z,"It works for me except for one thing, there's no graphics cutseens work just not the acual game graphics please if someone has experienced problems as I have and have found oout how to fix it your knowledge on the subject would be much appreciated, thank you."
,lozada1991,2012-03-17T18:40Z,"shit, first 3 days it's fast. Now it's getting slow, don't give up on seeding man. At least let me finish my download."
,sasunaru123,2012-03-23T06:32Z,ok so im kinda having trouble with the shivering isles install it always stops at the textures any ideas on whats going on or should i just wait it out?
,FuRrY321,2012-04-07T19:52Z,"Okay, way too many comments so I'm not going to go searching through all them for help.
Basically, the opening cutscene is messed up. The top quarter of the screen is normal, the left-hand part below that lags, and the right side is completely stuck on the first frame when the Emperor is talking (ie torso shrouded in darkness).
Everything below that is blackness. Since the opening cutscene is pretty long - and significant - and I believe this will also affect all other cutscenes, can anyone help?"
,FuRrY321,2012-04-07T19:53Z,"Basically, my problem is the complete opposite of the problems others have been having. Graphics are fine, when I skip the broken cutscene with ""Esc"" the character creation screen shows up fine, I can see my character."
,Afyrius,2012-04-18T18:38Z,Thnaks a lot friend! Great uploading
,shaunmcca92,2012-04-20T17:02Z,I realy enjoy using this torrent ^^ i hope my 11 hours of non stop seeding helped =) also if you got a knights of the nine torrent I'd realy enjoy using it 
,Heszelb01,2012-04-22T11:37Z,"WOW Thank You For This Game ! Took About A 
Hour  And It Works Awesome !!! 

 = Heszelb01 ="
,heartofcrimson,2012-04-24T05:00Z,Spectrumfade. You commented the solution to the purple ground over a year ago. I just want you to know you did help one poor bastard. Thank you.
,heartofcrimson,2012-04-24T05:08Z,"Also, for any of you having the issue where you can load the menu, but not create a new game, you have to mount the second (shivering isles) disk, explore the disk, open the ""crack"" folder, and copy the oblivion file inside to the game directory. There should be in the game directory a non-cracked version of the same thing, so you will need to verify that you want to replace that file with the cracked version and such, but then the game should work. At least it did for me."
,caseyloveswow1989,2012-04-24T14:39Z,SOMEONE PLEASE REPIELY LOL ok im downloading right now just wondering if this is a ios burn image files and if so can i just winrare it because thats usaually what i do cause of the fact i dont have a burnin on my laptop please anwser i love u long time ;D

,Stock3rz,2012-04-28T02:40Z,I think the reason it is crashing is because steam is open exit steam and it should work
,AcidLion,2012-05-06T23:56Z,"@caseyloveswow1989 -
get mounting software. namely daemon tools. its rather self explanatory and makes things 100% easier."
,TheOne567,2012-05-11T04:15Z,"Personally, there should be a torrent release of this game with the Oldlivion add on for anyone who has a crappy computer but wants to rock some Elder Scrolls"
,DUDE1404,2012-05-13T12:10Z,"Installation of Shivering Islands stuck on the beginning! I've tried to retry the installation, always with the same effect. Please, help. It pisses me off!!! Any advice? I did everything as instructed!"
,DUDE1404,2012-05-13T12:13Z,"Nvm, it finally worked out after MANY retries. Thx to the game uploader for this brilliant game!"
,bearclaw01234,2012-05-19T23:10Z,"the game installs good, the main menu loads, & the New Game Cinematic loads & looks great but when ye actually start the game it is nothing but a black screen!  this blows for spending 18 hrs to download & then not even be able to play it!"

,wallpoppy,2012-05-31T01:52Z,"I'm not running on the best of specs but the game works fine for me - no lags, few crashes. I did get stuck during charac customization or while getting out of the sewers when I upped the resolution. Maybe try adjusting settings to the lowest (temporarily) for the game to run smoothly in the beginning"
,jsanarde,2012-06-08T21:46Z,WoW everything ok except for a bug i found sorry
,hasnota,2012-06-11T01:09Z,"The game works perfectly for me until i enter Kvatch. it just closes. i can do as many side quests as i want. i already did the Dark Brotherhood ones. but when i entre Kvatch to give Martin the Amulet the game is unresponsive.
