,manslut,2010-10-14T06:55Z,any possibility of a 272p version?
,dragonballz,2010-10-14T08:33Z,"We want 70MB version!!
Nowadays there is scarcity of speed/bandwidth(culprit - recession). It will take atleast 2hours to download 175mb."
,rain22,2010-10-14T09:08Z,"Um for your information, dragonballz, mine downloaded in five minutes. Get over yourself."
,WolfAttackFromSpace,2010-10-14T09:18Z,"Speak for yourself. This quality is fine.

How is the economy affecting your bandwith?

Maybe get a better provider...I pay like forty bucks a month and there's definitely not a limit.


So, again, how is bandwith ""scarce"" ?

"
,WolfAttackFromSpace,2010-10-14T09:49Z,"@ rain22


Seriously. I don't even have the fastest internet that Cox offers and this will still take like only 15 min.

2 hours  is nonsense."
,dragonballz,2010-10-14T10:13Z,"@WolfAttackedFromSpace: I am speaking for myself only, not for you.
256kbps = approx 30kBps. Do the maths. Comes to 100mins (approx 2hrs).

,WolfAttackFromSpace,2010-10-14T10:42Z,"@ dragonballz 

99% of people have a better connection than you.

Maybe torrents aren't for you until you can upgrade to a respectable connection.

30kbps? rofl."
,dragonballz,2010-10-14T11:12Z,And my connection costs 20 dollars with 8gb limit !!
,BudShiz,2010-10-14T12:35Z,"@dragonballz
just stfu and get a better connection. You think the other 99% will cut back on quality (this isnt even 720p, its TV-Resolution) just so you can DL faster? I didn't mean to harass you, but for your own good, change your isp asap. "
[T],vortex77,2010-10-14T15:00Z,Got it in 5min flat @ 580 kB/s thanks!!
,Wheezy,2010-10-14T15:04Z,Thanks EZ great upload as always! we get south park close to a year late so your a saviour. I get your torrents every week!
,Meriksi,2010-10-14T16:31Z,"@dragonballz

,Harm133,2010-10-14T18:41Z,"Will seed till 15.0 :)

TY :D"
,Wheezy,2010-10-14T19:02Z,"I assume dragonball is using a mobile broadband connection or is tethering some mobile device, which is why he has crap speed. But dude were not going to suffer just for you. 5k plus people have d/l this just fine, look for your file and don't bitch if you cant find what you want."
,Blunter420,2010-10-14T22:55Z,"I decided to join piratebay today after years of reading idiotic comments. Dragonballz, who are you? Nobody wants to hear your complaints about your shitty ISP just downloaded this is 5 mins at about 1mb per second. "
,GetGood,2010-10-15T08:36Z,"Don't bitch about free stuff, inconsiderate mother fuckers...... Eztv is quality and the speed would only take 2 hours for you if you are a dumbass and don't know how to open your ports in which case you should not be talking shit in the first place. Qualities great EzTv ""THANK YOU' for your hard work. "
,dragonballz,2010-10-15T10:05Z,"@GetGood: Are you blind? or drunk? Cant you read that my speed is 256kbps (32kBps)?

Its people like you and Blunter420 who are inconsiderate, not people like me. Geez Dumbfucks. Get a dictionary retards.

Thanks eztv and 20-40."
,catalyst4chaos,2010-10-15T14:04Z,"nice one!! and too the guy who said it takes 2hours to download, get a better  ISP only took 20mins! stump up some decent pennys and stop moaning!.... if you were that botherd you would upload yourself so quit bitching!!"

[T],nlx_78,2010-10-15T19:17Z,"Fun episode, thank you for the upload. Snooky @ Osama"
,2milehigh,2010-10-15T20:03Z,@dragonsballs maybe you should write to EZtv and ask them to upload a personal file just for you.  I'm sure they will be MORE then happy to accommodate your needs.  People are trying to help out on here and your dissing them.  Your the tool.  Maybe you should have a little more consideration for the people that are helping you.  70mb isn't what EVERYONE wants.  OR watch it on tv.  
,2milehigh,2010-10-15T20:04Z,@dragonsballs PS the recession is over... just so you know.  
,jolletheman,2010-10-16T01:26Z,"Thx, download took 4mins 3secs (:"

,Rus,2010-10-16T08:58Z,"Bro, just cause you live in a poor country it doesnt mean the rest of the world wants low quality."
,duncan26,2010-10-16T15:59Z,"@dragonball

,tricycle515,2010-10-16T16:36Z,"dragonballzslap is stuck in the year 1992,
with a 14.4 phone modem, and is saving
up for a 512 MB hard drive.

,mrcameli,2010-10-17T12:26Z,Under a minute :P
,StayWay,2010-10-17T22:02Z,"@kapslocks
Depends of a wide range of stuff. Peers, location(seeders/peers), active seeders, ports, uploading/downloading speed, caps...

It's fine to download it in 8 minutes though.

Download pretty fast, 2 mins."
,Luzzu,2010-10-17T22:24Z,"2milehigh; the recession is over? ... really? You do realize that we're currently in the worst economic downturn since the great depression, right? - but I guess in a way the recession is over, it is now a fucking depression. You're nonetheless a retard.

And dragonball is obviously a troll. 70mb episode? Really?"
,Down_Loda,2010-10-19T18:10Z,It's A Jersey Thing :)
,darkgnome,2010-10-19T22:39Z,2 hours? What 3rd world country do you live in? o.o Took me 2 minutes and that's even slow :D
,scud830,2010-10-19T23:53Z,Mine goes slow because my school throttles torrents.  It's faster to download it remotely from a home computer and transfer it to my current location.
,jpl86,2010-10-24T19:51Z,"downloaded in about 5 mins, thx XD"
