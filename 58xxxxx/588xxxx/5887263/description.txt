The 88 is a four-piece indie rock band based in Los Angeles, California. They have released four albums, and are known for their high energy live shows and appearances in popular culture and on television.

The band consists of Keith Slettedahl (vocals/guitar), Adam Merrin (piano/keys), Todd O'Keefe (bass guitar), and Anthony Zimmitti (drums).

By 2007, the 88 has become a four-piece with the departure of Brandon Jay, and Todd O'Keefe joined the band as Carlos Torres left to spend more time with his growing family. However, the new edition of the band remained as popular as ever, and in the spring of that year the group signed a recording contract with Island Records. In 2008 the label released their album Not Only... But Also featuring the single "Go Go Go".

Kind of Light was also featured as Radio & Records Ã¢â‚¬Å“Album of the WeekÃ¢â‚¬Â. The 88 became a staple on KCRWÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Morning Becomes Eclectic, a clearinghouse for rising indie rock outfits.

The band released their second album entitled Over and Over in September 2005 and have been playing practically nonstop with tour dates throughout the United States and Canada including opening slots with 311, The Smashing Pumpkins, The B-52's, Elliott Smith, Matt Costa, Guster, Flaming Lips, and more.

Today the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TV resume includes segments on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Last Call with Carson Daly, MTV News, Extra, and they appeared in a performance on the sitcom How I Met Your Mother.
