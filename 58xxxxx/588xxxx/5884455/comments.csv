,stinky1,2010-10-15T05:59Z,I'm getting the same.
,zmajcekBo,2010-10-15T11:47Z,"I don't get no error, but downloading is at 33.7% for some time now and no peer has more. Should I change my tracker or something, are conditions better somewhere else?"
,LST99,2010-10-15T12:05Z,all stuck at 33.7%. Seed please!
,Pierluca72,2010-10-15T18:27Z,same here... stuck at 33.7%
,zmajcekBo,2010-10-16T14:58Z,"The most seeded peer raised to 73.6 today, that looks promising."
,Pierluca72,2010-10-17T17:43Z,it's working fine now.

,zmajcekBo,2010-10-22T23:43Z,"Thank you, the rip is very enjoying. And I also found the film somehow rewarding. To me it seemed a bit tedious and somewhat uneventful at first, but I think it says more than that. Some quite powerful things in it, regarding this woman who is working on her escape from the social circle. Featuring interesting camera, beautiful cinematography overall. Though I've been thinking, is Tilda dubbed here, is she??"
