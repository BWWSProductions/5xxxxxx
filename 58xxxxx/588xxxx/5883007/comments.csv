Other torrent-programs offer very similar step."
,jrgray6,2010-10-13T14:22Z,130MB for each file seems really small...?
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-13T14:56Z,"137 MB is 272p version.
162 MB is 480p version.

Which version one would download is matter of choice and playback platform (explained in Description).

I suggest you to gently fuck off. "
,ninedproof3,2010-10-13T17:03Z,"you rock man, stupid dish  network got rid of fx last week, in the middle of season! something bout fox network wanted to raise rates 50%"
,jrgray6,2010-10-13T17:14Z,I bet you're really fat.
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-13T17:34Z,Minus MORON was here. ROFL.
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-13T17:40Z,"@jrgray6:...""seems really small...?""
Sorry, I can't help you with that.
Fucking surgery is probably  what you need.
It may sort out minor ""problems"" you have."
,dontbrude,2010-10-13T17:42Z,"I have been on PB for a couple years and never felt like joining until now because I had to comment and say YOU ROCK!!! I greatly appreaciate your time I am a Dish Network customer and as you know they canceled Fox, I was soooo PISSSED iI almost ditched em as my statelite provider! anyway this is my FAVORITE tv series...thanks for the PERFECT uploads!!

P.S. TO: jrgray6...grow-up"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-13T17:54Z,"@dontbrude: Millions (literary) SoA fans downloaded my encodings.  From first season episode one. Bunch of them followed me from mininova.

So, thanks for your  thanks, as first. And - idiots which crawl out of the woodwork every now and then drive me mad with their sheer, unprovoked, undeserved spreading of verbal diarrhea."
,CrystalWitch,2010-10-13T19:45Z,"Thank you once again, for so many reasons, my hero!! Great idea to have both formats under one umbrella - I'm not sure how much of your time it saves, but it seems like it should save some (but what do I know?!! You, of all people, tf know how IT challenged I am!). Will seed madly - h&rs take note and stop being so bloody selfish. Bastards. Until next time, mon ami. Merci. :) "
,HeyHoldThis,2010-10-13T20:07Z,Thank you for taking time out of your day to upload these SoA episodes twentyforty. You are making alot of pissed off people VERY happy. You freakin' rock!!
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-13T21:03Z,"@CrystalW: I kept iPod version for old times sake (and because of your kindness).  Ones who need computer/PS3 version can choose 480p one.
Regarding the time - like encoding two different titles, instead of one... but I do save one upload slot on paid server - 1 torrent use 1 slot - two separate torrents would use two slots - and two slots is what I have. It saves time to ones who wait for torrents of other TV shows."
,JacquieSo,2010-10-13T21:16Z,"Hey Twentyfory,
I joined TPB just to comment on your work...
You do such an amazing job on everything you do, you have the quickest downloads and they are fantastic quality!!! Keep doing what your doing and I will continue downloading and seeding."
