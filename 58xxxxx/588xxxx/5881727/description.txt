L.L. Cool J - Mama Said Knock You Out [promo].VOB



HQ promo music video. "Mama Said Knock You Out" is a hit single by LL Cool J from his album of the same name. The song's famous beginning is "Don't call it a comeback / I've been here for years." Before "Mama Said Knock You Out" was released, many people felt that LL Cool J's career was waning; hisgrandmother, who still believed in his talent, told him to "knock out" all the critics. 

This music video features LL Cool J in a boxing ring, rapping into a microphone similar to the one an announcer would use in a boxing match. Frequently we see shots of him working out and scenes of a boxer being punched out. At the end of the video, his grandmother says "Todd! Todd! Get upstairs and take out that garbage".
