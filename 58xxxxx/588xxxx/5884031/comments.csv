,Redundantos,2010-10-13T22:03Z,Two 6-channel audio tracks? What for?
,phipp01,2010-10-13T23:52Z,@sopiebaba At 3.31 gigs there is no way this is a Blu-Ray rip. Most are over 4.4 gigs
,tavery80,2010-10-14T01:09Z,"It could easily be a legit BR rip...it's only a 3k vbr rip, whereas many are 5k and up."

,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-10-19T18:27Z,"If you look at a torrent and it has no screenshots ( for porn) or a link to boxcover/official info about the file ( for films or tvseries etc) first search thepiratebay often someone else has uploaded the same file & bothered to include screenshots or google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia and then  copy and paste links to the info you find to help everyone else out who dont know what the file is , please dont be as disgustingly lazy as 99.9% of tpb users and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself it only takes a few seconds per file ( once youve found the info) ,the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now please. see http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/10/01/coica-bill-postponed-its-time-to-discuss-alternatives-to-traditional-dns/
Also keep seeding dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets you upload the faster your upload speed the faster you download speed is for recieving data thats how bittorent works !
im not a hypocrite sometimes when i go to post info tpb says database error failed to write..i dont have time to remember to go back to the files i couldnt help out on..so if u spot files needing info please help out. ps if you look at porn remember to respect women theyre gods greatest creation.

,AMoveFan,2010-10-21T00:50Z,And as I progress through this upload more & more I start seeing a little blue dot at the sceene with Danny Trejo and Michelle Rodrigouz u downloaders look for that dot if you decide to download this still and tell me i'm not seeing things lol otherwise still very watchable I can also see pixles flashing in the backround unlike the larger size files 4gb or more they are picture perfect.
,AMoveFan,2010-10-21T01:48Z,O and it's the sceen where they start out on the bed and after the Danny and Michelle bed sceen it pops up every now and then can someone tell me if this is an accedent by the uploader  as he or she was uploading this movie or what it really is from ? Thanks And nice upload except for the little blue dot i'm seeing every now and then.
,AMoveFan,2010-10-21T02:35Z,"Finished the movie, there was a few distractions in this upload unlike most blue ray rips like the blue dot I mentioned in my previous post and also 5 minutes before the movie ends a tv2leech appears it's like his trademark or something things like this are what I call distractions and anoying so fore that the video is a 4 the sound is still a 10."
,AMoveFan,2010-10-21T06:59Z,"zeitgeistmandvdrip you are a Retard it's the actual movie the uploader just put his trademark in the movie which is stupid nobody wants to see that, they just want the movie ."
