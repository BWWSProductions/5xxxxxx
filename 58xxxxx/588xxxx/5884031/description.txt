been set up. He barely survives the sniper's bullet, and is soon 
out for revenge on his former employers, with the reluctant 
assistance of his old friend Cheech Marin, who has become a 
priest and taken a vow of nonviolence. If you hire him to take 
out the bad guys, make sure the bad guys aren't you!
