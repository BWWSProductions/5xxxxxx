I'm dying to try this prog, so if someone can help me out with crack, serial and/or activation... welcome!!"
,qimo,2010-11-01T13:11Z,"nice_guy_eddie, unpack the rar file in the new folder & it will give you the installer and a folder named crack. inside the crack folder is the application file ""AVS Video Converter"". copy this file to the installed folder of AVS VC7 (path: c:/program files/AVS4YOU/AVS Video Converter) by paste & replace the existing file. Then open & enjoy. I just installed & used, everything is working 100%. BLACKTROY, you're the man. thanks."
