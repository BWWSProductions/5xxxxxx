After generously donating all the wealth accumulated by three generations of his family, Ramnagar-based Raja Vichitra Singh, faces humiliation at the hands of Thakur Gajendra Singh when he is unable to pay a dowry for his sister, Gauri. He does fulfill his promise by mortgaging his mansion, Raghupathi Bhavan, but the shock kills his wife, Lakshmi. Humiliated, with no one coming forward to help him, he leaves Ramnagar, along with his three children, Raja, Bajrang, and Vijaya; re-locates to Bombay, hoping to accumulate three Lakh Rupees so that he can get the Bhavan back as well as restore his honor. But fate has something else in store for Vichitra, now a Tonga driver, and his children, who end up working as a Coolies and laborers, and he may never be able to save even a fraction of the cost to get his mansion back.
