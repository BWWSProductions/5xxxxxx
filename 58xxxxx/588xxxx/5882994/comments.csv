,PhilLesh12,2010-10-13T03:52Z,"The broken upload seems to be happening once a week now.
"
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-13T03:53Z,"wow, jinx!  @ears90, as soon as I submitted my comment, I saw yours!

Yeah, it is happening once a week now, for at least the last 3 weeks."
,gared111,2010-10-13T04:43Z,Fucken' hell...Pirate Bay is down yet again?
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-13T04:53Z,"This isn't shut down due to the court case.  It hasn't ended yet.  It might be due to the fact that they are in court and can't fix a bad line of code or a hung server, but not by court action.

Besides, they really don't have a case.  There is no copyrighted material on any of their servers.  "
[V],phatwarez,2010-10-13T05:55Z,Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked one of the servers.
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-13T06:12Z,"@alienking,

I believe they have servers all over the place, much like how Google, and lots of other sites have multiple colocation agreements and racks in data centers disbursed around the world.

Hell, I work for media/publishing cos in DC, and I always have them buy racks or cages in at least two data centers, preferably in separate regions, just to ensure the best uptime and to avoid downtime because of a problem at an MAE or other ""hub"" or ""bottleneck""."
[V],DibyaTPB,2010-10-13T07:05Z,The thing is that TPB will never be down. Long live TPB hope u will be back soon.
