Massage Therapy


When a patient named Margaret McPherson is
admitted to Princeton Plainsboro after
suffering severe and uncontrollable
vomiting, House and the team make
unexpected discoveries about her identity
as they assess her symptoms. When the
symptoms donâ€™t improve, the team looks to
the patientâ€™s medical history to unearth
more about her past. Meanwhile, House
gives Chaseâ€™s new hire a cold welcome, and
a visit from Houseâ€™s massage therapist
forces House and Cuddy to confront the
reservations in their relationship.
