[T],FaMoUz,2010-10-14T07:59Z,@sexyjvs all that stuff waz removed so it could fit on a blank DVD.. if it waznt removed it would of been 7.5 GiB..
,sexyjvs,2010-10-14T12:52Z,"Still, let us choose what we want. Thank You."
[T],FaMoUz,2010-10-14T20:08Z,@trin02 thnkz 4 telling me that but im not defending him.. im jus sayin thatz probably y he removed all that stuff but i kno u were talking 2 BOW..
,omniasassy,2010-10-24T19:26Z,"Why BOW has to defend himself?If you don't like the release-find some better or just go get it from the store,but you have to spend some money on that,and here is totally free.Be more appreciative,because BOW whoever he is -is spending his free time here for you. And about the all language comments-keep it for yourself ,don't complain or go spend 20 bucks on the original DVD,I don't think some of you will do that. Just say Thank you because time is money and these people are not going to do this forever for you. And to the complainers- More appreciation people :) ,or the stores are wide open"
