For those of you patiently waiting for our full HD version (2GB)
We hope soon to be able to purchase an HD version at the store to
make a conversion for you at supreme resolution rates for the
nice, larger HDTV sets now in use. Nothing less will do!

For now:  

This video is a DivX 824 X 368 video resolution created using DivX Plus
from the divx website and 192 k audio from the ntsc dvd 

Its a more lovely and nicely sharp picture by the way, than any of our
previous versions in an avi format.

Victor Victoria is a most favorite of my movies personally in that I find
it does wonders for the spirit to have Julie Andrews and Robert Preston
repartee as they do in situations that certainly do serve as inspiration
to loftier attempts to articulate with clever wit, and with intelligence
that is as I say, in great sprit, certainly!

The "dinner at the ritz" scene is unforgettable and a "tour de force"
around the Hollywood sets when you consider their more recent exploits
at the box office, by comparison.

Julie Andrews shows a great spirit in her drive to keep her sensibilities
intact despite being in what is an impoverished state financially
at the moment in time.

We ask for your seeding support 
with thanks! Michael Rizzo Chessman

The xvid versions seem to have flopped as there seem to be few takers I note 
of our recently launched avi-recomp subtitled versions in this format.
(Avi-recomp only does xvids at present)
