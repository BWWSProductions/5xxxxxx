,hello40204,2010-10-16T15:53Z,"okay, here is the problem . you keep creating many video files of this movie, but after dl 2 movies and compare , you keep raising the resolution and keep the same bitrate , as you encode higher resolution with same bitrate , the video gets worse , more pixelation . camping too much res in a small video .
would be better , you create a higher resoltion with a much higher bitrate , even if the file is bigger , at least we will have a better quality movie . 
if you create those resolution files, i get you have already a 720p or better version of this movie .
i do not know which software you are using to encode, but please, just give us the real deal instead of all those videos that are so similar . thanks . "
,hello40204,2010-10-16T15:57Z,"also instead of those many video with subs on. a single video with multi-subbs srt would be even better . make sense to most of us , since it is possible . and easier to create  "
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2010-10-16T18:38Z,"Thanks for your comment. The original file had a 1533 bitrate although we thought it was lower when we looked at the recommended setting offered by DivX converter plus after it analysed it. The file size was 2GB mkv originally so it did have a higher bitrate and its from this original source that the conversion for this format was made. This was intended to provide a 1GB offering, we came in with 850k video and 192k audio. That is a lovely enough offering for almost anyone for normal needs. That said, we are sourcing a DVD with a high enough bitrate to do a more miraculous piece of work on real larger HD sets, while we await word on whether the studio will come out with a bluray source for us. The one we are sourcing is PAL content and we are in fact intending on giving you this with multisubs as we have them available. This is the longer NTSC version for those that do not have subtitles needs in order to enjoy them. We also intend on a secondary audio track offering as these are particularly popular with the French especially and Italian users equally. "
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2010-10-20T14:55Z,"This video file will require a disc player capable of of higher resolution indicated. It will display beautifully on your computer desktop or laptop, however it required DivX compatibility that allows for this HD range of resolution to play. We are working on a PAL version convert that will play on all  regular DivX players too, with multisub support. Until we have this movi available in 720p resolution, this is the closest we get to an HD offering in the interim. Thanks, Michael C. (We haven't yet done our German Xvid version of Victor Victoria or the Spanish version of the movie ""Rope"") - sorry to leave you folks to last, however we are trying to keep up with all there is to do in what we intend for our folks - and there is a great deal remaining yet! Thanks for your patience, all! We will also have an Xvid Victor Victoria that is far superior to what is now being seeded."
