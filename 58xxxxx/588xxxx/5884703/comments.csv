Installation instructions....

1. Burn/Mount .iso

2. Run the keygen contained in .iso and click Patch Host file (not needed if you already
did this step for my CS5 Master Collection Release).

3. Use the serial in the serial.txt or generate a serial with keygen and
register. When generating select Adobe Acrobat Pro Extended 9.x from list

4. Alternativly to step 2 you can manually add the following line to your host
file.

127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com

Note: Keygen (and/or opening host file) must be done in admin mode for Windows 7/Vista

Serial: 1380-1217-4372-7420-9891-0721"

be given the credit for the excellent work they did on the keygen."

I've seen ThankfulSeeder comment before and I can't tell if he's an antipiracy spammer or just incredibly stupid but it seems he shows up on almost every app worth downloading ranting about viruses and trojans. Eat a dick clown."

,happyguy88,2010-11-23T23:32Z,"
I have failed to install it successfully on my third or fourth attempt.  I am in need of some precious help.  The following steps were performed:

1) Dowloaded the Torrent
2) In the .iso folder -- Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro Extended -- Setup.exe
3) Then I used Notepad as an Administrator and went to C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\Etc\Hosts 
and added the following.
127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 ereg.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate.wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 3dns-3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 3dns-2.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns-2.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns-3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 ereg.wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate-sea.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 wwis-dubc1-vip60.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate-sjc0.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 wwis-dubc1-vip60.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 localhost

It got successfully saved.

4) After that I extracted the ""Serrieennumer"" and ""replaced"" the cracked AMTLibWrapper.DLL file in  C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat 9.0\AMTLibWrapper.DLL

5) Thereafter, I made sure my ""Windows Firewall"" was blocking the ""Adobe Updater"". 
Change Settings -- Exceptions -- No Check mark besides Adobe Updater

6) Double-clicked on the Adobe icon on Desktop

7) Next User Services Agreement.

8) Click ""I agree"".

9) Note: Adobe did not ask for a ""Serial Number here"".  I had installed it as a ""Trial Version"".

10) Now when Adobe opened -- Clicked Edit -- Preferences -- General Options -- ""Removed"" check for updates.

11) Acrobat is closing once a file has opened.

PLEASE HELP."

,blackscribe,2010-12-01T23:57Z,"Thanks, blaze69.  Great upload.  Thanks to all the seeders... Fast download!

I followed the instructions precisely and my installation went smoothly.  One note: I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit and I had to run the Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro in Windows XP SP2 compatibility mode in order for it to work properly.  Otherwise, no problems.

Also, I scanned the downloaded folder with ESET NOD32 Antivirus and it was clean.

Thanks again."

,fhaffar,2011-01-05T20:26Z,"Thanks Blaze69, downloaded, installed and working perfect, the only problem I have is with MS Office 2010 as an addin, it does not like it and keeps telling me to disable the PDFMOfficeAddin.dll so Office will work well, apart from that it is perfect, evein updating was not a problem"

,pirateredsto,2011-01-24T02:30Z,"For peeps who have had the:
""Can't click Accept button in Software licence Agreeement"" problem 

- best solution so far - worked 4 me in XP -  

1 - Run Control Panel/Users and create a new user (with Administrator rights).

2 - Logout and log in to new user

3 - run Acrobat V8/9 and click Accept inthe  licence agreement - it shld work.

4 - logout and log back in to main user

5 - run Acrobat V8/9 - reject Registration page - should all work now.

6 - run Control Panel / Users and delete new 
     user.
