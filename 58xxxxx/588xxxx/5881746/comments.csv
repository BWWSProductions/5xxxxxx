1. The Onion Movie (2008)
Seriously funny satire news channel on youtube.. somehow they made a movie... I dont think anyone could NOT like them...

2. Lost Boys 1(1987) n 2 ( The Tribe, 2008)
Story about vampire or something.. I'm just intrigued by it..

Can you please do it? "

[T],MitZep,2010-10-13T07:44Z,"hey there are very less seeds for this....
pls seed  "
[V],prashant22,2010-10-13T09:15Z,seeding now..
,wira020,2010-10-13T10:06Z,Thanks dude ( or dudette).. Looking forward to it!!
[V],prashant22,2010-10-13T10:40Z,u can call me dude...dudette!! no way...
[V],prashant22,2010-10-13T17:49Z,"i dont know may be the reason is popularity of 1337z...may be it is more known to people than kickasstorrents..
although my fav is tpb and ahashare.."
,wira020,2010-10-14T14:36Z,"hehe. ok dude.. its just that i cant really tell your sex from ur name.. not very familiar with indian (right?) names.. 

I think TPB became so unreliable nowadays that some uplaoder had to use other torrent site to upload.. I usually go to l337x.com for blackjesus rip.. he used to do 300-500mb dvdrips.. but now he only do 700mb++ dvdrip.. which I think is a waste of bandwidth for such tiny resolution... and ahashare looks like a good site.. seriously, its getting harder not to like that site.. I'm very loyal to TPB tho..  kickasstorrent on the other hand is a bit messy.. new UI is less cluttered but still messy... and they dont have any exclusive releases that'd force people to go download it from them.. this is my opinion tho.. not really an expert here.. hehe..

Btw, any of you guys experience super slow loading times at l337x?? I can browse tpb and ahashare fast... but some site l337x would slow down to a crawl...

p/s: Can u still do dvdrips of lost boys 2?  I'd understand if you want to keep your uploads at high res only.."
[V],prashant22,2010-10-14T18:49Z,"@wira020
right its an indian name...as i m an indian..
ok will see abt the dvdrip bt u'll hv to wait i hv many movies to upload this month..so may be next month..."
,tylr,2010-10-14T22:44Z,"hey.. hope my req. is still on the line...
