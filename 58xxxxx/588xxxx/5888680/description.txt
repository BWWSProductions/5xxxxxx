That's It , make your start button the way you want it to look when : 

1st: as normal - http://bayimg.com/iApKKaACN

2nd: when you pass mouse on it : http://bayimg.com/IaPklaaCN

3rd: when you click on the start button: http://bayimg.com/iapKmAAcN


Make sure you read the TXT FILE included as you cannot reverse the original start button (except of course if you know where to find it into c/.windows/folder )
