,supabeasty,2011-01-18T22:39Z,What exactly does copy over the cracked content mean?
,Blommieboi,2011-05-05T15:21Z,@supabeasty Copy over cracked content means that you copy over files from a folder from the cd to the installation folder and replace. 
,Whomerang,2011-08-01T15:21Z,How do you copy over the cracked application? It won't let me copy the application over and instead prompts me to send a shortcut to the desktop instead? What do?
,Jakarak,2011-08-06T02:14Z,"For those confused about the 'copy over cracked content':

1. Have the program WinRar
2. Open the iso. file you extracted first of all
3. It should come up with some bin. files and a CRACK folder
4. Extract the files in the CRACK folder to somewhere on your Desktop
5. Copy these files right into the Cities XL folder in Program files and states yes to replacing the old files.
6. Start from desktop and enjoy."
