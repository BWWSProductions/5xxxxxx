With Cities XL 2011, build and develop gigantic cities on realistic 3D maps,
thanks to an incredible collection counting more than 700 buildings and
unique structures. You are the virtual mayor and as such, you will need to
find the right balance between economic development for your city, public
transportation, housing, social services, leisure activities and even special
events in town. Realism has been pushed a little bit deeper with larger
cities, more realistic and more sophisticated than ever beforeWiden your
horizonCities XL 2011 pushes its limits further: hundreds of new buildings
and structures appear for a total of more than 700 constructions, leading the
way for new building and combinations options never seen before in a City
Builder. Many new maps are also available, for a total of 45 buildable maps
City management will offer the full experience thanks to the addition of
public transportation (subway, bus) which will decongest downtown traffic
while lowering pollution levels and increasing the population's satisfaction
A more elaborated tax system will let all apprentice mayors adjust personal
and local business taxes. A new commercial user interface will permit trade
between cities in single player mode if a player decides to develop several
cities. Thanks to these big novelties and to a lot of inspired improvements,
Cities XL 2011 truly reaches a whole new dimension to please all City
Builders fans
