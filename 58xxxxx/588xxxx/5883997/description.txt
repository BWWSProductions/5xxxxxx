R. Carlos Nakai-Canyon Trilogy, Vol. 5

R. Carlos Nakai is lauded in New Age circles for his ability to create enchanting mental images of tranquility and nature in repose. The flute compositions sound like the aural embodiment of Big Sky Western landscapes. With "Dreamscapes: Cleft in the Sky," he seems to revel in the inner stillness created by the drama of nature. Nakai also tries to connect with the past. In "Dawn's Mirage: Echoes of Time" and "Dawn's Mirage: Ancestral Vision," he summons old ghosts and strains to hear them sing once again.
