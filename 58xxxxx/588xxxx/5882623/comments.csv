thx again- I really hope you might have this show."

Ian Punnett is one of the best radio hosts in the business by the way.

born2bealive; Care to share your experience with that episode?

I am curious what was it you think you heard!

,mkmacabre,2010-10-20T04:59Z,"@ born2bealive: You might need to state the exact date for that particular show in order for it to be found ;)

@ joeblowman: Thankyou!"
,KungFuKane,2010-10-20T07:20Z,Do you have the Sept 24 2010 show hosted by Art Bell?

,-SPQR-,2010-10-24T01:58Z,"Ian Punnet is an asshole.
the worst guy ever on radio.
constantly mumbling, desperately looking for the right words for ages, think's he's smart but he's really blind, very annoying guy. they should dump him.

,ThaSilverSurfer,2010-10-28T10:50Z,"agree with SPOR, i HATE listening to ian and avoid his interviews. he comes across as a stuttering fan-boy who cant STFU. i heard 1 show where he rambled for 5 mins and then totally stole the guys thunder by revealing the climax of his research! if i ever see punnet i will kick him in the balls.

,KungFuKane,2010-10-30T04:03Z,Where do we go now for C2C AM?
,ThaSilverSurfer,2010-10-30T06:17Z,demonoid has the show and up to date. but you gotta have an invitation.
,KungFuKane,2010-11-01T08:48Z,Guess that ends my C2C listening for now since I do not have an account with the very tough to get one Demonoid.
