Thanks again!"

If you like it, I recommend you buy the real book. This amount of text is hard to read on screen, but having the ebook is great for searchability!"
[T],L_Hammond,2010-10-14T23:26Z,"tooticki. Yes, I believe you're absolutely right. The book is said to be very interesting but also as far from a daily paper comic strip as you get when it comes to information density :-)
Great tip about having the paperback for 'readability' and the scanned version for searchability."

Would you believe it, I found that one the week after I bought it! Well, as said, it's nice to have both  sometimes. ;-)"
,baseter,2011-02-06T22:49Z,I'm not sure about this good calories and bad calories. If you want to lose weight you have to eat less than you burn. I used this tool: http://www.calotor.com to figure out how many calories should i eat
,tooticki,2011-09-17T17:09Z,"Yeah? How much did you lose that way and more importantly, how long did you keep it off?

I dare say that almost every obese person have tried the conventional advise over and over again. Not many succeed in the long run.

Also remember that avoiding carbs for weight loss WAS the conventional wisdom not that many decades ago and it was the only way for diabetics to survive. Now they feed diabetics sugar and insuline. Constantly high levels of both insulin and glucose - what a recipe for a catastrophe. Sadly, we all know the victims.
