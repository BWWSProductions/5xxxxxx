,deftones69,2010-10-16T01:21Z,"ooo, regarding tv shows and with the day walker taking a break, any chance of uploading Dexter seasons 2-4? I see t.d.w was only able to upload season 1 before he was no longer able to be with us. 

Not sure if your even a fan of the show Dexter, If your not obviously disregard this request. No point in upping something you dont like. :)"
