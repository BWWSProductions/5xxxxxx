What should I do/ Wat did I do wrong?"
,mjeelman,2010-11-19T21:32Z,did you copy the crack file?

,thodoris5321,2011-04-11T14:51Z,when i opened the crack my AVG antivirus told me it was Trojan
,pockiies,2011-05-11T14:02Z,thodoris5321 is right. there's a virus in the crack folder. i downloaded another crack from another site and ran the game.. said it was missing some audio file though :/
,ripper564,2011-06-02T22:15Z,"game works fine. no problems found. as you no, cracks do appear as viruses so ignore it and trust it :) cheers man"
,Doompy,2011-07-02T00:37Z,"Works just fine as long as you follow these steps:

Make sure that you use one of the serial keys from the 'readme' file

Make sure that you copy the cracked content to SWAT4/Content/System BEFORE you start the game

That's all it really is that simple. And btw there's no real threat, this means; no trojan :)

,arulseth1998,2011-11-03T08:26Z,"Need some serious help.
I downloaded the game but I found the game to be in Russian language. Is there any way to change its language to English?
I am not being able to play this game as I don't even know a single letter of Russian.
Any help would be grateful."
,arulseth1998,2011-11-03T15:13Z,"Do not download this torrent. It is useless.
It is in Russian and it cannot be changed to English.
Instead download it from:

magnet:?xt=urn:btih:KXJ5TO4QKDS4HCAN57RNHJSOSU4MEIXM&dn=SWAT%204%20%2B%20The%20Stetchkov%20Syndicate%20%2B%20Original%20EXE&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.thepiratebay.org%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.thepiratebay.org%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80%2Fannounce&xl=1328949367

And it is also very fast.
My download speed is 200 kb/s"
