,lestatvvvvvv,2010-10-19T23:22Z,"why does it appear that most xbox games are PAL and have the info here in spanish or other languages .... I would DL and seed if I knew they would work here , but unless I am sure I don't want to waste time or damage my xbox....
also can anyone recommend away to put the games onto a disc to play them... I have tried dual layer disks but when I try to play them all I get is the xbox logo then it freezes"
