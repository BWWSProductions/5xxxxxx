15 years after co-founding Sleater-Kinney, riot grrrl Corin Tucker found herself playing a benefit show in Portland, OR, where she sprinkled several new songs into her solo set. After the show, Tucker -- whoâ€™d been on hiatus with Sleater-Kinney since 2006 -- decided to turn those new songs into an album. She took the material to Little Gold Book Studios in northeast Portland, where she began recording the 11-track record with help from percussionist Sara Lund (of Hungry Ghost) and Golden Bears members Seth Lorinczi and Julianna Bright. The resulting album, 1,000 Years, was released in 2010.
