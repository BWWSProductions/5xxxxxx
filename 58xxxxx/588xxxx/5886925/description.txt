With an absent father and a withdrawn and depressed mother, 17 year-old Ree Dolly keeps 
her family together in a dirt poor rural area. She's taken aback however when the local 
Sheriff tells her that her father put up their house as collateral for his bail and 
unless he shows up for his trial in a week's time, they will lose it all. She knows 
her father is involved in the local drug trade and manufactures crystal meth but 
anywhere she goes the message is the same: stay out of it and stop poking your 
nose in other people's business. She refuses to listen, even after her father's 
brother, Teardrop, tells her he's probably been killed. She pushes on, putting 
her own life in danger, for the sake of her family until the truth, or 
enough of it, is revealed.
