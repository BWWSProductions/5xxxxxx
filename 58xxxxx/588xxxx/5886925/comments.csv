,guarino2002,2010-10-15T18:59Z,The trailer does look really good. Thanks
,martin1841,2010-10-16T17:37Z,"Nice thx but can you use h264 codec in the future?
700mb in h264 is so much better than 700mb in XviD also mp4 instead of avi container.

So
700 mb movie encoded in h264 in MP4 container = WIN! :)"

,snowbirds,2010-10-23T10:43Z,"Anyone have anything useful to say, like A/V quality?

With extremezone it's important to report user experience, since you can't trust what he says about his uploads."
,chrome66,2010-10-24T05:07Z,"I had a strange thing happen on this DL. never happened to me on a torrent or p2p dl of any kind. Said there was a file open on one of the peers or trackers. Cant remember the exact message as I freaked out a bit when I saw the red ""warning"" prompt. Apparently it mustve been some fluke. It wasn;t my AV that prompted me but Bit Torrent. Never had any probs w/ extremezone  b4. In fact, his shit is always tight. Anyone know how he gets everything so tight at 700mb?  "
,chrome66,2010-10-24T05:09Z,BTW. why hasn't anyone upped Catfiish? That was a good movie. Almost as good as Inception IMO. Just different. But I'm partial to supernatural thrillers and suspense.
,tracerrnd,2010-10-24T06:59Z,"Excellent movie very well done.

Good rip, fucking attrocious film! I downloaded because it's been nominated for a couple of awards, but I think South Park said it best: ""Somethimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass."""

They are no different than when someone uses the word sambo, or nigger, and to prove my point i can not wait to see the narrow minded one sided responses this comment will get... On the download , thank you extremezone for the torrent."

,dlarrym1111,2011-05-21T03:49Z,"@:

        Please consider these (2) factors B4 you make any permanent changes in the formats you use. They are as follows:

(1) Its realistic to understand that MANY of the 5,080,409.00 REGISTERED users of TPB may not be able to afford or have access to the Newest or Newer video/audio formats. Some may NEVER be able to.

(2) IF, you do begin to upload in the NEWEST formats to provide the best quality (which is totally understandable). Will you be able and or willing to upload in BOTH the newest formats (h264 in .mkv or mp4 containers) AND in the now ""STANDARD"" or OLDER formats (DivX, XviD, .MOV in .avi containers)

I'm only speaking for the ""Great Silent Majority"" (the millions that do not post comments and Guests that cannot post comments) 

Thanks for the UPLOAD, perfect as usual!!"
,ideafla,2011-05-21T13:18Z,"@dlyrrym1111
This happening to be me first post although I have been with TPB for quite sometime. 
Suggestion/my inferences pertaining your concern about formats. 

There are quite a bit of light weight open source players/codecs which would do the playback irrespective of the formats. 
As mentioned by ""extremezone"" VLC player has it's own libraries and does not  depend on the libs of the OS. XviD, DivX,MKV,H.264,MP4 and couple of new formats which are are being alpha tested is supported by VLC. 

I have downloaded quite a few movies [rare ones] from TPB and I have come across comments about A/V sync issues/A/V quality complaints ... These can be resolved in real time with open source soft players, if the the user take time out to navigate the abundant features available in these players and understanding and resolving is not a rocket science.        

My post is data driven and I am a seasoned technologist in this domain. 

Great going TPB and Thanks for giving me the opportunity for my first post at TPB. Cheers from India .."
