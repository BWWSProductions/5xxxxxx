"Massage Therapy"

When a patient named Margaret McPherson is 
admitted to Princeton Plainsboro after 
suffering severe and uncontrollable 
vomiting, House and the team make 
unexpected discoveries about her identity 
as they assess her symptoms. When the 
symptoms don't improve, the team looks to 
the patient's medical history to unearth 
more about her past. Meanwhile, House 
gives Chase's new hire a cold welcome, and 
a visit from House's massage therapist 
forces House and Cuddy to confront the 
reservations in their relationship.

Enjoy :)
