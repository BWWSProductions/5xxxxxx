Back when I was a kid, Leonard Nimoy had a show on TV called ""In Search Of"". Well, one of my little classmates fell so IN LOVE with aliens. Bigfoot, ghosts, etc. that he taped the shows with his cassette recorder and proceeded to walk around Jr. high school, playing the damned episodes for everyone to hear... and in turn RUINED his social life for the rest of his school career. These people selling this SHIT: George Noorey, Daniken, etc. are NOT doing it for free and it is all speculation. They may be the very idiots in high school walking around with the cassette player of this crap and EVERY generation repeats this game over and over. There is NEVER AN ANSWER, only more books... overpriced videos and wacky sponsors for their shit. This GAME never changes and like religion.... bilks millions of people out of millions of bucks for nothing!

You've been WARNED, kids!"
