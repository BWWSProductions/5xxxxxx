thumbs up!!!"
,Luvcat74,2010-10-12T16:29Z,"This is a GREAT Torrent....but is Does Not include bonus tracks. Not Complaining...many thanks for this...just informing. 

The 2 bonus tracks are called ""Longing"" & ""Heartbeats"". 

Joe Satriani talks about these 2 songs on his official website during video blogs prior to the cd's release (although your can still view them) 

As far as I know you can only get them if your purchase the cd at Best Buy while it still had the bonus tracks included (limited release), or downloaded them through Napster. If anyone has these tracks to share please do as I (as well as others I'm sure) would love to hear them.

Again thank you for this torrent."

,Ears14U,2011-09-13T18:43Z,"Yes! Thank you so very much! Joe Satriani is by far, one of the most talented guitarists on this planet. His songs are such an intriguing blend of rising and falling cresendos, that never leave a person with an empty feeling whatsoever! And thank you PIRATEHEART for sharing the torrent with all of us! Please don't be a weed, and continue to seed for others that may enjoy this cd also!"
