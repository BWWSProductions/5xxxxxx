    PLAIN JANE is a new summer reality series that transforms one woman from the inside out to reveal a brand new woman. Each of the eight episodes will feature a new Jane searching for the change of a lifetime. With the help of British fashion expert Louise Roe ([b]Fashion Police: The 2009 Grammy Awards[/b]), each Plain Jane will receive a head-to-toe style transformation, including new wardrobe and confidence-building exercises. Once the transformation is complete, the formerly Plain Jane will surprise her unsuspecting crush with the new look and reveal her true feelings to him. A love connection is - or isn't - made.
