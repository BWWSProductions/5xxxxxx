[T],tmax666,2010-10-15T15:24Z,Unfortunately after looking at this on an audio analyzer this appears to be a FLAC converted from MP3.  
,name2long,2010-10-15T18:53Z,"I converted these from flac to wav to flac. If they are sourced from mp3s, then that is a problem with HMV's files, as well. Here's that torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5751892/V_A_-_Heavy_Metal_%28Soundtrack%29_1981_%5BVinyl%5D_HMV

Given the prolific nature of HMV's FLAC torrents, I highly doubt that they are mp3 sourced."
,name2long,2010-10-15T18:57Z,"also, the description should've said this (I don't know what happened there):

I grabbed the FLAC download of the Heavy Metal soundtrack, and loaded them on to my mp3 player (a Rockboxed Sansa e280). When I tried to play the files, it choked on them every 5â€“10 seconds. As a result, the files were useless to use on it. When I checked what was wrong with them, I found that the creator of that torrent had set the sample rate at 96kHz! This torrent is the same files, but resampled in Audacity to 44.1kHz (much more usable in an mp3 player with a fairly weak processor by comparison to iPods). Since it took me about a half-hour to resample the files, I figured I'd share the result.

Enjoy!
