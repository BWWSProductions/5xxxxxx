Show #2
Monday October 11, 9pm
 
PERFORMERS: Lewis Black (host), with Derek Edwards, Kathleen Madigan, Dom Irrera, Paul F Tompkins, Greg Giraldo. 

Never the introvert, the Angriest Man in America Lewis Black hosts a roster of opinionated comics who just want to be heard, dammit! Along with Lewis spewing his usual bile about the state of everything, Derek Edwards pontificates on his driving frustrations, Dom Irrera thinks alcohol is wonderful, Kathleen Madigan has lost all hope for America, Greg Giraldo rants on about how women have all the power today, and Paul F Tompkins has probably the most incendiary topic of all. You'd be an idiot to miss it... then again, that's just our opinion.
