Each episode of this radio series takes an easily identifiable public figure and contorts their story into a bitesize West End Musical.

The new series covers the US Election, Piers Morgan's search for his real father (Pappa Pia), Nick Clegg's search for a personality, Demon chef Ramsay Todd's search for the perfect pie ingredient, Ebenezer Brown's search for Christmas cheer, and Boris Johnson driving a bus from Beijing to Bow in the hope that he'll arrive in time for the London Olympics.
