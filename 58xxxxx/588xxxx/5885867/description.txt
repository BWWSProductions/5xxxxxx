These tables are missing from all of the PDFs of the book available online. Without these tables you're going to have a rough time. I have no idea why people wouldn't include these with the book.

I did this by myself, for myself. Its somewhat rough and sloppy, but its all here and fully usable. The PDF could likely be greatly reduced in size but I don't know how.

Im putting this out here because it needs to be. Please download and seed, as I wont seed it for very long. If you could, maybe upload a reduced sized one.

Good Luck!
