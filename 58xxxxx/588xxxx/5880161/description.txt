Are you tired of Microsoft windows genuine advantage notification,

always telling you that your window is not genuine? Are you tired

of having to wait for 5 seconds before you can logon to your computer

and you badly needed a windows genuine validation tool to solve the

problem?How badly do you need the windows xp activation software?

Are you tired of the windows notification pop up telling you that

you may be a victim of a software counterfeiting? Has this notification

changed your desktop to total black color? Are you thinking of formatting

your computer? Remember you have files that you donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t want to lose.



RemoveWGA will enable you to easily remove the Microsoft "Windows Genuine

Advantage Notifications" tool, which is calling home and connect to MS servers

every time you boot.

Futures updates of this notification tool will (officialy) setup the connection

rate to once every two weeks.

Once the WGA Notification tool has checked your OS and has confirmed you had a

legit copy, there is no decent point or reason to check it again and again every boot.

Moreover, connecting to Microsoft brings security issue for corporate networks,

and privacy issues for everyone. It is also unclear which information are transmitted

(Microsoft published an official answer, but an individual study brought some questions).

All of that, along the fact that Microsoft used deceptive ways to make you install

this tool (it was told you it was an urgent security update, whereas it is a new

installation giving you no extra security) makes me calling this tool a spyware.

Also, Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications is different than Windows Genuine Advantage

Validation. RemoveWGA only removes the notification part, phoning home, and

does not touch the Validation part.

ok now u can uninstall Windows "Genuine Advantage

Notifications"WORKING....


***************************************************************************************
Note: Some antivirus and antispyware programs flag RemoveWGA as being infected/malware,

although the application is perfectly safe and does not pose a threat to your

system. This is called a 'false positive'. The term false positive is used when

antivirus software wrongly classifies

an innocuous ( inoffensive ) file as a virus. The incorrect detection may be due to

heuristics or to an incorrect virus signature in a database. [Similar problems can

occur with antitrojan or antispyware software.]



DON"T FORGET TO TURN OFF THE AUTOMATIC UPDATES...THANKS..
