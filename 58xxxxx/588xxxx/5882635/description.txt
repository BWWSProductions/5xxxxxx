This is a handheld audience shot of a show that the Floyd did at a rock festival and was the very last time they performed the entire Atom Heart Mother suite, which opens up this video,in fact the video seems to cut right into the show, as the song begins, so as this video runs about 37 min., I don't think this is the entire show but,all in all, I believe this to be among the best of the Floyd boots of this era. Great sound, nice shots of the stage, it's elevated so hardly any heads get in the way.A very big and loving thankyou very much, goes to the thoughtful attendee who filmed this, and no doubt had in mind that WE would love to have this someday. YOU WERE RIGHT!
