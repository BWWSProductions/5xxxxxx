Twins Who Share a Brain

TWINS WHO SHARE A BRAIN is the story of one year in the life of the most unique set of twins ever born in Canada.  The Hogan twins have struggled to survive since they were conceived in the womb.  Statistically, the twins had a 20% chance of being born alive.  If they beat that hurdle then there was a 75% chance theyâ€™d die within 48 hours. Only two sets of craniopogus twins have reached adulthood. Yet at birth they were as strong as one would expect if they had been â€˜normalâ€™ monozygotic twins born prematurely.

However, it soon became obvious that their survival was far from assured.

Seizures have gripped the girls and sent them to deathâ€™s doorstep.  Their doctors are operating under new rules...few people have had the opportunity to see craniopagus twins, let alone treat them.  Every test administered, every operation the girls have to undergo, puts them into new territory.

Many Craniopagus twins share brain matter, but in most cases itâ€™s an insignificant amount with no impact on function or consciousness.  But in the case of Tatiana and Krista, earlier MRI scans suggested something unique in the human form. They have a well-defined bridge between the Thalamus, the key-switching centre of the brain. This is where all senses (apart from smell) are received before being passed on to the higher levels of the brain for processing into the senses of touch, sight, taste and hearing.

The ramifications of this are two-fold. Firstly it means that any attempt to separate would almost definitely result not only in the death of Krista, but also in severe brain damage to her sister Tatiana.

But more incredibly, it opens up the possibility that both sisters could use each otherâ€™s senses. As Dr. Cochrane explains, itâ€™s only now that the twins are older that functional MRI techniques can tell the level of communication between the brains at the sensory level. The neuroâ€”psychological team prepare for what could be a medical first.

However, already there is plenty of evidence of some level of sharing of the senses â€“ particularly sight. Both Doug, the twinsâ€™ grandfather, and Felicia have observed Tatiana â€˜zoning outâ€™, her eyes becoming transfixed in an almost hypnotic state when Krista is being fed a visual stimulus that Tatiana cannot see. Felicia firmly believes that at those times she is using her sistersâ€™ eyes to see what her sister is seeing.

Against all odds, they came into this world and have not only survived, but thrived to the amazement of their medical team. Their story is one that will change our understanding of human consciousness.
