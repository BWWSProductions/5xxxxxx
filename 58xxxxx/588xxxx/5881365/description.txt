I spent many hours putting this together so I decided that it would be a
waste if I was the only one to ever enjoy it, so here you go. Hopefully
there will be a few people here that like it.

This is a 2-Disc Custom Compilation of .hack//ROOTS that I put together
using ConvertXtoDVD.

I pushed this authoring program to its limits to include menu features
such as custom fonts and full-length background music (from the OST) as
well as dual style english subtitles.

English is the default language dub but japanese is included as well.
Subtitles are in english.

The menus consist of a Title Menu, Root Menu, Chapter Menu, and Settings
Menu - each menu has its own background music track from the OST.

The chapters are set up so that you can easily skip the 1:30 opening of
each episode.

The picture quality is the best that I could possibly get it - I took the
highest quality episode rips that I could find on the internet, and to be
honest they look (and sound) REALLY awesome. Iâ€˜m amazed how much difference
de-interlacing makes with anime. Youâ€˜â€˜ll find that these episodes look way
better than a regular interlaced anime DVD.

(BTW I also made a similar compilation of Xenosaga: The Animation, so if
anyone wants it, please post here and let me know. And yes, I plan on
making one for SIGN as well... Some day... These things take FOREVER!)
