This is the first 4 hours of Alex's 27 hour marathon broadcast, supporting his MoneyBomb fundraising drive.

Former CNN anchor, Lou Dobbs, joins Alex in hour 2.  Alan Watt is on in hours 3 and 4.



The Infowars web site gives this description for the broadcast as a whole ::

Join Alex and crew today for the Infowars Moneybomb, a 27 hour marathon to raise the money Alex needs to take his operation to the next level. Alex is not backed by the corporate media and the foundations, so his continued success relies on your support. Please make a donation on the Infowars Moneybomb page. The show today will be a jam-packed blockbuster featuring on our free video stream never before seen interviews with Paul Craig Roberts, Katherine Austin Fitts, Lord Christopher Monckton, Sherri Tenpenny, Jeffrey Smith, Rev. Clenard Childress, Alan Watt, and others. In addition, the marathon show will feature a number of live guests, including Max Keiser, Gerald Celente, Webster Tarpley, and Paul Craig Roberts. You won't want to miss the show today.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
