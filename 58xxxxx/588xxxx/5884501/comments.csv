[V],phatwarez,2010-10-14T04:21Z,I'm not sure. There was no included nfo.
,Noisuf-X,2010-10-14T05:36Z,"Thanks!! I was seriously about to search for this because i have been jonesing for some Schwarzenegger, and viola, top of the page."
,JavaJoeKC,2010-10-14T23:34Z,"This torrent has a 'bluray' tag, so one can only assume the source was Blu-Ray.  If so, it's an early release as neither dvdempire and blu-ray-dot-com list this as a blu-ray title."
,N2x,2010-10-15T01:53Z,A blurip wouldn't have ac3 audio. This looks like a DTheater rip. Very nice until we get dts.
[V],phatwarez,2010-10-15T11:41Z,"Yup, it's a Dtheater rip, I did some further researching you guys are correct."
,Noisuf-X,2010-10-16T07:57Z,"wtf d-theater?

I don't care if it supposed to be better than DVD, VHS scare me."
,Noisuf-X,2010-10-16T07:58Z,DTheater can only go up to 1080i.
,Amol_Gh,2010-11-09T05:06Z,Is it anamorphic???
