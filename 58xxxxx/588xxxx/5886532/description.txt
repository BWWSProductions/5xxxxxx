--OVERVIEW:      Here are 3 programs that are very useful for sending messages over networks (school, work, etc.). Chat with friends, colleagues, whoever! With these files, all you have to know is the recipients IP Address or Username! Just type their username and the message you want to send, it's THAT EASY!



--CONTENTS:      3 Batch (.bat) files which use the 'Net Send' command. Very easy to use and ranging from basic to advanced in terms of functionality.



--NOTE:          THESE WILL ONLY WORK ON A WINDOWS XP COMPUTER! The 'Net Send' command has been removed on Windows Vista and Windows 7.



--HOW IT WORKS:  A Batch file (.bat) is a file used to contain a large (or small) amount of CMD (Command prompt) commands. The 'Net Send' command, which is utilized by these programs, enables users to send messages across a network (such as at school or the office).



--ALSO:          I did NOT create these files. I found them across the internet, and felt that everybody should have the opportunity to access this technology. Please seed, as other people seeded this for you. Just return the favor by seeding for others. Thanks!
