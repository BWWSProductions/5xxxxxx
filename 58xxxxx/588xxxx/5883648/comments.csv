,Stollen84,2010-10-14T13:11Z,"Honestly... I'll delete this game 'til they find a fix for the insane stuttering.
37 fps as average, and still stutters like hell. No matter the settings..

Gothic classic syndrome... -.-"

,skilledhavoc,2010-10-15T14:55Z,"is anyone else having this problem, i have never had this happen to me before

1) i have dual screens and all my games come up on my left screen but for some reson when i go to launch gothic 4 it pops up on my right

2) i can see the mouse icon in the game but i can't click at all but i can use the arrow keys to get into the settings but once in there i can't do anything but ESC back out to the main menu

so if anyone has any ideas on how to fix it would be awesome"
,Raiviz,2010-10-15T14:57Z,"For every one who have problems with antivirus.
Turn your Nod32 antivirus off:
1)Right click on Nod32 and select Advanced Setup
2)Unmark ""Enable Antivirus and antispyvare protection""

Start installing the game."
,denaron,2010-10-15T19:45Z,"It works like a charm here. I'm playing on W7 x64.
I've just mounted the iso, installed, and copied the crack. 

Definately going to seed it now, thank you again uploader!"

Runs exactly how the demo did, 1920x1080 everything turned up as high as it would go. No issues whatsoever"
,Tyr_Draco,2010-10-16T01:04Z," Thanks for upload Dibya. As for the publishers of this game, if you are reading this. Maybe you should ask yourselves the question why this game costs $49.81 on american shelves while on australian shelves its $88.90. I am sorry but the AUD to USD there is atm 1 cent difference between to two not 39 dollars. If you were not so keen to be pirating from us, I guess we would not be so keen pirating from you. Prices should be reasonable to purchase from any country. But then I guess you dont read these comments maybe just see how much money you are losing. Money lost due to your own greed."
,Tyr_Draco,2010-10-16T01:10Z,Thanks for upload Dibya. As for game publishers explain 1 question if you bother reading our posts. Why it cost 49.50 USD in USA and 88.90 AUD in AUS when there is only 1 cent difference between the currencies. Your willingness to pirate from us makes our willingness to pirate from you. The money you lose from majority of pirates is your own doing.

,Tyr_Draco,2010-10-16T01:17Z,"sorry for all the posts, having issues with posting, doesnt show up for some reason when I initially submit, and now I look at it it has all the posts that I kept submitting"
,Otakuonfire,2010-10-16T10:53Z,">

Just to let those people experience the ""Not Responding"" issue when attempting to install the game, it does take a long time, but the game does seem to continue to install and the ""show details"" section will reflect that after awhile.

I'm currently up to datablocks1.pak... scratch that, it just went to speech0.pak in front of my eyes, all the while being ""not responding"" most of the time.

Patience will prevail with this for those having this issue."
,Otakuonfire,2010-10-16T10:58Z,"@Tyr_Draco
The official reason is that distribution to Australia costs more. ie. getting all the manufacturing done overseas then shipped here including advertising and otherwise. That's the excuse they give anyway."
,spearmann,2010-10-16T13:29Z,why am i only getting 200kbs download speed with this shit torrent
,Tatazildo,2010-10-16T16:48Z,"Just change your PC Audio Settings for 48Hz DVD Quality, crash to desktop/startup error solved. Just like Dead Rising 2."
,Smith1512,2010-10-16T19:04Z,"It seems that software companies have found a new, very effective way to fight piracy. Since there is no way to stop scene from releasing cracks to games, the are now issuing patches and hotfixes. Lots of them. Some -- at the day of the game release, like with ArcaniA. And it seems to be effective method.

Crack was released almost immediately after the game release, but have anyone seen a scene release of the hotfix improving performance?

If anyone did, please give me a link; but I have searched quite thorough and I am quite sure there is none."
,JVoco.,2010-10-17T02:33Z,am i special cuz im not sure how to install diz game lol
,MrTTAO,2010-10-17T09:09Z,"@Raiviz: Your ""solution"" is to disable the antivirus. But that isn't the issue, the issue is that NOD says its got a virus, and people trust NOD, so we better get a very good damn reason why this isn't really a virus but a false positive before we disable our anti virus, I am sure everyone here knows how to disable their anti virus if they were actually willing to.

Bottom line, NOD32 says its a virus."
,JVoco.,2010-10-17T15:18Z,@skilledhavoc maybe if u switch the default to ur right screen the problem might fix itself and how do u install gothic 4? i cant figure it out 
,JVoco.,2010-10-17T15:20Z,@haxme2death me 2 i have no idea how to do it and am too lazy to actually look it up
,denaron,2010-10-17T18:12Z,"I'm also having framerate issues here. I thought it was because of the graphic settings, but looks like it's not. I'm having bad performance even playing with lowest graphic options on na w7 x 65, 4 gb ram, amd 2x 5600 and nvidia gf 9600. I didn't have any problems on the Aecania demo though. Strange isn't it?"

btw to all you other guys out there i have downloaded at least over 50 games and out of all of those games only 1 did not work..... so there is a high chance you just do not know what you are doing...."

,JiGS-AW,2010-11-05T22:55Z,"Avira warned me about a Dropper Trojan when trying to install this, awesome.

And for the people that are gonna bash me that it's detecting the Crack, no it wasn't the crack."
,dumbass08,2011-06-16T18:38Z,i dont know why anyone who has played this would ever seed it. i registered to this site just to cast my vote for an extremely buggy shit release. I have been using pc's for over 15 years and have never had problems other than the expected. this is just a terrible title from a company with a history of shitty releases which is now gone. DONT SEED theres plenty of other titles out there that do it correctly no offense to uploader just a really terrible game. peace
