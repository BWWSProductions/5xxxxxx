,crossfire6,2010-10-16T19:46Z,"This is a GREAT up, and MUCH appreciated!!
It seems to be working perfectly, but every time I start the app I do get a little window popping up in lower right task area (of the desktop) that says the subscription has expired.  Yet, if I just close that window and ignore the message it appears that the app is working perfectly, and there are no unusual messages appearing anywhere in the app window itself.  Also, when I go to Help/About, it indicates that the app is properly registered under the supplied name/number.
So, is anyone else seeing this?  Any suggestions on anything else I should do?
Many thanks!"
