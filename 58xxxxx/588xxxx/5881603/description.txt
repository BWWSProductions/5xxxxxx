"Goodbye, Columbia"

An anonymous Gossip Girl blast starts a very 
damaging rumor about one of Columbia's new 
students, Serena (Blake Lively). On her path 
to greatness, Blair (Leighton Meester) 
decides to take a class with a powerful 
businesswoman, Martha (guest star Marilyne 
Barrett), who is guest-lecturing at Columbia
but a mysterious fellow student thwarts her 
plans to secure the prized position as 
Martha's assistant.

Enjoy :)
