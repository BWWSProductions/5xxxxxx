,Lycan23,2010-10-16T03:15Z,does it have subs with it ray?
,richardpa,2010-10-16T14:30Z,"Great copy and a quick download...
A/9 (Has English srt subtitles)
V/9
Small screener watermark at the bottom of the picture which is covered most of the time by the English subtitles and certainly does not spoil the quality of this film in anyway...
Proper DVDRip quality and a really good movie...
Many Thanx to raymondhome and ViSiON for an Excellent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
,QborT,2010-10-16T17:18Z,"The subs are auto translated from Vietnamese.

They are terrible.  

This is the Mandarin rip which never contains English subtitles... the proper English subtitles will be released with the Cantonese audio version.

The fact that it says the subs are ""cutsom made"" should be your first indication that they will suck.   LuLz"
,shinobiXRT,2010-10-21T23:38Z,"donnie yen films are like  bruce willis, over rated and not much substance"
,acemyster,2010-10-25T16:55Z,I dont think its gonna worth downloading for days (slow internet) and see all the negative comments come to life...
,yo9mama6,2010-11-02T21:36Z,raymond you are the POO!
,LOLiverPB,2010-11-13T21:18Z,"this movie will dissapoint to due to the lack of action, however the scenes that have its action and martial arts are spectacular. The story is quite good to, but ye, u can start yawning at times when nothing happens. Quality is good aswell. Just to inform people who want to see this, im a martial arts movie fan myself and seen most of it, so I hope I can speak for a big part of the martial art fans."
