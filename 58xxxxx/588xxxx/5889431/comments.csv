,BasilBrush,2010-10-16T00:31Z,The flickering video at 3minutes that lasts for 20seconds appears to be a cock up by the BBC. The problem is in the original TS file - it's not an encoding problem.

,BasilBrush,2010-10-16T13:45Z,"The torrent is also available at Demonoid.

The MD5 hash of the Piratebay torrent file (not the MKV file) is:
65FF7FB0667B1F902B5E1A84578DF08C

The Demonoid and Piratebay torrents have different MD5 hashes because Piratebay add extra trackers to the torrent file most of which don't work."

,ankushdawar,2010-10-16T15:14Z,I am not getting audio in it ?
,BasilBrush,2010-10-17T05:10Z,"You'll have to give me a clue which player and Operating System you're using.

Here's the list of players I've tested it with:
1) VLC v1.1.4 - plays ok.
2) MPC-HC 1.3.1301.0 (with ffdshow 3562 and Haali 1.10.262.12) - plays ok.
3) Winamp 5.581 - requires MP4 adding to the extension list in DirectShow decoder. Also requires ffdshow and Haali - plays ok.
4) Windows Media Player v11.0.5721.5268 - requires ffdshow and Haali - plays ok.
5) Quicktime - staggered video - not a good player for CABAC. If your a Apple MAC user try MPlayerX or VLC. MPlayerX supports the ffmpeg multi-threaded h264 decoder which you'll need for decoding CABAC.
6) PowerDVD8 - doesn't suppory AAC audio - a pretty useless player."
,BasilBrush,2010-10-17T05:17Z,If you are a Quicktime user you can use the Export function to convert from CABAC to CAVLC mode for a lower quality version for Apple devices. This is likely to take a few hours at least.
