,vincentdesrd,2010-10-15T03:06Z,Forget what I said... No seed... The other one has like 20.
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-15T03:16Z,"for some reason no seeders are appearing.

I think it might be due to the trackers you are using. They are broken.  Especially piratebay's, they stopped their trackers a while back."
