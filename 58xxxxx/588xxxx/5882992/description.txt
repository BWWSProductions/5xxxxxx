This is an excellent video; thank you for creating and posting.? Finally, someone who claims to debunk A. Jones actually cites REAL lies and examples! Was this all from one show? I wouldn't be surprised, if so. After listening to Alex for a year and a half, I gradually realized he constantly fudges the "truth" and cuts off and insults anyone who tries to question or critique him. I also got fed up with the ranting and raving and yelling. There are lots of other info sources out there, people.

In this video, I chronicle 26 of Alex Jones' most ridiculous lies, from fake predictions, to exaggerations of doom, to false numbers, to cartoonish violence, to insane mayhem.

This guy is a pathological liar, mixing lies in with liberty-sounding ideas.
