,Sfinx_P,2011-01-08T09:32Z,Thanks for the upload!!!!!!! Might think of changing the description to 720p though
,jenchai,2011-05-26T10:53Z,"Seriously guys, 5.5 Mbps bitrate and 1080p resolution and still complaining ?

For me its perfect. Thank you for the upload."

,Darkoil,2011-09-07T20:15Z,"Its a good copy but it isn't 1080p, in the description it says the height resolution is only 816."
,danwguy,2011-11-06T00:25Z,"@Darkoil: Yes it is 1080p, the width of the movie is 1920, yes the height is only 816, but when you crop the black top and bottom of a 1080p movie, thats the height you get, don't complain if you don't know what you're talking about.

@LLT: Thank you for a 1080p rip that will fit on a regular DVD-rw, these are the releases I search high and low for, keep up the great work and thank you again."
,otnemem,2011-11-23T22:08Z,"Those complaining this isn't 1080p should consider getting a clue.
Almost every 1080p (and many 720p) torrent has a couple of these idiots talking out of their asses.

Torrent worked perfectly for me. Only had to remux the DTS audio into AC3 so that my LG TV could read it properly but that's like three clicks and five minutes :)"
,akflow,2012-01-12T17:35Z,thank you very much dude ! this will sadly be one of the last movies i'' be able to download from piratebay. because of the coming censor on TPB in The Netherlands :(
