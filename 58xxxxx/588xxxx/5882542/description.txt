.: Plot :.

Shinobu Kandori is Jun Shirogane, the daughter of a family of secret service agents who returns from a karate tournament in America to find them all murdered. Her ex-lover and secret service partner asks her to use her FBI training to join him, trying to track down the criminals called Viper's Nest behind the deaths of her relatives. It goes without saying that the perfect undercover role in which to tour Japan searching for the crims is as a professional woman wrestler, with her partner acting as the manager. Jun's wrestling alter ego is Silver, and it just so happens that she goes off on her crime fighting in her gaudy get-up too.
The criminal mastermind they are up against is Nancy, a dominatrix and part of the Otsunami yakuza family who has the powerful bank president Sasazaki at her command. Jun is captured and tortured when trying to arrest Nancy, but manages to escape, killing Sasazaki with her lethal coin-tossing skills and then killing Nancy with the power of wrestling. Jun then finds herself the target of 004, a hitman from Viper's Nest who specialises in darts.
