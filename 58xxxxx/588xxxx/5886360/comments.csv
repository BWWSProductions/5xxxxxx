,Distagon76,2010-12-11T23:47Z,"Hey, what's about cracked roboform.dll?
Does it work as intended, no spies?"
,brianxxx,2010-12-20T16:53Z,"I own this legally and could not do without it. But I also use the keygen version for my virtual machine test beds.

I am sure there will be a license generator for 7.1 like there was with 6.x. Just be patient.

The license generator was nice because it allowed for hassle free updates! lol"
