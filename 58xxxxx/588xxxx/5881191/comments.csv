,itzcrazy,2010-11-01T08:16Z,this version any good?
,skylr1201,2011-01-18T06:49Z,"if there wasnt scenes in the movie of underwater it would be a great version, but everytime it showed a underwater scene the picture would get almost unviewable other than that the picture and audio was great"
,skylr1201,2011-01-18T06:52Z,not a good version dont bother unless you dont want to see any of the underwater scenes
,TPBislegendary,2011-02-13T15:41Z,"i agree with skylr1201. there is parts of the film, predominantly the underwater scenes, that are just ridiculously blurry! audio was fine though :)"
