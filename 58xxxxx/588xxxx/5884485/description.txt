                    The Noble Art.                           
                    Betrayal, infidelity and blackmail fester as  
                    plans to re-enact a Victorian prizefight turn  
                    nasty - and even DCI Barnaby finds his   
                    judgement clouded by an old friend. Midsomer  
                    Morchard welcomes back local boxer John  
                    Kinsella from his world title fight victory in  
                    New York. Meanwhile, Kinsella's ruthless and  
                    controlling promoter Frank Bishop goes to see  
                    solicitor Giles Braithwaite, only to find the  
                    lawyer dead. The re-enactment goes ahead with  
                    grudges and secrets simmering in the     
                    background, but then Bishop himself is killed.  
                    Can Barnaby get to the bottom of the murders?
