Christy Moore is the greatest singer of Irish folk music of the twentieth century; and this only begins to describe his genius. As member of both Planxty and Moving Hearts, he helped revolutionize traditional music and laid the groundwork for Celtic Rock. Ordinary Man features 12 tracks including 'Delirium Tremens', 'Matty', 'Another Song Is Born', 'Hard Cases' and more. BMG. 2000.

Ordinary Man, as the name suggests, was an album for the working man. The songs and music reflected the economic atmosphere of Ireland and of Great Britain at the time. The title song, "Ordinary Man", was written by Grimsby musician Peter Hames and depicts a factory worker losing his job as the plant closes down, and his struggle to survive. The album also has a strong link to Moore's Irish roots with songs like "St. Brendans Voyage" and "Delirium Tremens" both relating directly to Ireland. DÃ³nal Lunny played a major part in the album, writing much of the music for the songs. A long time of friend of Moore, Lunny was also a member of Planxty and has worked closely with him for many years
