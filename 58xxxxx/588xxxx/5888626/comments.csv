Works on Soft modded Wii 4.3u

,bblueline,2011-08-14T18:09Z,I have a modded wii and was wondering how to force a PAL to be NTSC or does it matter? I convert to iso using wii backup manager and then burn with Imgburn.
,Darko2.0,2011-09-03T07:39Z,"You dont need to convert this just burn it with imgburn like you did, .iso's work fine when burned, but if you want to force PAL to work on NTSC systems then you need to get neogamma which I use, although this is an NTSC copy and if it isnt it worked fine for me anyway."
