Frankie Goes To Hollywood - Welcome To The Pleasure Dome [promo].VOB



Very HQ rare promo music video. "Welcome to the Pleasuredome" is the title 
track to the 1984 debut album by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

This video, by Bernard Rose, features the group stealing a car, going to a 
carnival and encountering all manner of deceptively "pleasureable" activities. 
The audio soundtrack of the video was included as part of the cassette single.
(video has 5 small, semi-transparent blue dots on the bottom right)
