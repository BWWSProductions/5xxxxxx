To do that, locate the host file:

edit it with notepad and do NOT change the extension"

thanks a lot!"
,{me},2011-01-22T02:29Z,"Actually Microsoft would have nothing to gain paying thethingy off (though he certainly would). The reality is that the majority of downloaders using most torrents would never, ever pay any amount of money for those products, much less twelve grand! Should this horrendously over-priced product simply not be available through these download methods, most people would simply find a free alternative such as Dev-C++ or others. Microsoft actually stands to gain from this product being so conveniently available because potential customers can test drive the full RTM product, or may purchase a future release because of their exposure to the product that they would otherwise not have had. The bottom line is neither myself nor anyone else here was considering purchasing this product until we found this, but rather thought of using the product and sought out this page.
Thanks thethingy
Happy Pirating"

,namshub,2011-02-05T01:15Z,"just a reminder, if you're using zonealarm:
go to:
'Program Control'
'Main'
set 'SmartDefense Advisor' to Manual
(this makes every program ask you for permission to use the net. don't worry, you can make any choices permanent so you don't keep getting bugged every 5 minutes)
***********BUT***********
if you're using any ms s/w, such as this,
you'll want to go to
'Advanced'
in
'SmartDefense Advisor'
and uncheck the
'Allow certified MS programs to run automatically'
otherwise there's really no point to using torrents cuz something'll phone home and then you'll be F*@ked! "
