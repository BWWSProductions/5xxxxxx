,steelbunny,2010-10-12T18:06Z,"I just went to Nitroroms.com and downloaded it directly with no waiting and the file was zip with 7-zip. No torrent. by the way as I heard only 2 cards and 1 emulator can run the ROM at present (DESUM.EXE , Cyclo DS and AKAIO 1.8.1 beta)  "
[T],simmyboy80,2010-10-12T18:08Z,"I am initial seeding this torrent people , there must be a problem with TPB I think"

,CaptainSmeg,2010-10-12T18:29Z,"Working now thanks, downloaded and currently seeding, I can confirm it has an anti-piracy loop at the beggining for the R4 card with Wood 1.14."
[T],simmyboy80,2010-10-12T18:34Z,"@steelbunny

read the NFO and the 1st comment on torrent and already states what you had written , if you downloaded someone elses dump on nitroroms then thats fine just dont advertise it on my torrent pages thanks"
,TheLazyTooth,2010-10-12T18:37Z,"Perfect rom, but it keeps looping the start intro on my R4 With wood firmware 1.14.

,steelbunny,2010-10-12T20:30Z,"@simmyboy, I hear you! Thanks for your post anyway. Keep the good work. Now we need to see how to make this rom worked for everyone."
[T],simmyboy80,2010-10-12T20:32Z,"@mr quakers

i downloaded your torrent and didnt even loadc up on any emulator or card and by looking at the code on the ROM it wasnt super scribblenauts so it was technically fake"
,MrQuackers,2010-10-12T22:03Z,"Sir, I think you are on crack. I've been playing it all night. Did you try the newest version of DesMuMe? Because it seems to load fine for everyone else. Just stop with the bad talk. We both have SS and its not a big deal. They both work."
[T],simmyboy80,2010-10-12T22:14Z,"by the state of the 2 torrents you have uploaded you are the one who is on crack , everyone on TPB look at my uploads and then look at mrquackers torrents and you decide who is on crack !!! , whoever you decide leave a message on thier latest torrent sayng CRACK"

,steelbunny,2010-10-13T01:28Z,Sound dumb but I need help. I can't find place to download Akai Beta 1.8. AceKard web site still has Akaio 1.7 is the latest.
,CaptainSmeg,2010-10-13T01:28Z,"GL with the crack, thanks for the effort Simmyboy!

I believe the SUXXORS release would have been leaked by now if it was real."

,MrQuackers,2010-10-13T09:31Z,"Dude. Seriously. Grow up. What are you, 12? I said just drop it. But your all, Zoh m Gee I has more torrents I must be better."

you cant get AKAIO 1.8.1 unless you are a BETA tester , should be released in the next week or 2"
[T],simmyboy80,2010-10-13T11:24Z,"@ mrquackers

i think you are 12 , you name your torrent oh shit your about to load scribbnlenauts , there isnt any info on torrent , doesnt even state what platform ROM is for , you gotta learn to take some shit if you want to put torrents out there like that you TWAT"
,Z_Pirate,2010-10-13T13:16Z,One of the few games that wont run on the R4-SDHC (using 1.26b kernel).  Has the loop at start.
,Fluoxetine,2010-10-13T22:46Z,Any word on a crack yet guys? :)
,MrQuackers,2010-10-13T23:41Z,"I named the torrent the way I did and My username is what it is because It was supposed to be one of those things you go ""This guys stupid"" at and have a chuckle or two, Secondly I like ducks, Is that a terrible thing to do? 
If the person knows what they're downloading its not a sin. And last but not least, really. This is stupid, lets just drop it. And to be honest. If you'd like I'll delete my torrent and start seeding yours as a truce. Is THAT okay with you?"
,dragonthunderx,2010-10-14T03:52Z,"No, MrQuackers, you do how you do and don't let anyone stop you. This simmyboy made the mistake of calling your upload a fake with no proof at the time, and I like how you handled it. I think the power of being ""trusted"" is going to his head and is causing him to become a troll. I saw where you were going with your torrent name. ""If it's such a great game and you want it so bad you gotta look here to download it, why not buy it?"" But yeah.. Keep seeding the one you uploaded or else what's the point of uploading at all?"

Wood r4 is for old R4 card, how you made it work with R4i card? Wood r4 is not for R4i."

Then put it over and then all your games and it works trust me, i have SOLD so many of thise cards to people with this R4i kernel on and we CAN PLAY ALL SIMMYBOY80 games..

This will NOT work on a R4i Mario gold card as they suck so you need a real R4i card as this http://www.head-z.dk/index.php?page=shop.browse&category_id=63&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=28‚å©=da"

,MzNL,2010-11-17T17:41Z,"Hi simmyboy80.  Was able to download, no problem, and quickly too.  Using a new cycloDS evolution and the game isn't working.  In your comments, you put that it's been tested and works with the cyclo (firmware vB.4).  

I'm trying to get this game for my 8yo nephew.  Other games from a while back work, but while this one shows available in the list, when chosen, it's just a blank screen.  Is this v8.4 something I need to download?  If so, can you direct me to where?
Thank you!"

Too bad this game isn't all I was hoping for. I sort of suspected it was over-hyped from the beginning, which is why it took me this long to download it."
