KC and the Sunshine Band - Give It Up [promo].VOB



HQ very rare promo music video. "Give It Up" was a UK number one single for 
three weeks in August 1983 for KC and the Sunshine Band, although it was simply 
credited as KC in many countries, including the US. It went on to become the 18th best-selling single of the year in the UK. It was the last and most successful of the act's 10 hits in the UK, and was somewhat of a comeback 
hit in the United States. (video does not have any logos)
