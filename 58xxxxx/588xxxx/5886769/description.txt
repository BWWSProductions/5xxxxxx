Running Time: 28 Minutes

Eustace Mullins disusses one of his best-selling books; 'Murder by Injection' exposing the unholy dynasty of the big drug companies, the medical establishment, the Rockefeller syndicate and the evils of the cut-slash-and-burn cancer racket that has killed millions in the name of â€œfighting cancer.â€ Mullins beat the cancer doctors by resorting to alternative therapies not approved by the medical elite, so the author is speaking from real experience. 

While there are many books on the corruption of modern medicine, there is no other book out there that so effectively tells the whole story as does this seminal volume, laying bare the criminal machinations of those who profit in the name of â€œpromoting good health.â€ The federal bureaucracy that ostensibly â€œregulatesâ€ the big drug companies is all part and parcel of the problem.
