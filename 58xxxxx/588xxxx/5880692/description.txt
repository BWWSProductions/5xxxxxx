[concen.cc] The Zionist Story - Berelovich - [umunu.com] [umu.mu]

The Zionist Story, an independent film by Ronen Berelovich, is the story of ethnic cleansing, colonialism and apartheid to produce a demographically Jewish State. Ronen successfully combines archival footage with commentary from himself and others such as Ilan Pappe, Terry Boullata, Alan Hart and Jeff Halper. An excellent film, my one criticism is that there is little mention of the Zionist lobby; an additional interview with Walt or Meirsheimer would have been of value.

Ronen Berelovich studied in the Camera Obscura Film School in Tel Aviv, Israel. He made a string of short films (some featured in international film festivals) and his forty minutes drama, â€˜Shesh-beshâ€™, was chosen for public screening by â€˜Cinematequeâ€™, the leading art cinema in Tel Aviv. He also work as a recording technician in the High Court in Tel Aviv.

"I have recently finished an independent documentary, The Zionist Story, in which I aim to present not just the history of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, but also the core reason for it: the Zionist ideology, its goals (past and present) and its firm grip not only on Israeli society, but also, increasingly, on the perception of Middle East issues in Western democracies.

These concepts have already been demonstrated in the excellent â€˜Ocupation 101' documentary made by Abdallah Omeish and Sufyan Omeish, but in my documentary I approach the subject from the perspective of an Israeli, ex-reserve soldier and someone who has spent his entire life in the shadow of Zionism.

I hope you can find a moment to watch The Zionist Story and, if you like it, please feel free to share it with others. (As both the documentary and the archived footage used are for educational purposes only, the film can be freely distributed).

I have made this documentary entirely by myself, with virtually no budget, although doing my best to achieve high professional standard, and I hope that this â€˜home-spunâ€™ production will be of interest to viewers."
