SUMMARY:Kyoko was found at the scene of a brutal murder by chief inspector Kaoru. Due to the shock of the incident, Kyoko has lost her memory. Kaoru has asked Junichi, a suave psychiatrist, to help cure Kyoko, only to find out that she has multiple personalites. Who exactly is Kyoko, and what connections does she have to the murder...? 

We'll never know the answer to those questions as episode 2 was never released.
