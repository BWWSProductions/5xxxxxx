This is my very first torrent so be gentle with me if it lacks info or something here.

Description: This is a selection of my favourite country songs. 
Mostly modern songs, but I threw in a few classics as well.
I listen to alot of music while at work and I picked the one\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s I liked the best.
Downloading this torrent will give you the best of what today\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s country music has to offer.
And it will save you from listening to hundreds of bad songs just to find the few really special ones.
I didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t choose more then 3 songs from any one artist since I wanted some variation for you.
Perhaps someday I will make a vol. 2 torrent with the songs that I had to remove.
Please give feedback so that my next torrent can be even better.

Format: MP3
