Is the AC3 track in mono or surround?"
,zsubrowka,2010-10-27T13:02Z,"I hope the bluray source was this one:
http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Seven-Samurai-Blu-ray/7737/

Maybe not because this torrent is 4 days older then the one limked above.

Pls confirm!!!"

,ObscureClassics,2011-12-19T04:22Z,"This had horrible quality with scratches and film grain, And the subtitles are shitty and inaccurate."
,EXPERIMENTONGOD,2012-06-12T12:21Z,"This rip is shit compared with the Criterion remastered version, trust me you want this one:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5909860/Seven.Samurai.1954.720p.BluRay.x264-EbP

Don't get fooled by the cover image or the 1080p tag, the quality is terrible on this one"
