"Catch Me If You Cannon"

Silver (Jessica Stroup), Naomi (AnnaLynne McCord) 
and Adrianna (Jessica Lowndes) craft a plan to 
seduce Mr. Cannon (guest star Hal Ozsan) and 
prove that he raped Naomi, but they underestimate 
his ability to control the situation. Teddy 
(Trevor Donovan) and Ian (guest star Kyle Riabko) 
are forced to do manual labor as punishment for 
fighting. Dixon (Tristan Wilds) fears for his 
life and pushes Ivy (Gillian Zinser) away, 
leading her straight into the arms of Oscar 
(guest star Blair Redford). A pregnant Jen (guest 
star Sara Foster) seeks to hire a new assistant 
and Debbie (Lori Loughlin) applies for the job.

Enjoy :)
