[V],Big_dude,2010-11-04T18:13Z,"download winrar 3.93 link...
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5794009/WinRAR_3.93_Final_32Bit_And_64Bit_Full__blaze69_

test archive if its damaged with winrars test feature if it is recheck it with bittorrent client and redownload till its complete.

use 'extract here' to desktop or extract files..
to desktop should work I'd recommend burning to a dvd-r watch it in your dvd player get back with me if this worked and enjoy the movies."
