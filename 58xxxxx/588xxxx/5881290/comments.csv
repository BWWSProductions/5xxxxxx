,almightykay,2010-10-15T19:53Z,how can people even watch this shit
,martialis,2010-10-16T05:54Z,"wow, just...wow

Val Kilmer and Christopher Lambert are not in this movie.  Apparently IMDB will publish fake movie pages if you ask nicely.

""God damn, all any one's got to do is look at the lies Pyun told Guam when he was making his MAX HAVOC film there to know that the man is worthless. Guam lost a million dollars. I mean, Pyun got the Government to pay for his film and then he scams them. Remember Guam is an Island with extreme poverty, and here comes this *beep* and steals from them. I mean, what kind of human being does that?

So, now Pyun starts to steal from his fans.

Anybody that believes a god damn thing this *beep* has to say is a rube"""

,Subjazz,2010-11-05T06:19Z,This is a great way to flush your career down the drain in the movie industry. That is about the only good thing about this movie... what NOT to do when making a movie. Where is Ed Wood when you need him?

,highlander777,2010-11-19T05:12Z,"How come crap like this made it to the top 100 in TPB and ""Let Me In"" is not even listed???"
,haydn70ac,2010-11-20T06:20Z,"Has anyone actually watched this movie??
I have and it was not bad. Not the best but very watchable.

V:8
A:9
M:6.5"
,ArdentCustodian,2011-01-24T00:55Z,"Don't waste your time on this crap. This shouldn't be called a movie. Horrible acting, special effects rendered on a Commodore 64, incomprehensible writing, and amateur directing. A movie? This is a film class project gone terribly wrong, and you wouldn't even pass the class with this.

How bad is it? 30min of closeups, Kevin Sorbo appears in the last 20min, then 15min of credits. Sorbo what were you thinking."
,mohiergauth,2011-02-28T02:43Z,"@martialus, Who the fuck wants Val Kilmer, OR Christopher Lambert in a movie? They both suck, and between them have made T W O movies that didn't suck. HIGHLANDER, TOMBSTONE.

And since when did film makers NOT rip everyone off that was naive enough to let them?

IMBD is also much like wikipedia, any asshole can write reviews/post whatever. There is basically no eediting (which makes it LESS like wikipedia)

In closing your a troll, living in a fantastic world of righteous moneymakers, and awesome films. 

STAY THERE!"
