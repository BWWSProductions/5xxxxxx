Could I bother you to UL a copy of the cover [i]without[/i] your sig on the pic? Add it as a second sample and I'll get it there when I can. I don't have access to the internet during the weekend, which for me starts on Thursday evening.

I'm only asking because the Met-Art site does not have this particular cover on its covers page, and I looked a full year back.

TIA
