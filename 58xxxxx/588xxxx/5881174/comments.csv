Since Ive already uploaded an unabridged Audio Book of Bram Stokers Dracula, I thought it would be good to upload Frankenstein too.

The website also gives me an error message if I click the button to edit the torrent. I don't know why."
,memyselfandi88,2010-10-11T23:10Z,"When I look at the Trackers for my torrent uploads, I keep seeing: 

No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it. 


Can anyone tell my why this would be? Am I doing something wrong when I create the torrents? It appears that people are uploading them, but they dont show up as Seeders or Leechers on Pirate Bay."
