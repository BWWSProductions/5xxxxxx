Greetings everyone,

Since Iâ€™ve already uploaded an unabridged Audio Book of Bram Stokerâ€™s Dracula, I thought it would be good to upload Frankenstein too. This is an unabridged version of Mary Shelleyâ€™s Frankenstein, produced by Blackstone Audio. It is read by Simon Templeton, Anthony Heald, and Stephan Rudnicki. I hope you will enjoy it. 

I got the audio book from the library and ripped the discs with Windows Media Player. They are in mp3 format, at 128 kbps. There were 7 CDs, which ripped into 174 total files. The book is listed as being 8.5 hours long.


Here are links to the front and back covers from the CDs;
