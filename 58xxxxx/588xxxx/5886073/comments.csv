I do see some US language files and probably have to select them somewhere in the program... but  my Chinese is a bit rusty...

Could someone help me out with chaning the language?"
,Bjellesau,2010-10-14T21:17Z,"Yes, pure chinese. Not usable, don't know how to change language."

,Souchie,2010-10-16T12:19Z,"Thanks for the reply ekarth22 but I still haven't managed it. I can find the setup menu (I think) but nothing there that says ""English""

I know its a bit much to ask but do you think you could provide a screenshot of the menu you change your language?"
