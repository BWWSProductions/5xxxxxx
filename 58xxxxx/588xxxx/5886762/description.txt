Eustace Mullins disusses his best-selling book: 'The Secrets of the Federal Reserve' - which was the first publication based on the Federal Reserve system in 1952, and as become one of the most heavily plagiarized work of any single author.

American history in the twentieth century has recorded the amazing achievements of the Federal Reserve bankers. First, the outbreak of World War I, which was made possible by the funds available from the new central bank of the United States. Second, the Agricultural Depression of 1920. Third, the Black Friday Crash on Wall Street of October, 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression. Fourth, World War II. Fifth, the conversion of the assets of the United States and its citizens from real property to paper assets from 1945 to the present, transforming a victorious America and foremost world power in 1945 to the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largest debtor nation in 1990.

Today, this nation lies in economic ruins, devastated and destitute, in much the same dire straits in which Germany and Japan found themselves in 1945. Will Americans act to rebuild our nation, as Germany and Japan have done when they faced the identical conditions which we now face--or will we continue to be enslaved by the Babylonian debt money system which was set up by the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 to complete our total destruction?

This is the only question which we have to answer, and we do not have much time left to answer it.
