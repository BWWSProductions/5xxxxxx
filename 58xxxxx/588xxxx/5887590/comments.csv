,hkoraddi,2010-10-15T07:56Z,thanks bro best print and rip
,nikoHD,2010-10-15T08:11Z,Thanks 20/40. Ive never downloaded one of your 720p movies so i'm looking forward to it. Thanks for a great movie!
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-15T09:09Z,"Thanks guys. This one took half a day to encode. It is very very good 720p. I know that 700MB isn't preferred size here - but Toy Story 3. is much longer than previous two. Also, out there is not and would not be any 720p in H264/MPEG-4 format - directly playable on gaming platforms and computers - of this size and quality.
So, enjoy."
,justregged,2010-10-15T16:48Z,"The quality of this is outstanding, im not joking i got the sample of diamonds 700meg bdrip yesterday and the quality of this is so much better its embarassing - well done its a pity you dont do 720p all the time - im very impressed"
,daveo76,2010-10-16T04:27Z,The video is excellent quality but the audio is only in mono sound :( 
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-16T08:23Z,"@daveo76: You mean: ""I HAVE mono sound. What i have been doing wrong?""

My answer would be:

READ fucking Description, moron."
,daveo76,2010-10-16T10:44Z,twentyforty: no need for the foul language. I did read the description before. I use a stereo system with loud speakers connected to line out on my computer. I use VLC player. I downloaded another copy of this movie and it plays in stereo 
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-16T10:58Z,"@daveo76: OK, then you are liar. Feel better now?

BTW - morons are those who have problems that majority have not - but from stupidity cannot form the question and ask for help.

So - dwarf - fuck off or learn some manners. You called me a liar (fucking .nfo states STEREO) and got what you've deserved. 

Never ever come back. Watch your steps."
