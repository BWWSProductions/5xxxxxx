The Secret Handshake - Night & Day (2010) [320k_Mp3]

[Intro]
For the past several years, Luis Dubuc and his one-man band The Secret Handshake has penned and recorded scores of songs by himself. His fusion of sugary pop hooks, laid a top a host of samples and caked with computer-enhanced effects had become Dubuc's signature electronic-pop sound and landed him the sort of success that many artists in indie circuits could only wish for. 

Enter Night & Day, which holds fast to its title's pronouncement of seemingly polar opposites. The gripping melodies are still firmly in place but are influenced by the wide ranging Motown scene of the '60s and '70s.
