"The Body and the Bounty"

After a skull and decomposing hands are found 
in a dumpster, the team must not only solve 
the crime but also search for the rest of the 
victim's remains. Identified as Ray Raminsky, 
the victim turns out to be a bounty hunter in 
search of Charles Braverman, a man indicted 
for the murder of a co-worker. Meanwhile, 
Brennan is asked by Professor Bunsen Jude 
"The Science Dude" (guest star Grier) if he 
can shoot an episode of his children's show 
from The Jeffersonian Lab with Brennan as his 
special guest. Brennan initially turns him 
down, but is surprised when he makes her a 
deal she can't refuse, so she takes him on as 
a new "squintern." As the team pieces 
together the details of the crime, they 
discover that they are not alone in the hunt 
for Braverman and find themselves in a chase 
with an unexpected suspect.

Enjoy :)
