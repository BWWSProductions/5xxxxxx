,wolfbane3,2010-10-23T20:32Z,"one small question, i have actually been considering putting this here for some time:
all the ps3-team rips come with the black bars at the top and bottom. why not just get rid of it? theoretically, wouldnt that reduce the file size slightly, which in turn might help cram in a better bitrate for the main video space itself? or is there a technical reason behind it?"
,halfmonkey,2010-10-24T08:25Z,"Short answer - Don't know! - I follow the instructions by one of the the original members on how to rip. The blu-rays they are ripped from have the bars though too. Not all do - Robocop, The Fly etc (older films) are full screen without the bars. In theory if you remove the bars the aspect ratio would change and would probably look skewed."

,wolfbane3,2010-11-09T16:25Z,"well, i play a whole bunch of hd movies in mp4 format on the ps3 which r full hd with the black bars removed (as in 1920 pixels horizontally but less than 1080 vertically), and the aspect ratio works beautifully as the ps3 itself automatically adjusts the remaining space and makes it black."
