,TraumaHound,2010-10-22T05:03Z,"Awesome, thanks! Now if only the tv series eps would get uploaded..."
,kleftisaa,2010-10-22T09:23Z,"FAKE FAKE FAKE!!! Bullshit Torrent!!!

ASSHOLE!!!"
,Anza-Power,2010-10-24T09:03Z,"FAKE, Not DVDRip, THERE IS NO DVD FOR THIS SERIES, these are just the WebRips put together in one mix, the aspect ratio is wrong and the sound goes out of synch at the second half of the vid."
,kleftisaa,2010-10-25T04:10Z,"My apologies..ha ha
Not a fake as I stated above.
Cant comment on the quality as AnzaPower has done but it is the real deal."
,jherrmann,2011-07-01T13:21Z,"OK, definitely not a DVD rip. Looks like it's the micro-episodes, with suspicious similarities to a torrent I downloaded from elsewhere."
,CakeMonster,2012-04-27T02:02Z,"Nice video, people need to read the description more often

BUT things gets out of sync about 1 hour and 10 min in or so you then need to change to 500ms sound so that the sound is played earleir

This can be done in VLC player which is free by pressing the J and K letters"
