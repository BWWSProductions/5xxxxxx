,lekkeralgemeen,2010-10-11T18:53Z,Should there be any difference in quality because you use another program? Specs are the same so I don't know what could be different :P

,deftones69,2010-10-11T20:34Z,"Thanks OOO for the upload.

In regards to the difference in quality, This appears to be much crisper than previous releases. 

Many wont be able to tell a difference in quality when viewing on a handheld device with a 2 inch screen, But for those of us that view these handheld releases on say a ps3 or an ipod to tv via an a/v adapter this is where the difference can be seen. As I stated the video is much crisper and not as grainy as previous releases I have come across when viewing on TV. 

Thanks for all your hard work and trying to tweak your uploads to give  us the best quality possible. "
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-11T21:01Z,thanks mate :) I see a person thinks it bad quality.. I think its better then any other release ive done before. it plays on my ipod 2gen so it should play on all others too.. ipod touch is the most bicthy handheld device when it comes to video lol deftones69 thanks again for the comment =)

[T],on.off.on,2010-10-11T22:37Z,i dont know if i will do this.. cuz it takes 3 times longer to encode like this lol... crazy stuff

,VampireGirl_84,2010-10-12T08:38Z,Hey is there any way that you could upload this as a m4v file so it will play in itunes.  This file only plays with quicktime.  Thanks =)
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-12T12:22Z,hey VampireGirl_84 try renaming the file to m4v. personally ive removed itunes from my pc... i hate it lol.. 
,VampireGirl_84,2010-10-13T04:59Z,on.off.on it wont let me change the file type.  And I use itunes for my ipod touch.  I have loads of movies and stuff stored in it and I know how to use it.  But thanks I will try to find it else where I hope =)
