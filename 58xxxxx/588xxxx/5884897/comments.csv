,motley666,2010-10-15T11:48Z,"Use power iso, search in google, it's free, you'll create a virtual drive on your pc and then you will load/mount the virtual cd and install the game. When everything goes fine burn the original file."

,motley666,2010-11-07T03:44Z,"@ kzrockz

Well, the site separates the games by genre and every game has a spec tab to see, but i agree it could be a lot of search. If you don't mind playing older games (i think you shouldn't and your pc can't handle 2010 games anyway) i could suggest you far cry, fear, doom 3, condemned: criminal origins, max payne, undying. For sports you can check older versions of fifa and pro if you like football or football manager if you like management games. Some of these games have demos, so you could try them out. But you don't mention the vga that you have."

,motley666,2010-11-07T19:54Z,"@ kzrockz So, i guess you have a laptop. Try the above titles because they are all great. Add quake 4, call of cthulhu, return to castle wolfenstein (it's free), chaser, indiana jones and the emperor's tomb, ubersoldier, nosferatu, prince of persia trilogy, kill.switch, second sight, psi ops, flatout, rallisport challenge. I am sure you will like many of these games, and they can be found on this site."
