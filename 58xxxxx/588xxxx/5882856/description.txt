6 minutes of ideal truly random white noise. 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, stereo.

I used the randomness data from random.org to make it.

I play it in loop mode through my headphones when I want to isolate myself from outer sounds without putting too much fatigue on my brain.

Don't compress it with MP3 or any other lossy codec! True white noise is the only thing in the world that can't compress.
