   The invasion of Iraq began in March 2003. The President of the       
   United States, George W. Bush, claimed he wanted to remove a         
   dictator who is armed with weapons of mass destruction, and liberate 
   a people. Instead the invasion provoked a bloody insurgency          
   resulting in the death of thousands of civilians, massive troop      
   casualties, and at the same time laying the ground-work for the      
   arrival of Al Qaeda in Iraq.                                         
   Made for Quicksilver productions by                                  
   producer Sam Collyns, the series tells the story of Iraq not simply  
   from the point of view of the invaders but from the insurgents who   
   fought them. It tells how fundamental strategic mistakes made by the 
   Americans pushed formerly peaceful Iraqis into the arms of the       
   fanatical Al
