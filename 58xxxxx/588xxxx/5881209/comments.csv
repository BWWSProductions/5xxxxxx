thx for your help :)
this ways everything worked... you saved may life :P

absolutely great game.
the story mode is boring but the fighting part is incredible.
especially if you have a friend who plays with you :D"
,TruePyrate,2010-10-18T04:04Z,"Hmmm...seems to be ripped from the wrong Region...Its not PAL Its NTSC so if you live in America and own a American 360, your just gonna be wasting a Verbatim Disc.  I should of believed what my abx360 GUI was telling me. XD

DONT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE A AMERICAN PAL CONSOLE!! THE DUMAZ THAT UPLOADED THIS POSTED THE WRONG REGION...It wont work and its not fixable or patchable. Thanks for trying though *dumaz* "

,NekoBones,2010-10-20T01:27Z,"@ TruePyrate

No offense buy you're the dumbass not the uploader (AiTB)..... PAL is Europe..... E.U.R.O.P.E.....

NTSC is for America (could be only north america) but i dont really care as im in the uk and i use PAL.....

so its pretty damn obvious that this wont work on an american xbox 360 as its a PAL rip not a NTSC / PAL or Region Free (RF) rip

learn about this stuff please next time before you rant and badmouth probably the most reliable xbox 360 game uploader on the net"
,vivek87,2010-10-21T12:35Z,"@ TruePyrate

u r the one who is dumbass..dumb..dumb..AiTB is one of the great uploader so far.."
,Haluwasa,2010-10-29T15:14Z,IT works legit
,kdallas2010,2011-01-07T05:28Z,"Hi does anyone have a valid SS/DMI combo for this release?  2+ months and the NTSC XEX is on the verified list but nothing for the PAL release :(

If you or someone you know if involved with uploading to abgx for verified retail rips... PLEASE can you get this on up there.

cheers!"
