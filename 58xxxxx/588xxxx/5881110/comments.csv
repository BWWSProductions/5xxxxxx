,6oxtynin9,2011-12-28T04:32Z,"@psmods, Hey psmod, FUCK YOU!!!!! Stop spamming and clogging up every single PS3 torrent comment box with your bullshit. No gives a fuck about your webiste. There's better and more older/experienced sites like psxscene, ps3iso, etc. Leave the comment sections to those who really need to use it.

@isomaker, you need a disc in the optical drive

@siddhu93, If external, plug you external HDD to PC via USB port and drag/drop the folder BCES00795 into the ""GAME"" folder of your External HDD. If there is no ""GAME"" folder, create one. If internal, FTP the files into your ""GAME"" folder of your PS3 HDD. Long process so I'm not going to explain how to FTP - Google ""FTP to PS3""."
,rusty252,2012-03-22T04:28Z,You need to rname the directory to BLES-00795 for it to work
