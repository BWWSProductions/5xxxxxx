John Huling-Canyon Spirit

Canyon Spirit by John Huling is a melodic Solo Native American Flute Music CD played with true heartfelt emotion. Canyon Spirit was recorded "live" amongst the Native American ruins of the Ancient Canyons in and around the Canyonlands of the Great Desert Southwest. There are no other instruments...just the sounds of Native American Flutes and nature.
The Native American Indian ruins of the Anasazi, who lived deep in the canyons and high amongst the mesas and plateaus of this mystical Southwestern landscape, provide the perfect Spirit Music for tranquil meditation as well as a contemplative backdrop for these exquisite Native American flute songs.
