Security Certified Network Specialist (SCNS) - Tactical Perimeter Defense Training 3 DVDs




This certification is the starting point with the Security Certified Program (SCP). SCNS is a required pre-requisite for going further towards the SCNP and SCNA certifications. The SCNS focuses on the critical defensive technologies that are the foundation of securing network perimeters, such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and router security. This certification tests the candidateâ€™s ability to work with, and implement, real world security technology. To become SCNS certified, candidates must successfully pass one exam. This exam is named: Tactical Perimeter Defense (TPD). The exam uses number: SC0-451.

This is the official training SCNS exam and is designed to validate the foundational skills required by security professionals. These skills include, but are not limited to: Network Defense Fundamentals, Advanced TCP/IP, Routers and Access Control Lists, Designing Firewalls, Configuring Firewalls, Configuring Virtual Private Networks, Designing an Intrusion Detection System, Configuring an Intrusion Detection System and Securing Wireless Networks.
