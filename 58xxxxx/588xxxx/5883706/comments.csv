,warmage247,2010-10-13T23:06Z,"Hey nano! thanks for all the help but a lot of these commands do not work, Im almost crying to stop this damn antigrief mode, Look I do what you say I use izarc to open minecraft_server.jar and I copy in all 5 files from the folder minecraft server orginal but when I close the zip program and try to run it, it says invalid or corrupt jar file..... why couldnt you just removie it? everyone said the same from the last upload im not being ungrateful its just so frustrating that it wont work!"
,NanoEntity,2010-10-13T23:44Z,"you only need to copy the files if you want anti grief off, and why you would want to do that?

People will be able to burn everything to the ground and mess up your whole world.

You should play Single Player, then host servers."
,iTzGooGle,2010-10-14T01:52Z,when i go to login it says that i need to login online before i can play offline... what do i do?
,NanoEntity,2010-10-14T23:59Z,"You installed the game wrong

Example:
Win7/Vista
""C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\""
.minecraft

XP
""C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\Application Data\""
.minecraft

,Codz1,2010-10-15T02:53Z,does this not work on windows?
,NanoEntity,2010-10-15T08:08Z,"Works fine on windows, you need to have java installed, as its java game."
,Dartrus,2010-10-15T10:50Z,"Whenever is starts the sound is off, an when I try to turn it on it freezes...

Any suggestions?"
,NanoEntity,2010-10-15T15:04Z,"Update java, update sound drivers, update GFX card.

Good idea to install Nvidia PHYSX
And latest OPEN GL.

Remember when hosing server, you need at least 2GB or more ram, else its not gonna run well."
,M4st3rM1nd,2010-10-15T18:26Z,"Dear NanonEntity,

I thank you for this wonderful tool.
It really helps me and my friend playing this game for fun. Now I wondered 2 things and I hope u are willing to help me with that.

1. For some reason everything has god-mode. I cant kill creatures, animals or hurt myself by lava or falling. Is there away to turn this ""god-mode"" off?
2. One of my friends is frequently having java-problems. If I write them down would u mind helping us fix them if u know the awnser to it?

Oh and I will report any bug or problem I find here or wherever u like, that is if u would like that.

Kind Regards,
MasterMind"
,Lowhunter,2010-10-15T20:49Z,"Thank you very much! Works well in singleplayer, but multiplayer's TNT is laggy. When I activate the TNT with redstone wiring, it will disappear (the TNT). It will make a hole on the ground, but I can't see any effects or hear any sounds. How could I fix this problem? I usually play alot with TNT cannons, but its hard to see the firing distance if I can't see the dynamite. Thank you in advance"
,NanoEntity,2010-10-16T12:24Z,"God MODE
Thats how the retail game is, i cant change that, complain to developer of minecraft.

TNT
Only admins, mods can use, and only you hear the sound when you explode it."
,M4st3rM1nd,2010-10-16T13:19Z,"Dear NanonEntity,

Is it supposed to be that skeletons nor pigs can die? For players being unable to die is something i can understand a little bit. But for players to be unable to kill skeletons and pigs? Isn't that odd? Because we can't ever get pork that way and the single-player doesn't have this ""god-mode""

Kind Regards, MasterMind"
,M4st3rM1nd,2010-10-16T13:21Z,"Dear NanoEntity.

About this God-mode. Are u meaning that players are invincible or that everything is too? Because I can't even kill skeletons nor pigs. I can't ever get food or hide like this. Isn't there someway to undo this?"
,just-khalid,2010-10-16T17:02Z,someone help me i download the game and i play the game but there is no sound i can here dirt walking but i can't here the sand walking and the WORST PART is i can't here the MOBS i can' here the zombie caming all i here from him it just dirt walking so CAN SOMEONE EXPLAINS TO ME WTF IS GOING ON ???!!!!!!!  
,demetri33,2010-10-16T21:59Z,"No sound fix. . . Only way is to unplug or disconnect from your Internet network. Press login and it should say can't connect to minecraft servers, press play offline and now you have sound =] you can reconnect after that. Enjoy. "
,Daevan,2010-10-16T22:38Z,"What NanoEntity is trying to say is that the game is still being developed by the creators... 

Currently in the multiplayer the developer has yet to add damage to yourself or the various other creatures inhabiting the game. That should be addressed in the next few releases hopefully. Your game isn't broken that feature has just yet to be implemented."
,warmfart,2010-10-17T01:28Z,"How come when I put something in the chest for multiplayer, it disappears after I log out?"

,bbqrawr,2010-10-19T17:55Z,how do i transfer my save to this update? does it transfer automatically? or do i have to start all over again?
,NanoEntity,2010-10-20T00:04Z,"Single player?
\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves

MP
There are no saves, only server admin has it."
,pr0otten,2010-10-20T01:19Z,"Something is wrong with this. This is all i got.

1. Changed the ip to my own. Can't connect to my ip. So i use VPN.

2. My friend connecting to the server. He get kicked out another time because of wrong password, but it's the right password.

3. Chatting in the chat. He write in the chat, get disconnected and a lot of error writes to my log.

4. Removing of block with no admin access. Can't remove them. Because something is blocking it.

5. Promotion and group commands. Write the commands. A lot of error writes out, if not a nice crash appears.

6. The cuboid and the stick command messages out ""no command"" When using them.

And i use Windows XP. So the server works but a lot of bugs."

thanks,

First of all, thanks! 
Secondly, I'm wondering how I proceed to make my patched server (1.2 game client) work with the mods you have? i.e I like how I can use commands like ""/item 4 64"" and ""/time day"", but now with the newest update, I can't. (I've bought the game, yeah. But want your great mod working on my real server.) 

Thanks in advance!"

I have this same problem too, same with my friends, we both have Java installed because we can play minecraft. I've also tried re-locating Java it still doesn't work. Is it corrupted? I used the previous version fine, but this is buggy for me."
