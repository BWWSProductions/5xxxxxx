I really enjoy K.Flay and I intend to pay for this album once it becomes available in Canada by ways other than iTunes.

If you like K.Flay, please pay for her music! She's not a rich greedy lazy whore living in a mansion, but rather a well educated (and actually talented) starving artist. "

Indeed, Flay is DIY from top to bottom, and performs *completely* solo live.
Yeah, I'm surprised that this was released *only* on iTunes and Amazon MP3
Single and Famous (collaborative EP with MC Lars) and Digital Gangster (MC Lars/YTCracker collaborative LP where K. Flay features on a few tracks) are both in-print in CD form"

,Imperator42,2010-11-06T00:37Z,@Avarik: That's the kind of thing I'm here for. :)
