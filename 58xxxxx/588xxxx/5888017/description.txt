"(4) if you like the new album, share it with someone."

K. Flay new material - 5 track EP, with a remix of the MASHed Potatoes track Crazytown that I added to the collection.

256kbps .m4a (except for the 1st track, No Duh, which is here in 320kbps .mp3)

FLAC version - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6031419
I am now seeding that torrent instead of this one (although somebody else might still be seeding this one)
