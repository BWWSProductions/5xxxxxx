PHAROAH SAUNDERS LIVE AT THE EAST
Impulse! Catalogue # AS-9227
Released:1971
Format:Mp3@320



One of the most spiritual albums recorded by Pharoah Sanders for Impulse â€“ an open-ended and free-thinking exploration of ideas, all very much in the late John Coltrane mode! The group's a largeish one â€“ filled with spiritual soul jazz luminaries who include Hannibal Marvin Peterson on trumpet, Harold Vick on tenor, Carlos Garnett on flute, Joe Bonner on piano and harmonium, Cecil McBee and Stanley Clarke on basses, Norman Connors and Billy Hart on drums, and Lawrence Killian on congas and percussion â€“ all working together beautifully, with some of the same spirit as the larger jazz ensembles on the Strata East label! Sanders' magnificent tenor is at the helm of the album â€“ pushing, urging, and directing the players with a strong sense of vision â€“ and although live, the album has the same sort of intimate intensity as the best studio sides by Pharoah for Impulse. Titles include "Healing Song", "Memories of John W. Coltrane" and "Lumkili".
