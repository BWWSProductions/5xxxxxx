Nobody I went to high school or college with, or know in the real world, today, acts this juvenile, emotionally retarded, or stupid, as these kids.

This show is absolutely entertaining, except my experience with people who watched MTV in the late 80's when it stopped being a music video channel showed me that there are latchkey kids and fatherless children who actually seek to emulate what they see on MTV.  

That part really scares me about this show.  There are children with little parental or adult guidance who probably believe this is a cool way to be and actually will emulate this sort of idiotic, emotionally needy and melodramatic behavior.

If so, god help us all."
