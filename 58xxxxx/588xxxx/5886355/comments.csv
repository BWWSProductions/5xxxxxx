,sxp64,2010-10-15T22:11Z,"Yet another transcoded upload. It would be kind of you to mention the actual source, so we can decide for ourselves if quality has improved. Stacked encoding never improves on the original quality. especially not with destructive encoders.
And you state that you've used H264. Why not use x264 then? It's even better."
