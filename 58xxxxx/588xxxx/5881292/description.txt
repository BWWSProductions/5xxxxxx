                    New three-part series of the gripping crime  
                    drama. DI Chandler, DC Miles and the team  
                    investigate a series of brutal killings and  
                    maimings. Local history expert Buchan suggests  
                    that London once more has a copycat killer -  
                    only this time the murders mirror killings by  
                    the Kray twins in the 1960s. Miles and Chandler  
                    refuse to believe Buchan's theory since the  
                    Krays are both dead - but is Buchan on the  
                    right path?
