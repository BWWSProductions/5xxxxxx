 Season 10, Episode 4: Insiders

The SGC-base is approached by an al-kesh glider which lets itself be taken down, so they can capture Ba'al, who offers to exchange the necessary information to find Merlin's weapon for human help to eliminate his clones, which want to kill him. They mistrust his story, as does NIS-agent Malcolm Barrett, who however fails to take over the investigation. Since the captive might actually be a clone, several missions to different planets retrieve and capture all clones, but which is the real Ba'al, and what are his true intentions?
