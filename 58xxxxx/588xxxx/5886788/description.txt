I have been told there was a file corruption problem with the previous upload of this, it still worked fine on my computer so i'm not sure about it, but i've taken it from the original file again and redone the torrent. if anyone still has problems with opening it you can download it here as well: http://www.yeahpunkrockcheers.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/storiesfromplumland.pdf
(if you wonder why i didn't edit the original torrent, the edit function resulted in an error)
