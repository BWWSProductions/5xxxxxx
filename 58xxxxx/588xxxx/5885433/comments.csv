I registered just to post this and warn you all.
I used it twice and got an email (with my real and correct details!!) warning me of copyright violation.
I uninstalled and deleted it just in case.... don't need that shit.
You have been warned."

[V],big_dad_e,2011-01-08T00:24Z,"Oh, another ""me too!"" comment from a user that has nothing to share except ignorance.  Ever hear of a firewall?"
,strogganoff,2011-10-10T06:15Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL: There are harassment suits and complaints in many countries about the makers of this software. It hacks and harvests your email address (even though you don't use it when entering the serial) and then you get nasty emails about copyright violation etc. Firewall makes no difference. Just google acetools.biz if you don't believe. Many people just pay up (59.95) because of these bullying tactics but just ignore them, or report them to the relevant body in your country. What they do is illegal."
