       Since the case of Baby P, there has been a 40% increase in the 
       number of children taken into care by the state. There are now 
       70,000 children being 'looked after' in the system. What happens 
       to them? Can the system offer them a better life?
       
       Panorama follows children in the care of Coventry Social Services 
       for six months to find out if the state can be a real parent - 
       even though children in care are more at risk of failing school 
       and committing crime than any other group.
       
       Narrated by Samantha Morton, who herself grew up in care.
