,btfan13,2010-10-20T19:19Z,Why is this 720 version so high in mb totaling over 1 gig to where others make just as equal in quality 720 versions that are only approximately 750 mb.  Sorry but this file is just WAY too big and completely unnecessary to be that large.
,mcshadokane,2010-10-25T19:50Z,any chance of info on season 2 episode 5 cant seem to find anywhere..?????
,strangerbarry,2010-11-07T17:25Z,Does anyone have S02E03 ?
