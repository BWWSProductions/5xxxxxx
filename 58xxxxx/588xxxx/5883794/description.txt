Wrap Around Joy is a 1974 album by American singer-songwriter Carole King. The album hit
#1 on the Billboard album charts in the fall of 1974 and spun off successful singles with
"Jazzman" (#2 pop) and "Nightingale" (#9 pop as well as #1 adult contemporary).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 1974, while Carly and Joni were battling it out for top honors amidst the proliferation of
female singer-songwriters at the time, Carole King released "Wrap Around Joy", a mostly
joyful pop-rock entry into the fold, showing that she was still one of the mighty queens of the
rock world.

Of course her endeavor was tremendously aided by the huge hit single, "Jazzman", with Tom
Scott's memorable sax performance; but "Wrap Around Joy" has many other noteworthy
songs.

Carole's power piano chords of the sing-along opening cut "Nightingale" (a second top ten hit
for her from this album) really capture the listener's attention right from the get-go. "My Lovin'
Eyes" and "You Gentle Me" are wonderful pop-rock confections, as is the title track and
"You're Something New", one of my favorite Carole King start-of-love songs ever.
Conversely, "You Go You're Way, I'll Go Mine" is one of the best break-up songs I've ever
known.

"We Are All In This Together" is a great song of unification of the human race and is,
therefore, quite an IMPORTANT message still today in this mad, mad, mad, mad world in
which we live. I love the optimism of this song especially when balanced with the closing
song, "The Best Is Yet To Come", which never fails to lift my spirit. Songs like these make me
very grateful to Carole King for the solace her music has given my life on so many occasions.
Listen and see if you don't know what I mean.
