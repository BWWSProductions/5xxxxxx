Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit VMWare Virtual Appliance (created w/ an ISO image found here on TPB, but can't seem to find the direct link any more).
Clean and Pristine - no 3rd party programs.
Windows Genuine Advantage pass and no activation.
I use various iterations of this when supporting my Windows-using clients.
