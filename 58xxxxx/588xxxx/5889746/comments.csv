,MKVF,2011-06-04T11:34Z,"This won't download on Linux.  Transmission gives a ""Filename too long"" error.  A bit of research (Googling 'transmission filename too long'"") shows this is a Linux-wide problem.  Could someone who has DL'd already reseed with a shorter filename please, maybe not repeating the full name of the main file in the enclosing folder? Or moving credits and so on and placing in a text file within the folder?

Thanks anyway to the seeder."
