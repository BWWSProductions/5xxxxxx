TV's Frankie Boyle has declared that no-one over 
40 should do stand-up, as the old comedians lose 
their edge and their anger. Stewart Lee is 42 and 
Frankie's heartless Scottish words have made him 
wonder if it's worth carrying on.

Undaunted, the furiously baffled comedian tries to 
win round the legendarily harsh Glasgow audience 
with a crowd-pleasing Mcintyre-style routine about 
coffee shops, but is distracted by scores of imaginary 
pirates; he tries to talk about every day middle aged 
men's concerns, but is drawn into a forty minute rant 
against Top Gear and all it stands for; he attempts to 
find some common ground with happy childhood memories 
that he and the audience can share, but is instead 
consumed with loathing and despair as a result of a 
Magners' Cider advertising campaign.

He screams from the balconies, stumbles in the aisles, 
and ends with a country and western song. If You Prefer 
A Milder Comedian Please Ask For One is a vast and 
all-consuming epic of stand-up comedy, exploring the 
absolute formal limits of the art form. 

There are also some jokes.
