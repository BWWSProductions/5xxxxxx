,robforce,2010-10-14T13:34Z,"After 15 minutes the movie skips forward 15-20 minutes... :S
Can someone please up this release again? Because the audio was really great on this one."
,suepernatural,2010-10-17T21:35Z,"Do not download!

missing a big chunk of the movie about 10-15 minutes into the film which is a real shame so I have deleted this torrent & advise others not to download as it's an important part of the film missing."
,rr127c,2010-10-20T09:00Z,"It does skip about 15 minutes of the movie, BUT if you keep watching after about 10 minutes after the skip, it DOES go back and show everything it skipped. So it does have the whole movie. Just skips...then goes back, it's weird."
,suepernatural,2010-10-20T11:48Z,"have checked rr127c previous comment & it does appear to go back but there must still be some missing bits because the film goes back after 10 mins but not to the point it skipped from.  The actual movie is just 80 mins long & this torrent is 75 mins so still 5 mins missing.  
I think I'm gonna wait for dvd to be released because the quality is ok for a cam but a bit blurry so you can't see details properly which I reckon would be important in this film.
I'd rather wait & watch it properly."
