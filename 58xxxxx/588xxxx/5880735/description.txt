     Ã› Ã› These French knights bring both fame and infamy to the         Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› province of Gascony: they are great swordsmen, but are also    Ã› Ã›

     Ã› Ã› Ayyubid Bowmen are infamous for their speed - and their        Ã› Ã›

     Ã› Ã› After a series of devastating defeats, the commanders of the   Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› Crusader army formed these unique archer units. They fight     Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› like normal archers, but have received additional training,    Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› that they can readily defend themselves in hand-to-hand        Ã› Ã›

     Ã› Ã› When Emperor Barbarossa passed through the Kingdom of Hungary, Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› he personally asked the brother of the king to join his        Ã› Ã›
