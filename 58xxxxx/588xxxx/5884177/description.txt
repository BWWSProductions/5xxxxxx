Ava has returned from a weekend in Vegas and has been locked out of her place by her now ex-boyfriend. Clarke is the next door neighbor who invites her inside out of the heat. She explains that she got a little drunk at her friend's bachelorette weekend and might have sent some inappropriate texts and pictures. Clarke consoles her and tells her she will be just fine. Ava must still be in the mood because she tries to kiss Clarke, who like a true gentlemen rebuffs her advances. But when she wants a man, no one can resist her charms.
