ur rips play beautifully... watched italian job , step up 2 & checked black hawk down & get him to greek on it... all were gr8... with no video or sound issues... "
[V],prashant22,2010-10-16T16:56Z,"thanks DSIN...really gr8 to know that these small sized rips work well on 32inch...
u really should try my iron man and the a team...those r really good rips i hv done...and daredevil n sleepy hollow too...i mean all r really good...
it must be a good experience to watch on 32inch..."
[V],prashant22,2010-10-16T17:01Z,@all a little bit of delay in inside man...it will be up by 11(IST)...
,DSIN,2010-10-16T19:07Z,"@prashant : i have dloaded them too... A team & sleepy hollow i.e, 
just haven't checked on TV...
yeah its cool to watch movies on bravia with its home theater features...... but i can watch only high quality rips on that...otherwise it gets pixelated...
