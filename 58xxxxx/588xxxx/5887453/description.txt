Pilot :
Kung Fu Master follows Tan Zong, one of the greatest kung fu experts on the face of the Earth in the midst of what looks like feudal China. Hes just been offered a new job, as the drillmaster of the Grand Commandant. But since Tan Zong is a Buddhist, hes not too interested in making ultrapowerful soldiers, so he intends to refuse the Grand Commandantâ€™s offer. The Grand Commandant, meanwhile, isnt the type to take no for an answer, and as such, he plans a warm welcome for Tan Zong. Thus, in order to refuse the Grand Commandants offer honorably, hell have to fight his way through a swarm of attackers to reach his goal and defeat a host of villainous kung fu masters to protect his people.
