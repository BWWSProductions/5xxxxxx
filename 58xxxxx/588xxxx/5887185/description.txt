--OVERVIEW:      Finally, a version of uTorrent that you can bring with you anywhere (on a USB Drive)! This version stores NO files on the PC that you run it from, it only stores them on your USB Drive. Great for use at school, work, or anywhere!



--CONTENTS:      Contains uTorrent (version 2.04), a folder for your downloaded torrents, and all setup files (has already been setup; just transfer to a USB Drive and go).



--NOTE:          As you run this program, more files will be created (telling uTorrent what was going on last time you used it). Don't be alarmed, as these only help it run faster. Also, the .torrent files that you begin downloading will be added. Again, don't be alarmed.  *IMPORTANT*  -  Do NOT delete or move any files that uTorrent creates! This will cause it to become inoperable! Just leave the files alone and don't move them out of the 'uTorrent Portable' folder.



--OTHER:        This is the newest version of uTorrent, so it should work wonderfully. If you have any questions, leave them in the comments. Please seed, as other people seeded this for you. Just return the favor by seeding for others. Thanks!
