,Kagirinai_Kisu,2010-11-14T06:27Z,"Omg, please seed then dont make another torrent until you can seed them. I hate when people make super popular torrents then just abandon them n stop seeding, wasting time and bandwidth. Im stuck @ 87.5% I will seed eternall if you could only seed for a few hours n let me get the rest, like please. though most episodes r done having 3 or 4 missing from each season sux. PLEASE SEED for the love of all that is good in this world, lol, please seeeeeeeeeeedd!! Please?? Pretty Please? I'll _"

After two days of no other seeder than I it's moved a.1 so mabye if I just leave it forever it'll finish somehow? PLEASE SEED. SEEEED SEEEEED and then never upload anything again please unless your gonna SEEED. you ruin it for everyone."
,ninjaman79,2010-11-18T00:58Z,I have been downloading this for 2 weeks now and im stuck at 87.2% the loser who uploaded this has abandoned it. Your an absolute loser d9dga
,Kagirinai_Kisu,2010-11-20T11:48Z,"this is rounding week 3 for me. i just leave it on incase ever comes back, dont really take any bandwidth. Is almost complete, if you look most eps dwnlod 100% then u just got go back and dwnload individually the ones u didnt get, its like 1-2 eps max per season and uTorrent eaisly shows u which didnt complete in the files tracker. not too bad for hd qual 21 seasons, ive got 87.8% and will seed until he ever comes back I guess. "
,d9dga,2010-11-21T14:22Z,"ninjakid, it's  not stopped seeding since i made it, 250kB/s for over a month.  i'm doing my part for the community, do yours"
,ninjaman79,2010-11-22T00:02Z,Your full of shit d9dga you have not been seeding at all mate! Your a liar and your torrent is dead. I deleted mine this morning it has taken way too long to download. So now i know never to download anything you put up d9dga! LOSER! wasted my downloads! 
,tripper511,2011-01-03T02:53Z,ninjaman79: your an idiot.  I've already gotten this 100% and have been seeding.  Maybe you just have a shitty computer and cheap isp.  Or more likely your just a noob because then you would have of had 100% long before me.  Also nice job that you bitch about no one seeding then just leave after getting 3/4 of the torrent.  You yourself are hippocrate and a leecher.
,wullie7362,2011-05-10T05:44Z,"I'm going to go for this as I've got bits and pieces of different series, would be nice to get the lot!"
,wullie7362,2011-05-12T17:37Z,"I hear everyone bitching about not seeding, i bet when they finally got it they seeded at 20mb/s or less, I've been downloading for 3 days and it pretty slow even though there is 9 seeds on at present time.
I have a 20mb/s broadband and a good lap top and my download speeds for torrents is normally between 200kb/s and 600kb/s but with this it has never went over 200kb/s."
,wullie7362,2011-05-12T17:39Z,"Sorry, i meant to say they must be seeding at 20kb/s or less."
,egoplayer,2011-09-11T11:21Z,"Great torrent, i'm still seeding !"
