                    The Nightmare Man. Part 1.               
                    Children's science fiction drama series,  
                    following the adventures of investigative  
                    journalist Sarah Jane Smith. When Luke has his  
                    first nightmare, he's haunted by a dark figure  
                    from his dreams. A strange entity is reaching  
                    out to our world, with terrible consequences  
                    for the whole human race. Luke faces     
                    life-changing events, and Bannerman Road will  
                    never be the same again.
