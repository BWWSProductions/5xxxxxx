21st century. USA. The second civil war. The whole country is in a state of emergency. What was formerly called the American Congress now rules with fascist methods. There is only one city free left, Steel Harbour, headquarter for the resistance. This is the hometown of Barb Wire, owner of the night club Hammerhead. As times aren't good, Barb has a second job.
