An early morning trip to Heathrow airport fills the candidates with hopes of a sunshine getaway, but they are disappointed when Lord Sugar tasks them with designing and creating a brand new beach accessory. They must create something completely original, with an eye-catching poster to promote the product, before pitching to three big retailers in the hopes of securing orders and avoiding a place in the boardroom. At the day's end, one candidate will be fired.
