,Shadow-Hulk,2010-10-14T21:28Z,I apologize... This is not the high-res version.. The last movie I uploaded was in HD and without thinking I clicked High Res. Still good quality though.
,RC_Ebooks,2010-11-10T06:21Z,"This movie is based on ""Fahrenheit 451"", which is a counter culture classic, not that your liberal H.S, teachers with their gay agenda would have mentioned it."
,Shadow-Hulk,2010-11-17T02:28Z,I just double checked it.. The audio is in sync. Maybe something wrong with your player / PC? It was fine for me...
