"Pretty Good at Drinkin' Beer" is the title of a song written by Troy Jones and recorded by American country artist Billy Currington. It was released in May 2010 as the lead-off single to Currington's upcoming fourth studio album entitled Enjoy Yourself.

The song is an up-tempo tune, in which the narrator claims that heâ€™s not good at most of the normal things that men are known for: fixing cars, mowing grass, working hard, and cleaning windows, etc., but he is "pretty good at drinkin' beer".

Bobby Peacock of Roughstock gave the song four out of five stars, and said that the song is "another pleasing, low-key charmer in a rapidly growing repertoire." Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song a B+ and a positive review, stating that compared to other drinking songs, "this one matches the pace of the kind of drinking heâ€™s talking about." Karlie Justus of The 9513 gave the song a thumbs-down, saying that it "plods in circles without any sort of reward for listeners" and that its lyrics were "neither memorable or catchy," but also said that its "honesty and simplicity boosts its authenticity."

"Pretty Good at Drinkin' Beer" debuted at #48 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts on the week ending May 29, 2010. It also debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at #83 on the week ending June 12, 2010. It also debuted at #94 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart for the week of July 15, 2010.
