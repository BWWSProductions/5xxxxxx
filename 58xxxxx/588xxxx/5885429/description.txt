Bill Maher, creator of the immensely popular late-night talk show        
Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher and host of the HBO hit series     
Real Time with Bill Maher, displays his celebrated, biting wit in the    
HBO Comedy Special, Bill Maher: Be More Cynical. Doing what he loves     
most, stand-up comedy, Maher rips through a horde of contemporary        
topics, from the evils of big government to the bewildering power        
women have over men, and delivers a landmark performance that            
re-affirms why he is one of today's brightest and most revered           
comedians.
