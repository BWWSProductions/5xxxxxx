"Jailbreak"

When a vital CIA hard drive goes missing, 
Steven (Boris Kodjoe) and Samantha (Gugu 
Mbatha-Raw) must travel to Dublin, Ireland 
in search of a prisoner who holds the key 
to its location. Following leads, their 
mission takes them to England, where they 
go undercover at the London Philharmonic -- 
with assistance from Leo (Carter MacIntyre) 
and Hoyt (Ben Schwartz). Meanwhile, 
Samantha begins to question whether or not 
she and Steven should speak about their 
pasts and Lizzy (Mekia Cox) invests time 
and money in the catering business.

Enjoy :)
