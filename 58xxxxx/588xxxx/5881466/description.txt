An Arizona State University Student has found herself in some trouble with the school over an audition tape that she had sent to a pornographic website.

Elizabeth Hawkenson of Copperas Cove, Texas, was reportedly paid a $2,000 advance for the video shoot. 

The reason that she is facing rift from the school is that during the filming she showed her Arizona State University student identification card.

The video was sent to school officals by an unknown source. Once it was confirmed that it was indeed Hawkenson, the school put into motion the possiblity of revoking Hawkenson√¢
