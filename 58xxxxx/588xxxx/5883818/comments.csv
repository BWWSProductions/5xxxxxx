,NitrogenUA,2010-10-13T18:16Z,I beg you pardon me for not releasing this one for so long. Piratebay was in maintenance so i was unable to upload my torrent. But as always i'm glad to share the love. Enjoy this highly anticipated title ;)
[H],HeroMaster,2010-10-13T18:34Z,"@NitrogenUA hello there buddy, i just want to ask to a question, how did you get your image hosted, from which site, how did you upload your torrent image."
,NitrogenUA,2010-10-13T19:05Z,"Let's see. While uploading your torrent you have to also upload your own picture (cover, whatever) to TPB's picture-holding service: http://bayimg.com/
And then put the last part of given link into respective field: ""Image tag from bayimg"". I.e. if you have link like http://bayimg.com/my_pic_code, you have to paste ""my_pic_code"" into that box.
Cheers."
