Coming home from the store, Dyanna is accosted by a mugger in her own driveway. Her neighbor Rocco lives a few houses down, and seeing the altercation, comes to her rescue, and fights the guy off. During the fight Rocco getÃ¢Â€â„¢s a black eye, so she invites him into her place for an ice pack, and to express her sincerest gratitude. Being a nice guy, he explains that heÃ¢Â€â„¢s just glad sheÃ¢Â€â„¢s ok. The thing is, sheÃ¢Â€â„¢s feeling extremely grateful, and like a good woman attending to her man after battle, Dynna lays him down, and demonstrates her own attack moves on his young cock.
