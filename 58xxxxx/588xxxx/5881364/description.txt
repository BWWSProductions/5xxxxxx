Mr Weller is the clever man who penned his first hit while with The Jam in the early 70s,
and after a prolific career as a solo artist he releases 'Hit Parade', combining material
from his Jam and Style Council days to 2005. Released to coincide with a high-profile fulllength
BBC documentary, 'Hit Parade' features 23 of his biggest hits, including seminal
anthems like 'Town Called Malice' and 'Going Underground'.
