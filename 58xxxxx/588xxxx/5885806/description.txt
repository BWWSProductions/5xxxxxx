Comedian Bill Maher's Tony Award-nominated Broadway standup show,      
Bill Maher: Victory Begins at Home, will return to New York, July      
17-19, 2003. The final performance at the Hudson Theatre (which is     
not technically a Broadway house though it's in the midtown theatre   
district) will be filmed live for HBO. In the show, Maher addresses     
contemporary political, social and cultural topics -- Iraq, President   
Bush and the so called Axis of Evil. The opinionated Maher said about   
Victory Begins at Home: "We've heard everything about the War on        
Terrorism except what we can actually do to help win it. The           
government used to do that for us through propaganda (the positive     
kind) posters, so taking my cue from the great old posters of World     
War I and World War II ('Loose Lips Sink Ships,' 'Buy War Bonds,'       
'Plant a Victory Garden,' etc.) I commissioned artists to paint the    
posters our government today should be putting out to help us win    
this war."
