,zoull,2011-10-29T22:46Z,"For those asking, you have to have a flashed 360 to play any burned games. Also it needs to be burned on a DL DVD in order to fit all the data, that's what the .dvd file is for that abgx360 creates, it tells imgburn where to split the data to the layers. Hope this helps, for the rest wondering, once I've downloaded I'll let you know what the region is."
