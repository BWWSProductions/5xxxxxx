,EpicPlayer,2011-02-25T13:37Z,"Excuse me, does any1 knows if I can burn a CD from this image and use it instead of any crack:

With version 1.3, i have major network problems when i play in LAN with my friends and your drift scores aren't multiplied in drift battle. -_-

With 1.2, ( Typical problems ) I can't save my first race in career mode and I can't enter drift races.

While 1.1 is too old; nobody on internet in 1.1 and missing multiplayer events.

BUT... I know that the 1.2 problems are BECAUSE of the crack so I'm asking U guys, can I burn this image on a disk and use it as a true official copy of GRID, which software should I use ( for burning ) and which kind of image ( if not this one ) should I look for ???"

Can anyone tell hat the problem may be?"
,nishantratlia,2011-04-01T04:17Z,"@bbscorpion This can be because there is no configuration details for Windows 7 with the game. As it is a pretty old game of 2008, it wouldn't be having settings for it."

If your game crashes, you need to install the latest openAL.

Works in wine also.

A controller is not a must but its helpful... i played this on xbox for ages and even the first time using a keyboard i was just as good. You will probably want to remap the keys to AWD (And down arrow for brake so you have more flexibility) and when exiting a corner its helpful to tap accel a few times so you dont just spin out (Since you cant feather the throttle without a pad)"
