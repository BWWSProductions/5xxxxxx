Race Driver: Grid is the most recent addition to the TOCA Touring Car series, which is published and developed by Codemasters.

This is the PC version, conveniently packaged with the latest update (1.3) and patched executable. No tedious extracting of RAR files.

*** Installation instructions *** 

1. Mount the image (MDS) with Daemon Tools or another image mounter of your choice,
2. Install the game (no serial number required),
3. Install the version 1.3 patch (gridpatch_1_3.exe)
4. Extract GRID.exe and rld.dll,
   - from RACE.DRIVER.GRID.V1.3.ALL.RELOADED.NOCD.zip
   - to the folder where you installed the game
5. Play!

Seeding would be greatly appreciated.
If you like this game, please consider paying for it.

*** Please note ***

A decent controller is a must!

If your computer is running the game at a low framerate, you will want to try this:

Go to your documents folder, navigate to Codemasters, GRID, hardwaresettings, and open the file "hardware_settings_config.xml".

There you will find the line: 
 postprocess enabled="true" blur="true"

Change both to false, like so: 
 postprocess enabled="false" blur="false"

Or mix and match to find a setting you like.
