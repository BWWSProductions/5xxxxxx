,1TWISTED,2010-10-14T13:23Z,"thanks,.. nice job,.. well done,.. ; )"
,kadeem1fox,2010-10-28T02:48Z,"Why do there needs to be new versions? Once we run our current version, isn't WAT gone indefinately?"
[V],NoExcuses,2010-10-28T07:31Z,"@kadeem1fox
It's gone until M$ doesn't send out another update that locks it back, then you need a new fix. And so on..."
,kadeem1fox,2010-10-30T02:14Z,ok thanks
,kadeem1fox,2010-10-30T02:25Z,"By the way, how often do they send out updates that locks it?"
,Aquahutch,2010-12-04T03:48Z,"@kadeem1fox

I think the hammer went down today. My Win7 is saying I'm not genuine again. I'm going to try this latest version of RemoveWAT and see if it has any mojo left."

,Eagleti,2011-02-23T23:29Z,"win7 sp1 

It worked in win7 with SP1, after i uninstall KB971033."
,DrScruggs,2011-02-24T06:44Z,anyone know if it's safe to download Windows 7 SP1 after using this?
,FUCKFARTS,2011-02-24T09:58Z,"this actually works with service pack 1, if you already have removed WAT; restore WAT and then remove it again, worked for me! Windows 7 Ultimate x64"
,paranormalguy,2011-02-24T16:27Z,works very great
,constipatriot,2011-02-28T06:57Z,"Fuckfarts is right! Worked like a charm on previously cracked Win 7 x64 ultimate when SP1 rendered my crack DOA. 

WAT was already removed with the older crack.

Restored WAT, rebooted
Windows showed update 1033 as not having been installed. I hid this update before but I suspect SP1 installs it. Hid it again.

Removed WAT, rebooted, no more trial info under my computer>properties!

Thanks to Hazar, Fuckfarts, and uploader! I'll post again immediately if anything changes."
,.tpb-dude.,2011-03-02T19:52Z,"Thanks, clean and working !"
,Sna7ch,2011-03-10T21:45Z,"I used RemoveWAT 2.2.5 and my Windows was fine, after installing SP1, it gave the non-genuine crap.

I tried to use RemoveWAT 2.2.5 and is just does not open, downloaded 2.2.6 and it does not open either. I double-click the file and nothing happens.

Can anyone help me out?"
,Sna7ch,2011-03-11T21:00Z,"Ok, I got it to work.

If anyone else has the same issue I did. You need to be fast with RemoveWAT. So here's how I did it.

I placed removeWAT.exe on my desktop. Restarted my PC, logged in. Got 2 messages from windows regarding Activation. Went for Ask me later and OK.
As soon as I saw the icon for RemoveWAT on the desktop I ran it, hit RestoreWAT, OK. Once it was done, reboot.
Repeat the process for RemoveWAT, and you're done.

I did quite some restarts... it only seemed to load before all my services were up. If I took a couple more seconds I couldn't have done it.

Hope this helps someone."
,sukhoi87,2011-03-14T14:10Z,"Originally I cracked using RemoveWAT 2.2.5.
The crack stopped to work after apply SP1, giving 30 days to activate.

I restored WAT using the same RemoveWAT 2.2.5.
Rebooted.
Removed WAT again using RemoveWAT 2.2.5
Rebooted.
The message to activate gone.

Worked on Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bits.

----
RemoveWAT 2.2.5 have no virus according VirusTotal.com
Version 2.2.6 (under this torrent) show virus according a number of anti-virus softwares. Maybe are fake virus alert.

,wykydtron,2011-03-22T21:06Z,@Sna7ch disable your anti-virus or exempt the file.
,simz04,2011-04-07T00:45Z,"Works fine with my win 7 x64! A huge thx to the guy who did the app and the uploader!!!
"
,abhi_next,2011-04-09T23:18Z,tried it.. ur a life saver!!
,constipatriot,2011-04-13T08:48Z,"I had to use this again after today's ton of updates. Still works fine. Scanned with Avira and Malwarebytes just to be sure, both came up clean."
,KLVTZ,2011-04-17T08:09Z,"EVERYBODY! THIS DOES WORK FOR WINDOWS 7 SP1 BUILD 7601 x64! I had to install WAT and Remove it TWICE! So if it doesn't work for you the FIRST time, do it again, and again till it works. It does work! The first time i tried it got rid of the pop ups, but not the bottom left text, i did the reinstall and remove WAT -the second time was a charm! 
BTW you may be wondering if it worked or not, try installing an update, if it installs your genuine, also its pretty obvious when your text on the bottom left is gone. moreover, if you still have a black picture, just change it!"
,pirato_se,2011-04-22T19:47Z,"thank you, it works!"
,error133,2011-04-24T16:37Z,i restored wat and removed and when the remove is completed i restarted my pc . usually without the removewat i got the pop-up to activate the windows 7 and i go the little message bottom right it says '' This copy of Windows is not authentic'' when i remove i dont get the pop-up but i still got the message bottow right ''This copy of Windows is not authentic'' anyone can help me please ???
,sangoku11,2011-04-26T13:37Z,"Works great on Windows 7 - Ultimate with SP1!

Thank you!"
,constipatriot,2011-05-01T09:36Z,"error133, this happens to me occasionally also but only when I restart my computer and after several hours pass. If you rt-click My Computer, go to Properties, there will be no info about activation or registration at all, and the message in the bottom corner will disappear. Just check the properties every time you reboot (2 clicks, no big deal) and it won't come up. If it comes up, this will make it disappear."
,yarisdude,2011-05-26T18:15Z,"It works but you are stuck with the ""This copy of windows is not genuine"" on the bottom right of the desktop."
,zzzziiipp,2011-05-27T03:21Z,"Downloaded this. Worked fine with W7 64 (Swe) and all updates where installed. Not SP1 though.

Next step: I tried do download the Virtual Machine for W7. It consists of a number of steps. When trying to download ""Windows XP Mode"" (the first step after having the BIOS in order for the VM) it stopped because you have to download and run the ""WindowsActivationUpadte.exe""-file and doing so the OS doesn't validate and you can't come any further with the installation process of the VM.
Does anyone have a solution to this?"
,mickardon,2011-05-30T02:09Z,"worked perfectly (again) after SP1 update, thank you."
,brodazunino,2011-07-26T00:45Z,"The WAT works in Windows, my Windows 7 Ultimate x64 is now activated but Windows Security Essentials say : This copy of windows did not pass genuine validation. Same Problem as RemoveWat v2.2.5"

,rani9990,2011-12-17T20:05Z,Will this work on Windows 7 Enterprise x64?
,iwanthelpusually,2012-02-21T02:22Z,i have a problem: i downloaded a windows operating system and i started it with a virtual machine and now its asking for the product key. i havent downloaded this WAT thing yet but.. what procedures will have to be done to make this work for me? or is it as easy as downloading it and running it... i have a hunch its not only because i think id have to somehow put it in? my virtualbox.. which i cant do because i cant even use the virtualbox disk unless i fully install an operating system.
