,Raukan,2010-10-15T13:35Z,Is this the british show? Or is it an american version? The air date says Oct 15 2010 and the first season of the british version has already aired. I'm confused.
,kgvg988,2010-10-17T08:39Z,Great work TV team - I have been trying to get this in 720 for ages. Raukan FYI this is the british version.  This upload is better resolution than the others uploaded on TBP. You can get only Ep 6 at 720 here; http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5225870/Misfits_S01E06_720p_HDTV_x264-BiA
