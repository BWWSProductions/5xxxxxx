,Medevila,2010-12-27T18:19Z,Is this Redux?! You have 1979 in the title as well as Redux...
[T],murdoc47,2011-01-20T14:42Z,why on earth did you cut off the credits?
[T],murdoc47,2011-01-26T21:36Z,"i was informed the blu-ray version doesn't include any credits. i think it's better that way, no intro credits, and no end credits.
the title can only be seen hidden in the movie (for copyright issues), when they reach kurtz's place. it is painted on a wall: ""our motto: apocalypse now"""

I opened in VLC player and the subtitles were on, but then I realized I could turn them off in one of the VLC player top menus.

Thx"
