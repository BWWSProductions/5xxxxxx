,scarreddragon,2010-12-08T09:03Z,"Having trouble playing the files using VLC on a Mac OS 10.6.4... any suggestions?

Tried messing with the VLC preferences with no results, and also tried Perian with Quicktime also with no results.  I get about three seconds of sound and a weird grayed out video then it all just stops and crashes the program.

If there is no way to play it, could someone upload as .avi if it isn't a bother?

Thanks for any help!  And thank you for the vids even if I can't play them (yet)!"

I hope you make it.
