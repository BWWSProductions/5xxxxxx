After saving the file, double click that registry file to add it in your registry and voila!! the trial program is unlocked for full functional use forever.
But donot forget to prevent it from updating by blocking its internet acccess from the firewall!

I found this trick from a chinese website, because unfortunately this great software wasn't released in the english sites yet so I'm doing it.
For optimal voice result, download Neospeech Julie or Kate or Jeniffer.  They sound like real females, and not like the robotic Microsoft SAM.
