[T],ctang,2010-10-16T01:41Z,"thank you and your welcome!!! i will probably just do dvd9's from now on since i dont have time to encode...this week kicked my ass (its a labor intensive job)...this week just makes me want a career job even more

anyone know of any entry level (well i have about a year experience) GIS/Cartography jobs...i have a bachelors degree in geography/math with emphasis on work with ArcGIS ArcInfo 9.x

wow this is sad i have to basically put out a personals ad on TPB but im desperate (oh ya, i am willing to move or to do part time work)

i currently have some obligations to another torrent site but will get to those requests when i can (by obligations i mean i am currently trying to get my torrent fully seeded on that site...its a private site)"
[T],ctang,2010-10-27T01:09Z,"i owe it to everyone to let them know why i havent uploaded anything on here for a couple weeks...i am uploading to private sites right now until all the supreme court hooha passes...i figure right now big business is really probably trying to find someone to make an example out of and i dont want to be that person so until this blows over a little bit i wont be uploading dvd's here (may be a week or may be a month but im sorry)...check back for a status update or perhaps my next torrent...it may be sooner than expected when i say fuck it and just do it anyways

,razzamaztaz,2010-11-03T16:16Z,"I'm downloading this now, let me ask, I got a dual layer burner, and I do have verbatim dua layer discs I've never used, should be possibly to simply burn straight off right? I assume this bigger file means better quality? Sorry for dumb questions, I'm hopeless at tech stuff"
[T],ctang,2010-11-03T20:56Z,"everything you asked the answer is yes

now a days almost every dvd that comes out is DL (larger than 4.37GiB or 4.7GB...depending on whether or not you have Mac OS X 10.6+ or anything else) which means that they can put more on the disc and not lose quality of the main feature"
,razzamaztaz,2010-11-04T11:32Z,"Thanks! Wish more uploaders would do big files then, good quality files are hard to find"
[T],ctang,2010-11-04T16:51Z,if you really want quality and quantity you have to go to the private sites for dvds...thats where its at
[V],bubanee,2010-11-09T07:27Z,wow.. thanks matey.. i just read your comment just now on my katy perry torrent.. CHEERS! :))
