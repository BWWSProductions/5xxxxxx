I remember in 1964/68 when the Kinks were at their height watching them on Top the Pops
each week and thinking what a great songs they were .

This is a great collection of their songs and you can crib as I would have liked Well respected
Man but how can you beat songs like Waterloo Sunset?

The first few bars of Waterloo sunset as so distinctive and put a chill down your
spine.Similarly with sunny Afternoon it summons up sunny afternoons in the summer with the
sun beating down and your on holiday.

They were the quintessential English group along with the Small Faces and I remember the
Brit pop characters like Damon Albarn saying how much they liked and admired the Kinks.

They were an integral part of the sixties and ray Davis is still playing at places like
Glastonbury and the V festival so another generation have the opportunity of hearing his
great songs.

All their great songs are here from You really Got me to Days and far as as their late period
and Lola.

This CD is a must for any fan of British pop music of the sixties.
