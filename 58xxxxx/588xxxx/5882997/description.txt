It's all there at the very beginning, thanks to Kidd Jordan, New Orleans'
septuagenarian saxophonist, teacher, and leader; drummer Hamid Drake, who,
despite leaving the Crescent City decades ago, still understands second-line
rhythms; and William Parker, bassist extraordinaire, who plays a startling array
of singing bowls, gongs, and even the talking drum on this session. In the 56
seconds that are "Peppermint Falls," the album's opener, all the elements are
there, up front, and waiting to peel the layers off the onion of sound. Jordan
swings in everything he does, whether it's the lonesome blues singing at the
commencement of "Forever" or the startling intensity of "Unity Call." It's about
song and sound, the notion of singing through the horn, expressing what the
Indian, North African, and Congo shamans have been singing about for
centuries. Certainly this is jazz; it lives in a post-Coltrane aesthetic -- the
one of discovery, not imitation. The bowed bass beginnings of "Living Peace"
suggest, from the relative calm and quiet of the first two tracks, that the
edges will become a noticeable present tense in this music. But there are no
edges, despite the moan-song of the horn, the bowing and the skeletal inverted
notion of time that Drake stretches to its breaking point. What breaks are the
defined notions of the pianoless jazz trio. This is a triangle where texture,
balance, and color become the points at which sound itself can be expressed
without distraction or notional individual identity struggles. This is music
that just is, as jazz, as blues, as folk music. The culmination of the trio's
art is in the album's final cut, "Last of the Chicken Wings." Never has out jazz
sounded so recreational. The percussion work by both sidemen is stunning,
carrying a series of Yoruba rhythmic inventions into the joy of the moment. When
Jordan gets into his Ornette thang, playing the same catchy phrase over and over
again as the percussion gets louder and more insistent, it's an expression of
joy. And that's what Palm of Soul is, an expression of spirit joy, one that is
rooted in the breakdown of time as a construct, and jazz as an independent
form. In fact, if this trio proves anything on this date, it is that jazz is the
music that carries within it -- or at least can and should -- all the musics of
the world. Brilliant.
