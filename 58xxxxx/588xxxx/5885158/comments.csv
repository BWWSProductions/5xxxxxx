,Arbans,2011-07-01T22:21Z,"Hello there, Rev-x. I have been looking for a nice torrent of Johnny English that has playback on an iPod. However, I find 1.3 GB to be too space-filling. I was wondering if there is a chance you can uploaded an encoded one that's not at 720p, but still decent quality at the size of 300-700MB? Thanks."
,pb67508,2011-07-15T11:36Z,"Hello Mr.rev-x, a very BIG THANK YOU for an AWESOME RIP :)

I am seeding this one indefinitely for 18 hrs a day :D

Audio is GR8
Video Quality is Awesome
Good to download !!!"
,vivatpb5776,2011-08-06T18:34Z,Very good audio and video quality. +1 for true 720p screen resolution. There is slight pixelation during the first opening scenes but that does not take away from the overall effect of the movie. Thank you uploader.
