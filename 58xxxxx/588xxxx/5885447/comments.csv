I tried uploading a couple of ""Fulldvds"" but not enough downloaders to keep something that big alive for very long, most downloaders like the smaller files. I will do everything I can to keep the re-encoded files looking like the DVD (Fluid motion, dark contrast levels, etc.) but right now I can't do much more than expand the bandwith well past the popular ""701 MB"" standard. I'll continuing doing what I can to make picture quality the first priority, any re-encoding hints or tips would be considered helpful."
