,Hamzi99,2010-10-19T12:28Z,Excellent movie but i think 2.54 gib is too much! most of the rippers (brrip) does it in 1 gib and i know 1 he does it in 800 mb!
,eXoflow,2010-12-30T22:01Z,"BRRips should be at least 2GB, otherwise use a DVDRip for gods sake man! Don't complain!"
,BetterThanLife,2011-03-09T02:31Z,"On the contrary, 2 GB isn't enough!"
,BoonDockSaiNt30,2011-08-17T18:02Z,"Right! Brrip should be even higher! Thanks for keeping it low, low. :-)"
