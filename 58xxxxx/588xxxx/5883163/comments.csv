[T],rjordan21,2010-10-13T16:49Z,This looks fantastic THANK YOU.  I've never burned an ISO file to disc before.  This looks like it'e all 19 cds at once?  How would I be able to separate the individual cds to fit them on a disc?

I would use Power ISO was something similar where you can look inside the ISO and then extract the files you need that way you can do them individually.
Hope that helps"
[T],rjordan21,2010-10-13T20:01Z,Thanks oneanight I'll give it a try as soon as the download is finished.

[T],rjordan21,2010-10-14T18:19Z,I hate  to be a pest here but after opening the ISO file with Power ISO I've gotten FLA files which I can't seem to do anything with.  Someone help please! I'm dying to listen to this!
[T],rjordan21,2010-10-15T23:19Z,This sounds fantastic.  Thanks again Webchella.  A word of caution though.  This ISO file contains unlabeled folders and files of FLA files. I had to manually change the ext to FLAC for them to play AND rename everything as well.  I used the free version of Power ISO to extract the ISO file so maybe that had something to do with it.  If anyone else has had a different result with this torrent I'd love to know what you did.  In the end the BEST sounding discography on cd I've heard.  THANKS AGAIN!
