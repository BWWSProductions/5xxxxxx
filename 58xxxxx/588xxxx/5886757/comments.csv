,lekkeralgemeen,2010-10-14T19:28Z,Sorry about my last comment. I just can't get the .m4v files to work with 2 different subs with 2 different languages. Do you have any idea how I can add a second subtitle while the option to enable subs on iPhone stays?
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-14T19:31Z,hey mate.. you could try using mp4box to add the subs :)
,lekkeralgemeen,2010-10-14T20:06Z,"I did, I  always use MP4Box to add the subs. However, when I added 1 sub, it will show in iTunes. When I add a second sub of another language it doesn't show in iTunes anymore, none of the subs. However both show in VLC... How is this possible? I got this with all subs I try to add. Any idea what the problem might be?"
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-14T20:45Z,hmmm sounds like u have to re-encode the movie completely and incl. the subs :)
,prank0007,2010-10-14T21:12Z,"thnks 4 this

,asdfgwer,2010-10-15T23:04Z,@lekkeralgemeen u have 2 hardcode one of the subs cause ipods only support 1 srt file...
