,Fabe.1,2010-11-04T20:46Z,"It Says ""BDRip"" On The Title And Yet People Are Rating The Quality With 9s?"
,shiningwiz,2010-11-05T13:57Z,"What exactly is a ""BD"" Rip?"
,DigitalEXP,2010-11-07T01:46Z,BD=Blu Ray
,suckitfromtheback,2010-11-08T03:23Z,I find this hard to be BR if its only 700megs.
,ejspur,2010-11-09T08:14Z,"I'm pretty sure it means the 700 meg divx was ripped from a Blu-Ray source. At least, that's what one would assume. "
,Beachienos,2010-11-10T12:04Z,"Thanks so much !

,renars132,2010-11-23T17:09Z,"BD Rip = Blu Ray Disc

How can this have been uploaded on the 14th when it was released on 22/11/2010... I went and bought it yesterday.

Unless it was released earlier in the US"
,smumdax,2010-12-03T15:16Z,"Please, do your homework people... You might be new, we all were one day or another, but some comments are just plain clueless.

This is a BDrip in Xvid, which indicates that it was ripped from a Blu-Ray disc, into a a standard Xvid file, which usually go 700 Meg for a less than 2h movie, and around 1.4 Gig for a 2h plus movie.

So...
1- No it is not bluray, it's just from a bluray source.
2- Yes it should work fine on a DivX DVD player, because Xvid is similar to DivX
3- @Renars132: as it relates to the date... *sigh*... Some movie clubs actually put out their movies a couple of days before the official in-store release date. And for a movie to be in-store at XX date, then they've received it a couple days before, meaning it was shipped from the wharehouse a couple days before that...Anyone working in those companies can have the movie well before the release date."
,uglyrtard,2010-12-04T03:24Z,Shame Renars132! he (smumdax) got you there aye aye aye shame on you name shame aheme shame
,BuffaloRoam,2010-12-11T09:35Z,one more fact about release dates... sometimes overseas countrys get released before here.. just a thought

,mebiz,2010-12-17T04:15Z,have downloaded plays on computer but it says file too big for disc new to this and need HELP frustrating
,mebiz,2010-12-17T04:18Z,HELP have dowloaded and sound great video great on computer but says file too big for disc wot to do??
,M3Gmachine,2010-12-23T03:24Z,"when it says file is too big for disc space, it generally means that your computer's memory (or whatever) doesn't have enough room on it for whatever you are downloading. Which means you may want to delete some files to make room for any new downloads. My computer does the same thing. I don't have a whole lot of ram (memory), so I have to delete things every once in a while. "
