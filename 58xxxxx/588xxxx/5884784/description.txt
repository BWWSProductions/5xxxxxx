Detectives Benson and Stabler arrive on the scene where a woman is found dead in Bethesda Fountain. When her squeaky clean image doesn't match up with her promiscuous actions on the night of her murder, ADA Mikka Von encourages the cops to dig deeper into her past. When they find out that the woman was poisoned with toxic mushrooms, they suspect a crazed activist and professor is responsible. As the case develops, Benson and Stabler go to dangerous lengths to ensure that justice is served.
