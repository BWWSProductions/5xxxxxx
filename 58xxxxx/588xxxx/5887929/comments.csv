,cheeser180,2010-10-16T00:05Z,"Wow, I didn't think this book would be up so quickly. Fast download, too.

The format is epub, but I used an online converter to convert it to PDF.

Great book, thanks!"

,drumrobot,2010-10-17T22:18Z,"Thanks! Formatting is perfect; the linked table of contents is a bonus.
For those who don't already have software, try Adobe Digital Editions (http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/). It works on Macs and PCs.
Also, you can drag it into your iTunes library to read it in iBooks on an iOS device (assuming you have all of these things)."
