"Harbor City"

When former surf champion Trevor Knight (Yves 
Bright) returns home to help his ailing mother, 
it ultimately results in his untimely death. 
Initially, Detectives Rex Winters (Skeet Ulrich) 
and Tomas "TJ" Jaruszalski (Corey Stoll) are 
lead to believe that it was not only a robbery 
gone wrong, but possibly an inside job. 
Meanwhile, DDA Morales (Alfred Molina) has a 
feeling that someone related to one of the 
suspects knows more than they are telling and 
goes to unusual lengths to flush them out.

Skeet skeet skeet all over some rat's face.

Enjoy :)
