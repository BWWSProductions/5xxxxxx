Monty Brewster is a second-rate minor league baseball 
pitcher with the (fictional) Hackensack Bulls. He and his 
best friend Spike Nolan (John Candy), the catcher for the 
Bulls, are arrested after a bar fight, but cannot afford bail. 
A stranger (posing as a photographer) offers bail, and asks 
them to come to New York with him. At a Manhattan law office, 
Brewster is told that his recently deceased great-uncle Rupert 
Horn (Hume Cronyn) - who he's never met - has left him his 
entire fortune, but with several conditions.

Brewster is challenged to either take $1 million upfront, 
or spend $30 million within 30 days to inherit $300 million. 
If he chooses the former, the law firm becomes the executor 
of the estate and divides the money among charities 
(after taking a sizable fee). In the latter case, after 30 days, 
he may not own any assets that are not already his, and he 
must get value for the services of anyone he hires. He may 
donate only 5% to charity and lose 5% by gambling. Neither 
may he buy expensive goods and destroy or give them away. 
And he's not allowed to tell anyone, even Spike. Monty decides 
to take the $30 million challenge. A paralegal from the law firm 
must accompany him to keep tabs on all spending.
