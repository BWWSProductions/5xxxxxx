,lekkeralgemeen,2010-10-14T16:43Z,"I got a request, can you please add subs externally to your torrents, like HR does, so I can add subs by myself?"
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-14T16:57Z,@lekkeralgemeen  N/A means not available... if theres subtitles ill include them in the video file for users of ipod/iphones to enable. Im sure u can find the subtitles on the net somewhere.. tbh if u dont like what i do then dont download its as simple as that. dont mean to be an ass but extracting the subs from the mkv source takes a long time and alot of times it doesnt work. a good place to look for subs are all4divx they have alot of subs =)
