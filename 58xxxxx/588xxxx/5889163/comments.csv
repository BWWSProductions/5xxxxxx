Iv burned 4 of these for me/friends, ALL WORK. What Discs are you using and you DONT HAVE TO! but it helps me when i unplug the ethernet cable as other connections seem to interrupt my burns.

P.S What firmware are you on? you need to be on 1.61 or over (Unless its an hitachi drive, 1.51)

Hope this helps, "

,1994GiOVANNi2,2010-10-18T05:03Z,Also no offense to the XBX ppl out there but preferably the pc version will be more epic :]
,LightSpeedNox,2010-10-18T05:06Z,"@tantura 

just a burner capable of burning to dual layers disks

p.s have been downloading for past couple days now seem to get about 50+ leechers and never get above 10 seeders and hardly ever go above 50kb/s as a result ive put a restriction on my upload....i dont upload more than i download until a torrent is finished.."
,kaliver,2010-10-18T06:57Z,I believe there's a release for XBOX and not PC because the PC version is attached to Steamworks and won't be decrypted until Steam unlocks the game on release day.
,1994GiOVANNi2,2010-10-18T10:34Z,"@kaliver
Does the game HAVE to be played in Steam?, or can you play without like with the windows live version? Actually is there any difference, to buy from steam, or to buy at gamestop without the use of steam?"
,deathbringerftw2,2010-10-18T13:36Z,rf or pal???
,iLikeRips,2010-10-18T14:04Z,"lol I'm new to this, how exactly do you burn this?
Is it just the dvd file or those files with an r followed by a number (e.g. r30). Please help :("

I'll just have to wait for PC version "
,akhil_great,2010-10-18T14:47Z,Its written for NTSC/PAL. I have an NTSC-J Xbox 360. Will this work on it?
,akhil_great,2010-10-18T14:51Z,will this work on ntsc-j?
,Gallynuke,2010-10-18T16:59Z,"For everyone having trouble with the ""Open Tray"" problem, don't worry, the burn probably worked but as someone already said, you have to open and close the tray a bunch of times and it will eventually load. No idea why, but this also just worked for me and I immediately installed it onto the hard drive so I don't have to worry about it anymore."
,kaliver,2010-10-18T17:19Z,Giovanni: Steamworks means it's integrated into Steam. Crackers will crack the steam_api but I believe they will have to have the game decrypted first. This is just what I infer from common sense.
,Sn0okk,2010-10-19T11:49Z,when is the PC version going to be up?

,Gallynuke,2010-10-20T18:08Z,"Okay, to build on my previous comment, for those people experiencing the ""Open Tray"" problem, instead of opening and closing the tray 30-40 times waiting for the disc to be read, if you open up the tray, put the game in and then tilt your Xbox slowly so it's almost vertical so that the disc tray and power button is high up at an angle. Emphasis on the word SLOWLY! Then, while holding the Xbox at this angle, take one hand and push the tray in fast and firm and hold it there. This should load the game on the first or second try. Definitely beats opening and closing the tray 30 some-plus times. Hope this helps! "
,Gallynuke,2010-10-20T18:11Z,"And for the thousandth time, it's NTSC AND PAL. It is a working torrent and the game is fucking fantastic as long as you liked Fallout 3. It's practically an epic Fallout 3 expansion but an excellent and fun-as-fuck one at that. I'll be seeding for quite some time so download away!"
,lDunKs,2010-10-20T23:16Z,anyone else experiencing game freezes at the first town? 
,choonb,2010-10-21T01:26Z,"So to be clear, I have to open one of the RAR files and drag the .iso file to desktop then use image burn to write it to a CD?  Is the .iso all I need to write to disk? or do the other files before the RAR need to be wrote on the CD too?  Please answer"
,Gallynuke,2010-10-21T03:41Z,"Choonb: Open one of the .RAR files and unpack it, then go to the folder where it was unpacked to and there should be a .dvd file in addition to the .iso file. Select the .dvd file and if you have burning software it should start up automatically for you. If you don't have burning software then I strongly recommend IMGBurn. It's free, easy to use and reliable."
,KingSuperbia,2010-10-21T07:32Z,"the 'open tray' issue happened with me as well... tried & tested experienced pirate... and yet i have no explanation for this... 

like someone said in a previous comment... after opening the tray and close the try a little more then 30 times... it finally read the game... normally i would have burned it again after reading through the comments... but i saw a least 4 or more comments with similar issues and outcomes... so i thought I'd give it a try... and sure enough after a little more then 30 trys (estimate)... it worked... 

not sure if I'd have to go through this again after taking the game out or turning my xbox back on (playing right now, don't wanna risk it yet)... but I'll give an update...

If this happens to you (it read 'open tray')... you can try this... or i would recommend trying another version (torrent)... waiting for a newer version (torrent)... JUST! BUY THE DAMN GAME!... wait for the PC version (torrent)...

someone also recommend... after doing the 'open tray' trick... and if/when you get it to read/work... load it to your hard-drive...

have fun...

,Gallynuke,2010-10-22T16:33Z,"No problem, Choonb. And to clarify one last time on the 'Open Tray' error some people are getting with Fallout: New Vegas, forget opening and closing the tray 20-30 times or tilting the frigging system every which way to get the game to load. I figured out my problem was the disc I had burned the game on. If your other burned games work fine and you're only getting the 'Open Tray' error on the Fallout: NV disc, then you should either try to burn another copy and if this doesn't work, definitely just get a different brand of DVD+R DL discs -- I just bought some Memorex at Radio Shack and it's working like a charm! And this will be the last time I give advice on this subject, I promise! :P"

,eNLogic2000,2010-10-22T18:05Z,"OK so i was getting unreadable disc error everytime i put the disc in.
