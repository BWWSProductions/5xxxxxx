,froogAL,2012-05-08T07:25Z,I've downloaded this file but am unable to either play it or burn it onto CDR.  It's there but I can't open the doggoned thing.  I've successfully downloaded and accessed about 30 other FLAC files and burned them onto CDR.  This is my first seemingly insurmountable problem...........froogAL
