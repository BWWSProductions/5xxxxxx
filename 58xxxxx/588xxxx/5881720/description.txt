I've compiled together Pitchfork's recent list of the Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s, as seen here: [url]http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7854-the-top-200-tracks-of-the-1990s-200-151/[/url].

I've found 320 kbps sources for all of the tracks except one.  Track 73, "Love Stepping Out" by Disco Inferno is a high bitrate VBR, but it isn't 320.

Everything should be properly tagged and ready to go.  Thanks very much!
