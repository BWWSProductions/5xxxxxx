- Republican Ex-CEOs Challenge Veteran Dems in California's Heated Gubernatorial, Senate Races

California's gubernatorial contest has already become the most expensive non-presidential race in US history. The billionaire Republican candidate, former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, has reportedly spent an unprecedented $140 million of her own fortune, nearly fourteen times as much as her challenger Jerry Brown, a longtime California politician, former governor and the state's current attorney general. Meanwhile, in California's Senate, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina is challenging three-term Democratic incumbent Barbara Boxer. We speak to Tim Redmond of the San Francisco Bay Guardian.


- Green Party Candidate Excluded from California Governor's Debate

While governor hopefuls Jerry Brown and Meg Whitman debated on Tuesday night in San Rafael, the Green Party candidate for governor was being arrested outside the hall. Police charged Laura Wells with trespassing after she tried to get into the debate that she was not allowed to participate in.


- Backing Prop 19, California NAACP Calls Marijuana Legalization a Civil Rights Issue

California's Proposition 19 would authorize possession of one ounce of marijuana for personal consumption by people twenty-one and older, legalize marijuana use in private homes, and allow marijuana growth in private residences for personal use. Supporters of Proposition 19 argue that legalizing and taxing marijuana could help the cash-strapped state and reduce arrests of nonviolent drug offenders, who are disproportionately Black and Latino youth. We speak to California NAACP president Alice Huffman.


- Environmental Groups Confront Oil Industry-Backed Attempt to Repeal California's Landmark Emissions Law in Prop 23

We turn to Proposition 23, a ballot initiative that would effectively repeal California's landmark global warming emissions law. Two Texas oil companies with refineries in California, the Valero and Tesoro corporations, launched a campaign to suspend implementation of the law until state unemployment falls to 5.5 percent for at least one year. We speak to the leaders of two environmental organizations opposed to Proposition 23: Michael Brune of Sierra Club and Rebecca Tarbotton of Rainforest Action Network.


- Ananya Roy on California's Education Battle and "Poverty Capital: Microfinance and the Making of Development"

Protests were held on several California campuses last week as part of the National Day of Action to Defend Public Education and Social Services. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger also restored some $300 million of funding following months of statewide protests, rallies and walkouts over the drastic budget cuts. We speak to Ananya Roy, a University of California, Berkeley professor who was a part of the Solidarity Alliance at the height of the protests earlier this year. We also speak to Roy about her latest book, Poverty Capital: Microfinance and the Making of Development.
