RELEASE NOTES

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a
virtual meeting place where people
from all over the world can meet and
talk you'll find the whole diversity
of human interests, ideas, and issues
here, and you'll be able to
participate in group discussions on
one of the many thousands of IRC
channels, on hundreds of IRC
networks, or just talk in private to
family or friends, wherever they are
in the world.

To use IRC you need a small
application like mIRC, an IRC client
for Windows that was written by
Khaled Mardam-Bey. mIRC is a friendly
IRC client that is well equipped with
options and tools.

There is no restriction to the number
of people that can participate in a
given discussion, or the number of
channels that can be formed on IRC.
As a user you run a "client" program
like mIRC which connects to a
"server" in an IRC network. All
servers are interconnected and pass
messages from user to user over the
IRC network. One server can be
connected to several other servers
and up to hundreds of clients.
