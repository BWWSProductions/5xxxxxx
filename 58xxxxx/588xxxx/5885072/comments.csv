,PhiberOptix,2010-10-15T22:59Z,I don't get it. It's a myth that the stormcahsers cars can hold up against tornados? They've already been in a tornado. So what's the myth here?
,MasterExploder22,2010-10-16T16:57Z,Thanks a lot! 
,wildwill2002,2010-10-21T06:00Z,The myth is whether or not cross-promoted program gets higher ratings.
