We have a quality highlighting on the other, however the set of good choices for Photomizer and good results makes Photomizer program to consider if we want to retouch your images. The cluster of well organized in an interface that is not nothing liosa for user options is something that strikes us. Photomizer gives us a good bouquet of effects and enhancements to our photos and we can access them in a simple way without having to wander through complicated menus.
Loads the image and make some tests with different effects of light, contrast, brightness, change size, orientation, and filters. Don't worry by the original image, will remain intact until you choose to save the results, so you can test it without fear.
All this also can do on a group of images and apply the same effect all at the same time, something which you save valuable time. Choose a same size for all, a tone or a frame and modify them all with a click.
Supported input formats are: JPG, BMP, TIFF and RAW (.raw, .crw, .orf,. 3fr, .tiff, .nrw, .nef, .dng, and the .raf. cr2 and .arw), while you can save the image how JPG and BMP.
