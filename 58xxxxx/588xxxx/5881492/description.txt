"Why Wait" is the title of a song written by Neil Thrasher, Tom Shapiro and Jimmy Yeary and recorded by country music band Rascal Flatts. It was released as the first single from their upcoming 7th studio album Nothing Like This, set for release on November 16, 2010. It is their first single released by Big Machine Records. It has debuted at #34 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts for the week of August 14, 2010.

The music video, directed by Billy Zabka, was shot around Las Vegas, Nevada. David Arquette plays the man in the video who proposes to his girlfriend. Rick Harrison of the History Channel original show Pawn Stars  makes a cameo appearance in the video when the Flatts and Arquette stop at the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop to buy an engagement ring. There are also cameos by Ron White and Penn Jillette.

Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song a four-out-of-five rating, saying the lyrics "may be 'cheesy' to some, but it fits right where we'd expect a Rascal Flatts song to go." Giving it a "thumbs up," Jim Malec of American Twang thought that it was a return in sound to the band's earlier albums, also praising the "great details and images" of the lyrics as well as Gary LeVox's vocals.

Rascal Flatts is an American country music band founded in Columbus, Ohio.
