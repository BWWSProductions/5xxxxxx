,Da Bastard,2010-12-21T18:03Z,Thanks
,LordTyrus,2011-02-07T14:46Z,Great video quality! Audio wasnt great but thats because of the movie itself. Downloaded with 300kb/s
,vevdare,2011-03-12T09:39Z,No words to thank you man...Gr88 master piece on such a gr8 restored quality..Thanks man thanks a lot i njoyed the masterpiece..keep uploading more classics thanks a tonne
,schroed4,2011-04-04T05:58Z,"Might just be my player, but the subs de-sync more and more as the video goes on... So if you don't know how to re-sync subs, and hate unsync'd subs, then try a different file. Also don't like the fact thats its mp4 format. MKV for the win! 
Gonna try the release by -jonny-. It has less peers, but higher quality and a +10 rating."
,nikotiini3,2011-04-08T15:16Z,I hate it how Blu-ray movies are so big in size. I do have lots and lots of space but it would be nice to download 3-5 movies instead of 1 with the same amount of Bits taken.
,ZombiePanda,2011-04-13T22:57Z,Great quality but those subs are annoying the hell out of me with the I's instead of L's. Dx
,Shlomir,2011-04-28T09:56Z,Can't you just modify the .srt file? Will mkv2vob mux them..How do I mux for PS3?
,Spinx3r,2011-06-11T12:55Z,"My WD TV Live won't open this file. Can anyone tell me why, so I can avoid similar files in the future!?"
[T],-Gabe-,2011-06-28T11:00Z,"Thanks!! Great restored film.
By the way, only the purple color was missing from these posts :)"
,lucas_kelly,2011-07-04T12:23Z,The English subs are not synced properly. 
,quinnjin,2011-07-06T10:44Z,"hi, for some reason, this refuses to play on any media player I have including VLC. S a waste of 2.3 gig download for me. It stalls, breaks into psychedelic, blocks of blur... completely unwatchable, am I the only person who has this problem with this file? for such a great film its a real shame..."
,woxyjr,2011-10-12T17:48Z,"Fixed subs

,ObscureClassics,2011-12-13T16:59Z,"Audio and Video are nice and high quality, but this comes with stupid subtitles. the word ""musket"" is replaced with ""gun"". ""...rape their women"" is replaced with ""take your women"", the word ""coward"" is replaced with ""chicken"", and many other stupid changes. "
,MixedUpZombie,2012-02-24T01:14Z,"seriously, these subtitles are retarded. download this version: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5909860/Seven.Samurai.1954.720p.BluRay.x264-EbP"
