,tacticalbread,2010-10-12T18:45Z,faaakkeeeeee. v3 is the latest patch.
,EduardoLorenzo,2010-10-12T19:25Z,"It may not be the newest version.. but it ain't fake..
I just dl'ed it.. Tried to play it with R4 but got a white screen, but it works on the emu..
anybody got an english patched game that works on R4?"
,EduardoLorenzo,2010-10-12T19:26Z,"Works on emu..
White screen on R4
anybody got an engish pathed version that works for R4?"
,Equinox117,2010-10-12T21:10Z,@tacticalbread. latest available for torrent download was v3... this IS a v6 patch! took a lot of hard work to get
,Chase-san,2010-10-12T22:31Z,"I assure you, as one of the translators on that project, there is no v6, we have some prototype versions for v4, but that is it. Nowhere new ready for a release."
,tacticalbread,2010-10-12T22:45Z,lol @ the comment from someone who is actually part of the translation team getting deleted. There is no v6.
,tacticalbread,2010-10-12T22:46Z,"oh nevermind lol, it's there now. lol anyway."
,Equinox117,2010-10-13T10:31Z,@ Chase-san. i got this from a member of the translation team
,Z_Pirate,2010-10-13T14:14Z,"I'm confused.  Is this fake?  Either way, how up to scratch is V3?"
,tacticalbread,2010-10-14T07:38Z,"@Equinox117: You're full of shit, and you've been found out, so stfu. As far as I can tell, this is actually v3. In v3, all Pokemon names, moves, Pokedex entries, and items are translated. The story is translated up to about the second town, and not many random trainers are translated. The game is perfectly playable in this state, though."
,Equinox117,2010-10-14T21:57Z,tacticalbread is the 1 full of shit
,Cyrez60659,2010-10-15T14:58Z,"Only a little bit of this game has been translated into English. 

Also, the game defaults back to Japanese upon certain actions (such as saving or talking to certain NPC's) with no way of switching back.

The game itself works very well but the translation is incomplete and what little is complete, is bugged.

I'd recommend waiting for the proper English version."
,Chase-san,2010-10-17T09:25Z,"If we had a v6, it would be released, since it isn't released, there is not a v6.

There may someday be a v6, but this isn't it."
,Sankou,2010-10-20T01:26Z,"I played Black a bit and it seems to work with the included emulator. All the important parts are in english. The b.s. no one cares about is still in japanese- like when your opponent loses and decides to cry about it. I can't confirm if it ever switches back to japanese. But, all in all, it's a good torrent. Thanks very much to all the translators and programmers who made the patch! And thanks for uploading Equinox117!

Will seed,
Sankou  "
,nokurwajegomac,2010-10-22T16:30Z,"98% of it is in Japanese, but pokemon names are in 'English' and items are translated as well, so it is very playable since the plot is identical to that of every game since red and blue came out."
,EduardoLorenzo,2010-10-22T19:31Z,"Oh.. this actually CAN be played on R4..
with firmware wood r4 1.14.2
but I still want a fully patched version.."
,Moonrage_RvG,2010-10-23T15:09Z,"it works!
i have a DSTT card with latest firmware (dstt update 6.321, including YSMENU). Be sure to turn the first two cheats on.

Thnx Equinox117"
,kandei,2010-10-25T17:37Z,English crapped out on me too. Delete the .ini file to enable in-game saves.
,NipRing,2010-11-02T23:03Z,Works on Acekard 2i with AKAIO 1.8.1
,RareNinja,2010-11-07T14:15Z,"i completed the v3 patch versions.....  this is more (only slightly) translated & come with cheats :) dont work on my r4... got sdhc  firmware. the firmware 'wood r4 1.14.2' doesn't work on my r4 so will have 2 play on pc :(

@ tacticalbread..... v3 is not the latest patch.... however v6 isn't released.... there is a legit v5 patch (this is that). the v5 patch wasnt made by the same ppl that did the others.... its a mod of the v3"
,ItsJazmin,2010-11-10T03:21Z,how do i use the cheat thingy? o.o
,kain109,2010-12-08T11:43Z,not fake but out dated v7 is the latest english patch 
,KNP1995,2010-12-15T15:02Z,"how do i get this thing to work on a dsone1 card? i get up to part where you choose your language, then i get a faint picture of a woman, and then nothing, help please?"
,XxLanexX,2010-12-20T01:08Z,Everytime I try to load a ROM on the DeSmuME it freezes. What's wrong?!
,Gamer0256,2011-01-10T21:39Z,"I am playing the games with the emulator, but for some reason I get way too slow fps. It's not my new 9000kr computer thats for sure, so now I got no idea why I the emulator runs so damn slow, any suggestion how I can fix it?"
,w7xpoke,2011-01-22T20:40Z,it's ok but not good
,dublea2,2011-01-26T17:53Z,"Works with Acekard 2i w/ no problem (though I might wait for the US release instead of a tranlation.)

@Gamer0256:
WTF is a 9000kr??  What OS are you using?  Most of the time if an emulator is laggy it IS the user's machine or conflicting software such as antivirus software.

@KNP1995:
It's a security built into the rom to prevent people from using flashcards.  The Acekard 2i's have a bypass for that security.  You might need to get a new one.

,lachy128,2011-01-28T06:14Z,first time using how do i make it go faster

,Heromist,2011-01-29T22:43Z,"Yeah ive been having issues with my damn DS emulator, any one got any ideas?"
,hugorochahgp,2011-02-06T21:29Z,"Works great, thanks!"
,R3ch,2011-02-10T17:28Z,"hello, if you want a room that works on No$gba and it is almost 80% translated to english and no freezing and crashing then i can upload it for you ... 
i have black and white (i only know that black works)
so if you want me to upload those rooms and the emulator comment here :D 
sorry my bad english... "
,Gashimahiron,2011-02-13T17:45Z,"WHAT THE F***?

a guy who calls himself one of the developers of the translation without ANY proof of it says it's impossible for an version 6 to exist, since the latest is 3 and the upcoming is 4, the other guy insists a 6 exists and another guy come out of the nowhere and say there is a Fuc***g version 7?
(SOME of) you guys suck!

i somehow believe the guy who says that about version 3 only(Chase-san), because i personally never found or ever heard from a version past version 4 from pokemon black and white...

,Chris446,2011-02-16T06:05Z,How do i get this to work? i pull up the emu and then what do i do?
,marxm,2011-02-16T09:46Z,So little of this is translated.  Still a good upload and works beautifully on Desmume with a little tweaking.  Just wait for an American release...
,atmosphere184,2011-02-16T20:41Z,works and so fast download! thanks!
