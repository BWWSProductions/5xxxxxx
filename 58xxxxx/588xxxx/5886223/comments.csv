In a career that has spanned more than 30 years, Elvis Costello has distinguished himself as one of pop musicâ€™s most prolific and versatile musicians. His latest work, National Ransom, produced by T Bone Burnett, features all members of The Imposters and The Sugarcanes performing a wide variety of new combos with guests Vince Gill, Marc Ribot, Buddy Miller and Leon Russell.

The record is led off by the loud electric guitar of Marc Ribot in the left channel and the lap-steel of Jerry Douglas in the right channel. Steve Nieve enters on the Vox Continental organ, while the rhythm section consists of Dennis Crouch on double bass and Pete Thomas on drums. National Ransom (Hear Music/Concord Music Group) is the name of the album and also a rock and roll song, ""For the bankrupt times, whenever they may be,"" as Costello recently described it.

National Ransom, recorded in a total of eleven days at Sound Emporium, Nashville and Village Recorders, Los Angeles was produced by T Bone Burnett and engineered and mixed by Michael Piersante at Electromagetic, Los Angeles."
