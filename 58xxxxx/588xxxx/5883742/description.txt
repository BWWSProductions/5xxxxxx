PLOT

As the world succumbs to a zombie apocalypse,

Cole a hardened mercenary, is chasing the one

person who can provide a cure. Not only to the

plague but to Cole's own incumbent destiny.

DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND is a cutting edge British

horror film that features zombies portrayed by

free runners for a terrifyingly authentic

representation of the undead.
