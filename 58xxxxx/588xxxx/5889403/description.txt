Richmond Fontaine, from Portland, Oregon, has gone into the studio and re-recorded favorites from the first two records plus a few previously unreleased songs. There are 17 songs in total. Included is a tribute song to one of RF's favorite bands, Dead Moon, and a cover of Husker Du's "Pink turns to Blue". The CD is called "Obliteration By Time (New Recordings of Old Favorites)" Think it's a great way to check out RF's old records. The record was recorded at Blue Room Studios with Mike Coykendall at the helm.
