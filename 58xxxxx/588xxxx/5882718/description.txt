Casting Crowns - Lifesong Live [2005]


CCM group Casting Crowns had a major hit in August of 2005 with their second album, 
the complex and rocking LIFESONG.They went on to win a Grammy Award, and to embark 
on a gigantic U.S. tour that brought their music and ministry to almost a half million 
concert-goers. LIFESONG LIVE captures the band's show, which in its fiery intensity and 
emotional exuberance recalls U2 at their fines
