,TheChosen1_,2010-10-23T23:57Z,"Thx for the upload.

I want to ask all of u about watching .mkv movies in notebook.When I watch a .mkv 
in my notebook , it seems like a divx or slightly better than it.I know the LCD panel 
of it isnt HD but I just wonder that does it really make a huge difference watching it in 
a 42"" or 46"" LCD or LED TV ?

Thx for ur answers guys.And thx for the movie again. "
,goalskn,2010-10-27T03:29Z,"cool movie ... awesome quality, no problems with anything

,buschmanmax,2010-11-07T00:39Z,"wow stupid comments from stupid ppl... for those of you who cant tell a cpu from a dvd burner... the subs are NOT i repeat NOT hardcoded... watch on VLC. go to open file, and direct it to open the movie... then after u click open and the video is running u go to the VIDEO tab.... then move down to subtitles.... and disable... now if u still cant figure it out this is what u need to do... turn off pc. unplug the tower, grab some gasoline or any other flammable liquid. douse the tower with it, grab a match and light it. after the fire goes out stomp on the box, then collect the pieces and put them in a garbage bag, and toss the whole lot into the dumpster because u have place anywhere near anything technological... any questions? ;) and to the uploader ty for this man nice job A\V 10 M\8.5 good kiddie flick.
