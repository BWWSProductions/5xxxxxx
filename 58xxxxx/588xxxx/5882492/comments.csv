No, I cannot, I'm sorry. Last week, when transition was announced, nobody asked for continuation of 272p. 

Now - regarding lack of support from people who needed 272p (not giving me ""umbrella""  as protection from insults and other shit thrown at me 'cause 272p for a year and half) - I bet that few would mis it, but choose to stay mute.
So far, only Sons of Anarchy have ""dual-version"" status."
