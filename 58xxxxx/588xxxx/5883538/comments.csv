,NRK9999,2011-10-29T08:14Z,"Hi Dude....Let me start by saying that your torrents are awesome....could you please upload Psych Seasons 1-6 in mkv format,small size??
Thanks a lot!"
,00Ace,2011-10-30T00:24Z,"Nice. But just some advice. you could go down to 300, or even 250Kbps and this would still be watchable. I've been testing on my own, and have been converting my avi video files down to Mkv. If I had a faster computer I'd convert to WebM. But I don't have an i3, i5, or i7. Just a semi decent Sony 1.6Ghz dual core. But I do see that you used  450Kbps, very nice. but you could go smaller than that, and it will still be decent quality. I've been using 250Kbps, but that's just me. If I were you, I'd go down to 300Kbps. Thanx for the download, I think I really like Supernatural, and have come here because you have used Mkv format, which by the next year, or year or so, everyone should start using the new Video Container Mkv with the Codec H.264. Better yet, Mkv with VP8 Codec, or the ULTIMATE WebM with VP8 Codec, INSANE Quality, and INSANE file Size. TINY.

Thanx for the upload."
,Zenden2RS,2012-01-02T10:40Z,"Will season 6 be uploaded any time soon? Season finished as of May 20 2011, season 7 still ongoing."
,waleedz00,2012-01-05T21:16Z,"good job uploading these seasons , continue through season until after season 7 please."
,DNGRUS559,2012-01-10T21:29Z,"I am working on Sons Of Anarchy, and I'm getting Season 7 of Supernatural as each episode comes available to me, (usually day or two after aired on tv), but in case my method differs from you, could you email me and let me know how you go about the conversion to mkv? Would greatly help me out. I'm starting to think .mkv is greatly superior to other formats in regards to quality/size comparison. Shoot me an email whenever you have a chance friend. I'm seeding all Supernatural releases you have currently.

Email: michael_norte559@yahoo.com

Thanks."

Honestly, some of these comments..."
,dolphane,2012-06-03T17:08Z,"@Hystrionics

...right?! lmao music or pics (small files) i get (kinda), or when an uploader actually lists that they take requests, but whole season requests?
