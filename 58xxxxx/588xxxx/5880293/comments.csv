you can use the controller if u want its just a lot harder to play well to most people it is"

You sure can Smart-Ass, but why don't you use the real guitar they ship and stop being so cynical."
,michigandaddy,2010-11-13T03:18Z,"PLEASE HELP,,,,,,,,,,I understand how to download and burn with imgburn but only when i find a torrent with 3 or 4 files and one of them has a .iso extension.  HOW DO YOU BURN WHEN SO MANY OF THESE HAVE OVER 70 FILES AND NONE OF THE FILES ARE .iso?  Any direction would be appreciated.  Thanks"

damn how did you get a shipped guitar with a download?"
,maxtoon,2011-03-06T04:30Z,"@michigandaddy

if you don't know what a .rar file is, you should not be downloading torrents."
