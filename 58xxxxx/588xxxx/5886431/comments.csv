,madtown4,2010-10-14T17:18Z,hi 2040 . just wondering if your going to do a toy story 3 bluray? hope everything is well for you . take care my friend. 
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-14T18:15Z,"Hi my friend, 3. has been encoded two hours ago and now is in uploading on server. It's 480p in 400 MB. 720p is in encoding right now, and if turn as good, would be uploaded early tomorrow.
So, 480p in 29 minutes. 720p (700MB) tomorrow."
,i_am_sid,2010-10-14T18:59Z,"@twentyforty
Can you upload this movie
Snow Falling on Cedars (1999)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120834/
Please make it 400MB atleast or above.And resolution; its upto you. 
Thanks"
,i_am_sid,2010-10-14T19:11Z,"@twentyforty
And one more request.
Please re-upload the movie 'Fragiles' with greater file size(above 400 mb). 130 mb is too small. Really wanna watch it. 
Please."
,bender1110,2010-10-14T19:40Z,I had requested bullitt 1968 / junebug 2005 / and hoosiers 1986 if you have the time/slots - thanks :)
,bender1110,2010-10-14T19:45Z,"I had written it in this torrent before you re-upped it and the comments were deleted. 

I dont mind the size although imo anything over 500mb should be 720p otherwise you can just get any of the other rips around.
The bitrate has been creeping up? most movies before were 300-400mb, now most are 400mb"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-14T19:50Z,"Fragile was done in that size because I like that format. And many other people ask me to rip more movies in extremely small sizes. It suits people on slow connections and I am here 'cause of them.
Fragile is available everywhere in 700 MB, it looks as what do you asking for.

Regarding your request, answer is positive from my side, but movie is 2h10 long and therefore cannot be anything else than 320p or 352p.  Size is roughly determined by that . approx, 400 MB. Highest format for movies released on DVD only is - 480p."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-14T19:59Z,"@bender1110: Yes. And - no. Movies in different formats cannot be of same size. Movie of 1h24 is smaller than 1h54 one in same frame format.
By one quarter.
That type of discussion always leads to one thing: written and spoken rubbish - in all shapes and colors.
So - you CAN go someplace else, right?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-14T20:02Z,"@i_am_sid: My answer starting with word ""Fragile"" was to you."

The Arrival 480p in 499 MB.

I hate when people speak from their asses.
Unless one thinks that 720x400 Toy Story 3 in 400 MB is - big."
,bender1110,2010-10-15T01:47Z,sorry - just thought it was a premature observation from the list above
,i_am_sid,2010-10-15T04:21Z,"@twentyforty
Hey buddy, i wasnt asking for 700 mb rip. I mean 400 mb or b\w 400-500 mb. And resolution from 272p to 480p; its up to you. You know better than me, whats good.
Thanks u very much for accepting my request. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-15T08:48Z,"@bender1110: Some of these encodings are couple of moths old. It is selection - before all get deleted forever.
Also, that Avatar is best print available.
All these are excellent rips - better than anything else similar in size.

Quality IS my concern. Small size is beneficiary but not blindly forced."
,t.trikiti,2010-10-22T10:52Z,come on! seeeed!!!
