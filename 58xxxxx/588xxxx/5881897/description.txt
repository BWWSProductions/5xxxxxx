 Supreme Pianos contains 3 grand pianos: Blue Water Piano, Red Wings
 Piano and Mini Piano. It uses physical modeling technology designed to
 achieve the same reality level as sampling while keeping the CPU usage
 low. In order to do this, Supreme Pianos uses a series of technologies
 that Sound Magic describes as "groundbreaking", including Harmony
 Rendering Engine and Multi-Dimension Vector Synthesis.

 The basic idea of Supreme Pianos comes from 3D graphic rendering. It
 uses Physical modeling to shape the sound's "skeleton" of the piano,
 and then maps a series of harmony components on to the skeleton to
 achieve an authentic sound.

 Supreme Pianos does not rely on sampling, has a small memory footprint
 and low CPU usage making it ideal for live performances. Even on a
 Pentium III 533MHz system, it could work great while running under
 heavy duty. And on today's quad core system, Supreme Pianos could
 maintain CPU usage unnoticeable, according to Sound Magic.

 Features:
 + 256 stages / 40Hz Harmony Rendering Engine adds reality to the sound
   of physical modeling piano.
 + Multi-Dimension Vector Synthesis technology reveals the power of
   Sound Magic's "next generation" Physical Modeling technology that is
   20X faster than traditional physical modeling algorithm.
 + Proprietary Real Dynamic Response System accurately represents real
   grand piano's non-linear dynamic response.
 + Full repedalling feature accurately recreates the behavior between
   pedal up and pedal down.
 + Proprietary 264-strings Sympathetic Resonance System reproduces
   comprehensive Sympathetic Resonances of a true Grand Piano.
 + Optimal Coding for multi-core CPU leads to extreme low CPU usage and
   RAM usage. The CPU usage even lower than a sample player.
 + Optimised for most MIDI keyboards.
 + Small Size, Total 335MB for 3 Pianos.
 + Full MIDI learn and automation.
