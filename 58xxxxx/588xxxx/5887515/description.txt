"Basic Rocket Science"

Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) decides that Greendale 
Community College must have its own flight 
simulator and cannot be bested by the 
competition, "City College," which is 
planning its own flight simulator. He enlists 
the study group to clean and refurbish the 
Greendale Community College simulator. As 
Jeff (Joel McHale), Pierce (Chevy Chase), 
Britta (Gillian Jacobs), Annie (Alison Brie), 
Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) and Troy 
(Donald Glover) wash the tattered simulator 
down, they end up accidentally launching it -
sending everyone on an unexpected journey 
into "outer space." Abed (Danny Pudi) is left 
behind to try and navigate a safe "return" 
for everyone.

Enjoy :)
