Except that itâ€™s a really shitty game, Bad lip-sync (the witch-character was laughing with her mouth shut) and when you open a door that need a key, the door stays wide open the rest of the game, the village gate for example â€“ it looks like they locked the door just too keep you inside, like youâ€™re the only one without a key, and thatâ€™s just stupid. You can even steel other peoples stuff, and they donâ€™t even care.  Itâ€™s a lot of irritating and unlogical errors in the game and Iâ€™m not amused!"

C:\Program Files (x86)\JoWooD Entertainment AG\ArcaniA - Gothic 4\Data\configuration

Edit the ProcessManager.xml file

Find  thread-pool-bit=""2"" and change it to thread-pool-bit=""1""

I believe it disables the 2 core of the CPU and stops the stuttering. But the draw back is maybe 30% decrease in frame rate. But it's much more playable then with the stuttering. 

I think the issue is with 2 core code which is causing the stuttering. 

guroof3d not yet..I'm downloading the DEMO and I'll apply ProcessManager.xml from the DEMO  to see what happens."

Also every instance of memory-synchronized=""false"" I changed to =""true"".

Then before the game starts in taskmanager (ctrl+alt+del) I check that the 'Set Affinity...' has both CPU 0 and CPU 1 have a check next to them and I raise the 'Set Priority' to 'High' for Arcania.exe.

I also shutdown every background running application including explorer.exe.

The game went from unplayable to not even a stutter or slow down with all graphics set to high and all eye-candy enabled.

Hope this will help somebody, really enjoying this game. Not really a gothic-type game (compared to the older ones, much easier) but as a whole it is fun to play.

check your graphics card manufacturers for the lastest drivers (they provide compatibility updates for games every so often and windows barely ever checks for updated drivers)

delete your installation
mount the iso file with virtual clone drive (or like program)
use autoplay to install and close autoplay during installation
explore the mounted iso
COPY the crack folder to a another place (ie desktop)
extract to the folder
highlight all files that were extracted and copy/paste to your installation folder (most commonly it would C:, Jowood entertainment, arcania gothic 4 or whatever.
Replace all files and merge all folders that it says to
run the application in administrator mode

Whats up with every new freaking game coming out so fucked, and then having the developers scramble to release a hotfix? Why cant they just release it when its 100% done and not buggy as hell."
,Lucky13s,2010-11-22T23:57Z,"To those having a crashing problem at the start.
It'll help if you list the details and find where its faulting, mine was faulting on a sound driver so I changed my format to 24bit 44100hz and it worked.
You can try that if you're also faulting on a sound-related issue.

For the choppyness, not a clue, I heard try setting your multicore to the exact number of cores your CPU has.

As for the game itself... I'm like 1 hour into the game and its really crappy compared to Gothic 1/2. Voice acting is HORRIBLE (as it was in Gothic 3), and theres no originality to the quests, they're just ""Go here, talk to this guy. That guy then gives you a quest to go there, kill that, come back""."

,Dk121,2010-12-01T08:40Z,"I am sorry to say it, but Arcania only dissapoints...I mean G1/G2 were really great, had an excelent storyline and the gameplay wasn't all about killing...and most of all(for example in G2) the games gave you that epic feeling that you are the chosen one, and no matter what you choose to be, in the end you will prevail...In Arcania the character is changed, the storyline barely links(the same problem as in G3, there was no real link between games) and, at least at the beggining, there is no actual goal or character (like Xardas) to introduce you into the world...It's mostly about you marrying a fucking ugly sheep and leaving the island...and blah blah blah...ending...hope I didn't upset you guys...:D....but this is my oppinion...;)"

I look forward to this game despite all the bad comments :D"

solution: Go to your avg or other virusscan. Go into the advanced options, identity protection(avg)  and make the iso(of gothic 4) an exception and click apply.
Normally i should install fine when you try again. "

At first the game worked completely fine and i managed to get off the first island and play for a while in the new area but then i had to format my hard-drive coz windows fucked up stuff.

Now i downloaded the game and had the freezing install bug but got through that, applied my old save and played for 10min just fine with 50+ fps. But then all of a sudden, game went to 10 fps and was freezing like shit.

I've tried the Patch.2.REPACK-RELOADED but didn't do anything.

It also can't be my computer because it ran well before formatting my computer and anyway, i have a i5 O.C. 4,2Ghz/GTX 570 O.C 930/4000 and 8Gb of RAM.

Just wondering that has anyone found out a fix yet? I did go through like 6 pages but didn't find any information that would help me."
,Pahvis,2011-10-20T02:25Z,"Ookay... Nevermind. I noticed that all my other games were having low fps too (even CS:S with 25fps).

Now, i got it fixed and my fps is back normal again in every game i have, but i can't really tell you how i did it for sure beacause there were two things i did:

1. I had been using the Nvidia beta 285.38-drivers. I uninstalled those and installed 	
280.26-version instead.

2. I lowered my GPU core clock a little; though maybe my video card was getting too low power while in stress."
