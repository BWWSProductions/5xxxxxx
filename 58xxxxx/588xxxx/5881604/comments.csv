,bgamtrak,2010-11-18T07:19Z,"Not HD quality, but still good.  Solid SD video.  A=9 V=7."
,srflojo,2010-12-06T20:33Z,"the show was never shot in HD.... even the Blueray of the Christmas special is not in HD,"
[T],theburningbush,2011-01-18T02:12Z,"Quality is acceptable for all except audio of season 2, which is about the most swirly, artifact-laden audio I've heard in any torrent anywhere, to the point where you miss some dialogue. "

,andrewtora,2011-05-15T12:08Z,"Yeah, thanks guys. 

I really like The Friends and Two and a half men. Now looking for something to replace them. But mostly all the new series such a crap.

Goodbye and good for me."
,dlectro,2011-05-24T08:15Z,"@srflojo you don't shoot in HD, you shoot on film, and then you digitize it to whatever resolution."
,coderX,2011-06-09T07:38Z,Love this show. It's like Seinfeld but with more over the top shenanigans. I'll comment back with A/V review. 
,meathane,2011-06-14T02:10Z,"""you shoot on film""

no you don't, what fucking year are you in?"
,nolanbernard,2011-07-11T09:29Z,"@meathane

They actually do shoot everything on film still to this day. The quality is incomparable to digital copies. Movie theaters still show movies off film. The highest quality IMAX films are, film. "

False...movies have not been shot on film in years. Yes, there are several 35MM projectors out there (my old theatre was an arthouse and only converted a few to Digital), but the vast majority of theatres are converting to almost all Digitals, as it reduces film conversion and shipping costs.

Our IMAX projector is Digital as well. 35MM Projectors and 75MM IMAX Projectors are a thing of the past now.."

A lot of brand new movies are primarily shot on film, usually with Panasonic cameras, although they might use a digital camera for a specific shot or scene.  If no one shot on film anymore then why would the best Film Production program in the entire southeast teach 95% film and 5% digital?  And why would a solid film directed by Sidney Lumet, a highly revered director, with an award-winning cast, be poorly received and even somewhat disregarded by critics and the public strictly because it was shot in digital?

@dlectro 
That film was called ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"", it was shot in digital HD, as mentioned above. "
,IcedCoffeeMate,2011-08-27T09:05Z,any good torrents for season 6 that aren't like 550MB/episode? 
,Osceana,2011-09-09T06:34Z,"@ MDJ.054:

Just wanted to add my 2 cents as well....uh, yeah, buddy, A LOT of films are still shot primarily on film. A good number are shot digital as well, but I wouldn't say it's a majority. What year are YOU living in that NOTHING is shot with physical film? I can name tons of films that have come out in the past 10 years that were shot on film with minimal/no digital filming."
,always42o,2011-09-15T06:01Z,@srflojo your an idioit...shit isnt shot in hd its converted...dumbass i have shit from the 80s in 1080..its what resolution it plays at ..has nothing to do with the camera..the only reason there is hd cameras is so they will render themselve in 720 and 1080 ..so go back to google or whatever you use
