,Arc101,2010-10-15T07:36Z,"Great Quality A/V Both a 9.5

Only watched around 5 minutes of it though because im not a late guy this week, busy week.

Will post M tomorrow, guessing a perfect 10/10 movie though! :D

Thanks!"

V - 7

It is watchable, but I would wait for a DVDRip."

it will be a long wait mate."
,sxp64,2010-10-15T22:02Z,"Audio is quite good, and it's actual stereo. I'd say:

A: 8

Video is clearly a screener with a stupid 'Property of x' overlay in the top end, and quality is decent, but very low resolution and bad color-source, I'd say:

V: 5

A+V sync is messed up. SAFCukO09 needs to still learn how to properly encode videos, but OK, let's give him a 5 for the effort."
