,loma123,2010-10-14T12:24Z,"thanks for the upload ....my 6pence.
had a look at files in nativePC dir . looks to me like *.arc did not extract correctly....i think ( used freearc but said files are corrupted.....) only way to know for sure is to match files located under \Lost Planet 2\nativePC\arcXmlTmpPC & Lost Planet 2\nativePC\arcLp2Xml with the skidrow release which is way to big for me to DL - these files all have the .ARC extension..
Unleashed fix this please ...."

,OneHitGamer,2010-11-16T18:21Z,"For those of you who cannot figure out how to create an offline profile:

Go to CREATE NEW PROFILE, on the USER AGREEMENT screen, DO NOT press NEXT. instead, scroll down to the bottom and in the LAST PARAGRAPH you will see a blue link label'd ""CREATE OFFLINE PROFILE. click that. done.

Now you have an offline profile and can save your game progress. this is why some of you cannot load your save, cuzz it didnt exist lol.
