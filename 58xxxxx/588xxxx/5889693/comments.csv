,tpbIB,2010-10-27T11:02Z,"I had the same problem juggermout. Windows explorer crashes when I open the folder, if I open it in divx player, winamp or windows media player classic they crash; windows media player opens it but just shows the first frame and won't play it. It played fine in Totem Movie Player 2.28.2 in Linux though. I'm not sure what the problem is."
,noparlpf,2010-11-26T22:20Z,Same problem; windows explorer and MPC both crash when I try to open the folder or a file.

,Roan393,2011-03-16T07:54Z,"What is wrong?! I tried to open this folder but every time I to it crashes, I've downloaded the CCCP and tried to open with media player classic, and every other media player on the net, and none of them will work!

Hell I even tried to convert the files using a video converter, and yes you guessed it, It didn't work.

Whats the go!?"
,daky988,2011-03-26T15:18Z,can anyone write link where I can find sub for ep 10.5 ova pls.. I tried google but couldnt find it anywhere.
,jelloskater,2011-04-01T11:20Z,"i have the same problem with windows explorer. the problem is BEFORE i open the videos. you can still play the videos if you dont browse the folder and instead just right click on the folder and click ""play all""(or whatever the button is for you). if anyone knows whats going on it would be helpful. and the folder will open fine with outside programs. such as adobe bridge."
,jelloskater,2011-04-01T11:50Z,ill keep trying. but for now the only solution i could find was deleting the extension name. so just delete the .mkv part and then you can open the folder and you can open the files with vlc like normal. not the solution i was looking so ill keep trying. and btw i have plenty of mkv files and they all work fine other than these. not sure why.
,pinoystyle711,2011-05-10T23:41Z,For those of you having problems with crashing...Download VLC Media Player...and all your problems will be solved.
,ode138,2011-05-17T15:13Z,"No crashing here, but video keeps stalling while the sound continues (MPC, haihaisoft and more). No missing codecs. Even in VLC, except when playing the files without any skipping ahead. They can only be played straight through or paused at the most. VLC, yet again, to the rescue."
,jeboisusa,2011-05-22T23:39Z,"This torrent works excellent and for those who have trouble with opening, use K-Lite Codec from 6.4.0 to above and play it in Media Classic Player. If you want to use japanese audio with english subs (which are included in the files) use mkvmerge GUI 4.7.0 program to make those default.

And also if anyone can help by posting a link to episode 10.5 OVA engilsh subtitles, if there are any on the internet."
,MagGray,2011-06-29T21:37Z,"This is ridiculously large for 13 episodes. Regardless of the upscaling and dual-audio.

I'm not questioning the credibility of the files because I haven't downloaded them, they're just way larger than I'd expect. "
,Thyrai,2011-07-08T05:16Z,Seed please
,spik330,2011-07-10T08:18Z,i have no subs at all
,R3dJ3di,2011-09-06T22:37Z,why cant i get sound?
,mbaim7,2011-09-07T05:36Z,"I had no problems playing this in VLC.  There is a problem with the audio though, its a few moments behind the video which is very annoying.  I'm checking out:

Elfen Lied (complete 13 episodes)
[Anime-MX] Elfen Lied DVD-Rip Complete

I'll let you know which one is best"
,Meoang,2011-09-14T05:50Z,"When I tried to open the first episode in Gom player, which has worked with mkv files numerous times in the past, windows explorer crashed and each time it came back up, it crashed again.  This is happening over and over now even when I restart my computer, and I'm going to have to go through the trouble of fixing it.

If you don't want to deal with all this trouble, use a different torrent."
,Meoang,2011-09-14T06:59Z,"OKAY, if any of you end up with the problem I described in my last post, where your windows explorer crashes over and over, what yhttp://mintywhite.com/windows-7/7maintenance/delete-file-command-prompt/ou need to do is delete the file with the command prompt.

,Idakus,2011-09-29T09:17Z,"@mbaim7, When you use VLC if you go under tools you can adjust the sound track under track synchronization"
,aienment,2011-10-12T20:27Z,I have checked it out in VLC. There is nothing wrong with it. Its perfectly fine. 
,DuhNigguhFrumMarsh,2011-12-11T15:44Z,"Bloody shit, huh?"
