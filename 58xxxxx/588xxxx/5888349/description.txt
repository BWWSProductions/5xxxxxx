Subtitle info:

The subtitles for this film are an extremeley edited version of a srt file that was downloaded fromThe original english subtitles were translated from portuguese using a google translation program and were pretty much an unintelligble mess. I cleaned up the gramatical errors and re-translated some phrases "english -> portuguese-> spanish -> english". Using that and a little common sense, I composed this new srt file, which I hope does not contain too many gross mistakes.

If anyone else wants to improve this version, please make a torrent of the new improved subtitles file without including the movie. That way only have upload 100KB instead of 1GB to get the improved version.
