    Tony Robinson, Mick Aston and Phil Harding follow digs     
    around the UK that uncover a vast array of archaeology    
    and provide fascinating insights into our Viking past.   
                                                              
    Three centuries of Viking occupation left an indelible     
    print on the British Isles. Their legacy has shaped the   
    Britain we live in today and the Vikings have had a      
    huge influence on our culture; from the way we live to    
    the words we use.                                          
                                                              
    The Vikings are notoriously known as fearsome,           
    axe-wielding warriors who relished their reputation as    
    bloodthirsty invaders, and the discovery of mutilated      
    skeletons in this Time Team Special does little to        
    alter this reputation. However, they were also           
    successful global traders, technological pioneers and     
    world-wide mariners.                                       
                                                              
    The Team report from excavations across the country,     
    from Orkney to the south coast, but it is in Hungate,     
    York that the biggest discoveries are made. This huge      
    dig uncovers the thousand-year-old Viking remains of      
    streets, houses and a trading centre.                    
                                                              
    Using all this research, Tony and the Team paint a new     
    and much more complex picture of these skillful and       
    enterprising people.
