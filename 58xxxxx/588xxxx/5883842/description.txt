Sale el Sol was recorded in the Bahamas, London, Barcelona, and the Dominican Republic. The title track, Sale el Sol was co-written with her friend and collaborator, Luis Fernando Ochoa. Shakira teamed up with El Cata, a famous Dominical reggaeton artist for the tracks Rabiosa and Loca con el Tigre , adding an urban edge (twist) to these up-tempo dance tracks. Gordita is a collaboration with RenÃ© PÃ©rez, frontman and contentious lyricist from Calle 13. They performed the song together at Rock in Rio in Madrid, and the Glastonbury Music Festival in June of 2010. Mariposa is a ballad which features legendary guitarist , Gustavo Cerati, as well as the renowned pianist Alejandro MenÃ©ndez. Gustavo Cerati also plays guitar on the song Tu Boca. Sale el Sol reminds fans of Shakira s talent for writing songs that leave a mark on their generation with her inspired lyrics and unforgettable style.
