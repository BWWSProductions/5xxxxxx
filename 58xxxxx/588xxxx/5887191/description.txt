Notes:
Commercials and Rain-delay Removed.  Game was postponed for an hour while in second quarter due to lightning.  The final play prior to the delay was a score - in the process of editing to the pre- and post-delay video the kickoff subsequent to the score was inadvertently edited out.  The file labeled "2ndHalf" picks up from where the teams resumed play (2nd quarter) and contains the remainder of the game.
