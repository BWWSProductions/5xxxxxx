Mp4 version of an earlier upload. A quote from this great classic, "Who knows, maybe there are even stranger creatures underground?", too bad they did not make a sequel, I will just have to be content watching the original over and over, ever waiting for "Return of the Slime people", or something even stranger (sigh).
