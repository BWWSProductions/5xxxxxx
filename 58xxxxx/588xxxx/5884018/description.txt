Cern has scheduled a possable extinction level event on 11/9/10?

1st extinction level event: Leaked CERN documents state LHC has 70% chances to produce â€˜ice-9\' strangelets on 11/9
We have received and will show in this article astonishing documents leaked out of CERN internal servers, about the CASTOR  project, a Centauro and STrangelet Object Research to hunt for strangelets â€˜likelyâ€˜ to be produced at the LHC.

According to those internal documents CERN has been lying for years to the press and in the suits, since it always affirmed that it wonâ€™t produce the ultra-dangerous, ultradense â€˜strangeletsâ€™, the liquid explosive made of up, down and strange quarks, responsible of the ice-9 reactions that cause supernovas (belowâ€™s graph).

In those documents CERN affirms there is a 65-70% of chances of producing negative strangelets, which according to standard science on strangelets today, will provoke the ice-9 reaction (name taken from Cat and Cradleâ€™s book in which a physicist destroys the world throwing a new type of water that freezes the planet, since an ice-9 reaction will condensate the planet in a 15 kilometers ultra-dense strange star).

Thus CERN has been lying and it is playing with all mankind a Quantum Russian Roulette game with 4 shots out of 6, 66% chances of extinction. This will be even if we survive the biggest genocide of history, calculated multiplying probability and victims: 66% x 6.6 billions=4.4 billions, 1000 times the Holocaust. The experiment will start in 45 days now. We might be living the last month of our existence as individuals and as a species. This Fall can be indeed the Fall of Man. And yet, the experiment is not stopped. This machine is too big to fail. Ave Caesar Hauer, morituri te salutantâ€¦

(Keep reading for a full disclosure of those documents or if you prefer a visual description of this event, click on the 10 min. films â€™11/9\' on your right. â€˜Informative filmâ€™ is an illustrated interview in â€˜coast to coastâ€™ Radio to Walter Wagner, my co-plaintiff on the Federal Suit against CERN; â€˜surrealist filmâ€™ is a documentary a la â€˜Dr. Strangeloveâ€™ on the events that will take place the 11/9, shot at CERN, with historic material and strangelet physics explained by Dr. Wilczek, the Nobel Prize who discovered and named the ice-9 reaction. I hold copyrights and permissions on those images, given to me by CERNâ€™s press office before suing them; yet the film is censored in several countries of Europe, notably Germany, the main contributor of this machine, so you might not be able to see it. Both Wagner and Wilczek were the first scientists to warn about the future dangers of Super-colliders in their landmark letters to Scientific American in 1999).





How it Will Happen: Earthquakes, Strangelets and Black Holes.






In the graph, for the first time in History mankind has built a machine-weapon, able to destroy this planet. The LHC is an accelerator, a type of machine evolved during the cold war to rehearse small nuclear explosions, which could be used by the military as a sample of future Nuclear Bombs, and by researchers to explore the simplest forms of energy and particles that compose the Universe. After the cold war ended, Russia and America put an end to the astronomical costs of those machine-weapons, but Europe, with the new â€˜marketingâ€™ of â€˜peaceful useâ€™ (similar to our â€˜peace forcesâ€™ in â€˜humanitarian missionsâ€™ in Afghanistan) took the industry of accelerators a step further. The result is the Large Hadron Collider, a 7 teravolt, superconductive, superfluid â€˜quark cannonâ€™. which will mass together the densest, most attractive substance of the Universe, quarks, to explore the formation of quark-gluon liquids, the explosives, responsible of cosmic annihilations, such as Novas, Super-novas and perhaps the hypothetical big-bang of the Universe.

The irresponsibility of CERNâ€™s physicists who plan to do those experiments with quark liquid explosives here on Earth, without even the slightest military or political supervision, has been denounced in Courts and Internet blogs, to not avail, since the LHC is a machine â€˜too big to failâ€™, defended by technocrats, nuclear industries/ physicists and the corporate press, with the same zeal they defended nuclear weapons during the cold war, when that name was still â€˜politically correctâ€™.  Now we have proofs that the European Company of Nuclear Research has been lying to the public about the probabilities of those catastrophic scenarios. In those internal documents CERN affirms that the LHC has enough potency to create strangelets, a strange liquid explosive that is responsible of the ice-9 reaction that converts stars into Super-novas. The Company has even a machine, CASTOR, for Centauro and STrangelet detecTOR, built to study them. Since the â€˜Castor Teamâ€™ affirms the LHC will â€˜likelyâ€™ create stable strangelets this 11/9. In the graph, we observe the entire range of LHCâ€™s potency and the type of quark explosives this â€˜quark cannonâ€™, the layman name this machine should have, will produce. Strangelets are made of usd quarks, deconfined in lead to lead collisions starting 11/9/2010â€¦

CERN LHC Black Holes and Strangelets - May Appear Years Later and Destroy World
Dr. Walter L. Wagner discusses the potential destruction of our planet earth by creating micro black holes and strangelets with the LHC. He indicates the current CERN safety reports are seriously flawed and contain unacceptable risks.

For example, if micro black holes are created, which CERN estimates about 1 micro black hole every second, the effects of this experiment may be months to years after the first LHC collisions.

These people in charge of the LHC lack self-preservation instincts in similar way, like many sectarians. No evidence or theory would convince them about LHC disaster, until it really happens...







Quantum Roulette : Feature 84 mins

The Nuclear Industry evolves the final weapon, a quark canon that will produce mass-bombs and could cause the big bang of Earth into a nova (pulsar or black hole). But physicists are in denial, protecting a 13 billion $ machine & scholar ambitions. They lied to a naive press, saying quarks are harmless, cosmic rays, and the canon will find the origin of the Universe. And now are ready to play a game of Russian Roulette with Earth.
