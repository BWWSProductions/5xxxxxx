Heartland S04E03: Road Curves

Chase Powers returns to complicate Amy's life. Ty is concerned about that and has worries of his own too. Lou's arc about Peter, Dubai and Heartland/the dude ranch continues. Ashley wants her and Caleb to get along with her mother Val. And Mrs. Bell and Sugarfoot are a big part of this episode.

The resolution is 624x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Oct 10, 2010.
