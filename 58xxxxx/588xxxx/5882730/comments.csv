,AddyTzu,2010-10-14T11:31Z,thanks
,S3nd41,2010-10-15T01:22Z,The quality of the screenshots is pure crap. I hope that's due to the image compression and that the actual movie quality is much better. Also how come there are already dvd and br rips of Machete around? It's not even in the movies yet ffs.
,Jack_Raiden,2010-10-15T04:45Z,S3nd41: Upscaled DVDSCR FTW!! Machete's been out since early September in many countries.
,MasakiLHW,2010-10-16T00:59Z,"Besides the poor video quality, didn't work on my Popcorn Hour or my TV with h264 support."
,johne86,2010-10-16T03:03Z,"I'm with everyone else the video quality is poor, don't get me wrong it's still much better than the xvid r5's out there. Still the source of this is an R5 Blu-Ray. And If the expandables and many other R5 Blu-Ray rips have shown us anything, it's that the video quality can be excellent. But this is just terrible it looks grainy and you get those spots you would get when your watching a film in the cinema.

6/10 overall my suggestion download this one:

Machete 2010 Bluray 720p DTS x264 CHD

or this one:

Machete 2010 R5 720p BluRay x264 READ NFO-WPi"
,oni4ever,2010-10-17T01:29Z,thanks for uploading (& nice seeding as well)....not a bad print for new movie 
,TheChosen1_,2010-10-17T13:23Z,"Hi guys.

I want to ask all of u about watching .mkv movies in notebook.When I watch a .mkv 
in my notebook , it seems like a divx or slightly better than it.I know the LCD panel 
of it isnt HD but I just wonder that does it really make a huge difference watching it in 
a 42"" or 46"" LCD or LED TV ?

Thx for ur answers guys.And thx for the movie again."
,fishybirdy,2010-10-17T17:24Z,"@TheChosen1_

MKV files are containers, usually for hd films.
If you watch it on a little laptop you wont notice that its HD as your laptop will only display at whatever the maximum res for that laptop is.
When you output to an HD tv or monitor that has a hd screen, you will see a big difference.
If you're only going to watch movies on a little laptop then ur better off downloading small 700mb files."
,LupinII2,2010-10-20T09:37Z,Its pretty funnny how nobody can seem to get the hint that the grainy quality of this film is intentional and not a problem with the upload. For followers of the work of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez this type of film making is no suprise. Try watching Grindhouse (the double feature film from which the fake Machete trailer first originated) and then maybe you'll understand whats going on here.
[V],neon,2010-10-21T15:17Z,well said LupinII2...thanks :)
,AMoveFan,2010-10-22T01:43Z,they're called Matroska videos dumbass.
,AMoveFan,2010-10-22T01:46Z,"and you impatiend freeloaders good things come to those who wait, wait until better rips of this blue ray comes out and besides this is a poor b action movie anyway."
[V],big_dad_e,2010-10-25T06:58Z,"Noob leechers always have something negative to say but nothing to contribute.  Thanks neonrainbow.  BTW, Grindhouse got the same criticism, probably from the same lamez."
