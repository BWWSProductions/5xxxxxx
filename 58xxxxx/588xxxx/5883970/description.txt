Synopsis:
Kaish Amari comes from a wealthy Islamic family. At the tender age of six he is sent to school and gets friendly with a young girl named Laila. Both of them become close friends, so much so that Kaish gets himself punished and beaten for her. They mature in age so does their love much to the chagrin of Laila's dad, who wants her to marry a wealthy Arabian, Bahksh, a noble Prince. Now the region is aflame with their love story, Kaish, who is now known as Majnu, cannot get Laila out of his mind and roams around the desert semi-senile, without food or drink, while Laila is getting wed to the man of her father's choice. The question remains will love triumph in the end or is this young couple fated to be separated for the rest of their lives.
