You are right, you did include the imdb, and yes some people are blind, but you seem a little hateful toward them. That's all"
,jcord9194,2010-10-16T18:28Z,"In the movie Rust, Corbin Bernsen stars as James Moore, a pastor who has lost his faith and is in a midlife crisis when he goes back to his hometown. There he learns that a new family in the area died in a mysterious fire and that his old childhood friend stands accused of the murder. As Bernsenâs character Moore sets out to uncover the truth and unravel the mysterious tragedy and wrongful accusations, he discovers important lessons about faith, family, loyalty, the past and the ties that bind a community together. Through the process, he rediscovers his own ties to God. I figured a synopsis would be nice."
