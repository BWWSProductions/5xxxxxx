This torrent is a combination of http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5230765 and my own creation of the 7 beta firefox adapter. Up until now there was no crack for roboform that included the adapter that worked in the new firefox 3.6.1

Download and follow the instructions in the text file.

Again, I did not create the roboform.dll crack, just the custom xpi file for firefox.


Basically you need to install roboform, crack it, and then run firefox and install the add-on I've supplied.

Enjoy!
