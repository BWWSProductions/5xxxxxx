 How did you get past the 1st battle without it crashing. Finally won the fort battle but it crashed after 1st dialogue box. This is Necore's prob and what I've read so far they don't seem to want to address this issue. Installed and reinstalled as Admin."
,jmandryk,2010-10-16T18:42Z,"crash's at load screen. Win 7, 32bit. all driver's etc checked and new. game installer also will not install the directx, c++  optional installs either"
,jmandryk,2010-10-16T18:58Z,nm.. my bad. install as administrator and it works fine.. must have been half asleep this morning
,dragonzer0,2010-10-17T22:53Z,"Thiss game has problems for a lot of players. The Paradox forum has stated that those that have registered thier game can then get support. Wrong!!! Support is locked. So even Neocore doesn't want to hear about thier problems. For those of you that got this game to work, great. For those of us that can't will just have to wait to see if a patch comes forward from Neocore. If you go to Paradox forum you can find a new Launcher that has worked for some to at least get through the 1st battle. Good luck."

,boneyboy0,2011-02-19T20:01Z,yup...  instaling as admin worked fine
,koopatroopa_15,2011-03-04T20:04Z,"Game installed perfectly for me. Previous poster is correct though that the installer will error if you try and install DirectX or C++ Redistributable via the setup.exe after the initial game installation finishes.

I have only played through the tutorial so far but I encountered no crashes.

Plays *very* similar to Medieval: Total War. Total War junkies should get their fix with this until Shogun 2 comes out (^_^)"
