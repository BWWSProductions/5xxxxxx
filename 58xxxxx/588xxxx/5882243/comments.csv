,tensigh,2010-10-13T14:31Z,Thanks for uploading this. TenYardTorrents sucks ass. I think they're actually pirates because you have to pay them after you've downloaded a number of files.

Is it my RAM because my RAM is 6gb and the file is 6.41gb. Although I think that shouldn't effect it.

I don't know, but when it does play smooth for like 2 seconds at a time it looks great, so if you never had problems with these files, great download."
