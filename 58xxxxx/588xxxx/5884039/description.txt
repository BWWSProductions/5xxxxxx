IMAGiNE NOTES:

Right where to begin... well firstly unsure if the source is a R5 as disney don't do R5's but have tagged it like everyone else so... Secondly by now most of you would have found out the dvd9 was fook at 56.28 there is a glitch so when ripping it messed everything up... and also there was no subs for the spanish part only an option to how english subs throughout. Well what we did was ripped the dvd9 video only and once it was done we cut the part that was glitched and added the missing 1min 39 secs off the russian xvid and then appended the end of our encoded video to make it complete which a glitch :P Filtering side of things we just done a few tweaks here and there... bit more chroma and a bit more brighter, increased the sharpness etc... and also hardcoded some subs we found on a site, but unsure who made them and if there 100% correct... but thanks :) The audio we just demuxed and then needed to resync it to our encode.
