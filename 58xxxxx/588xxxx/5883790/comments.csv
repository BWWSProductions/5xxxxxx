,Nickeli,2010-11-07T16:21Z,"There IS english audio, there is total 3 audio tracks as you can see in the info box, you can choose between them.

Quality is perfect."
,55trucker,2010-12-28T06:02Z,Has anyone else found a problem with the English audio track? Movie video has an occasional glitch when the English track is played that does not occur when the Russian track is used. The only way I could get rid of it was to remux the entire movie by re-encoding the English DTS to AC3.
