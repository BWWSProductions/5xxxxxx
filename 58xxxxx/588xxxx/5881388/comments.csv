,cheborneck,2011-04-10T02:56Z,where's disk 3?
,sonictrey,2011-06-18T18:57Z,"@cheborneck There is no disk 3, I have a physical copy, and there is only the 2 disks. Anyway, great torrent, I'm just too lazy to burn it to my computer :P"
,navpers_05,2011-10-14T08:35Z,"@RAMBAM1776: what are you a fan of? lossy musik? Dont tell me that apple lossless or WMA lossless are superior. FLAC files are not copyright protected, winning!"
