"Chuck Versus The Coup D' Etat" 

Chuck (Zachary Levi) and Sarah (Yvonne 
Strahovski) work on becoming better 
communicators as they join Awesome 
(Ryan McPartlin) and Ellie (Sarah 
Lancaster) for a getaway to Costa 
Gravas. There, the gang is reunited 
with Generalissimo Goya (guest star 
Armand Assante) who finds himself in a 
dangerous situation once again. Back 
at home, Morgan (Joshua Gomez) embarks 
on a forbidden romance that may put 
him at odds with Colonel John Casey.

Enjoy :)
