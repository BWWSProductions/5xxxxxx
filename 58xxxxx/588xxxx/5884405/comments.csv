,Cargo_hold,2011-06-04T14:26Z,"Nice upload- but could I please get some help as to how to mounting the CD? The only program I could find that mounts ZIP files was Pismo, but it wouldn't mount this one because the .rar file 'wasn't a supported file format'.
What mounting program should I use? (And how?)"
,Cargo_hold,2011-06-04T14:29Z,"*as to how to mount, sorry."
,anichu,2011-11-13T12:26Z,Good upload thanks :)
,anichu,2011-11-13T12:28Z,"@Cargo_hold: try ""daemon tools"" (the free version) to mount the iso files, most people i know use it..."
,remdog666,2011-12-20T01:21Z,Game crashes as soon as the first cutscene ends. Anyone know how to fix this/having the same problem? 
,dewsaqed,2011-12-20T02:49Z,Freezes for me too when I try to read the letter after the first cutscene. Window-ed mode helped a little but I was only able to make it down the hall. Win7/64.
,francis2k2,2012-01-13T02:42Z,cargo hold deamons tools is a good program to mount images
,francis2k2,2012-01-13T05:03Z,"i did all u sayed,but dont worked with me
stay a aswer ""make sure the game is properlly instaled an the CD is in the drive"" HELP!
I want this game so bad"
,Sarcopterygii,2012-01-26T00:55Z,"francis2k2 :

to fix the problem you're having, be sure to adjust the windows compatibility to windows 98. You do this by finding the exe.file called ""GRIM"" , rightclic on it, and under the second tab ""compatibility"" select windows 98. I got the same error message as you at first, but this absolutely fixes it, and the game runs great!

Thanks for a great upload!"
,kyuu999,2012-02-08T21:51Z,"10/10 for this upload. The most popular Grim Fandango torrent was working with alot of bugs and problems But this one works perfectly on Win7, thanks alot Trinnit2."
,gitsune,2012-03-14T20:41Z,"Having problems with the link. Getting this error message:

403. Thatâs an error.

Your client does not have permission to get URL /p/grimfandangosetupandlauncher/ from this server. Thatâs all we know. 

Anyone know how to solve this?"
,shazzanova,2012-03-19T07:41Z,works really well from an iso i actually own the disk but it was very buggy and wouldnt run on window 7 i didnt even need the launcher i did nee cpu killer however thankyou  
,travioso86,2012-04-06T09:17Z,The game works but I can only get the sound to work (outside of cutscenes) in windowed mode. Anyone know why that might be?
,travioso86,2012-04-06T10:07Z,"Nvm, I think I figured it out. Was a little difficult figuring it out for Windows 7, but Sarcopterygii's basic idea was right. Had to find ""grim fandango launcher"" and clicked ""troubleshoot compatibility"" settings after right clicking to get it to windows 98. Seems to be working find now. "
,travioso86,2012-04-06T10:18Z,"Lawl, I just had to right click the shortcut and it was exactly as Sarcopterygii said...."
,ScunthorpeX,2012-04-06T17:44Z,"The most elegant & idiot-proof solution imho is to use Gownaar's installer/launcher:

The message for my self..."
,mnjauau,2012-05-14T13:41Z,"Ok, I do know how to install games, how to use daemon, etc, but I encountered ''newish'' problem here: mounting goes fine, installation starts and than everything crashes and iso unmounts itself from daemon (I can see cd mounted in daemon, but my computer doesn't). Tried making 1 iso file or at least copying extracted files or anything, but found out that DATA003.LAB from cd1 and VOX002.LAB from cd2 are ones I can't even copy. So, I can't do a thing... So sad :((( I downloaded this game some time ago, but couldn't play (didn't have those new solutions for newer OPs back than). Now I think I could play it, but can't get it installed. Frustrating!"
,mnjauau,2012-05-14T13:54Z,"This message appears right before everything goes wrong:
''C:/Program Files/Grim Fandango/DATA003.LAB

An error occurred while trying to copy a file:
The device is not ready.

Click Retry to try again, Ignore to skip this file (not recommended), or Abort to cancel installation.''

After this I can only go with Abort..."
,y0whatsup,2012-05-31T19:49Z,"Just for anyone having trouble mounting/installing, I had to do the following:
-Mount CD1 to any drive (I used drive E), but do not run it once mounted
-Run the setup instead that comes in this torrent
-The setup should prompt you to insert CD2 into a drive about halfway through installation
-So unmount CD1 from the drive and then mount CD2 to that same drive (it could not find CD2 if it was in a different drive from the once CD1 was in)
-Then you can successfully play the game"
,y0whatsup,2012-06-01T22:18Z,"Everything about the game works fine, except the menu and text. It's impossible to read and just looks like little marks in a line...I've tried running in compatibility mode but that doesn't fix the problem."
,johnsamy21,2012-06-02T07:57Z,working on win 7 .. thx for the great game i hope they make a film from this!
,y0whatsup,2012-06-11T20:46Z,"If anyone has Nvidia Optimus on their laptops and has trouble seeing the text in the game, go to the Nvidia Control Panel and change the preferred graphics card to the integrated one whenever you want to play this game and the game will run fine."
,Reno_T,2012-06-14T04:15Z,"For Win 7 64-bit users with freezing or crashing problems:

Go to the properties of the new launcher and put the compatibility mode to Window 95, that fixed everything for me, try it out."
,ChrisPringle,2012-06-21T17:17Z,Thx Scunthorpex!
