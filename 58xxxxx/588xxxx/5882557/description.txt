Xmanager Enterprise is an all-in-one solution that includes Xmanager 3D, Xshell, Xftp and Xlpd in a single package. 

Xmanager 3D lets you share 3D (OpenGL) X window applications, and Xshell enables you to manage remote Unix/Linux servers with a secure terminal. 

Xftp allows you to transfer files between systems easily and securely. 
In addition, Xlpd offers local printing for remote documents on other systems.

All programs included in this product share a common SSH (Secure Shell) security module and interoperate with one another. 

This provides customers with a great convenience and improved productivity that cannot be found on any other competing products. 

Since these various features are integrated into a single package, customers can expect easier purchase, installation and maintenance as well as reduced total cost of ownership.
