"Jolly Vindaloo Day"

Exploiting Todd's (Ben Rappaport) 
unfamiliarity with Indian holidays, Rajiv 
(Rizwan Manji) creates a fake holiday in 
order to get him out of the office. While 
Todd is gone, Rajiv receives a visit from 
his future father-in-law who he is trying 
to impress by pretending to be a manager. 
Meanwhile, the A-Team employees begin 
harassing Manmeet (Sacha Dhawan), Gupta 
(Parvesh Cheena) and Madhuri (Anisha 
Nagarajan), so they turn to the best 
source they know to plot their revenge.

Enjoy :)
