,sugardaddyLL,2010-10-14T00:38Z,"Help, I was HELP! I love Eastenders and was having no problem with getting your torrents about two weeks ago, then sudden last week or so when I tried to get the new Eastenders that you uploaded daily I cant? I have tried different bitorrent software and everything and still I get errors that the torrent is not in the pool or that I am getting a connection refusal? Also I am downloading other torrents off of TPB no problem, just something about these Eastenders? Any help would be great because I love the show and really want to be able to get these. Help..."
,bentemoe,2010-10-14T10:53Z,"I had to stop uploading for two weeks when I was in hospital, but when I got back home I continued to upload in exactly the same way as I did it before. Nothing changed. 

I create the torrent with uTorrent and upload it to Pirate Bay. I leave it to seed until the next day. By then there are plenty of others seeding.
Nobody else has posted with a problem.

Maybe someone else can help, or advise. I am no expert in this, I just do it parrot fashion.

Bente"
,sugardaddyLL,2010-10-14T11:12Z,Thank you. I was able to get the one right before this one. But this one is still being odd? Hope your feeling better! 
,bentemoe,2010-10-14T11:24Z,"Jorunn, you are the reason that I do this.
I still hope that one day I will collect my prize !!"
