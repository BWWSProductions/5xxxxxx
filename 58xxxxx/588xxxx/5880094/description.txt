Hunt.To.Kill.2010.BDRip.XviD-AVCDVD

 Steve Austin stars as U.S. Border Patrol agent Jim Rhodes, a tough divorcee mourning the loss of his murdered partner while struggling to raise his rebellious daughter in the mountains of Montana. But when a crew of trigger-happy fugitives takes Rhodes and the girl hostage, a rugged wilderness will explode in all-terrain vengeance. Is there any wounded animal more dangerous than a lawman left for dead? Gil Bellows (â€The Shawshank Redemptionâ€), Emilie Ullerup (â€Sanctuaryâ€), former kickboxing champion Gary Daniels (â€Tekkenâ€) and Academy Award(R) nominee Eric Roberts (â€The Dark Knightâ€) co-star this bone-snapping, bullet-blasting, ass-kicking action/thriller where the only rule of survival is â€œHunt To Killâ€.

When Jimâ€™s (STEVE AUSTIN) teenage daughter is kidnapped, heâ€™s forced to lead a band of ruthless killers into the wilderness to retrieve their share of a missing heist score. In order to rescue his daughter, Jim must use his unique brand of survival skills to outsmart the kidnappers before itâ€™s too late. HUNT TO KILL is an action packed adrenaline rush about a man operating on his most primal instincts to save the one thing heâ€™s willing to die for â€“ his daughter.
