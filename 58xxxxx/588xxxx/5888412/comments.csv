,Yorkfield,2011-01-07T23:03Z,"Yeah, I disconnected from the Internet and run the program. Selected activation from a different computer and put in some random details and saved a little text file on my harddrive.

Next window is saying:
6. Please copy the Authentication Code from the registration e-mail message we sent you and paste it into the space below to complete registration.

Seems like all I need is an authentication code.
