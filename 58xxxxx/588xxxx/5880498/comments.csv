,OneHitGamer,2010-11-16T18:23Z,"For those of you who cannot figure out how to create an offline profile:

Go to CREATE NEW PROFILE, on the USER AGREEMENT screen, DO NOT press NEXT. instead, scroll down to the bottom and in the LAST PARAGRAPH you will see a blue link label'd ""CREATE OFFLINE PROFILE. click that. done.

Now you have an offline profile and can save your game progress. this is why some of you cannot load your save, cuzz it didnt exist lol.
