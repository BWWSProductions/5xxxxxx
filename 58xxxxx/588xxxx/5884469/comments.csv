[T],Shepard76,2010-10-14T00:39Z,Thanks a lot. This band is the best spanish pop band ever. Intenationally acclaimed I think this is their accolade album. I think Prince drummer was hired to play in this album. One of their finest albums. Highly recommended.
,Azafran,2010-10-15T03:37Z,"According to cd's booklet, drummer Ian Thomas played in several songs.

Regarding styles, Presuntos Implicados is a unique band in the Spanish-language music. No other pop band in the Spanish-speaking world has made their very particular combinations with influences from ballads, funk, soul, blues, Latin jazz, folk, etc. And their original ""formula"" is delightful."
