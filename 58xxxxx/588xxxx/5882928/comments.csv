,murphyo2003,2010-10-13T09:36Z,Kaspersky did not like this and removed it !
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-10-13T10:55Z,"say something clear murphyo... not ""did not like this"" OR ELSE KEEP YOUR INSINUATIONS !

I doubt you do know how o use kaspersky or registry mechanic

THERE ARE LOTS OF WORMS SWIMING HERE TRYING TO DETERMINE PEOPLE NOT TO USE TORRENTS ANYMORE.. ONE OF THE PROOFS IS WHEN DO  NOT SPEAK CLEAR BUT THROW A DOUBT AND RUN SCARED...

in spite of them i will continue cracking all software possible , some of them sharing here of course ;) so they will never stop me, never. and by the way when I post something there a dozens of IP's behind so if you are a wounded software producer... do not make a habit waiting here...won't help ;)) "
