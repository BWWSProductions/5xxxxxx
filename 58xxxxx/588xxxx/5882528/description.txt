Battle of the Blades is a Canadian figure skating reality show and competition that airs on CBC. The series resembles Dancing with the Stars, but in this case the women are famous figure skaters and the men are well-known hockey players.

If you are a fan of figure skating, ice hockey or Dancing With The Stars, this show is worth a try.

The resolution is 624x352 and is 1:07:40 long. While the video quality isn't awesome, it is quite watchable in my opinion This episode aired on CBC on Oct 03, 2010.
