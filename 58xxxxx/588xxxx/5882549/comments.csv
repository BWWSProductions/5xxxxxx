,LupinII2,2010-10-20T09:37Z,Its pretty funnny how nobody can seem to get the hint that the grainy quality of this film is intentional and not a problem with the upload. For followers of the work of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez this type of film making is no suprise. Try watching Grindhouse (the double feature film from which the fake Machete trailer first originated) and then maybe you'll understand whats going on here.
,Joe90NZ,2010-10-21T06:56Z,sweet bro
,rodrigomul,2010-10-23T16:00Z,"it IS indeed 720p. the quality is lowered in the production itself. it's a Rodriguez/Tarantino thing.

great up, thanks! ;D"
,undermaker,2010-10-24T08:18Z,yes..it is strange quality...looks like 3D...blue/magenta... :)
,MitsEvX,2010-10-25T20:51Z,"Respect the uploaders! :D If you can't say anything nice, shut your mouth, or better: keep your fingers from your keyboard......

Brenys is a trusted uploader, so you guys don't know what you're saying. The quality is good and I believer it's 720p....it's just a production thing ;-)"
,Tech.Junkie.V2,2010-10-26T00:29Z,Suck a cock mitz you wank bubble.
,Higgus,2010-10-31T14:48Z,Tech.Junkie.V2 is the dumbest moron on the planet.  His posts above prove it.
,jshityeah,2010-11-02T03:45Z,"Ummm.... Tech.Junkie.V2.... If all you can do is fucking complain at people and swear at them, then just FUCK OFF from here and go wank somewhere else. 
Because we DONT need mother fuckers like you in this community. For fucks sake just stop complaing about every fucking thing you dont like. PISS OFF

And thanks uploader, a good rip."
,jshityeah,2010-11-02T03:47Z,"@ Tech.Junkie.V2 And yeah, youve really contributed to TPB havent you? fucking moron."
,jocamero,2010-11-02T06:42Z,"Subtitles in English for foreign dialog only:

http://www.sub-titles.net/en/ppodnapisi/podnapis/i/922939/machete-2010-subtitles

(These really should have been included in the release.)"
,iRS3,2010-11-08T09:08Z,Why do all the f*****s always unpack the movies? Keep the rar-files ffs. It's much easier to d/l a few missing small rar-files than waiting for 1 big unpacked file stuck and none seeding. KEEP THE RARFILES in the future!!
,the.gonzo.bear,2010-11-25T04:32Z,"jesus guys... i don't think that a trusted uploader's gonna throw a shit quality movie just so you guys can bitch and whine... 

thats for the up brenys, you shouldn't have to justify your up! 

also Tech.Junkie.V2 is always a troll... not the first time i've seen him try to get a reaction"
,PigRapist,2010-12-10T15:38Z,Nice rip but there are hard-coded subtitles.  Cannot be removed with mkvtoolnix.  
,x25m,2010-12-11T10:04Z,Just for information the US retail bluray is out. So download this instead http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6029005
,balanced,2011-01-29T18:33Z,"How about ""NO"" let's NOT put up RAR files.  What's the point?  You need ALL the bits either way except with RAR then I need to make sure I have twice the space available to have two stupid copies of the damn thing at the same time AND assholes have the opportunity of tricking me into downloading a password-protected RAR file.  And to what purpose?  Because for some inane reason you have a fetish for pieces of RAR?  You can't do shit with RAR segments until you have the ENTIRE thing anyway so fuck that!  (At least with unrarred I can sample when enough pieces are down too)  I hate RAR in case that wasn't clear enough."
,balanced,2011-01-29T18:35Z,Oh and another thing is I have to wait 10 minutes for the RAR to unpack after it's downloaded when instead I could just start watching it.  10 minutes to wait is not a problem when it's actually FOR A REASON but wtf is the point of waiting 10 more minutes for the same damn result as when downloading it unrarred in the first place?  That's messed.
,shauwny,2011-03-07T14:07Z,"right you are balanced, plus this:
people tend to delete rar's as soon as they have finished downloading and that seriously reduces the number of seeds."
