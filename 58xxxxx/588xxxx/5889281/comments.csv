Dabanng Dvdrip -----> Coming up in 0.5 hr
Toy story Trilogy 720p -----> Coming up in 6- 8 Hrs

@ tylr 

SIze depends on movie length as well as how good the source is ........... I could have kept it around 650 Mb but than quality would have suffered and I am sure no one will have any complaint with the quality of Downfall now

@ manish

Already done Arrested development ....... Sorry about Modern Family

@ rob 

Sorry ........ not taking any TV show request atm

@ Ashu

Will do Sex and the City 2 720p when its bluray gets out"
,Perspolice,2010-10-25T07:28Z,"thnx for upload ;)

but i have a problem with watching the movie [Downfall 2004].

 the screen is not moving and its like slide show picture,,,& only sounds can be heard... i dont have this kind of problem with ur other torrents.

there is no problem with my codecs. i tested them in many ways...

and beside only kmplayer can open this. 
with vlcplayer , Mplayer Classic , BSplayer it does an error...

plz reply for solution...

GOD Bless You!"
,Perspolice,2010-10-25T07:34Z,"btw no problem with the Sample Video!

Still waiting for reply, thnx. ;)"
,Perspolice,2010-10-25T08:18Z,"ohh thnx god i found the problem! :D

in the kmplayer's Preferences>> Filter Control/Splitter i changed the Matroska's Filter and now video is just fine! no problem. ;)

thanx again. :X ;)"
,rcdcac,2010-10-30T16:25Z,"its a shit .. not english speaking audio......

might be speaking German or something else..."
,Peki95,2010-11-05T00:01Z,"@rcdcac  You n00b! This is a film about WWII and Hitler's last days.. you know, Hitlers speaks on German.. LoL "
,F110,2010-11-06T08:08Z,"Many thanks! Great quality. Plays perfectly on VLC. Thanks especially for the sample file. Also plays well on WMP (thanks to K-Lite codec pack) but for some reason, sub-titles didn't appear."
,ady4321,2010-12-02T10:20Z,"Well actually Peki95, the language says ""English"" on the description."
,rohitab,2010-12-03T16:24Z,"great movie splendid upload
than you very much Riddler
Rock and roll"
,isbent,2010-12-31T06:21Z,"strange, I can't get this to work in VLC or perrian. I haven't had any trouble playing back any of your other releases. VLC chokes and perrian shows a green screen w/ subtitles and audio. The sample works fine? 

Is any one else having issues like this?"
,mikecj,2011-01-26T14:10Z,"beware! i don't know what you lot are watching this guys uploads on?! I am watching off of a LaCinema Classic HD, through HDMI to a 37"" Sony TV. With these i am getting poor quality! Pixelated blacks and over-sharpened edges. I will stick to the 1GB+ file sizes, until someone can actually deliver on this kind of promise! Nice try, thanks for sharing, it's close but it's not quite there yet. If only you didn't over-sharpen and lower the export size so much!
let the onslaught commence!"
,Player420,2011-02-24T21:43Z,"I'm jumping through hoops to get this to play, but I finally got it. NOW NO TEXT? I don't understand wtf they're saying. WTF man?"
,Fayern,2011-05-13T21:18Z,"Superb, many thanks. The movie is in German, but there are subtitles attached to it (en, fr, pl, ro, nl, sv etc). "
,Fayern,2011-05-13T21:23Z,"And for the nth time, if your bsp player doesn't take it, use the VLC, that plays almost anything. You will find the subtitles in the dropdown menu at the top (video - subtitles track - track 2-[english]."
,superpipe,2011-05-29T07:15Z,"Hey riddler thanks for the movie.  Unfortunately, it keeps locking up on vlc.  tried everything, no luck"
,dickmittens,2011-05-31T22:50Z,"BIG thanx for this %-)

regarding subtitles: you need to keep the .srt file with the .mkv file, and preserve the original filenames. "
,ramalan,2011-06-12T11:53Z,Wrong aspect ratio. Should be 1.85:1.
,ramalan,2011-06-12T11:56Z,"End credits are intact & complete, btw."
,magi123,2011-07-11T08:46Z,"small size, great quality, thank you man"
,kadappa,2011-07-15T19:32Z,thanks :)
,swastikaha,2011-07-16T18:37Z,r u related to yify??? pardon my ignorance but u two seem very much alike but thanx for all ur rips..u r a godsend!!!
,Bargetti,2011-08-12T14:18Z,"The video played fine until I opened the subtitles in WMP and VLC. never managed to get them to work but I tried directly on Vuze's player and it worked fine. Not my Number 1 choice of video player but not like it maters too much.

Playing on a Samsung 55"" TV model UN55D8000

So if you are having bad quality on a 37"" idk what to say."
,Steelnation36,2011-08-14T10:58Z,all you people complaining about audio not being in english... the movie was made entirely in german. Ive never even seen a english dubbed version(though im sure its out there). Personally id rather read subtitles than hear crappy voice overs.
