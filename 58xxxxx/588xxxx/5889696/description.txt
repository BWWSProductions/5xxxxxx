Join Alex and crew for the Infowars Moneybomb, a 27 hour marathon to raise the money Alex needs to take his operation to the next level. Alex is not backed by the corporate media and the foundations, so his continued success relies on your support. Please make a donation on the Infowars Moneybomb page. The show was a jam-packed blockbuster featuring never before seen interviews with Paul Craig Roberts, Katherine Austin Fitts, Lord Christopher Monckton, Sherri Tenpenny, Jeffrey Smith, Rev. Clenard Childress, Alan Watt, and others. In addition, the marathon show will feature a number of live guests, including Max Keiser, Gerald Celente, Webster Tarpley, and Paul Craig Roberts.
