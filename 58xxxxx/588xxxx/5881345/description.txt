my own collection made of ebooks, audio companions, softwares i used which i hope it to be useful for turcology students, i'm sorry but i failed to find any for kazakh, but only turkish up to level II, it's impossible to find L3 on net. or maybe someone can if they're a member of private trackers like elbitz.net, bitme.org, theoccult.bz or else.

hope i was a bit of help. i wish you all the best in your studies,
erdemja.

p.s. my next upload will contain second disk of 101 languages of the world :))
