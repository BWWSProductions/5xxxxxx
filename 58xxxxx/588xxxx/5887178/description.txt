Release notes..

Autodesk SketchBook Designer 2011 illustration software joins the
SketchBook product line. Formerly known as Autodesk Alias Sketch,
Autodesk SketchBook Designer provides professional designers and
artists from all industries with a unique hybrid of paint and vector
workflows for more precise design illustration and graphic
communication. SketchBook Designer combines the same fluid freehand
drawing capabilities of SketchBook Pro with powerful editing
capabilities using mouse or pen interactions. Designers enjoy greater
creative freedom to dynamically manipulate and transform any
combination of paint, vector geometry and fills.
What's more, Autodesk SketchBook Designer for AutoCAD is an add-in
that integrates sketching and image manipulation
capabilities into AutoCAD.
