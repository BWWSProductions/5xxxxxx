""Alex welcomes back to the show physician, Republican Congressman for the 14th congressional district of Texas, and former presidential candidate, Ron Paul.""

What?! That's a special fucking event! Hurray!"
,joeblowman,2010-10-08T23:51Z,"Go ahead and delete this comment too, I have already posted it on my Rense torrent, so Goyim will still see it.

P.S.

Screw you and Shabbos Jones.

If I search for a specific title it will show up, but with 0 seeds.  Once I am downloading I connect to many peers.  I haven't heard anyone talking about this and just wondered if it were maybe on my end.  Other sites seem fine, it is only TPB.  Thanks."
