,dragonzer0,2010-10-18T08:21Z,"This game has problems for a lot of players. The Paradox forum has stated that those that have registered thier game can then get support. Wrong!!! Support is locked. So even Neocore doesn't want to hear about thier problems. For those of you that got this game to work, great. For those of us that can't will just have to wait to see if a patch comes forward from Neocore. If you go to Paradox forum you can find a new Launcher that has worked for some to at least get through the 1st battle. Good luck. "
