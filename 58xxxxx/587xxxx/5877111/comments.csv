I must admit that I will be a little inconsistent seeding upto the 22-nd of this month. However, right at this moment I find at least two peers at 71% and others at 40% or higher. I hope that this will enable to get upto 100%. If not I shall be regularly seeding again from 22-nd of this month. Till then, I am extremely sorry for my incosistency. But never give up downloading. I shall be seeding whenever I am available. Please bear with this inconvenience."
