The inspiring story of Hanneke Van Dam

2007 Crown Award Winner for Best Documentary Under $50,000 (Gold)

She had never heard abut Mongolia, until God asked her to leave everything behind and go there.

Hanneke is working as a child psychologist at the courthouse in Amsterdam. One day she is convinced that she has heard God's voice to give up her job, leave everything behind and move to Mongolia. Mongolia? She did not even know where to find it on the map! This is the start of a long journey with seemingly no end.

Mongolia is one of the coldest countries in the world. The majority of men are alcoholics, causing violent behavior and disrupting family life. Hanneke now lives in Mongolia, giving of herself to those who need it most. She has left everything behind to pursue her calling and journey into the unknown.

That unknown brought her into direct contact with struggling and broken lives. We live with her through moments of great triumph as well as heartbreaking failure. One viewer describes it as "an experience of humanity at its most basic level."
