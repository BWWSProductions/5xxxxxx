Nobody could take that discredited dope's deep thoughts on why manipulating others funds to play high finance roulette on our backs is honorable. After the profits are sent oversea when it goes belly up again on our bill. There's a new crash on it's way to once again lay the failure of his tweeterpated heart for the Ultra wealthy. Trickle anywhere economics is more Reagen cult activity that has got to go for all it's disastrous effects after thirty years of obvious economic destruction on us."
