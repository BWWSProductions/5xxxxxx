Heya Guys and Gals,


     This here is a recode and repack of the 720p .MKV version of the Eclipse fan-sub.  I have encoded them in a lengthy process (4.5 hrs per episode) to ensure maximum quality while minimizing their size. (Went from 20.9gb for the whole series to 10.7gb, I think that is a good savings for losing hardly any quality!)

     Let me know what you think and I might put some more of my recode and repacks up...

     I'm working on "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann", "Dragonaut: The Resonance" and "Samurai Seven"


Later!
