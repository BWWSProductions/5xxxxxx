hi, 

i uploaded this torrent because i thought many people would like to play red alert 2/yuri's revenge on the internet, including me.
 
Many of you wich tried this and didn't succeed got the error: shared internet co
mponents not installed. Well here they are.



Just copy the files to your Westwood folder( or wherever you got RA2 installed )

Then do the following:


Try connecting to the internet once. you will be asked to download somthing. Accept it. 



Once you're finished. Exit the game and press the win key + R, you will be shown the run prompt. 

Type this \WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts and start it.

you will then be asked how you want it to be open, select notepad. Or any other text editor, and in put these lines at the bottom..
