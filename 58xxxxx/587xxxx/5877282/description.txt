A decent man who steps outside the law finds himself falling into an abyss in this violent thriller from Philippine director Brillante Mendoza. Pepoy (Coco Martin) is a young man studying to become a policeman who has recently married his longtime girlfriend Cecille (Mercedes Cabral), with whom he has a baby. Between school, his wife and the baby, money is scarce for Pepoy, and an old friend, Abyong (Jhong Hilario), tells him he can make good money by helping out some local loan sharks with their collections. While his conscience objects, Pepoy agrees, but while the work involves scaring a few small time hoods at first, things take a grim turn when he's asked to tag along with Sarge (John Regala) and Vic (Julio Diaz) as they collect a debt from Gina (Maria Isabel Lopez), a junkie streetwalker who turns tricks under the name "Madonna." It soon becomes clear that Gina can't pay what she owes and if Sarge can't get cash, he'll take his payment in pain; he beats, rapes and tortures the woman repeatedly in the back of a van as captive Pepoy is taken along for the ride. Kinatay (the titles translates as "Slaughter") was an official selection at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.
