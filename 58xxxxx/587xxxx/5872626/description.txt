"Andy's Play"

Andy (Ed Helms) invites the entire office to 
his community theater production of Sweeney 
Todd in hopes that Erin (Ellie Kemper) will 
attend. Michael (Steve Carell) tries to put 
his jealousy aside and enjoy the performance 
while Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna 
Fischer) struggle with their incompetent 
babysitter.

Enjoy :)
