Let Me Come Over 1992 BBL 36 CD


At their best, Buffalo Tom was an incredibly tight indie three-piece, with Bill Janovitz reeling off intelligent, literate and emotional stories.  Nowhere else did this all come together than on "Taillights Fade."  That song along is worth the price of admission.  But that's not all.  "Staples," "Mineral," "Velvet Roof," "I'm Not There," "Porchlight," "Frozen Lake" and "Saving Grace" are all just slightly less amazing than "Taillights."
