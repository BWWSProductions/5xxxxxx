( before the invasion in Iraq : 20 March 2003) and the atmosphere is akin to a pep rally. Suddenly, an ill-dressed man enters  and announces that God has heard their prayers and he's ready to grant them exactly what they wish for--if that's REALLY what they want. But something happen ...Outraged by American military intervention in the Philippines during the Spanish-American War, Mark Twain wrote a short story called "The War Prayer" in 1905. Harper's Bazaar Magazine  rejected the piece, as did Twain's own publisher. Even his family and friends feared it was 'sacrilegious', and the story remained unpublished until 1923...thirteen years after his death. "I don't think the prayer will be published in my time. None but the dead are permitted to tell the truth."
