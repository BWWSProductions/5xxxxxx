Originally made for a film production assignment. After teaching myself the basics of stop-motion, "Reckless Zen" was shot over 4weeks on a zero budget, with an Olympus u700w still camera, and using recycled materials. 

Post production was completed in After Effects, and Final Cut Studio.

Featuring music by DaNnyand narrated by Surina Kelly (www.myradio1.ae), Reckless Zen is a story about taking chances, and dreaming big... even if you are made of wood.
