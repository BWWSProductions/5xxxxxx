,pariahdog,2010-11-01T17:32Z,"Information is the antidote to misinformation.

It seems that the patcher is identified correctly as a patcher by the most trusted antivirus tools. Kaspersky doesn't detect it as anything at all. It doesn't look malicious to me, but judge for yourself."
,pariahdog,2010-11-01T22:00Z,"It looks like I am one of those that is getting the ""trial has expired"" message. There is no anydvd.chk anywhere on my C drive. I have searched everywhere. I cannot get the 6.7.0.0 version to work either. Same problem. And I physically unplugged my internet connection before installing. Whereever Slysoft is storing their data it is hidden very well. I am running XP. Maybe it is easier with Windows 7."
