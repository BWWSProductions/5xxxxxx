From Tantor:

Huckleberry Finn, rebel against school and church, casual inheritor of 
gold treasure, rafter of the Mississippi, and savior of Jim the runaway 
slave, is the archetypal American maverick. 

Fleeing the respectable society that wants to "sivilize" him, Huck Finn 
shoves off with Jim on a rhapsodic raft journey down the Mississippi 
River. The two bind themselves to one another, becoming intimate friends 
and agreeing "there warn't no home like a raft, after all. Other places 
do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don't. You feel mighty 
free and easy and comfortable on a raft." 

As Huck learns about love, responsibility, and morality, the trip 
becomes a metaphoric voyage through his own soul, culminating in the 
glorious moment when he decides to "go to hell" rather than return Jim 
to slavery. 

Mark Twain defined classic as "a book which people praise and don't 
read"; The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a happy exception to his 
own rule. Twain's mastery of dialect, coupled with his famous wit, has 
made Huckleberry Finn one of the most loved and distinctly American 
classics ever written.

From Wiki:

Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a book by Mark Twain, first published 
in England in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885. 
Commonly recognized as one of the Great American Novels, the work is 
among the first in major American literature to be written in the 
vernacular, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the 
first person by Huckleberry "Huck" Finn, a friend of Tom Sawyer.

The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places 
along the Mississippi River. Satirizing a Southern antebellum society 
that was already out of date by the time the work was published, 
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an often scathing look at entrenched 
attitudes, particularly racism.

The work has been popular with readers since its publication and is 
taken as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. It has also been the 
continued object of study by serious literary critics. It was criticized 
upon release because of its coarse language and became even more 
controversial in the 20th century because of its perceived use of racial 
stereotypes and because of its frequent use of the racial slur "nigger".
