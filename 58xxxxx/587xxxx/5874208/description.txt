Genres: Drama | Family




Directed by K. Balachander

Starring Kamal Haasan, Anita Raj, Nilu Phule, Mazhar Khan, Dr. Sriram Lagoo, Karan Razdan



Kamal Haasan reprises his role as Raja, a graduate looking for work in the capital, sharing a small home with two other unemployed youth played by Karan Razdan and Arjun Chakraborty. Raja falls in love with a struggling actress (Anita Raj), whose life is likewise wretched having to take care of an old and ailing grandmother and a parasite father (Nilu Phule). "Zara Si Zindagi" gives a fairly unrelenting grim view of urban unemployment, with the usual dose of Balachander moralizing.

This is a must-watch movie, as you would really pity Kamal Haasan's character "Raja", the unemployed youth who sticks to his principles by not choosing to go on the wrong path. The movie has a fantastic story narration and some excellent scenes that is unfortunately not understood by a lot of Hindi, masala movie audiences.
