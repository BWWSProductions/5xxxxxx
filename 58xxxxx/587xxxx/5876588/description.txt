Almost twenty years on, Cracker continue to deliver the goods. 
This new album includes at least two sumptuous songs with very evocative titles: a mid-tempo ballad called 'Turn on, Tune in, Drop out With Me' and the all-out rocker 'We All Shine a Light'. 
The other tracks, too, are worth bathing in, so to speak, as if this 'Sunrise in the Land of Milk and Honey' was a warm awakening to a band as fresh now as it was at the start of its career (not to mention David Lowery's previous band, Camper Van Beethoven).
