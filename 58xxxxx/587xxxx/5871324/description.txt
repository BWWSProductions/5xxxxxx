Harlan - Hitler's Other Filmmaker



Veit Harlan was, along with Leni Riefenstahl, Nazi Germanyâ€™s most successful film director, remembered today for his infamous Jew Suss. Harlan was a master of national kitsch, exulting in melodrama and death, but he was also an extraordinary artist who ended up serving the Nazi propaganda machine.


This documentary film, the first account of his life and career, draws on his extensive film catalogue, including previously unreleased materials from the Harlan familyâ€™s private archive. Though Harlan has largely been forgotten today, the film also shows how his family still struggles with the dark myth of artistic immorality.

â€œHarlan may be forgotten, but he was an influential figure, frequently mentioned in Nazi documents and in Goebbelsâ€™s diary,â€ director Felix Moeller told the New York Times in March. â€œThat interested me as a historian, but I also wanted to know what the younger generation thinks of this. We think we know everything, but when you ask what your grandfather did on the Eastern Front, what went on in your own family, itâ€™s a different matter, and that story is important to me.â€

Also known as : Harlan â€“ In the Shadow of 'Jew SÃ¼ss'
