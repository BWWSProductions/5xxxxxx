The Pretenders - Day After Day [promo].mpg


Very rare promo music video. One of my first downloads from my collection. 
"Day After Day" from the album "Pretenders II", spins a common second-album 
narrative of unaccustomed celebrity, with the band rushing from gig to gig, 
hotel to hotel, head-spun from the swiftness of it all.
