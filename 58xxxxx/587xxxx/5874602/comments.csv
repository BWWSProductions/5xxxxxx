[V],r3dcat,2010-10-14T10:37Z,@Mario_tx69: You need to do a little reading and get a basic understanding of your options ... I can recommend this site as a good starting point for you ->  http://gwht.wikidot.com/for-dummies
,FUZZbaLLL,2010-12-26T08:53Z,"quick question... does it have to be DVD-R, cuz the dvds i have say DVD+R"
,hakuna_matata,2011-05-11T12:23Z,"@FUZZbaLLL 
Its definitely better to play off Portable HDD. Wii Can read .wdfs file itself no need to convert and burn. I use Wii-Flow"
