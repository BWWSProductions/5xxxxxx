,JASP3R77,2010-10-11T07:11Z,"
please upload a smaller size version.... the 550 mb version please..... I only have 600mb left.."
,r0ttiem0m,2010-10-11T07:15Z,Thanks!
,Reviewer,2010-10-11T08:03Z,"I agree with the ohers, can you please upload the smaller 550 mb version first. Seems from the previous uploads more people download the smaller version then the 1 gb version. It would make sense to upload the 550 mb version first, after all it's a TV show and not a full feature film so I doubt people care if it's 720p. And the fan fare for this show has seemed to die down a lot, unlike the masses who watch True Blood. Thanks."

There three things that are actually good in my shitty country: beautiful girls, fast internet and product warranty ^^"
,phipp01,2010-10-11T16:37Z,"@ reviewer I only download HD versions as I have no use or want for non HD programming.

@fishword you have very beautiful women in your country and apparently very good internet unlike us slobs in the US LOL
