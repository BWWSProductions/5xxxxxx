    The exquisite Rosslyn Chapel is a masterpiece in stone.    
    It used to be one of Scotland's best kept secrets, but    
    it became world-famous when it was featured in Dan       
    Brown's the Da Vinci Code.                                
                                                               
    Art historian Helen Rosslyn, whose husband's ancestor     
    built the chapel over 500 years ago, is the guide on a   
    journey of discovery around this perfect gem of a         
    building. Extraordinary carvings of green men, inverted    
    angels and mysterious masonic marks beg the questions     
    of where these images come from and who were the         
    stonemasons that created them? Helen's search leads her   
    across Scotland and to Normandy in search of the           
    creators of this medieval masterpiece.
