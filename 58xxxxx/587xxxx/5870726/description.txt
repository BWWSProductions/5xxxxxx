Images in Vogue was a Canadian New Wave group in the 1980s.

The band was formed in 1981 in Vancouver, and originally consisted of vocalist Dale Martindale, guitarist Don Gordon (later of Numb), synth players Joe Vizvary and Glen Nelson, bassist Gary Smith and percussionist Kevin Crompton. The band's manager was Kim Clarke Champniss, later to become a MuchMusic VJ.

The band released four EPs before their full-length debut, 1985's In the House. Their first notable chart hit was "Lust for Love", from the 1983 self-titled EP. Gordon left the band in 1984, and was replaced by Ed Shaw.

Their song "In the House" won the 1986 CASBY Award for Single of the Year, with the band named Group of the Year.

Crompton left Images in Vogue in 1986, indicating that the band was too commercial for his tastes, and concentrated on his side project Skinny Puppy.
