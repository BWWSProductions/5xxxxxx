Bodycallâ€™s "Mechanically Recovered Meat" contains own remixes of bandâ€™s previously released songs. As usual in this musical genre, a remix means that the songs were completely re-written and have musically little in common with the original ones. 

The style ranges from Dark Electro and Aggrotech to just Techno or Rave. Very dancefloor-worthy, merges together elements of commercial techno-trance and alternative dark electronic scene.

Those following aggressive but melodic and danceable music from the borderland of electro-industrial and commercial, party-oriented techno and trance will be more than pleased with this release.
