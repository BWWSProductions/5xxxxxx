On the 8th of March 2010, an electronic version of the CD booklet was made available, with full information on all songs and some new group portraits of all current Libera members. Two new boys, Mine (pronounced â€œMinn-ay) Akpobone (second from the left in the top row of the second photo) and Luke Collins (far right in the same row) are listed as members of the latest Libera roster. Tom Cully is also pictured, and is credited with assisting on the production of the album.

The video below takes a look behind the scenes of the photo shoot that produced the angelic group portraits in the Peace CD booklet:
