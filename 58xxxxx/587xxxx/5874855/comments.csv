,IAmJose,2011-08-01T00:02Z,I can't get this ISO to play in VLC nor can I extract the ISO with 7-Zip. Is anyone else having this problem. Has anyone found a solution?
,IAmJose,2011-08-01T22:14Z,"Update: I didn't read the notes carefully, it needs to be extracted with poweriso then you need to navigate to the right folder with vlc and it'll work. On a side note I tried playing the ISO straight from my Patriot PBO Core media player and it just worked straight off the bat. Thanks for the upload!"
