Franck Avitabile continues to grow as a pianist with his second Dreyfus
release. An earlier CD was produced by the late pianist Michel Petrucciani, who
obviously saw this newcomer as one filled with promise. Although Petrucciani
died just prior to the taping of these sessions, he is obviously present in the
spirit of Avitabile's playing. Joined by veteran first-call bassist Niels
Pedersen and drummer Roberto Gatto, the pianist starts off with an attractive
original jazz waltz, "Miss Laurence." He follows it up with a well disguised and
somewhat dark introduction to Dave Brubeck's normally joyful "In Your Own Sweet
Way"; his journey through this often recorded jazz standard is also atypical. He
also avoids predictability with his intriguing chart of Dizzy Gillespie's "Con
Alma" and the venerable standard "Cherokee." His "Right Time!" is a smoking bop
number that features Pedersen's tremendous solo chops, while "Song for Evan" is
a touching ballad that has an almost reverent quality. Louis Petrucciani,
Michel's brother, takes over for Pedersen on his own soulful "Blues for the
Stars" and the leader's samba-flavored "Facin' Up." Highly recommended.
