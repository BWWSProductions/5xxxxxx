also seed dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets you upload  the faster your upload speed  the faster you downloadspeed is  thats how bittorent works.
im not a hypocrite sometimes when i go to post info tpb says error etc failed to write..i dont have time to remember to go back to the files i couldnt help out on..so if u spot files needing info please help out
