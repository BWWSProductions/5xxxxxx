"In Re: Curtis Farwell"  

Garza (Jimmy Smits) and his team fight 
to expose the truth about car accidents 
that are being caused by tire rod 
defects, but Al (David Ramsey) 
questions Garza's motives in taking the 
case. Elsewhere, Mereta (Ellen Woglom) 
prepares for her first day in court, 
Eddie (Jesse Bradford) scores an 
interview with a big law firm, and 
Lucinda (Carly Pope) takes on a new 
"job." Meanwhile, Claire (Melora 
Hardin) tries to get Garza to mend 
fences with Senator Vidalin (Richard 
Portnow) at a fundraiser, but Garza is 
hesitant to play nice while there is a 
mysterious man threatening the team.

Enjoy :)
