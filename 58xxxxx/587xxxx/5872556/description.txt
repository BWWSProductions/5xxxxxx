"Let's Stay Together"

Jack (Baldwin) must appear before Congress 
to discuss NBC's merger with KableTown. He 
hopes that he will charm celebrity members 
(guest star Rob Reiner), but one 
Congresswoman, Regina Bookman (guest star 
Queen Latifah), demands more diversity in 
its programming lineup. Jack quickly 
enlists Tracy (Tracy Morgan) to come up 
with some new development ideas. Meanwhile, 
Liz (Tina Fey) is fed up with the flack 
her writing staff gives her, and Jenna 
(Jane Krakowski) helps Kenneth (Jack 
McBrayer) reapply to the extremely 
competitive Page Program.

Enjoy :)
