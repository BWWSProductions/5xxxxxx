and up yours f19, sometimes I am lucky to get as fast as 1Kb and you're whining about 1 Mb. Shut up you spoiled brat. TV team is where I get my best dload speeds, you are bitchin about 3 hours and over 50 percent, and it is probably gonna take me 3 or 4 days to download this"

,ynos9169,2010-10-11T20:48Z,"Never mind my last comment, it does work. 

Thanks for the torrent!"

Got this first time around at Nordic-T

Didn't work.

Just got it again from here, and it doesn't work.

Thanks for using a retarded codec that nobody has this week ANGELiC!

I'm assuming it's corrupted, no group would fuck up this badly."
