 Alex, a sailor on leave, recovers from a drink-induced  
 blackout with a large sum of money belonging to Edna    
 Bartelli, a b-girl who invited him home to "fix her     
 radio." He tries to return it with the reluctant aid of 
 June Goth, a sweet but oh-so-tired dance hall girl;     
 they find Edna murdered. Not quite sure he didn't do it 
 himself, Alex and June have four hours in the dead of   
 night to find the real killer before his leave ends.    
 Their quest brings them into contact with a sleazy      
 kaleidoscope of minor characters; clues get more and    
 more tangled...
