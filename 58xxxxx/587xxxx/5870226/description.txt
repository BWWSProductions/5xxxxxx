Spider the videogame is an awesome platformer for PS1.
Unfortunately, history did it\'s part in burrying it, as wel as its soundtrack.

The score was composed by the famous Barry Leitch, who has a total of 240 scores in his career.
Yes, he\'s the man who did Drakan, Top Gear, and heaps of others (see http://www.barryleitch.com)

This here is a direct audio rip from the game\'s cd.
(big ups to equinoxfan82 from ytube for kindly providing it from his private collection! )


Custom-made hq front/back cover included.


p.s. An additional 2 tracks have been given to one fan by mr. Leitch himself, but they were of poor quality (128kbps) so I\'ve decided to leave them out.
