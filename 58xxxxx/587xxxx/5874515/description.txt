
This is the 3rd Season Premiere from September 1972, 
and in addition to The Jackson 5 (with Michael 
singing his weakest material ever) there are some 
funny bits and cameo appearances by famous actors 
who weren't credited including Larry Storch, 
Wilfred Hyde-White, and in the opera sketch Howard Keel!

Governor Ronald Reagan also appeared to interact with 
Sonny & Cher, and that's what this episode is most famous for.
