Killswitch Engage - Life To Lifeless [promo].VOB



HQ very rare promo music video. 'Life To Lifeless' is off of "Alive or Just Breathing", which is the last album to contain vocalist Jesse Leach, who left the band because of depression. It is also the last album to feature Adam Dutkiewicz as the drummer, who immediately switched to guitar after production for the album finished. (video does not have any logos)
