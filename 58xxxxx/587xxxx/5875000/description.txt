Hadrians Wall

Walk the 74-mile barrier that marked the edge of the Roman Empire with world-renowned scholars.

Built by Roman soldiers to mark the boundary of their empire, Hadrian's Wall runs for 74 miles across the hills and valleys of Northern England. Well over a thousand years after the Roman Empire collapsed, this edifice stands in mute testament to its long-ago builders, a tantalizing treasure that still holds many secrets archeologists and historians are eager to uncover.
