,wira020,2010-10-07T13:53Z,"Hye there.. i'm just wondering why u use HE format profile?.. most guides on the web recommends the use of LC... they say it's because LC is better and more compatible... btw, I hope you'll continue doing small size encodings.. it really helps people like me who bandwidth constrained.. thanks and keep up the good work.. will comment more when I watched this movie..."
