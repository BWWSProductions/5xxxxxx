Converted by me from .lit Microsoft\'s format, to open FB2 format, to fight monopolistic copyrasts, by preventing the spread of proprietary format trough TPB.
This will also allow people outside MS Windows to read these books.

How To Open: To open this format you\'ll need FBReader: download here:

Known Issues: Some of the later books contain minor scanning errors.
