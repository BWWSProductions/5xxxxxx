Rage Against The Machine - Bombtrack [promo].VOB



HQ very rare promo video. This music video was released, depicting support for 
the Sendero Luminoso Maoist revolutionary group and its leader Abimael Guzman. 
Interestingly the video clip did not appear on the group's first home video, 
citing Rage's first altered political opinion. In 2003, the video finally appeared as bonus material on their "Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium" DVD.
