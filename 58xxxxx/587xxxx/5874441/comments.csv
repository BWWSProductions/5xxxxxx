poorest/primitive slum in Beijing to film. Most of Beijing is NOT like that. The city is very
modern. I was there last year. The public toilets are regular ones we're used to seeing in the western world.

They must have had to search pretty far and wide to find a bad public restroom for this episode. It was probably in some slum in the poor part of town. 

I also get the feeling they wanted to
reinforce stereotypes too which really don't exist anymore. Shame on them."

If you wan't complete truth go watch discory channel.  People take things too seriously.  Shame on you for not getting the show for what it is.  "
