Fitch & Washington and Longford & Majahan are assigned to what appears to be a deceptively straightforward investigation -- a woman is murdered in an apparent robbery -- but this is far from an open and shut case. The detectives discover that the victim was a squatter in Brush Park, and they've tripped over something much bigger. Meanwhile, Stone and Sanchez find themselves drawn into the intriguing case of a murdered teenager found along with his father, a Vietnam veteran, who is severely beaten but still alive. Their investigation leads them to uncover a murderous scam involving vintage cars.
