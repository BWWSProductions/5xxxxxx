,carnis666,2010-10-11T04:32Z,i only have a 1gig memstick and i was wondering how i could put segments of the game on it
,ErickM,2010-10-11T08:04Z,@carnis666 well my advice to you would be that you try to download an ISO to CSO converter to shrink it so that it fits your memory stick. If you tell me what OS you have on your PC maybe I can try to recommend you one.
