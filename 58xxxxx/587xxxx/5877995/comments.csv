Anyway dont you love this site. When a game comes out lots of people want to get in there by uploading the game instead of us all sticking to the one upload."

,devil3279,2010-10-11T05:32Z,"When i checked in demonoid site, one user has posted the steps to play MOH without the crack. 

I have not tried this steps as i'm still downloading .. Who have already downloaded can try out these steps and let everyone know if it is working or not.. Please do post your feedback after trying these steps.. (i'm just copy paste the steps the user has posted in demonoid site. i'm not responsible if it is not working!!)

----------------------------------------------------

I got it working with Daemon Tools Lite. Maybe uninstall DT Pro and follow my instructions:
Yes, thanks to other commenters I got singleplayer working.
Hereâ€™s what you should do:
1. Install latest Daemon Tools Lite.
2. Download the latest Y.A.S.U. from ......files.cdmediaworld.com/YASU_1.6_9040.zip
3. Unrar in your Daemon Tools Lite directory.
4. Close Daemon Tools Lite and rename dtlite.exe to daemon.exe
5. Start Daemon Tools Lite by starting daemon.exe
6. Mount Medal Of Honor Limited Edition MULTi3 CLONEDVD-P2P
7. Start Y.A.S.U. and click Cloak
8. Start Medal Of Honor
9. It WILL say something along the lines of â€œUse the real disk, not a backupâ€
10. Click OK.
11. Click Uncloak in Y.A.S.U.
12. Click Cloak in Y.A.S.U.
13. Start Medal of Honor
14. Play!
