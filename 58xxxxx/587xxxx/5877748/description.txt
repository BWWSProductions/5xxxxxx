Former pro-wrestler â€œStone Coldâ€ Steve Austin and martial arts star Gary Daniels are appearing together in the actioner HUNT TO KILL.

Austin stars as a border guard who is taken prisoner, along with his 17-year-old daughter, by a gang to help track down members of a rival gang. Daniels portrays one of the villains.

The film is currently shooting in and around Vancouver under the direction of Leoni Waxman.

Both actors previously worked on Sylvester Stalloneâ€™s THE EXPENDABLES. Daniels will next be seen in Dwight Littleâ€™s TEKKEN. Austinâ€™s DAMAGE, which was recently released on DVD in the U.K. is supposedly heading to theaters in the U.S. in the early part of 2010.
