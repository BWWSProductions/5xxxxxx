Right ?

[V],scene4all,2010-10-10T20:06Z,"@NischayProc yes it only generates keys and how do you expect this to upgrade your pc unless you go to:

For upgrading for example Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 Ultimate you have to go to:
Start–> in search bar enter anytime —>start anytime prog —> start cdkey generator—>generate cdkey —> enter CD-Key

think twice before you post comments, i haven't created any dupe accounts."

I am new to 7 and don't know much about it"
,j2progeny,2010-10-18T07:55Z,"well if this can upgrade windows OS from starter to any Edition you want then this is legitimate even if it generates only a single serial...
what's important is it can upgraded the OSs' Edition... 
if you should want to update your serial then get another activator here in thepiratebay so won't have the problem with the Legit activation key later...
that's the purpose of thepiratebay."
,bells24,2010-10-20T07:36Z,"I was very skeptical at first but it worked great. After downloading, i extracted with winwar and i had windows 7 home but I used the keygen to generate a code for ultimate and now I have ultimate and it works great!"

[V],scene4all,2010-10-31T12:10Z,@kurtly before upgrading from premium to ultimate was your O.S activated ? and the answer to your question is yes it will stop working. so if you need to activate use a windows 7 loader or Remove WAT.
,kurtly,2010-11-02T07:01Z,"@scene4all  thanks for your response, i dont know if i activated it initially,probably not.   i am a rookie with this stuff, can u please tell me what is a windows 7 loader? or remove WAT? Ive got 17 days left. Thanks for your time."
[V],scene4all,2010-11-02T19:20Z,"OK, Windows 7 loader or Remove WAT will allow you to activate your O.S. So here are the links:

Windows7 Loader - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5901658/Windows.7.Loader.v1.9.3-DAZ

RemoveWAT - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5883552/RemoveWAT_v2.2.6.0.rar

If your not able to activate your O.S with Windows7 Loader then try using the RemoveWAT, either way you will be able to activate your windows. Hope this helps :)"
,kurtly,2010-11-04T10:51Z,downloaded loader - all good now! thanks again cheers!

this is a real program, it works.
for scene4all--
this is not a keygen, did you get it from some where else? or did you just make it yourself and got the keys from somewhere else?
but anyways, thanks man this is greatly appreciated. i upgraded from premium to ultimate. now i dont have to pay for more stuff!!!!"

Can anybody please help me?"
,stilldasame,2011-08-10T10:23Z,"@Noogieman and others;

In order to try another Product Key than the one you might have unsuccessfully entered, you need to open regedit (Start button>Search programs and files>regedit) and go to this folder using the panel on the left:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsAnytimeUpgrade

Right click on ProductKey, choose ""Modify..."" and enter your other key."

I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong. I'm not looking to upgrade, just simply active my current Windows 7 Ultimate.

When I click generate it says: ""Copy this into anytime upgrade"" does this mean I am to copy the code that was generated somewhere into the actual program I am using to generate it? 

Any help will be greatly appreciated, thank you."
,kill1234,2011-08-18T00:45Z,"For all of you who don't understand:
1. Run the keygen, select version, generate.

5. Agree to License terms.

,Noxway,2011-08-30T22:36Z,"@scene4all  Whos the Idiot moron. Its not a key generator.. A keygen will actually produce more than 2 keys!. You just found to keys you put into a crap program a 5 year old could write. Press here OR here to produce key!!? and then Magically two keys appear out of nowere!! WOW!!! IM SO IMPRESSED at your NooB script! Its the same keys over and over again at all the same.. You could easily be workin at the local Computer shop and write it down in the palm of your hand and then put it into this ""keygen"" as you would call it. A Actual keygenerator will generate different sets of keys. this one produce the same ones over and over. The whole IDEA of a key gen you imbecile is to actually randomize KEYS! IDIOT!. So shut your hole and go back to something useful as whiping your ass . And to all you others that will take a piss at me now.. Try this Amazing keygenerator and see if you find more than 2 sets of keys.. Contra an actual Keygenerator that will produce multiple DIFFERENT keys all the time."

It's installing Windows 7 Professional right now!

This is what I did:
1. Type in the keys (DO NOT COPY AND PASTE, IT WILL NOT WORK)
2. Let it verify the key (could take a while)
3. Once it verifies the key, accept the terms.
4. Some have said to NOT click Upgrade and just restart. But that hasn't worked for me. I clicked Upgrade and re-started RIGHT AWAY. Do not exit the Upgrade window. Just go to Start > Restart. 
5. Hopefully when your PC restarts, it says ""Upgrading Windows"" and you should have the your new OS on the bottom of the blue loading screen. (Mine used to say ""Windows 7 Home"" and now it says ""Windows 7 Professional""). 

Hope that helps! Good luck!"

When it was done verifying and restarting and such, I was on Ultimate.
