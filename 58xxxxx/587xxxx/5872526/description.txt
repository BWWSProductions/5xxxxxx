"The Psychology of Letting Go"

Pierce (Chevy Chase) deals with the death of 
his mother and the group comes together to 
comfort him in his time of need. Professor 
Duncan (John Oliver) struggles to take over 
the anthropology class with no training, as 
Professor Bauer (Betty White) takes an 
unexpected leave of absence after her 
classroom hijinks put Jeff Winger (Joel 
McHale) in the hospital.

Enjoy :)
