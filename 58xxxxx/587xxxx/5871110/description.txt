Carole King and James Taylor reunited at the intimate Hollywood venue in concert
in 2007 to play their era-defining hits, nearly four decades after they first performed
at the Troubadour in November 1970, a year before their Tapestry and Sweet Baby
James' albums stormed the American charts. King and Taylor are backed by the
Section, the same band that propelled those albums into homes around the world.

James Taylor had released his first album on the Beatles' Apple label, Carole King
was struggling to forge a new solo career after being one half of Goffin-King, one of
the great Brill Building songwriting partnerships of the early 60s. Their musical
friendship blossomed with Taylor's support for King and his cover of her song
You've Got a Friend. The Troubadour became the centre of a new singersongwriter
culture that also featured the likes of Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt and
many more.
