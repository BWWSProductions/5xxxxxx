Dual audio - this is an English audio movie along with a 
Russian+English dubbed audio track alternative too as an available choice

No subtitles are offered here. Sorry

The video is a DivX 824 X 368 video resolution
We downloaded this movie version as a 2GB mkv format file
- All we did was remove one audio track which was unnecessarily there
and change the format to DivX avi with 128kb on the two remaining
audio tracks (each). This reduced the file size by more than half altogether!
We made no change to the video resolution and bitrate settings.
its a lovely and nicely sharp picture by the way, on the test station here.

Victor Victoria is a most favorite of my movies personally in that I find
it does wonders for the spirit to have Julie Andrews and Robert Preston
repartee as they do in situations that certainly do serve as inspiration
to loftier attempts to articulate with clever wit, and with intelligence
that is as I say, in great sprit, I say!

The "restaurant scene" is unforgettable and a "tour de force"
around the Hollywood sets when you consider their more recent exploits
at the box office, by comparison.

We will soon have an HD DivX widescreen 2GB version for all to share.


we ask for your seeding support for Russian language constituents
We have long wanted to offer something to the Russian people whom I love dearly!
Spaceba! Michael Rizzo Chessman
