,haiti1800,2010-10-09T22:43Z,"hey will this game work if i put it on my ps3,i jailbreak my ps3 with the PS JAILBEAK USB STICK"
,rurik1967,2010-10-09T23:10Z,ya it will work
,rurik1967,2010-10-09T23:40Z,"@haiti1800 games played off the INT PS3 hard drive must be placed inside the Launch12345 Directory or whatever directory you chosen for your default game directory, and NOTE must be the correct game ID folder, for example, this game is BLUS30574. I already did the work for you,and created that folder and placed the game files inside.

EXT Hdd must go in a golder named GAMEZ in root directory, but you can change the name of the game ID folder if you wish to make it easier for you to know what games you have on your hard drive by just looking at them, IE rename BLUS30574 to NBA 2K11, or you can jsut keep the BLUS30574 on your external Hdd, me personally I dont like all those numbers and letters, so I just make the first folder of the game, the game title.

Last thing, every game has a 2KB SFO file in main game directory, if you open this up with notepad, and scroll all way to the right, you will see the GAME ID folder of that game. Comes in handy when you get a game where it doesnt contain the game folder.

Also do a google search for ps3 jailbreak game compatability chart. some games will work on both INT and EXT drives, others just INT, some not at all."
,poeticpyro,2010-10-10T02:48Z,"You are the man!  Much much appreciated.

Madden worked perfectly and I'm seeding it now :)"
,haiti1800,2010-10-10T03:25Z,"@rurik1967 thank you for all the information but im a little bit lost,can you please email me at haiti954@yahoo.com and let me know its you from thepiratebay"
,haiti1800,2010-10-10T03:37Z,"@rurik1967 hey thank you for the information and i am still a little lost,can you please give me your email so i can email you.don't put your email as it suppose to be because it will get delete.i hope you get what i mean,but you can email me at haiti954 @ yahoo dot com"
,poeticpyro,2010-10-10T03:56Z,"Damn, I don't know who it was seeding but I was getting 1.2MB/sec for the first 10% but now I'm down to 25-50kb/s.

No biggy, will just let it go for 2 days again like Madden :)"
,koontaki,2010-10-10T04:45Z,have u got a ps2 copy of this? thank you :)
,rurik1967,2010-10-10T06:46Z,"Ment to include this in the torrent info,

this game works with Hermes v3 and OM 1.4.2 or greater with no controller issues, and should work fine with EXT Hdd, Ive personally only tested on 1 of my PS's INT Hdd.

Heres a link for a combatability check list, theres a couple, I jsut personally use this one, for ease to find a game.

,shingoong,2010-10-10T09:45Z,[font=Segoe print]Thank u Very Much[/font]
,poeticpyro,2010-10-12T02:41Z,"Errr!  Finally finished but controller is not working.

It won't respond to any keys pressed.  Can't even get past start screen when I press START.

Anyone else having this issue?"
,rurik1967,2010-10-12T02:48Z,"You need to use OM 1.4 + with Hermes 3, should clear up controller issues. "
,poeticpyro,2010-10-12T03:22Z,"OM is Open Manager correct?

If so, the most recent one is 1.14.2 not 1.4.2....which is what I'm using.

What exactly is Hermes?  I use PSFreedom on my Nexus One to hack my phone.  Not sure what I'm missing.."
,rurik1967,2010-10-12T03:50Z,"use the latest OM the current one i think is 1.6 or 1.7. The current PSgroove i think has the hermes v3. I use a psbreak v1.1 myself, im  not to up on the psgroove part of the scene."
,poeticpyro,2010-10-12T04:41Z,"OK, I just found 1.16 (searched a lot, this seems to be the most current one) and I have I'm pretty sure the newest Nexus One jailbreak (I stay way way up to date on my phone, I do a lot of hacking on my phone).

I'll try installing 1.16 and see if that helps."
,cm8724,2010-10-12T04:48Z,"ok after i dl this
all these came up BLUS30574.7z.001 thru BLUS30574.7z.021

i am using filezilla
i drag those into the directory
/dev_hdd0/game/OMAN46756/GAMEZ/BLUS-30574
after i do that.. i try to load it on Open Man 1.4 and it says EBOOT.BIN not found
i dont know what im doing wrong?? :("
,poeticpyro,2010-10-12T07:40Z,"Yeah, its still not working man.

With the newest backup manager it says to use R2 to activate patched mode which will fix controller issues on games with those issues but when I do that it tells me eboot.bin is not present for NBA 2k11 and I've triple checked and its there.

I don't know what else to do.  Controller is not working."
,rurik1967,2010-10-12T07:47Z,@8724 you didnt unpack the 7z files
,poeticpyro,2010-10-12T08:15Z,"OK, sorry for cluster fucking the hell out of the comments but I got it to work.

With the recent OM like you said, it WOULD NOT work for me on internal HDD.  I tried for hours.

I just tried external HDD and it worked first shot.  Was able to boot in patched mode with it externally stored.

Thanks and I will continue to seed :)"
,cm8724,2010-10-12T11:38Z,omg it worked..thanks for the help rurik :)..what other games you gonna upload if you dont mind me me asking??
,berkaaant,2010-10-12T22:11Z,"Great job man!

,aduonuab,2010-10-13T00:16Z,"Horny young Florencia asks to God, please tell me God wy did you give mother that nice hair, then Gods voice is booming in the sky and says, so you can love hair too Florencia. Then Gods voice appears again in the sky and asks, tell me who you are Florencia. Florencia answers, i`m Florencia the daughter of the local town major, i didn`t ask who his daughter you are,but who you are God answers, shy she says, i`m Florencia and i have to confess i do girls and boys both. God answers, i didn`t ask you if you bisexual or not but who you are. I visit every week the church she says, i didn`t ask you what you are doing but who you are God answers again. And so the questions did go on, every thing she said didn`t seem to be the right answer. Then he said, do you like to know who you are, shall i tell it to you? The only thing we can be in our mind or in our nature is or a woman or a man, all the rest is imagination of our personality. Nature it is humans are, and already for hundred thousands of generations, and will stay like that.

Who do you think you are finally she asks God,
well he says, the answer to that question is amazingly easy, i`m a product of humans suffering, of their love compassion and solidarity to eachother. Being unknowing and stuppid truly does let most people suffering in whole their life, being a true human will change the border between being nature and being just a human, life in mind will get endless of it, and it will make you free from suffering.
