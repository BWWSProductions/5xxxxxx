,greenteagod,2010-11-26T22:26Z,Any comments on Quality? Are these DVD rips?
,greenteagod,2010-12-24T08:43Z,"Well seasons 1-4 are good. Seasons 5 and 6 are total shit with random tags and intros from various crap ""rippers"". 

The remainder are decent, though they're largely 350mb rips and of the same quality as 1-4 which are the 233mb rips. 

Skip seasons 5 and 6 on this one and get them from another source, otherwise it's a pretty good torrent."
