This is such a great original progressive heavy rock metal record that is so
amazingly from the late eighties. It still sounds totally modern and very new 
and fresh, in style and vision. 

The guitarist and drummer are so amazingly skilled, crafting unpredictable riffs 
and tunes, even so it is still and hugely catchy rockin album with great deep 
meaning, lyrics themes and vision. Fantasic stuff. 

I very rarely give a 5-star rating to anything, but this is Kings Xs finest hour 
and this really is a truly special album. 
Timeless songwriting, excellent musicianship, enough soul and feeling to last the 
average listener a lifetime and it always sounds fresh every time you go back to it.
 
It showcases Kings Xs ability to draw together an eclectic mix of styles, you will 
not be disappointed.

On Gretchen Goes to Nebraska theres more of that pumping rock sound, but with a little 
more sophistication, particularly on the vocals. 
The melodies are catchy but not "poppy" and the harmonies are especially complex. 

The band were showing more sophistication in their song writing, musically as well as 
lyrically, and this is demonstrated in a tighter feel to the production.
 
For me, this is Kings X at their creative best, and while subsequent Atlantic releases 
follow in the same vein as this album, they dont have the edge that this recording does. 

Top tracks include; Over my Head, Summerland and Pleides.
