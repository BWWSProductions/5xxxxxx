Need an install disk cause the original disk is damaged by a defective DVD drive. Now I ordered an original install disk at Apple USA. It will take a long, long, long time to get it."

,sambtravis,2011-04-02T02:28Z,Does this have the Boot Camp drivers on it or will i need an actual disk to access the Boot camp drivers for this model? I lost my disk and can't install windows because the necessary drivers for wireless and speakers aren't on it.
