HI, I know this is not the Place to ask this, but if someone could answer...
I have a LT 1.7 XBOX360... Its dashboard is 8955.... If I update it to 9199, will I still be able to play these copied games???
GENERAL QUESTION: Updating dashboard could destroy the ability to read copied games??
THANKS A LOT!!!"
