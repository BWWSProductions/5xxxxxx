,flow892,2010-10-09T14:22Z,"VP88, Does this download will also contain the Trojan as the individual uploads that you have previously posted?"
,gzoe239,2010-10-21T04:52Z,Flow892 did you end up downloading this torrent?
,flow892,2010-10-21T13:34Z,"No, because I had already downloaded the individual ones previously posted by VP88.

Let me share with you that I am still able to play them, but with more precautions.  For example I increased my firewall security and now I block any program I am not familiar with from opening a back door, including each executable from these Schweser videos.  Yes, I know, I should have put in place this practice a long time ago, I guess I was too trusting or too careless?

Thanks VP88, for letting us download/watch these videos."
,stalin00,2010-10-22T18:23Z,"VP88, do you have CD 15 and 16?"
,stalin00,2010-10-22T18:24Z,"Oups... my bad, it's already there"
,stalin00,2010-10-22T19:16Z,"VP88, can you upload a new version of CD14? It seems like Segment 2 of CD 14 is empty. There's not video there. The content is only 1MB. 

Thanks a lot!"
,gzoe239,2010-10-23T06:18Z,"Stalin I dont have the videos but have you caught any viruses from downloading this torrent?
"
,stalin00,2010-11-01T04:35Z,"gzoe239, sorry for the delayed response. No, I haven't noticed any viruses. Content looks perfect. I saved it on separate CDs and I've already watched half of them."
,stalin00,2010-11-01T04:36Z,"VP88, you'll be the best if you upload Segment 2 of CD 14. This stuff is golden."
,retzsalf,2010-12-15T15:50Z,Hey VP88! I was wondering if you have the qbank for level 1 2011? The 2010 version will disable on December 31. It would be just great. Thanks for this upload anyway
,bitcop,2011-05-19T10:12Z,"To use the QBank after expiry just change the system date to any date in 2010 when you want to use it then it should work. 

Note that 10% of the CFA L1 syllabus has changed mostly with the replacements in Reading 12 with Technical Analysis. Full details here:

,Deserthawk1,2011-07-09T06:43Z,I am only able to play the first 5 CD's somebody please help if you are able to play all of them. when I click on presentation nothing appears from 6th CD onwards.
,Zman80,2011-07-12T05:30Z,"Deserthawk1:
On a superficial viewing, it seems that all the file names from CD 6 and onwards use the file prefix .ISO instead of .iso like in the five first files. Try changing that."
,Deserthawk1,2011-07-12T09:14Z,Zman80 u r right abt that TY for d response but anyways I was using power archjver to extract files but then i used winrar & everything is working fine.
