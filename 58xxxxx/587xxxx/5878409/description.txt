Frank is a filmmaker who brings a group of actresses to a cabin in the woods to make a
film. While there they stumble upon a book, a book that belongs to the Book Keeper.
The book is in no way an ordinary book, as it brings demons to earth, and now Frank
and his actresses are the only ones to stop them.
