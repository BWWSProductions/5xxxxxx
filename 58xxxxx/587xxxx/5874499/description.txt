ScaraOS
Description
ScaraOS is a 32bit mutiboot OS kernel for IA32 (PC/AT) systems. I wrote it to teach myself OS fundamentals and just to have a bit of fun. It already has PCI support, the beginnings of a paged memory management system, and the start of a VFS layer. It supports the basic PC/AT stuff such as timer, PIC, keyboard, floppy.
The most recent version includes a working inode and dentry cache, pre-emptive multi-tasking, demand loading and a system call interface. The only implemented system calls so far are exec(2), open(2), close(2), read(2), write(2), and exit(2). Implementations of fork(2) and others are currently pending on the next milestone, context switching to and from userspace. You can look at a pretty screenshot.
More details are available on the wiki page which I am maintaining as a sort of pseudo-blog about scaraOS development.
