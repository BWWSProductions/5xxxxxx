Does anyone know how to speed it up ?"

On your question, not sure on the torrent thing, normally it should only take only a few secs as you are only uploading the torrent file which is tiny and then you seed to people from your computer and then everyone peer to peer shares it (I think). There are other site you can load to as you know. The TPB problem should be temporary (hopefully), take care."

I don't know much about uploading, I'm just pleased that it works. I set it going then go to bed. It would be nice though if it would upload in 1 hour.
The speed is usually ~30kbps and there are usually ~50 downloading for the first couple of days.
