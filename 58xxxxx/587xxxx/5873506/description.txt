Jolicloud 1.0 - The Anywhere OS

Jolicloud is not a traditional OS. It was built for netbook users to leverage the Cloud and make their life easier.

Jolicloud is designed to work with as many different netbooks as possible. In fact it is one of the only distros to support the GMA500  out of the box. It is based on 9.04 - but don't worry about this older version number, Jolicloud has some of it's own repositories to provide more up to date packages to it's users.
