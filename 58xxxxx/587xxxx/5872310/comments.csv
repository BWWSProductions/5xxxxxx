,PhilLesh12,2010-10-08T05:23Z,"Cool!

What happened to Ferrelas?  He should have posted his copy of this by now."
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-08T06:16Z,"Yep, it's real.  

Karl Pilkington is amazing.

This guy is so basic, so provincial and uninterested in the larger world, it's actually funny."
,zarutobi,2010-10-08T12:19Z,"ferrelas got banned from thebox, so he asked me to give karl to you!"
,-watkinz-,2010-10-08T12:36Z,Speed seems to be ridiculously slow?
,-watkinz-,2010-10-08T12:56Z,"Never mind, speed was an error on my side..it's rather fast and quality is great.
Cheers."
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-09T06:29Z,"That sucks that Ferrelas got banned.

So how are you going to avoid being banned by thebox, too?

...and, why do they care if you repost elsewhere?  

I mean, really?  Isn't the whole point to get this stuff out there?"
,milesbennettdyson,2010-10-09T22:49Z,Cheers for the upload. Love ya.
