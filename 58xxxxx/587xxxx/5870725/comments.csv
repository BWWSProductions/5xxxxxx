,lukereid82,2010-10-17T14:48Z,Thanks.   Limewire worked great. But 1 problem. Everytime I open limewire it downloads 64mb of AVG update. Seems to be downloading the same thing everytime. I have norton 360. Do I need AVG too? I don't really want it so if do is there a way past it? Thanx in adv
,wtfux,2010-10-17T20:12Z,"lmao stupid limewire made me auto patch to 5.16..

,mdetel,2010-10-18T15:40Z,"sorry about the multiple post... obviously, I didn't give the first or second comment time to post..."
,bytor10464,2010-10-19T18:57Z,"Regarding the ""auto-update"" features.... just go into your limewire folder and you'll see the auto-update icon... you can delete that icon and the program will still work fine and NOT auto-update... but of course, if they say they ""no longer support your version"", then you'll still have to find another working one... which keeps Chatt in ""job security"", I'd suppose!!!"

,bytor10464,2010-10-26T23:10Z,"Chatt . . . . Limewire is dead.... killed / read the below, about theiur updates, including this recent one...

""Toxic version"" 

So how does a company ""turn off"" a peer-to-peer network, that, by its nature, remains decentralized? 

""Over the past few months, part of the consent injunction stated that Lime Wire needed to build in stopgaps to make sure that could happen,"" the source said. ""So people have been updating to a toxic version [of LimeWire]. It has a central switch that allows them to turn it on and off."" 
Gnutella clients establish peering connections across a few local leaf nodes, then out to ""ultrapeers,"" which serve as more localized hubs, connecting to other ultrapeers, and in turn, to hundreds of leaf nodes across a number of hops. 

Beginning with about version 4.18, LimeWire added the ability to send out messages to clients updating them with the location of their local peers, via startup scripts. It will be these startup scripts that will be disabled, the source said, largely isolating individual users. 
""That will shut down perhaps 80 percent of the network,"" the source said. 
With versions 5.5.10, released in June, Lime Wire added automatic updates, with a key stipulation; if an update is available and the user chooses to ignore it, the LimeWire client cannot be opened, the source said. 
The hope for the settlement was that the RIAA would use LimeWire as the ""on ramp to the new [copyright-friendly] system,"" the source said. Instead, they'll have to acquire the users in a different way, the source said, perhaps by making the user experience of the main LimeWire client less user-friendly. "
,crn33,2010-10-26T23:58Z,"Limewire got killed today.  Court injunction ordering them to shut it down.  Here is the company blog:

You don't need to deal with the internet at all. It's fine. Just find a torrent file, and open it using LimeWire. It doesn't have to be fixed, the error."
