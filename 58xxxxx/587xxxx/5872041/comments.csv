,puppyup,2011-01-07T03:08Z,It doesn't make any sense to rip at 320 kbps. Because the difference is not audible anymore if a rip is properly done at 128 kbps. Anything else higher than 128 kpbs is not audible for human ears.

:) peace and thanks for the contents."

,deim0n,2012-02-03T18:03Z,"puppyup, You are seriously mistaken. An acc rip at 128 is comparable to an mp3 at 192. An mp3 rip at 128 sounds like complete shit. If you do a lossy rip to mp3 you might as well do a high VBR in the 250's or just do a constant at 320kpbs."
,christo7,2012-02-20T08:02Z,"What deim0n said, exactly. The difference between 128 and anything over 200 is very significant. After that, not so much. I avoid any mp3s that are not at least 192."
