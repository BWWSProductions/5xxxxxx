MOTORING: F1: Grand Prix Qualifying
On: BBC 1
Date: Saturday 9th October 2010
Time: 05:00 to 07:00

Japanese Grand Prix Qualifying.

Lee McKenzie presents live coverage of qualifying for the Japanese Grand Prix. With just four races remaining in the 2010 season, there is little room for error at the Suzuka circuit. In 2009, Jenson Button was among several drivers who were demoted down the grid after failing to slow for yellow flags. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel grabbed pole and went on to win the race, and will again be among the men to watch following some excellent performances in qualifying this year.


PLEASE NOTE: Due to extremely wet weather todays' Qualifying was cancelled and is expected to now be run at 10am (local time) tomorrow morning. If the BBC schedule an ad-hoc programme to cover the event it is likely to be broadcast from 2am (Japan is 8 hours ahead of the UK) and will be capped and available before the race begins.

And that means I'm in for yet another sleepless night 




Please remember...NO SPOILERS...!!!
