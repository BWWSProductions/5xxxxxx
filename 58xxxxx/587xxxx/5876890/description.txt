Another great dvd to share with you all. Meat Loaf's World Tour for Bat 2. 

Taped by a member in the audience. Meat rocked Oslo, Norway on April 10, 1994 with this great complete concert. Over 2 hrs we see Meat in great shape and form!

Because it's an audience taping both picture and sound quality aren't that great. But it's certainly good enough to let you experience the great show!
