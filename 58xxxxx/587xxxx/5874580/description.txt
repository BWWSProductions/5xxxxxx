IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Obitel.zla.4.Zhizn.posle.smerti.2010.D.DVD.ELEKTRI4KA ...............Thanks m8 ;-)
AUDIO:iNK...............Thanks m8 ;-)

For this we ripped the dvd9 with a script we made which also contained some lines for the sharpeness, chroma, brightness, contrast... main issues with source was too dark and the colours. Fixed what we could the best we could so... The audio was just muxed to our encode... all work was done by iNK ....Thanks :)
