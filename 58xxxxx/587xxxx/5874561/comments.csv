[V],Horrorspoke,2010-10-08T20:32Z,"Thanks for this mate... Is there any chance you can re-seed 'Ghostwatch' for me? There are no seeders or leechers on it at the moment?!?! 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5357791/Ghostwatch.1992.FS.UK.TV.H264%5BREQ%5D

Thanks if you can do, if you can't just let me know, no worries.

Horrorspoke."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-08T21:07Z,"@Horrorspoke: I would, without any problems - but - I had terrible crashes of old PC (June-August), which is in hell now - and many files was lost (deleted, erased, gone). Not by me, of course.  If anyone has that, he can load that torrent and seed. I know for a fact that few ""regulars"" here have it - so, keep torrent loaded for a while. Maybe somebody jump-in. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-08T22:06Z,... or I can send you MU links for avi.

[V],twentyforty,2010-10-09T08:32Z,"@htctouch: ALL encodes I have downloaded have high-pitch sound (""peeeeep"").
I filtered it out - band notch filter 0.3 octave at 5166 Hz. Applied Noise reduction after. That's all.I NEVER would provide samples for things that aren't questionable. 
It's matter of trust.
So - critics should wait or download someplace else."
,htctouch,2010-10-09T10:01Z,"man i totaly trust u . i was n im a huge fan of u b4 u got d green skul
but it isnt mater of trust its about choice/preference,i have my own sesibility about audio.. though beggers hv no choice, i just took a chance of asking for sample .. for that m sory"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-09T11:27Z,"@htctouch: I know all that. Sample cannot be added in finished torrent, it's simply not possible - what is ""in"" is what one gets.
My sound ALWAYS was BETTER than in any encoding of loosely similar size and same time period of creation - you cannot compare early CAM with BluRay which is released six month later, right?

You have nasty tendency - contrary to fact that we know each-other for a long time and you have downloaded probably hundredths of my encodings ( and dozens of your requests ) - to criticize my work.

It doesn't bother me at all when it comes from some idiot or passer-by - but it realy hurts when:

1. You have criticized sound for no reason:
a) simply because no better can be found
b) it is NOT something YOU NEED or EXPECT
c) you cannot comprehend that I have explained to you that whole sound encoding haven't been changed from 2007. Why? Sound is the best part of my encodings. Smart people never change something proven good.
d) I cannot make flowers from the shit

When I see that you are capable to understand what I just said, maybe you would understand. But, I doubt that."
