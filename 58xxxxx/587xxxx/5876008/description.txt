           Trevor Grainger, Amber Croft and Rob Rankus are three,         
           like, average dudes who run Go Time Liquidators - an eBay      
           auction business. Trevor likes Stephen King, Amber wants       
           to be a singer-songwriter, and Rob's into the Chili            
           Peppers. Amber used to date Trevor but now she's going to      
           marry Rob. They read the obituaries in order to find           
           things they can turn into money on the internet. Pretty        
           soon they end up in the destroyed house of a dead dude         
           named Bill Zill, and they're also seriously obsessing          
           over watching a surveillance-cam website called                
           fourboxes.tv. Fourboxes.tv is a dusty, digital window          
           into the wacked-out world of a creep they call Havoc.          
           Havoc didn't know his apartment was wired up when he           
           moved in. And he's weird. He sleeps in a bat-cage, builds      
           bombs in a dungeon, and looks like he's planning to kill       
           people on a seriously massive scale. Trevor, Amber and         
           Rob decide they have to do something to find and stop          
           Havoc, wherever he is. Or...maybe not - they could just        
           keep watching, 'cause, as Rob says, "That's what the           
           internet's for." Havoc's dirty, wrecked world couldn't         
           affect them - right? Safe, alone, deep in the dark,            
           clean, American suburbs.
