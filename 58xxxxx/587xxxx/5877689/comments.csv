  Looks like it works and Nod32 reports it to be clean. 
 there is no instal apparently - you just download it and use it.

,cochino,2010-12-13T00:40Z,"There is always an idiot, who expects the  world to be proud of his ignorance. 

In this day and age, the US is not the center of the universe. No more ugly Americans expecting the  world to take their dollar and to  speak in English to the big white man.  

Listenherenow better start learning Chinese and Japanese and Spanish. 

Furthermore, one can cut and paste the unknown string into translate.google.com and stop whining! "
,eddiexx,2010-12-16T23:18Z,yes this is a portable (!) Nero 10. Just like it says. One thing I wonder though is if the actual burning part (audio-cd) of Nero is getting updated or if the latest updates are new features not relevant to the quality of a burned audio-cd.
