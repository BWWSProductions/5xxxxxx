The Blue Stuff was born in Naples in 1982, thanks to the initiative of Mario "Blue Train" Insenga, former coordinator of a previous musical project that gave life to the Blue Box. From the beginning the band is characterized as a blues band faithfully devoted to the Chicago Style. For the first year the activity is almost exclusively live, with concerts throughout Italy. The debut release was Chicago Bound in 1990, followed by a live album.
