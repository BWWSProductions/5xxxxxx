,FyiMfer,2012-03-31T10:23Z,"Thank you so much for sharing this.  I hate modern ""professional"" wrestling but this was the golden age for me.  Unfortunately, I didn't have cable TV until I was 10 and even then only got to see half the episodes because of ol' bedtime.  Always wished I could have seen the whole DX, Austin vs what would turn out to be eventually everyone, and oh so much more.  Many thanks!  Will GLADLY seed... fuck you McMahon..."
