,.HarleQuin.,2010-10-14T17:28Z,Whats that song playing when Roger is high? Sounds like Jamiroquai or Scissor Sisters. Thanks.
,willkurs,2010-10-21T16:14Z,"Hey HarleQuin,

The song when Roger is high is 'Electric Feel' by MGMT.  

The BMX race song is 'Thunder in your heart' by John Farnham."

I thought American Dad was still a weekly series.
Disapointed I havnt seen any more listed.
Thanks though for putting up the 1st 2 of the season"
