,fatofthelanders,2010-10-11T18:51Z,"Thank you for the great torrent dude! Above 1200kB/s for whole download!
Will Seed :)"
,Syejack,2010-10-11T19:07Z,"I can't believe this on TPB already.  It came out in the UK today!  Thanks a lot, I'll seed and buy the real thing at the weekend."
,alterbridge07,2010-10-14T19:12Z,why is it that the end of every track cuts off?
,upbroker,2010-10-15T10:08Z,"@pirejtbej :

No point converting this mp3 copy to FLAC. 
Give it some time, and it will be uploaded on tpb as soon as the CD is released.

@alterbridge07:

I didn't experience any such problems. Try
listening to this in WMP.

Thnx 4 all the comments. 
I will upload the bonus tracks when they are out."

The track length shown in brackets is as given in wikipedia.
None of these tracks are cut short by much and the ending can be heard in each and every track.

@Vipr3
Dude, you would seriously do better to just ask me about it before you criticise my upload. 
At least I took the time to upload it here. 
It is people like you that make TPB a bad place to upload."
,tailhooker,2010-11-01T14:27Z,"Thanks for the album, upbroker. I was a bit confused when I first looked at the tracks in iTunes. All show length of 4:22, but as I listened to the last 10 seconds of each, there's no early cutoff. Literally the track keeps playing after the elapsed time pauses at 4:22 for the longer songs. Strange..."
,alainfigue,2010-11-05T06:14Z,"track 12. Coeur D'Alene does has the end cut off, at least for me, anyone has the same problem?"
,upbroker,2010-11-09T08:29Z,"I have uploaded the US bonus tracks (Zero and Home):

,upbroker,2010-11-10T05:56Z,"Sorry....
I had to delete the aforementioned torrent since it was of bad quality. Here's the Bonus tracks in a much better quality:-

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5946005"
,dolcichw,2010-11-12T09:44Z,yes all tracks say 4:22 if played in something like itunes but if you play the tracks you will notice if it should be shorter it skips to 0 sec left when the song ends and if it should be longer it plays past 0... havent tried burning to make sure it plays right
,upbroker,2010-11-12T13:56Z,"For those who are having problems with the track lengths in iTunes, follow this link:-
http://ask.metafilter.com/35432/How-to-manually-tell-iTunes-how-long-a-track-is

Such problems have been known to occur in Foobar, iTunes and some other players. I dont know the exact reason for this.
Hope this helps..........."
,dolcichw,2010-11-12T19:35Z,i already tried that it doesnt work... it just reverts back to the same length... they play fine in itunes even with the incorrect track lengths but they wont burn right
,upbroker,2010-11-13T08:00Z,"See if the instructions in this link works:-

I am really sorry if I couldn't be of much help to you. As you may have already guessed I prefer WMP for all my audio files.
Also, I request you to let others know of the solution if you have solved this problem."

,Rickslick,2010-12-01T17:16Z,Thanx =)
,Rickslick,2010-12-03T19:49Z,"Hey, whats this? Each song is cut off after 4.22 min. "
,PRSteve,2010-12-23T20:54Z,"Dude, first of all thanks for the upload! My problem is pretty much like everyone else's: my iTunes stops each and every song at 4:22... I've tried everything that you advised, but the problem doesn't have to do with the song in general (when I check the properties of each song it shows the right duration) but with iTunes... Do you have any idea how to fix that? I want the correct record on my iPod as soon as possible, so any answer is welcome!"
,The_Iron_E,2010-12-26T19:41Z,"I know how to fix the 4:22 issue... don't friggin use iTunes. Use Winamp, that displays the proper track lengths, at least it does for me."
,5TAR5,2011-01-14T06:30Z,"Thanks for the upload! Stupid itunes problem with the listed time, but the songs didn't cut off for me."
,BluceRee,2011-02-15T22:55Z,"Great torrent!! Thanks!! Sounds great, works perfectly (even on itunes!)"
,PwnzrJay,2011-03-04T18:41Z,"The iTunes problem is really annoying, maybe you can re-upload? If it's not too much trouble..."
,micnor14,2011-03-10T02:39Z,"WARNING: CORRUPT (CUSTOM) MP3 ID3V2 TAGS ON ALL FILES CAUSES DATABASE ERRORS IN ITUNES/ROCKBOX DEVICES. 

For users of Rockbox, adding these mp3s via iTunes will crash your DB. Using this tool: 

http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=67076

you need to delete the corrupt id3v2 tags. Filenames will stay, and using explorer's simple file management with the context menu you can add Alter Bridge as the artist to all the files again. Simple. Seems like the uploader got lazy and just bulk modified them. High quality though! "
