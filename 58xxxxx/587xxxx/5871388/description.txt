From Tantor:

Perhaps the best-loved nineteenth-century American novel, Mark Twain's 
tale of boyhood adventure overflows with comedy, warmth, and slapstick 
energy. It brings to life an array of irresistible characters - the 
awesomely self-confident Tom, his best buddy Huck Finn, indulgent Aunt 
Polly, and the lovely, beguiling Becky - as well as such unforgettable 
incidents as whitewashing a fence, swearing an oath in blood, and 
getting lost in a dark and labyrinthine cave. Below Tom Sawyer's 
sunny surface lurk hints of a darker reality, of youthful innocence and 
naÃ¯vetÃ© confronting the cruelty, hypocrisy, and foolishness of the adult 
world - a theme that would become more pronounced in Twain's Adventures 
of Huckleberry Finn. Despite such suggestions, Tom Sawyer remains 
Twainâ€™s joyful ode to the endless possibilities of childhood. 

From Wiki:

The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain is a popular 1876 novel about
a young boy growing up in a small town along the Mississippi River. The 
story is set in the town of "St Petersburg", inspired by Hannibal, 
Missouri, where Mark Twain grew up. In the story's introduction, Twain 
notes:
  "Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two 
were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates 
of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an 
individualâ€”he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom 
I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture."
