,3_3_3,2010-10-12T10:57Z,"Good quality, the title and some of the text throughout the film is in russian as is often the case with R5s. Not a problem especially if your kids can't read.

,TheEmpathicEar,2010-10-13T01:30Z,"Are there any decent English subs for this? I've been trying various English subs from http://www.opensubtitles.org, but have not found any that are synced very well with this release."

,IzZtar,2010-10-17T16:42Z,Ska filmen sakna hälften av allt snack eller är det något fel på denna skit R5:a? för jag ser att karaktärerna rör på munnen rätt mycket i filmen men jag hör då inget ljud..

Thank you very much! Please keep the good work"
,gratefulforthis,2010-11-17T12:20Z,"Decent quality.

A=8
V=8
M=9

But it's worth noting that all the plot important text (on boxes and signs etc) has been done in Russian for Russian audiences. Spoils it a little."
,darkscale,2010-11-25T09:30Z,"Okay, so I don't understand why people are worried about having English subs when the movie is in English anyway? Also,  I'm quite happy to help out noobs. We were all noobs at one point (at least new to something). Being in the IT/IS world for 20+ years does have its advantages so some of us can figure things out for ourselves. Not everyone has that sort of experience or know-how though. People like Zone55 need to get a grip."
,sandman75,2010-11-29T03:02Z,anyone else notice about 20 minutes missing between the daycare scenes and the scenes at the dump? Jumped straight from the bit with the monkey all the way to the shredder missing out everything inbetwwen
