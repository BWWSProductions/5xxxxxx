Rage Against The Machine - Guerrilla Radio [promo].VOB



HQ completely uncensored promo music video. The promo was shot by production 
company Squeak Pictures in Los Angeles in October 1999 and directed by Honey, 
i.e., the husband-and-wife directorial team of Laura Kelly and Nicholas Brooks. 
The video which, among others, touches upon the exploitation of garment workers, 
parodies the popular late 90's Gap commercials directed by Pedro Romhanyi. These 
ads featured attractive young people singing songs while against a white backdrop, 
wearing Gap clothing. The phrase "everybody in denial" (the 'denial' being Gap 
brand leather, vests, etc) then flashes loudly across the screen.
(video does not have any logos)
