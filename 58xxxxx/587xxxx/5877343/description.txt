Victor Victoria is a most favorite of my movies personally in that I find
it does wonders for the spirit to have Julie Andrews and Robert Preston 
repartee as they do in situations that certainly do serve as inspiration
to loftier attempts to articulate with clever wit, and with intelligence
that is as I say, in great sprit, I say!

The scene at Chez louis is unforgettable and a "tour de force"
around the Hollywood sets when you consider their more recent exploits
at the box office, by comparison. What great songs too!

We will soon have an HD DivX widescreen 2GB version for all to share, however it
will be produced from the (five minutes longer) NTSC rendition - for which
we lack Swedish subtitles 

We ask for your seeding support Danke! Michael Rizzo Chessman
