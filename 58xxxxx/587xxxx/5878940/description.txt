Michael Abrash's classic Graphics Programming Black Book is a compilation of Michael's previous writings on assembly language and graphics programming (including from his "Graphics Programming" column in Dr. Dobb's Journal). Much of the focus of this book is on profiling and code testing, as well as performance optimization. It also explores much of the technology behind the Doom and Quake 3-D games, and 3-D graphics problems such as texture mapping, hidden surface removal, and the like.

This book can be freely downloaded from here: http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1698.asp

But that version is split into many parts, and has some annoying broken links at the top of many of the pages.

This version has been joined into a single pdf, and all the annoying broken links have been removed.
