So, if you neglect 2ch, then u can increase quality of overall rip (may be by 5-10%). I like your rips, but try to stick with file size (range of 700 like ~1.4G ~2.2G). Its just a suggestion, but request is ""How To Train Your Dragon"". :) "
,lillem4n,2010-10-08T12:54Z,This is quite low quality tbh. Id rather see a DVDimage on my HDTV than this.
