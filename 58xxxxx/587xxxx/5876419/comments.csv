[V],nightissuchproximity,2010-10-22T15:08Z,i ran this for 8 months and i can assure you it does not crash your computer
[V],nightissuchproximity,2010-10-22T16:11Z,"Now scanned with 6 seperate a/v software applications...
...all come back and tell me this is clean"

My Outpost Firewall became black listed and converted back to trial, so I tried this Firewall and had the same issues with it crashing my machine.  I scanned it also and it shows 100% clean, but I still had problems until I uninstalled it.  Just letting you know, BTW I searched for you on SuprBay to advise you there first but did not see your user name.  Thanks for all your uploads m8!"

I also tried the Ashampoo Home Site version and got the same results, so it's the program, not your file.  I run their HDD Control also, so perhaps it's a conflict on my end."
