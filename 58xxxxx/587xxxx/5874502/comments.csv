[V],MAFIAA.,2010-10-08T20:59Z,"Guys stop bitching about who stole from where no need for that.... and no mood either. better is to ignore and focus on your own torrents.

Trust me the one who mostly complains loses the game...

Now be nice and keep up uploading/sharing ;)"

[H],HeroMaster,2010-10-10T20:35Z,"@GenT17 after downloading the file use winrar to extract the files, then copy the data in the dvd of 8.5gb, put it in the 360 and play."
,GenT17,2010-10-11T03:22Z,@Hero_No_1  really thats all i have to do. sweet thanks
,GenT17,2010-10-11T03:29Z,@Hero_No_1 cause someone on this other site said i had to crack my xbox or something
,killamike420,2010-10-11T07:39Z,can more people seed plz i alwats let mine seed for 3 or 4 days when its done downloading thx
,GenT17,2010-10-12T04:02Z,Do i have to flash it or mod it or will it work without doing that
,tripper511,2010-10-13T23:18Z,"CLe4n3r:  Stop bitching, There's PAL and NTSC versions up. One of those will work for you, you don't need region free.  If that's still not good enough then go join xbox360iso.com or another private torrent site and find it OR rent the game and rip and copy it for yourself.

GenT17:That's one hell of a question. Something a website titled GOOGLE will help you with. Real quick, you need to have a modded xbox and a dual layer (preferably verbatum brand) DVD disk and a disk drive capable of burning the game on DL disks. This link: http://www.xbox360iso.com/showthread.php?t=286239  will get you in touch with a guy who mods xbox's. You can also check out craigslist for a more local modder. Learn about the risks before you decide to do anything. "
,tripper511,2010-10-13T23:21Z,but yes GenT17 you need to have a MODDED/FLASHED xbox to play ANY burned game AND you need the ability to burn the game to the proper disk.  I wish it was as easy as just downloading and playing but if it was EVERYONE would be pirating games.  
,Rafael_1123,2010-10-14T05:57Z,"Well, I dl it and guess what?......when it gets to %50 it says write error....and im using Verbatims and everything.....plz check the files man...."
,percret,2010-10-16T21:40Z,does it works? i have a usa console
,lestatvvvvvv,2010-10-25T02:47Z,"with something like ths , is it safe to play online or will my box get banned?"
,greenmint,2010-10-25T05:09Z,Somebody please tell me (by scanning with abgx) that whether it is NTSC-U(american version) or NTSC-J(Asian version) or both?
,dan2183,2010-11-28T11:30Z,is this NTSC/J?
,vice_bobi,2010-12-01T02:29Z,"I have burned 2 dvd verbatim just like i did with other 100 games witch were OK,but this game always says ""unpleable disk"".
Is this happening to some other peoples ?"
,IceIceTommaY,2011-02-21T22:00Z,"I'm getting the ""disc is unreadable"" error. The game starts right up and shows the EA logo and animations and all that until it gets to the title screen. Then the dashboard comes up with that error."
,WaxMaNuts384,2011-08-23T02:56Z,"Game works. I got a green screen and black screen at start up of game but went back to normal after 10 seconds. 
Will seed until I need more space for games."
,Lelele5,2012-03-16T13:19Z,"Please people, seed. I'm trying to seed every torrent I've downloaded, please do the same.

BTW, thanks for the upload friend. Cheers"
,Lelele5,2012-03-18T04:26Z,"It's rather ironic since I've requested more seeds the seeders've quited seeding. Now I'm stuck at 94.7%. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PEOPLE, PLEASE SEED!!!"
,Lelele5,2012-03-18T20:13Z,"Hate triple-posting, but I want to thank you for instant increasement at seeding status. Great game, hope you enjoy all."
