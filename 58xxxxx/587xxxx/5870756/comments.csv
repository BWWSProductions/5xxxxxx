,LDGXXX,2010-11-24T02:13Z,I remember a prev ver of this required that you block a number of IP's in your firewall to prevent it from contacting it's home base and becoming unreged.  is that still required?
,ineedtonutt,2010-12-18T16:06Z,"I patched this and now it says ""Common Language Runtime detected an invalid program."" ""All Jaksta Standard Version functionality is enabled."" but it's not. I had the SAME problem with RMC. I patched and it said it worked but it didnt and screwed up the install. I can't repair nor remove it from my system now. Team Crude is full of shit. I followed their instructions and patched first. "
