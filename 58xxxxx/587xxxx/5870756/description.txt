Downloading has never been faster and simpler! Once monitoring Jaksta will detect and begin to download (and convert if required) any video, music, radio stream or Flash game or presentation that is played in your browser.

Where Jaksta detects secured streams it will record the stream as it plays in your browser. This ensures you comply with any copy protection mechanisms a site has employed.

Instructions:
1. Install the software using the included installers or downloading the most recent one from Jaksta.com. Make sure you use the x64 version if you have a x64-bits operating system.
2. Run the Keygen.exe but apply patch first, then use the the provided key or generate a new one.
    NOTE: Vista/Win7 based operating system owners must run the keygen with admin rights or else the patch will fail.
3. Execute the program an enjoy your registered version!

All credits go to Team C.R.U.D.E for creating the keygen/patch.

Addendum: I have tested the key with Nod32 and its completely clean, no viruses. This is also my first torrent, I hope you find its useful.
