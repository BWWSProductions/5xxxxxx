Kagero Deception 2

for psx 

This game is a 3d third-person anime style action/strategy game.  If you liked Home Alone as a kid then you will love this game. You earn and deploy traps and trigger them on your foes.  It's more fun than it sounds.  Some of the palace levels are capture-the-flag style where you have to kill your enemy before he sets off a bomb in the statue. In the beginning, name your character Astarte for a 2000 point bonus.  Kill every character in the game to get the first ending which is really hard.  Playing on an emulator allows you to save whenever you want, so you can get the no-damage bonus every level if you want.
