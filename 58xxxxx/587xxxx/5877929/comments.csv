,Bounty_Hunter,2010-10-12T17:34Z,"@ikitty
i found a solution: make a new profile and make it a local profile. (directly after you click create new profile scroll down and you should be able to see it, unless you're blind)"
,chintu_1717,2010-11-11T13:18Z,Kaspersky Internet Security detects the Launcher file as a virus and deletes it immediately. Help plz.
,kenmainord,2010-11-20T03:39Z,@Bounty_Hunter - Could you describe how you created a local profile?  I don't see where that is possible.
,Apache950,2010-12-31T23:43Z,"windows live is not the problem you must only scroll down if asked for a windows live or xbox acc and klick use Local Profile ( offline) your game will be saved without problems. to play online is a little bit difficult you must search for special cracked server.....

I have a Problem i downloaded Lost Planet ( 12 GB and Skidrow) and downloaded this crack here. every time i start lost Planet 2 it says Lost Planet 2 stopped working. i have installed directx 9 and 11 and used bothe but my problem is still there. what can i doo?"
,crimsoncore,2012-02-04T04:53Z,can anyone upload a video showing that you can play offline? i was using my windows account to play offline... but later on... i cant play using my profile... cant play offline... so I i cant save my game!
