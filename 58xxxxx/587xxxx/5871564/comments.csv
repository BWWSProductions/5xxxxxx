[V],twentyforty,2010-10-08T07:56Z,"Thanks guys.
@kunalk222: Has been said last week: Not out yet. When I see it, then I'd encode it...

DJkid90: Yes."
,sachet,2010-10-08T09:33Z,@DJkid90: here is a rip of trick r treat http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5871170/Trick__r_Treat_[2009]_720p_x264_[TYNYFYD]_

,sachet,2010-10-08T13:39Z,"@20-40:i didnt mean to offend u(i kno u r d BEST uploader of all d torents )
my vote is always for 20-40
i was just provididng him an option(who is not bad) which he may or may not take ....:p"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-08T13:48Z,"@DJkid90: Look... I am not particularly crazy 'bout requests nor in desperate need to draw attention of downloaders (as others might be). That movie would be downloaded maybe by few dozen people, right? After two days would be without substantial seeding...

But - I hate when someone take a dump in my living room - AFTER I spent MY MONEY and MY TIME for downloading, encoding and uploading.
You see?

In fact, more than other uploaders I point the people in direction of existing torrents. And I unfortunately, missed that one. Posting the link AFTER the positive answer was stupid and probably malicious. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-08T13:51Z,"@sachet: OK then. But don't do it again, please.
It is, however, a nice gesture if request has been answered negative or answer haven't been given at all."
,DJkid90,2010-10-08T14:36Z,"Hmmm... I think you are right.

See ya..."
,DJkid90,2010-10-08T14:42Z,"@ 20-40
