           Simon, 35, has returned to live temporarily with his           
           father. They make life unbearable for each other. To add       
           spice to this situation, Uncle Maurice and Aunt Mala,          
           Ernest's brother and sister, meddle in everything and,         
           notably, try to find a "nice little Jewish girl" for           
           Simon to marry. When Ernest passes away, Simon fulfils         
           his father's last request: bury him in the village where       
           he was born, in the depths of Ukraine. And so Simon finds      
           himself caught up in an event-packed road movie in the         
           company of his paranoid old uncle, his aunt who nags him       
           endlessly about his "Goy dancer", his six-years-old son,       
           his father's body and his ghost, and also a rabbit. Not        
           to mention his ex who hassles him by phone. The journey        
           will be nothing like a cruise down the Nile!
