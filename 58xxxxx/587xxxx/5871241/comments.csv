[V],meech,2010-11-02T14:11Z,"To view some of my other torrents, goto my piratebay page http://thepiratebay.org/user/meech

Some of my other sci-fi torrents include high quality complete series of: Star Trek Next Generation, Star Trek DS-9, Stargate SG-1, and Space Above and Beyond.

Star Trek Voyager is currently being ripped.  The first season should be up soon."
,fhive,2010-11-24T09:35Z,"This torrent and the season 2 torrent have several episodes out of order - their names are correct (as far as I can tell), but this is mostly apparent in season 2, where the out of order episode makes no sense.  The original series order can be found on the episode guide wiki. 

I would also like to thank you for a work and that I am just pointing this out as a note.  The video and audio quality is superb as per your usual - thanks a bunch and fantastic job.  "
[V],meech,2010-11-25T19:46Z,"As far as the order goes.  I apologize about getting anything out of order.  The torrent follows exactly the episode order that Netflix has them in...which I assumed would be correct.

Upon doing a little research, it seems that the air dates (at least the U.S. air dates) were broadcast in a different order than the order of production.  This may be the discrepancy you are noticing.  Netflix, in their infinite wisdom mixed the two different progressions together for different seasons...and even gets this wrong a couple times.

For example, This season 1 in this torrent (and thus Netflix) does indeed follow the production order exactly.  However the air dates were different.  So if you want to follow the production date, watch season 1 as listed in the torrent.  If you wish to watch it by air date, you'll have to watch the torrent out of order.

However, Season 2 of the torrent (and Netflix) follows the actually AIR DATE that they were shown on television, not the production date...EXCEPT, the last episode ""Die Me Dichotomy"" was produced AND aired last, AFTER the 3-part ""Liars and Guns"" episodes.  Netflix (and this torrent) have ""Die Me Dichotomy"" before the 3-parter. So Netflix has this totally wrong.

Season 3 was aired in the same order of the production order...and Netflix has the same.  So whether you choose/wish to watch by the air date or the production date, Season 3 is the same for both.

Season 4 is the same as Season 3...all three: the air date, production date, and netflix order all follow the same order.

You may have a preference to choose to watch by air date, as the original viewers experienced it, or by production date as it was produced.  Whatever you choose, your best bet is to go to the following website: http://www.farscapeworld.com/episodes/

With this website, you can view the different orders...production and air date orders.  This is only an issue for seasons 1 and 2."

[T],DraGonflY_27z,2011-01-13T20:49Z,"Oh great, you even made torrents for Farscape! Your releases are amazing! They're of great quality!
I downloaded your Stargate SG-1 torrents several months ago and I seeded them to a ratio of at least 6.0 because I thought they deserved it. And now I'm gonna try to seed Farscape as soon as I can.

I see you also made Star Trek torrents, I've wanted to discover these series for several weeks now and I'll download your torrents when I do!

How about doing Stargate Atlantis one day? It's a great series too."
,ONeg,2011-02-20T08:24Z,"Even though you raped my hard drive space, you're the man. The quality is amazing. So much better than the other rips and worth the space for such a great show.

It really stands up to the test of time."
,soldierofthelam,2011-02-20T14:33Z,Could always try compress down the files for easier download time. 7gb 7zip can be compressed down to 4.5 so making to compressed files would be a faster download for the user.
,katamari94,2011-03-23T02:30Z,"meech is THE best pirate 
if you like scifi get his stuff its very good I have NEVER had a problem with his vids (safe for size xd)"
,brizobear,2011-03-23T11:37Z,I've been downloading this for days now cant wait till its finished... why is it taking so long!
,GadsdenNation,2011-08-16T09:11Z,Thanks for uploading meech. I completely forgot about this series until just recently. This along with Firefly were two of my favorite shows back when I owned a TV.
,Grand-Grimoire,2011-09-25T07:24Z,awsome i love this show...thanks...will seed
,Andy_Mac1976,2011-10-02T20:25Z,Thanks for these Meech! Superb series. Seeding to ratio 6.0
,acidnave,2011-10-18T22:23Z,i have no sound... if i turn up the volume to the max i hear some background music and unknown sounds.. any clue whats going on?
,DarkerSkies,2011-11-13T03:46Z,Very Very Very Very!!!!!!! badly seeded 6.5 kbps why is it that you always find people trying to seed large files when they have no ability to do so. Nice upload (but fucking pointless) as no one has the balls to seed it. 
,pyro12345,2011-11-20T19:07Z,"never got the chance to watch on t.v., just finished watching season 1, and starting on season 2 download next...very large file size but very worth it!...will seed whole series at least twice after finished downloading and watching.
much thx meech!"
,xdrone,2012-01-09T23:50Z,"Hi and perfect quality. Though download speed is dropping significantly, I can't download at a constant rate, less than 10kps. Any ideas? Tried everything, but my ISP is not limiting me, but browsing at night is a bitch. I still have 40% remaining for season 1. For 2, 3 and 4 many pieces but can't finish open pieces and always opening new ones but not finishing them. I have 1Mbps and am downloading at 20 or 30KBps. Sometimes I am getting 100KBps but very very rarely."
,Thejohndoemofo,2012-03-06T20:32Z,"A - 10
V - 10

Thank you for all the excellent uploads!

Please consider doing Stargate Atlantis and Star Wars The Clone Wars in the near future.

I've noticed people aren't logging in to give you + for quality, that's not right. Come on everyone, let's give him the credit he deserves.

I'll be downloading half of these titles, even if it takes me a year. I have my maximum upload rate set at 0 so I can give back as I take."
,CarmenCat,2012-05-19T13:19Z,Thanks Meech! Amazing quality! Took ages to download but so so worth it!!!
