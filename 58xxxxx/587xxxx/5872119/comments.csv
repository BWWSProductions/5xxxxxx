,wrtenlegacy,2010-10-08T08:30Z,"About to download this game. Thanks for getting it up so quickly. I'll let you know how it runs on my R4. Also thanks for the cracked of Etrian Odyssey III, I'm going to test it out. 

Once it comes out I was wondering if you could do Lufia: Curse of the Sinistrals"

,Tsuris,2010-10-08T11:14Z,I was wondering if you had just the AR patch for this game (courtesy of venom or anyone).
[T],simmyboy80,2010-10-08T17:32Z,"@wrtenlegacy

@Tsuris

theres no need for patch just download this rom and extract it yourself if you really need it

And everyone else thanks for your comments and your welcome"
