,cyber15,2010-10-18T04:40Z,"Don't think episode 6 aired last Thursday, live in Sweden so not sure what's up on  American television. But since CWTV episode preview is still the same as it was last week, I guess they didn't show it. I know, it ""sucks"" :("
,marco699,2010-10-19T19:27Z,Episode 6 titled âPlan Bâ which will air Thursday October 21 at 8pm U.S.A :) :)
