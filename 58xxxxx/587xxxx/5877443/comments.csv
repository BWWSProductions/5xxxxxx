,moshster,2010-10-10T12:18Z,8Gb!  *sigh*  At half the bit rate the video quality would be indiscernible from 7011kbps to the  human eye at regular viewing distance.  This could easily be 4Gb with AC3 or 6Gb with DTS.
,autobotHD,2010-10-10T13:10Z,"  Geez How about saying thanks to the uplaoder for providing us for free this great quality rip you ingrate.
"
,zmajcekBo,2010-10-10T14:17Z,"Thank you, uploader. Though the size is really somewhat of a fetish to me. How come some 720p rips are roughly 2 GiB in size, but completely enjoyable??"
,hardlime,2010-10-10T14:32Z,"I agree auobotHD, some people are just ungrateful for all the time and effort that's put into these great qulity rips that we get for free.

Thanks for the upload BOZX."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-10-10T17:45Z,"Lol, 
7011kbps for   1280 x 544 is quite an amateur superficial job, waste of size and time plus some weaker pc-s will play it harder..

3000 kbps should be more then enough for 1280 x 544 and size shouldn't be more then 4 GB.
Not the kbps but other encoding setting makes a rip great.
1280 x 544 needs about 30% less kbps then 1280 x 720.  Think about it!
It's pathetic how some uploaders like to put their name in other people's hard work's title  ;-)))"
,pizzahut123,2010-10-10T18:48Z,"@moshster 
u seriously need to stop acting like a bitch and take your whining elsewhere! stupid retard!

thx uploader for a great job !!!!!!!!"
,Harutik_11,2010-10-11T06:46Z,"Wow, you guys are really into opinion bashing. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, and nobody is entitled to be greatful for anything, just get over it and let him say what he wants.

On another note, thx for this rip, quality is superb."
,hplp20,2010-10-11T17:27Z,16:9 and 1280 x 544? Which one is it?
,tolomey,2010-10-11T23:04Z,"For some reason I cannot convert this to watch on a PS3 - I've tried using MKV2VOB and also tsMUXER but no joy.  Has anyone else managed to convert this?  If so, how?"
,tiagobr,2010-10-12T04:49Z,hello? thank you!

,pettran,2010-10-15T00:03Z,"Stop crying about the size, if you cant store it, buy it!"
,reine12,2010-10-22T08:20Z,"I must agree, wy don't you go buy yourself more discspace instead? It's more or less for free these days! 

I'm watching all my movies on a 100' screen and a full HD projector som I love these large files ;-).

Keep em comin'

Cheers :-)"
,reine12,2010-10-22T08:21Z,1080p is offcourse the ultimate deal...but i'm not complaining. 
,reine12,2010-10-24T15:01Z,Anyone else having trouble with the audio on this one?

Solution - Use Java PS3 Media Server."
,TaZeRz,2010-10-30T22:06Z,"Whats up with all the rips at 1280 x 544
or around claiming to be 720p why do you faggots rip this way with big ass black bars??"
,freyja80,2010-11-04T08:40Z,thanks
,kompensan,2010-11-12T02:16Z,"Guys, let me explain something.
Most movies aren't recorded in the aspect ratio of 16:9.
The most common aspect ratio on cinema is 1.85:1 and 2.39:1. This just means that if the video had incorporated letterbox (the black bars) it would, infact, be 720p. 
When you see HD movies in your television, it means most of them were cropped on its sides, and probably used a common technic called Pan&Scan. "
,k-rob,2010-12-17T23:00Z,"how's the audio on this one? i've tried downloading the smaller filesize 720p extended rips, and 2 of them had the audio way off (in MPC). "
,Dogger55,2011-02-15T00:14Z,"An Action movie generally requires a larger file size to handle the extra motion and more frequent scene changes. If you want stiff acting and less motion, watch the original TV series, but stop your bitching. And if space is a problem, you can always watch the original download and then  shrink it with Handbrake for storage."
