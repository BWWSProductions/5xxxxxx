Meanwhile on earth, the Russians announce they won't prolong the treaty to lend the Stargate to the US, but start their own program, but general Landry guesses right that's only to press another demand... Vala continues the village's apparently dictatorial leader is actually the head of the resistance, which plans to sabotage the whole Ori-war effort, but overhears a prior tell Tomin he's infertile...

Original Air Dateâ€”10 March 2006
Since the weapon Merlin once devised against ascended beings seems the human race's best change to resist or even defeat the Ori, SG-1 travels by stargate to a medieval society in a place called Camelot where the local Arthur epic (differerent from earth's romanticized traditions) confirms its location should be found in a forbidden library guarded by a Black knight. When they are beamed up to earth's super-star-ships about to try stopping the Ori-fleet passing a super-gate, Daniel and colonel Mitchell decide to have themselves beamed back inside the library, but on neither front things go as expected...
