Tracklisting:

Prepare to take a trip down memory lane with Robbie as the journey begins in present day with two new songs, Robbie's beautiful duet with Gary Barlow, Shame, which is also released as a single on 4th October 2010, and the feel-good track Heart And I, another fantastic Williams/Barlow co-written song.

The album then takes us backwards through the decades, featuring all the colossal songs from Robbie's eight solo studio albums over the years: Reality Killed The Video Star, Rudebox, Intensive Care, Escapology, Swing When You're Winning, Sing When You're Winning, I've Been Expecting You and Life Thru A Lens. The album is rounded off with a sprinkling of Take That gold dust, featuring Everything Changes, the boyband's fourth consecutive single to go straight in at number one in the UK way back in 1994. Doesn't time fly?!
