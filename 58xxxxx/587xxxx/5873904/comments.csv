,DWinchester,2010-10-08T12:15Z,What is the real reason for pirate bay showing zero seeds on all the torrents ?
,abj642,2010-10-08T12:29Z,thanks
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-08T12:51Z,"@DWinchester: TPB get that data from the tracker (separate server) and that is openbitorrent dot com (process of getting data from tracker is called ""scratching""). In past few weeks this tracker is down most of the time. Leaving aside technical problems, HollyBolly try everything possible to shut down all  tracker servers thinking that it would stop or cripple P2P sharing. Well... crippling is what you've experienced, but DHT was invented to overcome that need. For DHT instead of  public tracker servers (lately 99% is down more than up) one should use uTorrent/BitTorrent or similar torrent programs with modern and good DHT abilities and open one dedicated UDP port in the router/modem."

,shoxell,2010-10-08T17:17Z,"20-40, the size-quality ratio of your videos are simply outstanding. What program and settings do you use?"

[why was my comment deleted? this is a legitimate question!]"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-08T18:00Z,"@AnshSach: I did - first episode and gave to evaluation. Response confirmed my thoughts: ""Not funny."" Sort of ""already seen"" show - and I dropped it out. 

@shoxell: LOL, it's just one of many TPB glitches - comments appear with delay... first one haven't been deleted.

Regarding the question: same one (absolutely same) from 2007. onwards. For more, click on my handle and find my answer and response from Arjunnn on two today's torrents.."
,shoxell,2010-10-08T18:58Z,"@twentyforty
I checked the other torrents with arjunn's comments and your replies. you haven't really said which software you use, or what setting in that software. you mentioned that you used handbrake briefly."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-08T19:59Z,"@shoxell: Nope. You have not. Unless you don't understand English as good as you think:

""twentyforty at 2010-10-08 12:25 CET: 
@Arjunnn: I use software written, compiled or modified by - myself."""
,shoxell,2010-10-09T00:36Z,"@twentyforty

Ooooooooo. That's where I missed it. I opened up some 6-8 of your torrents that you posted today in tabs and started reading the comments. In the back of my head I was looking for a software name.

Is there any chance you will be sharing the software with us. May be some of us can cover the shows/movies that you are not covering at the moment, with the same awesome size-quality ratio."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-09T10:08Z,"@shoxell: I gave my toolchain to two regulars here. Well, there haven't been sudden increase of production - let say it on half-kidding way. It's so simple that confuses people - as you have noticed, my daily production is too huge to tolerate unnecessary waste of time in encoding process - but, in order to be used - my toolchain prefers someone who is very very long in H264 encoding, ahem, ultimately familiar with command line, libx264 internals and targets limitations.

To cut long story short - I am convinced that my toolchain is no better than few other encoding programs. It's true. Maybe it's faster, maybe a little bit better - but mainly because of the direction given by person behind the wheels (me). 

If you want, e-mail me, and I could send you as reply my encoding lines. Just that. Rest of the programs you must get yourself."

Thank you."
,pirateman2,2010-10-11T13:46Z,"Twentyforty, I love your encoding. File size is small and quality is great. You're the man.
thank you..."
