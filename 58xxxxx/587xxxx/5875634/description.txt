Sublime - Santeria [promo].VOB



HQ rare promo video. This music video was filmed in 1997 after the death 
of lead singer Bradley Nowell, who makes a cameo via stock footage. 
The video was a visualization of the story told in the song in the form 
of a Western, and featured Tom Lister, Jr. as Sancho. 

*Almost completely uncensored, with only one word "ass" censored '.'
