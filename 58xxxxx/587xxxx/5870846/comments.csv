,BeepBeepimajeep,2010-10-09T01:00Z,Thx for the upploade neon but i have to say anny one who watch the cartoon series going to hate this movie like i did it berly follows the series and almost all characters it the movie is not even close to what they look like in the cartoon or anime if you want to call it that they berly act like them ether this is a total failure in my eyes and the follow up will most likely suck as mutch as this one if not even more
,istooge,2010-10-09T09:55Z,This hasn't been released on DVD yet.. Is this just the CAM version or is there something I don't know?

,scifygreg,2010-10-25T06:53Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS!
not because its being tracked or because its wrong to pirate, i could honestly care less about that... but dont download this because its a terrible movie and just takes an axe to the tv show we know and love. M. Knight Shamalan deserves to be shot for this piece of shit"
