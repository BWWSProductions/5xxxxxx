P.S.  Zorchtorrent....u have no idea how much I appreciate these! They will go to good use in my immediate circle and possibly further. Thank you!"
,zorchtorrent,2010-10-08T00:04Z,"@ nobody:
LOL , I'm trying my best to get both shows up... i just lost a cumputer and am using a previous system, and I'm still having issues - I'm getting everything i can upped, but when it comes down to it, i go with Beck first   :D
my schuduler is now not working properly on this syste, so I'm having to record manually, which means i may necessariily miss an episode.
I'm working on setting up a dedicated system for this though, so this should be ironed out very soon.

@ steagles:
I'm currently seeing 12 seeds including myself...
I typically seed for 3-5 days and I know a few seed for at least a week.

glad you all enjoy the show, its my pleasure to provide it for you all!"
,cindy25,2010-10-08T02:29Z,"is there any chance you can add Hannity to your list, at least until election day? 
Beck at least is available other places but you are the only source of O'Reilly-hope they are up soon

thank you"
,zorchtorrent,2010-10-08T07:49Z,"@ cindy:
well... you see, I'm catching Beck at 2:00 am and O'Reilly at 5:00 am right now, since I'm having issues with my setup... I cant manually start the evening run if I'm not there to do it! hopefully I can soon have a dedicated system for recording, with the scheduler running properly - then I'd love to get all 3 shows on. :) Until then, I'll get up whatever i can."
