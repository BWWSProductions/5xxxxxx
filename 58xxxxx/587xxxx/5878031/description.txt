This first video from Xiph.Org presents the technical foundations of modern digital media via a half-hour firehose of information. One community member called it \"a Uni lecture I never got but really wanted.\"

The program offers a brief history of digital media, a quick summary of the sampling theorem, and myriad details of low level audio and video characterization and formatting. It\'s intended for budding geeks looking to get into video coding, as well as the technically curious who want to know more about the media they wrangle for work or play.
