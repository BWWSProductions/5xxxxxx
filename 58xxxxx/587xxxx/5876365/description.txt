'Til Death Do Us Part: Synopsis
That Mary Beth Harshbarger shot and killed her husband Mark on a hunting trip to Newfoundland in 2006 has never been in dispute. Whether it was the terrible accident she claimed, or the criminal negligence with which she was charged has been a topic of heated debate among family, friends and experts since. 

Harshbarger has always insisted that when she looked through her rifle scope, it was a bear she saw coming towards her, not her husband. Although acquitted by a Newfoundland court last Friday, in the trial's aftermath, the fifth estate takes a closer look at the evidence and arguments involved in this complex story. 

Bob McKeown takes us to Newfoundland and Pennsylvania to examine key questions about Mary Beth Harshbarger's personal history and behaviour after the shooting, interviewing family members and friends. Some stand solidly behind her and view the events as a tragic accident. Others harbour profound doubts about what happened and feel the trial in Newfoundland didn't begin to provide the answers they need about the death of Mark Harshbarger. For the first time, the fifth estate probes aspects of the story that never made it into the courtroom.
