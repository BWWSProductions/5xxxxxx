                    The Birthday.                            
                    Comedy-drama series revealing what sometimes  
                    goes on behind the bedroom doors of today's  
                    20-somethings in the guise of Steve and Becky -  
                    young, unemployed and lazy. It's Steve's  
                    birthday and everyone wants to go out and get  
                    plastered - except Steve, who is ill in bed. Or  
                    at least he tells his mum and everyone else he  
                    is. When Becky, Laura, Shelly and Paul can't  
                    persuade him to go out and celebrate, Steve  
                    stays in and - with a little help from Dan -  
                    makes very good use of his presents.
