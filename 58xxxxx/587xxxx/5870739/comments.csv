I wasnt planning to upload only horror movies for October, but so far I have done Night of the Living Dead and now this, so maybe I will look in my collection and see if I have anything else worth ULing.  Not to step on Tater44's toes or anything, I know horror is his thing  :)

Anyway, enjoy everyone.  And dont let the subtitles scare you, foreign films are just as awesome, especially this one!"
,OldSchoolFart,2010-10-07T08:58Z,Thank you.
,jackalope77,2010-10-07T19:34Z,"I know, I hate when the description doesn't have all the pertinent information so I make sure it has all the stuff I would want to know.

I hope they fix this thing sometime, it is depressing to see 0/0 all over TPB.

Flames are going all the way this year, no one can stop us ;)"
,totsubo,2010-10-16T02:59Z,"No seeders :(

Been stuck  at 41% for 2 weeks now."
,jackalope77,2010-10-16T09:52Z,"@totsubo: First, its unlikely youve been stuck at 41% for 2 weeks since I only start uploading the files a week ago.  However, regardless of how many seeders this page indicates, I have been consistenly seeding it, if slowly, since I first started uploading amd I will continue to do so until other seeders appear.  Sorry for the slowness, but I only have limited bandwidth.

You are of course welcome to go out and purchase the movie, or to download from somewhere else, but since I try to upload only movies that are hard to find elsewhere, you're probably better off just being patient.

Enjoy, and don't forget to seed afterward to save others from your predicament ;)"
,keleieke,2010-10-17T02:25Z,"I appreciate you!  Totsubo mentions something about no seeders...  I don't think that is the problem.  Don't take my comment the wrong way; I'm trying to be constructive.  I read something from ctang & mikemelo about setting the torrent blocks for more efficient up/down.  Mike said ""I am pleased to bring you high quality NTSC movies in 512KB block sizes which decreases your download time:)""  From here it looks like this movie is transferring at about 5kb/s on average for the lead leachers who are bottlenecked at 46.7% at this time; they are closing in on 100% at a rate of 4.8% per 24 hour period.  Yours are usually slower than the other NTSC comrades, but this one especially.  Re-read first sentence."
,jackalope77,2010-10-17T09:34Z,"@keleieke; Dont worry, i am never offended when people try to help.  I am still pretty new when it comes to uploading, and i have no idea why sometimes availabilty shoot up to 100% really quickly and other times it takes forever.  As of right now, I have seeded this to a ratio of 1.346, but there is still only 52% availability.  Awhile ago, ctang told me to make sure initial seeding was selected, and that made a difference on my next upload, but it doesnt seem to be doing anything for this torrent, no idea why.  Is there something I can be doing that will speed things up for everyone?  I dont know what this 512kb block sizes means, but when I click the ""pieces"" tab on a ctang torrent, it lists a bunch of blocks at 512kb, but when I click ""pieces"" on my torrent, it shows nothing.  Please enlighten me...."
,jackalope77,2010-10-17T09:36Z,"@Agentbay: I am sure the Maple Leafs will be happy to have you as a new fan.  But dont give up on the 'Nucks yet, I am sure they will be fine.  Also, Flames destroyed Oilers tonight! They deserve it, lol."
,keleieke,2010-10-17T16:29Z,"I hear otherwise, but apparently size does matter.  Jackalope, the block size or piece size of this torrent shows 4.00 MB and there are 256 blocks.  I see that when creating a torrent in uTorrent, there is a piece size selector ( http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/2741/utorrentuploadtut2ob8.jpg ); the one pictured shows ""auto detect"".  Then I think here > http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Torrent_Piece_Size describes it.  The fast mikemelo's torrents are 512 block size and # of blocks, 32.  Who wants to share this with punisher_latin?"
,jackalope77,2010-10-17T20:00Z,"Ok, i just checked in Bottorrent, and yes there is a piece size selector on the create torrent tab, and you can manually select 512kb.  I had no idea it made a difference, but I will definitely try it for the next torrent and see what happens.  I dont think there is anyway I can help this torrent is there, without just creating a new torrent and reuploading?"
,keleieke,2010-10-20T02:39Z,"No, I think this torrent is what it is... just in time for Halloween!  I'm curious about the next one (piece size); let us know how it turns out from your end.  Something I just discovered...  Have you ever had a *.iso that's larger than 4.37GB and don't have a DVD shrinker program that will work on an iso?  Solution: WinRAR can unpack it to a familiar VIDEO_TS folder."
,jackalope77,2010-10-20T08:21Z,"I did not know winrar would do that, but fortunately dvd shrink will handle iso's and img's, so it hasnt been an issue.

Next torrent I make I will select 512 block size when creating, hopefully that makes a difference.  Still cant figure out why this torrent is so much slower than my others, when I made them all the same way.  Have almost uploaded to a 2:1 ratio already and only 75% availability.  Go figure."
,keleieke,2010-10-21T03:30Z,"Check this out about super-seeding: http://www.bittornado.com/docs/superseed.txt

and from uTorrent forum...
Q: So if the initial seeder is using super seeding, should he turn it off as soon as another seeder develops out of the swarm?
A: Yes. (from Admin)

I was hoping ""mikemelo 1369"" would/will chime in on this topic as his NTSC torrents were berserk fast.  Thank ""Agentbay"" for listing DVDR uploaders; though watch for PALs."
