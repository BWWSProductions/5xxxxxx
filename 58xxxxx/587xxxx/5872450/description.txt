Synopsis
On a one-day business trip to the country-side, Juan Desouza (Julio ChÃ¡vez) embarks on an unintended journey. When he reaches his destination Desouza discovers that the man traveling next to him is not sleeping but dead.
Secretly, he assumes the dead man's identity and invents a profession for himself.

"El otro" was the Grand Prix winner in Berlin Film Festival 2007, with a Silver Bear for best actor (Julio ChÃ¡vez).

In a minimalist story -with literary echoes from J.C. Onetti to J.L.Borges-, Julio ChÃ¡vez confirms he's a very solid actor.
