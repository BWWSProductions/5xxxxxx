That's far from the truth! You pervade in this delusion through all the inoculations and inculcations; brainwashed, you are.

You have become a controlled machine by the mainstream scientist's who have successfully accomplished their mission.

It is unfortunate, very unfortunate, that such beautiful gift of life given so abundantly to us is vanquished by natural men seeking nothing by freedom from a God, a Judge, and a RulerĂ˘âŹâbut a fair and just God.

It is sad to see, indeed, that whilst so much laws exist in this universe that govern the many facets of it, we human species are exempt from any law given for our own greater good, because of our own self centeredness and selfishness we repudiate such virtue. 

It is all stemming from our sinful nature that we greatly take for granted this abundantly rich and glamorous life. 

The raison d'etre of this life, according to shameless science, is an unguided process over millions of years which, we have not witnessed, yet boldly profess the superiority of sound knowledge over any anti-our-veracity claims.

And there is no reason for this, except the wish to be god. Ever since Satan beguiled Eve into thinking she would become as wise as God, and so the predicament continues. 

All the devout devil worshipers, oblivious as they are, manipulate scientific data, distorting and molding it into their own scientific pretensions, to find a comfortable and snug position for it all.

,adaa24a4,2011-05-02T09:25Z,"With each wishing-to-be-god evolutionary endeavor there proceeds the unraveling and perverting of the DNA, the complexity of all sustaining life-form, and all the encompassing features of it to fit in a no-God- and dog-eat-dog-world illusion, in one rigorous train of doomed forthcoming train-wreck. 
The Evolutionist's/Devolutionist's downright abhor and demean anyone who dares to oppose them. This can be seen by rampant flouting comments about, and the assailing of atheist's, once under the influence of devolution, on anything contrary to their established ""facts.""
Evolutionists/Devolusitionsts/Atheists seek to dominate and control everything; the courts, the school education system, including all institutions, etc., with the one ideal to brainwash and inject the virus that is proliferating throughout the continental globe.
You must disillusionise yourself; stop mortifying yourself by the domination of manipulator's, self-righteous power-seeker's, and misotheist's."

I will stand for reason, I will stand for logic, I will stand for humanity, I will stand for Law, I will stand for axiomatic morality enrooted in us, to fulfill not the wishful thinking of atheism, but to fulfill a greater obligation, set for us all, to choose and to accept and to carry out. This is sanity, and I embrace it, to the ends.


""What a crock of 'thumper shit!""

Why are you so butt hurt?



The devil offered the scientists a deal, they took it, and the sacrament."

,die2012,2011-10-31T20:04Z,"adaa24a4. We witness the past through the evidence left behind. It could and has been interpreted incorrectly, time to time.

Your argument would sound better if you didn't mention what the devil said to Eve. There is no evidence of that.. just stories past down.  "
