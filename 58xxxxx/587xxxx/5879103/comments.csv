,dingo8baby,2010-10-11T08:10Z,"for the 5000th time, mkv is a container, not a codec. the codec (which gives such a great compression ratio) is h264, which is a standard in about everything (including your HDTV cable/satellite)"
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-11T08:30Z,"I agree with both of you.  

It's just a container.  Some of the devices like the D-Link 520, don't recognize it.  That sucks.

Luckily, the WD TV Live does recognize it.  

There are converters that I'm guessing basically rename the file, or do some other relatively simple conversion to allow devices that don't recognize mkv files to play them as vob or avi files."

,chair_tard,2010-10-11T15:12Z,"I love h.264/mkv.
No more transcoding... just rewrapping to mp4, takes 10 minutes.

FUCK XVID/AVI!!! When will this crappy outdated, outmoded, inferior codec and wrapper finally die the death it deserves???"
