Ancient Mysteries - Pompeii: Buried Alive

Two-thousand years ago, Rome was an all-powerful empire and Pompeii was one of its prosperous provincial towns-until Mount Vesuvius exploded in the largest eruption ever recorded. In a matter of hours the thriving city was entombed under a thick layer of ash and debris, undiscovered for centuries. ANCIENT MYSTERIESr journeys to the first century to explore the remarkable city of Pompeii. Recreate the events leading up to the explosion and learn how the ash kept the city and its inhabitants--the only significant discovery of Roman bodies ever--in a unique state of preservation. Wander through the ancient streets of this sophisticated society and witness current excavations. Interviews with archaeologists and historians, extensive location footage, and archival documents-including one remaining eyewitness account-shed eerie light on the cataclysmic eruption of POMPEII, a city frozen in time.
