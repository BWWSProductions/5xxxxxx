Suns Of God - Acharya S


In 1999, Acharya published her first book, The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold, (ISBN 978-0932813749) arguing the concept of Jesus Christ as myth. She states the Christ story is a fabrication based on earlier pagan mythology.

In 2001, Acharya wrote the forward to a new edition of Kersey Graves's The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviours: Christianity Before Christ (ISBN 093281395X).

A follow-up book, Suns of God: Krishna, Buddha and Christ Unveiled, (ISBN 978-1931882316) was published in 2004. Acharya comments on the Hindu story of the life of Krishna, as well as the life of Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama). She claims parallels to the Christian stories of the life of Jesus as evidence that the story of Jesus was written based on existing stories, and not the life of a real man. Suns of God (with a foreword by author and theologian W. Sumner Davis) also seeks to address some of the criticisms leveled at Christ Conspiracy.[2]

Her 2007 book, Who Was Jesus? Fingerprints of The Christ (ISBN 978-0979963100) continues the theme of The Christ Conspiracy by expanding her theory questioning the historical validity of Jesus Christ alleging \"early Christian history to be largely mythical, by sorting through available historical and archaeological data.\"[3] In 2009 she released Christ in Egypt: The Horus-Jesus Connection (ISBN 0979963117) and The Gospel According to Acharya S.[4]
