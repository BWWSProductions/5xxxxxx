I've been using builds similar to this since 2002 to provide restoration services to 1000's of customers.  This edition is my first public release now that I'm no longer operating a regular business.

If you'd like to see features added to this disk in future releases, please let me know.  Also, if you find this disk useful, please make sure to keep seeding it until a new version is released.

I'm also looking for some really cool graphics for the (CD) boot menus.  If you have something, hook me up!

Good luck, and please be sure to report back with success stories and any bugs.
