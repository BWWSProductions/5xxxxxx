The only known issue, is KB2416472 reappearing in the updates.  Hate MS, not me or Onepiece."
,AlmightyDread,2010-10-16T23:42Z,"Firstly, thanks for the recovery disk (I've hit the +1 for quality).

I have a bug to report, maybe you have a fix. My nVidia drivers have not installed as they should, and updating does not seem to rectify. I've had to take off monitor hardware acceleration in order to get smooth flowing graphics. This is workable, but I'd like to get back my nVidia control and panel, and be able to give full hardware acceleration."
,AlmightyDread,2010-10-17T01:34Z,"Ignore the second paragraph of preceding comment. My typographical errors therein are clear evidence that I was not thinking straight. My problem had nothing to do with this XP build, so that makes this a perfect torrent."
,AlmightyDread,2010-10-17T01:40Z,"By the way, the solution for that repeating KB2416472 (.NET Framework) update is simple. Install it once; then, when it reappears, decline install, and then use option to not be reminded of that particular update. That should keep it from annoying the fuck out of you."
,potlord,2010-11-02T02:28Z,"I was gonna say... I've not run into any problems installing any drivers (nvidia, ati, intel, other).  The reason I declined to include the video and audio driver packs, is that some people prefer having the full install of those items.

Major issues plague the utility portion of this disc though... I totally screwed up the hiren and slax boot options.

And yeah, I also ignore that update after the first install.  It'll eventually be fixed when/if it's superseded by a future update.

I'm starting on a new release, don't know when I'll get it out though.  There are a lot of moving targets for me to track and I've been busy with other things lately.  Can't seem to find enough time in the day to play Counter-Strike anymore."

,maddog4578,2010-11-22T16:38Z,"hi 
i have some experiance buiding and repairing computers, could you please explain how to use this disk to restore a dell Pc ,i do not have the original installation disk but the serial number is on the rear of the PC .
Do i insert the disk and boot up the pc ? after setting bios to boot from cd drive ?
thankyou in advance "
,bennermax,2011-02-08T10:40Z,"
i could not get this to boot up no matter what i tried "
,fretwalker671,2011-04-06T04:25Z,"So what is the difference between royalty oem, systembuilder oem, upgrade, and retail? I tried upgrade cause that's kinda what I'm trying to do and after a while it asked for a product code Id.. Is the upgrade part not activated? 
I'm trying royalty oem now, whatever that is"
,greest,2011-05-25T07:55Z,"oem = origional equipment manufacturer - someone like dell, or hp who factory build pc's and ship the whole thing they made themselves.  

For instance during windows install, if a  dell oem copy of windows and the bios identifies itself as belonging to a dell pc then its considered activated, without you having to go through the activation process.  

Retail - code matches the copy of windows they sell in the shops as a seperate item."
,mike18xx2,2012-01-20T06:37Z,What the FUCK good is it if it can't do a Repair Install?
