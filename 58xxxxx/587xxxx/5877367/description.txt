This 2006 collection presents many of the finest solo tunes by 
Journey's powerhouse vocalist, Steve Perry. In addition to drawing 
from his successful debut, STREET TALK (1983), which yielded the 
dramatic hit single "Oh Sherrie," and the largely overlooked FOR 
THE LOVE OF STRANGE MEDICINE ('94), the anthology features tracks 
that didn't make it onto any official Perry albums, including the 
smooth ballad "Against the Wall" and "Don't Fight It," his rocked-out 
'82 collaboration with Kenny Loggins.

Contains 7 previously unreleased tracks from the studio sessions 
for the unissued album AGAINST THE WALL recorded in January 1988 
and a previously unreleased demo.

Domanico, Brian Garafalo (bass); Larrie London, John Robinson, 
Moyes Lucas, Jr., Craig Krampf (drums); Tony Brock (drum programming).
