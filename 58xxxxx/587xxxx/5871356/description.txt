Tom's a regular guy, a utilities lineman, married, with a young son, his wife is pregnant; he hangs out with long-time pals in a 

Chicago neighborhood. At a party, his sister-in-law hypnotizes him, and he goes into a deep trance. Before waking him, she suggests 

that he keep his mind open. That night he sees flashes of violence and the ghost of a young woman. His young son, too, is "a
