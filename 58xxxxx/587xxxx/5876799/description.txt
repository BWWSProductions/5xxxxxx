Many credit Macabre as being one of the first bands to play a style of music which would influence death metal (forming in August of 1984). They weren't really a death metal band themselves but their lyrical content and grindcore sounds furthered what would become death metal.

Macabre has been known to refer to their style of music as "murder metal."
