Released in 1978, "Beauty's Only Skin Deep" was the first solo album from the ex. Runaways lead singer. Obviously an attempt to cross over into more radio-friendly territory by Runaways producer Kim Fowley, who also produced here. This album is mostly late 70's pop/rock. There is a duet with her sister Marie on "Love At First Sight".
