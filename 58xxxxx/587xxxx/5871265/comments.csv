,rocco_sifredi,2010-10-07T15:05Z,"This is a FAKE, don't bother. Probably one usual E.A. decoy made by an idiot who works for them."

,Dimmis80,2010-10-07T16:56Z,Fuckin FAKE.!!:/
,Chabs232,2010-10-07T22:14Z,"Fake or not, we can't tell if no one downloads it first.

The MP beta's size was 1gb. + the guys from EA said they'll release the MP (or SP, I don't remember) first.

Anyways, it is impossible to tell if it's fake or not.

This user is not trusted/a VIP/a Moderator/(whatever high grade TPB-guy), has no torrents at all... But still it is impossible to tell."
