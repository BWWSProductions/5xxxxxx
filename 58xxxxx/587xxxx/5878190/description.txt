Who Finances the American Tea Party Movement?

In the last months a protest movement in the political landscape of the United States
makes headlines, which looks at first sight like a grass root movement from the
population. The so-called Tea party movement supports ?Ã‡Â¥Non establishment?Ã‡Â£-
candidates, who begin with intermediate elections in November against the applicants
of the democrats. The case of the Tea party is an example of how powerful
capital interests in the USA take in the legitimate protest of the citizens for their own
goals.

Comment: Remember, the Illuminati always control both sides of the game. You can't win. The solution? Be on no ones side, but on your OWN SIDE. And convince your friends to be on their own side too. When there are no followers there are no leaders, and without any leader you won't be fooled by any false leader. In this time and age nobody can be trusted, I repeat NOBODY. Therefore, nobody should be accepted as a leader. You don't need a leader, you have to become your own leader. As long as you believe to need a leader, you're still quite immature. You require a leader as long as you believe to require one.
