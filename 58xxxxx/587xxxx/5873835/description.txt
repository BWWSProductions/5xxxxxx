Someplace, somewhere, in the future mankind fell. A Great War turned Earth into a wilderness and a wasteland. Cars, electricity, computers, all modern technology is long gone and forgotten about. There are pockets of civilization living in decaying and ramshackle cities, but the long and endless roads between these places are filled with bandits, swindlers, and things that go bump in the night. Living in the ruins of one of these cities is Chris, a runaway child. With no hope that his family will take him back, he lives with a group of misfits in a junkyard, stealing to survive. When a traveling preacher tells him that his father is alive and wants him to come home, Chris must decide whether to stay with his new family of thieves or venture into the wilderness in search of his dad and a better life. Join Chris on the journey of a lifetime, as he meets strange drifters, discovers a city full of every kid's desires, travels through awe-inspiring mountains and raging rivers, and battles creatures of the night.
