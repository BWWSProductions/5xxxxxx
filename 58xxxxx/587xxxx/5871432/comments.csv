,nikoHD,2010-10-07T16:20Z,Hi 20/40. If you can could you upload season 1 of cougar town or friends?
,lilars26,2010-10-07T17:10Z,Thanks 20-40.
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-07T17:15Z,"@nikoHD: Early seasons of Friends have been aired as old, full-screen format. For that reason - I wont do it. Many nice DVDrips are available, for quite a while, everywhere.

I can pack episodes I already have - but even if I have full Season 1 of Cougar Town, I was really pissed by ugly, bad airing (I wrote about a lot back on mininova) that I released (as torrents) only episodes 1-4 than cooled of and resumed upping episodes 12-24.

Oh, the main reason for such reevaluated status was very VERY low interest. I cannot do shows for few people only (highest number of seeders of one episode of Cougar Town was - 22, and for a day. That's ridiculous, right?)

Upping the season packs is supporting of Hit & Runs. In recent two weeks I upped season packs for Glee, for Big Bang Theory, for Chuck and for How I met... - and ALL have 92-98 PERCENT OF PURE HIT AND RUNS. People get what they need and say ""Fuck others. To hell with their needs. I am fast, I am rich and I am not born in some god-forsaken country. They are - so fuck them all!""
Same here. But diametrical opposite.

To cut that shitty story short - maybe I would put up season pack for Cougar Town. Even if I don't see the point (DVD rips are very nice)."
,lilars26,2010-10-07T19:08Z,I figured it must be a good copy because there was no sample.I was right.I wish I could give you more than a +1.But that's all they will allow.Thanks again 20-40 for a great R5.
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-07T20:08Z,"I am not happy with input. There was a lot of pixelization especially in crowded scenes - and in  really really small encode these ""problems"" are amplified and look ugly. Since I have not particular opinion about this movie, for R5 it would suffice. If anybody objects - well... bigger copies are better - VISION as 1400 MB and Noir 700 MB for sure."
,lilars26,2010-10-07T21:19Z,"No thanks.Vision can stick it.If the seeder/leecher numbers on the side are acurate hit and runs seem to be increasing.C'mon people,if you like what you're getting and you want it to stick around then seed,seed,seed."
,nikoHD,2010-10-07T22:48Z,Ok thanks 20/40. I just found all the dvd rips of friends on TPB. I also think your 480p tv shows are very good. When a rip comes out can you upload dinner for schmucks 2010 version?
,htctouch,2010-10-08T06:42Z,just dropd into say hi . i just loved this movie downloaded noir version . must watch movie .thanx 2040 u rock as always.
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-08T08:00Z,"Thanks to all.

@nikoHD: Dinner for schmucks CAM was available two weeks ago - but bad and ugly one. I would wait for DVD/BluRay."

I always manage to give twentyforty's torrent +2. After all he deserve it. 
Not downloading this. Will wait long for BRrip."
