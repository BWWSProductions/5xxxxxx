,xiIix,2010-10-09T21:16Z,"720p means 1280x720. 1080p means 1920x1080. That's like the first thing you learn about HD content. The ""p"" is for progressive, as oppose to ""i"" which is interlaced."

,DaktahTorr,2010-11-20T08:15Z,Try this WD TV Live update and let us know if it plays now... this update fixed some of my play issues...http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/updates/?family=wdfwdtv_live

,shawnduhast,2011-02-06T11:24Z,"SORTED :-)

download ""mkvtoolnix 4.5.0"" free software.

Add file using tab on right.
Save downloaded file again using ""start muxing"" tab at the bottom BUT select the video MPEG4 in the middle box then select the 3rd tab along below  ""extra options"" - set the compression option drop down menu to NONE - (blank is not good enough)  

Hey presto video now plays :-)"
