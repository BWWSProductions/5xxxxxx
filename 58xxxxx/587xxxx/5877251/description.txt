Instructions:
-------------

   1. Run the PS3KeyUpdater.exe application in Windows.

   2. Connect PS3Key to your PC in update mode. To do this, simply insert it and remove it a few
      times in until both of the LEDs (both red and blue) light up at the same time.

   3. Choose \"File\" and \"Open\" and then select the update file (ps3key_v2.upd).

   4. Click \"Update Now\" at the top of the screen. This will only be active when the PS3Key is
      connected to your PC and both the red and blue LEDs are lit.

   5. That\'s it! The progress bar will indicate when the update has been applied.

   6. It is now safe to remove PS3Key from your PC and continue to enjoy using it with the
      new features!
