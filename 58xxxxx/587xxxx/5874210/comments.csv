1st: Total CMA Pack project donâ€™t have any website, itâ€™s placed only on some warez/torrents websites
2nd: This is new REAL 0.52b version of Total CMA Pack, I check this torrent with other warez release
3rd & last: I check a few antivirus & Itâ€™s Clean & no Infection, your brain is Infected!, You donâ€™t have any idea about computers & software.

If you donâ€™t believe I really donâ€™t care, check on others torrents or warez websites, Total CMA Pack is very popular & recommended for use, donâ€™t write stupid comments.


btw. Thanks to the uploader for this new version, works great...."
