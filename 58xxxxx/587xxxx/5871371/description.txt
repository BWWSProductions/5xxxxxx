From Tantor:

Uncle Tom's Cabin opens with a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby 
facing the loss of his farm because of debts. Even though he and his 
wife, Emily Shelby, believe that they have a benevolent relationship 
with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling 
two of them---Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and 
Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza---to a slave trader. Emily 
Shelby hates the idea of doing this because she had promised her maid 
that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to 
see Tom go because he sees the old man as his friend and mentor. 

When Uncle Tom's Cabin was published in 1852, it became an international 
blockbuster, selling more than 300,000 copies in the United States alone 
in its first year. Progressive for her time, Harriet Beecher Stowe was 
one of the earliest writers to offer a shockingly realistic depiction of 
slavery. Her stirring indictment and portrait of human dignity in the 
most inhumane circumstances enlightened hundreds of thousands of people 
by revealing the human costs of slavery, which had until then been 
cloaked and justified by the racist misperceptions of the time.

From Wiki:

Stowe, a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an 
active abolitionist, focused the novel on the character of Uncle Tom, a 
long-suffering black slave around whom the stories of other 
charactersâ€”both fellow slaves and slave ownersâ€”revolve. The sentimental 
novel depicts the reality of slavery while also asserting that Christian 
love can overcome something as destructive as enslavement of fellow 
human beings.

Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel of the 19th century, and 
the second best-selling book of that century, following the Bible. It is 
credited with helping fuel the abolitionist cause in the 1850s. In the 
first year after it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold 
in the United States alone. In 1855, three years after it was published, 
it was called "the most popular novel of our day." The impact attributed 
to the book is great, reinforced by a story that when Abraham Lincoln 
met Stowe at the start of the Civil War, Lincoln declared, "So this is 
the little lady who made this big war." The quote is apocryphal; it did 
not appear in print until 1896, and it has been argued that "The 
long-term durability of Lincoln's greeting as an anecdote in literary 
studies and Stowe scholarship can perhaps be explained in part by the 
desire among many contemporary intellectuals... to affirm the role of 
literature as an agent of social change." 

The book, and even more the plays it inspired, also helped popularize a 
number of stereotypes about black people, many of which endure to this 
day. These include the affectionate, dark-skinned "mammy"; the 
"pickaninny" stereotype of black children; and the Uncle Tom, or 
dutiful, long-suffering servant faithful to his white master or 
mistress. In recent years, the negative associations with Uncle Tom's 
Cabin have, to an extent, overshadowed the historical impact of the book 
as a "vital antislavery tool."
