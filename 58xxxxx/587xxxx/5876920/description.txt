this is my bone thugs collection. i think it is pretty much a complete aside from a mixtapes and a few side things like some cd\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s pending release and greatest hits i have chosen not to have (as i have all the cd\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s i can make my own greatest hits)
if you see anything wrong with these/missing items or other issues please let me know as i put this together in a few hours and obviously that wasnt enough time to go through and listen to every track fully.
