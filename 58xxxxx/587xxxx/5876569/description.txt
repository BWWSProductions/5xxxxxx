There's plenty of action for The Saddle Club in these five fabulous episodes as Stevie proves she can ride just as fast as anyone, and the girls compete in the annual riding trials. There's also danger when an old mine collapses - with Melanie and Jess trapped inside! Veronica can be relied on to let spite get the better of her but whatever stunts she pulls, you just know she's more likely to end up with mud on her face. And as for Trouble... well he isn't helping much either - it's chaos wherever this crazy little donkey goes.

Through it all Carole, Lisa and Stevie support each other and work together to solve every crisis - and even save one horses life. Is it any wonder that The Saddle Club are everybody's favourite Horseback Riders!"
