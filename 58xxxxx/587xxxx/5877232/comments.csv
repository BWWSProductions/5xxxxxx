,Awesomo42,2010-10-10T10:36Z,"Glad to hear it, enjoy."
,Bujaaa,2010-10-13T10:30Z,"Can you upload this in better quality?
Sound in this torrent is very low quality."
,Awesomo42,2010-10-17T10:00Z,"Haven't listened to the entire book yet, but from what I sampled it is the same quality as the source, which is relatively good for audiobooks. Not perfect, but that's because of the source rip, sorry. Don't know of a better rip around."
,No_256,2010-10-21T14:30Z,"64 kbps 24 hz.
It's okay."
,drewlt,2010-11-10T19:03Z,Would have been nice if the mp3's were per chapter like the other 2 audio books - but thanks for the upload!
