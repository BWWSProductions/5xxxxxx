I have a few tv series dvd's of mine. 

I want to rip them to my pc hard drive, and then just leave them on my HD. or put them on a usb  then want to transfer them to my playstation 3 to be able to play. 

Each disc has 4 episodes on it, and I'd like to be able to keep those episodes split up when I rip it. I dont want any of those vts_01 and all that, if possible. 

Is their a program that rips the disc to the hard drive and splits up each episode, for example: 
Episode 1 700mb 
Episode 2 700mb 
Episode 3 700mb 
Episode 4 700mb. 

thats just an example... i was looking at doing series my gf owns and stuff... Big Bang Theory :) lol 

would DVDFab work?yes no? is no what would i need? also i wouldnt mind keeping the files somewhat small but not killing teh quality either.. cause i do wanna mostly use my laptop and connect to my LCD via HDMI... 

thanks a lot hope you can help! and hope its simple haha"
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-10T01:36Z,@yetti12  I would use DVDshrink to extract each episode for encoding. Then i would use Handbrake or any other X264 encoding program. Usually those 350 mb tv shows have a resolution of 624x352. Make sure to use CABAC encoding for better picture. A good place to get help and to learn about all sorts of encoding and ripping = vcdhelp.com happy reading mate

hey thanks for the reply... been messing around trying dvd shrink im not sure if im getting it but... anyways you use handbrake to convert the VTS files to MP4 or M4v wtv it is everyone uses?

Also how do you insert you name or change the name within the copy of shows and movies you upload? like right now it says VOB-01 or something.. how do i either remove this or edit it?"
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-13T01:45Z,"I do not tag my files i simply rename them once ive done encoding and testing them. but if u want to tag ur files like HR or PT then google file tagger.. theres a bunch of programs that does that.
I use Handbrake but theres alot of other good programs out there. Xvid4psp, Handbrake and XMedia Recode are the ones I recommend. Xmedia Recode is the one that gives results like HR but it takes ages to encode with so thats why im not using it for other then DVDR rips. "
