Fantasy is an album by American singer-songwriter Carole King, released in 1973. This time
King wrote all the songs herself. At the time of its release, it only reached #6 on the Billboard
album chart, but has remained highly regarded by her fans over the ensuing decades. One of
the tracks of the album is a song called "Haywood" which is about drug addiction.

The Spanish language track "CorazÃ³n" (the Spanish word for "heart," also used as a term of
endearment, as in this song's lyrics) was a moderate hit single from the album, as was
"Believe in Humanity." The flip side of the latter single, "You Light Up My Life" (not the Debby
Boone hit), charted separately from its A-side.
