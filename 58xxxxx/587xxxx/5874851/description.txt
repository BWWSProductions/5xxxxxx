"The Third Man"

Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) 
call Castiel (Misha Collins) for help when 
they investigate a case about several dead 
police officers who seem to have been killed 
by the plagues of Egypt. Castiel confirms the 
staff of Moses was used to kill the cops and 
tells Sam and Dean that Heaven is in a state 
of chaos and God's weapons have been stolen. 
The three head off to find the thief and come 
face to face with an old enemy.

Enjoy  :)
