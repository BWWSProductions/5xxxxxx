download
Lost Planet 2 TRiViUM IsoFix
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5871971/ 
unmount TVM_LP2.iso from virtual drive.
close torrent client.
no process should block TVM_LP2.iso!
unpack tvm-lp2isofix.rar
place tvm-lp2-isofix.exe in a folder to TVM_LP2.iso
run tvm-lp2-isofix.exe
mount to virtual drive TVM_LP2.iso and install."
,olbot8811,2010-10-08T14:17Z,gonna do that now man cheers for reply ill let u know after :P x
,olbot8811,2010-10-08T14:21Z,"edit.... well iv done that now just reinstalling lets see how this time goes.. when i clicked the iso fix .exe file it just brings a dos prompt and then a message saying iso image fixed .. ( dont quote exactly) but yeh so lets see if this time works cos  i thought i had done this before... 

when u say ''''place tvm-lp2-isofix.exe in a folder to TVM_LP2.iso''''

you basically meen just have the fix iso exe and the disc image in the same folder dont you ... :P "
,viperstrikes,2010-10-08T14:22Z,Has some one actually got it to work.
,olbot8811,2010-10-08T14:32Z,well somethings wrong with this page now i cannot see the comments.. however mate thanks for that it must have been the problem caused by i had the disc image still on the virtual drive and that musta well obviously conflicted with fixing the iso ... thanks again m8 and anyone who had same prob will sure find the fix now :) x

,Vvornth,2010-10-09T19:55Z,"I did a Benchmark test in the game and my FPS got average 65 FPS with max settings. I am using GTX 480 @ DirectX 11. So wulfgarbane is wrong, it does works on DX11, but only if you have a gfx card that support DX11 (I think). "
,RTTK,2010-10-10T03:40Z,"Im getting a trojan horse warning at the launcher.exe (from the crack) when trying to copy it into the main folder, i am using ESET NOD32, anyone can confirm whether or not it is safe?"
,lozzer22,2010-10-10T17:50Z,This is out in 43 days >_< Thanks very much Ex_Exist!
,BarrySoetoro,2010-10-12T06:25Z,"Downloaded ISO
Downloaded ISO fix
Extracted ISO fix to same folder as ISO
Ran ISO fix (it confirmed fix)
Mounted ISO
Installed game
Copied cracked launcher and .dll
Started game

It doesn't matter if I click start, settings, benchmark, etc. All I get is a black screen, menu music, and a cursor. This goes for DX9 and DX11.

System is fine... card is HD5870. The official benchmark ran fine when I tried it a couple of weeks ago. Any ideas?"
,cozmakka,2010-10-13T00:32Z,"do exactly as wolfsgane says, works a treat, the iso thing dont fukkin work, cheers for dl exexist, some issues wi game, no prob mate, thx a lot for putting it in, lots of respect to you, issue is solved for me now thx to wolfy smith or wotever is name is. cheers thx a million"

CHEERS WULFGARBANE AND EX EXIST"
,BarrySoetoro,2010-10-13T01:11Z,"Well, considering I'm not a retard and have about 200 games installed without a hitch, I'll just have to chalk it up to the ISO fix, which I did first before trying anything else.

Some of you are saying it didn't work... well, it worked for me. Maybe that's the problem then. I'm almost done downloading again, but this time won't use the fix before installing.

If that doesn't work, I guess it's some obscure hardware / software issue:

Phenom II X6 3.0Ghz
Sapphire HD 5870
8Gb RAM
Win7 X64

I never have a problem with TRiViUM... we'll see how it goes this time.

Thanks, as always, Ex_Exist."
,masterfaster2,2010-10-13T14:15Z,What is the md5 checksum of the patched iso ?
