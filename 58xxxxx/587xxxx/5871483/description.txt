              The second part of the famous futurological action,        
              action which takes place twelve years after the events     
              that occurred in the original game.                        
                                                                         
              As a result of human activity planet EDN III, where once   
              reigned permafrost, has changed beyond recognition: the

              hot, arid deserts. And again, in the vast world of the     
              harsh global outbreak of war: this time people came        
              together in a desperate struggle for supremacy on the      
              planet not only with its original inhabitants - insect
