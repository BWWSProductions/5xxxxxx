But, having a really hard time downloading now - Demonoid has been down for some time, and I'm getting 20kB/s...gonna take days at this rate :("

Thanks, but please mention these things when uploading a torrent."
,Thundordan,2011-07-24T12:28Z,"Resolution: 840x480px;

Audio Tracks: 1, English, no commentary.

Video Track: no subtitles.

Good quality, so far, watched the extended pilot, and it's not the clean version. (it is the one where Gob says ""Trick is what a whore does for money. ..Or cocaine!"")"
