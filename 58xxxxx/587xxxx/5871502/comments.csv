Thanks for the movie. The movie appeared to be a bit dark throughout - but is watchable. A9, V8, S10"
,DjStiv3,2010-12-19T07:11Z,"it seems watchable although i havent watched all of it yet,, but if yu want to have a good experience watching it then wait for a real authentic dvdrip,, for now this R5 will do for anyone thats curious for the storyline and wants to see it,, the movie is sort of dull in contrast and the lighting/shading is sort of blurry in sense,, feels like a CAM almost,, so its up to you if yu want to see it,, my score?
A-7
V-6
Movie? dont know yet but milla jovovic is in it so i bet its awesome like the others"
