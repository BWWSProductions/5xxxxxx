Sister Pelagia: bespectacled, freckled, red-haired, woefully clumsy and constantly knitting, teaches gymnastics and literature, and in her spare time, solves crimes. This hugely entertaining mystery introduces us to a heroine who is a cross between Miss Marple and one of Charlie's Angels. A prized white bulldog has been poisoned, and the Bishop of Zavolzhsk sends Pelagia to investigate the dog's death as a favour for his aunt. The investigation soon descends into something far more dastardly, involving stolen gold, betrayed women, untrustworthy lovers, and two headless bodies that are pulled out of the river on the edge of the estate.

A frightened monk from the island monastery of New Ararat, arrives seeking the help of Bishop Mitrofanii. The monks have been troubled by visions of a dark, hooded figure that appears to walk on the waters of the vast Blue Lake.
Sceptical of ghost stories, Mitrofanii dispatches Alexei Lentochkin to investigate the mystery - only for Lentochkin himself to fall victim to the phantom. When two more of the Bishop's trusted advisors meet with unexpected fates, Sister Pelagia takes matters into her own hands.
