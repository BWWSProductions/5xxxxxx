,Camel-Toe,2010-10-07T12:14Z,"I did mention there was doublers but as it is a SiteRip I just got what was available. It was an automated process so I don't sit there and manually download the doublers knowingly.

If it worries you so much then you too can get a clone remover and do it yourself.

There is nothing worse than people complaining about something they get for free.

Read the description before downloading, if you do not like what you read then do not download it. It is that simple.
