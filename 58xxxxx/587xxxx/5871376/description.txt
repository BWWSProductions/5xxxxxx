From Tantor:

For the fifty years that followed its original publication in 1901, Up 
From Slavery was the most widely known book written by an African 
American. The life of Booker T. Washington was the embodiment of the 
American self-made man, and his autobiography gave voice for the first 
time to a vast group that had to pull itself up from nothing. The 
well-documented ordeals and observations of this humble and plainspoken 
schoolmaster reveal traces of Washington's other nature: the ambitious 
and tough-minded analyst. Here was a man who had to balance the demands 
of his fellow blacks with the constraints imposed on him by whites. 

Historically acknowledged as one of America's most powerful and 
persuasive orators, Booker T. Washington consistently challenged the 
forces of racial prejudice at a time when such behavior from a black man 
was unheard of. While he mollified white leaders by publicly agreeing 
with their racist views of social parity, he also worked tirelessly to 
convince blacks to work together as one people in order to improve their 
lives and the future of their race. 

This story of Booker T. Washington's rise to distinction emphasizes that 
a strong work ethic and excellence in whatever one is doing will be 
rewarded no matter what race or what position a person holds in life. As 
far as Washington was concerned, slavery only made the black person 
stronger. He also argued that both blacks and whites would benefit more 
from giving blacks vocational training than from encouraging the "craze 
for Greek and Latin learning." While this set him at odds with other 
black leaders of his time, it also set the groundwork for Washington's 
Tuskegee Institute to be the best-funded black educational institution 
of its era.

From Wiki:

Up from Slavery is the 1901 autobiography of Booker T. Washington 
detailing his slow and steady rise from a slave child during the Civil 
War, to the difficulties and obstacles he overcame to get an education 
at the new Hampton University, to his work establishing vocational 
schoolsâ€”most notably the Tuskegee Institute in Alabamaâ€”to help black 
people and other disadvantaged minorities learn useful, marketable 
skills and work to pull themselves, as a race, up by the bootstraps. He 
reflects on the generosity of both teachers and philanthropists who 
helped in educating blacks and native Americans. He describes his 
efforts to instill manners, breeding, health and a feeling of dignity to 
students. His educational philosophy stresses combining academic 
subjects with learning a trade (something which is reminiscent of the 
educational theories of John Ruskin). Washington explained that the 
integration of practical subjects is partly designed to reassure the 
white community as to the usefulness of educating black people.

Washington was a somewhat controversial figure in his own lifetime, and 
W. E. B. Du Bois, for example, criticized some of his views. The book 
was, however, a best-seller. While it is aimed at the general reader, 
V.S. Naipaul has commented that it appears to be sending out separate 
messages to black and white readers.
