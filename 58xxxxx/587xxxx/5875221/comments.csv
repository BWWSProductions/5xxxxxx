[T],teslaman,2010-10-15T05:08Z,"Ah, dunno if you found it already, but there are a couple of options for the AC3 decoder. You can get ffdshow-tryouts, or CCCP (Combined Community Codec Pack), or my personal preference, AC3Filter.

AC3Filter is probably your best option if the AC3 decoder is the only codec you don't have. The reason I like it is because it tends to play all AC3 files well, whereas I sometimes get bad playback with ffdshow.

Hope this helps and Thanks. :)"
