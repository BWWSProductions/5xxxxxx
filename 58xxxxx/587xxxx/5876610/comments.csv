go to server list, both of you connect to the same server."

I didnt do the main and zone folders cause theyll just be replaced then."
,abhi6,2010-11-19T16:01Z,"@ItsSoZazzy
your have to copy 2 files from aIW-DLC\main folder and paste them in your MW2\main folder (in other words merge the folders not replace).

,TheWayHeWantsIt,2011-02-13T02:13Z,"One question; is it possible to play online with people who have bought the game (through steam and have the newest patch). My friend have v. 1.2.208, and it's isn't  the same as in the description. Is it only dedicated/cracked servers or what?  "
,TheWayHeWantsIt,2011-02-13T17:40Z,"I got it working, following the steps on the link! :) However, when I turned off the game and went to eat dinner and came back, I wasn't able to start the game from ""iw4mp"" in installation folder.. Any ideas? thanks for answers"

,krille09,2011-04-09T11:39Z,Google link doesnt work! Please fix
,Pulu,2011-05-07T04:30Z,"Are you supposed to copy and paste EVERYTHING that you get after unpacking the rar file to the MW2 directory or just the iw4mp file? Why is that just 123 kB, exes are usually about 30 times larger aren't they?

There's an empty folder called zone included in this torrent and there's also a zone folder in the MW2 directory that's over 5 gigs. Surely you're not supposed to overwrite that? But every other file that unpacks I copy to the main mw2 folder?"
,Pulu,2011-05-07T19:29Z,"Any chance someone could take a second to answer my question, pretty please :)"

So, while downloading alterIWnet it does not update past .32%. Anyone have any ideas on how to get this to work?"
