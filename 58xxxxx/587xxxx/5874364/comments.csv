,carl_83,2010-11-05T09:46Z,Nice one for spending time uploading this raymondhome. But cambo82 and wetbol your talking s**t. Your dreaming if you think its a v9a9. V4A3 at best. 
,carl_83,2010-11-05T09:48Z,Pisses me off when people write comments are they are completely wrong. This is a great film by the way
,vsjane,2010-11-10T04:39Z,"It's evident that someone did a lot of work to this cam to make it better - thanks for that. However, a significant portion of the film is missing, which is disturbing. At any rate, thanks for your efforts."
