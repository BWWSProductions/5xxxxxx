Ran on my iPod Touch 4G running iOS 4.1, jailbroke perfectly!

Few notes: be prepared to hold/release home/power buttons with little notice, after it finishes, you have to run the limera1n app on your home screen to install Cydia, then reboot for Cydia to show up. After that it's smooth sailing."

That maybe so, and a good point, however, if you remember due to the success of jailbreakme.com  the servers went down for many hours. so I thought i would put this up just in case this also dis-appeared."
