,unlimitek,2010-11-19T21:17Z,"Vista/7 users, you need to disable DEP protection before running keygen. To do so, do the following:

1. Open the command prompt as administrator and type the following:

     bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOff

2. Reboot system and run keygen.

3. Enter the name and a 10 digit phone number without dashes or spaces and generate the serial.

4. To set things back to normal, open a command prompt as administrator again and type:

     bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx OptOut

Hope this helps...worked like a charm for me numerous times."

If you already have a working version of 4.x installed, then all you should have to do is run the executable and it will just do the upgrade.

This is what worked for me.

I went from v4.1.2737 to v4.5.2949 without using the keygen and without turning off Data Execution Prevention (DEP).

When you run the executable for v4.5.2949, it will try to get you to download the very latest version, but you can just cancel and continue with the install of the upgrade and it will install as a registered version. I do not know what will happen if you download the latest version and install it.

Also, I have proshow.exe blocked from communicating with the home server through Windows 7 firewall. Sometimes a program will deactivate or start nagging if it is detected as ""pirated"". I don't know if this is the case with ProShow and I don't want to find out, either. Better safe than sorry. :-)

If you want to install v4.5.2949 without being prompted to download the latest version, then, I assume, that you can block the v4.5.2949 executable through the Windows 7 firewall so that it will not communicate to the home server on which version you already have installed. I say ""assume"", because I have not tried this myself and I am not sure if some other file communicates with the home server once the install exe is decompressed to the temp folder."
,DemePoole,2011-01-08T13:42Z,Simply install v4.5.2949 over v4.1.2737. Worked for me. :-)
