ProShow Producer was designed for professionals who are creating shows commercially. 
The all-new ProShow Producer 3 allows you to create advanced, professional-grade 

presentation masterpieces that not only emotionalize and inspire audiences but also bring 

them to the point of sale. With an award-winning feature set, including unlimited 

photo/video layering, show templates, branding, copy protection and built-in media 

authoring, plus all-new creative features like masking, vignetting and motion keyframing, 

the only limit to your success is your imagination. 
ProShow Producer 3 expands upon the already impressive list of creative features and 

production control options. Now photographers can create professional-grade slide show 

masterpieces that not only look polished, but exhibit advanced, high-end artistic effects 

previously achievable only through using 3rd party professional photo and video editing 

software.
