,MarcusN0,2010-10-10T18:25Z,"I also can confirm that this release is fully working, no trial..

And btw, Splash Pro 1.2.4.0 is the most stable release so far.."
,MarcusN0,2010-10-17T00:15Z,"Ok, but AVG scanned it 100% clean.."
,Faziri,2010-10-17T21:30Z,"God ***** dammit!
This might very well work just fine, but i had my trial period expire once and it somehow made a registry entry or whatever somewhere in my system that keeps making these cracked version crash. No matter what i do or which cleaners i use, i can't get rid of it and i just can't make Splash Pro run without crashing right away!"
