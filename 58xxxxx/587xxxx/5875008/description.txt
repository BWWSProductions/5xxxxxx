The True Story of Troy

The legendary city of Troy, whose destruction played a major role in the Greek epics THE ILIAD and THE ODYSSEY, was for a long time considered a myth. But the discovery of a possible site for this city in 1873 caused its existence to leap from fantasy into reality. Separating fact from fiction, this History Channel program reveals fascinating new data about the real Troy, using reenactments and computer animation to bring this sacked city back to life.
