Also whys this one over a gig? I liked thoes nice 550's"
,CuteAngel,2010-10-11T15:08Z,SEED PPL SEED!!
,greygorey,2010-10-11T18:43Z,Its 720p. 720s are always larger than normal. but definitely worth it.
,jonek21,2010-10-11T18:44Z,"for real, where are all the seeders at"
,classy05,2010-10-11T18:58Z,"my download stopped at 24%
 were else can i down load ?"
,raafi123,2010-10-11T20:43Z,"ok soo THIS one is very Wired....
i too am stuck at 24%, and the first half downloaded super fast.. but once it reached 24% it completelly Stopped.. why is that Quad-k?
Also the size happene to be relativelly Larger than the other versions,, everything cool there?

i would like to mention it's been not even 24hrs since this file was uploaded and we are all trying to get it.. perhaps this high volume traffic we all are cause MIGHT be the problem to been stuck at 24%....

regarless thank you for uploading it Quad-k"
,ESOAP,2010-10-11T21:22Z,Your the man
,Bonk815,2010-10-11T21:38Z,This would be awesome but my download just went from 1 hour to 1 year at 24.1%
,Quad-K,2010-10-11T22:02Z,"I APOLOGIES SINCERELY to everyone downloading.

My internet connection went out last night due to maintainence (at 7 pm?! till 2 am AUS) by my ISP. Its back online, i am very sorry."
,greygorey,2010-10-11T22:32Z,"If your internet is back up, why am I still seeing no seeders? "
,greygorey,2010-10-11T22:35Z,"My theories on the stuck at 24% is this:
Quad-K had his internet running and the most anyone was able to download before his internet went out was 24% and those people became seeders even though they appear as leechers."
,xAlexburnsred,2010-10-11T23:01Z,wow no seeders huh?  guess i'll be the first one to do so when this finishes
,firepirate88,2010-10-12T02:58Z,I love Dexter and haven't been able to watch it because I don't have Showtime.  Thanks so much King Kong Killer!!
,raafi123,2010-10-12T03:12Z,"ladies n gents everything is back to normal!
Quad-K rocks!

,jonek21,2010-10-12T03:30Z,lol thats only 3 K's
,classy05,2010-10-12T06:58Z,"is anyone else having problems with audio not working ??
how can i fix it?"
,Quad-K,2010-10-12T09:11Z,"Turn it up, volume is a bit low on this release. If you still cant hear it, download and install VLC player. It definitely works with that. If not its on your end."
,Quad-K,2010-10-12T10:42Z,"I thank all you guys for your support, as long as you seed a minimum of 1.1 and comment quaility i am happy as it shares it to others and lets them know if its worth downloading. 

**THOSE WITH SOUNDS ISSUES**

This was not made for Windows Media Player, download VLC player (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/), its a free Media player that plays near EVERYTHING in brilliant quality.

**THERE IS SEEDS**

712 to be precise, but TPB is having issues detecting seeders and leechers, so give it a go.

Again, thanks for sharing this to others. Have a nice day."
,scruffyboo,2010-10-12T11:35Z,"jesus quit bitching about seeders, these come down in no time at all, for free, and someone else has done all the work"
,benenya,2010-10-13T04:20Z,"Quad! Love it man. 
A10
V10
I am not sure what this .mkv format is but the playstation 3 will not play it. It has no problems with Xvid or avi but not this one. I'll just have to watch it on my computer.
Thank you for the upload!"
,Quad-K,2010-10-13T06:33Z,"I thought the higher quality rip would be better, and i agree mkv are more difficult to use, but are the future. But for now on i will uploaded my normal 550mb avi's mmk ? =]"
,Skolhataren,2010-10-13T10:14Z,When is Episode 4 come ?
,Quad-K,2010-10-13T11:49Z,"New episodes air every Sunday, so you have to wait until its been released this Sunday."
,aholicaholic,2010-10-14T04:16Z,Quad-K keep up the good work! You are now my source for dexter this season please don't stop!
,dhole177,2010-10-16T05:39Z,"Question. Why in .mkv? The others were in a more universal format but mkv is not great. If you continue to post new Dexter seasons (please do, you will have a special place in my heart), if you could use avi, mpeg, or a better format that is used more. 

Thank you very much for posting these, you are amazing and my god of Dexter."
,Quad-K,2010-10-16T08:40Z,"Yea, from now on it'll be in 550MB AVIs."
,raafi123,2010-10-16T23:43Z,"fellow's fellow's lets give our favourite uploader a break yea...

Quad-K u keep doing what u do best, 
if i were the ""customer"" and u the ""seller""  i'd be very happy with the ""product"" and would not complain....

cheer's

,Ohlawlhey123,2010-10-18T08:16Z,"Can you upload this again in avi format like episode 1, 2, and 4 please. Also, episode 4 has no seeds. =("
,Quad-K,2010-10-18T09:35Z,"@Ohlawlhey123

I AM seeding, do not pay attention to ThePirateBays seed/leech thing, its not accurate. There is currently 700 leechers (whether you can see them or not) so once i can get it out there to someone 100% it will be extremely fast."
