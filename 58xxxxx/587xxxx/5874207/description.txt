Carcass - Live St. George's Hall, Bradford 15.11.89 - 1989 - Distorted Harmony

live recordings - audio sucks big time - mexicans cant even place a hole in the middle... hehe - too much tequila I guess (see pics)- record spins and wobbles about 
half a CM - I cant believe this is as EM ( http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=74985 ) says:
The black vinyl edition on Distorted Harmony was an edition of 1000 & was
officially sanctioned by Bill Steer. The red vinyl pressing of 1000 is most
likely a boot.
