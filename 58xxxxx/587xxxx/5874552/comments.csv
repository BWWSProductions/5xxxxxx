Is there a problem with me putting up the Alien Anthology? WiKi has great stuff but I fail to see why u keep posting their stuff on my stuff.....LOL Their files are 1080p x264 MKV files. Mines are 720p M4V files.......And Im pretty sure I have ""Quality"" files as well....LOL LOL LOL "

,sctehking,2010-10-09T14:35Z,"Is this the director's cut or the normal one? Either is fine, I just wish there were seeders :( "
,moshster,2010-10-15T20:37Z,Runtime seems to suggest Special Edition
,moshster,2010-10-15T20:38Z,"Oops, I meant Theatrical Edition, SE is 154mins on my DVD."
,ncunico,2010-10-16T11:11Z,I seriously doubt that this is a blu ray rip. Id say its an upscaled dvd or hd tv rip

Thats your opinion..... I appreciate the feedback"
,wyup,2010-10-21T00:55Z,"Thanks, quality is great, also for the size and runtime!
I guess it can't get much better with the upcoming quadrology edition."
