Re: olleberg20, seeds.

Couple of hours ago you said that, but at time of this post, there's 33/349 seed/peer.

So i guess swarm was still all download peers at time you said that.

Anybody not seeing seeds from this time of my post, it's your connection, swarm is seeded 33 and climbing.

Peace. : )"

Peace. : )"
