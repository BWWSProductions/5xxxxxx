BBC Rosslyn Chapel A Treasure in Stone HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2010

Art historian Helen Rosslyn, whose husband's ancestor built it over 500 years ago, is the guide on a journey of discovery around the exquisite Rosslyn Chapel, which used to be one of Scotland's best kept secrets, but became famous when it was featured in Dan Brown's the Da Vinci Code. Extraordinary carvings of green men, inverted angels and mysterious masonic marks beg the questions of where these images come from and who were the stonemasons that created them. Helen's search leads her across Scotland and to Normandy.
