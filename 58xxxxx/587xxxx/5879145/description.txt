Sir Simon Rattle and the Berliner Philharmoniker perform a concert of German late-
Romantic music and works by three great pioneers of early 20th century Vienna. In the
first half of this prom the opening Prelude from Wagner's opera Parsifal is paired with the
Four Last Songs by Richard Strauss sung by soprano Karita Mattila. After the interval,
orchestral adventures by Schoenberg, Webern and Berg, who collectively became known
as the the Second Viennese School but each developed their own distinct creative voice.

In the first half of their second Prom, Sir Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic pair
late works by two of Germany's greatest late-Romantics â€“ 'Richard the First' and 'Richard
the Third', as the conductor Hans von BÃ¼low rather wickedly called them [quipping that,
after Wagner, there could be no 'Richard the Second'].

After the interval come the sensational sonic adventures by the three great musical
pioneers of early-20th-century Vienna. Celebrated Finnish soprano Karita Mattila returns
to the Proms as soloist in Strauss's opulently nostalgic reflections on life's last days.
