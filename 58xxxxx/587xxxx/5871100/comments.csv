,Agnetha2006,2011-06-02T16:37Z,It's strange that so many people still don't understand how to make ISO files but still download video files. MontRoucous you have to use a multimedia program to burn ISO files such as Nero (or many other programs available). The ISO file can be burned on DVD or you can play it with any DVD emulation program like Nero. Magic ISO is a good program to load the ISO files.
