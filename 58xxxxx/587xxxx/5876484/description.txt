Swedenâ€™s Kristian Matsson â€“ The Tallest Man on Earth to you and I â€“ is an old-fashioned success story of sorts. Following his posting of a few primitively recorded tracks to MySpace a few years ago, it wasnâ€™t long before a local label head came knocking and he was touring the wilds of his native country, barely enough songs behind him to carry a set list.

Cut to 2008: following a rapturously received debut album and three nights at the Los Angeles Town Hall in support of Bon Iver, it wasnâ€™t long before venerable US indie Dead Oceans picked up the young singer. This second effort is the first to receive widespread distribution outside of Scandinavia, and a superb record it is too; a ranging, dusty collection of songs that belie his upbringing in rural Sweden, coming off more peak-era Dylan or early 20th century troubadour than anything else.

Matsson doesnâ€™t deny these influences (Dylan is right there, listed on his MySpace account), but he hardly fosters them, either. While The Wild Hunt strays from its one-man-and-guitar template only once over the course of its ten songs (perhaps significantly, in the woozy, Springsteen-inflected closer Kids on the Run), it offers plenty in the way of surprises â€“ its rough, assured command of melody and intuitive chord sequences veering from chest beating to contemplative in tone.

Lyrically, there is so much going on here itâ€™s hard to get a handle on. King of Spain sits at the heart of the piece, a swinging, irrepressible number that draws on almost every Iberian clichÃ© going in a bitter swipe at its creatorâ€™s own foolhardiness. Although the title-track opens the record on a note of optimism, it is so strewn with elemental, often Biblical imagery â€“ indeed, its central motif of departure plays heavy on almost every single song â€“ that Matssonâ€™s greater, darker concerns are unavoidable.

Nevertheless, The Wild Hunt is a heady and enthralling work, its impressionistic nature bolstered by levels of charm and confidence found all too rarely in these modern times.
