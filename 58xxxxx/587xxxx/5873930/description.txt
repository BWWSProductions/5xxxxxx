"High 'n' Dry (Saturday Night)" is the 1981 title track by British heavy metal band Def Leppard from their multi-platinum album High 'n' Dry. It was ranked number 33 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs. It is one of five songs by Def Leppard, which had a promotional video, but however were not single releases.

This song made the "Filthy Fifteen", a list of songs criticized by the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), an American committee formed in 1985, for having explicit lyrics. The group's mission was "to educate and inform parents" about "the growing trend in music towards lyrics that are sexually explicit, excessively violent, or glorify the use of drugs and alcohol," and to seek the censorship and rating of music. "High 'n' Dry (Saturday Night)" made the list due to lyrics involving "Drug and Alcohol Use". Although there are lines in the lyrics that relate to alcohol use, the song is generally perceived to be about having fun on a Saturday night in a rock and roll, albeit hedonistic, lifestyle.

High 'n' Dry is the second studio album by British heavy metal band Def Leppard, released on July 11, 1981. Its title song, "High 'n' Dry (Saturday Night)", made #33 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs. High 'n' Dry was Pete Willis' last full time album with Def Leppard.The album charted at #38 on The Billboard 200 and #26 on the UK Albums Chart.

Since 1992, the band have consisted of Joe Elliott (vocals), Phil Collen (guitar), Vivian Campbell (guitar), Rick Savage (bass guitar), and Rick Allen (drums).

The band's strongest commercial success came in the early 1980s to the early 1990s. Their 1981 album High 'n' Dry was produced by Robert John "Mutt" Lange, who helped them begin to define their style, and the album's stand out track "Bringin' On the Heartbreak" became one of the first metal videos played on MTV in 1982. The bands next studio album Pyromania in 1983, with the lead single "Photograph", turned Def Leppard into a household name. In 2004, the album ranked number 384 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

Def Leppard's fourth album Hysteria released in 1987, topped the U.S and UK album charts. As of 2009 it has 12x platinum sales in the United States, and has gone on to sell over 20 million copies worldwide. The album spawned seven hit singles, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one "Love Bites", alongside "Pour Some Sugar on Me", "Hysteria", "Armageddon It", "Animal" and "Rocket".

Their next studio album Adrenalize (the first following the death of guitarist Steve Clark) reached number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and UK Album Chart in 1992, and contained several hits including, "Let's Get Rocked" and "Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad". Their 1993 album Retro Active contained the acoustic hit song "Two Steps Behind", while their greatest hits album Vault released in 1995 featured the new track "When Love & Hate Collide".

As one of the world's best-selling music artists, Def Leppard have sold over 65 million albums worldwide, and have two albums with RIAA diamond certification, Pyromania and Hysteria. They are one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling over 10 million copies in the U.S. The band were ranked #31 in VH1's "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock".
