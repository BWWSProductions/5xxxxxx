Since his days with the genre-busting 1980s alternative rock outfit Camper Van Beethoven, David Lowery has been moving progressively toward a more roots-oriented, singer-songwriter sound. His later work with Cracker bears this out, and the band's 2006 release GREENLAND is Lowery's most stripped-down and straightforward to date, miles away from the grungey bombast of earlier releases.

Steeped in the sounds of folk and alt-country, with a touch of indie rock thrown in for balance, GREENLAND floats gently along the surface, yet there is a deeply personal undercurrent to nearly every song on the record. Lowery's songs explore themes of loss, heartbreak, and personal upheaval in a way that feels pointedly autobiographical, giving his clever, detail-rich lyrics an added poignancy. This is particularly notable for a band that's often big on tongue-in-cheek irony, and it is this poignancy that gives GREENLAND its winning edge.

No Depression (p.110) - "Frontman David Lowery sounds more reflective than usual as he wonders whatever happened to his California heyday..."
