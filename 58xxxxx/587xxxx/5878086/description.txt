[color=Maroon][b]Like its immediate predecessor, 1971's MUSIC, 1972's RHYMES AND REASONS had to
stand in the shadow of TAPESTRY, which was still fairly high in the charts when this was
released. (TAPESTRY, after all, was the biggest-selling album of all time until SATURDAY
NIGHT FEVER came along.) Still, RHYMES AND REASONS is on its own merits a fine
album. Although it had no hits as big as "It's Too Late" or "Where You Lead," the high points
on this album are just as artistically satisfying. The best-known track is probably the moving,
almost hymn-like "Been To Canaan," which has remained an important part of King's
repertoire in the years since. However, the album's twin highlights are a pair of gorgeous
ballads, "Goodbye Don't Mean I'm Gone" and the hushed "I Think I Can Hear You."

I consider this album the masterpiece of Carole King's art. While Tapestry is one of the most
famous and popular albums of all time, because many of the cuts hit home so hard. I've
known many people especially men who find the album depressing. Rhyhmes & Reasons is
more uplifting. It's one of the first CD's I bought to replace a worn out album. For couples, you
should be playing "THe Frist Day in August" every July 31st.
