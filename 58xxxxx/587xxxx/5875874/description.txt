           Something has gone terribly wrong at research station          
           320, a secret research facility one mile beneath the           
           earth's surface. All communications are gone, all means        
           of escape destroyed and an extremely dangerous horde of        
           rapidly mutating ancient flesh eating creatures are            
           consuming everything in their path. Eight survivors of         
           the outpost, two research subjects, three mercenaries,         
           two research technicians and a medic barricade themselves      
           inside a remote area of the facility with little food,         
           almost no means of defense and little hope of rescue.          
           Their one possible escape route is through thirteen            
           levels of terror that will lead them to the surface. And       
           one of them is not who they seem to be, but the darkness       
           itself which has taken human form.
