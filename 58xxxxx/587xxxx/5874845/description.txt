This is Martha's debut solo album - it's a quiet, intimate and personal collection of 13 songs (plus a number of 'hidden' tracks).
Her roots are obviously in folk music, and while the disc is a collection of her own compositions references to English folk music are easy visible. This Anglicism is even more present in the lyrics and delivery, the songs are rich in atmosphere and firmly located in modern England, and her vocal delivery is unaffected and natural.
Musically this is a quiet and restrained album, the constants throughout are Marthaâ€™s acoustic guitar and piano work and these are fleshed out by a wide variety of backing that includes cello, violin, flute and percussion.
The songs are all strong and contain and a striking attention to detail, many of the songs focus on small moments and she draws the listener in by concentrating on information most other songwriters overlook.
This is a genuine, honest and heartfelt album thatâ€™s full of excellent songs with memorable melodies that stand out due to their English references and feel. An excellent album.
