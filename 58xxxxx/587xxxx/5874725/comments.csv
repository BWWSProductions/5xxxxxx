What eidsiva says is correct: the editing out of material makes this result questionable. Visit the link to user comments on Amazon.com .

The editing of the original content (released in VHS format) for release in DVD format resulted in reducing the original 13 episodes to 11. 

Tell me the absent content wasn't ""important""..."
