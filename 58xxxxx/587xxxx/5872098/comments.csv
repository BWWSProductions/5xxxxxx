If it exists in French thank you for letting it know"
,Gamerdad,2010-10-24T05:42Z,"WORKED 100%   Thanks!  I love retro gaming in 2K style!

BUT...............

Is it the shoes?  IMO, nope!  It's the hands!?  What am I talking about?  Well, the aspect of the game that allows you to PUSH & BE PUSHED takes a lot from this AWESOME game.  Mainly because the cpu will do it from one end of the court to the other!  It's semi-understandable if someone is about to BOOM SKAKA LAKA on you, but on an inbound pass?"
