[V],NLUPPER002,2010-10-07T15:15Z,"@kimiani

No not a R5 bluray.

Put it in the wrong selection must be Video > Highres - Movies."
,kurac55,2010-10-11T17:44Z,"NOOOOOOO. just as i surrendered waiting for it and went and watch the crappy r5 low resolution.

Anyways, great."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-10-13T07:49Z,"Source?
In description it says Frames 25, so then it is not Blue-ray rip, what is it then?
""HD Source....: 1080P BluRay 
FRAME RATE...: 25.000Fps 
VIDEO CODEC..: X264
AUDIO CODEC..: AC3
RESOLUTION...: 1904x1056
RUNTIME......: 105 MINS ""
If it would be 105 min must be 23.976 frames.
Then the metadata says 1h 40mn.
What a mess!
Your aspect ratio is 1:80 and it should be : 1.85
I'm afraid this ""rip"" is some upscaled fake hd.
Average to low encoding settings too.
I'm prety sure the Machete.2010.BluRay.720p.DTS.x264.CHD
is much more worth it. yes, DTS not 448KB/s AC3 like in this torrent, lol ;-) "
,defic,2010-10-13T20:37Z,dont waste your time on this

Audio 2,3 sec before"
,rogertw,2010-10-14T18:59Z,"video quality somewhat equivalent to a 700Mb DVD rip, not a 7gig HD rip!"
,Alexthex,2010-10-16T17:39Z,That's right. This sure ain't 1080p
,LupinII2,2010-10-20T09:39Z,Its pretty funnny how nobody can seem to get the hint that the grainy quality of this film is intentional and not a problem with the upload. For followers of the work of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez this type of film making is no suprise. Try watching Grindhouse (the double feature film from which the fake Machete trailer first originated) and then maybe you'll understand whats going on here.

,jshityeah,2010-10-28T22:54Z,"Pretty good rip
This has got to be one of the best movies Ive seen all year
Thanks uploader"
,PigRapist,2010-12-11T09:18Z,"Great torrent!! 1080p, no hard-coded subs.  No problems whatsoever.  Thank you so much NLUPPER!!  "
,Solidice,2010-12-21T14:17Z,"hmmm okay, quality is real good, remember, the grain is there intentionally.

HOWEVER, the subs are timed okay but translated whorribly."
,cenation80,2011-01-13T22:16Z,thanks
,Zephyroz,2011-01-26T21:56Z,Can someone tell me how to get in touch with the subber Bradje? I can do a better job at translating these movies than him. I watched Pineapple Express with his subs too and they where just as awfull.
,Smartboy021065,2011-03-13T15:41Z,Subs do not work by me !!
,Captain_Harlock,2012-03-01T18:27Z,"Bad, bad, bad
Jerky frame rate"
