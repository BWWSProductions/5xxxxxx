,emohawk1234,2010-11-15T00:51Z,"Agreed, there's a lot of noise in the picture. I'm going to try another one, thanks for the effort though."
,semener0,2010-11-21T21:25Z,"Best quality I've ever fucking seen. no noise like the other guys said, but I cant play the actual movie, only the sample -_-

Cheers.
10/10"
,Hob-Dawgh,2011-06-14T22:59Z,Awesome movie and great quality! Thanks :)
,LanZer4,2011-07-13T00:33Z,Video quality is total garbage if you have a high res display (2560x1600). The codec algorithm seem to do tricks so only x720 displays are ok.
