,joshuag942,2010-10-23T06:59Z,please re upload in 320 kbps
,Zoooma1,2010-12-18T21:39Z,"Yes, please upload in 320 kbps.  Anything less ain't worth the download.  Thanks."
[V],piratetorrent1989,2010-12-21T12:19Z,"unfortunately, i don't have access to this cd, and this is how i found this album elsewhere on the internet. I might consider buying the CD sometime and doing a reupload (possibly in FLAC even), but for the time being I don't have any better quality, I'm afraid"
