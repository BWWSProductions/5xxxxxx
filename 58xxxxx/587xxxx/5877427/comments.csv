[T],pmp_2010,2010-10-21T01:20Z,"There is no crack included. Once you have installed a trial (single user), copy contents of the ""EQX"" folder to the program files folder which contains the SPSS files. The path looks something like this:
C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\19

Please read the instructions, everything is mentioned there."
,SumeklamKidd,2010-10-22T11:02Z,"pmp_2010, Many thanks for this most excellent file.

I've been waiting for it for a long time.

Everything works. No virus. No problems. Just follow the instructions in notepad folks. EZ!

I'd recommend not linking directly to the SPSS site for the tutorials... IBM may be able to shut you down if you do. 

GREAT PROGRAM!!!"
,cecile77,2010-10-23T13:37Z,"Hello
Thank you very much for the file. I am having a small problem and i was wondering if you could help me. I followed the instruction but for some reason i am getting hte following error when i try to start the program. 'The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect' do you know why?
Thanks again for your help"

The I realized the instructions said copy the CONTENTS of the folder, not the folder itself. After that the ""free trial period"" notice was gone. YAY :-) "

@cecile77
I fixed the problem after an hour of work, when you install it the first time make sure the install and redistributable package have run as administrator checked in settings.
Then when you install it it will successfully it will get the c code it needs to complete the install, after its installed RUN the license activation tool from your start menu then activate it for temporary usage. Finally copy the files from the EQX directory into the install folder."
,wm17,2010-12-08T02:23Z,"I was wondering once you do the cert dump does that make the program completely functional? for example, does it only certify it for an extended period of time or does it make the program usable forever?

thanks"

,statpro,2011-02-22T01:23Z,"Hi folks! Great upload, really great!! But (there is allways some ""but"" :), except that some nonparametric tests don't work, there is another bug. If you try to convert SPSS data file into another data file format (SAS, STATA etc.), command loggs in output, as if everything is ok. But, actualy output data file is not created. The EQX crack is good, and the problem is in SPSS ver. 19.0.0. IBM has released patch which removes this (and a lot of other bugs), and transforms SPSS into ver. 19.0.0.1. But, EQX crack for ver. 19.0.0 doesn't work on ver. 19.0.0.1. Could this be a challenge for EQX to make new crack? :) "

,Catweazle1983,2011-04-14T16:20Z,It is possible to do non-parametric tests. Just go to Analyze -> Nonparametric Tests -> Legacy Dialogs. And choose one of the options listed. I was able to do a Kruskal Wallis Test here. Would be nice though if these tests also could be accessible through Analyze -> Nonparametric Tests -> Independant Samples. Could you fix this PMP? By the way thanks for the upload!!!

These is a solution for this problem! Before you install look at the c:\program files\ folder. Look if there is a file called ""common files"" without extension. If you find such a file you have to delete it before installing SPSS19! If you already installed SPSS 19 delete the file and make an repairinstallation. Make sure you activated view on invisible and systemfiles in order to find the ""common files"" file.

To remove the Trial period, copy all the contents from the EQX folder and then paste it to Computer > C:/ > Program files (x86) > IBM > SPSS > Statistics > 19 

PAste all the contents in the EQX folder from the folder you downloaded here in piratebay to the 19 Folder in you Program files. Hope I help.
