,dolcichw,2010-11-12T09:45Z,yes all tracks say 4:22 if played in something like itunes but if you play the tracks you will notice if it should be shorter it skips to 0 sec left when the song ends and if it should be longer it plays past 0... havent tried burning to make sure it plays right
,dolcichw,2010-11-12T19:37Z,...they wont burn right. all tracks are burned at exactly 4:22 even though the whole file is there
