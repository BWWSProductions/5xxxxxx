AB III is the upcoming third studio album by the rock band Alter Bridge, to be released on October 8, 2010 in Australia. It will then be released in October 11, 2010 in Europe and November 9, 2010 in the United States. It is a departure from the band's first two albums for several reasons, the primary reason being that it is a loose concept album, a first for Alter Bridge, with themes of mostly struggles with faith and believing. It is more dynamic and progressive, musically, and it features lyrics that are much darker than the lyrics on the band's previous albums. AB III is also the first Alter Bridge album to be released through Roadrunner Records, making it the band's third consecutive album to be released through a different label.The album will be released through Roadrunner Records worldwide except North America, where it will be released through the band's own label, Alter Bridge Recordings, with EMI handling distribution.
