In 1998 Danny B Harvey, Slim Jim Phantom and Lee Rocker, "The Swing Cats", went into the studio and recorded a CD for Cleopatra.  On the CD Lee sings 3 songs and Danny sings 1 while the rest of the vocals are done by guest vocalists: Tim Polecat, Jamie James and Claudia Cummings. Also appearing on the CD are guest musicians Jeff "Skunk" Baxter  (guitar and Pedal Steel), Adrian Demain (guitar), Chris Mostert (Sax) and Mark Ritter (Piano & vibes). Released early 1999.

Although many songs on the CD are from the Swing era, the performances have a strong Rockabilly/Jump Blues influence (definitely a great dance record).
