          Though not the pilot episode of Rod Serling's series, "The Twilight Zone,"
 it was Rod Serling's production that lead to "The Twilight Zone" TV series. Because
 TV viewers at the time were not used to the kind of surprise, twist endings that 
 for which "Twilight Zone" became noted (and which this episode featured), Desi Arnaz
 appeared on-screen after the episode was finished and offered his "explanation" of
 what "really happened."

 It's 1958 and Pete Jenson (William Bendix) is seeing a psychiatrist (Martin Balsam) 
and telling him of the same dream he's been having for about a week. It's in a hotel 
in Honolulu on what he later finds out is December 6, 1941, the day before Pearl Harbor...

 *Basically the lost pilot of Twilight Zone 1959, an extra on the bluray collection.
