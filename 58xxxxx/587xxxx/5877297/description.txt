                                ====================



In the sweltering heart of Senegal, in a place called Fongoli, a chimpanzee performs an earth-shattering act. She strips a branch of its leaves, chews the tip into a point and jams the tool into a hole in a tree, killing a bushbaby. In short, she has been making tools and using them to hunt.

Only humans are supposed to be capable of that. Anthropologist Jill Pruetz takes us deep into the fascinating world of the creatures she has studied for 9 years, giving us exclusive access to not only their groundbreaking hunting skills but their other strangely human ways. They spend most of their days on the ground, they splash in swimming holes and they even curl up in caves to sleep.

 
With the help of experts on our earliest ancestors and newly discovered evidence of the chimp stone age, we take an eye-opening scientific journey that reveals as much about ourselves as it does about the remarkable chimps of Fongoli.
