                    The Day Simon Finally Found The Strength To  
                    Accept That His Mother Was Getting Married.  
                    When Grandpa is taken ill, it's unsure whether  
                    Tanya and Clive will be able to get married  
                    today. Grandma takes on the responsibility of  
                    trying to resolve the situation, but is she  
                    right to advise Tanya to get married?    
                    Meanwhile, Liz has a favour to ask of Simon  
                    which might help Adam sort out his schooling  
                    problems.
