,ihackz,2010-10-11T20:45Z,"Microsoft Office 4.2 for Mac was released in 1994. (Version 4.0 was skipped to synchronize version numbers with Office for Windows.) Version 4.2 included Word 6.0, Excel 5.0, and PowerPoint 4.0. It was the first Office suite for the Power Macintosh.[26] However, Microsoft later acknowledged that ""(m)any customers commented that Office 4.2 wasn't enough like the Macintosh.""[27] The final release for Mac 68K was Office 4.2.1, which updated Word to version 6.0.1, somewhat improving its performance."
