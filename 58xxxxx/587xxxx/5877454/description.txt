All tapes had a narrator interrupt the talk one half of the way through and tell you to flip the tape over. I've edited out this narration and merged the two sides together. You'll notice a slight break in speech at these points (typically about 40 minutes in ... 1/2 the time noted in the links). 



The Doctrine and Covenants Seminar

There was no introductory information on the first tape. It becomes clear that this seminar was also in Snowflake.
The year 1991 was used in a context that indicates this was the year this conference took place.

tape 18 - part 2 (1:27:27)
it appears that tape 18 was the end of the Snowflake seminar. 
not sure where the following tapes were given/made

first three appear to be in Hyrum's stake
