RUSSIAN EXPANSIONISM

The Russian Endgame Strategy for
World Dominance. A Strategic Analysis of Global
Current and Future Events.

Introduction:
There would be many that would immediately start to protest and argue with the title of
this article. They would argue that it was absolutely insane, or at best incompetent on
my behalf to even suggest that Russia had plans for world domination. I would argue
back, (if they would listen), that the factual evidence to support this thesis is undeniable.
As an introduction into this article, I would like to include some information from Anatoly
Golitsyn, who in his 1984 Book, NEW LIES FOR OLD, came out with the startling
statement that the leaders of Soviet Communism, mostly from the KGB, had designed
and implemented a long term, 40+ year plan for total world domination starting in the
late 1950's. He knew this because he had worked on the plan as a Major in the KGB
before he defected to the US. He outlined their plan, in detail, which was so fantastic
that it was considered too outrageous to consider as even remotely possible by most of
the Western Intelligence Community and government leadership.
This is from a National Book Review, Sept 7, 1984 (emphasis are my own):
ANATOLY GOLITSYN, now an American citizen, is a former major in the
counterintelligence service of the KGB, which he joined in 1946. He defected in
December 1961, at the age of 35, from his "cover" assignment as vice consul at the
Soviet Embassy in Helsinki. He lived in England until August 1963, when he left for the
United States. Here Anatoly Golitsyn worked for the CIA under the vigorous
sponsorship of James Angleton, for twenty years head of counterintelligence until he
was fired in December 1974 by the then CIA Director William Colby.
(Rogerâ€™s note: There is strong evidence that William Colby, who became head of
the CIA, was in actuality a Russian Spy. This would be consistent with
Golitsynsâ€™ accusations that the CIA was riddled with Russian Spies from top to
bottom. Former CIA director Richard Helms, James Angleton and others were
convinced he was a spy, and went public with their assertions (leaking it to the
press) when Colby was actually appointed as the CIA director...and when they
could get no investigations started within the intelligence community. As Richard
Helms told his biographer, Colbyâ€™s acts â€œas Director of Central Intelligence were
entirely consistent with those of a man who was a Russian agent.â€ As the
investigation started to heat up, Colby resigned as director and then died
mysteriously in a canoe accident. It was Colby who helped dismantle the CIA...DOWNLOAD THE TORRENT.
