,Computer_Man,2010-10-10T10:27Z,"The subtitles have some errors. Can you please update or fix your subtitle maker as these are the errors:

Somtimes for ages a letter is capitalised in middle of a sentence/word.

Sometimes the Capital 'i' is an 'l' or the reverse.

It happens in this torrent and in some of your more new torrents."
,Computer_Man,2010-10-10T10:29Z,It is annoying to have someone deaf in your family and instead of reading Samantha they are reading Damantha.... Or Stanford is Dtanford......!

,tuck59,2010-11-08T02:57Z,If you want perfection then go buy the movie.
,zekeisaszekedoes,2010-11-21T18:37Z,"Jesus tapdancing Christ.  It's free!  It's free!  People will even moan about movies that cost ten or twenty dollars going for free because of some minor errors.  If you want it flawless go buy the damn DVD... although in this case I wouldn't bother because the movie is awful.  This is a ""for girlfriend/sister/wife/mother"" ONLY type deal.  Try to be out the room when she's watching it..."
