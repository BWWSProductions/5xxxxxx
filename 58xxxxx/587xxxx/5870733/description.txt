Naked was among the most intricate electronic takes on mutant-funk this side of the Talking Heads, Yello and Was (Not Was). It started with The Last Film, a mutant-funk revolving around a marching beat, anthemic brass and angelic vocals. The influence of Yello is clearly visible in the hi-tech electronic beats and vocoders of Frightened In France, though it's no match for Yello's wackiness. In a way, their best could be the moody post-punk of "Watching Their Eyes", helped by shy philosophical introspection ("we must be strong 'cause only the strong survive").

The hyperactive electro music-hall Love Lasts Forever added further spontaneity and cynicism, though the masterpiece was probably All For You, a twisted tribute of 60's pop based around ghostly electronic loops, resigned male vocals, angelic female vocals and elegant washes of piano, accordion and saxophone. Another highlight, the electro-jazz Big Man Restless seems like an obvious influence on Tuxedomoon's later work. Finally, the vibrant party vibes of Desert Song (counteracted by wild electronic effects) predate the likes of Frankie Goes to Hollywood et al.

An album that needs to be reevaluated.
