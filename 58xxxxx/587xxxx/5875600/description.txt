Revolted Masses were formed in Spring 2008, while the group took its final form at the end of the same year. Our music approaches the area of extreme metal, without restricting ourselves, with influences from the general rock/metal area and a touch of oriental elements. The lyrics are mainly of a radical political nature. In June 2009 we released our self-titled demo which is our first work. In July of the next year year Foivos Andriopoulos (drums) parted ways with the band. "Seeds of Revolt" is our second release. It is a demo-EP containing an intro, 6 new songs and a cover on "Ace of Spades" (MotÃ¶rhead), and it was released on October 2010.  At the moment, we try to give as many concerts as possible, in order to gain experience being a new band, while a long-range aim is to present a full-length album.
