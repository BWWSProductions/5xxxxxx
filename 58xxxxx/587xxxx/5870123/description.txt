"Instructions"

When an informant claims to have information 
on a codebreaking device that would 
compromise the identities of every agent in 
the CIA, Shaw (Gerald McRaney) sends Steven 
(Boris Kodjoe) and Samantha (Gugu Mbatha-
Raw) to Berlin to verify the mans claims. 
When the informant is killed, the duo meets 
with Hoyt (Ben Schwartz) and Leo (Carter 
MacIntyre) to check out the allegations. As 
the team travels throughout the city, they 
are surprised to learn that the device isnt 
as it seems. Amidst the danger around them, 
Steven and Samantha struggle to find the 
balance between being partners and husband 
and wife while out in the field. Back in 
Los Angeles, Lizzy (Mekia Cox) connects 
with a man while catering his fathers 
funeral.

Enjoy :)
