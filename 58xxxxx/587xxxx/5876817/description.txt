Death to Digital E. T.! Long live Puppet E. T.! 

This is the real thing: the movie Blockbuster, Netflix, and a hundred torrents didn't value you enough to let you see! This is the original 1982 version of E. T.: The Extra-Terrestrial. Government agents carry guns, Michael isn't allowed to dress as a terrorist, and best of all, NO DIGITAL E. T.! Blockbuster and Netflix were too stupid to carry it. Every torrent maker out there was too stupid to rip it. But this time, we got it right! Ripped straight from the 2-disc Collector's Edition, in its full uncompressed glory, here is the original E. T.!
