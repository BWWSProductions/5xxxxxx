The far-reaching programme of original material, spirituals, folk songs, hymns, standards, love songs and protest songs on this double album, is in part Charles Lloydâ€™s response to the cataclysmic events of last September. The veteran saxophonist had been due to open at the Blue Note in New York on Tuesday, September 11th. Compassionate, sorrowful, hopeful, â€œLift Every Voiceâ€ is a major statement, with strong playing by all band members including pianist Geri Allen, making her ECM debut.
