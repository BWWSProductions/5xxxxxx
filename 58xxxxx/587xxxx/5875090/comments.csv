,tapas2357,2011-11-26T17:44Z,"Currently I am only the seeder and 23 leechers. Why don't people seed after downloading there torrent. I saw 3 people downloaded upto 100%, but after that they stop seeding. 

The original uploader is not seeding I think but the torrent exists 100% in network so I was able to download it, if some of packet misses then nobody will can download it and it will be a dead torrent.

So guys please seed. It is a good torrent."
