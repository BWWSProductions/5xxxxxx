Big B is a 2007 superhit Malayalam action film co-written and directed by Amal Neerad, starring Mammootty in the title role. It was widely acclaimed for its cinematography, with its intense fight sequences, well-choreographed shootout scenes and peppy background music. An excellent revenge tale with well packed action and strong story. This movie is a remake of the english US film Four Brothers starring Mark Wahlberg.
