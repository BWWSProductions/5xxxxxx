if you go online with this game i believe you need to purchase an online code.though you should be able to access online features for 7 day trial.after that a code is needed which will set you back 800ms points,if you have a copy that was bought new the code is on the back of the manual.im pretty sure thats the case.so if anyone could let me know cheers"
