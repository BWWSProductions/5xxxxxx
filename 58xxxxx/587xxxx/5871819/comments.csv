,tix666,2010-10-09T18:19Z,"before you install! The game appears to block your computers access to any 2kSports web content, including www.2ksports.com (so you can't even view the website in IE or Firefox).

What this means is that if you have any legit 2K games installed, they WILL NOT WORK ONLINE! Mine are all f'd. Does anyone know how to undo this??? "
