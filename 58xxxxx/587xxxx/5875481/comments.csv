I'm looking for:

,Maurox,2011-05-01T01:22Z,"Is that the 1.2 installer? (with additional models like FAC or CSAR)

Or is it the earlier version?"
,Maurox,2011-05-01T15:52Z,"To answer my own question:
It's the earlier version."
,fustrun,2011-08-17T21:52Z,"Guys i'm desperate for a new upload of the A-10 ! version 1.20, it has awesome new features that makes this version look really bad, if anyone who bought the original product would re-download the installer from the retailer and upload the new installer version ? we can't update this version since it's 1.00. I would be forever in debt thank you !"
