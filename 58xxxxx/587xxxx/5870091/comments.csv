However, having read the book and seen these videos I am utterly unconvinced that he is doing anything more than pushing religion though pseudo-science.

If you are truly interested, read Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne then watch this. Many of the claims in this rely on the viewers incorrect understanding of evolution. I assure you this will not be a convincing argument after you've read the aforementioned book."
