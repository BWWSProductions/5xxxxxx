Carole King\'s \"Music\" is not an overlooked masterpiece (it sold over four million copies upon
its release), but certainly one which has been forgotten over the years. Perhaps too closely
released on the heels of \"Tapestry\", \"Music\" has certainly been overshadowed by that
previous trademark, landmark work.

With \"Music\", King experiments with some new sounds and styles, such as the R & B track
\"Brother, Brother\" which opens the album with a sound reminiscent of the tune \"What\'s Going
On?\" The title track is a truly uplifting jazz waltz with an incredible sax improvisation as a
centerpiece.

The simplicity and honesty of \"It\'s Going To Take Some Time\" is stunning and certainly
surpasses The Carpenter\'s more orchestrated version of the tune during the same year.
Throughout \"Music\", she effectively utilizes a pair of strong female backup vocalists who
strengthen King\'s own delivery of her material and who bring a richness and soulfulness to
tunes such as \"Growing Away From Me\" and the Goffin/King standard \"Some Kind of
Wonderful.\"

If this album had received as much press and airplay through the years as \"Tapestry\" did,
tunes like \"Song of Long Ago\" (with background vocals courtesy of James Taylor) and \"Carry
Your Load\" would now be instant classics. As it is \"Sweet Seasons\" is the only top-10 single
from the album and the only one most people would be likely to recall.
Over all, \"Music\" does not have the musical cohesiveness of her next two projects \"Rhymes &
Reasons\" and \"Fantasy\", but song for song it certainly contains some of the best material she
has ever recorded. Like Tapestry....a classic!
