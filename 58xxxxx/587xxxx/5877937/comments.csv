I'm able to start the game. I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. However, I can't get past the MS Live screen. What am I supposed to do here? In previous titles there was an option to play the game in some form of offline mode. Can't say that I can find that here. 

Any suggestions?"

,t3chyo,2010-10-13T00:14Z,"I've had no problem running this game on windows 7 64bit!

Thanks SKIDROW!

One problem I did run into is when you open the launcher.exe and try to run the game in DX11 it'll load but then the game will close itself without an error.

BUT what I found out to fix this and to run the game in DX11 is to run click the launcher.exe file and click ""run as administrator..."" and now the game will load find when you play.

I did notice a weird effect on the sides of the screen in dx11(not sure if that's the problem) when you look left and right fast.  

BUT i turned off motion blur effect and it was gone.  Not sure if turning motion blur effect back on will make it work ok again, didn't try that."
,DimaFunk,2010-10-13T02:03Z,"I can confirm this works perfectly.
Install Notes:
-Install Game ( I downloaded in about 12 hours )
-After Install go to the redist folder located on the first iso
-Run DXSETUP.exe( took me 40 mins so be patient ) and GFLIVESETUP.exe
-Download the Retail Launcher ( just search Lost Planet 2 ) 
-Play! ( DirectX9 not sure about 11)

"
,t3chyo,2010-10-13T05:27Z,"ALSO to anyone trying to figure out how to create a WINDOWS LIVE offline account so you can actually save these games.

What I found out is when you're in the game and it brings up the Windows Live dialog box click Create new live account.

When it shows you the USER AGREEMENT page scroll down and you'll see at the bottom in blue text a link to click that should be something like ""create offline account"" and it'll bring you to make an offline account which is veryy fast to do and you're off to saving your game!"

read both of my comments on this torrent.

To play in DX11 right click the launcher.exe file by right clicking it and hit ""run as administrator...""

this should allow you to play in DX11

If not, i'm not sure of the problem...

I'm going to keep playing and see if its maybe just that level though.

So, im playing this game for 3 days and i can tell you ITS AMAZING ! 

For folks that like GFWLive multiple activations exploit : This game requiries UNIQUE CD-KEY for playing Online ! this key will be activated ONLY ONCE and for all the time (well, 'till GFWL service will die)
So (for those who didnt got it) u CAN NOT activate this game by putting Gears of War (PC) key! You need to BUY this game in order to play online.

As for my opinion playing offline cool too, cuz u've got unlocking stuff, and this stuff  has different abilities, also game includes bot match, so u can play multiplayer maps with bots.

P.S. after 4 hours of gameplay i was no doubt that i will buy this game in future.

...
I have looked & looked on line & cant find any reference to the fact that SEEDING is any more dangerous that actually DOWNLOADING or LEECHING a torrent...(in regards to ""getting caught"")
...
Why are so many people afraid of SEEDING? Seriously, like, seriously.  What the hell is the problem with seeding a torrent after you've DL'd it?  Do people think that there is more risk of THE MAN finding out? or is it some other reason.  I simply don't understand why it's so hard to just leave it running for a few days."

what the fuck do you think leechers are?
we're all leechers until we've completed the download and become seeds.
leechers are just people in the process of dl'ing, seeds have finished the dl and are ul'ing the complete files.
and people shut the fuck up about seeding, its the desperate ones that spam seed seed seed that are the ones that dont seed and even worse disable or heavilly cap their upload rate whilst downloading cus they're so fuckin desperate to finish they think it will make their dl speed a bit faster. 
if theres 5000 leechers and most of you disable or cap ya upload speed then ya not sharing the parts of the files you've already dl'd and it slows the chain. its not all about seeds, its peer2peer, we're all downloading different parts of the files and uploading the parts we already have at the same time for others who need them.
keep your dl and ul speed set to unlimited and you wouldnt have these problems, it would work as its supposed too and you'd get high speed. as long as theres seeds uploading the complete files we're cool, you can dl the whole torrent without being connected to a seed by taking parts that you need from other leechers, you get the torrent in random packets that are not in order so you could have the last part of the torrent but only have 30% of the total torrent.
KEEP YOUR UL AND DL SET TO UNLIMITED.

,OneHitGamer,2010-11-16T18:20Z,"For those of you who cannot figure out how to create an offline profile:

Go to CREATE NEW PROFILE, on the USER AGREEMENT screen, DO NOT press NEXT. instead, scroll down to the bottom and in the LAST PARAGRAPH you will see a blue link label'd ""CREATE OFFLINE PROFILE. click that. done.

Now you have an offline profile and can save your game progress. this is why some of you cannot load your save, cuzz it didnt exist lol.
