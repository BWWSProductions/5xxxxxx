,jmbmhs,2010-10-07T02:37Z,I uploaded this torrent previously in a different manner. That time for some reason I could not seed for long. This time I shall be seeding for a month from now. Others are requested to seed as long as possible. I shall be seeding at full speed on a 2 mbps line from 2 to 8 am Indian standard time. 8 am  to 2 am the speed will be a bit slow :(

ALL THESE CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM THE INTERNET BUT SEPARATELY.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE ALL AT ONE PLACE.
I TRIED TO UPLOAD THEM AS SEPARATE FOLDERS IN ONE TORRENT.
BUT uTORRENT REFUSED. HOWEVER, IT WON'T BE WASTE OF TIME IF
DOWNLOADED. AS USUAL I WILL BE SEEDING AT FULL SPEED 
FROM 2 TO 8 am INDIAN STANDARD TIME.AT OTHER TIMES IT WILL BE SLOWER.


HERE IS THE LIST.

,jmbmhs,2010-10-07T18:53Z,"hey djjlicious, I am not responsible for others refusing to seed. Since I don't have much space in my 80 GB HDD, I can't afford keeping one torrent for life. Better ask others (in the previous torrent you saw 3 of them not seeding any more) to seed at least for a week or two and you will find at least 50 seeders. For the last torrent I uploaded more than 1.5 GB for a torrent of 741 MB size. For PramodSharma - I asked you to download the text file first. Achmed2007 downloaded it and added in his comment(Thanks Achmed2007). Moreover this time it is possible to download files seperately."
