i agree 100% thanks for making this"

My tribute to a great film, a great novel, a great piece of Americana and a more-than-ever relevant critique and satire of a culture in demise.

A culture in decline indeed.  It looks even worse from this side of the border!  If only the weather up there were warmer I'd become an expatriate.  

The way things are going with climate change time is on my side.  :)"
