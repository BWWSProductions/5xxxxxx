American Psycho - Fan Made Soundtrack [FLAC/MP3] - insinuendo


As I personally found the OST released by Koch entitled: American Psycho: Music From The Controversial Motion Picture, composed and compiled by John Cale, lacked the very essence of the original tracks found to be part of the motion picture, I decided to compile a soundtrack of my own inspired by the movie and the period it represents.

The main reason behind releasing the Koch compilation without the essential elements found in the movie were copyright restrictions as one can find out by doing a bit of research.

The soundtrack for the film was scored by John Cale, with artists such as David Bowie, The Cure, and New Order. 

Prior to the start of principal photography, Whitney Houston refused to allow the use of her performance of the song "The Greatest Love of All" in the film and 
was replaced by an easy-listening orchestrated version.

Huey Lewis and the News' "Hip to Be Square" was originally on the soundtrack album, but shortly after it was released, the CD was pulled from the shelves and the song was removed before being reissued, but a small number had already been sold. Reports suggested that Huey Lewis had objected to the context in which his song was used in the film and demanded it be removed from the CD.

In reality, there was no objection over the context. Although the film's production team had paid for the rights to use the song in the film, the rights to include it on the soundtrack were overlooked. When the soundtrack was released with the song on it, Huey Lewis had it withdrawn, as the soundtrack rights had not been secured.
