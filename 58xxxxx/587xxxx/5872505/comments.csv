,vincentdesrd,2010-10-08T04:03Z,Thanks for the upload but why not surround???
,qman99,2010-10-08T15:51Z,"because it isn't recorded in surround sound, that would require 5 people with microphones wherever karl goes!"
,vincentdesrd,2010-10-09T01:41Z,"If you listen to the other episodes in surround it's enhanced so that the music and ambient sounds, crowds, voices are in surround.

It's somewhat fake surround I agree but it still works."
,vincentdesrd,2010-10-09T01:43Z,What I'm wondering is why are the DaveUK releases in surround sound but this one is in stereo?
,ztrust,2010-10-09T04:14Z,dont bother this jumps every 5 seconds
,Tech.Junkie.V2,2010-10-09T23:09Z,"Wait for DaveUK version, this one sucks a fat cunt."
,Alan1996,2010-10-11T05:29Z,"its only skipping 5 secs for you because your using windows media player, dwnload vlc.

it works perfectly by the way if anyone was offputed by the comments"
