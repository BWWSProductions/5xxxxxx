PES 2011 DRUMMER'S DREAM MUSIC PATCH ( Dave Weckl, Dennis Chambers...)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a modified dt02.img file that includes the best of the best of the amazing, one and only kick ass american drummer Dave Weckl. Also there are some tracks of Dennis Chambers but essentially this for me the finest of Dave. Two tracks of the Innovators are included. PES 2011 menu gets alive with vibrant outstanding jazz fusion music that will just simply blow your mind. 

Instructions:

Unrar dt02.rar file

Backup your original dt02.img file that is inside \Program Files (x86)\Konami\img

and replace / overwrite it with this one. 

Be prepared to be blown away. 

I have no idea though how to change the names of the songs as I found it very difficult to do it (Hex editing) . Please if someone knows how to do it (change the name of the songs inside the game) please let me know. Also, you will notice that I left 5 songs that I found the best of the original soundtrack.

Enjoy. Please be patient 'cause my upload speed is not very good.
