Hey everyone ~ 

This is just a small little program i wrote using Visual Basic 2008.

Pretty simple to operate, it basically just encrypts any text that u want hidden,
It encrypts it with a password that you can set yourself, the text cannot be decrypted without the use of your password =] 

All the help and instructions to use this simple program are located in the program itself, just simply click the . i . button, located near the bottom right hand corner~

Enjoy ^^
