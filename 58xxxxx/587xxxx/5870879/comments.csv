,exodus67,2010-10-28T16:24Z,Why do people rate it 10 for audio and video when it clearly isn't? Or are they saying compared to other R5s it is very good?
,cinopher,2010-10-30T01:58Z,"@exodus67

To me it seems like many rate every release 10/10 unless it's really messed up or a cam version.
Maybe it's because they are used to the quality of standard scene DVD rips (~700mb) or maybe some of them are actually rating them by comparing to the average quality of, say, R5's. Although I do doubt that... Plus I'd imagine that it'd be more helpful to people who aren't familiar with the release types of movies (cam, telesync, telecine, r5, dvdrip etc) to rate'em by comparing them to, for example, brrips. Although it looks like most of the peeps are still watching standard scene or p2p dvdrips, which are no where near the quality of, say, 720p blueray rips so maybe don't even know how good they can be, hence inaccurate ratings.
On the other hand, for those who are familiar with release types, A/V bit rates etc I guess it'd be a little more helpful if they were compared to releases of the same type."
