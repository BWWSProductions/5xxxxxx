d.Self.torrent is a bit torrent video art piece, it\'s a digital self portrait driven by the audio.  The video is a clip of the scars on my body that I\'ve damaged and altered by artificial and hardware methods.

The corruption of the video is my digital representation of how Iâ€™ve been changed from physical perfection to an imperfection.  The audio is pulled from the video to produce a composition that is imprinted over a audio wave with my name.  The visuals have then been extended from 15 seconds to over an hour to visualize the permanence of my disability.

The use of torrent gives a little bit of myself to everyone allowing me to finally accept my disability and share it.
