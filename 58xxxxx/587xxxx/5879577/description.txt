Tools To Mod Your PS3 (Backups + Homebrew)

1-USB Programming Software
2-Program this on your USB Development Board
3-PS3 Backup Manager (install using your programmed USB)
FAQ.nfo

NOTE : You Need A USB Development Board Or An AT90USB and related microcontrollers

THIS WILL NOT WORK ON A USB STICK OR THUMB DRIVE ETC!!

Included PSGroove (backup enabled version)
PS3 Backup Manager
A couple Of USB Programming Tools..

Please dont take this as gospel I have uploaded this to spread the files , my FAQ isnt the best lol


1- Program your USB Microcontroller or USB Development Board with PSGroove.hex (some apps for teeny boards are included)
2- Once programmed add the PS3 Backup Manager or any homebrew or apps and install it once on PSGroove
*To use this exploit:

â€¢Hard power cycle your PS3 (using the switch in back, or unplug it)
â€¢Plug the dongle into your PS3.
â€¢Press the PS3 power button, followed quickly by the eject button.
After a few seconds, the first LED on your dongle should light up. After about 5 seconds, the second LED will light up (or the LED will just go off, if you only have one). This means the exploit worked! You can see the new "Install Package Files" menu option in the game menu.

Notes
A programmed dongle won't enumerate properly on a PC, so don't worry about that.



These files will help you to enable your PS3 to use Homebrew AND Backups

YOU MUST HAVE A USB DEVELOPMENT BOARD OR AN AT90USBKEY!! NOT A USB THUMB DRIVE ETC!!

This is the PSGroove, an open-source reimplementation of the psjailbreak exploit for AT90USB and related microcontrollers.

It should work on:

â€¢AT90USB162
â€¢AT90USB646
â€¢AT90USB647
â€¢AT90USB1286
â€¢AT90USB1287
â€¢ATMEGA32U4

You Can also Use Teensy++ USB Development Boards

There is also hope of a PSP Option (install this from a hacked PSP for free!!)

PSGroove
This is the PSGroove, an open-source reimplementation of the psjailbreak exploit for AT90USB and related microcontrollers.

It should work on:

â€¢AT90USB162
â€¢AT90USB646
â€¢AT90USB647
â€¢AT90USB1286
â€¢AT90USB1287
â€¢ATMEGA32U4
... and maybe more.


This software is intended to allow the execution of unsigned third-party apps and games on the PS3.

Cloning
The repository uses the LUFA library as a submodule. To clone, use something like:

git clone git://github.com/psgroove/psgroove.git
cd psgroove
git submodule init
git submodule update
Configuring
Chip and board selection can usually be handled in the Makefile. In particular, update the MCU, BOARD, and F_CPU lines. Suggested values:

Teensy 1.0:

MCU = at90usb162
BOARD = TEENSY
F_CLOCK = 16000000
Teensy++ 1.0:

MCU = at90usb646
BOARD = TEENSY
F_CLOCK = 16000000
Teensy 2.0:

MCU = atmega32u4
BOARD = TEENSY
F_CLOCK = 16000000
Teensy++ 2.0:

MCU = at90usb1286
BOARD = TEENSY
F_CLOCK = 16000000
AT90USBKEY / AT90USBKEY2:

MCU = at90usb1287
BOARD = USBKEY
F_CLOCK = 8000000
Board-specific notes
Teensy boards only have one LED, so it will turn off when the exploit succeeds rather than turn green. Older Teensy 1.0 boards also have the polarity inverted. In general, a LED should do something when the board is powered, and do something different when the exploit works.

Building
On Linux, use the AVR GCC toolchain (Debian/Ubuntu package: gcc-avr). On Windows, WinAVR should do the trick.

make clean
make
Programming
Now program psgroove.hex into your board and you're ready to go. For the AT90USBKEY and other chips with a DFU bootloader preinstalled, you can get the dfu-programmer tool, put your board in programming mode, and run

make dfu
For the Teensy boards, you probably have to use the Teensy Loader software.

Using
To use this exploit:

â€¢Hard power cycle your PS3 (using the switch in back, or unplug it)
â€¢Plug the dongle into your PS3.
â€¢Press the PS3 power button, followed quickly by the eject button.
After a few seconds, the first LED on your dongle should light up. After about 5 seconds, the second LED will light up (or the LED will just go off, if you only have one). This means the exploit worked! You can see the new "Install Package Files" menu option in the game menu.

Notes
A programmed dongle won't enumerate properly on a PC, so don't worry about that.
