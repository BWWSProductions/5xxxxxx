I've been reading up on the mod steps and would like to go about the operation without spending any money, let me know if you have any ideas."

Your a bum, and spend some fucking money to buy the necessary modding hardware, cuz ounce you have it and do the steps the RIGHT way you will always have the tools. If you get good enough you can start modding other peoples, before long the hardware will pay itself off. "
