About this game:
On the hostile planet of Nu Earth, there are tales of a lone warrior. A man who appears out of thin air to take out whole platoons, then disappears back into the shadows. In the centre of a futile war, one man can swing the balance: the ultimate soldier and last survivor of the massacred Genetic Infantrymen, hell-bent on revenge ... the Rogue Trooper. Based on the 2000AD comic series, Rogue Trooper, Rogue Trooper blends intense third person action and next generation stealth. Rogue's arsenal offers him a unique advantage over his opponents; encoded bio-chips containing the digitized personalities of his fallen comrades are implanted in his gun (Gunnar), helmet (Helm) and backpack (Bagman). Rogue Trooper features intense online gameplay modes, where gamers can experience up to four-player co-operative gameplay in all new maps.
