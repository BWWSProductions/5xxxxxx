,younggod,2010-10-12T12:02Z,"I have no idea why it stuck there at 99.8%. I've had a file re-check itself at 99.8% and then go into download, for some reason, and  finish, and start seeding but this is the first time I've had this happen to me. It won't re-check itself up to 100%. I've had shit connections with piratebay lately too. I did a md5 check and it stated no errors too, there are no hash fails, and the file plays fine and I did a test burn and it went well. The last video on there, is Between The Eyes. If you guys have that complete,you have the whole thing and it'll be fine,because my torrent client's re-check states. 99.8 percent as well. Tell you what, if you people have problems with your file(just bear with me) I'll do a new one. I just don't want to waste my time and effort making a new one and have this happen all over again."
