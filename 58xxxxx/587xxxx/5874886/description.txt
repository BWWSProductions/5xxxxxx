Amon Duul II Live 1969-1975

Here's a nice collection of live studio and concert performances spanning the years 1969-1975. First up, is an appearance on the "Phonzeit tv program in 1975, on January,18th with timecode. There are discussion segments as indicated in the running order notes,which cut into the songs,and be forewarned: German language, and no subtitles. However, I have included an un-cut Surrounded By The Stars from the show. That's the only one available though.   
Following that, is a collection of various live concert and studio performances(look closely and you'll spot David Gilmour!) including the aforementioned un-cut Surrounded By The Stars. All in all, great audio and visual quality and a real keeper for the heavy Amon Duul II fan. Thanks goes to Olvator at Dimeadozen, for the Phonzeit torrent.
