Victor Victoria is a most favorite of my movies personally in that I find
it does wonders for the spirit to have Julie Andrews and Robert Preston
repartee as they do in situations that certainly do serve as inspiration
to loftier attempts to articulate with clever wit, and with intelligence
that is as I say, in great sprit, I say!

The "restaurant scene" is unforgettable and a "tour de force"
around the Hollywood sets when you consider their more recent exploits
at the box office, by comparison.

We will soon have an HD DivX widescreen 2GB version for all to share, however it will be produced from the (five minutes longer) NTSC rendition - for which
we lack Dutch subtitles - in fact we had no Dutch subtitles for even the PAL version
on the disc and had to source them elsewhere on the Internet where they are to be
found - thank goodness! 

we ask for your seeding support for French language constituents
Merci! Michael Rizzo Chessman

(Use full screen mode when using Windows media player - subtitles have the right
positioning for this too)
