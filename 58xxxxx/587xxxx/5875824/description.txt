PLOT:

Released hot on the heels of The Expendables, this latest vehicle for former wrestling star Steve Austin features three of the cast members from the aforementioned action spectacular.

Here Austin plays Jim Rhodes, a border patrol agent who spent most of career patrolling the dangerous borders of Texas and Mexico, but has relocated to the mountains of Montana and the seemingly less dangerous border between the picturesque state and Canada.

If you\'re reading this, chances are that you\'re a fan of this type of film and I would say that this is definitely worth a look. It\'s got a fairly low body count and it\'s quite predictable, but it\'s an entertaining straight-to-video action film that\'s worth watching for the showdown between Austin and Daniels alone.
