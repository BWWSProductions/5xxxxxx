great job as always [eztv]!

@Hiccup.Master:

too much Q_Q

go kill yourself. you and all the other trolls that complain about mb, gb, timing, and txt files can go shove a dildo down each other's throats.

seriously, invite all of your troll friends over for dinner, lock the door, mix up a 2 gallon bowl of bleach and ammonia, and breathe deeply. you won't be missed.

have a great day! (:
