Synopis: In Argentina over 8,000 people die in traffic accidents every year. Behind each of these tragedies is a flourishing industry founded on insurance payouts and legal loopholes. Sosa is a lawyer who tours the A&E Departments of the public hospitals and the police stations in search of potential clients. LujÃ¡n is a young doctor recently arrived from the provinces. Their love story kicks off one night when LujÃ¡n and Sosa meet in the street. She's trying to save a man's life; he wants him on his client portfolio. (IMDB)
