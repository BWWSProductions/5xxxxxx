                    Abuse of Trust.                          
                    A brand new series of Taggart, exclusive to  
                    STV. When shipworkers' union leader Will Ramsay  
                    is shot dead in the middle of a labour dispute,  
                    corporate killing seems the most likely cause.  
                    But the real motivations lie much closer to  
                    home.
