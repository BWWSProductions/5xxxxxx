THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE (4TH branch of govn) and how it is being used...

Dr. Carley interviews Ralph Winterrowd on the Administrative State. Very Interesting.


Ralph Kermit Winterrowd was raised on a farm in South-eastern Kansas. He belonged to the IBEW Union (Denver and Alaska), Utility Workers of America Union (Wyoming) and Teamsters Union (Alaska) with classifications as a substation electrician, power plant electrician and communications tech. Winterrowd has worked on the Alyeska Pipeline as a lead communication tech from Prudhoe Bay to the Valdez Terminal He started his own telephone interconnect in 1985 and became the largest privately held company in this field in Alaska grossing over 2 million per year and growing. After having over 7 million added to a sealed bid of a competitor, and taking this to the Supreme Court of Alaska and the justices of that court refusing to acknowledge this unlawful action, he began researching out what were the real problems in our constitutional Republic. He ran for governor of Alaska, talked to many, many legislative members and filed cases in the Alaska and Federal courts finally determining the tyranny was entrenched in all parts of the government from top to bottom that would shock the conscience. He worked with on IRS issues with Dan Meador, now deceased; and the absence of the constitution Republic, the absence of the citizens of the several States, traffic issues, driver license issues and rise of the Administrative State. He currently researches IRS, criminal law, child custody and the demise of the constitutional Republic. This research has cost him his company (2001) and his marriage (wife and him are still great friends, but stress way to much). Only the truth will save our Republic that hangs by a thread today, but unfortunately most people are compliant and complacent.
