PUMZI, takes place in a dystopian future where humanity has been forced to live underground as a result of World War III and the destruction of the environment, so-named the Water Wars in the film. A young woman, Asha, played by Kudzani Moswela  works as a museum curator, in service to a council called the Maitu. After receiving a mysterious box with a soil sample, she eventually discovers that it contains no radioactivity and is fertile enough to support life. She soon decides to apply for a pass to go above ground to search for the source and possibly more non-radioactive areas. This monumental discover, however is not taken too seriously and is treated rather threateningly by the council and they â€œadviseâ€ her to send in the sample and to disregard her discovery. Asha however is not convinced this is the correct thing to do, especially in light of her consistent dreams of life blossoming on the surface of the planet. After being taken into custody for disregarding the command to turn in the soil sample and plant, she escapes to the surface where she eventually faces a tough decision on how to support the life of the little plant.
