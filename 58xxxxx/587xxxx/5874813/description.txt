They are best known for their 1971 hit "Mammy Blue", referring to a son's poignant song addressed to his departed mother about his childhood memories and life in general, sometimes spelled "Mommy Blue" or "Mamy Blue", or misspelled as "Mummy Blue", which was a Top 10 hit throughout much of Europe, Japan (#2), and Canada (#42), and a minor Billboard Hot 100 chart hit in the United States (#57) as well. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. It was covered by many singers.The most famous recordings are the ones by Roger Whittaker, Horace Andy, Demis Roussos, Stories and  Oak Island Treasury Department. The song has been popular in other languages as well It was done in Spanish by JosÃ© MercÃ©, in Italian by Dalida, in German by Ricky Shayne and in Finnish by Kirka Babitzin.The composer of the song "Mammy Blue" is Frenchman Hubert Giraud.
