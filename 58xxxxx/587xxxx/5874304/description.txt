_______________________________________________________

Out of the Silent Planet is the debut release from King's X. The title of 
the album comes from the title of a book of the same name by C.S. Lewis, 
an author favored by band members Ty Tabor and Jerry Gaskill.

King's X came roaring out of Houston, TX with a progressive metal sound 
that was a cross between Black Sabbath, Metallica, and Rush with layered 
vocals harmonies that some have dubbed Beatle-esque. 

The band is a critics favorite as well as a favorite of musicians, they 
had big label backing for years and even played Woodstock '94, yet somehow 
they never seemed to break it big in the mainstream.
