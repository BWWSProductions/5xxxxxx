AUDIO:Piranji.2D.3D.2010.D.DVD.ELEKTRI4KA...............Thanks m8 ;-)

Right here's our normal rip now... Main issues on the r5 source was too dark and too strong on the colours. So once more we made a small script containing brightness, sharpness, white balance, rgb eq, contrast... and dropped it in vdub and ripped the dvdr. The audio was just demuxed off the dvdr and then muxed to our encode.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
