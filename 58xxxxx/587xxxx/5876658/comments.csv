With TPB being abit iffy I think allot of uploaders went elsewhere. Why is 'elsewhere' is my question? Having checked out a number of other torrent sites my overall impression is that TPB is truly the best format around.

I'll seed for a few days & thanks again!"

,Awesomo42,2010-10-17T10:07Z,"Haha, yeah. I'm pretty sure many of them are migrating to private trackers. For people like me however with crappy upload speeds, private trackers are mostly impractical since the upload wouldn't be able to keep up with my download speed, and imbalance the Download to Upload ratio. Personally private sites are a backup plan, TPB comes first."
