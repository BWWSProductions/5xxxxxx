Darksiders PC save game Apocalyptic difficulty:


save slot 3: near the start where you meet Vulgrim for the first time. The sword and scythe levels are maxed (makes them very powerful). Also a large amount of souls (money) that will last you through the end of the game.

save slot 8: at the very beginning of the game with a full Abyssal Armor set. Basically a fresh legit game with the Armor unlocked.
