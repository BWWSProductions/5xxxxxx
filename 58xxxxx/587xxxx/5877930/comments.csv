A bit reality-tv mentality which I don't like but what ever. Entertained me most of all releases this year. Well I don't watch many, that's my secret why I can appreciate things :-) V:9, A:10, M:9"

,TheSourMango,2010-12-14T15:36Z,"Thank you once again FXG for a great upload!
This movie might be worth watchin in HD (I did).

Cool effects, and a cool idea. The movie was still really a dissapointment. I watched it in 1080p with all the light out, but it still felt like a really slow and kinda boring movie. Does not deserve the genre ""Thriller""."
,botchog,2010-12-22T05:27Z,i recommend this movie to all. thank you FXG_team!

There is NO sync problem. IF you're having synch trouble, time to look for a new machine. Or run less crap while watching movies.

Tired of people ripping at all when there is NO problem with the gear."
