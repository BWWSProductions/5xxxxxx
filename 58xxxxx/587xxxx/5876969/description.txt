[b]Vampirella returns in Vampirella: The Second Coming, a game changing, four-issue miniseries that serves as the keystone event of the 40th Anniversary of Vampirella, a year long celebration of this icon of horror. Written by Eisner Award nominee Phil Hester (The Darkness) with art by red-hot newcomer Daniel Sampere, the Second Coming will fundamentally alter Vampirella, her universe and her stories forever.[/b]



Issue #3 more than previous issues seems to put women against men, order versus chaos, love versus hate and good versus evil. This message alone should persuade everyone interested in equality of the sexes to at least take a look at the series and judge by means of story and not judge by the way Vampirella's army dresses! #3 also shows a lot of all-out action which is still supported by a lot of story, contributing to the visuals as well as creating a distance between the visuals and the reader in which the reader is not overwhelmed by the Chaos that is happening.
