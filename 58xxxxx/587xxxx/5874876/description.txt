There is not much information about this film on the web, it is a stop motion film by famous early cinema special effects genius Segundo De chomÃ³n in collaboration with Giovanni Pastrone whom we all know from the great epic Cabiria, it tells the story of a young boy whom is reading letters from his father who is at war only to fall asleep and dream about it in a nice stop motion faction. Segundo de ChomÃ³n most famous films include the Golden Beetle and the Electric Hotel. This was to be Segundo de ChomÃ³n last film as a director.

This is surely not to be missed by any animation lover! The rip runs at 25fps contrary to standart of the time of 18fps so instead of the 37 minutes announced on imdb, which i searched on google and found to be accurate, on 25fps run for 27 minutes, but the film is here complete.
