It's always a joy to hear the Chicago blues when it isn't cut with anything, and this is as pure as it comes. Willie Buck has been leading bands in the city for over forty years and this material was committed for posterity some twenty eight years ago. Passing time hasn't diminished it however and it sounds as uplifting now as it would have done back then. 
The last five tracks were recorded live. What they lack in audio sophistication is more than compensated for by their immediacy and fire. Recorded in Chicago back in 1984 they are in summary further testament to no holds barred blues.
