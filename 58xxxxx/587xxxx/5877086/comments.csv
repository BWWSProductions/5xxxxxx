All my other torrents are fine. I do seed back the penguin episodes so i was wondering what was the problem? Thanks anyway for all your other ones which i have as they are always good A9V9."

Hello, Dollface

or could anyine point me to them? Thanks again"

I never had a problem B4 with this and any other i want to DL is no problem. shame as i really like these, perhaps i'll have to wait for a collection to come out."
