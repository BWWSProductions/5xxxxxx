This is my 1st torrent Iv\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'e created, and i want to contribute to the community so please go easy on me.This is the Heavy Rain theme. It has the falling rain in the background that actually moves, so i taught i could upload it.
To install
Create a folder on a usb device called PS3. Inside the PS3 folder, make another folder call THEME. Inside the THEME folder you put the theme inside and just connect the usb drive to the PS3 and install :)
