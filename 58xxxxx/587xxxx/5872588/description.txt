"The Maggots in the Meathead"

When Booth and Brennan are called to investigate 
decomposed remains found at the Jersey Shore, 
the team IDs the victim as Richie "The V" 
Genaro, a 23-year-old who partied the night 
before at a popular nightclub. Booth and Brennan 
question Genaro's peers and the club bouncer 
(guest star Sabato Jr.), and Brennan 
surprisingly proves her pop culture savvy and 
anthropological expertise after watching what 
she believes to be a documentary on the 
inhabitants of the Jersey Shore, but was in 
actuality a reality show set there. Meanwhile, 
at the lab, the team grows fond of Booth's 
girlfriend, Hannah (guest star Winnick), and 
Angela tries to keep her pregnancy a secret.

Enjoy :)
