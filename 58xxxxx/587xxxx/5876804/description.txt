* STORY : *

* The story takes place back on E.D.N. III 10 years after the events of the first game. The snow has melted to 

reveal jungles and more tropical areas that have taken the place of more frozen regions. The plot begins with 

Mercenaries fighting against Jungle Pirates. After destroying a mine, the Mercenaries continue on to evacuate the 

area, in which a Category-G Akrid appears and attacks them. After being rescued, they find out their evacuation 

point (Where the Category-G appeared) was a set-up and no pick up team awaited them.
The game then shifts to NEVEC's Black Ops, Task Force First Descent, who fight their way through a Carpetbagger 

city in an effort to capture a railway gun, a train mounted with a massive cannon. After failing to succeed, a 

"space Akrid" Appears and begins to attack the group. After it is killed and the members evacuated, it is revealed 

they are clones of Ivan Solotov, a character from Lost Planet: Extreme Condition.
 The story once again shifts, this time to Waysiders, snow pirates living in the desert. They are returning from a 

raid on a carpetbagger city, apparently with heavy casualties and not much Thermal Energy. On the way back home, 

they are ambushed by a Category-G Akrid, dubbed "Red Eye." After loading the remaining Thermal Energy on helicopter 

like VSs, they make their escape, only to be shot down by sandraiders. After stealing a train from the sandraiders, 

the group is ambushed by Carpetbaggers on the railway gun. After seizing control of the gun, they are once again 

attacked by Red Eye, this time they are able to kill it though. As they continue towards their home, it starts 

snowing heavily, burying their home. The player 1 waysider notices a giant, glowing orb in the distance and 

declares "I'm so going to shoot the shit out of you!" and apparently fires at it.
