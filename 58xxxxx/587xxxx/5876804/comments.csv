,lemby911,2010-10-09T23:57Z,"thanks for the up globe are there any addons gonna be released for the game by u? i mean like vids , online components,etc."
[V],globeplus,2010-10-10T00:05Z,THIS IS A GAME THAT NEEDS THE GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE TO MAKE THE SAVES .
[V],globeplus,2010-10-10T00:11Z,"To lemby911 : the videos are perfect , not a single thing to say , i said on the descryption clearly : basic training is available ,  the advanced training not because is relationated to the online feature and you need a valid registered key to play the online , i hope this explain everything ."
,lemby911,2010-10-10T00:35Z,ok thanks for the info will seed after download

,eterglax,2010-10-10T08:11Z,it is something rip??
,h3ll4b0y,2010-10-10T08:48Z,"thanks alot for the up globe!

ps. why arent the seeds updating on TPB? "
,alpha2024,2010-10-10T09:34Z,No direct x 11? It gives me an error when trying to run it in DX11. Yes i have a dx11 card. 
[V],globeplus,2010-10-10T13:14Z,"To alpha2024 : in mthis file the directx11 was removed because after applying the nice worked available executable , the dx11 doesnÂ´t work at all , so whatÂ´s the point leaving an executable that simply doesnÂ´t work , i decided to leave only the perfect working dx9 and my friendly users i have a confess to make at this point in time : executables or games for dx11 is not a good idea , the dx11 still need to improve , the fact is that if you can find improves between dx9 to dx10 and thatÂ´s why the dx10 more appropriate to the latest operative systems , between dx10 and dx11 the video cards canÂ´t show too much progress just only a kind of inocue intention , so in my opinion respecting capcom , i donÂ´t agree with the option to choose as a second executable the dx11 , certainly they got much more users using the 2nd executable with more normality if the option was the dx10 !!! "
[V],globeplus,2010-10-10T13:39Z,"Another thing about the supost directx11 video cards : must be ilegal and absolutly bad if someone is thinking in to force buying expensive video cards just to run the games , 99% of users use normal below to medium range video cards , the simple idea of working games for more appropriated direcx11 video cards completly sucks , i think they are out of this mind if in the future people can only run games buying the latest video cards to play games , one thing is for shore , like this the games company sometimes can get difficulties if they start thinking making games just for appropriate directx11 video cards they can start making the bankrupt of the company because the percentage of possible users  not too much , so the minimum exigible is directx10 for games and even with that the xp operative system users are beeing excluded  , conclusion : i really feel a kind of mad feelings about directx11 that donÂ´t take anywhere , the prudence in a normal progression of a directx must be done correctly and in harmony with what it is plausible to more possible general users ."
[V],globeplus,2010-10-10T13:45Z,"About the directx11 and windows 7 , please take a look on the article at this site :

http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/windows_7_directx_11"
,MP7560,2010-10-10T14:05Z,Thanks! :) we appreciate your effort.
[V],globeplus,2010-10-10T14:24Z,"To finish the directx11 subject , i should say that nvidia and ati need to keep a coorrect conduct following the normal improve on the development in the video cards and that make sense but also thinking in directx 11 more appropriate video cards for acceptable prices , it is not everyone and for example for 2 gb ram laptops that are common that will buy the latest models in directx 11 and to change a video card for a laptop is a tough task , so videos cards with nice acceptables prices with the new directx technologies are more than recommendable because like that they sell more , doesnÂ´t mean that real nice models canÂ´t be available , certainly no problem on that but the incorporation of the new directx for the below and medium range video cards is necessary to be done too , they have to include the new directx in what is possible in the  all the new videoo cards nit thinking exclusively in new expensive models to have the new technologies , i really donÂ´t think that they sell more with that , this directx11 still have work in front and games exclusively for this new directx are highly not recommendable for the moment , the maximum is really as an option but still much more valid the directx 9 or 10 for the generality of the available world wide video cards ."
,fluster84,2010-10-10T15:03Z,"Thank you globe, you saved us a lot of time. This was a very fast upload too, appreciate all your hard work. Downloading now, will post with feedback though I am sure this work fine like your previous games."
[V],globeplus,2010-10-10T15:16Z,"Short comment :  it is unthinkable that only the expensive video cards can have the directx11 because in that case what can happen to a possible a directx 12 ? Not forgetting too all the models of video cards that still selling great on the market and have technologie for directx 10 , the new directx 11 can start be implemented step by step in the video cards but that canÂ´t mean that the games companys must work with the new directx no matter what , still a choice that and they know that the generality of the users still have video cards for directx 10 , thsi things are doing following the normal progress on the improvements on the technologies , not running like hell finding a way to the new things work out !!! Good sense and correct analisys  on this things always a good idea and take time to move the generality of the videos cards to a new directx . Thank you for the comment about the directx11 then i get the opportunuty to say what i think about this subject ."
[V],globeplus,2010-10-10T15:44Z,"This comment is to Capcom :  example : the Devil may Cry 4 that is a Capcom game works great with the x10 executable , more than 90% of the possible users can use it with no problem , what i mean is , the company want to start making the games with new x11 ? nothing against that but having in mind that in this moment in time only a few percentage can use it and even that ones can get problems to use the x11 executable , now you canÂ´t tell me this is a nice solution for everyone ... so the correct evn if you want to include the new x11 is : a x9 executable that you already did , a x10 executable anyway fir the more than 90% of the users out there that have the video cards running great on this directx and finally for the small percentage of x11 direct users the x11 executable , what is really correct to put happy all the possible users ? 3 executables not only 2 , one for x9 , another for x10 and finally a tested one for x11 and no one can denies that this is the correct procedure , not jumping from the x9 to x11 to only a few possible percentage of users !!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-10-10T16:39Z,"another aspect inconsideration is that the capcom normal put more than one executable to the users take the better profit from the available video card and if you think a little bit you canÂ´t find a better reason , now we have 90% of users with directx 10 with normality running great on the video cards and a small percentages with new expensive video cards with x11 incorporated , so for the line of thinking for the users get the best profit possible from the video card presenting more than one exectable the conclusion is very simple : i canÂ´t run the directx11 executable and the generality of the video cards runs great on the directx 10 , so if i have a x11 that donÂ´t work then a x9 executable the user certainly not taking the best profit to play the game in the best way possible because he have the x10 running great and his forced to use the x9 executable because the x11 donÂ´t work !!!"
,fluster84,2010-10-10T16:58Z,"Speeds are very slow.. Please people uncap your uploads, let the love flow :P"
[V],globeplus,2010-10-10T18:05Z,"I have to be fair making the correct analysis and beside that i recognise without any doubt that skidrow do normaly a great work , for this one i donÂ´t really recommend because the x11 still not working and at the menu no language options included , thex9 go ok but that is normal , so the included launcher executable still beeing the more appropriate because runs the x9 but also have the multi-9 languages option at the launcher menu , so have an extra feature that the other donÂ´t have beside that our friend x11 executable still not working anyway no matter what . Enjoy your game and the included executable launcher still valid no doubt ."

1. RESTART THE PC.

2.NOW EXTRACT WITH FREE ARC

3.RESTART THE PC AGAIN

4.NOW USE GLOBECONVERTER.EXE

5.GAME WILL TAKE 45 MINUTES ON CORE 2 DUO WITH GOOD RAM

,truthy,2010-11-07T14:28Z,thx for sharing
,truthy,2010-11-07T14:35Z,"thx great rip - worked perfectly (win7 32bit). make sure to select english in the launcher language menu, otherwise it'll be in russian (no reinstall or other crap required)

I managed to patch your rip to v1.0.1.129 with the update from Skridrow (ddl links can be found on the SceneReleases homepage)

in order for that to work you'll need the registry entries; new textfile copy/paste, rename *.txt to *.reg: (change your path/install dir accordingly in the regfile but keep the \\ )

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\CAPCOM\LOSTPLANET 2]
""InstallDir""=""D:\\Games\\Lost Planet 2""
""GUID""=""{737369DC-08E8-4787-A78C-F86943247BDF}""
""Language""=""1033""
""launch""=dword:00000000

language is set to english. afterwards you can apply the update & skidrow crack. there is a dx11 exe included in the crack - can't test it though my GTX 285 doesn't support dx11. from the screens/videos I've seen I doubt it would look noticeably better anyway."
,truthy,2010-11-09T06:37Z,"puh I'm half way through (episode 3) and already bored to the teeth. 

the update didn't change the save-checkpoints. if you quit manually you'll have to play the whole chapter all over again - wtf? searching for these stupid markers so that you get a small portion of a minimap through the entire game also sucks big time. I didn't expect much, but having to play all these boring missions all over again ... I don't think so; better to delete it from my harddrive."
