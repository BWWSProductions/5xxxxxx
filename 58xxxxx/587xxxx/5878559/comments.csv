,chazzee23,2011-01-04T06:36Z,good man! or girl! thank u!
,spiff_pow,2011-01-06T11:29Z,"Awesome! 
FÃ¶rsta Ã¤r Theatrical och de Ã¶vriga Ã¤r Special Eidition, det Ã¤r precis sÃ¥ jag ocksÃ¥ hade gjort. Den fÃ¶rlÃ¤ngda versionen av den fÃ¶rsta filmen Ã¤r  inte sÃ¥ bra eftersom man fÃ¥r se nÃ¥gon gÃ¥ runt i en gummidirekt och sÃ¥ sÃ¤ger alla ""men man hade inte sÃ¥ bra effekter pÃ¥ den tiden"", om de inte har sÃ¥ bra effekter sÃ¥ kan de ju lÃ¥ta bli att ha med scener som ser ut som skit. "
,spiff_pow,2011-01-06T11:40Z,"jag ser nu att det står fel i beskrivningen, det är Directors.Cut versionen och inte Theatrical versionen av Alien. "
[V],FiNEHD,2011-01-18T17:07Z,Alien = DC
,ukbull83,2011-01-30T21:04Z,it took me  over 3 weeks of downloading for this and its got commentry over all films.

,pairitbei,2011-04-04T16:50Z,"You can select which audio track to use. The normal audio, or the commentary audio."

,bloodfamily,2011-04-27T17:20Z,"Please! SEED! for the love of GOD! stopped at 40.6% using flashget,  "
,dlectro,2011-04-28T11:28Z,"Alien and Aliens are the special editions, i don't know which of the other two is the theatrical.
The included srt subs are apparently russian, i don't know what's the need for them..."
,ked193,2011-06-24T12:53Z,"good download speed, great quality, but english subs would be helpful a bit... ;p"
,sjw71,2011-07-14T01:06Z,"Man I got all four movies corrupted after 45GB :(

Trying again!

Not torrents fault, probably because I had it downloading to storage drive..."
,sjw71,2011-07-20T10:55Z,"Not enough seeds, too slow.
Don't bother unless you're prepared to download for 4 weeks."
,euphoria4949,2011-07-23T19:43Z,"** Superb quality - 100% WORTH DL'ing **

I absolutely luv these movies, they scared the shit out of me when I was growing up :)
""Ok Resurrection not so much :-\"", that movie kind of spoiled the legacy in my opinion, but hey, it's just wicked to finally watch them in 1080p.

Ok this torrent only has 60/70 seeds now and 300+ leeches which isn't brilliant, ""but"", it still averaged around 500KB/s for me which isn't bad considering. And my connection is only 16Mb/s, so my actual absolute max DL speed is 2MB/s!
So 500KB/s or 0.5MB/s with 5 times as many leeches as seeds.... I'm happy with that :)

Thanks so much FiNEHD, I'll keep seeding for a good few weeks :)"
,euphoria4949,2011-07-23T20:07Z,"@ sjw71
@ bloodfamily
@ ukbull83

Guys it sounds like the slow speed problem is JUST YOU!! XD 
You need to sort out your setup!!

My connection isn't great yet I managed to download this in just a couple of days, while I might add I also downloaded other HD movies!!

You probably haven't got your router & connection, and your torrent downloader (i.e. Vuze, uTorrent...)  Configured correctly."
,sjw71,2011-07-31T03:42Z,"I wish you were right, unfortunately my router is set up correctly as every other reasonably healthy torrent downloads @ 600 KBps.

I'll give it another go when the new data month rolls over.

I also seem to get a lot of hash fails with this torrent, not sure if that is uTorrent or that this torrent is so big..?

In any case, I downloaded the first two Alien movies 1080p from different torrents so I only need to get two from this one. :)"
,djbaaz,2011-09-20T19:23Z,"Hi all.
