can you explain it to me? plz 

btw cant they just give a life centence instead of charging people fines of 250k dollars?
this is just proof that the government is abusing the audience!!! if no one downloads it that means the government is doing a good job by giving people jobs so they can afford to buy the stuff they want!! and not by working 3 jobs and living in a small apartment with 5 children and so on. people have to many problems allready cant they at least ensure the things people need to live at LEAST and not just giving some people 250 dollar a  min and the rest a dollar a day!! this makes the difference so big that the country of freedom enslaves its own people to much to deserve the name of a free nation!! cant people realise that its by the masses of people that makes it posible for evolution to even exist and everything should be voted on like what is good for the comunity so people could live not live to eat like we are beeing forced to!"
