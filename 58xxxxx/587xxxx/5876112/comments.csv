Not usable for English speakers and not usable for Portuguese speakers (since the narration is all in English).

I guess it's doable if you're a member of the Gracie family or something...

LAME."

- Portuguese is a native language spoken in 8 countries, and there are about 240 MILLION people in the world that speak the language.
- In the description of the torrent I mentioned that the subtitles are in Portuguese.
- The torrent is usable to Portuguese viewers because whenever a tribesman speaks, what he says gets translated in the subtitle.

Conclusion:
Chill out
