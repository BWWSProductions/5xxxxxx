"Trailerhood" is the title of a song written and recorded by Toby Keith for his upcoming 2010 album Bullets in the Gun. It was released as the first single from the album in June 2010. It is his 50th single.

The music video was directed by Michael Salomon and premiered on the CMT website on July 14, 2010. It features Toby singing in a trailer park.

Matt Bjorke of Roughstock in his review was mainly positive, describing the melody as "a delicious mixture of classic country sounds and textures that really help keep the whole song light and just fun." He also called it a perfect song for the summer/fall playlists but that "people who live in big houses and cities or even suburbia will not likely relate to the lyrics". Bjorke also said that the song showcases some of Keith's best vocals in quite a while. 

"Trailerhood" is an upbeat song that celebrates the trailer park lifestyle. In the narrators view, it's a world filled with pink flamingos, plastic pools, auto racing and cans of beer, but also a place without judgment, where true friendships can be found.

Bullets in the Gun is the fifteenth studio album from American country artist Toby Keith. It is set to be released in the United States on October 5, 2010 through Show Dog-Universal Music. The album's second single "Bullets in the Gun" released to radio on September 27, 2010.

Toby Keith Covel (born July 8, 1961), best known as Toby Keith, is an American country music singer-songwriter, record producer and actor. Keith released his first four studio albums â€” 1993's Toby Keith, 1994's Boomtown, 1996's Blue Moon and 1997's Dream Walkin', plus a Greatest Hits package for various divisions of Mercury Records  before exiting in 1998. These albums all earned gold or higher certification, and produced several chart singles, including his debut "Should've Been a Cowboy", which topped the country charts and was the most played country song of the 1990s. The song has received 3 million spins since then, according to Broadcast Music Incorporated.

Signed to Nashville DreamWorks in 1998, Keith released his breakthrough single "How Do You Like Me Now?!" that year. This song, the title track to his 1999 album of the same name, was the Number One country song of 2000, and one of several chart-toppers during his tenure on DreamWorks Nashville. His next three albums, Pull My Chain, Unleashed, and Shock'n Y'all, produced three more Number Ones each, and all of the albums were certified multi-platinum. A second Greatest Hits package followed in 2004, and after that, he released Honkytonk University.
