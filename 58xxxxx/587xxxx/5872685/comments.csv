UPLOAD NBA 2k11 IF YOU HAVE IT!

I see a shit ton of XBox versions but nobody has done PS3 yet.

Downloading this now :)"
,rurik1967,2010-10-08T06:15Z,"Sure ill upload 2k11 next, got it a few days ago."
,rurik1967,2010-10-08T06:45Z,"Also note, after unraring the 5 files, theres a image, mount with powerISO or whatever and copy to your PS3 internal or external drive. Forgot this had a image or i would have removed it my and ReRared it."
,poeticpyro,2010-10-08T06:54Z,"Hmmm, you .img filed it?  Are you not using jailbreak method?

How exactly are you sending it to your internal HD if its an image file?"
,rurik1967,2010-10-08T07:10Z,"@Poeticpyro alot of games are released on the net as image files, its not a PS3 bluray image, just a normal image file, just mount it with a virtual drive ie PowerISO, Damons or whatever,and open it up, and you will see the PS3_Game, PS3_Update folders and the PS3_SFB file.

Normally when i find these like this, I repackage and re RAR them, but I missed this one."
,poeticpyro,2010-10-08T07:35Z,"No problem man, thanks for the information.  I've never downloaded one that was an image file so I didn't know if you mounted it it would show the folders.

I'll be watching for NBA 2k11 :)

Thanks again."
,babak160,2010-10-08T14:58Z,"can  you upload Eternal Sonata ps3

thanx"
,daperdon,2010-10-09T02:19Z,@rurik1967 do my ps3 need to be jailbroken to play this game
,rurik1967,2010-10-09T02:34Z,"Ya you need a JB PS3 to play all games you dont still the Original in to play :(

Lots of ways to Jailbreak your PS3, google ps3 jailbreak and start reading :)"
,rurik1967,2010-10-09T19:13Z,"Heres NBA 2K11 as requested

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5876223"
,daperdon,2010-10-09T20:21Z,@rurik1967 which is easier to do the t184 calc or the mod stick and do the mod stick actually work
,rurik1967,2010-10-09T20:54Z,"I got a mod stick which is upgradable which I use on my primary ps3, I like these better vs my ipod nano 1G psgroove device, mainly due to ease to use, ie kids, plus fact from what i see it tends to get upgraded alot faster then other devices. IMO that is."
,poeticpyro,2010-10-10T19:46Z,"Is anybody else having an issue important draft classes?

My game is not giving me the option to import the classes during the pre-season to regular season transition...."
,rurik1967,2010-10-11T06:11Z,"So much for people seeding, just alot of people who get the whole thing and bail."
,poeticpyro,2010-10-11T06:49Z,"I'm pretty surprised.  Usually people seed well on TPB but these PS3 games seem to hold no seeders.

I still have Madden seeding and I'm still currently downloading NBA 2k11."
,rurik1967,2010-10-11T10:28Z,"So much for me uploading the new MoH and other games releasing today and tomarrow, just sad people hit and run a large torrent, and wont seed for least a few days."
,cronix91,2010-10-11T12:14Z,"No one seed Because Sony is after us!  Ppl downloading from 
http://www.ps3iso.com/ps3-game-downloads/ 

My share ratio on ps3 game is 10.00+.  seeding after me. thanks for upload! hope it work!"
,cronix91,2010-10-11T12:41Z,P.S rurik1967. 16 seeders on this torrent. them have 100% of the game
,poeticpyro,2010-10-11T16:26Z,"rurik, you should upload them anyways :)

A few of us do seed for you and really appreciate your work."
,rurik1967,2010-10-11T21:18Z,"@cronix91 ya 16 now, was 4 early, which is why I got upset.

as for PS3ISO ya sony been targeting thier website for awhile, its been down a couple times for a half day, few hours here and their. but Honostly, what can sony do? thier sacred system been hacked and ported to anything just about that can run the psgroove hack. They lost the war, all they can do is try to make it difficult for people."
,cronix91,2010-10-12T17:34Z,"rurik1967: ya.. Sony can not do anything about it. Just do a hell for those who do not have a ps3 hacked. I hope they will soon find a way to make custom firmware so we can get updates etc. 

Thanks all up-loaders and hackers! "
,trueazn95,2010-10-31T18:24Z,Do you have to mod your ps3 to play it?

,Phibz408,2011-02-08T05:34Z,"Thanks, fast download and awsome game.

Working great on keamw 3.55 and backup manager v15

Anyone one with a problem must be an Id10t error. Just unzip the iso using ultra iso, ftp ur ps3 with black box and filezilla on ur comp, make a folder in hdd0 name it BLES00918 and put all the files in there. Sit back an chill for a bit... Tada madden 2011 working.

This even plays diskless.

So enough of this ""it dosnt work crap""
