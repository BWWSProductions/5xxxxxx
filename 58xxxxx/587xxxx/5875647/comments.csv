You've got to feel sorry for Lee McKenzie, she gets the main presenters role while Jake Humphries is covering the Delhi Commonwealth Games for the BBC, and gets dropped straight into a 2 hour chat show with no cars running (IMHO, she does a great job BTW) and this is well worth the download still! :)"

As true fans of F1 some of will still find joy in watching this, it still brings of closer to one of our favorite sports. 

If you have nothing constructive to add STFU!
Also please don't blast one of THE most TRUSTED up-loaders who post a VARIETY of races television shows and movies."

No troll or weird comments here just stating the obvious.
You have the right to remain a freakin asswipe. TDMK1 puts your two post to shame and you talk bollocks on his page, the nerve of some people. What should the BBC have titled qually? What should those of us who wanted to see qualifying type in the PB search bar? So now do you see how out of line your request is. Or maybe it should be labeled ""F1; the session that didn't happen""."
