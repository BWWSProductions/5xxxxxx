You will need an original Lego indiana jones game & a SD card .

This mod is quite straight forward , if you follow the guide as instructed , you can perform this mod in 20 mins .

As the new 4.3 update is out , you will find that the bannerbomb and twilight hacks do not work now , the only way, is this or smash stack hack (which requires a NTSC version of SSBB) .

If you do not have Lego indy , but have the NTSC version of smash bros , then you can get the smash stack hack guide from wiihacks.com & gbatemp.net .

This guide is for Lego indy hack only.

If you are on any lower software version before 4.3 , do not update as there are excellent guides on wiihacks to softmod you Wii .

I also have the new Wii shop WAD , if some peoples have stopped working because of the new update that is out . As i said before , you do not need to update to 4.3 to make the new games or to get the shop channel working .

This guide is only for people on 4.3 . if you need a guide to softmod any other version , Pm me and i will send you a link to the right 1.





if any one has a problem with priiloader starting after the restart of the Wii ( some Wii's just dont like doing it) , hold in reset when you power on the Wii & it will start the priiloader software menu for you
