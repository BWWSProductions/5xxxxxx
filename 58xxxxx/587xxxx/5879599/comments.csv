,sexpanther,2010-10-12T05:32Z,"Nice up!

I have a 4.3u softmodded and it's fuckin' awesome.  I'm now running all my games off an external drive with usb loader gx - these softmods are incredible!

If you haven't softmodded your wii yet, you NEED to download this - you're seriously missing out huge."
,todymob,2010-10-12T17:21Z,my wii didnÂ´t like priiloader.. but i can play from usb disk..  what does it do??  do i need install it anyway?? 
,dnaleri,2010-10-15T21:27Z,it has to be original genuine game?  what about a copied version from ThePirateBay?  
,bundoodle,2010-10-16T00:45Z,"where is the thx to the author of this torrent , namely me .

i aint got no problem you taking this from demonoid and upping it again , but at least have the decency to thank the person who took the time to create the guide . 

i thought you would have atleast tried to write it in your own words , but it is obvious that you were too lazy an just copy an pasted my info instead . 

do you have the new shop WAD ???????


i do ! 

its called common courtesy , you acknowledge the creators and spread the word at the same time ."
,dnaleri,2010-10-16T23:01Z,"never mind my question.  of course I would need the genuine game especially if I want to hack a virgin wii.  duh!  looks like I'll have to rent the game.

.BONE. or bundoodle, how come the instructions say ""Nintendo Wii 4.2 Softmodding Guide""?"
,bundoodle,2010-10-17T00:32Z,"typo on my part my friend , once it was up , i couldn't be bothered to ammend it with another torrent .

so i left it as it is 

if you have a demonoid account you can get this (the original) and plenty other stuff related to the wii from me .

there is no point in directing any questions towards .BONE. , he hijacked this torrent from me .

as i said , for all that want this softmod guide and a response to there questions , hop onto demoinoid , type Wii softmod in the search bar & you'll see my name on the list  .

i help alot of people out with softmodding & general questions about the wii . "
,dnaleri,2010-10-18T00:30Z,"this works.  was able to do this on a virgin wii 4.3U. having problems with the priiiloader though.  we'll try again later.

props to the author bundoodle....."

,dkskinn,2011-12-23T03:44Z,Just seeing if any one has a response or a fix for those who are having issues with priiloader. 
,foxalot,2011-12-24T17:19Z,does this have to be Indiana or any original game???
,smallname,2012-01-02T05:31Z,"I just wanted to give a little help to the people having problems loading from the SD card. It has to be an SD card, and not an SDHC card. If it's over 2Gb, it's definitely an SDHC card (HC is High capacity). Examine the markings on the card if you're not sure how big it is."
,r1725,2012-01-25T04:10Z,"@bundoodle

Dude, Are you the one who found this exploit? Did you code ANY of the programs? I didn't think so. Now, stop being a little bitch and go back to demonoid"
