,exocet10us,2012-03-11T21:48Z,"so far i've watched episodes 1 and 2
made them into dvd format and they're pretty good
audio: 9
video: 8

only drawback is that there are no alien translations i.e. when watto and anakin speak to each other as well as other small parts on episode 1 and on episode 2 noticable on the battle of geonosis. Other than those 2 minor things my son and i loved it. thank you very much"
