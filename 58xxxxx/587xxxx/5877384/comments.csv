,serverminne,2010-11-19T13:09Z,AdAware sais Keygen.exe is infected with Win32.TrojanSpy.Banker. Get the latest QuickTime from http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/ and use the multi version Keymaker.exe in http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5269557/Apple_QuickTime_Pro_v7.6.5_Multilingua instead.

,ConnieL,2011-05-03T02:31Z,"Downloaded and unzipped fine. Went to install only to be told it's an older version of what I have, and I don't have Pro. You trying to pass off something that's not what the title indicates?"
,ConnieL,2011-05-03T02:42Z,"Ok, I used the Keygen to register my current Quicktime after reading instructions from another quicktime torrenter. Thanks, it appears to have worked, just wished you would of been more specific, ""Go To Edit, Preferences, Register+ with code from Keygen""."

,38mada,2011-09-08T02:20Z,the download was good but the keygen gave me a viris that AVG cought and removed for me . other than that quicktime works perfectly and plays all the files from my phone
,camposanto,2011-09-29T10:43Z,"MBAM says RiskWare.Tool.CK about the keygen. AVG says it's clean, but at running, AVG says ""malware.gen"" but AVG don't delete this. Offers you to delete or to continue with

Works fine (like a charm) and ever with last version at this time v7.70.80.34"

,calledfor,2011-10-06T17:40Z,"It downloaded great, everything seemed to work fine, when I put in the code, it showed that it was a pro code, but when I try to use the pro function (saving an audio file off the net), it doesn't allow me to click on save file.  Any ideas?"
,dvbguy,2011-10-15T12:35Z,"I install it, but where do I have to insert the serial?. If I click on buy now I enter the quicktime homepage??"
,zookafg3,2011-10-23T00:31Z,"******Thank you uploader, it works great*****

For the ones that cant find a place for the serial:
first make sure you open the rar with winrar or 7zip.
In quicktime player window use menu Edit /Preferences/Register

in the window that pops-up, use the info inside serial key txt:
Registered to: xxxxxxx (replace xxxx with the ones on txt file)
Registration code: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx (replace xxx with the ones on txt file)

Hope it helps."

Also thank you to Zookafg3 for telling me how to register, It took me longer to find out how to register than it did to actually convert the file I wanted to convert!"
