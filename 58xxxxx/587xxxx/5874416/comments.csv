,tomislavvidakovic,2010-10-09T01:41Z,"it doesnt work...first of all the game doesnt need serial,it doesnt ask for it at any point,second of all the game crashes everytime wright after the insomnia..."
,Fendtx,2010-10-09T08:57Z,"This game works with me and it does ask a serial. 
But this is the first version of the game and is full of bugs and problems. I hope someone is uploading the new version very soon"

,kevmeister2009,2010-10-11T16:19Z,"I tried both patches.  they really stabilized the game but it's still hard to figure out without being able to map the keys.  hell, even a manual would help..."
,jukki74,2010-10-11T17:23Z,"Game is full of bugs. I managed to fill my tank only once. After that,no more filling please."
[T],DjAligator14,2010-10-11T20:55Z,"http://www.file-upload.net/download-2883163/AgrarSimulator_NEU.exe.html

another patch this game really suck a lot. Better farming simulator"
,kevmeister2009,2010-10-12T08:17Z,you can upgrade your farm buildings and get a fuel station set up on the farm.  it's still a pain because there is no regular key-board mapping feature.  
,jukki74,2010-10-12T08:42Z,"I know about upgradeing your farm,but it won't help, I got 5000 liter petrol,but still cannot refill my tank. Don't know where's that place is where you can refill. Only i know that place is inside hall."
,jukki74,2010-10-12T11:27Z,"This new patch seems to fix most of problems. 
Game running smootly and refueling seems to work"
,kevmeister2009,2010-10-12T11:46Z,thanx to the uploader for the patches.   they really made  a difference to make this game run smoother...
,jukki74,2010-10-12T15:46Z,"How about multiplayer? 
Is that working?
I can't join,but i can creat play."
,kevmeister2009,2010-10-13T15:51Z,"Jukki; if you hit ESC, then click on the furthest left button on the farm window, you can click on refuel all.  I damaged my plow and can't repair it, so some of the features are still disabled and not working properly.  I WOULD really like to get this game working properly; it looks like it has some really neat features."
,jukki74,2010-10-13T18:39Z,"Refueling seems to work now,but how do i join online games? Nothin happens,if pressing join button or double cliking server's name."
,janes104,2010-10-14T12:26Z,The game is new and needs some time to get bug fixes.You can help them too with send them bugs what games have.All the new games have some bugs.
,Josha5000,2010-11-03T10:44Z,"Do NOT download this.

The game is shit!

Koch Media will just sent the lawyers on downloaders.... the only way they can make money with this game. They also fake recessions on amazon. Its just big bullshit what the company is doing!


If you want a good farming game look for ""Farming Simulator 2011"" from Astragon! The real game and as i might add: A real good ""Farming Simulator""."
,gogx81,2011-03-01T20:01Z,who can give me the key to agrarian simulator that works with pachs v1.1.0.4. thanks
,ricomon35,2011-03-15T05:37Z,"Working Registration Code for patch 1.1.0.4

AGRI-CULT-URAL-SIMU 

Yes, all caps. 
Pulled off of a youtube video, for another 
torrent."
,IceWhyte,2011-04-29T23:03Z,"Hi, does anyone know of recent patches? I tried the ones in the previous comments but they are not there anymore. My frickin stuff keeps disappearing."
,amcco,2011-05-16T15:17Z,"Hi guys,what's up..

Could some one  of you upload Agricultural simulator 2011 Extended edition 
ps. Is that the same game only patched or is tha't something new worth games name .. thanx"
,tranceg,2011-06-09T15:37Z,"I'm with this ^^^ guy. If someone can even upload an un-cracked iso, I know a little bit about cracking, and know a few people who know a lot about cracking, so I may be able to get it cracked and re-upload the cracked version."
,Fox_Almighty,2011-07-04T20:44Z,"Setup is really simple.
Just install (allow auto updates), once installed, it'll ask you to update to version 1.1.0.4, do it. Run the game using AGRI-CULT-URAL-SIMU as the registration key, then play.
Works great with my GeForce 9800 GTX+ at almost max graphics settings. Default controls are messy and need customization, and there's still some minor bugs to work out, but the game works and is better than Farming Simulator by a huge margin. The fact that you now have a reason to work and have risks in getting your stuff damaged and have a lot more variety in everything just makes Farming Simulator a joke. Plus the graphics and level of details in everything is far superior.
Thank you for uploading this. :)"
,Fox_Almighty,2011-07-04T22:06Z,"After playing for an hour... The game doesn't allow me to go in reverse with the cheapest tractor (the reverse lights become a strobe light) and my chickens don't show up anywhere (I had bought 500 chickens in 2 compartments or w/e and none of them showed up, but the cows showed up. Refueling is no big deal once you've figured it out, and the tractors consume a ridiculous amount of gas (runs out after like 10 minutes of driving). There's also some minor bugs in the buildings. I can't seem to do any damage to the tractor itself, but I'm sure the add-on stuff would take damage."
[T],DjAligator14,2011-09-13T17:27Z,AGRI-CULT-URAL-SIMU you can play with that serial but you  will have lot's of errors.
,Catholics,2011-09-26T13:33Z,WhereÂ´s the new updates biogas gold etc? I think im not the only one want it!
