Virtualize your CDs, DVD, HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs and get the fastest possible access to 

your data, both locally and over the network. Virtual CD creates images of your optical 

media, so you can use them at any time without having the physical medium on hand. Your 

data is available exactly as if the medium was in the drive, without the disadvantages 

attendant, for example, on network shares. The images created can be stored on a server to 

enable simultaneous access by multiple users. When creating an image, you have the option 

of selecting the level of compression and, if desired, even encryption. You get maximum 

availability of your data, while lost, damaged and stolen media become a thing of the past. 

With a simple left click on the Virtual CD symbol you arrive at the program menu where you 

can utilize all important Virtual CD functions. If you click on the symbol with the right 

mouse key, the drive menu opens. Here you can e.g. insert and eject images or insert blank 

CDs in the virtual burner.
