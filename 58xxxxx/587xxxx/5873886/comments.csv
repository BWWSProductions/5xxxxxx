,Arjunnn,2010-10-08T11:11Z,can u upload vampire diaries s1 complete in mp4 format :) i'll be seeding it forever :) 
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-08T11:28Z,"@Arjunnn: I cannot, 'cause I kept only few episodes (four) from season one. Fans of Vampire Diaries and me... well... haven't be in ""good relations"".
In fact - highest recorded number of Hit & Runs I had on first dozen episodes of Vampire Diaries - back then on mininova, of course.

I assume that you have nothing to do with that - but when I warn people ""do not shit where you eat"" - it's about this.

TVD S2 is back ONLY because request of my friend."
,Arjunnn,2010-10-08T11:46Z,"thank you for ur reply
ur video quality has been awesom
can i kno which software u use to convert these files so that i can convert these files myself :) "
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-08T12:25Z,"@Arjunnn: I use software written, compiled or modified by - myself. It's highly customized to suit my specific needs. But - you can try Handbrake, it is free and versatile open source program. Not quite good as mine - but has GUI (Graphical User Interface) and it is much easier to use  than strict command-line, as in case of my tool-chain. Many encoders on TPB use HandBrake or MeGUI. Just Google."
