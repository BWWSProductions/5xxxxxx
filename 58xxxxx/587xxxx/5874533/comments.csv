,netfoxx,2010-10-09T12:23Z,"Video = 9  Audio = 1. Bad = Audio has a lot of glitches, is out of sync a lot and has 15 sec of missing audio. Good = So not funny it saved my bandwidth finding a better version. "
,freak187,2010-10-10T18:30Z,"yeah, the audio was extremely bad. it just kept going in and out of sync and at times there was nothing."
,Phatfish,2010-10-11T21:39Z,"Audio is fine for a R5.
Movie is no so fine though.
Jenn Proske is extremely fine though, she can suck me dry any day all day."

,GANJAking223,2010-10-20T12:09Z,I think that whenever anyone takes the time to get pissed of and write back online has already lost the fight.... Im talking to you fucko
,Jambom89,2010-10-22T16:33Z,"@ peeps who say the audio's out of sync.

VLC, which is slim, fast and plays everything. 
Has a special function where you can re sync the audio track. 

1. Get VLC [free and fast. No BS]

2.  Go to Tools > Track Synchronization

3. Scroll that 0.000s until the voices match up to the actors mouths. 

:Nothing big to fix. It's easy for me and I'm pretty dumb. 

::WMP, Quick time, Real, DIVX, are all shit. Only one media player is ever needed. VLC. It plays any file you got and it plays DVD too."

You may not be able to delete your account but you could always just log off it and erase cookies for this site. Or you could just not be a little bitch and stop posting on the comments if you hate TPB so much. 

And there's nothing wrong with phat getting his first boner. Boners make the world go round. 
If it weren't for your slimy bastard of a father's little unsatisfying boner that he fucked that 700 pound Cow you call your fucking mom. 
Your limp dick wouldn't be breathing the undeserved shit filled air you are now. Go slit your throat and call it a day, kay? :3"

That was beautifully spoken. i couldn't agree more. cudos"
,referhead,2010-10-25T14:20Z,"i love when people argue via TPB comments. its sometimes more entertaining than the movie im lookin for.. stupid movie btw, funny, but stupid. i aboslutely hate the twilight series so this was funny as hell to me. follows the plot pretty much exact of the first twilight for about 3/4 the movie, the smashes the other 2 in the last 1/4 of the movie. the last 5 seconds was the funniest.  "
,TheeLoneNinja,2010-10-26T17:46Z,Looked funny until around 15 mins when audio went completely. Avoid.
,7eo,2010-10-28T04:46Z,Vampires suck and so does this movie.
,abbe55,2010-10-30T00:12Z,When i watched in vlc the audio was unsynced but not in mediaplayer.
,ccorels,2010-10-30T05:04Z,Good download but the movie blows! 
,awesomewelles,2010-10-31T12:14Z,and his name is FUCKO!!!! :D
,Chevey0,2010-11-01T16:46Z,"video = 10/10
audio = 6/10

audio is often out of sync and 15 min in its silent for a few min's, better off getting a different one"

,cryskonig,2010-11-04T14:09Z,I have a boner right now from all of you saying boner so many times......wait.....aaaggh....and I'm spent! T/Y! :D
,Phatfish,2010-11-04T19:39Z,"@fucko31243:

Trolling attempts on TPB's movie comments is about as dumb bogan retarded as it gets.
"
,theRealKarmine,2010-11-10T13:34Z,just wondering if you guys knew that these releases do NOT come from TPB.  so quit asking for shit.  thats like 500 people spamming mininova on axxo releases asking for 30 year old movies.  go rent the shit and rip it.
,buschmanmax,2010-11-16T02:49Z,"lol fucko ur calling us morons yet your so dumb u cant figure out how to remove ur account... right in your main page after u log in (where u change ur pw aka ""preferences"" ) you just click account removal then verify. and poof ur worthless ass is gone and we dont have to hear your ignorant hateful comments. oh and jambom if i ever meet u im buyin u a beer for that last comment u made on here.. laughed my ass off when i read that. u ripped him a new one :p and as far as the upload its a R5 so obviously not HD quality but very passable until a true dvd rip comes along. audio has a few problems but nothing that makes the movie unwatchable. A\6.5 V\8 M\6 (not my cup of tea so to speak but if u like crude fart and sex jokes this will give u a few laughs) NOT for the kiddies
watch first before sitting down with the ""fam"" to watch this. and as always ty to the uploader for taking the time to put this up. "
,dantecerber,2010-11-17T10:27Z,I agree with netfoxx and freak187. The audio is really bad and makes this movie very hard to watch. It drops out in places and does not sync up.
,peewee-hermen,2010-11-29T06:03Z,"@phatfish
don'y you mean all day any day........."
,peewee-hermen,2010-11-29T06:04Z,"@phatfish
don't you mean all day any day"
,priex10,2010-12-01T22:58Z,"A:5 (out of sync and it goes out a couple times)
V:9
M:-10

Just don't waste your time watching this, idk why i watched the whole movie"
