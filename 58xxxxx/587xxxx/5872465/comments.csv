An iso is a ""disc image file"", which I think speaks for itself, especially if you read the torrent's notes.

,Rapier_Wit,2010-10-23T21:57Z,Nice quality and decent d/l speed too. Had to run m2ts file through Handbrake to shave off the extra Mbs to run it off PS3's HDD (damn FAT32 limitation). Big thanks.

Good job, and you're welcome.

Yup, without subtitles, this one is 3.99Gb, and will squeeze onto PS3's ridiculously formatted  HDD, so they can just be removed with tsMuxer etc, but of course, it can be burnt to a DVD5 disc and played anyway, or compressed further by using a MKV container."
