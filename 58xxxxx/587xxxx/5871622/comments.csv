,jinja_jorj,2011-01-16T00:42Z,"worked fine for me, didnt work first 10 or so times, make sure that you click the mem patch each time etc - i ended up using the 3ds max 2011 keygenerator but its the exact same program, and it eventually worked :) thanks scuba-doo"
,midiman82,2011-02-07T21:00Z,"Works great!!!

1. Mount the image with poweriso or other  program. 
2. Copy the complete folder to your harddrive.
3. install Mudbox using 666-69696969 as serial and 498C1 as product key.
4. after install, start Mudbox.
5. click activate (it will be wrong) click cancel (are you sure? click yes)
6. click activate again.
7. select I have an activation code from autodesk.
8. copy the request code from the activation screen and paste it in the keygen.
9. click generate 
10. CLICK MEMPATCH!!!! (it will be patched succesfully)
11. copy the serial and paste it in the activation screen. (the serial is too short, thats no problem!!)
12. click activate and have a lot of fun!!!
