Plot outline:
When Flight 29 flies through a strange aurora in the sky, all but 10 on the plane mysteriously vanish. Among the survivors are a schoolteacher, a blind girl, a machine worker, an airline pilot, a British secret service agent, a mystery novel author, a musician, a drug addict and a raving lunatic. Fearing a dangerous situation in Boston, the airline pilot lands the plane in Bangor, Maine, where they discover to their great surprise that the rest of the planet is also deserted. Now, it's a race against time to refuel the plane and take off, because the Langoliers are coming and they're hungry for some human flesh....
