X Factor and BBC Radio 2 presenter Dermot Oâ€™Leary is launching â€œThe Saturday Sessionsâ€ album in conjunction with his BBC Radio 2 show (Saturdayâ€™s from 3pm â€“ 6pm.

The Saturday Sessions album, which will be released on October 4th 2010, is a collection of cover versions and rare stripped back acoustic versions from The Dermot Oâ€™Leary Show, which takes place every Saturday afternoon on BBC Radio 2.  Featuring a variety of artists from Lily Allen, Massive Attack and Ellie Goulding to Katy Perry, Paolo Nutini and Florence & The Machine. All the tracks are exclusive to this album, and not available anywhere else.

The Saturday Sessions exclusively features a variety of recording artists who have swept the UKâ€™s music scene over the past decade and beyond with a mix of new and modern takes on classic tracks. The album is a must have for fans of the bands, fans of the music and fans of Dermot.

Dermotâ€™s show is the new music programme for BBC Radio 2 â€“ the UKâ€™s most listened to radio station. The show which won The Sony Awards Best Music Programme earlier this year, has been responsible for helping break new bands and give first plays to upcoming artists such as Paloma Faith, Lissie, The Ting Tings, Fleet Foxes, The Feeling, Scouting For Girls and The Hoosiers.

Dermot Oâ€™Leary said â€œThe Saturday Sessions is my favourite part of the show. Itâ€™s a privilege to hear such a diverse and brilliant range of artists singing songs you wouldnâ€™t necessarily associate with them, which makes these performances so unusual and special. This album has really fuelled my passion for live music.â€

Dermotâ€™s always had music in his blood; he kick-started his career as a DJ working for a local radio station, which later led him on to a series of presenting slots with both XFM and Radio 2. Dermotâ€™s passion for music has always reflected in his achievements and Dermotâ€™s radio 2 show won Music Programme of the Year in 2008 and then again in 2010.

The Saturday Sessions album launches on October 4th 2010 and is available to buy and download from iTunes, Amazon and all good retailers.
