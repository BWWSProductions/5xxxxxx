ABOUT BD5/BD9

   Where does this play?
       
   -> BD5/BD9 is meant for playback on pc/popcorn/htpc/ps3/bluray-player
          
   How does it work?

    ->  For playback on pc simply extract and play the mkv in your favorite player.
        another option is to create the bluray/image for playback with powerdvd.
    ->  For playback on ps3/bluray-player run "Convert to BD5.exe" and chose "B".
        This will convert the mkv to bluray and create an image that will play
        in the PS3 or a Bluray Player.
           
    How's the quality?
           
    -> Qualiy is to be considered the same as BluRay releases.
             
    Why is BD5/BD9 "undersized"?
           
    -> The conversion to bluray takes up some 200-300MB (500-600MB for BD9)
       space which is the bluray overhead. Because of this the mkv is sligthly
       "undersized".
                
    Why doesn't everything get released as BD5/BD9?
           
    -> We don't know and there is no logical reason. However, as time goes on other
       groups cannot continue to ignore the bluray community by stubbornly releasing
       incompatible BluRay releases. It's like releasing DVDR's that don't run in
       DVD Players.
