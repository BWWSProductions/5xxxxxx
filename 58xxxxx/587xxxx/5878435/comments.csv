[V],Kuthumi,2010-10-11T20:39Z,"Thank you, really interesting!"
,TaiTheGuy,2010-10-22T20:31Z,"One of the WORST movies of the decade. Not even worth stealing for free.
I feel sorry for whoever might have paid to see this.
Probably from the same makers as quantum apocalypse."
,Kali_Flower,2010-10-24T05:13Z,"To you and everyone else who made this movie available for downloading:
You are fucking rock stars! I love you and hope you each receive a huge karmic reward in the near future!
Yes this movie is terrible. Oh man, it is God-fucking-awful! 
But it stars Misha Collins. 
So I mute the tv, watch, and slowly burn a hole through my couch ;)"
