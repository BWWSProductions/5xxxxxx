This collection is no way a complete one. Everyone knows that there are around 60 music videos available in the internet in the name of Michael Jackson. I have avoided GHOSTS and the ghost part of THRILLER and the thriller part of THIS IS IT because I don't like to watch ghosts dancing!! I have not included childhood performances of MJ because they lack his magical adult voice. Yet, you can get a glimpse of them in Jackson No.5 from Moonwalker.
I have also excluded coverage of live shows because they aren't true music videos... except some rehearsals for THIS IS IT concert (which never happened). Among them, BILLIE JEAN is significant because the original BILLIE JEAN video doesn't feature much of MJ's dance movements. In that rehearsal, MJ performs a fantastic solo dance at the age of 50 (just a couple of months before his death).
