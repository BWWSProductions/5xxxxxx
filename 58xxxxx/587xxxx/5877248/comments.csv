The oil companies and war machine has done too much damage for too long, and Americans need to learn as the people of Brazil did that there are ways to break free of the grip of big oil and big government.  Even industrial agriculture's crushing power against the American Farmer can be defused with the information found in this video and the book."

There are a number of things in the video that I don't agree with from a technical perspective, but the video and especially the book are excellent."
