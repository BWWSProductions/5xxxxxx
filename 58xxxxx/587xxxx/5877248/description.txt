This is DVD rip of David Blume's excellent seminar video called "Alcohol Can Be a Gas."  If you've ever wanted the truth about ethanol as an alternative to gasoline, you've just found it.  Mr Blume answers the questions many of us have about what he likes to call "liquid sunshine."  This video covers the science, economics, environmental aspects, ethical, and political aspects of Ethanol Fuel versus petroleum.
