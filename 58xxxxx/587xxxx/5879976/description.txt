By the late 90s, Nanci Griffith appeared to have lost her spark after a run of poor albums. Thankfully, in 2001 she returned with her first set of original songs in 4 years to redress the balance slightly. Clock Without Hands is still inconsistent and nowhere near her best, but it at least shows some signs of her songwriting talent. The title track and "Traveling Through This Part Of You" especially are excellent songs which display the older, wiser Griffith in top form. "Midnight In Missoula" and "Pearl's Eye View" also stand out from the crowd, as does "Where Would I Be". Most of the rest of the album is fairly solid, aside from the closing cover of "In The Wee Small Hours", which simply isn't very good. Her voice isn't great here but she can certainly still hold a tune, and overall Clock Without Hands is good enough to suggest that the previous couple of albums were anomalies.
