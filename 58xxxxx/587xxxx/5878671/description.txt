PLOT:

Nandu, who lives in the same colony as Pinky, is a one shot boxer working under Usman Bhaiâ€™s gang. One day while driving, Nandu accidently runs over Pinky and thatâ€™s when life takes a different route for both of them. While the world and Pinky herself think that it was Anna who ran over Pinky, Nandu is the only one who knows the real secret but remains silent about it. Pinky loses her vision and dreams both in that accident but not her desire to win the competition. Thatâ€™s when Nandu finds her out and teaches her how to see using other senses that she has and Pinky chooses Nandu as her partner for the competition. While they are teaching each other and practicing together, the two fall in love as Pinky regains her confidence and starts watching the dream to win â€˜Indiaâ€™s got talentâ€™ again. The story, however, takes an expected turn when Pinky finds out who her real culprit was.
