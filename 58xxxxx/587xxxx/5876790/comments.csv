,shango,2010-10-10T01:58Z,Wonderful film. One of my favorites of the french new wave. Its strange when watching this in a film class I think I was the only person who loved this movie. I can get why some dont like it but its so mesmerizing. Thanks for all the great movies!

De nada!"
,nargyriadis,2010-10-17T20:06Z,Doesn't work on WDTV Live - player freezes and has to be rebboted. Probably problem with header compression. Works with VLC on PC and Mac.
[T],insinuendo,2010-10-24T21:24Z,"If using external player like WDTV or mediagate,
simply remux the file with mkvmerge http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/

Make sure the compression is set to ""none"" in extra options."
