So here's the first podcast from DJ Pork Chops. An hour long episode of reggae, ska and soul for all the skinheads, mods and suedeheads. I managed to have the microphone off all the way through so no comments or me introducing the tracks unfortunately but hopefully the music can do all the talking. 100% has a way of talking you round!
