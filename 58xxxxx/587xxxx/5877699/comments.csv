,jrizz0,2010-11-09T22:11Z,Loads up as DEMO? All of the applications say I am using the free version... Is that really what this is?
,jrizz0,2010-11-09T22:12Z,Probably should clarify that I created a bootable USB stick using the files in this ISO and the demo version of the Active@ boot disk creator... I know that sounds obvious but I'm just making sure.
,jrizz0,2010-11-09T23:28Z,Figured it out. Just had to pull the key file from the iso and copy it to the usb stick.
