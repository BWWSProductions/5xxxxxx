Quantum Mechanics - The Measurement Problem


Most people (most physics as well), know something about quantum physics. But we seem to completely ignore the philosophical implications it has.

The measurement problem in quantum mechanics is the unresolved problem of how (or if) wavefunction collapse occurs. The inability to observe this process directly has given rise to different interpretations of quantum mechanics, and poses a key set of questions that each interpretation must answer. The wavefunction in quantum mechanics evolves according to the SchrÃ¶dinger equation into a linear superposition of different states, but actual measurements always find the physical system in a definite state. Any future evolution is based on the state the system was discovered to be in when the measurement was made, meaning that the measurement "did something" to the process under examination.

So we dont know what is, when we dont measure it.

Lets take a new viewpoint.

By the nature of physics we have to say that what we can measure is what we can know. If we cant measure it, no matter how amazing our equipment is, we have to say that it is an abstraction. A theory. Right?

What is given by the normalized wavefunction is the probability distribution in space, of finding the particle. The probability is not a physical substance. It is a mathematical concept, a thought - right? So we have an abstraction (probability) before we measure, but afterwards, the wavefunction is collapsed (gone), and we have the real physical particle somewhere. Now the question is - what is the reality that creates the probability distribution as it is before we measure it? And the answer that quantum mechanics give us - it is unknowable by definition!

Ultimately it means, that reality steps out of the unknown. That the truth behind it all is forever hidden behind abstractions. Behind thoughts.

Professor Jim Al-Khalili describes the measurement problem breafly, in the video called: Atom BBC Clash of the Titans. You can find it on this channel: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRM6QVrs_Kg&feature=PlayList&p=B55DC997ADE14C53&index=0&playnext=1
