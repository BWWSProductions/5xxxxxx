,Pain.ter,2011-01-31T05:38Z,VIRUS!!!!
[S],velvet.,2011-01-31T07:18Z,"@Pain.ter: This torrent consist of MP3 music files only. They are data files.
Only executable files can carry a virus.

You really need to learn about false positives from anti-virus software, before you go on making an idiot of yourself by posting more such remarks on other people's torrents."

Thanks for handling that : )"
,Pain.ter,2011-02-02T18:28Z,Bull.  An MP3 probably isn't a virus but the file could contain anything.  
,Phykix,2011-02-02T18:43Z,"Just to say that I'm deeply disapointed that a VIP actually can upload a torrent like this... I downloaded it thinking it was real.

BUT then I noticed something..
SOMETHING 1000 times worse than a virus.
YOU ARE MISSING ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER! :O

How can you forget this super duper song? :O
Otherwise, great upload."
[V],vtwin88cube,2011-02-04T19:15Z,"To all the dumb asses....

I don't know why suddenly there is some doubt about this share.
There is nothing wrong with this torrent. If you don't like it then go to Amazon and buy it! http://www.amazon.com/Are-Experienced-Jimi-Hendrix-Experience/dp/B000002P5Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1296843070&sr=1-1

And as far as why I didn't include this or that, I didn't make the CD, duh! Get a fucking life losers!

,azza1969,2011-03-05T12:14Z,incredible ! still sounds amazing cheers.
,aleneen,2011-04-26T00:06Z,Nothing wrong with this. Listening to it at the moment and it seems fine to me. Thanks for sharing and seeding.
,frymastermeat,2011-05-11T20:09Z,"In response to Phykix comment, I also think it a grievous insult to us downloaders of free music that the uploader did not take the time to hop in his time machine to October 25, 1968, grab Jimi Hendrix himself, and take him back in time to record 'All Along the Watchtower', and then fit it into this album, which was released on May 12, 1967. Of course, you would also have to grab a copy of Bob Dylan's single, 'All Along the Watchtower' before you went, because it wasn't released until November 6, 1967.

A better question would be, why did Jimi insult us by not recording a cover of a song that hadn't even yet been conceived, and release it on this album? What a jerk."
,jx292,2011-05-13T00:20Z,Thanks for the great torrent as usual vtwin. Don't listen to any haters
,Beepbox,2011-05-17T12:22Z,"Excellent!
Thank you"
,0-LSD-0,2011-08-07T03:06Z,"Way to handle it like a fucking child, vtwin. I can't help but feel that most VIP uploaders are young teenagers."
,eatmecaptain765,2011-10-16T06:19Z,"If you are a fan of Jimi, or any Hard Rock Band check out this awesome debut EP from 'The Botanist.'  Bringing back real rock!

Thanks a lot vtwin88cube!"
