King Street Junior was a Radio Comedy about a junior school aired by the BBC from March 1985 to November 1998. 

A continuation of the series renamed King Street Junior Revisited started in 2002 and continued until 2005..


An unassuming character sitcom-cum-light drama serial follows the working lives of a group of teachers at a small junior school in a multiracial area. 

Mr Beeston, the permanently harrassed headmaster (who seemed to be in the habit of saying I'll get on the blower to County Hall, see if they can't sort something out at every possible opportunity), but the main character in plot terms was, initially, the slightly ingenuous Eric Brown (Peter Davison), a newcomer to the teaching profession. Other members of staff who appeared regularly were Mr Holliday, Beeston's deputy; Mrs Stone, the school secretary and resident oasis of calm; plain-speaking Mr Long and the utterly terrifying Mrs Rudd.
