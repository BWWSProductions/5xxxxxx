The first of a two-part programme celebrating the genius of choreographer Kenneth
MacMillan in the year in which he would have turned 80. The three contrasting works
featured in these programmes are danced by the Royal Ballet and they showcase the
beauty and dramatic power of MacMillan's choreography.

Concerto is an early work danced to the music of Shostakovich and is followed by Elite
Syncopations, in which brightly-coloured dancers burst into life to the music of ragtime.

The programme also features interviews with the lead dancers in rehearsal including
Carlos Acosta, Sarah Lamb and Ed Watson, as well as the director of the Royal Ballet,
Monica Mason.

The second of a two-part programme celebrating the genius of choreographer Kenneth
MacMillan in the year in which he would have turned 80.

The Royal Ballet perform the Judas Tree, the Laurence Olivier Award-winning ballet
which was MacMillan's last work before his untimely death of a heart attack at the age of
62. Set on a building site in Canary Wharf it is a highly charged ballet of brutal betrayal
and tense sexual violence.

The programme also features interviews with the lead dancers in rehearsal including
Carlos Acosta, Leanne Benjamin and Ed Watson, as well as the director of the Royal
Ballet, Monica Mason.
