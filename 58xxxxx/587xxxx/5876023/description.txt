Garden State is the soundtrack album to the film Garden State. Compilation producer Zach Braff was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for a Motion Picture for his work on the album.

The music in the film features a number of indie-rock artists, notably The Shins. In an early scene, Sam passes Andrew a headset which is playing the song "New Slang" by The Shins as she says "You gotta hear this one song â€” itâ€™ll change your life; I swear." A second Shins song, "Caring Is Creepy", is also featured on the soundtrack. The presence of Simon & Garfunkel's "The Only Living Boy in New York" on the soundtrack has been cited by some as evidence of another connection to The Graduate. Commenting on the soundtrackâ€™s importance to the film, Sponic Zine wrote, "Braff did a masterful job of choosing songs that exemplified the emotional subtleties in the filmâ€¦ he put together a group of songs that complement each other perfectly and, when put together into one album, create something amazing, almost as if they never should have been apart."
