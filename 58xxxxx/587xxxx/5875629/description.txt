Raymans world kicks into multiplayer overdrive in this total competition crash course with the cast of Rayman 2. Smoke the competition on mind-bending racecourses, or spark up a lum-flinging firefight in the battle arena. And with 8 characters, 24 maps and up to 4 combatants, now Rayman got more ways to reign supreme than ever.

The game offers two main modes of play, with a foot race and a deathmatch mode. The racing mode of the game has Rayman and his associates running through interactive levels that can be altered with switches and other devices to change the course mid-race. The shooter mode is imbued with a Rayman style as well, by offering themed devices and quirky power-ups.
