,odinrlives,2011-05-20T06:17Z,"http://www.advancedpdfconverter.com/products/pdfpasswordremover.html
Advanced PDF Password Remover is a small and easy-to-use tool to decrypt protected Adobe Acrobat PDF files, which have ""owner"" password set, preventing the file from editing, changing, printing, selecting text and graphics and copying them into the Clipboard, or adding/changing annotations and form fields.  Also It can remove the user/open password which protects the PDF files from opening if you know the password. Decryption is being done instantly. Decrypted files can be opened in any PDF viewer without any restrictions. All versions of Adobe Acrobat (including 9.x, which features 128-bit encryption) are supported."
,Kepiuer,2011-06-13T05:03Z,"Unlock PDF password to open, print and edit password protected PDF file
http://findpassword.net/unlock-pdf-password-to-open-print-and-edit-password-protected-pdf-file/
To assure PDF files safety, many users often decrypt their PDF documents using strong password protection. They may set a user password, which is used to restrict opening the PDF file itself. Or they may set an owner password, which is required when somebody tries to copy, edit or print the password protected PDF file. "

,resetpassword,2011-09-29T03:34Z,"Anxiously! I forgot my company's product PDF instructions with password protected. 

So lucky! An IT friend suggested me Ainorsoft Password Recovery Bundle http://windowspasswordrecovery.net/password-recovery-bundle.html which can recover lost PDF password easily! 

I got it and also never worry about any password forgotten now! It can also work for Word, Excel, Access, RAR, mail, etc. password recovery!"
