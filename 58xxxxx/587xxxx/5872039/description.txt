PDF Password Cracker is an utility to remove the security on PDF documents (of course, you should have the right to do it, for example, in case of forgotten user/owner password). Only standard PDF security is supported, neither third-party plug-ins nor e-books. Both protection methods are cracked: 
1. Restricted operations on file can be disabled (instantly, any Acrobat version up to 8.x). 
2. It also can be used to decrypt files you know password for. 
Support PDF 1.8 (Acrobat 9.x) files, including 40-bit RC4 decryption, 128-bit RC4 decryption and AES decryption 
Instantly remove restrictions on copying, printing and other actions with the file 
Do NOT need Adobe Acrobat software 
Please note that PDF Password Cracker doesn't work with documents which have user-level passwords (preventing the files from being opened), if both user and owner passwords are unknown; and PDF files protected with any 3rd party security plug-ins such as FileOpen.
