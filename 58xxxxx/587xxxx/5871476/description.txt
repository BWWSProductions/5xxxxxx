FLAWL3SS NOTES
We did our normal stuff to it. We brighten the movie along with saturation which was very heavy on this one along with the red in it. We also filtered the contrast, denoiser and finally a sharpen filter to it. And for added entertainment we left audio 6 channels.

credit FLAWL3SS & BDK & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
