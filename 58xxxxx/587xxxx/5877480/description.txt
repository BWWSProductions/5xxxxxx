PLOT:

If you're not expecting much -- and, I believe that if you're turning to SyFy for your entertainment, you're not -- then you're in luck! Sharktopus should delight you.

Like all their other (fallen) star-studded beast pics, this SyFy flick is filled with more cheese than a Pizza Hut stuffed crust pizza. This time around they've corralled Eric Roberts (do these guys' agents call SyFy to try and get their careers boosted. now that these beast-cheesers are so popular?) as the what-ever-happened-to? big name draw. Roberts plays a scientist who's created a shark/octopus monster mash-up for the Coast Guard-like folks to try and help them curb the offshore drug smugglers. Naturally things go wrong and loads of people get squished and eaten by the behemoth beast.
