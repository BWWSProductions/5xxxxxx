Meat Loaf Intimate and Interactive is a great dvd. 

Meat Loaf went to Canada to promote his latest cd 'Welcome to the Neighbourhood' in this MUCH MUSIC show on Canadian tv.  Audience in the studio and viewers at home had the opportunity to talk with Meat Loaf and ask him about his music. 
In between Meat and the Neverland Express had time to treat the small crowd with 6 great songs from the new album and the Bat out of Hell cd's.

On the internet you can find a horrible green dvd cover for it. If you have that one trash it as I created a much better dvd cover. Even if you don't like this cover it's ten times better than the one floating the web  ;)
