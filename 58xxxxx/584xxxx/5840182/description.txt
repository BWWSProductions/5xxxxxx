genre: haunting acoustic folk with eerie male vocals.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
"Thayer Cabin makes me feel festive and vaguely sinister at the same time, as if I was a lusty satyr at a wild bacchanal"
-Aesop of Aggaloch
This release has all the atmosphere of pacific northwest black metal, without any distortion, screams or drums whatsoever. It's really pure folk with some astounding guitar work, some handclapping, crackling wood noises, flamenco flavorings, and some eerie male vocals tastefully laid throughout.
The feeling of some songs are foreboding and dark, while others sound like the drinking music of past ages. Either way, this album is great for both active listening and background music, and also acceptable fare for both metal and folk fans.
get it.
