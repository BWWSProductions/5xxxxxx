,Thrace,2010-09-26T23:42Z,"I just bought an Android phone and discovered your torrents, and wow, thank you so much for sharing these amazing applications! Unfortunately, I can't seem to download any of them apart from ChompSMS and Snap Photo Pro because all of them are saying that the tracker is offline. Do you by any chance have them mirrored on any other torrent site? There are a few apps here that I am absolutely dying to have and all the red signs in my uTorrent have been making me sad since Saturday. "
[T],xxThugxx,2010-09-27T20:34Z,"i think tpb tracker is down, it happens sometimes, it should be up and running again in a few days, on some of my newer torrents i added a new tracker too, that should be up and running, i only post my torrents here sorry ..... "
,Thrace,2010-09-28T12:40Z,"I see. The last time I had a torrent that was red on tpb, it never downloaded, even though I left it trying to leech for a couple of months. Would it be impossible to add the 1337x tracker to the other torrents already running? I'm sorry, I have no clue what goes into creating a torrent, so I don't know.

Thanks again. I was able to get this program, too. "
