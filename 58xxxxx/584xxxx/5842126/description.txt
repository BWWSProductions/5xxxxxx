"On paper it seems strange for the psychedelic jazz band MUSHROOM to 

hook up with punk blues singer Gary Floyd of Sister Double Happiness. But 

these guys do a super groove version of the Les McCann/Eddie Harris hit 

Compared To What. Some hot trumpet playing c/o of Jon Birdsong who 

has spent the past 3 years playing with Beck. And Michael Bluestein does 

some wicked piano playing and analog synth - that gives the song sort of 

a space rock overtone. The rest of the CD is all instrumental that is in 

1970's Krautrock meets soul jazz vibe and includes a REMIX by Krautrock 

legends FAUST and one by Tortoise/Gastr del Sol man Bundy K Brown. 

The Bundy K Brown mix sounds like a mix of electronica and early Pink 

Floyd. very trippy and weird and is about 20 mins long ! overall a great CD 

for jamming, tripping and dancing". (review amazon.com)
