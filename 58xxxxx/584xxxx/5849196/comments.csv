[V],twentyforty,2010-09-24T11:17Z,"@prank0007: Audio is very very very bad. Video is cropped and squeezed in height. It could be described as utter crap.
I am hour and half in sound and later I would try to make something decent out of it.
However, I doubt that very much.

@bavage: Yes, after the schedule, Fringe, Grays and Mentalist - as the last one today. Place well deserved by behavior of ""down-loaders"" last week."

,mainfoldspoon,2010-09-26T13:16Z,"my best comedy show of this season along with how i met your mother n 2 1/2 men

great quality
just love the encode 

one question though - I am able to add 2 1/2 men to my ipad through itunes but when I try to add the rest it says format mot supported. don't know why is that cos all are mp4.
but no worries the VLC app runs it all.
thanks

big fan"
