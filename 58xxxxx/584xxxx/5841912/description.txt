Pilot :
In the small town of Brick, New Jersey, two childhood friends, Paul and Jim, make their way through suburban life; wild and carefree. As the two grow into young adults, their reckless behavior continues--it will prove to be their undoing. One night, bored and frustrated, the temptation to revisit their youth was too great. After an innocent prank goes wrong, their lives are forever altered. In the end, their friendship is put to the test and each is forced to live with a secret few could endure.
