         failing and must make a drastic improvement in her grades     
         or risk being kicked out. Meanwhile, after having the         
         rug pulled out from under her at work, Cate starts the        
         difficult process of looking for her next job, and in an      
         effort to be a grown up, Baze decides to interview for a      
          position at his father's firm.
