[V],twentyforty,2010-09-20T19:11Z,"@gary2u: Tomorrow is Glee season 1 and maybe Gossip Girl Season 3... but it's not written in stone. Number of Hit&Runs went sky-high on season packs - for example, two days ago I left How I met your mother whole night active. Seeded was 21 GIGABYTES, number of finished downloads was 38 - but only six seeders stayed - and some of them for shit - 'cause they ""seeded"" such huge pack with 3 kB/s. I was present when some of them downloaded with 2000 kB/s and no one have not 2000 DL and 3 UL speed. No one. 

If people are stupid enough (and they are capable of doing evil and good things combined) I like more to see Hit&Runs because at least they have been honest to yourself.

I am not the one who should be touched by that... I ""own"" the file, right? (meaning - I have it regardless of their actions). What they do not comprehend is following - they screw lot of people up - taking and not giving, point being - they took from ALL others and gave shit back.

And there are consequences of that - direct an indirect ones."
