Also I can see at least 38 peers downloading but it only says 1 here, so who knows what the deal is.  Anyway, don't pay attention to the numbers at the top of the page as they are clearly incorrect."

,jackalope77,2010-09-30T21:07Z,"Thanks Agentbay, thats interesting to know.  Hopefully things are back to normal soon."
,trytryagain1,2010-10-03T06:54Z,"Well it took over 8 days to dl but I finally finished.  Thanks for this ul I love this movie.  I think this is the grand-daddy of all zombie flicks.  My hats of to George Romero for this one.  Damn 8 days to dl, oh well I am sure it is worth it.  Can't wait to check this one out.  Thank alot for the movie Jackalope I truly appeciate it and am sure I will enjoy it.  Thanks again!!!"
,trytryagain1,2010-10-03T06:57Z,"Oh yeah I'll be seeding this for quite a few days, that is for sure.  Hopefully everyone else will do the same.  "
,jackalope77,2010-10-03T09:53Z,"@trytryagain1: Youre very welcome! Im sorry my upload speed is so slow, but my ISP will spank me if I use too much bandwidth.  I agree 8 day download time sucks, but hey, its free right, lol.

This is definitely THE zombie movie that all modern zombie movies owe their existence to, well this and its sequel Dawn of the Dead, the best zombie movie of all time IMHO.  Enjoy!"
,trytryagain1,2010-10-03T20:15Z,"Yeah Dawn of the Dead absolutely right any chance on seeing that one in the near future?

I seeded this all night and for some reason I wasn't helping anyone out.  I wonder why that is?  I was seeding a couple other torrents as well and there wasn't any problem with those.  I tried stopping the other ones and still nothing happening with this one...weird huh."
,trytryagain1,2010-10-03T20:16Z,As I said I will seed this for a few more days and see what happens.
,jackalope77,2010-10-03T21:33Z,"@trytryagain1: I think it was because there was a short time when everyone that was downloading finished so for several hours there were tons of seeders and few leeches, but now most of the seeders have left and the ratio has balanced out again.  My BT client stopped seeding it too, while my other torrents kept going, but now it is seeding normally again.

I definitely might do Dawn of the Dead in the future.  I have a lot of awesome films I want to get out there, but keep your eyes open for it in case I slip it into the order sometime."
,trytryagain1,2010-10-03T23:19Z,"Good news to hear about the possibility of Dawn of the Dead, maybe just in time for Halloween, (hint hint).  Just jokin' I just checked out some of your ul.  Looks like you have been busy the last month or so.  Good to see some of those titles.  I have been following Tater like crazy.  Tater must have one hell of a horror collection.  

I think you are right about the seeding situation on this one.  No sooner then I made my last post and bam there were some takers.  "
[T],ctang,2010-10-05T05:00Z,do you happen to have pretty woman NTSC (dvd5 or 9)
,jackalope77,2010-10-05T05:19Z,"@ctang: i do not, sorry man.  looking for a julia roberts fix?"
[T],ctang,2010-10-06T01:14Z,haha...no my fiance wants it so i told her i would try to find it or rent it for her
,jackalope77,2010-10-06T08:50Z,"im sure i could get my hands on it in a day or two, but by the time i uploaded the whole thing, it would probably be like 5 days or a week before you could watch it.  unless you know a way i could transfer the files to you directly without posting it as a torrent, then i could just let you know when i had it."
,kriegerg69,2010-10-06T18:32Z,"Yes, PLEASE reseed this torrent...this Elite Edition is impossible to find, even on direct download sites (which I usually frequent). I'm truly flabbergasted this isn't being seeded or that there aren't any other torrents or direct downloads of this edition."
,jackalope77,2010-10-06T21:55Z,"@kriegerg69: dont pay attention to the seeds/leeches on the torrent page.  this info has been unreliable for several weeks now.  open the torrent in your BT client and you will see that there are actually several seeders still available.

i agree about the Elite dvd, and the rarity of this edition is exactly why i posted it here. hope you enjoy, and stick around to seed."
,trytryagain1,2010-10-07T04:20Z,"What up guys I just decided to check back in on this one.  Hey man I have been seeding this one non-stop, (well almost non-stop) for over three days.  I didn't plan to keep seeding it but after I read this I most definitely will.  This is as I have already said the grand-daddy of them all.  To have it as an Elite edition...whoa hell yeah I'll keep seeding it...well that is if you will keep seeding it once you have it completed.  Let me know where you are at on this one so that I know when I can have the space back on my hard drive.  

Sorry about the length but damn I love this one, I think I dig this one about as much as I dig Dawn of the Dead...hint hint.  Please let me know what your status is on this one though because like I say I have been seeding it for over 3 days. "
,kriegerg69,2010-10-07T15:48Z,"I use Free Download Manager for any torrents I happen to want. I've never really had any problems using it, but on this torrent I downloaded the torrent file, loaded it into FDM, started the download...and all it is doing is saying ""Connnecting..."", but doesn't seem to actually connect.

....Etc., etc. What is going on here? This usually doesn't happen."
,jackalope77,2010-10-07T19:39Z,"@kriegerg69: Google and download a BT client like Bittorrent, uTorrent, or Vuze.  Open the torrent within one of those programs and you should have no problem.  I am not familiar with FDM so I can't speculate as to why it might not be working.  Right now, Bittorrent says this file has 4 seeds and 3 leeches, even though TPB says 0/0, and I am still seeding too."
,kriegerg69,2010-10-07T23:16Z,"Okay, Jackalope....I hated to have to install yet ANOTHER download program, but I grabbed BitTorrent and it's running now (started up right away once I got the torrent file from here again). You're right about the seeds/peers....that's also displaying something at last. Not being familiar with this program, I'm not sure how to adjust/set it for the best possible results/speed...right now it says it will take a day and a half to get this."
,jackalope77,2010-10-08T01:11Z,"A day and a half for something this big isnt bad.  It took me a week or so to seed the thing in the first place, so if you had started then it would have taken at least that long to DL it.

Both Bittorrent and uTorrent are really good dedicated torrent programs.  I use Bit, but lots of people use uT. Just play with it a little until you get the hang of it, or if you have a specific question I can try and help.  Just set your total UL speed to no more than 80 percent of max, and you should have no probs."
,kriegerg69,2010-10-08T05:33Z,How do I set that upload speed as you suggested? I don't seem to be able to find it in the Options. Would like to know what particular settings I should use to make my torrent downloads go as quickly as possible. Thanks...
,kriegerg69,2010-10-08T05:36Z,"Right now, looking at the info in the upper panel of the program, it's saying it will now take a week and 3 days to get this. The Up speed is running much higher than the Down speed."
,jackalope77,2010-10-08T06:39Z,"Downloads are restricted by the available bandwidth.  Rare torrents like this one with download much more slowly, as not many people are contributing to the bandwidth pool.  To change max DL or UL speed, right click on the appropriate section on the bottom right corner of the window. This will not make a dramatic difference, but need to make sure UL isnt sucking up all the bandwidth to allow the program to run normally.  Other than that, not much you can do as you are limited by how fast others are uploading.  It will vary from time to time as more seeders/leechers appear."
,kriegerg69,2010-10-08T06:48Z,"Thanks, Jackalope....that did it. The download speed just changed drastically. I may have the upload speed set too low, but I'll let this thing run overnight and see how it goes. I can change the upload speed later on."
,jackalope77,2010-10-08T07:32Z,Hope you enjoy.  Please seed to a 1:1 ratio.
,trytryagain1,2010-10-09T07:02Z,"Hey is anyone seeding this collector's edition besides me?  I would hate to see this thing die.  Especially so close to Halloween, I mean this is the season for these movies.  I am going onto my sixth day of seeding and it seems like everyone is just taking and no one is giving back.  I hope I'm wrong.  Thanks again for the one Jackalope."
,kriegerg69,2010-10-09T14:20Z,"@Trytryagain: I believe I'm seeding it (hopefully doing so correctly)...I finally finished getting this last night with BitTorrent, and right now the status of it in my BT program says it is seeding.

Thanks again, Jackalope! I watched it last night...I still have the laserdisc version, but it's great to finally have the DVD release. This was a nice, early Halloween treat!"
,trytryagain1,2010-10-09T17:23Z,Thank you so much for the response.  I forgot how long it took me to dl this one.  Well it was worth wait.  Thanks for the reminder.  I really forgot how long it took.  Well with that said I guess we should keep on seeding.  
,jackalope77,2010-10-09T20:16Z,"I am still seeding it as well, as I usually keep seeding my own torrents for several weeks after they finish uploading.  Looking at Bittorrent, it says there are 3 seeds connected at this exact moment, so I guess we know who they are.  Thanks guys.

@kriegerg69; As long as you are still uploading the finished file, you are seeding.  The more you increase your upload speed, the faster other people can download.  That's all there is to it."
