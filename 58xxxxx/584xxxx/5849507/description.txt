Night of the Living Dead (1968)

This is THE DEFINITIVE EDITION of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead. This dvd is the Millenium Edition, released by Elite Entertainment and represents the film as Romero meant it to be seen, not any of the butchered versions that have been released over the years. See the cover image below for Romero's own endorsement of this cut of the film. I had a hell of a time finding this dvd for purchase, so take advantage of my hard work and download it here. And feel free to say thanks, its nice to know one's work is appreciated....
