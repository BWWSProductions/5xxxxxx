,aParadox,2010-09-21T05:50Z,"telephowned: Please, stay on the internet a while longer and learn about how a torrent released will immediately be swarmed by seeds. Especially with season premiers such as this.
More seeds, means slower speeds until those people seed themselves. Only takes hours instead of days, so no worries. Patience is key.
But feel free to rant all you want without actual knowledge, it's all good. :)"
,aParadox,2010-09-21T05:51Z,"Ahaha, instead of seeds I meant leechers. Oooops."
