Here ya go, a shedload (ok, 271) UK TV adverts from the 1980s.


You may have seen some of these onwell guess where they originated, yup, they were uploaded copies of the AVI files in this torrent, but not all are onbecause some weren't uploaded and some were removed.


Share, enjoy, remember the good old days :)
