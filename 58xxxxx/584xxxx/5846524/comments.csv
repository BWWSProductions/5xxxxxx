To convert into CBR\CBZ:

- Download PDF2HTML
- Simply drag and drop the L4D Comic - The Sacrifice - Part One.pdf onto pdf2html.exe and it will extract the entire document, page by page.
- Now, zip them up and rename the compression file from .ZIP or .RAR to .CBR or .CBZ"

Why use this abusive language when broozz
have got the good taste to share and help the poor in experience ?
You obviously are in the know !
Stop whimpering, you twat !!

Thank you broozz"
,Aardvark47,2010-09-23T18:25Z,"SHARMOOTA -

ur a total, barking mad, certifiable 1st rate horses ass.  you're a definate comic...FREAK.

thanx broozz."
,Crimson-tear,2010-09-24T09:41Z,I actually agree with sharmoota. Cbr/Cbz is the best way too view comics in.
,broozz,2010-09-26T15:31Z,"@crimson-tear

Cbr/Cbz is the best way too go but people asked me if I could make it in too a pdf-file for them, so I did.

thx guys for suporting me but I ignore people like sharmoota cause the are obviously clueless about other people and what they want, he only cares what he wants. he's not worth my time"
,broozz,2010-09-26T15:33Z,"it's now in a pdf format on the site itself.
so they actually listen too people what they want.
take a note from that sharmoota!"
,YanceyLite,2010-10-06T03:02Z,"Here's a brilliant fucking idea. 

Why didn't you just put both filetypes in the fucking torrent? That way, people who don't know how to use .CBR or .CBZ can use the PDF, and others don't have to fuck around with the PDF to get it to read in their readers.

Just a thought."
