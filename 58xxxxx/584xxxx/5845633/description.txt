Secrets of a Back Alley ID Man: Fake ID Construction Techniques of the Underground

Find out how crafty counterfeiters stay one step ahead of the bureaucrats and security professionals and readily replicate driver's licenses, birth certificates and other supposedly "secure" identity documents. In Secrets of a Back-Alley ID Man, Sheldon Charrett (The Modern Identity Changer and Identity, Privacy, and Personal Freedom) will show you the most effective "new school" and "old-school" techniques for new IDs, as well as poor man's tricks for those on a tight budget; the latest printers, scanners, cameras, software and other equipment used to forge IDs; groundbreaking research in hologram reproduction; simple and quick methods for producing do-it-yourself templates for licenses and official seals; ways to make composite IDs using a standard 35mm camera; and the availability of ready-made IDs on the Internet and other sources. Plus, for the first time ever in print, are precise instructions on how metallic holograms and repetitive lettering are done at home. Also included are difficult-to-find driver's licenses backs, which are nonexistent on the Internet and ignored in other ID books.
