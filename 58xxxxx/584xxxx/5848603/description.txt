    The second part of the BBC Natural History Unit's          
    wildlife adventure series following an expedition to      
    search for tigers in the Himalayas.                      
                                                              
    The team strike out from base camp to track down tigers    
    throughout Bhutan. Kayaker Steve Backshall heads to the   
    eastern jungles, and is pushed to the absolute limit     
    when he takes on a mighty white-water river. Big cat      
    cameraman Gordon Buchanan deploys remote cameras far       
    and wide, and uses a clever fingerprinting technique to   
    identify individual tigers from their unique stripe      
    patterns.                                                 
                                                               
    Meanwhile, biologist Dr George McGavin is on a mission    
    to India, where he finally comes face-to-face with the   
    king of the jungle.                                       
                                                               
    We follow the expedition every emotional step of the      
    way as they strive to find evidence that could help to   
    bring wild tigers back from the brink of extinction and   
    safeguard their future.
