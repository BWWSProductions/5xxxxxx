,BadboyJay55,2010-09-24T08:51Z,How the fuck do I watch this?
,bufster,2010-09-24T09:05Z,"@BadboyJay55 - Download a program called WinRAR, which will put all the files together into a AVI video file... thanks for the upload, currently great d/l speeds. "
,chandlerboy,2010-09-24T09:25Z,Or the uploader could not have been a moron and not rared it up.
,BadboyJay55,2010-09-24T09:26Z,"I have Winrar but when I download the torrent it just shows a bunch of 14 megabyte archives.  

Can someone tell me where I go from here?"
,SaviorOfTheNoobs,2010-09-24T10:23Z,Shift-select all of the archives and extract them to one folder. The folder should have a single working .avi file.
,bufster,2010-09-24T15:08Z,"@BadboyJay55 - You should be able to click anyone of those files to open it in winrar. If not, double click on the aaf-js.s02e09.r00 file. Select the avi file and click extract (in the winrar program) "
,.EzDL,2010-09-24T21:37Z,"You need winrar to extract this.

Once downloaded open the folder, winrar will open , at the top right of winrar you will see ""extract"" click this, choose desktop and click ok.

Jersey shore S2 E9 will be on your desktop in AVI format. : ) "

Seriously, people. Get a Mac already.


LOL WTF ??  So we can be huge faggots ?

This isn't going to help the stupid fucker that doesnt know what to do with RAR files. He could just use Google. No point in paying for an overpriced piece of shit Mac.

Although, Mac's are for idiots so....maybe you've got a point for BadboyJJay25"
,Karreha,2010-09-26T11:33Z,Can someone please just comment on the quality of the DL? sheesh..
