Twisted Metal 2
In concept, Twisted Metal 2 is a demolition derby which permits the usage of ballistic  projectiles. Players choose a vehicle and an arena or a series of arenas in the story mode to engage in battle with opposing drivers. A variety of weapons are obtainable by pick-ups scattered throughout the stage. The objective of the game is to be the last remaining player.

The story follows up from the first game, having a man named Calypso host a vehicular combat tournament called Twisted Metal, which grants its winner a prize: Calypso will grant them one wish.

The plot is set a year after the first game, taking place in cities all over the world.
