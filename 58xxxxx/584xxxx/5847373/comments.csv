Works on Win7 x64 when run using Windows XP compatibility mode!"
,Lickalicious69,2010-10-23T17:22Z,"Yep, all good. Enjoy this great release!"
,DJArgus,2010-10-26T19:40Z,"Sure it works on Win7 in a XP compatibility mode, but did not work nor with Native Guitar Rig interface ASIO driver, nor M-Audio Mobile Pre ASIO driver. Any luck someone?"
