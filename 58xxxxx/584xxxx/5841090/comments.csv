They might have probs with seeding, and other bs, but their files are legit."
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-20T09:17Z,"BTW, why have you been waiting for this ""for ages""?

Didn't this episode air on Thursday?  a few days is not ""ages"".

""ages"" is more like a week, maybe a month, if you're an ADD short attention span ritalin child."
,Halib,2010-09-20T10:55Z,"I meant to say ""for what seemed like ages"" and it was Wednesday, not Thursday. Usually these episodes come online the night after, not five.

Also, I am glad to see it's authentic."
