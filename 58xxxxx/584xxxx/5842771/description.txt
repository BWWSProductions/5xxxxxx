Dragons\' Den

BBC HD - Monday 13th September 2010

It\'s the final episode of the series, in which there has been a record number of investments from the Dragons. Ian Taylor rides into the Den with his mobile video advertising hoarding on a bike. He wants to expand his Wakefield-based business into the rest of the country, but will the Dragons see nationwide potential in his idea? One of the Den\'s youngest entrepreneurs, 20-year-old Jessica Ratcliffe, thinks she has found a way into the lucrative computer gaming market with her online marketplace for selling and swapping used games. Now she wants to persuade a Dragon that they need a piece of the action. Plus another young, but very experienced entrepreneur has an accessory that solves a problem all parents of newborns will relate to - how and where to change your baby\'s nappy in a public environment. But will the multimillionaires recognise the issue, and more importantly, will they spot a money-making opportunity? Also, there is a round-up of the highlights from the series.
