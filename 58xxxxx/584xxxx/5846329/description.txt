In this updated and expanded edition of Laura Berman Fortgang's exemplary business/self-help book, readers will learn:

- how to leap out of that mid-career rut
- how to completely and honestly assess your career's progress
- how to identify obstacles that keep you from reaching your goals
- how to turn your back on what many people might call "success" to discover your true life calling.....................................
