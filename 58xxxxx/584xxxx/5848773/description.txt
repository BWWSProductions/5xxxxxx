"Nepotism"

Michael (Golden Globe winner Steve Carell) 
refuses to fire the new office assistant 
(guest star Evan Peters) after everyone 
complains about his bad attitude. Andy (Ed 
Helms) plays it cool after Erin (Ellie 
Kemper) shows interest in another man. 
Meanwhile, Pam (Jenna Fischer) tries to 
impress Jim (John Krasinski) by pulling an 
office prank of her own.

Enjoy :)
