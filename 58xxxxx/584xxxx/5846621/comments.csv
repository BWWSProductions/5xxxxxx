,themanyousee,2010-09-23T07:00Z,Does anyone know where i can get the 720p of this episode
,SanDiegoBuilt,2010-09-23T07:14Z,Yeah one you click on and the other you do not
,shiiit999,2010-09-23T10:01Z,"When you click on ""Download this torrent"" a popup comes up asking what to do with the file, you usually then click open with utorrent and dowload the file. But when you click ""Magnet Link"" it automatically adds the torrent on utorrent for download. 

Hope i explained ok. "
,coreblimmey,2010-09-23T18:25Z,HEY thanks for taking the time to explain. But WHY bother if thats the only difference? Is there no more to it than that?
