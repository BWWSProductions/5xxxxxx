,heavydiamond,2010-09-24T09:17Z,ok what subs throughout the feature ?
,AnitialD,2010-09-24T15:56Z,I got spaniels subs from subscene and hardcoded them into Heist love release. I'm about to upload V2 with the same subs but smaller. Screens and Sample will be included.
,AnitialD,2010-09-24T15:58Z,Just to clarify the subs are for more than the first scene. More than Visions and other releases.
