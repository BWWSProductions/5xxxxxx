ATTENTION ALL HAVING PROBLEMS INSTALLING:

Microsoft has a little tool that saved my ass during my install, I do not know any other way I could of installed the Win-7 ISO without this tool, but ideally I should of been able to load another OS. but something got in the way.:

Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool
http://store.microsoft.com/help/iso-tool

The tool, when run, will ask for the name and location of the ISO and append a self=boot to the beginning. Once the installation got done with pass 1 and rebooted I had to swap Windows 7 install disc (or USB stick) by removing the install with the MS appended boot with the disc made strictly from the ISO. Just maybe this Microsoft tool could help others to install Win-7, especially handy when having problems formatting in anything BUT Fat32 which will not work, or just can not find a method to kick start the install disc. Just remember you will likely need two Windows DVD, the pure one made from the ISO AND the first DVD which will have this Microsoft tool appended to make it boot-able until it reboots and you can swap out the disc for the pure one made from the iso.

Sorry if I am difficult to understand, as I am very sleepy.

I'll check back here again. Good luck. "

Acum incerc sa-l desccarc, tocmai am luat un bobarnac cu un alt torent sper cu al tau sa fie ok, exista o neintelegere in instructiuni zice ca ""Download and extract using WinRAR"", cred ca ai uitat sa tai asta, deoarece daca este iso, este suficient sa-l scrii pe dvd,nu?

,marflo,2010-10-09T20:25Z,I can tell that I installed on my oem laptop and is working smoothly. I got all updates less that kb971033. If you downloaded it  just not instal and hide it. Do not use microsoft security essential also.Also do not use windows genuine validation tool.

,iwin94,2010-10-10T20:47Z,Do i need to burn to a cd or something before i use it?
,marflo,2010-10-10T22:27Z,"to iwin94;
Yes you have to burn the image, the file with ""iso"" at the end, burn it choosing the option ""burn image to dvd"" on low burning speed, 4x or less, you can find a free burner on filehipo.com or alike, install it and follow the steps that muyrucu explained very clearly.
i myself burned at 4x and it failed, when I burned at 2.4x all got ok."
,Fujirich,2010-10-11T15:34Z,"Followed the install instructions to the letter but when I reboot all I get is a Win7 diagnostics and repair tool. Not even a hint of an option for a fresh install.
I know how to install genuine Windows so I know this isn't meant to be happening!
Suggestions anyone?"

,marflo,2010-10-12T21:15Z,"scooterer

There are lots of issues evn with genuine w7.
I myself bought a cd and a license key that was ok only for less than 4 month then I got that conuterfeit victim message and even I called microsoft with no luck, and it revealed that is very risky to buy any cd and license from internet so if you do not want to spent $2-300, you have to kweep searching on net.
for me it is ok but who knows for how long, I am thinking to buy win7 from microsoft but I am still not sure whether or not is worthy.
This torrent seems to be the best for oem. It is the first install that I got working on my xp dell pc network. "
,doublea88,2010-10-13T00:12Z,"I currently am running windows 7 ultimate but it now says this copy of windows is not genuine.  Now my question is this, can i run this and upgrade to the OEM windows ultimate that is in this torrent?  Also, what if i just run the ISO using magic disc? Or is it required to use a Burned disc? Last question, i want to make my computer genuine running windows 7 and still keep all my files and settings, i have over 200gb of stuff on my hard drive and installing a clean copy is not an option.  Thanks so much muryucu for the upload, we truly appreciate it.

*i have bought 3 keys on ebay that worked at first and then showed to be fake after a few months :("
,marflo,2010-10-13T00:51Z,"doublea88

Try to partition your hdd.Save your 200gb of stuff on one of partition, that with no os. Do a clean install you need to burn iso in order to do it, follow muyrucu instructions and do not install update kb971033 and I think you will be ok, but if you check microsoft site they claim that win 7 is able to do something to see whether or not your win 7 is or not genuine in time.Good luck."
,pelermon,2010-10-13T16:04Z,"SOB - I did not check ""let me choose"" update on my desktop, (I did on my lap)
It downloaded # KB971033 last night.
Tried to uninstall -- TO LATE -- doesn't matter.
I hope that Windows Loader v1.9.2  works !!!!
"
,doublea88,2010-10-14T06:04Z,"For everyone that has the problem with windows saying ""This copy of Windows is not Genuine"" or that you need to activate, you dont need to download this torrent (even though its really good for those that want to do a clean install).  To solve the problem of windows saying its a counterfeit or you need to activate, just google ""Windows loader V1.6.7"" and install that and Viola! Once your computer restarts , it will be activated."
,asmircar2,2010-10-15T09:52Z,"This is bulshit !!! If you dont download this update KB971033 you cant download from microsoft site.
Becouse if you want to download you need to have
this update on your PC !! That means you cant download XP Mode  !!!!! So what do i do ? WTF"
,marflo,2010-10-15T17:19Z,"To:  asmircar2
Why do you need xp mode?If you choose win 7  then go for it! 
Why is bullshit?
We were told about limitation of this torrent!
read before downloading and leave aside any frustrations, otherwise go and buy it from Microsoft."
,marflo,2010-10-17T17:28Z,Yes you can use remove wat or some loaders but this not solve the genuine issue; all activators allow user to have win 7 but you cannnot say that is a really activation.

i also tried to start in safemod now i see the ""setup is preparing your computer for the first time"" screen but i get an error after about 5 seconds saying ""Windows cannot complete installation in safe mode to continue installing windows, restart the computer.

You might need to burn another dvd. It happened to me when I first tried to install, the installation stopped, unfortunately i don't remember in what step of it, but it is worth to give  a try again with another dvd."
