Seriously I actually cringed, dont waste your time"
,PhilnLisa,2010-09-24T23:16Z,"Are you kidding me? This is Shatner, he can pull anything off! This was the pilot, and it wasn't brilliant by any means, but I guarantee this show will pick up!!

This certainly aint the worst way to spend a half hour!"

,serialoverflow,2010-09-25T21:54Z,"Wow, this has got to be one of the worst TV shows I've ever seen.
Don't waste your time on this one.

Thanks for the upload though."
,nefisto,2010-09-25T23:52Z,it has some awkward bad moments but overall a solid first ep. i'll buy the fucking dvds when they come out. shatner rules. yeah.
,moldybudz,2010-09-26T16:30Z,"The show isn't that bad. Shatner holds it together because he IS a good actor and has funny lines. The problem is with the rest of the cast. Will Sasso and Nicole Sullivan from MAD TV aren't the worst, but they are playing the same characters they have ALWAYS played on MAD TV. Nicole Sullivan's mannerisms, even her voice, is the SAME as it was for all her characters on MAD TV. It's really sad they couldn't find actors with a more broad range of acting ability.

The son is what really kills it. This kid is a wet blanket. His poor acting ability puts a dampener on the whole show. Some of his lines made it painfully obvious that he isn't a good actor, as they stuck out like sore thumbs saying ""I CAN'T ACT!"".

Hopefully the show keeps getting better and, if they don't replace the actor who does the son, the actors get more comfortable with their roles which ups the funny and believability of the show.

It had its moments for sure. Anything with William Shatner can turn out amazing. Look what he did for Boston Legal."
,StayWay,2010-09-27T19:18Z,waste of time.. twitter was fun..
,acenoise,2010-10-01T02:31Z,"Well the comments are mostly negative! but ive decided to give it a try anyway, ill get back to you with my own verdict soon :)"
,5iTH,2010-10-06T18:36Z,"William Shatner is pure genius in this role in my opinion!

Thanks as always to the quality of EZtv! :D"
,logtran001,2010-10-18T13:43Z,"Funny show, but the network's stupid for putting it up against 30 Rock - it's gonna lose. By next season (if there is one) it'll be on at a different time slot.

And you are right, the son (Sadowski) is the worst actor on the show."
,Pendaws,2011-01-19T00:20Z,I will give it a try. :)
,dritgo,2011-01-20T03:17Z,tnx again EZTV  :)
