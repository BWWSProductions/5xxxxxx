The sea has many secretsÂ…An all expenses paid invitation to spend vacations onboard the Mary Celeste II on her maiden voyage proves to be too tempting to reject, even for Mary Morehouse who is afraid of the sea since childhood. The joy of the adventure is however soon destroyed by a raging storm and the mysterious disapearance of the crew. Will Mary Celeste II share the fate of her unfamous predecessor, found in 1872 near Gibraltar with noone on deck? That would surely not fit MaryÂ’s plans, so youÂ’d better help her to solve the riddle in this thrilling, hidden object game.
