The bestselling The Millionaire Next Door identifies seven common traits that show up again and again among those
 who have accumulated wealth. Most of the truly wealthy in this country donâ€™t live in Beverly Hills or on Park Avenue-they
 live next door. This new edition, the first since 1998, includes a new foreword for the twenty-first century by Dr. Thomas J. Stanley.

How can you join the ranks of Americaâ€™s wealthy (defined as people whose net worth is over one million dollars)? Itâ€™s easy, say
 doctors Stanley and Danko, who have spent the last 20 years interviewing members of this elite club: you just have to follow seven
 simple rules. The first rule is, always live well below your means. The last rule is, choose your occupation wisely. Youâ€™ll have to
 buy the book to find out the other five. Itâ€™s only fair. The authorsâ€™ conclusions are commonsensical. But, as they point out, their
 prescription often flies in the face of what we think wealthy people should do. There are no pop stars or athletes in this book, 
but plenty of wall-board manufacturersâ€“particularly ones who take cheap, infrequent vacations! Stanley and Danko mercilessly show
 how wealth takes sacrifice, discipline, and hard work, qualities that are positively discouraged by our high-consumption society.
 â€œYou arenâ€™t what you drive,â€ admonish the authors. Somewhere, Benjamin Franklin is smiling...................
