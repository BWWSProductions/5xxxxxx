The book begins with a historical overview of research on the hand and a discussion of the hand's 
evolutionary development in terms of anatomical structure. The subsequent chapters review the research
 in each of the four categories along the continuum, covering topics such as the intensive spatial, 
temporal, and thermal sensitivity of the hand, the role of hand movements in recognizing common objects,
 the control of reaching and grasping movements, and the organization of keyboard skills. Jones and 
Lederman also examine how sensory and motor function develops in the hand from birth to old age, and
 how the nature of the end effector (e.g., a single finger or the whole hand) that is used to interact
 with the environment influences the types of information obtained and the tasks performed. The book
 closes with an assessment of how basic research on the hand has contributed to an array of more applied
 domains, including communication systems for the blind, haptic interfaces used in teleoperation and
 virtual-environment applications, tests used to assess hand impairments, and haptic exploration in
 art. Human Hand Function will be a valuable resource for student and professional researchers in
 neuroscience, cognitive psychology, engineering, human-technology interaction, and physiology......
