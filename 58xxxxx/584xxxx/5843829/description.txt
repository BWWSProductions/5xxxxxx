The beach is hotter at night! Baywatch Nights is a spin-off show from the popular syndicated series Baywatch. The series stars David Hasselhoff as Mitch Buchannon, who operates a private detective agency. After the first year, the series took on a different focus for the episode plots with many of them focusing on the occult and similar themes.
The original premise of the show was that, during a midlife crisis, Sgt. Garner Ellerbee, who was the resident police officer of Baywatch since the beginning of the series, decides to quit his job as a police officer and form a detective agency. Mitch Buchannon, his friend from Baywatch, joins to support him and they are in turn joined by a detective named Ryan McBride. Singer Lou Rawls, who starred in the first season, performed the series theme song, "After the Sun Goes Down".
