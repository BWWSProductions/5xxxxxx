A cross between modern prog rock like Porcupine Tree and indie rock, with this album Mercury Rev created something new and unique. It sounds big and like prog rock, but none of the songs exceed 5 minutes and we never get into long solos or pointless instrumental passages. There's not many distorted guitars either. The songwriting is also very strong, both on the up tempo stuff such as "Arise" and the ballads "First-time mother's joy" and "Vermillion". It's also sung by a voice that doesn't get on my nerves after only a couple of listens, which is a very rare thing nowadays. I remember being blown away by the album when a friend of mine played it to me in early 2005. For some strange reason I forgot about it, but fortunately I got back to it recently and I'm really enjoying this album again.
