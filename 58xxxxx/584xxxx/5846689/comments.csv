,tazmo5,2010-09-25T10:06Z,killersweet why dont you try downloading it before saying its fake you dick this is real have downloaded and watched it good copy as well
,spygame2330,2010-09-25T11:00Z,Video is awesome but the the audio is pretty bad. The dialogue is really quite and the action parts are way loud. Not something I have come to expect from raymondhome. Thanx for the upload anyway.
,geluidsdemper,2010-09-25T14:26Z,it's prob. 5.1 wich means that you have to tell your pc to surroundmix to stereo and then the center dialog and the effect sounds will have the same volume level.....
,henry76,2010-09-25T17:54Z,Thanks...:)
,El-Quinto,2010-10-13T08:09Z,"quality is good, but the movie is retarded."
,metalgearshadow,2010-10-18T16:31Z,"!WARNING!

Downloading this will have those bastards pirate haters emailing you about infringement and crap. I got an email through my ISP saying they got records of downloading this. Just wanted to give a heads up."
,scum666,2010-10-21T03:48Z,Utter bollocks!!! Waste of film this is. This has nothing on the original.
,Scarbonum,2010-11-06T14:15Z,"Excellent job and thx for the upload!

,6wicked66,2010-11-14T06:34Z,"metalgearshadow:
     If your ISP is sending you emails about copyrighted materials, then you need a Blocking program like Peer Guardian"
,free-culture,2011-01-29T18:44Z,"Peer guardian is kind of ok (better than nothing) but dont get a false send of security with it... its kind of like a raincoat, you are going to get water on your shoes if you go into a puddle.

Get yourself a VPN connection from someone like iPREDATOR, thats more like a tank while the anti piracy morons are coming on bicycles to give you notices ;)"
,Gid1978,2011-03-23T19:35Z,"why do you people think this is a movie review site?? as long as the torrents good, thats all that matters. get a life!!!"
,diggerRACT,2011-05-24T14:25Z,peer block is the best peer guardian no longer updates its blocklist so they have been sending new customers to peer block just set ur block list to p2p it sets up list for you and updates the list automatically for u every 2nd day or when they find a new anti p2p ip address.... downloading this now cheers didnt even know there was a sequeal to this cheers in advance
,Yenrock7,2011-08-11T10:35Z,thank you raymondhome for all your wonderful torrents!

V-8

Movie: Dismal, failed attempt to cash-in on cult-status success of original movie. Unlike the first movie, there's no mystery, tragedy, sense of isolation or cameraderie. This is just a piss-poor 'vampire' movie with a terrible script and a very weak plot. Avoid!"
,5p1n47,2012-03-12T23:02Z,"I love how everyone is all ""This Movie Sucks, First one was way better""

When actually the first one is more of a ""Critical Success"" it does not follow the comic well, where this Sequel works with the Dark Days Volume of the comic SO WELL.
