Synopsis: 	

Wheeler and Danny are two salesmen who trash a company truck on an energy drink-fueled bender. Upon their arrest, the court gives them a choice: do hard time or spend 150 hours in a mentorship program. The unruly duo jump at the chance to get out of jail, but find themselves reconsidering their decision after one day with the kids they have to mentor.
