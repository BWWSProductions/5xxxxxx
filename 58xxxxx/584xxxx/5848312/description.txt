- 1978 - Green -

Though Hillage stepped slightly into commercial fields and more radio friendly outputs after FISH RISING, the fourth solo album represents his most ballanced and homogeneous work so far. His siren sounding glissando guitar and Giraudy's spacy synthesizers are mesmerising the listener stronger than ever.
