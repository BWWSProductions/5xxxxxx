--------------- Info ----------------
A fine selection of pieces excerpted from the chamber ensemble, solo and opera repertory. Some recordings, though 

from paramount artists, are elderly; yet, performers are anyway flawless. It may be objected that a few of 

Vivaldi's masterpieces were disregarded.
