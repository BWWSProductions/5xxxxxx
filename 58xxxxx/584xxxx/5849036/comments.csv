These guys were pioneers in the progressive rock genre and my hat goes off to Zibbik for giving us the opportunity to hear all their studio recordings. And of course, thank you Pirate Bay! You guys rock!  "

,fiddler7,2011-11-05T08:04Z,"Great upload !
But why is Pictures at an exhibition the live version (I assume at the Lyceum ?)
I really think the studio version has superior sound quality."
,fiddler7,2011-11-05T11:19Z,"Sorry, my stupidity - the original release is live as well - there is no studio version !"

,Superdoer,2012-01-29T19:28Z,"THANKS A MILLION FOR THE TORRENT.

Something seems to be wrong with Better Days on Black Moon though.  It cuts out randomly like it's corrupted.  "
,bangdrum6,2012-03-18T03:42Z,The great studio version of Pictures is from In The Hot Seat and also on Return of the Manticore...  maybe  a few other releases also
