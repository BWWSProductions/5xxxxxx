,dkhere,2010-09-24T06:54Z,"Can you upload this movie: ""Bicentennial Man"""
,jarman007,2010-09-26T16:31Z,"thanks
great quality in such less size

@gunnersrock
when can i post requests for movies"
,ruudsach,2010-10-04T19:29Z,"Can I see snapshots or screenshots of these movies?

Its unbelievable that you provide almost 720p rips, FOUR-SIX times less than original size.

Please also provide some screenshots of these so called great rips for such small size.

Even RMVB gives this size [300~450MB] but has rendering issues with every player except MPC, and that too is a re-enc of DVDRip.

If ye are busy, which I count that you are, some of your fans who have downloaded this great HD rips kindly upload some screenshots and provide its links here"

,lonnrot,2010-11-06T19:51Z,"Watched the entire film, here my review:

Video: 8
Audio: 6.5

The video quality is great for the size, but there are moments when there is low light, the image gets a bit washed, blurry. But most of the film there are enough constrasts to make it look sharp.

The audio quality is 2 Channels, and is far from great, when the volume goes to loud there are horrible distortions, and the audio source is not clean enough, it appears like it was taken from an VHS release.

Bottom line, this certainly is not Brrip, most likely HDTV, with outstanding quality compared to the size, if you don't mind the audio quality which is average, then you will enjoy it."
,WeedPirate,2010-11-27T05:26Z,"i don't care, i like the small file sizes.. easier to DL and seed, so if you want a True Blu-Ray Rip that's like 4GB, you can get those too.. it's good to have options though.."
,mizzllat,2011-02-22T02:28Z,"Love having the option of this small rip.  I do not burn to disc, but store the movies I like on a hard drive, for later enjoyment.  Doesn't have to be home theater perfection.  For me, size means a lot, and so I greatly appreciate having these smaller files to work with, especially on these older films."
