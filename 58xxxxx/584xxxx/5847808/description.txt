Release notes:

Recorded in Tempe, Arizona at the band's Unit 2 studio, Jimmy Eat World reunited
with Mark Trombino, the producer on the band's breakthrough album, Bleed
American, and their seminal earlier albums, Static Prevails and Clarity. "We're
very excited about Invented," said lead singer and guitarist Jim Adkins, "It was
great reconnecting and creating an album with Mark Trombino, we can't wait for
our fans to hear it." Fans will get their first taste of Invented when the first
single "My Best Theory" hits the airwaves in August. Jimmy Eat World has a
stellar history across Modern Rock radio with five top 10 hits.

Invented marks the band's first studio album since 2007's Chase This Light which
landed Jimmy Eat World's highest chart position of their career at #5 on the
Billboard 200 Album Chart. Jimmy Eat World's last release may have been three
years ago but they've been busy. The boys took a break from the recording of
Invented to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of their influential album,
Clarity with a sold out national tour.

Enjoy!
