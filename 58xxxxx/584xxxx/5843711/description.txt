"Now What"

In the aftermath of last season's emotional 
finale in which House and Cuddy admitted 
they had feelings for each other, as Season 
Seven begins, they are exploring the 
ramifications of those feelings and 
attempting to make a real relationship work. 
Meanwhile, due to a colleague's illness, 
Princeton Plainsboro is left without a 
neurosurgeon on site, threatening the 
hospital's accreditation as a Level 1 
Trauma Center. As the team attempts 
treatment to get their sick colleague back 
to work, they discover there is more to the 
illness than they originally suspected and 
turn to House for direction. Instead, House 
remains elusive, leaving the team on its 
own.

Enjoy :)
