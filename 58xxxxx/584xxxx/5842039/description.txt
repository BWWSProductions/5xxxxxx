Synopsis:

"In this outrageous comedy, Kirk (Jay Baruchel, â€œKnocked Upâ€, â€œTropic Thunderâ€), an average guy, canâ€™t believe his luck when the successful and gorgeous babe Molly (Alice Eve, â€œSex and the City 2â€) falls for him. His smart-ass friends, his crazy family, and even his obnoxious ex-girlfriend are just as shocked as he is. Now, see what the critics are calling a â€œrowdy blastâ€* as Kirk goes to great lengths - including some hardcore man-scaping - to make the relationship work and prove that sheâ€™s not out of his league. *Peter Travers, ROLLING STONE"
