,hauntnut,2010-09-21T09:30Z,"Playback on PS3 will give an error code about ten minutes into the movie stating ""The content being played is protected by Cinavia and is not authorized for playback on this device."" How is this possible with a cam copy? I could understand with a DVD or Blu rip that had the actual 5.1 audio stream, but a cam copy?"

basically according to this article, 
it compares ""cam-audio"" to the commercial audio.
thats why you get blocked."
,AoF,2010-09-24T21:22Z,That cinavia thing is a pain in the ass to deal with
,MacMan7,2010-09-24T23:05Z,"@AoF Tell me about it. Pisses me off, damn audio watermarking shit."
,MacMan7,2010-09-24T23:08Z,"By the way, while I'm here,

Does anyone have any suggestions of the BEST software to burn films I download from TPB to disc?

I'm currently using Roxio Toast, but am finding the quality when burning it is not very good, it is rather ""blocky"" so to speak, even when on the highest quality settings with no compression.

Any ideas would be great"
,neblin7,2010-09-25T14:07Z,Todger's opinion about those complaining about free movies is more than valid.  Who takes the time to bitch about free stuff? Brats and children.  So maybe its just a child complaining since they have no idea how much life really costs.  
,kadeem14,2010-09-25T20:31Z,showing good a bit dark do and the audio aint that good but atleast you can hear what there saying
,mugsyny,2010-09-26T07:55Z,cool im downloading now
,PMac85,2010-09-28T18:59Z,"Just because someone gives something a low rating, and states whether they believe it's watchable or not, doesn't mean they're bitching... They're helping others decide whether or not to use up their bandwidth by downloading the movie.

I, for one think that when someone writes a comment like: ""A-3/V-5, very dark. not very watchable"" or ""hard to hear"" or something like that, it's a lot more helpful than: ""Would you people stop bitching?!??! You can't complain when it's free!"" etc, etc..."
,ragewerx,2010-09-29T23:32Z,"Not bad for a CAM movie. Unfortunately the audio is really unintelligible in certain areas. Maybe someone can get an audio file for this and sync it up? Then this would be a lot better. Thanks for the up Ray it is appreciated!

V = 8
A = 3"
,black0pshd,2010-10-04T05:29Z,"lol at the guy that kept coughing i thought it was in the movie. Cam quality rating
A 6
V7"
,lilkiss,2010-10-06T06:03Z,thank you RH
,SheKillz,2010-10-07T21:33Z,"Hey Thanks for the upload... Decent for a cam rip!

Appreciate it."
,Adosin,2010-10-10T01:43Z,CAM Rating                                                                                                                                            V-6 A-3 Crank up the stereo   thanks for the quick up
,ashling51,2010-10-10T19:21Z,"@MacMan7 I use DVD Flick. It is slow, but it works good, and is easy. It takes me normally about 1 1/2 hours to burn a movie. I haven't been able to find one that is faster and still encodes. "
,MacMan7,2010-10-11T00:34Z,"@ashling51

Thanks a bunch, I'll check that one out. Starting to get fed up of Roxio now. Their products aren't all they're made out to be to be quite honest and I'm glad I never actually purchased it."
,c034lt69,2010-10-11T17:33Z,"just gonna let everyone know i DL this the other day and got this in my email, still a good torrent tho so fuck em lol

,catamaranman,2010-10-17T06:28Z,I would love to know if this is the same source as the imagine release....does the movie skip a few minutes at about 15:20?
,catamaranman,2010-10-17T08:49Z,"BTW this is a poor quality copy.  Video is more than a little blurry and the audio has ""buzzes"" in it sometimes several in a minute with loss of sound.  Also there must have been a flu outbreak among the people in the theater, there is lots of coughing...at least there is not 25+ minutes missing like the IMAGINE release....."
,xxxxxjmxxxxx,2010-10-23T03:57Z,"its a cam rip, not dvdrip...
a=5, v=5
this is Devil(2010)
well maybe it's new in showing that's why there is no dvdrip yet...let's just wait guys"
,trentBurton,2010-10-24T18:28Z,"video quality is not so good, not bad to watch it. But audio is terrible, speech is quiet and other sound is too loud!!!"
,Legend30,2010-11-10T19:24Z,Where's The DVD Rip ????? Please someone upload it :)
,Omen89,2010-11-14T23:48Z,"yeah, well, it's not horrible, but I've seen better cams. This one is cropped on sides(V 6/10), and has quite bad sound (A 3.5/10) but it's watchable."
