,blazzoflazzo,2012-02-15T07:31Z,"Hey Crossroads36, don't be a completely stupid half-brained moron, ok? Come Dancing is on the album State of Confusion. It's right there in the file list. Somebody's giving you 25 albums for free and all you can do is pick out sone single song you heard on the radio a long time ago and whine that it's not there. Even though it's there. Does everybody in your family have a small penis like that?"

and by the way blazzoflazzo (nice handle) time to get a few posts of your own. Even sekander is doing better."
