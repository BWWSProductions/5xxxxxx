I am also downloading and encoding stuff for you guys like crazy. I am constantly filling up my hard drives, and I bought another 1TB hard drvie. I am doing my best to fill everyones requests, and in the meantime, I am trying expose everyone to my personal taste in tv-shows, movies, and porn. lol.  I am also trying to widen everyones horizons / preferences and help you consider watching things that you might not have watched without someone insisting. (^_^)
