Also, sorry I have not uploaded anything the last 2-3 days, as some of yall know, I have been sick, so I was taking so much needed Rest and Relaxation. But now I am back and ready for uploading. I am not 100 percent, but hopefully in 2 weeks, I will be.

Next to be uploaded is Knight and Day (R5) and a few episodes, also I will encode Machete (R5) tonight and have it up in the next 24 hours."
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-24T00:36Z,"Also yesterday, I went and bought myself a 120GB PS3 as a late B-Day present to myself. It is at the right firmware to hack too.  (^_^) 
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it. I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! "
