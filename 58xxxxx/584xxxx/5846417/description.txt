The Format was an indie rock band formed by Arizona natives Nate Ruess and Sam Means. The band announced a hiatus on February 4, 2008. Their style can be considered a mixture of indie, alternative, punk and folk music, with elements of 1960s and 1970s pop music.
Though Means and Ruess are the foremost members of the band, they have toured and recorded with Mike Schey, Mark Buzard, Don Raymond, andÃ¢â‚¬â€for the DVD recording and summer 2007 tourÃ¢â‚¬â€The Honorary Title's current drummer and The Format alumnus Adam Boyd. The Format chose their name to make fun of the music industry's inclination towards a cookie-cutter "format" for a hit.
