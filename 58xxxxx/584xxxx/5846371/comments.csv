,kespertive,2010-09-24T23:32Z,"THANKS!!! It works, I had the same problem when the installer wanted to install dx and c++. But I just managed to quit somehow...I just had to copy the crack and it's working. Thanks again this game is soooo awesome :D"
,Gloogloos,2010-09-25T04:34Z,"can someone PLZ HELP, i got the game but no cutscenes and it seems kinda cool and i would like too see em, idk why it wont play them, it just skips or crashes. i havent seen this problem on anyone elses posts so idk why its only me"
,shinnok789,2010-09-25T18:10Z,"Works perfectly. About the directx/visual c++ loop problem: i think it is generated by the new steam installer skidrow used with this release. It probably has a few minor bugs. To get rid of the directx/visual C++ loop at the end of the install, just end the Install.exe process, then click cancel at any window that remained on screen (either directx or visual c++) and it wil not loop again. For noobs, the install.exe process can be found in Windows Task Manager (press ctrl + alt + del) and look for it in the Processes tab. Then just click on it and click the End now button. For the really lazy ones, just restart the computer :) . The game is completely installed before the first loop so there is no problem if you end the install process, the game works perfectly. After that, don't forget to copy the cracked content from the Skidrow folder on the disk 2 to the install directory, and have fun. Thanks to Skidrow for cracking it so fast and to the uploader for bringing it to the masses :)"
,Gloogloos,2010-09-25T18:39Z,"i did all that but i still can only get the menu vids to work, the rest of the cutscenes are out"

D:\PC GAMES\Darksiders\Darksiders.exe

This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect.Reinstalling the application may fix this problem

Installed c++(2005,2008,2010 tried). Dont know what to do. Is it maybe the P4 2.4, 7600GS that i have?"
