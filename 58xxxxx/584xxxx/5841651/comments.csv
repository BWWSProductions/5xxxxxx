And yes, the more recents doomsayers (since early 20th century at least) typically present at least some data that seems to support them. 

Further, such statements almost always include the author's belief that before ""x"" and or if not for ""x"", people would be reading kant, shakespeare, other ""great literature"", einstein, the bible or all these, each according to his values. Not to mention holding deep and meaningful intellectual conversations, creating great art, unfolding the mysteries of the universe, perfecting themselves in prayer and devotion and devoting themselves to works of charity etc. In truth the world stumbles on. Progress in science and other things  is as it has always been the provence of a few. All of  these things are and have been done only by a tiny minority who typically consider that all people could and should emulate their choices, tastes, values, beliefs and choice of avocations.

This is  a well known ""rational thinking"" fallacy. Thinking that the world of one's own adult lifetime is different in critical ways from times past without checking the historical data."

In conclusion :-) 
 The same phenomenon is seen in common and smaller examples such as  many people including journalists believing ""road rage"" is a new phenomenon of the last couple of decades instead of going back much further, that USA school shootings are ""so much worse"" than in the past just because the biggest ever in the US is just a few years ago (yet the second biggest was c 1962 so no it's not really increasing recently in frequency or size out of proportion to population increase  and increased news coverage. The most common of all is the ubiquitous belief that the recent past was ""simpler times, when people had better manners, less worries, better grammar and it rained gumdrops, and gold pieces"""

,p00p3don,2010-09-21T09:15Z,you'd save a lot of keystrokes by reading the book before replying to what you assume is in it....
[V],joshua13,2010-09-21T16:25Z,"what on earth makes you assume I haven't? If YOU have and you don' think the essential message at the core is old hat and suspiciously repetitive of doom prophets of the past, present your view."
