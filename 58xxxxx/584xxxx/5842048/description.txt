 Ik Kudi Punjab Di is the story of a girl who
 challenges the male dominated society of    
 Punjab and wants to be treated at par with  
 the boys. We all say that there is no       
 difference between a boy and a girl but, we 
 all know that truth is something else. Our  
 heroine understands that her struggle is not
 going to be easy but she is prepared to make
 any sacrifice for that. For that she has to 
 fight with her lover, her parents and
