"Pilot"

Robert/Bob Allen is a charismatic and brilliant 
schemer who has meticulously constructed two 
lives in two different parts of Texas. As 
"Bob," he lives in Houston and is married to 
Cat, the beautiful daughter of Clint, the 
patriarch of an ultra-wealthy Texas oil family. 
More than 400 miles away in the suburban west 
Texas town of Midland, he's "Robert," living a 
second life with his sweet, naive girlfriend, 
Lindsay. There he plays the perfect boyfriend 
while secretly bilking local investors of 
their savings. While in Houston, he's a devoted 
husband, charming Cat and her family to cement 
his position in the rich family business he 
aims to clean out. Now caught between a father-
in-law who wants to hand him the company 
business and a father who wants him to take it 
all, Bob has to weigh the risks and make a 
choice.

Enjoy :)
