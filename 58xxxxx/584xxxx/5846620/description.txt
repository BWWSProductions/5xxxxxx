The League Cup steps up a level as the
 Premier League teams involved in
 European football this season join the
 fray - and the draw has thrown up some
 mouthwatering ties.
Scunthorpe United have been handed a
 home tie with holders Manchester United,
 while League Two side Northampton have 
been rewarded with a trip to Anfield to face 
Liverpool. Elsewhere, Spurs and Arsenal 
have been drawn together so expect a fiery 
north London derby from White Hart Lane.

Manish Bhasin rounds up the action.
