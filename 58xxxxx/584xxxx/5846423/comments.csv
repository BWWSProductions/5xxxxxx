[T],xxThugxx,2010-12-19T12:57Z,"redvinta your such a noob, you really should educate yourself before you open you mouth, as already stated Themida is an executable encrypter, therefore triggering a Heuristic detection on your av suite, this is because it has the ability to generate random code, an av suite see's this as suspicious, thats why it detects is as a trojan.gen!! the gen stands for generic, meaning norton didnt match it to any particular trojan just found it suspicious!

,VikingRS,2011-01-27T21:54Z,"This torrent worked fine on WinXP SP3 but the Keymaker.exe crashes on Win7 x64

Any ideas how to make it work under Win7 x64?"
,VikingRS,2011-01-31T01:59Z,"Update about issues running this on Win7 x64

I exported the registry keys from WindowsXP installation located under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\StarSynergy\2\act
and
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Alcohol Soft\Alcohol 120%\Info
using Regedit and imported into Win7 x64. The Alcohol runs, but asks me for registration key. Just press Cancel and it will run fine until closed. When Alcohol is closed it will delete registry keys. This will make the Alcohol act like it was activated, but Hardware Key have been changed due to hardware upgrade or something. Just import the Reg keys again to use it next time and so on.

I wish there was keymaker that can accept different hardware id, as this Keymaker generates keys only for current setup."
