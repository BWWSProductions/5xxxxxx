This torrent includes the "Ultimate Bioshock OST" which I found on another site but fixed up a lot so it is slightly different.

It includes a 2 hour, 38-track score (apparently the official score is 19 tracks).  The official MP3s are 128 while the added tracks are 192 but... anyway.

The licensed-music folder contains 80 minutes in 27 tracks - which is less than other torrents but the quality is consistent at 192.

Also, I include the Bioshock 2 score (Sounds from the Lighthouse) (high quality VBR-encoded) and the Official Soundtrack (encoded at 320), both of which may or may not be available elsewhere but I add here for posterity.
