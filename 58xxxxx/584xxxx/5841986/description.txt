Pilot :
With his firm grasp of the outrageous, Donnell Rawlings (HBOâ€™s The Wire) was born to make people laugh. He grabbed Americaâ€™s funny bone on Chappelleâ€™s Show with characters like Ashy Larry and the distinctively jheri-curled Beautiful. Now Donnell goes even further, taking on the entire American culture with impersonations of everybody from Michael Jackson to Barack Obama, and bringing his audience to tears with his razor-sharp insights and fearless observations.
