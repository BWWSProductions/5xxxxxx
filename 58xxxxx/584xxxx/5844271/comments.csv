,R2d6.51,2011-05-22T06:07Z,"I have been modeling WWII era model aircraft since the early days of Aurora Model Kits in the mid 1950's & I used to have this super reference guide for modeling Luftwaffe A/C. It goes into super detail on mottling paint schemes improvising part construction for custom fabrication to build absolutely superb replica german a/c of the period. 

This is one of the best on the subject you will ever find.

 I lost my copy along with everything else when my home burned down in a wildfire several years back in northern California. Thanks so much for replacing it for me.
Kudos"
