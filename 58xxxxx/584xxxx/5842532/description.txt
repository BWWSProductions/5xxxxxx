Alex welcomes back to the show film-maker, broadcaster and former broker and options trader Max Keiser. Max is the host of On the Edge, a program of news and analysis and he also hosts Keiser Report, a financial tabloid. Keiser formerly hosted The Oracle with Max Keiser  on BBC World News. Keiser correctly predicted the 2008 collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that sub-prime mortgage-backed securities would be the cause of the economic crisis beginning in 2008, and also predicted the banker sabotage of Iceland's economy.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
