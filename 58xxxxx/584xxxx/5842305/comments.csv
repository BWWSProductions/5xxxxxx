ur prints are awesome.. thankss a lotss....
ur subtitle is written even when there is hard sub for foreign language.. ur sub overlaps with the hard sub !! example - Kill Bill 1,2, Expendables..

,FDNG,2010-09-24T10:51Z,"The actual resolution may be 1280Ă720p, but quality is poorer than a DVD. Copoid VHS, I would say. I don't understand why compromise compressions less than 1GB satisfy people. Memory is surely not a problem in 2010."
,nuronocturnal,2010-09-25T12:53Z,thnx man....
,fuckfrank,2010-10-28T11:23Z,"@FDNG

Technology changes, son.  H.264 has a dramatically better compression algorithm than just about anything else right now, so you can get much higher quality video in a lower file size.  A comparable Xvid rip would be at least twice as large.  Why waste your time downloading a 2 GB rip of inferior quality when you could be done and watching the movie in half the time?"
,fuckfrank,2010-10-28T11:23Z,"Also, thanks RiddlerA, this is one of my all time faves!"
,CaptainMidnight,2010-12-06T07:08Z,"Agreed with FDNG. The quality here is awful. High resolution is meaningless if there's a lot of pixelation because the bitrate is too low. Downloaded it and this is definitely much worse quality than my Excalibur DVD. But I should have known better beforehand. A good 720p rip of a feature-length movie is about 4.4GB. There's no way an 800GB file will have any decent detail. In fact, when I encode my own DVDs using x264, an extra-long movie like this comes out best around 900MB-1GB, and that's at 480p, which has less than 40% of the pixels of a 720p rip.

If you love this movie like I do, do yourself a favor and avoid this horribly overcompressed rip. ""fuckfrank"" doesn't know what he's talking about. He thinks H.264 is some kind of magical codec that will allow 15GB HD DVD movies to be compressed down to 800MB with minimal loss of quality. Blu-ray and HD DVD already use H.264! You're not going to compress it to 1/20th of its size."
,traloth,2011-01-10T13:09Z,"I love how people tell us about their NEW way of doing things when it comes to software and computers in general, they invariably turn out, as this mkv file is, to be SHIT! But um thanks for going to the time to upload the torrent anyways consider that a critique of the mkv container and not the uploader! "
,piggypab,2011-02-07T02:07Z,"@RiddlerA
Just want to let you know your uploads are much appreciated! Thank you and keep up your good work!

I use vlc and it works fine but it didn't on this and on a few others. Has anyone else experienced this? What can I do?  cheers"
,danyrx8,2011-02-28T21:42Z,Is there any possibility of adding eng subtitles to this one RiddlerA?
,honunet,2011-04-24T04:29Z,"Awesome quality Riddler, thanks as always.  Don't listen to these dickholes.. They are stupid enough to believe a 720p conversion of 30 year old media will somehow yield 2011 results. As it were, it's crystal clear and thanks for this and all your others.  Especially enjoyed your The Wire series"
[V],DownTYU,2011-05-19T16:56Z,"Hello
I am a wannabe torrent reviewer...
I am really interested in sorting the bad apples from the good one.
I make judgements of torrents (movies)
in the mirror of 1080p quality

THIS ONE IS FINE (according to the container mkv and size)

P.S. If I make a wrong judgement plz comment on my post.
& if the uploader wishes to stop making this kind of review with siree's future torrents.He may ask me to stop and he won't see me again.

I have seeded exactly what I've taken, If I can so can you...Seed what you take.

Thanks"
,CaptainMidnight,2011-07-04T00:16Z,"honunet,

Stupid? The stupid thing is that you think this rip is good. In fact, download one of the 4GB or larger 720p rips of Excalibur and you will see excellent image quality for ""30 year old media."" It makes no sense to download a poor quality 720p rip just to be able to watch it quickly. If speed is of the essence, grab a 1GB 480p DVD rip which will look better because it's not overcompressed. Otherwise, if quality is important, and it must be if you want a 720p video, spring $50 for a 1.5TB drive if you don't have enough disk space and spend the extra day downloading the good stuff. Good things come to those who wait."
,xnuw,2011-09-02T07:08Z,"though your retired, tnx to this one and watch it already quite good A/V 9/9"

,kathiemc51,2012-01-14T12:45Z,"Have downloaded a few coppies of this through the years and this is by far the best I have come across.  People who belittle the EXCELENT work of others, are just showing the world how stupid they really are.  Keep up the good work."
,BesseB,2012-04-12T06:32Z,"Umm to those so worried about the quality: why didn't you just download the sample file first? That's precisely what its there for! Quaity is fine BTW, many thanks RiddlerA. "
,mtbno1,2012-05-04T20:27Z,"quality is great sounds a bit muffled but that was the movie quality then. its fine.


thanks for the great upload
