Not a trusted or VIP member, but he's uploaded stuff for months....  I can't decide whether to trust this or not."
,pickled_egg,2010-09-24T04:58Z,The motherfuckers at TheBox (bunch of twats) will be banning him if he's not carefull LOL
[T],Ferrelas,2010-09-24T05:23Z,"Oh noes! I might get shut off from a tiny insignificant part of teh interwebs! Would be bad if it happened before this stuff ended unless it comes availible some place else though. Oh well, I'll take by chances. :P"
[T],Ferrelas,2010-09-24T06:18Z,"By first real ep I mean it's not the preview, some morons mark that as ep 1"
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-24T06:41Z,"Yeah, well if this is real, like it seems it is, then I hope you don't get cut off.

TvTeam or someone else posted the preview yesterday, but nobody else has posted the first episode yet, besides you.

I've watched the preview 3 or 4 times, it is so fucking hilarious."
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-24T06:51Z,"oh, shit, I'm slow.  I meant ""Is this torrent real"", I wasn't questioning the description.  I knew what you meant, as far as it being S01E01, not the preview posted yesterday.

Since you don't have a skull and crossbones next to your name, it is hard to judge if you're a legit uploader or, like most others, just posting garbage.  I hope you know what I mean.

Since you are responding to comments, I'd have to presume you are legit.  Spammers and virus uploaders tend to hit and run."
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-24T07:59Z,"Stuck at 51.6%, along with a whole bunch of other people."
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-24T10:32Z,"I was able to preview, and it is the real deal.

However, it is taking forever to download.  

I'm not sure why there are 25 seeders, but I can't connect to anyone but peers, and all of them seem to be stuck at the same % as me.

If you're the only one uploading this show, I hope you work out things so that it doesn't take several hours to download in the future.   

This show is too funny to miss out on.  Keep doing it. Maybe find a few helpers you can upload to privately before making the torrent public, to speed things up, or something."
,chandlerboy,2010-09-24T11:31Z,Really struggling to finish the download. Stuck at about 80% for ages now.
,gbr4d,2010-09-24T11:35Z,Come on guys......only two seeders ffs
,ploko,2010-09-24T11:48Z,"Thx mate, don't listen to those stupid manc twats."
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-24T11:53Z,"come on, 99.1%, 3.00 mb remaining. 2 hours 15 minutes, for a file that usually takes 15 to 20 minutes.

seriously.  this is like the bs that TvTeam pulled a few weeks ago."
[T],Ferrelas,2010-09-24T13:58Z,"Sorry for the slow uload, got shit dsl over here, and I had to turn of the computer to sleep last night, seeding all daytoday though, and I thought it was ok since t showed 5 seeds when I quit."
,mc_homes,2010-09-24T14:20Z,"thanks!  downloaded very quickly, over 500 seeders.  Funny show.  and yeah his head really is shaped like a fucking orange!"
[V],neon,2010-09-24T16:36Z,its real alright....fast download too...thanks Ferrelas
,pimp-dan,2010-09-24T22:51Z,"Great quality, was amazed to see it up to quickly and enjoyed watching it thoroughly. Hope to see the next episode up too.

Keep up the good work :D"
,Flukerence,2010-09-25T01:54Z,"its the real deal

A10 V10"
,cortez_the_killer,2010-09-25T06:09Z,"PhilLesh12 - You're a twat. Your download speed is slow because you've set your upload speed at the minimum. Perhaps if you stop being a selfish prick and let others use your connection (as you are getting this for free) then you will get 650kbps like me. Downloaded this in 10 mins, thanks Ferrelas!"
[T],Ferrelas,2010-09-25T10:14Z,"Gonna do my best to keep from getting banned at the box, it might get up even sooner next week as I've figured out where to get it and when it's out :)"
,Mainers,2010-09-25T11:59Z,"Good quality upload Ferrelas , was first up as well, cheers."
,leggett26,2010-09-25T12:30Z,Nice one mate this is awesome and is the real deal. Luv Carl he is hilarious!
,joshua12,2010-09-25T22:29Z,it is the real deal and a great copy. Funny 1
,eduardo5525,2010-09-26T05:47Z,thanks loads mate!! especially for those of us on the other side of the pond. one more step in making karl more famous.
,CM24,2010-09-26T14:49Z,"Cheers for this mate!

Seriously doubted this would make it onto the TBP but yet again The Piratebay prevails!

IT IS LEGIT"
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-01T05:57Z,"@cortez_the_killer

Your the twat.  Ferrelas even acknowledged it was slow.

I'm maxing out my upload speed.  

If you notice, you downloaded this a day after it was uploaded.  I was downloading it just after it went up.  The reason you had such fast download speeds was because people like me were seeding it.

Ferrelas isn't a ""trusted"" or ""vip"" member, so it was a bit sketchy, that was all I was commenting on.  

He's proven himself to be legit, and he explained why things went slow at first.  If you comprehended the conversation, you would have figured that out.

So you are the twat, twat.  Go back to being a twit."
,Amaximus,2010-10-03T18:02Z,"My god, his head is like a fucking orange!"
,polyonymous,2010-10-03T22:43Z,"holy shit i cant belive how orange-like his head is! i thought it was just some fun for a podcast laugh, but no: he doesnt just have an orange-like head, he doesnt even need to change anything to create an illusion of orange-ness. this is unreal"
,polyonymous,2010-10-03T23:02Z,"@cortez_the_killer: commenting on individual torrents is what separates bit torrent from the last generation of p2p, which had a very similar rate of fake/spam/malicious content, but without people whining about quality or whether or not an upload is fake, bit torrent would be just like the bad old days, when you'd spend hours downloading a movie only to find that thae avi was actually 2 hours and 10 minutes of blankscreen. 

i know this sounds very counterintuitive, but being cold and maybe even slightly aggressive in a torrents comments is as valuable as the upload itself. this is the point of letting 'site admins' award uploaders who keep a clean reputation by shining a light on them (the little vip/trusted icons next to their name)

i know it seems wrong, being discourteous to people who bend over backwards to provide us with any media we could ever possibly want, but without people trolling the shit out of disreputable uploaders, itd be almost impossible to discover any real content

...and dont get me wrong, Ferrelas, you fucking rock and i thank you for uploading this!

,highlander777,2010-10-10T19:30Z,"I don't know if this has to do with Gervais or Sky 1 but it looks like they picked the most
poorest/primitive slum in Beijing to film. Most of Beijing is NOT like that. The city is very
modern. I was there last year. The public toilets are regular ones we're used to seeing in the western world.

They must have had to search pretty far and wide to find a bad public restroom for this episode. It was probably in some slum in the poor part of town.

I also get the feeling they wanted to reinforce stereotypes too which really don't exist anymore. Shame on them."
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-12T06:00Z,"@highlander777,

I think it is all part of the point of this show, to use stereotypes and provincialism for humor."
