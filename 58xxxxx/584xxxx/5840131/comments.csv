When I get back I will begin posting Farscape in high quality.  Seasons 1 and 2 have been ripped and encoded...working on season 3 right now.  After all 4 seasons of Farscape are uploaded I will be doing both Stargate Atlantis and Star Trek Voyager in high quality...just not sure what order yet.  Enjoy!!"
,XenoJoker,2010-09-24T17:40Z,"Thanks for all the great uploads meech - go check your PM at the forum. Is Babylon 5 on the list at a later stage?

Its a great scifi series, but the dvd's aren't great quality given when is was made and its native 4:3. So maybe a slightly lower quality setting might do..."
,Balinor13,2010-10-02T06:19Z,"Thanks Meechorno!!

Great quality. I see what the other guy means. For some reason the quality of the original source doesnt seem to be as good as say TNG or SG-1 DVD's that you uploaded. But i disagree with what he said about having a lower setting. I like getting the best possible quality from these shows you are uploading and i would MUCH rather have large files with the best quality possible. 

Thanks and im really looking forward to Voyager and Farscape!!!!!  "

,ulikes,2011-02-11T00:05Z,"These are fantastic rips, thank you so much for helping me complete my Star Trek collection. You are the King!!!"
[T],Filmofiel,2011-03-11T23:52Z,"Great quality dude, i love these torrents. hat about season 1? Are you planning to come up with it soon?"
[T],Filmofiel,2011-03-11T23:55Z,"Ha, ok...i probably didn't clean my glasses too well...season 1 is here, sorry for my interruption...great uploads, you did a fantastic job!"
,erichambydotcom,2011-05-09T07:27Z,Useless due to .MKV format. .MKV is dead dude.
,DragonChaserKev,2011-06-12T01:39Z,mkv is dead?  I thought it was new.  I know the three media players on my laptop all have issues playing it.  These are high quality but mkv is not for me.
,ili2882,2011-07-09T22:37Z,"First a big tanks to meech for the encode and the upload.
mkv is very much alive and unlike mp4 which is a propitiatory format it's open source and free so developers don't need to pay royalties to iso/iec or ieee (actuality apple developed the mp4/mov container but the iso guys in their wisdom made it part of the mpeg 4 standard part 12 I believe), If you prefer mp4 get ffmpeg and convert the files without reencoding with the command
ffmpeg -i Star.Trek.DS9-s07e01.Image.in.the.Sand.mkv -vcodec copy -acodec copy Star.Trek.DS9-s07e01.Image.in.the.Sand.mp4
but you better use a descent player and don't waist your time reencoding, on a pc use mpc-hc, on Linux vlc and enjoy."
,ili2882,2011-07-09T22:51Z,"And a question
I thought that of Star Trek was recorded in Stereo did Paramount reedit the original audio sources to get 5+1? what's the point of 5+1 surround sound for a Stereo source?"
,BOONEDOGSAINT,2011-08-14T19:05Z,Great work and Thank you very much uploader........I have finally finished dloading all seasons and will seed for as long as possible. Is Farscape any good??
