,NarutoNamikaze,2010-09-22T11:13Z,I wish Vettel wins the championship this time.
,NarutoNamikaze,2010-09-22T11:40Z,I wish Vettel would win the championship this time...
,NarutoNamikaze,2010-09-22T11:43Z,"@ electro cute
This is a GFWL game. So maybe you have to create a local profile to enable saves, like it was in DiRT 2.
To make a local profile, press home and go to make a new profile optin. It will take you to a page. Do not create it just then. Scroll down in this page and there would be a hyperlink to create a local profile..
Hope this helps."

,DaiMOn007,2010-09-25T13:41Z,"C'mon guys... This is ridiculous. Almost 1/4 of ppl just can't try the game because it is crashing at the startup.

I've got the same problem you've mentioned. I get a message box (The red circle with an X inside), and its over.

My PC specs aren't too high but it should be enough to run the game at least with minimum settings:

AMD Athlon64 3200+
2 GB DDR400 RAM
Radeon HD4650 512Mb DDR3

I wanted to buy this game, but I won't cause at the moment I can't be sure what is this problem caused by... :(

I anyone could help please do it..."

,murrambingi,2010-10-21T10:53Z,"Invalid product key when trying to use a windows live profile, i tried your instructions using the crack but it don't work, you can play the normal game, but if i wanted to play the normal game i would just play the one i downloaded from here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5891087/F1.2010.CodeMasters.no.crack.needed
the purpose of a crack and key in this game is to play multiplayer online, other wise if it don't work like yours, it is pointless to put it here on TPB, advice to you is to take this shit torrent off TPB, other than that, thanks for the effort in uploading."
,murrambingi,2010-11-06T06:49Z,"Let me reframe that, the purpose of a crack and keygen is for it to work properly, nm the online comment."
,Razyre,2011-04-19T14:37Z,"For those that cannot install this torrent just turn the internet off, install the torrent that has been posted in the comments section, using the recommended serial and finish the installation. Once this is completed, copy the ""1911.dll"" and ""f1-2010.exe"" that are included in this crack into the F1 2010 installation directory in x86 Program Files. Make a backup of ""f1-2010.exe"" first. Once this is done, launch the game. Don't sign into an online account, create an offline one like so below. Hope this helps! Any Q's, send them to ""razyre@razyre.co.cc"""
