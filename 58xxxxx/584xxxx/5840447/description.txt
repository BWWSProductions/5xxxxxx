Tasker is an application for Android which performs Tasks (sets of Actions) based on Contexts (application, time, date, location, event, gesture) in user-defined Profiles, or in clickable or timer home screen widgets. This simple concept 
profoundly extends your control of your Android device and it's capabilities, without the need for 'root' or a special home screen.
