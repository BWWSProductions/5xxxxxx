,eegman,2010-09-21T01:31Z,After installing this it says it is the 14 day trial version
[T],xxThugxx,2010-09-23T13:31Z,"eegman this works fine, ive just downloaded it and tested it on 2 diffrent devices off my friends. if you launch tasker, press menu, go to more and select order validation, it says status validated, if it dosent work for you maybe you didnt uninstall any trial version of tasker before installing this app"
,eegman,2010-09-25T05:16Z,"Thugg,
 No disrespect intended. Just posting my results. I did locate this elsewhere and it installed fine. Not sure what I did differently during yours. I appreciate all of your efforts here. "

,goblue13,2011-01-29T23:37Z,"Cracked, works great. Root users, to get the latest version of tasker:
Install this apk from the torrent
Back it up with titanium
Uninstall
Install the latest version apk from the tasker site and DO NOT OPEN IT
Restore the data only with titanium
Enjoy"
