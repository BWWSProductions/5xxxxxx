"Pilot"

Sean Walker (Jason Ritter), stumbles into 
a national conspiracy after his 
girlfriend Leila (Sarah Roemer) 
mysteriously disappears from a Caribbean 
cruise. Elsewhere, President Elias 
Martinez (Blair Underwood) is scheduled 
to announce the release of a group of 
detainees led by Sophia Maguire (Laura 
Innes) -- despite the disapproval of his 
Director ofNational Intelligence, Blake 
Sterling (Heljko Ivanek). Their futures 
are on a collision course in a global 
conspiracy that could ultimately change 
the fate of mankind.

Enjoy :)
