PrisM Notes:...:
Right, thanks to all for sources... Loaded script into virtualdub, tweaked the colours changing the green blue, and red... pretty weird to filter, cause filtering to much makes other scenes look a little poor... so tweaked colours slightly throughout, increased the brightness a little to make it a lil more watchable. Used a sharpness script, which added a nice touch, and done some other stuff to video... For the audio we used the russian surround channels, 7 parts had russian voice over which were removed, 28 seconds of the english audio was missing from the beggining of the movie... it was fixed... We then added TWIZTED's english track to the russian AC3 Track and muxed together, to bring you a 6 Channel Sweet sounding Audio. Enjoy!
