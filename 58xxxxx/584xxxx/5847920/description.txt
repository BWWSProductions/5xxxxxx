Animal Behaviour.


Animal behaviour is the scientific study of the wild and wonderful ways in which
animals interact with each other, with other living beings, and with the environment.
It explores how animals relate to their physical environment as well as to other
organisms, and includes topics such as how animals find and defend resources, avoid
predators, choose mates and reproduce, and care for their young.


The present book explores the mechanisms and evolution of animal behaviour,
including neural, hormonal, and genetic substrates of behaviour; foraging; anti-predator
defences; mating systems and sexual selection; social behaviour; communication; /
parental care; kin selection and recognition; and territoriality.
