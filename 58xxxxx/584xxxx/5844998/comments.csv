,themasteronetwo,2010-09-22T16:07Z,"Thank U 4 all your work CTANG, I have a quick question 4 u: how or what software do u use 4 movies, i guess that u do it using mac computer? cuz I just bought a new mac and  need some advice about what's good? thanks a lot... keep up,,, Once i learn in mac, I'll help uploading some movies and softwares too..."
,mcthom,2010-09-22T21:46Z,"Ctang, thanks for the good work. I enjoy DVDR releases that keep the extras. I have a computer hooked up to my tv and somehow avi's re-encoded by quality uploaders seem just as sharp as DVDRs. 
Thus, without the extras, there's just no point in dl-ing the DVDR version (my fellow Dutchmen are especially good in creating worthless DVDRs).

Anyways, I am posting here because I would like to request Valentine's Day if at all possible. There's only the pointless all-extras-stripped versions floating around at the moment. "
[T],ctang,2010-09-22T23:00Z,i actually have it on my computers HD and it will be up in probably a few days!!!...i was just planning on putting it on a disc and deleting it but since you requested it i will post it for ya...and it will have almost all the extra's (except for probably the trailers since they rob precious bitrate from the main feature)
,mcthom,2010-09-23T19:35Z,"Thanks a lot! I don't mind trailers being removed.

I download like crazy but I have tons of legal DVDs as well. Everytime I watch a legal DVD those trailers annoy the heck out of me.

Well, that and those retarded FBI warnings. They are retarded because any self-respecting ripper removes them so only honest people ever get to see the anti-pirating propaganda."
[T],ctang,2010-09-23T21:53Z,ya i know what you mean...i cant stand the warnings either...even if i up a DVD9 i always remove the fbi warnings!!! will have it up for you tomorrow...already have it encoded down to dvd5
,Sisko_125,2010-09-23T22:50Z,Hey GREAT WORK and KEEP IT UP!!!! I have 2 request can you try and get Good Morning Vietnam and The Golden Child and IF posible with Eng/Fr and in WS too. THANKS FOR ALL and for what you do!!!

,Sisko_125,2010-09-24T03:30Z,"Ah it's ok but I had to ask but still GREAT JOB and
THANKS for all you do!!!!"

,GUYMOVIE,2010-09-26T13:15Z,hi ctang nice release...u once said next would be independence day..may i know when would u upload it please
,mcthom,2010-09-26T21:19Z,"""will have it up for you tomorrow...already have it encoded down to dvd5""

I'm not trying to be impatient but did anything go wrong with the upload? If it's simply a case of real life getting in the way of a hobby it's no biggie but I was just wondering."
[T],ctang,2010-09-27T22:42Z,"guymovie:  unforturnately someone in my family returned it b4 i had a chance of copying it...i may get it again to copy but no promises

mcthom:  sorry but laptops power cord about burnt down my fiance's house so it has been out of commission til now...will have it up probably later today"
,ironchild,2010-09-28T16:49Z,"Gracias ctang por tus aportes

Ando buscando estas peliculas: 

""the six wives of henry lefay"" 
""Micmacs"" 

No las he encontrado en ningun lado con buena calidad. Saludos."
,mcthom,2010-09-28T18:51Z,"Damn, that's rough. I'm glad you threw in an ""about"" there because it sounds like things could've been much worse.

There's really no need to apologize. This site is meaningless compared to stuff like that."
[T],ctang,2010-09-29T00:40Z,"i am still doing Valentines Day next but then i am doing The Fantastic Mr. Fox and then Caught In The Crossfire...after that i may go back to my upload list or i may do Almost Heroes and The One Who Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest...i will only do them if i have a couple people say that they want them...probably have about a week or so to speak up b4 i delete them from my computer

-ctang"
