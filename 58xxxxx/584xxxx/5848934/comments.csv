,shinobiXRT,2010-12-28T14:25Z,"my mistake, VLC 1.5.1 was the problem, I think the guys behind VLC sold out, they put a load of bum fluff in the new update, I recogmend using the older version of VLC and just play 3GP with another player"

This is the product of someone with too much love for conspiration theories. 

It's a really good comedy though."
,PabloMansini,2011-03-03T21:43Z,"Its certainly interesting, but thier is a molevolent presence of shady corporate types in the music industry. If you dont know about that or at least some of what artists say (behind closed doors) then go bury your head in the sand. Your truly plugged in,like cypher said ""ignorance is bliss"", for some anyway!!"
,prakhar_mishy,2011-03-12T16:00Z,"I think originally this was made by a youtube user by the name of FarhanK something .. It's a brilliant documentary, very well put together. A lot of facts have been used, things that you can easily cross check. Do not reject it thinking that it's some sort of relegious crap, i already know the word that's out there. Watch it and judge for yourself. Please stop discouraging the flow of information."
