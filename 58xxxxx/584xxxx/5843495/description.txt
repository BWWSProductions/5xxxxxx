Transit Transit is the second album by Autolux, released on August 3, 2010, on TBD Records (USA) and ATP Recordings (outside of North America/Japan).


"Audience No. 2" released on May 21st 2008 as the first single. The single also includes the instrumental track "Fat Kid", and a cover of The Beatles "Helter Skelter" as b-sides.
Based on set lists throughout 2008, and as recently as January 2009, Autolux slowly debuted a handful of new songs: "Census", "Kissproof", "Highchair", "Supertoys" (also recorded for Nigel Godrich's "From the Basement" TV series), "The Science of Imaginary Solutions", and "Finder's Fee". Also rumored were older as yet unreleased tracks from the Future Perfect era, such as "Reappearing" (featured in the band's EPK) and "Headless Sky" (debuted live in 2004).
In March 2010, the tracklisting was confirmed.
