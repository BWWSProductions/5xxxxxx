,Enveloppe,2010-09-30T17:51Z,"First, thanks for the really fast upload imr147!

Secondly, I would like to know if it's possible to upload the AIRAC 1010 REV.2 for the PMDG and FSNavigator products. It's seems that there's some glitches with the STARS and the IAP's (mainly around EUROPE and JAPAN).
