,M_J_Luff,2010-10-23T14:40Z,"This worked great for me, I have Windows 7 Ultimate x64.  Today when i opened my computer it said, for the first time, your copy is not genuine.  Dowloaded and installed this, no longer says that.  Also to be sure I asked it to Validate my copy, can back with ""This is a Genuine copy of Windows 7"".
Many Thanks!!!!!"
,ivo1078,2010-10-24T01:21Z,"Works for me!! Window XP service pack 3
The last update triggered the validation message.
After using this patch it's gone.
Just ignore the trojan message!"
,ProtusMose,2010-11-26T20:02Z,"Win 7 ultimate 32. Does not work.
Ran script, restarted. Still got the not genuine notification. No option to validate, just wants me to buy a genuine copy. Didn't get any virus notifications but the script changed IE settings to connect through some proxy server. "

,doser69,2011-06-02T21:05Z,"Of course it doesn't work in Windows 7 you idiots.

This is for Windows XP.

Windows 7 uses a loader instead."
,doser69,2011-06-02T21:06Z,"And Rickinator has absolutely NO idea what he's talking about.

I mean, this guy must have been dropped on his head a lot as a child.

Windows 7 rocks.

XP is good, but very old, and lacking in features.

Vista sucks badly though.

Windows 7 = Very fast.  Better than XP for sure."
