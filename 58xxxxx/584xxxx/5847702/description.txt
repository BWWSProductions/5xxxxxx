Adobe Photoshop CS4 Studio Techniques.



Introduction:

Staring at a shelf full of Photoshop books at the local
bookstore, it seems that there are more special-effect
â€œcookbooksâ€ and technical tomes than anyone would ever
care to read. The problem is that none of those â€œcookbooksâ€
provide enough detail to really let you feel like you
understand the program (blindly following the listed steps
just doesnâ€™t do it), and all of the technical books are deep
into terms like rasters, vectors, and bit-depth settings. Thatâ€™s
the primary reason that most people arenâ€™t truly comfortable
with Photoshop. They either get the 1-2-3 steps (but
no real understanding), or they get so many technical
terms that Photoshop becomes impossible to grasp.
So how is this book different? Our approach is to use the
same language that you use in everyday life, to explain
everything from the simplest feature to the most advanced
techniques. Ben Willmore acquired this approach as a
result of teaching tens of thousands of people in hundreds
of seminars and hands-on workshops. We still provide a fair
share of step-by-step techniques, and we delve into some
rather advanced features, but through it all we use metaphors
and examples that make everything easy to understand
and digest.
Our mission is to help you graduate from â€œIâ€™m just going
through the motionsâ€ to â€œAt last, I really understand Photoshop.â€
Once youâ€™ve made that leap, youâ€™ll experience an
incredible ripple effect. Your effi ciency will skyrocket.
Your costs will decrease. Your creative genius will come out
of the closet like gangbusters, and your clients (or boss)
will be thrilled. But whatâ€™s most important to us is that,
through learning how to master Photoshop, youâ€™ll fi nd the
passion and energy that come from knowing youâ€™re really
good at something.
