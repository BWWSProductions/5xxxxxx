,MJKW2Ab,2010-10-01T08:45Z,"I just realized that based on file size and description I do believe this is the exact file I downloaded from another torrent site. After one month mine is running great in 32 bit on a Dell with only 512Mb memory and a 16Mb dedicated ""ReadyBoost"" stick. It is still certified as Microsoft Genuine! I have downloaded ALL updates except for KB971033 WHICH WILL DEACTIVATE YOUR OS. All has ran much smoother than I ever thought possible for a 523Mb machine. 512Mb is far to less to run 64 bit Win 7 with, but with 32 bit Win 7 all is good.

If anybody here discovers their Windows-7 being deactivate PLEASE post about it here so we can get a heads up for the rest.

ATTENTION ANYBODY HAVING PROBLEMS INSTALLING Windows 7:

Microsoft has a little tool that saved my ass during my install, I do not know any other way I could of installed the Win-7 ISO without this tool:

Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool
http://store.microsoft.com/help/iso-tool

The tool, when run, will ask for the name and location of the ISO and append a self=boot to the beginning. Once the installation got done with pass 1 and rebooted I had to swap Windows 7 install disc (or USB stick) by removing the install with the MS appended boot with the disc made strictly from the ISO. Just maybe this Microsoft tool could help others to install Win-7, especially handy when having problems formatting in anything BUT Fat32 which will not work, or just can not find a method to kick start the install disc. Just remember you will likely need two Windows DVDs, the pure one made from the ISO AND the first DVD which will have this Microsoft tool appended to make it boot-able until it reboots and you can swap out the disc for the pure one made from the iso.

Im not sure Microsoft allows one to download this tool more than once, based on how their agreement is written. So be sure to back it up, it may be needed again if needed for the install.

This method was fully tested with both 43 bit and 64 bit versions of Windows 7 Ultimate and worked perfectly. (just have to remember to swap discs when the install first reboots so it can continue from a disc made strictly from a Win-7 ISO.

Sorry if I am difficult to understand, as I am very sleepy.

I'll check back here again. Good luck. "
,MJKW2Ab,2010-10-01T09:06Z,"Sorry, I'm running with 512Mb RAM Memory. I dislike typos that make one look like an idiot. I have many programs in my start up which are mostly security, maintenance, and media related and the cool Win 7 Resources window reflects that I almost always run below the 512MB ceiling, so I strongly believe that for most home users that play it safe and do not install too many memory wasting programs in their start-up that billions of WinXP users with 623MB memory can ignore Microsoft's advise that one gig is needed, my system is running fast with 512Mn for one month now. The Resources reflects that often times over 80 to 90% of the ram memory may be in use at it's peak level times. It is actually running faster than my previous WinXP did, likely to a lot of malware I could not find or remove. 

So far Windows 7 has been compatible with all of the free security programs I can throw at it and it stil has yet to lock up on me.

People still holding on to their WinXP machines with 512MB memory likely have a fast enough CPU sp I truly believe that many users will be able to dump WinXP and go straight on to install Win-7 32 bit. (Remember to save your Windows XP Product Key # so you can share it with the rest of us!"

,scott977,2010-10-08T13:42Z,"ERROR CODE  0x80070017

If you get this error code while trying to install, dont panic, its very easy to solve.

The problem is the drive being used to read the disc, if it is NOT the same drive that was used to burn the disc then the error code comes up.
I dont know if this is an MS measure or not, but I had the code and eventually removed the drive and used the one I burnt the iso with and hey presto.....installed :-)

Hope that helps someone out"
