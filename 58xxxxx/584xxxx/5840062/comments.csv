[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-10-04T02:34Z,Audio is out of synch.
,semajsyhr,2010-10-26T10:46Z,"Audio out of sync for me too by a few seconds. The first couple of seconds of the video play insanely fast so that it is out of timing with the sound.

Quality of video excellent though."
,semajsyhr,2010-10-26T11:08Z,"Back again... just played the movie in Quicktime and the audio and video sync up perfect.

Also plays perfectly on PS3.

Its just Windows Media Player and some other players that it's out of sync in."
,BodrovJrFan,2010-11-09T03:17Z,"HORRIBLE. the sound and video are very off, and it looks like i was in another language dubbed over!"
