Thanks FXG."
,OG_Triple_OG,2010-09-22T03:36Z,"Whomever thinks this movie is funny is a moron.

 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and confirms that both Jonah ""the whale"" Hill and Russell Brand aren't funny at all unless they have a real lead actor or actress around them. 

Compared to this crap MacGruber looks like an oscar contender. Don't waste your time. "
