I don't know whether you had uploaded it earlier or not, as your rip is nowhere on tpb."

Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers

OK, I'll do it, 'cause old encode went nova, and it was mini indeed, compared to ones we have.
Remastered BluRay, new one, comes, most likely as 320p."

Thanks again for accepting my request "
