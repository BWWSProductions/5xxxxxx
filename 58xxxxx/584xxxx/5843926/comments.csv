,daperdon,2010-09-22T03:17Z,@r3dcat what do i format the external drive to fat32 0r nfts  or using wii backup man can i change an iso to wbfs  file 
[V],r3dcat,2010-09-22T04:53Z,@daperdon: Using ntfs or fat32 partition is a personal choice. Previously USB Loaders did not support ripping games from disc to ntfs (write privileges) but now Configurable USB Loader does. You can use Wii Backup Manager to convert existing game images/files to wbfs files.
