Perhaps the single worst movie of the past decade. Russell Brand is a flaming homo, and this is fact. He has admitted to sucking penis on The Howard Stern Show, and taking it up the bum. Looking at Jonah Hill and his fat for 2 hours is asking too much from any human being. Now excuse me while I have my eye's removed from my head, as I can no longer subject them to such filth and disgrace."

Is this in the encoding or how I'm watching it on my laptop?  Any help would be awesome.  This is happened to me a few times lately watching movies.

,Pro21,2010-09-22T06:08Z,"@terrylad: i had this same problem too at first until i figured it out... first you need to create a torrent through your client software ie. utorrent, bitcomet, bittorrent, etc.. now this is done through some of the program features such as file --> create torrent (or something equivalent...) it's pretty much self explanatory, however all clients are a bit different with their interface when it comes to creating torrent files. once however, when u do successfully create one, make sure you are seeding it via the client and then be sure to log on to TPB and click 'upload torrent'. then you should start having leechers in no time. hope this helps."

@ JackOfficer - Stop trying to create unnecessary drama by saying ""all you fags can suck my dick"" (( which, by the way can be insulting to some )). 

Also, it's pretty pointless to leave a review that has absolutely nothing to do with the torrent but to trash a movie that you haven't even seen. Stop being so immature, please.


@ Inciner8r - I agree with you. 



As for me - I haven't seen this. Downloading for the first time because I want to try it out. I'm sure it can't be as bad as people say. If it is, I'll be the first to eat my own words (( and certainly won't post a rant about it in the comments ))."

COICA

In the United States, a new law proposal called The Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA) was introduced last week, and there will be a hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee this Thursday.

If passed, this law will allow the government, under the command of the media companies, to censor the internet as they see fit, like China and Iran do, with the difference that the sites they decide to censor will be completely removed from the internet and not just in the US.

Please see the following article from the Huffington Post for more information.

Stop the Internet Blacklist

And if you are a US citizen, please take the time to sign this petition
