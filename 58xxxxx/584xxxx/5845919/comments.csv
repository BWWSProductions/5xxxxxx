,AkkiChanX,2010-10-16T19:21Z,"I think standard definition is 480i not 480p, i don't know what the visual difference is, though."
,black0pshd,2010-11-03T04:08Z,480i and 480p are both standard definition. in order for something to be officially high definition it has to have a resolution of at least 1280x720. anything lower is standard def so this would be DVD rip being that it is only 720x304

,jerseyemt,2011-03-18T19:16Z,"Where does it say HD? It is not a DVDrip, it was ripped from a Blu-Ray disc and converted to 480p.

BRRip has nothing to do with HD, it only signifies the source of the video."
,bragazar1710,2011-07-16T03:29Z,thanks.
,Polymathj,2011-09-16T01:24Z,"Yeah, agree on the sound.  It's way late and not all of us watch these on our laptops so no audio switching available.  

Keep looking..."
