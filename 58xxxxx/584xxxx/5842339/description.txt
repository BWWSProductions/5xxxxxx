- 1972 - Space Shanty -
(Japanese reissue 2008)

This mixture of Canterbury Prog, Space Rock and facile Hard Rock approaches is nevertheless an important contribution to the early Seventies' Progressive Rock era. Steve Hillage as the main composer and lead guitarist, keyboard player Dave Stewart, bassist Nick Greenwood and drummer Eric Peachy did a pleasant and respectable job. Despite the often poor song lyrics and some clumsy Hard Rock splinters, the only released album by Khan is a good and worthy example for the Canterbury music style, far apart from beeing tedious or distressing.
