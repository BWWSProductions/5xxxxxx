This torrent is the updated version 1.1 of the newest piece of downloadable content for Bioware's epic RPG Dragon Age: Origins, titled Wtich Hunt, released 20 September 2010.  Bioware has also confirmed that this is the LAST DLC for this game, so enjoy it.

A final confrontation with Morrigan!

"Never follow me." With these words, Morrigan vanished into the shadows. Her plans and her whereabouts have remained a mystery... until now. But whether you seek answers, revenge, or reconciliation with your lost love, you may find more than you bargained for.

To begin the pursuit: From the main menu, select New Game. Then, either import your character from Origins, Awakening, or the Golems of Amgarrak, or create a new, high-level hero!

-=-=Installation=-=-

1. If not already, you MUST update the game to v1.04 for this DLC to work.  You can find the patch easily enough on the internet.  If applicable, apply a v1.04 No CD patch as updating will overwrite the old .exe
2. Locate and run daupdater.exe in the "bin_ship" folder where you installed the game.
3. Click "Select DAZIPs" and select all 4 DAZIP files in this torrent.
4. Highlight all the files in the list and click "Install Selected"
5. Upon completion, run decrypt_all.bat from the "DLC Decrypter" folder of this torrent.
6. Locate AddIns.xml in "C:/(Username)/Documents/Bioware/Dragon Age/Settings" and edit it using Notepad. Replace all RequiresAuthorization="1" with RequiresAuthorization="0".
7. Run the game and check to see if everything worked!  Click "Other Campaigns" and the DLC should be visible and playable.

Cheers mateys!

ATTENTION: If you are getting an error while installing the DLC, it is most likely because the encoding of AddIns.xml was changed to ANSI or another incompatible format. To fix this, open up AddIns.xml in Notepad, go to File>Save As... and MAKE SURE the encoding is set to UTF-8. Save AddIns.xml in the same spot, overwriting the original. This should fix your installation problems!
