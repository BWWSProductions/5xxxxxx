,ykarakis,2010-09-24T08:24Z,"Thanks for the upload dANGER_boy.

i had downloaded the same content of yours on 7th september however it didn't work although i followed the instructions and troubleshooting stated on your torrent. My question is is there any difference from the previous upload?"
,dANGER_boy,2010-09-24T09:34Z,"@ykarakis
This version fixes a few critical bugs missed by Bioware.  As far as installation, the only thing I can suggest is to make sure you are updated to v1.04, and that you followed my instructions for installation errors in the READ ME.  If it still doesnt work, delete AddIns.xml and Manifest.xml and reinstall ALL of your DLC, including the Awakening expansion.

@The4X
Blame Bioware for missing some big bugs.  Otherwise I'd be scotch-free."
,Thompson93,2010-09-24T14:32Z,"Thanks for the help you give us dANGER_boy,
unfortunately there is a little problem about the decrypt.bat of the files.
The decrypt.bat works only for Witch Hunt and the other DLC don't work.
When you have free time, please create:

Dragon Age: Origins - DLC Pack [Updated 20 September 2010]

Thanks in advance..

...English is not my first language Thanks for the understanding..."
,Thompson93,2010-09-24T14:40Z,Thanks !!!
,osodemierda,2010-09-24T21:48Z,"hello thanks for the torrent but can you please upload the patch 1.1 only?
that would be great!"
,mintholly,2010-09-26T06:30Z,Is there any way to just download the patch part of this? I downloaded your earlier torrent from when it first came out and I'd rather not have to download the whole thing again if I don't have to. 
,Timmi245,2010-09-26T11:14Z,"hmm I still can't this one to work, I downloaded your original one that didn't work either.. I've done everything the readme says but it's still coming up as unauthorized.

All other DLC work fine, but this one doesn't.. "
,grey_warden,2010-09-28T13:17Z,"Downloaded and installed, works like a charm...

I have installed both Dragon Age Origins and Awakening (with patch 1.04) also all DLC's that have been released and they work as they should. I've used this method that I want to share with the others:

1 - Install DA Origins
2 - Install DA Awakening
3 - Patch to v1.04 and use the crack that comes with it
3 - Install all DLCs except Blood Armor 1.1 (which I didn't need.) using daupdater.exe and decrypt them using DLC Decrypter (included in packet)
4 - Install Witch Hunt same as other DLCs using daupdater.exe
5 - Decrypt the Witch Hunt DLC using the DLC Decrypter (included within packet)
6 - Open the AddIns.xml using Notepad, press CTRL + H and replace all RequiresAuthorization=""1"" with RequiresAuthorization=""0"" than Save
7 - Enjoy the game

BTW I wrote all these because that all DLCs are of dANGER_boy, I used Skidrow version of DA:O and Razor1911 version of DAO:A and all other pieces are included inside ""Dragon Age Origins - DLC Pack [Updated 10 August 2010]"" by dANGER_boy and finally this one as the last piece.

Thank you dANGER_boy, for this perfect torrent shared also for the Replace All hotkey! :)
Not to forget, thanks to Bioware and EA for this great game... and also Skidrow and Razor1911.

Play it, if you like it than buy it!

I am gonna keep seeding for a long while."
,rnway1212,2010-09-30T04:35Z,"when i run batch file, it says designerplots is not an erf. over and over again

,dANGER_boy,2010-10-04T01:18Z,It has already been decrypted then.
,Shenzz,2010-10-13T14:52Z,"Sweet, thx a lot dude for always bringing the latest DLC and stuff for this games :D"

,Porn_Flakes,2010-10-20T05:18Z,"can someone help me? each time i try to run ""Golems of Amgarrak"", i get a message saying ""Unable to load area"". any sugestions? i had so high hopes for this torrent, all the items worked just fine. 

can it be because i havent finished downloading the entire torrent? i still have a few files left to download, and those are the ones i need to play the other side campaigns, so i havent tried to see if they work yet."
,Porn_Flakes,2010-10-20T06:16Z,"heh, sorry about that.. that comment was ment for your other dragon age torrent :o"
,hakim462000,2010-10-30T02:28Z,"Thank you so much dANGER boy =D, works without a flaw! i'm always seed your torrents since the dlc pack, but is there any prima official guide for awakening you could share? =S, that expansion is a bit confusing...IF you have it =p"

DarkReaper 12"
,dANGER_boy,2010-11-19T02:57Z,"@davidmoreira
There is no ""Awakening"" crack.  Awakening was just a content module like the other DLC albeit bigger.  It did not have a modified game .exe besides the v1.02 patch.  It it's telling you that there is no CD detected, update (if not already) to v1.04 and find a No-CD crack from gamecopyworld.com or another source."
,Hynos,2010-12-19T16:43Z,"Hi,

,Teruke,2011-02-21T08:14Z,"same issue as Hynos, DAO_PRC_STR_1.1 gives an error every time i try to install it; besides this DLC everything is as it should be"
,LeggetMlok,2011-03-06T07:11Z,i also got error when installing and apparently i was a bit tight on disk space make sure u have at least 2gb free on all disks that solved it for me
,Vezim,2011-03-14T17:04Z,"Hi

I have installed the Dragon age: Origins with patch 1.04 but the DAO_PRC_STR_1.1.dazip gives an error and the ""Other Campaigns"" option is greyed out.
how can i fix this? please help"
,SeNtrY_13,2011-03-18T14:16Z,"The key is as someone already mentioned: ALL HARD DISK PARTITIONS MUST HAVE AT LEAST 2 GB FREE SPACE.
It worked for me..."
,Murdelizer,2011-03-21T08:49Z,"Hey there! all your other DA-DLC-torrents worked fine for me, so THANKS A LOT, but I have an issue with this one! like Porn_Flakes mentioned, an an message saying ""unable to load area"" pops up after I chose my character.
can anyone help figuring out my problem? thx"
,Murdelizer,2011-03-21T08:51Z,"Forgot to mention: i updated to 1.04, installed the DLC, cracked the exe. i can also choose ""witch hunt"" in the ""other campaigns""-menu and choose my charakter, but then the ""unable to load area""-message pops up"
,Orion50,2011-05-03T03:03Z,"my mana bars for my characters just disappeared... well there always empty and just not refilling themselves ""visibly"" 

followed instructions to the ""t"", not 100% sure why this kinda error is happening... 

got patch 1.04 installed already"
,Mrita,2011-07-13T00:19Z,"This torrent is dirty. Please do not download. EA is tracking this bitch. The file is corrupted, and leads directly back to EA."
,dANGER_boy,2011-07-22T06:04Z,"@Mrita
Yeah...you are full of shit.  I have numbers on my side you moron."
,B00geyJ4n,2011-08-23T20:50Z,"Well, as I'm a fan of DA I'll surely download this, thanks."

,Kalthaz,2011-11-17T13:44Z,"i have the same problem with the dazips files, the last one is installed but the other three give allways error, i have enough space on my disks i reinstalled my pc recently but i don't know what to do to install the files correctly. can u help?"
,o0dan0o,2012-01-15T18:11Z,downloading now.. i'll comment if it works.. advance thanksgiving to the uploader! cheers mate!
,renatov,2012-03-26T04:48Z,"Hey guys, if you are having an error with ""DAO_PRC_STR_1.1.dazip"" file, pay attention to this: you must have at least 2 gb of free space in EVERY partition of your computer, or else you will not be able to install. I was having this error because my C: had only 1,2gb of free space (although D: had 12gb and E: had 30 gb of free space). If ANY partition has less than 2 gb of free space, you will get an error. But it's very simple to solve it, just free some space and try to reinstall it. Cheers!"
,effector1980,2012-04-08T11:16Z,ill this work if you have awakening installed
,StuntAssasin,2012-04-11T23:32Z,"Yes but be sure that in the AddIns.xml(my documents DA folder)the version is set to utf-8
Great upload!Thanks:) "
