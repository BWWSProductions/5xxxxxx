Private Military Corporations (PMCs) have become big business, as small governments and large multi-national corporations have increasingly come to rely on the flexibility, value and discretion that PMCs provide in their security schemes. One PMC, the Darkrock Corp, has been contracted by Lubriconn International to secure the release of oil crews held hostage by the Venezuelan government, beginning a series of events that led to the overthrow of the Venezuelan government, leaving the country in the stewardship of Lubiconn. As Lubriconn's grip on the global oil market tightens, EurOil, the second largest oil company in the world, retains the services of Force Objective International, Darkrock's principal competitor, to regain control of those oil facilities and other energy producing assets.

Now, these two corporations, staffed with the cream of the Specwar crop (Navy SEALs, US Army Recon Rangers, SAS, GIGN, SPEZNAZ), square off in squad combat around the world, the ultimate mercenaries. Where governments can't or won't get involved, when lobbying fails, the PMCs will answer the call... if the price is right.
