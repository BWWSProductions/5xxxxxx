,MovieX101,2010-10-17T15:51Z,"To All: They are trying to pass a new Ridiculous law! The Information is on The Front Page of Demonoid! It says:

COICA

In the United States, a new law proposal called The Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA) was introduced last week, and there will be a hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee this Thursday.

If passed, this law will allow the government, under the command of the media companies, to censor the internet as they see fit, like China and Iran do, with the difference that the sites they decide to censor will be completely removed from the internet and not just in the US.

Please see the following article from the Huffington Post for more information.

Stop the Internet Blacklist

And if you are a US citizen, please take the time to sign this petition
DemandProgress.org - Petition to Stop the Internet Blacklist!


Update: Also for US citizens, you can email your Senator from the following link and tell him or her your concerns about this bill

Tell Your Senator: No Website Blacklists, No Internet Censorship!"
,xiIix,2010-10-20T04:58Z,"Dude, I will fucking go through a proxy if they do this shit. They will not stop us!!! They can censor the pirate bay all they want, they can try to blacklist anything they want, but guess what? Newsgroups are forever biotch. Between news groups, IRC and a lot of other ways, they will never fucking stop us. They can kiss my fucking ass. I will NOT buy more shit just because I can't try it for free first!! America is fucking BANKRUPT. We can't afford to pay fucking $20 to see a shitty movie and just suck it up. If I LIKE IT I WILL BUY IT!

I bet you anything this will get passed. Everything in this country gets passed without a single person saying a word about it. They act like we're the unreasonable ones, and that our demand for an ""honor system""-like economy isn't realistic... they're just pissed because we don't have to spend $20-$50 to figure out that a movie or game is a horrible piece of shit.

KDX, IRC, News Groups, other torrent sites and torrent mirrors, flash video sites, private FTP's, Proxy services... they will all live on, we will never be stopped. If they think censoring the bay and a few torrent sites is going to stop be from pirating by shit, they're sorely mistaken. I'll never stop. I don't care if I get taken to court and sued for money I don't have, I'll always find a way."
