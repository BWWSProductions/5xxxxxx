Still German PAL."
,zoneone,2010-09-22T20:38Z,@feartruth ...And that's why God invented the 800MB CD.
,jayness,2010-09-22T22:57Z,"How come the subs play out through the whole movie, and not only where they speak a foreign language?  I don't want subs for english parts..."
,Brainsnack,2010-09-23T04:29Z,"@jayness: You don't, the rest of the world does. What an ego."
,jayness,2010-09-23T05:17Z,"@Brainsnack: It's not an ego, just shouldn't the parts for example at the beginning, be subed already in the movie?  without adding sub files.  Because adding the sub files, creates subs the whole movie, which is annoying, because I don't need it to sub english, for english speaking words... just the parts that are in foreign languages orginally in the movie, regardless if its north american or not."
,LORDLORD,2010-09-23T16:22Z,"i want good subs for english parts, 

but after half hour subs are delayed fora bout 1 secon and to the end it increases to 2,3 seconds,


video is superb but the subs are bad !
thanks ! "
,LORDLORD,2010-09-23T16:24Z,"subs are bad but the video are ok, i want english for all parts !

Thanks"
,stevuna,2010-09-23T19:09Z,Fxg you rock!! perfect!!
,Brainsnack,2010-09-23T22:05Z,@jayness: I stand corrected. I hadn't thought of it in that way.
,jayness,2010-09-24T10:37Z,"@Brainsnack: No problem, but does ANYONE know how to get english subs just for non english parts in the movie?  The subs are english for english speaking parts for the whole movie lol, they are real bad."
,dropper1,2010-09-25T00:38Z,"good rip but damn this movie is one of the worst sequels ever made, if ya look at the plot & not the cgi, its a made 4 tv movie not a blockbuster. this SHOULD be free."
,dropper1,2010-09-25T00:41Z,"please dont listen to rideverest like we need more crap movies inception aint cumin for a long time, guys dont upload those movies. this movie is enough of bad plots boss battle under a minute long but its a blockbuster."
,Jovebilal,2010-09-26T04:13Z,"Audio: 9
Video: 9

,Jovebilal,2010-09-26T04:18Z,"Audio: 9 Video: 9. Plz upload Inception as well.
Thanks FXG"
,jayness,2010-09-27T19:18Z,"@NYTDDS:  I agree, you guys are getting it for free, stop complaining!  but i did have a question NYTDDS, is there a way we can get subs JUST for NON speaking english parts.  The subs at the moment, put english on english parts..."

,FireIsHot,2010-10-06T00:45Z,"Hope this is actually dvd quality, the Xvid-Max quality was 8/10 at best. I'll comment after download, never had an issue with FXG before."
,FireIsHot,2010-10-07T02:55Z,"Ok So, I'm slightly biased towards 720p Rips, this isn't one so you won't see that kind of quality. But for a Standard DVD it's definitely 

A 10/10

V 10/10

You continue to due us a great service FXG."
,jwilson94,2010-10-14T16:15Z,"Careful everyone, within hours of downloading I got the copyright infringement email from Comcast. Second one from FXG - are they targeting his torrents?"
,fabribek,2010-10-16T03:03Z,"Ahem ... up in Canada ... 
got a violation notice from Paramount...

How's that!

Watch out people.... use protection!"
,fabribek,2010-10-16T03:13Z,"Does paramount or its agents have any authority in Canada?

Last I heard from some Canadian official was that they would not prosecute downloaders, but would go after the source uploaders of movies onto the internet.

So.... just got a notice from my service provider for copyright infringements for this movie... was using peerblock but may have had an oops moment...

Way to go.....

Wear protection.... use a proxy!"
,Wi-Foo-er,2010-11-07T03:17Z,"A ++ 

Grate upload !!

A 10

,theRealKarmine,2010-11-08T14:18Z,"MAX uses AC3 so fuck them.  the best way to ruin a download is to compress a video and use AC3.  not only is the sound so damned low you cant hear it, you also have to strip the audio with vdub......convert it and normalize with headac3he THEN you might be able to hear it.

if i want ac3 ill download a full dvd, not a fucking rip.  stereo please (AND NOT JOINT IDIOTS)"
,bucketheadfan360,2010-11-13T18:23Z,for those saying that they got emails from their isps and stuff. Nice try but I don't think people here are that dumb to believe you.. LOL

,gratefulforthis,2010-12-13T15:42Z,"Haven't watched yet but this was one of my fastest downloads.

Respect to all those who understand the upload part of file sharing.

I'll continue until at least an equal share. :)"
,gratefulforthis,2010-12-14T21:09Z,"A = 7
V = 7
M = 8 (it is what it is...and is good at it lol)

Darker than I'd like so 7 is right. And audio is too quiet, but for a rip it's perfectly watchable and worth it too."
,Lixifer,2011-01-15T20:12Z,"This is NOT Dvdrip quality.  This is somewhere between telesync and dvdrip.  Quality is not catastrophic but then again certainly NOT Dvdrip standard.
