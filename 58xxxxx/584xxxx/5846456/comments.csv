,FAKMAN,2010-09-23T11:51Z,thanks!!!awesome!!!any working ps2 emulator???
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-09-24T06:07Z,"yeah i have a working ps2 emu but to run any ps2 emu on your pc you need a really really good pc. the cpu has to be better than a dualcore at 3.5 each. maybe a dualcore at 4.0 or higher. i have a really nice pc, that is why i'm able to run it with no troubles."
,AoF,2010-09-25T05:02Z,Why dont you upload it instead of bragging about it?
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-09-25T08:06Z,"@AoF i'll upload it when i get to it. but that will be a very huge upload because i will be including all my ps2 games also, so that will be my very last game upload. i have a lot of other games to upload till then so ima just brag for now."
,FAKMAN,2010-10-09T20:48Z,"thanks for replying!!!i will be looking and waiting for it(i want to play god of war like a maniac).

,DiMarko,2010-10-28T23:01Z,"@FAKMAN, there is a copy of a PS2 Emulator in a FF collection I found on here."
,cena316,2010-11-09T10:08Z,Many thanks 4 this matey :-)
,moogod22,2010-11-11T08:18Z,Great torrent!  Thank you for taking the time to upload this.  Works perfectly.  Project64 is the best emulator to use.
,Disturbed[]ne,2010-11-21T08:58Z,"What emulator does this use? I'm currently using ""Project64"" that's the best one I've seen. "
,Nexxion,2010-11-23T03:42Z,"Works great - Here's what you do need to do to clean it.

1) Download / Seed

2) Download a more up-to-date emulator. Vimm and Zophar's Domain are great places that hold these.

3) Open up the archive and copy the contents of ""Super Nintendo Roms"" to your ROM folder.

4) Open up your DOS prompt (you can just hit the start menu and run ""cmd.exe"")

5) Direct the command prompt to your ROM directory (for example ""cd\Program Files\Snes9x\ROMS\"")

6) Rename all files without an extension to .smc (""REN *. *.smc"") - Don't forget the space between the *. and the *.smc!

7) Open up your ROM folder and sort by size. Delete anything under 33KB. Files that small are demos or possibly worse. 

8) Search for the directory for anything that includes the words ""sex"", ""porn"", or ""rape"". Feel free to keep them if you wish to try them out and you're into that sort of thing. I personally find it safer to just delete the files and search for sex, porn, and rape on my own time.

9) There will be about 14 files that didn't get changed because they stupidly have periods in their name. (eg: Ms. Pac-Man) Simply rename these manually. 

10) Load the games up in your favorite emulator and enjoy! Almost every common game you can think of is here, though I've found that there are a couple more obscure ones such as ""The Magical Quest starring Mickey Mouse"" (Awesome game) are missing, but those are again easy to find online. This should be fine to get your collection most of the way there."
,sos21,2011-03-11T17:12Z,"hey, you have some games listed twice there lol.. still, thanks for this.. "
,BozoTheWicked,2011-04-05T07:50Z,"So many games and yet there isn't Harvest Moon 64, the greatest N64 game ever. So yeah in other words I would like to request a Harvest Moon 64 ROM. It would be much appreciated. Great torrent anyways. Many excellent games."
,SullySadface,2011-04-12T21:15Z,"@Nexxion

This isn't SNES. Also, Vimm's lair has been defunct since before even Cherryroms went down, not to mention Edgeemu and Romulation. I nostalgia'd though.

@AOF

PS2 games are usually on dvds, which makes one game larger than this whole torrent. 

@FAKMAN

PS2 is hard to emulate on good hardware. It's near impossible if you have the base requirements."
,damp_,2011-05-25T07:21Z,"works great, thanks :)"
,jitsuin,2011-06-27T03:46Z,"go buy a ps2 u cheap bastards!! u can hack it VERY EASILY and dl whatever ps2 games u want

,tigerscar56,2011-07-07T18:07Z,thanks i played goldeneye for hours
,Ms.Diabolical,2011-09-26T18:29Z,"It's working but Im having a problem with Paper Mario, about 1 hour of playing it stops working and a notification pops up saying Cache: Failed to translate."
,NewRasputin,2011-10-09T23:36Z,Is there a gameshark you can use with this?
,dilinwe,2011-10-24T15:34Z,some know if there is a torrent with the 7zip roms???
,_-Kaotik-_,2011-12-09T05:10Z,to everyone loving the nostalgia of goldeneye.  just download the goldeneye source mod for steam.
,.235.,2011-12-14T17:55Z,failmoar its all zipped
,CocoNetMike,2011-12-19T00:32Z,will these run with N64oid
,tomipee,2011-12-30T03:27Z,"Is there a way to get it work with xbox360 gamepad? It works great with usual pc games, and the emulator founds it on settings, but not in the game. It eats all the joy in game, to play mario with keyboard"
,TyMod,2012-01-11T04:29Z,"On my computer:
AMD Athlon II 260 Dual Core @3.2Ghz each
ATI Radeon 5750 1GB RAM
2 GB RAM
MSI Mainboard
and 1080p res I can run the PS2 emulator at 720p with anti-aliasing and DirectX11 at 60fps constantly and higher is the games not regional. If it's PAL I only get 50 FPS ofcourse.  You don't need a super computer. Just a nice one.  My computer is fast as hell but it's no where near amazing.  At 1080p and DirectX9 I can still maintain 60 fps.  Keep in mind I also used interlacing to make sure the screen didn't shake (a constant problem with PSCX2).  I just had to enable a few hacks and bam, the games ran amazingly.  So if you have specs near mine, you can run PSCX2 just fine and if your computer has better specs then mine then don't even bother asking, it will work.

Thanks man for this.  Wish my mom hadn't thrown my N64 out a couple years ago. I loved playing Paper Mario. :)"
