,jshityeah,2010-11-01T10:10Z,"lol Grammer

but thanks uploader"
,mangoa,2010-11-09T17:34Z,thank you! LOL :D
,Sleepmore,2010-11-23T23:05Z,"@ aeg832:
people dl'ing this are most likely looking for the correct way of spelling/speaking.

There is a common way to say things, and then there is PHILOSOPHY.
Nothing stays the same, why are we here, is there such a thing as free thought. You read to much, i suspect!"
,Lindane,2010-11-24T06:20Z,"@aeg832
You're a douche.
Evolve all you want, Grammar is still spelled with an 'A'."
,manoeri,2010-12-11T10:25Z,"@aeg832
That is seriously the most ridiculous argument I've ever heard. Grammar is spelled with an ""a""; a misspelling is not ""language evolving"". It's a misspelling."
,padbeat,2011-01-27T01:16Z,"Sharpen Your Grammer

Grammar, fuckwit! Clearly you haven't completed the programme, have you?"
,tdej,2011-02-20T05:21Z,"Life is too short to fight over trivial matters. Grammer or grammar who cares? Just laugh it off. 
Accept the good in life and discard the bad! World will be a better place for you and others to live in! Thanks MANTESH for the trouble taken to share this."
,downloadmeee123,2011-03-15T10:55Z,"uh yea right.just stfu and thank the uploader u morons.

,juniorain,2011-06-22T21:10Z,Are people REALLY complaining about a misspelled word? Do you feel smarter for pointing out something so obvious? People get lamer and lamer these days...
,superguiman,2011-06-30T12:36Z,"hey guy, thanks for sharing a lot of your good books ^-^ "
,antireligion,2011-07-03T19:55Z,Is it really spelled grammar? No shit.

,hdgafa,2011-08-01T02:15Z,Kan vi inte hålla oss till att kommentera torrent filen. Argumentationen håller inte.
,h0rr,2011-10-17T13:41Z,"It's really funny to find ""grammer"" in this torrent about grammar. But then again, it just confirms that the guy uploading this needs it the most. Us too though, because we are commenting here."
