Taking their name from the title of an album by dub experimentalist Badawi, Toronto-based trio Bedouin Soundclash actually have a more straight-ahead take on their Jamaican musical inspirations. On their third album, STREET GOSPELS, they pen easygoing pop songs built upon the skanking rhythms of ska. Vocalist Jay Malinowski's raspy falsetto is an easy fit for the band's uptempo grooves, delivering sprightly pop hooks with all the gusto of reggae-rock greats like the Police.
