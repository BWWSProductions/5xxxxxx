,lilars26,2010-09-21T16:38Z,Oh well.
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-21T16:47Z,"@lilars: What I meant was 'past-tense': ""was canceled"". Obviously suits changed their minds."
,lilars26,2010-09-21T16:54Z,"@20-40
I see what you mean.I'm only 12 minutes in and I'm having a hard time following the story."
,lilars26,2010-09-21T17:40Z,"...finished watching it and to be fair,a pretty good 1st episode.The jumping around from time periods makes sense now.Looking forward to next week."
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-21T19:03Z,"Yeah, it's good one. But it could be done in less 'hectic' manner."
