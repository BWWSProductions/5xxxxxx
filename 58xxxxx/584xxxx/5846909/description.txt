The beach is hotter at night! Baywatch Nights is a spin-off show from the popular syndicated series Baywatch. The series stars David Hasselhoff as Mitch Buchannon, who operates a private detective agency. After the first year, the series took on a different focus for the episode plots with many of them focusing on the occult and similar themes.
During Season 2, facing slipping ratings which were never as good as the original series, the producers decided to switch to a science fiction format (inspired by the success of The X-Files). Garner Ellerbee left the series and was replaced by Diamont Teague, a paranormal expert. The new format did not help the series and it was promptly canceled after the second season. The character Donna Marco, played by Donna D'Errico (regular cast member for season 2 only) was carried over to the original Baywatch series afterward.
