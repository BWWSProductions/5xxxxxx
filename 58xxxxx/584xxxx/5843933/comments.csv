fix, plz?"
[V],phatwarez,2010-09-23T03:31Z,"I did a short test and it played fine. It's 60i deinterlaced to 60p so it's true 60fps. It worked fine in vlc. The user aoeu is an experienced HD game releaser at TYT, his other releases were quality."
,waligaga,2010-09-23T04:25Z,"strange. is there any special setting you had to choose in VLC? i've never, for any type of file, HD to lo-fi, had anything this unplayable before. 

either i had a very bad file transfer, or something fishy is going on. i'll attempt to transfer this file to a faster computer just for shits n' giggles, and i'm also downloading the same file over again. 

will see. "
,waligaga,2010-09-23T04:37Z,"interesting. on my better/faster/nice vidcard computer it plays fine.

i'm no expert, but this is a first for sure. 

either way, i appreciate it, phat."
