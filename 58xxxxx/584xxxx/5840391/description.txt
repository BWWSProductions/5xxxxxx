                   FIGHT ANALYSIS: Shane Mosley v Sergio Mora              
                                                                           
   He's been one of the best fighters of his generation.                   
                                                                           
   Three time world champion, "Sugar" Shane Mosley makes his "Last Stand"  
   when he faces former world champion Sergio Mora in Los Angeles.         
                                                                           
   Mosley has been one of the best "Pound for Pound" fighters of the past  
   decade.                                                                 
                                                                           
   In 2000, he inflicted Oscar De La Hoya's first loss, and along the way  
   he has collected world championships in three different divisions,       
   defeating some of the world best fighters.                              
                                                                           
   But at 39 time is not on his side but the skill set he brings to the    
   ring remain a massive threat to his opponents.                          
                                                                           
   Despite entering his clash with Floyd Mayweather as a huge underdog     
   last May, he rocked the favourite to his very core early in the bout,   
   and came within a couple of punches of causing a monumental upset.      
                                                                           
   For this reason, Sergio Mora will need to be wary of his aging opponent.
                                                                           
   Nicknamed "The Latin Snake", Mora made himself a household name due to  
   his success on the hugely popular "Contender" series. That led to a     
   world title winning effort against Vernon Forrest, where he lifted the   
   WBC Light Middleweight Title.                                           
                                                                           
   He lost the title in his first defense but with a resolve backed up by  
   his ability, Mora is now determined to fulfill his potential and punch  
   his way back into world title contention.                               
                                                                           
   To do so, he must defeat Shane Mosley.                                  
                                                                           
   Can Mosley go out in a blaze of glory? Or will Mora ensure he exits on  
   his back?
