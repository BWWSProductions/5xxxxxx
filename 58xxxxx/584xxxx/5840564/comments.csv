,dragster8787,2010-10-24T15:06Z,"You can ""Delete the virus"":
1. Download uniextract
2. Extract BeatHazard.exe
3. Open the extracted files
4. go to the TEMP Folder
5. Your Antivirus may popup now, removing ""chanceb.exe""
6. Run the Beathazard.exe in this folder (No, this one DOESN'T contain a virus)
7. Let the Extractor do his job...
8. Open your chosen installation folder and make a shortcut from Beathazard.exe (The Extracted one)

I DON'T KNOW IF THE SAFE FUNCTION WORKS, AND AFTER DOING THIS, I AM NOT SURE IF THE GAME IS STILL PORABLE.
Maybe i am gonna make the game portable myself later, then ill make a torrent and put it on TPB"
