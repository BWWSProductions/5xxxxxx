			      Notes:                                        
			      Making use of the following rule:      
                   If at the lowest resolution allowed    
			       and MP3 audio bitrate of 128 kbps      
			   	average I/P quant is above 4.5,        
			   	releases may jump 1 size up (e.g. 2    
			   	CDs may be used instead of 1). Such    
			   	cases MUST provide proper proof and    
			   	explanation in the nfo.                
			   		                                   
			   	Screenshot with I/P quants is           
			   	included. It proves that even at 2     
			   	CD target size the I/P quant is way    
			   	above 3.x, which means at 1 CD target  
			   	size the I/P quant would have been     
			   	way above 5, even at lowest possible   
			   	resolution and 128 kbps MP3 audio.     
			   	Quite a pain to provide proof, but     
			   	from the screenshot it should be       
			   	apparent that this movie did not       
		       	compress well at all.                  
			   		                                    
                   Proper reason: Previous release has    
			   	bad ivtc and bad res.                  
			   		                                   
			   	             Enjoy. :)
