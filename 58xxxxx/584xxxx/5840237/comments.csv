,blu4you,2010-09-21T05:08Z,I have a whole lot of PS3 Blu-Ray rips I could share...I'm just afraid of the RIAA heh
,wolfbane3,2010-09-21T08:51Z,"thanks for all the rips halfmonkey. just curious tho, no one else in the ps3 group seems active. was a huge fan, so just thinking out loud :)"
,halfmonkey,2010-09-21T19:13Z,"Thanks for the encouragement, but to be honest I might make this my last upload. I've uploaded nearly 10Gb of this file and nobody else is seeding. The others (PS3-TEAM) left due partly to criticism. I don't mind that, but when I'm the only one seeding and everybody is leeching it becomes a little discouraging to bother carrying on the PS3-TEAM tag - Don't forget it is just a tag in the name - That's the only reason these movies appear in searches - As long as someone ups a file with the spec of what I explained in the ""Kick Ass"" movie comments then its a PS3 compatible rip."
,Chewbaz,2010-09-22T12:57Z,"Awesome effort as always! 

Is there any chance of ripping a 3D film to test out the PS3's 3D capabilities."
,wolfbane3,2010-09-22T13:38Z,"to halfmonkey:
dude, it'd b a shame if u quit, and if the others did due to criticism, that's a shame too, cuz quite frankly i never downloaded 1080p movies till i stumbles upon bricktop's rips and then the rest of the gang, and i really dont have the kind of net connection to download 10gb+ movies. i m probably being a little selfish when i say this, but hang tight, and dont let it get u down, and if anyone of the other ps3 team members r reading this, same to u guys as well. for my part, what i m gonna do to show my support is look up some of the older rips that may b dying out, download them if i can, and seed as long as humanly possible. message to all those who have benefitted from these ps3-team rips: please do the same. these guys have been good to us, now it's our turn to return the favour!
halfmonkey, dude, i hope i get to look forward to your and the other team members rips in the near future :)"
