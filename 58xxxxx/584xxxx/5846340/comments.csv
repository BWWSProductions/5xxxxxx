,mofer3,2010-10-02T12:39Z,how can i change it to ios222
,CGar,2010-10-14T16:59Z,"yea, i can confirm that using an alternate CIOS works. i used ios 223 of hermes v5 which i installed with base 57 or base 37. So use hermes v5 and install to ios 222 or 223 or 224 as either base 57 or 37 and the game should load.
This i have tested using Configurable USB Loader Release 60. U just press 1 on the game and change the cios from 249 to 223 mload (or wherever u installed hermes using base 37 or 57 to)"
,channel500news,2010-10-19T11:23Z,i have tried Cios 222-mload and Cios 223-mload in Configurable Usb Loader they don't work it just appears as a black screen my wiimote stays on but nothing happens so can someone please help me
