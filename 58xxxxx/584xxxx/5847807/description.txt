     Ace of Base are a pop band based in Gothenburg, Sweden. Its original
     member lineup consisted of Jonas ÅJokerÃ¶ Berggren, Ulf ÅBuddhaÃ¶
     Ekberg, and sisters Malin ÅLinnÃ¶ Berggren and Jenny Berggren. They
     released four studio albums between 1993 and 2002, which sold in
     excess of 30 million copies worldwide. Following the official
     departure of singer Linn in 2007, the band performed a series of
     concerts as a trio in Europe and Asia, before Jenny revealed in
     November 2009 that the three members could not get an album released,
     and that she would instead pursue a solo career.

     Now, after eight years and with two new singers, Ace Of Base released
     their fifth studio album called ÅThe Golden RatioÃ¶. The music of the
     new Ace Of Base album ÅThe Golden RatioÃ¶ is very catchy and funky.
     Most songs are perfect for the dance floor. The songs are all easy to
     sing along and spread a good mood. The electropop music of the new
     album ÅThe Golden RatioÃ¶ reminds strongly of 80s pop. All thirteen
     songs are spreading good mood and party vibes. ÅMr. ReplayÃ¶ is
     including a rapper that sounds a little Jamaican. ÅThe Golden RatioÃ¶
     is a wonderful album that combines the good old 80s pop with the
     modern music. Enjoy Ace Of Base with ÅThe Golden RatioÃ¶.
