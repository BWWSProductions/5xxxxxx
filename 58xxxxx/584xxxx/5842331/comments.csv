Froggie, appreciate ur uploads man but do you have a slow internet connection for seeding? or is it purely all these non-sharing leechers? Thanks, looking forward to this one!!"
,Terror-Freaker,2010-09-21T13:30Z,Thnx for the upload!
,tbone3181,2010-09-21T20:08Z,"Skeelz, your screengrab was taken when there were 700+ seeders. When i wrote my comment there were only 40 and only connected to 2! i had average speed of 37kbs over the first 4 hours!!!"
,avioni,2010-09-21T23:19Z,"the quality of this is superb. 10/10 also video covers full screen, no black bars."
,avioni,2010-09-21T23:20Z,the quality of this is excellent. 10/10 it also fills the screen with no black bars.
,SweetTechno90,2010-09-25T00:40Z,great quality
,gregersamsa,2010-09-26T00:10Z,Windows media player better than VLC? Exactly how much glue have you been sniffing?!
,jadedknutsak,2010-09-26T19:26Z,"So no one else is having trouble with the audio on this file?  In both VLC and WMP?  For me, voices not heard, all other audio elements are there.  First time in years I have had this problem."
,ManDie7610,2010-09-27T19:57Z,NOT the unrated version!!!
,irishboym4,2010-09-29T09:59Z,check your sound settings
,Ageagren,2010-10-06T21:15Z,"@gregersamsa
Ig you download the Satsuki Decoder Pack, you can even use windows media player as a perfect media player! It makes it even better for HD movies than VLC does."
,jolsrud2000,2010-10-09T14:31Z,"Insted of complaining about speed; learn what Initial Seeding is, every1 want fast dl but wont upload..................
AND; you get it for free, so STFU if it takes a week........."

I want to ask all of u about watching .mkv movies in notebook.When I watch a .mkv 
in my notebook , it seems like a divx or slightly better than it.I know the LCD panel 
of it isnt HD but I just wonder that does it really make a huge difference watching it in 
a 42"" or 46"" LCD or LED TV ?

Thx for ur answers guys.And thx for the movie again. "
,halferhalfer,2010-11-12T06:07Z,"@Skeelz Try double-clicking the movie, or pressing FULL SCREEN button (which is next on the right to the >> button), then magically the magic bars on 1980x1080 screen disappear! And I'll tell you the video quality improves too, because there is no resolution shift! Outstanding, really! "
