,recorps1,2010-09-28T14:49Z,i love this series and here in AUS it will be some time (next year) till this airs so thanks for the upload. the picture is great when watching on a big hd screen 2-3m away but the sound isnt up to standards anymore. instead of ACC 2.0 it MP3 2.0 which compresses the sound and the voices come out all kinda fuzzy! it almost makes me wan to upgrade my net and download the 720p version!!
,recorps1,2010-09-28T14:50Z,oh and BTW well now the mother in season 7!! =)
