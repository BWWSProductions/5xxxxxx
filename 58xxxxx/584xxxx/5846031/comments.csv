,gmjh,2010-09-24T16:50Z,Magic ISO can find no file and WinRAR can't find anything to extract. Copying it to a DVD disc creates a file that cannot be read by my computer. Can this file only be read by Blu-Ray players? Thanks
,gmjh,2010-09-24T17:01Z,"Ah, I can open the DVD disc I made, go to BDMV, go to  STREAM, and in there is the movie file that VLC can play. Surely there's an easier way to play this file though?"

If you choose to play the movie on your computer, the image file can be extracted with PowerISO v4.5 or later, which also has the facility to mount the image file as a Virtual Drive to watch an ISO file.

It's not much different to using an MKV container, only that it's easier to use an uncompressed image file for people that want to burn this AVCHD movie to a DVD5 disk to play on a compatible, stand-alone, Blu-ray or DVD-HD player.

I hope this helps, and enjoy the movie :o)

Neither of the subtitles encoded with this moves are hard-coded or forced."
,gmjh,2010-10-01T18:29Z,Thanks for the reply. The technical quality of this download is superb. 10/10. (though the movie itself is a bit silly really)
