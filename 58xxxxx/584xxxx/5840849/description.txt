These guys are an AWESOME local band from Kansas City.  They sound alot like At the Drive in or a milder version of the Mars Volta.  It is amazing the depth of sound they create with 2 guys.  

If you like the album, I suggest you support the band by buying the CD on Bandcamp:
 
http://tarkusattacks.bandcamp.com/

either that or go see them when they play near you.. they travel the midwest, but not too often.

Disclaimer: I was told by Chris and Nate that I could put this up for download so don't be afraid... DL and share!


BTW.. they want to be defined as "storming the castle" rock
