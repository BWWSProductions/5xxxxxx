If you love Nirvana, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Offspring, Weezer, Ozma, Death Cab for Cutie, Placebo, The Thermals or bands inspired by Classic rock then you will love Death to the Mckenzies.  This is my second torrent created for the awesome Southern, Ca based Rock group, Death to the Mckenzies.  This is their b-sides and rarities compilation that they released after â€œControl Theory,â€ their debut album. The cd is entitled â€œAnother Fucking Garage Band.â€ If you dig the band and loved their first album then youâ€™ll love this one too.  Enjoy and seed.
So if you like them, support the band, you can find them at,, reverbnation.com/deathtothemckenzies or basically anywhere, just google or bing search them.
