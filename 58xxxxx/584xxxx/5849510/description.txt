             Ron White: Behavioral Problems    (2009)


Stand Up Comedy


The main focuses of Whiteâ€™s comedy are pretty standard stuff. Thereâ€™s a lengthy discussion about the complexities of oral sex (which, he maintains at length, he only does with his wife) and the idiocy of the multicolor warning system that was developed in the wake of 9/11. Thereâ€™s also some talk about whatâ€™s strange about Europeans and a lengthy tale of his getting arrested for marijuana possession in Florida. And, for the most part, he gets it straight on. His bits on Vogue, where White claims to have learned all sorts of things about oral sex, can be pretty ridiculous, as can warning system segments; White proposes changing it to a system with two settings: "Go Find a Helmet" and "Put On The Helmet". He gets a lot of mileage out of his middle-class befuddlement with the needless complexity of the modern world, but at the end of the day, this turns out to be one of the biggest detriments to his credibility.
