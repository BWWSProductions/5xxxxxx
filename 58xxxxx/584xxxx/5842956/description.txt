Fractions, Decimals, and Percents (1 of the 7 books in Manhattan GMATâ€™s Preparation Guide series) provides a highly organized and structured approach to the variety of questions in this quantitative content area. Students learn to see the connections among part-whole relationships and practice implementing strategic shortcuts. The book offers a unique balance between two competing emphases: test-taking strategies and in-depth content understanding.

Practice problem-sets build specific foundational skills in each topic and include the most advanced content that many other prep books ignore. As the average GMAT score required to gain admission to top b schools continues to rise, this guide provides test-takers with the depth and volume of advanced material essential for succeeding on the GMATâ€™s computer adaptive format.
