Sometimes the beauty of a stranger can elicit the depravity of a soul. In perhaps her darkest piece yet, director and AVN Best Actress winner Kimberly Kane portrays a voyeuristic loner lost in a feverish obsession with lady of the night Savanna Samson...who is unaware of her captivated admirer. Isolation and lust control Kimberly's mind as she falls deeper and deeper into the beautiful and sometimes uncontrollable world of her innermost thoughts. Enter this world...and witness the perversity that transpires when Beautiful Strangers meet.
