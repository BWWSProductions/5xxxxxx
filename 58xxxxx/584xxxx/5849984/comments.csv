,ruudsach,2010-10-04T19:29Z,"Can I see snapshots or screenshots of these movies?

Its unbelievable that you provide almost 720p rips, FOUR-SIX times less than original size.

Please also provide some screenshots of these so called great rips for such small size.

Even RMVB gives this size [300~450MB] but has rendering issues with every player except MPC, and that too is a re-enc of DVDRip.

If ye are busy, which I count that you are, some of your fans who have downloaded this great HD rips kindly upload some screenshots and provide its links here"
,jake16,2010-10-07T06:28Z,Great Quality - Thanks!!
,ncunico,2010-10-14T17:37Z,I seriously doubt that this is a blu ray rip. Id say its an upscaled dvd or hd tv rip
,Barosanescu,2010-12-27T16:08Z,"Sorry folks, but this is not 720p. It's maybe a rip from a 720p. "
,HBirdman,2011-01-02T17:03Z,"the audio's fine but the video is awful, it freezes than jumps so you miss out entire sequences. Maybe its just me"
