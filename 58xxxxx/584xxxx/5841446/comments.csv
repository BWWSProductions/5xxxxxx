,amerelium,2010-09-21T05:07Z,"Picture is good, but, regretably, this is yet AGAIN a rip where active sound normalization is used, which means the sound volume goes up and down thoughout the movie.

Stay clear."
,amerelium,2010-09-21T05:09Z,Active sound normalization - rubbish
[T],fachman,2010-09-21T07:37Z,"volume levels are unchanged from DTS, no normalisation were used. Its just how it suppose to sound..."
,amerelium,2010-09-22T13:34Z,"volumes may be unchanged, but most encoders have active normalization as default setting. Sound here is all messed up - it's easily identifiable"
[T],fachman,2010-09-22T14:29Z,"dear friend i think you are not quite familiar with technical terms. 
Original soundtrack have different levels of volume depend on the action, which means the sound volume goes up and down thoughout the movie.
Sound normalisation is the process where the differencies between low and high volume sounds is smaller hence the volume is similar for every part of the movie.
I have used transparent encoding of dts, so you have the sound like it was in original soundtrack. If you want the sound normalisation you need to use external function of your player/decoder."
,Bobbo68,2010-10-21T13:59Z,Great quality thanks
,mansameer,2011-05-04T18:59Z,please seeddddddddddddd
,phrozenstare,2011-06-26T06:04Z,well you guys with you're dull vision might be fine with it but if i wanted to watch a HDTV movie that is compressed to hell i will just watch it on satellite or cable. if it doesn't matter then they would have just released 1080p movies on DVD disks and not HDDVD or BLURAY
