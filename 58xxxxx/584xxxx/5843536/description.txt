This is the Prologue to the thirteenth book of the Wheel of Time, The Towers of Midnight.

I myself purchased it, decrypted it, and placed it here in a gesture of thanks to all who've let me download books when they were unavailable to me through legal means.

DRM is ok, publishers, as long as you don't use it to dole out content in such a way as to leave the rest of the world without.  Use it responsibly, and not to help you pad your bottom line.
