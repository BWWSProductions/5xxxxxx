,Ticondrius,2010-09-21T10:40Z,I'm seeding 100kbps until a few more seeds get on there.  Please seed once you get it downloaded...
,ElectricEye,2010-09-21T11:29Z,"Huge thanks to uploader. But...

I get an empty page that says ""No input file specified. "" when I click the download link. Can anyone confirm this torrent works? 
Thanks."
,Larogan,2010-09-21T11:43Z,Doesn't work for me either
,Larogan,2010-09-21T11:47Z,The magnet link works. the torrent link doesn't
,ElectricEye,2010-09-21T11:52Z,"The ""magnet link"" next to the normal download link appears to work."
,abirn,2010-09-21T16:38Z,how do you open this or what program do you use 
,PhoenixAlthor,2010-09-21T17:50Z,"Wow, thanks so much, this is brilliant.  I can't believe just cause I don't live in the US I couldn't buy it, so this torrent was a lifesaver :D
And abirn try downloading Adobe Digital Editions, it worked for me.
Anyway, I'm now off to read it."
,abirn,2010-09-21T18:34Z,@PhoenixAlthor thanx works great
,Ticondrius,2010-09-22T07:22Z,"I don't know why the torrent link doesn't work, but as pointed out, the magnet link does.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

Glad those who got it downloaded are enjoying it.  I'm using the free Nook reader to view the unencrypted epub just fine.  

I bought it seconds after release, and 10 minutes later had it decrypted and online.  Makes you wonder why they even bother with DRM..."
,Braus,2010-09-22T21:49Z,"Sup ticondrius, thanks for this. Im a huge WOT fan and have bought the books and some of the audio :p But i got no problems in pirating this piece, even though i got such a huge respect and liking to the series that im gonna end up buying anything regarding the series just to collect it:P, did buy it last year though but there is always problems with buying it as a european.

Anyhow im curious if you have any idea if there is a chance to get your hands on the audio version of the prolouge. I like to listen to chapters before bedtime ^^"
,spedly78,2010-09-24T00:46Z,Can someone please re-post this? I cannot get the magnet link to work and I am outside the US and therefore cannot seem to even buy the thing!
,Ammock221,2010-09-27T00:45Z,"I can't get either link to work, its anoying as this is the only place I have found it so far and you can't buy it outside the USA."
,ElectricEye,2010-09-27T23:10Z,"Getting Magnet Link to work.

Make sure to update your Bittorrent client. Check if there is a setting in your Bittorrent client that you need to enable to associate your Bittorrent client with Magnet Links. If it doesn't work, try another Bittorrent client. Or perhaps try with another browser.
