           The film tells the story of Jack Filice Jr., an heir to a      
           Hollywood Italian-American dynasty. As his father, Jack        
           Sr.(played Tony-award winning Joe Mantegna), lays dying,       
           he asks his only son to preserve the family estate, and        
           to never tear it down. The pact is made, but within a          
           year, the cocky young music producer, demolishes the           
           estate and builds his "party palace". On the night of          
           Jack's house warming party, friends and family party into      
           the early morning, unaware of the "monstrous spirit" who       
           returns to murder them one-by-one, until only his              
           grandson is left to destroy. GRANDPA JACK takes human          
           form and systematically executes the "guests". Having to       
           do battle with the demon, Jack's own memories emerge that      
           have been haunting him for years in nightmares. On one         
           fateful night 23 years ago, three year old Jack Jr.            
           witnessed the gruesome murder of his own mother, Hannah,       
           at the hands of his own grandfather. Having buried the         
           event inside his head, and told over and over that his         
           mother had committed suicide, Jack's life was one of pain      
           and confusion. But now, after breaking a sacred deathbed       
           oath, Jack's own demons re-surface; and he must do battle      
           with the one demon who all but destroyed his life: his         
           own grandfather. In the action-filled climax, Jack Jr.         
           must take on the "spirit" himself to rid the world and         
           himself of this evil. But he finds he can't fight the old      
           bastard alone... and gets help from a shocking source:         
           HIS MOTHER. The "spirit" of Hannah Filice returns to take      
           on the man who brutally killed her, and thus, fights to        
           save the life of the little boy, now a grown man, who is       
           about to die at the hands of the same monster who              
           destroyed her some 20 years ago. The screenplay has            
           received great "buzz" in Hollywood for its fresh take on       
           an established genre; in addition, for its well-rounded        
           characters and yes, wry humor. But THE HOUSE THAT JACK         
           BUILT is also a terrifying story of violence, family           
           secrets and lies; and creates a world where life and           
           death seem to weld together, where the "afterlife" may         
           not be so "after", afterall.
