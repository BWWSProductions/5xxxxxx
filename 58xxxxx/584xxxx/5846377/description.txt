As with previous games in the series, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock  will let up to four people play in a band on vocals, lead and bass/rhythm guitar, and drums, to successfully match notes as they scroll down the screen as appropriate for their instrument (or matching relative pitch, in the case of vocals), in order to perform well and complete each song. Official Xbox Magazine (UK) noted that a change to the core gameplay appears to be the addition of a sustained open-string bass note that was lacking in previous games.[3]  Another rumored change to the core gameplay is the inclusion of "ghost notes" on its drum charts, similar in appearence to the clear notes that make use of the touch strip on the more recent guitar peripherals. These appear when playing the drum peripheral on the expert + setting (which also utilizes double bass pedal gameplay) and allow the player to score more points if they hit the drum pad softer than normal.
