,dwatch,2010-09-24T10:34Z,"Thanks for the HD upload of this, was trying to Tivo this one, and my cable went out :(

This show also has Jackie Evancho from Americas Got Talent (great interview, and amazing performance), as well as true rock n' roll royalty, Brian Wilson. My cable went out right as Jackie was finishing Pie Jesus and I never got to see Brian Wilson's performance (hope its something from his new album).

Thanks again!"
