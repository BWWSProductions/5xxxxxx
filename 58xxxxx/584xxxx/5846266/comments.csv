,anuzbitt,2010-09-22T23:28Z,well its hard to tell since he got proper uploads on demonoid and here on piratebay.... but yeah hmm smells like the demo size :/ sadly enuff
,Fedorov92,2010-09-22T23:32Z,"Yea I'm not gonna download this... When something looks too good to be true, it probably is. This is probably just the demo. I doubt there's a virus in it anywhere, but still, you can't compress 8GB into 3.51... at least not that I know of. And I'm not too informed about Steam-based torrents, but doesn't getting the game this way make it impossible to play online? I thought it would show up illegally in Steam's servers... In any case, I can wait for the real deal, one that's not just a demo."
,dioltas,2010-09-22T23:33Z,"I'll apologise if I'm wrong but this looks extremely dodgy!. As previously mentioned by other posters the file size seems dodgy, although CIV IV was only around 3gb to download.

And the fixer.exe is not a virus, I wrote in in C#, and I have no idea how to write any sort of virus using it.

When someone dl pls leave a comment!"
,Arctic0ne,2010-09-23T00:22Z,"To further dispel some of your comments, as I read them, I'll answer to a few more posts.

About the size, do you people understand that that takes into account future DLCs and if you fill your HDD up to 100% you will run into some issues, so they recommend you leave a few gigs free.

I understand that I am not a big time name. Which could make you doubtful of it's legitimacy. Most of the well known groups won't buy from Steam because it requires a credit card.

The reason that you can play online is because it is run through Gamespy, not Steam servers. Gamespy does no serial checking of any kind, this is the same on games such as Borderlands.

Also, don't believe anyone who calls out fake. They are either trolls, haven't even attempted to get the game, or have no idea the way anything works and shouldn't talk anyway.

It's going to take quite a while to get the torrent seeded. I am currently initial seeding, or super seeding as some call it, and only have around 60kb/s upload speeds."
,Arctic0ne,2010-09-23T00:24Z,"Once further, ""LOL. If this dude had the skill to crack Steam based releases, you'd think we'd have seen him before now with the other releases?"" this is ""cracked"" using RevEMU 9.83 and RevLoader, a dumb ass can ""crack"" any Steam game nowadays."

Most likely there's only one seeder and everyone else shares the data he uploads between themselves.

Ok, so it will most likely work through Gamespy, if it doesn't you can play over LAN no problem. You can set up a Hamachi group and go to town.

The NCFs are worthless, as they are just a reference to the files. It's just so Steam has something to look for.

Uploading anything like this to MF would be A) A breach of their TOS and B) Most likely slower, because I would have to upload the whole thing, then have you download it.

The language is English, but I believe all the files are included for French, German, Spanish, and possibly another, but don't quote me on that.

And those images are linked to a now canceled account. Too many people were looking at them and it basically raised a red flag considering it's a free account. So I was banned. But created another a few minutes later.

SO the speeds are slow, I know. You're getting the game for free, chill out. I am always seeding, and am the ONLY seeder. Those 12 or so others are FAKES! Not sure how people do that, or even why, but I am the only one with the file currently.

I would like a Pirates! sequel very much :3

I will upload the soundtrack and behind the scenes, just as soon as this torrent is seeded nicely.

I got a moderator to comment on my torrent :D Hopefully I'll get trusted status after this little endeavor >:)

Keep seeding, and have fun with you shiny new free game!"

,YogyBear,2010-09-23T02:55Z,"@Lum4r
Seems it's a single uploader, but not dedicated leecher. He stated that his cap is 60 KB/s so that would make it 17 hours with dedicated leecher.
But it'll probably take longer since he uploads some data duplicitly."

,lazonby,2010-09-23T03:29Z,"TORRENT DOWNLOAD LESSON for impatient people.

1. If there are 40 seeders and 7000 leechers, then 40 ppl are actually seeding new content to 7000 ppl.

2. If you get fast DL's, then you are receiving the % of content that everyone else has already DL'd.

This is arbitrary of course, but this is the jest of it. Calm down about the DL speeds and SEED WHEN YOU ARE DONE! It's not going to kill you to leave your computer on overnight or while you're at work/school/whatever."

,ibjhtt,2010-09-23T04:38Z,"Thank you Arctic0ne for the UL, crazy that some kid flying solo beat all the scenesters by AT LEAST several hours...

But if you only have 60kbps up speed, I'd strongly advise you cut back your seed connections drastically. To like, two or three. Get it to those users as fast as possible, and let people with higher UL speeds seed your torrent to the community.

Reason I say that is because there's too much data duplication going on. A 60kbps connection should UL this torrent in about 17-20 hrs. The file was first online over 6 hours ago. So it should be roughly 30-35% done, but it's only 9.5% distributed. At this rate it won't be fully uploaded to the community until early Saturday. Your seed is probably sending lots of bits that are already out there. So focus on getting a full copy out before opening it up. But regardless, thanks again."

I'd say maybe 5 minutes but I don't think u can handle so long. Do the math. 60 seeders for 1000 peers for 5'. Shuffle the cards :D
,Lum4r,2010-09-23T04:50Z,"Based on the current rate of 10% per 410 minutes, that's 4100 minutes total; about 2.85 days. That means the ETA is about Saturday around noon."

I don't believe you understand the situation. If you were to read the comments, you'd see that there is currently only one (real) seeder. The torrent has not been distributed to the community, and what little download you are getting is trickle-down from Arctic0ne. Nobody has jumped out because nobody has the damned thing in the first place."

,SpockTrek,2010-09-23T05:09Z,Here's the problem people. All of you who have it finished or are close to finishing need to set your upload slots per seed down low (3-5 is good) so that more people finish it faster and make more seeds so that other people can finish.

You should totally achieve trusted status if this works out, and they should throw in a free handjob for good measure.

One question though, I noticed that you put up a comment that went along the lines of ""I just realized that the ""Fixer.exe"" is still set up for Team Fortress 2, and will not work. I added a link for the fixed one, including a source code txt file, you need to add a reference to Interop.IWshRuntimeLibrary.dll to get it to compile.""

I was a little confused about this and was wondering if you could clarify a little? Will we need to download this new ""fixer"" in order to play the game?? Thanks brah."
,alastrnna,2010-09-23T05:17Z,If people weren't reassured yet by previous comments. I went over the executables provided. Since they are written in C# its easy to decompile them. I didn't find anything dodgy. I'm getting the game in the mail the 28th. Couldn't wait so I hope this download finishes before then :P.

,RedXIIIx,2010-09-23T05:36Z,"@Scrotom

Yes, download the new fixer as the old one won't work.

@SpockTrek

The problem is that nobody has finished it. We are all sitting at the same percentage."
,ibjhtt,2010-09-23T05:37Z,"Ridic and others - if something seems odd, read the comments. It's not seeding fast because Arctic0ne has a 60kBps upload speed. That's 17-20 hours minimum just to upload one copy of the game. No one else has a full copy yet; any additional seeders you see are just a mirage, perhaps leechers who've checked off that they're super-seeders in torrent properties. 

Also - the ""fixer.exe"" file included in the torrent is incorrect. That's a Team Fortress 2 fixer file and I'm concerned that 99% of the people currently downloading this won't get it to work because they don't read the comments when things go wrong. I've posted the link to the correct file directly above."
,b0lt,2010-09-23T05:45Z,"Everyone who has a complete copy just needs to set their client to super seed, the problem is that some pieces are spread everywhere, and some are only on a few nodes."
,Halgar,2010-09-23T05:46Z,"LOL, of course if they don't read the comments it is their own fault... but the last thing we need is a slew of comments about it not working because of the fixer issue.

,oakwind1,2010-09-23T05:51Z,"Here is a FAQ for this thread:

Q: Why are there ""x"" seeders? 
A: As of now(about 7 hours after release) there is only 1 seeder. If your client says there is more than 1 then ether the tracker has an error, people are using hacked clients, or anti-piracy groups are seeding bad data to slow down the swarm."
,oakwind1,2010-09-23T05:52Z,"Q: Why is the torrent so small?
A: It's compressed to 3.51 gig, and decompresses to 5.4 gig. Civilization 4 was 1.38 gig on disk, and decompressed to 1.7 gig when installed. Top down turn based strategy games do not require massive amounts of data like a 3-d modeled world with large textures, and effects would."
,oakwind1,2010-09-23T05:52Z,"Q: It was going so fast, and then it stopped, I'm stuck!
A: The one seeder has an upload rate of 60kbps and has only sent out 12.5% of the torrent. Right now there are 7800 people leaching (downloading) and they are the ones that gave you a good speed at the start. But, once they and you hit the 12.5% things will slow down till the seeder can seed the rest of the torrent.

Q: Why was ""x"" removed from the game?
A: This upload has [b]all game content[/b] and some bonus content. The only thing not included is the [b]bonus[/b] behind the scenes videos, and the [b]bonus[/b] musical content."
,oakwind1,2010-09-23T05:55Z,"Q: But it says you can play it online! No one can crack a steam game!

If you think you are going to have it downloaded soon because of high speeds, you are going to be disappointed.  You are just doing catch up with all the people that are already there.  Once you reach that point, you will slow to a crawl.  

For the last 9 hours and 25 minutes, I have averaged 19.7 kb/s down.  So, about 52 hours total.  Which means it will be done in a little under two days, or Saturday evening.

You should get trusted status for sure because of this, and for having a moderator comment. All your comments answered my questions, and I will seed for weeks.

I've been downloading for about 8 hours, (one hour after it was uploaded approx.) and my average speed is 21.6 kB/s, and I'm 19.4% complete. I hit the same snag at 2% as everyone, but apparently that's as far as you got in one hour on your slower upload speed. I'm not gonna complain... Hell, I give you huge props for getting this up before anyone else more established could!

So here I wait (not so patiently) looking helplessly at the number of leechers increasing. Hell, speed won't increase until there is another actual seeder, (not those fake ones) so I'll let my computer sit overnight and check back in the morning.

And trolls: STFU. This is a free game, so don't complain to the uploader who doesn't even have to do this. Sit back and relax. Everyone else with questions, read the first 4 pages of comments.

You should get trusted status for sure because of this, and for having a moderator comment. All your comments answered my questions, and I will seed for weeks.

I've been downloading for about 19 hours, (one hour after it was uploaded approx.) and my average speed is 26.7 kB/s, and I'm 50.4% complete. I hit the same snag at 2% as everyone, but apparently that's as far as you got in one hour on your slower upload speed. I'm not gonna complain... Hell, I give you huge props for getting this up before anyone else more established could!

So here I wait (not so patiently) looking helplessly at the number of leechers increasing. Hell, speed won't increase until there is another actual seeder, (not those fake ones). I won't get the game until it's completely uploaded by you, so probably not until tomorrow.

And trolls: STFU. This is a free game, so don't complain to the uploader who doesn't even have to do this. Sit back and relax. Everyone else with questions, read the first 4 pages of comments. It answers all your questions as to the credibility of this torrent.

Thanks again!"

The Steam client has been cracked for years. There are several launchers that can load steam games from the data files.

This game doesn't even do that, all you need is a cracked Steam client or launcher and you get full single and multiplayer."

From the civ 5 webpage: ""The demo allows you to play 100 turns of the game, and you get to choose from 3 of the 18 Civilizations that are in the full game.""

Since the demo limits you to TURNS, and limits YOUR choice of civ (but not the computer's), then the different between a demo and a full version should be 0 bits in size... merely a flag inside the exe to terminate game at 100 turns.

That being said, I haven't downloaded it, so for all I know it might actually be a demo... but same size =! must be demo.

Why are People such Retards? I mean, I've seen idiots barely able to hold spoon, but I never figured they will be able to download torrents...


1. how many of you finished downloading this? If you had, and its fake, feel free to bitch all you want. Otherwise it would be polite to give this guy benefit of doubt, as he's not only providing you with free game, but risking his ass too...

2. No its not same size as Demo. Demo is 3.85 GB on Disk, I've checked.

3. Demo is practically full version with only some features disabled via XML-s, one of reasons why it wasn't released earlier, as Civ community would find way quickly to unlock those features... Hence why such size of Demo, which is more curious too me than size of full game..

4. Learn bloody math... Guy said his upload is 60k. If he got only one conection, that guy will download it for 15 hours (30 if there is 2 connections)..

5. If this is still to slow, you can download it from Steam much faster.. only 50$/â‚¬

,thedarkM,2010-09-23T20:44Z,"I've been downloading this since the torrents was uploaded and the average download speed is 26 kB's/ second (currently at 56% completed). If ArticOne's upload speed has a cap of 60kB than it's still being uploaded pretty inefficient.

No one is running away because no one has finished it yet. Artic0ne is the uploader and sole 100% seeder still, the other seeders are fake."
,ibjhtt,2010-09-23T21:34Z,"FROM OAKWIND1 (posted earlier):

""Here is a FAQ for this thread:

Q: Why are there ""x"" seeders?
A: As of now(about 7 hours after release) there is only 1 seeder. If your client says there is more than 1 then ether the tracker has an error, people are using hacked clients, or anti-piracy groups are seeding bad data to slow down the swarm.

Q: Why is the torrent so small?
A: It's compressed to 3.51 gig, and decompresses to 5.4 gig. Civilization 4 was 1.38 gig on disk, and decompressed to 1.7 gig when installed. Top down turn based strategy games do not require massive amounts of data like a 3-d modeled world with large textures, and effects would.

Q: It was going so fast, and then it stopped, I'm stuck!
A: The one seeder has an upload rate of 60kbps and has only sent out 12.5% of the torrent. Right now there are 7800 people leaching (downloading) and they are the ones that gave you a good speed at the start. But, once they and you hit the 12.5% things will slow down till the seeder can seed the rest of the torrent.

Q: Why was ""x"" removed from the game?
A: This upload has [b]all game content[/b] and some bonus content. The only thing not included is the [b]bonus[/b] behind the scenes videos, and the [b]bonus[/b] musical content.

Q: But it says you can play it online! No one can crack a steam game!
A: Steam is distributing the game and doesn't control the online match making of this game, that is controlled by Gamespy.""

ALSO: please note that the fixed.exe file included in the torrent will not work correctly. The uploader accidentally included a Team Fortress 2 fixed.exe. The correct fixer file is in a separate torrent posted here by Angelo85. That file has been checked by several other users for viruses and it's OK."
,ibjhtt,2010-09-23T21:36Z,"And dyngyldai is either misguided or lying. His torrent isn't the same size and has only one file, so it's not Arctic0ne's. It's probably one of those uncracked retail disc ISOs floating around."
,Dogman78,2010-09-23T21:39Z,"To all the folks saying this is a demo cause of the file size... /smack. Then again, hell even if it is the demo, I would play it while I wait for another release, or just botch the turn limit."

Reading the comments would answer everyone of your questions. Trolls don't care, but noobs just gotta read. There are NO other seeders, just ArcticOne, so cool your jets. It won't go any faster until it's done, and this is the only good torrent. Be fucking patient for something that's free.

If someone deserves it then yes, but if you feel you are being exploited with cheap methods like 5$ per civ, then it's fair to exploit them back. 

Yes, you don't have to buy it if you don't like it but it's not the game itself you don't like, it's their policy, so you might aswell enjoy it. 

To realise how stupid they are, there are people who are paying extra as we speak, there are people that paid 50+$ and won't have access to Babylon, while we will...why? because they feel like the customer haven't paid enough for Babylon. 

And it's not like it's more work for them after release, they break the same release in pieces to make more money, that means that the 50$ customer takes an incomplete product while the 55$ takes the full game (if they haven't locked like 10 more civs...). 

We of course take the best version from both of them because their locked content is cracked...we take the version that should have been be on release in the first place. 

They could tempt pre-orders, deluxe editions and digital downloads with something else, not civs, and I would defenititely buy it.  

I did buy Starcraft 2 while it was more expensive, why? Because they don't charge extra for maps and to be able to use the DLClisk unit. 

It's their fault they lose money for being greedy sobs. "

And to be honest playing the demo for 100 turns when normally a game takes about 1000 or more, cant give you any freaking idea if you are gonna dump it in the first day, the first week or keep it dearly for years and years.

,PGMP1979,2010-09-24T01:00Z,"@papabear9

If you are gonna post shit like that at least drop the link to proof your words. There is 10 000 trolls downloading the torrent."
,ibjhtt,2010-09-24T01:01Z,"PROBLEMS...

HT papabear9...here's Arctic0ne on Demonoid:

""Ok, so after digging around the net, Win32DASM, HIEW, etc. I found that the game does indeed use CEG protection. This is generated for each .exe per customer. The RevLoader crack is not full proof, but may work for you. ReCEG is a dud, same with the Chinese 3dm team's crack. I believe Mafia II was CEG protected and SKiDROW was able to crack it. Quite honestly your best bet is to go ahead and wait for a full-proof crack to emerge. Note, that doesn't mean this version will not work for you. It may very well work.""

I'll add this: it MAY work, sure. But I think it's exceedingly unlikely to work if Arctic0ne didn't know it was CEG when he cracked it. CEG, if you don't know, is a process by which the main executable file is uniquely generated during installation, probably with the unique info coming over the Steam connection.  Which would explain why the scene groups haven't released it yet. Sigh."
,wtstalin,2010-09-24T01:04Z,"this is probably fake guys. come on do you really trust some random guy?
wait for the scene release...dont get your hopes up"
,kahunnas,2010-09-24T01:05Z,mmmm.... let us just wait and cross fingers!
,ibjhtt,2010-09-24T01:20Z,"OK did a bit more research on the CEG stuff...Mafia II IS a CEG game, and SKIDROW managed to do a 0day crack of it, with a crackfix the next day. So it's certainly doable. Makes you wonder why the scenesters have taken 3 days and counting to release Civ V. Maybe they just think it's funny to see ten thousand people glom onto this torrent, and they want to see it all play out first."

""A little update a; a word of warning, this game may not run on your system.

I have 7 computers at my home, with three that have the capability to run the game on high settings. I have tested it on all three and only two of the three will run the game. I have yet to discover the cause of this, but I will look into it further.

Currently I have gotten it to show the main menu, but crashes soon after. I am updating DX Video Drivers, etc. I will update to see if my fixes work for you."""

""When I started the game through the Steam library, I was presented with the option to run in DirectX 9 Mode, or DirectX 10&11 mode. Right click on the version you want and sent a shortcut to the desktop for your desired version. DO IT HERE, not from the Steam Library.

Next- right click on the shortcut, click properties, and then under the Shortcut Tab, change RUN to: Maximized (from Normal) and under compatibility, click off ""Disable Display scaling on high DPI settings"". My issue was a compatibility problem with my display - a 50"" 1080p plasma screen.""

Arctic0ne is the ONLY SEED right now(I don't care what TPB or uTorrent says). No one has hit and run. It's slow because Arctic0ne has a slow upload speed and he hasn't had enough time to upload a complete copy of the torrent yet...thus no seeds other then him.

To those who complain about leechers that don't upload enough and are ""greedy"",
Most people do not have a fast upload speed(like myself I cant up more than ~55kB/s) so they compensate for that by seeding for a longer time. I will probably keep seeding for over a month."

So why you ArcticOne begin to share the data only to few leachers when they gonna be ready very fast and then we gonna have much more real seeders.

If you decrease the upload slots for just seeders become more then every of those 20 k leachers gonna be much more quick and happy."

If it is fake, I suspect firaxis of a very clever marketing move. 20k+ people have been trying to get this game for days now, if it fails, they're not going to be happy, and I reckon a large number of them will aactually go out and buy the game out of frustration. "

,VirtualMark,2010-09-24T13:55Z,"I'm personally downloading this for a number of reasons. #

Firstly, i HATE Steam. I really hate it. It took over an hour to install and came up with a number of errors. In the end after trawling through numerous forums i found some advice that i could install it in safe mode, which worked. I shouldn't have to do this! Steam is the worst piece of software i have ever used, period.

Secondly, i want to try this before i buy it. The demo ended too soon and i hardly got going. 

Thirdly, when i do buy a copy, it will be in a few months time, when all the expansions come out. There will inevitably be a bundled version with all the expansions, civs etc. I'm not a fan of companies charging extra for more maps, civs etc, i like the old days when the game you bought was the finished version.

So the day when Firaxis release a finished product that doesn't come with some buggy copy protection, i'll buy it. Until then i shall play it for free, they haven't lost anything as i wouldn't buy it now anyway. There is no way in hell i'm letting Steam near my system again!"

I am really sorry that too many of us won't buy the game because firaxis worked hard to make us happy. I really appreciate their work. But as a habit in my self i cant imagin my self buying a game. But really, I am thinking of to buy this game just this once or probably just donate because they made me happy playing the demo and commenting on this beautiful page with you guys.

Why dislike Steam? Apart from the fact that it fucks up a lot of mods for a lot of games and won't let you play or patch except through their shitty launcher, Valve is constantly seeking to tighten it's control over digital downloads by getting companies to sign exclusive distribution agreements and installing their crap onto your computer out of the box.

Also, let me remind you, many of us will buy the game if we find it worthwhile. Hell, I found Hearts of Iron 2 on torrent and it introduced me to Paradox, I might have never heard of them otherwise. And for that, they gained a customer that loves their games. The same goes for something like this, if people like the game enough, they will buy it.

If your game keeps on crashing at the initial stages of the game like the start up screen or the first loading screen, you may want to try following workarounds.
1. Go to

â€œMy Documents\My Games\Sid Meiers Civilization 5\â€

and open usersettings.ini in Notepad. About 15 lines down you will find â€œSkipIntroVideo = 0â€³. Make this value 1. This will skip the intro video and you will be directly enter to the game menu. Again, make sure that you have the latest drivers and you reboot the PC after driver install and editing the ini file."

This is a torrent site, a good portion wouldn't pay for it. Also, with the decline of game quality, most people want to test a game out before forking over 50$(or is it 60?). Personally, I have no faith in the gaming industry as a whole, so if this seems worth the money, I would buy it for a hardcopy. Or wait for the game to go on sale, at a fair price."

The download is fine. What is required is a WORKING CRACK which requires TIME AND EFFORT and will not likely be produced so early after a game has been pirated. Stop bitching and whining and try to figure out a way around the crash yourselves, or fucking sit and shut up and wait for someone who actually knows what the fuck they're doing to release a decent crack.

Start Civilization 5 demo.
If you are in game, in 1st turn open Cheat Engine and press Civiliosation.exe
In value put 1 and press First scan.
Go back to game and on second turn but there value 2 and press Next scan. And so one around 10 - 20 times maybe.
Soon you will have about 3 green adresses on left window.
And then you can froze thous so your turn count will always stay same.

At least you can play until you have researched all tech. After that you are fucked, beacause you need to chose next research to finish turn.

3 - downloaded the Articone fixer (not sure if it helped)
4 - downloaded the Sid.Meiers.Civilization.V-SKIDROW.Crack.Only.7z (15mb that extracts into 80 mb, replaces a LOT of files from the release)
5 - launch Fixer from articone, creates shortcut / use same steam name that i created for the occasion
6 - launch game dx9 (i dont even have a dx10/11 video card anyway)

The intro played fine, i created a new game and no crash or anything, and that comes from a guy that even the demo crashed :-)

So, thanks to Arctic0ne, your effort was not in vain :-) and of course thanks to SKIDROW for the crack.

,AbbathDoomOcculta,2010-09-24T21:20Z,"@Archaryon

1) Download the game
2) Download Skidrow's crack here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5850241/Sid.Meiers.Civilization.V-SKIDROW-CrackOnly

3)Install the game and extract the crack.
4)Go to the shortcut for the game, right click and say Open File Location.

4) Copy the crack into the files for the game, replace the original launcher so only the crack launcher is in the folders.

5) Play :)"

,Whiterabbit2100,2010-09-24T22:12Z,"For those that have already got this game up and running congrats.

Like myself, I wanted to try out the LAN gameplay. Unfortunately Skidrow's crack replaces your username with ""SKIDROW"" making you unable to join LAN games that are hosted by  other ""SKIDROW"" players.

To bypass this, do the following:

1. Get the game unpacked and cracked using Skidrow's crack.
2. Go to the Civilization 5 directory and find the file called ""Steamclient.dll"" and open it with notepad.
3. Use ""Ctrl-F"" and type in the search box for ""skidrow"" and replace any that you find with your own username.
4. This will not replace the name with your chosen name however, but it replaces ""SKIDROW"" with your windows login name...so you can pretty much replace the word ""skidrow"" with anything else.
5. Save and close Steamclient.dll and start the game. An error will pop up. Just click ok and it will start up again.
6.Enjoy LAN :D"

,Kruniac,2010-09-24T23:50Z,"If anyone still has crash troubles with this release, I got mine to work as follows.

1: Download this release.

2: Unrar to whatever directory you choose.

3: Don't worry about fixer.exe.

4: Download the Skidrow crack (find it here, or download the full Skidrow release).

5: Apply the entire Skidrow crack folder contents, overwriting files as needed.

6: Go into My Documents/My Games/Civ 5/

7: Open UserSettings.ini and change SkipIntroVideo = 0 to SkipIntroVideo = 1

8: Open GraphicsSettingsDX9.ini and change FullScreen = 1 to FullScreen = 0

9: Run the game with Launcher.exe

Again, DO NOT WORRY ABOUT FIXER.EXE OR STEAM CRACKS. This release DOES work, but only if you apply the Skidrow crack. In fact, it seems that a lot of this release isn't needed. You guys might want to download the (I assume) ""cleaner"" Skidrow release, and go from there.

I'm not saying that you HAVE to follow these steps. I'm saying it worked for me. Fullscreen was crashing the game with an error. The intro movie crashed (just like with the broken Arctic crack). I fixed these two problems, and I've been playing Civ 5 for hours now. "

Did a fresh install with ActicOne, unzipped the crack, and copied everything over to fresh install and selected overwrite everything. To my surprise, it worked flawlessly, and I have been playing no without probs for last hour.

1 note, the 28meg file I originally downloaded, the 3 exe files to lauch game, came up with trojan virus, I had to disable norton360 just to get it to copy to game folder.

Just copy and paste three files from skidrow's file to Arctic0ne file directory and enjoy.

You dont need to install anything. Just when download is finished, open the file and make sure you copy skidrow's crack as i stated above and play. The shorcuts are already in the file you downloaded named Launch.exe."

Don't launch thev game from a broken shortcut on your destop. Make sure you have the latest directsx 9 or 11 for your computer. Make sure the file you dowmloaded is complete and not corrupted and also make sure all files in one directory. In my opinion, the error you getting because the icon you trying to click is out of main file directory or probably broken or it's not linked to the game directory

Just download SKIDROW'S CRACK and extract it to the game's installation directory.

If the game crashes after the intro movie, then your monitor can't display the game in fullscreen mode. In this case just play the game in windowed mode by editing the graphicsettings.

ARCTIC0NE VERSION IS FUNCTIONAL!

ARCTIC DA MAN!

This is what you got to do. Read carefully and follow carefully. Ok? Only 6 steps. Ok?

1. Make sure you have DirectX installed. Google search for 'DirectX Jun2010' and install this version or newer if you like.

2. Download Arctic0ne's updated Fixer.exe, at: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5847291/Civilization_V_updated_Fix_for_Arctic0ne__s_release. 

Then, unzip it. Overwrite contents into the main CIV folder.

3. Download Skidrow's crack for CIV, at: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5850241/Sid.Meiers.Civilization.V-SKIDROW-CrackOnly.

Then, unzip it. Overwrite contents into the main CIV folder.

4. Run the Fixer.exe. Create a game name. Create the shortcut that the shortcut option provides.

5. Go back to main CIV folder. Run the shortcut created by Fixer.exe, called 'Play Civilization V' (it has a red-arrow icon).

6. When the program starts, you are asked which DirectX version to use. Choose DirectX version 9 (if you had installed the DirectX version I mentioned above).

That's it!

Enjoy the game."
,Bollywood_Raja,2010-11-06T10:07Z,"LAN NOT WORKING? HERE'S THE SOLUTION.

You want to play a LAN game with your friends, but it keeps saying 'resolving host' but freezes?

Easy. This is what you do to solve the problem.

You need to edit the gameplayer name in the file 'steamclient.dll' in the folder containing your CIV files. 

Each LAN players' name MUST be different to play LAN.

How do you edit the name?

1. Use a hex editing program. A simple one can be downloaded here --> http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~prewett/hexedit/

2a. Make a backup of the 'steamclient.dll' file and keep it somewhere else.  

2b. Now, open the file 'steamclient.dll' in CIV folder with hexedit program.

3. Look for the row with the number 31040 (scroll down and observe the left-side column).

4. In the rightmost column there, you might see 'SKIDROW'. Change this name.

5. To change this name, change the numbers in the broad middle column.

6. Each row of digits in the broad middle column represents an alphabet letter. Number '53' is 'S', '4b' is I, and so on.

7. How do you know what number is a certain alphabet? Look for it here in the ASCII Table, 3rd column --> http://www.asciitable.com/

8. Change each number in the row 30140 of the 'steamclient.dll' file to get the alphabet letter you desire. Keep it to no longer than 7 characters.

9. Close the hex program (it should save the file).

10. Now you have a new name. Try playing LAN again. It should work."

,jigglesworth,2011-01-15T19:40Z,"1) THANK YOU ActicOne!! Also thanks to Skidrow for the fixes!
2) No there is no worldbuilder in this version.
3) It's not very glitchy once you get it running (sorry I can't help anyone with setup issues, I sort of fluked it all together).
4) Is anyone having issues with really really slow loads in this game? My computer exceeds all requirements but I wait 5 minutes for loads and it sometimes freezes.... should I have combined certain folders?"
,unexpect,2011-01-24T12:58Z,"DO NOT LISTEN TO TROLLS / PEOPLE TOO STUPID TO SET THIS UP ON THEIR OWN. THIS DOES PARTIALLY WORK.

If you are getting error messages about missing dlls, get the latest directx shit.

I say it only partially works, because although it does come precracked, the crack is horseshit, doesn't work, and leaves you with a couple of seconds of a 2k11 and gamespy logo before crashing. All you have to do is download the another crack, preferably the skidrow crack, which is not hard to find if you're capable of using a fucking search engine, then move and replace everything in the crack into you civ5 folder. 

once done, the game works fine, and thanks to Arctic0ne for the upload."
,yukarg,2011-01-29T03:24Z,"Okay guys here is the deal - DO NOT listen to the trolls or people who do not know what they are talking about.

I'm going to start by saying, this torrent IS legit, I have just finished downloading it and am currently seeding it (keep the seeds up guys!) the only problem is the crack that comes with it does not work... you will have to go and download the SKIDROW crack and the game will play perfectly fine, I just got done playing for about an hour to test it for you guys.

Link to the skidrow crack I used -
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5851928/Civilization_5_Crack_from_SKIDROW_this_one_works

Just download this and extract the contents into your Civilization folder and run it and it should be fine.

This was done on a fresh extraction of ArcticOne's upload (Which I thank you for GREATLY!) so if your having problems just do a fresh extraction from this and use the crack I linked and it should run perfectly fine. 

Hope I helped you guys out a little with all the confusion =D"

,DownScale,2011-04-07T18:18Z,"@albo_G : Make sure you're not running the DX11 .exe if your videocard doesn't support it, or if you're using XP, since XP doesn't support it.

You could also try:


Navigate to the Civilization 5 game settings location. This is usually Documents\My Games\Sid Meierâ€™s Civilization 5\

In this folder you will see various files ending with .ini extension. Open any one of these files with a text editor such as Notepad and you are good to go. Some of the files you may find inside include: 

Usersettings.ini â€“ holds user preferences 

GraphicsSettingsDX9.ini â€“ graphics settings for DirectX 9 mode

GraphicsSettingsDX11.ini â€“ graphics settings for DirectX 10/11 modes 

Config.ini â€“ general game preferences

Itâ€™s always recommended that you backup the original file before making modifications, in case anything goes wrong.
