OTHER COMMENTS...
Extracted this is ~4.5GB

The game is already updated and pre-cracked. All you have to do is extract with WinRAR anywhere on your PC and run the 'Civilization V' shortcut.

If you put the game anywhere but "D:\Civilization V\" you must edit the shortcut to reflect where you extracted it for everything to work right.

This edition comes with a special Steam pre-order gift, as well as some Deluxe Edition goodies.

Pre-Order Gift: 
- Cradle of Civilization Map Pack: Mesopotamia

Deluxe Edition:
- Bonus Babylon Civilization with leader "Nebuchadnezzar II" 
- Behind the Scenes at Firaxis with Civ V video feature*

*These are NOT included with the torrent, if you would like, I can upload them in a separate torrent once the initial torrent is nicely seeded.
I'm not going to include something that is not gameplay related for the sake of size.

You CAN play online with this game.

If you have extractor you game to ANYWHERE other than "D:\Sid Meiers Civilization V\" or would like to change your in-game name, run "Fixer.exe", which can be found where you extracted the game to.
