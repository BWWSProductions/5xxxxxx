"Pilot"

When well-meaning 23-year-old Jimmy Chance 
has a one-night stand with a wanted felon 
(guest star Phillips), he ends up being a 
dad to a bouncing baby girl. Inspired to do 
the right thing by his daughter, he has to 
convince his less-than-enthusiastic parents 
and great-grandmother (guest star Leachman) 
to help him raise her.

Enjoy :)
