,Jack_Raiden,2010-09-23T02:02Z,"Thanks Bezauk! Looks like a high-quality release! Appreciate the ""full"" (SD, 480p) resolution and stereo audio (instead of maiming 5.1 AAC at insufficient bitrate)."
,ancorda,2010-09-26T22:51Z,i give + status one of best quality what i ever seen on rips :-)
,i_am_sid,2010-10-22T17:01Z,Great guality. +1
,cursed_worm,2010-11-03T18:04Z,"You're awesome man :D, video quality is great, will seed ;)"
,S3nd41,2011-03-14T01:19Z,720x304 is not BR :\
,mal808,2011-07-05T01:57Z,"Bluray is the source; ""BRip"" implies it will be high quality as it is ripped _from_ a bluray disk; higher quality than a 720x304 DVDRip would be (DVD has only 540 horizontal pixels, so it would have to be upscaled to this resolution). If you want a higher resolution, download a larger file.

Thanks for keeping the soft subs! Great for people all over the world to be able to download the same (large) video file, and use their own (small, easily modifiable) subtitles files."
