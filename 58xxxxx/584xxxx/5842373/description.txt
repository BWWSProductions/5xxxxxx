Encoders Notes: I decided not to hardcode the subs for people that speak the language to enjoy the film without them.
So ive added the srt file instead of hardcoding them . To use the subs just move the srt file into the same folder as the movie, and name it the same as the movie. Tested
and working perfectly in media player classic. 
We hope you enjoy this release. Please seed, and we thanks for your support.
