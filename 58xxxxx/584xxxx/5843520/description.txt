Bill Kipp on situational awareness.


The Missing Link
Self-Protection Through Awareness, Avoidance, and De-Escalation
with Bill Kipp

No matter what fighting style or system you practice, there's no getting around the fact that the best defense is not having to fight at all. Unfortunately, this missing link in self-defense training has been largely ignored â€“ until now.

In this original Paladin video production, self-defense expert Bill Kipp teaches you the verbal and psychological skills you need to preempt violent attacks and end fights before they start. Kipp first explains the normal human reactions to confrontation and how they can instantly mark you as an easy target. He then reveals proven strategies that enable you to take control of a situation, assertively de-escalating potential conflicts and repelling would-be attackers. Through a variety of dramatic scenarios, you'll also learn when and why to make eye contact, how not to get "hooked" by a predator's taunting words and the secrets of transforming the adrenal rush of a confrontation into an effective, assertive defense.

The Missing Link is one of the most important self-protection videos ever produced and is must-see viewing for anyone who is serious about personal safety. For information purposes only. This video contains adult language.





Bill Kipp is a black belt martial artist and former special forces Recon Marine who worked as a stuntman, bodyguard, bouncer and self-defense instructor before becoming certified to teach scenario-based adrenal stress response conditioning in 1988. As the founder and president of FAST Defense, he now leads workshops and conducts instructor training in his FAST Defense and EZ Defense systems internationally.
