I'm tasked with finding better tech for our transcode process from artist uncompressed output to our digital signage workflow. If you could school me, I'd even be willing to compensate you somehow...

Hit me up!

Again, flawless releases brother... Keep it up."

You see they use words like ""Video Commpresion Technique"", ""Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer"", ""Video colour matrix"", ""Video Attributes"", ""Audio Attributes""All words bulls**t to make people believe they""re the best. Especialy the word ""eBDRip"", witch  mean there copy is better then the original. To me pursonaly  this sound like ""The God create the world but will make better copy"" Ha Ha Ha Ha. Good Luck guys!"
