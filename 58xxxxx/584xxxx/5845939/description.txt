The highly skilled Federale Machete is hired by some unsavory types to assassinate a
senator. But just as he's about to take the shot, he notices someone aiming at him
and realizes he's been set up. He barely survives the sniper's bullet, and is soon out
for revenge on his former employers, with the reluctant assistance of his old friend
Cheech Marin, who has become a priest and taken a vow of nonviolence. If you hire
him to take out the bad guys, make sure the bad guys aren't you!  Written by

Three years ago in Mexico, determined Federale Machete (Danny Trejo) is betrayed
and set-up by his boss, resulting in his wife and child being murdered by drug kingpin
Torrez (Steven Seagal). Now, in Texas, Machete resurfaces when hired to
assassinate Senator McLaughlin (Robert De Niro), an extreme advocate against illegal
immigration. Once again betrayed and set-up, Machete plots his revenge against the
men who've wronged him with the help of resistance fighter Luz (Michelle Rodriguez),
ICE Agent Sartana (Jessica Alba), and the shotgun-toting Padre (Cheech Marin).
