"Together with Orson Welles' Citizen Kane and John Singleton's Boyz 'n 

the Hood, director Peter Bogdanovich's Targets  is among the most 

impressive first features ever made. When Bogdanovich's cinematic 

mentor Roger Corman suggested that Bogdanovich  might want to make 

his directorial debut, he offered to "donate" 20 minutes worth of footage 

of the Corman-directed The Terror and the services of Boris Karloff [...] 

The script, by Bogdanovich and his then-wife, Polly Platt, was inspired by 

the 1966 shooting spree of Texas Tower sniper Charles Whitman".
