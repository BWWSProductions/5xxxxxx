This book is intended to accompany a text used in the first course in thermodynamics that is required in all mechanical engineering departments, as well as several other departments. It provides a succinct presentation of the material so that the students more easily understand the more difficult concepts. Many thermodynamics texts are over 900 pages long and it is often difficult to ferret out the essentials due to the excessive verbiage. This book presents those essentials.
