,Nicodeamonus,2010-10-02T23:35Z,"AVG Anti-virus says the keygen contains the Trojan ""Generic 16.CIPF"" whatever that is.  The installation file for the program itself is virus free.  I ran the keygen in a virtual machine and it does generate correct key information.  If you have virtualization, take a snapshot, run the keygen,  copy the key, and restore the snapshot.  

Otherwise, this key works: 
  Username: System Admin
  Key: GMHHK-KEILV-JDQRS-EVFJB-TMJGL-KOQFA-TLKED-TQEMR"
