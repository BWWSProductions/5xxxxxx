,kivilcik,2011-07-29T22:20Z,I spent about an hour trying to unpack this or recover it with Recovery Toolbox for Rar - no luck. What a disappointment.
,kivilcik,2011-08-23T21:57Z,"...Hallelujah, I found a way to unpack it: do it in Winrar programme itself and check ""Keep broken files"". Whew.
Thanks for the movie."
