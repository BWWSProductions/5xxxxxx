I recommend that everyone try this show, especially if you liked the movie Point of No Return, cuz this is based on the movie.

It is based on the 1990 French film Nikita, 1993 remake Point of No Return, and the 1997 television series La Femme Nikita.

The series stars Maggie Q  as Nikita, a spy and assassin who has gone rogue. She is now working to bring down Division, the secret government agency which recruited her. Meanwhile, Division trains its next crop of young killers.

Show Nfo - When she was a deeply troubled teenager, Nikita (Maggie Q, "Mission Impossible III") was rescued from death row by a secret U.S. agency known only as Division, who trained her as a spy and assassin. Nikita was eventually betrayed by the only people she thought she could trust. Now, after three years in hiding Nikita is seeking retribution and making it clear to her former boss, Percy (Xander
Berkeley, "24") and her former friends Michael (Shane West, "E.R.") and Birkhoff (Aaron Stanford, "X-Men: The Last Stand) that she will stop at nothing to expose and destroy their covert operation. Division continues to recruit and train other young people, among them Jaden (Tiffany Hines, "Bones") and Thom (Ashton Holmes, "Boston Legal"), erasing all evidence of their former lives and turning them into cold and efficient killers. One of these new recruits, Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca, "Kick-Ass") is a beautiful girl with a violent past and a story not so different from Nikita's. The recruits all spend part of their training with Amanda (Melinda Clarke, "The O.C."), a master manipulator who can turn any ugly duckling into a swan and any bleeding heart into a killer.
