I made this compilation of great rare and obscure 60Â´s girls and girlgroups from various countries in Asia. ( Mostly from Singapore and Hong Kong ).


I hope that I have spelled the songtitles right ( and the names also ). Got some of these on mp3 files from some rocking friends all over the world, so there may be some glitches here and there. The Dara Puspita tune 6 on CD 2 is one that I donÂ´t have the songtitle for. So any help with the songs on that EP
( their second one ) is appreciated.


And please comment if you like this 2 CD pack. Have material for an 2 CD with some rocking guys and instrumental groups in the same style as this CD. Maybe that will be my next upload. Time will tell.


I also made front and rear covers that you can check out here:

Will seed this until I see itÂ´s going by itself, the IÂ´ll delete it from my computer, so itÂ´s up to you to keep it alive so keep seeding. If it donÂ´t show that IÂ´m seeding itÂ´s just because of my IP blocker.


NOTE!  When you burn these ( in Nero ) be sure to have the " Normalize all audio files " box checked
so will you get an more even level on the songs. ( Some are pretty low in sound ).

Rock on!
