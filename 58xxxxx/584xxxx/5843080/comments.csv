,hookswoop,2010-10-04T03:05Z,"While I agree with me.me.me that this is the same cop show with the same crimes and the same stories we have all seen 1000 times...

this one happens to have Grace Park, the most beautiful and sexy woman on television. The show itself is 6 stars, but every scene with grace bumps it to 10 stars!"
