,CarolR,2010-10-03T10:34Z,"Thanks for this. But I am stuck at 65%. All it's doing is seeding, and based on what I've gotten so far, I've seeded 6 ratio. Any possibility of someone giving some assistance to get the rest of this great upload?
Also... request... I've been looking for ages for a movie called The Misadventures of Margaret. If you have it, can you post, or maybe direct me toward somewhere that does. Thx again!"
,CarolR,2010-10-03T23:52Z,"A big sloppy kiss to whomever helped send the last 34% down the pipe!! I have the full file now and will try to seed as long as possible.
On quality: 10/10. Excellent!
I love the soft coded subs and this is full resolution w/out being a 2gb file!
Would love to know what program(s) are used to achieve both."
