A charming and ambitious young man finds many ways to raise himself through the ranks in business and social standing - some honest, some not quite so. If he can just manage to avoid a certain very predatory woman...


This terrific 1952 British black and white movie directed by Ronald Neame (with an inspired casting of a young Alec Guinness as Arnold Bennett's wonderful character, the upwardly-mobile Denry Machin), loses none of the story's magic and captures the flavour of the period (from about 1888 and onwards) and the Potteries (North Staffordshire, England) absolutely perfectly. The ballroom scene (among many others) is an utter delight.
