,Tramontan,2010-09-24T15:49Z,Its like DVD RIP of movie
,Tramontan,2010-09-25T00:46Z,"I have a small upload speed, so please, have patience) 
and stay here as long as you can"
,Vaare,2010-09-29T14:01Z,Threw this up on my box. Once it's finished it'll be blazing fast for any who download.
,Tramontan,2010-11-02T18:02Z,"some newest lessons (about 3-4 form 118) have not project files, its not my bad... try to find them later, now they not availble"
,frostraver,2011-01-13T19:33Z,"Very good torrent.
Been downloading this with 2mb/s for some time now.
Please seed people. I'm seeding as much as I can and a lot of people will be pleased"
,Vaare,2011-01-15T18:11Z,"I've seeded this 61 times over right now. That's 4.45 TB of data transferred. Currently an average of 1mb/s, max around 3mb/s. I'll keep on. But as always, the more people seeding the better. It's a big ole torrent, so seed at least to 2.0 ratio if you can. :)"
,shawbaday,2011-01-24T23:30Z,"Great Torrent !!!
Thanks Tramontan . Keep it up !!!
Next time pls try to break up the Entire into different torrents to make it easier on us. Im sure well get more seeders and we can choose which files to download ..."
,Tramontan,2011-01-27T18:53Z,"Hm) actualy I was thinking to make another torrent with all my collection of DT lesson (3d max, maya, XSI, zbrush, nuke, and some others). 

Do u realy think, that is better make a pices? 
Like DT 1, DT 2? I think it not verry comfortably... But u have time to choose 1 big torrent or 3-5 little, so write here how do u see it. 
Total size of next ~ 140 GB
And I almost done Gnomon RIP of maya lesson and some gnomology)"
,Vaare,2011-01-29T15:35Z,"Tramontan, don't upload them all together. Upload them separately by program. One for Maya, 3DSMax, etc. Most people don't want to seed that much just to get a few videos, especially not for programs they don't use.

This one is big enough, don't make one at 140GB."
,Tramontan,2011-01-29T20:28Z,"there is no need to download everything when u download any torrent
but i thougt recently, that I just couldn`t  do it... my poor upload speed just wold not alow me do this
so u win (just kidding)"
,Vaare,2011-02-05T22:43Z,"You don't have to download everything, but to be recognized as a seeder you have to complete the torrent. More people will complete a torrent if it holds just what they want. Ergo, the more you split them up, the more seeders will stay on."
,rainus,2011-03-18T13:05Z,"Guys, don't disable upload. This torrent is terribly slow without it :|"
,Vaare,2011-03-30T07:47Z,"I'm still seeding this.

165 times over so far. That's 12TB uploaded. Why is the seed/leech ratio still so poor?"
,Tramontan,2011-04-09T11:25Z,"I`m always here with my 100 Kb\s and it is not stable, unfortunately it is all that I can at all. So uploaded only 432 Gb. But! 7-8 ppl always seed, and many share during downloading. What the problem than? I think it is cuz many ppl loading simultaneously, in this moment (was to u when u will read) 34. So... As I told - have patience) It will never disappear, just wait and help other get verry good content. And tnx all who help, specially Vaare! "
,NelisW2,2011-05-04T18:03Z,"does this have the videofiles in it? 
I have downloaden an other maya tutorials torrent with only a still picture with audio underneath.

How the hell can this be helpful for modeling if i cant see what they are talking about??"
,Tramontan,2011-05-07T08:35Z,"Dear NelisW2, Digital Tutors it is a video tutorials"
,durmitor,2011-05-21T08:50Z,"Thank you Tramontan for great upload. I just finished downloading, it took about seven days. I will keep seeding till at least 2, but my upload is only averaging 150kB/s so I'll stick around for a while. Again thanx for the collection, this is extremely useful. "
