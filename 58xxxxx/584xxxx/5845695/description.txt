Duke Nukem 3d Atomic - WinXP-Vista-Win7 compatible and Internet Multiplay
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After looking around some time on the web I concluded that this version called Duke3dw is simply the best version av Duke Nukem 3d Atomic. This awesome game!
It is not only the best in my opinion, it is the only one you can run without hassle on Windows 7.
It is made by Ken Silverman and his friends. The man who built the original build engine. 

I made 3 directories.

Duke3dw 4.2.0:        for old computers and computers without 3d card
Duke3dw lrp:          for notebooks and slow computers
Duke3dw hrp:          for computers which is say less than 5 years old
