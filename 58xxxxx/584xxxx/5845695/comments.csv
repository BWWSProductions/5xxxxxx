[V],MartinBLCK,2010-09-22T16:15Z,"@Jokinen84
The highresolution graphics is already comressed.

Btw. 
Multiplaying works really fine. We played 3somes, the dedicated host/slave type.
Someone has to host and the other players have to join on the host's ip.
All three variants of duke3dw are compatible with each other in a multiplayer game."
[V],MartinBLCK,2010-09-22T19:46Z,"@Dark_64
Apparently, it has to do with your video card.
Try downloading latest drivers from ATI/AMD.

btw.
There is a launching program creating duke games on the internet called YANG.

But it seems that you have to forward ports 8501 and 25513 on your router and open the same port in the firewall."
,1TWISTED,2010-09-24T16:52Z,"thanks,.. nice job,.. well done,.. ; )"
,Mitzos,2010-09-28T14:23Z,does this have full mouse support?
,mitis77,2010-10-15T19:48Z,"Thanks so much for this. DN is a fuckin' classic, all time best shooter ever ;) Let's Rock :D"
,summonedtitan,2010-10-20T23:31Z,"Just downloaded, i like the fact you tried makin' it for the old/moderate/new computers, but its kinda pointless now adays, if they don't have the right stuff, its not gonna work, you added in so much bullshit that it made my head spin...

After scanning with NORTON findin' no virus buggies was nice... :)

Anyway, since there was no install, its kinda like an extract n play I hit up the file that was for my comp (as you specified) and clicked on the orange duke nukem icon and it worked, no probs. (Made a new file my self in C and moved all files over). Gonna find out if it works all the way through... Will see me later."
,infid3l,2010-10-23T10:25Z,let's rock!
,Puma__84,2010-11-05T06:10Z,works great!! Duke Nukem 3D are awesome : )
[V],MartinBLCK,2010-11-05T15:52Z,"Forgot to tell. Start the game by running duke3dw.exe. Set the resolution and go. While in game you can set the brightness, keys and the screen size. If you want the old HUD then change the screen size.

,iuiu,2010-12-19T22:51Z,"Nice, but the music freezes randomly every time.

How do I fix this?"
,pow.r.pop,2011-02-21T18:34Z,"All the menus are white blocks. 
everything else seems fine.
Any idea why all the options menus are white blocks?

Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks"
,Cunz,2011-02-21T21:52Z,"same problem as pow.r.pop

,Cunz,2011-02-21T22:21Z,"also i cant see the botton bar with my life, armor, weapons

,Deezo420,2011-02-27T00:51Z,Hail to the King baby!! thanx for the up! Can't wait till' Forever finally drops!
[V],MartinBLCK,2011-03-12T14:23Z,"@pow.r.pop: Try a lower resolution, e.g. 1280x720 works fine and the white pixels are gone

@cunz: goto video options/screen size and select size "
,djmj,2011-03-19T11:40Z,"//All the menus are white blocks//

If you are using Ati grafic card, just uncheck Texture compression button :)"
,deathwish422,2011-04-04T02:41Z,great game

,StrayButler91,2011-04-22T08:26Z,Is this the freeware version? It says I only have 1/4 of the game and I need to purchase the full version... HELP?!
,bluecar5556,2011-04-25T08:49Z,Is there an easy way to get the MIDI music working?  It's using Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth under xp x86
,Bujaaa,2011-07-02T19:29Z,It works but i have no HUD in the game so i can't see my health and ammo. Any advice?
,hyperspaced,2011-11-17T23:34Z,"THX nice torrent, all works fine "
,thenaughtons,2012-01-07T14:35Z,"well done MartinBLCK!!!!!!! works perfectly on my win 7 ultimate x86. i used the lrp file for notebooks. i set the settings to maximum on the settings option that opens before the game, and got perfect graphics as my laptop has an ati mobility radeon 3430 graphics card. runs smoothly. well it should because it runs doom 3 without an issue."
,supermario5029,2012-06-21T10:52Z,i recommend playing with eduke32 for modern awesomeness and more compatibility!!!
