Methods Of Mayhem - A Public Disservice Announcement

Metal combo Methods of Mayhem was formed by frontman Tommy Lee after quitting his drumming duties in MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e. Born Thomas Lee Bass on October 3, 1962, in Athens, Greece, he grew up in Los Angeles, co-founding the band Christmas with bassist Nikki Sixx in 1981; with the subsequent additions of guitarist Mick Mars and singer Vince Neil, the group was renamed MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e and immediately became a top attraction on the local hard rock scene. Signing to Elektra in 1983, the CrÃ¼e emerged as one of the best-selling and most notorious metal bands of the era, scoring a series of hit albums including 1985's Theatre of Pain, 1987's Girls, Girls, Girls, and 1989's Dr. Feelgood; famed for their glamorously excessive offstage antics as much as their music itself, Lee in particular became steady tabloid fodder in 1986 with his marriage to Dynasty vixen Heather Locklear, a tumultuous relationship which ended in divorce eight years later. 

Even as MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e's fortunes waned, Lee remained in the limelight thanks to his 1995 marriage to pin-up Pamela Anderson, a union which produced two children as well as an infamous homemade sex video which became a bestseller. Run-ins with the law were also common: in 1997, he and Sixx were arrested after encouraging fans to rush the stage during a concert stop in Phoenix, and a year later Lee was arraigned for assaulting a photographer. Most scandalously, in May 1998, he was sentenced to six months in jail for assaulting Anderson, although the two later reunited. He left MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e in 1999, collaborating with rapper TiLo on Methods of Mayhem, an all-star project featuring input from Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, the Crystal Method, Kid Rock, Snoop Dogg, and Mix Master Mike. Signing to MCA, Methods of Mayhem issued their self-titled debut LP in late 1999. The record went platinum, but the group disbanded in 2000, only to be resurrected in 2009. The groupâ€™s sophomore effort, A Public Disservice Announcement, was released the following year on Loud & Proud/Roadrunner Records. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi
