Anthony Mann - God's Little Acre [Uncensored]
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051666


Anthony Mann's film based on Erskine Caldwell's book about obsessive faith in 'hidden gold' by an eccentric family of simple southern sharecroppers has quite a history. It was initially banned in many states compelling a theatrically presented 'toned-down' version. Censorship revolved mostly around young Tina Louise's excessively healthy boobs.

The most consistent supporting actor ever; Robert Ryan, holds the charm with some interesting inclusions in the cast. Aldo Ray plays inflexible in-law Bill, who can't accept that the local plant has shut down... once '50s pinup, Fay Spain plays the unwed nubile sister... Buddy Hackett of 'Buddy Hackett' fame plays the candidate for local Sheriff and "Little House on the Prairie" 's Michael Landon portrays the kidnapped albino worker (didn't you know - "they're good luck!"). All in all this is just too good a film to be so forgotten. It resonates feelings of isolation, bigotry, self-importance, small town lust, and warping materialism. With Mann steering the ship this is racy comedy that plays as a sanctinfy'in fable. You gotta see this...
