Los Bravos were a Spanish beat group, formed in 1965, and based in Madrid. Their single "Black Is Black" reached #2 in the United Kingdom in July 1966, and #4 in the United States (the first Spanish group to do so) selling over a million records
The band were an amalgamation of two pop groups, Los Sonor and The Runaways. Los Bravos' lead singer, Mike Kogel, was from Germany. His vocal styling was sometimes likened to Gene Pitney's. Their single "Black Is Black" reached #2 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1966  and #4 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, the first Spanish group to achieve this. The song sold over one million copies world wide. The track was written by Tony Hayes and Steve Wadey, in their recording studio for cutting demo discs in Hoo St Werburgh, near Rochester, Kent, England.The song was later covered by Johnny Hallyday and the French-based outfit Belle Epoque, and in 1977 their disco version of the song coincidentally also reached #2 in the UK.

Los Bravos' follow-up single, "I Don't Care", reached #16 in the UK in October 1966. In 1967 the band participated in the Sanremo Music Festival, failing to qualify for the final with the song "Uno come noi" in Italian. The band were the subjects of two Spanish comedic movies: in 1967 Los chicos con las chicas (The Boys With the Girls), directed by Javier Aguirre and in 1968, Â¡Dame un poco de amooor...! (Give Me a Little Looove!), directed by JosÃ© MarÃ­a ForquÃ© and Francisco MaciÃ¡n. Their song "Going Nowhere" from the soundtrack to Los chicos con las chicas was re-issued as a part of the Rhino Records series, Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond, 1964â€“1969.

One of Los Bravos' founding members Manuel Fernandez committed suicide on 20 May 1967, at the age of 23, after the death of his bride Lottie Rey in an auto accident.
