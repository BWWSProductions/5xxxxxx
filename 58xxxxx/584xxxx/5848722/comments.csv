,IXISHADOW,2011-05-28T23:44Z,Seed people?!  A 39MB download should not take 2 hours! This desperately needs more seeds. 
,Z0001,2011-09-21T13:35Z,"Please help. I downloaded the whole torrent, but after unzipping the files, there are only four different types of emulator folders.
How do i play the actual games? Because when i try to load any files, the emulator can't detect suitable ones. 
Thanks for the torrent, btw. Hope you can work this out :S"
