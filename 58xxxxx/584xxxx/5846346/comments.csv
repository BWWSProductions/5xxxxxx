,kodytill,2010-10-25T07:47Z,"Ok. I extracted one of the ag-cx files. Then I extracted it again to get out the installer and keygen.

When I go to run the installer, I get....
""CRC failed in 'WordPerfectInstaller_PRO.exe'. File is broken.""

could anyone help?"
,Tuzito,2010-10-26T16:24Z,"Hi, I've downloaded it twice 'n always frezze on the 1st EULA, the ""Next"" button do nothing. Wait a lot, try to run the setup w/ command line option after editing the iso and still nothing. Same results on 2 computers: a) Vista HoPe 32 --- b) Win 7 x64.  Ideas anyone?"

,bidijo,2010-11-18T19:40Z,where do I find the installation code for the keygen? 
,renaldoaoa,2010-11-24T00:57Z,"Never had a problem running anything off here for years, until now.

I get an error...

You need to have the following volume to continue extraction.. Next volume required...
C:\Documents and Settings\x\Desktop\New Folder\AGAiN.r00

Ive tired every flavor I can think of and still no luck.

,adapter0086,2010-12-11T18:05Z,@renaldoaoa You could use the keygen from this but you are going to have to download the wordperfect directly from Corel's Website.
,chamodude,2010-12-16T09:50Z,"Listen, this torrent is so rubbish! I waisted my time downloading something that is not complete but missing a file when you decompress. Disgusting torrent!"
,Al.Catraz,2011-02-10T01:28Z,"OK!
I cannot make this work -- the install, I mean
I get a bunch of ZIP files.
Can those who got it to work explain -- step by step - how to do this? I am not sure how/where to extract the ZIPs to. Put them all in one directory/folder or each ZIP o its own folder...??

Please post help notes..

THANKS!!"
,stihlcut,2011-02-13T19:26Z,right click on extract here for each one then open the first first one again and the rest will automatically extract together
,Al.Catraz,2011-02-19T04:15Z,"Thanks STIHLCUT!
But that's not very clear either..
""OPEN THE FIRST ONE AGAIN""  -- do you mean the extracted folder AG-CX501?
Within it there is another . RAR   file... is that it?"
,r_virus,2011-04-06T19:53Z,"well whoever facing any probs regarding zip issue...
1. install winrar first
2. ....then select all the zip file
3. right click then click estract here
4. when prompted overwrite ,click yes to all
5. u have the again folder"
,r_virus,2011-04-06T19:55Z,"oopz ..i mean ""again"" folder which includes keygen & main install file

,Nicomaco,2011-04-22T16:37Z,Thanks. Good work!
,ju22bu,2011-06-24T19:22Z,Thaks for great upload but I`m facing problems activating it via keygen. Isn`t there any faster way than trying to find my actual serial number so that the activation code would do? Thanks for help
,Quentin360SA,2011-08-09T13:04Z,"Whats with the ""-20"" ?

This torrent works and its not even complicated.

If you've got some ""extracting"" knowledge then its easy.

Keygen works 100% and ME (Microsoft Essentials) didn't pick up any viruses.

,nrkadilz,2011-09-25T22:26Z,"if anyone has problem with the torrent!!!!!!!!!!

,gurumarkb,2011-10-10T19:08Z,"I downloaded the 30 day trial version direct from Corel and got the Core keygen from CODYBOSS1969:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6283225/Corel.WordPerfect.Office.X5.Keymaker-CORE_fast.Url.for.X5-CODY

Corel downloaded at 850 to 900K/bps so I had it quickly.  The install key ""nrkadilz"" lists would not allow for the Core X5 Keygen to create an ""activation code"", kept saying the serial number was bad so I had to uninstall, re-install using a serial number from the keygen, then unplug my network adapter, run Quattro Pro, and activate off-line with the phone activation method.  That all worked perfectly.

Yes the keygen utility is flagged as an infection by my NOD32 AV but I've ssen that many times before and it's not really a ""false positive"" as NOD32 does indicate that it is a key generator type of malware but for this all other keygen's to install and activate programs you can dismiss your AV's warning as a false threat.  If you are still unsure or paranoid that the keygen will infect Windows then install Sandboxie or other ""sandbox"" type utlity and run the keygen inside it.  "
,Spawn1015,2011-11-16T02:22Z,how do i get the activation code?
,theBoxer2,2011-12-05T06:39Z,"Still need to get activation code. I attempted to install as previously suggested but after extracting the 'first file' into another .rar file, it wont open? hellllppppp"
,nrkadil,2012-04-26T11:48Z,"WordPerfect(R) Office
Purchase serial number: 
WP15R03-T9F5KHZ-JSY3X3V-YXSLLT4-Q9GNN

Activation Code:07EF-61DA-3B7A-4D7F-1924

Just enjoy... it works perfect... do choose phone method to activate and register....
just extract all files... then extrcat again folder... setup ll be dre... else you may download setup direct from the web & use keygen directly..."
