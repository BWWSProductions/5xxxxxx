These rips are for people that want to replace their low resolution dvd copies with a lot better quality blu-ray copies but don't have the extra disk space.

I love the file size and the quality on these rips for this size is awesome.

If you have terabytes of free space for movies, just sort the torrents by file size to see the 20GB  torrents first and ignore the rest.

To each his own.
I give my +1 to this torrent, thank you amit6666!"
