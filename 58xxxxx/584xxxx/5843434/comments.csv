Although one thing I'd like to suggest. In future; get rid of that stuff that follows the show. Pirate version is sposed to be much better because its been stripped of adverts and crap. I know its 'Veronica Mars' relevant but its exactly what we hate about TV ad's.... Its 300% the volume of the show, so when I'm watching, it ends, it wakes up my family, and it gives spoilers for the following episode. (also, in that annoying, over-dramatic american voice, and ridiculous over-dramatic music. But its still really annoying when plot twists are BLASTED OUT REALLY LOUD BEFORE THE EPISODE BEGINS.

Coming up next time on Veronica Mars.... 
""I'M PREGNANT!!!!!!""      ....*begin episode*
*facepalm*"
