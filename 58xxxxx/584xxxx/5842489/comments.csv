,TienShen,2011-01-05T10:36Z,"ONLY WITH ME?  I'm using this for a long time on 2 machines, one with ver 4.6 and ALWAYS, no mather version or anything else, after 1 month more or less, the program go back to trial and don't save the serial or any kind of info. Only way: unnistall and re-install after restart to get another month.
SO, I ASK: any way to make the registration PERMANENT? If so, how to?
(PC-1=Vista HomePre X32, ver 4.6 to 4.7
 PC-2=Win 7 Ultimate X64, ver 4.7)
Any idea its very welcome. OTHER: How to make the virtual's drive autorun ON? Windows manage it like a simple folder mostly.

Great program even with this cons, and great upload as always; thanks to you ChattChitto"
