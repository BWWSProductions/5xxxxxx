[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-09-28T00:03Z,@Antiquado that would be a false positive! look it up on google.
,jbscythe,2010-10-15T03:29Z,anybody out there looking for Star Wars - Force Commander pc game? here it is full and no install or crack needed. just extract and play. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5887563/Star_Wars_-_Force_Commander.rar
,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-26T22:18Z,"Let's get around his
bullshit though by doing the following:

In both games, delete 1eyed.exe & 2eyed.exe UNLESS you like being flipped the bird. This prog. does NOTHING for the install.

Next, edit ALL of his batch files and CHANGE THE ORDER of called .uha files to be Unarc'd.
Start with the largest one first, tectec.uha because you want that one DELETED first to free disk space.

Now why the HELL this masturbating little VIRGIN jerkoff needs to ""DUPE"" Gigs of files
with _install.bat, I have NO clue but I think you do not need to be doing that, save a couple gigs right there! I will check this.

Yous should also REM out all lines in his batch files which call for .uha file deletion, otherwise you'll be right back here like I am now D/L'ing the shit AGAIN!

I don't even know if this turkey will run on my box yet.

RC_Ebooks at 2010-10-26 21:55 CET:
These 2 games are POORLY put together: It should be in a separate directory and the batch files should call to that area during build, instead he DELETES the source files as the batch goes on. So if the 1st load fails, you're fucked w/o the source files! FUCKING IDIOT!"
,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-27T09:35Z,You also need a Gfx card which supports Pixel Shader 1.1 and the software fix for it doesn't work on my box... so lots of time wasted regardless.

[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-01-08T11:04Z,"@RC_Ebooks get a life retard. trying to toss pointless insults at someone providing you with free games is just plain dumb and makes you the ""virgin jerkoff"" you are mad cause you can't get any.

@ivanhoe68 avg is the worst anti virus there is out. and you need to look up false positive. why? because this torrent contains no viruses, or any other harmful files to a pc. LEARN IT, LIVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!"
