Toby Temple, born to a struggling German butcher and his wife in 1920s Detroit, has always wanted to make his strict mother happy. He finds that he has a great talent for mimicry and parody; his mother encourages him to develop this into an entertainment career. After he is forced to leave home for his own safety (having got the daughter of a local policeman pregnant), Toby travels the country for several years as a small-time comedian, performing in cheap, filthy clubs and living frugally, always dreaming of big success and denied by indifferent show-business executives. Finally, aged 27, Toby seduces the crippled owner of a drama school, who introduces him to famous Hollywood agent Clifton Lawrence. Recognising Toby's talent, Lawrence coaches him for a more upmarket gig, which leads to a Las Vegas hotel act, turning out to be a huge success. Thereafter, Toby rapidly becomes a rich and famous celebrity: doing stand-up tours across America, entertaining American troops in Korea, starring in Hollywood movies, and later in his own TV show. He remains a lonely man, although he surrounds himself with a vast entourage and seduces countless women."
