Now it will take until tomorrow before there are seeders and I don't feel like waiting that long so I have to suffer through low res which I am guessing is what many people do.

Take away the low res 350MB versions and leave only the 1GB mkv.  Watch the numbers rise."
,yeah169,2010-09-24T06:19Z,"or at least upload the 720p a few hours first instead of the other way around.

there's no reason for such low quality files.  I don't get it unless you're running a 10 year old computer, and you guys that watch movies on your little game boys that's just ridiculous."
,Mystik_Systems,2010-09-24T13:39Z,"i completly agree with ""yeah169"" :) why should we watch low res ??? we already got ""HD, BlueRay"" resolutions for a while now, so i think it's time for ppl to upgrade they hardware and leave ""low res"" for ever :)"
,DimDim.Jay,2010-09-24T23:34Z,haha agreed i guess! thnxx 4 uploading!
,vimann,2011-02-24T00:07Z,"Well guys, sorry to dissapoint you, but a lot and i do mean A LOT of people have old/crappy computers that can't play HD and even CRT monitors. (I myself upgraded because i think the quality is too sweet.) There are more unfortunate people that can't afford newer hw or they simply contend with what they have. In time things will change"
