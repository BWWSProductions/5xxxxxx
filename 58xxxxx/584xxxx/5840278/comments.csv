,mister15,2010-09-19T19:17Z,And WHY THE FUCK DON'T YOU SEED YOUR OWN TORRENT WHEN YOU PUT IT OUT??????????
,koukos4,2010-09-19T19:53Z,"jesus...i m seeding guys
and sorry for the result :)"
,PeriodRevival,2010-09-19T20:15Z,"I made it all this time without finding out the score to the game today, come here to download and seed FOREVER and you ruined the score for me.  What an ass."
,mister15,2010-09-19T20:40Z,"Again, thanks for the upload, koukos4...I am downloading, but it doesn't come up in the info...and it's sloooooooow. And the result...like Periodrevival said...we went the whole day without knowing the result..eating dinners with our families...just to come home and see you post it with the torrent....damn, that was nasty done. "
,red_devl5,2010-09-19T20:56Z,"where the fuck are the seeders if you dont know how to upload then please stay away next time...
I have been waiting for hours for this game and this fucking ass came up after such a long time..."
,fransbos16,2010-09-19T21:08Z,"What the fuck !
The guy does great work and you guys only can talk about the result? 
Give him credits!
And United won, that's the most importent ! ;-)"
,quasi13,2010-09-20T00:12Z,"Wow, thanks for ruining this by posting the result.  Not only that, your title wasn't informative; it doesn't indicate whether it's a match or some other program.  Normally I wouldn't have looked at the details, but I wanted to see if this was indeed today's match.

While it is nice that are willing to take your time to post this, posting the result is just thoughtless."
,joeflo,2010-09-20T01:51Z,Please seed
,blunderbuss12222,2010-09-20T04:34Z,"Take it easy for f**ks sake. I've been waiting all day for someone to upload this and finally Koukos4 steps up and does it. So he put the score on, it sucks but without him you dont see the game. Cheers Koukos4 mate. I appreciate it and granted the score in the post kinda blows  but i think ppl here should show some respect and atleast put it in a nicer way. I'm sure he'd get the message whether your a wanker like mister15 or a nicer wanker like myself.  "
,quasi13,2010-09-20T06:10Z,"Commentators do not speak English!  That would have been another great bit of info to include...

Also, the quality is poor."
,quasi13,2010-09-20T06:12Z,"I'm going to give this one a shot instead:

,pandafaust,2010-09-20T13:03Z,"Its some fuckin russian commentary, its really annoying (unless your russian)."
,icony1,2010-09-20T20:57Z,"Thanks for torrent, Koukos4!!
Mister15, do you think there is anyone who dont know the result of this historical match? :))"
,mister15,2010-09-20T22:29Z,"Icony1...well I did my fekkin best, leaving the phone at home when going to my mothers birthday party...setting my decoder to record, only to find out the fekkin harddrive on the decoder malfunctioned when I came home..anyways...waiting for someone to upload the game, I avoided all newspapers and the internet...until...koukos4 uploaded the game...WITH THE SCORE in the description....NOOOOO...fekkin hell. Anyways..downloading the game..takes a looong time...then find out, it's shitty quality with foreign commentators...jeeeezus...when does the torture stop...suddenly...quasi13 steps up...being a FEKKIN HERO, posting the Sky sports version in HD, with pre and after show commentary. Finally get to see the game a whole day afterwards...knowing the result..but not knowing WHEN the goals came...god damn it...what a thriller...too bad koukos4 had to put the score in there.... :-(

Anyways KUDOS to quasi13, you are the fekking man!!!! :-))) Koukos...please don't post results, and please tell us it's NOT english...this is an english speaking site...but thanks for at least trying...can't ask for more than that."
