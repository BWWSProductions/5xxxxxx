100 Winning Resumes for Top Jobs.

This book is ...
... Dedicated to everyone who has struggled with resume writing and job search. Here are
practical tools, techniques, styles, formats and language that WILL accelerate your search.
... Dedicated to the thousands of executives with whom I have worked to plan and direct
their job search campaigns. Thank you for all you have taught me - about different
industries, technologies, markets, management disciplines and more.
... Dedicated to all of my clients who have said â€œThanks. You got me a job!â€ I appreciate
this, but canâ€™t take the credit. A resume has one purpose and only one purpose - to get
an interview. Thanks for the thanks, but it was you and only you who got the job.
Congratulations!
. . . Dedicated to Rebecca Stokes without whose untiring efforts and editorial assistance this
book would not have been possible.
And a special thank you to my husband and my son who have given so freely for years and
years, allowing me the time to devote to my business, my clients and my writing. You guys
are great!
