The Strokes are an American rock band formed in 1998 in New York City.
They rose to fame in the  early  2000s  as leaders in the garage  rock
revival. The band's members are Julian Casablancas (lead vocals), Nick
Valensi (guitar), Albert Hammond, Jr. (guitar), Nikolai Fraiture (bass
guitar) and Fabrizio Moretti (drums and percussion).

Upon the  release of their debut album  Is This It  in 2001, the group
was met with much critical acclaim. NME made Is This It their Album of
the Decade.  Since then, the  band  has  maintained  a large fan base,
mostly in the  UK,  US,  Canada  and  Australia. They have  been on an
unofficial hiatus since  First Impressions of Earth  in 2006. A number
of members have  embarked  on a  variety  of side projects, although a
fourth album is in preparation for release in early 2011.

This is the third album of American rock band, The Strokes. First
Impressions Of Earth marked a bit of a departure and maturation of the
band's sound, far more expansive and experimental than their previous
efforts. It's an excellent album, in my opinion.

This is a personally made rip, bit-for-bit and accomplished with the
use of EAC. The logs are included, as is the cue sheet.

Comments and feedback welcome.

Enjoy the music. Seeding is sharing. ~Igneous_X4
