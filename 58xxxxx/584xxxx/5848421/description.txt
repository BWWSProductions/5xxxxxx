                    Defence.                                 
                    Drama series. When three people are violently  
                    murdered and a fourth left for dead in a  
                    central London shop, DS Ronnie Brooks and DS  
                    Matt Devlin are up against the clock as they  
                    try to find the culprit, who they fear could  
                    strike again at any time. Their search is  
                    helped by information about the unusual murder  
                    weapon - a bayonet. When the investigation  
                    comes to court, senior crown prosecutor James  
                    Steel thinks he has a fairly open and shut  
                    case. But things take an unexpected turn when  
                    he discovers that the defendant has acquired  
                    some brilliant legal support.
