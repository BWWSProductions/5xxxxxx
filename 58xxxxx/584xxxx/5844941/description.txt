Markets! Finance! Scandal! Bad Equilibrium!

Max and Stacy look at the scandals of Greenspanâ€™s â€˜gold warning;â€™ currency wars breaking out; the Veterans Administrationâ€™s verbal dealers with insurance brokers raking it in on dead soldiers and Carla Bruniâ€™s hopes for raking it in after her husbandâ€™s (hopefully) one term. 

In the second half of the show, Max goes to New York to talk to Yves Smith of NakedCapitalism.com  about her book, Econned, and about stability and instability in financial markets, structural imbalances,â€™bad equilibrium,â€™ trillions in derivatives and Che Guevara with machine gun interfering with Potemkin companies.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
