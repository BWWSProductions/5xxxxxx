,theMango,2010-09-24T20:31Z,how do i completely uninstall this (remove all related files)? it took 4gb to install and it only gave me back 1gb after uninstall. i find that this happens to me for photoshop and flash
[V],thethingy,2010-09-24T21:01Z,"theMango, the folder that's extracted can be deleted after install (2gb)"
,theMango,2010-09-24T22:53Z,"thethingy, its 4gb just for the software, so deleting the extracted folder wouldn't count. and i've already deleted it anyways. 

should i just reinstall it and then use the adobe cs5 clean tool to remove it?"
[V],thethingy,2010-09-25T08:30Z,"theMango, its not 4gb more like 2, just uninstall it if you want with add/remove programs"

[V],thethingy,2010-11-12T13:48Z,"techjayd, you need to setup your hosts file first then put in a serial either during install or by installing as a trial then putting in a serial,, if after doing that and you still have issues then just copy the dll file and paste and replace your own ones. "

Thanks for this, so far it is working a treat on my comp. However I coppied the files over to another comp, follwed the same steps but when I tried to run it I got the 30 day trial up. I tried bothe serial numbers but it would not accept either. Did a complete uninstall replaced the host file with the original and started again but no joy. I have located the .dll files on this comp but there is no amtlib.dll file. I could not copy your .dll file as it would not allow me to paste it in. There is however 2 atmlib.dll files. A 32bit and a 64 bit. Are they the ones you are talking about. If so should i replace bothe of them with the ones' in your dll folder, or just the 64bit? It is a 64bit O.S on this comp.

,K-Lisa-2,2011-04-22T16:02Z,"Dear thethingy,

Thank you for providing this stuff. I downloaded one of your other Adobe progs and it all worked perfectly. I'm just about to follow your instructions with Photoshop Elements 9 but notice that the contents of the Host file, here in Element 9, is different from the contents of the other Host file. 

So my question if you can help please, is.... What to put into the Host file if they are different for each prog?   For example, if I now insert your recommended Host file for elements 9, what then happens to the previous prog I had from you?  Will it still work - I can't see that it will still work?  It's not possible to have two Host files is it, so I'm wondering why they are different, for different programs?  Could you tell me the way around this please, or, do I simply add the contents of the newest Host file, from Elements 9, to my older Host file, if so, does it go at the bottom, and I leave the earlier stuff as-is?  Could you clarify the situation please, with regard to what to do with different Host files. Could you write your explanation in a noddy way for me. Thank you.

p.s.  I'm a newbie, how do I do this Seeding thing?

Kind Regards,"

The install seems to progress fine until it reaches the point where it tries to install ""Required Shared Technologies"", then it stops. It rolls back the install, removes everything and I have to start over. 

I've gone over all the steps prior to install in the instructions many times, I've tried doing the install both with and without the internet, I tried running setup as an administrator and I've tried installing the Trial version first, always with the same result.
