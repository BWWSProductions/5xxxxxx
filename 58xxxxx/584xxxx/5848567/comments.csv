Keep up the FASM releases!"
,herniator,2011-02-17T09:36Z,Holy crap... 3.35GB at this quality! Methinks bluray was invented just to sell sony hardware when they could easily have used DVDs (up to 9GB dual layer could fit ANY movie).

just too bad the audio is encoded at 32Khz!! why safe a few megabytes for that audio setting?? not even HD, AAC-LC 5.1 48khz should be great.. Thanks anyway.."
