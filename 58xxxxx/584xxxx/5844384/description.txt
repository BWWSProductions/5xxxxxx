- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   Tera Melos' first proper full-length, Patagonian Rats is packed with melodic
   hooks and jabs that on paper might seem to defy the band's experimental edge.
   There's even clear and distinct vocals throughout -- a first for the band,
   where vocals, if any, were previously awash with distortion and layered in
   the mix. But, particulars aside, Patagonian Rats is the type of album that
   sticks with you.
