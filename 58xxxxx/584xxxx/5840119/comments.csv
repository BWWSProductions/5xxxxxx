,lordkv,2010-09-24T02:51Z,Video is ok. The audio is @ 32000 Hz. Thats bad encoding. No point in wasting bandwidth.
[T],fachman,2010-09-29T16:36Z,lordkv: I believe you need to learn a lot about encoding then you can say what is right or wrong encode...
,lordkv,2010-09-30T08:00Z,"fachman, Needless to say I wont be identifying myself but I have been encoding movies since 10+ years (350 odd movies including blurays) and I can certainly tell you one thing, when someone says you are doing something wrong, they wont unless they are sure or have doubts about. Please check all your rips. All are at 32000 Hz instead of the 48000 Hz @ which the Bluray audio is at. Why would you want to down sample is beyond me and then go on to substantiate the same?"
