Letting Go is Philip Roth's first full-length novel, published just after Goodbye,
 Columbus, when he was twenty-nine. Set in 1950s Chicago, New York, and Iowa City, 
Letting Go presents as brilliant a fictional portrait as we have of a mid-century 
America defined by social and ethical constraints and by moral compulsions 
conspicuously different from those of today. Newly discharged from the Korean War 
army, reeling from his mother's recent death, freed from old attachments and 
hungrily seeking others, Gabe Wallach is drawn to Paul Herz, a fellow graduate 
student in literature, and to Libby, Paul's moody, intense wife. Gabe's desire to 
be connected to the ordered "world of feeling" that he finds in books is first 
tested vicariously by the anarchy of the Herzesâ€™ struggles with responsible 
adulthood and then by his own eager love affairs. Driven by the desire to live 
seriously and act generously, Gabe meets an impassable test in the person of 
Martha Reganhart, a spirited, outspoken, divorced mother of two, a formidable 
woman who, according to critic James Atlas, is masterfully portrayed with "depth 
and resonance." The complex liaison between Gabe and Martha and Gabe's moral 
enthusiasm for the trials of others are at the heart of this ambitious first 
novel. "[Roth] has the finest eye for the details of American life since Sinclair 
Lewis."
