,Theguvman,2011-03-05T10:34Z,Multi graci for the awesome upload! I'm having trouble downloading it though. Any ideas why?
,darkfrost,2012-01-16T04:35Z,"Can't believe people have even the slightest complaint about this awesome and very FREE upload. Especially at 320! Who cares what category it's in, can't you read? It says 320 right in the header! You can always go and buy this collection if you have an extra $1000 bucks in your wallet! Quit bitching and thank this guy!! 

Last but not least, THANK YOU FOR THIS BAD ASS COLLECTION!"
