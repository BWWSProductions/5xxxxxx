One Day Remains is the debut studio album by the American rock band Alter Bridge, released on August 10, 2004 through Wind-up Records. The album was produced by Ben Grosse[5] and has been certified Gold in the United States, with sales worldwide reaching 750,000.

It is said the album received its name from the band members' attitudes that life should be lived as if only one day remains. Guitarist Mark Tremonti also said in an interview that the title is a reference to the title cards that appeared in the movie Donnie Darko, and is also one of the names the band considered using before settling with Alter Bridge
