Thanks for your feedback. Really. I have to hand it to you, sonews, lonefunman and others. I just wanted to help and I'm finding out, it does take a bit of an effort to do this daily. I'll be honest, Its bit of a drag....I leave my pc recording all day while I'm at work. so it ""really"" means a lot to get an acknowledgment."
,lonefunman,2010-09-22T11:00Z,"Thanks for this! My Replay A/V just stopped working one day last week and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to listen any longer unless I was catching it live.  Thank you for the nod, too.  I had to retire from posting after so many internet connection issues and the occasional Captcha crash."

Glad to hear from you. ReplayAV is able to record Randi? I was under the impression they stopped allowing certain shows particularly Randi & Thom from being recorded few months ago. I tried Replayav, but could not get it to record let alone schedule these shows. Others were having the same issue according to there boards. Were you able to get it to schedule the recordings. And did it require your soundcard or was it able to record directly? To clarify, were you able to listen to other audio while it recorded?"
,lonefunman,2010-09-24T20:07Z,"i was/am able to record the show as it happens by recording ""what my speakers are playing"" from the websites that stream randi rhodes using Replay A/V. i used to be able to set it up where it would record it in the background but for some reason in the last few weeks that stopped being the case, although other scheduled recordings still happen without me attending them."
