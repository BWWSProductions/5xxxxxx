It seems that the rich really enjoy their fine whines. At yesterdayâ€™s town hall meeting, a Wall Street hedge fund manager told President Obama about the suffering his people undergo. He said â€œI represent the Wall Street community. We have felt like a piÃ±ata.â€  I know he was trying to be self-pitying, but the piÃ±ata analogy is actually illustrative in a number of ways. Wall Street types ARE like a piÃ±ata. Theyâ€™re stuffed full of sweets while the rest of us are hungry. And the similarities donâ€™t stop there. Theyâ€™re suspended high above the rest of us. And now it looks like their plan is to have themselves hauled up even higher so theyâ€™re completely out of the reach of all of us blindfolded little children down below. Wall Street is also like a piÃ±ata in the sense that all of the goodies are sealed up in this artificial construction where they canâ€™t do anybody any good. And now Wall Street wants to take all the rest of the candy and seal that up in piÃ±atas too, so they can sit on it to ride their way through this recession.

PiÃ±atas are made to be opened up eventually, you jerks! Thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re at the party in the first place. If this hedge fund moron was putting together a childâ€™s birthday party, heâ€™d have the piÃ±ata out of reach for the kiddies the entire time. And what would you have then? A full piÃ±ata and a bunch of crying children. Happy Birthday! OK, at this point, the analogy breaks down, because now itâ€™s the people who have the piÃ±ata all sealed up for themselves who are whining and crying. Half of the little kids who canâ€™t get at the piÃ±ata donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s going on. Theyâ€™re just walking around blindfolded by entities like Fox News and FreedomWorks, swinging their sticks in whatever direction theyâ€™re told to.

The hedge fund guy had gone to law school with Barack Obama. Now heâ€™s a hedge fund manager, and Obama is President of the United States. Thank God that President Obama told this moron that if heâ€™s making a billion dollars a year while so many people are out of work, maybe he shouldnâ€™t feel so put upon. This manâ€™s secretary pays higher taxes than he does. And he probably had her write up the questions he wanted to whack Obama with at this town meetingâ€”the questions about how poor hedge fund managers are always getting beat up on. Enjoy the whine. Thereâ€™s more where that came from
