 good, if not great, debut record. Mason clearly has considerable songwriting talent, but it is spread a little too thin over the course of the whole album. The stand out track is 'Oxygen', a simple but stunning song, reminiscent of John Lennon's 'Imagine' as both an optimistic manifesto for the future and a call-to-arms to the current generation. But for every 'Oxygen' there is a 'Letter #1' or 'Our Town', songs which miss the mark. Overall, I would say this album is worth investigating, just don't expect consistently great songs. I just hope Mason's potential is fulfilled in the future.
