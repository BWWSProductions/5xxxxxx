This is the PAL version of the film running at 25 frames per second. Thats why it is only 102 minutes instead of 107. there is no cut dvd version.

maybe you should stop watching movies through 20 dollar speakers. 

movie sucked imo, wasnt even cool for special effects, i found it funny that this film was produced by the same studio as machete and they put several of the same actors. 
machete was better though. "

,dlarrym1111,2010-09-27T05:12Z,"Sound is ""tinny"" ( also sounds like during the re-encoding from the normal DVD size speaking of a retail copy is about 5 to 6 Gb's. Almost all store bought DVD's are made on DUAL LAYER disksr. This allows more then enough memory to place an uncompressed movie. ANYWAY, The AUdio was overly high pitched and zero bass. The video how ever approaches DVD quality ALMOST. I'll call this one at one a  (9)

(10 being one cannot tell any difference from the download and a store bought DVD). 

SOUND, I'll say is a (4). 

It is watchable. thanks SpiritPirate, nothing against you, sometimes things are the way they are and nothing can done about it. MAJOR thanks for the upload. It is watchable and I liked the story with only 2 minor errors, (in my opinion."

Anyone saying this is A: 9 or 10 must be deaf. It's not full of annoying stuff like candy wrappers or coughing, but it is very plain that it is no where, not even close, to dvd sound. Sounds tinny, the range of the sound is limited, lots of treble, little bass."

Those of you bitching about the audio need to realize you are a pirate, and pirates don't have any room to bitch. Perfect quality, audio is fine and the video is great as well. The movie is fucking awesome, great action flick with suspense throughout the entire movie. Main character has a fucked up nose, but other then that, this is worth the download.
