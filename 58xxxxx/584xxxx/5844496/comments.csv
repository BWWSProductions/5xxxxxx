Haven't isntalled yet, will have do this at home. But once installed will tell you people how the game is, how hard to install and so on. Generaly Razor makes good cracks and games so i don't see a problem at the moment.

Anyway thanks to Razor for the game, and thanks Extremezone for the fast upload, much apreciated, been waiting for this release for absoulte time!

,williehmmm,2010-09-23T06:11Z,"Luuke - the engineer's dialect is Geordie, (from Newcastle, england).

I heard them call him Rocky which I think is the real name of an F1 mechanic/engineer.  Although I think they've tried to make him sound a lot like Rob Smedley, Felipe Massa's engineer, he who said "" A l o n s o    i s    f a s t e r    t h a n      y o u , do you understand the message, Sorry"".

I can report back that this works perfectly and although there is a steep learining curve (with assists off) it's bloody rewarding when you start to get it right.

And with Nvidia 3D vision, in the rain, cockpit view....  I've never seen graphics so good ever.  They have done a stunning job with the visuals.

The cars are hard to drive, but I think that's because F1 cars are hard to drive.  

That'd be an accurate simulation then.

I will probably be buying this for the online play, shame it's steam only just now.  I'll hang on and see if a non steam version surfaces and in the meantime I'll practice like a bugger."

I've had the game crash 3 times in 2 days, Grid did similar things, so I'm just assuming it's bug in the code that will get fixed with a patch.

Fakemito - have you got  ""Games for Windows Live"" installed already?  What is the CPU & graphics card you have?

As for the claims this only works in trial.  This is not true.  Game works fully.  Some individuals seem to have a specific problem, but for most this is working perfectly.

,aeRo77,2010-09-23T15:59Z,"[!] Hamachi Server: F12010 Password: 123

[x] First follow these steps

1. You open CMD:

For WinXP, it's: Run -> type cmd
For Win7/Vista it's: Search -> type cmd -> click on cmd.exe

2. Then you type ""regedit"". Press enter when your done. We're going to edit the registry.

3. Once you've hit Enter, a Pop-up will appear. Grant it access. (if it's Vista/Win7)

4. Then do the following:

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
HKEY_CURRENT_USER
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
HKEY_USERS
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG

HKEY_CURRENT_USER -> Software -> Classes -> Microsoft -> Xlive

6. You'll see a few Binairy files, that differ from pc to pc.

You have to make a new one. Simply right click on the window where the files are, then:

New -> String Value -> (Name it) ConnectionOverride

For the Dutch people:

Nieuw -> Tekenreekswaarde -> (Noem het) ConnectionOverride

7. Edit this file. Right-Click on the new binairy you just created, and edit or aanpassen (NL)
Then type ""Hamachi"".

8. Start a GFWL-Based game, and sign in.
Click on ""Home"" (default key for opening the main GFWL Menu), then:

Personal settings -> Network Information

Check if your Network Adapter says: Hamachi

Join Hamachi channel then go to Multiplayer -> Lan -> Find Session"
,williehmmm,2010-09-23T16:02Z,"Fakemito & klicko94 - Your problem is you both have a single core processor, and this is not powerful enough to run this game.  Time to upgrade guys.  

System requirements

    * Windows XP/Vista/7
    * DirectX 9.0c
    * Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.4GHz or Athlon X2
    * 1GB RAM (2GB for Vista)
    * Graphics Card: GeForce 7800 / Radeon X1800 or above
    * DirectX Compatible Sound Card or motherboard audio
    * Dual Layer Compatible DVD-ROM Drive
    * 12.5 GB Hard Drive Space


The sweet spot for price/performance is a triple core Athlon II or Phenom II.  This also means a new motherboard (socket AM2+/AM3), if you have DDR2 Ram you should be able to still use this, although some boards have DDR3.  Good luck guys."
,klicko94,2010-09-23T16:04Z,i was waiting this game so long and now my single core processor is fault....omg

,klicko94,2010-09-23T16:09Z,that would be the problem ....but i've played games with better graphics which require better perfomance than this game like ac2 ...mw2 ...crysis

,williehmmm,2010-09-23T16:34Z,"Klicko - on Grid I have all settings on ultra, 16AA and my FPS max out at 120, the 120 limit of my 120Hz monitor.  In F1 2010, I am hitting 80FPS with only x4AA, this is much more demanding on the graphics card.

I have run Grid, MW2 & Crysis on a single core CPU with an ATI x1650, but only on lowest detail.  These games are meant to be run on dual, triple or quad core CPU with good graphics cards.

Crysis is very badly prgrammed, and CPU twice as fast only give 10% increase in FPS, switching to Sli or Crossfire gives 80 - 90% performance increase in most other games, in crysis it gives 5% increase.  Also GTA 4, 60 - 70 FPS average, even with hexa core CPU and quad GTX 480, exact same performance as athlon II x3 and GTX 460, despite $3,000 dollars more hardware.  The game is either Frame limited or it will not use the extra horsepower available.

F1 2010 does use the extra horsepower.  And the visuals, expecially in the rain are better than anything I've seen in any game ever.  Add 3D vision and it is jaw droppingly beautiful.

Single core cannot deliver the performance required to render these visuals.  Your 4730 will be sitting idle most of the time waiting for your CPU to catch up."
,williehmmm,2010-09-23T16:38Z,"Kilcko - are you sure you have single core Pentium 4 - 2.66Ghz (pentium IV)?

Can it not be a dual core, core 2 duo Pentium?  these can also run at 2.66, and with you 4730 should run maximum details on most games.  With single core 2.66, if you are maxing out details then your PC is possessed by the devil.  Your processor should be a bottleneck which only lowered details will give fluid gameplay."
,fakemito,2010-09-23T16:43Z,this game can run on a single core cpu.

,williehmmm,2010-09-23T17:25Z,"Fakemito = Troll.

Or if he's right, Codemasters are lying about the minimum required spec. 

Why would they do that Fakemito?  Why would they tell people with single core CPU that this game cannot run on their PC, and lose all those extra sales, when as you tell us it can run on single core CPU?  except not yours, so there must be another reason it isn't running for you, and it's just pure coincidence that it doesn't work on your single core PC."
,williehmmm,2010-09-23T17:38Z,"You can buy dual core CPUs for less than Â£40/$60, there really is no reason to not have the minimum spec, unless you are very poor, in which case, stop playing games and go get a job.  The minimum CPU needed to play this would cost about the same as the game itself, and you are getting it for free.

For a games company to write a game that can max out a hexa core (x6) Â£900/$1,350 cpu with incredible visuals and still be able run on a single core CPU that has only 16% of that performance, and for it still to be playable, that's asking a lot.  We are almost into 2011.  Trying to play the latest games with 2005 hardware isn't going to work on these most demanding titles, sorry.

It's time to upgrade or you need to accept that you can't play this game.

My first PC was a 486 DX 66Mhz, 4MB of ram, 100MB hard drive and it cost me Â£500/$750 in 1995 money.  It can't play this game either and that was an expensive PC goddamit!"
,williehmmm,2010-09-23T17:44Z,"Crack is in a folder on the ISO/Disc called Razor1911.

There are 2 files you need to coppy over to the games installation folder, usually program files (x86)/codemasters/F1 2010.  These files are:

f1_2010
1911.dll

When you copy these files over it will ask you if you want to replace an existing file, you must say 'YES'.

,fakemito,2010-09-23T18:52Z,"i submited a ticket to codemasters, and they said that i can run this game with a single core cpu, but don't know how to fix the error yet."
,williehmmm,2010-09-23T19:14Z,"Okay Fakemito, if codemasters say that you can run this game, but the game doesn't run on single core processors (yet?), then you still can't run this game.

So,  to anyone else who has a single core processor, don't download this game (yet?) because it will not run unless you submit a ticket to codemasters who will tell you it can run but they don't know how to fix the error yet.  I hope that's clear.

Minimum system requirements are below.  If you meet these and still have a problem, I will try to help if I can.  Anyone else, please submit a ticket to codemasters!

System requirements

* Windows XP/Vista/7
* DirectX 9.0c

,williehmmm,2010-09-23T21:52Z,"Klicko - if your motherboard has an intel socket 775 cpu socket, your upgrade may be very easy and cheap.  You clearly have a pci express board which your 4730 sits in, this will likely mean you have DDR2 Ram, 2GB is ideal.

If you can find out the make and model of your motherboard, check the website and it should list the CPUs supported (perhaps with a bios update).  I had an older board and was able to pop in a Core 2 duo e8400.  One of the faster dual cores socket 775 CPUs you can buy.

But even a mid range dual core (2.6 -3.0) will increase your performance by 100% -ish.  Quad cores are available on ebay for reasonable prices too if your board supports them.  Fitting is straighforward and this game will use every bit of performance you add.

Good luck mate."

Don't do the same thing I did, I competed in two grand prix in my career not knowing I was not able to save if I didn't make a Game For Windows Live account. You must do this BEFORE you start a new career! The game is cracked so you of course only do a offline profile. There's a blue link in the procedure which says something with ""Create a local profile"" or something like that - do that."
,williehmmm,2010-09-24T02:28Z,"ghnogueira -  i had a similar problem in Grid (roughly the same graphics engine).  Screen would freeze for a second then fine, then after 5 seconds it would freeze, then fine again.

I cured this by using an older driver. 

As I updated drivers the issue would not return until again another driver release would give me the regualr stutters in the game.  Roll back to previous driver and it would be fine again.

I'm on Nvidia for my main PC and the current Beta driver has repeated this issue for me on Grid.  But it's fine in F1 2010.  I've had this issue on ATI cards too, my previous card was a 4850x2.

Try an older driver and let us know if you have any success."

,williehmmm,2010-09-25T01:24Z,"idmick - your video card is at the lower performance end, but I think it should run with it, although you will need to switch to ultra low detail settings.

Make sure you have the latest driver from the nvidia website, currently 258.96 for your card and OS.

Try that and see if it helps.  The rest of your PC is medium to high spec, the GPU is a serious bottleneck though.  If you can find an ATI 4850/4870/4890 on ebay or get a new 5770 or GTX 460, you should be running this smoothly with high details.  If you can get the 8600 GTS to work, it will be low or ultra low I'm afraid.

,williehmmm,2010-09-25T18:16Z,"TheBigHase - Graphics corruption and purple or green streaks on screen is a sign that a compnent on your graphics card has failed.  No one else has had this so I'd guess it's just a coincidence.  Software can't break hardware.  Just bad luck unfortunately but it would have happened anyway, even if you hadn't tried this game.  The card was the fastest available in its time, if you bought it recently it will still be under warranty, if not, then you just have to accept you've had your moneys worth.  

There are many faster graphics cards in the mid-price range just now, if you want to stay with Nvidia, the GTX 460 is almost 70% faster than your 8800GTX, or for maybe slighlty better value ATI 5770, or if you want higher end, GTX470 or 5850 would more than double your previous performance, assuming you have a good dual or quad core CPU."
,williehmmm,2010-09-25T18:23Z,"ArmandP - Not sure what your issue is then.  I have installed this on a lower spec PC than yours, Intel 2160 dual core 1.8Ghz Oc'd to 2.2Ghz, 2GB DDR2 667, ATI 4670, I needed to turn down to low detail settings to get it to run smoothly but it did run.

Sorry mate.  "
,KlausW33d,2010-09-25T19:00Z,"@williehmmm:
just take a look at the official forums and see how many people are having problems.. and take into account that not everyone is reporting the problem but just following the threads looking for a solution.
How can you be so sure that it is a problem with single cores anyway ?
Half of the ppl reporting this issue have dualcore or better.
And in fact there are a lot of modern games with dualcore requirement but they all run on single core nonetheless, so don't you think that would be kind of.. bad ?"
,YouCantKillMe_FU,2010-09-25T19:55Z,"Wont load, just comes up with an X with no error code and the weird Razor introduction. Running windows 7. Anybody know how to solve this?"
,williehmmm,2010-09-25T20:19Z,"KlausW33d - just had a look at codemasters forum, most people with the game won't start problem are single core.  1 guy had his bios set to be single core (why?), swithed that to multiple core and he got it working.

If you are single core this will not work.  If you are dual or quad core and you have a problem, check in control panel/system/hardware/device manager/processors.  if you have 2 cores there will be processors listed, if you have quad there will be 4.  If you think it should be dual or quad but only 1 is showing, check your bios to see that all cores are used.

If you have a single core and it works for you, tell everyone else how.  Isuspect no one with single core is able to get it to work, and even if they did it would be unplayable.

For guys who have dual or quad core and it still doesn't work, sorry, not sure what your issue is.  Good luck with fixing it."

,Mr-Tom,2010-09-25T22:06Z,"Alright here are my specs:
Intel Core 2 Duo CPU @ 2.53ghz
4GB of Ram
Geforce 9700M GT
running on vista 64 bit

I've had no problems whatsoever to download and install the game. I have the local profile all set. 
However the game is lagging in sequences.
I havent raced yet but in the menu and stuff it goes like this ; 10-15 seconds of lag then goes back to normal for around 10-15 seconds also.

This is happening in both very low and very high settings. What would be the cause of this?"
,ejuoi1,2010-09-25T22:10Z,PEOPLE! GaME WORKS FINE! Just follow directions. Windows 7 32 dual core. Game is pretty good too but I don't like how you have to follow a story. It took me 10 hours to down load though because of selifsh muthrfuckers who didn't seed so I'm not going to either. 
,SorkUnt,2010-09-25T23:37Z,"sorry for being plow, but how do i tell if i have single core. im having the problem with the red X in error box with no message, thx men"
,williehmmm,2010-09-26T03:04Z,"TheBigHase - Very difficult when hardware fails, I have had Graphics cards fail too, often just when warranty has ended, not good.  But prices have come donw a lot and performance keeps increasing so it is a good time to upgrade.  According to this chart, the 285 is a 100% increase on your GTX 8800.

http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gts-450-radeon-hd-4850-gpu,2732-7.html

Compare the price against new GTX460/GTX470 or ATI5770/5850.  If the price is similar, then it is better to get the new card with full warranty.  Good luck my friend, you will have a very good PC to play this game with any of those cards."
,williehmmm,2010-09-26T03:13Z,"Mr-Tom - with the exception of very high spec and very high cost laptops, most laptops will struggle to run this game.  the 9700M GT GPU is slower than most budget Â£35/$50 graphics cards in desktop PCs.  This means you will need to go to ultra low detail settings and a very low resolution to get acceptable frame rates.

because you say you have normal frame rates for 15 seconds, then slow for 15 seconds, this indicates it is not hardware that is the problem.  Make sure there are no programs are running in the background, run a full virus scan and malware/spyware scan in case there is something running that might be eating resources and causing your slow down.

Good luck."
,williehmmm,2010-09-26T03:17Z,"SorkUnt - go to control panel - system - hardware - device manager - processors.

If there is 1 processor listed it is a single core.

If there are 2 processors listed it is a single core with hyperthreading or a dual core.

3 processors then it's a triple core.

4 processors then it's a dual core with hyperthreading or a quad core.

8 processors then it's a quad core with hyperthreading.

12 processors then it's a hexa core with hyperthreading.

My guess is if you are having trouble launching the game then you have a single core and need to upgrade to play this game."
,unique223,2010-09-26T03:20Z,"@ejuoi1: You stupid selfish cunt. The torrent is slow because there are too many people trying to download it too soon after release. This always happens with big torrents, everyone tries to download it and most get low speeds.

And you're complaining that it took 10 hours for you? I'm on my 37th hour when it should have taken 12.

AND OTHER PEOPLE NOT SEEDING IS NO EXCUSE TO NOT SEED!"
,Mr-Tom,2010-09-26T04:48Z,"Thanks for your time and help Williehmmm.

Make sure there are no programs are running in the background, run a full virus scan and malware/spyware scan in case there is something running that might be eating resources and causing your slow down.''


But if something is slowing me down, I should experience it with other games aswell no? 

Its odd, because I'm running games like Mass Effect 2 and Assassin's creed 2 just fine. I've never had this type of lag before.
And when you think about it, if it was because of my GPU,  I wouldn't even be able to start a race at 1600X1200 resolution with perfectly smooth frame fates. 
Whereas now when I tried very high settings, I'm able to naviguate through the menu and start a race without any problem. Then about 45 seconds in the first lap, the game starts lagging alot then around 15secs later it goes back to normal and so on.

,nukelfish,2010-10-06T01:09Z,"@Th3_Raging_Bull 

ONLINE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. google teknogods and download it (17 beta is the lates version), put it all in a folder and on the desktop for example (not in the game directory as the game). most anti virus softwares see teknogods.dll as virus so put it into exceptions, its not a virus). 
2. download and install tunngle. join the f1 2010 network. 
3. start teknohelper.exe, click on automatic mode client and launch the game. 
4. go multiplayer, lan, look for sessions

NOTE: 
1. before joining the lobby hold f12 until you hear a woman say ""working"", then you can join the lobby
2 Dont forget to press f12 again after you joined the lobby till you hear sound ""transmission complete"" and you are ready to play.

works with hamachi too"

This is a driving game and the subtle and precise control that only a steering wheel can give and the spot on physics of this game, not to mention the fantastic graphics without weather effects and the absolutely stunningly orgasmically beautiful graphics when the weather effects are in full force, makes this absolutely one of the best driving games ever made.

Don't know about the issues your PC is having, but it's running fine for everyone else that has a dual core PC and a decent video card.  The cutscenes play once when you start a career, after that it's all racing.

Go do a race in heavy rain at Spa and come back and tell us the graphics are mediocre.  It's like being there, the spray, the raindrops on the car, the reflections on the track, the rain drops on your visor.  It's just fan-fucking-tastic!

That's a nice sentiment and it says all we need to know about you and your opinions.  remember you're on a site called ""The pirate Bay"" making that comment, I don't think you're going to find much sympathy or support for your views.

I've downloaded a pirate copy to play the game as soon as possible.  I think the game is fantastic and I want to play it online so I will be buying it as soon as my local store has copies in stock.  Until then I'll hone my skills, learn the full 19 tracks as best I can and master the car handling so I can really attack the tracks and compete once I get online with it.

You my friend are a fanny and quite frankly an idiot, because you can't even count up to 19 (did you try taking off your shoes and socks?)."
,Ic4ruz,2010-10-11T03:10Z,"williemmm: Your'e a idiot and an asshole. If it's so fantastic then buy it. And what is going to happen to single-player only games if you just buy it for the mutliplayer ?

Driving against real people online, unpredictable, aggressive, sometimes downright stupid and sometimes real classy drivers and total gentlemen/lady racers.  I downloaded this to see if it was good and worth buying, it is and i will.  I have to buy it to be able to play it online and prove what I believe deep down, that i am the most naturally gifted driver the world has ever known.

To set it up you must go out of the trailer to 'my F1', then 'driving options' (I think), change controller from your gamepad to custom, then choose accelerate, select your button, same with brake, steering etc.

That should be you.  I've set it up with various generic wheels and all have had to be set to custom to let me choose the controls I want rather than the default set.

As for helping people, yup, I'm that kind of guy.  Those who can get the game working and who get good at it will want to test themselves against a field of real drivers.  They will only be able to do that by buying the game.  The way I see it, I've helped a few folk who might end up paying for this.  For those who don't buy it, then they've got a decent single player game and no one's been hurt.

When codemasters brought out Race Driver 3, they had a demo which worked online.  It was fantastic and I bought that too, same with Grid.  There was no demo for this, so this download became the demo for me.

There have been 50 other driving games I've downloaded and they've been shit, and I would have felt cheated if I'd paid money for them, very few got more than an hours play, Â£30 for an hour is pretty steep.  With Codemasters games, I'm happy to hand over the cash.  This got downloaded because it was out a few days before I could buy it and I wanted to make sure the standard of the game was as high as I'd come to expect from Codies, and it was, so I bought it.  Me buying it doesn't exclude me from helping other folk try it out.

Now about this hat you're going to eat.  Do the decent thing, pop it on youtube so we can all have good laugh!

Arse!"

If you're disappointed with the release, just shut up and go buy the game. You're getting this for free, so take what you've got or just get lost.

Any all GFWL cracked games need profiles still. The only exception I can think of is Fallout 3.
And how does having the Razor logo pop up make it a shitty release?

People today are so fucking picky."

This version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see wether you need an x86 (32bit) or x64 (64 bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher.

to install you can't use the autorun ""Setup.exe"" program, you have to run ""Game.msi"".

when you try to run the game, if you get an open AL error or are missing xlive.dll, open the disk image and go to the folder â€œRedistâ€œ and install OpenAL and GFWL (games for windows live).

once you're in the game, to be able to save you have to create an offline windows live account. click â€œcreate accountâ€œ and scroll down, at the bottom of the text you will see a link to make an offline account."

,inferno26,2011-09-03T12:21Z,"How do I save progress in F1 2010 OFFLINE MODE ?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions in our troubleshooting articles. F1 2010 is a Games For Windows Live (GFWL) based title and you need access to a GFWL account in order to save game progress. But donâ€™t worry,  in case you donâ€™t have an online profile, you can still save the game using an offline account. Step by step instructions on how to do this is given below:

    Launch the game. Open the Windows Live menu (or it will open automatically, prompting you to log in or create a new account).
    If you are not logged into any GFWL profile continue to step 3. If you are already logged onto a profile (local or online), try launching the single player component and try to save progress. If saving and loading works fine, you obviously have no problem. If it does not work, youâ€™ll need to sign out of the current profile before continuing to step 3 (Create profile button will only become visible when you arenâ€™t logged in).
    Click on â€˜Create new profileâ€™ button.
    In the dialog box that pops up DO NOT hit continue. Hitting continue will take you to a registration page for an ONLINE profile â€“ this is not the requirement.
    Once in the â€˜Create Gamer Profileâ€™ window, scroll down so that you can see the bottom paragraph.
    Look for the hyperlinked â€˜created a local profileâ€™ link in last paragraph. Clicking this will allow you to create a new offline profile.

Note that an offline GFWL account will not let you play online. But you should be able to play single player mode without any issues whatsoever."
