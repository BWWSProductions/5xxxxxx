,zippin,2011-01-27T02:15Z,"VYCanisMajoris can u explain this comment,
it seems a perfectly good torrent,
downloading seperate seasons 
would cost me lots and lots more gigs and
time, though i like the appropriate subs,
this one just could do the job..."
,Cwmagain,2011-03-06T12:56Z,"The season I managed to download looked okay in quality, alas all the seeders then disappeared."
