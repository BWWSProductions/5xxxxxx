[V],manOtor,2010-09-24T00:21Z,FYI: season is not complete yet - there'll be a christmas stand alone episode on december 10th...
,saffordpc,2010-09-24T00:49Z,"standalone episodes usually are not counted to any particular season and i probably wont add it this torrent as it will be faster to just download the individual episode from eztv

p.s sorry about the speed coming and going router keeps locking up if it doesn't fix itself(normally it does) going to move it over to a friends laptop so it may be down for 30min or so later but that will def fix the speed issue"
,saffordpc,2010-09-24T01:32Z,"just to update i will be moving this over to my friends laptop so it should be back up in about an hour
will bring the avg upload from about 60 to over 300"
,saffordpc,2010-09-24T03:02Z,update: on new computer still only seeding from one going to try and get a second running later tonight. the speed and connection should be better if their is still any problems with connections after this let me know and ill do my best to resolve the issue
[V],manOtor,2010-10-15T02:23Z,"one can always include the standalone episode into the season 2 package ;)... - did not mean to spam anyway, was just being a smartass.
Thanks for the upload - GREAT series!"

,mizzllat,2011-08-01T07:36Z,"Thanks uploader, it is a decent torrent.

Should mention, though, that ""Secret Santa"" (S02E13) is not actually a stand-alone episode, but is officially listed as ""Episode 13"" on the production roster/calendar."
