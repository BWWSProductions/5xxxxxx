[T],fachman,2010-10-01T12:52Z,"Dear friend, please dont take this personal, as its not my intention to discourage you in any way, but i think you deserve some words of truth.
Just by reading your description I can say that you know very little of what you are doing.
First of all MKV is not the format, its the container.
Second of all why the hell did you used High@4.0 together with 3 ref frames. You are not aware how many problemms people have with wrong set levels.
Third of all with AAC audio the best choice is MP4, for compatibility reasons.

And at the end dont be angry on people who just want some basics information.
Go google for more information, learn something and then come back to us with some new stuff :)"
,vermonth,2010-10-02T18:04Z,where can i find subtitles for these... would be great help
,al589,2010-10-06T13:38Z,How is the quality? any screen shots?
,janat08,2010-10-23T13:03Z,Is it any good anyways?
,janat08,2010-10-24T21:36Z,"None of subtitles would work with this. I wouldn't say that quality is exceptional for movies' sizes (not at all). I'd say that audio is bad, or I can't understand accent of the people in movie."
,janat08,2010-10-24T22:32Z,"Well, actually after a session I thought that considering it's matroska, and DVDRip, the quality is below average, even for other formats."
,janat08,2010-10-25T11:32Z,"I just discovered that movies are over 3 hours long, so taking that in consideration quality is 6-7/10 for the size."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-22T02:16Z,"get PT's vids if you want good video.  this is not good.

What the Fuck is your Problem you fucking Ass Hole!
Who the fuck do you think you are to ACCUSE me of using other people's upload???
There's a reason this site is called thepiratebay...

BECAUSE WE'RE ALL PIRATES!

This is my upload and I Converted all the three movies myself into mkv. yes the A/V quality is a little bit compromised and thats what you get at small sizes.
If i did steal somebody's upload still that would only make me a better pirate than you ever will be you Scare_Fuck...

Look at you... Not even a Single Upload and judging people.

And why would i advertise my self in the first place, its not like i m getting money for this. Sharing is a good thing and thats what i m doing.
Maybe your mommy didn't teach you to be nice to people who share their stuff for free.

""scare_crow""... not even crows will get scared from your ""fuck_face"" maybe that's what your name should be from now on you fucking Retard!

Thankyou for Listening!!!"
