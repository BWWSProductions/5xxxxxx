[V],twentyforty,2010-09-24T08:24Z,"@punk67: I'll try to encode that R5 to see is it good or not. I am reluctant to repeat recent mistakes regarding really bad quality of newer R5 (excluding Salt). If you don't see my torrent, let say 12 hours from now, either R5 turned bad or I can't find free slot for the up."
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-24T09:26Z,"@punk67: I have seen your first message (earlier in Comments) and I appreciate helping hand.
I was ""overwhelmed"" by similar offerings in past three months, when my encodings which have been done on semi-dead computer were downloaded 540000 times - but only 12 people offered help. Of that dozen - three stayed on promise only, stayed mute and I made fool of myself. There is something worse than bagging - and I got that.
Ones that helped (nine people) knows me for years, back from mininova and have done best to their abilities.

What else to say, really, except that I left my e-mail address maybe two inches above your first offering and now address is some ten inches above your second offering. So, how I should react?"
