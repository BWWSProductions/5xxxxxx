Comments :
Birth of a legend. Following King Richard's death in France, archer Robin Longstride, along with 
Will Scarlett, Alan-a-Dale and Little John, returns to England. They encounter the dying Robert of 
Locksley, whose party was ambushed by treacherous Godfrey, who hopes to facilitate a French invasion 
of England. Robin promises the dying knight he will return his sword to his father Walter in Nottingham. 
Here Walter encourages him to impersonate the dead man to prevent his land being confiscated by the 
crown, and he finds himself with Marian, a ready-made wife. Hoping to stir baronial opposition to weak 
King John and allow an easy French take-over, Godfrey worms his way into the king's service as Earl 
Marshal of England and brutally invades towns under the pretext of collecting Royal taxes. Can Robin 
navigate the politics of barons, royals, traitors, and the French?
