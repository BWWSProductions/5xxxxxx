      There's debate, dispute and deliberation over the hot topics
      that are getting the almighty British public's chins wagging. As
      ever, presenter and stand up comic Jimmy Carr is in the host's
      chair and is joined by witty team captains Sean Lock and Jason
      Manford. Alongside them sits celebrity guests - Jack Dee, Dr
      Christian Jessen from Embarrassing Bodies, Jack Whitehall and
      Jamelia.
