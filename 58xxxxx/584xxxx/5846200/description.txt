PLOT SUMMARY

The story is centered on a microcosm of a post-apocalyptic
society where food is so rare itâ€™s invaluable and is used
as currency. The story centers on an apartment building with
a delicatessen on the ground floor. The owner of the eatery
also owns the apartment building and he is in need of a new
maintenance man since the original â€œmysteriouslyâ€ disappeared.
A former clown applies for the job and the butcherâ€™s intent
is to have him work for a little while and then serve him
to quirky tenants who pay the butcher in, of course, grain.
The clown and butcherâ€™s daughter fall in love and she tries
to foil her fatherâ€™s plans by contacting the â€œtroglodytesâ€,
a grain eating sub-group of society who live entirely
underground. The â€œtrogsâ€ are possibly the most sensible of
the lot, as they see food as food and not money.
