Product Description

The  player  assumes  the role of Andrew McPhile, an American who has just
inherited  a  Scottish  castle. His girlfriend has persuaded him to go and
claim  his  inheritance,  but  he  discovers  on arrival that the place is
haunted by generations of previous MacPhiles.

Clandestiny  is a cartoon puzzle game in which the player wanders around a
haunted  house  solving logic puzzles. Each solved puzzle triggers a brief
cartoon  to extend the story and also opens another room in the house. The
gameplay  is basically the same as in The 11th Hour, except that there are
no transitions between locations.
