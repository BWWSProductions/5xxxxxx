Just wondering."
,HackinGeek,2010-09-23T15:28Z,"This is smaller, because I haven't included all the titles from previous torrent, but only added new ones.

The comment says: ""All titles that are downloadable from XBLA (from 13.03.2010 to 23.09.2010)."""
,hyeguy123,2010-09-23T18:06Z,"Ohh, I see.

Sorry, I only read the title of the torrent, not the description, so I was a bit confused."
,thiscantbeused7,2010-09-23T18:34Z,Can there bu run from HDD or burned to a disk if the console isn't JTAG'ed or do there work only on JTAG'ed console?
,HackinGeek,2010-09-23T19:01Z,"The console MUST be JTAG'ed in order to play these, because the files of these games are modified so that they show up as free content. And because they are modified the digital signatures of these files are broken. Non - JTAG'ed consoles always check these signatures and JTAG'ed don't."
,thiscantbeused7,2010-09-23T19:32Z,"Ok, thanks. 
And just to be sure, one more question: I have the latest updates from Microsoft, so my console can't be JTAG'ed? "

In short: No."

,Toblehorde,2010-10-05T16:56Z,Please seed i dont wanna wait one day for this pack!! plz just seed!!
,Toblehorde,2010-10-06T00:01Z,Why is not the N+ in the torrent?
,HackinGeek,2010-10-07T14:23Z,"Toblehorde, please read the description above that says: ""For older titles check out my other torrent 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5436199/The_%28Almost%29_Complete_XBLA_Games_Collection_as_of_12.03.2010
""

N+ is title that was released before 13.03.2010, so it is in the other torrent, that is also included in this pack. For complete collection you have to download both."
,mattharb,2010-10-11T08:06Z,"I tried out all the games in this archive. Great work putting this together!

All except 3 worked great. The 3 that gave me problems, along with their error messages:

Aqua
""Storage removed
Returning to Game Library
Storage with the game has been removed.
Returning to Game Library.""

DeathSpank
""Error Reading Content
Unable to read a content file. If playing from an Xbox 360 Memory Unit, please don't remove it while playing.
You will now be taken to the Xbox Dashboard.""

Shank
Just a black screen and have to reset Xbox.

In all 3 cases, deleting everything from cache, and deleting the games from the Dashboard and re-extracting and re-transferring them did not resolve the problems. 

Can anyone else confirm that these 3 titles aren't working?"
,mattharb,2010-10-11T08:08Z,"By the way, just in case it makes a difference, I'm on Freeboot 0.032.

A lot of the games gave me problems on XBReboot until I updated to Freeboot."
,HackinGeek,2010-10-13T11:40Z,"Mattharb, i've tried to reupload games you mentioned from this torrent to my xbox and you were right - they're broken! It looks like there has been some errors while copying them around. I found a working copy of Shank and DeathSpank, but wasn't able to find a working copy of Aqua, so I need to redownload it from XBLA. I'll release fixed titles probably tomorrow.

I apologize for errors."
,HackinGeek,2010-10-14T18:25Z,"I've created a torrent with these three titles fixed. I checked them on my XBOX and they work.
