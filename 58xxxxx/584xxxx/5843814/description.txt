"A Deadly Affair"

When the new season of "Castle" begins, Beckett 
hasn't heard from Castle since he left for the 
Hamptons months ago to finish writing his 
second Nikki Heat novel, "Naked Heat" (on sale 
September 28). The most Beckett, Ryan and 
Esposito have seen of Castle is a bookstore 
standee of him advertising an upcoming book 
signing. So when Beckett and her team burst 
into a shadowy apartment on the trail of a 
murderer, the last thing they expect to see is 
the real-life Castle standing over a dead 
woman's body holding a gun! As Castle protests 
his innocence, Beckett has no choice but to 
arrest him on suspicion of murder.

Enjoy :)
