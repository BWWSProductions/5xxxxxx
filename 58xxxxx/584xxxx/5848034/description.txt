AutoCAD 2010 and AutoCAD LT 2010 Bible.pdf.


Congratulations!
Whether you are a new or expert user with AutoCAD, you have truly made a worthwhile investment
with the AutoCAD 2010 & AutoCAD LT 2010 Bible. This book will be a valuable addition to your library
that you will use on a regular basis as a reference and guide to using AutoCAD. With each release of
AutoCAD and its new feature set, the AutoCAD Bible is an excellent resource for learning and getting up
to speed quickly on all things AutoCAD.
Everything from the basics of AutoCAD to 3D and programming is covered in this book. The information
is well organized, and a comprehensive index makes retrieving information that you need a cinch.
Youâ€™ll see real-world examples and AutoCAD drawings on the DVD that will quickly help you to understand
and learn new concepts through the exercises. Even more helpful is the fact that the drawings are
available in both a before and after format, allowing you to use the after format as a reference.
Ellen has been writing books about AutoCAD for so long that she is practically a household name here
at Autodesk and in the AutoCAD world. She is an active participant in our beta program and helps
shape the direction of future releases of AutoCAD. You are truly learning from one of the finest and most
experienced professionals in this field.
Although the in-depth coverage of this book may seem overwhelming, do not feel discouraged by the
bookâ€™s thickness. Pick out the tools that you want to learn about and then proceed from there. If you are
interested in learning new features, pick a different topic each week to learn about it.
Thank you, Ellen, for creating another
