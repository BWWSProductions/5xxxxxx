THE BEAST OF BODMIN


THE BEAST OF BODMIN: whether it is a
native cat, previously thought extinct,
or an escaped exotic pet, the Beast of
Bodmin is a creature that refuses to disappear.
Indeed, sightings of the panther-like creature
continue apace and, unlike other mysterious
beasts, modern technology is actually helping
to prove its existence. Bodmin Moor is an area
of National Park land in Cornwall, southwest
England. Since 1983 there have been over
sixty sightings of big cats in the area, and
some experts suggest there may be a whole
breeding population on the moors.
