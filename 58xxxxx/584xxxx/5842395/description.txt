Carrying a bagful of metal junk to repair her father's old car, June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is on her way to her sister's wedding when she accidentally bumps into Roy Miller (Tom Cruise), a charming and handsome man. After repeatedly bumping into each other at the airport and finally finding out that they are on the same flight, they just flirt with each other. She finds out during the course of a rather entertaining flight that Roy is a rogue FBI agent, whose intentions is not exactly clear in the beginning. She is smack in the middle of all the chaos just because she happens to be a witness to something called the Zephyr, a perpetual energy source. June has to figure out who she can trust in this crazy situation; the FBI or Roy? During the course of the story, June and Roy travel all over the globe (Massachusetts, California, Austria, Jamaican Islands, Illinois, Spain among others) to keep the Zephyr away from the bad guys. The FBI and many others are after Roy and the Zephyr, but it turns out that Roy is being framed by his former partner who wants to sell the Zephyr to terrorists. Roy manages to save the world from evil and also saves June from all the terrible misfortunes.
