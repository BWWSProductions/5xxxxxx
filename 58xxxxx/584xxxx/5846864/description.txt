An explosive action tale of betrayal and revenge, The Losers centers around an elite Special Forces unit sent to the Bolivian jungle on a search-and-destroy mission. But the team â€“ Clay, Jensen, Roque, Pooch and Cougar â€“ soon find that they have become the target of a deadly double cross instigated by a powerful enemy known only as Max. Making good use of the fact theyâ€™re now presumed dead, the group goes deep undercover in a dangerous plot to clear their names and even the score with Max.
