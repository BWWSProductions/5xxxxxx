@jerikoslap: the reason people in the US are so incredibly simple-minded and uneducated is that they are ""trained"" in school.  Not educated.  Trained.  See: The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America by Charlotte Iserbyt (a former Reagan administration education official)

They start with the most powerful nation.  Devalue the currency, subjugate the sheeple,  and then on to rest of the world..."
