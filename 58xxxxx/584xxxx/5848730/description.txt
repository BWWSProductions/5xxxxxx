"The Fabian Strategy"

Determined to help Liz (Fey) keep a man 
for once, Jack (Baldwin) meddles in her 
burgeoning relationship with Carol 
(guest star Damon). At home, he also 
struggles to compromise with Avery as 
she redecorates his apartment. 
Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) 
has trouble coming to grips with 
Kenneth's (Jack McBrayer) termination 
as a page and Jenna (Jane Krakowski) 
becomes TGS' newest producer.

Enjoy :)
