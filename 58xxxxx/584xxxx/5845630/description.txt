Ed McCabe holds a degree in Educational Media from the University of Massachusetts. He is an investigative journalist and leading international author, lecturer, and promoter of oxygen therapies. His ongoing involvement with advanced healing modalities encompasses a span of over 25 years. He solely focused upon oxygen therapies as a research journalist during 18 years of intensive study, investigation, experimentation, interviews, and travel. As a result, he is recognized and acclaimed as an international expert on the subject.

Although several oxygen therapies have been quietly in use for over 100 years, prior to Mr. McCabe's extensive pioneering body of work, the general public is completely unaware of them.
