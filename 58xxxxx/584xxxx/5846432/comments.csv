First of all, the graphics are great until 1 or 2 seconds into a race, then they get all messed up, and second, you never know if the race will go all the way to the end, it will just zap you all of a sudden to the race stats, and even though you were in first place on A main, it may say you were 3rd on B main, could you just re-upload or something to fix this. Thanks, and also could you upload the soundtrack by itself, I have been trying to get that forever, nobody has it. Thanks again"
