,daveo76,2010-09-27T13:18Z,@ citizendonny: fw means firewall
,citizendonny,2010-09-27T16:21Z,stupid me. firewall. thank you. so I assume that it is not updateable because you block the app from going to the site? right?

,zogger0923,2010-10-30T03:12Z,Can't figure out which zip file to start with? I've tried the first and last and few in between but none unpack the entire archive. Suggestions?

I just hit the same wall.  I'm thinking to convert all the RARs to a single ISO with IMGburn then mount the ISO onto DAEMON Tools to launch from there."
