Roadwork (album)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Roadwork is a live album by vocalist/keyboardist/saxophonist Edgar Winter and his band White Trash, a powerful revue famous for their fusion of Funk, Gospel, R&B and Rock & Roll. It was released as a double 

LP in 1972. Roadwork was the second of only three albums the band recorded together.

Highlights include Winter's virtuoso keyboard and vocal work, and the guitar stylings of Rick Derringer. The longest track on the album was the band's own version of the John D. Loudermilk song, "Tobacco 

Road", which lasted over 17 minutes, taking up an entire side of the album. Derringer contributed lead vocals to "Still Alive and Well" and "Back in the USA", and Johnny Winter made a special appearance 

singing lead on "Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo". Louisiana native Jerry LaCroix, who shared lead vocals with Winter in White Trash, is also prominently featured.

The album was recorded before live audiences at the Apollo Theater in New York and in Los Angeles at the legendary Whiskey A Go Go night club.

Production notes

At the start of their appearance at the Apollo Theater, the unidentified host who introduced them chided their evident late arrival saying (slightly off mic):

"Y'know, every time we used to go outta town for them jive jobs they give us, they always say 'black folks: late, can't be on time,' now look at the White Trash!" (chuckle)

The comment was met with laughter from the audience. After the introduction, the audience again broke out into sporadic laughter, possibly not expecting much from the band as it consisted of all white 

musicians, but their doubts were quickly dispelled when the band launched into "Cool Fool", a funky R&B song.

This snipet appears on the original vinyl release at the beginning of Side 4.
