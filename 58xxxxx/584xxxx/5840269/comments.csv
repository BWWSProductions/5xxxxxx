,Collektor,2010-11-14T01:50Z,"Excellent visual quality but I am getting a persistent high pitched background ringing sound whenever there is sound e.g. someone talking, music, sound effects etc. It is soft but really really damn annoying. Anyone else experienced this? (Playback through a Tvix/WD Live & home theater setup, 100% sure its not my gear)"
