This is a documentary about Terry Gilliams filmmaking process.  It was made during the production of Tideland, and is directed by Vincenzo Natali.  Natalis three previous works are Cube, Cypher and Nothing; films that have been influenced by Gilliams work.

Getting Gilliam is a fascinating, if brief, film-student examination of what is the directing mind of Terry Gilliam, who works here on Tideland, his crazy movie- and much crazier than one might even typically expect from him. Vincenzo Natali follows along on the slightly bumpy ride of the production of the film, wedged between a production stalling on Brothers Grimm, and little by little we get pieces of what Gilliam is about as a filmmaker and just as a very humorous but focused maverick. He allows for inspiration to hit at any moment on the set, he sets the mood, good or bad (bad only comes, not too oddly enough, the day Bush is re-elected, as he makes Brazil comparisons to present-day), and he's one who can sway between moods of total delight, inner peace (laying on the ground in the dark), and controlled frustration at the little quirks of film-making.
