	In August 2001, Echo and the Bunnymen  returned to their hometown to play two concerts at Paul McCartney's Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts (LIPA). The concerts were recorded and this two cd set finds the band in extremely fine form, delivering fabulous live versions of their three top ten singles "The Cutter", "The Killing Moon" and "Nothing Lasts Forever", as well as "Rescue", "Never Stop", "Bring On The Dancing Horses" and "Seven Seas". Six tracks are previously unreleased on cd ...... enjoy !!
