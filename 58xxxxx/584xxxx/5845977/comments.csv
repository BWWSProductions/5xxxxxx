[V],sonilem,2010-09-23T23:47Z,"Sorry This Upload Is Taking So Long. I made the mistake of uploading 3 of my six folders at the same time. I can ony get an average of 130KBps upload at the best of times. You split this between 3 folders of this size and it takes a while. Sorry about that. When these have uploaded, i will upload the final 3 one at a time, so you all get them sooner. I think that makes sence. (No)! LMAO."
