,a_seeder,2010-11-22T23:28Z,"I also found a virus and trojan via Norton Internet Security 2011.  AVG 2011 did not find anything though.  I am not sure about this.  (Actually Norton just popped up and said:  ""The file directory was wiped and the applications blocked for your safety.  Your computer is secure."""

,Raian86,2011-01-28T17:25Z,"This game works totally fine, the only problem i found was the same one ""Icabob"" mentioned. there is no in game music, no cinematics, and the characters, like raynor etc, dont speak.. the game runs fine and plays great, the sound effects and shit work, just not the music, main character voices/breifing.. still worth downloading if u love the game."
,jasperz0r,2011-01-29T07:20Z,"wow, downloaded it in only 2 minutes or so, thanks a lot, I hope it works. btw I'll be seeding for months"

,samljer,2011-02-10T02:52Z,"He says he wont ever include a virus on purpose
so i think its an accident.

just to be safe i loaded this up in a hardware assisted virtualPC box ""used 2 of my 4 cores, 2 of my 8gb"" and it was good. Avast detected a virus and i ignored it, after a few runs
my virtual PC Virtual HD was all kindsa fucked up and my host OS ""win7"" AV started to flag the HDD file.

theres definatly a virus in this somewhere and i suggest you NOT download this one."
,pinksockitup,2011-02-20T08:37Z,"fuck this dude, found a trojan in this bullshit"
,pinksockitup,2011-02-20T08:38Z,mine says trojan too
,pinksockitup,2011-02-20T19:25Z,got a trojan
,twitchycc,2011-03-08T00:48Z,the only reason it is coming up as a virus is because the .dll file is modded. i havent had any problem so far but i will let yall know.
,codnips,2011-03-17T00:48Z,idc even if it was a virus I can always just wipe my harddrive and come bitch at someone :D ty for compressing this 
,TateLeon,2011-03-18T18:29Z,Perfect torrent! Works like a charm. thanks a lot FuCtUpPuNk
,dramacydal77,2011-03-19T06:43Z,no one is seeding this
,Anth0ny,2011-03-24T01:52Z,this works and all (no virus) but if you plan on multiplaying over UDP (lan) don't use this because you can't. It's an older version that doesn't support it.
,abdikhadir,2011-03-25T13:38Z,Im stuck in the RAZOR 1911 Loader........ Nothing happens......
,mogura,2011-03-31T21:00Z,WARNING there's a trojan in this file that starts wiping the HD drive where it's installed once you try to deinstall it. It wiped all files on my HD except files with foreign script in the file names for some reason. FuCtUpPuNk either you're an asshole that deserves to be sliced into pieces or somebody else has taken control of your torrent. Eithery way nobody should trust you
,MasterDFX,2011-04-27T06:31Z,"My Norton did flip out a bit when I tried to play this, but the game is working just fine. Very simple. The auto-loader was nice. Thanks!"
,TimmyTordah,2011-04-30T23:58Z,"Surely any report of a virus is a false positive due to the program being modified, else he wouldn't have a pink skull. And as to freewillly's comment - You have vista, it's a virus in itself. I've used this on 10~ computers and it works perfectly on all of them."
,Benishdamenish,2011-05-02T22:40Z,"Noobs.. don't know the difference between a virus and false positive. The game is fine learn to say thank you for taking the time out of your life to make ours more bearable.

Thanks FuCtUpPuNk"

,Darqsido,2011-05-24T03:36Z,"People saying this has a Trojan are fucking stupid.

YES your anti-virus may catch it as a Trojan. But do you know why? Don't think so, fucking morons.

It's a clean torrent, from a trusted user, and has not fucked with my PC one bit.

Dumbass dickshits"
,alexgriff,2011-05-27T02:36Z,it works but is fawkin laggy as hell
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-06-03T22:53Z,"any ass-monkey that thinks there is a virus in here is slightly retarded, or just flat out dumb as fuck. it's also not laggy at all unless u are on either a really really extremely fucking low-end weak pc that u bought when computers first came out, or on an over powered piece of shit. but there are ways to fix it on an over powered computer. google is ur best homie. enjoy the game.

p.s. gAyVG (AVG) is the worst piece of shit fagoty antiviruis on the net. 87.9% of the things it detects are not harmful in any way to ur pc."
,Davidm88,2011-06-04T19:06Z,"hi,

i started the campaign tutorial mission, isnt there supposed to be sound when the bitch reads the instructions? (like when it says press start, or skip tutorial) cos there wasnt for me. i dont remember if there is supposed to be so just wondering..other than that it works great.

There is no virus btw...just adding to clarification"
,Davidm88,2011-06-04T19:14Z,"o yeah also i just noticed theres no music in the mission either...

sad face"
,willemark01,2011-06-07T06:04Z,"When I open the BROOD or StarCraft.exe I get ""StarCraft is unable to read a required file. Your Starcraft CD may not be in the CDROM drive."" What do I do?"
,IlanF,2011-06-10T22:55Z,I think it is a RIP and not a full game
,daniel98,2011-06-21T12:34Z,"@willemark01
youve probably put the brood folder in your program files folder. just keep it in c:/brood where the install wants to put it, then after the install run the brood-c patch and voila, it should work."
,daniel98,2011-06-21T12:36Z,"this works great and all (minus the sound....) but im getting some severe mouse lag on a pretty decent pc, certainly decent enough to run this game...anything i can do to fix this?"
,semigod,2011-06-22T19:27Z,"Fast download (less than 2 minutes!). Easy installation, cracked and working 100%!!!

Thank for a quality torrent!"
,chivaflow,2011-06-26T06:17Z,"it worked well, just run something called ""Setup"" and run the game! enjoy"

,BlargDe7,2011-08-27T01:51Z,"Ok. I downloaded it fast and got it installed. While installing it the first time thought my McAffee deleted a trojan which i think is important and then i cut off everything for my anti virus and then i uninstalled and reinstalled. Patched it. And then when i click to start it, it starts for a sec and then crashes."
,xELiiTEx,2011-09-30T04:16Z,Perfect one of the easiest torrents to install nice work
,Aiwou,2011-10-18T12:18Z,"wow, just went on toilet for few seconds and it's downloaded... Including download and installation, it took me like 4 minutes and works!!! Thx for great torrent of great game :-)"
