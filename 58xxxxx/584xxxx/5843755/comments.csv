,RanDoRian,2010-10-02T17:59Z,"I'm confused, 
Tried to install it, got some texts like:
This doesn't work like any other version available...
and
f u co*cksucker
wtf...
did not install anything, at all, only played star wars sounds etc.
Did I do smtng wrong or is this just bllsht..."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-10-05T07:10Z,"@RanDoRian i'll be reporting you. it works just fine you are just a noob. install it from your desktop. if on win vista or 7, try running in compatibility....dont be an idiot by insulting other people for your own lack of computer skills."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-10-05T14:10Z,"wait nvm, i misread the comment. not reporting. my bad. when you load the toed.exe press esc. then the installation should start. if not try enter and space bar. make sure you are installing them from the extracted folder, but be sure to place that folder on your desktop."
,iLkc,2010-10-07T04:24Z,theres a trojan horse here
,J-Razor,2010-10-12T09:46Z,Does this work with vista 64 bit anyone ?
,RanDoRian,2010-10-18T15:39Z,"@FuCtUpPuNK:
That's ok, This is what happende: 
after I tried to install your game, appearently coinsidence made other games go bad 2 and not work anymore, so I put 1 and 2 together, and took the logical choice of deleting your game.
HOWEVER.
Your purple skull and written comment re-assurred me the games are ok, but  I already bought both for 15 euros.

Thanks anyway for putting effort in to hacking codes and cracking games, ripping, etc. It saves me a lot of money, filtering out the bullshit games by playing them for free  first.

@iLkc:
Ever installed other ripped/cracked games?
In MOST of them, there are keygens and other .exe's that are picked out by virusscanners. 

So just check the comments and the purple or green skulls, for re-assurance."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2010-10-21T01:34Z,"aiight man. well thanks for letting me know. ill see what i can figure out about all that. never ran into anything like that before, but i didnt crack this. i got it else where...saw tpb n a few other sites needed a good repack of the game, so i tested it, then made the instructions."
,Paitryn,2010-10-23T12:37Z,"I had a similar problem downloaded and installed game, afterwards it asked my to press any key to continue, did that and the screen appeared with the floating box telling me fuck you i tried pressing enter esc or space bar....nothing happened clicked the mouse and it came out and did nothing else. tried using the battlefront 2 icon just a black screen..."
,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-26T21:52Z,"This kid really IS ""fukt up""! This thing takes over 3GB just to load, that's sick! Let's get around his
bullshit though by doing the following:

In both games, delete 1eyed.exe & 2eyed.exe UNLESS you like being flipped the bird. This prog. does NOTHING for the install.

Next, edit ALL of his batch files and CHANGE THE ORDER of called .uha files to be Unarc'd.
Start with the largest one first, tectec.uha because you want that one DELETED first to free disk space. 

Now why the HELL this masturbating little VIRGIN jerkoff needs to ""DUPE"" Gigs of files
with _install.bat, I have NO clue but I think you do not need to be doing that, save a couple gigs right there! I will check this.

Yous should also REM out all lines in his batch files which call for .uha file deletion, otherwise you'll be right back here like I am now D/L'ing the shit AGAIN!

I don't even know if this turkey will run on my box yet."
,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-26T21:55Z,"These 2 games are POORLY put together: It should be in a separate directory and the batch files should call to that area during build, instead he DELETES the source files as the batch goes on. So if the 1st load fails, you're fucked w/o the source files! FUCKING IDIOT!"
,Nirvana281,2010-11-17T00:16Z,"Game works, but the multiplayer doesn't."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-01-05T16:30Z,"@RC_Ebooks you are a dumb fag and you need to get a freaking life!!!! be happy that you are able to get games for free, or go do the emo thing. i'm sure we'd all love for you to do what emo's do best. :) cheers"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-01-08T11:06Z,@RC_Ebooks stop posting on all my torrents you lifeless troll. get a life.

,purvil,2011-10-16T13:07Z,"it stucks at ""duping files""
please help.."
,kyneflaretail,2011-10-17T04:25Z,"i tried getting the full torrent, a few times, but unforetuneately it either incorrectly downloads a good portion of the files, or they're just plain corrupt, so this torrent has gone bad."
,Syrith,2012-01-06T07:23Z,The uploader FuCtUpPuNk  is a fucking faggot.  Just check his comments.  That a little childish prick ^^   You might report others for calling you names but you do the same thing to others.    I'll make sure to report you too dipshit. Get off the internet.
,eltaxista,2012-01-08T18:21Z,Does anyone knows if it works on Windows 7 64 bit?
,regen2100,2012-01-21T05:12Z,"Mse and McAfee both detected a Trojan

2eyed.exe is the one that contains it, If the trojan is removed the application might not work. 

Did you test this torrent first FuCtUpPuNk? 
Did you even attempt to clean the file system first before uploading?"
