Greets to memory100 for being such a great help :)

NOTE: Game has been tested extensively:

- Boots off internal AND external, MUST BE ON FW 3.41 TO BE ABLE TO BOOT GAME ON A JAILBROKEN PS3
- However, if you have a genuine copy of the game and have installed updates, i.e. 1.04, you will get an "insert disc" 

error message when trying to boot the game
- To boot, delete any update data in the "GAME DATA" Folder on the PS3, the game will only run on the original base version 

(V 1.00)
- As with most games, Online does not work because of FW 3.41, DLC also will not work as this will get deleted alongside 

the game data if you already have a genuine copy and if you do not, then obtaining the DLC is impossible as you will have 

no access to PSN.
