A tender love story set during a hot summer on a South-East London housing
estate. Jamie, a relatively unpopular lad who bunks off school to avoid football,
lives next door to Ste, a more popular athletic lad but who is frequently beaten
up by his father and older brother. Such an episode of violence brings Jamie and
Ste together: Sandra (Jamie's mum) offers refugee to Ste, who has to 'top-and-tail' 
with Jamie.
