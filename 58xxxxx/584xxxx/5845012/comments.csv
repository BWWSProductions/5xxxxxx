,leratz,2010-09-22T06:53Z,do you plan on uploading the rams vs raiders game from week 2? it was blacked out in my area and i'm having a helluva time finding it! your uploads are the best!
[V],phatwarez,2010-09-22T07:34Z,I would if I had it. Nobody has released it and it's not going to be shown here so I can't record it. Guess nobody cares much for the rams =P
,curdo-00,2010-09-22T10:22Z,i dont understand why do u have to upload some of the games in MKV format! couldnt they be simple avi.? 
,curdo-00,2010-09-22T14:02Z,"@sporc

funny you say...the MKV files i DL are out of sync...ive never had syc problems with any avi. file so far but almost every MKV file i have played has been out of sync. 

anyways, as you said he can use mp4...as long as its not MKV...

once again thanks to phatwarez for everything..."
