please rip the game darksiders and upload it as soon as possible because the actual game size is 13 gb and it will take more than 1 week for some users to download it....

with proper description, and no lie's to the users!.

come visit the place to be, and dont feed the troll!
"
,Guuru5,2010-09-22T16:38Z,"A few remarks from a guy who have been on the scene for a while.

I have to say I admire your stamina and eager to feed the people and give comments, Globe.

My experience is that it takes longer time to download these rips, than full games, so if you are in a hurry dont download this.

I also have problems with you calling this direct play. Compared to tptb rips this is no direct play by definition. To often things with your label on has failed me. Maybe my bad knowledge or due to deficient or bad description.


"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-22T17:37Z,"To p2ppirate : i think i said to you in the last file that you are not welcome to put comments in my files , just bus off once for all from the comments of my files with your real bullshit publicity to real bullshit files that try to look smart , JUST BEAT IT !!!
and donÂ´t comeback , in the end you are just one more morron that they make clean to the brain to spread bullshit publicity . "
[V],globeplus,2010-09-22T17:44Z,To Guuru5 : donÂ´t interpretate me wrong and i am not putting the question if this file is more fast or not but of course you can try it for yourself but beside that if can be true or not you are missing the real points on this work : you get absolute the complete game with total normality in everything and then you will be occupying less hard disk space for the same game and for example who have limitations in number of downloads per month in amount of giga that can download and it is many services like that out there and evryone under his own possibilitys like to play the new nice pc games and for this kind of users for example they certainly appreciate getting the complete game in total normality for a nice size and to finish : CERTAINLY NOT TOO MUCH TIME AS THAT TO GET THE FILE ANYWAY !!! of course can depend in the users downloading services from the cable services but i have at least a few users that download in fast services that you need to pay to get more downloading speed that in half-an-hour already have the file no doubt !!! so analise before all the aspects about this type of work before making conjectures that you are certainly not really shore !!!
,Likeadidas95,2010-09-22T18:19Z,"UM .. latest torrents have shown that u have serious problems with them .. but i realllly HOPE that this is going to work, cuz i have downloaded MANY of your torrents ! :)
i really hope that this is going to work ! :)
also, people please seed .. im getting only 0-10kbs ! so please ! :) also some1 comment that this work 100 % ? all vids and stuff !"
,NYDant,2010-09-22T18:39Z,"@Guuru5
if you dont like globes rip please dont download this torrent....
most of the globes rip are nearly 50% of the original and even more
like 1.8 globes rip and around 5.7 for the clone dvd of f1 2010
and its good for users having low bandwith....
and it even saves place in your hdd... so think twice before commenting"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-22T18:57Z,"Thank you NYDant you simply made a complementary observation about what i already said and just for saying that your request is not beeing negligentiated and i am in my own way in the necessary time . Thank you for your comment .
To likeadidas95 : if you know my pratical files it was more than about time to be shore about my work no matter what and if you know me you know already that no matter is the situation i never let down any users recognising that sometimes a small fix or a reajust can be necessary once in a while but never leaving the users without help in that case , in this particular one just a absolute correct analysis to get the correct competent work and my iuntention is always the files beeing olike this but who downloads files on the torrents knows too that sometimes we have to adaptate in what is possible to do with the available games files like for example the new online drm from ubisoft and so on , other times waiting a more accurate worked executable because in the 3rd level or mission for example you get a borring bug that is impeding the normal gameplay and so we torrent files users need have nice good sense with always with the perspective in mind of course to get the games better as possible to be played and please in most of the cases simply forget about thye multiplayers they can be complex a kind of problematic sometimes to real buyers with keys imagine for banal torrent games files without keys ."

If U Cant Respect Sum1 ...Dont Disrespect Him

Are You A Ripper NO! ...So How Do U Know The Meaning Of Directplay...What Globe Is Doing Is Called As Directplay

And What Tptb Does Is Called As Rip

Dont Try To Create A Fight Between Both Of Them"
,NYDant,2010-09-22T19:48Z,"@JoeKKer
u r absolutely rite....."
[V],globeplus,2010-09-22T19:50Z,"To Joekker : that is very inteligent from you because you are a new ripper on the scene but let me tell you something and don´t forget it : don´t let the berloques on the hat (like the batman enemy have ) affect you and keep in mind make a respectful serious work to the possible users of your files , ok ? Remember when you feel a little borred you have globe around . "
,Guuru5,2010-09-22T21:12Z,"To nydant and globe: The low downloadspeed comment was meant for pc -  rips in general globe or tptb. Many with low bandwith prefer to download this, giving low upload to the torrent. It looks to me that most people want fast download, thats why I suggest that THEY go for the full version. Instead of using their time on screaming SEED SEED SEED 
Its a lot talk about respect. Dont be so touchy.
I only want to share my experiences.

To Joekker: In Toeds (tptb) rips you only have to unrar and  run setup bat. Than its ready to play from desktop.Thats what I call real directplay ( and so does the ripper himself)
My second point is that.
In my experience tptb rips are easier to handle for the averagejoe ( like myself), and with more chance of a successfull result.

"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-22T21:31Z,"To Guuru5 : you donÂ´t understand shit about anything and somehow yoiu are lost in your mind with something that you get happy with a download or something , the true that you are trying to implicate with something but you donÂ´t have the real nonsense of the things and a setup.bat for this game is really bullshit work ans i really doubt about the necessary adequated support programs , in this file it is only a arc extarction not to be hanging a long time in a bat with files that donÂ´t justify the main bat , so just making a bat because it is like that ... the procedure is far from beeing a correct analysis abiut the correct work for this game , wake up and be yourself having the right to choose files to download , donÂ´t put yourself in a kind of dependence for no special reason anyaway , you a torrent user and you can choose freely your files .

thanks for explaining how the real direct play games are working, but ill suggest to stop arguing with those tossers like globe, he never gets it into his little brain, he's just stealing ""direct play"" name, to get more downloads on his releases, but we all trust more into the real direct.play games releases from TPTB/ToeD. as we ALL KNOW these are the ONLY and were the FIRST direct.play games released, all other (for example globe) are just immitations, greets globe!"

[V],globeplus,2010-09-22T23:08Z,"To adidas95 : why a guy that already downloaded some of my files are acting absolutly stupid in my comments without no reason and seeing this file with lot of users , where is the sense in that ? Are you on drugs ? or just alchool ? it is ok that can feel nice but it s not really good to the health , just be yourself in a normal way again because acting like this you look strange and never more call shit to one of my files , it is ridiculous because you donÂ´t have the file and i really have a perfect decent and competent work and just the suggestion of that looks absurd , this is absolutly the correct work and if i had to repeat the work iÂ´ll do it exactly the same thing no doubt ."

,blade134134,2010-09-23T08:08Z,"Well i found solution to that annoying noise.Anyone else having this problem can do these following steps:

For Windows XP

If you are using Windows XP follow the instructions below to change audio settings:

   1. Click the Start button > Settings > Control Panel.
   2. Double-click the Sounds and Audio Devices icon.
   3. Click the Volume tab.
   4. Under Speaker settings, click the Advanced button.
   5. Click the Performance tab.
   6. Reduce the Hardware acceleration to Basic, the 2nd notch from the left.
   7. Click Apply and then OK 2 times. Run the game now. Don't forget to turn the acceleration back up to restore the high-end features for your sound card when using other applications."

There's a very easy way to play MP, but it does involve handing over $$$ to your local game store. Short answer is, new GFWL games can't be played online if they're from TPB! (older gfwl games, like Halo 2 and GTA IV had an exploit)"
