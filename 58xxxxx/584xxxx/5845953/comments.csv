For those of you who want this music, you play by my rules.........  I am slowing down the seed, so you will have to leave the file open to get the rest of the file.  If you really want it you will just have to wait your turn and share.  I know I am coming off as a prick, but I don't care.  If you aren't willing to share these torrents, then your option is........ go out and BUY the cd.  That's all.  Out of respect to the artist who has committed suicide last April 2011...... make a GD effort to keep these torrents alive so others (who cannot afford the nightmarish price of this particular cd), may be able to download it.  I will seed for a while. After that, it just goes dead and that's it.  This is supposed to be a 'sharing' environment...... that is a pile of BULLSHIT!!  MOOCHING!! environment is more like it."
