,eddn,2010-10-20T01:32Z,Can someone tell me the timing settings to get the subtitles to align with the movie?  Usually FXG subs are spot on.  Naturally when I can't speak the language......
,eddn,2010-10-20T01:41Z,"My mistake.  I was using the wrong subtitles.  I'm embarrassed.
Thanks FXG.
Spot on as always."
,eddn,2010-10-20T01:45Z,"Wow, how'd you remove my comments?
Cool that you did since it was the wrong movie, but I didn't realize you could edit out comments like that."
