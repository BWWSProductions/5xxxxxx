Alex welcomes to the show Gary E. Johnson, businessman, triathlete, and libertarian politician who served as the 29th Governor of the U.S. state of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003. Johnson is the chairman of a political advocacy organization, the Our America Initiative. He believes that the Constitution should be interpreted according to its original meaning and that a proper balance needs to be restored between the different branches of government. He supports the rights of states. Johnson has also been the subject of media speculation as a possible candidate for President in the 2012 election.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
