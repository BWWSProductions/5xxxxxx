Hey friend, how are you?
OK so today i was able to download 25th hour. After watching Equilibrium I didnt like its (25th hour) quality much. But still its just OK. I wish you would have ripped it at atleast 360p. But Equilibrium was a very good rip . +1 for that and thanks for both."

@i_am_sid: Apples and oranges. You obviously cannot relate file-size and format-size. If formats were same, 25th would be 1 GIGA. Acknowledge please, that frame-format of 25th H. is 16/9.

Also, we all want to be prettier, smarter or rich, right? But all things are not as we like them. 

BTW, 272p and 320p would stay as my main formats - even if world turns upside down."

Hey mate, you are right. Its my mistake, i didnt noticed the aspect ratio. Really sorry for commenting without proper knowledge but i didnt said it was a bad rip and its really not.  Right now i m watching the movie and its great. Just came here to say ""thanks"". 
Looking forward to Se7en."
