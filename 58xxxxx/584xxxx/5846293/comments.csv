Xlemonad: I tried to play the game with a standard xbox360 pad but i couldn't. I would be more than happy, if you could tell me how can I do that. Thank you for your reply in advance."
,Dudken,2010-11-21T20:34Z,"It works. The only problem is you can't play the game with a simple controller, so if you haven't got a guitar controller don't download the game. I have to buy a guitar controller. I feel it.. :D"
