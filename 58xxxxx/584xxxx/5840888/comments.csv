,TempDude29,2010-09-20T14:03Z,"Just to be clear: This is a pre-expansion patch, not the actual expansion. Lots of interesting pre-cataclusm goodies though!

(Some people on various forums seems to think this patch IS the expansion)"
,egor_sosna,2010-09-20T17:00Z,"ye, thx  MR TempDude29

it is data for incomin pre-expansion events - zone & talents changes, precataclysm events

,jaydon19,2010-09-20T23:25Z,How do you install this? I see no .exe or updater.exe or anything
,egor_sosna,2010-09-20T23:31Z,"Just put em in your \World of Warcraft\Updates folder
You can also re-run background downloader after, it will recheck these 2 files as it shown on image"
,egor_sosna,2010-09-20T23:36Z,"+ if   \World of Warcraft\Updates\   contains any .part files delete em

WoW-3.3.0.10958-4.0.0.12911-EU-Stage-1
WoW-3.3.0.10958-4.0.0.12911-EU-Stage-2
