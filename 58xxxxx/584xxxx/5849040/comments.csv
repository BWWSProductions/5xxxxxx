,checkalt666,2010-12-19T08:10Z,"Good torrent but there is missing an album: ""Vicious Circle"" from 2003. 
And there are some mistagged / name files in the 1973 and 1991 albums (maybe others, just checked till the 1991 one). For example FREE BIRD is named and tagged as ""03.Gimme Three Steps"".
So I don't recommend you to download this torrent unless you know every song from them, so you can correct the song files and tags.
Long live to the pirates."
