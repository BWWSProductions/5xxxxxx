,GUYMOVIE,2010-09-24T09:33Z,another quality release from omega...thanks alot good movie
,omegafox84,2010-09-25T00:34Z,you're welcome!
,the604,2010-09-26T15:30Z,Unfortunately no extras on this one. Thanks for the upload anyway.
,omegafox84,2010-09-26T21:00Z,the only extras this had were trailers. i don't think there are any regular dvd versions with the extras you're looking for. if you want any other extras you'll have to get the blu-ray version.
,the604,2010-09-27T01:52Z,"there is a 2 disc special edition dvd released...with the 2nd disc being the digital copy, and extras on the first disc.

but probably will just buy it for the extras.
Thanks again though!"
,omegafox84,2010-09-27T02:03Z,"wow, i didn't know they actually had a special edition available on standard dvd! it must not be very common around here. sorry, i couldn't help you and you're welcome."
