Gil (Gillian Chung) is a vengeful girl who's just lost her boyfriend. Out of reckless anger, she joins the Fantastic Water Babes swimming competition against her romantic rival and her friends (including model Chrissie Chau), even though she doesn't know how to swim. When celebrity swimmer Yuen (Alex Fong Lik Sun) doesn't follow through on his public promise to help her, Gil kidnaps him to Cheung Chau to make him teach her and her friends how to swim. With the entire community of Cheung Chau working to keep Yuen on the island, there is no escape for him. Yuen slowly comes to like the community and Gil, but will that make her give up her revenge plan?
