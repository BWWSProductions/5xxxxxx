If you ( everybody ) look at a torrent and it has no screenshots ( for porn) or link to boxcover/official info about the file ( for films or tvseries etc) google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out who dont know what the file is ! please dont be as  lazy as 95% of tpb users and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself , the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now !
also seed dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets you upload eg a 50mb download service probably has a 1.5mb upload speed, the faster you upload the faster you download thats how bittorent works.
im not a hypocrite sometimes when i go to post info tpb says error etc failed to write..i dont have time to remember to go back to the files i couldnt help out on..so if u spot files needing info please help out"
,SamHefron,2010-09-26T04:09Z,"""please warn us next time tvteam"" I agree! At the very least, IMDB should be obligated to include ""gay"" in their genre tags. This should be ""gay comedy"". Just leaving it as ""comedy"" is so wrong."
,dejzi1983,2010-09-27T16:49Z,"i was just checking your comments and had to respond... i went to IMDB and i think this is enough for a description: 

Plot Keywords:
Autobiographical | Gay | Gay Romance | Claim In Title 

-----------------------------------------------------
don't be silly about there should be genre like gay comedy!!!!!! comedy is comedy, it doesen't matter what the subject is, it's supposed to be comical no matter the subject! :P"
,bonzai37,2010-09-28T10:31Z,"GAY isn't comical. It's sick, disgusting, and repulsive. Yeah I said it."
,Fuzi0719,2010-12-11T22:35Z,"awww you poor immature 'tards.  It's a funny movie, grow up."
