IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO: Devil Cam XviD (2010)- HoGz  ......Thanks
AUDIO: Devil Cam XviD (2010)- HoGz ......Thanks

Well firstly the source we used was hogs avi file, now the quality video was was poor... very very dark, too more chroma and well poor. That isn't a knock at them, thats just the camera used to capture it.
Audio, well thats even worse... very quiet vocals, dull and as some noise and a echo.
Work done... first thing was to strip the audio and tweak it some in AA, used a noise reduction filter,increased vocals,changed the bass/treb/mid aswell and then resaved to mp3 44100 128.
The video we made a little script, too change the brightness and contrast, lower the chroma, make it sharper, changed the AR, white balance and also a slight tweak in the rgb colours.
Once done we remuxed the new audio to our encode.

Now the screens below show the best and worse of this release... dark and light screenies.
Got to be honest and say it ain't the best, but only source out at the mo... so grab the sample, check the screenies and then decide and yes no doubt there will be better, but when?? who knows

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
