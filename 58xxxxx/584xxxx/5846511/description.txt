The Professor and Co. return for the third time.

In my opinion this is the best one yet as the story is great and it gives away alot of secrets about the professors past.

This version definitely works on the R4.

I found it to be slightly laggy using an emulator on the PC, but that might just be me.

Anyway... Enjoy!
