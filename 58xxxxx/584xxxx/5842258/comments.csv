Standalone version is nuked. It does not stay activated. I recommend using the plugins anyway."

,SnuffyXxX,2011-02-09T20:52Z,Anyone got a crack for the standalone? Works if you set the clock back a few years but still.. Would be nice to live in 2011 and still be able to use it? :)
,afxwinter,2011-02-11T14:52Z,"I've been trying to get this working in AE CS4, what I've noticed is there seems to be a time limit as to how long in a clip it will work for.  Is this because it's not cracked?  Please help!"
,mrpras,2011-02-22T21:27Z,64bit plugin works fine in CS5 (Premiere) but the standalone (which is required for any real proper jobs) doesn't work.. Looking for a crack :0

,ucalien,2011-11-03T06:33Z,"The uploader says these plugins are pre-registered setups, but all presets are blocked in this version, so they are limited. I'm sticking with the previous version v1.0.16 fully functional.  "
,ucalien,2011-11-03T06:34Z,By the way I'm using Sony Vegas 8.
,ucalien,2011-11-03T06:39Z,The torrent of the version v1.0.16 comes with the license patch which unlocks all presets.
