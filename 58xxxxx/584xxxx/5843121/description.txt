"All My Friends Say" is the debut single of American country music artist Luke Bryan. Released in February 2007, the single became Bryan's first chart entry, spending more than thirty weeks on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, where it reached a peak of #5. The single also crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100, reaching a peak of #59.

The song is part of the tracklist for Now That's What I Call Country.

The song is an up-tempo, country-rock song, telling of a man who has just woken up after a night of drinking at a bar, unable to remember what he had been doing in the bar, and unaware of how he arrived home. In an attempt to find out what happened, he asks several of his friends, all of whom tell him that he began drinking heavily upon seeing his former lover with another man.

Regarding the song, Bryan has said: "It's one of those songs that people just seem to relate to when they hear it. It's about waking up in a rocking chair somewhere and wondering what in the heck went on the night before. It's about seeing your ex in a bar with someone new... We've all been there and had those kinds of experiences."

Kevin John Coyne, reviewing the song for Country Universe, gave it a B rating. He said the only problem with the song is the production. He then goes on to say that "it tries a little too hard to show 'attitude', and ends up making Bryanâ€™s vocal sound more timid than it actually is."

"All My Friends Say" debuted at #59 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of February 10, 2007. On the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week of August 18, 2007, the song debuted at #90.
