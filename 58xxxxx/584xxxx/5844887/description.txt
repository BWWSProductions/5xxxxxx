       Trpico de Sangre (English: Tropic of Blood) is a dramatic film    
       based on the true story of the Dominican Republic's historic       
       Mirabal sisters.                                                   
                                                                          
       The film focuses on Minerva Mirabal and tells the true story of    
       how she and her sisters came to represent the greatest threat to   
       dictator Rafael Trujillo and his regime. The Mirabal sisters were  
       in involed in an underground movement against the government.      
       They were assassinated in 1960  by men under the instruction of    
       the Luis Amiama Tio according to Pupo Roman, although their death  
       was made to appear as an automobile accident. Many citizens were   
       outraged and a few months later Trujillo was assassinated by an    
       ambush lead by Antonio de La Maza, who was played by actor Cesar   
       Evora.
