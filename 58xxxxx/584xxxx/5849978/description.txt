Ultimate Desktop Virtualization Product for Windows 7

Run Windows 7 in a virtual machine with the industryâ€™s first support for Windows Aero 3D 

graphics. Easy Install makes installing 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 7 in a virtual 

machine even easier than on your physical PC. VMware Workstation 7 works with Flip 3D and 

Aero Peek to show live thumbnails of your virtual machines. Better than Windows XP Mode, you 

can run Windows XP with 3D graphics, faster performance, and tighter integration with Unity, 

shared folders and drag and drop convenience. VMware Workstation is optimized for maximum 

performance when running on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows 7 PCs.

Best 3D Graphics Just Got Better

VMware Workstation was the first to support 3D graphics in virtualized environments and is 

now the first to support Windows Aero in Windows Vista and Windows 7 virtual machines. Run 

even more 3D applications with support for DirectX 9.0c Shader Model 3 and OpenGL 2.13D 

graphics in Windows virtual machines.

Most Advanced Virtualization Platform

Create virtual machines with up to 4 virtual processors or 4 virtual cores and up to 32GB of 

memory per virtual machine. Driverless printing makes your PC printers automatically 

accessible to your Windows and Linux virtual machinesâ€”no configuration or drivers required. 

Smart card authentication enables you to dedicate a Smart Card reader to a virtual machines 

or share access.

Features Professionals Cannot Live Without

â€¢ Install and run VMware vSphere 4 and VMware ESXi in a virtual machine
â€¢ New IDE integrations for the SpringSource Tools Suite and Eclipse IDE for C/C++
â€¢ Replay debugging is now easier and faster
â€¢ Remote Replay Debugging makes it easier to share virtual machine recordings for analysis

More Refined Than Ever

Protect from Prying Eyes
Protect your virtual machines from prying eyes with 256-bit AES encryption.

Printing that Just Works
Driver-less printing makes your PC printers automatically accessible to your Windows and 

Linux VMsâ€”no configuration or drivers required. Your PCâ€™s default printer even shows up as 

the default, too.

Go Back in Time
Buggy applications, hardware failures, viruses and other malware do not give you fair 

warning to take a manual snapshot. AutoProtect luckily automatically takes snapshots at set 

intervals, protecting you from unexpected bumps in the road, making itâ€™s easy to go back in 

time to when things were good.

Free Up System Resources
Pause a virtual machine to free up CPU resources for use by other running virtual machines 

or demanding applications.

Changes in VMware Workstation 7.1.2 Build 301548 | 23 SEP 2010:
* Added Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 support for Integrated Virtual DebuggerÂ´s live 

debugging mode.
* Many issues with running Windows 7 SP1 Beta, RHEL 6.0 Beta, and Fedora 13 in a virtual 

machine have been addressed. Each of these Operating System versions are still in 

development and have known issues, therefore they are not fully supported.
* NAT networking includes several performance improvements.
* VMware Workstation 7.1.2 has been tested with the new free standalone VMware vCenter
