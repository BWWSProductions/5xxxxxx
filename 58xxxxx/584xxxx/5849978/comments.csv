The data base of TPB isn't update."
,supanut2000,2010-10-03T02:12Z,Also when upgrading v7.1.1 to v7.1.2 it fails in the first phase of upgrade - the part where v7.1.1 is being uninstalled I get the error 'the MSI fails' and it will never upgrade! HELP! HELP! HELP!
,supanut2000,2010-10-24T09:30Z,"At least some seeders now.
Downloading now.
But how can I upgrade it? The same error ""the msi fail"" will appear and I can't fix it."
