Really?


I grew up in Hawaii and watched the original every week.

Is this shit serious?  I have to watch this!

Next thing you know, there'll be a Magnum PI redux, as well.

Though, honestly, H50 is more realistic.  That is the early 70's shit I remember."

But all of us military brats were educated by japanese, philipino, somoan, chinese and korean teachers.

Hawaii is the only true melting pot.  Conus America only imagines that it is a melting pot."
