,macho570,2010-09-20T20:49Z,Why did u change torrent?
,macho570,2010-09-20T20:56Z,"seed pls, stuck at 73%"
,Bit-Step,2010-09-20T21:29Z,"Because u said it was slow yourself, it had been 1day and only 2 seeders were on torrent? (seemed not right) so i re-created it! 

i figured i done something wrong with the tracker or something? i am a noob @ creating torrents! 




"
,Bit-Step,2010-09-20T21:48Z,"Welll you said it was going really slow and 4 some reason it only had 2 seeders (well thats what it said on my pc?) so i figured i mears welll start again and i probably done something wrong wityh the tracker??? 

Sorry i am a noob @ creating torrentz

,gshuck420,2010-09-23T07:31Z,"been seeding since the 19th uploaded 13.9gb's now stuck with 126mb's left to go, and been stuck @ 91.0% for 2 straight days. Has anyone finished getting it? all other bit-step uploads have been quik and problem free."
,flmejikano,2010-09-23T14:04Z,"I downloaded the whole torrent the day it showed up. No issues. I am now re-seeding so hopefully if you had issues, my torrent file is whole."
,Bit-Step,2010-09-23T17:18Z,"Well there was an issue with the tracker (lke i mentioned) but that has been fixed now!

gshuck420 is your bit-torrent client configured properly??? (i have 48 seeders on my torrent lappy) soo it might be a prob your end, i hope it gets sorted :D "
,gshuck420,2010-09-24T01:28Z,all my settings say they are correect using bit-torrent. I never had any other issues with bit-steps uploads. i think I going to delete torrent and start from scratch and see if that helps. 21(30) peers and now up to 90.3% but only getting 0.1kbps download.
,gshuck420,2010-09-24T02:09Z,well deleteing torrent n files seems to have dun the trick. 100% complete in less than 30 mins. Thanx once again Bit-Step
,Bit-Step,2010-09-24T15:24Z,Glad to hear it gshuck ;) seed seed seed and b4 u know part 5 will b upon your ipod's and decks :D
