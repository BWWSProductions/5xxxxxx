I love country music that involves Summer Time and haven't really found many compilation albums that have everything I'd like on them so I compiled one here. Most of these are recent songs that give you that summer feel and a few that I just really like. Here's what's on this compilation:

American Saturday Night - Brad Paisley
Little White Church - Little Big Town
Party Wrecker - Jed's Dead
Save A Horse (Ride A Cowboy) - Big & Rich
Redneck Yacht Club - Craig Morgan
White Liar - Miranda Lambert
Water - Brad Paisley
She's Country - Jason Aldean
Hallelujah - Lee DeWyze
Country Man - Luke Bryan
Cowboy Casanova - Carrie Underwood
Here Comes Summer - LoCash Cowboys
Something Like That - Tim McGraw
All Over Me - Josh Turner
Love Story - Taylor Swift
Summertime - Kenny Chesney

Enjoy!
