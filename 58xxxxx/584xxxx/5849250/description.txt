    The climax to the BBC Natural History Unit's wildlife      
    adventure series searching for tigers in the Himalayas.   
                                                             
    Following extraordinary rumours of tigers living in the   
    mountains of Bhutan, the expedition shifts to high         
    altitude. Cameraman Gordon Buchanan captures remarkable   
    footage of a snow leopard cub from over 5,000 metres in  
    the air.                                                  
                                                               
    Along the Tibetan border, explorer Steve Backshall        
    treks to the mystical Tiger Mountain. Helped by a        
    remote tribe, he has a very close encounter with the      
    world's most elusive predator.                             
                                                              
    The plight of the endangered tiger brings biologist Dr   
    George McGavin to tears, and the team present their       
    findings to the Bhutanese Prime Minister. As the           
    expedition culminates, Gordon makes the discovery of a    
    lifetime.
