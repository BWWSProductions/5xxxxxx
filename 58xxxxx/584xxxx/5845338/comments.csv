,lordmad,2010-09-22T17:04Z,Any feedback if A and V is good? 
,brdunman,2010-09-22T17:28Z,"Downloading now, will comment upon completion, scan, and audio/visual check."
,brdunman,2010-09-22T17:36Z,"Uploaded by anonymous, I think I've changed my mind. No notes, No Uploader, and still a TS? Will finish, but DEFINITE scan first."
,Drica0,2010-09-22T17:52Z,"A: 4
V: 3"
,brdunman,2010-09-22T19:01Z,"Swedish Subs are Hardcoded (expected, but still a dissapointment)

Scanned Clean for Virus and Malware (Always weary with anonymous uploaders, IDK why??)

Audio: 3
Video: 2.5?

C'mon R5s, DVD Rips, or even an old screener would be better at this point. 

Still, thanks to the uploader, we appreciate any free films, I suppose I am just bieng picky. 

Long live TPB"
,Volkerball,2010-09-22T20:27Z,"How is the Audio/Video?

Think i will wait for the dvdrip anyhow.

Long live The Pirate Bay!"
,damon88,2010-09-23T16:40Z,"Whats the point in uploading same torrents over and over again . 

Come on guys save your time doing something useful than uploading bogus torrents.

Thanks Anyways lol."
,bubach,2010-09-25T00:11Z,"@damon88

I'm sorry but your opinon doesn't count, becasue you must be a retard.  This isn't the same as any other torrent, it's the first TS with swesub.  But I'm guessing that you are one of those idiots that doesn't know what a TS is and downloads everything in search of a DVDrip even though one wont be out until atleast dec/jan when the planned release of it is."
,damon88,2010-09-27T06:09Z,"@bubach

Look im not really into using abusive language against others, but think twice before you call someone retard.

and i know TS = tele sync

Grow up man, and stop thinking everyone is like you.

,Mr_Cru,2010-09-27T20:07Z,"@brdunman: Thank you for your informative and non-abusive comments. Really nice to see someone who can write negative comments without resorting to derogatory remarks and name calling.

Much appreciated.

And yes:

Long Live TPB "

,gana111,2010-10-03T18:49Z,"Quality is bad! 
I made mistake to download it."
,Inpachi,2010-10-04T15:59Z,"Sigh.... This same copy again... 

Meh... Ill just wait another 2 or 3 months...

I mean really this is still the BEST copy available?

I mean i just watched Predators which came out around the same time(I think...) it came out this year i am sure about that!

And it is WAYYY better quality than this... Its almost DVD quality!

Come on someone release a R5 or something!

The DVD wont be released til December maybe January 2011... We wont be seeing a DVDRip for QUITE SOME TIME! 

This movie is too good and popular not to have  decent copy out by now! "
,Inpachi,2010-10-04T16:05Z,"Oh if you wanna see how bad the quality of this film is heres a streaming of it.

,bubach,2010-10-09T03:23Z,"Do you really expect any other quality?  I mean FFS, I added swesub to an existing release, anybody with half a brain should realize that it can't have better quality then the original english relases. Sigh.."
,TimL86,2010-10-13T05:06Z,hmm thanks for the movie
