Acclaimed historian and New York Times best-selling author Nathaniel Philbrick 
has earned a National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize nomination for his 
extraordinary works. Here he carries readers back to the 1876 battle in Montana 
mythologized as "Custerâ€™s Last Stand." Focusing on the charismatic Sitting Bull 
and the recklessly brave George Armstrong Custer, Philbrick constructs a 
riveting narrative of the battle that became the archetypal story of the West.


From NathanielPhilbrick.com:

Little Bighorn and Custer are names synonymous in the American imagination with 
unmatched bravery and spectacular defeat. Mythologized as Custerâ€™s Last Stand, 
the June 1876 battle has been equated with other famous last stands, from the 
Spartansâ€™ defeat at Thermopylae to Davy Crockett at the Alamo.

In his tightly structured narrative, Nathaniel Philbrick brilliantly sketches 
the two larger-than-life antagonists: Sitting Bull, whose charisma and political 
savvy earned him the position of leader of the Plains Indians, and George 
Armstrong Custer, one of the Unionâ€™s greatest cavalry officers and a man with a 
reputation for fearless and often reckless courage. Philbrick reminds readers 
that the Battle of the Little Bighorn was also, even in victory, the last stand 
for the Sioux and Cheyenne Indian nations. Increasingly outraged by the 
governmentâ€™s Indian policies, the Plains tribes allied themselves and held their 
ground in southern Montana. Within a few years of Little Bighorn, however, all 
the major tribal leaders would be confined to Indian reservations.

Throughout, Philbrick beautifully evokes the history and geography of the Great 
Plains with his characteristic grace and sense of drama. The Last Stand is a 
mesmerizing account of the archetypal story of the American West, one that 
continues to haunt our collective imagination.
