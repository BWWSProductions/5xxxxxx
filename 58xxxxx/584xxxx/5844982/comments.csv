,Lixifer,2010-09-22T11:31Z,400 leechers that cant connect to a single seeder.  The one seeder that was present before didnt permit uploading.  As it stands there is 400 leechers stuck on ~40 %.  This exact problem has happened a few times on TvTeams torrents.  Would be interested to know why no one has finished downloading still 5.5 hours later.  :S
