,lovemylife,2010-09-24T17:12Z,"I'll just write some solutions to problems I've encountered while installing this torrent:

1. THE INSTALLER ASKS FOR DISC 2:

Just copy and paste all of the content  of the DVD-2-Folder (except for the SKIDROW-Folder) to the DVD-1-Folder.

2. THE INSTALLER LOOPS THE C++ AND DIRECT-X-INSTALLERS:

I just exited the installer of Skidrow (by pressing the red X in the top right) and copied the content of the SKIDROW-folder (located in the DVD-2-folder) to my installing location of Darksiders. 
In this case: Computer>C:>Program Files>Darksiders. 
I replaced the files and merged the media stuff. After that I could start the game normally (the loop disappeared after restart).

I hoped this helps some people."

1.extract the iso files with winrar

2.mount dvd 1 with deamon tools

3.it should autorun istaller.exe if not go to computer and run it your self

4.change install path and languidge IF U PREFERE

5.click install

6.wen it asks for dvd 2 mount dvd 2 with deamon tools IN THE SAME DRIVE meaning if u mount dvd1 in L u got to mount dvd 2 in L

7. wen it asks to install direct x and c++ DO IT its the lastest game so its the latest version so dont worrie about versions

8.dont know if its normal but after c++ my installer crashed

9.go to dvd 2 and copy all content from the skidrow folder to your darksiders folder (default c:/programfiles/darksiders)

10.run darksidersPC.exe

it should work fine

make shure that wen u copy all the content from the skidrow folder u keep pressing yes all the time"

I have had that prob before and normaly you can find a cfg. file or something to change the start resolution of the game but not in this case.

,word304,2010-09-28T08:00Z,"I'm having controller problems with 
using a Logitech Dual Action controller + using Xbox360 emulator.
(Sorry for length of post since fair amount is specific to my setup. Others seem to be having similar problems, so I thought it might help)

I managed to get my buttons mapped & working properly (done either through remapping the buttons with Logitech Game Profiler or by editing the values in x360ce.ini/.exe - not both simultaneously of course).

What I can't get working properly (no matter what I try) is the right Thumbstick Y-axis (which controls the camera view in game).
I'm constantly stuck with a top-down view of the characters head and can't change it.  It will circle around the character when pressing Left/Right (thus assuming the thumbstick X-axis works properly), but thumpstick Up/Down does nothing and I have no idea what to change it to.

It seems Darksiders stores it's own controller info automatically in a file called ""controls.dcon"" which is found in the hidden user directory (Windows Vista 32 bit):
""C:\Users\*username*\AppData\Local\Darksiders"" - 
I have no idea what (if any) program can properly open this file for editing - I've tried Notepad, MS WORD, an NFO viewer program, web-browsers, even PAINT - all unusable.

ANY HELP from here getting it to work would be appreciated.
Maybe it's as simple as changing/editing the Right Thumbstick axis value to something else? either by changing value using x360ce.exe or by manually editing x360ce.ini file

For my Logitech Dual Action controller, ALL other games work properly with the Right Thumbstick configurations:

xboxce.exe:
Stick Axis X -        Axis 3
Stick Axis Y -        IAxis 6

xboxce.ini:
Right Analog X=3
Right Analog Y=-6

Heres POSSIBLE fix for installer problems - Anything installed/executed needs to be ""Run as administrator""

1, Download + install Valve's official STEAM client - it's free. Can get it at store()steampowered()com 
2, Create a free STEAM account - req valid email.
3, Run the client, log into ur accont, and leave it running in background
4, Follow install instructions as listed in description.
5, Terminate client (but do NOT uninstall) and run DarksidersPC exe file from the game dir. Game should run now.

Assuming u have VISTA, your problem might be a needed windows service that's disabled or not active.
You might want to try this: DL + install a prog called 'Vista Services Optimizer' (google it) - click auto tuneup, select restore default Windws config (save current settings before if u want to)
Reboot your comp then try it again and see if it fixed your problems. 
If default service settings slow windows down, loading saved settings (with a reboot) or using a previous System Restore point will void changing settings to default."

On of my prev comments (top of comment page #6) will solve your problem.
I can see how it could easily be overlooked and that I could have phrased better. So...

Players with the ""problem with right Thumbstick Y-axis"", which is the same thing as
>game not recognizing pressing up/down on the right thumbstick of controllers 
>in-game camera view is not panning up or down
>game only rotates while looking at characters head.
Here's how to FIX it, you need 2 things:
a)most recent xbox360 emulator 
b)updated C++ redistributable package.
DL links to both are at: http://code.google.com/p/x360ce/wiki/MainPage"
,word304,2010-10-02T13:40Z,"(cont'd from prev comment)

A few add'l notes:
** Click on ""downloads"" at top of page for link to emulator.
** Once downloaded, the emulator MUST be run from the game's install directory.
** Some game profiler programs must be shut down before running the game for certain controllers to work.  I had to turn off Logitech Game Profiler to get my Logitech Dual Action controller to work."
,word304,2010-10-02T13:44Z,"@caelas19

Did you copy the content from the crack folder to your game directory? 
(I don't think you did since doing so makes it where it doesn't ask for a validation code)."
,word304,2010-10-02T14:02Z,"@piromandule

Assuming you used the Skidrow installer + properly the copied content from crack folder to game directory, it should be easy to fix your problem -> your shortcut is referencing the wrong exe file.
>Delete your current desktop shortcut
>Explore to game directory and find file DarksidersPC.exe (note the spelling difference from Darksiders.exe). This is the proper file to run the game.
>To avoid opening game directory every time, right click DarksidersPC.exe + select ""Send To"" then select ""Desktop"" which will create a new shortcut for you. (P.S. You can rename the shortcut to whatever u want.)

If that doesn't work, instead of D:/PC GAMES/.... 
Try moving everything to the game's default install directory which is C:\Program Files\Darksiders\ then try to run the game.
Good luck!"

Wait a sec, your comment is confusing as hell.
""mounted the image and installed it"" - so you used the skidrow installer then?
""i went to the folder but there's no exe file to run the game from..."" - specify which folder you're talking about.
""i tried the installer in th folder itself"" - once again specify! DVD folder in mounted iso? Game default install directory? Some other folder? What?
Did you, like the instructions said to, copy content from Skidrow folder (on iso #2) to the game directory?"

Only other suggestion I can come up with is to put this dll file in install directory and see if it works: 
http://www.tocaedit.com/IB/index.php?automodule=downloads&showfile=45
Note: this contains 3 different versions of the same dll file. Don't bother trying the WIDECHAR version unless you use asian characters font in Windows. 
""Blocker"" version blocks the game from seeing any controller input except from the emulator. 
""Spoofer"" version makes any controller have the name ""XBOX 360 Controller for Windows"" -some games don't work otherwise.

Just as confirmation:
-You did extract and run the emulator from game directory and it displayed the correct buttons when pushed on controller?
-You weren't running any game profiler programs or any software that came with your controller when you launched the game?

,Deevees,2010-10-05T08:39Z,"I've beaten the game, so it works fine, I had problems when I first installed it, so here is a guide that will help you.

1. Make a folder on your desktop or something and name it Darksiders Install or something

2. Mount the Disk1 ISO with Daemon Tools

3. Open windows explorer, open the virtual drive (will be where your regular CD rom drive is, along with C drive etc etc), so right click it, then click Open

4. Copy all the contents from there to that folder we made earlier, should take around 5mins to copy it all considering it's like almost 8gb

5. When you've done that, unmount Disk1, then mount Disk2 ISO with Daemon Tools in the same drive

6. Open it again using windows exporer etc etc, copy all the files EXCEPT the SKIDROW folder, and paste them into that same folder we made in step 1

7. When that is done, close anything that's open that is related to Darksiders (ie. the Skidrow installer and stuff like that.)

8. Open the folder again we made in step 1, then run the installer.exe then click install

9. When the game is installed go back to windows explorer and open Disk2 again to see all the files, open the SKIDROW folder and copy everything there to the Darksiders folder whereever you installed it to, NOT the folder we made in step 1. So if you installed the game to C:/Program Files/Darksiders you'd copy it to there (for example)

I'm not sure if I missed anything but that's pretty much what I did to get it working. When I did it regularly like mounting disk 1, installing, then when it asks for disk2 i'd have to unmount disk1 and then mount disk2 blah blah, none of that worked and the install folder would only turn out to be like 9gb after it was done so yeah, this is what worked for me. Hope it worked for you guys too."

For the people having the crashing problem at the horse. its a problem that has been happening to legit owners of the game too. try the vertical sync, resolution change. and Move the ""videos"" folder from the darksiders directory. worked for me "

,digglerd,2010-12-07T01:11Z,"Hey guys, game works Great, Installed perfect, no lag on cutscenes or anything, it's actually flawless, but i run a Phenom II x6 rig at 4.2 Ghz with HD 5770 and 8 gigs of ram at some salty timings.  Only problem i'm having right now is pretty much right after the first time you encounter the griever,  there is an area right after that were you drop down and there is water, you have to light the fumes with the crossblade.  In this area there are inert bombs, that you have to throw at the red crystal, then go all the way around and set it to blow the door. Well.  The problem i'm having is that i can sufficiently aim the inert bombs from the middle platform, but it will not let me throw one at the crystal when aiming high.  i can aim as high as i can possibly aim, yet the bombs always go to the same level in the play area, pretty much right underneath the platform with the red crystal.  It's like that wherever you throw them too, any way.  you cant adjust the height - up or down even though you point higher or lower.  Any one run into this or know a stitch to fix it? kinda stuck if i cant blow the crystal since i have not gotten the guantlets to destroy these things."
