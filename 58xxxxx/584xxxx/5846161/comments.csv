,SpitvenoM,2010-09-23T00:06Z,100% real thanks for this man +1
,lordsyrinex,2010-09-23T03:11Z,"Sorry, but this torrent has the same problems as all of the other copies floating around here.  Track 2 is listed as ""Born Treacherous"", however, if you listen to the track they have by that name on their Myspace page, you can clearly hear that they are two different songs and the track times are completely different.  I can't find any songs that are similar to the one on their Myspace page.  I would love to have this be the true new Dimmu album, but I have a feeling it isn't.  Also, if you do a quick Google search for the official track listing, you see that none of the times line up properly either.

Either it's a massive hoax previously, or this isn't their new album."
,Zathriquez,2010-09-23T08:09Z,The real thing alright. Thanks alot mate!!!
,kerrycherry,2010-09-23T08:12Z,"It could be Ov Hell's The Underground Regime, with Gateways replaced as normally. I can't download it so I can't check the track times."
,Cubey666,2010-09-23T10:21Z,"hmmmz, just downloaded it...
it does sounds like dimmu.

@lordsyrinex: Track 2 ""Born Treacherous"" are both on their myspace, as in the torrent the same song, and both are 5:02 in lenght. And a quick google search gives the same tracklisting...

just check out the torrent and wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahadabra_(album)

,AMCope,2010-09-23T13:03Z,"Leaked Dimmu? Impossible, improbable."
,lordsyrinex,2010-09-24T02:00Z,"From the Wiki:

1.	""Xibir""  	2:50
2.	""Born Treacherous""  	5:02
3.	""Gateways""  	5:10
4.	""Chess with the Abyss""  	4:08
5.	""Dimmu Borgir""  	5:35
6.	""Ritualist""  	5:13
7.	""The Demiurge Molecule""  	5:29
8.	""A Jewel Traced Through Coal""  	5:16
9.	""Renewal""  	4:11
10.	""Endings and Continuations""  	5:58

From this torrent:

1.	""Xibir""  	1:02
2.	""Born Treacherous""  	8:14
3.	""Gateways""  	4:59
4.	""Chess with the Abyss""  	6:50
5.	""Dimmu Borgir""  	4:04
6.	""Ritualist""  	6:03
7.	""The Demiurge Molecule""  	5:12
8.	""A Jewel Traced Through Coal""  	5:03
9.	""Renewal""  	5:55
10.	""Endings and Continuations""  	6:28

Gateways cuts off at the end just like the copies that are floating around elsewhere.  It doesn't look to be Ov Hell's CD either as the track times don't line up with that either.

@Cubey666:  Not sure how you can say that ""Born Treacherous"" is in this torrent because I've listened to every track that's in here and it's not there."
,lordsyrinex,2010-09-24T02:13Z,"Oh, and if you still don't believe me, they are streaming the entire album on their Myspace page right now and you can hear for yourself.  Whatever this album is, it's a good black metal album, but it's not the new Dimmu"
,simoncuynen,2010-09-24T07:16Z,"@lordsyrinex: The album on myspace from dimmu borgir is exactly the same as this torrent, and the track times does line up"
,ISCAMania,2010-09-24T08:02Z,"Last time you placed Abrahadabra it was fake. This time it is the real deal and I want to thank you very much for this! I was waiting for this album to be released for quite some time now, so I'm happy that it's finally on my HDD now. :)"
,alrinach,2010-09-24T09:36Z,"It is the real SHIT.
I ve been listening to DB since the beginning. I know Shagraths Voice. specially new cold voice. "
,andy96norway_xD,2010-09-24T16:58Z,Thanks man :D
,Mork_Blasphemy,2010-09-25T02:44Z,In my release the musicscheck the times that lordsyrinex is saying thats on wiki!!
,Mork_Blasphemy,2010-09-25T02:49Z,On my release the time shows as lordsyrinex is saying show up on wiki!!
,LMNPRTY,2010-09-26T01:18Z,"@AMCope, no it's not leaked, it was release in Finland and Sweden on the 22nd.

I guess lordsyrinex didn't bother to even download the torrent before he commented. He's talking about the other ""abrahadabra's"" which are really The Eternal Suffering's new album."
,lordsyrinex,2010-09-30T04:46Z,"Unless this torrent was replaced with different files, when I originally downloaded it, it was not the proper files.  This appears to be correct now or it pointed me to the wrong tracker when I hit download.  Either way, it's a good album.

@LMNPRTY:  I don't just go around posting comments for shits and giggles.  Being a huge Dimmu fan, I downloaded this, didn't get Dimmu and wanted to keep other people from thinking it was the proper release."
,Goodquality2012,2012-03-27T11:18Z,Not sure what everyone is on about. This is awesome. Great sound. perfect quality imo. Its as real as it comes. Thank you very much for an awesome upload. Kudos.
