"No Good Deed"  

Adam (Peter Krause) offers an internship 
position to Sarah (Lauren Graham) at T&S 
Footwear. Meanwhile, Kristina (Monica Potter) 
helps Suze Lessing (guest star Amanda Foreman) 
through her divorce by babysitting Noel (guest 
star Nicholas Lobue). Julia (Erika Christensen) 
commits to a play date for Sydney (Savannah 
Paige Rae) that threatens her other 
friendships. Elsewhere, Jasmine (Joy Bryant) 
and Crosby (Dax Shepard) debate where Jabbar 
(Tyree Brown) should live when Jasmine takes a 
new job.

Enjoy :)
