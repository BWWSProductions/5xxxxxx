================================================================

This is my very first official rip. And a difficult one at that: both video and audio of the original DVD sucked. The dialog was out of sync and practically inaudible, so it took a lot of tweaking and adjusting.

Feedback - advice, suggestions on how to improve my rips - would be much appreciated!

I have a relatively slow internet connection, so please be patient. I promise I'll stay online and seed as long as needed.

Enjoy, and please, stay and seed for a while!
