,melikex01,2010-11-04T16:07Z,"hey - its 11/4/10
currently i'm downloading from 20 of 23 peers.
there was ONE seeder, but they dropped off.
please seed! we need the seed!

thank you."
,melikex01,2010-11-19T18:20Z,"i just wanted to say that when i started downloading there were only 18 people, even as peers.
Now I count 51 hahaha!

i guess i'm not the only one who saw season 3 featured on hulu and then got nostalgic :-)

you take the good you take the bad you take them both and there you have the facts of life...the facts of life!

,89jdahl,2011-03-01T21:08Z,OK im new to this how do i seed can some one email how thank you 
,primalclaws1974,2011-05-14T00:47Z,"Might as well not even starts this folks. without at least one seeder u will never get it all. I have attempted other downloads, hoping to get ""most of it"", and its usually a bit of EACH freaking file thats missing, so u get damn near NOTHING besides a week of wasted time."
