[T],captim,2010-09-25T09:43Z,thanks mate. but currently i'm not still sure if i should continue uploading each episode. now there are other guys doing my job (like Segelboy) and they are doing it right...
,wtfisdrank,2010-10-02T18:40Z,I went through the painful process of signing up just to say... dont stop uploading!!! you're the only one im able to rely on for the latest update on a state of trance >.<    there are others but they are too lazy to separate the tracks. keep doing what you're doing! =D
