Thanks for the Frank Mills.  First time I've heard this cd.

What is the difference between MBD #1 and #12?

Thanks,

BT"
,T-Wolf,2010-09-27T17:58Z,"Hi BT:
  To be truthful, I haven't the foggiest idea.  I wasn't going to include the second track of MBD, but I hate it when music is available for download and tracks are missing, so for the sake of everything in its entirety, I left it there.    
  If it means anything, I believe the second MBD track (#12) is digitally 1 second longer.  Maybe one is the original while the other was reproduced for the CD release.  Your guess is as good as mine.
  I am glad you appreciate the music, just the same.

Woof!"
