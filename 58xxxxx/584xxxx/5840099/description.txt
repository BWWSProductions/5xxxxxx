Encoders note: 
Here goes 1080p version of this movie with the high bitrate AAC

I have changed the naming of the release to promote the new method of encoding:
EBDRIP - Enhanced Bluray Disk Rip with quality set to be better than Bluray 
itself(without guarranty we actually did it ;-). If you want to know why we can say that
take a look here:

Regards to all encoders especially Big thanx to Atom, FLAWL3SS and FraMeSToR crew, my friends Filix,
Rok3r, Kempas and all who likes my work.

1. UNFINISHED/SAMPLE movies HAVE synchro problems. This is the nature of highly
compressed content. Also there seems to be a problem with Haali Media
Splitter. If you are using Media Player Classic, please make sure you have
enabled INTERNAL FILTER for MP4.
2. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you have actually seen it. If you LIKED this
release - tell others about it. If you didnt,  leave a comment saying  why, so I can learn from your opinions and provide you with something better in the future .
3. I can confirm that XBox360 will play it through WINDOWS media center extender.

4. On the beginning of the scene, the innovators ruled it. They came and show what they were capable of
and other people were amazed by their achievements. Now it seems the only important thing on the scene
is speed and contacts. You might be poor creator, but if you have fast connection and contacts you rule.
It seems for me that the true heritage of the first scene - innovation is now a part of p2p scene. Why? 
Because official scene rules does not allow it. Funny eh, but its not my problemm as long as i can show
you my achievements. Enjoy...
5. If you like the movie, show your gratitude to the creators by going to cinema or buying
Bluray/DVD !
6. These movies can be directly streamed through WWW using Adobe Flash Player
version 9 or higher.
7. The name FASM was derived from assembler efficiency. When you write something
directly in assembler,  it usually runs much faster and has smaller size,
than the same thing written in C, Java etc. It also means FAchman SoofMan
- founders of FASM 
8. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is  h264 compression method
optimized directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved,  each revision brings quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard
x264 encoding is explained by the same reasons as  XVID encodes are better than
DIVX3.
9. FASM recommends IMGBURN for burning those files into DVD.
10.Any subtitles made for different releases, but taken from the same source
(Bluray Rip) should also work with this release.
11. FASM 720p releases will concentrate more on size to keep it as low as possible 
(including true HD quality of the video with some minor artifacts) and special STEREO
sound to allow play these directly on most devices possible (even on newer cellphones.)
12. FASM 1080p releases will concentrate more on quality, but the size will be low enough and will contain
AAC5.1 sound encoded to highest possible level. The goal would be to create eBDRip with quality better than Bluray original itself.
