,Da-Banga,2010-09-21T08:12Z,"hang on a sec bloke...give it some time 'til people finish downloading....i hope it's not a stooge or 7.3gb will go down the hatch.

but fuck the speed is slow im maxing out between 50-70kpbs"
,TheTriib4l,2010-09-21T08:14Z,god its so slow
,TheTriib4l,2010-09-21T08:15Z,i started out at 150kb/s but the people who finished downloading just left i hate hit and runners
,HCity,2010-09-21T08:54Z,"Speed was really great for most of the torrent.  between 600kb/s and 1.2mb/s. 

Password works fine, but Half way through un-rarring though and I got a bad encryption message.  Anyone else having this problem?

Can SOSteam verify that this rar will actually work?"
,HCity,2010-09-21T10:30Z,"Tried 3 different burns, 3 different unrars, all broken.  Torrent is BAD.  Can anyone confirm?"
,HaWeR_bmw,2010-09-21T12:15Z,"Is it true that the torrent is BAD ?? like wrote the HCity?, becouse i am downloading it for 6 hours, and minimum next 6 hour is before me.
Is it true or the HCity makes Jokes?"
,Bramsko,2010-09-21T15:53Z,no problem here with unrarring or burning. keep it up sosteam!
