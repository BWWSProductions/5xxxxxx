,iamcims,2010-10-09T06:13Z,"This is a real review.

I find it funny how low people will go to deter people from torrents. People like ""stintio"". They purposely write some stupid immature comment to try to make us think the torrent is not real. Anyone with common sense can tell if it is fake or not, but people generally take others comments to thought. I don't know if it is the MPA doing this, or the studios, or what. I am almost sure it is.

Anyway, this is real, great quality. The audio however is not perfect. Sadly.

V:10
A:8

The audio has many spikes in it, making a pop noise, it's pretty constant during the entire film. It isn't that noticeable but since the volume is somewhat low, you have to crank it up and you can hear it. It seems to come and go, and isn't that bad. I still think its a good rip, just a shame the audio was not encoded correctly."
,iamcims,2010-10-09T07:12Z,P.S. This movie is terrible.
,dsgjsd2,2010-10-09T22:13Z,I do like the concept of killer friendly wamps and not DOA as usuall.
