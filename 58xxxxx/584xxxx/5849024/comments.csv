,PhilLesh12,2010-09-24T08:03Z,"No it's real.  TvTeam's torrents are all real.

They tend to have issues with seeding, however.

This one is not being seeded at all, at the moment."
,bufster,2010-09-24T09:02Z,"I had problems with this initially, it may get better seeding wise, but this one is seeding good (its RAR'd though): http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5849108/Jersey.Shore.S02E09.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF"
