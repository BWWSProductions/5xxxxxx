"Anthropology 101"

As classes resume at Greendale Community College 
for the fall, the "Community" study group 
gathers to tackle this year's big class, 
"Anthropology 101. " Television icon and 
multiple Emmy Award-winner Betty White ("The 
Golden Girls") guest stars as the esteemed, but 
slightly unhinged anthropology professor, June 
Bauer. Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), struggles to 
establish decorum with Britta (Gillian Jacobs) 
and Annie (Alison Brie) amidst the confusion 
that ensued at the season finale's "Transfer 
Dance," when Britta professed her love for Jeff 
and Jeff later shared a secret kiss with Annie. 
Meanwhile, Senor Chang (Ken Jeong) decides to 
enroll as a student at Greendale Community 
College so that he too, can join the study 
group.

Enjoy :)
