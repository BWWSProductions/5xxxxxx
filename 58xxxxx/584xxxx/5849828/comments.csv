,ThePirateBay,2010-09-24T19:58Z,"And never mind the seeder/leecher stats, it's being seeded. It's just the trackers that are having a hard time. Just keep the torrent running and you'll find some peers by DHT and Peer exchange. We hope you like it, we sure do!"
,punk420,2010-09-24T20:05Z,why tpb chose to upload torrentz of their own....??
[V],olofolleola4,2010-09-24T20:12Z,"This is great!
I will download it now and seed it through my three seedboxes! :D
I will also upload it on some other file-sharing sites/protocol.
Once again, seems like great release!"
