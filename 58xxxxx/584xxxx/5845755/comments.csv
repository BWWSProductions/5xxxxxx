Halo was first launched 10 years ago in 2001 and since then has been one of the top selling First Person Shooter games. Halo: Reach is latest and concluding part of the Halo series. Although the general trend is to publish Sequels to successful games â€“ Halo Reach is a prequel to the Halo Series. Halo: Reach includes some of the best gameplay you are likely to encounter this year and takes the series to the next level.I loved this game and like me many others did too, so hereâ€™s a Windows 7 Halo Reach Theme for the fans. The theme consists of 25+ Hi-Res Halo Reach Wallpapers, Custom Halo Icons and Sounds from the Halo Reach Game.

Reach is the last Halo title that Bungie will be developing, as the Microsoft-owned studio 343 Industries will take over development for all future games in the series. Bungie is now joining up with Activision (creators of Modern Warfare, Guitar Hero), to develop new games. Exiting times ahead I bet."
