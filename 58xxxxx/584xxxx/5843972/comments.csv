Can I suggest that you do your homework before you come to The Pirate Bay to abuse people and make yourself look like a fool?

I quote from THIS torrent's description:
Format.......: HD 1080p Bluray / AVCHD
Video.........: 1920x1080 / x264 / 4572kbps

An AVCHD encoded 1080p or 720p movie needs to be in full screen resolution (1920x1080/1280x720 respectively), otherwise the movie's 16:9 aspect ratio will be thrown out when played on an AVCHD compatible, Blu-ray or DVD-HD player from a DVD5 disk, hence the letterbox bars have been added.

As it happens, the movie's ac3 audio at 640kbps accounts for around 650Mb.

Just put your hand in your pocket and go and buy the Blu-ray disk, perhaps you will be happy then :o)
