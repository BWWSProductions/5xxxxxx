Today, big parts of healthcare reform kick inâ€¦ and Republicans announced their plans to kick it to death.

On the positive side, many of the provisions of President Obamaâ€™s healthcare reform begin today. After today, a lot of the pre-existing conditions in the healthcare system itself will cease to exist. Starting now, insurance companies will no longer be allowed to exclude children because of pre-existing health conditions. Using the term â€œpre-existing conditionâ€ about a young child is tantamount to saying they were just born wrong. After today insurers can no longer impose lifetime limits on coverage. That should extend a few lifetimesâ€¦ but then I guess thatâ€™s basically what health insurers were afraid of in the first place. Also, now kids can stay on their parentsâ€™ policies up to age 26, which makes a lot of sense. With the way the economy is, most people under 30 are still living with their parents anyway. And now insurers canâ€™t drop you after you get sick if they can find a technical mistake on your application. So if you have a problem with your colon, you canâ€™t be dropped because of a misplaced semi-colon on your application. Speaking of which, now preventive procedures, like colonoscopies, mammograms and immunizations must be covered without co-paymentsâ€”because the only thing worse than having your breasts mashed into tortillas is being charged to have it done. Free colonoscopies are good news, too. Now you canâ€™t be charged for having a camera put up your butt, provided of course, that itâ€™s being done by a doctor.

Which reminds me of what Republicans want to do to you. Today the Republicans unveiled their â€œPledge to America.â€ Itâ€™s 21 pages long. Does it really take that long to say â€œdestroy the middle classâ€? This plan doesnâ€™t move America forward, it divvies America up between the rich. â€œThe Pledge to America!â€ At least theyâ€™re smart enough not to use the term â€œcontractâ€ any more. Too many mob jokes last time. But is â€œpledgeâ€ the best term to use when your plan is being introduced by John Boehner? When I think John Boehner and pledge, I think Lemon Pledgeâ€”brings out woodâ€™s natural shine! Well, the plan was unveiled today by Boehner at a lumber company in Virginia! Honestly. John, we told you never to pose in front of wood! Your complexion makes you blend right in. A lumber company? Perfect. I canâ€™t think of a better place to present a bunch of dead wood.
