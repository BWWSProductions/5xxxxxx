* Darksiders is a single-player action adventure in which the player takes control of the protagonist, War. In third-person perspective, the player engages in combat, puzzles and exploration. The world is divided into separate locations with many areas at first initially inaccessible until War regains many of his lost weapons and abilities. The center of the world, The Scalding Gallow, acts as a hub where War is given new objectives and paths to further unlock new areas. Each contains a series of linear and non-linear paths, many of which require large sections of platforming, climbing and swimming along environment-based puzzles that impair progress that require the use of newly-gained abilities. He fights mainly against Angels and demons, and has a unique way to kill each particular type of enemy, usually tearing them apart painfully. 
War, riding his steed, Ruin.Although War is initially limited to the use of War's two-handed sword, Chaoseater, he will obtain other weapons through the course of gameplay. Also, each weapon has different combinations of attack that can be obtained throughout the game. Along with combos,players are also encouraged to use countering moves, blocks and swift dodging that help against different enemies.
