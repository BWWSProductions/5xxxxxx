,dal2k,2010-09-23T22:03Z,"Thanks Globe,

I'm just wondering why you use .arc , is it better for compression?"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-23T22:32Z,"To dal2k : for the way that i usually work the files the arc in 90% of the cases can maintain a few percent better compression than 7zip with a few exceptions for some type of files and in the main structure using the FREEARC is the some style as the 7zZIP , what i mean is for you make extractions with the 7zip you need to install the 7zip and with the freearc the some thing and then you can make extractions with the arc files , the conception and the use is the same , the diferences are the next : the arc can guarantee generally speaking a little higher better compression but needs more ram to the extraction than the 7zip , for the exactly some file you need close 1 gb ram to make extarction with the freearc and you close 384 mb to make the same extarction with the 7zip but the freearc can give you a little better compression , so the decision is up to the user ..."
,shatru,2010-09-24T00:09Z,"i don't understant ""Normal quality"" it it mean untouched cut scenes? is it multi language? can you? can you specify what modifications you have done to game (14gb skidrow release) to make this directplay?"

[V],globeplus,2010-09-24T10:18Z,"Ok , complete game , nothing missing , perfect work that taked a long time , in a game with close 14 gb i certainy have to work things that is possible without changing the gameplay , the users are invited to play the full game with normality for a nice size and now a close 14 gb iso can be used in banal 4.7 gb disc for example , to this last users comments : donÂ´t be so hard with yourselfs and try to trust and interpretate correctly what the uploader said because working gigantic games in size is not that easy and it is lot of work . 100% of the gameplay without any problem ."
[V],globeplus,2010-09-24T10:22Z,"The things that i refre in the before comment is that is english only and certainly it isn´t because that it is english only that it is not full game or complete or with something missing , my question is , because have only 1 language is something missing or is any diffculty on the gameplay ? i don´t think so ."
,Shumpy,2010-09-24T10:46Z,"Thank you very much Globe, works just fine but I think I fucked up something with the Skidrow version before, the vids won't play and be skipped in both releases...

Anyone knows how to fix this ?"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-24T11:07Z,"The work on the videos taked a few hours time (close 4 hours i think) and the videos was worked one by one carefully to an appropriate codifier with the same framerate and before the work and after that they was tested inside the gameplay , if the users permit i say this : if you run the original videos and the worked videos after the work is really imperceptible any change , they have the same look and work in total normality simply like nothing was worked , of course that in a file with this extension i need to work things that donÂ´t affect the gameplay but if i do that and if it is possible i must to analise the correct way to do the work no matter how much time can take the work , many ways to do the work was analised even before starting the work and tested properly in the game until i get the correct model that looked better more similar to the originals and giving me at the same time a positive size for the type of the videos that i was working , i was impressed during the work about the quality work of the video designers with nice colorful and detailed work on the videos , this game is really a very good action adventure , and i canÂ´t see any pc gamer not beeing happy playing this game . Thank you and enjoy your game , in my files just wait with normality to get the file and 100% , donÂ´t be obcecated if it is something wrong or something , when happen circunstancial problems on the launch if it is the case certainly probably be a way out on something 99% of the cases , we (pc gamers) can find complete pages with possible errors messages for a few really nice pc games and this for users that really bought the game , i always make the necessary tests before putting the file available , besode that i can understand a little anxiety to play the game nice donÂ´t be so hard with yourselfs and just keep going improving your percentage until reach the normal 100% to have the file , remember : globe work is competent and trustfull no doubt and in many years i didnÂ´t leave it a file without help if it was necessary , so even in exceptional circunstancial situations with problems i am always here anyway to correct , it wasnÂ´t a single time that i disappeared leaving the users without the game in better conditions as possible . "

thank you globe for this upload......"
[V],globeplus,2010-09-24T15:21Z,"tHANK YOU FOR THE LATEST COMMENTS AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS TO SAY ONLY AS OBSERVATION :
- to janwr , the compression is absolutly the last worry and the last thing to doit in a work in a pratical file , first you have to work carefully better as possible all the sections of the game that is possible todo positive work without interfering with the gameplay and the absolute last thing is the compression , so the compression itself it is just a small part of the work and i want to say too that no matter how many help the file have , i did the work , i waited since the first second for everyone start getting the file and i am still helping after that ansd certainly this donÂ´t borring me a thing , just the users know that they can count with my support more as possible independtly how the file goes since the first second that i start the uploading . This is a very good game and for me all of you was already playing no doubt , cetainly donÂ´t make any diference to me that more and more users beeing playing the game if it wasnÂ´t for that i didnÂ´t made it the file in the first place , so seeing the users getting the file faster as possible and playing it is just the normal stuff ."

,OrangePillow,2010-09-24T22:26Z,"Heya, I wanted to say great that you've managed to get it to this size. Though I have some problems.

After the installation I moved the videos folder and the streams.ospc file into the media folder that got created, just like instructed.

Now the problem is that not any of the videos are playing in game, largely noticable after the first boss fight. Also I played the videos that were in the videos folder to see if they work.

They work, but the quality is real bad, a lot of squares going on in them. I'm not sure if they get reverted into higher quality when it manages to play them ingame, but if that quality stays the same I'm not very happy.

Thanks in advance."

Its me again, Pat, with the ""old Problem"". The video resolution is pre setted to a range my graphic card can`t handle, so i need to change the start video resolution of the game, to 1280x768 or something.
I cant find the folder where i can change it. In the game description is anywhere written you have to delete a file, and i found the folder in c/dokuments/my name/locals/app data.
there is a darksider folder BUT its empty.
The game is running and i hear sound BUT no video, so please globe tell me where the folder or file is where i can change the resolution like you did in the last game i downloaded from you.

First of All i want to say to you stop saying ""ABSOLUTE COMPLETE GAME WITH TOTAL NORMALITY"" when you have downgraded the videos to 30% of their original quality
are you retarded or what? your rip have very bad quality cutsenes like a 3gp nokia videos
Cmon i really appreciate your work but next time when you downgrade and reencode videos just let the users know
Besides this point the game work flawless despite a very long time in conversion about 45min !!!
Overall i give you 3.5/5 for you rip
Note: to all avg users disable your AVG shield or the conversion work won't be done succesfully
Note 2: Make sure you run the conversion work as admin
Note 3 to GLOBEplus : can you upload full quality videos in another torrent so users can get them later and replace shitty quality you provided with this rip

im just glad this is only 4gb so i didn't really expect everything to be perfect. go download the 14 gb one if u want best video quality, to me thats just not worth it to waste 10gb of my precious internet on some stupid video.

Hey can you release a fix so that gamepads (st least the XBOX 360 Controller) works. Please do it as the game is much better played with a controller.

Sorry, i got no fix for that prob. I wrote you in the other ups (skidrow) that I got the same Prob and noone there could help out. So I think you (and me) have to play that game again, deleting the savegames first and try another Version (globe, tbtp). I installed them all but i think if you use the old savegame, the game will crashes no matter which version you play. I think the prob sticks togethjer with the savegame, but...i realy dont know 4 sure.

All I can say is i tryes them all and it crashes at the same point, but not for everyone.
If anyone got solutions, please post them.
Thx, Pat"

 Again is it possible to play this game with xbox360 wired pc controller?If not then problem with this rip or original game?"

It says in the instructions that using controllers will lead to problems. But can we use the XBOX 360 Controller since this game was spefically made for that controller.
Please reply... 

@ sudeep_58
I had used the controller for just a brief time, maybe 5 mins. It worked perfectly then. But I don't know if there would be any problem while playing it fully with the controller. Plus can't use xpadder as the game shows the controller controls while using xpadder..
A bit irritating thing is the camera movement and rotating it with the contoller... It would have been much much better if the camera angle would have been like Prince of Persia or God of War..."
,NarutoNamikaze,2010-10-11T15:17Z,"@ sudeep_58
I had asked someone who had downloaded the Skidrow version if the XBOX 360 Controller worked without any problems or not and he had told that it worked perfectly. So the problem may be with this rip only. As I had said that I have played it only for 5 mins without any problems with the controller, so I can't say whether there would be any problem or not, but I don't want to take the risk.."

,NarutoNamikaze,2010-10-13T07:46Z,"@ sudeep_58

I meant that it says in the instructions that using controllers would create problems... So I don't want to take risk by playing with my controller. What if the game crashes and always crash after playing with a controller. You see. But I will surely play with the controller after I complete the game once.
And I think Globe won't reply... He hardly does."

SOME JEALOUS PEOPLES GIVING NEGATIVE RATINGS "
,JKRevan,2010-10-17T16:23Z,"Reposted from the Skidrow release

if you have a crash on the boss (most notabily, at the red horse rider) follow this

""
Played normally till the point where the small prompt shown up on the dudes head, then i paused, hit ctrl alt del (this brought the task manager to your non savvy peeps), under process tab, select DarksidersPC.Exe, right click, set affinity to only ONE of your cores (in case of multi core comp), also i set the priority to Real time

Other thing that Should be accounted for is that i was running the game in 640x480 WINDOW mode, the game resumed on the fight with the rider, i returned all options to normal, game plays smoothly. """

Make sure you follow the instructions given in the Readme.txt
