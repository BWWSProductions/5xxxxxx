,jmbmhs,2010-10-25T02:21Z,Use AVS Video converter ars6636. And do some experiment for yourself with the bitrate and frame size. Use x264 as the codec.

,albokid89,2011-05-20T19:12Z,nice but no end credits :(
,romet6,2011-09-09T13:04Z,"I downloaded two larger file versions with wrong ending before I found this torrent (it didn't show up under ""Highres""). I was beginning to lose hope.

Your rips always have a nice small size and good quality.

Thank you.
Thank you!"

,ajnsd,2012-03-31T03:14Z,"@albokid89,

This was not a mistake by YIFY. This movie does not have end credits. Ritchie intentionally left them out. 

Like someone else mentioned, this movie is an incredible mind fuck, and having the credits go completely black and instead just play music, is another unique element of the film. "
,romet6,2012-06-03T20:44Z,"""cant find anything to complain""

Try harder.
The quotes are in German and the parts spoken by the asian guy are not translated (I thought those subtitles were part of the movie itself, by what magic did you get rid of them?).

I generally love YIFY rips but I am not happy with this one, I'd rather settle for some DVD rip with these issues fixed (the other bluray rips seem to have different ending)."
