thanks"
,mtail,2010-09-24T13:59Z,"@babylone69,
-I just downloaded these serials from another Torrentsite (I left because of my ratio the program itself)
-downloaded the demo
-I didn't test them yet, maybe you can do that.
-I think it might be wise to block with Little Snitch!

,mtail,2010-09-24T15:54Z,"Sorry. The text ""I test them either"" should be of course : "" I did NOT test them either"""
,niknik1971,2010-09-25T09:37Z,Installed with the trial from Adobe and used one of the keys posted by mtail and they worked perfectly. 
,babylone69,2010-09-25T15:55Z,"@ mtail

great, thanks."
,cezzione,2010-09-25T16:45Z,"plz do not post serialz here, or they get blacklisted..."
,mtail,2010-09-25T19:04Z,"@cezzione,
You are completely right. That's why I advised to use Little Snitch. I think you should do that with all not free Adobe products."
,cezzione,2010-09-25T20:41Z,"ok mtail,
could you then del the serialz plz..."
,bobtom0,2010-09-26T16:48Z,do you have the cr-pse90.nfo file for this also?
,pReStOn_C,2010-10-13T11:16Z,do not post serials in comments or they will be blacklisted!!! if you can read it so can they!
,llessur888,2010-12-03T03:49Z,"works great with little snitch!
you can use your adobe id if you have one, just deny any connection with the word activate in it."
,anishmont,2011-01-23T22:10Z,@mtail  Can u plz giv me a cd key for Photoshop Elements 9 Windows OS.... Send it 2 online.anish@gmail.com if u want!!!!
,martin25173,2011-02-09T06:08Z,"I downloaded these bunch of .rar files, what to do with it, any explanation, thx"
,Jorne1,2011-07-23T15:58Z,How do you open all the compressed files? Stuffit says 'the structure of the archive is damaged'
,Skattik,2011-08-27T12:27Z,I just opened the folder (ending in .ISO-CORE) with daemon tools (mount it like a cd?) and it seems to be installing fine.
,Skattik,2011-08-27T12:33Z,"Installed like a charm! Keygen works perfectly - just select the correct application (photoshop elements 9) on the bottom left. May seem obvious to most, I'm sure... :o)

For anyone struggling... I created a folder on my desktop, extracted the first RAR file there to get the keygen. Copied and pasted all the other RAR files into that folder (without expanding) Then used the installer, and it all worked. It looks like you can also just mount the folder as a cd - which is probably easiest."
,chouchou74,2011-09-06T13:53Z,"Please help me,
I have installed the adobe photoshop elements 9 from the adobe site,
now I only need the key,
somebody help me how?
thank you"
