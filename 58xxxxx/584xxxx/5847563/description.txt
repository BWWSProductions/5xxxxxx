Sonny Stitt - Jazz at the Hi-Hat 
Audio CD: January 26, 1993 
Label: Blue Note Records 
Quality: 320 kbps CBR

This set was recorded in February 1954 at the Hi-Hat Club in Boston.  He often traveled and worked with a local rhythm section.  This was such a situation.  I would point out that this release for some inexplicable reason omits three tunes from the Fresh Sound (1002) version of the evening.  A nice tenor solo on Body And Soul as well as a swinging baritone solo on Baritone Blues and a good alto solo on How High The Moon.  Nevertheless this is Sonny Stitt at his peak.  Most of the tenor solos, to me, are somewhat perfunctory for Stitt with the exception of Indiana.  The alto solos are dynamite: Sweet Georgia Brown, I'm In The Mood For Love, If I Should Lose You, Wigwam and My Melancholy Baby.  The tune Tri-Horn Blooz is the best.  He plays baritone, tenor and alto.  Absolutely top notch.  He is fresh and at the top of his game.  Few players could have competed with Sonny Stitt on that momentous evening.  ~ Michael L.
