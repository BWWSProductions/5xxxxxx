,thechipmuncher,2010-09-24T14:33Z,Thanks. So sad this is Steve's last season.
,chronicoffender,2010-09-26T18:51Z,yea but dont be suprised if he decides to stay because everyone knows if he leaves the shows gunna end. they might try to put out another season with jim as boos but it wouldnt be the same and ratings would drop
,SammoSammy,2010-09-28T05:50Z,"Yeah, kinda like in That 70's Show when Topher and Ashton left. "
,WillemIV,2010-11-29T00:52Z,"But they want to replace Michael with Ricky Gervais. I guess he invented the show and he was what Michael is on the original version. I think that could be good too, although i would still miss Michael."
