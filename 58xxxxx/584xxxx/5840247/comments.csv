,ipodctrl,2010-09-20T02:15Z,"I would just like to ask what converter program you use for these iPod format videos? I use iPodme and it's supposed to be the most efficient converter available as others say (great quality, small size) but it seems that your conversions are more efficient. A 40-minute episode converted through iPodme would have a size of around 190mb, but your conversions are just 160mb but with excellent quality. I wuold really appreciate it if you could tell me what converter you use, I'm trying to save space on my computer and deleting videos would seem to be a frustrating option. :l"
,Tekniqe,2010-09-20T06:27Z,"Great work again! You save me so much time and hdd space with your conversions. Your file size to quality ratio is bar none =) MUCH MUCH appreciated. +1

req- Dune (extended) if possible. Whenever I get the file size manageable it looks like crap even on the tiny PSP =(

Cheers and keep up the phenomenal work!"
