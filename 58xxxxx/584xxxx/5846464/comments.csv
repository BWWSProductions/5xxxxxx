,candanga,2010-10-01T18:31Z,"Hi ppl! I had been using this program for many years now; but after I upgraded from 1014 to 1019 The program updated from 3.6 to 3.7 (the logo changed will bells and whistles), I got an APPCRASH error (under W7 x64). Tried to do a restore and no go. I even tried to find that updatestylesheets program, but jpsn removed it from its website. 

I made a full uninstall with Revo unistaller (removed all reg-keys), and tried again from zero and after trying 1014, 1017 or 1019, the fkr will ask me for a site key other that the ones we know (r00d xxxx). Any suggestions on how to make this thing work again? Thanks! 

btw, Im seeding here and in demonoid. Cheers!"
,candanga,2010-10-01T20:03Z,"Kewl emergency1 :)

Try using Nero (on of those Lites) 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5803530/Ahead_Nero_8_Lite_v8.3.20.0_English_%28Keygen_EMBRACE%29  Like this one. Read the instructions or check tutorials online on how to make ISOs. Its really easy :) 

Sometimes the security of the disks is high and you'll need to follow additional steps, everything is online :P Cheers!"
,uhbs,2010-10-02T12:23Z,"ok, somehow i have a registration problem, so i changed my name... :-)
candanga thanks for your reply. i was not precise with enough my question..
my question is: from where do i get the files, which files do i have to combine to create a setup-iso. if i use the program ""craeteupdate pack""(comes wich jeppesen), the result is one exe file. i i use the built in ""update client"" the result are several files in the dir /jeppesen/flitestar/download. an now? which files do i have to copy on the iso? do i have to replace some files....
thanks for help"
,Sbsaks,2010-10-03T09:09Z,"Dear emergency1
I see that ur question has been answered by candanga. There are a few progs on this site itself which can create .iso files very easily. In order of preference, they are 1. Alcohol 120%. 2. Clone CD or Clone DVD 3. Ultra ISO (I use this one), 4. Daemon tools (free software) and of course a host of others. Experiment a bit with these and you would be a master in making ISOs out of CDs or DVDs. All the best and happy seeding."
