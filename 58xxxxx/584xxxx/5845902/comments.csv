When are codemasters going to make a physics system that is for us hardcore simracers? Yeah I understand that not everyone is into hardcore physics, but is it that hard to just make it like this by default, and have a HARDCORE mode for us that we can select?

Fuck you Codemasters. If this was as good as you said it was going to be, I would've purchased it in a heartbeat."

,inferno26,2011-09-03T12:23Z,"SOLUTION FOR SAVING IN OFFLINE MODE

THIs is one of the most frequently asked questions in our troubleshooting articles. F1 2010 is a Games For Windows Live (GFWL) based title and you need access to a GFWL account in order to save game progress. But donâ€™t worry,  in case you donâ€™t have an online profile, you can still save the game using an offline account. Step by step instructions on how to do this is given below:

    Launch the game. Open the Windows Live menu (or it will open automatically, prompting you to log in or create a new account).
    If you are not logged into any GFWL profile continue to step 3. If you are already logged onto a profile (local or online), try launching the single player component and try to save progress. If saving and loading works fine, you obviously have no problem. If it does not work, youâ€™ll need to sign out of the current profile before continuing to step 3 (Create profile button will only become visible when you arenâ€™t logged in).
    Click on â€˜Create new profileâ€™ button.
    In the dialog box that pops up DO NOT hit continue. Hitting continue will take you to a registration page for an ONLINE profile â€“ this is not the requirement.
    Once in the â€˜Create Gamer Profileâ€™ window, scroll down so that you can see the bottom paragraph.
    Look for the hyperlinked â€˜created a local profileâ€™ link in last paragraph. Clicking this will allow you to create a new offline profile.

Note that an offline GFWL account will not let you play online. But you should be able to play single player mode without any issues whatsoever."
