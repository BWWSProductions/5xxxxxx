"  Italian trumpeters Enrico Rava and Paolo Fresu pay tribute to the late Chet Baker -- but take it from us, the set's way more than just a simple tribute album! Some of the tunes might be familiar ones from Chet's book, but the performances here are often distinctly un-Baker-like -- taken at times, tempos, and tones that really push the envelope -- and which make the album more of a demonstration of the instrumental strengths of Rava and Fresu than a return to Chet's earlier sound. Each player gets a channel of the recording to himself -- in a way that makes for very playful interchange that recalls the way Chet's horn and the baritone of Gerry Mulligan worked together strongly on Pacific Jazz -- save for the fact that this time, neither player's working on a reed instrument. Rhythm is by the trio of Stefano Bollani piano, Enzo Pietropaoli bass, and Roberto Gatto drums -- and titles include "My Funny Valentine", "Anthropology", "Doxy", "Line For Lyons", "Donna", "You Can't Go Home Again", and "Strike Up The Band" "
