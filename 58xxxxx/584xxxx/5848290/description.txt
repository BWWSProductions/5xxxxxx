Getting planning permission to build in open countryside is nigh on impossible, but Helen and Chris Seymour Smith have achieved exactly that. Both architects, they decided to move out of London and build their own home in the middle of the Cotswolds countryside. They managed it through a little-used planning law called PP7. This allows houses of exemplary architectural merit to be built on Green Belt land. And their house is certainly going to be special, because they plan to build it underneath a collapsing, ruined 300-year-old barn, so their home won't actually be visible in the landscape.
