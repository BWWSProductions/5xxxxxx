Azureus is telling me that openbittorrent is offline, http unavailable but it downloads via DHT having 19/11 - seed/peer ratio at time of my comment and after kicking off a few peers with the usua aggressive clients it's downloading fine at 110kbps on my 2Mbit, 128Kbps real term speed, connection throttled back to 15Kbps upload until i complete.

At the moment it isn't TV Teams problem or any other uploads using openbittorrent tracker.

Use a DHT enabled client or you'll have to wait until the tracker's sorted out.

Peace. : )"
