Synopsis: 	

When all humans have left the Earth because they have destroyed it, one little robot continues to do the job he has been built for - collecting garbage with the help of his pet cockroach. Eve, a robot built to see if there is sustainable life on Earth, comes to the planet one day and Wall-E falls in love with her, showing her a living plant that he has found in the rubble. When she deactivates except for a blinking green beacon, he has no idea what's wrong - but stays by her to protect her, even when they are both swept away!
