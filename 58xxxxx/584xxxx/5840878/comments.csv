,NitrogenUA,2010-09-20T03:17Z,"Ppl over the internet stated that you have to disable and/or delete KHBBS plugin/folder in order for this one to work. Also, disabling some other plugins may help you to run the game."

,123.blackbee,2010-10-10T23:12Z,"Hi everyone. I just got a psp go and am trying to put some games on it but i keep getting ""files corrupted"" when i transferr it to the psp. I have power iso but haven't really used it except to mount games on my pc. Any advice would be really appreciated, thanks."
,NitrogenUA,2010-10-13T19:43Z,As far as i know there is no way to play ISO-images on PSP Go! at the moment. The only way for you to play games is to buy 'em on UMD's or to download 'em via PS Store (for a fee ofcourse).
,123.blackbee,2010-10-14T09:59Z,"k, thanks. Just my luck i guess, appreciate your info."
,NitrogenUA,2010-11-02T09:14Z,"My bad - no UMD drive on PSP Go!, only digital distribution via Playstation Store."
,Raiviz,2010-12-20T19:05Z,"Thanks, Dissabled KHBBS patch and the game worked just fine :)"
