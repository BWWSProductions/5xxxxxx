I thought replay av could not record randi and thom for awhile now. I tried but could not get it to work these shows. When recording, were you able to listen to other audio while it recorded? So it did record up until last week? damn. What version are you using?"
,lonefunman,2010-09-25T02:00Z,"it was set up as a stream capture and i could listen to other audio while it was happening, which was perfect. i am listening to KPOJ now and recording from the speakers, so i just manually stop and start to edit the commercials in real time which is a 3 hour investment that i will rarely have time for. it seems like around the 14th or 15th sept was the last stream that captured.  i am also toying around with scheduling it to just open the website and play/record from speaker and see if that is granted access to the website. then i can at least just edit later.  thanks again for posting"
