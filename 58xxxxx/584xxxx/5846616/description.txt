Time for a quick peek at Christine Oâ€™Donnell before she mutters a spell and disappears. Last night on Sean Hannityâ€™s show she said she is â€œnot going to do any more national media.â€ She claims she only appeared on Hannity because she â€œhad some business in New York.â€ Whatâ€™s that mean? That she figured out she could get her campaign to pay for free trip to New York for her if she went on the show? Christine claims sheâ€™s not doing any more national media so that she can â€œfocus on the people of Delaware.â€ More specifically, sheâ€™s going to focus on that roughly 30 percent who are dumb enough to vote for her.

In reference to witchcraft, Oâ€™Donnell repeated her â€œWho didnâ€™t do some questionable things in high school?â€ line. That depends, Christine. Are we talking about sneaking a cigarette behind the gym, or worshipping Satan? In my school, not a lot of kids went through the â€œSatanic picnicâ€ phase. Sure, there was the black lipstick crowd, listening to Bauhaus on their Walkmans. But actual Satanic alters with actual Satanic picnic basketsâ€¦ not so much. Oâ€™Donnell said that her dabbling in witchcraft was, quote, â€œrebellion.â€ What? Staying out past curfew isnâ€™t good enough for you? You have to worship the Devil? I went through my rebellious phase. It involved spiky hair and a lot of bracelets. I wasnâ€™t standing on a pentagram trying to summon the Anti-Christ.

But Christine isnâ€™t the only nut in the campaign trail mix. A new poll shows Andrew Cuomo with just a 6-point lead over Carl Paladino in the race for Governor of New York. Oh. My. God. Carl Paladino should not be within 6 points in a poll for governor. Carl Paladino should not be within 6 miles of the governorâ€™s office. They really should come up with some kind of restraining order, just to be safe. In the poll, 40 percent of New Yorkers say the most important trait in a candidate is that heâ€™ll â€œbring change.â€ Carl Paladino will certainly bring change. But then so would a giant asteroid striking the earth. Governor Carl Paladino would be a disaster on a level with an asteroid strike or a tsunami. If he gets elected, New York State should become eligible for federal disaster reliefâ€¦ assuming such a thing still exists if Senator Christine Oâ€™Donnell has her way.
