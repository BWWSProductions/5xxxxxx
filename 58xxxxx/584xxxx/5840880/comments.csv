,kiwilove007,2010-09-28T23:26Z,I think it would be very helpful to have this available to download - minus the games.
,muxquito,2010-10-02T00:08Z,"Hi all.
This is such a great post and very useful indeed. Although it says that there are 29 seeders and 53 leechers it seems that there is nobody else seeding it. Could somebody please re-seed the post? Iâm very interested on it.
Thanks and regards
Muxquito"
,ruffjas,2010-10-02T15:19Z,I am seeding it again
,robbers,2010-10-05T04:26Z,"ummm, heres's  a fucking brainwave ...

how's about NOT locking it ALL in a FUCKING .zip file, so that ...

people can take what they want; i.e. i don't need games, so FUCK the games !!!

already ...

oh, what's that, you say ? if you were to do that then there'd be no point in any of this, 'cause people may as well get their own ?

exactly.

stop wasting bandwidth"

you could say the same thing with more polite words."
,ruffjas,2010-10-06T03:43Z,If i dont put them all in a zip then the Asuite will not work right.  I will be posting one with out games and some new programs.
