,Gredge,2010-09-29T02:54Z,"While the Bible is an extrodinary piece of evidence their also exists an amazing amount of evidence outside of the Bible. In fact their is more evidence for Jesus than even Alexander the Great. The first historical records span 1000 years at the nearest to Alexander the Great, where Jesus evidence existed within the lifetime of eyewitnesses. And there is a very large source of writings outside of the Bible that can be used. Some of the most compelling is by those who were against the cause of Christianity. Now if the Bible didn't add up to the historical data it would be the best evidence against, but on the contrary it provides much evidence for it."
