The primary goal for this program is to motivate. Students and adults alike who feel they are â€œpoor at mathematicsâ€ often perform below their true ability level in other scholastic courses and in the workplace, by avoiding math. Our system will not make each person who studies it a genius, however, those who practice the strategies will look at math and all other courses of study in a more enjoyable and more confident light. You will be acquiring a more healthy self concept and attitude towards numbers and higher mathematics.................
