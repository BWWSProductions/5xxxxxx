Now for a little question, me and my friends wanted to play Lan and everything went fine, sat up a server, they connected to the server etc. However there was only one big FLAT map, so we changed that out with a save file so we could get another world. However, now the zombies won't work. Night comes and eveything, but the zombies just don't appear. Any tips on how we can get zombies back in the game? Thanks :D"

The problem is not the name spoofer, notch is aware of the bug and is working to fix it.  The current fix involves either replacing a dll, or starting the game offline and then connecting to the internet.  Either way, it sucks.

Funny story, the name spoofer doesn't work unless you are connected to the internet :D
I'll look at messing with it this weekend to allow you to launch the game from a .jar located in the same folder as the name spoofer, but notch will probably fix the bug before I fix the spoofer."
,knapman47,2010-09-22T19:59Z,"To save everyone trapsing through that forum that was posted, basically the only solution seemed to be that you had to be disconnected from your internet BEFORE starting the game, so, close your game, disconnect from your internet, restart game (sound should then come on) and reconnect to internet if you wish.

,ProButch,2011-01-26T05:13Z,"If you like minecraft, buy the freaking game! Notch and the Mojang team have put alot of effort into making Minecraft for all the good little boys and girls, and you freeloaders just come and torrent it.
If you are just trying minecraft out, sure... As long as you pay for it when you realize how awesome it is. With an account, you get so much more stuff. Updates as soon as they're out, skins, and multiplayer.
Do yourselves a favor and just get the game. It is well worth it."
