A seemingly defenceless, put-upon nerd is all that stands in the way of a marauding dragon.

Branded as a nerd and harassed by the school bully, 12 year old Arthur is one day rescued by a magical troll who knows that the boy unwittingly holds the secret to defeat an evil dragon. Arthur's loving mum, struggling to keep her devious ex-husband from gaining custody of Arthur, dismisses her son's fantasies until she realizes the all-too-real immediate danger. She joins forces with Arthur, the troll and a dashing but washed-up video-game master. Together, they hope to conquer the dragon and the wicked vice-principal who threaten civilization!
