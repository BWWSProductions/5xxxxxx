,Suomimies112,2011-01-02T13:12Z,"It starts with no problems, but when it is in the loading screen, it just shuts down itself and goes on to my desktop. No any error messages or similar. "

[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-01-08T11:10Z,PhysXLoader.dll means you need to install physx drivers from nvidia... lol
,aaron1046,2011-01-09T04:41Z,"The game was installed with a nivida video card, the full game already installed is in a rar file, so unless you got a nividia video card, even if you download the missing DLL, it will crash after the loading screen."
,aaron1046,2011-01-09T04:51Z,"Got the DLL file, installed latest DirectX, crashes after loading."
,aaron1046,2011-01-09T06:00Z,"OK final post:
To fix the loading screen crash.
Go here: http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.10.0513-driver.html
And download and install the 
PHYSX SYSTEM SOFTWARE
NOTE: IT DONT MATTER IF YOU DO OR DO NOT HAVE A NIVIDIA VIDEO CARD OR NOT!
I am running a ATI and it works."
,Nerd4ever,2011-03-24T05:32Z,"Such a beautiful game! Can't wait for Trine 2 to come out hopefully this year. Good torrent, no problem at all, using windows 7 32 bit."
,Mikeelo,2011-03-24T13:14Z,"You can watch the intro video,then it's loading.... and game suddenly crashes.No messages for missing dll,no nothing.
No problem with Nvidia Physx or with my vga card (ATI 4870 1 Gb) driver.Both,are updated.
I've tried to adjust the settings....antialiasing,e.t.c and no result.
I've also downloaded,the demo of the game,from the official site.I've heard something about Codec....With demo version,you can update Codec,DirectX e.t.c and as a matter of fact I did but,still I have the same problem.I can't even play,the demo version!
I use Windows 7 32 bit.
Sorry guys but,it seems that,aaron1046 is right....This game is,only for Nvidia users.
