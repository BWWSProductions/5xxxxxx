    Documentary series following a dramatic expedition         
    searching for tigers hidden in the Himalayan Kingdom of   
    Bhutan.                                                  
                                                              
    With tigers heading for extinction, an international       
    team of big cat experts and wildlife filmmakers are       
    given unique access to the jungles and mountains of      
    Bhutan for what could be the last chance to save this     
    magnificent animal.                                        
                                                              
    Explorer Steve Backshall is joined by sniffer dog        
    Bruiser; together, they hunt for tigers through the       
    dense forest undergrowth. High in the mountains,           
    wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan drives himself to      
    exhaustion tracking tigers that seem as elusive as the   
    yeti. And in a jungle base camp, scientist George         
    McGavin organises a firefly disco, while camerawoman       
    Justine Evans is stuck at the top of a tree during a      
    tropical lightning storm.                                
                                                              
    For the final team member, big cat biologist Alan          
    Rabinowitz, time to save the tiger is running out, as     
    he has been diagnosed with incurable leukaemia. Alan     
    bugs the forest with remote cameras to capture whatever   
    secretive creatures are lurking there, but ultimately      
    he needs to find tigers if his ambitious plan to          
    protect them across the Himalayas is to succeed.         
                                                              
    We follow the expedition every emotional step of the       
    way as they strive to find evidence that could help to    
    bring wild tigers back from the brink of extinction and  
    safeguard their future.
