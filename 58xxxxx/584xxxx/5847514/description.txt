Food is the one thing none of us can do without. Fortunately
very few of us in the developed world ever have to. Yet
strangely, in these times of plenty, food is talked about more
and more. In the past, most people had very little choice over
what they ate. Nowadays, we are genuinely spoiled for choice.
Supermarkets provide a year-round cornucopia of foodstuffs
from all over the world. Restaurants serve a bewildering variety
of cuisines. TV chefs entertain us with a host of different dishes
that we could make if we put our minds to it.
It seems as if, as the choice grows, we begin to question more
and more if we are making the right choice. Maybe we should
avoid food containing trans-fats because itâ€™s bad for our health?
Maybe we should eat berries because they are rich in anti -
oxidants that slow ageing? Maybe we should buy organic because
itâ€™s good for the environment? Sometimes we even wonder if we
should eat food at all, because it could be contaminated by bac -
t eria that cause food poisoning or additives that cause cancer.
