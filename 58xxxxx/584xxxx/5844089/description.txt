While this album will forever be remembered for spawning the huge hit 

singles "Frankenstein" and "Free Ride," there's plenty more to 

appreciate on this stellar release. From "the other single," "Hangin' 

Around," to the pretty melodies of "Round & Around" and "Autumn," the 

set collects ten outstanding cuts, played with fervor by Edgar Winter, 

Chuck Ruff, Dan Hartman, Randy Jo Hobbs, and Ronnie Montrose, along 

with guest artist/producer Rick Derringer. The "party" feel of "We All 

Had a Real Good Time" and the singalong "Alta Mira" only add to this 

already red-hot mix, making They Only Come Out at Night the album 

Winter will always be remembered for. ~ Michael B. Smith, All Music
