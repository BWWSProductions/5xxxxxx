Shock Treatment is the fifth studio album by Edgar Winter. The album went 
to No. 13 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart,and had two charting singles: 
"Easy Street" (#83 Pop Singles) and River's Risin' (33 Pop Singles)

With this release, Edgar Winter was faced with the question that haunts many a superstar following a highly successful album -- how can he outdo himself? While Shock Treatment falls short of outdoing 

himself, it still manages to rock pretty righteously. Beginning with this album's answer to their previous "Hangin' Around," "Some Kinda Animal," the band moves into the excellent blues torcher "Easy 

Street," which is painted with highlights from the substantial saxophone talent of Winter, not to mention some of his finest singing. Like They Only Come Out at Night, this recording includes a pair of 

haunting ballads, "Maybe Someday You'll Call My Name" and "Someone Take My Heart Away." "Queen of My Dreams," along with "River's Risin'," showcase the Edgar Winter Group doing what they do best -- rocking 

out with passion and lots of drums and guitar. Not as good as their previous album, but still a winner in its own right.
