And no, I am not making this up. "

,thunderbum,2010-09-23T01:42Z,"@ Jwhitt - For some reason, the limbaugh torrents are seeding really slow. It's been hours since  you've u/l and I'm showing 0 seeds, 0 connected.

Have you changed the way you're seeding? I've noticed that although you're here, on demonoid and sometimes torrentzap, something's really wrong.

Something's changed, don't know what. Are you seeding this as an initial seed? Looks like I won't be able to grab's today's program.

If anyone else has been able to get today's program, ***please*** keep seeding."
,Lissar,2010-09-23T02:29Z,"First and most importantly, I'd like to thank jwhitt for all he (or she?) does here. 

This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a response on any torrent board, but out of all the ignorant liberals out there, joeblowman was the first to draw me out of silence. Congratulations. 

I won't bother getting into a debate about whether he has any veritable evidence to back his claim. And anyone who talks so brusquely regarding a sensitive issue like rape should be excoriated. Congratulations a second time, for being ignorant, vile, and insolent. 

I would never be so lenient as to charge Joe with ""making things up"". That is for children who do not know better. ""Lying for your cause"" is reserved for liberal adults."
,Oot-Glit,2010-09-23T02:44Z,"There's still a bunch of leechers like me stuck at 17%. Looks like tonight's torrent is a bust.  

Joeblowman is an obvious troll. I wonder if his mommy knows he's on the computer?"
,thunderbum,2010-09-23T04:11Z,"Yeah - I think tonight's show is a washout. On this board it's showing as 127 leaches, 1 seed. Since the time I first posted here today, I've been stuck at 17% also showing 0 seeds.

,thefizdude,2010-09-23T04:13Z,Thanks a lot J!!  All's well with the seeding - my d/l completed in minutes.  Seeding now.
,UL.W.M,2010-09-23T04:18Z,"yes, its very slow, been at 29.4 for  awhile"
[T],jwhitt62,2010-09-23T05:31Z,"I switched ISP's on Sept 11th. I went from DSL to cable. The new service worked great until yesterday (Sept 21st). A technician is coming out Friday morning to take a look at it. If he can't fix it, I guess I'll switch back to the slower but more reliable DSL. Sorry mates."
,thefizdude,2010-09-23T06:57Z,"At least there's an explanation, thanks for the feedback J.  I had to abort this d/l from here, it got stuck at 47%.  I'm trying now over at Demonoid (also your d/l), but it's slow going.  Don't sweat it too much - with a bit of patience, we'll all get there in the end."
,UncleBeer,2010-09-23T06:57Z,It's also over here:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5846467/Rush_Limbaugh_Show_-_Wednesday__September_22__2010_MP3_not_CF
,thefizdude,2010-09-23T07:13Z,"Scratch what I said, my d/l never completed (sorry).  It looked like it will until 46% it went really fast and then just got stuck.  I had to abort and am now trying from Demonoid."
