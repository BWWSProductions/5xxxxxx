The audio (english at least) is seriously screwed.  Besides the fact that it's not in sync and is a seperate file, its also really bad...like LINE audio, but if this is in fact a BRrip, there would be no reason for line audio, and no reason why the audio should come seperate and of such low quality.  Voices are really low and hard to hear, other noises are loud"

You're full of bullshit. Why are then as many seeders as peers, lol? Fix it!
(Often some incompetent people blame others for their mistakes or not knowing...something ;-)"

You need to add +3400 milliseconds either in play back or use delaycut software (   http://www.videohelp.com/tools/delaycut  ) to permanently add positive or negative delays. It doesn't support AAC & Ogg.
