,gn333444,2010-09-22T09:39Z,doesn't Quantum theory come out only oct 12?
,sunbleached,2010-09-22T10:24Z,"@gn333444 - you're obviously new to this. Many games are leaked early and posted for download. MorphX comes out next month, and it was available a few months ago.  Halo Reach was out about a week before ""official"" release."
,kam01,2010-09-24T06:40Z,"So it says PAL in the title, so does that mean it wont play in the US.  Is there a RF version coming."
,thepirateofpirates,2010-09-25T22:00Z,Is it in English ?!

,thepirateofpirates,2010-09-28T20:31Z,"Thanks for whatever that meant... btw, did it by any chance mean the game is working ?!
Note: I have a blocked Xbox360, I don't care about stealth or what so ever :D"
