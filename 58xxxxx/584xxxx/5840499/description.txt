Clapton is the 19th studio album by British guitarist/singer/songwriter Eric Clapton. It will be released on September 27, 2010 in the United Kingdom and the following day in the United States and is made up of a mix of new material and covers. Several songs, like "Rocking Chair" and "When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful", will be familiar to concert-goers as Clapton and his band have been performing them live already on Clapton's most recent tour.

Eric has said, "This album wasnÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³t what it was intended to be at all. ItÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s actually better than it was meant to be because, in a way, I just let it happen."
