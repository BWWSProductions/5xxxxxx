Ancient Voices, Modern World: Columbia

Wade Davis makes a remarkable journey into the heart of war-torn Colombia to visit one of the indigenous groups that call themselves the Elder Brother. These extraordinary people claim to be the last descendants of a once-great civilization, the Tairona, and to speak with their voice. Could they really be the last window we have on the great high civilizations of the ancient Americas?  Wade's journey to find out takes him from the tropical plains of northern Colombia to the frozen peaks of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and a chilling close encounter with the FARC, the terrorist guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
