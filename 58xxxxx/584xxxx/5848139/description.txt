The Rush Limbaugh Show 23-Sep-10 CF mp3 32 kbps

I am currently experiencing problems with my internet service. A technician is coming out on Saturday to take a look at it. The result is my upload speeds are terrible, at this point less than 10kbps. That's why the seeding has been so slow.

Because of my internet problems, I have reduced the size and quality of Rush's show to expedite, as much as possible, the uploading of the show.

I want to thank everyone for their patience, and a special thanks to those who have rendered assistance regarding this issue. This problem should be resolved soon.
