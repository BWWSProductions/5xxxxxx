,Tainan,2010-09-24T00:31Z,"Hey JW - Thanks as always for your work. It is much appreciated;especially by all of us outside the continental USA - CONUS.
I must say though, and I mean no dis-respect, I usually just DL Rushs' show and ""un""-tick the boxes on the other material. Not that I don't appreciate those 'extra' programs - Its just that I do not have the time to listen to each one of them. Just speaking for myself.
I sometimes go to their originating web-sites and see whats available.
Maybe you could save time by just listing titles and posting a link to their site for those interested. 
Just a thought. I'm pretty high-speed low-drag on things and try to do the most with the least.

Thanks again for your work.
And..as always....

Shut UP Maria!"
,thunderbum,2010-09-24T00:45Z,"As always, thank you kind sir!

Tainan - it must be working - all your messages to Maria to 'shut up' has worked its magic! :)"
,jim380,2010-09-24T02:20Z,Thank you !
,Oot-Glit,2010-09-24T02:31Z,"Thanks for the service you provide to all of us. We appreciate your efforts. Sorry to hear of technical difficulties on your end. 

Like Tainan, I also usually de-select everything except the 3 hours of Rushs' show and for the same reason. I just don't have the time to listen to everything. Just sayin'...."
,thefizdude,2010-09-24T05:14Z,"Thanks a lot J, sorry to hear about your technical difficulties.  We don't ever d/l more than these three hours anyway.  This d/l was great - completed in seconds!  We're rooting for you, love your work and we hope you'll have great speeds again in no time! Thanks again."
,BarrySoetoro,2010-09-24T07:15Z,"Well I downloaded at 2Mbps, so the seeders (of which I am now one) are doing their jobs.

Thanks Jwhitt, thanks seeders!"
,BarrySoetoro,2010-09-24T07:45Z,"I see you went from 128 to 32 kbps... still sounds great.

Thanks!"
,flying_kiwi123,2010-09-25T23:43Z,"Thanks for posting but the alternating loudness throughout the clips make it extremely annoying to listen to. This can be fixed using compression. If you have Cool Edit Pro, the default 'hard limiting' setting ensures the clips have constant loudness."
