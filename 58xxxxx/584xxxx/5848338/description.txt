The journal written by the governor of Plymouth colony of Massachusetts.  It is not the easiest read but can be fascinating for anyone who enjoys reading history.  It also contains his account of the societal arrangement which has been noted to be similar in construction to the modern movements referred to as socialist or communist.  But the Plymouth colony experienced not only similar construction to modern communism but the profound devastation that such a system reaps against its human subjects.  Bradford, in his record of events for the colony, notes over time the improvement experienced by the colonists after he abolishes the communitarian arrangement and establishes what could be called a primarily free market system of self-ownership.
