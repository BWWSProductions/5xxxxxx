,theoriginalphantom,2010-09-20T17:36Z,Nice one for this CC. Automated ways dont work for me but its all good otherwise.
[V],ChattChitto,2010-09-20T18:19Z,"That's why the third good old way still exist! ;)
However I'm really interested why both methods don't work, even so at least the second should.
Please E-Mail me the details or Private Message me on my website if you have an account there, maybe we could solve this in the next release!
Thank You!"

,noelnyc,2010-09-21T01:47Z,Automated ....Not working
,Mclectric,2010-09-23T05:51Z,"Hey Chatt, Automated works great! It just needs a little help.  I installed AnyDVD 6.6.9.0 and it stated that I had 21 days left to purchase. So I ran your automated option 1, and it still said trial. so I had a license that was still good but for 6.6.8.3. So I just thought what the hell and double clicked to register the old license 'thinking that these previous version licenses never work on the new releases."" But did!!! And it was registered to you untill 10/21/2011 with an HD license!!! Thanks AGain for a great up!!!!"

,daveo76,2010-09-27T14:43Z,@ Evilness74: I'm with you that Norton is crap. It says lot of stuff have virus when it dosen't
,Bean-Bandit,2010-09-28T09:44Z,The crack that's provided in this one didn't work for me either but I did what McLectric did and it worked fine.
,fc322,2010-09-28T21:05Z,"This other one works 100%:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5846420/AnyDVD_HD_v6.6.9.0_[Win_-_MultiLang]_[Tntvillage]

also u can just run the crack from the tntvillage and use this same setup file (thats what i did)

else you get error:  ""21 days left in your trial"""

,Timewarptwo,2010-10-02T02:03Z,"Running Win 7 (32bit) couldn't get it to work and I must have downloaded anydvd from you at least a dozen times in the past and always got it to work the very first time but not this time. These are the steps I took:
1.) Disbaled my internet connection
2.) uninstalled previous version
3.) installed this download
4.) made sure Anydvd was not running
5.) applied the crack by dragging and dropping the crack file to the install location. When the baloon prompted me to replace the existing file I said yes.
6.) re-booted my computer
the program did not work it says Trial Period Expired

Thank A Million anyway "
