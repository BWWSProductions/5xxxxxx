"Pilot"

When manager Todd Dempsy (Ben Rappaport) 
returns to work after management training, 
he learns that the Mid America Novelties 
call center has been outsourced to 
Mumbai, India. In order to keep his job, 
Todd is left no choice but to relocate to 
India. There he meets his eclectic group 
of employees, and soon realizes that 
teaching them to understand America will 
be the first of many hurdles that he 
needs to overcome. Todd also discovers 
other foreign transplants working in his 
office building, including American 
expatriate Charlie Davies (Diedrich 
Bader, "The Drew Carey Show") who runs 
the All American Huntercall center, and 
Tonya (Pippa Black, "Neighbours") a 
beautiful Australian who runs the call 
center for Koala Air.
