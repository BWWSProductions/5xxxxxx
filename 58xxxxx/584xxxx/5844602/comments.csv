,alibabaking,2010-09-22T00:30Z,Yeahhh.THANKS MAN...
,alibabaking,2010-09-22T00:32Z,"great torrent,thanks MAN...."
,Jukeboxor,2010-09-22T01:32Z,"OMFG it was like 1kb sec first 2 mins, so i found a direct link and thought ahh this is faster then i checked again and BOOM 7mb/sec!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Mojo_66,2010-09-22T03:04Z,"I totally agree with toecuttah, the torrent that he linked is much easier to handle."
,DragFire,2010-09-22T04:19Z,easier to handle??? the only thing you have to do is to unrar... the others are just extractions of these. 
,toecuttah,2010-09-22T06:51Z,"which is one less headache we have to deal with.. 

and actually, since the tards that rar'd the iso put periods in the rar names (how fuckn stupid can you be), you'll more than likely have trouble extracting, IF it even shows up as a rar- and if that happens, you'll have to go through and rename every one of them 

straight up, fuck uploaders that rar iso's and similar extensions, and/or uploaders that are too lazy to unrar the iso before sharing"
,justcause28,2010-09-22T09:24Z,WOW! Are you seriously that lazy that you think extracting some RAR files are a headache lol. 
,Allordex,2010-09-22T09:56Z,"MORE SEEDERS!!! Need More Seeders!!! Or that noobish heads and brains, of the idiots offline!!!"
,justcause28,2010-09-22T10:19Z,Theres 135 seeders which is plenty.
,justcause28,2010-09-22T10:22Z,So far I have over 902 seeders. The seeders are increasing gradualy.
,NarutoNamikaze,2010-09-22T13:54Z,"Anyone who cannot save:
This is a GFWL game. You have to create a local profile to enable saves, like it was in DiRT 2.
To make a local profile, press home and go to make a new profile optin. It will take you to a page. Do not create it just then. Scroll down in this page and there would be a hyperlink to create a local profile.."
,toecuttah,2010-09-22T17:06Z,"@justcause28; not at all- unlike yourself, I'm just not stupid enough to DL something that's been split into 63 rar files when it's already available in it's original form of iso with over 5 times the peers.. dumbass xD"
,whistlersmom,2010-09-22T18:27Z,"@toecuttah.

I only double clicked the first one and dragged the ISO file out where I wanted it. Tho I see ur point about it being stupid. However , this one is the one with the best Seeders / Leechers ratio atm :))"
,fakemito,2010-09-23T07:04Z,"I GOT A ERROR HERE, when i'm starting the game, a error message appears with nothing but a OK button. PLEASE HELP."

,jdperez2003,2010-09-23T23:24Z,"hmm..download speed here is much faster than by the other razor1911 by extremezone, im only getting about 30-40 kb/s for 5 hrs while in here its up to 1mb/s so i will delete that and stick with this one..nice"

,wazz62,2010-09-30T17:11Z,"kdub64 Once installed you need view all the files and you will see the folder Razor1911 which contains the crack. Copy the content within that folder into your c:/programs Files/Codemasters/F1 2010 folder, overwrite click yes and then everything will work OK"
,kdub64,2010-10-03T00:56Z,wazz thanks for helping but I did that and it still does it and when I launch the secuROM application the razor thing comes up and then it says Seculauncher failed to start application. 2000
