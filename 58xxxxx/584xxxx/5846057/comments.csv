,Polysaturatedfat,2010-09-23T10:35Z,"I really, really appreciate the effort, uploader, but why aren't the subs encoded? Someone's going to release your torrent with the subs encoded, and it will have to be re-compressed so people won't bitch about the size, resulting in crappy video quality, and that's the one that will prevail when it could have been yours, you know?"
,Polysaturatedfat,2010-09-23T10:35Z,"And PLEASE don't take any of that the wrong way, honestly, I was just wondering if there was a method here"
,OG_Triple_OG,2010-09-23T11:15Z,Just download the Hi Def version- MKV file - with the SRT for subtitles - then use mkv2vob to do a quick conversion that will make it play on the PS3 and add the SRT file when you convert it. 
,Corininha,2010-09-23T11:15Z,"@polysaturatedfat
Why the fucking fuck will somebody want HARDCODED subfuckingtitles? We (the fucking rest of the fucking world) like to fucking add our own subfuckingtitles which are ALMOST ALL OF THE TIME in other fucking language than fucking english. Have you ever fucking tried watching a fucking movie with fucking english subfuckingtitles over a fucking hardcoded title?

Instead of bitching about it, fucking thank the UP and keep seeding. :) So we (the fucking rest of the fucking world) have a chance of taking this:P:)

Seriously. Smart people never need hardcoded subtitles. And usually smart people are not Americans. Don't take it wrong. I said ""usually"", not ""all the time"" as I met some pretty intelligent Americans too! "

for xvid: A=10 V=10

@Max2011, to avoid all that and avoid losing quality with the recode, you can easily take the subtitle you are interested in:
 -change its name into the exact name of the movie (without the extension).
 -Create a folder on your desktop with the name of the movie. Let's assume ""machete"". Create more folders if you want to burn more movies with their subtitles.
 -copy or cut (drag and drop) the movie and the subtitles (always with the name IDENTICAL to the name of the movie file. 
 Note* If the movie is called Machete (2010) R5 XviD.avi then the ""engsub.srt"" will be Machete (2010) R5 XviD.srt after you change it's name. With right click and RENAME in windwos and with right click>>>get info>>>name and extension and PASTE the name of the movie keeping the extention (.srt, .txt, .sub and others) on OS X.
 -After having all the folders that you want to burn, drag and drop them in the dvd burning program of your choice, select speed 8x (for older dvd players full of dust) and click BURN:)

VoilÃ¡! :)"

,gcaver,2010-09-25T01:14Z,":::: HOW TO VIEW SUBTITLES WHILE WATCHING ON PC ::::

Guys... for all the noobs out there who just wanna see the subtitles while watching on your PC... all you have to do to see the subtitles is rename the .srt file and the .avi file to the exact same file name.  Windows Media Player will then open both automatically and subtitles will be shown fine."

,Corininha,2010-09-25T02:02Z,"gcaver

,orinvee,2010-09-25T06:02Z,"xescuy and all others who just don't seem to get it:

ALL leechers are SEEDERS who just haven't finished downloading! If you are LEECHING, you are SEEDING! The difference is that when you have finished downloading the complete movie, you become a SEEDER! If you are downloading a movie, you are a LEECHER!

Do you get that? When a torrent is first posted, EVERYONE is a LEECHER because no one has completed a download. More leechers means faster downloads unless you have more file parts that the rest of the leechers which means your download speed will slow to a crawl.

A SEEDER is someone who continues to allow others to download his completed download for a period of time. If enough people seed long enough to allow more people to complete their downloads and then they continue to seed for  a period of time, the torrent will never die.

There's nothing wrong with LEECHERS, morons! They are just people like you trying to DL a movie! You can't become a SEEDER without first being a LEECHER!

Therefore, when a torrent is first posted, it will be ALL leechers and NO seeders. Read a little about file-sharing and quit your moaning about leechers and seeders.

The only time one needs to ask for seeders is when a torrent has been allowed to die. That is NOT the case with this torrent."
,snilloc,2010-09-25T09:14Z,"@ orinvee 
According to you, you absolutely blow out of the water the myth that men cant do more than one thing at a time i.e. multi tasking.
Well I am leeching and seeding therefore I am multi- tasking.
Thank you so much for clearing up that age old myth."

The movie had some funny/gory moments (at one point ""machete"" rips out someones intestines to use 'em as a rope to escape through a window) but the overall plot was awful as was most of the acting.
I guess that's to be expected but the action sequences weren't all that entertaining either. You can see much better even in second choice action movies."
,fade9150,2010-09-26T21:07Z,Guys when you get the file downloaded just rename the English.srt to the same name as the avi file.  It will play auto if in the same folder.  It will also show up when you covert it without adding it.
,FRivera,2010-09-27T20:31Z,"a7 v7 10x extremezone!! and everybody else - I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.

  Firstly, and foremost. It was a good movie. Nudity, gratuitous killing, and some poor humor.. some say it's a crappy movie for that. But THAT is what they were going for. A 70's ish (i think) type movie. And it worked. *Spoilers ahead*

 Granted it would have been nicer if the killing scenes were a bit more fluent/fluid, and if they weren't so easily told to be fake. But come on, a nude shot of jessica alba, and lindsay lohan, +steven segal as the bad guy. 
  That to me, kick's ass. It was a good movie. And to be honest, seeing him as always a sidekick, or a side villain, having his own role. Danny trejo, it's past due. 
  If you like gore, violence, and a halfshot of Jessica Alba (which, most of us do, and will download just for that), why not. Plus the plot is fairly solid. 
  Definitely worth the download, and worth the watch. Could have been better, but still a good movie. "

,juggazappadad,2011-02-19T23:34Z,why do morons get other morons all rield up with there comments and take up room in the comments sections that should be used for info on the torrent for the uploader or A/V quality for us leachers and seeders? If someones feeble minded comments upset you enough that you need to retort with even more mindless drudgery you shouldnt be using the bay let alone breathing through your nose...MWCL

Robert Deniro Steven Segal and Lindsay Lohan, Jessica Alba - weird casting . a fuckin crazed junkie must have done the casting for this film. Oh and by the way @juggazappadad you are the dumbest hypocrite ever. Moaning about peoples long messages then leaving one yourself. You parsnip ! "

,manikopsa,2011-04-22T03:16Z,Worst movie ever. The actors are quite good. But very amateurish and the scenes are very poorly made. 1

,giggidyp,2012-01-06T01:37Z,"use peerblock and you idiots will not get letters.
if you do not know what peerblock is?
STOP PIRATING MOVIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!
any good LAW breaker knows how to cover up 
their tracks!
AND for the record this film(and many others) by tarantino and rodriguez are made to be like the Grindhouse style films! their supposed to look like grainy/campy/low budget-crappy movies of the 60s-70s. their a fantastic fun way to enjoy a buzz and have a laugh!

Thanks for the ups! extreme!"
