,zaroba,2011-11-24T19:42Z,"thanks for the upload.

but, i have to ask...the 19mb of stuff is zipped into a 15 part multipart zip.  each one of those pieces is in a separate zip, then all of those zips are in 1 zip.  wtf?
there's nothing wrong with putting the stuff into a single zip file, or even leaving it unzipped.  its only 19mb."

,bigough,2012-04-02T02:24Z,"zaroba is correct, this torrent comes in 19 different files that are in sections.  In order to run the installer/keygen you need to individually extract each folder and place each section into one folder or it will give you an error message.  

Not bitching, just knowledge based, thank you for the effort!"
