,Gloogloos,2010-09-24T12:51Z,it eventually stopped looping the installs but then the game directory was around 10g and the game had no cinematics
[T],[D],2010-09-24T13:03Z,"The installed game is only 10gb, the rest must be other languages.
Anyway, who the fuck made this port? My monitor doesn't support whatever resolution/refresh the default is at (video mode not supported) (and it's a rather normal monitor). And there's no ini or config file where I can change it outside the game, like other (normal) games do.

Anyone know a solution to this?"

,lovemylife,2010-09-24T17:11Z,"I'll just write some solutions to problems I've encountered while installing this torrent:

1. THE INSTALLER ASKS FOR DISC 2:

Just copy and paste all of the content  of the DVD-2-Folder (except for the SKIDROW-Folder) to the DVD-1-Folder.

2. THE INSTALLER LOOPS THE C++ AND DIRECT-X-INSTALLERS:

I just exited the installer of Skidrow (by pressing the red X in the top right) and copied the content of the SKIDROW-folder (located in the DVD-2-folder) to my installing location of Darksiders. 
In this case: Computer>C:>Program Files>Darksiders. 
I replaced the files and merged the media stuff. After that I could start the game normally (the loop disappeared after restart).

I hoped this helps some people."

In the nfo is written that if you got this problem you have to delete a folder in c/name/dokuments n settings/app data/ i dont know now, BUT i searched there and there is no folder to delete.
I have had that prob before and normaly you can find a cfg. file or something to change the start resolution of the game but not in this case.
If anyone knows where the file is to change the start video resolution, please answer me, i cant get the game to start without changing that.
I am sure that more people got that prob, so if anyone can help me out that would be great.

It has nothing to do with the Monitor resolution its only the pre setted resolution of the game.

No thats not because the graphic card are too old, its because the game start resolution is set to a range , some cards can t handle. It must be some unusual resolution like ...i dont know, 70? x 50?.

You can solve this Problem with a little trick ""globe"" told me. Look out for Globes release of ""Dead rising 2"" and read my and globes postings.

You have to dl a little Aplication that forces the Executable to start the game in a windowed mode, ill Post the link in my next Posting, first I have to go look for it.
That will help all the People with Music but no Graphics."

Now I already passed the first Boss and Dungeon (using the keyboard YESSS) and I have got freezes no more. I have Windows 7 and the framerate is never higher than 60 or lower than 20 so I have nothng to complain about. Otherwise the game is really fun and you would be amazed about how much it resembles ZELDA. I could actually feel it while I was playing :) Oh by the way I'm seeding for a week.

-Extract to the Darksiders install directory. Run the exe file to config controller.
-Shutdown all config / controller profiler programs before running the game."
,word304,2010-10-02T18:55Z,"Fix for SAVED GAMES not loading:  

-Cause by issue between STEAM and game where the game ends up looking for saved games in the wrong location. With the crack that's used, your saved games folder has to be ...\Documents\My Games\Darksiders\ (for Vista / Windows7, I don't know what it is for XP, etc.)
-Case 1 (easy fix) - STEAM was not active during 1st game launch. STEAM is active in the background and you're running the game.  Turn STEAMclient off -> run game -> it should load games properly. If still doesn't work, try recopying cracked content from iso to the game folder.
-Case 2 - STEAM was active during 1st game launch.  The game then set itself to the STEAM settings for saved games which directly conflicts with cracked content settings .  If you're lucky, simply recopying cracked folder from iso to game directory will fix it. But most likely, after uninstalling you'll have to manually search + purge residual game-related files in hidden folders before you attempt a re-install.  Easiest way to do get around this: Load a System Restore point before game was initially installed.  Otherwise - file search on entire C:\ hard-drive - search darksiders*.* then delete *folders* of the search results.
(Yeah major pain in the ass, I know. It's due to STEAM using anti-piracy settings that are saved in remote locations that usually set as hidden)."
,word304,2010-10-02T19:14Z,"Potential FIX for game crashing during certain scenes:
(assuming AMD logo file fix already attempted).

1 - Download + install the K-Lite Codec pack with default codec settings - http://www.free-codecs.com/download/k_lite_codec_pack.htm
Use Codec Tweak Tool to detect and fix broken filters. This is the codec pack I use and I haven't encountered any game crashes at all (I haven't beaten the game quite yet, but I know I'm close to end).
2 - (VISTA users only) - Download + Install Vista Services Optimizer http://www.snapfiles.com/get/vsoptimizer.html
After install use the ""Automatic Tuneup"" feature to optimize windows for max performance. Restoring Window's default service configuration will work too - but has lots unneeded services that eat up too much virtual memory and thus slows system performance.

Saved games should be in .../Documents/My Games/Darksiders/ (specific attn to intermediate ""My Games"" folder)
It's weird that you can't save only after a reboot.
Perhaps you have STEAM set to auto-load at startup and upon loading it either deletes existing saves or sets a new saved games folder?
I bet you can find the answer doing a search for files with extension *.dsav "

It is an emulator - NOT a fix.  

I'm assuming the size difference is due to SKIDROW's rip including all possible content for the game while the globeplus rip chose to remove content which wasn't absolutely necessary.

I can tell you that any game only interacts with the .ini and .dll file created by the emulator .exe file AND that no other game files or settings are changed when the game interacts with those 2 files.

In conclusion > since I don't know which content the globeplus rip included, I have no idea if the emulator will work with it or not BUT trying it out won't mess anything up.  If it doesn't work, you simply fix it by deleting the .ini and .dll files in the game directory and you're back to the same exact point before you tried it out.

P.S. A game version that shows the xbox controls doesn't mean that version can detect a controller. (i.e. 'showing' controls doesn't necessarily imply 'able to detect' a controller)"

,notafraid150,2010-11-05T23:07Z,"Fix for SAVED GAMES not loading: 

-Cause by issue between STEAM and game where the game ends up looking for saved games in the wrong location. With the crack that's used, your saved games folder has to be ...\Documents\My Games\Darksiders\ (for Vista / Windows7, I don't know what it is for XP, etc.)
-Case 1 (easy fix) - STEAM was not active during 1st game launch. STEAM is active in the background and you're running the game. Turn STEAMclient off -> run game -> it should load games properly. If still doesn't work, try recopying cracked content from iso to the game folder.
-Case 2 - STEAM was active during 1st game launch. The game then set itself to the STEAM settings for saved games which directly conflicts with cracked content settings . If you're lucky, simply recopying cracked folder from iso to game directory will fix it. But most likely, after uninstalling you'll have to manually search + purge residual game-related files in hidden folders before you attempt a re-install. Easiest way to do get around this: Load a System Restore point before game was initially installed. Otherwise - file search on entire C:\ hard-drive - search darksiders*.* then delete *folders* of the search results.
(Yeah major pain in the ass, I know. It's due to STEAM using anti-piracy settings that are saved in remote locations that usually set as hidden). "

Mine keeps crashing during the end of installation. I dont get any of the shortcuts or .exe's so I cant do anything."
,Lucky13s,2010-12-02T18:55Z,"Found a solution to the black screen during start up. Its Very, very simple.

-----------------------

If you're freezing during start-up and getting a black screen just after intro vids:

Rename your AMD Video to anything,
(i renamed mine to ""xxxAMD_Logo_movie.wmv"")
so your game doesnt detect it. It'll skip this video and take you straight to the menu screen."
,Lucky13s,2010-12-02T21:45Z,"Everything works except for cutscene vids, which are very choppy, dunno why, I'll report back when I find a solution.

Also Wondering if anyone knows if theres a patch out yet. I've found the v1.1 crack, but many searches of google show no v1.1 for PC??"
,Lucky13s,2010-12-02T22:04Z,"Ok I've managed to find various solutions to various problems, so if you're having any kind of trouble, try them all.

First things first, SKIDROW stated that they screwed up on the installer and that it doesnt work properly for everyone, it may crash during the end of installation, it may still let you play the game, but it might be messed up.

You need to grab the installer fix:
Darksiders update 1 skidrow installer fix
It wont let me post links so search for it yourself!

Once you have that, it'll have instructions on how to reinstall darksiders.

Once you've reinstalled it, add the v1.1 crack.

Do the intro fix I stated above (rename your AMD video to anything so it skips it during intro)

Now try to play the game and see if theres any change.

I'm applying the fix to my game right now and will report back if it resolves some of the choppyness problems im getting."
,Lucky13s,2010-12-02T22:22Z,"everything works, sadly no performance change though :(

However, this fix may be fixing problems some people have been having with save files/game crashing at certain points etc."
,syafiqeu,2010-12-03T01:07Z,+1 WORKS FINE
,Lucky13s,2010-12-03T01:21Z,"Ok so Installing the 4gb compact version of Darksiders apparently resolves the choppy cutscene problem.

Basically it turns all the super HD cutscene vids into much lesser quality, but cuts waay back on filesize.

Soo, if you've got the time to download 4gb, maybe get that instead of this torrent, or install it over this torrent if you've already downloaded this, and see how that works.

Filesize isnt really a problem for me, but performance is. I'm currently downloading the 4gb one, if I get any performance difference, I'll report back :)."

,AngryDeathBear,2010-12-25T21:47Z,"For those that are still having problems with the Direct X/C++ Loop and haven't figured it out (took me a while).

1. Run the installer as normal, and allow the Direct X/C++ to loop once. (The second time it tries to install the DX or C++, exit the installer)

2. Go to the directory you specified for your installation (If the ""Darksiders"" folder isn't coming up, run the installer again and choose a custom directory to install to.)

3. Copy the contents of the ""SKIDROW"" folder (from Disc 2) into the same folder as the other installed files.

4. Run DarksidersPC.exe"

,fburn8706,2011-04-02T06:51Z,"To wrap up the soluttions to common problems that are stated in this thread and the ones I personally encountered, we have the following:

Problem 1: Halfway done with the installation, it asks for disc 2. When you mount disc 2, it keeps on asking for it.

Solution: set a folder to contain non-rar (not image) installer. mount disc 1 and go to ""my computer"" the right click the mounted disc, choose ""open"" or ""explore"" , select all files then copy them to your previously set folder. Do the same for disc 2 (mount, open, copy to the previously set folder)

Now you have the non-rar (not image) installer. When you install the game, it will progress till the end.


Problem 2: the epic loop of c++/directX part of installation

Solution: install c++/directX once and hit ctrl+alt then del to enter windows task manager, choose LOG OFF to terminate all running applications. After you log in, everything is normal again and you may now crack the game using the crack folder.

Logging off spares the option of directly hitting the power button of your CPU. 



Problem 3: The black screen after THQ and VIGIL logo.

Solution: from program files/darksider/media/video, rename or delete the amd logo (the first video file there) so the game skips it everytime it's launched.


Problem 4: the xbox controller/ ""only looking up"" thing.

I'm sorry I can't help you with this one because I finished the game using keyboard and mouse, ftw :)


Problem 5: the damn horseman in the ashland arena won't be killed

Solution: at first, it was a game feeze/crash. When I mounted to Ruin again and press the button prompted, the kill cutscene finally played.


Problem 6: the cinematics'/cutscenes' audio stutters

Solution: It's an issue even in legitimate owners. It's minor for me but if it's enough to hinder your enjoyment, try updating your audio drivers. 


So far, those are the problems that I can address. I really had fun with this game so for anyone who also finished this game, please contribute. thanks :)"

,phaleos19,2011-04-11T19:22Z,"Nice game, plenty of problems with installing / playing / uninstalling this though.

Installing went smooth, just the loop with dx and c++ was a tad anoying but just ctrl+alt+del and close application and copy the crack from disc 2 after.

Second problem for me was that there is no way to change the graphics with this torrent so if your comp isnt great and the game is lagging a bit there is no way to reduce the graphics to get a better fps.

Third is that every time I restart the game I have to change my hotkeys again, it doesnt memorize them.

About halfway in the game atm, gameplay and cutscenes play perfectly though.

Also noticed there is no uninstaller but thats no biggie.


Anyone have a solution for problem 2 or 3?

,2008crna,2011-04-12T06:33Z,I have run this just fine on Windows 7 64 bit Pro. However I do have one problem that doesn't appear to be windows specific. I have completed the game until I have all the guardian's heart given to Samael but when I open the door to the throne room it is blank. A floating platform too far away to reach and just empty blackness. It appears to be a corruption in the game files. I ended up just deleting it but I don't know if I was alone in coming across this. No other problems throughout the game though.

,xSoul123,2011-04-20T06:01Z,"For those who think that something is off with the graphics and is bland (no dynamic lighting etc).. its probably coz the installer errored at the end and didnt put right registries @@

What i did was go to NvidiaCtrlPanel Manage3dsettings->programsettings->add Darksiders override anti-alias to 2x so just it could recognize the game and put graphic registries..

,kalaj123,2011-08-04T19:12Z,"OK PEOPLE LISTEN UP , HERE IS THE WAY TO INSTALL THIS:

1.Mount sr-darks1.iso with daemon tools

2.explore the file through daemon tools and run the file installer.exe

3.choose where u want to install game and click install

4.it will eventually ask u for disk 2, now go and mount sr-darks2.iso ON THE SAME drive u mounted sr-darks1.iso and hit retry.

5 when it finishes installing it will ask u to install direct x and microsoft retributable ,install them both,then u will be asked to install them again and again,u only need to install them once.

6.to get rid of the infinity direct x install hit ctrl+alt+delete,this should open task manager,go to processes and end installer ,this should end the installer.exe and end direct x install.

7 now go and explore sr-darks2.iso through daemon tools ,copy all files from skidrow folder ,then go to your darksiders  installation folder.

8.now paste the files you copied from skidrow folder inside the darksiders folder.now run darksidersPC.exe

9.have fun and sorry for long guide xD

,LuigiVuoto,2011-08-08T05:19Z,"Good, not great, game.  Kinda fun.

If you have trouble with the game hanging on a black screen when you start it, you've got to rename a file that's in the ../media/video folder.  I don't remember the name of the video file you have to rename, but it starts with ""amd"" and it's the first file in the folder if you sort alphabetically.

The rest of the game runs just fine.  No problems on a xp sp3 system w/ Radeon 4650 and i5, 4gig RAM, etc.  Looks great, smooth video.
