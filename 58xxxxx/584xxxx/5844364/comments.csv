[V],twentyforty,2010-09-22T06:23Z,"@neeru: You asked that before, right? Answer is simple: I cannot. It is few years old show, from times when HDTV wasn't common thing. Just recently (three weeks ago) show was re-aired by some affiliate in HDTV - but only one, first episode was capped. I encoded that one - as a tribute to one of the best series ever.

Many DVDrips is available on the net."
