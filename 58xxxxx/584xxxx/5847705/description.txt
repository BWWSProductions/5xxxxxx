From Recorded Books:

Philip Roth is the master of the uncomfortable, and his alter ego a connoisseur 
of self-involvement, self-loathing, and self-examination. In The Ghost Writer, 
Roth examines the tensions between literature and life, artistic truthfulness 
and conventional decency. At 23, Nathan Zuckerman has already hurt his family 
with his autobiographical art and ruined his relationship with adultery and 
dishonesty. Visiting his reclusive idol (famed for his "blend of sympathy and 
pitilessness") in the Berkshires, the writer watches himself watching himself 
and attempts to confront his work and life. Events, however, have their 
revenge, weaving more out of control than even he can anticipate or ask for.

From Wiki:

The Ghost Writer is the first novel by Philip Roth to be narrated by Nathan 
Zuckerman, one of Roth's alter egos, and constitutes the first book in his 
Zuckerman Bound trilogy. The novel touches on themes common to many Roth works, 
including identity, the responsibilities of authors to their subjects, and the 
condition of Jews in America.
