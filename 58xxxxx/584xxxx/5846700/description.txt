WiFiFoFum brings you a useful mobile WiFi scanner for the iPhone. WiFiFoFum scans for 802.11 wireless networks and displays information about each network it detects, including: SSID, MAC, RSSI (signal strength), channel, AP mode, security mode and transmission rates. The radar display provides a graphical representation of nearby WiFi access points.

WiFiFoFum also supports wardriving by creating logs of access point locations as they are discovered. These KML logs can then be viewed directly on the iPhone's map application or emailed so that you may view them on your desktop or laptop. To view emailed logs just paste the link in the email into the Google Maps site.
