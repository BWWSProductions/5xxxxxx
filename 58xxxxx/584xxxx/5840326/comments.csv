,sarryman,2011-03-05T12:27Z,"This does not autoupdate does it?What is the point of uploading a hacked antivirus\firewall if you cant update it. First generation of viruses since the last  update will be invisible for this thing, wont it?"
,Cgoff87,2011-03-29T04:52Z,"I got this while trying to install with KAV 2011...

http://bayimg.com/oAePfAaDK

I canceled the installation because it said it was downloading a driver online privately and that after a complete installation KAV will not protect me any further from this application. 

Whats this about murlok??"
