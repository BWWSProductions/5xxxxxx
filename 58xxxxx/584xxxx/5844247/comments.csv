ur subtitle is written even when there is hard sub for foreign language.. ur sub overlaps with the hard sub !! example - Kill Bill 1,2, Expendables..

But as you urself said it is a time consuming job so can't really check all my subtitles

@ Nemona

Friends is coming up in December"

,Dr-nidO,2010-09-22T07:36Z,"@ RiddlerA: 

m a huge fan of your torrents...
your dedication is commendable and you taking requests is bloody brilliant :)
and you do tv serials too,

one can usually get a ripped movie after a bit of searching but for tv series with great quality and small size, you are THE ONE and ONLY source

i know that you said that you are not doing any more tv series this year but when you get arround to it again can you do the x files series...
there is not a single good torrent for them...
i searched a lot...

keep up the great work buddy"
[V],RiddlerA,2010-09-22T07:39Z,"@ samsudi

Supernatural - All 5 Completed Seasons
The Wire - All 5 Season

The monk - If Time Permits

I will be doing in November:

THANKS FOR THE REPLY..
they don't upload subtitle like you, i love to watch with sub... not easy to find sub for new uploader.... hope their QUALITY atleast might equals urs... will download their prints thanks again for the information... CHEERS ! :)"
,wira020,2010-09-25T03:20Z,"@revamp
I think subs is easy to find.. i use subscene.com or opensubtitle.com.. both are free and have details like framerate.. so I just match up the framerate of the sub and movie.. usually it'd match even if different file name.. I'm pretty sure even riddlerA doesnt do subs by himself.. he'd probably got it from those site too..

@RiddlerA
Thanks man, had just watched it.. very good quality indeed.. already at 1:1 ratio and I will keep it in my torrent client so i could help seed when there's fewer seeders.. thanks alot for doing my request dude!"
,wira020,2010-09-25T03:24Z,p/s: Thanks for including Weeds in your list.. I hope you'll do it soon.. cant wait to watch it.. watched the first season and fell in love with the main actress.. hehe..
,Nightblade88,2010-11-03T21:55Z,"Perfect rip, absolutely astounding level of quality for a meager 663MB.
Thanks RiddlerA, I hope you keep it up.

As for the movie, I cannot understand why it has such a high rating on IMDB, there is nothing visionary or unexpected in it.
In fact I think it would been too kind to say that it's hedged in by cliches - it down right drowning in them.

Some movies are immortal, timeless, ageless. Relevant beyond their time.
""12 Monkeys"" is not one of them.

If you were as disappointed with this movie as I was, then try this movie instead:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4995602/Gattaca.1997.BRRip.x264.AC3%5B5.1%5D-VLiS

Made only two years later than this feature, Gattaca still stands tall as one of sci-fi's greatest."
,thesabuser,2010-11-07T20:36Z,Thanks very much.
,chackochi,2010-11-19T13:20Z,riddler thnx dude
,tofushoyu,2010-12-12T05:50Z,Thank you!
,equalizer231312,2010-12-14T22:15Z,"included subs?


EXCELLENTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
,orgnlchc,2011-01-01T17:39Z,"Nightblade88, the movie IS timeless. Gattaca, on the other hand, is as cliche as one can imagine. 
Too bad you are not able to comprehend the value of this movie. 

Happy new year to everyone! "
,mikecj,2011-01-26T14:14Z,"beware! i don't know what you lot are watching this guys uploads on?! I am watching off of a LaCinema Classic HD, through HDMI to a 37"" Sony TV. With these i am getting poor quality! Pixelated blacks and over-sharpened edges. I will stick to the 1GB+ file sizes, until someone can actually deliver on this kind of promise! Nice try, thanks for sharing, it's close but it's not quite there yet. If only you didn't over-sharpen and lower the export size so much!
let the onslaught commence!"
,mriddler,2011-05-14T09:46Z,"@mikecj: with all respect, RiddleR is not delivering the best quality out there, he is delivering the best quality within this small size.. u may wanna go for (http://thepiratebay.org/browse/207) for your screen. but we like those releases. thanks RiddlerA
and regardless my name, i didn't copy yours :D actually it was how i noticed your amazing torrents"
,tricepsman,2011-06-29T18:09Z,"nice quality but the audio could be better, but the video is fucking great

so, it's good for me...thx RiddlerA"
