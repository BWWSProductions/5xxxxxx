While a majority of American citizens and journalists do not yet know it, one of the most important events of the 21st Century to date took place at the National Press Club in Washington, DC on May 9, 2001. In the main ballroom before 100 journalists, 17 camera crews and 100 interested public, the Disclosure Project, founded by Dr. Steven Greer, presented the testimony of dozens of former military and agency employees which collectively confirms the extraterrestrial presence and the existence of advanced energy technologies which can completely replace any need for fossil fuels or ionizing nuclear power plants.

Statements were presented in person and via video tape. All witnesses in attendance vowed to repeat their testimony under oath before Congress. This press conference was aired live around the world via the internet and is continuously being downloaded from the Disclosure Project website along with the witness testimonies. While the near term impact of this event was blunted by the terrorist attacks four months later, it will play an historic role in the disclosure process and will almost certainly be repeated - in or outside of Congress.

MILITARY, GOVERNMENT WITNESSES TO PROVIDE
TESTIMONY ON UFO/EXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE
CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION SOUGHT

On Wednesday, May 9th, over twenty military, intelligence, government, corporate and scientific witnesses will come forward at the National Press Club in Washington, DC to establish the reality of UFOs or extraterrestrial vehicles, extraterrestrial life forms, and resulting advanced energy and propulsion technologies. The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, will establish without any doubt the reality of these phenomena, according to Dr. Steven M. Greer, director of the Disclosure Project which is hosting the event.

The Disclosure Project, a non-profit research organization, is calling for open Congressional hearings on the UFO / Extraterrestrial presence, and for legislation that will ban space-based weapons. Congressional hearings were last held in 1968 by the House Science and Astronautics Committee (90th Congress, 2nd Session, Committee Print No. 7. "Symposium on Unidentified Flying Objects." )

The Project has identified several hundred witnesses throughout the world and spanning every branch of the armed services, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), DIA, CIA, NASA, Russia, UK, and other agencies and countries. Over 100 have been videotaped; 70 have been transcribed into edited testimony. Videotaped summary of the testimony and an in-depth briefing document with witness transcripts will be available at the press conference.

Among the witnesses attending the event are: John Callahan, former Division Chief of the Accidents and Investigations Branch, FAA; Master Sergeant Dan Morris, former US Air Force and NRO operative with cosmic top secret clearance; Dr. Carol Rosin, space missile defense consultant and former spokesperson for Wernher Von Braun; Major George A. Filer III, former Air Force Intelligence; Graham Bethune, retired Navy commander pilot with a top-secret clearance; Michael Smith, former Air Traffic Controller, US Air Force; Sergeant Clifford Stone, United States Army; Captain Robert Salas, former SAC Launch Controller, US Air Force and FAA. Participants in this phase of the disclosure effort are asking for Congressional, White House and UN action to allow witnesses to testify under oath in open hearings. The group is requesting a Presidential Executive Order to protect witnesses afraid of violating security oaths and to declassify documents and secret projects for the benefit of all world citizens.

"These testimonies establish once and for all that we are not alone. Technologies related to extraterrestrial phenomena are capable of providing solutions to the global energy crisis, and other environmental and security challenges," says Dr. Greer. The Disclosure team and selected witnesses will be meeting with members of Congress and conducting briefings to address these issues and call for legislation.

kept secret, because of the UFO issues, hold the answers to our environmental and energy problems. Such as:

- Tesla's Self-Powered Automobile
- The Moray Radian Energy Device
- Gabriel Kron and the Negative Resistor
- Cold Fusion
- Dr. Randell Mills and Blacklight Power
- and many, many more

Note: This memo supports "Media Play" - by Steven M. Greer, M.D - most notably on page 6, which says "PAO [Public Affairs Office] now has relationships with reporters

from every major wire service, newspaper, news weekly, and television network in the nation. This has helped us turn some intelligence failure stories into

intelligence success stories, and it has contributed to the accuracy of countless others. In many instances, we have persuaded reporters to postpone, change, hold, or

even scrap stories that could have adversely affected national security interests or jeopardized sources and methods." Read more documents at
