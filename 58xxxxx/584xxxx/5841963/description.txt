Ondine (2009)
1280x720
x264, MKV
DTS audio
EN and PL subs

I noticed there weren't any 720p releases of this movie, so I figured I'd upload the one I made.  My source was the 1080p release by NLUPPER located here:  thepiratebay.org/torrent/5834437/Ondine_(2009)_1080P_X264_MKV_AC3_DTS_NLSub.
It fits nicely on one single-layer DVD.

I maintained the DTS audio and washed the video through a x264 encoder a few times to maintain the best 720p quality.  I synced and included English subtitles, in case some Yanks have trouble with the Irish accents.  I also include synced Polish subtitles for the Alicja Bachleda fans.

Comments appreciated.
