,lydonit13,2010-09-29T15:57Z,"I've been seeding this torrent for more than a week and still my uTorrent client shows only 4 seeders.  I'm at a ratio of nearly 17:1 (that's 73GB uploaded), so I can't seed for much longer.

It also seems that several open trackers are down, so please make sure DHT and Peer Exchange are enabled in our torrent software and then seed for as long as you can."
