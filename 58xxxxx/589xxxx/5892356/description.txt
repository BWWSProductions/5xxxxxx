Celebrated UK duo Groove Armada are set to release a new full-length this month, entitled White Light. As its title suggests, the record presents an alternate version of Black Light, an introspective long player that group member Tom Findlay described as showing "the darker side of Groove Armada." In the time since that album's release this past winter, the duo have played a series of huge festivals across Europe, prompting them to rearrange each track for better effect on stage.
