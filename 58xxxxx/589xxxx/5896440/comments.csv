,Beast_iND,2010-10-19T18:59Z,"It's the downloadable US retail version, everything in one .EXE. The store version is on disc, so it would be .ISO but this is sold here http://www.amazon.com/Quicken-Home-Business-2011-Download/dp/B003ZK51WY/"
,xbillx,2010-10-19T19:06Z,an iso file of this program would be very much appreciated.
,citizendonny,2010-10-19T19:34Z,why didn't you put this in an iso file? Exe is not the best way. could be a virus.
,gm12345678,2010-10-19T20:58Z,"Thanks very much, Beast_iND.  And in light of the other comments, I'll go one step further...  Thanks for NOT converting the original, authentic .EXE format file into something else ;-)"

,Dargonn,2010-10-20T01:42Z,"Magnet link works.

Virus scan returns clean and the Intuit crypto signature on the installer is intact, so it's legit."
,Beast_iND,2010-10-20T04:47Z,"Yah, it keeps eating my .torrent file both times I tried to upload it here, dunno why. But the magnet link works. And yes, the crypto-signature on the EXE is authentic, I did not alter the file."
