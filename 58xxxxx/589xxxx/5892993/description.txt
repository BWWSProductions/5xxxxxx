On Saturday 21 March 2009, DieudonnÃ© announced that he would run for the 2009 European Parliament election in the ÃŽle-de-France  at the head of an "anti-communitarist and anti-Zionist" party. Other candidates on his party's electoral list are Alain Soral and the Holocaust denier and former member of Les Verts Ginette Skandrani (also known as Ginette Hess), while Thierry Meyssan and Afrocentrist KÃ©mi Seba, founder of the "Tribu Ka" are members of the party but do not run. The campaign would be conducted again by Marc George. In spite of the association of DieudonnÃ©'s party with the Shiite Centre Zahra, whose president Yahia Gouasmi also runs on his list, his candidacy was supported by Fernand Le Rachinel, a former high ranking executive of the Front National and official printer of the party. In early May 2009, the French government studied the possibility of banning the party, but on May 24, Justice minister Rachida Dati acknowledged that, in spite of moral objections, there was no legal ground to do so. On May 28, it became known that Carlos "the Jackal" also expressed his hope DieudonnÃ© would make it to Strasbourg. The Parti antisioniste finally scored 1,30% of the votes.
