from wikipedia:
It's-It, released in October 1992, is a remix album by the Icelandic alternative rock band The Sugarcubes. After its release, the Sugarcubes disbanded, and BjÃ¶rk went on to have a successful solo career.

A limited edition double-disc set was released in Britain but is now long out of print.
