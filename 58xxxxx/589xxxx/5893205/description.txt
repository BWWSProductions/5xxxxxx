This is a great concert. It's semi pro shot. The sound is from the soundboard and the video is shot by one of the crew.
Meat is just great in this show. Just before he regained new fame with Bat 2 he performed in smaller clubs. And this show gives you the feeling as if you're right in the middle. Meat has fun. He also has a strong voice and the setlist is simply great.
This is a must have show!
