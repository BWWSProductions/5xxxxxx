The Thesis Wordpress Theme, version 1.8

Enjoy.	


A small aside, I don't use this anymore. It's kind of weaksauce. Thematic from Themeshaper.com is superior.

And it's free off the bat.

Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated to anyone/anything dealing with any association to any of the aforementioned. Thematic is just a superior baseline product.

Take that for what it's worth.
