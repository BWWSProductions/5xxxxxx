,yuioooot,2010-10-22T20:07Z,The subtitles are a joke. At least the english ones. Probably done with google translate. They are unreadable.
,yuioooot,2010-10-22T20:07Z,"And yes, you need subs. Spoken language is NOT English, but French."
,qwertyjackson05,2010-11-03T14:32Z,WTF? Looks like a good movie but Je ne parles pas francais
,jetblast,2010-11-04T12:20Z,"OK, English speakers.  Go to subscenes.com.  Don't search for 22 Bullets, search for the French title, L'Immortel.  There you will find a well done subtitle file for this great rip.

Hope this helps, and many thanks to the uploader."
