England's Lost Castles

Join leading scholars for a fascinating examination of the massive timber castles which were the pre-eminent fortification of their day, yet are now largely forgotten.

It is virtually impossible to think of the Middle Ages without conjuring up images of grand stone castles. Yet throughout much of English history, they were the exception to the rule, while lords and ladies built massive castles of wood to protect their vast holdings.

Journey through the English countryside to see reminders of the countless timber castles that have all but disappeared, leaving behind only the earthen mounds of their foundations. Historians reveal why these wooden fortifications were nearly equal to the much more expensive stone castles, and explain what life was like within their walls. See stunning reconstructions that show what these mighty fortifications looked like and how they were built. And explore fascinating new archaeological evidence that which casts new light on our knowledge and understanding of a time when England was dominated by these long-vanished timber castles.
