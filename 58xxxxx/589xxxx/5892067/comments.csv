,alt-ynb,2010-10-17T10:51Z,"usually in the pics section, is a file is a .zip, inside the zip is a file with random name that ends with .scr, which is a fake screensaver file, which is almost always a virus of some sort.  and their will also be a text file with a link for an alledged password.  

So i was relieved this was not the case with your post.  Thank you for the uploads.  Much appreciated."
