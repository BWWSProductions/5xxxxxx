,Keegen,2011-04-09T00:35Z,Any chance for more Smallville in HD? Right now i only have 9 and 10 in 720p and your 900p release of season 5. The rest is in SD and would love to replace those files with HD releases from you.

I think the show went downhill in season 6 and never recovered (despite the oh-so-hot Laura Vandervoort in season 7) so nevermind the later seasons - these links are all you need."
