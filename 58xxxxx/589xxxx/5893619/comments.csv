,txrabbit,2010-10-18T04:53Z,Whatever happened to posting a single avi file?
,micro-sleeps,2010-10-18T04:54Z,Many thanks gotta get my weekly Dexter fix!
,zerosk8a,2010-10-18T05:05Z,"Thanks for the upload, but really, .RAR? when you put a single file into a .rar you are not saving any space, nor are you helping anyone since half the time the .rar is corrupt. only idiots release archives, dont be an idiot. "
,aParadox,2010-10-18T09:55Z,"Agreed with zero. Like I said on another Dexter torrent, rar'd files were mainly for Usenet. Since this is torrenting and not usenet, I hope you learn this distinction quickly.
Maybe it's rar'd because the only other torrent out at this time was this exact same content. Who knows."
