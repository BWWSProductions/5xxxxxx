I wont call this a fake until if it proves to be, but everything else on the Net has been.
Averaging 3.4 KB/s so it's going to be a while."

And yes it has suck-ass Spanish subs that get in the way of English subs.

The audio is passable but I had to have it cranked all the way up(maybe my shit tiny Dell speakers to blame?).
Beautiful video quality.

But this motherfucker sucks donkey balls as a film in general, and VLC Player would NOT let me fast-forward through this stinker.

Gawd this film sucked out loud. "

Sounds is really low on PC, but when watched on TV sounds was fine.

Good A/V.  Bad Movie."
