2010 release, the 12th album in an infamous career, Not Music is part of Tim Gane's 2007 science experiment involving improvised chord sequences played on piano or vibraphone, over top of which were placed little drum loops. This was a new way of writing and it yielded a bumper crop of compositions, nearly 70 of which were boiled down into 32 new songs, 14 of which were cherry-picked to form Chemical Chords.
