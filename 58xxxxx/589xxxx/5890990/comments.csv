Maybe the uploader could reload the Torrent as a RESEED, then the 100 plus of us could just change the file we have to the new RESEED name, then do a force check, then continue on - we don't lose any data.."

,farafiro,2011-01-23T18:25Z,Me also stuck at 99.4%
,Robert012488,2011-01-25T19:40Z,Since its a RAR File; if you extract without the RAR being complete; then just 2 films (Full complete) extract out of the 5 Films. So; something comes out anyway.
