[DTRASH145] BABYLON DISCO - To Find And Destroy Atlantis
After grinding us with side project IYOV, our resident Swede-Trasher BABYLON DISCO gives us a very drum&bass infused blend of dark and bleak digital hardcore, in the vein of Patric Catani and Christoph De Babalon. This includes new tracks as well as a re-release of last year\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hiroshima\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" EP!
