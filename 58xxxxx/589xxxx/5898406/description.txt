Another Meat Loaf concert for you all. Live from the National Auditorium, Mexico. This concert from August 8 was broadcast on national tv. Meat performed songs from his "I couldn't have said it better" album combined with some of his greatest hits.
For me the concert feels 'weird'. Suposingly Meat's voice was dubbed at different parts and there is hardly any atmosphere. None the less a very nice show.
