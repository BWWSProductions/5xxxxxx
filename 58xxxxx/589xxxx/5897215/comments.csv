[T],Oceanhawk,2010-10-28T04:19Z,"I need some advice deffjam or anyone else (that knows)... Nero is giving me big problems overall (maybe its just the ""version"" i have) I just want to put all the movies i download on DVD's so they dont eat up all my memory. But they come in all different formats. So my question is what would you recomend for me to get in order to recode and burn them to DVD's. Am i missing another kind of software besides recoding and burning?. Yes yes I know... noob here."
,srawrats,2010-11-01T11:09Z,Oceanhawk; Dont use nero its a pig of a program try roxio instead.
,OreDigger4life,2010-11-03T08:22Z,"Excellent Quality! Thank you deffjamm555

@oceanhawk, Roxio is great, and magic ripper is ok, it all depends on how you want to compress and burn, expand and store. "
[T],Oceanhawk,2010-11-05T20:05Z,"@ srawrats & OreDigger4life
 ~Thanks alot for the advice. I will check out Roxio. For some reason I have always had some sort of problem with Nero, no matter what version it was (i know alot of people LOVE nero but for me i've only had bad experiences with it for some reason)
Anyways, thanks again :)"
