IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:The Social Network .MOV files .............Thanks Secret Sauceifier :)
AUDIO:The Social Network .MOV files .............Thanks Secret Sauceifier :)

Thanks to Secret Sauceifier on this one... Nice work bro... ;) First we did a small
script containing crop, resize, white balance, rgb eq, sharpness, chroma, brightness, contrast... The source video was very dark so we had to lighten it up a bit to make it more visible, but turned out okay considering. It has some dark scene's in it along with light scene's so it was a matter of keeping balance there. The audio is pretty good cam audio, but we did filter a few things to make the vocals stand out more and remove some small amounts of noise.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
