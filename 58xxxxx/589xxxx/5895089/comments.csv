,MushBear,2010-10-20T21:37Z,"All console games sold by UK retailers are designed for a PAL consoles, for the PAL version of this game, go to http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5881147/Naruto_Ultimate_Ninja_Storm_2_%5BPAL%5D_%5BX360%5D_

I downloaded from the link above, everything was fine, but my xbox 360 said it was the wrong region code. 

Now, if you are in Canada and America, you download this one. I have this and am currently buring it using ImgBurn, I'll get back to you guys and inform you whether this works or not."
,MushBear,2010-10-20T21:38Z,"*For the PAL region, it's common in Europe and parts of Asia. "
