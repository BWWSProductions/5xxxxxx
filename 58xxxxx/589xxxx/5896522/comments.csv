,comet.vermont,2010-10-21T22:07Z,"You know what, I TRULY appreciate the efforts of the SKIDROW team...

...I (like many others) was so anxious to play New Vegas that I bought the game expecting a ""Games for Windows LIVE"" game, not a ""Games for Windows Logo to Trick You Into Buying a Games That You Have to Have an Active Internet Connection & STEAM to Play""...

...This really pissed me off...

I BOUGHT this game...$50.00...

...THANK YOU SKIDROW team!  The crack works perfectly!  Using your crack it bypasses all Steam bu**sh*t & goes directly to the game I installed on my FU**ING computer as an application icon should.

...Again, thank you."
