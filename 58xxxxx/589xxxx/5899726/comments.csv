For a smaller set (50mb) it probably wouldn't be too much of an issue, but because this is a larger download, people might be put off because they're not sure what they're downloading."

,jojo256,2010-10-21T14:03Z,"The description is 100% accurate, I don't see why you would get bent out of shape about it, it is exactly what it says it is.  Thanks again to uploader"
,vladstud1,2010-10-22T08:56Z,"Ahoy! This is Vlad Gerasimov from Vladstudio.com. Glad you liked my artworks enough to share them. I made HD images available for paid users for a reason - sounds crazy but that's how I make my living. So if you find yourself using my walls for some time, please consider registering at http://www.vladstudio.com/register
And yeah I know my style is boring for many people!"
,vladstud1,2010-10-22T14:49Z,"@DigieraMandela - well, what I really meant to say is that, yeah I understand this is a pirate bay, so it would be strange to ask people to register instead of downloading torrent... but I thought I'd at least try! "
