"The Thing That Counts is What's Inside"

Susan is horrified when she discovers that she has 
become the face of the provocative internet company 
she's been secretly working for and is now the cover 
model for their outdoor billboard ads; Gabrielle 
tells her coveted secret to the ladies; Renee finds 
out that Bree is a grandmother and uses it to her 
advantage in an attempt to steal Keith away and have 
him for herself; Lynette takes advantage of daughter 
Penny's generous offer to help look after the baby; 
and Paul purchases the home he shared with Mary 
Alice, against wife Beth's wishes.

Enjoy :)
