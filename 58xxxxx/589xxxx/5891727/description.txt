Jason Collett - Pony Tricks (2010)




Jason Collett is a Toronto based singer-songwriter. He is a member of Broken Social Scene but also tours on his own, having released four solo CDs. His latest album, Rat a Tat Tat, was released in March, 2010. He recently joined forces with fellow Canadians in an independently produced film project the Iodine movie where he accomplished his acting debut as Deputy Peel.

Born in Bramalea, Ontario, a Greater Toronto Area suburb, Collett began writing songs at a young age to escape the boredom of his suburban life. He lists Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson and Nick Lowe as influences. Eventually Collett moved to downtown Toronto where he worked as a woodworker and carpenter, doing renovations and custom home building, while he pursued his music. He was a part of the short-lived alt-country group Bird, of which Andrew Cash and Hawksley Workman were also members. Bird released one album, 2000Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Chrome Reflection. Collett also took part in TorontoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s popular indie music gathering, Radio Mondays. Collett, along with others such as The Weakerthans and artists on the record label Arts & Crafts, would perform and write songs together. Collett has mentioned how Radio Mondays were great community-building events, with five or six artists on stage at a time.





One of Canada\'s most revered songwriters, Jason Collett, will share yet another aspect of his immense musical talent, releasing \"Pony Tricks,\" a reworked acoustic collection of eleven songs, including two never-before released tracks, October 12 on Arts & Crafts.

What was originally intended as an EP of re-imagined Collett songs stripped to their core, quickly snowballed into a powerful 38 minutes of music that simultaneously exposes and celebrates Collett\'s solo prowess and the intrinsic storytelling that makes his songs so unforgettable.

Coinciding with the release of \"Pony Tricks,\" Collett will head out on The Undressed Tour, a true cross Canada run of solo acoustic dates that kicks off in Peterborough on October 14, touches both coasts and includes Collett\'s first ever show in Newfoundland.

\"Fans often ask me if I have recordings that are representative of my solo shows,\" Collett explains of the inspiration for \"Pony Tricks.\" \"This release simply aims to satisfy that demand.\"

Pony Tricks was recorded at Zeus\' Ill Eagle Studios in Toronto, produced by Mike O\'Brien and Carlin Nicholson and mixed by Robbie Lackritz (Feist).

Indie rock darling Jason Collett first made his name in the Canadian music scene as a member of the multi-membered experimental outfit Broken Social Scene. Having taken a break from touring with BSS to focus on family and his own music, Collett has been putting out albums on his own terms. This latest release is no exception.
The singer/songwriterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new record, Pony Tricks, is a stripped-down acoustic recording that breathes new life into chosen cuts from his back catalogue. Nine songs have been reworked for the effort, while two previously unreleased tracks Ã¢â‚¬â€ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pulling The Sun DownÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Daddy Was A Rock Ã¢â‚¬Ëœn RollerÃ¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â€ are also included. According to Collett, the release is to serve as a more accurate representation of his live shows.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fans often ask me if I have recordings that are representative of my solo shows,Ã¢â‚¬Â Collett explains of the inspiration for Pony Tricks in an issued statement. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This release simply aims to satisfy that demand.Ã¢â‚¬Â
