,sibythomas500,2010-10-17T16:53Z,Thanks a million mate. We have been waiting all day for somebody to upload the episode 13. Thanks again from Saudi Arabia and UAE
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-17T17:13Z,Thanks. Encoding takes 12 hours. Uploading a torrent two seconds. I don't know why nobody did upload of some XviD before.
,sibythomas500,2010-10-17T17:32Z,"I wonder what has happened to VeroVenlo today, he was the first one to upload every week. "
,Hadrianpublius,2010-10-17T17:32Z,Thanks a bundle!
,Dani016,2010-10-17T21:19Z,"Thanks so much! the quality is superb! I think it's probably the best release of this episode on the net. 

I was just wondering, could you upload Xtra Factor Ep 13 as well? 

Thanks again!"
,Dani016,2010-10-17T21:29Z,"Thanks a lot, twentyforty! Superb quality! Probably the best Ep 13 release on the net!

Hey, I wasjust wondering, could you upload Xtra Factor Ep 13 as well? Please! I would appreciate that a lot.
I live in Sweden so I can't watch the show otherwise.

Thanks again!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-18T00:00Z,"@Dani016: Sorry, I cannot. I have too many shows on the schedule. And today everything looks fine, I see Tigzz and FTP have released XviD E14 and Xtra Factor 13 is on the  net too."
,Dani016,2010-10-18T00:35Z,Thanks anyways! You're the best!
