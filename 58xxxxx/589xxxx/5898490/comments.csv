,dennisjw,2010-10-20T18:33Z,"Hi 2040

Are you planning to encode mac compatible torrents again?"
[T],houruoha,2010-10-20T18:41Z,"thanks
:)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-20T19:32Z,"@dennisjw: All my torrents are compatible with Mac OS. None would be compatible with QuickTime. There are better players for Mac, as VLC or Mplayer. QuickTime was involved in handheld-war with Sony (iTunes refuses CABAC entropy, Sony wants exactly that one, iTunes hate bframes, wieghted bframes and bpyramid ... and Sony cares not. My vote has gone in one direction already."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-20T19:35Z,"... BTW, 272p is 1000% compatible with - everything."
,dennisjw,2010-10-20T19:48Z,"Hi again 2040

Thanks for responding but your recent torrents foul up in VLC, about midway, though it's watchable to the end all are corrupted to some extent. 

I haven't tried Mplayer yet. 

Also if opened in preview they hang the finder and a relaunch is necessary. "
,dennisjw,2010-10-20T20:13Z,"Correction it's call quick look not preview, it opens the video in the finder."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-20T20:21Z,"@dennisjw: It clearly shows that your download is corrupted, you run VLC with wrong settings or OSX ate memory during first half of the playback - it's maybe most logical explanation of your troubles. 

Well... I cannot change encoding process half way through, right? 
Also, you have problems and thousands of Mac users have not - and it speaks for yourself. I run Windows and Linux, not OSX, and I cannot help you with that problem."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-20T20:36Z,"... and PLEASE - stop repeating torrents. Torrent are small, guide-like files, for downloading something available on P2P network.

Media files (in my case mp4) are - the data, the content of specific torrent, which  does not anything else but says what, how and where is available for download.

It's like calling vegetables a ""brown bag stuff"" or similar."
,dennisjw,2010-10-20T21:24Z,"Hi 2040

Sorry for using 'torrents' instead of media files, my bad. 

Glee So2E03 and E04 480p played perfectly in QuickTime, so I have no idea why some don't. 

I do appreciate  you uploads. 

Thank you. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-20T23:28Z,"@dennisjw: I would go well beyond proclaimed limits with this, so do not get me wrong:
First you have said ""recent torrents"" - without saying which ones.
Now you saying that week old Glee plays fine - and ""others cause problems""... which ones indeed? One? Two? 480 is NOT QuickTime compatible - but it doesn't mean that QT shitty player would kill himself just by seeing my mpfours... some he would play - some...

All are encoded ABSOLUTELY on identical way (I haven't changed a thing since first release of 480p) - and why QT refuse to play some, throwing some errors, or nothing... it doesn't bother me at all. It does keep me thinking, but those limitations posed by Apple prevented me from earlier use of advanced encoding techniques. This time I would not follow the apple.
Try to understand how illogical it is: you have half dozen of 480p as example, but one player refuses - a couple - and all files are encoded on same way, where every parameter is identical to the last bit - and NO ONE claims that specific player could be used at all. I would replace the player, because old one is declared as incompatible...

VLC should play all my mp-fours, but not without big, as in my case, too big problems to be considered as valid player. Just in my case, millions have no problems with VLC, and I used VLC a lot - but - on my old computer, just two months ago.

Now - for myself - VLC is useless - and I cannot do anything about, right? But to use one which works (and I used before as my main, reference player).

First, speak about specific thing, playin' like this and I  would need dozen comments to get decent picture. Do not get me wrong - but you do it on wrong way."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-20T23:30Z,"...
Every single day - at least once - my torrent has full header. You are obviously here few weeks, so do bother yourself with reading:

""      480p = frame-size 720x400 pixels for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV) or 720x304
             for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR)
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/QuickTime/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file. ""


NOT compatible, see? It means, that not uniform compatibility is achieved nor - in my case - forced. Some files QT can play - some not. That is exactly that...

However, bear in mind that YOU have the problems that only you can resolve. Other people can help, but how you would do it - it's completely up to you. Start with listening and comprehending."
,Rama_111,2010-10-30T17:29Z,Thanks twentyforty. This played just fine and I appreciate the small file size. Good encoding.
