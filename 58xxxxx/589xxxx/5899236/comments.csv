,thedjey,2010-10-30T01:23Z,thanks the uploader..some info about the show can be found here http://www.cretegazette.com/2010-02/the-island-victoria-hislop-tv.php in English...
,kleftisaa,2010-10-31T00:28Z,Thanks up loader.Great show. If you keep up with all the episodes that would be great. I have alot of people that want to see this. I'll seed for a while longer. Yiasou from down under!!
,kleftisaa,2010-10-31T00:30Z,"PS If you could lower the pixel rating a little so it can be played easily on regular S/D players that would be great.
Yia!"
,Agrippa01,2010-11-10T07:06Z,"Now I see your comment Kleftisaa, but I still don't understand why to lower pixelrate in order to play the file on a SD-player (you mean a mediaplayer?). My AC-Ryan player does just fine with the files the way they are. In fact I would like a higher resolution even better!
(I even change Asiouds downloaded files to a 16:9 format so it looks better on my LCD TV...)"
