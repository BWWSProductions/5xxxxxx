Late at night in Las Vegas, the tattoo parlor is about to close. Enter the tall, dark and stunningly beautiful stranger ...
Vampirella strips off and lays on the couch, ready to become the tattooist\'s greatest masterpiece. As he works, she tells him of her nativity and her mission. Obsessed with his art he hardly notices what she is saying. He discovers that he has tattooed the face of his wife on Vampirella\'s back ... the wife he murdered several years back.
Vampirella was present when the wife died, tasted her blood and absorbed her memories.
Justice is meted out with a twist.
