Synopsis

Knock Out is a fast-paced thriller that happens in real time. In just two hours- 11am to 1pm - an enigmatic vigilante pulls off an incredible, mind-blowing coup and a new chapter of Indian history is written.

Sanjay Dutt plays a new age lone ranger who has the latest weapons and gadgets at his fingertips, and is a man who trusts and depends on no one. Working alone, he effortlessly uses his wit, his skills at hand-to-hand combat, and his love for stealth technology, to manipulate and trap his elusive target.

The target, played by Irrfan, is a street-smart investment banker who has made his way to the upper echelons of power. A man who unwittingly holds the key to India's destiny, Irrfan is a man consumed by his own obsessions, an extremely clever and unstoppable foe. Through a brilliant play of truth and pretense, Sanjay strips Irrfan of his arrogance and attitude, opens his heart and confounds his brain, locking him in a tangle beyond redemption... a tangle which can only be unraveled one way... leading to the biggest 'counter-heist' in the history of this nation.
