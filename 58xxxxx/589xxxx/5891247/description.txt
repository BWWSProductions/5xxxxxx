Winner of 5 Academy Awards, Kramer vs. Kramer is a ground-breaking drama about the heartbreak of divorce and struggle between work and family. Young husband and father Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) loves his family and his job, which is where he spends most of his time. When he returns home late on evening from work, his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) confronts him and then leaves him, forcing Ted becoming the sole caregiver to their six-old son. Now Ted must learn to be a father while balancing the demands of his high-pressure career. But just as Ted adapts to his new role and begins to feel like a fulfilled parent, Joanna returns. And now she wants her son back.
