,madmunk83,2010-11-27T01:40Z,It amazes me how unappreciative some of you guys are. If you don't like the efforts of TPB up loaders go to your local video store and buy the movies instead of whining all the damn time. They don't work for you and they don't tell you to get away from the computer and put your c*@k in something other than your hand do they ? Quit whining or start up loading your self and see if you can do it any better.....
