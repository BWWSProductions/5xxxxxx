I sure donâ€™t get many albums like this crossing my desk. Well, how many times have you been handed a Brazilian pop album with David Byrne, Bebel Gilberto, and Miho Hatori of Cibo Matto on it? That kinda thing certainly doesnâ€™t happen every day. Forro â€“presumably a northern mispronunciation of the English â€œfor allâ€â€“ was traditionally a trio playing an accordion, a triangle, and a drum â€˜nâ€™ mallet combo known as a zabumba. But times change, as they do, and Forro In The Dark is one of the modern expressions of the bubbly folk art.

Different cultures react to the human experience in unique ways. While blues may have been the heart of the American depression, Brazilians prefer to dance their worries away. David Byrneâ€™s English adaptation of â€œAsa Brancaâ€ (a song which, like â€œHey Joeâ€ is to psychedelic rock, is the standard of judgment for any forro band) may speak of a horrific drought in which all the trees and cattle died, but the bobbing, upbeat beat provided by a high strung acoustic guitar and pifano (flute) wonâ€™t let anyone drown in their sorrows. These people go out to get down, not to be depressed and look cool. Itâ€™s an admirable outlook, and one Iâ€™m totally incapable of, yet the vibe cast out by Bonfires of SÃƒÂ£o JoÃƒÂ£o is infectious nevertheless. Hell, if youâ€™re in the mood for it, this could be downright incapacitating. These guys must have one hell of a good stage show. Iâ€™d bet the farm on it.
