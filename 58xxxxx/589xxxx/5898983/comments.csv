P.S.: My savegames from previous releases turned out to be incompatible with this one - be aware of that!"
,TVippy,2010-10-26T21:35Z,"Thanks, man!"
,zytar,2010-11-02T03:52Z,"works well with 5.00 M33-6!

thanks!"
,zytar,2010-11-03T00:32Z,Seems to have some issue on saving images to the Memory Stick..
,NitrogenUA,2010-11-05T11:25Z,"Indeed it has. Saving data to MS is a common problem to most new games - 'Data install' does not work in almost every new game, same thing with the image saving. I can suggest using screenshot plugin, for instance - ScreenShotPNG_Plugin.prx also known as ScreenShotPNG Speedy, which i personaly use and it works like a charm."
,SupDotCom,2010-11-23T23:36Z,@nitrogenUA thanks but I get a black screen every time I start? any ideas? the only way I've found to bypass it is by pulling out my mem stick right at the start of the black screen and putting it back in. Is there any options or anything I should have on to preven the black screening?

,StupefyDR,2011-04-06T09:46Z,"Hey NitrogenUA, it's a very nice game. Just downloaded it and it was fast. It's really good. I just don't know why the CIRCLE button is the YES button and the X button is the NO button. But it's cool. :D"
,dragster8787,2011-05-03T08:04Z,@StupefyDR That's the Japaneese/American way of selecting.

,rom_ic3,2011-10-09T05:46Z,@HenryPL  dude i suggest to downgrade your CFW and change it to 5.50 GEN d-4 then upgrade it to 5.50 Prome-4 so u can play the games required to use 6.20 above CFW`s
