    Four American soldiers who are in Iraq are sent on a mission to          
    recover plates for printing 100 dollar bills that were used to print     
    a billion dollars. After doing the job and returning to the base         
    their commanding officer is killed in an explosion and the plates are    
    stolen by another operative. They would be court martialed and sent      
    to different prisons. 6 months later, the leader, Hannibal Smith is      
    visited by a CIA spook who tells him he knows where the man who took     
    the plates is and wants him and his men to recover it. So he helps       
    him escape and he breaks out the others and they go after the plates.    
    But after doing it, they discover that the spook might not be ok. And    
    a military intelligence officer who was involved with one of them is     
    pursuing them.
