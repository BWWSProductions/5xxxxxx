,TheMercO,2010-10-18T04:49Z,is this  jackass 3d?
[T],n2kmaster,2010-10-18T04:52Z,"I should reiterate as well this isn't the 3D release, however I don't think I've personally seen this one but i can confirm it isn't the 3D one, i didnt see any of the advertised scenes in this."
[T],n2kmaster,2010-10-18T04:54Z,"NEWS UPDATE! I Have found a lead on the 3D one, once i get it ill upload it as well."
[T],n2kmaster,2010-10-18T08:57Z,"Anyone who's checking seed numbers, dunno why this torrent isn't updating numbers, as of right now i can verify myself and a friend seeding this. May not be the 3D one but worth the watch none the less"
,TheMercO,2010-10-18T13:56Z,"is this jackass  2.5?
WEnt to see JA 3d   and i thought  2  was much better"
[T],n2kmaster,2010-10-19T18:18Z,"Naw its not 2.5 either, like i said i didn't even know there was a Volume 3 and i don't think its the season 3 release neither. Lotta new stuff tho i havent seen in this one so I hope everyone liked it. Another find looking for the 3D one."
,THCjuggalo,2010-10-21T20:22Z,this is Jackass: The lost Tapes
,THCjuggalo,2010-10-21T20:22Z,still a good one tho xD
[T],n2kmaster,2010-11-05T17:52Z,"I labeled it Volume 3 cuz that what it was labeled when i found it and when the intro credits start it says Volume 3, i never watched the Lost Tapes, but you could be right there."
