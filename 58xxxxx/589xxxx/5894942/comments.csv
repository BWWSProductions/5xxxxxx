,caiofcabral,2010-10-18T17:20Z,"Medal of Honor (Maybe More 3.42+ Required Games) on PS3 Firmware 3.41:

Edit Medal of Honor’s PARAM.SFO so it requires 3.41.
Replace Medal of Honor’s EBOOT.BIN with the one from UFC 2010 (do other games’ EBOOT work?).
Start the game, it should prompt you about an update, install it, then Medal of Honor should boot."

,crizano,2010-10-20T02:48Z,"i dont get why people complain about iso's, 

just extract the goddamn thing and put it in a BLUS-12345 based on whatever the .sfb file says.

very simple on the psj, quit fucking complaining.

thanks for this. "
,poeticpyro,2010-10-20T02:51Z,"So, the risk we take is it may upgrade our PS3 to 3.42 if we try to play the game?

If we use the hack, it SHOULD bypass it....is what I'm reading at least."
,crizano,2010-10-20T02:57Z,"if u edit the .sfo and replace the eboot.bin, i used UFC2010's, the only thing that should update is the game to 1.01. "

,poeticpyro,2010-10-20T04:35Z,"Yeah, I'm going to give it a shot.

,Quad-K,2010-10-24T03:02Z,Work on PL3 or hermes V4B? And recommended Manager? None have been as reliable as the original backup manager for me anyway.
,richto,2010-11-05T17:51Z,"Works fine on Latest PL3 and Latest GAIA Manager. No hacking about or manual editing required.

Folder seemed to be named ""PS3 GAME"" instead of ""PS3_GAME"", but renaming it fixed the problem."
,lfla,2010-11-05T21:04Z,"ATENTION: RENAME THE FOLDER ""PS3 GAME"" TO ""P3_GAME"
