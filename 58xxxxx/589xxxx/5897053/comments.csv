[T],on.off.on,2010-10-20T03:28Z,so how you like the quality? 
,lekkeralgemeen,2010-10-20T19:06Z,I'm still waiting for a nice movie you've ripped in 720p format. I actually don't like the movies you've ripped in 720p so far. When I find a movie I like you've ripped in 720p I will comment on the quality of the movie ;)
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-20T19:19Z,what is a nice movie? you gotta explain more 
,lekkeralgemeen,2010-10-21T01:23Z,"Well this is more like a movie I watch when I have lots of time. Other movies, for example Inception or The Hurt Locker of Avatar. Those big movies. I will download one of them to watch in HD. I'll watch this one just on my iPhone when having the time for it..."
,lekkeralgemeen,2010-10-21T01:25Z,"However, I do think it's great you upload these movies in HD and the time and effort you put in this. Other peoples will love to see this movie in HD, just not me ;)"
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-21T01:41Z,"okay got ya - ill do avatar =) Alot of people only download HD movies. their internet is getting faster and faster so people want HD.. also HDMI make it more fun to watch movies like mine on their sweetass LCD or LEC tv.
But mate if you can do me a favor and name some more superb and big movies you would like in HD i would love to make some for you. =)"
,lekkeralgemeen,2010-10-21T01:58Z,"Well how about Toy Story 3 (if you're not already doing it), The expendables. Please don't do the last airbender, it will be a waiste of time. But hey, your ups are great and I won't d/l a movie I don't like. So just up whatever you think is a great movie and there will always be alot of people thinking the same about your opinion here on TPB. Then everyone can decide for himself if he wants to d/l the movie or not. And btw, I think making rips of movies HR or PT (who seems to not be active anymore since HR came back, lol) already did is also a waiste of time. Because those movies were already done by someon in HD. I do have to say I also have a pretty fast internet connection and I like downloading HD movies, but I just download Iphone movies so I can watch them when in the bus or something like that. Unfortunately I can't take my big ass LED TV with me in the bus, so I have to stick to my iPhone 3GS btw. When I get iPhone 4 I'll download these rips, cuz iPhone 4 can handle them (I think) and 3GS can't :P"
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-21T02:18Z,okay noted but you cant really compare these with HR/PTs 720p rips as they are PS3 ready. These here are meant for pc's and wont work. plus they are smaller. now i have some movies to make so see you in a week lol
,lekkeralgemeen,2010-10-21T11:50Z,"BTW, if you want to make your movies look just like PT's and HR's, I would suggest the java program Tagger. It makes you add ratings and description and those sort of things to .m4v and .mp4 files. It's an easy to use program. Only problem is it will be hard to find on the net. I got it on my computer so I can make a torrent of it, but don't know whether you trust me enough to download it ;)"
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-21T20:58Z,nah but thanks for the tip mate =)
,asdfgwer,2010-10-22T15:46Z,"buddy if u could upload tagger, or a link to it, it would be great, cause i can only find tagger for mac on the net and i have windows..."
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-23T03:26Z,"@asdfgwer  try this :

,dzver666,2010-10-25T02:13Z,"Great job, though you could have used a smaller size a bit... tnx"
,Basnagus,2010-10-26T20:37Z,great quality .. thanx
