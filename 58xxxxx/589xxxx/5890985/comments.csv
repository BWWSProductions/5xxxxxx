,headtoy,2010-10-16T16:55Z,Thanks. Been waiting for this one:)
,Ambler,2010-10-17T06:21Z,"thanks dude, also eagerly awaited this one for ages!"
,sar007,2010-10-19T11:21Z,very slow :-(
,Rezen8,2010-10-20T05:44Z,Great Scott!!!
,Skram0,2010-10-28T08:35Z,"720p? What happened to the original released 1080p? This film is supposed to be a spectacular 1080p release.

It should be about 1920x1038? instead of 1280x696, slightly better than DVD. Thanks for the effort anyway.

From the link above:
""Hoo-boy, there may be some (unfounded) controversy with the image quality of these releases, so let the games begin! Let's state for the record that these new VC-1 encoded 1080p 1.85:1 Blu-rays present all three films with the best image quality they have ever had on home video."""
[V],-jonny-,2010-10-29T16:48Z,Skram. 1080p requires a much higher bitrate and a lot of computers (most) can't cope with it. And of course the filesize is much larger. That's why 720p is more popular for torrents.
,mshggh,2010-11-16T17:26Z,Anyone got info where to get subs?
,johnnytheboy,2010-11-23T15:18Z,thanx mate a goodn
,rickets007,2010-12-29T02:48Z,I see a couple people here have trouble with running 1080p on their computers. I use a Sempron processor with 1 gig ram. The trick is to get a half way decent graphics card. I use an ATI HD 4650 that was less than $45 and has HDMI out. You also need to use a player that will utilize your GPU such as Media Player Classic. It seems that VLC player relies entirely on the CPU so it won't work for older processors.
,Mathlol,2010-12-31T01:42Z,"Question for anyone following the comments.

-Stun made a good 1080p copy but I'd like to know what people's take on the acuity is before I download and compare:
Insinuendo's 720 @ 6600 to Stun's 1080 @ ~4400

Does the bitrate win or the resolution?"
,wackfiend,2011-01-01T09:51Z,Is there a particular reason the second film is ~4.7GB where as the first and third are ~7.0GB?
,wackfiend,2011-01-01T09:53Z,I actually just noticed in the info that the bitrate for the second movie is considerably lower. Why is that?
,Karza666,2011-02-16T01:19Z,Buttheads!
[V],big_dad_e,2011-02-22T00:34Z,"@Skram0
You contribute nothing except snarky comments.  STFU & GTFO!"
,Ponyoo,2011-06-01T17:21Z,God Bless @insinuendo
,boxorats,2011-07-07T05:04Z,"Thanks very much for these. If I may offer a comment, I felt the second film's bitrate was too low, as when the stormy sky near the beginning is kind of pixellated, for example -- I wished the second film had been a 6.5 gig file too since those (I thought) came out well. Enjoyed watching them all, thanks v. much!"
,JOR23,2011-11-08T03:46Z,Its a real bluray.a=10  v =10 thanks for your effort much appreciated!!
[T],MrDowntown,2011-11-18T07:17Z,"I cant seem to find a BTTF torrent that includes the Bluray Behind the scenes/deleted scenes???
