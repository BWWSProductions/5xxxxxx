Plot: This sumptuous series tells the story of the most extraordinary river in the world - the Ganges. 

Human life and nature bustle along her river banks, in a kaleidoscope of colour and energy in this 

dramatic BBC documentary. From man-hunting tigers to giant lizards, in Ganges the wildlife encountered 

is as diverse as the people. Traversing from the peaks of the Himalayas through frenetic cities to the 

teeming delta where the river meets the sea, this is a vibrant and colourful look at how the Ganges 

shaped the wildlife, culture and beliefs of India.

I have been downloading these episodes over 3 months at 0.1kb/s average finally stuck before being able 

to complete the 3rd episode... By chance I could eventually complete it with eMule (another couple of 

weeks more downloading) and I remuxed it from avi to mkv for convenience (keeping the H264 original 

video track). Finally I added and resynched english subtitles, the only language I could find around.

Please don't hit and run! Remember to seed up to at least 150% ratio (or more) so this beautiful 

torrent may be shared forever.

Om Shanti
