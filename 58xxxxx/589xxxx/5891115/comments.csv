,puppyup,2010-11-02T15:41Z,"Very good copy. Thank you! Just one thing: The display aspect ratio for Toy Story 1 + 2 is wrong. I noticed that the display size is given wrong in the MKV container. It can easily be fixed by simply opening the file with MKVmerge/MKVtoolnix, then select the video track and go to the format specific options. There you can change the value for width to 1280 pixels."
,puppyup,2010-11-03T20:53Z,"Is there a chance of ripping Finding Nemo (2003)? So far, there is no decent copy at reasonable file size out there. And TYNYFYD's copy has cut off sound at the end."
,rohit2707,2010-11-10T12:15Z,the rip is perfect.try playing it on vlc.

,mgandee,2011-05-28T02:21Z,"Anybody having trouble with the subs being locked, I don't even download the subtitle file but they still show up, seems to happen with some of RiddlerA's files"
,mgandee,2011-05-28T03:37Z,"Nevermind I fixed it, anybody else having this issue do this;

Download MKVToolNix(free program)
Put the MKV file into it
Deselect all the text options
Click Maux, it will only take around 20 seconds per movie so its not bad

I hate editing someone else's stuff but I didn't have a choice because the subs were forced in WMC, sorry RiddlerA

Thanks for the great ups
"
,X-machina,2011-07-29T19:14Z,im not getting any seed? 4.3%?
,raynover,2011-11-01T14:47Z,yes mgandee or you could simply turn the subs off through your player since theyre not hardcoded
