Ralph, the neighbor, notices that there is a kid who has a squeaky bike. He goes over to Jenni's house to help fix it for her son, who is away at the ex-husbands place for the weekend. She wants to thank him for his help, but he says that his wife is the one who really wanted him to be a good neighbor. It turns out that Jenni loves married men, and this one is no different. She is going to thank him and get herself off at the same time. Double bonus!
