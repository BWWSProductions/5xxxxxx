The film begins with a narration of the legend of an Indian monk and the wide-spread belief that his mummified remains have magical power. The Dark Stone gang, having found that half of the remains are in the prime minister Zhang's hands, sends assassins to kill him and his son Renfeng (Xiaodong Guo). Dark Stone's top assassin Drizzle (Kelly Lin) steals the remains and flees. She is encountered by the monk Wisdom, the best martial artist who points out Drizzle's swordmanship has fatal flaws and she can be killed by a master. Wisdom spends three months with her and finally sacrifices himself to be killed by Drizzle, in the hope to enlighten her. After Wisdom's death, Drizzle is burdened with sorrow and guilt and decides to leave her old way of life. She goes to a famous surgeon who changes her appearance and she assumes the identity of Zeng Jing (Michelle Yeoh). Zeng opens a market stall selling cloth. She attracts the attention of the messenger Ah-Sheng (Jung Woo-sung) whom she eventually marries. The Dark Stone, in the mean time, are still in pursuit of Drizzle and the remains. Their leader Wheel King (Xueqi Wang) recruits and trains a new assassin, Turqoise (Barbie Hsu), a merciless girl who is also a sex maniac.
