This torrent has a series of the main drawing titles which are available also in printing. To further your practice in drawing I also recommend you visit the following web site, www.posemaniacs.com, you will be able to exercise a study of the human figure on it. As it is such a good, free available tool, helping them them, you will help yourself and everybody. 

The books are a gathering of classical titles which will properly be a foundation for animation, design, comics and figurative drawing. There is many learning tools regarding digital, softwares but none art instruction were made available. This torrent will fill the gap. 

The files were compressed with a freeware application, Frog. Perhaps you should download it and use it.
