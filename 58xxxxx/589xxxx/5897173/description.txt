SAGRADO is one of Brasil's premier prog bands. This symphonic band which possesses an impressive instrumental palette
(violon, keyboards, guitar, flute, male & female vocals) uses it to play an hyper refined and fully symphonic music
with great attention to melody and arrangement. The music has many feel and mood changes, which add plenty of variety
to the sound. The violinist plays a major role in the sound giving the music a very rich quality.
It's as good as PREMIATA FORNERIA MARCONI or QUELLA VECCHIA LOCANDA but with an added Brazilian flavour.
