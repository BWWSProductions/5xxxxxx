I'm a recent convert (forced) to Win7 (Home Prem), and was heartbroken to find that none of my previous Nero progs would work for me; 7, 8 or 9 would not work (with the exception of Nero 8 Burning ROM), and I relied on Nero Vision heavily.  I tried all sorts of compatibility settings, uninstalling/reinstalling and restarting on Win7, and over many hours, but it got me nowhere.

Follow the installation instructions carefully in the file! I'm very pleased that, as of this moment, Nero Vision 10 from this file is running and appears to be working great!  Thank you, Bone!!  And thanks also to the seeders!  I'll always seed back my part...  =)"
,yelloo,2010-11-25T09:35Z,Thanks .BONE..
,kendell84,2010-11-29T13:37Z,"Thanks.

Working good so far.

,wierd-old-guy,2010-12-05T23:55Z,"PLEASE: if you want to keep this one alive DO NOT AUTO-UPDATE or even let it out of the Firewall.
A working #SN only lasts so long as people do not make screamingly public their ""test-drives"" of a program!"
,danindundas,2010-12-06T07:43Z,"Tested and seems to be working ok except for Nero Vision which when import .mp4 files, asks for Patent Activation.  Don't know how to get around this yet.

Anyone having the same problem?"
,jmmb,2010-12-09T08:13Z,"I had the exact same problem with with the ""Patent Activation"" but with .avi files. A quick restart after installation fixed this. The installer appears to have come from the nero site itself so everything looks squeaky clean. Works great, no problems, and its from a reliable source so definately worth the download. If you read and follow the ""install notes"" in a file entitled ""MEM"" you will have no issues. DO NOT AUTO-UPDATE and keep it quiet with your fire wall. Thanks man. Great work."
,bluereaper91,2010-12-22T11:51Z,Perfect! Thanks!
,arhidia,2011-01-04T14:08Z,just perfect...thanks m8
,R_Tyson,2011-01-05T04:23Z,"I Still seem to have the problem ""Patent Activation"" when I try to import .avi files to nero vision....I've even tryed to install twice and I tried to restart directly after but it still doesn't seem to be working...any help with this would be much appreciated."
,skullmonk3y,2011-01-20T21:12Z,"R Tyson =  Try reinstalling after running the Nero cleanup tool (download it direct from Nero).

.BONE. =

Works perfectly on my W7 64 system. THANKYOU!!!!"
,MICR0S0FT,2011-01-24T08:18Z,"Excellent up! On my old school Dell it only took
about 30 minutes for me to install EVERYTHING.

I actually had to go into my firewall and choose
advanced settings > outgoing rules > then click on new rule (on the right side) and just block
each Nero program that was installed. Only took
about 7 minutes to do that part.

OS: Win 7 Ultimate 32-bit"
,pezed,2011-03-03T08:22Z,"You are the MAN! Thanks
A couple of notes Windows Vista 32 bit
Once I installed and plugged in main sn# it asked me to reboot for changes to take effect before i did  this I went to advanced firewall to block nero but none were listed I also used windows defender and removed it from auto start. After re-boot nero was in fire wall. I did have a patent activation message when using nero vision. It was because I missed one of the plugin #'s. Not before I tried to delete online services (This does not work) nero just reinstalls it. 

Note: You can go to programs-nero and delete auto update contents (not the folder just what's in it) then auto update will not work even if you try from control center. 

Note: To add plugin sn#'s go to StartSmart in the top lef tcorner under Nero  there is a black/grey circle (page inside a circle) with an arrow next to it click on set serial add all of the plugin sn#'s (maybe its me but this is one shit ass icon for such an important function and such a good program this is what screwed me up. They should have made it Red)stay away from templates and anything else that may connect you to Nero.

I'm not  any kind of computer wiz this is just what happened to me maybe it will save smeone some grief 

Thanks again, Bones "

,ToasterToad,2011-08-13T10:41Z,Install was easy and it works great.
,truth101,2012-03-17T15:49Z,March 17 2012 - I followed the instructions and it actually worked perfectly. I tried all the other nero torrents and this is the only one that truly worked for me. (windows xp) Thanks to the uploader for making my life a better place... Happy St Patrick's Day!
