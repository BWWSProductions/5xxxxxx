,hitman585,2011-01-15T23:20Z,is this in rus only?
,neoraistlin,2011-01-16T20:14Z,"This is most defiantely a RUS only install. However, I have found the way to convert it to English.

Follow the installation instructions completely as recommended. The installed game will be in RUS and is playable.

Now download the NWN2 Patcher by tnt 220 found here http://vnfiles.ign.com/nwvault.ign.com/fms/files/nwn2tools/12/nwn2patcher.zip

Download the English Update ""nwn2_pcx1_english_from1221588_to1231763"" from the following link http://nwvault.ign.com/fms/Download.php?id=142400
  -I know the cracked version already has a patch that updates it fully, but re-running this patch overwrites some of the RUS dialog (but not all of it)

Use the NWN2 Patcher to install the .RTP file that is extracted from the nwn2_pcx1_english_from1221588_to1231763 archive

Download the file ""Kaedrin's PrC Pack v1.40.4"" from the link http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=NWN2HakpaksOriginal.Detail&id=209
  - You can install this pack using his installation instruction (it really is a good thing as it has numerous bugfixes)
  - Alternatively, all we need is the dialog.tlk that is found in the root directory of this archive
Copy the dialog.tlk from Kaedrin's PrC Pack v1.40.4 into C:\My Documents\Neverwinter Nights 2

Lastly browse to your installation directory (mine was D:\Games\Neverwinter Nights 2, but your will likely be different). In the root directory there are three dialog files: dailog.tlk, dialogF.tlk, and dialog_old.tlk
  - The dialogf.tlk is for languages that have different dialog for male and female genders. We will remove this file by deleteing it or renaming it to dialogf.bak
  - The dialog.tlk should be replaced with the same dialog.tlk from Kaedrin's PrC Pack v1.40.4 which was copied into C:\My Documents\Neverwinter Nights 2
  - I left the dialog_old.tlk alone

That's what I have done and it has worked for me. So far all the menus, text, and spoken dialogue is in English."
,Farhe,2011-02-28T04:01Z,The key generator isn't working.  Tried it at least 20 times and some pop-up in Russian keeps showing.  I am just making a wild guess here but I think it is probably saying Invalid.  Any suggestions?
