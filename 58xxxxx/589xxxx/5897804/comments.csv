,littlered29732,2012-01-04T04:49Z,I'm looking for a very old classic with Jane Russell called The French Line was wondering if you could help me please?
[T],Jonzee,2012-04-05T14:44Z,"@Littered29732, This one is pretty rare and no DVD release yet. Youtube has some postings of the film, and Amazon sells the VHS copy. I am afraid the best thing is to wait for a studio print release on DVD? Jane Russel is great and I wish I could find a decent copy of this one also!"
