      VLC  and a few other players are the most versatile and, generally speaking,
      good - but quality is 10-20% lower.

What is the best player for perfect quality playback? For an average computer and for a decent gaming computer? Both with win7. Thank's ahead of time. 
Without a doubt your the best small sized encoder out there."

""I recommend 
      and have used one system for years - CoreAVC for H264 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4787782/
      (""Deblocking"" set to ""Standard"") and part of DivX7-8 for AAC - 
      AAC DirectShow filter.""
""      New DivX8 is maybe 18% slower than Core AVC and very common, 
      and in order to use DivX8 H264 and AAC DS filters outside DivX7 or 8 player 
      (as in Windows Media Player or Media Player Classic), Haali spliter 
      must be installed. ""

      ""TIP: Switch back and forth between Core AVC and DivX H264 DS filters by marking
      and un-marking Core AVC ""Preferred decoder"" setting."""
