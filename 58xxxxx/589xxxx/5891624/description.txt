IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Red DVDSCR VOBS .............Thanks Diamond
AUDIO:Red DVDSCR VOBS .............Thanks Diamond

Right heres our first rip of this nice dvdscr... this one is with the top line of text cropped the other shall be uncropped. There is also text, 2 lines at the bottom on and off throughout the film. Source was pretty nice... seen better dvdscrs but also seen alot worse so :P For this we made a small script containing, crop, resize, whitebalance, brightness, contrast, sharpness, chroma... Just thought the source needed some life adding to it mainly and a touch more colour and brightness... The audio we kept the original track and just muxed it to our encode :)

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
