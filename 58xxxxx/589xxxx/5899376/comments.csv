,billybob45,2010-11-24T05:17Z,warning these titles are long so roxio dvd burning software wont burn them as file names are over 106 characters ! so u need to delete part of the names to be able to burn them to a dvd to back them up..im just deleting the numbers before each title..what are the numbers for? eg some filling system or catalogue system?...its gonna take at least 1 hour to edit all these..does any1 know of a dvd burning software that burns more than 106 characters?
,billybob45,2010-11-24T07:27Z,it took me 3hours to edit all the titles to remove the numbers and which university press each books from ! had to do it or my dvd burning software would not start the burn..who ever uploaded this did a really bad job..uploaders always test burn your uploads ! keep titles for each file under 106 characters so popular dvd burning software like roxio works.
