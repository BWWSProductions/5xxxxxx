Plot: Cherubic, adorable, and precocious Priscilla Williams lives in Colonial India with her dad, a Colonel, and mom, Joyce. She is permitted to mingle with the soldiers. One day she befriends an Indian by the name of Khoda Khan, who in turn tells her about a prisoner named Mohammaudin. She meets with this prisoner, and finds him quite approachable and friendly. Then Mohammaudin breaks out, and joins a band of militants who are all set to attack the British forces. Fearing loss of lives, Priscilla sneaks into the camp of this band, locates Mohammaudin, who is their leader, and attempts to try and talk him out of attacking the British. She does not know that Mohammaudin and his men have plans to use her as bait in order to force the British to give in to their demands.
