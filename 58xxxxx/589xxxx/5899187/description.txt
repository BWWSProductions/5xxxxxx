Because Sygate Personal Firewall (SPF) works only in Windows XP and cannot be installed in Windows 7 ...I think this is the only reasonable alternative that remains for use in x64 Windows versions

Using this is similar to SPF (in Normal User Mode) â€“ Simple yet Efficient and it supports Windows 7

If you have tried using Comodo Firewall and found it a bit too complex to handle, then use this.

Easy to configure with normal and expert user modes
* Normal User Mode offers a simplified interface for basic users to protect their computers when connected to the Internet or any other network. All you need to do is to choose which applications are allowed access to the Internet/network.
* Expert User Mode provides a highly configurable interface for advanced expert users to allow greater control over how your computer and applications connect and interact with the Internet/network. Expert user mode gives you additional options to create custom rules for applications and to control traffic at port-level.
