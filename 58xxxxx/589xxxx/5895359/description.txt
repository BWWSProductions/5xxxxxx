   Three years after the invasion of Iraq the country was in turmoil.   
   Insurgents had mounted a brutal resistance against the allied        
   forces, seeing them as invaders not saviours. At the same time       
   religious groups within the country were waging war against each     
   other. This situation created a major opportunity for Al Qaeda to    
   gain a foothold inside Iraq. In part two of this remarkable series   
   we hear how Sunnis first courted, then turned on Al Qaeda and how    
   the U.S. changed its strategic policy. It's a brutal story filled    
   with violence, intrigue and duplicity, all told by the people at the 
   heart of the                                                         
   struggle.
