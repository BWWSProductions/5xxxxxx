A Delightful Double Feature Of Favorite Family Fables.


Children's author Dr. Seuss and veteran animator Chuck Jones. Both are uniquely gifted legends, so it's no wonder that their collaborations, How The Grinch Stole Christmas and Horton Hears A Who!, instantly became all-family classics of animation, won Peabody Awards - and are nothing short of wonderful.

Boris Karloff magnificently narrates the saga of the crotchety Grinch, who tries to rob the happy holiday from the Whos as they snooze. Just his opposite is Horton, the elephant with a huge heart. Hans Conried narrates as the plucky pachyderm protects the tiny Whovillians from impending disaster.

Full of fantastical creatures, tongue-twisting verse and joyous songs, this Seuss/Jones double-bill is a joyous festival of fun.
