,jvezirian,2011-04-12T20:48Z,"How to install Microstation and get the damn thing to work!!!!!!!!

Well worked for me!!! ""And on Windows 7""

These are the instructions from the one I downloaded, sorry I forget the site.

1. Install Setup_Prerequisites_08.09.03.06_en.exe

2. Install MicroStation_08.09.03.06

3. Extract Patch.rar into \Program Files\Bentley\MicroStation\ (extract all of the 

contents, there is an additional rar file here, extract it too, this is where it 

messes up I think, but this is what I did and it worked!!!!!!!!!!)

3a. After extracting all the files I copied them into the Microstation folder, yes 

let it overwrite any and all files that come up!!!!!!!

3b.  In windows 7 you need to go to C/Windows/system 32 and the License.xml file is 

there, well that is where my computer put it. It was the only one, and I viewed it 

and it had all the microstation data. Copy this file to the microstation folder, do 

not try to use the method below!!!!!!!!!! If you try to use the Utility to find it in 

System 32, it does not see the file!!!!!


4. Right Click patcher.bat and run as ""Administrator"" A DOS WINDOW WILL OPEN REAL 

FAST AND GO AWAY...

5. Run the ""License Tool"" from inside the Microstation folder, ""DO NOT"" run 

microstation first as described IN OTHERE DOWNLOADS!!!!!!!!

6. It will say no server found or something like that, just click ok. Now select 

import, as described and browse to the License.xml file you copied into the 

Microstation folder.

Choose ""File | Import"" and browse to license.xml in \Program Files\Bentley

\MicroStation\. It should say ""License Import Succeeded""

7. You will also then recieve this message:""Failed to retrieve a list of available 

licenses"".... just click ok and close the license utility window.

8. Run microstation and open a default drawing of something and it should work, no 

warnings for me."
