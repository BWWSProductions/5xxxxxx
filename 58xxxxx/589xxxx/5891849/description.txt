Season 5, Episode 15: Cyborg
Original Air Date 16 February 2006
After being released from a prison in a laboratory of Luthorcorp's Cyntechnics by sympathetic scientist Dr. Hong, former Smallville High football player Victor Stone is chased by armed security guards and hit by Lana's truck, without any harm. The car is totally destroyed, Lana wounds her forehead and Victor takes her to a hospital. Lana calls Clark, and he meets Victor, who played football with him in high-school and died a year ago in a car crash. Victor explained that he became a living machine as part of the machine project researched by the evil Dr. Allister Krieg sponsored by Luthorcorp. Further, he misses his girlfriend Katherine. Clark promises to help him and visits Lex, who lies and tells Clark that he was not aware of the project. Meanwhile, Martha is blackmailed with a DVD showing Clark on a security camera rescuing the unconscious Lana from the warehouse explosion (from episode 'Lockdown') and Lionel offers to help her find the blackmailer.
