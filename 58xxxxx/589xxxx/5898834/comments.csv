,sbm_from_la,2010-10-20T22:03Z,Thanks for the upload... I took a quick glance and noticed the quality is HORRIBLE.  Either the person who created this file was a noob or the original source was bad to begin with.  I'd recommend waiting for a better looking version unless you're desperate and don't care.
,DeepPirate,2010-10-20T23:14Z,"I would not say it's horrible.  Some aliasing, but not all that bad ff you watch it in a resolution at or below 1600x900.

Thanks for the up!"
,allzeds,2010-10-20T23:22Z,"It's not the best quality, but it's far from horrible! I'll probably grab a new copy of this once it airs, but I can't complain about seeing the 1st episode 11 days early."
,hexagontk,2010-10-21T01:53Z,"Confirmed Real - Using MPC with ffdshow Postprocessing and scaling up to fit the whole screen it looks pretty damn good. Not as good as a DVDscr but better any Cam/TS, reminds me of a few VHS conversions I've seen.

Based on what I just saw, I will be telling everyone how great this series is, this release will build the buzz for the premier. Maybe that's why it was released, seeing as this uploader has no other torrents. I will want to see this again in HD format, and it's already on my must buy list when the DVDs are released."

,dracownsu,2010-10-24T08:19Z,"Thanks for the upload, Still throwing a viewing party when it comes out for real tho. 

AS to worries of canceling, from what Ive heard it has ALREADY been renewed for a second season, Which will be DOUBLE the episodes. 

A very very good sign indeed."
