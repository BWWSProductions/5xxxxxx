     Ã› Ã› being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete        Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› control of this desert oasis. It's a place where the right     Ã› Ã›

     Ã› Ã› As you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave          Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› Wasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched      Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› Vegas Strip, you'll be introduced to a colorful cast of        Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› characters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated    Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› creatures and much more. Choose sides in the upcoming war or   Ã› Ã›

     Ã› Ã› a Reputation System that tracks the consequences of your       Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› actions, and the aptly titled Hardcore Mode to separate the    Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› meek from the mighty. Special melee combat moves have been     Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› added to bring new meaning to the phrase "up close and         Ã› Ã›
