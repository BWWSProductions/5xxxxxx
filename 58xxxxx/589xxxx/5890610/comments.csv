Remember Srebrenice!"
,knattern,2011-06-07T21:41Z,it's a movie you dickhead. obviously you did not seem to understand the whole message of the movie. and more obvious: you seem to be some some guy full of ethnic hatred.
,surutkadechernobyl,2011-08-28T19:41Z,"Not only does this movie not take sides in relation to the bloody Balkan conflict (as implied by some misguided person above), it also presents war as being made up of the people who are simultaneously victims and perpetrators of the violence...it is poignant without being literal or condescending, a quality that Holywood war movies never seem to get quite right. There are no heroes here, just people trying to claw their way out of hell. â€œA pessimist thinks that things canâ€™t get worse; an optimist knows that they can.â€ Definitely Tanovic's best film."
