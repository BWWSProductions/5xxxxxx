   Do you know what a DTS soundtrack is? The audio bitrate jumps to roughly 1.5 megabytes per second as opposed to the standard Dolby Digital with is about 640kbs. The difference is noticeable though.The disparity in volume between dialogue and a gun shot for example, is far more realistic. DTS is just amazing. 

 To GoodFilms- thank you! I do have a question though. In regards not only to this release, but others as well (such as Black Swan), why is the film grain effect so prominent? Is it how the original source was? I cannot remember if the film was like that on my DVD version. (Haven't opened any of my DVD cases in years :-)  ) Only curious...thanks for a great upload! 
A 10/ V 10."

This uploader together with someone like insinuendo is one of the few that actually upload true HD quality, instead of spamming the highres section with miscategorized blurry re-re-encodes. Thank you for that and fuck the small files!"
,lattari,2012-04-15T19:11Z,Also as the title suggest the ripper is not him but a scene group that based on their track record does indeed know very well what they are doing.
