,juliokarl,2011-03-13T19:25Z,"i installed game from
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5407062/Supreme_Commander_2-Razor1911.iso
did updates 15+16, now even 18 i got from a different site.
Then installed battle pack, all good no errors.
When i start game i get a checkbox ""enable DLC content in Skirmish and multiplayer"" which suggests that dlc has been installed.
But There are ni new campaigns in singleplayer mode nor can i find anything.
Is this pack only for multiplayer, am i overseeing something ?
Version 1.250 through update 18 skidrow"
,bizmark2000,2011-04-05T15:14Z,"Supreme Commander 2 v1.250 Definitive edition = http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6237979/Supreme_Commander_2_v1.250_Definitive_edition

JUST INSTALL AND PLAY- that Simple, its already cracked and patched.

This game is currently Working, Checked and Tested it. And it works Fine, even better then fine, no buggs at all.

Several things you need to remember:
The installation is so easy that it doesn't need a guide. Just read what it's asking you and press next. It's that easy.

Here are the steeps for really NUUB people.
- First step Install Steam and make an account. then Logoff from steam when installing this crack.
- Mount game
- Choose Language
- If it asks, install Net frame If it doesn't skip this step.
- Tic to install DirectX, Visual C++ and SmartSteam
- Choose Steam Version ( Online Multiplayer ) To play ONLINE.
- When you get the Windows Command (window) do not close until you se the text that it's done and press any key to close. ( The installation is slow so be be patient )
- Mini window will pop up and ask you to choose language. Choose language and close it.
- When the installation is done.
Start (SmartSteam) then to start the game go to Star - All programs - Supreme Commander 2 - And press on (Play.exe)

You are done now. and can play Online with others.

Spread the word ---- "
,Driehoek,2011-04-16T23:04Z,"Awesome, thanks Wilimaw!"
,ihatejuggy,2011-06-05T19:01Z,"Everything works perfectly, multiplayer as well. Just follow the instructions given with the file (for single player or multi player versions). Im using the definitive edition mentioned by Bizmark2000.

Online play is the tricky part as there is a very very small online pirate community for this version and it'll be a good 1 month or so before you even see a server or another player. (Always showing 440etc players online but 0 severs scanned or if you are hosting NO-ONE EVER LOGS ON!!!)

The solution is the join the steam group "" Machine/Awesome "" and use it to track fellow smartsteam supreme 2 underground players / invite them to your games.

My in-game alias is Falcon1.

Thanks uploader and thanks razor. "
,streetbum149,2011-06-08T06:41Z,i HIGHLY recommend downloading the definitive edition mentioned above. it was probably the most easy pirated material ive ever installed.
,Rsniper2,2011-07-11T17:54Z,"It doesn't work for me, I probably did something wrong. 
I have Supreme Commander 2 installed inside the main steam folder in:
Steam/steamapps/common/supreme commander 2
I ran the installer to the supreme commander 2 folder, it finishes within a minute. Steam was not running at all while installing.
I press Play in my Steam library, once in game nothing changed (playing vs bots in skirmish) I dont see any new maps available or any new units. Please help :(
