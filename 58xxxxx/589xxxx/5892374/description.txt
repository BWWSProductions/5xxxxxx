***********************************************************
All films were personally encoded from original DVDs and keeping original AC3 audio tracks.

Al where encoded keeping original resolution (720x480 or 720x 576 depending on source) using "crf 20" and "preset slower". This means that there is a very marginal loss of quality with respect to the original DVD, only perceptible if you do a careful frame by frame inspection. To the naked eye there is no loss. What is clear is the reduction in size which is around 1/4th or the original.

The guaranteed delivery is original English audio (AC3) + English subs + Spanish subs. However, around 20 of the films also contain Spanish audio (re-encoded to mp4/AAC-HEv2 48kbps) and French subs (roughly 22 of the 24 films contain it).
 
You can see the details of each film in the MediaInfo.txt file included.

If you can please post this torrent on other sites.

Enjoy, share, and be patient during original release 10/10.
