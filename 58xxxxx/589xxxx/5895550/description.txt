"Casualties of War"

The biological threat intensifies. The 
CDC rushes to identify the contagion and 
treat the infected people, while the 
White House and Director of National 
Intelligence (Eljko Ivanek) face a 
difficult dilemma in their negotiation 
with Thomas (Clifton Collins, Jr.). 
Meanwhile, Simon (Ian Anthony Dale) 
appeals to Sophia (Laura Innes) to turn 
on Thomas. Elsewhere, FBI Agent Collier 
(guest star Heather McComb) closes in on 
Vicky (Taylor Cole) and Carter (guest 
star D.B. Sweeney), but appearances are 
not always what they seem.

Enjoy :)
