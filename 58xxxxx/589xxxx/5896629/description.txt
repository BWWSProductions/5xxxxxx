in the near-future, people can enhance their bodies, replacing any damaged organ with artificial replacements. There's one catch: it's expensive, and if you can't keep up with the payments your body parts will be repossessed by the 'Repo Men'... with painful and bloody results!

Jude Law plays Remy, one of the best Repo Men. When he falls behind on the payments for his new heart, his old partner Jake (Academy Award winner Forest Whitaker), is sent to hunt him down and rip his new heart out.

Now that the hunter is the hunted, Remy joins Beth (Alice Braga) on the run across a landscape populated by friends and foes, becoming a champion for thousands like him, on the run from the Repo Men.
