[T],Oceanhawk,2010-10-28T04:28Z,"I need some advice RiddlerA or anyone else (that knows)... Nero is giving me big problems overall (maybe its just the ""version"" i have) I just want to put all the movies i download on DVD's so they dont eat up all my memory. But they come in all different formats. So my question is what would you recomend for me to get in order to recode and burn them to DVD's. Am i missing another kind of software besides recoding and burning?.  Can someone PLEASE E-mail me and explain what i need john26pl@gmail.com  (only because im not sure if i will find this exact place again to read the comment, but post here if u dont want to Email. thanks alot)"
,squallzy,2010-11-07T13:25Z,"Use a program called ""Handbrake"" to convert your mkv's ^_^"
