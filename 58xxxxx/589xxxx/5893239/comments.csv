,captainbarbossa,2010-10-19T18:25Z,Please Seed! I have been stuck around 15kbs. At this rate it will take me a week. Thank You.
,QborT,2010-10-19T18:46Z,"Turn your upload speed up and your download speed should increase (or alternately you are uploading too much and this is hogging all your bandwidth).... 

Here is my tip for all you leeching seed beggars.

Turn it up slightly and your speed WILL increase."
,captainbarbossa,2010-10-19T20:29Z,Yeah I typically play around with the upload speed but if Im uploading less then around 2mbs Im usually good on my dls. But I did finish this movie and it is definately real! V:10 A:10!
,soflocomm,2010-10-19T21:07Z,I use utorrent? Are other torrent clients faster? If not are there special setting I should put besides the upload speed
,shinobiXRT,2010-10-21T01:51Z,"what a shit film, for people who definitely masturbate way too much."
,shifty420,2010-10-23T03:29Z,"@shinobi what a shit comment, for people who don't have any common sense and might possibly be retarded. "
,chrome66,2010-10-24T04:58Z,"@captainbarbossa, damn, I'm lucky if I get 1mb. I usually am at 400kb/s. I use BT 7. What do you guys think... should I switch to U-torrent or Bitcomet? Which is the best i.e. fastest? 

BTW< thank UA for DL'ing this. A couple friend told me it was really good like Blair WItch but with a big surprise halfway through. Some1 commented it sucked. Must be some kid. What do the rest of you think?"
,shifty420,2010-10-25T07:29Z,"good quality. and the movie was very interesting. i won't say more, too much to spoil. it just wasnt what i was expecting but it is very engaging. "
,blurrybigfoot,2010-10-25T22:44Z,"If you appreciate documentary films, both from a story and production side, you will enjoy Catfish.

I didn't think I was watching a GREAT movie when I viewed it, but this is the type of documentary that stays with you.  I've watched it three times now and can say, I really like this movie.

But I'm a documentary fan so I might be biased.

Kudos to the filmmakers."
