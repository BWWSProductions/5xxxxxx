.::Plot Summary::.
Witches are individuals with special powers like ESP, telekinesis, mind
control, etc. (not the typical hogwart and newt potions). Robin, a craft
user, arrives from Italy to Japan to work for an organization named STN
Japan Division (STN-J) as a replacement for one of STN-J's witch hunters
who was recently killed. Unlike other divisions of STN, STN-J tries to
capture the witches alive in order to learn why and how they became witches
in the first place.
