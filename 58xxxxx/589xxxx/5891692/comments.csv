,ramsfootball599,2010-10-28T00:32Z,by the way im using power iso and also tried the demonlite that came with it too..im probably just doing it wrong i  would appreciate the help
[V],Big_dude,2010-10-30T06:22Z,"mount on a virtual drive open up windows media player and select drive or dvd should work

or just burn the iso with imgburn on a blank dvd-r watch on your dvd player"
,steelllynx,2012-04-23T00:03Z,run the video_ts.ifo that should start the player.  media player classic comes with k-lite mega codec pack.
