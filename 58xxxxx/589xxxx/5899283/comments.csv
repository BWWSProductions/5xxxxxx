,crossebby,2010-10-21T08:36Z,"sorry for X2 comments, this IE9 is shit."
,Netarangi,2010-10-21T08:55Z,Awww 4gig. Too big for me to download. :(
[V],globeplus,2010-10-21T09:22Z,"To crossebby : the IE9 is in beta stage , this new version have some new additions following the philosophy of other browsers , it is like the IE producers realised that some funcionalitys that you can use in some other browsers wasnÂ´t that bad and of course additionating that to all the  nice work that was already normal at the IE8 . Ok this the general lines about this new version of the IE but still beta stage and if for one side this new nice extra funcionalitys are positive for other side inside sites that the user normaly make a login can get circunstancial inconveniences that wasnÂ´t happen with the IE8 , so i hope the definitive version of the IE9 have this new extra nice features but keeping the stability on the general web surfing including in sites that the user must login to use , they can say this site or that one is ok and they probably can be right but more than 50% of the sites that need a login from the user can have more circunstancial inconveniences than with the IE8 , so the conclusion is very simple the IE9 still need to improve on the general stability , ok this is what i think about the IE9 beta and thank you for beeing a nice regular user of my files but independtly of how many games you got you need to decide what game you want to play and finish him or otherwise is more tough to play all the games at the same time . Thank you and happy gaming to you no matter is the game ..."

[V],DeGun,2010-10-21T11:24Z,"@@ GLOBEPLUS : hey mate let me know u ain't  french are ya ? You got what it takes to upgrade your skull to VIP , therefore it is important that your torrents are perfect , all included ya know
(pgn - mini config. , At least Eng. instructions no passworded RAR etc...) - is this the case on all your torrents ?"
[V],globeplus,2010-10-21T12:57Z,"Because the answer to DeGun comment is to long i think i need to divide in 2 or 3 parts . Thank you for understand .
PART 1 : To DeGun : please , for not beeing looking just talk get some of my files and check that all the files have an appropriate instructions.txt and the work very clean , i am against virus files beside that i have to recognise that the guys from the cracks need to change a little bit the structure from the dlls or the executables to make the work correctly and because the excedent of information on the scripts of some anti-virus in prevention of possible threads to the users , any file presenting a little different structure can be recognised as a virus , so it is recommendable many times to disable the antivirus to the users and in the case of the popular AVG , the disable of the protection shield is enough normaly for any possible worked files not be recognised for the antivirus , this is what you can call for this specific situations , a not so good thing that is needed but always have in mind that the worked dlls or executables really donÂ´t cause any harm to the computer , they can be recognised as a virus because the worked structure to run the games and thatÂ´s it , about my files itself i keep the best competent work as possible keeping the full game more as possible making always without exception a correct analysis first before doing and present the work , of course that for this type of work (pratical files) sometimes depending on the files of the games it is possible a better work in some games than others , other times the work is only the enough possible , my first principle is no matter is the quantity of the work is to keep the gameplay intact more as possible , in one or another ocasion it is true that a correction can be needed here and there because the files of the game itself or because a circunstance that ununexpectly didnÂ´t make sense (to be continued)"
[V],globeplus,2010-10-21T12:59Z,"PART 2 : looking to the generality of the work but in all the years that i am uploading nice pc games files , i never not a single time , turned away my back to help the users that got an justificated ununexpected problem in the file , i can say looking at the generality of the game files that i uploaded , that maybe in close 5% of the uploads circunstancial extra corrections was needed and when that happen i never leave it the users without an appropriate help or answer , doing pratical files with competence , is a kind of compromise between me and the possible users and i know that the first rule is to keep the gameplay more as possible but making pratical files is to make decisions and sometimes to get a better possible size it is possible to concede in a little aspect or another about the work but of course keeping the gameplay intact more as possible , ok just to finish my work is decent and competent more as possible beside that i have to recognise that this type of work need more care and work than simply uploading the original pc-dvd isos , i have games that beeing fast and knowing very well my work i needed close 12 hours or more until i get the file , so making competent pratical files is nice and save lot of hard disk space most of the cases but it is also lot of work , my work is presentable and decent more as possible no doubt and my intention is to keep like that . Thank you for your interest in my work , at least gived to me an opportunity to talk a little bit more clear about the work on the pratical files . thank you .

[V],globeplus,2010-10-21T18:47Z,"FILE NEWS .: with all the respect from the skidrow work and i think he did it with the best of intention , it is ununcessary to my file the UPDATE1 now available , why ? because all the installed files on the update this file user already have with the normal file + dlcÂ´s pack , the conteud of this update 1 is :
InstallScript.vdf that is the same as on the game file , exactly the same script , then the 4 dlcs that the users can download and apply for less than 11 mega in a easy way on the game folder and the next file on the Data folder of the game folder : FalloutNV.esm with 239.815 kb that is exactly the same that is already on the current game folder , so if the user of this file download and include the dlcÂ´s pack , with the install of this update 1 the user will simply didnÂ´t get a single new file on the game folder and all the included files on the update are already available at the game folder . Thank you and sorry for something if it is the case but in a case like this is my duty to inform the users of the file about this update or i get the risc of beeing asked about a link including this update or something .

[V],globeplus,2010-10-22T12:32Z,"Ti naraku00 : if it was removed i certainly say it , i don´t have nothing to hide about the work from the users ."
[V],globeplus,2010-10-22T12:47Z,"to pulkit007 : i can suggest 2 options and i explain :
1 - freearc , with possibility of a little bit higher compression but needing generally speaking more ram to extract
2 - 7zip , nice compression and not too much ram necessary for the extraction but the general indicators of highest compression a little lower than freearc but with exceptions where for some type of files can be better than the freearc 
so , resuming any of this 2 alternatives are valid and with any of them the compressions will be generaly positive , the user must analise under the files to compress what can be the best option , other final option is to compress with both and see what gives the best compression work for the current file .
I hope this help you for that task but you canÂ´t compare a normal compression with the generality of my work because in my files the compression is absolutly the last thing to do after all the possible necessary work be done on the file but certainly will help you save hard disk space to the files that you already have , i can suggest in extension of that idea the next 2 things : 1 - using a external hard drive where you can move the games , some are a kind of cheap for the possible storage size , for 150 or 200 gb external hard drives , some models have a real nice price 
2 - buy packs of 50 disks of the 4.7 gb discs dvd+r or dvd-r , they are not too expensive in packs like that and you get space for 50 or more games just for a pack depending of course on the size of the games , with my files it is always saving space no matter what and many games with more than 10 gb , many times after the work you record to very banal 4.7 gb discs .
Now is up to you , you have now plenty of options to get space for wherever you want in your computer and your games in hand in a nice way anyway ."

I removed the regfile manually as I thought potentially it is the problem, but after removal falloutnv. still flat out crashes on me even with administrator access.

Yes, my drivers are fully updated as of yesterday
Yes, Direct X is updated
Yes, the extract folder w/ successful globe convert is on the desktop as it should be

Its quite perplexing on why it simply crashes."

To Xemonlemon : disable the antivirus and restart your computer and start the extraction and conversion work again for not getting background applications interfering with any of the works , close 1 gb ram is necessary to execute this tasks correctly and when you are doing them donÂ´t use any other applications preferencially to reducing to the minimum possible interferences executing them , so be patient and do everything correct again .

[V],globeplus,2010-10-24T03:35Z,"To blaze 69 : my friend , sometimes in some games and under some specifities get the game absolutly fine for everyone can be a little tough , most of the cases that is possible but in some cases little circunstancial things can be needed to help depending on the cases the users , many nice pc games out there have full lists with possible errror messages that can happen to the users and this for who buy real copys , so having users with circunstancial problems is a kind of normal but of course always with the intention of them get the game running fine soon as possible  , all the work that in some way can contribute to help any users with circunstancial difficulties to run the game is appreciated , we know that not all the games run without any problem and in the torrents we need to have our attention even higher to have the game ok , so thank you for your contribution with another thing that can help the users to run the game if it is the case , for me was a kind of tough analyse that because without installation i really donÂ´t have a single problem with the file like it is , the game start quick and normal and after start the dlcs are addicionated with naturality to the game on the inventory , so everything nice and easy , but the point is that everything that can help more the users to run the game is appreciated ."
[V],globeplus,2010-10-24T05:35Z,"To 32 bits users specially :  uers like partysam reported that the update 2 can help running the game , i understand the dificulties getting the worked executables totally correct and in some games slight things can be happen to help on the stability of the game , in my case 7-64 bits i donÂ´t have a single thing to say , looks everything perfect but certain circunstances relationated to to the executable itself , maybe the worked executable needs some extra stability depending on the computer bits machine , so 32 bits users with circunstancial difficulties get the update 2 and check if helped to run the game and if it is always possible and maybe it is not the case to backup the current game folder before try it but probably this update can be positive , to 64 bits users i donÂ´t think the probability of this type of 
problems can happen but that is easy to check : download the file , make the extraction and conversion work then check if everything is ok and probably is , if not try then the update 2 if it is the case but i think the 64 bits users probably get less possible problems than the 32 bits , in case of getting the problems , so do everything normaly necessary with the file and in case of circunstancial problems try the update 2 to see if that help to have the game running , for my part i have to say that i get everything fine and i did the correct work and this slight problem on the run if it is the case wasnÂ´t previsible in anyway at the time that i make the file , absolutly nothing make me predicting this possible cicunstancial problems . Ok , this is my orientation for the generality of the users of the file and remember eveyone that i respect my work and all the possible users of my files more as possible trying to do the better competent work in each file .

[V],globeplus,2010-10-24T06:47Z,"ANALYSIS :  First i would like to say that the Fallout : New Vegas is a very nice work and hope more nice Fallouts still beeing available for PC in the future because is a nice series of games , i am saying this because after played the SAW I game on the PC , i find out that this game only available for the consoles XBOX 360 and PS3 and make me thinking where is the sense on that after saw the first game really ok on the PC , i simply can figured it out whatÂ´s going on and why not the PC version for the second game and this in a week with Devil May Cry Lords of Shadows not for the PC too , i am thinking if Konami now it is simply banalising the PC versions beeing only concentrated on the consoles , if someone out there knows something more about this subject and that can clear this a little bit more , iÂ´ll be gratefull because i donÂ´t get it why nice games with PC versions before donÂ´t have versions for this ones .

@ globeplus

maybe before insulting people you should provide the proper files to run the game instead of people wasting hours on something that you yourself cant make work properly and result into using other peoples files.
you always act like a child and bash people making claims of them ripping your games when you yourself use other rippers files in your version. son don't feed me no bullshit little boy.

,apoorv413,2010-10-24T21:28Z,"thanx a lot globe u the man, the game WORKS i just used the reg entry that globe gave no update.30 mins into the game n no issues.
using win xp sp 3 32 bit

seed till u bleed"
,apoorv413,2010-10-24T21:35Z,"read all those comments by Shoobox :p 
dude seriously i've never seen globe thrashing anyone here."
,Shoobox,2010-10-24T21:44Z,"@apoorv413
ive been on this seen for a long time before globe was around.
 i've seen globe lash at at people without even people insulting him when asking for help, he is very childish. he fails to put the english language in proper text that others can read and understand, ive seen him lash out b4 at people when not understanding him.
ive seen him make false claims to other rippers before his rip versions was even out stating they copied his rips "
,p2pPirate,2010-10-25T23:02Z,"@Shoobox...

totally agree with you!. globe sucks, i mean, look how dumb he is on youtube lol... fukken funny!..."
,Shoobox,2010-10-26T02:08Z,"@p2pPirate
You'll have to send me the link never seen that one your talking about lol"
,eterglax,2010-10-26T05:22Z,sorry but im having problems i already converted and at the moment when i enter on the fallout launcher it shows me a menu but i cant click on the options so when i use the nv launcher just load a bit and nothing happens... by the way i have win7 64bits
,frytus,2010-10-26T08:21Z,thanx a million globeplus for the game works pefectly after applying the update
,heyman1981,2010-10-26T13:29Z,Shoobox your a clown....
,Shoobox,2010-10-26T17:40Z,"@heyman1981
lol yea im a clown
because a ripper cant compress movies right or add sound to games and uses other peoples files to get his games working,
its funny how tptb ripped games has sound and equal quality video's and rarely requires you to hunt all over the torrents to download workables files for the games.
next time you try to clown a comment make a valid point of why im a clown ,not to make yourself feel whitty by using the word clown."
,Shoobox,2010-10-26T17:41Z,why would people thank globe for updates to a rip game that isn't his updates is beyond me.
,air_misuzu,2010-10-27T10:29Z,"""COMPLETE GAME with only 1 video worked"". Does it mean there is only 1 watchable videos in the game? Others are ripped? Thanks."
,zijincheng,2010-10-30T05:10Z,"Yo Globeplus, I once installed fallout 3 on my computer, copied out all the files, made a reg file and burned to dvd. Even after uninstalling and copying the files over and regging the registry it wud work.

But when i uninstalled, I get the exact same problem I get here, launcher doesn't work (fixed through reg.bat) and falloutnv.exe doesn't work as well, your torrent has the same problem as tptb as well, and so far no fix can fix it"
,zijincheng,2010-10-30T05:13Z,"Ok Everyone, I got a fix that works, tried it out. I have windows 7 64 bit.

This update does not require previous updates to run, also works on globe's release. Enjoy!

Yo globe, gr8 work on everything man, espescially prototype :)"
,Cr09,2010-10-31T06:29Z,"Hello globe:)
Another game, will you upload John Daly's ProStroke Golf pc version?"
,Speal.,2010-10-31T22:07Z,"I'm having problems with this one...
I extract it properly with freearc and when i try to launch globe converter it says ""An unknown error has occured. The program will be terminated!""

Help me out globe..."
,crossebby,2010-11-05T05:10Z,"Heah baby, its working. Convertion took 13 minutes then when I click falloutlauncher.exe it says ""game not installed"", then I applied the reg file ""Fallout New Vegas Registry Fix  32 & 64 Bit   {blaze69}"" now its working without a problem.

Thanks globe once again. ILOVEU>>>>"
,AznAssassin,2010-11-13T05:15Z,"I get an error during my freearc extraction. Is anyone in the same boat as me? Globe converter works...lets just see if the game is actually missing any files from freearc extraction. 
"
,AznAssassin,2010-11-13T06:35Z,Okay it doesn't work. My freearc extractoon got up to 85.7% at the moment of extracting voicesbsa2 and its always a permission error or interrupted error. HELP!!!!!!!! 
,AznAssassin,2010-11-13T12:19Z,"ok... after taking shroo's advice as well as downloading Skidrow's crack, the game finally runs and it works. HOWEVER, there are missing bsa files for sound and thus over 75% of the NPC's wont have any audio at all. Its still playable but no NPC sound and only relying to subtitles kinda sux Globe. Maybe re-upload a extraction-error free version of the game? Its not my PC's problem. A lot of other ppl dl-ing this file also have the same problem as me. Basically fix up the freearc file containing the game and it should be good. othewise, this torrent sux. "
,bruce01n,2010-11-13T19:42Z,"heyyy!!! globe thanx a ton for your genuine hardwork with every single game...BIG FAN of ur rips...huge shoutout comin frm me & my buddies for u frm my hometown arizona!!! keep up the good work pal!!! ....& to all the people havin trouble with this game... 1.game not runnin 2.certain errors 3.crashes 4.game does not load....update all your drivers (graphic,directx,etc.) extract & move folder to desktop & THEN run globe converter...for me the game ran just fine(finished it in normal complete)....but for my friend it ran only after applying  this update & http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5903905(thanx to @zijincheng for giving the link & the uploader for providing file)....give it a try :) it definitly works !!!....& to those having doubts whether this game is missing textures,sounds,or anything else i can assure you all its  A COMPLETE game with only the intro video downsampled....hv fun & do seed!!! thnx again to globe :) !!! ADIOS"
,AznAssassin,2010-11-14T23:18Z,"@bruce01n and ANYONE WHO CAN HELP

Which extraction program did u use? I tried freearc and peazip and both gave me an extraction error/'intterruption' at around 85.7% =S

tats my only problem. Which has to lead to my game having no NPC sound for most of the NPC's since the voices.bsa files were not extracted due to the error"
,AznAssassin,2010-11-15T04:19Z,"Actually ignore my comment. Apparently there was something wrong with the file not responding. I just did a dskchk and re-checked the torrent and voila, the game extraction 100% works, and plays awesome, sound and all :) It was the torrent's fault anyhow not my PC's fault. Just do a dskchk ppl if ur extraction is screwing up coz the freearc file is kinda dodgy. 

Thanks Globe btw"
,bruce01n,2010-11-16T11:46Z,"@AznAssassin.....gud thing it worked for you...but as for "".arc"" files always use freearc...as it has the most compatibilty with the .arc format...a quick normal extraction(complete without errors) requires 1.2gig's of ram....make sure of that&dont run other prog's in b/w & ur good to go!!!"
