Hrishikesh Mukherjeeâ€™s not so famous movie â€œNaukriâ€ featuring Rajesh Khanna and Raj Kapoor together is based on the plot brilliantly worked upon by Frank Capra in â€œItâ€™s a Wonderful Lifeâ€. The story features a person getting help of an angel after his death. The God Sent person makes the hero realize that when he was alive he was so important and loved by all around him but he couldnâ€™t recognize it. In the Indianized version Rajesh Khanna plays the man who meets the angel Raj Kapoor, after his death. The movie is not as enjoyable if compared to other famous Hrishi Daâ€™s social and comedy movies but still it is based on a unique and novel theme, though an inspired one.
Infact it seems that Hrishikesh Mukherjee must have been a fan of Frank Capra cinema. Movies of both the master film-makers have a simple and middle class feel, which touches the heart. If you are lover of Hrishi Daâ€™s movies then you must watch Frank Capraâ€™s â€œItâ€™s a Wonderful Lifeâ€ and also â€œIt Could Happen To Youâ€.
