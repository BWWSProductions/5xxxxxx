GameStop -- The Classic Pack:

   Armored Vault 13 Suit - Extensively patched up and dotted with
   piecemeal armor, this outfit is a homage to the classic ending of
   the original Fallout.

   Vault 13 Canteen - This handy device is useful for staving off
   dehydration and providing a small amount of healing in the Mojave
   Wasteland.

   Weathered 10mm Pistol - A well-worn 10mm pistol that packs an extra
   punch despite its modest size.

   5 Stimpaks - Food and water are good for long-term healing, but when
   the fighting is fierce, Stimpaks help keep Wastelanders upright.


Amazon -- The Tribal Pack:

   Tribal Raiding Armor - Pieced together from scraps of armor, this
   outfit provides protection without impacting mobility.

   Broad Machete - This heavy-bladed melee weapon does high damage
   against limbs and can quickly deal out a flurry of attacks.

   5 Bleak Venom doses - Useful on any Melee Weapon, Bleak Venom makes
   short of work of most living targets.

   10 Throwing Spears - If you would like to silently pin an enemy's
   head to a wall, Throwing Spears are the way to do it.


Steam and Walmart -- The Caravan Pack:

   Lightweight Leather Armor - This hand-modified suit of leather armor
   reduces its overall weight without impacting its ability to protect.

   Sturdy Caravan Shotgun - Despite its rough appearance, this Caravan
   Shotgun will reliably fire 20 gauge shells until the Brahmin come home.

   4 Repair Kits - Useful for repairing any outfit or weapon, Repair
   Kits are a valuable tool for any caravaner.

   Binoculars â€“ The Mojave Wasteland is a dangerous place, but with
   these trusty Binoculars youâ€™ll be able to spot trouble coming.


Best Buy -- The Mercenary Pack:

   Lightweight Metal Armor - Modified for long-range travel, this Metal
   Armor sacrifices some protection for mobility and overall weight.

   Mercenaryâ€™s Grenade Rifle - Though similar to other 40mm Grenade
   Rifles in the Mojave Wasteland, this model has a faster reload cycle.

   3 Super Stimpaks - When you absolutely, positively, need to keep
   your blood inside your body, Super Stimpaks fix you up in no time.

   3 Doctors Bags - Mercenaries and broken limbs go together like
   Iguana-on-a-Stick and Nuka Cola. Thankfully, these Doctors Bags take
   a bit of sting out of the inevitable crushed skull.
