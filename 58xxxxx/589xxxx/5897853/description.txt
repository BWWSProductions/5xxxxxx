The Vampire Diaries is a young adult vampire horror series of novels written by L. J. Smith. The story centers around Elena Gilbert, a high school girl torn between two vampire brothers. The series was originally a trilogy published in 1991, but pressure from readers led Smith to write a fourth volume, Dark Reunion, which was released the following year. After taking a hiatus from writing for several years, L. J. Smith announced in 1998 a new spin-off trilogy entitled The Vampire Diaries: The Return, continuing the series, with Damon as the main protagonist. The first installment, The Return: Nightfall, was released on February 10, 2009. The Return: Shadow Souls was released on May 16, 2010. The Return: Midnight  will be released on March 15 of 2011. L.J Smith has recently signed a contract to write another Vampire Diaries trilogy. The first book in the series is to be called Phantom, and is expected to be released in the summer of 2011.[1]  The second in the new trilogy is entitled Moonsong, and the third Eternity. Smith has stated the new books will focus on Elena and her friends in college.
