                    It's My Party, and I'll Lie If i Want to.  
                    Veronica is suspicious that Ted might be using  
                    his daughter Rose to bond with the boss and his  
                    daughter, in an effort to advance his own  
                    career. Meanwhile, Phil and Lem's tentative  
                    friendship with Linda doesn't go well when a  
                    new invention at Veridian catches Linda telling  
                    lies.
