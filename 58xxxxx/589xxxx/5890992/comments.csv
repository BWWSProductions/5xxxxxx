I have a request please, can you rip the theatrical version of Apocalypse Now?
I was never a fan of the Redux version, and I would love to watch the theatrical in BR.

Thanks a lot for your efforts!"

I wanted to encode the theatrical version as well but I cannot release torrents for now. I have issues with the seedbox. "
