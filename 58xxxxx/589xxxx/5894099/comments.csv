From what I'm reading they invested a LOT into making sure it didn't hit the internet. I've been on chinese google and everywhere looking and haven't found it. Where's a good ol Axxo at when ya need him? Almost every DVD, R5, etc is utter crap, virused or something else mislabeled, even the cam results are crap as well. Be careful kiddies thats gonna be hot, but i'll help seed if you get it out."
