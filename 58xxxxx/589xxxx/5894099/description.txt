MTV aired a marathon of the original Jackass series followed by back-to-back specials, "Jackass: The Beginning" a documentary about the creation of Jackass and stories about the first time the crew had filmed with the cast members and "The Making of Jackass 3D" a behind-the-scenes special.

Currently pulling "The Beginning" will seed that as well.
