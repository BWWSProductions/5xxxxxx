THIS FIRE was nominated for 1998 Grammy Awards for Album Of The Year and Best Pop Album. "Where Have All The Cowboys Gone" was nominated for 1998 Grammys for Record Of The Year, Song Of The Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Paula Cole won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best New Artist.

Singer-songwriter Paula Cole bares her soul on her self-produced second album, displaying even more self-confidence than on HARBINGER. There is a sense of breaking with the past, especially on tracks like "Tiger," where Cole revisits the symbolic "Bethlehem" of her first album, singing, "I've left Bethlehem and I feel free/I've left the girl I was supposed to be." Lyrically, THIS FIRE is ferocious and unrestrained, and Cole's limber voice is suitably raw and versatile, veering from whispery-soft to edgy and emotional, delivering a fearlessly personal message.

When she sings, "You call me a bitch in heat/And I call you a liar" (on "Throwing Stones"), the word "liar" emerges as a furious scream. The next track, "Carmen," in contrast, is gently nostalgic. Cole's songs are emotionally complex and open to interpretation, but they are never deliberately vague, and her subtle wit saves THIS FIRE from self-absorption.
