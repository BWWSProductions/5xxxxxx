Band of Angels (1957)

Just before the Civil War, a wealthy, but benevolent, white plantation owner buys a part-black girl as a slave, only to save her from that lifestyle. Instead, she becomes his mistress. Once the War comes, however, his right-hand man, a black man who works for him, joins the Union effort, and, in the end the landowner is forced to burn his crops rather than yield to Yankee demands.
