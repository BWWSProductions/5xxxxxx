                                =   NEXT WORLD  =
                                =================



NextWorld reveals the science, the inventions and the innovations that seem impossible now, but will be a reality in our lifetimes. Imagine cities under the oceans, bionic suits, space tourism, superspeed trains, cyborg moths, windships, hoverbikes, somatic sensors, virtual reality, people living to 150 years old -- these may be just the dreams of today but they will shape the NextWorld.






Episode I: Future Life on Earth
===============================

Learn about the technologies that will usher in a whole new way of life: we will live in floating cities, fly to work and travel in cars capable of operating underwater. And, with new technologies, humanity will find new ways of protecting and conserving resources to meet the needs of a growing population by using renewable sources of water, food and electricity.

The era of smog-filled skies will be over, because fewer of us will be driving cars. Where weâ€™re going, we wonâ€™t need roads. Weâ€™ll be piloting environmentally friendly personal vehicles between cities and under the seas. And the good news is weâ€™ll never be lost, thanks to new advances in GPS-driven virtual mapping. Then again, with the ability to teleport our presence anywhere on Earth, we might not have to travel at all. And, best of all, weâ€™ll all have more time to enjoy the astounding advances of our near future, because weâ€™ll all be living longer. A lot longer.




Episode II: Future Intelligence
===============================

Catch a first-time glimpse at smart technology that will put android helpers in the home, network commuters and entire cities to the Web, and bring us entertainment systems that can virtually make dreams come true. Advances in artificial intelligence are creating machines with near human-like mental agility. Intelligence will be embedded everywhere -- even in our clothing, thanks to smaller, more powerful computers.




Episode III: Future Cars
========================

Get in the driver seat of the fastest, smartest and most high-performance cars of tomorrow. See the supercars that will reach speeds unimaginable with today's technology. They will operate on voice command and drive without a drop of gas, and cruise over land and water.




Episode IV: Extreme Tomorrow
============================

Go beyond the cutting edge of today to see the technologies and inventions that will enable us to see through walls, travel through space and time, and colonize distant planets.




Episode V: Future Ships
=======================

Come aboard invisible aircraft carriers, mega-yachts, personal submarines and craft capable of changing appearance on the high seas in Future Ships.





Episode VI: Future Flight
=========================

Future Flight takes to the skies of tomorrow on board shape-shifting planes, top secret military aircraft and jets with self healing wings.
