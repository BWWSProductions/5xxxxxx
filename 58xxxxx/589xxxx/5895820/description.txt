The latest edition of Hammonds flagship atlas is a worthwhile option 
as an atlas for a family that enjoys learning about the world. 

Most impressive are the 64 pages of thematic information about so many 
aspects of physical and cultural geography with stunning color, 
DK-style illustrations. The thematic section includes short chapters 
on the history of time zones, climate, hazards, world population, 
and much more.

The next best features is the 48 pages of stunning satellite photos 
of such features at the Nile, the Bosporus, Arctic, Hurricane Andrew, 
and the impact of humans on the earth.

The map plates provide good coverage of the populated earth and the 
gazetteer is quite thorough with over one hundred thousand place names.

Enjoy.
