- Bateless Edge -

"Frogg Cafe is a 5-piece band from the New York metropolitan area making music that incorporates elements of Zappa-esque progressive rock, pop melodicism and fusion jazz. Frogg Cafe's music is also peppered with an appealing variety of other flavors including latin music, bluegrass, modern chamber music and avant-garde/experimental. Their energetic live shows feature extended flights of group improvisation that would draw grins from any hardcore jam-band fan."

Frogg Cafe's lastest album Bateless Edge is easily their most ambitious effort to date and deserves far more attention than it will probably receive.
Until now (October 2010) Batless Edge is the top-rated prog album of 2010 in http://www.progarchives.com.

Zappa followers, listeners of jazz influenced prog or just lovers of well elaborated and exciting music should be prepared for several surprises. Highly recommended.
