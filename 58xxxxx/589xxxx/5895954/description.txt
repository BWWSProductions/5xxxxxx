Mary Lennox (Gennie James) is a spoiled young British girl orphaned by an Indian epidemic. She is sent to Misselthwaite Manor in Yorkshire to live with a distant relative, Archibald Craven (Derek Jacobi), and there she becomes obsessed with a secret, overgrown garden. With the help of a local boy, Dickon (Barret Oliver), the garden and everyone around them--including Craven and his frail son, Colin (Jadrien Steele) --come to life again.

Filmed on location at scenic Highclere Castle , this Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic won an Emmy for Outstanding Children's Program. An uplifting story for all ages.
