I can't think why, when this is a BiA release, it is not being released on EZTV or am I being a moron in thinking that BiA are a scene group?
Either way their shit is always on EZTV but not this show for some reason.
So, thank you fine Sirs of TvTeam!!
I now can download from this site safe in the knowledge that I am indeed downloading the real article, a verifiable, trustworthy uploader, as I find at EZTV.
You have done yourself proud and, and, I will be returning to YOU my good man, for future shows.
I thank you immensely.
