ORIGINAL CD-RIP + PATCH FOR VISTA

INSTALLATION
------------

UNZIP EVERYTHING TO A TEMPORARY MAP

MOUNT OR BURN THE ISO

INSTALL THE GAME

COPY THE FILE SHADOWMAN.EXE IN THE PATCH DIRECTORY OVER THE ORIGINAL ONE (THIS WAY I GOT IT TO RUN ON VISTA)
I HAD TO LEAVE THE ISO MOUNTED TO BE ABLE TO PLAY.

IF YOU DO NOT COPY THE PATCH (ORIGINAL ONE), AFTER STARTING THE GAME YOU KEEP GOING BACK TO THE DESKTOP.

I ALSO INCLUDED A WALKTROUGH TEXTFILE :)

HAVE FUN
