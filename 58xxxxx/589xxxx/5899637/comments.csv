,jrock84,2011-04-05T16:32Z,"Seeding is just uploading. This torrent needs some more seeders. To seed, just leave the torrent in the BitTorrent client (I recommend uTorrent). After it's finished downloading, it will automatically start seeding. Its good to seed until the upload-download ratio is AT LEAST 1.000 (I usually let it seed until it gets to 5.000, sometimes up to 25.000). "
