Synopsis
Filmed in Yemen and GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba, The Oath interweaves the stories of Abu Jandal, Osama bin Ladenâ€™s former bodyguard, and Salim Hamdan, a prisoner at GuantÃ¡namo facing war crimes charges. Directed by Laura Poitras (Flag Wars, POV 2003; the OscarÂ®-nominated My Country, My Country, POV 2006), The Oath unfolds via a narrative rife with plot reversals and betrayals that ultimately leads to Osama bin Laden, 9/11, GuantÃ¡namo and the U.S. Supreme Court. Winner of the 2010 Sundance Film Festival Excellence in Cinematography Award: Documentary. A co-production of ITVS in association with American Documentary/POV.
