For about a thousand years Delphi was an important religious center of ancient Greece.
Kings, generals, priests and commoners began long voyages trough the mountains of Central Greece in order to question the famous oracle of Delphi.
In an elegant complex of temples and monuments, the sanctuary dispensed the messages of Apollo through Pythia's voice.
An answer of the oracle, was capable of leading to great victories or defeats in war,to a rich wealth or a disastrous ruin.
A fascinating voyage towards the discovery of the ancient mysteries of Delphi: the mythology , the tales and the ancient myths tied to this spiritual centre, which the Greeks considered the centre of the world.
