The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Spells.

Here are fun spells for all needs: 
To revive passion, to find love, for health, to attract money, 
and to help job seekers. The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Spells 
contains everything one needs to make their dreams come true, 
including practical steps to take if the spells don't take 
effect immediately. With step-by-step, easy-to-follow instructions 
and easy-to-find tools and ingredients, this comprehensive volume 
emphasizes how to use spells and magic positively, for self-development. 
Discover your true nature and destiny with this fun guide to self-help magic!

Easy spells using easy to find items/ingredients. 
The spells are effective and make it easy to alter to suit your 
own needs. The only drawback is that despite it's claim as the 'ultimate' 
spell book, it is limited as far as types of spells. I have many more 
witchcraft books that are more varied in choices and types of spells 
(i.e. love, prosperity, protection, etc...). Other than that, 
I would recommend this book.

Enjoy.
