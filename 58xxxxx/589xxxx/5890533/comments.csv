,EdTown,2010-10-23T18:34Z,"I appreciate the upload, but I have to say the video quality is dismal. I don't know what others are watching this on, but I burned it to a DVD and tried to watch on my 52 inch TV. The picture is heavily pixelated and all but unwatchable. I expected a 4gb download to approach DVD quality. I wouldn't even watch this on a small computer screen."
,plush2,2010-10-24T02:15Z,"And I appreciate your review, but what you mean is that it is ""all but watchable"", no?"
,kpg1970,2010-10-26T07:34Z,"I burned the movie to dvd and tried to watch it on my 48 inch hdtv and was very disappointed. tossed the disk, but I did finish uploading to 110%.
I will wait for a dvd version instead of the screener.
Thank you for the upload though rocco64."
,Ehsan_danger4,2010-10-29T11:15Z,"NEVER EVER!!! Download from 2lions-team!

They always have CAM!!! all there vids ARE CAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Shitty quality"
,str33tkid,2010-11-01T20:25Z,"Neej serieus, is dit weer zo'n k*t cam?"
[T],Dorien69,2010-11-10T01:56Z,"Look at the discription at the source
It is very simpel source say dvdscr wich meens dvdscreener so this is not dvd quality but a very good screener
"
,Wi-Foo-er,2010-11-11T23:57Z,good movie -v 8 -a 9
,fuckthatshit696,2010-11-16T16:59Z,"To all the people. Telling other people not to download. Will you kindly shut the fuck up. And stop telling them how to live their life? Some people don't mind a screener, if it means seeing the movie that much earlier. So maybe warn people next time. Avoid the whole, Hillary Clinton persona. And thank you rocco, and 2lions team. For doing what you do AND putting up with them. though, to be fair this is under DVDR."
