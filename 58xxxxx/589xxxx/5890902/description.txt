Come Around Sundown, Kings of Leon's fifth album was recorded in New York at Avatar Studios and produced once again by Angelo Petraglia and Jacquire King.
Come Around Sundown is the follow-up to the hugely successful Only By The Night, which sold over six million copies worldwide and garnered four Grammy Awards and two Brits, and is yet another bold and expansive statement by the Nashville, Tennessee-based quartet.
