[b][color=Orange]Never Sound Retreat: The Lost Regiment, Book 6[/color][/b]
UNABRIDGED
by William R. Forstchen
Narrated by Patrick Lawlor

It has been 10 years since a group of American Civil War soldiers was swept away from the battlefields of Earth to a distant world - where the only place for a human is as a slave to an alien race. But even though they are far from home, the members of the Union 35th Main regiment still embody the radical ideas of democracy and freedom - and they\'re willing to lay down their lives rather than sound retreat!
