,ajaylion2,2011-02-24T03:38Z,"for all those who get black screen or loop back to xmb, dont worry this torrent is worth you download:) after a week of struggling to get it work, the game now works 100%. Here's what i did:
1)Load this up onto external hdd(fat32 of-course)
2)Download latest Multiman from ps3hacks and install.
3)Do not back up onto internal HDD, it doesn't work
4)Insert an original game BD(i used AC Brotherhood but any will do)
5)Open multiman and browse upto AC on ur ext disk
6)Press and hold ""SELECT"" and press ""X""
7)It asks for Virtual Emulate BD from ext disk, select yes and OK
8)Start from the BD icon, your good to go:)
i feel embarrassed after solving a noob problem after so many days:D"

,DarkTamashii,2011-05-14T06:06Z,"I got this working:...

don't know why for some people this works without problems but for the ones that can't get it to run, even using the [SELECT]+[X] method, you must create a folder inside the USRDIR called ASSASSIN_ISO...
I did it and run it with [SELECT]+[X] and it worked... Still don't know if the game have other issues..."

,VsEarth,2011-07-17T18:23Z,"Tried w/ game disc in bd emulate loop back to XMB, installed patch loop back to xmb, created the ASSASSINS_ISO folder worked! weird shit (might have something to do with this being the greatest hits version)"
,sapmaskey,2011-08-07T18:51Z,its taking forever to download.. pretty slow :(
,denatorewu38,2011-08-16T01:04Z,video/movies tutorial of the Assassins: http://www.gamestia.com/video/assassins-creed-c14s1.html
,Murd3rMiL,2011-10-20T07:42Z,Simply in multiman go to the file manager go to the assissins creed game folder inside the usdir folder make another folder by pressing circle ASSASSIN_ISO then launch with select+X
,maxdesolate,2011-12-24T19:25Z,"ok, heres the solution which no one had explained properly to noobs. what you have to do is - create a folder called ASSASIN_ISO in your USDIR folder in your USB(external), not internal. no need to install any pkg. after that select+x in multiman, then select+x in xmb. thats it!"
,maxdesolate,2011-12-24T19:29Z,and this game DOES NOT work from internal. hope i helped guys.
