Biography by Richie Unterberger allmusic.com

Although they only attained the huge success of the Beatles, Rolling 
Stones, and the Beach Boys for a short time in the mid-'60s, time has 
judged the Byrds to be nearly as influential as those groups in the 
long run. They were not solely responsible for devising folk-rock, 
but they were certainly more responsible than any other single act 
(Dylan included) for melding the innovations and energy of the 
British Invasion with the best lyrical and musical elements of 
contemporary folk music. The jangling, 12-string guitar sound of 
leader Roger McGuinn's Rickenbacker was permanently absorbed into the 
vocabulary of rock. They also played a vital role in pioneering 
psychedelic rock and country-rock, the unifying element being their 
angelic harmonies and restless eclecticism. 

Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine allmusic.com

Forget about a career retrospective -- it's impossible to summarize 
the Byrds' hits in ten songs. Nevertheless, the budget-line 
collection Super Hits does a nice job of rounding up the group's hits 
-- including "Mr. Tambourine Man," "Turn! Turn! Turn!," "Eight Miles 
High," and "So You Want to Be a Rock & Roll Star" -- plus a handful 
of cult favorites ("Chestnut Mare," "He Was a Friend of Mine") on one 
affordable compilation. It's far from definitive or necessarily 
representative -- several phases of the band's evolution are missing 
-- but it may be of interest to casual fans on a strict budget.
