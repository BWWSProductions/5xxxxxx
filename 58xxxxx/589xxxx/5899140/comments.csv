,vegeta527,2010-12-14T20:58Z,"I have the torrent downloaded and everything extracted. I am unable to download it though. When i click on the application file it opens setup. Everything is fine until i click install and i get a error. The error says ""Setup was unable to create the directory 'C:\program files\mount&blade - Warband'. """
,vegeta527,2010-12-14T20:58Z,Could someone help me out? I do not know if it is my computer blocking it or the torrent not working. I am somewhat new to this whole torrent thing.
