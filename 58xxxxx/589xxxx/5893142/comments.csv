Is it their huge size? I tried Winamp and CopytoDvd.

They play good on my computer.

,jibadeaux,2010-10-31T02:04Z,"Yeah dude you can't. It was originally on a Super Audio CD which holds more than a normal CD. You'll need to convert it to something else, like a lower level FLAC and or even mp3 and then burn it. "
,mc595,2011-03-14T23:49Z,"This is quite possibly the BEST version of this album that I've ever found. Everything is so distinct, it's like listening to a Gold Master version of the record."
,vernave,2011-03-30T05:05Z,So all that is needed for playback is just download foobar2000? will this playback over hdmi using foobar2000?
,geenotreally,2011-04-07T12:40Z,Listen to this on a Denon AVR-4311 before you die.
,jibadeaux,2011-06-27T22:24Z,Yes it will play back over HDMI or anything else with foobar2000. Doesn't matter what equipment you have your soundcard will process it. 
,Wolfpacker96,2011-10-10T17:21Z,"Question, how do you rip 6 channel SACD?  I have a few and wanted to back them up to my computer, but everything I've seen says it isn't possible.  But here it is.  Is the just a recording of each channel as it is being played, i.e. you've converted it to analog?"
,Bruzem,2011-11-01T02:27Z,"Awful rip, you will find better elsewhere."
,fZAP,2012-02-08T20:00Z,"don't believe douchebag Bruzem.
This is  very good, even though u dont have a 5.1 setup.
(most (all) codecs supports 5.1 -> 2 channels)"
