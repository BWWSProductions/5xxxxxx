                                   RELEASE NOTES


             Armed to the teeth, fast boats, Somali pirates can catch    
             up and grab any civilian vessel, unequipped for combat.     
             Tankers and dry cargo ships have nothing to oppose          
             large-caliber machine guns and RPGs. Chasing small and      
             brisk courts at large military ships - is like firing a     
             cannon at sparrows. Output is obvious - hired paramilitary  
             corporation, which can take over the protection and         
             preservation of ships. These pros, "dogs of war" in no way  
             will yield the sea bandits, and thanks to the brilliant     
             skill and a great outfit can cope with the scourge of much  
             smaller force!
