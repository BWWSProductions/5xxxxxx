Not to anyone's offence but the print still sucks .. sorry about that .. nonetheless, your work is exceptional and appreciate your efforts too to make that available for free! 

What I cannot seem to understand is why the hell are they not coming out with a DVD for this movie since so loooong ? I mean what is taking so bloody long .. becoz the movie was released almost 4 months back ?"
