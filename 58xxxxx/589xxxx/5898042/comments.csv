,raindr0ps,2010-10-20T22:25Z,These ebooks are in epub format!
,zenekkw,2010-10-21T10:33Z,"The EPUB format is an open eBook format recommended by The International Digital Publishing Forum. It is essentially a ZIP format. If you change its extension "".epub"" to "".zip"", the EPUB file becomes a true ZIP file which can be unzipped."
,zenekkw,2010-10-22T00:13Z,"99,76% - that's it?
What about seeding?"

,navaneet,2010-10-24T09:40Z,"Thank You Very Much for sharing this despite the fact that it's epub version & so I had to download the Mozilla Firefox Epub Reader Addon and incompleteness of the 1001 must read books I see in the listology website, and one more thing: some books like Gabriel Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude have this ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ symbol everywhere making the readers guess what's really there.

But despite all these facts, there are so many books here where I can't it from nowhere else in the internet. So a Million Thanks.

@zenekkw your true. I unzipped the epub with winrar and it's like so many files like as when you save a website. Yea, I've got the story part-by-part in clicking some html icons but after-all, What's the big use of it ? or at-least What's the small use of it besides the general knowing that we can unzip them ?"
,capturetwist,2010-12-22T18:34Z,"thanks a lot, can someone please seed!!"
,capturetwist,2010-12-23T00:09Z,"I am at 99% and can't seem to find anyone seeding, please seed!"
,capturetwist,2010-12-26T18:32Z,"what it is wrong with this torrent, I am at 99.7% and it will not have any seeds?  How come, please to the uploader seed, how can you do that?
PLEASE SEEEEEEEEDDDDDDD"
