Haunted History - Haunted Edinburgh

Plagued by invasions, disease, and religious strife, Scotland's City of Edinburgh is steeped in murder, mystery, and mayhem. Occupied since the Bronze Age, Edinburgh took shape during the 11th century--and soon after tales of ghosts and goblins began to surface. Scary locations on our tour include: Holyrood Palace, rumored to be haunted by Mary, Queen of Scots, and her Italian secretary David Rizzio, who was murdered there; and an abandoned underground city, where thousands died during the 1645 plague.
