Frankie Goes To Hollywood - Relax [promo].VOB



Very HQ uncensored promo music video. This first official video for "Relax" 
was directed by Bernard Rose and was set in a S&M themed gay nightclub. 
It was allegedly banned by MTV and the BBC, prompting the recording of a 
second promo video shot with laser beams. (video does not have any logos)
