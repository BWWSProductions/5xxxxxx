New Vegas: It s the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to being shot in the head and left for dead... and that s before things really get ugly. It s a town of dreamers and desperados being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete control of this desert oasis. It s a place where the right kind of person with the right kind of weaponry can really make a name for themselves, and make more than an enemy or two along the way.
