Every time  I try to access a terminal, the screen never actually pops up but I hear the sounds of it opening and the background blurs. Is it possibly because I am playing a pirated copy? Or is it a pretty common and well known bug?"
,zeek89,2010-10-28T00:21Z,Actually I just realized that it is because I have rearranged my button mapping and made O (circle) the activate button. Apparently it is a game bug. and i hope that Bethesda will fix it in a patch.

,tystuhman,2011-01-22T20:12Z,"@mercman4 

you have to jailbreak on firmware 3.55 i would recommend the ""Kmeaw"" firmware, just go to

(take out the spaces)

P S 3 - H A C K S . C O M

then extract the contents to a folder called

bles00521
(thats the disc id) 
and run with multiman 1.13.00"
