Mike Holmes is back with an all new series to help homeowners who have been victims of home inspections gone wrong. 
Featuring the well-known host of Holmes on Homes, this new series shines a spotlight on innocent homeowners facing massive repair bills and dangerous living conditions due to incompetence within the unregulated home inspection industry.
Each show offers a unique dilemma faced by house purchasers who, misled by a vague or evasive home inspection, now face a daunting renovation or potential health threat. 
Disillusioned and now distrusting, they call in Mike to offer a personal Holmes Inspection and assessment and to â€œMake It Rightâ€â„¢.
