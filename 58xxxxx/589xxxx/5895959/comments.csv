,the_subcon,2010-10-19T15:39Z,flv sucks
,thedecking,2010-10-19T18:49Z,Sorry sub but it's the only format I could get it in.  Seeing as Homes Inspection is not on TPB at all I thought FLV was better than nothing.  Can anyone suggest any good software for converting FLV to a better format?

,thedecking,2010-10-23T12:29Z,"The MAGNET LINK should work on the torrent.  No idea why the DOWNLOA THIS TORRENT doesn't work.  I'm showing 10 seeds and 14 leechers on Utorrent so it should work.  Post a comment on the torrent if you still can't DL and I'll re-up.

,goyeman_x,2010-11-11T06:22Z,"Not quite complete.  In the download there is no E03 ""Abated Breath"" or E07 ""Troubled Waters"""
,thedecking,2010-11-18T19:27Z,Episode 7 is available to watch on the HGTV website: http://www.hgtv.ca/holmesinspection/video.aspx but only if you're in Canada. If anyone can upload/send me a copy of this I'd be very grateful and would happily seed/upload.  Episode 3 isn't even on the HGTV website and I can't find a copy anywhere on the net.  Can anyone help?
,thedecking,2010-11-19T21:59Z,"Episode 7 torrent here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5968856
Still looking for episode 3.

,MC214,2011-01-07T10:40Z,I am trying to download it now...its a bit sad that you cant find those 2 episodes but I guess theres nothing you can do if no one uploads them :(   I was so glad you uploaded these! I know FLV isnt the best format but it was so much better than nothing! I have the first 8 eps (1-10 [missing the two episodes]) but the rest wont finish/download at all..it goes at maybe 1 kb/s which is a bit sad as it went like 500 the other day :(
,MC214,2011-01-07T13:36Z,Just noticed you have uploaded one of the missing episodes...i am gonna try to download it now...hope it downloads completely.
,thedecking,2011-02-09T16:56Z,sorry Ii've been offline for a while.  i'll reseed this for a bit to help you up to 100%
,tor1azc,2011-04-05T01:15Z,"Thx for the download ""thedecking"", love this show!"
,Cuthrach,2011-06-26T16:40Z,I have episode three but cannot get it to upload will keep trying
