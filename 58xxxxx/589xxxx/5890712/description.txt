Fitz and the Tantrums

With a shared love of old-school street corner soul, R&B and four-to-the-floor funk, Daryl Hall and L.A. band Fitz and the Tantrums make the perfect pairing for the 35th and latest edition of award-winning Live from Darylâ€™s House. Daryl joins Fitz, singer Noelle Scaggs and sax player James King for a toe-tapping, hand-clapping, get off your couch set that includes â€œGirl, I Love You,â€ a song Daryl wrote and originally recorded in 1967 with his first band, The Temptones.

â€œTo get to play with one of my biggest influences and idols was a dream come true,â€ raves Fitz, who founded the band and recorded their debut LP on an old church organ he purchased for $50. â€œDaryl and the guys put it down and we all left it on the floor! We went pretty deep into the Daryl Hall catalog to sing the first song Daryl ever recorded. It was a day we will never forget!â€

The seven-song set includes four Fitz and the Tantrums originals, which they call soul-influenced indie pop, from Pickinâ€™ Up the Pieces, their just-released album on Dangerbird Records, home of the Grammy-nominated Silversun Pickups, including the title track, â€œBreakinâ€™ the Chains of Love,â€ â€œDear Mr. Presidentâ€ and â€œMoneyGrabber.â€ Aside from â€œGirl, I Love You,â€ Daryl and the band decided to take on â€œPerkiomen,â€ a song written by him in 1970.
