 Notes:

  Danish Volbeat finally releases their debut album, after having hammered
  the scene with a couple of demos.

  Volbeat picks up where Dominus left off. More appropriate, since Dominus
  were a heavy death metal band, they have steered off into the more
  rock'n'roll path.

  Dominus is no more, but Volbeat is though.
