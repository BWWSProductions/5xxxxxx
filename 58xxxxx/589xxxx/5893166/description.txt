From Wiki:


Bad Religion is a Southern California punk rock band founded in 1979[1] by Jay Bentley (bass), Greg Graffin (vocals), Brett Gurewitz (guitars), and Jay Ziskrout (drums). They are often credited for being involved in the revival of punk rock and inspiring several subsequent punk bands[2][3][4][5] during the late 1980s, as well as influencing a large number of other punk and rock musicians throughout their career.[6] In the 31 years since its inception, Bad Religion has had numerous lineup changes, and Graffin has been the only constant member, although the band currently features three of the original members.

To date, Bad Religion has released fifteen studio albums, two EPs, three compilation albums, two live recordings, and two DVDs. Almost all of their albums were released on Epitaph Records, started in 1980 by Gurewitz, who still runs the label today. The band has independently sold over 5 million records worldwide,[7] making them one of the most successful independent punk acts of all time. Bad Religion released its debut album How Could Hell Be Any Worse? in 1982. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and critical acclaim, with the 1988 release Suffer cited by some critics as one of the most important punk rock albums of all time.[8][9][10] Three follow-ups ensued â€“ No Control, Against the Grain and Generator â€“ before they signed to Atlantic Records in 1993. Bad Religion rose to fame with their seventh studio album Recipe for Hate, which reached number 14 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart, marking the highest initial charting album in the band's career. Their next album, Stranger Than Fiction, featuring the band's well-known hit singles "21st Century (Digital Boy)" and "Infected", was also successful and became the only Bad Religion album to obtain gold status in the US. Following Gurewitz's departure in 1994, Graffin took over the majority of the songwriting duties, which lasted for the next three albums. Gurewitz returned to the fold in 2001, making Bad Religion a six-piece band, and contributed to their four most recent albums (the last being 2010's The Dissent of Man).

They are particularly known for their use of soaring 3 part vocal harmonies (which they refer to in their album liner notes as the "oozin' aahs"), unusually sophisticated and intellectual lyrics, and political or religious commentary. Their lyrics often relate to matters of social responsibility. 









The Dissent of Man 2010


The Dissent of Man is the fifteenth album by the Californian punk rock band Bad Religion, which was released on September 28, 2010. It is their first album in three years, following the release of New Maps of Hell in 2007. The band commenced writing new material in 2008, but would not begin studio work until May 2010. The writing and recording process spanned two years and was slowed down considerably by touring schedules. The album was finally finished in June 2010. Some of the material ("The Resist Stance", which originally appeared on the live album 30 Years Live, and an updated version of "Won't Somebody", which was a bonus track on the deluxe edition of previous album New Maps of Hell) was originally performed live by Bad Religion on its 30th anniversary tour in early 2010.

The Dissent of Man marks the first time since its formation in 1979 that a Bad Religion line-up has not changed in four consecutive studio recordings.

Work for The Dissent of Man dates back to June 2008, when bassist Jay Bentley revealed in an interview at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands that guitarist Brett Gurewitz had already started writing new material for the next Bad Religion album. He also revealed that Bad Religion was planning to return to the studio after frontman Greg Graffin teaches UCLA to start work on the album planned for a June 2009 release.[1] However, in December 2008, Bentley revealed that, due to Bad Religion's upcoming touring commitments for 2009, the band would not have a chance to record their new album until around the end of the year, for an expected 2010 release date.[2]

In December 2009, Bentley revealed to the fan site The Bad Religion Page that the band was expected to go into the studio on April 26, 2010 to start recording their new album. He stated that a few songs for the album had been written and "it feels like the songwriting is picking up momentum. Baker said he was going to drive up to Graffin's, Brooks and I are going to do some demos with Brett, so we have a pretty good jump."[3] In the following month, Bentley revealed that Bad Religion would record their new album at a studio in Pasadena, California with Joe Barresi, who produced New Maps of Hell and engineered its 2004 predecessor The Empire Strikes First.[4] Despite the statement made by Bentley about entering the studio in April, he noted that the recording date was now May 1.[5] On April 6, 2010, Bentley revealed in an interview with KROQ's Kevin and Bean that the date on which the band would record their new album was now May 6.[6]

On May 12, 2010 (Gurewitz's 48th birthday), Bentley posted an update on their Facebook page regarding the recording process of the album:

First week of recording at Joe [Barresi]'s house of compression and Brooks [Wackerman] gets the medal for "super-ass-kicking". Brian [Baker] has finished 14 basics... a couple more to go. I started getting some good bass sounds late, late last night, the liver wins the shootout again. Brett [Gurewitz] is playing late night tracks on his birthday, some way to celebrate! Happy birthday B.G.! Quote of the day; BG - "What percentage of the sound is coming from the snakeskin?". Ha ha... working of album titles and ideas today. It's all coming together. Joe [Barresi] says the corn flavored Kit Kats are gross, but the wasabi ones are quite delicious... get back to work. Work, work, work. Will send photo's soon.[7]

â€“ Jay Bentley

In an interview at the Azkena Rock Festival in Spain on June 26, 2010, Wackerman and Bentley revealed that the album would be called The Dissent of Man and would be released on September 28.[8]

On July 27, 2010, anyone who was a member of the Bad Religion mailing list received a link showing the album art and song list. Additionally, some members of the mailing list received a set of links. One allowed them to listen to the first single from the album, "The Devil in Stitches"[9]. The others were to get "first dibs" on pre-sale for the album and merchandise.

On September 21, 2010 the full album was made available for streaming on Bad Religion's MySpace page.

The Dissent Of Man debuted at #35 on the billboard 200 chart and at #6 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart.
