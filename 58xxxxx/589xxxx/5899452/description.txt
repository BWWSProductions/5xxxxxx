"Unplugged"

Noticing that everyone is too busy on their 
electronic devices to actually interact with 
one another, Claire and Phil declare a family 
challenge to see who can stay unplugged the 
longest. Meanwhile, it's a race against the 
clock as Mitchell and Cameron frantically try 
to get Lily into the best pre-schools, and 
Jay and Manny are concerned about how far 
Gloria will go to alleviate their problem 
with the neighbor's barking dog.


Enjoy more family with real settings and a
non-garbage source :)
