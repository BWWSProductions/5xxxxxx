,controld3,2010-10-17T22:11Z,"Thanks a lot! good downloading speed, and an interesting piece to hear today."
,Mercury8215,2010-11-02T02:37Z,96kb bit rate... HOW OLD IS YOUR MP3 PLAYER?

Like I said, not my rip. I think you'll find that most audiobooks are not encoded at 320kbps. It is just voice, after all."
,Mercury8215,2010-11-02T18:43Z,"I know it's not you're fault, but nothing should be encoded lower then 128.  Otherwise you get that nice ear splitting metallic background noise.  "
,OscarAlhoII,2011-01-30T18:33Z,Thank you Anonymous!
,poppy20,2011-02-05T22:58Z,Mercury - you won't be able to tell the difference between 96kbps and 128kbps for voice. Try it yourself in a double-blind test if you don't believe me. 
,RipOrDie999,2011-02-11T17:37Z,"Great quality, very funny book.

Thanks man. "
,vitanuova,2011-04-18T01:27Z,I can't believe this has been out for six months and there hasn't been a PDF release of the book.
