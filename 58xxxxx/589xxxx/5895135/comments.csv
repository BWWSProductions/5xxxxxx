,redvanilla,2010-10-20T14:20Z,"@ twentyforty: So at last I managed to register - mostly to assure you of my appreciation and to let you know how much I respect your work. I also enjoy reading the comments. Some of them amuse me quite a lot.

I am going to help out a little - meaning: literally a little - but for a few days

Thank You!"
