Frankie Goes To Hollywood - Relax [alternate Laser promo].VOB



HQ rare alternate Laser promo Music video. The first official video for 
"Relax", directed by Bernard Rose, was set in a S&M themed gay nightclub, 
and allegedly banned by MTV and the BBC, prompting the recording of this 
second official promo video, directed by Godley and Creme in early 1984, 
featuring the group performing with the help of "laser beams".
(video has 5 small, semi-transparent blue dots on the bottom right)
