,InDeathrow,2010-10-16T16:34Z,Why doesnt the sound work on your torrents on vlc player..? it works on wmp but in wmp the subtitles dont work.. Help please..;D
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-16T17:15Z,"@InDeathrow: Glad you asked, not just stated ""Sound doesn't work in VLC"": See idiotic statement on Toy Story 3 720p.
It works - VLC is not just for Windows, it's media player for Mac and Linux - and - x264/AAC capabilities are built-in. People fuck the settings up and - VLC have some recently surfaced issues too.

OK? Now - I have the same problem. VLC have sound (I hope you mean that) but sound stutters on VLC's DirectShow output on - WINDOWS.
If I switch to old Wave output (settings in VLC, Advanced mode) sound is delayed by random amount, 1 - 3 seconds!
OK?
Now... ALL VLC players - 0.8 generation, 0.9, and now 1.x worked FLAWLESSLY before - on Windows XP/SP2/SP3 - but - on my old computer.
On new one, there is tragic discrepancy between Realtek sound drivers, DirectX sound layer (used on old comp too, but older generation), and really terribly old DirectX interface/layer VLC uses.
Under Linux - there is problems at all.
And - it shouldn't be - VLC is practically ""home"" of H264 project and AAC sound was always part of the whole ""picture"".

In short - you have same problems as I have - and use DivX Pro player or CoreAVC as I do for years. That's why I have recommended CoreAVC/Divx AAC in my Headers."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-16T17:17Z,@InDeathrow: ... and for subs - as for XviDs - install VobSub 2.23. Just Google and read.
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-16T17:19Z,"err.:

Under Linux - there is problems at all. = Under Linux - there is NO problems at all."
