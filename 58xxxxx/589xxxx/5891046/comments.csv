Here are the instructions for nero 7 (these arent by me either but i have them handy)

DVD9 (for recoding to fit on a dvd r without any video/audio loss at all): open the program. on the top where it has favorites/data/audio, click the 4th option which is photo and video. scroll over until you see recode dvd video then click it. this brings up a new screen. on the right click import dvd. find your dvd-r folder and click OK. this will import the dvd-r and gives you the option to remove certain pieces if you wish. then click next. On this menu make sure you click advanced multiple passes (or something like that). Then click burn and it will recode then burn the movie."
