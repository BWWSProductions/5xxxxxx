Note: The filesize is a few MB smaller than usual this time. While checking the episode after re-encoding, I noticed a commercial got left in the 720p rip, at the 14min mark. So instead of making you guys wait two more hours to re-encode it again without the commercial, I just clipped it out using Virtualdubs \"Direct Stream Copy\". (No quality is lost)
