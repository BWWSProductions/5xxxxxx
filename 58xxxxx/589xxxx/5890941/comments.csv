,P0w3rsh0t,2010-10-17T12:59Z,"Everything works except multiplayer. Serial is in 1C folder. This is german version of the game, so you CAN'T change the language."

,dobricic.ar,2010-10-17T13:27Z,"No!I copied the serial and he said it's valid and then said this ,,please insert game compact disk into your drive,, "
,Venctus,2010-10-17T13:48Z,"It works!!

,Matsjo115a,2010-10-18T10:58Z,"@ kevmeister2009, what do you mean with mount the ISO? what do you exactly have to do? Because mine asked also for a compact disc..."
,Matsjo115a,2010-10-18T10:59Z,"@kevmeister2009, what do you have to do to mount the ISO exactly? Because mine asked for a compact disc also and I don't know what to do to mount the ISO...Can you help me?"
[T],DjAligator14,2010-10-18T15:58Z,"this doesn't have crack just a serial. You enter the serial for first time when you enter in game. When you restart your pc or unmount the Landwirtschafts.iso and you want to enter in game it will ask you for the CD. Just mount again Landwirtschafts.iso and there will be no problem. 

English version is announced on 6november. "
,kevmeister2009,2010-10-19T18:33Z,"@Matsjo115a; you have to use ""virtual-drive""ware to mount the game "".ISO"".  I use Alcohol52 when I can.  the game is cracked to be able to use ""virtual-drive""'s but you still need to have the game file (.ISO) mounted."
,kevmeister2009,2010-10-19T18:35Z,"sorry for the double post.

thanx DjAligator14.  I've found a few mods for this thing already.
