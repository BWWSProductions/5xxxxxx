,lusmusen,2010-10-19T17:56Z,"F-Secure Client Security 9.01 detects Trojan:W32/Generic in svc_setup_1.6.5.2.exe. Probably a false positive, or?"
,masterfaster2,2010-10-19T19:37Z,There is a possibility that you will get a virus/trojan alert when you try to install the recording service. False positive or real? That's your choice. I haven't investigate it further as I don't need it.

,ryrgh67,2011-09-09T10:23Z,"Whatever you do NEVER consider paying for this application, the guy that has the company (Bernt Hackbart) is a thief and a criminal and you will NEVER get the key for the application, if you complain he will tell you it's the spam filters and then never send it again. If you complain again and ask for the key he just wont send it, then when you ask for a refund he claims he fullfilled the agreement (even though no working key was sent) and you wont get any money back. So he is a thief and a criminal and this company needs to disappear. The app seems to be a rip of open source applications and codecs anyway so just download something like MediaPortal or use MediaCenter in windows if you are looking for a tv viewer. DO NOT BUY THIS CRAPPY APP ! IT'S FRAUD !!"

Man you gotta chuckle from an outsiders POV

Although I must admit Id be a bit pissed, Surely you can simply get the SAME KEYCODE RE-SENT?  PS. Googled him and here you go.. give him another  call
