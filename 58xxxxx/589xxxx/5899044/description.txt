From the Young Tradition through to the Unthanks, one of the great strengths of the English folk scene has been the tradition of close-harmony vocal work, and the trio of Barry Coope, Jim Boyes and Lester Simpson have been amongst the finest exponents. They haven't exactly been prolific, but over the past 17 years they have recorded a series of powerful albums in which they have covered anything from carols to songs about the devastation of the first world war, as well as collaborating with members of the Waterson-Carthy clan in that vocal supergroup Blue Murder, and working with the National Theatre on an adaptation of Michael Morpurgo's Private Peaceful. Now they have released their first trio set in five years, and it's a virtuoso demonstration of their range. There's everything from a sturdy reworking of Clive James and Pete Atkins's pained and powerful Hill of Little Shoes, Richard Thompson's edgy Keep Your Distance and Robert Burns's The Slave's Lament, while their own new songs are equally varied, from Boyes's political warning Under the Stone and updated satire of The Emperor's New Clothes through to Simpson's powerful Haven, a song of hope for a suffering friend, or a bitter reworking of the Who on We Got Fooled Again. It's all sung a cappella, with occasional minimal percussion and magnificent harmonies throughout.
