The film begins around nighttime in Riverton, Massachusetts, where Sarah Plankov, who is nine months pregnant with a baby boy, is watching the news that the Riverton Ripper's death toll now been added up to seven as security footage at a parking garage shows the killer stabbing a teenage girl, and for the first time, the police have identified the weapon: a pocket knife with the word "vengeance" marked on the blade. Meanwhile, her husband Russian-American resident Abel Plankov (Raul Esparza) is finishing up a little rocking horse for his newborn child. As he's going back up stairs, he trips, and finds the ripper's knife underneath the stairs. While Sarah goes to sleep, Abel calls Dr. Blake (Harris Yulin), his psychologist, (where it's revealed that Abel has a dissociative identity disorder. He doesn't remember killing anyone of the seven kids dead, and he has kept his "D.I.D." a secret from his wife and his 3-year old daughter, Leah.) He tells Dr. Blake that he's losing it again, his family doesn't know about his DID, and he needs his help. Immediately afterward, Dr. Blake calls the police.
