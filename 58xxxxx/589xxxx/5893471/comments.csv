this movie right here is an italian movie w  original italian  audio and dialogue, and it is then DUBBED into  english, so what you get here is an english dubbed movie where the dialogue is not matching up w the charaters lips etc..this is how the movie was originally dubbed  and not the fault of the uploader

see here from wiki:

Language 	Italian (U.S. release dubbed into English language)  

also  to make this movie easier to digest  go to subscene for the subtitles:

Profondo Rosso (Deep Red) - 1975

these subs match up perfectly w the movie's  audio

this will make this movie infinitely  easier  to follow and understand

hope this helps 
just doing my part

thanks for the upload "
