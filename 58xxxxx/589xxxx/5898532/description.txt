Guitar Buyer Magazine
Two-Man Blues Army is a masterclass in rocking garage blues, a feast of big riffs, killer guitar tones and searing vocals. More importantly, the record crackles with the raw, spontaneous energy of a live show, something often absent from many modern blues albums.


Gear Magazine
The album roars into life with a raucous onslaught of soupy, swampy, scruff-of-the-neck revved up Hendrix-y electric guitar, as the appropriately-titled \"Meltdown At The Hoo\" hits top gear and hammers away at your senses! The whole album of killer tunes represents a definite melding of traditional blues-meets-the-21st century.


Steve Bailey, Guitar & Bass Magazine
Equipped with just guitar, vocals and drums, this duo march into battle taking on every blues-rock trick in the book, successfully blasting them to a new level. The duo format leaves plenty of room for Gwyn\'s muscular licks that induce the \'wow\' factor time and time again. No-nonsense, brutal and invigorating.


Blues Matters
Unlike many of his contemporaries Ashton does not resort to clichÃ©, pomp and bluster, but lays down terrific riffs and inserts just enough light and shade to make him a leader in this genre...this is top drawer stuff.
