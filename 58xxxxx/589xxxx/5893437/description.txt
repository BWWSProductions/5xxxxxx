Learn the language of the international copyright conflict! This torrent contains the two CDs which accompany Vera Croghan's book, although they could even be used standalone.
You can get the 1995 edition of the book here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3541894 which seems very similar to the 2006 edition. Kudos to Superloozer for uploading.

I will also upload some raw CD images for anyone wanting to burn verbatim copies of the CDs.

These will play natively on GNU/Linux systems or in VLC, or with plugins in other programs.
