If you need to seek validation in a group, more power to you.  But the rest of us pity fools who cannot think for themselves."

Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Sir Isaac Newton, Michelangelo, et al.

Thank god they didn't ascribe to your logic.  We'd still be shitting in the same place that we eat, like the people of Afghanistan."
