IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Step Up 3D R6.avi  ...... Thanks to whoever
AUDIO:Step Up 3D R6.avi  ...... Thanks to whoever

Right firstly the original source we got wasn't tagged by any name so can't thank them so... but would like to thank MTV for the links ,cheers bro ;-) Well the source is ok but nothing special... could have done alot better rip if we had the vobs, oh well... The audio was nice and picture ok but it does break up some on the fast dancing scenes and also seemed to colourful and seemed to have alot of glares in bright scenes. What we did was first cut the file up into two as there was a difference it black borders so we made two scripts to crop and resize each one differently, well crop differently but resize them to the same res ;-) Also inc a white balance, smoother hi Q, rgb eq, chroma, contrast... need to try and smooth the picture up for when it starts to break up and also lowered the chroma and toned down the glares. Hopefully the source files might come available but for now...
