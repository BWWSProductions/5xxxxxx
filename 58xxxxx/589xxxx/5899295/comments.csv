,leotecasi,2010-10-22T17:31Z,There's anyway this can work in PAL ? I want the BR so bad . 
,eKsiSLe,2010-10-23T16:19Z,The reason you can't find English in the menu is because it is not there!  Thank you for the upload but in the future don't lie an say there is an English Idioma when there is not.  Great upload for those who want Spanish and Portuguese languages for menus and for commentary.  NOT english menus but there is english in game commentary.
