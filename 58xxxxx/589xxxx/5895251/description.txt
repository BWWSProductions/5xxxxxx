Heartland S04E04: Graduation

Amy graduates from Hudson High School, Badger comes to Heartland, Amy and Ashley ponder their futures and one of the horses falls ill. 

The resolution is 624x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Oct 17, 2010. 

CBC has a big Heartland website at http://www.cbc.ca/heartland/
