,rocco_sifredi,2010-10-21T21:35Z,"Why didn't you LET US KNOW frm the beginning that your stinky upload doesn't work , you MORON??? I would've chosen another...provider instead of wasting here hours for something that won't work? "
,WarnedBob,2010-10-22T08:18Z,"shut the hell up rocco_sifredi, shroo's done some of the best rips over the years, and i say he can't be held responsible for shit programing from the game developer"
,MP7560,2010-10-22T15:40Z,Uploaders like Shroo are doing us a service by ripping these games. Stop complaining like spoilt brats and be happy that you can get the game for relatively no cost.
,myers23,2010-10-22T22:01Z,regestration is open at TeamTPTB over the weekend 
,Speal.,2010-10-24T22:34Z,"Hey Shroo, i'm a big fan of your rips i have almost every one of them stored on my external harddrive and i have never had any problems with your rips... but... i'm not able to play this game... i can't even install it properly.
Okay heres my problem:
first i unpack the files, then start setup and it start's working, but as soon as it's done with data.tptb(the first extraction file) it gives me 10% completion and an error ""The system cannot find the file specified.""

i know it's supposed to rebuild data.pcf file now which is in the folder(size of 1 573 819kb) so why isn't that thing able to get on with the process?

Another interesting thing i have found out is that the zip files come out too little.

I know it's supposed to rebuild tptb into pcf file and then pcf file into zip file and then extract the files inside zip and finally delete it.

zip file size should be about equal to tptb file size but they come out in size of ~60mb or ~50mb, around that... and that's another thing that gets in the way of proper install.

i tried unpacking and doing everything all over and over again and sometimes it got over 10% but then it stopped at 20% or 25% and didn't display any messages but didn't go on with the process aswell. Just displaying the precentage and staying like that for hours.

Maybe you can give me some advice or help?
"
,ScottyBox,2010-10-25T07:55Z,"That file that can't be found, is the setup.exe needed for installing Fallout New Vegas. I Uninstalled and Reinstalled the torrent three times. I wasted 4 days of downloading just so I could get my hopes up then let go because of half-ass uploading. Thanks for trying Shroo. If you could update right fast, I'd appreciate it. "
,ScottyBox,2010-10-25T08:03Z,"Ohh and this is the Steam install by the way, don't know if that matters or not but maybe that could be why the setup.exe is missing? "
,unrena,2010-10-26T04:50Z,"Okay, soo.. I ran the Setup.bat and it opened up some pretty colored ssTOnED picture thing with wavey lines and junk.. but that's all it did.. Never opened up any sort of installer progress or anything, ideas or explination?"
,unrena,2010-10-26T04:55Z,"Never mind, found it out. You also need to include in your instructions to the new commers that you need to push esc to exit your little logo program, would be great.. Thanks and sorry to give advice to a pro."
,kaitoukid44,2010-10-26T23:31Z,does it includes the orginal crack and registry? if not we can't patch this game otherwise for fixing bugs and some new content..unlike SKIDROW's upload he always adds the original cracks (for advance user) can patch the game
,heyman1981,2010-10-28T10:47Z,"I just installed game, then patched with skidrow update 2, copy skidrow cracks, it works perfect!! no mouse problems or stuttering gameplay bs other fags complain about

In fact it runs WAY better then F3, dual core optimized :)

Thanks, shroom"
