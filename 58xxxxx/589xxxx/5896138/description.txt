Gia DiMarco is meeting her boyfriend's son for the first time and it won't be something either of them forget soon. After he sees what she's planning to wear to the country club, he refuses to bring her. Gia explains that it's his dad's favorite dress and that he even bought it for her. Still not convinced, he begins to walk away when Gia grabs his pants and shows hm just why his dad keeps her around!!!
