,lfla,2010-11-03T20:58Z,"This games works well on PS3 Jailbrake, its region free (all PS3 games are) and works on internal or external HD. BUUUUT.... the game is realy BLAAAHHH... I do like racing games, but, this one is very very ugly! Nothing in the game is fun! If you want rally game, try DIRT 2! It's arcade, but very fun with nice graphics and presentation! (Sorry about my English, I am brazilian!)"
,donkerinternet,2010-11-05T17:30Z,You may try the other version. From Donkerinternet has lots of more seeders and all the PS3 games are Regionfree ;)
