Following on from her excellent debut album 'Bimbling', Martha's second disc builds on the promise from the previous album and cements her as one of the England's most interesting contemporary folk artists. The term contemporary folk is particularly appropriate for Martha as she mixes her own songs with the occasional traditional song and throughout the disc there's an underlying traditional feel, even though the lyrics have a very contemporary feel.
Instrumentally this is a rich and diverse album, despite the overall 'quiet' feel of the disc, the amount and diversity of the instrumentation used is staggering - acoustic guitar is joined by, amongst others, piano, cello, mandolin, bouzouki, flute and double bass.
While the 11 songs (plus hidden track) and all varied the constant throughout is Martha's pure vocals, her singing is excellent and she creates real atmosphere with her controlled, delicate and distinct phrasing.
With melody rich and accessible songs throughout this is a disc full of memorable tracks, and standout songs include 'Winter Flowers', 'Artificial' and an excellent reading of the popular traditional song 'Silver Dagger'.
Like the album before it 'of Milkmaid and Architects' has an obvious English feel in both it's musical styles and subject matter, and it's references to England's culture hit the mark almost everytime.
With this disc, Martha looks like she's cementing the Tilston name in the new folk generation, just as her father has over the past 30 years. Recommended.
