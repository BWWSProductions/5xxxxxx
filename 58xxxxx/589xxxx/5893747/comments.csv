,DigFunk,2010-10-20T06:23Z,"lol, denman123, creative username asswipe. Big internet tough guy calling other people names on teh intertubez. You're retarded if you don't realize that torrents' speed change with time. For a while, even though 5000 some people had downloaded this, there was like a 35kB/s DL speed(when my normal speed is MUCH faster), because everyone deletes the torrent as soon as they get it, rather than uploading to repay the favor. I'm extremely thankful to EZTV for their quality torrent. Doesn't mean a bunch of DLers arent asshats"
