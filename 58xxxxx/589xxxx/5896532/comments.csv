That being said I don't understand why this torrent fluctuates between 50 and 500 kBps and won't keep a consistent speed. I can't connect to more than 1 seed if I get that lucky and the client constantly shows 0 of 0 seeds. Also, despite being setup step by step in the router, I can't get Vuze to test correct on the port forward. I have a 10MB (i think MB is right) connection."

I tried closing steam when it asks for the code and the game doesn't install. I don't know where the problem is. Some people are claiming to have installed the game without a problem but I don't see how they did that. Some detailed information would have been nice.

Anyways the game plays great on Ultra Settings, no lag or anything. Only problem is the game is pretty much exactly like Fallout 3. But hopefully this will change as the game goes on. Thanks again for the upload, I really admire Skidrow because he doesn't waste his time with shitty games, only the ones worth downloading."
,boydoo,2010-10-20T14:24Z,"Ok I uninstalled steam before i mounted the iso, used poweriso v4.1, when it mounted it automatically started the installation, i didnt click setup.exe or anything like that.

Nothing came up from steam asking for anything, installing as we speak."
,boydoo,2010-10-20T14:28Z,"Just to add, I uninstalled steam via add/remove programs and also removed the registry entries via regedit, instructions on google.

As Skidrow mentioned, if you like this, buy it! Some games are just worth it, hopefully pending bugs/game content and value this should be one of those games we should all support.  "
,Tyl0rC,2010-10-20T14:50Z,"Attention:  IF you do not wish to uninstall steam follow these directions!

1.  Download Phoenix .sid unpacker

2.  update it to version 1.4 and update ContenDescriptionRecord

3.  Mount the ISO

4.  On Phoenix go to Instruments>SID Unpacker

5.  if the file isn't already scanned, go to Scan a SIM FIle

6.  Browse the mounted ISO and open The Fallout New Vegas .SIM file

7.  When it is scanned hit Select all and choose the directory of where you would like the files to unpack to

8.  Copy the crack to your directory

9.  PLAY! "

I used the crack from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5896522/Fallout.New.Vegas-SKIDROW-CrackOnly

it could be the same crack that's in this .iso, but i didn't want to take any chances.  So, before launching the game after installing, I downloaded and extracted the cracks using 7Zip and placed them in Fallout Vegas's main directory.

In the game, when it needs to render NPC's the FPS drops massively (from 50-60 to 5-7). I tried the solution proposed on the mentioned website but it doesn't seem to work. I do have an Nvidia GPU (9600M GS) but I don't think it's related to the card as my friend has a GTX280 and the original game and he doesn't have any problems like this. Also, Fallout 3, which has the same graphics worked perfectly. I think it might be related to the crack. Do you have any suggestions? Thanx"

,MMCDr,2010-10-21T09:46Z,"Yes, this release does work. You have to use a Steam unpacking program like Phoenix, and then it runs perfect.

From the comments section at demonoid: 

codix1 - ""Works fine for me.

Just update Phoenix 1.4. Once you do so, close the program, re-open it and do the following:

Click 'Instruments' -> Update ContentDescriptionRecord -> Mouse over and client 'Internet'

Allow it to do its thing.

Once it has completed, select:

Click 'Instruments' -> SID Unpacker

Here you browse for the SIM file. Once select, click select all, then unpack.

Make a folder on your Desktop called 'Fallout' and observe the unpacking. Once you update your CDR directory, it also rids itself of a progress bar. It'll take a good 10-15 minutes to unpack and once it does, /everything/ will be unpacked into that folder. You can use the SKIDROW cracks to run the game. It runs flawlessly after this, just kinda messy.

Hope this helps."""

Can't complain really, this hasn't even come out in the UK yet so I'm happy :)

To be safe, I disconnected my router and closed Steam when I was installing to avoid any CD key problems. It didn't ask for a CD key, so I guess either I'm lucky or that's what you need to do to avoid it.

""Game Crashes After Cinematic Introduction (Intro Scene)""
You may be missing an important DLL file, especially if you are on a newer version of Windows. This error may pertain very well to DirectX 9. Thanks to ABC for alerting us of this method.

      1. Download the dx9d9.dll: HERE (Nexus)
      2. Put the file in your Fallout: New Vegas folder

If that doesn't work, then try the following:

      1. Load the ""fallout.ini"" and ""fallout_default.ini"" (be sure to set both to NOT Read-Only and make backups of both files)
      2. Locate SMainMenuMovieIntro= and delete the following lines:

    SMainMenuMovieIntro=
    SIntroSequence=
    sIntroMovie=Fallout INTRO Vsk.bik

      3. Save the files, then locate Fallout INTRO Vsk.bik and rename it to whatever you want (i.e. Fallout INTRO Vsk.bik BAK)

The problem should now no longer occur depending on what was causing the crash on your computer."

,darknight670,2010-10-22T20:35Z,"So here a little tutorial for your whiners:
"" My speed are slows!!!!!""
Solution : Go tho speedtest.net and test your connection, note down your upload speed and divide it by 8 then multiply by 1024 ( you want it in Ko/s ) and then in your Bittorent program uncap your download speed and set your upload at 80% of your total upload ( it's what you just noted down)

""They are still slow!!""
Check you ports, you want to redirect/use an open port. Then in your options set the Maximum peers number to something not higher than 200 ( or you router will die under the load )

""Yeah it works now let's download""
Wait young man you forget one thing ! SEEEEEEEED, you should seed AT LEAST until a ratio of 0.3 or 0.5 is reached, 0.8 and your good , 1+ and you understood the philosophy of tpb quite well"

Since the issue is with the keyboard, could you tell us how it is connected? Is it a PS2 or USB keyboard?

And what OS are you on? XP 32? Windows 7 x64? Something else?

I presume you installed the DirectX that comes with the game? (Even if you have a newer version already, the directions suggest it is required)

Also, have you played Fallout 3 on the same system? I believe they use the same engine."

First thing I would like to resond to is posts like "" Fuckin seed ppl 10kb's a sec"". Clearly you do not know how to set up your client and most likely do not even have your port open. There is a max to the number of seeds and peers which by default will be low on a closed port and it doesn't matter if there is 300 seeds or 3000 seeds you can only use so many. If your up speed is to high compared to your down speed then cap it. I have never not once had a problem with down speed or getting a game to work. Something tells me that if you didn't take the time to set up your client then your computer drivers and direct x is outdated or corrupted as well. Time to stop pointing the fingers as you are wrong.

These chipsets require CPU time in order to process audio. Since this game is very CPU intensive lag is to be expected. If your running at full CPU load, then it's going to have a hard time processing audio. Time to get a deticated audio card or upgrade your cpu. Could be an infection as well or another task that is sucking up your cpu. I have had no audio issues myself with this game.

I have not installed it yet myself, but I will be doing that tomorrow. In the meantime, I only have a few ideas that may help.

Do you have an external keyboard that you can use to see if that works?

And sadly, the last piece of advice I can think of is the ""Last resort"" sort of thing. If you are comfortable doing so, I would uninstall every last device within the device manager that I am not actually using. And the same in the BIOS itself.

I disable things like serial ports and the integrated video card since I have a real video card.

Sometimes leaving things like that serial port enabled causes it to try to use an IRQ or DMA that is needed by other things. 

Couple that with the fact that I have not seen a device that actually uses a RS232 serial port in over a decade and you may see the benefit. :)

However, if you are not comfortable with such things you should not touch it. You can easily make things much much much much worse if you change the wrong things.

,OmniNegro,2010-10-25T17:11Z,"@Mashion What problems are you having? You can not find the ""Cracked Content"" on the ever-elusive DVD image that you HAD TO MOUNT TO INSTALL THE GAME ITSELF!

When the image is mounted, it is available in your ""Explorer"" as any disc would be if you put it in your DVD drive. Find it and look for the ""Skidrow"" folder on the disc. Everything you seek is there.

And just to be a jerk, I will quote the instructions. :) (I am not serious, just kidding about this part)

1. Unpack release
2. Mount image or burn it
3. Install
4. Copy the cracked content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD
to the main installation folder and overwrite
5. Play the game

,unique223,2010-10-25T23:23Z,"What the hell is wrong with this torrent? Before you say anything, yes my client is set up correctly (Download limits, UPnP Connection limits) but I'm really struggling with this one. With other torrents I always get near top speed, but with this one I've only gone above 20% speed three times.

Several times I've gotten lucky and connected to a seed that brings me to top speed, but the few times this has happened it's only lasted 10 minutes.

I download things overnight, and when I should have had 4gb done in one night, I've done 1gb, then 2gb, then 1 gb, and then 200mb done each night. Other torrents are fine.

Help me?"

,OmniNegro,2010-10-26T00:10Z,"There are PLENTY of seeders. And even if your client is set up perfectly and you have the fastest connection possible it can STILL be quite slow.

This is not a problem with the torrent itself, nor the client settings in most cases. The problem is that ISPs are getting clever and finding ways to limit or entirely stop any sort of P2P application.

Just changing to a nice high port number does not mean your ISP can not see clearly that you are doing some P2P with TCP and/or UDP.

Be patient and actually bother to read the comments. You certainly have the time to do so. :)

Someone above mentioned searching the hash value so you can add trackers. That may well fix the slow speeds some of you have.

It will work. Just be patient."

,OmniNegro,2010-10-26T06:17Z,"If your video card is made by Intel, then you DO NOT HAVE ANY VIDEO ACCELERATION!

Period. 

Intel makes great CPUs and other things, but they make GPUs that would have been good quality about a decade ago.

Sadly, most notebook computers have no options for changing video cards. But you should check anyway, some actually can use weak low profile cards that cost more than the laptop they install into.

ATI/AMD makes great video cards that are inexpensive and work perfectly for upwards of 90% of the users.

Nvidia also makes great cards, but they are almost always more expensive for a comparable card.

Others will have to tell you more about the Nvidia side of things. I dislike them for reasons that would not interest anyone here.

Because I actually vaguely recall this sort of problem happening already with another torrent I've downloaded about two years ago. 

Also, I don't know about others, but I am currently running Mac OS, and I download everything including this game via Mac and then reboot the computer and play under Windows. Could that be the source of the problem?

,ak_niko,2010-10-28T02:02Z,"Ok, here is the solutions for some of the problems mentioned in the above comments:

1) The install crashes half way through with an error in textures file. Solution: if you downloaded the torrent in one directory, then transferred the image to some other place and booted it from there, this error will appear (don't know why). Boot the image directly from the directory you downloaded it into.

2) the game crashes in the wasteland/after launching the game etc... Solution: 1) download and install second patch by Skidrow. 2) upgrade you RAM - this game is very RAM consuming, especially in the wasteland. alternatively you can minimize RAM consumption by shutting down unnecessary programs such as Skype and making low settings in the game (short drawing distance, etc.)

The above solutions solved my problems. I hope it will help you too.

I am happy to hear that this was not the problem for you. It des still seem like a file system error in some reported cases above. But then it could just be that some people mount the image while it is still in use by the torrent client for seeding.

Seeding is good, but copy the file elsewhere before you mount it so that the torrent program is not holding it with a death grip.

I'll try installing the game under Parallels Desktop later, after I'll have donwloaded it. Also my friend has this torrent on her computer and she installed the game succesfully so she'll give me her copy this Saturday, maybe that works. At least that way I'll know whether something went wrong with my download or something's generally just wrong with my computer. "

,OmniNegro,2010-10-28T20:12Z,"The simple solutions often are the most difficult to see...

I just had the thought of finally generating a hash value for the ISO itself. That way, anyone who thinks their download is corrupt for whatever reason can check and verify it.

So without further delay, her is the CRC32, MD5, and SHA-1 hashes in that order.
CRC32 = 8E367CEE
MD5 = 0EC659326308E34562A6F1B1C5A862CE
SHA-1 = B9408C07D7527FD13F7DAE1E5ACEB83C0CA79636

Those are for the ISO file itself, not the NFO or anything else. This is ONLY for the ISO.

If yours does not match the above, then you have a corrupt ISO. (Or I do, can someone confirm mine?)

There are a variety of programs that can check these values. I use what is know as ""HashTab"" and you can find it easily. It is freeware too. :)

Mac users however, will have to find another utility.

Good luck everyone."
,johnsonatbenson,2010-10-28T22:28Z,"I'm never the guy that cries ""SEEED@!!!"", because I know this is a privilege to get these games absolutely free, but this is fucking ridiculous.  10kb/s is just ridiculous.  Many people don't understand how torrenting works, the only way to get the game is for other people to SEED.  If no one seeds, no one gets the game.  It's as simple as that.  If people sacrifice a little, everyone will get what they want."

Do not worry about it. Many people here do that the first few times they post.

I too am a ""try before you buy"" sort. I loved the concept of shareware games back when shareware did not mean adware or malware.

Remember Wolfenstein? No, not the new one. I mean the pre-Doom days. Back when you download the shareware versions off of a BBS at a whopping 2400 baud.  (Most people here will require wikipedia to understand BBS and Baud.)

I have not even installed or played the game yet. I probably will just buy the damned thing and be happy. I support developers who do not make crap.

Anyone check the CRC32, MD5, or SHA-1 yet?"

Mac OS has a built-in Terminal utility that executes commands and it can count hash values. Mine seem to match. I guess that means it's some kind of a file system error after all. Too bad, I wanted to play this so much! Now I'll have to wait till they start selling the game here in my country and that's probably going to take a while."

Thanks for confirming the hashes.

The problem does seem to mostly be Mac only. And as Zohzoh said, both HFS and NTFS should handle this just fine.

Perhaps someone on a Mac could explain the way that the image is mounted? In Windows, pretty much everyone used Daemon Tools for such thing. But just like the hash checking, I have no idea how any of this is done on a Mac.

It sounds like yet another stupid protective scheme is fucking things up for people. Games are almost always available cracked and free before you can even buy them, yet the stupid developers still insist on using Securom/Safedisc/some other form of rape to fuck things up.

Then they have the nerve to whine about piracy. Make games that actually work and people will not be as motivated to ""Try before you buy"". Period. Rant off. :)"

However- I am not sure it it's the game or the torrent, but I have had issues with freezes and crashes. Seems to happen when loading new areas or in transition. Game freezes then says ""fallout has encountered and unexpected error"" or something like that. Happens maybe once every 4 hours of playing.

The torrent is just fine, but the game is BUGGY AS HELL.  Was a nightmare to get the audio working properly over optical 5.1. Then once I get that working (had to downgrade to 2.1, apparently there is no other way to do it) and got all the skidrow updates installed, the game randomly freezes ALOT.  Its Bethesda's fault, they should have never released this garbage untill it was more stable.  After this stupid freaking mess I will wait a few months for an update or 2 and buy it for xbox, worry and hassle free. Save your time and might wanna do the same.

Having to downgrade to 2.1 audio was the kicker for me, the freezes just topped it off. This game needs 5.1 and the xbox has that without any probs :)"

Once you've got that, winrar the .iso, it'll be a winrar book icon. Once you rar it, open it up and click on setup.exe it'll install it on your computer. Once you've done that, go to your program files on your computer and search for a Bethesda folder and then go into Fall Out New Vegas folder. In there you'll find three files that have the pipboy icon: Fallout NV (Icon), Fallout NV (App), and Fallout Launcher (App). Delete the launcher, and the NV App file. After which go the exported rared iso. wherever you saved on your computer, find the SKIDROW file and copy the same Apps you just deleted (FalloutNV, Fallout launcher) copy them, and paste them in the folder where you deleted the previous ones. Now open up Daemon Tools, don't try to burn the iso. image cause its 6gb+ so you'll have to mount it on your computer, the file you have to mount is called ""sr-fnv"" itll have the Pipboy icon. [FYI Mounting is like burning the image to the CD, but rather than a CD you are doing it on your computer] Right-click on the pipboy icon in Daemon and click ""Mount Image"". Now if you've done everything correctly you should go to ""My Computer"" and under Devices you'll see ""BD- Rom New Vegas"". If you see this youre golden. Now click on Fall out New Vegas icon on your desktop and it should take you to the launcher. Click play and it should load fine. If you receive a message prompting you about "" d3dx9_38.dll"" this means that your DirectX software is out of date or did not install with the installation process. All DirectX is is a software that helps running high quality audio and video, such as video games. To solve this simply download the latest version of DirectX, you should be able to easily find the site and updater on google."

,monstermac77,2010-12-22T05:41Z,"BOOTCAMP/PARALLELS USERS - TEXTURES.BSA INSTALLATION ISSUES 

I've spent over twelve fucking hours trying the variety of suggestions made in the comments to fix this issue. First of all, you want to make sure that your source file is actually valid (as in not corrupt), this can be done by force checking after downloading on your mac. I downloaded the file twice with Vuze on my mac, I'm not sure if those who downloaded it on their windows partition came to the same problem, but let it be known that this solution worked for the iso downloaded on the mac. After reading all of the pages of comments, the problem clearly arises from a change in directory of the iso (for example, from the mac partition to the windows partition). It appears that after the iso is copied, no amount of file manipulation, unpacking, or blow jobs can get it back to working. So, you can't move the iso from its original directory (at least from mac partition to windows partition, I'm not sure about within the partition, I assume that's ok). SOLUTION :

1. Mount the .iso from its original downloaded directory (in my case it's on my mac, perhaps it's on your pc, if it's on your pc and this happened, try to perform steps that are equivalent to these only from an original pc download point of view). 
2. Copy all of the files from the mounted iso onto a folder that both your mac and pc can see. (Note that your PC will not be able to install from this folder because any folder you use will not be writable by an NTFS partition). 
3. Boot up your PC and navigate to the file that you saved all of the contents of the mounted ISO to, then copy all of these files and paste them to a folder on your desktop or wherever you want. 
4. Run from this folder and the install should work. It did for me. I believe this is what I did, I was booting back and forth between my P.C. and Mac with a few things I could try in mind and once I saw it pass the textures2.bsa, I was so overwhelmed by excitement that I don't really remember. 

Post comments to tell me if this worked, I can help you, I'll check this torrent every so often to see if someone needs help. If I put up the wrong instructions, I'll figure out what I did and correct them, if it works for you, then fuck yes. "

,thizzlor,2010-12-29T19:43Z,"Okay, so here's how to install it....
1) (uninstall if needed)
2) Mount the ISO (I use DAEMON Tools Lite)
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite
...If you need help using the tool, google it...
3) Install
4) Don't install the Visual ++ thing or the Directx
5) Once completed, don't run the game just quite yet. You need to install both the Visual ++ and the games Directx MANUALLY!
6) You do this manually by first opening the new Fallout installed file. Usually something like this C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout New Vegas.
7) Now open the ""Redists"" file.
8) First run and install the ""vcredist***"" file.
9) Now open the ""directx"" file.
10) You need to run and install the ""DXSETUP"". It's an .exe somewhere in that file. 
11) You might want to restart and then your good to go!"

I selected 'new game' and the cinematic plays, once the cinematic is over the game begins to load. halfway through the initial load of the game, it crashes. it has done this every time. I've reinstalled it and everything, several times. I also installed the update after the first three crashes. I tried it after the update without the cracks, and of course it didn't even start up. I replaced the cracks after the update and the same thing happens, crash during the first load of the game.

,Murdermaru321,2011-05-07T00:15Z,"To answer my previous posts. I have found the reason, for the most part, to the question posed by myself and others. The black screen (crashAPP) that occurs for some users after the first cutscene is due to an incompatible video engine. This can be an issue with the game's compatibility with multi-cores and with certain enthusiast's cards (like my ATI HD 6970). There has been a third party patch created to rectify this 'glitch.' I have added a link below to the web page that may help you.

As a huge fan of the fallout series and avid supporter of 'SKIDROW' I just want to say that this is a great torrent. Keep up the 'good' fight!

In the instructions it tells you to install the Direct X that comes with this download which is Direct X version 9.

i looked up the specs of your laptop
sorry you dont meet the specs
your graphics card, which is integrated into your motherboard is 128mb, you need 512(maybe 256 idk)
integrated g-cards are horrible they are more of chips instead of cards

you cant get a graphics card for your laptop, well you can do this thing that plugs into your usb port but it costs ~$1k and runs like crap

i had the same problem with my laptop so i got a comp for around 700(6cores 1.5gb g-card)

,Gamez4You,2011-07-15T04:39Z,"wow really... every one of you guys that can't get this working don't deserve to play. Skidrow makes always crack their games noobfriendly, and only someone retarded couldn't ge this working. But I guess some people are just born slow...

Anyways I guess i'll explain it step by step for the noobies.

First of all, after you finished downloading it, Mount the winrar or the .iso image, or whatever, with your Mount N Drive manager, or whatever program that mounts iso files. Just install the game. Be sure to install the Directx and the Microsoft C++ package. After you've finished with that, copy/paste the cracked FalloutNV application and launcher to the original ones, which are in the main folder in you're BethesdaSoftwords/FalloutNV folder. It should work.

If it says you're missing a .dll file, like it did with me, google the .dll files, download them, and simply put them in the folder. It's easy as that.

Thanks AiTB for uploading."

1. Download this torrent.
2. Download PowerISO
3. Once the torrent has downloaded, double click on the .iso file and open it with PowerISO.
4. Click ""Continue un-registered"" and then make a new folder in a drive or on your desktop called ""Fallout New Vegas"".
5. Open the folder that you just made, and then go into the .iso that you opened with PowerISO.
6. Press Control + A to copy all files in the PowerISO and then drag and drop into the 'Fallout New Vegas' folder that you made.
7. Wait for all the files to be extracted.
8. Once they've all extracted run the 'Setup' file in 'Fallout New Vegas'.
9. Direct the setup to the same folder. (Fallout New Vegas)
10. Once it's installed, go in the Skidrow folder and copy everything inside.
11. Now go inside the folder which has your installed Fallout New Vegas folder and paste the cracks in there.
12. Overwrite both files and then run Fallout New Vegas.

Hope that helps anyone who struggles. Thanks AiTB!"

Can somebody tell me how could i resolve the problem, and i tried downloading alot of other versions, but they're all skidrow and they're all doing the same thing....! HELP ME PLS"
,maukbt,2012-01-22T17:20Z,"Thanks for the upload!

Works great on my PC!

I'll seed"
,xhizors,2012-01-26T04:23Z,"REMEMBER

Be sure to use the DirectX version included with the release,
as it's needed to run this game.


After you install it, go to your PROGRAM FILES folder, then Bethesda Softworks\Fallout New Vegas\Redists\directx\

RUN DXSETUP.EXE

They don't make it clear where the DX install is, hope this helps."
,qu1zzical,2012-01-28T13:36Z,"I don't get it. I thought I was good with torrents. Obviously not. I install the game. Move the two files from the cracked file into the main installation folder. I click to play the game. 


Missing ""xindut11.dll"" or something like that. I then go to the directx install in the folder and install it. Problem fixed. 

Then I go to start it up and it says something about a ""steam_api.dll"" file is missing. I download that and put it in the folder. Something about I don't have something that deals with steam launcher or something. So I download Steam hoping it would fix it somehow. Nope.

What am I doing wrong?"
,qu1zzical,2012-01-28T13:58Z,"Ok, so now I got past that problem by adding Fallout New Vegas to my library in Steam. Now when I start it up it says error code 53.

Frustration..."
,JussiWarcon,2012-01-28T20:41Z,No dlc's or anything?
,qu1zzical,2012-01-28T21:47Z,"@JussiWarcon Since one will probably answer you, no. The DLC's are in Update 7 by Skidrow for New Vegas.

I know everything but how to fix my own problem."
,JussiWarcon,2012-01-29T11:49Z,Well I got a problem here it says that I miss steam_api.dll how do I fix this? I'm kinda new to this I've just downloaded simple things so far...
,qu1zzical,2012-01-31T03:50Z,"@JussiWarcon you can Google it and download it and put it in the main folder your game is installed to. 

I had to do the same thing, but after I did that I got a ""steam error code 53"". since I can't find a fix for that anywhere, I gave up on this torrent."
,686866,2012-02-06T00:43Z,"qui1zzical:

Steam is a program that runs games and such, and is also a messenger etc. The reason you're getting an error is because this game requires the program to run, and you need to download Steam itself. Now I'm not 100% Sure it'll work, but that's the problem

Http://www.steampowered.com/

That should be the URL, broski"
,ofidio,2012-02-07T03:03Z,"The torrent works perfectly and all the extra contents as well as the update 7 are working smoothly.
The only problem is the game it self. If you though this was going to be as enjoyable as Fallout 3 forget it, you wont be able to open important areas in the beginning unless you know exactly where to spend your skill points."
,ofidio,2012-02-13T18:48Z,"a lillte foot note, the game tends to ""not responding"" when transitioning from areas. Ctrl+Alt+Del and Alt+Tab are your friends"
,gandalf9922,2012-02-25T12:10Z,crashes when i start it have installed the crack and directX still wont work
,ozm1lk,2012-03-01T04:25Z,"Everyone seems to be having the same problem if im correct ""skidrow"" Groupies always check the crack file they leave everything there steam_api and .dll plus the exe for updates... usually"
,ozm1lk,2012-03-01T04:28Z,if u have any other skidrow games u can litterally grab there crack file (except exe obviously) and drag and drop into fallout pretty sure or u can messaround with some dll with a program
,superhiffy,2012-03-13T14:05Z,"When i open this it comes up with about 70 files entitled sr-fnv.r01 - sr-fnv.r65
if i click on any of them they wont open and it comes up with a question asking what program to open them with. i cannot mount the files either, what do i do?"
,5iF3R,2012-03-13T20:39Z,"I recommend Zombie Apocolypse and the real damage addons to this great game :))

Oh, and thanks uploader-dude!"
,superhiffy,2012-03-14T09:38Z,PROBLEM: I can get into the main menu with no problems but as soon as i try to start a new game or actually play it loads/works for about 2 seconds then crashes and doesnt give any error id code just says it has stopped working. I have tried reinstalling it 3 times now
,PrivateGames,2012-03-17T14:05Z,"if your missing a .dll file, Download it from the internet and put it in your System32 folder"
,HackD,2012-03-17T19:56Z,"@privategames I did as you said, it took care of the first one, but I downloaded the second one, and it says I am still missing it. any clues?"
,JDlaod,2012-03-26T08:31Z,"Works exactly like a console version, right down to the chick ""sunny"" or something disappearing only to have her dog wander around... BTW does anyone have a clue where she is after the gas station mission? But yea great upload dude!"
,Slacker4hire,2012-03-28T05:23Z,Wheb I try to install I keep getting errors when it comes to the voice. batch files???any advice
,n4h,2012-04-05T22:58Z,"fantastic. used ENB d3dx9_40.dll and the game runs like a champ, along with a couple performance mods. also used the update 7, which seems to be working alright for me, at least. no complaints here. "
,n4h,2012-04-05T23:01Z,"works great, man. thanks a million. i wasn't going to wait 6 hours for steam to let me load my copy when i could have this in under 2. and now my pc doesn't have to read the disc anymore! even better!"
,italia98,2012-04-21T17:42Z,Works great! it crashes when i fast travel but that was because you have to get the new patch update 7 just to let everybody know
,guthrie2010,2012-05-09T00:15Z,"works great, thanks!"
,SilentHeroIV,2012-05-19T22:37Z,Do I launch using the FalloutNV app or the FalloutNV Launcher? Please answer ASAP!!! Thanks.
,SilentHeroIV,2012-05-19T22:46Z,Which App do i use to launch the game? Theirs FalloutNV and Fallout NV Launcher. They both get me onto the menu so i can check the options and Play the game.

,tiz2,2012-05-29T19:20Z,"@ BoDog194: Ofc it works. You can assume everything that has been on the top 100 for even a day works. If it doesn't work for you you should never say ""it doesn't work"" but instead ""what am I doing wrong?"""

,spacelad101,2012-06-07T21:38Z,"Works perfect here, you may need to copy the crack files from another skidrow game into the installation directory of this game (steam_api.dll, steam_appid.txt, Steamclient.dll, and SKIDROW.ini)."

It's extremely frustrating and I'd really appreciate if a bro could explain how I can get the script extender working.

You can send me a e-mail at alpha.as.phuck@gmail.com, thank you :D"
