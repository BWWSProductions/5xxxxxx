It has been stuck in over 90% since the 1st few days. What is it going to take to finish!! I could get it somewhere else by now but what is the point! Everyday I come home from work thinking ""this will be the day"" and everyday I am disappointed. Ur killing me here. Most of your stuff is good, U are a great user and I like your torrents which is why I downloaded in the 1st place. I have a great connection, a good PC, I usually can get a movie in under a hour is it has goo seeders, but this is just crazy. "
