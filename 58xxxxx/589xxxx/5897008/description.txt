HQ very rare tv show promo. AVRO's "TopPop" was the first weekly pop program 
broadcast on Dutch television. It ran from September 22, 1970 to June 27, 1988. 
"TopPop" was mainly filled with pop artists in the top pop studio, playing to 
their latest hit. I'm Your Boogie Man" is a popular song by KC and the Sunshine 
Band from their 1976 album "Part 3". Richard Finch told Songfacts that this was 
written about a DJ at a Miami, Florida radio station called Robert W. Walker, 
who was the first to give their hit single "Get Down Tonight" airplay. In 1977 
the song reached the #1 position on the Billboard Hot 100. The single reached #3 
R&B, and #41 in the UK.  (video does not have any logos)
