,DanielM8214,2010-10-19T18:24Z,"Thank you, took until the movie was released in europe for it to be uploaded, still thank you"
,shasha2333,2010-10-19T20:15Z,"You can complain about the AV quality, but other than the people walking in front of the camera, it's pretty standard quality for a cam or TS, and it is the only copy by any group, so if you don't like it, don't watch it at all."
,traineetorrent,2010-10-20T03:18Z,download if you aint bothered by ppl walking in the way or poor quality i found this to be a complete waste of my time thanks but no thanks 
,xMajesticMeteorx,2010-10-20T04:43Z,Please gawd don't let this be more crappy spam for infoavi.com.  I beg of you gawd!?!
,PDXFletch,2010-10-20T06:34Z,"I would not download it, it is too good for this quality.  But if you have to, it's watchable.  I appreciate the upload, sorry if I sound like I don't.  ;-)"
,KeijiMusashi,2010-10-20T11:30Z,"Why do you guys even bother to talk shit about the quality like comparing it to DVDs?

It's a fucking CAM based on typical CAM videos what would the quality be like?

Obviously its shit compared to say a dvd....

I'll give it a fair evaluation later when finished."
,bl0nk,2010-10-20T16:05Z,"very watchable, screen is slightly blurred but completely captured. audio is good, music is skewed a bit.

thanks for this, film is actually pretty engaging."
,tokarsss,2010-10-20T17:24Z,"hey dude, thanx for the movie. It was VERY watchable, A:8 v:9 VERY good cam. Could you upload Jackass 3D next? Many thanx if you can. "
,Arc101,2010-10-20T19:51Z,"KeijiMusashi, it's their opinions. They are just saying it is so well of a movie to wait for a DVD Rip. no reason to troll on us because you feel like you have anger issues. no offence. just watch it."
,jlkf3,2010-10-20T21:52Z,"WTF PEOPLE!!!

This is a very good CAM XViD!!
Please ignore the BQO's above because unlike most cams you can actually watch it!! Ive taken a screen shot of the sample video below so you can all see with your own eyes.  

Audio is 8
Video is 7

,referhead,2010-10-20T22:43Z,"@KeijiMusashi
 so other people cant compare to what most of us call ""standard"" which is DVD. but YOU can? i would use your ratings to pick up my dogs shit. egotistical bitch.

and btw its not great. but if u wanna watch w/o taking out a loan, this is the only version up. ive check 3 sites and probly 10 different torrents but all is the exact same."
,awsomethanks,2010-10-21T04:00Z,"some of you people must be smoking crack, this is a cam but probably the best one i have ever seen, WORTH the download if u want to c this movie "

,matt0678,2010-10-21T22:38Z,Quality isn't the best but it is pretty good for a cam. It is for sure watchable.
,downloader979,2010-10-22T04:30Z,"I downloaded this a few days ago, so i'm sure speed has improved since then, but i got up to 500 k/s. As far as quality goes this is a pretty good cam- if you are expecting dvdrip quality, you are expecting too much. 
I would say v:4-5 a:6. 
Thanks for the up!"
,downloader979,2010-10-22T04:46Z,"Also, to clarify my rating- I rated comparing to dvd quality. This is a very good cam- no flicker, and very steady. I have uploaded screen shots for anyone interested: http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/8473/thesocialnetworkcamwwwi.png"
,born2b,2010-10-23T01:25Z,Thanks!

,pesko7,2010-10-24T10:19Z,subtitle link plz......
,neekitz,2010-10-24T17:41Z,"Excellent copy for a cam recording. Much more watchable than other cam movies I've seen lately, and ALL in english, yay! "
,xBigChillinx,2010-10-26T00:20Z,"Unix You must really think highly of yourself calling people newbs. People have a right to bitch. This torrent came out a month after it's release date and it's still in crappy cam format. 

There's no point in uploading crap quality if I can already go watch the matinee for 3-4 dollars..."
,Anurag284,2010-10-26T08:50Z,This is pure crap quality and destroys the whole pleasure of watching a film . I Wonder why tagged it as good quality.UNWATCHABLE!!!!!!
,Anurag284,2010-10-26T11:53Z,"I an sorry i take my comment back as calling it as a unwatchable print. It is some what watchable if you are too desperate to watch this movie and can't wait any longer .visuals are all fine but main problem lies with the sound; some of dialogue are not audible but that is expected from CAM recording. Movie is very good and i recommend you all to watch in theater and for rest of restless soul like, you won't be very much disappointed watching through this torrent."
,bungchow7,2010-10-27T02:49Z,"A: 7
V: 7
M: 8
for a cam this movie is quite watchable, a lil blurry and dark in spots, nothing beyond the unusual, but still pretty good cam copy. Its a decent movie as well, wow that Zuckerberg is a douche......"
,.Leto.,2010-10-27T19:22Z,"Decent cam but I prefer the iLG release. I've downloaded both, Imagine colors are totally washed out, everything looks grey. They went too far when they tried to lighten up the picture. Colors are more realistic in the iLG release."
,Windoze7,2010-10-29T10:01Z,"@ Chaos17

Try to record TV with your super high tech camera, just try it!"
,agazzis,2010-10-29T15:52Z,anyone got srt (subtitle) file for this movie yet
,Whit3_Addict,2010-11-06T18:54Z,poor audio
,uzpurne,2010-11-16T14:43Z,It has a Trojan.
