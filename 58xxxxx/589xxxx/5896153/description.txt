NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........The Social Network

Well here we go with a first release of this one...
Thanks to Secret Sauceifier on this one... Nice work bro... First we did a small
script containing crop,resize,white balance,rgb eq,sharpness,chroma,brightness,contrast......
The source video was very dark so we had to lighten it up a bit to make it more visible, but
turned out okay considering. It has some dark scene's in it along with light scene's so it
was a matter of keeping balance there. The audio is pretty good cam audio, but we did filter a few
things to make the vocals stand out more and remove some small amounts of noise.

Enjoy folks...
