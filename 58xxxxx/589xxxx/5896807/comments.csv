,Johnsun,2010-10-25T04:15Z,"@kevinstyles  I think the missing file ""d3dx9_38.dll"" is associated with Directx software.  Install the Directx9.0 program when it asks you to while installing FalloutNV.  I had the same problem with a similar file name.  hope that helps"

,shea2152,2010-11-04T15:58Z,"Hey guys. major problem. First of all when downloading there are about 60 RaR files downloading which is kind of wierd. But when I go into magicDisk or daemon Tools to mount, and I mount the .iso , it says "" failed to mount cd/dvd image! "" , i've tried magicDisk and Deamon Tools. So I guess it just downloaded wrong, grr :( "

First of all the first rar you see in the lsit double click, then extract to anywhere (remember where tho) Now mount the sr-fnv (.iso) and it will work fine"
