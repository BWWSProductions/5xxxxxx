::Sams Teach Yourself Regular Expressions in 10 Minutes::

RegEx is supported in all major development environments (for use in editing and working with code) and will thus appeal to anyone using these tools. In addition, every JavaScript developer should be using RegEx, but most don't as it has never been taught to them properly before. Developers using ASP, C#, ColdFusion, Java JSP, PHP, Perl, Python, and more can (and should) be using RegEx, and so every one of them is a potential reader too. The reader of this book will learn how to:

Match characters sets 

Match repeating characters (using minimums and maximums if needed) 

Match (or ignore) based on case 

Build sub-expressions 

Use all of the special characters 

Work with excape sequences 

Use POSIX classes to simplify complex expressions 

Use back-references 

Use look-behind operators 


Sams Teach Yourself Regular Expressions in 10 Minutes is a tutorial book organized into a series of easy-to-follow 10-minute lessons. These well targeted lessons teach you in 10 minutes what other books might take hundreds of pages to cover. Instead of dwelling on syntax, terminology, and arcane examples and scenarios, this book takes a very hands-on approach to solving the needs of the majority of RegEx users who simply need to manipulate data.
