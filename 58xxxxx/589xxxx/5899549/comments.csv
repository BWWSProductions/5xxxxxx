Every torrent for the same, but slightly different file only serves to water down things, so that none of the torrents can achieve maximum speeds.

Your torrents, if they're original as I've suggested in point 1, will probably be whored. Someone will download them, do something to change the torrent hash (such as adding a TXT file, and upload them somewhere else. [If they simply reupload, without doing anything which changes the torrent hash, that's a good thing.]

They may or may not give you credit but that doesn't really matter. The point is that they will confuse downloaders and split the swarm--dividing the future seeders will reduce speeds for everyone and shorten the life of your torrent/result in you having to do more seeding.

Since your torrent will have been up first, it ought to have more seeders than the competition. You could not be faulted for adding a succinct and polite comment to any such torrents you discover, directing potential downloaders to the earlier and better seeded torrent. You should NOT get into a slanging match--that will only reflect poorly on you. You may wish to use a puppet account to post the comment--so that it appears to be coming from a disinterested third party. "
