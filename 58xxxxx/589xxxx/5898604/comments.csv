,i_am_sid,2010-10-21T03:39Z,"@Pluto999

"
,i_am_sid,2010-10-21T03:52Z,"@Pluto999
You know buddy, why Im your fan? Coz quality of your upload is great and most important, you use 'MP4' container for your uploads. But you did my request in 'MKV'(which my DVD player does not support). Still its fine.
Just a request, do rip your files in MP4. But in the end its upto you to choose.
A lot of thanks."
,dkhere,2010-10-21T06:32Z,"@i_am_sid: Hey .mp4 doesnt provide this much clarity...
I love only .mkv format..."
[V],prashant22,2010-10-21T10:28Z,"@dkhere
no u r wrong here..u actually cannot tell the difference..why? because they provide same quality...

n pluto999 welcome back buddy..."
,dkhere,2010-10-21T10:58Z,"^^^
The one diff that i can tell is i havent seen a 720p format with around 600MB using a .mp4 container... Thats why..."
[V],prashant22,2010-10-21T11:44Z,"@dkhere
well chech this
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5845946
its 400mb only using mp4 container...or check my torrents..
a file of suppose 600mb using either mkv or mp4 will give same quality..."
[V],pluto999,2010-10-21T15:50Z,"@all: ty guys for such warm welcome.

@dkhere : clarity depends on the codec you use, in this case i use x264 codec and by mistake i forgot to change the container to mp4 and by default its MKV. So i hope your doubts are cleared by now."
,i_am_sid,2010-10-21T15:51Z,"@dkhere
Both MP4 and MKV are container with same quality. One difference I can remember is that, MP4 file can not have AC-3 audio.Dont know if it does now and I guess it is also not open source. 
I like MP4 only because it is supported by my DVD player.  "

,ronthebuddy,2011-06-24T16:39Z,"The movie is a real crap, no offence..... two hrs of bullshit. Dunno how it got a rating of 7.7 on Imdb"
,Crollo,2011-07-05T03:03Z,"Hey Pluto, mind sharing the name of the program you use to encode your rips?"
,Tukkoo,2011-10-10T15:59Z,"This rip is kinda stretched.

Use this

,enonumus,2012-02-21T05:00Z,"Bitrate was way too low for full resolution 720P movie.  Too much detail was lost trying to squeeze the file size down to nothingness for no good reason, considering storage space costs next to nothing nowadays.  Anything smaller than 1GB for a full length, full 720P resolution movie is just a waste of time, and even that size is going to compromise a lot.  Ideal file size for a typical 16x9 720P movie is at least 1.5-2GB, slightly less if it's a 2.35 or 2.40 AR movie with the black bars cropped away.

As far as the container goes, MKV is the best container for a variety of reasons, it's just not the most compatible currently.  Mp4 is the most widely accepted, but it's slower to work with if you have to extract or remux files.  No complaints here about the MKV container."

For a 720p, this is a complete disaster!
Skip this if you appreciate your time.
