,frodo5555,2010-10-17T15:05Z,"Oh, come on! Just watched it and it looks more like very bad VHS rip then DVD rip at best... There is a frame back jeark every half second or so and there is some serious sidewise image crop (like letterbox mode but 90ì§¸ in rotation).

VHSRip of better quality in video and audio (and half the size) can be found here:

,NerdyJustin,2010-10-17T18:49Z,"wow frodo. perhaps you need a new player. no idea what ""back jearks"" is, so I assume you mean jerks, but there is none. it plays smoothly at 25 frames per second and is great quality for a 1970 movie. I assure you it's a DVD rips since I ripped it myself. get a new video player and stop whining. and also please learn to spell, it's rather important in life."
,frodo5555,2010-10-18T00:03Z,"Hi, NerdyJustin! Usually my BSplayer is quite reliable. I have never seen something like that before... It looks something like this (""back jearks"") in my case:
frame001,frame002,frame003,frame002,frame004,frame005,frame004,frame006...
So I assumed it was a video problem, my bad if I was wrong. English is not my native language, but in my language, we usually start sentences with capital letters, more like ""Wow"" and ""Perhaps"" instead of ""wow"" and ""perhaps"", so please learn grammar, it's rather important in life;-)
Thank you for upload, once again!"
,charlesno,2010-10-18T03:33Z,"no complaints here! movie plays smoothly and has great audio! thanks uploader!
(been looking for this one forever! ignore the frodo kid)"
,bupthrockmorton,2010-10-29T01:13Z,"I downloaded this one and also found it sort of ""jerky."" I can see what Frodo meant, as it looked as though this were filmed from a source VHS with a tracking problem. I tried to watch it on both windows media player and Divx, same issue.
Thanks for trying though Nerdy Justin!"

,FFawcett,2011-05-30T11:12Z,"This is not a DVDRip. And yes, theres is a lot of unnecessary black space on the left and right side."
,Rinzler,2011-08-07T04:14Z,"looks like the same quality ripped from the A.A.A.G. DVD which featured this movie.
none the less, much better than any other I've found over the years.
