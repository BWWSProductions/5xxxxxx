,dedutch,2010-10-21T06:43Z,"sound is good and the picture is as well for a cam. downloaded it by accident as i thought it was a dvdrip (durrr) but eventhough its not it isnt as bad as most cams, im still gonna wait for the dvdrip.
its an oliver stone movie and they're usually pretty good so worth the wait.

taken al this in consideration i would rate:

picture 6
audio 7 "
