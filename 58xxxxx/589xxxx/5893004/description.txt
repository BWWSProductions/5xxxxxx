Prepare yourself for an hour of Britains' favourite fat, er, bloke, as he entertains a riotous crowd live in Northampton. Filmed in April 2002, Chubby is more outrageous and filthy than before - even the Queen Mother can't escape the Chubby treatment! Enjoy Roy Chubby Brown at his rudest and crudest best and see why all his live shows really are Standing Room Only.
