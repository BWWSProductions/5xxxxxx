Ashton is joined by bass player Chris Glen and drummer Ted McKenna on this ferocious outing. Chris and Ted will no doubt be familiar from their days in The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, Ian Gillan Band and the Michael Schenker Group. There's even a cameo by Don Airey, former Rainbow, Whitesnake, Gary Moore, Black Sabbath and now Deep Purple keys man. Prohibition shuffles a smart selection of tough rocking styles; including Gwyn's soulful tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan, 'Rest In Paradise'. Gwyn Ashton has toured the UK, Europe, the USA and his native Australia extensively in his rewarding career, making friends and fans from across the globe.
