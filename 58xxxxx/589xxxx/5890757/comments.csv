,eNLogic2000,2010-10-22T01:12Z,I burned this 3 times. all 3 discs were unreadable. it also failed an ABGX stealth check. I think this is fake or corrupt.
,eNLogic2000,2010-10-22T13:26Z,"I burned it 4 times. Fail. Also fail ABGX Stealth check. I think this torrent is missing like 10 files. I found another torrent, same game, released by MARVEL, which has 14 more files(7.3GB). "
,dragongard91,2010-10-22T13:52Z,"Game works great! Thanks AiTB
ABGX Stealth Check is oké..."
,eNLogic2000,2010-10-22T21:02Z,"Ok, my bad. The game does work. I have been having a lot of problems with ""Unreadable"" discs lately. Especially the newer games.

I re-checked the download. I ran ABGX. It passed. I burned and verified. I put the game in: Unreadable.

So I found out that if you open the disc tray, then tilt the XBox up, almost vertical, for some reason it helps the drive read the discs. That ended up working. Sounds stupid i know, but try it if you have unreadable disc errors. It works.

Anyways, this torrent DOES WORK. I am on NTSC USA Region."
,Linkmrr,2010-10-23T06:12Z,"i had to sign in to tell you this dude but thats not the discs its your drive on ur xbox fuckin up lol soon you will have to hold it front up slanted and beat on it to make it work, itll keep gettin worse till it quits completly lol"

,infinitysend,2010-10-27T15:14Z,"Hey guys... when I try to unrar it, I get all the way to 62% and it tells me I ""don't have enough disk space available""!??!?!

This makes NO sense, as my HD has 175GB free!  Any help, suggestions?  I even downloaded it twice and it does the same thing -- stuck on 62%!"
