Leon Bronstein is not your average Montreal West
high school student. For one thing, none of his
peers can claim to be the reincarnation of early
20th century Soviet iconoclast and Red Army hero
Leon Trotsky. When his father sends Leon to public
school as punishment for starting a hunger strike
at Papa\'s clothing factory, Leon quickly lends new
meaning to the term \'student union\', determined as
he is to live out his pre-ordained destiny to the
fullest and change the world
