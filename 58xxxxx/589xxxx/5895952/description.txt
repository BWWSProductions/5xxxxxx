          "Love Song" lyrics
I'll be the ticket if you're my collector 
I've got the fare if you're my inspector 
I'll be the luggage, if you'll be the porter 
I'll be the parcel if you'll be my sorter 
(chorus) 
Just for you here's a love song 
Just for you here's a love song 
And it makes me glad to say 
It's been a lovely day 
And it's okay 
I'll be the mail, you'll be the guard 
I'll be the ink on your season ticket card 
I'll be the rubbish, you'll be the bin 
I'll be the paint on the sign if you'll be the tin 
(chorus) 
(chorus) 
Its Okay x 4

           "Suicide" lyrics
There's too much confusion for a young man to take 
Look at my eyes that ain't easy to fake 
I've got no spirit left to break 
I'll slash my wrists ain't no mistake 
Help me 
Oh help me 
Help me 
Oh help me 
Suicide suicide it's happening again 
Suicide suicide I'm losing my brain 
Suicide suicide what can I do 
I'm gonna kill myself because of you 
I've lost track of logical thinking 
I'm sitting in a room not even blinking 
Into the darkness I am sinking 
About to hear the angels singing 
Help me 
Oh help me 
Help me 
Oh help me 
Suicide suicide it's happening again 
Suicide suicide I'm losing my brain 
Suicide suicide what can I do 
I'm gonna kill myself because of you 
My mind's going round faster and faster 
The scripts been read and there's no disaster 
I was in with a chance but I'm a bastard 
I'm lying awake in a hospital plaster 
Help me 
Oh help me 
Help me 
Oh help me 
Suicide suicide it's happening again 
Suicide suicide I'm losing my brain 
Suicide suicide what can I do 
I'm gonna kill myself because of you
