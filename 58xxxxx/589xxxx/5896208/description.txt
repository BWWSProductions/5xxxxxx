Billboard-
Make it funky! For down-home blues fans it doesn't get much better than this. Vocalist/harp player Frost... comes on with the raw basics, accompanied by two different groups featuring his superb guitarist Big Jack Johnson. Well-balanced mix of covers and originals is rough and real, and will kick the butt of any died-in-the-wool blues nut. 

Jazztimes-
Frank Frost is a country bluesman to the bone. the Sun Records veteran is in typically relaxed and inspired form on this session, where he's frequently supported by Jonnson and drummer Sam Carr's infectious backbeat. Slim Harpo's ghost looms large here, but if Frost proves one thing on this record, it's that he's clearly his own man. Listen to his outragous cover of Mustang Sally if you doubt it.

Bill Dahl-
Frost is front and center with a program that's decidedly downhome. This is what modern Mississippi blues sounds like  tough, uncompromising, still rooted mainly in the 1950s with a few modern touches.
