,_luciferi,2010-10-22T02:04Z,"confirmed working on NTSC 4.2 soft modded Wii with USB Loader GX with AutoPatch, IOS-249, and error 002 fix.

(had to use wii backup manager to convert the .wbfs to .iso)"
[V],r3dcat,2010-10-22T06:50Z,@_luciferi: if your using a USB Loader then I assume you are using a wbfs formatted partition? if that is the case you don't need to convert the .wbfs file to an .iso to add it to your partition ... just use Wii Backup Manager to add the .wbfs file directly as you would normally add an .iso ;)
,_luciferi,2010-10-22T19:33Z,"Yeah. I forgot to say I was using it with WBFS Manager 2.5, cuz i have win7 64bit. That's the program I use for transferring and I know Wii backup manager does it as well just fine, but hey, its what I like using. I also didn't feel like double posting a correction either. But thanks for the upload and the help."

[V],HobbitGamez,2011-02-18T01:04Z,"If you are using USB Loader GX, make sure you have the setting ""Force NTSC"" on if your hardware is NTSC, otherwise you might see this game in black & white. An alternative is to just download the NTSC version."
,technothriller2992,2011-04-01T09:52Z,is 'A Shadow's Tale' the same as 'Lost in Shadow'?
,byaccident,2011-06-01T01:04Z,"Working on NTSC 4.3 with IOS249 (base 57), with the settings from _luciferi above (autopatch, error 002 fix) - or at least, it works until L9.  The screen goes white while loading.

Tried redownloading it and playing with settings, but I've got nothing.  Anyone have a link to an NTSC version?"
,byaccident,2011-06-03T04:54Z,"@technothriller2992:
Yes, and by your lead, I answered my own question.  It was known as ""A Shadow's Tale"" in Europe and Australia, and ""Lost in Shadow"" in North America."
