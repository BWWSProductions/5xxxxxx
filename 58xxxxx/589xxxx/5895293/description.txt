Aired 18.10.2010

"Unplanned Parenthood"

After a newborn experiences inexplicable 
breathing problems and liver failure, 
House and the team look at the baby's 
mother, Abbey's (guest star Jennifer 
Grey), own medical history for possible 
clues. When the team makes a discovery 
about her newborn's health, Abbey is 
presented with a difficult decision that 
could potentially affect both her baby's 
health and her own. Meanwhile, following 
Cuddy's directive, House challenges 
Foreman and Taub to hire a female 
doctor to join the team. When Cuddy asks 
House to babysit her daughter, both 
House and Wilson learn a few hard 
lessons in parenting.

Enjoy :)
