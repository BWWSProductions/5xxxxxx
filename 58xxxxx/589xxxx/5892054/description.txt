Two decades ago, Louis (Samuel L. Jackson) and Floyd (Bernie Mac) went their separate ways when their band broke up. But when their group's former front man dies, the two feuding singers agree to put aside their differences for a tribute concert at the Apollo Theater. The show promises to be a big hit -- if Louis and Floyd don't kill each other first.
