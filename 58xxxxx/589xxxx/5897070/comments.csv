I don't particularly care for children performers, but I do have to say that it is a fierce song, and Willow does a good job!"

[T],ThingsfromHeaven101,2010-10-23T23:17Z,You mean the song is? Hopefully not the quality. 
,KevanGC,2010-11-21T10:52Z,WTF Willow is only a 10-year-old!
,KevanGC,2010-11-21T10:57Z,"And the quality is great, but the song kinda sucks."
