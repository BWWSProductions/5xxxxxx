,hallo169,2010-12-20T20:26Z,"Just a question,
how/with what do you burn it??
I heard that you NEED a special program
please help me"
,DanDog24,2010-12-22T05:28Z,You can probably save the iso to a 8gb+ flashdrive and put the files on the 360 harddrive 8gb flashdrives cost 12-20 USD at kmart
,Jamz2010,2010-12-23T10:37Z,"You just need wxRipper.   At least, that's what I use.   Of course, this method requires you to take apart your computer's DVD drive and some people don't want to do that.   I didn't have a problem because my warranty was up anyways.

Other methods are by using a Kreon drive or by flashing an Xbox 360 drive with iXtreme firmware and putting it into a mode where it can be read by your computer."
,apwhitelaw,2011-01-03T01:04Z,"Great download! Went fast for me. I haven't burned it yet to try it out, but just a warning that the SplitVid is invalid. Abgx360 fixes that with no problem! You should be running it through Agbx360 anyways just to make sure!"
,Jamz2010,2011-01-09T03:05Z,"Yeah, I had pre-patched this with ABGX 1.0.2, so they might have changed the SplitVid settings."
