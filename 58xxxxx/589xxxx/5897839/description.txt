The Cleveland Show is an American animated television series that premiered on September 27, 2009, as a part of 

the "Animation Domination" lineup on Fox in the United States.[3] The series was created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike 

Henry, and Richard Appel as a spin-off from Family Guy, which was also created by MacFarlane.


In the beginning of the series, Cleveland Brown and his son, Cleveland Brown, Jr., move from the fictional town of 

Quahog, Rhode Island to the fictional town of Stoolbend, Virginia.

    Cleveland has kind of had enough in Quahog â€“ he kind of realizes that he wants his own friends, his own sidekicks, 

his own stories. So he sets out to California to make it in a way that we'll have to keep a secret until the show starts, 

and then he ends up somewhere else, which we'll also keep a secret until the show starts. But he basically goes home â€“ 

he goes to his hometown in Virginia and rekindles an old high school flame.


Due to the cancellation of Mike Judge's King of the Hill,[11] the move of the American adaptation of Sit Down, Shut Up 

to Saturday nights, followed by its later cancellation,[12] and the renewal of American Dad!, The Simpsons is now the 

only cartoon on Fox's "Animation Domination" line-up that was not created by Seth MacFarlane.
