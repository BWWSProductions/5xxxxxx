FOR INFO : these are the morons who attempted to shut down the Pirate Bay in Portugal.

Portugese news media - behold, private emails from Acapor"
,PlantaBR,2010-10-18T04:28Z,"The pirate ship will never sink.
Good luck Portuguese friends! Helping to seed and spread the word."
,Bull068,2010-10-18T06:23Z,"Delicious propaganda is delicious.

Could have used a little less communist implication, but overall, I enjoyed it."

,Chronom,2010-10-20T16:35Z,"@IanMoone: That is not the full server backup. What you have there is a corrupted server backup, I believe. The actual server backup is 1.8gb in size, in .tar format. "
,jamesensor,2010-10-22T13:39Z,"lol this is fun

But how do i read the emails? they have no sort of extension to open with program. With wordpad shows only code.

,fuckacapor,2010-12-24T00:32Z,"OfereÃ§o 100â‚¬ pagos em mÃ£o na zona de Odivelas para dar um soco e partir o nariz ao Nuno Pereira, o maricas do presidente do ACAPOR. Partir os vidros do carro 50â‚¬. E eu nem ponho pirataria no Piratebay dado que apenas uso linux e sÃ³ ponho aqui opensource. O filho da puta nÃ£o tem direito a guardar dados pessoais sem autorizaÃ§Ã£o! Acha que Ã© polÃ­cia ou que? Para a cadeia com esse paneleiro! Quando o ver vai levar uma traulitada. Olha para trÃ¡s sua puta... SÃ£o uns poucos para te apanhar... Sei que vais ver isto cabrÃ£o. :D"
,jazzmelody9,2010-12-24T00:36Z,realmente não têm o direito de censurar a net. Mas não é preciso (muita )violência...

,baby-jo,2011-01-03T15:28Z,"These motherfuckers do not have anything else to do!
 I hope that the staff ""Anonymous"" fuck them the site. .acapor.pt / site, sorry my bad english."
,rafa2402,2011-01-03T21:26Z,"Hi, 

I'm from Portugal and now ACAPOR will release a list of 1000 ip's every month with people that had download some fake movies that ACAPOR had posted on major torrent sites like The Pirate Bay. They had bought a software from China that can show the ip's of the torrent downloaders. I think they are a private company and spy people without autorization of the government is a crime too. Can THE PIRATE BAY do something about this?

BTW, In Acapor there is a lot of motherf*ckers.

PIRATE BAY will rule in Portugal forever. Thank you.


PS - Sorry for m bad english..."
,StarK1ll3r,2011-01-05T21:41Z,"bunch of losers, more talk than action, they wanna do stuff like fuck with other people and then pow... welcome to the dragon lair, how can those tiny fucks mess with something so big like pirate bay when a lots of big international companies don't because they know that that road is going to end...lol
