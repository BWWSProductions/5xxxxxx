      VLC  and a few other players are the most versatile and, generally speaking,
      good - but quality is 10-20% lower.

What is the best player for perfect quality playback? For an average computer and for a decent gaming computer? Thank's ahead of time. 
Without a doubt your the best small sized encoder out there."
