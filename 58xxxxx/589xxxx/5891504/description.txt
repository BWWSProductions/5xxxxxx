            Duncan is a straight A student, Blade             
            is a juvenile delinquent. But because                 
          of a mix up with their school records,              
            everyone thinks each is the other one.                
             Duncan kind of likes the attention from                
               being thought of as a real bad dude, if                  
              only the school bully would stop trying                 
             to rough him up. And Blade definitely                  
                likes being thought of as important                       
                  instead of as trouble, if only the teacher                  
                  would stop hitting on him for a date.

            Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to pres-             
           erving the neglected titles of an entertainment              
            era long gone. A time of classic kids flicks,                 
          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless              
             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had                 
              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special               
              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their                 
              many tools.                                                     
                                                                              
                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better                    
              days, we seek to relive those times, and share                  
              those memories. While our belief is that the                    
              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,                 
              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or                   
              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies                 
              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by                
              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece                  
              just because it is dated.                                       
                                                                              
                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital                    
              sources, there are still thousands of rare and                  
              out of print titles, many of which have no                      
              planned digital release. We've made it our                      
              mission to dig these out, clean them up using                   
              the best hardware and techniques available to                   
              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,                   
              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here                    
              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades                   
           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and                
           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never
