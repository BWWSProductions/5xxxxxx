ive noticed quite a few people sharing this problem and i some help would be greatly appreciated "
,BiERPuNK,2010-10-24T03:12Z,"For the people that have no clue how to unpack and install this, here is a little how-to:

First of all, you download the game (duh). Once it's finished, you get a bunch of files. Make sure you have got an unpacker, like 7-zip or winrar installed. Then right click on 'sr-fnv.rar' and unpack it.

Then there will be a new file, called 'sr-fnv.iso'. This is an image, or copy, of the original game dvd. Now you will need a mounting tool, i would suggest Daemon-Tools Lite. Make sure you use the lite version. With Daemon-Tools, you mount the iso file. This will create a new virtual dvd drive that loads the game image.

Then, an installer would start, or you can manually open the installer from My Computer and then the dvd drive. Install it like you would do with a normal game.

Once it's installed, go to the folder where you've installed the game (probably C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout New Vegas). The two files you will need to change are FalloutNV.exe and FalloutNVLauncher.exe. Make a backup of those files. I always add .bkp to the name, like FalloutNV.exe.bkp. Do whatever you like.

Then open the dvd drive location from My Computer, and go to the folder SKIDROW. Copy the two files you see there to the Fallout folder you just opened.

And that's it. Just click on the Fallout New Vegas shortcut on your desktop or Start menu, and start playing this wonderfull game!"

Also, when I started the game the launcher came up find but when I pressed play a window came up saying that ""XINPUT1_3.dll could not be found."" After some quick research I found out that it might be necessary for me to update my DirectX (which surprised me) on the MS webpage. After doing that all was well so if anyone has that problem just heed my advice.

3 - Turn off ALL Anti-Vírus, firewall or something like that.

4 - When installing, don't touch on PC, let the cpu handle only this

5 - If worked, Good! If no...

6 - Re-Download the torrent. Do not restart the computer, install when the download is okay, with all AV and firewall turned off, and install again.

Worked for me. If this work, make a backup of all the .bsa (Texture, Texture2, Voice, etc), so if you have do unistall, you not will have to do all that again. I hope you can play the game!"
