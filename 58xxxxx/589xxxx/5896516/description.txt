Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties.

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible.

On with the game release information:

Welcome to Vegas. New Vegas.

It's the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to
being shot in the head and left for deadand that's before
things really get ugly. It's a town of dreamers and desperados
being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete
control of this desert oasis. It's a place where the right
kind of person with the right kind of weaponry can really make
a name for themselves, and make more than an enemy or two
along the way.

As you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave
Wasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched
Vegas Strip, you'll be introduced to a colorful cast of
characters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated
creatures and much more. Choose sides in the upcoming war or
declare "winner takes all" and crown yourself the King of New
Vegas in this follow-up to the 2008 videogame of the year,
Fallout 3.

Enjoy your stay.

Feel the Heat in New Vegas Not even nuclear fallout could
slow the hustle of Sin City. Explore the vast expanses of the
desert wastelands - from the small towns dotting the Mojave
Wasteland to the bright lights of the New Vegas strip. See
the Great Southwest as could only be imagined in Fallout.

Feuding Factions, Colorful Characters and a Host of Hostiles
A war is brewing between rival factions with consequences
that will change the lives of all the inhabitants of New
Vegas. The choices you make will bring you into contact with
countless characters, creatures, allies, and foes, and
determine the final explosive outcome of this epic power
struggle.

New Systems Enjoy new additions to Fallout: New Vegas such as
a Companion Wheel that streamlines directing your companions,
a Reputation System that tracks the consequences of your
actions, and the aptly titled Hardcore Mode to separate the
meek from the mighty. Special melee combat moves have been
added to bring new meaning to the phrase "up close and
personal". Use V.A.T.S. to pause time in combat, target
specific enemy body parts and queue up attacks, or get right
to the action using the finely-tuned real-time combat
mechanics.

An Arsenal of Shiny New Guns With double the amount of
weapons found in Fallout 3, you'll have more than enough new
and exciting ways to deal with the threats of the wasteland
and the locals. In addition, Vault-Tec engineers have devised
a new weapons configuration system that lets you tinker with
your toys and see the modifications you make in real time.

Let it Ride In a huge, open world with unlimited options you
can see the sights, choose sides, or go it alone. Peacemaker
or Hard Case, House Rules, or the Wild Card - it's all in how
you play the game.
