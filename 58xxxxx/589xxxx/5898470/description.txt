IMPROVMENTS

Gameplay:
Improved player\'s off the ball characteristics (attack, defence, teamwork), balanced quality of the teams - reduced the big difference in quality between \'big\' and \'small\' teams, also balanced physicall stats of \'star\' and \'normal\' players (body balance, stamina, speed, response, mentality) and as a result of that eliminated so called \"robot effect\" (situation where phisically much stronger players literally go through weaker players); goalkeepers stats aro also much improved so now their reactions resemble more to reality, also \"BALANCE\" improved for all goalies so now they don\'t rebound stronger shots - as a result of that rebound goals that irritate every serious PES player are almost eliminated.

Improved Master league and other Cup/League competitions:
This is mostly as a result of balanced teams qualities so now every COM opponent is harder to beat, and scores of other COM teams in the league are now various so you can\'t have a situation as we had before when for example after 10 rounds Man. Utd and Chelsea have 9 or 10 league wins, this contributes to a very interesting competition that is closer to reality where big and expensive teams can often loose or play draw against weaker opponents.

AI:
Improved AI, especially player movements in defense because of improved teamwork stats players (especially side backs) come back more often and fill the empty gaps on the sides or cover opponents - as a result of this it is very difficult to score asy goals from 5 yard box or one of those goals when you give a return ball to your player standing 20 m from the goal and then he fires almost a certain goal, these are well known PES 6 goals and believe me with this patch they are very hard to score because of improved goalkeepers and reduced weaker foot accuracy. This is the reason why many people noticed that the game is changed after they played this patch for the first time, especially if you use Shollym gameplay option file which is even more harder and closer to real football experience.

Visual improvements:
New stadiums with improved graphics and HD turf, real referees, real trophies, TV scoreboards, new looks for menus and team emblems, high quality kits, faces..

Atmosphere during matches:
Many consider this to be the best element of Shollym Patch, all teams have their original chants and stadiums so in the beginning of every match there is a feeling as if you were on the stadium! Also ball sounds and referee whistle are changed so everything is closer to reality.

Other improvements:
Constant adding of new players and transfers, actualized player stats, new music background in the game...
