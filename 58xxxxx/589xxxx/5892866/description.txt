Xubuntu 10.10, code-named 'Maverick Meerkat', is the latest and greatest version of Xubuntu. Some of the highlights include: Xubuntu now uses Parole, the Xfce Media Player, to provide an improved audio/video experience; Xfburn has replaced Brasero for a more resource-conscious CD/DVD burning tool; Xfce task manager has replaced GNOME task manager, providing similar function with fewer resources required; Gnumeric has been updated to version 1.10.8, and AbiWord is now version 2.8.6; a brand-new theme from the Shimmer team has been introduced.
