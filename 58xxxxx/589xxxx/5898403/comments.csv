,FireIsHot,2011-02-03T09:21Z,"Please Seed, I'm barely pulling 40kb/s if I'm real lucky. It's been download since 1/20/11 and the file it's self has seen almost 2 days of download and I'm only at 22.5%.

Ep. 10 Finished and I can't wait for the rest. I will Seed for a long time if someone can help the few of us out as I'm sure everyone else is having similar issues"
,FireIsHot,2011-03-07T09:33Z,"Finished on the 27th of February , I've uploaded nearly 7gb and will continue to seed as long as much as I can (At least till it's seeded 1/1).

Thanks so much for the amazing download, I hope you'll get the other episodes when they come out."
