,PuttsMoBiles,2010-10-21T07:22Z,"I downloaded this and ran it.

My computer wont even get to the starting windows area.

It just hangs with a blank screen.

Can anyone help me?"
,PuttsMoBiles,2010-10-21T07:25Z,why was my comment removed?
,Evox91,2010-10-26T23:59Z,"yo, i got the same problem as PuttsMoBiles, restarted after apllying and now my computer goes through BIOS and everything then gets hung at a black screen with a blinking underscore, re-installing windows fixes this, but then leaves me unactivated. in the past, i have used the Loader/Key/Cert option, and now am attempting to just use the Key/Cert Function, i will report my result, or make a referral to a activator to use in substitute of this one for those whom have a similar problem."
,Evox91,2010-10-27T08:51Z,"after testing the difference made by the ""Loader/Key/Cert"" and the ""Key/Cert"" options, ive discovered that on my Asus Eee PC 1015 PEM, only the ""Key/Cert"" option will work, the loader will make win7 inoperable. I noticed that when i tried the loader on my custom built desktop pc, it wouldnt work while i had Win7 64bit, but would while using 32bit, perhaps the loader simply does not work on x64? not sure, but other than that little mishap, which ive had happen with most other activators, this is the best one ive come across and highly recommend it to EVERYBODY"
,principlemajor,2010-10-28T22:55Z,"Just like PuttsMobiles and Evox91 are saying. it didn't work either for me and it's true, after a reboot, it locked up your desktop. A system restore fixed mine but still it couldn't activate the windows."
[T],pkaji123,2010-10-29T08:01Z,Guys you must run this program as Administrator.
,CPWspeed,2010-10-30T07:49Z,"I just used this and ran it as admin on 64bit windows 7 ultimate and when  i restarted, it gave me the good old ""A disk read error occurred."" error. Had to reinstall. Seems like this is a bad activator...."
,pinneypm,2010-10-31T23:40Z,tried it and it locked up my computer with a blank screen too. this activator sux! i just got everything dialed in just for it to crash? gotta be an activator out there that actually works
[T],pkaji123,2010-11-22T07:33Z,"A new version of this has been uploaded,check that."
,RIBJ,2011-01-25T15:42Z,is it the latest release? many many thanks
,trusktr,2012-01-12T23:10Z,"I tried this, the the ""Windows is not genuine"" message still appears when I log into the desktop. Orbit, for release 3, you should have it fix this issue. You can email me at: jp 'at' keepskatinbro 'dot' com."
