jus curious, y are all ur rips in mp4, while others like riddler, yify are in mkv.... any advantage?

i used megui for compressing one of my files,  both d mkv n mp4 compressions were similar "
[V],prashant22,2010-10-17T11:27Z,"@shreevathsan
compression r similar..bt both have their own advantages...i use mp4 because dvd players, ps3's can detect mp4 format bt they cannot detect mkv..."
