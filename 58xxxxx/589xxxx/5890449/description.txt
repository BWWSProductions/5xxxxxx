This is the entire soundtrack for Civilization V, ripped from the game, converted from .ogg to .mp3, organized, and retitled. It's basically been made iPod/iTunes/WMP compatible, and gone through my OCD filter (because I can't stand to have my music files unorganized). 

I had initially looked for a Civilization V soundtrack, but was surprised that there wasn't one available. I really wanted it, and I figured you guys would too, so I whipped this up in a couple of hours. At any rate, here you go!

Notes:
The titles initially had either no spaces, or underscores where the spaces should have been. This is now fixed. Songs titled "*title* A" and "*title* B" have been replaced with "*title* I" and "*title* II". Songs with alphanumeric numbers have had the numbers replaced with roman numerals as well, with the exception of "Pt. X" "No. Y" and "Op. Z" I've also added punctuation, and given track numbers. The music is arranged how I found it in the game folder: By civilization area (Americas, Europe, Asia, and Middle East/Africa) and then mood (At War, At Peace, Either). Each one got its own album, and they all share "Civilization V" as the artist.

REMEMBER TO SEED!
