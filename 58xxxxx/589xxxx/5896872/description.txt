* FILE INFO : Fantastic work on this pratical : FULL GAME less the multiplayer that needs a valid key and about 10 videos with no sound but with perfect subtitles sinchronization (the videos type of this game not so common and have really big size for a pratical file , so it was possible the work but without keeping the audio but all the action of the videos still perfectly understandable and they pass a kind of quick anyway , thank you for understand) , MULTI-3 (eng , pol and rus)

TORRENT REPORT :  for the users that might think that maybe it is some problem with the file because the really well worked size for this game beside that is a kind of common in my files , i get the report already from a few users saying that already finished the game with this file .

* GAMEPLAY : *

* As a first-person shooter, Medal of Honor features modern military combat, primarily from the perspective of infantry soldiers. The player will be armed with various authentic modern military small arms and placed in combat designed to simulate modern warfare.
 The gameplay is designed to be realistic, and to this end EA has hired several consultants from the United States military. Typical in-game objectives are expected to be similar to those issued in real life such as raiding terrorist hideouts, hostage rescues and undercover operations. The single player is set to include drivable vehicles such as helicopters, jeeps, bikes, and ATV\'s.
 The gameplay uses recharging health, rather than fixed health points. If the player is wounded, the screen turns red, and the player must avoid taking damage for several seconds to return to full health.
 The game features iron sights as well as red dot sights and other aiming accessories. The player will shoot much more accurately while using the weapon\'s sights than when firing from the hip. *
