,i_got_you69,2010-10-21T20:03Z,globeplus thanks for the torrent but i have a question.why not keep the video sounds and delete the extra languages except english ?
,u2r1,2010-10-22T00:35Z,dose it work for windows 7?
,Shoobox,2010-10-22T20:37Z,"unpacked, converted ran good on windows 7,
then when you get to the part with the open field and tanks, laser lockon  doesnt work, so you get stuck on that level,with the game restarting after you die,form not being able to use laser lock.
really bad game glitch, dissapointed,really looked foward to playing."
