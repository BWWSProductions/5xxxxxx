Ian is a rebellious teenager who had recently been suspended from his school. One day, he wakes up in a mysterious preparatory high school, with no idea how he got there or where it is located. The school itself is focused on finding the ""unique potential"" of its students. Along the way, he makes friends with CJ, Gabe, and Suki; together, they investigate the mysteries of the school while trying to escape. On the first episode they try to escape but then creatures make them go back to the school. They then later play a prank on the school bullies, by stealing their clothes while they are in the shower and putting them in the front lawn; causing them to go out and get in trouble for being naked."
