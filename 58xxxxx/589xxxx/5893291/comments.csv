The quality is great and I was hesitent to download this torrent and waste my time on bad quality... But I am glad I risked it. It is great. Amazing work done by, FaMoUz! A:10/10 V:10/10 well worth the time and bandwidth! Great work and thank you very much...

Sometimes the deleted scenes for an episode are nearly as long as the episode, and just as funny."
