,Barryosterburg,2010-10-18T12:28Z,Hello frends of the internet computer. i like this movie show with my botehrs. it is being very rude with even the lady saying the fuck prafane and thesometimes even showing the brest.1 time she even saw it vagina. in the village elders be angry and big trouble if the show is known about watching. but i like it and do not care even. 1 question if alcyhol drinks not allowed in USA why it drinking all time even today
,Barryosterburg_sucks,2010-10-18T13:15Z,"@Barryosterburg: You and your village elders should watch Spartacus- Blood and Sand. It has plenty of what you enjoy seeing the most- penis. I'm sure that you'd thoroughly enjoy the show and after viewing it, you could wrestle around together nude in buttermilk, which is one of your favorite pastimes. "
,Nubi,2010-10-18T17:10Z,@Barryosterburg_sucks I love the way you roundhouse whoop mr. Barryosterburg by making an account just to take a dump in his face. Good job

,SaMure,2010-12-06T19:14Z,"@Barryosterburg ive seen your posts and im incredibly curious as to what country you reside in? As for the alcohol, it was prohibited but everybody drank it anyway, kinda like how cannabis is prohibited today but everybody smokes it anyway.

I think the most interesting part about this series is that it shows how much brutal crime is created by outlawing substances and how much money criminal networks gain because of prohibition laws.

And BTW fuck you ""Barryosterburg_sucks"" why are you acting up like a little kid?"
