├óΓé¼┼ôHow do I do instant inductions?├óΓé¼┬¥

Of all the questions that come pouring in to me here at Street Hypnosis ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£ that one is the most popular.

If you├óΓé¼Γäóve ever wondered how stage hypnotists put people ├óΓé¼┼ôout├óΓé¼┬¥ with a single word and a quick  handshake, your curiosity is about to be satisfied.

You see, a short while ago I spent two days in a video studio recording a new training program called├óΓé¼┬ª ├óΓé¼┼ôThe Instant Induction Crash Course├óΓé¼┬¥

I wanted to create a video training that takes the mystery out of instant inductions and shows ANYBODY how to do them with just a little practice.

What you├óΓé¼Γäóll really appreciate as you watch is how these videos take you step-by-step through the entire process of doing instant inductions.

It├óΓé¼Γäós all laid out for you ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£ I held nothing back during this video shoot.

Everything I├óΓé¼Γäóve learned learned about instant inductions (Including secrets I had travel half way around the world and DRAG out of  various mentors over the years) was captured on video.

I suspect a lot of hypnotists will be a little upset I├óΓé¼Γäóm sharing ├óΓé¼┼ôtrade secrets├óΓé¼┬¥ ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£ but that├óΓé¼Γäós too bad for them.

It was so frustrating for me trying to put together all the pieces of this puzzle, there├óΓé¼Γäós no reason for you to struggle like I did to learn this fun and valuable skill.

The training program is  around 80 minutes of detailed, comprehensive, hard-to-find but easy to follow instruction on how to do your own instant inductions any time, any place, with anyone.

By the time you├óΓé¼Γäóre finished watching, you├óΓé¼Γäóll know more about instant inductions than most Las Vegas stage hypnotists!

More importantly, you├óΓé¼Γäóll know everything you need start DOING instant inductions
I cover every aspect of instant inductions from A to Z so you├óΓé¼Γäóll feel totally confident in doing your own as soon as you├óΓé¼Γäóve gone through the training.

When you can do instant inductions, it├óΓé¼Γäós pretty easy to become the life of the party and find yourself viewed by others as possessing some ├óΓé¼┼ômagic ability├óΓé¼┬¥.

(Even though instant inductions are not hard, they tend to blow people├óΓé¼Γäós minds!)

And besides entertainment, many interesting possibilities open up for you when you have this skill├óΓé¼┬ªincluding doing group demos to build your hypnosis practice or  helping people one-on-one overcoming obstacles in their lives.

You see, I go far beyond party tricks in this training├óΓé¼┬ª
You├óΓé¼Γäóre going to learn the fundamental principles that make ALL successful hypnosis work.

So don├óΓé¼Γäót blame me if you suddenly find yourself more confident and comfortable in ANY situation after watching these videos.

I├óΓé¼Γäóve paid hundreds of dollars for courses that don├óΓé¼Γäót contain half as much detailed, step by step information as you├óΓé¼Γäóll find in these videos.
