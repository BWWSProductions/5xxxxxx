,bigbadbob73,2010-11-11T15:43Z,"just to flush this chump out !!, I downloaded the torrent today again from a differnt pc to see what would happen, and guess what, the download appeared fine running at over 300kbs, until wait for !! WHAMO .. stalled at 33.8% again. I knew this bastard smelt of rotten fish, Jlash, your nothing but an industry hack, using up downloader bandwith, ur a FAKER SOB,. 

If is smells fishy, and looks like fish, then it usually is fish of the rotten variety. Industry Hacks, paid by the studios to try and fuk downloaders up, but tell you shower of bastards what, we will always be one step ahead of you sons of bitches

Comrades - BEWARE- FAKER AT WORK - I AM REPORT THIS SPASSO TO THE MODERATORS

Anything to say for yourself - Jlas2h ????"

,bigbadbob73,2010-11-15T01:58Z,"thats a pile of shit excuse dude, if u had stopped uploading and feeding the torrent then, why did boyzone2k1 and myself on 3 different occassions all get to 33% very quick & easliy and then drop drop off to nothing all at the same percentage, at different times. If you had stopped uploading then how the fuck did we we up to that percentage so quick with no peers or seeders, and coincidently see the torrent fall to fuck all at the same % of download. For an uploader you seem very niave, u should know to use a VPN (virtual private network) and peer blocking program to hide your activites from the ISP companies. Ur cover story dont wash with me dog, and you sound like a studio hack still. 

Go tell your teacher that your dog ate your homework, and she might just believe that bullshit as well ! youve been rumbled dude."

Um, you realize there are about 700 people downloading this torrent? Almost all of them are at the same percentage and your downloading from them."

yes my friend, i understand totally about seeders and peers, and the swarm, but when i found that the download was comprimised, i deleted the torrent and data, and would not seed a third of a movie, then why would anybody else.          The torrent  download rate was constant the two times i uploaded at 300kbs, with approx the same timeframe for both downloads, - just a coincidence on two different downloads at different times???? no variance on seeds and peers??? if the uploader was being true, he could have left a tag stating he could not complete the upload, and for people to quit uploading the torrent until he could come fully back online with the remainder of the files at a later date, when he has the gumption to hide his activities from the ISP company. downloadrs are wasting their bandwidth on a deab torrent. not all downloader have free unlimited  quotas, a lot of downloaders have monthly limits, and this torrent is just wasting thoss limits. It is up to us to tell other pirates the truth, and to let them then make thier own minds up. I aint going to lick the ass of any uploader to stroke their egos, when they are not being true to the downloaders. I appreciate al the hard work and risks uploaders take for this site, but on the other hand they have a responibility to be truthfull in to the downloaders. There is so many studio hacks trying to fuk this site up, we all have to vigilant and confront the fakers and virus spreaders, whom are trying to harm the users of this site. I speak my mind . Yes my friend, I understand, maybe better than most!!!

peace out dogs, and be vigilant.

ps : if Jlas2h is genuine and sincere, then follow my advise and hide your activities as mentioned, and upload the remainder of the files to complete the other 2/3 of the series, and that will prove your bonafides as a pirate."

,Scary B,2010-12-08T20:22Z,"I am sure I wasn't the only one stuck at 57% with this torrent.

I decided to post the full set in MKV, my own rips, at around the same size 4.5GB, if anyone is interested:
