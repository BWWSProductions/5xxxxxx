Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first film in the Harry Potter series based on the novels by J.K. Rowling. 

It is the tale of Harry Potter, an ordinary 11-year-old boy serving as a sort of slave for his aunt and uncle who learns 

that he is actually a wizard and has been invited to attend the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is 

snatched away from his mundane existence by Hagrid, the grounds keeper for Hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a 

world completely foreign to both him and the viewer. Famous for an incident that happened at his birth, Harry makes 

friends easily at his new school. He soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more dangerous for him than 

he would have imagined, and he quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

Forced to spend his summer holidays with his muggle relations, Harry Potter gets a real shock when he gets a 

surprise visitor: Dobby the house-elf, who warns Harry Potter against returning to Hogwarts, for terrible things are 

going to happen. Harry decides to ignore Dobby's warning and continues with his pre-arranged schedule. But at 

Hogwarts, strange and terrible things are indeed happening: Harry is suddenly hearing mysterious voices from inside 

the walls, muggle-born students are being attacked, and a message scrawled on the wall in blood puts everyone on 

his/her guard - "The Chamber Of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies Of The Heir, Beware" .

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Harry Potter is having a tough time with his relatives (yet again). He runs away after using magic to inflate Uncle 

Vernon's sister Marge who was being offensive towards Harry's parents. Initially scared for using magic outside the 

school, he is pleasantly surprised that he won't be penalized after all. However, he soon learns that a dangerous 

criminal and Voldemort's trusted aide Sirius Black has escaped from the Azkaban prison and wants to kill Harry to 

avenge the Dark Lord. To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile shape-shifters called Dementors are appointed to 

guard the school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him. Little does Harry know that 

by the end of this year, many holes in his past (whatever he knows of it) will be filled up and he will have a clearer 

vision of what the future has in store.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts is about to start and he is enjoying the summer vacation with his friends. They get 

the tickets to The Quidditch World Cup Final but after the match is over, people dressed like Lord Voldemort's 'Death 

Eaters' set a fire to all the visitors' tents, coupled with the appearance of Voldemort's symbol, the 'Dark Mark' in the 

sky, which causes a frenzy across the magical community. That same year, Hogwarts is hosting 'The Triwizard 

Tournament', a magical tournament between three well-known schools of magic : Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and 

Durmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of 17, and are chosen by a magical object called Goblet of Fire. 

On the night of selection, however, the Goblet spews out four names instead of the usual three, with Harry 

unwittingly being selected as the Fourth Champion. Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go with it 

and brave three exceedingly difficult tasks.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

After a lonely summer on Privet Drive, Harry returns to a Hogwarts full of ill-fortune. Few of students and parents 

believe him or Dumbledore that Voldemort is really back. The ministry had decided to step in by appointing a new 

Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher that proves to be the nastiest person Harry has ever encountered. Harry also 

can't help stealing glances with the beautiful Cho Chang. To top it off are dreams that Harry can't explain, and a 

mystery behind something Voldemort is searching for. With these many things Harry begins one of his toughest 

years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
