
Irish, Scottish (and Dutch) folkmusic with a difference. Dieb, William and MaceÃ¡l sing and play on instruments like fiddle, tin whistle, gitouki, squeezebox, mouth organ, bodhrÃ¡n and tea-chest bass. This diversity of instruments, a varied repertoire and an original presentation make a concert of Rapalje a special act. Dressed in medieval kilts, Rapalje performs in every conceivable venue.
