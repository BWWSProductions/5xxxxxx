If I open in VLC it says it is broken; if I ignore the repair option it plays eight seconds of something (nothing), if I choose repair, it does nothing (but indicates trying to repair). (oh, after leaving it for a long time it actually started indexing, slooowly)
Using wmpclassic, I see the file is eight seconds long, and consists of only that crappy something."
