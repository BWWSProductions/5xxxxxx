,veerenski,2010-10-20T00:25Z,It all reduces to neuro-linguistic programming.
,veerenski,2010-10-20T12:36Z,"Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) uses techniques of hypnosis among other things and is considered to be one of the most effective methods of ""psychotherapy"".

In its essence, it is mind control and reprogramming the mind according to the world view and instructions of the ""therapist"".

The main principle of these ""therapies"" is bypassing your conscious mind so the information and instructions go directly to your subconscious mind, and, from then on, would cause the behavior according to that program without the host even realizing why did he behave in a certain way.

It is well know to ""psychotherapists"" that your subconscious is much more influential on your life than your conscious, and behavior, based on subconscious motivation overrules your conscious mind easily. You simply can not resist but do those things you were programmed with.

Whatever you are programmed with via NLP and hypnosis appears to you as ""truth"" of some kind, undeniable and unquestionable. You are simply compelled to do those things. You can not even resist as mind isn't even functioning. What functions instead is purely mechanical program, just like in a computer.

So, what you become is a bio-robot, a zombie."
,veerenski,2010-10-20T13:01Z,"Interestingly enough, Chandra Mohan never spoke about NLP despite the fact that he would never miss any work of any significance, especially in the fields of psychology. That is simply inconceivable. It is simply impossible from what I know of this man.

And what we have now, is some people even offering you ""meditations"" that use the NLP and promise you virtually miracles, even psychoanalysis was not able to deliver.

http://www.abbyeagle.com/zen/semZenCourse.php

""A course that combines NLP with Osho Zen Meditation""

The thing is that meditation has NOTHING to do with ANY kind of programming. It is pretty much self-contradictory. You can find plenty more references on this nonsense.

Interestingly enough, probably the most significant issues the world has to deal with are the issues of ""The Plan"", which is NWO and raging ZioNazism, the ""end goal"" of which, according to Nicholas Rockefeller, is the ""chip society"" and LITERAL zombification of mankind.

What are you already seeing everywhere you look is the final phases of this process, as the entire world, gun, stock, and barrel, is ""owned"" by the ""elite"", the undisputable king of which is Rothchilds."
,veerenski,2010-10-20T13:08Z,"One of the key aspects of mind programming is to keep you confused with all the endless contradictions. So your mind can not possibly reconcile it all. The net effect is all the instructions you rear from your ""master"" go directly into your subconscious, bypassing your true guard, the mind and its analytic and critical abilities.

As for the record, what we have is clear indications that Chandra Mohan is a part of this NWO equation. Interestingly enough, he never spoke about the NWO to any extent even worth mentioning.

All these ""spiritual"" movements and ""systems"" are a part of that very equation. They are meant to keep society confused, forever seeking for some sweet fruit, which they will never find.

Interestingly enough, among all the people I know, connected to Chandra Mohan, I have not seen a SINGLE ONE, who would be satisfied with what he has found.

I do know a few people that were content. But it is because they are too strong and stand firmly on their own feet.

All others, even the most ""powerful"" ""therapists"" and ""group leaders"", and I know them all, at least ""the real deal"" ones, never found anything that I could see with my own eyes."

""We need a program of psychosurgery and political control of our society. The purpose is physical control of the mind. Everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically
mutilated.

The individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence, but this is only his personal point of view. This lacks historical perspective.

Man does not have the right to develop his own mind. This kind of liberal orientation has great appeal. We must electrically control the brain.

Some day armies and generals will be controlled
by electrical stimulation of the brain.""

,veerenski,2010-10-20T20:41Z,"Interestingly enough, Jose Delgado and his ""work"" was one of the subjects covered by Chandra Mohan as something significant.

Was he so idiotic as not to comprehend what Jose Delagdo is or what he represents?"
,veerenski,2010-10-20T21:35Z,"As we speak, and I just heard it on the news, the last bits of Russian wealth are being ""privatized"", which means?

Which means the ZioNazi are going to own whatever is left of Russia within months.

And Russia happens to be the wealth of this planet. There exists no single country in the world with such a vast amount of resources as Russia.

According to Harvard Project, the population of Russia is to be reduced to 50 millions.

Cool, eh?"
,veerenski,2010-10-20T21:36Z,"But where is Chandra Mohan in this?

Well, right smack in the middle of it:

""Don't worry. Be happy""."
,veerenski,2010-10-21T13:01Z,"According to Gen. Major Petrov, the academic, the Harvard Project, there exists ""the Dalles doctrine"", a plan to destroy Russia in phases and it has been largely complete. There already exist maps of different independent countries, the Russia is to be divided into and deals are being made as we speak as to who is going to ""own"" which country.

Interestingly enough that monstrous doctrine exists since the sixties, but, for some reason Chandra Mohan never even mention it.

How come? The monstrosity of THAT magnitude is not significant enough in the scheme of things?

And THAT is what is the reality of where you sit:

Quote:

A high-ranking Zionist, the future CIA Director A. Dulles, expressed it this way:

""... we'll throw everything we have, all gold, all the material support and resources at zombification of people ... 

Literature, theater, movies - everything will depict and glorify the lowest human emotions.

We will do our best to maintain and promote the so-called artists, who will plant and hammer a cult of sex, violence, sadism, betrayal into human consciousness ... in the control of government we will create chaos and confusion ... rudeness and arrogance, lies and deceit, drunkenness, drug addiction, animalistic fear ... and the enmity of peoples - all this we will enforce deftly and unobtrusively ...

We will start working on them since their childhood and adolescence years, and will always put our bets on the youth. We will begin to corrupt, pervert and defile it.
...

That's how we are going to do it."""

NSA Security directive 20/1.
The Harvard Project.

Harvard Project consists of three volumes:

1) Perestroika (reconstruction)
2) Reforms
3) The Final Phase

1) Perestroika

Time frame to be implemented: 1985-1990

During this time period there would be ""reconstruction"", ""openness"", creation of ideas of the ""socialism with a human face"", preparation of the reforms. There should be a single leader to direct the ""perestroika"" phase.

That leader turned out to be Gorbachev, a ZioNazi puppet, that was awarded a Nobel Prize for his contribution into destruction of Russia, who was called a traitor in the letter of 300 most prominent scientists and intelligentsia.

2) Reforms

Time frame to be implemented: 1990-1995

Goals:

* Liquidation of the world's socialist system,
* liquidation of the Warsaw Pact,
* liquidation of the Communist Party,
* liquidation of the USSR
* liquidation of the patriotic socialist ideology

The reforms were to be conducted by different leader.

3) The Final Phase

Time frame to be implemented: 1996-2000
Was to be conducted by the third leader.

[This phase is not progressing as expected]

Goals:

* liquidation of the soviet army
* liquidation of Russia as a state
* liquidation of the attributes of the socialism, such as free education, free medical care, and introduction of the attributes of the capitalism - you have to pay for everything.
* liquidation of well fed and peaceful life in Moscow and Leningrad
* liquidation of the social and government property and introduction of private property everywhere
* reduction of population via starvation, alcoholism, drug abuse and other means to 50 million people
* and so on"

The article headline: A New Harvard Project

(Brookings Institution will crack your scull if you know what it is)

Fiona Hill states that the democratization of Russia is not happening as desired and she invites the Russian intelligentsia to get in touch with her in order to develop a ""New Harvard Project"".

The phase we are in right now is destruction of Russia as a state.

It is to be divided into several different states or countries with their own leaders.

Now, the destruction of Russia, as far as I can see, is the final stage.

And if you think ""well, what does it have to do with me"", right?

Surprise, surprise for you ""spiritual seeker""."
,veerenski,2010-10-22T03:24Z,"Now, where do all the leads lead to?

Well, simple enough: ZioNazis

Oh, you don't know who they are, my humble ""meditator""?

How come?

You see, they are ruling your mind,
they are abusing it every place you look, including the TV propaganda and disinformation machine with their never ending ""shows"" of perversion, violence, deceit, satanic doctrine, wars, idiocy, and you name it.

They control the World Bank, IMF, the US government, the European Parliament, which is nothing more than a puppet theater, the bloodline of the modern world - the energy pipelines, the world gold reserves, the diamond industry, and, for that matter, just anything of any significance.

RIGHT NOW!

The ""king"" is Rothchild.

""Who Rothchild selects, will be a president of the USA"".

Simple, isn't it?
PURE elegance.

Masturbating about ""meditation""?

You want what?

""Enlightenment""?

No?

How about a CHIP in your brain?

No problems from then on.
No need for meditation.

No?

Not to worry."
,veerenski,2010-10-22T04:12Z,"OK, about ""masters"", just one more time:

When you say ""you are my master"", do you realize what you are saying?

What is master?

Well, master is one, who is good at something. So, good, that there is nothing he can not do in the area of his mastership.

But...

When you say ""you are my master"", what you are saying is that you are nothing more than a piece of wood.

Why?

Simple, really.

How can ANYONE be your ""master""?
Are you an object to be processed to make something worthwhile out of it, some masterpieces?

If so, you do need those intensive ""therapies"", just to clear your brain and make you realize some things about you.

Simple as that."
,veerenski,2010-10-22T04:15Z,"And what do you expect to happen as a result of those ""therapies""?

Well, simple really.

That you are nothing more than an idiot.

,veerenski,2010-10-22T16:48Z,"The story of a seeker:

When I was 25 years old, I used to play a flute. Now, in order for you to be any kind of a flute player, you need to be able to play six major pieces of Bach, specifically written for flute. If you can not play them, you are not a flute player. It is a must.

And those pieces are pretty complicated and intricate. So, you have to practice every day by the book. And it is a royal pain on the neck. Too complicated. Mind is hardly dragging alone being able to follow it all.

One day, out of the blue, when I was reading those notes during the daily practice, all of a sudden, boom! My mind would not even have to strain to be able to read the notes and playing would be happening by itself, without me making a single effort to understand it.

It lasted for about 30 seconds. After that, the same old drag of trying to concentrate on it and trying to follow all those notes.

That experience was like a shock. I immediately recognized it as something profoundly significant. So, I had a pretty large book collection with all sorts of ""advanced"" books. I opened up one of the books on Indian philosophy in order to see if I could find something on this phenomenon. Very quickly, I found this notion of ""atman"" or ""atma"", the ""ultimate"" blah, blah, blah.

And so I started digging. Started doing Yoga exercises and you name it. And so it took several years chasing those 30 seconds of utter silence, filled with the biggest miracle I ever saw.

Why do I tell you this? Well, you see, it turns out those 30 seconds were undeniably true. There IS such a state where the most amazing things happen without you making ANY effort.

Read these 21 Illuminati goals carefully:

http://educate-yourself.org/cn/johncolemangoalsofIlluminati.shtml

In particular:

1. To establish a One World Government/New World Order with a unified church and monetary system under their direction.

3. To engineer and bring about the destruction of religion, and more especially, the Christian Religion, with the one exception, their own creation, as mentioned above.

4. To establish the ability to control of each and every person through means of mind control and what Zbignew Brzezinski called techonotronics...

6. To encourage, and eventually legalize the use of drugs and make pornography an ""art-form""...

7. To bring about depopulation of large cities according to the trial run carried out by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia...

9. To cause. by means of limited wars in the advanced countries, by means of starvation and diseases in the Third World countries, the death of three billion people by the year 2050, people they call ""useless eaters""...

12. To introduce new cults and continue to boost those already functioning...

13. To continue to build up the cult of Christian Fundamentalism begun by the British East India Company's servant Darby, which will be misused to strengthen the Zionist State of Israel by identifying with the Jews through the myth of ""God's chosen people""...

14. To press for the spread of religious cults...

15. To export ""religious liberation"" ideas around the world so as to undermine all existing religions, but more especially the Christian religion...

18. To give the fullest support to supranational institutions such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank of International Settlements, the World Court and, as far as possible, make local institutions less effective, by gradually phasing them out or bringing them under the mantle of the UN."
