Has anyone been successful loading this game?
External doesn't work, when trying to install on internal; OM hangs at 14.04G, and Gaia installs all but still will not work.

Look, I generally don't bitch about getting something for nothing.  However this is about the 5th PS3 game by the up-loader that doesn't work, 0 for 5 is a pretty shitty record for whatever one does.  I can't snowboard a halfpipe, dance, or drive a golf ball 400 yds.  I know I can't do these things and have accepted it, I also don't keep trying doing them.  I was under the impression pink skulls were to be trusted.  If there is some trick to loading please put it in your description, I don't need to read the back of the box. 

4 days 16 hours - 1.98 share ratio = waste of time and bandwidth.  Not to mention the other 4 bullshit uploads."

1.place game file on external hdd via ftp or direct copy to external hdd
2. using multiman 2.09.02  enable external/BD mirror and usb patch/
3. start game from xmb with any ps3 game in BD.,drive
4. game will load and do the 1034mb install at the main menu. after that. start new game and wola. watch story then pick any prologue."
