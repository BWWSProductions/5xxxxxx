"FEEL FREE TO COPY THIS FOR WHOEVER YOU THINK COULD USE A COPY. KISS KISS, KATE
Youâ€™re better off alive, no matter how messed up you think you might be right now.
And youâ€™re better off alive no matter how mean someone is being to you. You are
simply better off alive than deadâ€”no matter who or what you are, no matter who
or what you love, and no matter what you do. Just donâ€™t be mean. Being mean never
works. Never. So thatâ€™s the only rule I can think of thatâ€™s worth following in life:
donâ€™t be mean. Yes, you can be mean to yourself if thatâ€™s whatâ€™s going to keep you
alive. Iâ€™m sorry if thatâ€™s happening to you. But keep in mind that there are
alternatives that hurt a lot less, and I hope you find one soon. Do what you have to
do, and stay alive because it gets better. I promise. xoxo Kate"

If you are ever in a place where you want to kill yourself, as long as you follow Kate's one rule of "Don't be mean," you can do whatever you want if it makes you stay alive.
