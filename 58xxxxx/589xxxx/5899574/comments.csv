,jammeke,2010-10-21T05:40Z,Ok nice if you where seeding ... no availibility here .. so ...
,JoshL11185,2010-10-21T05:48Z,"Ok, nice if you could spell. Remember the old days, when you would just click to download a torrent and then go do something else for a day? It's freakin 2.91 GB and my upload speed is about 562 kB/s, which is pretty good for non fiber optic, which they don't have in my area. I am seeding. If the world revolved around you, which you apparently think it does, It would still take 1 hour 30 minutes 25 seconds to seed it to JUST YOU!"
,Looch2,2010-10-21T05:48Z,"Why did post it and then not seed? =\

Thanks for the post though"
,edgardis,2010-10-21T05:50Z,Working?
,vanmanpro,2010-10-21T05:52Z,yeah haha would be golden if someone would seed it!
,Olive74000,2010-10-21T06:03Z,"Thx, but is it multi (especially french...) or only english ?"
,RitchieRich,2010-10-21T06:14Z,"Hey seeder!! Instead of posting a cover shot that I could simply go to Apple's website and print off myself. Why don't you lay out the DVD that's in the box. How about a recipt since you say you bought it? This guy has hardly any ups an the rest of you run and download it. That's really gonna suck if it has a backdoor or some other sort of malicious code in it. Plus, wouldn't there be other ups? Is this the only guy that bought a copy today?"
,skytripper,2010-10-21T06:17Z,"How did you get hold of a DVD of iLife 11 when this version was just announced today?

Downloaders beware!"
,atidus,2010-10-21T06:27Z,Thanks you. joshL11185.best wish for you!^^
,corruptedSoul,2010-10-21T06:44Z,"not that i doubt the uploader, but...

iLife 08 was 3.5GB
iLife 09 was 4.3GB

is iLife 11 really only 2.9GB?"
,soccernamlak,2010-10-21T06:50Z,"skytripper:  

iLife '11 was announced today AND was made available today, as said in the Keynote.  If you went to an Apple Store today, you could have bought a copy. "
,app0,2010-10-21T06:51Z,big thanks!
,Looch2,2010-10-21T06:51Z,"Looks like it's coming down pretty quickly now (already have 1gb in just a couple hours and I see at least one or two seeders, so it's picking up).  I'll seed for a while too once I'm done.

Thanks JoshL11185 !"
,Nickey209,2010-10-21T07:05Z,"Thank you A MILLION for posting this! :) I just wish more seeder were available, but its only been a few hours.... :)"

,JoshL11185,2010-10-21T07:18Z,"This disc was 3.5 GB but DMG's are compressed, so it's 2.91GB."
,Nickey209,2010-10-21T07:20Z,"For the people who is saying he isnt seeding, HE IS, and ive been downloading for 20 minutes and mine is half way done. People should just say THANK YOU. "

,swannies,2010-10-21T08:11Z,anyone installed it and does it work? its there a crack or keygen or serial code needed?

,bl4ckst4r,2010-10-21T09:37Z,"Thanks for the upload! Some of the ppl here are so damn clueless. The software literally came out -today- so yeah, it takes some time to seed. How about you STFU and show a little appriceation instead?"

,vilentj76,2010-10-21T10:27Z,Im seeding this right now at 3 MB/sec over my FiOS.  Ill keep it up for several hours to make sure seeds are planted for sharing...enjoy!
,BugsABunny,2010-10-21T10:40Z,"thx JoshL11185. have not dled fully yet but my intuition tells me you're trustworthy ;). There's 26 plp with 100% now so I dare say if the rls was not real we would already have gotten the news. Usually when people keep silent things are fine ....

@ all: if you compress with DropDMG and use highest compression rate in the prefs you can squeeze down a DVD image tremendously."
,BugsABunny,2010-10-21T10:42Z,"re. ""iLife '11 is Intel-only, so that probably shaves off a few Megabytes of PPC code. "": oops right, actually that shaves off some GIGAbytes of PPC code!"
,bubba1991,2010-10-21T10:45Z,Can you scan the CD and upload it somewhere please.  I just wanted to burn to my lightscribe disk 
,ahheck01,2010-10-21T10:51Z,"BugsABunny:  Good info, however the uploader mentioned he used Disk Utility for the image.  Not sure what kind of default compression that does.  Is it odd that the size on this site says 2.91GiB, and Vuze says 3.12?  "
,programhacker001,2010-10-21T10:59Z,hey i really appreciate u uploading this file tnx a lot! :D but i cant download it because nobody is seeding it here :(

And a reminder for torrents newbies :

2. It's normal if it's slow, there's more leechers (downloaders) than seeders (uploaders) because this torrent is a new born.

3. SEED, while you're downloading and afterwards. Otherwise, torrents die.

4. Do NOT register cracked products.

If you haven't yet installed your new copy of iLife '11, then DON'T!!!

There are very many stories in the relevant Apple Discussions forum that point to widespread problems of a very serious kind, most of them having to do with the iLife '11 installation process and/or the Library update process that occurs when you first open your photo Library(ies) with the new version of iPhoto. There are numerous reports of people having lost large portions of their photo libraries, the photos then being recoverable only via hard-core utilities such as Data Rescue 3 (which of course does not recover any of your albums, ratings, titles, or the rest)."

http://www.tuaw.com/2010/10/29/review-iphoto-11-is-a-very-mixed-bag/

Bugs and glitches

So with all these new features, why am I not jumping up and down with excitement? One big reason: iPhoto '11 is the buggiest piece of software Apple's delivered in my memory.

Apple's support boards are overflowing with unhappy upgraders. Many claim they have lost all of their photos, which could be true in some cases. It's also possible something went wrong with the library upgrade, and the photos are there but the database has become corrupted. Reportedly Apple is working on a fix, and if true, it needs to be a fast one. Make sure you have a good backup before you install."

So wouldn't it be fine for me to register it? The reason I'm asking this is because I see some of the commenters here said that it is not okay to register, saying that we must not register torrented files. But without the serial numbers, I just can't see the reason why."

1) Go to the file this file that you downloaded and double click on the dmg file
2) Then in a separate window it will show you a shortcut to ""install iLife"" and the ""readme"" file
3) Right-click on the ""install iLife"" file and click on the option that says ""show original""
4) You will then be in a folder called Packages
5) Look for the file ""iPhoto.pkg"" and double click on it
6) An installation  guide will come up and all you have to do is re-install it
7) Then once that has completed, go to software update and update your iPhoto
8) After that update, go to your Applications folder and click on your iPhoto - and there you have it.. your normal iPhoto!"
,plefko,2012-03-03T22:42Z,"Figured it out.. here is an easy way to get your iPhoto back!

1) Go to this downloaded file and double-click on the dmg file

3) Right-click on the install iLife file and then click on the show original button
4) You will then be in a folder called packages
5) Look for the file that is called iPhoto.pkg and double click on it
6) Follow the installation guide and re-install iPhoto
7) Go to Software Updates and update iPhoto
8) Your iPhoto is now as good as it was before the download of this torrent."
