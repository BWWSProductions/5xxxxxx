Recorded live in Boston at the Jazz Workshop in 1967 this disc demonstrates the majestic skill Gabor Szabo had. He could take a cheesy pop song made popular by Sony and Cher, like "The Beat Goes On" and really get the crowd into it, just loving it. On this familiar song he transforms the familiar into something new, bending the notes and transfixing the crowd and listener with his gypsyesque stylings, putting a spell on you, like the title itself suggets, from The Sorcerer. Part Django Reinhardt, part Wes Montgomery, all gypsy-jazz-guitar playing Hungarian, Gabor Szabo's fluid fingers are spellbinding. (from amazon.com review)
