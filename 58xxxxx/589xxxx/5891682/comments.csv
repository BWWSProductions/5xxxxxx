,listenherenow,2010-10-24T01:39Z,"Hi, everywhere I look for nero that will run in windows 7 premium 64bit - it says the software must be properley installed to work properly, wich leads me to believe that there is some trick to getting nero to run on the system.
   Also that it will run in 32bit emulation - not actual 64bit. 
   It's a little funny to me that this is mentioned everywhere BUT no specific instructions are given to install it on a windows 7 64 system. 

  I have been useing Nero on xp pro 32 for so long I have become reliant on it. Now I find my new system here makes me feel handicapped. 

Even playback sucks. 

   so wtf. LOL   why in the hell is 64 such a huge mystery for these developers. 

  seems as though programs I have installed that run in 32 bit mode on the 64 system fuck something up and run like shit. I am wondering if nero would do the same. 

 does anyone have any experience wwith putting this on a premium windows 7 64bit system? 
  Any Pointers at all? 

  Thanks. 
Photo shop installs have blown big donkeys as well by the way. still searching for that. "
,listenherenow,2010-10-24T04:57Z,"Hello,
  i was very worried that windows 7 premium 64 bot would need a 64bit version of nero.  i have been looking for a while now today. 

 thinking that probably only the latest version would do I have been pouring over software looking for a working copy. 

  Guess what I have found out. You May already know this but I thought some people may not.  BUT, Nero didnt make a 64 bit version. what they have done is say it's for 64 as well, then the put in a clause that it will only run in 32 bit emulation. and taht it will only run iof innstalled properly. ( Yet they do not give any specific directions for 64bit install Or even windows 7.) 

   I just totally gave up on teh idea becuase I am tired of installing stuff that I have to uninstall right away, seems when you do that a lot it tears down your OP eventually. 

  Anyway - I was thinking earlier that if that new 10 version of nero is not for 64bit, and My old flawlessly working on xp pro 32bit was also not for 64.   then Maybe my old software run like they said to run it, will also work. 

   Guess what.   Nero 7 updated and every thing is working excellently - show times and everythimng - no problems.   The only thing is its installes into x86 programfiles and runs just as it did on xp.  no slower - no faster. 

  seems good enough for me, I thought I would share that little tid bit for those of you despiratly searching for working programs that do not have crapped out flaws and crashes. 

  there is no special BS to do either - i used my old key and everything.  The one I got all that time ago right here on teh Bay. LOl

[T],L_Hammond,2010-12-19T14:18Z,"Works great straight out of the box. I'm using Windows 7 64 bit.

The Nero setup file needs to restart the computer which was a bit irritating, but after that the installer continued and it was all smooth sailing.

There are two files provided. The first is the Nero setup and the other is a little text file. The text file is aptly named 'Readme!.txt' with very clear installation instructions and a working serial number.

Thanks for sharing!"

6- After install, register with the key provided in the readme.

PS:
Shutting down your internet connection ain't enough, at least it wasn't for me.
Disconnect internet, install, restart your computer and continue the instalment. When you've got to chose between auto-install or manual install, be sure you click the manual install.
Then unselect the 'nero update', and proceed.
