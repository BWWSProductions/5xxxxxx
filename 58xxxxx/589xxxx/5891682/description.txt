Award-Winning Nero Burning ROM is the Only Burning Software Youâ€™ll Need! Nero 
Burning ROM offers you the most advanced disc burning solution. Nero Burning ROM - 
Leading CD, DVD and Blu-ray Disc burning and copying technology. When it comes to 
burning, accept nothing less than the industryâ€™s best. Award-winning Nero Burning 
ROM is known for reliable, high-quality CD, DVD and Blu-ray Disc burning and 
copying. Loaded with advanced features that go beyond just burning, it also 
features SecurDisc technology for the ultimate in data readability and protection. 

Itâ€™s the only program youâ€™ll need to save and share your files.
Nero Burning ROM gives you full, customized control of your burning projects. 
You can - among other things - define the file system, the length of the file name 
and the character set; you can also change the disc label. And of course, you can 
also customize the Nero Burning ROM toolbar and change the keyboard shortcuts.


Highlights:
- High quality disc burning and copying for superior quality playback
- Easy drag-and-drop burning to CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs
- Split oversized files to burn onto multiple discs at one time
- Ensure data readability regardless of scratches, age or deterioration
- Enhance security levels with personal passwords and encryption

Despite its wide range of features, Nero Burning ROM has remained an easy-to-use 
burning program that creates discs in just a few steps. You select the disc type 
to be burned (CD/DVD/Blu-ray), define the project type, add the required data and 
then start burning.

Using Nero Burning ROM you can save audio files from an Audio CD to the hard drive.
In the process, the files are encoded, i.e. converted into a format that the 
computer can read. The Audio CD can be automatically identified with Gracenote. 
So called metadata such as title, genre, and track title are accessed by the 
Gracenote Media Database and associated to the tracks. That way you have audio 
files that are accurately and fully named after the encoding process.

*** When using TPB please read these important notes: 
*****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security 
2- Avira AntiVir Premium 
3- avast! Pro Antivirus
4- Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.
Malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
