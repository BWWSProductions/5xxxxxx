you get the protection error because you have not blocked the programme accessing the internet."

,vms4fiend,2011-08-24T15:15Z,"******Vista 32-bit users******

1- Install the program but do not run after installation! (If you do, it's okay, just restart your computer).

2- Go to the start menu and run a search for ""Widows Firewall with Advanced Security"" and open the application.

3- Choose Inbound Rules and the choose New Rule. Select a rule for a Program and then specify the file path for Virtual DJ on your Hard Drive. Choose to block the connection for the program and make sure that it is blocked for all profile types (Domain, Private, Public). Give the rule a name if you'd like and choose Finish.

4- Repeat the same steps for Outbound Rules and you're done! Run Virtual DJ and put in the Serial. You should be ready to party...... now."

Manually editing the registry values doesn't work; you need the tool! Thank you! "
,benzofury,2012-05-07T03:05Z,"Thanks Oldskoolscouse for the awesome download. It works seamlessly. As for you people who are having troubles getting past the protection errors and to those of you who haven't tried, but aren't good at these sorts of things:

1. If you have already tried and got the protection error, some have said you can restart your computer and try again. I suggest you uninstall, restart, and reinstall, just so we're on the same page.

2. Again, erring on the side of caution, once you've downloaded the program, just..pull your ethernet cord out of your computer. Once you have done this, Go to Virtual DJ Pro 7, Right Click, and run as administrator. Also, open the file named ""Serieal & Instructions."" Highlight the code under SERIEAL NUMBER and COPY IT.

3. Once VDJ has finished installing, double click the new shiny desktop icon, which will Prompt you to insert a serial number. Right Click, Paste.

4. Close VDJ. Go to Control Panel, open System/Security, Windows Firewall, Allow a program/feature through Windows Firewall, Advanced Settings. Click on Inbound Rules. On the right, click New Rule. Select Program, click Browse, select virtual dj pro, click Next, and select Block the Connection. Name it whatever you'd like [vdj is what i chose]. Next click Outbound Rules and repeat the steps for the Inbound rule. I recommend restarting your computer just to make sure the settings get applied as i've had the protection bs come up after completing all of this before. A restart after creating the rules fixed this problem. 

5. Plug your ethernet cable back in and run VDJ. If you get a protection error, your running an antivirus program that has control of your firewall and figuring out how to block it from there is on you but shouldn't be difficult now that you've had some experience with this sort of thing. "
