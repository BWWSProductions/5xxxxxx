Belle and Sebastian are an indie pop band formed in Glasgow in January 1996. Belle and Sebastian are often compared to influential indie bands such as The Smiths, as well as classic acts such as Love, Bob Dylan and Nick Drake. The name Belle & Sebastian is inspired by Belle et SÃ©bastien, a children's book by French writer CÃ©cile Aubry. Lauded by critics, Belle & Sebastian's "wistful pop" has nevertheless enjoyed only limited commercial success.
