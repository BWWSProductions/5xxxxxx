,Bidsness,2011-04-17T12:36Z,"Hey 2040..really appreciate your torrents. This is not a complain that am going to make, its more of a request..you said not to request movies that have imdb rating lower than 4.4..well imdb can go wrong sometimes. Rare times though, but its not impossible to get struck by rarity."
,Bidsness,2011-04-17T12:41Z,"You should opt for ""Le prince de ce monde""...it got real low ratings. But its a fine example of revolutionary cinema. I came across this movie in our film festival."
,Bidsness,2011-04-17T12:42Z,Its cinema at its core. Check it out sometime and forgive me if you end up hating it like many others. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0846068/ It got 4.2. And sorry for the long talk..sadly am a person of too many words. Godspeed.
