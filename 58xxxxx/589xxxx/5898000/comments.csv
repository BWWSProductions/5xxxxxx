,dwbeez,2012-04-06T21:55Z,"Can someone download the Video of ""Lift Him Up"". I have just found my old ""God is Able"" video. I have the CD's but unfortunatly I gave away most all  my VHS when DVD came out. As far as I know they never re-released these on DVD. Before I can upload the God is Able I have to capture and do some serious video editing and clean up to get the best possible quality. I will try my best to get this done soon but my father just passed away a few days ago. I work in full studio for audio and video so I have access to lots of enhancement equipment but it will be a few. But I would love to have LIFT HIM UP on video."
