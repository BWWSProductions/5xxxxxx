You can stop seeding E01E13 Performances (437Mb) now, plenty of seeds.

S01E14 Performances *please*"
[V],verovenlo,2010-10-22T00:08Z,damn hit and runners i fucking hate it

Sorry - on dial-up here so not always indicating. Will take a copy to my neighbour and ask him to help seeding this one.

It's a pity that there is not PM on here so that you could ensure that people READ the notices about hit-and-run.  

At the moment this torrent is showing 3 Seeds and 17 Peers.

We will do our best with our very limited connections from NZ.

Al het beste (I learnt a little bit of Afrikaanse at school)."

Thanks for coming back to this one Vero - I am now helping my vriend download the last 10% of this one.  I thought he would have it by now but was probably throttled until 2am (1300GMT).

Also standing by with the same person to download both S01E14 (Perform) and S01E16 Final when it is seeded.  There are (13) Peers waiting for both (above 80% done for both).

Don't want to miss out because of our slow download speeds when they hit-and-run before we have got it all."
,asighkick,2010-10-22T02:44Z,"OOpps....

Meant the last 10% of S01E13 Performances..."

Can you get your hands on the first season of the Australian x-factor too? :-D"
,jackb.tb,2010-10-23T22:18Z,some dodgy fuckers here
,jackb.tb,2010-10-23T22:27Z,them that upload without saying thanks to the original capper and asighkick/sighco
,asighkick,2010-10-24T01:24Z,"@jackb.tb

I am not sure if you are including me in the group you call dodgy or not but would like to point out that ANYONE trading in TVRips is DODGY!  Ahoy Matey :-)

Get over it already.

I am trying to do my bit by NOT being a hit-and-runner despite having lousy internet connections and rip-off costs.

@verovenlo - Just S01E14 Performances left please ;-)"
,gaymormonguy,2011-12-21T01:35Z,"Can you please seed the x factor uk season 1?  I want to download it but there are no seeds.  I also want to download season 2,3,4,5,6 but there are no seeds :-("
