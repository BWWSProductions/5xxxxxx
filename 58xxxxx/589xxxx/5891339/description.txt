14Oct2010 The Ugly Truth Broadcast-Jeff Rense Threatens to Call FBI on Mark Glenn

Some people call this 'infighting'. I call it keeping people honest; 'checks and balances' if you will. Yet another truther is throwing his weight around by trying to intimidate a real truther by the name of Mark Glenn. To learn more you can go here


and then listen to the file. Rense is yet another egomaniac who dares to be questioned and I think that after you listen to Mark Glenn's audio you will realize he is truly committed to the truth.

This is a man who is not getting rich off the truth movement like Rense and Jone$$$. He co-authored a book with USS Liberty survivor Phil Tourney and he doesn't ever beg people to buy his book or ask for money bombs.

Well enough from boring old me.  Here is a description of the file.

Quote:
Alex Jones the most dangerous man in the â€˜truth movementâ€? THINK AGAIN. For all Jonesâ€™ danger as an agent of disinformation, at least he is not ready, willing and able to send armed thugs into the home of someone he disagrees with politically. Come listen to todayâ€™s program as we discuss Jeff Renseâ€™s recent threats to have agents of the FBI and Department of Homeland Security visit the home of Mark Glenn, where he resides with his wife and 9 children over a personal dispute.

Jeff Renseâ€™s recent postings of Islamophobic articles of â€œneo-conservativeâ€ orientation on his site is another aspect of this curious storyâ€¦
