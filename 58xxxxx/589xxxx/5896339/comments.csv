but how do you get it to work.
i click on the app, it appears in itunes, but when i try to sync my ipod, it says it cant sync fifa 11 ???"
,MGTGamer,2010-10-22T20:35Z,"you have to jailbreak you ipod...use limera1n or jailbreakme.com to do it (google for guide)..jailbreak will install cydia to your ipod, then you have to install appsync from cydia..now itunes will sync any app without any problems"
,mascherano16,2010-10-25T20:18Z,"ok, i jailbreaked my ipod touch with limera1n, installed the cydia app, but now i need to install another app on cydia which let me sync any op from itunes without any probz ???

whats the exact name of that app ?"
,MGTGamer,2010-10-27T14:01Z,"AppSync...but you can't install it until you have the hackulo.us source added to cydia

1. open up Cydia.

2. Open the â€ Manage â€ option at the bottom.

3. Tap on â€ Sources â€œ.

4. Tap on â€ Edit â€œ.

5. Now tap on â€ Add â€ to add a source.

6. Now enter â€œ http://cydia.hackulo.us â€ and tap on â€ Add Source â€œ. Now Cydia starts to add sources.

7. Now search AppSync for OS 4.0, select it and tap on â€ Install â€ to install AppSync on your iPhone running 4.0 firmware."

,Mi.To,2010-11-30T22:38Z,"@MGTGamer - Hey, thank you for uploading this file, but i dont think it's cracked. 
I have a cracked Ipod Touch 2G running on the latest firmware of 4.2.1 - But this app wont sync, even though u check the box for it. Refuses to sync"
,MGTGamer,2010-12-01T20:19Z,did you install appsync from cydia (hackulo.us source)? that might be the reason for the problem with syncing..
,r-0987,2010-12-03T22:45Z,Can This Play On Ipod Touch 4th Generation With OS 4.2??
,MGTGamer,2010-12-05T15:14Z,yes u can
,vichetmeng,2010-12-07T00:44Z,"Guys, as you can see in the description....

""The console-like graphic quality and sophisticated animation of FIFA 11 requires a relatively larger file size, plus a 3GS or later device. Therefore, we recommend downloading the game to the iTunes library synced with your device.""

You will only be able to sync this game on to 3gs or later... hope this helps :)"
