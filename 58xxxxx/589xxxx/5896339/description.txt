WANT TO DOWNLOAD FASTER? DOWNLOAD TO THE iTUNES LIBRARY SYNCED WITH YOUR DEVICE.

The console-like graphic quality and sophisticated animation of FIFA 11 requires a relatively larger file size, plus a 3GS or later device. Therefore, we recommend downloading the game to the iTunes library synced with your device.
