I got that error on uTorrent (in portuguese) and I tried changing the directory a few times but still doesn't work. Could you guys help me out?

I'll ask google meanwhile,great torrent"
,RaySoul,2010-11-19T23:23Z,"Oh,sorry,I found the solution

If anyone else is having this error: ""The requested operation cannot be performed on a file with a user-mapped section open""

Then just go to your control panel and select ""Indexing options""
I'm using Windows 7 so not sure the layout on other OSs, but it's probably pretty similar. There should be an 'Advanced' option and then select the 'file types' tab. Uncheck the box for torrent files.
In the locations option uncheck the box for the folder you are downloading to

Hope this helped

There are usually 3500 people on each realm at any given time and the core is relatively stable and bug-free. Below is a list of easy to follow steps that will let you play on Molten WoW, absolutely free!

1. https://www.molten-wow.com/support/tos/reg/ - At the bottom of the page there is a text-entry field, type I AGREE into it and hit ""Continue Registration""


2. You should now be at the account creation page. Enter your desired account details into the appropriate fields, your MSN, Skype and Country information are optional. 


3. Navigate to the folder you have installed World of Warcraft to. You should see a folder called ""Data"" inside of it, navigate to that folder and then navigate to the ""enUS"" folder.


4. Inside of the ""enUS"" folder, you will see a file called ""realmlist.wtf"", open the file with:

Windows Users - Notepad or any basic file editor, Do not use Microsoft Word, Wordpad, Open office etc. These files store editor data inside of the file you are editing, which may stop World of Warcraft from reading the file correctly.

Linux Users - Any editor that does not store editor data inside of the file. Nano, ViM, Leafpad etc.

5. Completely replace everything inside of realmlist.wtf with the following information:

set realmlist logon.molten-wow.com

Read the information below very carefully:

Use Wow.exe to launch World of Warcraft instead of launcher.exe (Launcher.exe will herein be known as Blizzard Launcher) - If you use the Blizzard Launcher to launch World of Warcraft
your realmlist.wtf file will be reset and your game will start patching to the latest version.

7. Start World of Warcraft using wow.exe.

8. Enter the account details you signed up with, select your desired realm.

9. Create your character and enter the game. 

10. Congratulations! You should now be playing World of Warcraft completely free of charge.

Ok this is all you need to do:
1. Download the game (make sure it's EU, you can even download it from blizzard).
2. Update the game but not over the patch 3.3.5a.
3. Go to game directory. Open Data -> enGB -> realmlist (notepad).
4. Replace ""set realmlist eu.logon.worldofwarcraft.com"" with ""set realmlist wow.freakz.ro"".

More of the server
- All instances are working (WOTLK - Ruby Sanctum, ICC, TOC; BC - Black Temple, Tempest Keep)
- Server located in Romania
- 3000+ members online each day
- PVP all arenas working and classes fully scripted
- Helpful and committed GMs
- Armory and everything you could wish for are on the site
- Customizable rates (reputation and experience)
- No lag at all (100mbps net, Core I7 980, 16 BG RAM)
- Working Dungeon Finder

So if you want to give a chance to Freakz server then go to http://wow.freakz.ro/register.php?inviter=1654. There register and you are good to go.
