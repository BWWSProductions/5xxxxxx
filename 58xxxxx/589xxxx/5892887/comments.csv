,todger69,2010-10-28T06:19Z,whats the point of uploading things if you never seed been trying to download constantly for weeks stuck on 40%
[T],Valdo__PT,2010-10-28T23:35Z,"Well I seed everyday, it is impossible to be trying to download for weeks since it was uploaded only a week ago... as I wrote I seed everyday, but I don't have the PC on all day, I work and I seed since I get home from work till I go to sleep and that is at least 5 hours everyday..."
[T],Valdo__PT,2010-10-30T00:47Z,Hey  todger69 how about saying thank you now that there are already a lot of seeders? There are always a lot of ungrateful fellows everywhere...
