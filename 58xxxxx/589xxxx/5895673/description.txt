From street urchin to knight of the realm: the story of Norman Wisdom, who
used to be one of the biggest film stars in the UK - portraying a man who rarely
stepped out of character in public, and whose highly individual comic style hid
the private tragedy of his early life.

The actor's life story is told through the people who knew him well: his son and
daughter Nick and Jaqui Wisdom, and his daughter-in-law Kim, plus film
director Stephen Frears, actors Ricky Tomlinson, Leslie Phillips and Honor
Blackman and singer Dame Vera Lynn.
