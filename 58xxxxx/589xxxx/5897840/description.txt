Five contestants who didn't make it to the ranch in the premiere 

episode now return, all vying for a spot back in the 

competition. Whoever has the highest percentage of weight loss 

wins their way back in, and also wins one of the most important, 

game-changing decisions of the season when the competition moves 

to blue team vs. black team this week. In their first challenge 

as blue team vs. black, they race through food stations in 

downtown Los Angeles, answering food trivia questions that come 

with a physical challenge penalty if they choose the wrong 

answer. And the stakes are high with the winning team getting 

"The Biggest Loser" meal plan by Ediets for each member, plus 

the always-coveted reward of letters from home. When one team 

proves victorious, members of the losing team get a heartwarming 

surprise. Later, the drama heats up when a rumor spreads of one 

team possibly throwing the weigh-in, and after a tense weigh-in, 

the players send another contestant home.
