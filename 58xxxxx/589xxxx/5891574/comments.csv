What a waste of the 3 days it took to download... Definitely the movie and very clear.. if you can watch it on your computer without the extremem lag then it's an okay download. "
,Maverick,2010-10-27T14:06Z,"InstantStarFan7: I ahve just seen this film on a 52"" TV. 10/10 picture and 10/10 DTS audio (considering the movie). It played brilliantly. You should not use a children's computer game console to watch movies, but get a dedicated media player."
,thewave69,2010-11-19T21:42Z,Can you save this movie on a ps3 with the ps3 media server??
,InstantStarFan7,2010-12-13T18:56Z,"Maverick, are you seriously calling a PS3 a ""Children's Gaming Console""? LOL Do you have any idea how many adults use the ps3? It plays HD vidoes brilliantly & also plays the 30 store bought Blu Rays I have, so your point was ridiculous. The movie cannot be streamed to PS3 due to a truncating error and I know how to make everything work in those situations. "
,InstantStarFan7,2010-12-13T18:57Z,"I said the quality was great for those who will play it on their computer, I was just warning those who stream it to PS3 that it would not work. Using my computer would not work for two reasons, one being because I do not have my computer in the same room as the 52 inch Tv to connect it to. Plus, not everyone has 8mb of Ram to smoothly play this HD video size without lag."
,InstantStarFan7,2010-12-13T18:57Z,"Hello ""TheWave"" Yes most all movies over 4gb can be transfered to PS3 using the TV Versity program and it doesn't take long at all, however this particular (Great) upload for COMPUTERS, will not work because of a truncating error. "
