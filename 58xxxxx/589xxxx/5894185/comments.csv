,aer9998,2011-05-15T15:57Z,"why is this an exe file? even if its legit, thats gonna put people off"
,Selfishs,2012-03-15T06:21Z,"FUCKERS! Theres a rootkit in it ... SWEET! When u scan this .exe no virus-program says, that theres a virus. When u start .exe there comes a button which u can press and get the files right now. During this process my av-prog says theres a rootkit in it. Upload extracted files on VirusTotal and no av-prog says theres a rootkit ... I hope those fuckers who made and upload this, die a long painfull way!"
