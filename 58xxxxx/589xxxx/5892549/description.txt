
	This is a Slovenian localized version of Ubuntu 10.10.
It is set up with Linux Newbies in mind. It is simple to run and simple to use.

It contains most used plugins and codecs so no further action is needed for full internet experience, for enjoing music or videos. Just bake a fine fresh DVD, run your machine from it and enjoy!
