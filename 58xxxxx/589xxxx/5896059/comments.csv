Joined up with Kickasstorrents and found heaps of your uploads there.  It looked like I would finally find X Factor S01E13 & S01E14 Performances and S01E16 Final along with S01E13 Results.

:-( - no seeds either, uses same open trackers.

Looks like you are our last hope Verovenlo - when you find time please ;-)"
[V],verovenlo,2010-10-20T03:24Z,ok i will seed them tomorrow
[V],verovenlo,2010-10-20T23:18Z,is this your ip 202-169-219-118.worldnet.co.nz asighkick coz its not downloading iam seeding now
,asighkick,2010-10-21T02:24Z,"@verovenlo - thanks.

Not a good idea to post actual IP's but it's done now - pity we can't PM on this tracker ;(

That IP is from a neighbour, mine is similar and I have left the downloading to him and sharing seeding when it's down.

Will keep my eyes open for a NEW upload of the real S01E13 Results (please change the file name slightly so it doesn't overwrite the incorrectly named S01E13 Performances (this one is seeding now ;-)


Thanks again."
,asighkick,2010-10-21T02:57Z,"@nedamgol

Please note that you will have to rename S01E13 Performances (it is currently named Results) otherwise it will overwrite the real Results file.

This is for when you do the season by season uploads."
[V],verovenlo,2010-10-21T03:49Z,"a fresh ep 13 results is here

,asighkick,2010-10-21T05:54Z,"Thanks Verovenlo - I am getting this episode S01E13 Results myself whilst my neighbour is still getting S01E13 Performances (his download had stalled for some reason).

We will seed the lot for a couple of days once all are downloaded."
