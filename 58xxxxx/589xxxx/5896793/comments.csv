  I am new to Flac.  I realize they are rated for superior quality.  i was wondering if you can recommend the best converter and possibly tell me what i can use to just play them directly.  The best way . there is like a million different things online but I hate to try a bunch of bogus ones if I can get an expert opinon.  LOL 

   Thanks man.  "

I highly recommend using Media Monkey as it supports FLAC playback as well as virtually all other popular audio formats, and the free version will suffice for what you have in mind.

Media Monkey allows you to convert audio formats, for instance it allows you to convert FLAC files to WAV or MP3 files and vice versa. 

I have used MM on Windows XP/Vista(32/64),Windows 7(32/64) for several years on the earlier OS's and more recently on 7, and I also use it 2 stream music directly from my Windows Home Server.

MM is the only SW that I know of that will allow a user to normalize the audio level of MP3 files prior to converting them to AUDIO-CD format(this is must have feature when creating custom AUDIO-CD's, of MP3's from various sources).

It also supports shoutcast and will play internet radio stations directly, that support the PLS/M3U etc..,format(s).

.....I say go 4 it!"
