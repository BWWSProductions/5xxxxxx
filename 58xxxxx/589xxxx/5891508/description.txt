The Lion is a formidable assassin - clever, skilled, and cruel. In Albuquerque, he forces police detective Tom Armstrong into a tailspin of grief. Several years later, Armstrong's living alone in Mexico when the FBI seeks him out to help: they may have a lead on the Lion. Back in Albuquerque it seems that the Lion has unfinished business, and while he pursues his unknown objectives, he also stays one deadly step ahead of the police and the FBI. For Armstrong it's personal. Can he return to the states and find the arch villain, or is he walking back into more pain and loss?
