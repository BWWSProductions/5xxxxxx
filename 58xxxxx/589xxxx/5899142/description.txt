Alex welcomes back to the show attorney Randy Kelton. Kelton hosts the Rule Of Law Radio program and is the founder of jurisimprudence.com. Kelton has discussed with Alex how the legal system can be used against corrupt cops, district, city, county attorneys, and judges. Quoting from his Juris-Imprudence, Kelton notes: "No official has any immunity from criminal prosecution. The power to take back control of the legal system lies in that simple realization. The real check to abuse of power has always been in the hands of the people, yours and mine."

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
