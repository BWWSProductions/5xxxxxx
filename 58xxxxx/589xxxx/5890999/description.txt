The Sugarcubes
Stick Around For Joy
1992

From wikipedia:

Stick Around For Joy released in February 1992 was the third and final album released by the Icelandic alternative rock band The Sugarcubes. In terms of quality fans usually rate the album somewhere between the band's acclaimed debut, Life's Too Good and the widely panned follow-up Here Today, Tomorrow, Next Week!. The album provided the band's first and only hit, aptly titled "Hit", which reached #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. and #17 on the UK Singles Chart.

"Hit" was covered by The X Factor contestant Diana Vickers on her 2010 debut album Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree.

If you have some Sugarcubes's singles in lossless flac, please share it!
Also, I'm looking for BjÃ¶rk's SHM-CD release on FLAC, like Debut, Homogenic, Vespertine and Medulla.
