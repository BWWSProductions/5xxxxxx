,thrillerrock,2010-10-23T13:52Z,I KNOW THAT A LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR THAT SERIES
,cortez_the_killer,2010-11-13T02:43Z,RiddlerA I just want to say how much I appreciate your effort in uploading these man. I only have a minimal download cap and it's great to get these shows in half the standard file size. Thanks you are a legend.
,Chaps24,2010-12-10T07:21Z,"Hey Riddler, thanks for the up, but is there any chance you could do these in avi?  I recently found about this show and it's sick, but I can't watch mkv's on a PS3, so I'm having to watch these on my tiny ass computer screen."
,ibustins,2010-12-12T12:18Z,"@Chaps24 You can download a program called PS3 Media Server that allows you to stream unsupported file types. It transcodes the files on the fly so that your PS3 can read .mkvs, etc."
,Chaps24,2010-12-15T07:38Z,"@ibustins  Thanks so much dude.  I've always been using a USB key to watch on my PS3, as it didn't seem to be worth the hassle to dl a beta program to watch vids, but having the Media Server to stream the mkvs is perfect.  Thanks again."
,SpicyTij,2011-01-28T05:08Z,"Thx & cheers for the upload, RiddlerA. Seed I will. "
,spleen99,2011-04-30T07:36Z,"um... file size is small, but video quality is half of what you would expect at the same time. if you watch on a tv, it looks quite bad. props for the effort, tho. "
,brianshe,2011-05-05T20:14Z,How do I disable the subtitles? 
,2manydoobies,2011-05-12T04:31Z,"FYI 

These Mastroka  or AKA ""MKV"" files can be nice in a sense that the files aren't as large as AVI files
but NOTE
AVI files tend to be more compatible with alot more devices, MKV is nice if you plan on sitting at your computer to watch your show + dont have a big harddrive
that being said, if you like putting files onto a terabite harddrive (or any external harddrive) or you have a big enough internal harddrive and your collecting tons of movies and shows. Then AVI will probably serve you better.

I personally like to save files to a external terabite drive, then drag whatever i want to watch onto a 16GB sandisk usb flash drive, then i plug the flash drive into my xbox and watch videos through my xbox with my killer digital surround and hdmi cable. But if i use MKV files like this one, my xbox doesn't recongnize the videos that are on the flashdrive and therefor doesn't work...... SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FILES ARE MORE LIKELY TO WORK WITH A WIDER RANGE OF DEVICES (I.E. XBOX PS3 OR IPODS AND WII AND WHATEVER ELSE) THEN YOUR BETTER OFF DOWNLOADING THE AVI FORMATS!!!!!!!!!!!!

i posted this because i just downloaded  80gb of files that were mastroka  aka MKV, and they didn't work... hopefully this helps those of you that do things similar to the way i like to"
,Rabid_Possumsex,2011-08-23T00:25Z,"@2manydoobies and if ur not a faggot mac user your computer should have an HDMI port already anyway so it shouldnt matter.

btw noob, VLC player."
,Hobler,2011-09-22T14:39Z,"Thanks again RiddlerA
Great stuff"
,nifiles,2011-10-15T22:04Z,"thank you..great series, just love it!"
,coPe24,2011-11-18T03:52Z,Thanks RiddlerA!!! Great as always.  Appreciate the upload.
,MightyLT,2011-12-27T01:13Z,"@ 2manydoobies for a bunch of tech savvy folks you guys have no sense of direction sometimes...  I prefer the MKV file type... Why? Because it's small and I'm able to take off the PS3 Cinema protection with it...  I downloaded the MKVVOB program which turn your MKV movies into any file type you like... O does it within 5 minutes tops...

 If I have an AVI (or MP4) file or the program won't read the MKV... I send it to the MKV Merge program which will fix the file type to MKV and send it thru the MKV VOB afterwards...  This process is all of 7 minutes to do and you won't see the CINAMA mute ish on your PS3...  Win all the way around..."
