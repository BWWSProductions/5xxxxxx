,koora888,2010-10-20T08:15Z,"hey , first thanks for the upload , 

second i have a question , im kinda confused , first time to start collecting x men comics , now i have Uncanny xmen till 528 and x men legacy , but now im confused there are many curse of the mutants some of them with numbers and some arent lol

i dont know are they new uncanny x men issues or what !! lol"
[V],mirrormaster82,2010-10-20T15:35Z,koora888:uncanny x-men and x-men legacy don`t have anything to do with curse of the mutants saga.Curse of the mutants is happening in x-men only and a bunch of one-shots or specials such as namor - the first mutant etc....Hope  this helps...
,koora888,2010-10-20T16:34Z,"thanks for the reply mirrormaster , i was having problem in organizing the files and didnt know where to put ones like this upload lol , 

also what do u think about the second coming story line , 

now i have uncanny,astonishing,legacy xmen and x force , 

do i miss something if i dont get the other series that has some second coming issues or it not even related? 

(im confused coz i got tons of x men comincs in 3 days lol)

and again big thanks for the uploads really enjoying it ."
[V],mirrormaster82,2010-10-20T19:29Z,"koora888:For second coming you have everything( uncanny,x-men,legacy,x-force),I think there were a few issues of new mutants 12,13,14 if I`m not mistaken and they were kinda connected to the event,otherwise all others like x-factor,hellbound etc. were not important.All in all,I think you only need new mutants and thats it..."
