,Mitala,2010-10-21T19:53Z,logtran001; good comment! I have been in too this conspiracy theory fog to long! People do not mind this nonsense! Every thing from 9/11 to Alien invaders. That is all misinformation to distract you from the real stuff going on on this earth. We as a human species must get together for ever. We are all united! Stop being scared of stuff that is so far out there. Live your life in peace and love. Do not bother trying to solve everything. Just stay humble and loving! Take care!! Much love!!

12.21.2012 will be another December day.  Very similar to 1.1.2000
