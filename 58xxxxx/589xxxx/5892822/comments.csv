,spatkar17,2010-12-13T15:26Z,"man!!
how come can they slow it down!!!

okay...
i checked it and possibly found out the error
in ur torrent client go to trackers.. above the speed of uload and dload speed.
delete those trackers who cannot find hostname or error!!
this might do the work!!
otherwise it is good CLEAN and WORKING tottally!!"

,murrambingi,2011-01-05T05:44Z,"@spatkar17,

Your trackers do work but out of the 49 trackers you have, there are actually only 19 as there are multiple copies of the exact same tracker, one of the trackers has 5 copies which means you have not checked your list properly, i think that you have copied these trackers from some one who has uploaded them and classed them as your own.
Anyhow good upload thx :)"
,pipgirl,2011-01-05T12:05Z,I still can't figure out how to see wich tracker has and error or can't find a hostname...the speed is same as before 50-100 kB/s :( please HELP !!
,spatkar17,2011-01-07T19:22Z,"@murrambingi:

,shamozzle,2011-02-01T05:58Z,"thanks a lot spatkar, very handy upload indeed!"
,ToniSoto,2011-02-01T19:37Z,"OK, this is the 1st time I've come accross a list of trackers for my bittorent but I certainly hope it does the trick. The way I see it is that you right click on the torrent u r downloading select Properties from the bottom of the drop out menu and u should see a window with listed trackers there with a space between each tracker. Then you open the text file downloaded from here and copy the contents into that tracker window. make sure there are spaces between each tracker. once you've pasted click ok to close that tracker window. THEN. Left click once on the active torrent to which you have just added the additional trackers. on the bottom of your torrent program you should have several information lines for that particular torrent. One of those lines sais trackers. click on it and it shows u which trackers r working. Basicaly, right click remove any tracker that is not working. End of story. If I have described something wrong or have omitted anything please correct me for the sake of all of us. THANK YOU."
,Ropower,2011-02-08T03:47Z,"Don't waste your time, just use btReAnnounceR
http://btreannouncer.net/
Upload the torrent and it finds all the trackers for it"
,michael_mm,2011-02-08T20:03Z,how does it work?
,killerkazama11,2011-02-10T04:00Z,"@ spatkar17

This list has worked great for me and I've told others about it too. I was curious how you compiled these so I tried making my own list to upload. You're right about it not being easy. I've found many people posting HUGE lists of trackers, so I sort through them and give them a try on a really popular torrent. I figured that would be a good test. I have to say, most of these lists are absolute SHIT. So, I give up. Thanks again though man."
,killerkazama11,2011-02-10T04:04Z,"BTW, one of the lists I sorted through had about 800 trackers in it. Out of those I found 2 that worked. lol"
