Hi World,

After five years, I'm THRILLED to announce that The Spirit Molecule will be released by October 2010. I strongly believe your support, patience, and belief in this film, allowed it to materialize through physical communities, the Internet, festivals/events, South America, etc. Thank you. I dreamt of this day many times, but never expected tears when announcing the release- I stand corrected. I'm truly excited to share this film with the world.

As we developed our distribution model, we continually felt more comfortable outside the box, especially considering the subject matter of the film. We went with the Trojan horse approach, the appearance of a traditional model (submit to as many festivals possible), but knew our audience was much wider. To that end, we decided to release as wide as possible, as quick as possible. So, when we physically premier this fall, we will simultaneously release the DVD/PPV for the world. As part of the physical premier, we also hope to have a live stream from the location (TBD) so the world can share in the premier. Additionally, we have an iPhone application (other devices soon) in the works, which features access to the entire collection of interview footage, roughly 100 hours. Finally, once we regroup from post-production, and screen some festivals, we plan to construct the DMT remix project, allowing anyone access to the collection of interview footage, original VFX, and original music to create their own Spirit Molecule film.

Although it has taken longer than anticipated, it has been integral in building our fan base. And due to that network, we have a rare opportunity to show the relevance, and potential, of this simple molecule, which seems to open the door to another reality. Over the last decade, I've witnessed a worldwide consciousness/psychedelic community reawaken and grow, and I need to access the potential of the community. As we prepare for the launch, we intend to reach as many people as possible, so I gracefully ask for your assistance. Considering the diversity, and size, of the community, we can make Google take notice. If you work in (or know someone) in PR, design/code for the web, create street art, or just want to help push this message forward, please use your talent, imagination, or knowhow to help us create buzz.

Thanks again for your support. More soon.

Regards,
Mitch Schultz

SYNOPSE

THE SPIRIT MOLECULE weaves an account of Dr. Rick Strassman's groundbreaking DMT research through a multifaceted approach to this intriguing hallucinogen found in the human brain and hundreds of plants, including the sacred Amazonian brew, ayahuasca. Utilizing interviews with a variety of experts to explain their thoughts and experiences with DMT, and ayahuasca, within their respective fields, and discussions with StrassmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s research volunteers, brings to life the awesome effects of this compound, and introduces us to far-reaching theories regarding its role in human consciousness.


RICK STRASSMANÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S OVERVIEW

In 1990, I began the first new human research with psychedelic, or hallucinogenic, drugs in the United States in over 20 years. These studies investigated the effects of N, N-dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, an extremely short-acting and powerful psychedelic. During the project's five years, I administered approximately 400 doses of DMT to 60 human volunteers. This research took place at the University of New Mexico's School of Medicine in Albuquerque, where I was tenured Associate Professor of Psychiatry. I was drawn to DMT because of its presence in all of our bodies. Perhaps excessive DMT production, coming from the mysterious pineal gland, was involved in naturally occurring "psychedelic" states. These might include birth, death and near-death, psychosis, and mystical experiences. Only later, while the study was well under way, did I also begin considering DMT's role in the "alien abduction" experience. The DMT project was founded on cutting edge brain science, especially the psychopharmacology of serotonin. However, my own background powerfully affected how we prepared people for, and supervised, their drug sessions. One of these was a decades-long relationship with a Zen Buddhist training monastery.
