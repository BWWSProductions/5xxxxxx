                    Medical drama series. Connie clashes with  
                    Hanssen, the new joint Director of Surgery.  
                    Determined not to share the position, she  
                    attempts to establish herself as top dog, but  
                    her efforts end in humiliation. Joseph tries to  
                    dismiss Jac's cynical view of a grieving Faye,  
                    but a terrible lie on Faye's part changes his  
                    opinion. Michael sets his sights on selling  
                    himself as the saviour of the hospital via  
                    Holby Care, but Hanssen has a different plan  
                    for him.
