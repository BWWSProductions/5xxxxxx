Alternatively, you can download a bunch of codecs, but why do that?"
,ionnamun,2011-02-17T15:27Z,"or use media player classic from filesharingplace.com
I prefer it because the interface is more user friendly and I never got VLC working the way I want it to. Also, MPClassic can download subtitles from opensubtitles.com"
