Think of the construction of the great pyramids of Egypt, or the development of democratic rule in ancient Greece. Recall the innovations of the European Renaissance and EnlightenmentÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥the remarkable flowering of drama and the arts, and revolutionary breakthroughs in science and philosophy.

These are intriguing and important episodes, familiar to students of history. But haven\'t you also wondered: What else was going on in the world?

Consider the enthralling tales of Venetian trader Marco Polo. He introduced the Western world to mysterious and exotic Asian cultures never before imagined. Those alien civilizations he visited had existed for centuries, even millennia. What do we know about that part of the story?

We know of the glories of ancient Rome, the commanding empire that ruled the known worldÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥but what about the lands that were not \"known\"? What, for example, of the Han dynasty in China? It existed alongside the Roman Empire but developed a more enduring legacy than that of the emperors of the Eternal City. How does that imperial saga relate to the more familiar story of Roman domination?

And in the Dark Ages that came after the fall of the Roman Empire, we know that the era following Rome\'s glory days brought great political and social turmoil to the peoples of Europe. But at that time the Muslims of the Middle East and North Africa were experiencing remarkable cultural flourishing that produced innovations in art, medicine, philosophy, and technologyÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥a true golden age for the civilization.

If you have wondered about these other historiesÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥of China and Japan, of Russia, India, and the remote territories of Sub-Saharan Africa and South AmericaÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥you can now discover how these stories fit in with commonly known accounts of Western traditions.
