,Zuhan,2010-11-07T22:21Z,"There seems to be some SUBs missing from time to time, and some SUBs that appear for only a brief moment. Is this the subber's problem, or is it the program? I have seen it around episodes 101 - 108"
,Zuhan,2010-11-09T05:45Z,"Ok, scratch what I last said. It seems its only from the Subbers Rumbel-Higure, and Mashumaro. As soon as I hit episode 122 everything was fine."
,dadakun,2010-12-13T15:57Z,Great! thanks!
,thecoolio,2010-12-24T11:19Z,"I can't play episodes 90-105. They seem to be in an unreadable .mkv format according to my VLC player.

I tried using a few encoders to change the video format but they say they can't recognize the video format. Is it corrupted files?

Thanks."

,Believer92,2011-03-08T00:54Z,"Thanks so much for sharing these, but I did have a question, if someone could please help me out:

Some of the files open as a ""Windows Live Movie Maker"" for me and I am unable to watch any of those episodes. If anyone know how to change this so the file opens to a video player or something I would reaaaaallly appreciate it!! I'm having so much trouble with it.

Once again, thanks youssef0eddoumali for taking the time to share!!"

,xzbear,2011-09-06T15:43Z,hey ive seen horriblesubs before and theres no subs so i was wondering are there on these vids? ive got the first 100 eps and now im curious dont wanna waste me time
,edale,2011-09-22T22:50Z,"Xzbear, horriblesubs has subs, if you're not seeing them you may need to update your codecs. Horriblesubs releases in MKV format (if it's not MKV, it's not horriblesubs' release) and some can't play all features of MKV even if they have codecs that play the video.

Try downloading CCCP: http://cccp-project.net/

CCCP, Combined-Comunity-Codec-Pack, is a codec pack designed to play any and all codecs used by the fansub community. I've yet to find a video, anime or not, that CCCP couldn't play.

Alternately, you could get MPC-HC (media player classic-home cinema), or VCL media player. Either of them should be able to play horriblesubs' releases. MPC-HC is optionally installed with CCCP."
