The legendary Bryan Ferry returns with his suave and sophisticated debut on Astralwerks Records, the brand new studio album Olympia (co-produced by Ferry and the legendary Rhett Davies). The album features musical contributions from Nile Rodgers, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, Groove Armada, Scissor Sisters, Marcus Miller, Flea, Mani (Primal Scream, ex Stone Roses) and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead. Olympia sees Bryan Ferry reunite on record with members of Roxy Music, including Brian Eno, Phil Manzanera, and Andy Mackay. This is the first album to reunite them since Roxy Music's seminal album For Your Pleasure in 1973!
This is quintessential Bryan Ferry at his suave, sophisticated best.
