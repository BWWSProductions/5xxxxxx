,sentient1,2010-10-19T20:30Z,"Dear Hellboy,

Could you please please please upload a 64 bit Biology trainer app, and a Chemistry one too if at all possible??

The only ones I can find on here or Demonoid are 32 bit.. 

Would appreciate so much, as it would help me with my environmental tech  program next summer. 

Cheers"
