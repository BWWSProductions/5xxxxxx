Huey Lewis and the News - Stuck With You [promo].VOB 



Very HQ rare promo music video. "Stuck with You" was filmed in the Bahamas 
and features Keely Shaye Smith. The island that Lewis and Smith wind up on 
is a small island about ten miles from Paradise Island in Nassau. The video 
was filmed on land, on water, underwater and from the air. The band, the 
crew and all the extras used in the island BBQ scene had to stay on a barge 
moored off the island so that they wouldn't be seen. This video was directed 
by Edd Griles and features the complete intro.
