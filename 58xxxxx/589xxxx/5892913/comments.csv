[T],PeteSapai,2010-11-01T22:20Z,"I reckon you got those track lengths from wikipedia? Since you mentioned _all_ other versions are missing a couple of seconds, amazon lists shorter lengths, all lengths on the streamable album on nme.com correspond to these mp3s and the length of ""Isolation"" on their myspace page is 4:13 (which is this Isolation's length rounded down), I'm guessing someone needs to update the wiki page. Anyway, even if the wiki lengths are the real lengths, the original cd contains 14 times 1 or 2 seconds of silence after each track, I doubt anyone will miss those ;)"
