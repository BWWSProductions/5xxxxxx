,Aruan Drako,2011-05-15T01:06Z,"Couldn't get it to install. =/

Got the latest daemon tool lite but didn't find this self assembly option in preferences.

I followed instructions but when I tried to install it, it crashes when installing the soundtrack part. I skip it and re-mount but it freezes at cab1. =/

Any idea, guys?"

if you have some troubles in install look to you're administrator rights, don't check all emulation options keep in default, make sure you DL the full ISO and scan if there no errors in the iso, make sure your PC is Stable (updates, antivirus is update & look if it not block certains softs etc...).

under vista there's somes crash due to....SP1 of vista, XP direct must be update or crash are possible, for seven some troubles in display with DX11, updates with last update of DX11.
for nvidia cards, disable physx
for ATi cards, tessellation: application settings
                    disable surface format optimisation
