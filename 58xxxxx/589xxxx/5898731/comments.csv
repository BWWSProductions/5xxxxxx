There are two torrents which replaced this one: ""eBooks on The Craft of Film"" and ""eBooks on The Craft of Animation"". They should be available by searching any of those tags above. I felt the other name for the torrents were two generic and blended with other torrents which the scope is not what I intended when I first uploaded this torrent. I created it by using a directory, each book should be available for downloaded individually. Books which are related to film studies were axed from those two torrents as I am preparing a folder specially created to carry e-books on that subject. Some were added, obviously. So try find those ""eBooks on the..."" to have access to the previous content."
