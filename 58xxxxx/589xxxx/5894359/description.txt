Thousands of years ago, Arceus came to Earth to retrieve the \\\"Jewel of Life\\\" that it had loaned to a man named Damos. Damos however betrayed Arceus and attacked it with a large army of Pokemon. After presumably killing Damos in its counterattack, Arceus went to sleep, vowing to judge all humans when it next returns.
