Sometimes it desynch with the video, but you can fix it by clickin the scan bar. I played it on divx updated with k-lite codecs, and also on my HDTV with USB, put it doesnt support the aac codec for mkvs :( PLEASE could you upload another one with the same video quality and codec but with a different audio codec???? I prefer dolbys AC3 5.1 I BEG YOU!!!! would be very thankful."
