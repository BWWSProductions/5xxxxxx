,xadious,2011-03-08T05:55Z,"Great quality rip and surprisingly small file size; thanks.

One thing i was very confused about was the text that would pop up in various places, such as the text the robots would show, or the captains screen, or the text around the ship, manual book etc, it was not English, it's Polish, confusing as the language spoken is English.

I downloaded another copy of the film and in the other copy all the text is in English. So i guess the ""texted language"" for this film is Polish (according to google translate).

Not a major issue, but it was very confusing when the language would pop up in various places and i'd have no clue what it was saying."
,rocky619,2011-04-24T04:57Z,very good stuff!! thanks a lot for small sized good quality video!!
,Master2873,2011-10-19T19:32Z,Why would you remove the end credits? That's idotic. Let alone that the end credits had to do with the story a tiny bit. It was more of a conclusion. Also Removing the end credits to me makes it no longer a Bluray rip as its been altered...
