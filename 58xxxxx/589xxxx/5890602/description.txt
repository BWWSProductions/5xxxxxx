           Sculpture is a psychological horror gore-fest that tells       
           the story of Ashley Steele, an aspiring artist who             
           returns home after the death of her father only to find        
           the haunting memories of her repressed childhood await         
           her. She is commissioned to create a life-size sculpture       
           of the perfect man, and uses body builders from her            
           brother's gym as models, but soon finds herself spiraling      
           down a path of unspeakable psychopathic terror and murder      
           as she frantically tries to complete her masterpiece.
