Also, in Windows 7, you can't turn it off just by turning the levels all the way down. To completely disable it:

1. Run Registry Editor (RegEdit) by typing regedit at command prompt or at startmenu->run

2. Locate following registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System

3. Locate the following REG_DWORD value:
EnableLUA

Yes my AV did catch the 2 patches as viruses, but I assure you that they are not.  If you have installed any version of Sony Vegas Pro before, and the installation interface looks different, that is normal I guess.  After you type in your Serial Key, you might see something saying type in your upgrade key.  Just type in either the default key that you get from the keygen, or the one tat you changed the first 3 digits 1R8.  I was sceptable when I saw it too, and same thing when it says register later instead of register form another computer.  Just click register later.  Make sure you read the instructions very carefully.  The first patch you use when you have to browse to the the Sony Vegas Pro 10 dir, you only have to browse to that one only.  You don't have to browse to the shared - plugins dir, it already patches them.  Just make sure you read the instruction very carefully.

Interestingly enough, when I tried that portable version I saw mentioned here, it worked just fine (but I'd rather have the whole thing, I'm dumb and I need my help files and whatnot :P) and my eyebrows are still on the back of my neck. I mean wtf this doesn't make any sense or its just my blissful ignorance. :P

Could you tell me how to fix this? I'd really appriciate some help with this, I don't want to be left at the mercy of Windows Movie Maker... ;_;"

I really don't know why people still download this, since the installing process really is complicated shit!!!

And I have better things to do than take each one by the hand and guide him through - that's why I included instructions!

So I provide you with links to my dear colleagues, who provide high quality software uploads on a regular basis:

https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6131907/Sony_Vegas_PRO_10.0c_Keygen%28x86x64%29%28Registered%29_%5B_kk_%5D
and Chris-Aksel:
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6206717/Sony_Vegas_Pro_10_x86-x64_Cracked-TL

The torrents are well seeded and work perfectly!

And @Khorothis:
>My poor little laptop has some good old Windows XP on it and when I start the installer (the very first one) it says its not a Win32 application and shits in my face.<
64 bit applications tend to do this when you try to install them on 32 bit systems ;)!
>Could you tell me how to fix this?<
Buy yourself a new 64 bit Laptop or try the 32 bit version of the program ;)...
Cheers"

An Error has occurred while patching the file(s)!


And nothing happens. I used Administrative Permissions, got Disconnected and everything.

Windows 7 Ultimate (64bit)"
,ltsurge695,2011-06-09T10:07Z,"Alright, I fixed the issue. Apparently I failed to actually assign all Permissions to the files :L


Everything seems to be working well aside from two glaring problems that I have no idea how to fix.

When I Import MPEG-2 files, the audio track is strange. I can hear Background Music and random sound effects but I can't hear dialogue.

I read somewhere that you'd need to download an Update from Sony for that, but I'm not very interested in drawing attention to myself on their site.

Also, when I installed the DivX .avi codecs, it still didn't Import any .avi files properly. Either it was an Empty Track or the Media was denied.

Anyone know a solution that doesn't involve going to the official site?"

This is the first torrent for any vegas pro product that has ever worked for me and ive been trying for days =P Thanks a lot
Just follow the instructions and it'll work"
,crimson85067,2011-09-21T07:58Z,"Why upload something with such instructions when there are simpler torrent already out there? 
and no ur serials dont work, if we all did something wrong it is because you made it so confusing"
