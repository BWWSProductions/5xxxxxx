[V],HolyRoses,2010-10-31T21:56Z,"toolchain refers to underlying components.  mkv, a52dec, dtsdec, ffmpeg and friends.  links to items needed are in thread, even a static linked ffmpeg (for linux)"

For some reason I thought you were gone.  Now, I see you're back; more appropriately, never left.

Love to see you on the scene.  Thank you for all your hard work.

Also, people refer to you as a lady.  Is this right? Is you is or is you aint a lady? Not that it matters, just nice to see the fairer sex power-housing on thepiratebay."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-17T03:23Z,"I left the scene many years ago.  Lots of pressure in the scene that I don't have the desire to deal with anymore.

Cheers though, enjoy the fine releases :-)
