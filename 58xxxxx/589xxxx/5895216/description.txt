                    The atmospheric three-part crime drama set in  
                    London's East End continues. Miles learns that  
                    a criminal called Billy Bunhill has been shot  
                    inside another notorious Kray haunt, The Blind  
                    Beggar pub. Chandler's interest is piqued when  
                    he realises that the murder mirrors George  
                    Cornell's killing by Ronnie Kray in 1966. Who  
                    could possibly be trading off the ghosts of the  
                    Krays and using their legend to invoke fear and  
                    paranoia on the streets of Whitechapel? When  
                    the threats become personal and the killer  
                    seems to be one step ahead, Chandler and Miles  
                    have to wonder just how far the murderer's  
                    power reaches.
