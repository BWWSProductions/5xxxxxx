,RedBaron888,2010-10-20T22:30Z,"Thank you Wildcatfan, TPB. L.A. LAW is the most authentic legal drama based upon the Criminal Justice system in California.
Amongst the advanced nations, the Judicial SYstem of the United States of America is the best that humanity can expect.
The trial by jury, long rooted the Magna Carta of England, has evolved to the fullest in America. Contrary to the code law countries such as France, Germany, or worse Japan, the nations where jury system is employed has guarantee of the citizenry's participation in the fundamental process that keeps society just, the judicial system.
Japan, where the police has unlimited period of detention of suspects, where self-confession alone is necessary to send a suspct to a gallow, is an apostate of G7 nations. Japan deserve no seat at UN whotsoever. Japanese schools must show L.A. LAW to all pupils to hammer in the sense of Civic duty and glory of the English legal system. Also, Americans must return to the Founding Fathers and their writings to understand, the enlighted and well informed citizenry is the key to protect Majestic republic, a hope for all humanity. Jury system is the last defence against tyranny. After watching L.A. LAW, it is strongly recommended to start reading Bastiat, John Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau and the writings the Founding Fathers'.
The Pirate Bay, by providing the podium for free exchange of knowledge, is rightly the Defender of Freedom. Wildcatfan, true and loyal American, may Creator bless you and your family and descendants.
All viewers of L.A. LAW, be strive to be the best citizens of the respective nations by disseminating the knowledge.
Thank you and may the Universe protect Freedom."
