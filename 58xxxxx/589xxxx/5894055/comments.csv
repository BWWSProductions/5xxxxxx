,notdone23,2010-10-18T16:28Z,"Charlie Valentine is a self absorbed and aging gangster, with a wealth of knowledge concerning the lifestyle. He searches out the son he vaguely remembers and takes advantage of the young man's desire for a father and son relationship. Don't get the mistaken idea this is a family melodrama, Charlie Valentine is a gangster film thru and thru.

While big studios put much money, star power, and effort into making standard quality gangster films like Public Enemies and American Gangster, along comes an unassuming writer/director named Jesse Johnson who, with a fraction of the time schedule and budget, makes producing a quality crime film look as easy as a ringin' a bell. Interesting three dimensional characters, solid pacing, smart dialog, skilled cinematography, well staged and believable action, these are just a few of the elements that make this an above average project. These days plenty of films sport an entire cast made up of familiar faces with name recognition, but making proper use of the talent is another matter altogether. No such problem with Charlie Valentine, as it uses it's cast to great effect. Raymond J. Barry as the titular Valentine is excellent and Michael Weatherly compliments him well, meanwhile veteran actors like Steven Bauer, James Russo, Keith David, Vernon Wells, and Tom Berenger, all step up to the plate and deliver the cinematic goods. Is this on par with the best of Scorcese or Bogart? No, though that's a very short list, but Charlie Valentine easily rises above many of it's gangster film contemporaries."
