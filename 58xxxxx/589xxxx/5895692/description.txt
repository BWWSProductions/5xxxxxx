Synopsis:

You walk into the cage and the floor pulses with the energy of the arena. Sweat drips down your brow as you step out to the center. The bell rings and the match begins. While sizing up your opponent, you find the weakness youâ€™ve been searching for. A hook comes from your left and you dodge at the last possible moment. You feel a breeze as his fist barely misses your nose, and you counter with a devastating right uppercut â€” striking him squarely in the jaw. His head jerks back in a violent motion, spraying sweat into the air before he falls backward to the mat. While you prepare to make your opponent submit, the referee calls it a knockout and the crowd erupts. This is the world of mixed martial arts â€” are you ready to fight?
