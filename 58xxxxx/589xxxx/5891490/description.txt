"In Re: Tracy Vidalin"  

Garza (Jimmy Smits) has to put personal 
differences aside when the daughter of 
his nemesis, Senator Sidney Vidalin 
(Richard Portnow), is unexpectedly 
charged with a murder that was 
committed by her boyfriend. The only 
thing that stands in Garza and Al's 
(David Ramsey) way is a confession, 
which might just be the result of a 
Miranda rights violation. Meanwhile, 
Eddie (Jesse Bradford) and Mereta 
(Ellen Woglom) dig into Lucinda's 
(Carly Pope) past and make a shocking 
discovery.

Enjoy :)
