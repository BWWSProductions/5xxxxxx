Some beatiful songs of Rabindranath by Subhamita Chatterjee. A sublime journey of music and philosophy. You would love to be a Bengalee if you are not after immersing yourself in this sea of tunes by the greatest poet of any time and by a singer, of the modern times, whom you will be seeking ever after.
