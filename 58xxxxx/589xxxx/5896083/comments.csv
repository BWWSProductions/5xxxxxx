,Shade_Michael,2010-10-24T05:42Z,"Maybe when people put DvDrip its because they recieved the file via disc and ripped the DvD to upload it? Who cares in the end, if your gonnas comment, comment on quality and dont waste people time with your bull, and maybe thank the uploader for the free movie??assholes. Thx Hero_No_1
