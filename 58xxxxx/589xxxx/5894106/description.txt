U2 - Vertigo [promo].VOB



HQ promo Music video. The video for the song features U2 performing in a 
featureless desert as black jet streams emit from behind each band member; 
on the ground is a huge white bulls-eye symbol used as a motif for the album 
graphics. The circular platform that the band performs on constantly elevates 
up and down in a spiral pattern, as the wind blows in the band's face. 
This promo video was directed by the team of Alex & Martin, 
and was recorded in Spain, in the Natural Park of Delta del Ebro.
