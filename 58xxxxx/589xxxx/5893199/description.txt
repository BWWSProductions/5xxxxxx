Dermot O'Leary announces the results of another double elimination. Fourteen becomes 12 as the act with the fewest votes is out immediately, and then the next two compete in a sing-off, hoping to win a reprieve from judges Simon Cowell, Cheryl Cole, Louis Walsh and Dannii Minogue. There are also performances by Katy Perry and Diana Vickers.
