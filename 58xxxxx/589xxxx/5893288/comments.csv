Hey nedamgol - are you able to seed any of the S01 of X Factor please?  I see that you did get them originally earlier in the year. 

We are stuck on S01E13 Performances (file is named Results incorrectly), S01E14 Performances and S01E16 Final?  Also need a fresh upload of S01E13 Results (the real one ;) if you can help?"

(but please I'm craving for thextra factor, too)"
,nedamgol,2010-10-18T16:02Z,"@ asighkick

sorry i had to move them from my computer
but i had idea about putting all my downloaded
seasons in one torrent if verovenlo likes that :)"
,asighkick,2010-10-19T12:57Z,"@nedamgol

Figure that there is no harm re-uploading X Factor but would suggest that you stick to one season (series) in one torrent rather than make a humongous file of everything.

If you find the time, please do consider just reseeding those three S01 X Factors plus the one fresh upload or simply upload them all fresh, whichever is easiest.

Please leave me a note if you choose to make fresh uploads.

Thanks from NZ"
