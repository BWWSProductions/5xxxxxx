,fanbayfan1,2010-10-16T22:10Z,Is there any chance you can upload Apocalypse Now - the original theatrical cut (in 720p). It's shorter than the Redux version. In my humble opinion I rate it better that the extended version.
,SynapsisXXXX,2010-10-20T05:21Z,thanx a lot neonrainbow... Could you please upload Back To The Future Trilogy BRRips?
,wants_to_be_free,2010-10-23T18:47Z,"I also liked the original version better, and didn't like the ""Redux"" version as much.  The Redux version added a lot of scenes that were cut from the original for a reason, and I felt like many of those scenes just didn't fit into the movie and make it confusing at times.  If it's your first time watching this movie, get a copy of the original and watch that first."

,osriccc,2011-01-09T17:32Z,"Jacob, if you're talking about subs, yes, some of them are out of sync, but you can get others easily, they're .SRT files... Otherwise, the movie is PERFECTLY ripped. I was going to bitch about the credits being cut of but this version of the movie (Blu ray) only ends with ""2000 ZOETROPE COMPANY"" or stuff and fades to black forever. Great, best rip of REDUX out there... And yes, I like the original 100% more but there are no good rips as this one at a reasonable file size."
