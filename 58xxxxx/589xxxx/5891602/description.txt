Dragon Ball Z: Tenkaichi Tag Team

Tested and working on PSP-1000 (5.50 GEN-D3) and PSP-2000 (5.50 GEN-D3).

Unpacked filesize: 1.17 GB

Instructions:

Extract game-iso from archive to ISO directory on your Memory Stick. This can be done using WinRAR or Total Commander.

Game is claimed to work better with UMD ISO Mode: M33, but it worked for me fine on both - Sony NP9660 and M33.

And remember these files are for the custom firmwares ONLY!

Enjoy & Have fun! :)
