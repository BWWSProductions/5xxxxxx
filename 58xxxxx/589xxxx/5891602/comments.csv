,JIHUIN,2010-10-17T11:30Z,Thanks a lot...perfectly working in CFW 5.50GEN-B full and CFW 5.50 GEN-D3...take note also that when playing this game you need to disable the KHBBS plugin otherwise the game will not run.

,Naturalrice,2010-10-17T20:12Z,Not working... My Compressed and Untouched ISO are both stuck on the Black Screen after New Game/Load Game
,SageSix,2010-10-17T20:18Z,it doesn't work for me after I try loading my savedata
,JIHUIN,2010-10-18T01:31Z,"@ Naturalrice & SageSix:
Try to disable all your plugins first and then run this game. And then one by one you enable again your plugins to check which of the plugins are causing the game to hang.

In my PSP I have CXMB plugins, CWCHEAT, KHBBS, POPSLOADER, Screenshot plugins, and I found out that KHBBS is  causing the problem."
,blazin1279,2010-10-18T01:50Z,I disabled KHBBS plugin and it just stalls after the load game screen. I am using rhe PSP-1000  (5.50 Gen D3) I already have it in UMD ISO mode: M33. I also tried the other modes still wont start up please help
,JIHUIN,2010-10-18T02:32Z,"@blazin1279:
If you already disable all your plugins and tried both M33 and Sony NP9660 and yet the game stalls at the load game screen, then I suspect your memory stick has either a bad sector or corrupted portion that's why the game is stopping at loading portion...I suggest try different memory stick or borrow one from your friends, or try reformatting your memory stick and see if this solve your problem."
,wiakai,2010-10-18T12:57Z,"@blazin1279 
same prob as blazin, reformatted memorystick, still gets stuck at loading"
,wiakai,2010-10-18T14:53Z,oh found something http://www.ffinsider.net/psp-iso/dragon-ball-z-tenkaichi-tag-team-usa.html check the comments guys
,entona9,2010-10-20T09:25Z,it crashes when i use goku 3 in training with dragon fist skill.. and on story mode when i'm about to fight raditz henchmen.. im using gen-d3 psp paht.. help pls :(
,owen-e,2010-10-20T14:00Z,i thought that this game was in japanese only
,JIHUIN,2010-10-20T14:58Z,"My four kids already played this game smoothly without encountering any loading or crashing problem. Two of them are using 5.50 GEN-B (full) and the other two are using 5.50 GEN-D3.  I only disable the KHBBS plugin to run the game. 

I also read in other website that you need to set the CPU clock to 222/111 to run the game smoothly. But I think it is not related to the reported problem.

I suspect that there might be a compatibility issue with the Memory stick to run this game. I'm using 4GB Sony Pro Duo memory stick. Why don't give a try to use other memory stick or borrow from friends and see if there is a problem."
,cheeku41,2010-10-21T12:50Z,hey change mode to sony np9660 it will work fo me

,NitrogenUA,2010-11-02T09:05Z,"killua-uchiha, I personaly use the good old cdvd_iml2iso, but you can also use UMDGen or lot of other software. I belive, ISO Tool can convert images right on your console."

,1PotH3Ad,2011-02-20T17:11Z,"This game runs perfect on 6.35 PRO A-3 on my PSP-3001.

Btw, the game I have is 659 MB's, I wonder why its smaller, its an .iso."
,1PotH3Ad,2011-03-20T01:06Z,I recommend updating to 6.35 and installing 6.35 PRO-x. It has great ISO and PSX compability. There is not one game that hasn't worked with it.
