Saban Bajramovic - Discography 
MP3 Various bitrates

This torrent has been about a month in the making. I\'ve scrounged libraries, friends collections, end the entire internets, for everything Saban. Unfortunately, lots of singles, ep\'s and other stuff is unobtainable where I\'m at. Nevertheless, this is quite an impressive collection of Saban\'s music spanning almost 40 years of recording.

As a composer, Saban Bajramovic is probably the most played / copied / imitated within the balkan/gypsy genre. A couple of examples of his musical wit are \'Djelem Djelem\' - the international gypsy hymn, and \'Mesecina\' - made famous by Emir Kustorica and goran Bregovic in the movie \'Underground\'.

As a singer / performer he represents the apotheosis of eastern european gypsy singing. Indeed, he has been dubbed \'The king of the serbian Gypsies\'.

Stylistically, although the folkloric roots and traditions of the roma people are strong and evident, he has never contented himself within the boundaries of tradition. He has played around with almost every genre from jazz, over flamenco and latin to techno and trip hop.

I\'ve structured this torrent in 5 categories:
1: Albums - Meaning regular releases. Some are collaborations with other artists and feature tracks without Saban.
2: Compilations - There has been released a horde of licensed and unlicensed compilations, especially after his death in 2008. Although they contain a lot of dupes, I\'ve included all I could find for the sake of collectors satisfaction.
3: Singles - Just a small handfull of seventies releases I was lucky enough to track down.
4: Outtakes - Guest appearances on other artists albums.
5: Live - I\'m paricularly proud of the romano raj tour \'album\', I managed to rip the audio from a defunct mpg file, and remaster it. If you want to give the video a try (wont play) here it is:
