This Works I tested it.


Mount disks with Demon Tools

Start With disk 1 and when the installer loads click Full Installation and cheeck that its in the language that you want.

When it asks you for disk 2, mount disk 2 Then continue


WHen Its done, You can play it And it wont bwe the demo
