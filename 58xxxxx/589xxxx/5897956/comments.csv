LOS ANGELES â€“ After six days of deliberations, the jury in the Anna Nicole Smith drug conspiracy case went home Tuesday without sending word if they are close to returning verdicts in the complex trial.

The panel is working to reach 21 separate decisions in the case of Smith's lawyer-boyfriend, Howard K. Stern, and Doctors Sandeep Kapoor and Khristine Eroshevich. While the criminal complaint contains 11 charges, each defendant is charged with some but not all of the counts. There are multiple charges against each defendant, and if any one of them is found guilty of a conspiracy count, the jury must answer a list of questions saying what it believes they conspired to do.

At the end of Tuesday's session, the jury had been talking for 30 hours.

Prosecutors have accused the three defendants of feeding the former Playboy model's addiction to prescription drugs by excessively providing her with sedatives and opiates. The defense said the three were trying to bring Smith relief from constant pain. The defendants are not charged in her 2007 overdose death.

The jury was to continue deliberating Wednesday."

,hkoraddi,2010-10-20T10:21Z,are u doing step up 3 R6
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-20T10:49Z,@hkoraddi: I have lot of bad experiences with R6 sources. Really bad. Therefore - I would not make Step up 3 - in-fact - I have decided like week ago to step-over Step-up altogether. Sorry.
,hunt_0710,2010-10-20T11:00Z,"I dont need iPod compatibility..... I dont have one.....  i'll play it on my PC.... all i need is a small size, i can download with my 15 kbps speed...."
,hkoraddi,2010-10-20T11:22Z,its ok never a problem
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-20T11:48Z,"@hunt_0710: OK then, as soon as possible, this week for sure (most likely Sunday).
Visit regularly, because I cannot seed more than a day long."
,hunt_0710,2010-10-20T15:17Z,Thanx a lot.... I'll keep checking for it... and i hope it completes in a day..... :)
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-20T15:31Z,"@hunt_0710: Not having myself as seeder doesn't  mean much to you - my upload speed is currently 24100 kB/s, but - small movies attract lot of people who stays as seeder - zero seconds.  

Keeping in mind their practically nonexistent upload capabilities - often people who came just 48h later finishes download - never. Stay stuck forever, simply because other comrades left them behind, showing no solidarity.

What I meant - keep checking - not to pay a visit next week just to see dead torrent."
,hunt_0710,2010-10-20T16:06Z,"Dont worry i'll check daily... and even with this kind speed, my seed ratio is always more than 1.5...."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-20T20:52Z,"@hunt_0710: It would be approx. 1 GB. With your speed (don't worry, I had dial-up till six years ago and know how I felt, downloading one movie five days on line which broke like gazillion times) you'll need 'bout 28 hours for download - but it's better to start when up is fresh - chances are that one could have more comrades right then, than two-three days later..."
