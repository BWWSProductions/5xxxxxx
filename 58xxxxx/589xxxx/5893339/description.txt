This is Meet the Natives, both the season made in England and the season made in USA.

The US version is unfortunately a rip from online streams, the only release that seems to exist of that whole season. Still, this series is an experience of other cultures, like no other, so episode quality is the least thing you will focus on.


Hope you enjoy, and please keep on seeding, I can't seed this for too long. Cheers!
