"No Ordinary Vigilante"

While patrolling the park at night in an effort to 
catch a mugger, Jim is mistaken for a murderous 
vigilante who has begun targeting the robbers; 
Stephanie makes a discovery that could explain 
how she and her family got their powers; Daphne 
uses her telepathic abilities to get into an 
exclusive party reserved for only the cool high 
school kids; and JJ tries out for the football 
team - with a lot of help from his powers.

Enjoy :)
