[V],prashant22,2010-10-19T19:22Z,welcome guys...only u 2 people say thanks for almost every release of mine...thanks for that...
[V],prashant22,2010-10-19T20:08Z,also their's prank 2...
,DSIN,2010-10-19T20:55Z,"@prashant : yeah dude... it pisses me off wen ppl dload something & don't even bother thanking the uploader...
i mean it takes hrs to encode & upload something & only few seconds to say thanx... 
i just don't get it... :@"
[V],prashant22,2010-10-19T21:21Z,"@DSIN
correct...it takes almost a day to download a movie.. sometimes 2 days also...
nd abt 12-18 hrs to encode depending on lenght of movie...
n 1-2 hr time goes in making sample, updating the description, uploading screen shots n then uploading the torrent...

all people hv do is just say thanks or comment on quality if they like it...or can just give a +1...
bt no one does that expect for few....

as a uploader i just wait for comments..u really want to know that people like ur work...
some people dont even say thanks if their requests r done..like some 'st1998' requested robin hood men in tights..'fuckerr' requested daredevil...these guys didnt even cared to say thanks even for their requests....it really hurts...

bt u n some people like u keeps me going..."
