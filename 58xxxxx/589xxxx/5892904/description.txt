Description

Plot Summary: Tulay, whose unhappy marriage is disintegrating, lives in a modern apartment complex. Halet, an employee of the complex, spies on Tulay and watches her every move. One evening, when Tulay returns home, she witnesses her maid Asli and Halet making love in her bed. This moment would be the beginning of an unconscious search for Tulay, whose daily life gradually mixes with her perceptions and fears.

Directorâ€™s Statement: I wrote most of the script in Atakoy. Since I grew up in the outskirts of Atakoy, I knew that Atakoy meant for us, for the people there. This was why I considered it to be the place for that lost person. About a month before I shot Block-C, we drove on a highway to go to a site for the film in which I had been the assistant director. All of these blocks were more visible from the highway. I really should not only say â€œblocks.â€ It was about telling the story of the highways, a newly organized life style, cars and those isolated people. The blocks gave me a feeling of cinema. This, of course, is a sense that changes with peopleâ€™s tendencies and what they are affected from; it is possible that the same thing would not mean anything for someone else. This is about everyoneâ€™s own inner self and maturity. I felt that â€œthingâ€; there was no story yet. This is the characteristic of Block-C: it didnâ€™t have a story in the classical sense. The film has a metaphysical side to it. It is a film, which has scenes about situations and moments.
