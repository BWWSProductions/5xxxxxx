,trxxxpr,2011-02-25T20:11Z,"Maybe this was too good to be true. I found that some tracks had more than one song on it and non complete. Not sure parts are even ZZ. I don't think that whoever compiled this diskography actually edited what they were recording. Great idea though, just needs to be cleaned up tks anyway for all your work "

But hard to find complete tracks. "
,trxxxpr,2011-02-25T20:17Z,"Great idea, but not all tracks are complete. Some have parts of 2 or more tunes. I don't think these tracks were edited before offered.
Tks anyway, lot of work here. "
,MPAAss,2011-08-06T22:11Z,"Anyone else find the tracks to be incomplete?

Is the Chrome Smoke and BBQ album full?"
