,megamanrulesall,2010-12-24T06:32Z,"how do I use magnet link? Firefox gets the following message:

firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (magnet) isn't associated with any program.

When I go into the Tools > Options >applications, there is nothing as far as I can tell which would allow me to set that.

Can anyone help me out?"
