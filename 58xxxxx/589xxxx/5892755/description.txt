Three - an evolving band
In April 2001, the band released Three which was the first album recorded as a full band and moved to Melbourne to promote the record on the east coast. Three stayed in the Australian alternative charts for nine months reaching as high as #3 which was an outstanding success for an independent band. The album won an ARIA award for Best Independent Release, and first single Betterman came in at #5 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2001. It hit number 24 on the ARIA Charts.

Gavin Shoesmith left the band to form his own band The Groovesmiths. The band replaced him with 19-year-old Rory Quirk, who toured with the band on their first tour of the U.S. in 2001. Rory Quirk in turn left the band in 2002 to pursue a career with his band Quirk. Andrew Fry joined the band as the new bass player.

The success of Three led to its release in the U.S. in 2002 and two tours of the U.S. followed. The band supported the Dave Matthews Band and John Mayer as well as playing at the Bonnaroo Music Festival and the South by Southwest Festival. The band also played at the Splendour in the Grass Festival in Australia
