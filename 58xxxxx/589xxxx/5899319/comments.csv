,moshster,2010-10-21T23:25Z,"Er...someone who can plug their iPod into a larger screen for playback perhaps?  I can play a HD file on my HTC Desire HD via HDMI to a 50"" plasma."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-10-22T01:50Z,new ipods have pretty high res displays as well.  maybe this guy has a 64gb touch too.  Have to use the storage somehow.
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-22T02:58Z,wow u guys have no sense of humour... lol
[V],HolyRoses,2010-10-22T05:59Z,whats the joke?  i see no funny.
,asdfgwer,2010-10-22T09:20Z,"ur right HR...
i have a 64 GB itouch....
though i rarely use HD ones as they occupy space, just thought u could just add it to the list of supported. u have written iphone and that has even less storage than the itouch."
[T],on.off.on,2010-10-22T13:38Z,the joke was that just 5 years ago it was impossible to put these big files on a portable device. time flies....
