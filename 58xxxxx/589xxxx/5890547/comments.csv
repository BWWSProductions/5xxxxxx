,noparlpf,2010-11-26T03:29Z,"I'm not getting English audio, and the subtitles don't seem to be working. Is there something I can do to fix that? I'm using the latest Media Player Classic."
,noparlpf,2010-11-26T03:43Z,"Actually, now the English is working, but it skips a second every few seconds. And which file is the Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon? This is confusing."
