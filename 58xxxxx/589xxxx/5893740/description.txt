         Hailed as "one of the most engaging American bands of         
         the past decade" (The Phoenix) by critics and fans, Spoon     
         returns to Austin City Limits for their third turn on the     
         stage with a new album that "strikes a balance between its    
         early angsty indie-rock and the soulful deconstructed pop     
          of its 2007 release, Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga".
