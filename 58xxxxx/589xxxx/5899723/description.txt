Biography by John Bush allmusic.com

Though many remember only their 1967 hit, "Happy Together," the 
Turtles were one of the more enjoyable American pop groups of the 
'60s, moving from folk-rock inspired by the Byrds to a sparkling 
fusion of Zombies-inspired chamber pop and straight-ahead, good-time 
pop reminiscent of the Lovin' Spoonful, the whole infused with 
beautiful vocal harmonies courtesy of dual frontmen Howard Kaylan and 
Mark Volman. Though they hit number one in 1967 with the infectious 
"Happy Together," the Turtles scored only three more Top Ten hits and 
broke up by the end of the '60s. Kaylan and Volman later joined Frank 
Zappa's Mothers of Invention during the early '70s and also recorded 
themselves as Flo & Eddie, but were on the oldies circuit with a 
revamped Turtles by the mid-'80s.
