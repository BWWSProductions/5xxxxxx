,Jason Scott,2010-10-17T03:16Z,"Hello, everyone. Jason Scott, director of this film.

I'm sorry people haven't heard of my film - I'll endeavor to make more noise about it in the future. I'm very proud of it.

However, the release has an issue where it plays the movie out of order and leaves some portions out. I've written a weblog entry about it here:

Thanks to everyone who has written to me to say they enjoyed the film, and to the over 2300 people who bought the DVD so far."
