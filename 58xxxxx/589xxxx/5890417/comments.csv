I posted a legitimate and necessary comment about this torrent yesterday, mentioning that my Anti-Virus is repeatedly flagging it as infected with a specific malware, and asked if anyone else here could confirm if this file is actually clean, or if it is really infected. 

Then today that comment just mysteriously has been deleted, no evidence it was ever posted. Are we not allowed to be concerned that a file here might contain a virus/ trojan/malware?
I am not a troll,  I am sincerely asking if this item is indeed infected or not. No one replies, but my comment is deleted. Are posts such as this against site rules? I thought it was okay, even recommended, to be on guard for viruses, etc. An honest reply to this query would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
