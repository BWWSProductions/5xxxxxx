Burning Heads is a melodic hardcore punk rock band from Orleans, France. The group formed in the late '80s, and started out releasing records independently before signing with Play It Again Sam in 1994. They became more popular in America with the release of their 1998 record, Be One with the Flames, on Epitaph Records, and 1999's Escape, on Victory Records. Later releases came out on Yelen Musiques, a label of Columbia Records wich is a trademark of Sony Music Entertainment, and Opposite Records.

--short bio:
The town of Orleans, France, is an unlikely find for New York-style hardcore or aggressive punk, but Burning Heads somehow emerged from this area upon their 1988 formation. With the lineup consisting of Phil (guitar/vocals), DJ TDK (drums/vocals), JYB (bass/vocals), and P. Samprass (guitar/vocals), Sematary Records would be responsible for Burning Heads' first two releases (a 1991 self-titled EP and 1993 self-titled album) before signing to Play It Again Sam Records in 1994. Following the full-length releases of 1994's Dive, 1996's Super Modern World, and the European distribution through the 1998 Epitaph Records-funded Be One With the Flames, Burning Heads would eventually find an audience in the states the next year. Thanks to a deal with Chicago's Victory Records, the band's fifth album Escape came out in late 1999.
