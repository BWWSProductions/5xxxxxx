The Pretenders Greatest Hits captures the band from their early days on Sire through their last album on Warner Bros. Records, Viva El Amor. It's the band's only career-spanning video collection, featuring such early nuggets as "Brass in Pocket," "Kid," and Stop Your sobbing," through "Don't Get Me Wrong" to a Tin Tin Out remix of "Human" from Viva El Amor. Also included is an excellent 45-minute documentary called No Turn Left Unstoned, with interviews from Chrissie Hynde, Nick Lowe, U2's Bono, Kate Pierson of the B-52's, Motorhead's Lemmy, and video director Don Letts.
