,vavas_98,2011-01-16T01:45Z,this is not even a RIP!!!
,dinosaur58,2011-03-07T14:15Z,"Rip/Not Rip? Cropped? [1.77 vs 2.35]. It's still a nice copy. Good quality for this level of compression. I think the other 2 commentors may not know what they're talking about.
Video 1280x720, H264 
Audio AAC 5.1 channel"

,bsjmohawk,2011-09-04T03:12Z,"How do you get the subtitles to work? I installed klite x64 codec pack, made sure the subtitle options were enabled in it's installation, and made sure the .srt file was named the same as the video file, but windows media player still wont work, and yes I have it's subtitle options set to ""on if available""."
