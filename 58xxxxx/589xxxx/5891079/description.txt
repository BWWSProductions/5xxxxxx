Life for 17-year-old Konno Makoto is filled with fun days of school and hanging out with her two best friends, Chiaki and Kousuke. And then she finds herself with a strange ability to leap (or jump) back in time. A strange ability that at first saves her life, but then allows her to not be late to school, to know the answers on any surprise exams and to avoid any troublesome mishaps. It is only when Makoto chooses to use this ability to avoid some of the more personal issues that arise with her friends, do events become both complex and painfully difficult - the simple gift that she once took for granted suddenly becomes a troublesome burden.
