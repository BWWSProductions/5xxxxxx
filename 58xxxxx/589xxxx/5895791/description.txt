 Description:
 Horizon explores the strange and wonderful world of illusions - and reveals   
 the tricks they play on our senses and why they fool us.                      
                                                                               
 We show how easy it is to trick your sense of taste by changing the colours of
 food and drink, explain how what you see can change what you hear, and see    
 just how unreliable our sense of colour can be.                               
                                                                               
 But all this trickery has a serious purpose. It's helping scientists to create
 a new understanding of how our senses work - not as individual senses, but    
 connected together.                                                           
                                                                               
 It holds the intriguing possibility that one sense could be mapped into       
 another. This is what happened to Daniel Kish, who lost his sight as a child. 
 He is now able to create a vision of the world by clicking his tongue which   
 allows him to echolocate like a bat.                                          
                                                                               
 And in a series of MRI scans, scientists are now looking to find out if       
 Daniel's brain may have actually rewired itself enabling him to use sound to  
 create a visual image of the world.                                           

                                Enjoy!
