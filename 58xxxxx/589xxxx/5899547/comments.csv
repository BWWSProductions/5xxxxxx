,LightTheRebellion,2010-11-03T07:41Z,"""great parody. inception really is a pretty stupid movie.""

I might have to reconsider my opinion based on Robojto's harsh words. The way he fails to use any capitalization whatsoever and his convincing, ""almost-committed"" analysis makes me think that he has some sort of certification in stupidity and is capable of detecting its presence almost immediately."
