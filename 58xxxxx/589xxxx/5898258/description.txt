The Great AIDS Debate (1994)

40 min documentary/ Debate

Is HIV really the cause of AIDS? What is "AIDS"? What is "HIV"? This is a controversial discussion about HIV/AIDS. There are 4 parts, I cut out ca. 30 minutes: http://www.youtube.com/results?search... The entire debate is at: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8226667729907633541 More videos can be found here: http://www.immunity.org.uk/ Donations to IRF are welcome. Participants are: Joan Shenton Peter Duesberg Richard Horton Mark Kaplan Frederick Siegal Steven Jonas Robert Garry James Scutero and Dara Welles It is important to note that this debate has been completely ignored back then. Of course some things have changed but the most important questions are still not resolved and nowadays it isn't even being debated. For more information please visit: http://www.RethinkingAIDS.com And this is the Bio/Technology paper about the "HIV tests" mentioned by James Scutero: http://www.reviewingaids.com/awiki/in... This paper has been ignored to this day and it still is relevant.
