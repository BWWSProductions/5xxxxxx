,tanyajs,2011-06-21T15:27Z,"Pease help!  I understand how to do the install, the problem is the crack folder. Both the install.txt and the two license (.dat) files are corrupted / encoded / encrypted.  They are not text files (they should be).  The actual install files are working. I have noticed that other people had the same problem, but I don't know how they solved it.  I have exactly the same problem trying to install 2009b and 2011a.  What am I (and other people) doing wrong?  Why some people see text files while others get binary garbage?  Is it some kind of character encoding or somethink completely stupid that I am missing?  "
