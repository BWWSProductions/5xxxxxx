,macreli,2010-10-21T02:33Z,same here. impossible to start the app.
,ryankentp,2010-11-07T04:41Z,"This torrent is great, it just takes a little to fix it. I made the following solution.

1. Move/copy to /Applications/ScreenFlow.app
2. Open Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)
3. Copy and paste the really long line below, then press enter.
4. It should ask for your password. Type it, then press enter. (It will look like you aren't typing it, but you really are.)
5. Try opening the application. If everything went right, it should open fine. You can quit terminal.

This is what you need to copy and paste (it's all one line):

,Mrshll187,2010-11-21T06:57Z,make it short and sweet: chmod -R 777 ScreenFlow.app/ depending on how your systems rolled out just tighten up the permissions. But this will work
,paliometoxo,2010-11-27T00:18Z,thnx Mrshll187 that worked nicely :D
,a4abbas,2011-02-16T03:43Z,Awesome! thank you
,josehndz3,2011-02-25T03:00Z,"tried the long line thing and got nothing... also the short command got nothing again... it only says ""no such file or directory: :/"
,matters5,2011-03-12T06:58Z,"Rockin'! Mrshll187's solution worked (actually, I didn't try it before changing the permissions first.)"
