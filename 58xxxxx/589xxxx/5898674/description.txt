Extensively patched up and dotted with piecemeal armour, this outfit pays homage to the classic ending of the original Fallout.

WEATHERED 10MM PlSTOL:

A well-worn 10mm pistol that provides a nice punch despite its modest size.

VAULT 13 CANTEEN:

This handy device is useful for staving off dehydration and providing a small amount of healing in the Mojave Wasteland.

5 STIMPAKS:

Food and water are good for long-term healing, but when the fighting is fierce, stimpaks help keep wastelanders upright.
