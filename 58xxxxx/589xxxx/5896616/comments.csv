,Fr02ty,2010-10-19T20:08Z,"w00t, damn that was fast guys. I LOVE YOU!!!! haha Soon as it finishes, I'll let it seed on my brothers weak 5mb connection as high and as fast as it can for as many days as we can stand it. :-) Thanks again. "
,Notcow,2010-10-19T20:11Z,"Will be seeding this for a long time, thank you SKiDROW."
,vultan,2010-10-19T20:13Z,"Pre-ordered collectors edition, but really cant wait!"
,Hilpi75,2010-10-19T20:13Z,Excellent Download Speed!!  downloading full bandwith with 18mbit DSL!!  Been anticipating this game.  Thanks to Uploader for making my day with Fallout New Vegas   :)
,drewjo,2010-10-19T20:14Z,"dling, will post later if it works well, thanks"
,jones81381,2010-10-19T20:35Z,What can I do to increase my download speed? I barely get any speed at all. The highest I've gotten is 50kbps. I have my download speed set to unlimited and I even turned my firewall off to see if that would help but it didn't. The odd thing is I'm showing 21 seeders but I'm not actually connecting with any of them. I guess that's what that means. #(x) where (x) is the number of total seeders and # is how many you are connected with. Help please.
,RyanRosco,2010-10-19T20:36Z,Thank you uploader and of course Skidrow. You guys have made my week
,yuri20346,2010-10-19T20:42Z,Extreme Seed my ass it loads slow as fuck.......
,towstu127,2010-10-19T20:54Z,Thanks for getting this out so quickly
,xavalonx,2010-10-19T20:57Z,"Wow amazing speed for only a few seeders, i owe u. been up all night looking for this game. "
,gr0x,2010-10-19T21:08Z,Seeda nu!
,SWEfriggeMS92,2010-10-19T21:11Z,"Damn, that was fast! Thanks for the up! Im gonna pirate this game since the last one constantly crashed after the main quest was finished and also because they insist on releasing dlc (I donÂ´t want to wait for GOTY-editions or constantly purchase dlcÂ´s)."
,zeree81,2010-10-19T21:12Z,omg i love u ;p
,aokantola,2010-10-19T21:14Z,I'll be happy to seed few weeks to get ratio right...
,EvilCatOfDoom,2010-10-19T21:16Z,Is there any way to speed up the download speed!? Like add new trackers or something like that!?
,zeree81,2010-10-19T21:17Z,dont like it uri go get it somewhere else thanx dibya and skidrow u d men 
,aokantola,2010-10-19T21:20Z,"...sorry, forgot to say nice thanks! And as alwaysm remember to BUY this if you feel its worth of playing!!!"
,Isti01,2010-10-19T21:27Z,"@jones81381
It's because the torrent has nearly 3000 downloaders and less than 30 seeder (and from the 30 I can only connect to one... weird)"
,Jobezor,2010-10-19T21:32Z,Seed plz really need this game!
,flacid_fred,2010-10-19T21:32Z,"seed this when you finish downloading fuckers 
spanks"
,Goldberger,2010-10-19T21:33Z,"Damn, many sleepless night coming up :D Pretty decent download speed. a bit over 1 mb/s. Thanks to the uploader for having this fast torrent considering how many are trying to leach at the same time :)"
,jones81381,2010-10-19T21:40Z,"@Isti01

But its strange how some people can get great connection while others have none. I'm downloading something from Steam right now, just started, and it's downloading at over 700kbps. I only have an 8meg connection (fastest offered in my area) and I have a roommate who played on xbox live. 700kbps is a good speed for me. The most I've ever gotten on anything is 1gig."
,koko-goal,2010-10-19T21:52Z,"you guys are so fucking awesome

I LOVE YOU."
,edhargrav,2010-10-19T21:56Z,"This is pathetic...  The number of leechers has jumped to 4000 but only like 5 new seeders.  If you leeched and ran you should feel terrible (not that they would be reading this anyway...)

Come on people.  At least let it get to 100 seeds before you even think about running."
,edhargrav,2010-10-19T22:07Z,There are actually less seeders now than when I started.. This is really getting sad guys.  Skidrow does this huge favor for the community getting this game out the first day and you all treat it like it was meant just for you.  SEED YOU DIRTY FUCKS.
,Goldberger,2010-10-19T22:08Z,well im going to stay an seed until friday. Pretty funny is that i got 110mb connection but upload is only pathetic 10mb. It wont help much but every little counts if everyone stays and seeds. 
,Garubi,2010-10-19T22:22Z,"I'm only getting about 150 kbps. I wouldn't call it ""XtreME SeED"" by my definition. I normally get at least 1mbps. Seeding at more than three times than what I'm downloading at. Sadface."
,-OLDBOY-,2010-10-19T22:27Z,"It only says: ""No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.""

What does that mean?"
,Notcow,2010-10-19T22:38Z,"Changed my mind, downloading the UNRARED version...why do you even make a shitty RARed one?"
,zeree81,2010-10-19T22:46Z,any1 who limits there upload speed should b lined up n shot u greedy fucks if we all did that u'd never finish a download :p
,aokantola,2010-10-19T23:01Z,"Once again: When a new, popular file comes, it takes some time to be seeded properly. Some of you just cant understand a simple math, I suppose? Look at the Civ V comments etc... Torrents also work via ""pieces"" and some of these are more seeded in the beginning than others. Anyway, go and buy the game instead of whining here if it is so vital for you! THANKS TEAM SKIDROW!"
,Goldberger,2010-10-19T23:03Z,ok im done. I'm staying and seeding and seems in 4 hours my ratio is 1:1 with this torrent. Happy downloading and hope you get this fast. 
,Killdar,2010-10-19T23:30Z,"I've had between 200 kb/s and 500 kb/s since i've started... I have 10mb download... Hopefully this torrent works perfect,
Thanks Skidrow!"
,McPhist0,2010-10-20T00:40Z,anyone know the password?
,Mosk50,2010-10-20T00:49Z,"@groebuck
It's because there are 30-odd people uploading and over 2200 people downloading. The restriction is not your internet connections, but the uploaders' internet connections."
,Rovelius,2010-10-20T01:27Z,Why are you people complaining about this being compressed in multiple RARs?? It's the same fucking thing... why not post this instead: THANK YOU SKIDROW !!!!
,Lindane,2010-10-20T01:55Z,"Most of you need to learn how torrents work and calm the hell down.

As for the complainers @ leechers, there is no honor among thieves, get over it."
,Eatshit777,2010-10-20T02:13Z,Cant wait to play this game and will definately seed props to Skidrow
,knox666,2010-10-20T02:18Z,We should set up direct connections for the people that actually seed around here so the game can get out faster. I'm downloading but it's at 0.5 kb/s I seed for a week on all that I download I understand some peeps have to pay to download but I don't so that's why i'm nice enough to seed. My point is the scene should get the games uploaded to peps like me so it can get out faster because the douches get it first then quit it then no one get's it for day's.
,happyhixxy,2010-10-20T02:59Z,this is the worst torrent ever!!!! keep getting error failed to find torrent in the middle of a download??

,Mustbaj,2010-10-20T10:48Z,you are dumb. this works fine and downloads fast. i have been playing it for hours. exit steam if you can or if worse thing happens uninstall and reinstall steam. also try running as admin.
