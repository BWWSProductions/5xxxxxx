Biography by William Ruhlmann allmusic.com

Jefferson Starship was among the most successful arena rock bands of the 1970s and early '80s, an even greater commercial entity than its predecessor, Jefferson Airplane, the band out of which it evolved. Many Jefferson Airplane fans decried the group's new, more mainstream musical direction, especially after Airplane singers Grace Slick and Marty Balin departed in 1978. But with shifting personnel, Jefferson Starship managed to please its new fans and some old ones over a period of a decade before it shifted gears into even more overtly pop territory and changed names again to become simply Starship.

Greatest Hits (Ten Years and Change 1979-1991) is a compilation album released in 1991 when Starship ended its recording contract with RCA. The album contains two new tracks, "Don't Lose Any Sleep" and "Good Heart." "Good Heart" was released as a single and hit #81 on the Billboard charts.
