Jesse Ventura on Fox Business News Heated 911 Discussion.

Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who during the Vietnam War was part of the Navy's Underwater Demolition Team, claims that

"I'm suggesting that governments do things to get us into wars," the former pro-wrestler told Eric Bolling on Fox Business News yesterday in an interview to promote Ventura's new cable TV show, "Conspiracy Theory," which premieres Friday.

"I'm saying 9/11 was to get us into Iraq and get us into Afghanistan," the actor formerly known as The Body told Bolling on "Follow The Money".

When asked by Bolling if he really believed that the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, specifically on the World Trade Center, happened so we could get oil from Iraq, the typically outspoken Ventura said "yes, and so we can have lithium from Afghanistan."

This isn't the first time Ventura has publicly expressed his theories about 9/11. As early as April 2008, the former governor appeared on the Alex Jones show and said that after his son insisted that he watch the 9/11 consipiracy theory documentary "Loose Change" he began to doubt the WTC collapse.

"When I finally did watch it I went through every emotion you could imagine, from laughing, crying, getting sick to my stomach, to the whole emotional thing," Ventura told Jones in 2008.
