forgot to add the info from the website:

""Plum Island""
Jesse storms Congress to find out if the government is conducting bio-warfare experiments at the mysterious Plum Island Animal Research Center off the coast of Long Island. The center began as a bio-warfare lab run by former Nazi scientists, and it has been blamed for spreading diseases and viruses throughout the mainland, including African swine flu and Lyme disease."
