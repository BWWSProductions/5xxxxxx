""program cant start because XINPUT1_3.dll is missing"" can someone tell me how to fix this?

thansk in advance"
,vincentc1230,2011-11-13T21:41Z,"@dsknyn I know EXACTLY what your problem is. First you need to download ""DirectX"". It should be in your NBA 2K11 folder after you unRared the WinRar file. After you finished the download, you can now play the game. Hope I helped. ;)"
