Khaos Komix is a webcomic by Tab Kimpton. It's about the lives of a number of gay teenage boys and girls, first telling a story out of one charachter's point of view and then continuing to tell about what went on in the life of another character at the time, giving the reader a slightly different take on events, and then describing what happened afterwards.

Khaos contains 2 transgendered characters, one a FTM (female to male transsexual) and an MTF (male to female transsexual).
