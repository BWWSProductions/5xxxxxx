Musical powerhouses John Legend & The Roots present Wake Up,
eleven profoundly evocative songs pulled from the soulful
music of the 60's and 70's all with an underlying theme of
awareness, engagement and consciousness. The album is
highlighted with familiar tracks like "Little Ghetto Boy" by
Donny Hathaway mixed with more obscure selections like Baby
Huey and the Babysitters' "Hard Times". Wake Up also
includes one original composition, John Legend's "Shine,"
which is featured in the upcoming documentary Waiting For
Superman.
