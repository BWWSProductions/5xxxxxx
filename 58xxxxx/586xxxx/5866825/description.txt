Bile Discography
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_%28band%29

Led by vocalist Krztoff, the band released three albums on Energy Records, including their debut, Suckpump. Following a tour with Gwar and 

many lineup changes, Energy folded, inciting Bile to regroup and record for their own label, Bile Style. Bile recorded Sex Reflex. This album 

features their most popular song to date, "In League." When performing live, Bile usually consists of Krztoff (vocals, guitar), R. H. Bear  (bass, 

effects), live guitarist Dave Sussman and live drummer John "Servo" Desalvo. The live act generally consists of a fog machine, extreme lighting 

and occasional stage props.
Krztoff is also an active member of Pigface and Black From the Dead a side project with guest appearance by Charles Levi on bass, alongside 

Buzz McCoy (both of My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult). Bile is currently working on their new CD Hate Radio, which will slowly be released through 

their MySpace page, and with an official CD release in 2009 Bile is currently recruiting a new guitarist and a few other additional members that 

have not been named prior to the official release and US tour that will soon follow.
