,RickeeBoy,2010-10-04T23:31Z,"Pooloop - On a more serious note......
Joker - "" Why so Serious ""

Bit like you I don't like to be called names so please don't call me a little ****. Anyway, I can happily live with that ... but have noticed that the quality is a little low on your great U/L's ( Thanks Big Time) - so I D/L'd MOTD2 - both your 632.53 MiB and other  745.17 MiB although yours has the better resolution format... but yours is lower overall size ???? Now, please don't get all "" Lets have a Pop at Rickee"" Anyway, after checking the quality the larger file is definitely a better quality and is definitely adds to the flow of the game  whereas on the smaller file - you lose the flow of the game a bit. 

Hey Pooloop - Just thought you may want to know .... and it's so good to have a fan  U/L'ing is it's 500 times better - as all us Worldwide MOTD fans show... .... and  who else is gonna get my whacky comments.... 

Yolanda: You don't hurt him.
Jules: Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're gonna be like three little Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like? Come on Yolanda what's Fonzie like?
Yolanda: Cool?
Jules: What?
Yolanda: He's cool.
Jules: Correctamundo. And that's what we're gonna be. We're gonna be cool."
,pooloop,2010-10-05T00:07Z,"1st RickeeBoy it was said as light fun no malice intended,but fair point i wont say it again...
2nd if you remember a couple of weeks ago i was having some problems with audio so i used a new program which made it 4.3,so i went back to my old one,anyway its only today i found out how to get higher quality and 16.9 with the new one,which is good news and the results i can see with the file i upped and the new one i made ( both from original recording )is miles better,but you will see this for youfself in 2 weeks,again no offence was intended with the comment, sorry mate"
,RickeeBoy,2010-10-05T07:17Z,"Pooloop, 

1. Brilliant.... no offence taken.. great reply.

2. Mega pleased it was a technical problem and you've sorted it ( I didn't know you had a problem ) but superb that you can remedy and improve the quality - That extra little bit of resolution seems to make a huge difference - Thanks Man.

3. 8 mill for Van Der Vaart was our buy of the decade ... Whooopppeee !!

4. Saw your comment about no MOTD next week and I'm well pissed at it. - Crap, shit, Crap, Crap, Shit, crap !!!

5. Great job - Thanks from the masses !!!!

: King Arthur: I am your king. 
Woman: Well I didn't vote for you. 
King Arthur: You don't vote for kings. 
Woman: Well how'd you become king then? 
[Angelic music plays... ] 
King Arthur: The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. THAT is why I am your king. 
Dennis: [interrupting] Listen, strange women lyin' in ponds distributin' swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
