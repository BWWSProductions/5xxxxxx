Thank you so very much!"
,NanoMan_777,2011-04-20T20:34Z,"Any guess how to add my own models.
I know lots of ladies who would love to model and have me submit their custom image's. If I could figure out how to add them I would be rather busy and very popular...If you can give me directions I would appreciate it.
Thank you"

Short Story - I got addicted to this and spent ""200"" GIG of download getting more and more Models..from others...after beating my head against the wall for a week I said to myself--
MYSELF - 20-30 girls are enough..GRIN!
Thank you it was easy to even reinstall after playing with the others.
Super!"
