It should work on installing but if not you could install as trial and enter serial at first run. 

Remember to run the Activation Blocker!

,tweak21,2010-10-16T06:40Z,"Work great!
For people having problems: DISCONNECT your internet; Find the activation blocker & run it,  find the application which is easily found as SETUP.EXE and run it.
Once its installed try a serial till you get a working one, 2nd one worked for me.  
THEN open the CRACK folder, choose 32 or 64 depending on your system & just copy the crack. go into your program files, find adobe photoshopCS5 and just click paste; it really does work qust fine, no activation screen popped up & program works great.

Yes you're able to update, don't know about automatecly but you could also download the newest update for your application here -> www.adobe.com/downloads/updates/

@ mr.WEBSsnake
The Activation Blocker aint no bullshit, if you do everything right then all should be okey. 

about the serial generator you're talking about, well it won't make anything any better :) 
Cause the serials work as long as you run the Activator blocker right. (as admin) 

This is how it works. 
You run the activation blocker(as admin), it will add a few ""connections"" to your host file (to the blacklist, as i like to name it), now adobe can't connect to it's servers to check, you enter the serial and it will come as valid. 

If the setup is trial or not doesn't have ANYTHING to say.  

So shut you mouth, if you're gonna comment please know what you are commenting about.

and if you're running XP then please do yourself a favor and change to Windows 7.
