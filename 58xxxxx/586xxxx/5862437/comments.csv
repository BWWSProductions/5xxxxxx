,moshster,2010-10-02T12:24Z,What are these files with numbered extensions?  How do I extract?
,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-10-13T16:52Z,"If you look at a torrent and it has no screenshots ( for porn) or a link to boxcover/official info about the file ( for films or tvseries etc) google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out who dont know what the file is , please dont be as disgustingly lazy as 99.9% of tpb users and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself it only takes a few seconds per file ,the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now please.
Also keep seeding dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets you upload the faster your upload speed the faster you download speed is for recieving data thats how bittorent works !
im not a hypocrite sometimes when i go to post info tpb says database error failed to write..i dont have time to remember to go back to the files i couldnt help out on..so if u spot files needing info please help out. ps if you look at porn remember to respect women theyre gods greatest creation.

use hjsplit to join the bits then itll play with vlcplayer http://freebyte.com/hjsplit/#hjjoin"

That HJSplit software sucks balls, don't bother with it.

Use 7-Zip to extract everything (download it at http://www.7-zip.org).

Thanks to uploader for this rare film."
