This is how they get them from the groups that provide them.

I know it is frustrating for people who have graduated from watching on their PC to watching on their TVs, but this is how they get them.

It sucks, but it isn't TvTeam's fault."

You should look into getting one.  It's the best HD PC-to-TV device.  The only thing it lacks is WiFi.  It has optical audio, HDMI, and a basically usable menu driven interface.

I think they are only $99 now."
