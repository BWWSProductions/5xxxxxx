They have this entire week off and then next Monday off for Columbus Day.  So they will return next Tuesday.

For now,  they are airing ""The Peacock Years' which covers the NBC days from 1980-1985."
,agentorange41,2010-10-05T05:20Z,"Again, thank you! I was never able to listen to entire shows until now"
,ToneZone,2010-10-05T19:59Z,"Thank you wushdishmeen!  I'm listening to 9/28 now.  I'll catch up while Howard is away.

Thank you for your uploads!!"
[V],wushdishmeen,2010-10-06T11:19Z,"Once again TPB is being a tub of shit and not letting me upload torrents.  Luckily it's vacation.

By the way,  I've been thinking about posting my torrents on xtremespeeds dot net as a backup so if you haven't signed up there yet definitely do so.  It's a great private tracker with a lot more stuff than you'll find here and torrents are always well seeded."
,SiebeSniper,2010-10-06T21:41Z,Can someone send me an invite code for xtremespeeds?
,imus_rules,2010-10-11T21:28Z,i'm in need for an xtremespeeds invite code as well!
,rbrdky2,2010-10-19T20:42Z,Anyway I can get an invite? I typically seed 5-10 times at least.
