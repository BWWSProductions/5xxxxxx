,netfire_,2011-04-27T02:28Z,One thing of note is the self titled album is a vinyl rip of the best quality.

,Arctavius,2012-01-07T05:05Z,"While other ""progressive"" bands let ego and greed rule, causing the bands to dissolve/split and deteriorate, these three gentlemen have been rocking for over 35 years! Thank You zibbik for an awesome upload!

And thank you Neil Peart, the greatest drummer on the planet! "
,arnoldmd2,2012-02-18T20:34Z,"Yea, were is Exit Stage Left.  that was left out."
,slewix,2012-03-21T21:27Z,"Just a heads up -- all the ID3v2 tags have ""Rush"" as the album name. This may prove frustrating if you wanted to sort the mp3's by album name.
Otherwise fine upload."
,liamcline,2012-03-25T20:51Z,"Tis a good day when one has enough Rush to fill its entirety.
Great download, ~1.10 MiBps the whole time.  Audio quality doesn't sound resampled, probably truly 320."
