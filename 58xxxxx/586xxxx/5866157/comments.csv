[V],phatwarez,2010-10-11T01:59Z,It plays ok for me. That's how I was able to take screenshots.
,Bob__Dole,2010-11-28T02:33Z,"Thanks and Ok, BUT that it played fine when you took screens is not evidence it is still ok now.  It passed the checksum from the torrent file/client so I suspect it got corrupt before that was calculated.

Might be a problem on my end instead, I'm just saying I have no trouble playing any other videos but with this one, all players lock at the same exact point in the video."
