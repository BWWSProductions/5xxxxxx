"The Box" 

The story alternates to the Fringe Team 
"over here" where they investigate a 
mystifying case that people are 
discovered in a trance-like state that 
ultimately leads to their death. The 
unlikely suspect: a mysterious box. As 
Peter and Walter collaborate to study 
its properties, alternate Olivia 
presses on and turns up the heat on an 
unsuspecting Peter. Meanwhile, key 
information about the future is 
revealed when Walter and Nina meet at 
Massive Dynamic for the emotional 
reading of the last will and testament 
of William Bell.

Enjoy :)
