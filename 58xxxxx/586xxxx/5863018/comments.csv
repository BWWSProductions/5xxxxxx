,ineedsomehelp139,2010-12-27T21:25Z,"alright, i've been working on this for countless hours now. i've followed instructions very closely, but all in all, i'm no wiz at this sort of thing. would anyone mind helping me? "
,SailJerry,2011-01-13T04:50Z,"Works great for me. For those having trouble. 

1. Download the torrent and find the file ""Ableton.Suitev8.2"" wherever you have it set to save. 

2. Select all the .rar files and right click and hit ""extract to folder"" and make a new folder to put them in. Then once they are all done extracting there will be one singular file in that folder, right click again and hit ""extract"". 

3. This will bring up the setup and auth files. Perform the setup first and then double click on the auth file. Nothing will pop up immediately, it will simply install the authorization file in the background. 

4. Now open Albeton. It will ask if you want to download ""Max For Live"" Click OK and this will install all the missing samples and effects. 

These are the steps that worked for me. 

Thanks for the torrent!"
