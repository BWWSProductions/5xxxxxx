,Apple15,2010-10-25T01:09Z,The keygen doesn't work!
,Apple15,2010-10-25T01:15Z,"NEVERMIND! IT does work, but you have to copy the request code from the maya window and not from the keygen window!"
,Apple15,2010-10-25T01:21Z,"Also, is it necessary to keep copying and pasting the activation code every time and then leave maya at ""activated"" screen and then open another maya window? Because that seems to be the only way."
,iClient,2010-11-07T06:46Z,"To you all downloading, after your done seed, seriously you got a free 3d program thats retailed 5,000+ free. you can at least do whats right and share you download like others did for you so really, don't hit stop when it says download complete"
,iClient,2010-11-07T09:25Z,"ok i will be seeding 2x the original download size or just for another 5 days or any requests.

If you have ANY questions or requests as far as seeding message me on youtube.com/iclient since i don't think there is a mail here on TPB."
,globalpuffer,2010-12-02T06:35Z,"I installed this on a Win 7 32 bit machine... It works perfectly!  Very easy to install.. Just follow the instructions carefully.. (They are extremely simple.)  I have used Maya cracks for years, and this is by far the easiest I have ever done.  It installs the fully loaded Maya Unlimited Version.. (I also installed Stun's other 64 Bit version on another machine and that one worked perfectly as well)Thank you Stun!!!!  Great work on both."
,globalpuffer,2010-12-02T06:46Z,"By the way!   When you are entering the activation code, don't worry about it being 8 digits less than Maya is requesting.. They are not necessary!"
,shadowskilled,2010-12-05T15:19Z,"The activation gave me the world of trouble, but i got there in the end. I strongly suggest reading the activation instructions FIRST a couple of times as its all in there. Thanks Stun an excellent up mate."
,wolfy_m,2011-01-14T08:58Z,"I'm having issues getting it started. Is there a specific program needed to install Maya?

I tried downloading Daemon Tools Lite (the free one), but it doesn't recognize any of the files that are in the torrent for me to install. There's no unpacking, burning, or mounting available for the folder or files inside. 

What program should be used to install?"

,idestruction,2011-02-07T08:40Z,Im running a 32bit version of xp and the 32 bit keygen doesnt work. I tried opening the 64bit one and it worked but froze on me... Any ideas?
