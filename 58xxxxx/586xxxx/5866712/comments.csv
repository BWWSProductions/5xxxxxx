,Unknown16,2010-10-06T18:09Z,Thank you for the upload. Album's good but it can't compare to Only By The Night. That album was amazing.
,carderne,2010-10-11T20:38Z,And Only By The Night can't hold a candle against their previous work.
,Jordaniswhite,2010-10-14T11:35Z,"regardless Kings is amazing at what they do, thanks for the upload"

,d_Djan,2010-10-20T21:09Z,"Nope, i liked Only By The Night better too; we'r not the same, you know."
,harrybish,2010-10-20T23:04Z,"i will listen to this but if people are saying it's not as good as 'Only By The Night', then it can't be that great. That album ruined Kings Of Leon. They used to be quite good!"
,Brian428,2010-10-21T09:47Z,"You with your switch blade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cockfight
Four kicks who's struttin' now?

I miss old Kings.......

See what happens when you stop taking drugs?  You stop making good music, fucking sobriety..."
,Brian428,2010-10-21T10:11Z,Go listen to Four Kicks because this is trash.

,trevevs,2011-01-07T00:26Z,cheers for the up- but please do us a favour in future and tag ur files properly before u up.  Media Monkeys good for the job...ta
,brenkerr,2011-01-28T01:09Z,"this is by far the worst torrent i've ever downloaded. the files themselves are organized in the most random and backwards way, they aren't individually named for the names of the songs, and itunes refuses to recognize it as a single album. 

download the one with 500 some-odd seederes"
,Lillbrandt,2011-02-03T22:47Z,Thank you! :)
,linibean,2011-02-26T07:49Z,"No ID3 tags on the song files! Booo!
And I'm too lazy to change all the info myself in iTunes so I'm just going to download a different torrent. Double boo."
,MitsEvX,2011-04-01T11:47Z, Thanks :D
[T],kimeesteres,2011-06-13T22:09Z,"Dank u wel, en een +1 stem voor dit fijne uploaden! ~ van Paula in Nieuwveen. :)"
,goddaughter,2011-07-23T05:54Z,"you have got to be kidding me....... The files aren't even labelled by name, just ""02. Kings of Leon"" and so on and so forth..... that's just freaking annoying!!"
