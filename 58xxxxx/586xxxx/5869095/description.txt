Ovnimoon is back with a full power 20 track
compilation...
... that seeks to answer the millennial question of
what is Psytrance
Hector Stuardo aka the world known trance producer
and seminal DJ extraordinaire digs deep into his
magic stash of fresh new unreleased tracks to present
a fine showcase of the latest magnificent selections
from the worlds leading talent and even some as yet
undiscovered gems
'Mysteries Of Psytrance' leaves the listener begging
for more after a full featured exploration through the
myriad and majestic deep space adventure that is like
a pandora's box of surprises and bold new ideas that
chart a new path through the cosmos. Once unlocked
the mysteries will surely sweep you along into the
wake of a powerful comet of sonic deliverance bound
for the outer rim
Tracks from labels artists Psilocybian, Man Machine,
Rigel, Leenuz and Audio Form create a foundation for
the cosmic escapade. Psycho Abstract vs Flipin take
us to a new height with Chaotic Universe. Logica
continues to push deeper with Space. Cosmos Vibration
delivers a batch of Tolteca Mushrooms, while Via Axis
is Streaming pure Cosmos. By the 2nd half your mind
will be so ready to transcend that your trip will be
effortless and playful while reaching new layers of
understanding. Random and Virtual Lights epic hit
'Mastery of the Mind' will surely demonstrate the
process while Wizack Twizack and Virtual Light speak
with aliens in 'Nute Gunray'
All in all this trip is so packed with pleasure that
you wont ever want to stop

We would like to take the
opportunity to point out that psytrance
needs YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to
give you a preview in psytrance,
ambient and electronic music and
in our opinion this is absolutely
NO alternative to buying

MP3 isnt the same as holding a
bought record in your hands

You need to feel the bass to go with the
flow ... and that's what mp3 just can't
give you. So better get it in high
quality, while it's still available
and not soldout

Please support the artists and
especially smaller labels that make
it possible to enjoy the music you
seem to love that much
