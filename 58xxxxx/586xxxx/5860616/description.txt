"Accounting for Lawyers"

When Jeff Winger (Joel McHale) runs into his 
former law firm colleague Alan Connor (Rob 
Corddry), the two re-connect and Jeff finds 
himself returning to some of his evil ways 
of late night partying and expensive suits. 
Alan takes Jeff to a law firm event to see 
his former boss, Ted (Drew Carey), and the 
study group shows up to "rescue" him. While 
Annie (Alison Brie), Abed (Danny Pudi) and 
Troy (Donald Glover) sneak into the offices 
to gather dirt on Alan, Jeff watches in 
horror as Pierce (Chevy Chase), Britta 
(Gillian Jacobs) and Shirley (Yvette Nicole 
Brown) are corrupted by the lawyers.

Enjoy :)
