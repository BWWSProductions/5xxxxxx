,Nembutal,2011-09-27T23:06Z,"DO NOIT SEED OR DOWNLOAD THIS!

There is  a corrupted file called GARDEN2.MUS which has zero bytes and crashes ScummVM and the game also in Windows / DOS!"
,Guybrush_,2011-10-08T10:26Z,"Nembutal is lying, the game works perfectly. 

Download the torrent, extract both ISOs into a single folder and then, using ScummVM, click on ""Add Game..."", select the folder the game's files are stored in  and then select ""Choose""

Everything from this point is even more straight forward. 

Thanks .BONE.!"
,Guybrush_,2011-10-08T10:48Z,"Oh yeah and also when extracting the ISOs into a single folder you need to:
