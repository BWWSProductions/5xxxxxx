,TheEnlightened,2010-10-02T23:07Z,"Thanks for the great episode twentyforty! 

Too bad the fascists of America didn't air this on TV with the rest of the season.

But if anybody is wondering, this is the uncensored version from the DVD not a British TV rip.  "

@hkoraddi: Absolutely. Today. I have one back yesterday - but it was bad, ugly piece of junk. If new copy (in download queue right now) is good - I would rip it. Otherwise - I'll wait for BluRay out."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-03T12:26Z,"@qwersd: It should work and please, if you could, tell me how's going."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-04T08:02Z,"@qwersd: Therefore I wrote in the Note: 

""320p = frame-size 576x320 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, or 576x240 for 2.35:1
             (movies/theatrical AR)middle-format, playback
             ONLY on PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. 
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file, however, 
             some portables accept these format (TIP: upgrade firmware). ""

To play 320p with CABAC entropy on old/original/unpatched iPod 5.5 is impossible and I cannot know What firmware one has.
iPhone cannot play 320p at all.   

In future, upgrade firmware (many people can play up to 640x360 pixels on their 5.5G and without constrains). Google. Consult ad section in local newspapers. Many cell-phone hackers are able to install such firmware in many handhelds.   

To avoid problems till then - play 272p exclusively. It's 120% compatible, millions knows that already."
