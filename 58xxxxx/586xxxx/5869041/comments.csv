,Party-Angel,2010-10-30T15:02Z,"Thx!!

I do have one question....
I followed the installation instructions, but the program keeps saying that my trialversion has expiered.

Does anyone have any tips?"
,Jailboy,2010-11-09T14:25Z,"Same problem as Party-Angel, installs fine, says its registered but then on program open, it says trial is expired. -.-'"
,theoriginalphantom,2010-11-09T19:08Z,"Those getting trial expired message. Set your folder options to show hidden folders, then go to program data and find the slysoft folder, then open the anydvd folder and delete the anydvd.chk file. After that all should be good for you. But please dont forget to uncheck the box regarding automatic updates.
Thanks for this hellboy"
,bleach622,2010-11-12T03:03Z,"fyi... for XP users
i installed and then exited program
go to C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\SlySoft\AnyDVD and
delete the anydvd.chk file
then go back and run the key.anydvd file
run the program
worked for me and i did NOT go through the registry and delete every slysoft or anydvd entry."
[V],catflap,2010-11-12T06:28Z,"crap i screwed up too.

except i have win7 64bit which is ok
for this program. but i screwed up on
the registering thing.

but i don't have the same folder path as xp
and there isn't Documents and Settings or 
Application Data,

so i checked the folder of slysoft/anydvd and there is no anydvd.chk file even when all
hidden files and folders are showing.

i uninstalled it and ran regedit. no trace of anydvd.

i tried a system restore, reboot, and reinstall
but i still get the expired message.

any help, please"
[V],catflap,2010-11-12T08:07Z,"ok, i ""fixed"" it.

uninstalled again, cleaned out registry again,
system restore again.

then i took ChattChitto's version
of 6.7.0.0 from here and it
works:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5858904

it has an easy patching app and
instructions are simple, especially
if you have win7."
,goofy173,2010-11-15T02:09Z,"If AnyDVD was already installed anytime in the past on your computer, this key will not work."
,goofy173,2010-11-15T02:16Z,catflap is right. This won't work if you've ever had it installed before. Use http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5858904
,dislexic,2010-11-21T11:03Z,"Thanks for the torrent man! In other news, I found that the key in this torrent works with the AnyDVD HD version in this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5874954/SlySoft_AnyDVD_HD_v6.7.1.0_Multilingual_WinAll_Incl._Patch

Just a small f.y.i. :)"
,fire96825,2010-11-25T08:12Z,your stuff rocks!  thanks hellboy!  when is anydvd 6.7.3.0 coming out?
,fire96825,2010-11-25T08:20Z,your stuff always rocks!  when is 6.7.3.0 coming out?
,fire96825,2010-11-25T08:21Z,your stuff always rocks!  when is 6.7.3.0 coming out? 11/24/10
,addtwo,2010-12-28T14:43Z,"Works great. It didn't work the first time I installed it because I guess I had some leftover files from when I used the trial one. I used Revo Uninstaller to remove all the files, installed it again and it worked fine."
,Winnah,2011-01-06T06:49Z,"For anyone who wants the current 6.7.5.0 version where it works for Blue-Ray / HD , then go to:
