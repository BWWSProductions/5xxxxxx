There's no separating the unparalleled legacy of The Doobie
Brothers from their upcoming release ""World Gone Crazy."" The
Doobie Brothers have honored the broader, 40-year band's
legacy with a new studio album that grows in unexpected
directions. Founding members Tom Johnston and Pat Simmons are
joined by longtime members John McFee and Mike Hosack. Ted
Templeman, the producer behind the band biggest hits and
other classics (Van Halen, Eric Clapton, Carly Simon, etc)
returns to reignite the special chemistry that audiences have
embraced for the past four decades.
