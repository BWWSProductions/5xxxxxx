Great to see someone else uploading .wbfs releases ... just a suggestion ... it is a good idea to have the region (PAL, NTSC, NTSC-J) in the ""Torrent name"" for indexing/search purposes ;) ... also it is worth doing a quick search before uploading ... I have already uploaded this in wbfs format here ->  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5480770/%5BWii%5DWii.Play%5BPAL%5D%5BScRuBBeD%5D.wbfs  :)"
,Strikefear13,2010-10-03T17:13Z,Never been able to figure out how to use WBFS files.. Can I juts rename them to .iso so I can use them CONVENIENTLY? Like burning them to disc or installing them with WBFS Manager?
[V],r3dcat,2010-10-03T18:26Z,"@Strikefear13: The .wbfs file format is probably the most ""convenient"" format to use of all :) ... read the comments I have left on this torrent to give you break down of reasoning :)  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5487324/%5BWii%5DVertigo%5BPAL%5D%5BScRuBBeD%5D.wbfs  ... Just use Wii Backup Manager to convert to iso  ... found here  http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=188295 "
[V],r3dcat,2010-10-03T18:31Z,forgot to mention you can also use Wii Backup Manager to just add a .wbfs file to an existing WBFS formatted partition as you would an .iso file :)

Please provide and seed ISO files.  I plan to."
