
Chuck Missler - The Book Of Proverbs (DivX)

The Book of Proverbs could be titled, ''Wise Up'' and Live. Beyond simply obeying laws, this book focuses on leading an aggressively dynamic life, giving examples of proper and improper attitudes, conduct, and characteristics in succinct, penetrating ways. A proverb can be thought of as ''a short sentence from long experience''; it is easy to remember, yet it condenses much wisdom into a small space.

''All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable'' in four ways: for doctrine - whats right; for reproof - whats not right; for correction - how to get right; and for instruction in righteousness - how to stay right (2 Timothy 3:16). This book touches on all four of these.
