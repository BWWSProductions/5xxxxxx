Two months into the season and the 
Championship is taking shape. 
Queen's Park Rangers are one of the 
teams off to a great start, showing 
real potential, but their title credentials 
are sure to be put to the test against 
one of coach Neil Warnock's former 
clubs, Crystal Palace. Meanwhile, 
Ipswich Town and Leeds United go 
head-to-head at Portman Road. 
Twelve months previously,
Ipswich were having a dreadful time 
but Roy Keane's team are much 
improved. On the south coast in 
League One, Southampton meet 
Bournemouth in a local affair.
