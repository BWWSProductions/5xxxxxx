,donnie_23,2011-01-10T16:09Z,if you have many other games downloading on utorrent I'd pause them because then your game of castlevania will seed and leech faster you right click on the other games that  are downloading on utorrent and pause and don't right click and pause castlevania you update it's tracker when you right click and everything goes smooth
