Learn about the technologies that will usher in a whole new way of life: we will live in floating cities, fly to work and travel in cars capable of operating underwater. And, with new technologies, humanity will find new ways of protecting and conserving resources to meet the needs of a growing population by using renewable sources of water, food and electricity. The era of smog-filled skies will be over, because fewer of us will be driving cars. Where we're going, we won't need roads. We'll be piloting environmentally friendly personal vehicles between cities and under the seas. And the good news is we'll never be lost, thanks to new advances in GPS-driven virtual mapping. Then again, with the ability to teleport our presence anywhere on Earth, we might not have to travel at all. And, best of all, we'll all have more time to enjoy the astounding advances of our near future, because we'll all be living longer. A lot longer.
