Kings of Leon will return with their highly anticipated fifth album, \'Come Around Sundown\', on October 15th, 2010. The new album was recorded in New York at Avatar Studios and produced once again by Angelo Petraglia and Jacquire King. \'Come Around Sundown\' is the follow-up to the hugely successful \'Only By The Night\', which sold over six million copies worldwide and garnered four Grammy Awards and two Brits. It\'s yet another bold and expansive statement by the Nashville, Tennessee-based quartet who, in the last two years, have become one of the biggest bands in the world, and also one of the most creatively restless. As proven throughout their storied career, Kings of Leon love to work. Whether writing, recording or touring, the band is constantly in motion. Once they finished touring in support of \'Only By The Night\' at the end of October of 2009, they went back in the studio to record in February 2010. 

Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
Cheers, Bubanee
