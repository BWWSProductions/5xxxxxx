,vain_sain,2010-12-08T14:35Z,"The Game is working fine. Thanks a lot.

But the gameplay is really poor.

Those who can't run this pls follow these :

1) Unrar

2) Copy ""XPK, XPKT & Sound"" folder to C:\Users\your computer name\AppData\Local\Temp

3) Then run from where you've installed."
,Lyawz,2011-01-10T09:52Z,"Guys. Ur suppose to copy:
XPKT
XPK
Sound
SaveData
Movie
Misc

Folders to User/[Comp.Name]/AppData/Local/Temp

If just Sound, XPKT, XPK.

It will have a black backround, Cannot save, and no Superstar pics.

To as I said to make it fully Functional.

Windows 7 Users:
Can't see AppData?
1. Go to My Computer
2. Click Organize button [Top Left]
3. Open Folder and search options
4. Go to General tab
5. Check Show all folders
6. Go to View
7. Then Hidden files and folders > Show hidden files, folders and drives.

Usually the comp name on Windows 7 is ""Users"".

Hope I helped :]"
