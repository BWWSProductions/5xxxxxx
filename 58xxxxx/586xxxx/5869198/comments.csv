,exocetkid1,2010-10-09T19:42Z,"hmm,,what does eBDRIP mean??"
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-10-10T23:16Z,@exocetkid1 it means you should read description more often :)
,exocetkid1,2010-10-11T09:19Z,"yea your right missed that.
The sharpness is like blueray and file size is really small for this quality, good work"
,JD74,2010-11-04T11:24Z,"The Audio is garbage. My Win7 MC HTPC is setup perfectly and plays every HighDef MKV, MP4, M2TS, AVI etc file I throw at it using pass-through audio for AAC, AC3 and DTS. All I get from this file is static.....and the only way to get audio is to use VLC, which will not pass-through...giving me stereo only. Rather than getting fancy with a new compression scheme, how about creating a more standardized file that works well, along side everyone else's. I have even tried Handbrake to re-encode the audio, with no success......."
[T],fachman,2010-11-06T01:08Z,"All I can say JD74 is that your comp is NOT setup perfectly. It seems for me that you have correct configuration for DTS and AC3 but wrong in case of AAC. This is why VLC gives you only stereo.
First it would be good for you to start reading NFO. I know there is a lot of information, but they are provided to avoid such situation.
Second of all, the key to success is to decode AAC by computer and send to SPDIF uncommpressed PCM 5.1.
Good luck"
,JD74,2011-02-02T11:07Z,"The problem is your shitty 32khz samplig rate. No matter what, it will NOT passthrough to my Dolby Digital encoder through Optical Digital.,.....although my other 500+ movies, most encoded using AAC sampled @ 48khz play just fine. I found the solution. I download your Rips, transcode/upsample to 48khz from your retarded 32khz and EVERYTHING WORKS as it should. File size grows by 1%.....not even worth commenting on, so why the ODD BALL 32khz sampling rate ? ....honestly."
,herniator,2011-02-17T09:49Z,"JD74 quit being such a whiny bitch.  There's constructive feedback, and then there's you.  Be grateful that your are receiving the fruits of someone else's labour for free.

On the other hand, 32khz... wtf?"
