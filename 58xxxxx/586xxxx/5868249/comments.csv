Hope you consider uploading it. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-05T18:01Z,"@nikoHD: Thanks, but it's not what I meant. I can, as anybody else, download content of these torrents. Problem is in specific audience and my personal (of semi-technical nature) inability to encode and up whole Seasons from scratch. Packing episodes I have encoded before (as for Big Bang Theory or Glee) is JUST simple moving EXISTING encodes in one folder and making of a torrent. But - doing ANY series from zero, for few people only,  is - suicidal. I have learned that hard way...
Besides, my argument about Disney shows (and problems I have few years back) is heavier than it seems.
I wont explain further, and answer is, hopefully understandable and firm - no."
,nikoHD,2010-10-05T23:16Z,Ok thanks anyway mate.
