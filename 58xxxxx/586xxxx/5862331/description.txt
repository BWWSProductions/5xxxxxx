National Geographic does a great job. it's amazing how TV can teach you so many interesting things. and oh my God , there's so many things happening in a woman's womb ! a great documentary. lot of things in that. must see it for your self , don't mind me. all I can say is that you'll be for sure glue to the TV for the whole hour and 30 min . I can promise you that.great images taking from the inside , shows you how the baby grows and what changes happened there. he he he . I gave 'em a 10 ! they deserve it. I watched with my girlfriend and she was impressed too of what she saw in this documentary. it makes you wonder for sure , giving birth is no easy stuff. life is such a precious thing !
