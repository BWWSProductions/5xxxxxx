,aParadox,2010-10-04T08:04Z,"If you're going to talk about download speed, fucking learn how torrents work. It just got uploaded, wait for more seeds to appear and the number of leechers to smooth out a bit. Maybe an hour or two.
It's almost as if there are nothing but 12 year olds just learning they can download television on their mom's PC.

Thanks EZtv for a quick and quality upload."

,worldsfinestpirate,2010-10-22T04:57Z,"Quality - 8/10
Sound - 9/10
Collaboration - 10/10

Notes: Skips/laggs often in the beggining and middle. Not much to worry about."
