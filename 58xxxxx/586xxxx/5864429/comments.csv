ONCE YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED, REMEMBER TO SEED IT TO KEEP CLASSIC GAMES LIKE THIS ALIVE!"
,motley666,2010-10-03T19:37Z,Most of these dos games are free from abandonware sites.
,careyfleet,2010-10-04T08:36Z,"@motley666 thats right, they are. But they don't do it nearly as well as I do. These torrents have been optimised so that you can play these dos games within a minute of downloading it, also a 5 year old could follow these instructions and complete them successfully. If you don't like going through the hassle of figuring out DOSBox or downloading the right version, which game is which.... etc then my torrents are for you! Simple."
,motley666,2010-10-05T03:02Z,"I have many dos games that i used to play and i use dosbox, i find it easy to run once i got used to, i was using dos back in the days. Good work though, many users will find helpful what you do."
