Great movie otherwise. There's some parts that feel a bit rushed and lacking(mainly the middle of the movie), but the ending sequence does its job in wrapping things up and leaving me glad I watched it.

Only other thing I'd like to mention is that little kids may not enjoy this, as it is a bit scary at times :/"
