Hi John...
Your movie collection is extra ordinary and outstanding! You must have spend a lot of time and afford to collect all of these treasures. 

I love the movies with Rita Hayworth you collected.

Also looking for a movie which does not go out of my mind, but I can't fine it, maybe you have other resources.... It is: Catch a Falling Star (TV 2000)  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175245/ 

with best regards,
Rudi
