,KingKezia,2010-10-12T06:56Z,"It IS region free according to abgx360. No point posting the report because I changed the wave to Wave 2 so errors come up. Everything was fine the first time though, I just don't have the original .iso any more."

,liddellpower,2010-10-26T14:57Z,"DL was fast for me. 
Checked in ABGX and burned in OSx360.
Didnt work for me, burnt 35 games so far using this method and never had any problems, but with this one it just said ""open/close"" when I had the disc in. Might be burner issues so I'l dl again and burn once more.

Any1 else have any luck: comment."

Be sure to Run through ABGX before burning to disk as it will need to update certain files to be stealthed properly.  HAVE FUN!
