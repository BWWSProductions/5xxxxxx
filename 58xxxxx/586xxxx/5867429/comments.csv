,Pinkertow,2010-10-05T12:20Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT.

It downloaded fast, but the encode is all over the place. It skips, it jumps, the soundtrack goes missing, it repeats sections. Really weird. Go for one of the other ones. I'm sorry to the uploader, but it's not worth the time."
,k.a.b.,2010-10-05T14:53Z,"This Torrent is sock
I have downloaded alot of Torrents from you
but this suck the sound is suck and some parts repeats....
but the quality is good....
Pleace make sure before you upload something next time"
,Pinkertow,2010-10-05T15:21Z,"Again no offence to the uploader, a lot of us rely on this place to watch WWE. But the soundtrack is off for 90% of this video, making it nearly unwatchable."
,the-dude1982,2010-10-05T20:54Z,"amanrulz,WTF was that?
No offence but this torrent was piece of shit,sound repeated & some scenes skips through.
please if you're going to upload any wwe torrent,make sure you dont upload it like this :)"
