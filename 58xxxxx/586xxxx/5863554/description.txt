Mein Kampf - Full Audio Book English



Mein Kampf Full Audio Book English (mp3)

For the first time in 65 years, a modern, easy to understand, truly complete and uncensored edition of Mein Kampf has been released which reveals more than any past translation.

This book is also the first translation available in an English language audio format.

Older translations altered passages, omitted passages, mistranslated Hitlers words, made some parts more sensational while concealing the true meaning in other parts of the book.

If you have read one of these older translations of Mein Kampf, then you have not read the REAL Mein Kampf which is found only in the Ford Translation.

Mein Kampf is often portrayed as nothing more than an Anti-Semitic work, however only 6% of it even talks about the Jews.

The rest contains Hitlers ideas and beliefs for a greater nation plus his plan on how to accomplish that goal.

He outlines his plans for not only world conquest, but the conquest of the universe.

The majority of the work involves Hitlers discussion of the German peoples difficult times after the First World War, his political theories and his organization of the Nazi Party, as well as many attacks against his enemies which makes it a very interesting and moving story.

Mein Kampf offers an interesting interpretation of politics, people, and foreign policy matters.

To characterize it as simply a racist work is to oversimplify its message.

Germany did not follow Hitler because he was a racist, they followed him because he promised a great future, and Mein Kampf is where he promised that great future.

This edition is the only accurate and complete English translation of Mein Kampf ever made.
