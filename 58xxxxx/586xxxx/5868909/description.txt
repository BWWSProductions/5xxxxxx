WINDOWS SERVER 2008 R2 "DIRECTOR'S CUT" EDITION

WHAT'S NEW ?

[b]Works with : Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese-Hong Kong SAR, Chinese-Simplified, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese-Brazil, Portuguese-Portugal, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, and Ukrainian

The major improvement of this edition is that all W7 Extras to get R2 to look like W7 work with the above mentioned LP's !

I previously made the same type of release but the mistake I made was to integrate LP instead of just integrating the MUI files from W7.  :lol:  :lol:  :lol: 

This way all languages can be added to the base release without having extra ones installed that you do not need.
