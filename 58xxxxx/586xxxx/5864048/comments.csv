Audio sounds tinny at max vol; picture is slightly blurry but decent. Overall, quality is not the best but still watchable if the audio doesn't annoy you too much. Can't compare to previous versions as I haven't watched them, so this might be a harsher scoring than it should. Thanks anyway, uploader"

The audio really annoyed me as I cudnt get half the stuff...plus the movie ends abruptly before the narration ends...probably a min before the end of the movie...

However, Thanks for the early upload"
