Pink Floyd were an English rock band who earned international recognition for their
psychedelic rock music in the late 1960s, and for their progressive rock music from the
1970s onward. Their work is marked by the use of philosophical lyrics, sonic
experimentation, innovative album art, and elaborate live shows. One of rock music's most
critically acclaimed and commercially successful acts, the group have sold over 200 million
albums worldwide, including 74.5 million certified units in the United States, making them
one of the best-selling music artists of all time...
