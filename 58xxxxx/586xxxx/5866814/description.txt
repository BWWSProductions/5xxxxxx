Amazon Review:
In 1993, when Shaggy successfully reworked the Prince Buster ska classic "Oh Carolina," he was on the cusp of creating a hot, new ska/pop fusion. Unfortunately, he opted to become a pop-reggae novelty act like Snow. Shaggy's fourth album certainly won't win over new fans or appeal to reggae purists and Capleton enthusiasts, but that's fine by him. While there are no immediate club anthems in the "Boombastic" or "Oh Carolina" vein, Shaggy's coarse vocal delivery shines on the sweet, Latin-music-inspired "Chica Bonita." Likewise, "Not Fair"--where he boasts that he'll take a woman "to the clouds without going downtown"--has Hit Single written all over it. On the downside, Shaggy's rap-reggae flow doesn't match the production values of the R&B production duo Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. On "Lonely Lover," Shaggy and Next's T-Lo bastardize a classic Main Ingredient song, while on "Dance and Shout," he distorts the Michael Jackson legacy by sampling "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)."

Allmusic Review:
Shaggy's fourth album is a classic hybrid of reggae, R&B, and pop. Following duets with Maxi Priest ("That Girl") and Janet Jackson ("Luv Me, Luv Me"), the Jamaica native teams up with master producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and a myriad of talented guest vocalists who complement his personality on each track. Coming with the minor hit "Hope" from 1999's For Love of the Game soundtrack, the first couple of singles, "Dance and Shout" (featuring a Michael Jackson sample) and "It Wasn't Me," show the strengths of this album â€” they are smart, warm, and playful. Shaggy's persona is hard to not like. On "It Wasn't Me," a friend laments being caught by his girl with another woman; Shaggy continually advises him to flatly deny it. To be able to use that sentiment and still seem likable is a gift. There are such heavy samples, some of the tracks almost sound like remakes at points, but there is such originality and gifted wordplay that the combination works as opposed to seeming unoriginal â€” something most rappers can't seem to accomplish. Each song on Hot Shot from the opening title track on is different, inviting, and infectious. [The German release changes the track order and adds the bonus track "Joy You Bring"]
