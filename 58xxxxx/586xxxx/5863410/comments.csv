Has NO one heard of General Relativity around here?  Gravity isn't a ""force"" to be countered like the other three fundamental forces (electromagnetic and weak and strong nuclear)  Gravity is simply the effect of objects moving through geometrically curved spacetime.  

Not only that, but gravity is ALWAYS attractive.  It has to be, because otherwise it wouldn't have any net effect on objects since it's so much weaker than the other three ""forces""."

Not that I'm a believer in the ""free energy"" devices being peddled by charlatans but there's more to this than you're making out.  Certainly you're aware of ""dark energy.""  It isn't well understood but appears to make up 70% of all energy/mass (You brought up relativity and that shows us that mass and energy are basically the same thing) in the universe.  Since it is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate it could be likened to a kind of anti-gravity.  Furthermore, gravity is not well understood at all.  The other forces have been unified but because gravity remains so mysterious to scientists they have failed to adequately work it into those equations.  There's still a lot to be learned about gravity.  It isn't a closed book like you are making out.  Perhaps if and when the hypothetical and elusive graviton is discovered (Or is proven to be fictional) we'll have more of a complete picture."
