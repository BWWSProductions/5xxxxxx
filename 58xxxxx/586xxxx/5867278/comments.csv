,Sir.Smokez.Alot,2011-03-03T06:13Z,"Holy shit... Not only am I smarter then I thought but I once again figured a torrent out for myself... Meh, who needs instructions, just start pressin buttons til things work. Scratch that last comment, this torrent is perfectly fine you just need to figure it out without instructions. Send me a message and I'll tell you how to do it if anyone runs into the stupidity I ran into."
