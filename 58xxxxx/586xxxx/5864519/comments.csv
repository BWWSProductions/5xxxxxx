[T],lilmjkl,2010-10-08T09:55Z,You have to say that it is BDrip not a BR. BDrip is Blu-ray Disc rip.
,nightprowler.,2010-10-10T03:26Z,"Just curious lilmjkl is there really a difference between ""BluRay Rip"" and ""BluRay Disc Rip""? "
,arian25,2010-10-23T21:47Z,@nightprowler- BDRip = Directly from the Bluray Disc & BRRip = Rip of a high quality BDRip[1080p/8GB+(though there's no strict definition of HQ BDRip)]
