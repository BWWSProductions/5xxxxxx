,abmot,2010-10-14T04:49Z,a good print but not clear voice and picture is cut by side.
,drbetico,2011-01-29T04:21Z,"The quality is bad. It was recorded from a cinema with a non wide screen camera so it is just a fraction of the original size. Not worth it to download.
Audio is also crap and video quality is like 4/10.
Absolutely not worth it.
Lets just wait until comes available on DVD or Blue Ray. It looks like the movie has potential for the special effects.
Cheers"
