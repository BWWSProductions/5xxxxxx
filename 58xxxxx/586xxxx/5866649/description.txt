- Picking Lula's Replacement: Brazil's Presidential Race Heads to Runoff

In Brazil, some 135 million voters cast ballots on Sunday in a closely watched presidential election. Dilma Rousseff, the leading candidate to succeed President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, won the race but failed to gain the 50 percent of votes needed for an outright victory. If Rousseff wins the runoff, she will become the first woman to lead Brazil, the world's fourth most populous democracy. For the last five years, Rousseff has served as Lula's chief of staff. During the 1960s and 1970s, she was involved in the armed struggle against Brazil's military dictatorship. She was imprisoned for nearly three years and tortured.


- Harry Belafonte: Iraq & Afghanistan Wars Are "Immoral, Unconscionable and Unwinnable"

"The President's decision to escalate the war in that region alone costs the nation $33 billion," the legendary musician, actor and activist Harry Belafonte said at Saturday's "One Nation Working Together" in Washington. "That sum of money could not only create 600,000 jobs here in America but would even leave us a few billion to start rebuilding our schools, our roads, our hospitals and affordable housing. It could also help to rebuild the lives of the thousands of our returning wounded veterans."


- Voices from the "One Nation Working Together" Rally for Jobs and Justice

Tens of thousands of people gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, on Saturday to rally for progressive causes. More than 400 groups, including labor unions, as well as civil rights, gay rights, and environmental groups, endorsed the "One Nation Working Together" rally. Organizers said the gathering drew a crowd of 175,000 people. The focus of the day was jobs, justice and education for all. The rally's sponsors said they also hoped to demonstrate that they, not the tea party, represented the nation's majority. Speakers included Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president of the Children's Defense Fund; deaf student organizer Colin Whited; and AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.


- News Dissector Danny Schechter: Saturday's "One Nation" March on Washington Was "More Movie than Movement"

"Sadly, the One Nation that came together in Washington was not there to be organized into an ongoing force," writes longtime media analyst Danny Schechter. "No follow-up program was announced, no emails collected, no vision on how to turn all that energy on the Mall into a powerful progressive alternative to the tea party was offered. No longer march strategy was announced. It was a moment in itself not for anything more."
