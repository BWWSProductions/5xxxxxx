From Wiki:

Like much of Roth's fiction, this book confronts the tenuous 
relationship between an author and his artistic creations. It resumes 
the story of Roth's fictional alter ego Nathan Zuckerman that was 
inaugurated in Roth's previous novel The Ghost Writer.

The novel parallels several real events in Roth's life, including the 
publication of his 1969 novel Portnoy's Complaint and the hoopla which 
surrounded Roth in the wake of that novel's fame. By analogy, in 
Zuckerman Unbound, Zuckerman has achieved meteoric acclaim and notoriety 
with "Carnovsky", a coming-of-age sex romp that differs remarkably from 
Zuckerman's previously Jamesian fiction. The extent to which the details 
of the Zuckerman character can be safely compared to those of Roth has 
been a subject of zealous debate among Roth's readers. Roth himself has 
weighed in on the debate, both in interviews and within his fiction.

From Recorded Books:

Philip Roth is one of the most acclaimed American authors of the 20th 
century. His Zuckerman novels, based on the "fictional" exploits of 
emotionally conflicted Jewish novelist, Nathan Zuckerman, are a splendid 
mix of comedy and tragedy. Zuckerman Unbound considers the problem of 
artistic triumph born of domestic upheaval. Rothâ€™s prose finds an 
extraordinary complement with George Guidallâ€™s robust narration.
