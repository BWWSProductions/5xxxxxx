I know that i accepted your request for lord of the rings trilogy but i didn't know that riddlerA uploaded them already so try these 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5469507/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_I_%282001%29Extd_Edition_720p_x264_by_RiddlerA

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5471029/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_II_%282002%29Extd_Ed_720p_x264_by_RiddlerA

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5472865/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_III_%282003%29_Extd_Ed_720p_x264_by_RiddlerA

Riddler is the top uploader on tpb so the quality will be great, so i will appreciate it if you can cancel your request and download these instead because it doesn't make sense for me to encode almost replicas of the ones riddler uploaded but if you still want me to do them i will keep them on my list 

@All
this is why i ask you to search before requesting "

,smasudi,2010-10-06T13:56Z,@gunnersrock.. i found 300mb united very useful..but it doesnt have resume support.. am i right..is there something we can do about it..
[T],gunnersrock,2010-10-06T19:03Z,"@smasudi
yes you can't resume but you can download a freeware called ""free rapid downloader"" and add various links from host sites to it and it will download files in the background without you having to download each file manually "
