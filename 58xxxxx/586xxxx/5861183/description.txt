The Totally Rad Show is a formerly weekly, now daily video podcast produced by Team Awesome, LLC and distributed by Revision3. It consists primarily of reviews and reminiscences of pop-culture phenomena such as movies, video games, television programs, and comic books.

Big Fan of the show but not a fan of the new daily format. I liked to be able to download one show at the end of the week with all the content in 1 single download. Why they don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t offer this at the end of the week is beyond me. 

Either way Im doing it myself every week and sharing it with you guys. I remove most ads I just leave the ads from the first and last show of the week. The ads after every daily episode is overkill IMO. Only 1 intro and outro removed them from each segment. I did this fast so im sure there are mistakes just point it out and i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll try to make sure I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t do it again next week. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll try to get these out every monday if the demand is high. Enjoy The Totally Rad Show Weekly.
