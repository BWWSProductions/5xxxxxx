This show deals with the economic crisis around the globe and the deteriorating conditions. But there is a particular place which is doing relatively well and people are spurred to put their money in that country. That is Norway. The rise of precious metals and the reasons behind it is discussed. More and more people are turning into buying gold. The rise in the price of food and agri-products is also discussed.



This is extracted audio from the Press TV video.

For this torrent I have also included the video, joined in one file.  If you don't want to download this file, simply deselect it in your bit torrent client when you are initiating the download.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
