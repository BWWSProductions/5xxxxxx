I was surprised, that a Rajnikanth release did not have any seeder, till I noticed that ALL your up's of today are down.

It would be a pity though to not watch Endhiran on big screen.

[The last line above, in no way reflects on you Brego or the torrent..
its about the frenzy of the sci-fi movie and the aura of Rajni.. thats what I meant]

@ brego-
none of the torrents you up'ed today [2010-10-02] have even one seeder. is your machine off line, i wonder!

anyways keep up the good ""bad boy"" work.

cant leech [or seed] till you connect."
