,rayr_1,2010-10-05T00:10Z,Thanks as always. This will update the previous chattChitto upload.
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2010-10-05T16:30Z,"Thanks CC. Installed fine. It downloaded no problema yesterday, and I don't understand why it now shows 0 SE and 0 LE on TPB. Maybe that's their system's hiccup."
,yornotelppa,2010-10-06T14:40Z,Unfortunately this version doesn't work for me. Loads fine but it doesn't recognize any disk.  Even downloaded 8.02.2 from web site and applied the hack and that doesn't work either. Have to go back to your version 7.
,Outback6,2010-10-06T23:30Z,"I'm having the same problem as yornotelppa.  DVDFab runs, but doesn't recognize any DVDs.  Going back to 8.0.0.5 and dealing with the crashes for now."
,xguntherc,2010-10-07T02:35Z,"I've used CC in the past. But I'll also comment. It was a clean file, But it also doesn't work for me. When loading DVD it just goes blank. I'm running Win 7 64bit. and a GTX 480"

,ryan1476,2010-10-09T22:16Z,"it works before you apply the crack  ...after you apply it , it donesnt work...use the other 8.0.2.2 in the torrent list...works like  a charm"
,azpitbull,2010-10-13T05:39Z,C.C. I have always looked for and obtained files that you have worked on as you have been a positive force in things that i am able to accomplish. Something in this 8.0.2.2. doesn't work correctly. I am running XP SP3. I hope to see more great things from you. The other 8.0.2.2 on the PB list works great. Thanks C.C. for all that you do
