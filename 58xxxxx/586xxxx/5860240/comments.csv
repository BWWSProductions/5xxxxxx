[H],politux,2010-10-02T09:36Z,"I has over 1,000 seeds right now.  There is a problem with the way TPB is reporting seed/peer counts right now.  If you look at other recent torrents they all say 0/0 when in fact the swarms are large and healthy.  My guess is this is related to the OpenBitTorrent and PublicBT treacker outages.

If you read torrentfreak.com you learn stuff.  

Have a nice day."
