Here is my FINAL Dragon Age: Origins DLC Pack, updated to include the latest DLC (Witch Hunt v1.1), current as of 20 September 2010.

This is EVERY official DLC for the game, including all pre-order promo items and post-release addons.  Bioware has confirmed that there will be no more new DLC, so this is it mateys.

***PLEASE READ***

ATTENTION: If you are getting an error while installing the DLC, it is most likely because the encoding of AddIns.xml was changed to ANSI or another incompatible format.  To fix this, open up AddIns.xml in Notepad, go to File->Save As... and MAKE SURE the encoding is set to UTF-8.  Save AddIns.xml in the same spot, overwriting the original.  This should fix your installation problems.  If it doesn\'t, your next option is to delete both AddIns.xml and Manifest.xml.  Note that you will have to reinstall ALL DLC again, including the Awakening expansion if you have it.  Use this as last resort.

-=-=Installation=-=-

1. If not already, update your game to v1.04 using the included patch.  You MUST do this for the newer DLC to work!  If needed, use the included No-CD crack.  Place the .exe file in the \"bin_ship\" folder where you installed the game, overwriting the original.
2. Locate and run daupdater.exe in the \"bin_ship\" folder where you installed the game.
3. Click \"Select DAZIPs\" and select the files for the DLC you wish to install. The files for each DLC item are listed in the parenthesis.
4. Highlight all the files in the list and click \"Install Selected\"
5. Upon completion, run decrypt_all.bat from the \"DLC Decrypter\" folder of this torrent. Not all the DLC requires decryption but run it to be sure.
6. Locate AddIns.xml in \"C:/Users/(Username)/Documents/Bioware/Dragon Age/Settings\" and edit it using Notepad. Replace all RequiresAuthorization=\"1\" with RequiresAuthorization=\"0\".  An easy way to do this is to use the Replace function (CTRL-H).
7. Run the game and check to see if everything worked!

Cheers!

NOTE: Some of the newer DLC requires the game to be updated to v1.04. This is done by running the included patch. Be sure to use the included v1.04 No CD Patch after you have finished updating if you so require it.

NOTE: I would recommend using the Blood Dragon Armor v1.0 instead of v1.1. The v1.1 has reduced stats and is only good for fixing a glitch when playing a Female Elf character. If you wish to use v1.1, the appropriate DAZIP is located in a seperate folder.
