,Tar2,2010-10-06T15:51Z,Run the game before installing any DLCs. This will create the necessary files.
,Bajue,2010-10-07T13:08Z,"i have run the game the onlyones that don't install for me are the Golem of Amgarrak, both Feastdays, The Darkspawn Chronicles, Witch Hunt and Leliana's Song. it Keeps saying Error when it trys to install them."

Everything dloaded and installed fine, but when i tried to start the game im getting an error about not having the right disk.

can it be because i havent finished downloading the entire torrent? i still have a few files left to download, and those are the ones i need to play the other side campaigns, so i havent tried to see if they work yet. "
,King_Nothingo.O?,2010-10-22T13:36Z,"@ dANGER_boy

Over time, I dled all your DLC Packs from TPB and they've been working just fine.
But when I downloaded Witch Hunt today and tried to install it on my Win7 machine (as Admin of course) like I did with the ones before, the DLC Decryption Tool somehow didn't work, it alway shows the error message

""the commad ""dedaodrm.exe"" is either spelled wrong or could not be found""

(could be slightly different because I'm translating from German)

I tried reinstalling the whole game, and putting the DLCs back in, the same order I did before using the same DLC Decryption Tools, but they now showed the same error message.

I even dled another Decryption Tool out of a different torrent of yours, still no luck.

And now I'm running out of ideas ... can you help pls?

Cheers,

"
,King_Nothingo.O?,2010-10-22T14:13Z,"EDIT:

I forgot to mention that this error manifests as ""unable to load area"" in-game, obviously because the DLCs haven't been decrypted."
,VampireXDi,2010-10-24T16:11Z,hey i have a question. I downloaded the full game and the expansion awakening almost a year ago and have the dlcs and i also have leliana's song. I downloaded witch hunt and i noticed i needed to patch the game to the recent patch and i downloaded the patch from the bioware site and what happened was i couldnt open the game it said that it required the disk and i obviously don't have the disk for the game but i couldnt load the game at all with the patch so i had to uninstall everything and install it again. Since this torrent has the patch included would i have that problem? Because i really want to check out the witch hunt dlc. thanks
,Kale_z,2010-10-24T18:10Z,Is the Dragon Age Origins: Awakening included?
,VampireXDi,2010-10-25T01:00Z,yes it is.

,KrystalinKuppicakes,2010-10-27T09:04Z,"I downloaded the game a while back and I just downloaded this. I'm having a problem like someone else. It says that I need the disk, but like them, I don't have it. I tired this once, getting the actual patch off the website but it broke my game. I don't want to go through uninstalling it and losing all my mods again"

,Brad88,2010-10-30T22:29Z,"hmm i have a noob question :D

i have dragon age origins in my PC and without all those expansions and DLC installed....

so do i have to install them first before i install this or should i just install this directly given that i didn't have a single DLC installed in my game?
should this still work?...."

,Voipx4,2010-11-03T20:40Z,"Great Torrent, but I've been having an issue ever since I downloaded this all of my movies are going in fast forward. I get voice overs overlapping each other or like the intro to the Darkspawn Chronicals goes by so fast you can't even read any of the subtitles. Does anyone know how to fix this or what it may be cause from?"
,Voipx4,2010-11-03T22:34Z,"To help anyone that may be having the same issue as me with videos moving to fast or your game being jumpy I found a solution to fix it.

It can run too fast on dual-processor systems, making everyone bounce around hyperactively. Can be fixed by pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL, going to ""processes"", right-clicking on daorigins.exe (which is probably eating 100% of the CPU), selecting ""Affinity"", then making sure that only one CPU is selected (e.g. CPU0). You have to do this each time you run the game (including after crashes). "
,simontjuhh,2010-11-07T12:00Z,"installed perfectly, no trouble at all! the only thing i bumped into (all my fault, nothing to blame on dANGER_boy) was that i searched for RequiresAuthorization=\""1\"". While i needed to look for RequiresAuthorization=""1"". for the rest it was piece of cake!

,Eazy G,2010-11-07T14:03Z,"BS, awakening is not includen thus not complete"
,Eazy G,2010-11-07T17:16Z,but still high quality torrent !
,dANGER_boy,2010-11-09T03:55Z,"@Eazy G
Awakening is not DLC, thus it is not included.  It was an expansion sold separately on a completely different disc.  DLC stands for ""downloadable content.""  Since Awakening does not classify as that, I have not included it."
,SGT_artillary,2010-11-09T06:56Z,everything is installed including awakening and all dlc was added following your instructions but i do not see anywhere in this torrent that includes the no CD crack .exe application all I have in the torrent was the update application and 2 applications inside the decrypter folder which one is the decryptor that ran fine and worked but the other just opens a dos like window and disapears instantaneously... also all the DLC like wardens keep are unathorized when i check the installed addons page... any help with a v1.04 no cd crack and the rest of these issues im having? I really appreciate the upload great work.
,SGT_artillary,2010-11-09T07:07Z,Ok i think i fixed the unathorized files by doing what you said chaning 1's to 0's... but the only no cd crack file included in this torrent is this No CD Crack v1.04.7z which says its a .7z file. Any suggestions? again thank you for the help
,xmm0,2010-11-10T14:02Z,You upload the best dANGER_boy! Thank you!
,dANGER_boy,2010-11-10T23:04Z,"@SGT_artillary
.7z is a compression protocol, just like ZIP and RAR.  It is open-source and usually gets better compression rates than the other formats.  However, it is not as widely used currently.  WinRAR is able to open and extract .7z files.  If you don't have a registered copy of WinRAR, download the latest version of 7-zip for free and extract daorigins.exe that way."
,SGT_artillary,2010-11-11T00:56Z,"MASTERPIECE! Works flawlessly, I have not played the V1.04 yet but i just updated and everything checks out on DLC tab. I did notice some crashing with the old V1.03 but that could have been fixed with this patch, if not you cannot beat it for demo;ing the game. This game is well worth the money its in the stores for so anyone downloading this and enjoying the game should go pay tribute by buying a copy so these developers can continue to produce awesome high quality gaming experiences for all of us RPGers. WELL DONE with the packing of this torrent and walkthroughs and not to mentions stellar fast feedback. GREAT JOB bud, pat yourself on the back for this one."
,adremar,2010-11-14T09:45Z,"great torrent!.. i have problem updating the game to v1.04, it says that ""the patch failed to apply because a file to be updated was different from the expected version"". can anyone help me with this?"

No, there is nothing on the ultimate edition that isn't included here beside the original game and the Awakening expansion.  In fact, this pack includes items NOT found in the Ultimate edition because they are promo items you got only from pre-ordering."

,dANGER_boy,2010-11-19T07:07Z,"@Mary-J-I420l
Read above post.  This is only the DLC, not the game.  There was no need to create a torrent with the game or Awakening expansion because there are plenty out there to choose from.  As far as I know, I am the only active cracker of the DLC since Return to Ostagar, so I have taken charge of the DLC, so to speak.  You will need the original game to use these DLC."

Hey thanks for this torrent but was hoping you could help with one problem which me and a few others seem to be having.

The Dlc decyrpter isn't working. An ms dos window pops up and closes straight away when using the application in the folder. This leavws the dlc still encyrpted and unable to play despite being technically installed. It appears in game as ' unable to load area/module'.
 Any ideas on howto fix?"
,dANGER_boy,2010-11-22T06:02Z,"@gillz525
Sorry, I'm not sure what the problem is.  Remember to run ""decrypt_all.bat"" and not the .exe file.  Try running this as an administrator.  I've heard that for some people you have to specific a file path but I'm not certain on that.  I'll look into it."
,gillz525,2010-11-22T20:34Z,"Hey just got it working so thought i'd leave a message in case anyoen else hasn't yet. 
Open/ run the bat file and copy all the text.
Close the file then re open as cmd.
right click and paste in the text you copied and away it goes.

,TorrentialFury,2010-11-29T21:43Z,"Nevermind the previous comment, problem solved. For anyone else that may have the problem, create a new character save in the game, then the new save file should be in MyComputer/DiskC:/DocumentsandSettings/Administrator/MyDocuments/Bioware/DragonAge/Characters.

First, CAPS LOCK is generally not a good way to win people's hearts on the internet.  But seeing as how you were probably born in 1995 like your username suggests, I guess we can forgive you.

Second, I'm fairly certain this is a torrent.  Considering it has to be to be on The Pirate Bay, I've got technology on my side.  Get a client that works, such as uTorrent.  If that doesn't fix your problem, get a new computer.

Thirds, follow the instructions.  There is no installer included in the torrent because it is installed with the game.  Read the instructions rather than expecting everything to be spoonfed to you."

ATTENTION: If you are getting an error while installing the DLC, it is most likely because the encoding of AddIns.xml was changed to ANSI or another incompatible format.  To fix this, open up AddIns.xml in Notepad, go to File->Save As... and MAKE SURE the encoding is set to UTF-8.  Save AddIns.xml in the same spot, overwriting the original.  This should fix your installation problems.  If it doesn\'t, your next option is to delete both AddIns.xml and Manifest.xml.  Note that you will have to reinstall ALL DLC again, including the Awakening expansion if you have it.  Use this as last resort.""

4. Right-click the DAZIP and select install (they can be found in the bottom window)

,vincentdesrd,2011-01-24T05:10Z,"Ok to answer my own question: 

It's fine to use with a copy of Dragon Age from Steam. 

I launched Dragon Age, all the DLCs are installed and enabled and I'm even connected to EA and didn't get any error message."

@squirrelyj05
Reinstall your game.

@vimpaler & rvirk
For Christ's sake, read the directions.  And I quote directly:
""If not already, update your game to v1.04 using the included patch.  You MUST do this for the newer DLC to work!  If needed, use the included No-CD crack.""
The update overwrites any previous executables, installing one that requires a CD check.  Anybody that follows the directions to the letter shouldn't have problems."

I tried the fix on this site:

still the same thing.
A bit of help would be greatly appreciated.

 am not having the best of luck with this, I believe I must be missing something really simple. 

I downloaded and installed every step to my knowledge correctly but whenever I load the game nothing worked and my Awakening expansion pack is missing and not available for playing. It stills says it's installed when I go to the configure settings but when i go to play it's not available under other campaigns, nothing is, you can't even select it.

 I did make one foolish mistake though, but that was easily fixed hehe.

 If anyone is having problems getting the extra content to appear in-game, make sure you didn't just replace all the 1's with 0's in that Addin.xlm file!

 Do ctrl+H as recommened, and paste in RequiresAuthorization=""1"" to be replaced by RequiresAuthorization=""0""

 NOT JUST THE NUMBERS!!

This torrent has worked wonderfully as far as the main game goes. But after installing the DLCs, authorizing them and decrypting them, I find myself unable to use them. When I click on ""Other Campaigns"" it asks to create a new character, import one from another module, etc... Once I select/create the character a message instantly shows saying, ""Unable to load area."" Is there anything that can be done to fix this problem?"

Open the "".bat"" file and copy its contents.(All of it.)
Open the command prompt and paste the information there.

Your DLC should be working.
I only tried the ""Darkspawn Chronicles"" DLC. It was great and I loved the ""alternative end"" to the game. xD
""What if the Darkspawn had won the battle and the Archdemon was not killed?"" Well just try the DLC and you'll see.(Hey! It kind of rhymes. Ha ha ha!)

,11Ace11,2011-08-07T12:44Z,"It took me a couple of hour to figure this out, hope it helps.

Before you try to install this, make sure you have installed the dragon age origins game, also make sure you start a game, otherwise the settings folder, in Addins will not be created.

Install the update in this torrent. v1.04 patch.

Then go into your dragon age origins folder on the C drive and run daupdater.exe, select dazips, then locate the dlc files on this torrent and select them all. then select them all in daupdater and install selected.

run the decryptall.bat on this torrent.

Locate AddIns.xml in \""C:/Users/(Username)/Documents/Bioware/Dragon Age/Settings\"" and edit it using Notepad. Replace all RequiresAuthorization=\""1\"" with RequiresAuthorization=\""0\"".  An easy way to do this is to use the Replace function (CTRL-H).

(THIS FILE WILL ONLY SHOW IF YOU HAVE STARTED A GAME OF DAO,)

MAKE SURE BEFORE YOU START YOU COPY THE NO-CD CRACK FROM THIS TORRENT TO YOUR bin-ship file and replace.

,shipz2640,2011-09-18T00:49Z,@Lukelo I have always had that same problem with DAO as well. It's one of the reasons why I've never completed this game. Every time I've tried to play it I'd get 20-30 hours into the story (maybe about half way) and I would start getting crashes every few minutes.
,kneza,2011-09-22T00:05Z,"I did everything you said, and even replaced RequiresAuthorization=\""1\"" but when i try to run the game it says: ""could not run dragon age. Please insert the disk and try again"". Please help someone?"
,Elokai,2011-10-23T16:17Z,"Please help, i have tried everything with the dlc pack, some work very well, but the one i want said that needs autorization, like leliana song and witch hunt, please, someone could tell me what to do?"
,linhmabu1,2011-10-28T07:14Z,"OMG!!! it awesome,thank a lot men :)"
,frizz514,2011-11-23T00:59Z,"@Elokai remember to change all RequiresAuthorization=""1"" to ""0"" on the AddIns.xml file in your Bioware/Dragon Age/Settings folder

btw if anybody else has problem with the decrypter like i did where it opens and closes instantly, do not open the dedaodrm.exe file, instead right clic decrypt_all.bat and select open and it will work"
,Bane357,2012-01-04T21:01Z,"Do I need DA AWAKENING to make this work?

Read the top of the description

***PLEASE READ***

ATTENTION: If you are getting an error while installing the DLC, it is most likely because the encoding of AddIns.xml was changed to ANSI or another incompatible format.  To fix this, open up AddIns.xml in Notepad, go to File->Save As... and MAKE SURE the encoding is set to UTF-8.  Save AddIns.xml in the same spot, overwriting the original.  This should fix your installation problems.  If it doesn\'t, your next option is to delete both AddIns.xml and Manifest.xml.  Note that you will have to reinstall ALL DLC again, including the Awakening expansion if you have it.  Use this as last resort."

,DoriSai,2012-03-25T10:14Z,Any chance you could upload a torrent of just the item DLCs?  I have the content packs already but particularly like the pre-order stuff and the collector's edition stuff I don't have and IDK how to get it to work on my game even if I could get it.

,rwjk,2012-03-31T04:56Z,"I have a slight problem but i dont know if its the DLC, to my knowledge i installed all the DLC correctly without errors, decrypted, and rewrite the Addins.xml and when i enter the downloadable content section in the game it showed it as installed. But when i talk to the man in the camp i say that id like to go to soldiers peak or whatever he says he'll show me the place on the map, but he never does, so i looked in the FAQs an the bioware site and i tried to use the debug command using the console but nothing opens, anyone have any suggestions on to how i can fix this?? O and one more thing the same thing happened when i was asked to find the urn of sacred ashes but i debuged it so it was ok."

I downloaded everything and the whole process ran just fine, but when I try to run the game it says that I need the disk. I know there's the no disc crack, but whenever I try to open it in WinRAR, I just get a notepad with a whole bunch of crazy symbols. How do I get the crack to work?"
