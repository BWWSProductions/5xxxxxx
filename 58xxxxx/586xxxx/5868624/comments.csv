,leon-of-teamtptb,2010-10-06T00:08Z,@kirank22 get fifa 11 from teamtptb*com take the * away and replace with a dot sign up to there web site its a private site but they do have open registration sometimes so give it a try after 24 hours as shroo says coz the site is down at the moment
,leon-of-teamtptb,2010-10-06T00:09Z,shit sorry bout second one the first dint show up sorry for di spam
,Vipe0713,2010-10-06T03:47Z,"@leon, how can i download from the site? i sign up awhile ago but can't download anything. i can d/l the torrent but the file won't."
,saddy_123,2010-10-06T06:29Z,@Vipe0713..i m myself a active member of there site site was down from yesterday at the moment so is there tracker i think we have wa8 for 24 hrs untill it will come back .my Darksiders torrent is stuck at 50%.:(
,leon-of-teamtptb,2010-10-06T13:37Z,@Vipe0713 i dont understand what u r saying sorry it says u can download the torrent but the file wont. the file wont what is what i dont understand if u have a bad ratio then thats why u cant get it so u need to seed your torrents 1:1 then any problems just ask the admins im sure they will help but if u have a bad ratio then that could be a problem and like i said i got the file from teamtptb and its a nice rip
,Vipe0713,2010-10-06T21:19Z,"@leon, yes the ratio is what i mean hehe.. i seed once awhile but still ratio wont change. do these torrents from this site help the ratio if i seed? or its only the ones from the TBTB site."
,leon-of-teamtptb,2010-10-06T22:22Z,@Vipe0713 no mate just from there site if i was u wait till site is back up find a torrent that u have from there and just seed till your ratio is ok then down load fifa or u could do what i do donate a little and that will boost your ratio a very lot i donate ÂŁ10 every 6 weeks im not saying u have too but even just 1 donation if u can afford it will help u out and the site a very lot and say u did donate just the once then u would be infront with your ratio and then just maintain your 1:1 ratio
,Vipe0713,2010-10-06T23:36Z,"ah ok, thxs alot man for the info."
