[V],SAFCukO09,2010-10-02T09:15Z,Still find it strange that people would rather wait until god knows when for an avi when after 20sec extract the avi is there

,dakty,2010-10-02T13:27Z,thx again for this upload! i don't have any problems with your rar files but some uploaders that use rar's will give a few problems when playing it afterwards (audio out of sync is just one of them)
