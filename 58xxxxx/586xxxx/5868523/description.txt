STORY
Soren, a young barn owl, is kidnapped by owls of St. Aggie's, ostensibly an orphanage, where owlets are brainwashed into becoming soldiers. He and his new friends escape to the island of Ga'Hoole, to assist its noble, wise owls who fight the army being created by the wicked rulers of St. Aggie's. The film is based on the first three books in the series.

IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Legend of the Guardians russian video..................Thanks
AUDIO:OWN

First we took the russian video, which wasn't too bad but had faults... lots of glares, too much chroma, weak contrast and cropped a fair bit. We tried to fix most of the stuff... increased the contrast, lowered the chroma, toned down the glares and we also resized it to give it a 0.1% AR error correction compared to it's 0.8% in it's original res. The cropping... well nothing we can do about that :lol: The audio is our own line... not the best we've had but decent enough and much better than the cam audio so... Syncing was a bitch aswell... not easy syncing to owls mouths :P
