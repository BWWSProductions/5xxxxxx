ADOBE ENCORE CS5 TRAINING DVD FOR WINDOWS & MAC (Exercise files included)

VTC Adobe Encore CS5.

Adobe Encore CS5 is the sister program that combines with the professional, real-time, digital linear, timeline based video editing software Adobe Premiere
Pro CS5 to author finished projects to DVD or Blu-ray disc, or to Flash based websites. Its simplicity of use belies its powerful feature set that allows not
only the creation of completed movies but also slideshow presentations. In this VTC project based course, you will not only learn essential theory behind DVD and Blu-ray disc creation, such as transcoding and bitrate budgeting, but you will also
see a practical element in that you will learn how to create a project from inception to finished output. Additionally, related Encore CS5 programs such as Adobe Soundbooth and Adobe Photoshop techniques are employed so that you can adapt your project to your specific requirements.
