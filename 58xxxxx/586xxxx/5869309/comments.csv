,deftones69,2010-10-06T21:51Z,"OOO Being that's its October and Halloween is right around the corner, How about some Horror collections! Texas Chainsaw Massacre's, Hannibal movies, and of course the Halloween's. 

Maybe even some Stephen King, George Romero, Dario Argento, John Carpenter movie packs, Just a suggestion.

Thanks and Keep up the great work!"
