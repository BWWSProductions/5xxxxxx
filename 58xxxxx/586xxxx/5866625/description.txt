A Sao Paolo forensic pathologist who fights boredom by dreaming up causes of death for those who have yet to pass away is called on to examine a most atypical corpse in this mystery from co-directors/co-screenwriters Rossana Foglia and Rubens Rewald. Artur is good at his job, but quick to lapse into daydreams. Asked to examine the inexplicably preserved corpse of a woman buried in a mass grave of protestors that had vanished during the military dictatorship of the 1970s, Artur is intrigued that the body is in much the same shape as it must have been thirty years ago. At first Artur suspects that the corpse is the mother of a young woman named Fernanda, but then he discovers that Fernanda's mother is still very much alive.
