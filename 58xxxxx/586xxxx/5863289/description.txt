Full Spectrum Sound Healing by Alex Theory



[FLAC]

Science has shown that sound frequencies occurring in nature can literally feed the brain, heal the body, and stimulate elevated levels of consciousness. â€œFull Spectrum Soundâ€ is an innovative therapeutic concept that uses these frequencies to promote health and wholeness from the cellular level up. With Full Spectrum Sound Healing, master ambient sound technician and composer Alex Theory offers a collection of four musically satisfying and powerfully healing albums based on the elements that make up our world. Designed for massage therapists, body workers, and practitioners in any sound healing modality, Full Spectrum Sound Healing includes:

Water



Water is the first music album to harness the resonant vibrations of life's most essential, natural element, using specially designed water chimes to produce soothing melodic tones rich in full spectrum therapeutic benefits. Through dynamic combinations of water based sounds, Water nourishes mind, body, and soul with natural harmonic frequencies, fostering bodily and spiritual health sonically in the same way that full spectrum light does visually. Composed by sound healing visionary Alex Theory, Water is a revolutionary new experience in musical composition, one that is rewarding both musically as well as for its profound restorative properties.

Light



What is the sound of light? To find out, innovative sound healer and musician Alex Theory created a one-of-a-kind set of ambient compositions captured on Lightâ€”the second installment in his soothing Full Spectrum Sound series. When white light shines through a crystal or water, it is split into its component parts and the rainbow is revealedâ€”a dynamic range of colors vital to our physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Using scientifically designed chimes and tuning forks that mathematically correspond to the electromagnetic wavelengths of each color, Theory translates the energy of light into sound. Light incorporates the principle of â€œsonic biomimicryâ€ by modeling these naturally occurring frequencies to support healing modalities such as massage, acupuncture, and bodywork. Here is an incredibly rich sonic tapestry that calms the senses and nurtures the spirit, ready to bathe you in an atmosphere of therapeutic radiance.

Earth



Every day, weâ€™re subject to countless man-made electromagnetic frequencies that can drain our energy and cloud our sense of well-being. With Earth, sonic pioneer Alex Theory spins the third disc in his â€œFull Spectrum Soundâ€ Healing series, giving you a powerful tool to help you relax, get deeply grounded, and re-align with the organic rhythms of our planet. Each ambient track on this album is embedded with the Schumann Resonance, the scientifically measurable electromagnetic frequency that naturally pervades and nourishes all life on earth.

Air



Breathe in the Airâ€”Alex Theoryâ€™s fourth installment in the â€œFull Spectrum Soundâ€ healing series. Using specially designed chimes scientifically based on the vibrational frequencies of oxygen molecules, this sonic technician invites listeners to relax into atmospheric layers of ambient sound for an expansive and healing experience.
