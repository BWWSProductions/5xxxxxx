,shorehamstreetskin,2010-10-05T21:08Z,Can some one please tell one why the gig size is 13 when the usual 360 game is 6 or 7 thanks
,Dimmis80,2010-10-06T04:29Z,I read in other torrents that u need both 2 Disks to play the game.U start with the first and play and swap with the second later to finish the game.Now about the 13.67 GB it seems that its a huge game/world and stuff..@AiTB thanks dude.
,TVProject,2010-10-06T04:38Z,It's 2 DVD game
,Dimmis80,2010-10-06T11:09Z,I want to ask to anyone who download this game about the burning of the 2 DVD-Images.I know about the clasick IMG Burn program and the burning of the Image/DVD but i am not sure about the 2 Disks.U just burn the image to a disk and then the second image DVD 2 to an another DL+R DVD and finaly u use the first DVD and then when the 360 asks for the second u use the second to continue the game.?Is it the correct prosses.??Thanks in advance.

Just a question, I've downloaded 3 games this week, and non of them is installing on the xbox, all reaching 35% and thena msg sayin ""Can't read this disk. It may be scratched or dirty. Clean the disc with a soft cloth and try again"". all games are playable, but can't install.
By the way one mre thing, some of the cutscenes in the game are not revealed, example when he met Pan and also after killing the Ice Titan, the videos aren't playing, it directly shifts me to gameplay???? any help guys"
