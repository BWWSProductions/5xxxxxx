Although there really wasnt anyone at the beach since we have been going through a cold spell Tony was still able to rustle up Aghatha. She was at the beach trying to enjoy her time there but the chill in the air really was stopping her from having a good time. So I graciously offered my heated pool back at my house. She was a bit reluctant at first but we both could tell she was all about having a good time. I mean why else would a girl attempt to hit the beach in the middle of such cold weather.
