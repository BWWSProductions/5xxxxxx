,dragoduval,2010-10-01T22:57Z,thanks for the game :)
,GRN84,2010-10-31T15:31Z,This isnt working for me. When I open the app there are only razor messages e nothing else... never get to the game...  
,kedeviss,2010-12-24T00:27Z,"@GRN84 and anyone else who has this problem, I got stuck here as well, what you need to do is run it first time as admin, once you've done that, you can just hit esc to jump past that razor bit into the actual game"
,upsurge,2010-12-24T17:23Z,"the 1911.dll would not copy... it first ask to allow copying as an admin, but then fails to get copied... it brings the ""try agian / skip"" window again and again...
Any solutions???"
