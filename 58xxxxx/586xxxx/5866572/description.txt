I am disillusioned enough to know that no man's opinion on any subject
is worth a damn unless backed up with enough genuine information to
make him really know what he's talking about. - HP Lovecraft

Requests (or re-seed requests) should be posted in [COMMENTS] section of newest torrents.
"Out of schedule" shows or pilot-episodes may get uploaded randomly, if circumstances allow (i.e. free slots open up).

Do NOT bother requesting easily available titles. If I haven't encoded something new and current - I have my reasons for that.

Do NOT request movies which have IMDB score lower than 4.4.

Do NOT request inclusion of TV shows in my schedule; that's my call. The removal of some show depends on many factors, however, be sure that shows would be dropped if I spot lack of interest, hungry hard-fisting crowd or too high a number of Hit and Runs. These decisions are my own.
