,nic25magg,2011-06-25T07:55Z,"This Download is fake. There is no executable file to run the game and no shortcut on the desktop!!!!

I search for its executable file and when i run it, the screen remains black forever!!!!

Don't download it!!"
,nic25magg,2011-06-26T14:11Z,"Sorry, My fault, This game works perfectly @ 100%%

My Antivirus (COMODO) has quarantined the file bin.exe before it is run by the setup.bat

That is why there was no executable file to run the game and no shortcut on the desktop"
