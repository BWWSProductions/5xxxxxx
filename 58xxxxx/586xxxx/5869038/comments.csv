,djscubasteve,2010-10-14T00:05Z,"can someone please help me install this? I have read the readme and don't get it. I am a new mac user. What I'm not understanding is this part...I right clicked in the limewire app nothing stated ""show package contents"" ""replace with the k'ed one ""Limewire.jar? Im just lost..lol sorry thanx for the upload.

4) Go to ""/LimeWire.app/Contents/Resources/Java/LimeWire.jar"" (right-click in LimeWire app and chose ""show package contents) and replace with the k'ed one ""LimeWire.jar"" file provided"
,grafkaal,2010-10-16T13:26Z,Works great! Got me out of the download loop from my old version. Many thanks.
,heliogabulus,2010-10-18T07:55Z,"Glad it (apparently) worked for you, but it not only did not work for me, it never downloaded. Appears to be another phantom download that I guess represents someone's idea of a practical jokeâor Limewire's way of hitting back. Either way, move on and ignore."
[T],ctang,2010-10-20T00:12Z,"dude your seriously pissing me off...dont tell people to fucking move on bc this works...why would it be that after about 4000 downloads (according to D tracker) you are the first to have problem downloading...seriously get a life

djscubasteve:  did you by chance get this working"
,mercuryXfactor,2010-10-23T04:28Z,"@djscubasteve after you download the torrent, Open finder, click on Applications, then right click on Limewire, ""show package contents will show up. Another window with the file will come up. Click on the Contents folder, then click on the Resources folder, then click on the Java folder. Go back to finder and search for your folder of the Limewire torrent. Drag the Limewire.jar file from the folder onto the one in the other window. Click to authenticate and it will replace the old file. Then open Limewire, and it will show that you have Limewire Pro. Hope this helps!"
[T],ctang,2010-10-23T22:22Z,remember that you have to install limewire first though
,AnitialD,2010-10-26T23:50Z,"Thanx for this was working Great, but LimeWire has been shut down by the Gov't, a court-ordered injunction"
