,666Reaper,2010-10-09T03:35Z,"@undergunz: Whats your wii version?

i have a 4.2 Pal wii and it works perfectly on usbloader gx"
,undergunz,2010-10-09T16:55Z,i use a 4.2 ntsc Wii and loaded up with neogamma 
,666Reaper,2010-10-10T00:36Z,"burned or loaded through a hard drive?
If it's burned to a dvd and it loads , then freezes or gives an error that's probably a faulty dvd/bad burn.
IF after loading it through a hard drive it still crashes or whatever , get pimpmywii homebrew to update your IOSs"
