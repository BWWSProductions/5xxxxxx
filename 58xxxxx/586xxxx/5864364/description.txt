"Love All Over Me" is a song recorded by American R&B singer Monica. It was produced by Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox and written by Crystal Johnson. The mid-tempo song was released as the second single from Monica's sixth studio album, Still Standing.

The Chris Robinson directed music video for "Love All Over Me" premiered on Thursday July 15, 2010 on 106 & Park. The plot of the video is Monica choosing between marrying her old love played by rapper Maino and her new love played by Shannon Brown. After the premiere of the video, fans could vote who Monica would pick as her love interest, resulting in the viewer's choice video being premiered July 23, 2010 on Vevo.

The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 94, and since peaked at number 58 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 2 on the US R&B/Hip-Hop chart. After reaching the Top 10 on the US R&B/Hip-Hop chart, it became Monica's second single from Still Standing to become a Top 10 hit on that chart, a feat achieved by all of her previous studio albums with the exception of [Makings of Me]. "Love All Over Me" also became Monica's twelfth top ten hit of her career on the US R&B/Hip-Hop chart.

Still Standing is the sixth studio album by American R&B recording artist Monica. Released on March 19, 2010 on RCA and J Records, it marked her third album on J following the renewal of her contract with the label in October 2007. Recorded during 2007 to 2010, the album's production process was tracked by the Peachtree reality show special Monica: The Single and its subsequent spin-off on the BET network, Monica: Still Standing, which debuted in October 2009 and chronicled the final months of recording.

The album debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 184,000 in its first week, among Monica's highest peaks and biggest first week sales yet. Critics received Still Standing with positive reviews, perceiving its sound as "a return to the mid-'1990s heyday" of contemporary R&B. A commercial success, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, with shipments in excess of 500,000 copies in the United States, and has sold nearly 475,000 copies to date.

So far, the album has produced two singles that attained moderate Billboard chart success. Lead single "Everything to Me," released in February 2010, peaked at number forty-four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number-one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming her first chart-topper in over seven years. Second single "Love All Over Me" was released in May 2010 and has since reached number two on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart.
