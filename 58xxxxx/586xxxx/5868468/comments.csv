,ooneg1,2010-10-06T03:41Z,why are there no seeds or leeches anymore????
,sudchau12,2010-10-06T12:08Z,"The seeders and leechers are there as usual, it's not just showing them. There's some problem with TPB's peer tracking system."
,MovieX101,2010-10-26T15:35Z,"Thanks For The Up!

@ Sp1tFir3 - I doubt it is the movie, it is Retail! Ripped Straight From The Actually Dvd! It might not even be your burner, it may your disks? Try burning another disks or another name brand of disks?"
,JBNyen,2010-10-29T08:22Z,A/V comments?
,hexenII,2010-10-31T13:10Z,"First at all, thks to the uploaders.  Excellent quality.
But as above mentioned, once burned, the movie star to freeze/jump from period to period.  Has burned 3 times, the last one at 4X, with the same result.  ConvertXtoDvd4.
Any ideas!!"
