The Film - Emotional Atayachar, is a ROAD      
THRILLER WITH BLACK HUMOUR. It is an ensemble  
film set on the deserted highway between Mumbai
and Goa and revolves around incidents that take
place in one night to four sets of travelers.  
It is essentially a dark film, in which, each  
character is an anti-hero who has a dark       
side. The real HERO of the film is the         
mysterious interconnection between these       
stories that unfolds in a non-linear format.   
Each story varies from the other in its humour 
flavour and content but is driven by more      
or less a similar motive - money.
