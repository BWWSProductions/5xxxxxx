On "Nearly Immeasurably Green", Post & Pelzer have collected almost all their unrecorded work. In doing so, this demo-album shows much more of the people behind the music, more soul, more depth than any other. The attention to detail and perfectionism put into this demo-album make it the most interesting release yet...
