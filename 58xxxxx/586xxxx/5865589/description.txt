"Without Me" is a rap song by American rapper Eminem. It was released as the lead single from his fourth studio album titled The Eminem Show in 2002, and re-released on his greatest-hits compilation album Curtain Call: The Hits in 2005. "Without Me" is one of Eminem's most successful singles, reaching #2 in the U.S. and #1 in many countries worldwide.

The song was Eminem's return after the successful The Marshall Mathers LP, intended as a sequel to "The Real Slim Shady" and essentially saying that he is back to save the world. It also refers to Eminem's role in the music industry and his cultural effects.

The song mocks a number of Eminem's critics, including Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne Cheney, the FCC and MTV, Chris Kirkpatrick, Limp Bizkit and Moby, as well as lampooning comparisons of Eminem to Elvis Presley as a white man succeeding commercially in a predominantly African-American art form. A line in the song also attacks his own mother for the lawsuit she filed against him for the lyrics of his debut single "My Name Is".
