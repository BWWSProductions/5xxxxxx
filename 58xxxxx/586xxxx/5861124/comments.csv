,oeddl,2011-01-18T07:25Z,The quality is great... but the episodes are mislabeled!
,The_Iron_E,2011-02-17T06:33Z,No idea they were mislabeled. I used Wikipedia as my reference. What did I get wrong? Sorry about that.
,locutus1,2012-03-14T05:50Z,Episodes 3 -6 are labelled / numbered wrong according to imdb.com. I don't know if the titles or episode numbers are wrong. imdb.com has descriptions of each episode so I won't know until I watch them if it's the titles or numbers that are wrong.
