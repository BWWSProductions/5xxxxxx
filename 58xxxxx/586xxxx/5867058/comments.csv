,pirate-love,2010-11-01T05:33Z,"Robbielover, Limewire has been permanently shut down because of the lawsuit from the RIAA."
,tigerneenee11,2011-05-20T17:47Z,"Thankx a million. Limewire is not shut down, thats impossible to do. Only the distribution of the program from Limewire and its search for torrents are down. So if you got your own torrent (a.k.a ThePirateBay) it will work fine. -Hint-
1. Download torrent
2. Run install, but be careful at the end and uncheck run Limewire(very important)
3. Open the crack folder
4. Open My Computer/Programs Files/Limewire/lib folder
5. Drag and Drop the Limewire exe icon from the crack folder to the lib folder(replace the old with the new)
6. Run Limewire Pro baby!

-Extra Tip- this really is the method for installing any crack, so you would...
1. Locate the crack-both were it is and how it looks
2. Locate the actual program in your computers main hard drive(usually drive c:)
3. Locate an Icon inside the program folder that looks just like the crack
4. Replace that icon (exe file) with the crack
5. Run your program and stick up your middle finger to corporate America!"
