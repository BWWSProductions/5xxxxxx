Encoders Notes: Its not often we make mistakes and unknown for us to do a repack, however as the Retail DVD is not expected until early next year we decided to redo this as it looks rather a cool film :) Reason for repack for the people who noticed, the aspect ratio was slightly out. Appologies to the people who downloaded the first version, we are only human. Enjoy :)
