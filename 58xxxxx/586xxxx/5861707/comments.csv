,MofoMan2000,2010-10-09T05:47Z,"This torrent is just the music from the game, in case you'd like to listen to it and get to know it outside of the game.

PLEASE keep this seeded, I LOVE Rock Band and I want to get to know the songs. I'm primary a vocalist so it's very helpful to me."
,Yosukekun,2010-10-15T02:14Z,Is this torrent dead?  Can someone seed? I promise to seed this a looooooong time if someone will just kick it off! (or point me to a working torrent).  Thanks
,SuperiorPosture,2010-10-27T06:09Z,"I apologize for the James Brown song. The version I included = the only version that I recognize as existing. The version in Rock Band 3 = a flipped over port-a-potty. I'm not sure who made the final decision on that one, but they should be fired."
,NinpoLore,2010-10-30T23:05Z,"This set-list looks to be the most complete available - DL speed was better than expected and I appreciate the uploader's attention to other comments. Will comment on the quality when the torrent is complete, but so far it's lookin' good. :)"
,NinpoLore,2010-10-31T02:48Z,"Yep, me likey very much. Will try and seed as long as I can. Thanks!"
