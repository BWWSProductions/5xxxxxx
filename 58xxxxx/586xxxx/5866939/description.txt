DESCRIPTION

Superstars V8 Next Challenge it's the racing game that will let players relive all the emotions of the ever growing Superstar V8 Championship. All cars from the Championship will race in 11 different tracks such as Monza, Imola, Portimao, Mugello and Kyalami and will give birth to thrilling challenges filled with adrenaline, turns, chicanes, aiming right at the highest step of the podium.
The player can choose between several Single Player game modes: Quick Race, Race Weekend, Championship, Time Attack and Superstars Licenses.
Quick Race let's you take part to a race selecting driver, track, car, simulation level, driving aids, weather and lap numbers all in one menu, while Race Weekend will take you through qualifying and daily sessions.
The backbone of the game is the Championship mode: either the official Championship or a custom Championship can be selected. Before starting a race, the game allows the player to change several settings in order to prepare the car for the track. It's possible to play around with parameters such as suspensions, tire type, stabilisers, gears, brakes and motor mapping. On this specific feature, Superstars V8 is every bit as good as other car simulations on the market at the moment. Options are many and will make enthusiasts happy.
