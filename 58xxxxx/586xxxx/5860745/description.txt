Bold Young Bugger is an unreleased album from Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. It is referred to as Donovan with Nigel Kennedy however, Nigel does not play a great part in the proceedings. They sound like demos for an album and I would think it most likely an 80's thing looking at the picture of Donovan and Nigel Kennedy together on the sleeve, but it could be late 70's stuff as Donovan has tracks written many years before they appear on actual releases. A couple of these tracks appear on Neutronica but I hadn't heard many of the others before. A real treat for Donovan fans, mostly just the man himself and his guitar.
