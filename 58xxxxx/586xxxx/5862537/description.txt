 In this semidocumentary, an Alabama town is run by a    
 crime syndicate that's grown fat on prostitution and    
 crooked gambling, directed at soldiers from Fort        
 Benning across the river. Lawyer John Patterson, back   
 from the army, is triggered by what he sees to join the 
 reformers with a plan: to run his father Albert for     
 state attorney general. The syndicate responds with     
 escalating violence: is no one safe? Credits preceded   
 by a "newscast" containing spoilers.

  This is one of Martin Scorsese's personal favorite films.    
  The film was in production so quickly, some of the           
  criminals it was portraying where standing trial while       
  filming was taking place.
