The game's story picks up just before The Matrix Reloaded and runs parallel to that of the film. Play either Niobe or Ghost as they bend the rules of the Matrix with martial arts, pilot the fastest hovercraft in the fleet, or just fight with lots of guns. Written by lcheala@imdb.com

Shortly after the Animatrix's "Final Flight Of The Osiris" short, Niobe (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Ghost (Anthony Wong) must retrieve the package at a post office before the machines do. After succeeding, they call the rest of the Zion fleet to warn the Resistance about the machines digging for Zion. The game then runs a parallel story to Matrix Reloaded which explains what Niobe and Ghost were doing while the movie was focused on Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity. Written by Gabe Shadow
