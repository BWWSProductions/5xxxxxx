Crimson Omen is an Industrial/Electro solo project developed by Adam Lawrence in the spring of 2009. The idea behind Crimson Omen is to create a new feel for Industrial music, harder, faster, and experimentation incorporating elements from other types of music, such as black metal and death metal, in an electronic setting. Crimson Omen is also very fond of experimenting in performance arts and the human psyche.
