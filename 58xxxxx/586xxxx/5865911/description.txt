I got this about 10 years ago on VHS and transferred to .wmv. The quality is decent and the show is great. I found the following info. in the Arrowhead Ranch archives:

Richie Havens performed to a rapt crowd at the Arrowhead Ranch on August 4, 1991. The Band with Billy Preston on keyboards and the ranch's own house band The Hour, filled out the bill that day.
