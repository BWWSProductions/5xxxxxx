Ever since he was young, Sam Winchester (Jared Padalecki, Gilmore Girls) has tried to escape his past. After his mother's mysterious death, Sam's father set out to seek revenge on the evil forces that killed her and destroy other evil beings along the way. Unlike Sam, Dean (Jensen Ackles, Smallville), Sam's older brother, was eager to follow in his father's footsteps, learning the tricks of the trade, and entering the â€œfamily businessâ€. Sam on the other hand, determined to break free of the â€œfamily businessâ€, left home as soon as he graduated from high school, unwavering from his quest to start a â€œnormalâ€ life on his own.
Just as Sam's new life was going perfectly with an upcoming interview at a prestigious law school and a beautiful girlfriend by his side, Dean arrived at Sam's doorstep to let his brother know that their father (recurring guest star Jeffrey Dean Morgan) disappeared on a hunting trip. Upon hearing the startling news, Sam, though reluctant, had no choice but to help Dean track down their father.
Now, on the road together in search of their father, tracking evil supernatural forces along the way, Dean and Sam have begun to reunite after spending several years apart. However, during their journey, old sibling rivalries resurface, and the effects of their strange upbringing are shown. Sam remains wary of their father and mission while Dean, although cocky and fearless on the surface, still tries to come to grips with his mother's horrific death. But together with their different views and personalities, Sam and Dean are able to save lives by destroying the evil beings that haunt the earth.

Supernatural is an American drama and horror television series created by Eric Kripke, which debuted on September 13, 2005 on The WB, and is now part of The CW's lineup. Starring Jared Padalecki as Sam Winchester and Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester, the series follows the brothers as they hunt demons and other figures of the paranormal. The series is produced by Warner Bros. Television, in association with Wonderland Sound and Vision. The current executive producers are Eric Kripke, McG, and Robert Singer; former executive producer Kim Manners died of lung cancer during production of the fourth season.
The series, which is filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, was in development for nearly ten years, as creator Kripke spent several years unsuccessfully pitching it as a series. The pilot was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, and the ratings of the first four episodes prompted The WB to pick up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. Originally, Kripke planned the series for three seasons, but later expanded it to five. The fifth season began airing on September 10, 2009, and concluded the series' main storyline; however, The CW officially renewed the show for a sixth season on February 16, 2010. Kripke has confirmed that he will not be returning as showrunner; however, he will still remain as an executive producer. Sera Gamble, replacing Kripke as showrunner, has stated that the sixth season will focus on the brothers' relationship.
