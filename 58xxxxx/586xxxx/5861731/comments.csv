,PhilLesh12,2010-10-02T07:47Z,"don't thank them until you can successfully download this.

Every TvTeam torrent I've attempted to download today has FAILED.

No seeds.

This is happening more and more often with TvTeam.  "
,Jebus567,2010-10-02T09:10Z,Has plenty of seeds from what I can see. TPB has been a little off on showing seeds the past few weeks but they are there. Thanks uploader.
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-03T10:25Z,"we have all known that the seed/leech stats have been broken for the last 17 months.

That's not what I'm talking about.

I can download the same torrent from TvTeam and eztv, and the TvTeam torrent can sometimes take 12 or more hours, while the eztv torrent is finished in 15 or 20 minutes.
