A unique creation by the director of â€œRun Lola Run (1998)â€ and â€œHeaven (2002).â€ I love his camera work and silent moments. German with English subtitles. If you like this movie, donâ€™t miss Tom Tykwerâ€™s â€œHeaven.â€

Young nurse Sissi lives a secluded life, seemingly entirely devoted to her patients at Birkenhof asylum. Her first encounter with ex-soldier and drifter Bodo has a lasting impact. He causes an accident that results in her lying under a truck, unable to breathe. While he provides life-saving first aid, mesmerized Sissi begins to wonder whether he may be the man of her dreams. But when she tracks him down weeks later her affection is rejected, as Bodo is stuck somewhere between a traumatic past and a criminal future.
