this movie was awful,
mostly featuring some of sciences greatest achievements and discoveries only to have these assholes put a big god claim stake through the whole lot!,"
,nsofast,2010-12-14T02:53Z,"thanks for the warning swift 
jubus pirates ? WTF 
we need to kill them "
,delahaya,2011-01-03T05:23Z,"Ah, love all the ""tolerant"" comments.  Guess what?  A lot of history's greatest scientists were Christians.  Maybe you should just pretend they never existed and go back to the Stone Age."
,burl1969,2011-03-14T05:39Z,THANK YOU!! GOD IS GREAT AND THIS JUST PROVES IT SO VERY WELL!!! Thank you For sharing....only a fool would say there is no God.
,t3ht3h,2011-03-22T02:30Z,"Then, by all means, call me a fool."
,t3ht3h,2011-03-22T02:32Z,"And yeah, this is your regular creationist bullshit and bad science. Don't bother."
,adaa24a4,2011-04-09T13:47Z,Woot! Thank you!
,quadrafunk,2011-05-22T10:40Z,is this a documentary?
,antmartain,2011-07-02T02:31Z,"I thought a documentary, by definition, was supposed to be factual...?"
,volver04,2011-07-02T11:53Z,Am I fool no. 1 or am I fool no. 2?
,gadriam,2011-07-21T19:13Z,"Isn't a creationist documentary a bit like a wrestling movie about figureskating? There are logical holes in this film the size of a, well, cathedral..."
,soneworks,2011-07-21T19:59Z,"""debating creationists on the topic of evolution is rather like trying to play chess with a pigeon, it knocks the pieces over, craps on the board, and flies back to its flock to claim victory.""

,summerHereKids,2011-07-23T19:56Z,"please TPB, remove this crap."
,AidyD,2011-07-31T05:33Z,"I feel sorry for those who download this and just swallow mouthful after mouthful of bullshit.

Our society has so far to go... People will look back in amazement at the crazy mix of technological explosion and understanding of science of our times, mixed with people who still believe in talking snakes and an invisible man who watches everything, where people go to church and ritually drink the representation of another mans blood.

Nuts. "
,Tania1987,2011-08-28T22:55Z,"Thanks for the warning too Swift!
@delahaya - The time before Christianity was not the Stone Age. Most scientists are not Christian's, though most scientists have been religious at times when most people had no real choice but to be religious as they would either be ostracized, executed or had no way of seeing outside their tiny box because their whole lives they had been taught by their schooling, by those they loved, by authority to believe in things that there was scant, if not no, evidence for. Many scientists suffered greatly trying to reconcile what they had been taught all their lives and what they could see in their research. Those were very sad and hard times but thankfully humanity is leaving organised religion behind and maybe we can all get a long a little better without all those absolute truths and dogmatism's.
I do not think TPB should remove this torrent, but we definitely need to keep a eye out for harmful propaganda in all it's forms and warn fellow users.  "

God save Pirate Bay
Mock if you wish but I'll find an extra plank for ya"
,dzlrules,2011-10-22T22:27Z,"@delahaya Guess what, most modern scientist do not follow the creationist ideology. That's not to say we are not surrounded by gods, quite the opposite. See, they [scientist] too have evolved quite like most humans have done. I say most, because, well, you know... I suggest you bible-thumpers open your mind and research ancient history. Don't forget to send your check to Pat Robertson! He needs the money to pay for his prostitutes and child sex trade.

The Ancient Alien series would cause most *cough* CHRISTIANS *cough* pea-brains to explode! Of course, you wouldn't be caught dead watching/studying such history out of guilt your preachers use to control such morons.

For the final straw, we're all GODS! 

Just for you delahaya, I vow to burn a bible on both easter and xmas!"
,ocdpcdoc,2011-10-28T20:14Z,"Many thanks to JustPirateBay2010 for putting these resources up here.  My kids are already being indoctrinated with the ""Theory of Evolution"" as if it were fact, when in fact there is more evidence to support the belief that Darth Vader is our Grandfather, and that we were born on the Death Star, than this garbage about being somehow descended from Lucy and a bunch of cartoon drawings the evolutionists use to prop up their flimsy ideas.  If at one time there were millions of primates, and now there are billions of people, logic dictates that more than one or two ""missing links"" would be found. There should be graveyards full of civilizations. But that begs the question of where life came from in the first place.  Time plus chance do not make life. Intelligence must be added to the formula, Peace Out"
,sinx5,2011-11-08T02:56Z,"If there is god, he will punish every christian that steals this DVD. :)"
,elkslip,2012-03-21T23:26Z,"I saw this documentary on Netflix.  It is beautifully done.  If you dont believe in God, just don't watch it.  It isn't a requirement, you know."
,Helmer2,2012-03-28T07:35Z,"It doesnÂ´t really matter what you belive, evolution is a proven fact. As theory it is a scentific theory, which is totally different thing than your everyday use of the word theory."
