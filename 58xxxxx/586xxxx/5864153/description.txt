Formed by members of Stoke prog-rock group Grace. White Door created sensitive, well-written, electronic music. Their last single "Flame in My Heart" was more guitar-driven and took its instrumental riff from Frankie Goes to Hollywood's "Two Tribes / One February Friday" who were recording at the time. White Door's producer, Andy Richards, went on to work with many top acts, including Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Sue Quin provided backing vocals. Their album and 3 of their singles contained original artwork by Paul Warrillow. The members of White Door still tour as Grace.

I have loved this record ever since it was released in 1983. When this was released on CD, it was a lifetime dream come true for me!!
