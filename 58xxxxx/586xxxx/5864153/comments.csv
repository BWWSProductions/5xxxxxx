,standardpolaroid,2010-10-05T09:09Z,"Hello, I noticed you've got a lot of Canadian music uploaded and I was just wondering if you've got any Images In Vogue? In particular their self-titled EP from 1983 and In The House. Sorry if you've already uploaded it and I missed it; there's a lot of material here and I've spent a good while perusing it.

Thanks very much :)"
