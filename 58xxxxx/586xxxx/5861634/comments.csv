[V],johnefp,2010-10-02T06:32Z,Why you need that information?
,hello40204,2010-10-02T13:27Z,"well . i have already a tv rip. looking for better source such as a dvd rip if there is a dvd of that . not sure . i am going to check on amazon. 
but i think you should let people know the source. because it does not matter what your resolution or else if the source of the video is average. at least you let people know and they can choose or not to dl"

,svidrigailovjones,2010-10-13T23:56Z,"Well, whatever the source may be, ""The World Of Suzie Wong"" is indeed a fabulously good, crazy-mad movie for goodness sake!!!"
,repoman42,2011-12-30T09:25Z,Ihave a 700 mb version of the movie and this version is really not much better. reasonable quality though considering that the print it came from seems a bit weathered. Must say that Nancy Kwan is very nice for goodness sake!
