,blha89,2010-10-31T11:05Z,"I recommend everyone ho downloads this iso and dont want to uppdate you wii when you are forced to do it to play the game use wii brick blocker to remove the forced update from the iso and play it like a normal game.

,karliboy,2010-11-09T17:39Z,do you just put this brick blocker into root of sd card?
,dredg_XI,2010-11-10T15:26Z,"I haven't been doing this for all that long, but in my experience, I haven't had a single softmod issue, so first and foremost, I'd go with that over a wiikey. All the people asking questions are the people with hardmods...hmm.

When the mod was done, by whoever did it, they should have added some type of Priiloader, Brick Blocker at that time, and disabled disc and internet updates. Do that, it's nearly impossible to brick your machine.

I have a softmodded 4.2U. I use USBLoaderGX for all of my backups. They run off a 150 GB external HDD. Just download, extract ISO if needed, add to HDD using WBSF manager. WBSF manager can also be used to format your HDD to WBSF format so your Wii can read it / handle backups.

I agree that a softmod requires more maintenance. But I've been through the last year and a half without having to update a thing. That's seen the release of major Nintendo titles. New Super Mario Bros., Galaxy 2, Other M, Epic Yarn, GoldenEye 007...None of those games required a mod update. I'm not expecting to have to do anything for Donkey Kong in a couple weeks either...

Either way, I'm gonna end my rant by saying that you should know what you're doing with your mod before you come to a place like this and ask for advice. That's the quickest way you're gonna end up with a shiny white brick.

There are a few good modding sites that can be found with a simple google search, they have in-depth tutorials, step-by-step instructions to get your Wii backup ready. Don't use YouTube.  "

,mikprobes,2010-11-12T03:48Z,It has worked for me...good luck to all...
,iBoo,2010-12-07T14:57Z,"Ive chipped my wii with a card, long time ago I played on it. But now the same thing happend to me, a update popped up, installed it and all thought it will break my wii but it didnt. So now I can play every new game.

 For those who dont know if they should update their wii, its a 50/50 thing if u got it softmodded. But if u have physical chipped the wii, it shouldnt be a problem to update it. Have fun!"

I have to fully agree with you.

The only problem is that,

These people get on here. Not read a FUCKING thing. Then click the ""Write comment"", and ask a fucking question.

I have been spending at least a week, trying to clean this up. But it's no use. No one reads shit. Here is a example,

Is this English or just Spanish?
Well, I don't know. Did you ""try"" to use your brain and see just what the fuck Multi5 means? No? How do you have the brains to mod/hack?...

Any damn question can be answered by Google.

It's not that hard.

You can even sign up on a forum, and get help.

One can try 
http://www.apiratesbook.com/forum/index.php

Or even just Wii Guides
http://www.apiratesbook.com/guides.html


It's not hard. 

I think we need to start telling people that this is not a help section. Take it somewhere else. Not to go about it and be rude. You will just get more help on a forum. Not in a comment section.


Just saying.

download a lot easyer :)"
,TacoSteve,2011-01-17T03:41Z,"for all those having issues playing this game; it's because you're running on outdated cIOS249, 236 is where it's at now, and most new wii games want to run on IOS56 now, which, if you were up to date you'd have stubbed and installed.

Best thing you can do is search the latest softmod .zips on either gbatemp or wiihacks and do start anew.

All those claiming they get the ""system update""  requests when playing through the disc channel, get Neogamma or something, it'll bypass that."
