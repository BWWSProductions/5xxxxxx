,thepirateofpirates,2010-10-09T19:11Z,"Hi there,
I've burned 4 DVD's, none is working

Btw, I'm not a NOOB, I've downloaded and played Red Dead Redemption, Tekken6, etc... and I'm using the activate ISO...

I'm burning the iso file using Imageburn 2.5.2. However, when I put the DVD in the xbox DVD tray, the Xbox says (play game), when I press A, a black screen starts, then the screen shows (this DVD is unreadable, clean it with a soft cloth, or contact microsoft)...

May anybody help please, I'm facing the same issue with brutal legend!!!"
,thepirateofpirates,2010-10-09T19:13Z,"Btw, I'm using Imation DVD+R DL, I've been using them all for all the previous downloads, since Vibtram or what so ever ain't available in here..."
,thepirateofpirates,2010-10-10T22:02Z,the fault ain't from your game... my xbox isn't able to play anything @ all...
