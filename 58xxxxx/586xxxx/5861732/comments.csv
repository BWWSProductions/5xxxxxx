,r-u-nutz,2011-01-29T14:39Z,"Symantec Endpoint Protection v11 found a Bloodhound.Exploit virus IN the .avi movie file. This is NOT a false positive! Waste of a good download! 

Who puts a virus in a kid's movie?"
,mollyhipi,2011-02-11T09:32Z,"Its just people trolling the torrent. its virus free. They're just talking shit. 

The movie isn't in english however.. so don't bother downloading."
,spunkedunken,2011-02-24T20:14Z,not worth downloading...
,moviemum,2011-02-27T14:28Z,"Been doing this for a long time, and this is the first movie I've downloaded with no sound. No sound before conversion and after conversion (obviously LOL).

Thanks anyway uploader."
