,masterfaster2,2010-10-05T18:16Z,"the cracker Cleric[V] is a member of NoDVD.NeT

if this is his cracked dll, then SKIDROW has nothing to do with it.

so just rename the title to WRC.FIA.World.Rally.Championship.NoDVD.Crack-Cleric[V]"
,danilo86,2010-10-05T18:22Z,"Thanks, now please start upload! :)"
[V],Mbb15,2010-10-05T19:30Z,"you can't edit torrents for 3 months already? do you never read the forums? btw if SKIDROW really stole this .dll file then it will get nuked, but it isnt now"
[V],Mbb15,2010-10-05T19:37Z,"ignore my last comment I actually looked on that site and 'Cleric[V]' isnt the cracker at all, he's just a silly uploader and you really thought that skidrow needs to stole a crack for this ultra-low procted game? "
[H],HeroMaster,2010-10-05T19:43Z,@Mbb15 this is just a dll file the actual scene release has not come dude.
[V],Mbb15,2010-10-05T20:22Z,"Hero_No_1 ,

dont say things where you dont know anything about ;)

'the actual scene release has not come ' ...."
[H],HeroMaster,2010-10-05T20:49Z,Crazy hmmm!
,masterfaster2,2010-10-05T22:04Z,"I don't know what file name or size is the SKIDROW crack. I only know that this has the same crc32/md5 hash as the crack Cleric[V]

I'm trying to find SKIDROW's original scene release. No luck yet.

Either way, this one should work ok, so forget everything else and grab this torrent."
,masterfaster2,2010-10-05T22:07Z,"All other matters about who cracked it etc. are not of importance, just use this crack to play with nodvd.

the full game is uploaded by Mbb15 here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5866332/WRC.FIA.World.Rally.Championship-RELOADED"
,Guuru5,2010-10-06T11:31Z,"The no-dvd crack works just fine. The handling of the car is really good. Reminds me of Colin Mcrae rally 2005, but sadly the graphic reminds me of 2005 too. Heartbreaking bad graphics."
,zegga,2010-10-08T06:39Z,If the handling is in anyway similar to Colin Mcrae 5 then this game is worthless. CM5 had the worst handling physics of any game iv played. (with a controller anyway) 
,cederrowe,2010-10-09T22:04Z,no g25 support!
[V],thethingy,2010-10-14T16:24Z,does this work on my win 95?
[V],DeGun,2010-10-15T18:44Z,"well hopefully this will work on my commodore 64 :) 

but anyway no doubt on your torrents will always refer to you for quality and last releases .

thanks for another great torrent from Mbb15 

Jah bless"

,damnlogin,2011-06-14T13:13Z,"@bonhi123.

If you've got winrar installed just open the folder you have WRC in and right click on it and extract it to where you like the mount the image with daemon Tools or similar. Then Just read the NFO and follow that. hope that helps"
