Why is 8.1 GB and other is 5.19 GB???
Thanks you upload in Multi7 but they have greek commentary.

Sorry for my bad english"
,masterfaster2,2010-10-02T00:15Z,"This is a custom release (and not from the scene - r55 is a p2p group)

For English get the RELOADED release

For German/French get GENESIS

For Italian/Greek/Spanish/PT get 
Pro.Evolution.Soccer.2011.Multi4.READNFO-iTWINS"
[V],Morck22,2010-10-02T00:18Z,Audio traks maby??? don't know if spoken greek is inside but almost text are in there
,masterfaster2,2010-10-02T00:22Z,"And something that I want to clear:
the R55 release it maybe working ok, I never tested. Though I prefer to have the original scene releases.

Thanks :)"
,chourdis,2010-10-02T06:49Z,"For Italian/Greek/Spanish/PT get 
Pro.Evolution.Soccer.2011.Multi4.READNFO-iTWINS 
Where download that???"
,masterfaster2,2010-10-02T10:05Z,downloadbox or similar sites
,masterfaster2,2010-10-02T12:51Z,Something off-topic: I stopped uploading scene releases for full games or apps. I only upload DOX stuff for games (mainly updates).
,masterfaster2,2010-10-02T14:19Z,"@chourdis, from what I see from the nfo, this release combines the 3 scene releases (RELOADED, GENESIS, ITWINS), so you can download it and try.

By the way, I think that the name of the release is actually: 
Pro_Evolution_Soccer_2011_MULTI_DVD_PC-R55

In the end maybe I will also download this. Thanks Morck22 :)

,masterfaster2,2010-10-02T15:03Z,"@chourdis, from the included screenshots (r55-pes2011-proofa.jpg, r55-pes2011-proofb.jpg), it seems it supports both Greek text and audio. In fact for all 7 languages it has text and audio."
