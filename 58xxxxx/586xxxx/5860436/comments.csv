,zzirhp,2012-03-16T19:29Z,A seed would also be nice..getting nothing from the torrent file nor via magnet link
,zzirhp,2012-03-16T20:31Z,"Someone, ANYone:

PLEASE SEEEEED THIS!!"
,zzirhp,2012-03-16T22:42Z,"One seed in the swarm for openbittorrent, yet doesn't even attempt to connect. I know the torrent is old but this just sucks not seeing a connection attempt when there is a seed, whomever it is.

Nothing from the torrent file via azureus 2.4.0.2 nor from magnet using utorrent 3.1.2 :("
,zzirhp,2012-03-17T04:02Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEEED PLEASE!
,zzirhp,2012-03-17T14:30Z,"Sad, yet another very hard to find game torrent dead.

The one ""seed"" only occasionally shows up in the swarm, but never connects to any peers.

Will have to order a used copy of this from gamestop unfortunately, my original just won't play anymore :/"
