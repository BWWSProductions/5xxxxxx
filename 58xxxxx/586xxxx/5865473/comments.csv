,myself10erwin,2010-10-05T09:06Z,"i have downloaded the file and when i put it into my iso folder and started the game, my psp slim 5.50 gen d3 hangs up and rebooted itself. does anyone experience the same problem?"
,JIHUIN,2010-10-05T14:35Z,"thanks a lot...works perfectly in 5.50 GEN-B Full...more power to NitrogenUA...

@myself10erwin : go to the VSH Menu by pressing the Select button then check the setting of your UMD ISO MODE. Set it to SONY NP9660 or M33 driver and see which of the two can run the game. Make sure also that your CPU clock speed and CXMB clock speed is set to ""default""...I hope this can help...  :)"

,au10tic,2010-10-07T06:17Z,"Is it just me or the roster is not updated? for instance, Shaq and T-mac are showing as free agents and are not part of any team. Those are the only ones i found on top of the free agent list, didnt bother scrowling down to search for more"
,JIHUIN,2010-10-07T12:19Z,@myself10erwin:  I figure out the cause of your problem...you must disable your KHBBS plugin to run this game...To disable your KHBBS plugin you must go to recovery menu of your PSP then go to the PLUGINS menu and go to the KHBBS patch and disable it.... 
,myself10erwin,2010-10-07T12:19Z,"thanks for the advice JIHUIN. ahhhhmmm, i tried doing that but still when i tried to play NBA 2k11 my psp hangs up, turns to black screen and rebooted itself. i've read from other threads that it has something to do with the plugins. i'd rebooted my psp, holding R button while switching the power button, then went to plugins and disabled this thing: Patch_KHM33_GEN.prx [GAME]

When this patch is disabled, i cant play naruto shippuden 3. but good thing i can play NBA 2k11, since i've already finished the naruto game. Now, if i want to play naruto again, i just have to enable the plugin. It is sure a lot of work, but for now, that is the only solution that i can do since i want naruto and NBA games in my psp.

anyway, thanks to JIHUIN for trying to help me. ĂĹ and i hope i can also help those who can't play this game. you just have to disable something on the plugins. thanks to NitrogenUA. this game works!!!"
,myself10erwin,2010-10-07T12:22Z,yup! thanks JIHUIN! thanks for those advices and for exerting an effort to help me... also thanks to NitrogenUA! nice upload! this game really works! im using 5.50 gen d3!
