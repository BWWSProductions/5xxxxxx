,skunkfreaker,2010-10-11T13:13Z,"i just wanted to add my huge amount of thanks aswell bitstep.  You're a fucking legend mate, these tunes you're sharing are just unbelievable!  Been into dubstep pretty much from day one when it was a bit shit really, lets be honest, that boring square bass sound and that the usual hand clap going on.  but nowadays, it's gone massive and these are the kind of tunes that people love so thanks again for spreading the dubstep word.  Top man."
,Bit-Step,2010-10-15T00:33Z,"Totally agree skunk! my mates used to be into the early 2000 dub (stuff lke kromestar, n-type, dz) i wass never a fan of that. but when it started getting big round 06 thats when i got intriguied by the genre :D 

dutty beats and future grime all round......

Anyway here's Link to Part 6
