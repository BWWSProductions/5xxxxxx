Hi,

These songs are to be used with Ultrastar and/or Ultrastar Deluxe.

I will be uploading Ultrastar 0.8.0 and Ultrastar Deluxe.

The files contain the Ultrastar txt files, mp3's and some pics.

Songs included are

6 Ultrastar Songs Part 2

Blu Cantrell â€“ Hit emâ€™ up style
Booty Luv â€“ Shine
Cheryl Cole â€“ Parachute
Christina Aguilera â€“ Dirrty
Florence & The Machines â€“ Youâ€™ve got the love
Jennifer Lopez â€“ Jenny from the block

No need to adjust the gaps, as I have already matched the MP3's included to the txt.

By the way, all my files have been scanned with Kaspersky 2011 and all clean.

If you have any problems with this and/or am not sure on how to use it, i'd googleee it or you can leave a comment and I will try to help you.

Thanks and enjoy!	

Please Seed!
