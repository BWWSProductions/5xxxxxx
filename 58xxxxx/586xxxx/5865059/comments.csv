,XJapenForeverLove,2011-03-14T22:23Z,"Excellent movie!!! Thanks a lot. Kiitos! Great quality! Language: German. Optional subtitles: Finnish.

There is even a book now that is an excellent companion for those who want to learn more about the 'german autumn' that culminated with the Mogadishu hijacking and subsequently the
suicide of RAF members Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe at the JVA Stuttgart-Stammheim. ISBN: 978-3-426-78191-3.

For those who want to know even more:  Aust's definitive standard book about the RAF: ISBN: 978-3-455-50029-5.

As the movie: Both books are in German."
