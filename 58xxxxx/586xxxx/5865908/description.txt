The Venture Brothers, Season 4 Episode 11. Various henchmen, villains and heroes are captured and made to fight for the glory of Zeus. I didn't see this up yet, so I snagged it from a website and tossed it up.

File is in .avi format, quality and sound look pretty good. The site claimed this was HD quality. Screenshots are included, so you can judge for yourself and make sure this is an episode you haven't seen or downloaded yet. The screenshots are correct this time too, I made sure several times.

Enjoy,
