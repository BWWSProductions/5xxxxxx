"Unwritten"

When Alice (guest star Irving), the author 
of a popular children's book series, 
inexplicably suffers from a seizure moments 
before an attempt to take her own life, the 
Princeton Plansboro team faces the 
challenges of evaluating both her 
underlying medical conditions, as well as 
her unstable psychological state. Unable to 
diagnose Alice, House becomes particularly 
motivated, as he's a fan of her books, and 
is convinced that the key to unlocking the 
mysteries of Alice's condition lies in the 
pages of her most recent novel. Meanwhile, 
House takes Cuddy on a double date with 
Wilson and his girlfriend, Sam (guest star 
Cynthia Watros), and makes a discovery that 
proves that life imitates art as the couple 
continues to make compromises in order to 
make their relationship work.

Enjoy :)
