[V],RiddlerA,2010-10-07T05:26Z,"@ wira

TPB has been facing such type of legal threats for a long time ....... They have managed to avoid them so far ........ Lets hope they do so now too

The problems are not due to court cases though as their time is occupied with these legal issues, it is taking time to rectify them

p/s: I just want to help out in some way :P

@starluman
well, yifi still in college i think.. he's usually busy from time to time.. I got the list from riddlera's comment in past uploads.. so I just copied it here.. most questions/request are already answered and I understand some people could miss it... plus I just like to keep track of these things lol..  

@ashu
I think riddlera doesnt do r5 rips, just bluray/dvd(sometime)... yifi usually do it tho...maybe u should try this one... I tried some of his/her rips b4 and it looked fine too...

,Galactigus,2011-01-31T23:31Z,"Pros: V-10|A-10 if i didn't know better i'd think i was watching the actual Dvd.

Cons: Well its not HD nor does it claim to be but it is crystal clear with great sound.

Ps. All the seasons by Riddler are the same quality and they all download extremely fast i'm already through to season 4 episode 11 and every rip so far is same and perfect."

Episode 20 glitches out a lot at the end.
Episode 22 loses sound at the very end.

Skip those those two episodes and get them from a DVD based torrent. I first grabbed EP 20 form another release but it was the same source and still glitched. Then I got Swesub version, but they were hard burned subtitles.

Finally I found a good clean episode 20 here:
