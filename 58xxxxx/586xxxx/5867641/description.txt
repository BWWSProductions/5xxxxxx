New Day Rising is a 1985 album by the American punk rock band HÃ¼sker DÃ¼, released on SST Records. Though less sprawlingly ambitious than prior album Zen Arcade, New Day Rising, in some ways, abandoned hardcore punk entirely,[neutrality is disputed] and helped set the template for alternative rock  for the next decade. While retaining the speed and aggression of earlier efforts, many fans maintain that virtually all of the songs on New Day Rising exhibit a strong pop sensibility.[neutrality is disputed] Guitarist and lead singer Bob Mould\'s trademark miasma of fuzz distortion is still present, but with much of the harsh rawness of previous efforts abandoned in favor of a more melodic sound.
