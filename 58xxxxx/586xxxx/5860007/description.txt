This film has received media attention from around the world for its open source release, its non-existent budget, and its edgy material. BWNS is a full length movie that anyone can watch, share, and even use in their own derivative works. Update: Sept 02 2008: In a little over one year since its release and over 5 million people (I know hard to believe - almost 2.5 million views on Youtube alone ) have seen Boy Who Never Slept: the movie I created with a $200 budget and released online for free as an "open source" film. It appears my first venture into filmmaking was more successful than I had ever imagined. It's been mentioned in the main stream media and in websites and publications from all around the world (Telegraph, TechNewsWorld, Syndey Times, IFC). I invite you to watch this entire film for free right now and then join our filmmaking and movie community. I'm in the process of making another film, this time in HD and it's going to be a community project so you can get involved. After that, even more ambitious plans will follow, I'm so excited and hope you'll contribute. - Solomon Rothman
