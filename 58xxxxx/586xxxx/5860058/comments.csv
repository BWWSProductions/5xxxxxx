no you are the one interested by riddlera release but we, we want a YIFY quality release"
,Arjunnn,2010-10-02T06:56Z,can u upload the vampire diaries s1 in mkv format :) 
,wira020,2010-10-02T21:14Z,"Maybe you can do Weeds all season next... RiddlerA plan to do it but it's pretty far in his list.. that series is good.. that way you can take something off his list...

Btw, thanks for this movie.. 8.5 for image quality and 9 for audio.. for only 400mb, I shouldnt have anything to complain... The movie itself however, is a let down.. no wonder it got so low on IMDB... It got great story potential but this is really not Shyamalan cup of tea.. I think this could have been a better movie if LOTR director did it.. it had a chance to become epic but they missed it.. special effects and action sequences is the only thing I feel entertaining.. 

p/s: Sorry for the rants, it's just that I was expecting too much of this movie.."
