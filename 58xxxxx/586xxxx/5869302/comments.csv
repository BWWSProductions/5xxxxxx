,khadhowf,2012-02-08T14:49Z,"Hi all!
I've uploaded over 40GB (ratio: 8.25) on this torrent to this date (with a really slow Internet connection).
I hope all you new lechers can help do the same.
If everyone help seed to at least ratio 2, these ideas might become more famous in the world.

If you can, seed as long as possible. I'll continue to seed until at least ratio 10.

Just a note for those of you that live far north:
If you're like me, living in Sweden, an Earthship might not be the best solution for you. We've had lots of projects and experiments where individuals and groups of people try to build these homes on our latitudes. I don't know any successful project on our latitudes where the original design of Michael Reynolds were used. Although there are some successful projects they've had to take a big step away from the core of the concept with the Earthships.
The main problem in Sweden and most countries north of the Netherlands is that it's too cold too far down into the ground. It gets worse the further north you get. It can be solved by just digging deeper, but in the end it all comes down to the simple question: How much money and energy are you willing to put in to a project, just for the sake of staying with the main concept.

If you're from Sweden or any country on the far north part of the globe, you should try contacting the various organisations in your country before trying on this by yourself!

If you have any conflicting ideas please post them here with some links and stuff, as I'm sure lots of people would be interested to read them.

That said...
Good luck with building your own Earthships everyone!
Spread the knowledge and your experiences!"

,corvid53,2012-03-21T23:49Z,"Thank you PirateArr, we have been into the concept for years, now want to realize some dreams. Im in school for electromechanic/ millwright and currently have no money at all. (a new little baby also takes the funds away). So far its been downloading well, (I have a slow connection, but it hit 150kbs a few times!!) and just want to say thanks to you guys keeping this alive for so long.
Thanks for the tip khadhoff, we live in Canada and may have similar problems depending on where we get started. 
Good luck all, keep up the DIY and never retire."
,JPHawk57,2012-06-21T03:27Z,This is so slow it is not working at all. I have high speed internet and nothing works here. It keeps stopping and then it gives me a error message saying that the file is being used by another process? It says there are 13 seeders and 5 leechers. I would really like to build this soon but I needs the info and can not afford to buy it if that is how they want you to get it. I am also looking into styrofoam and fiberglass construction techniques for both home and boat building. Can't find anything on that here on TPB.
