,Sirleechalot,2011-02-08T03:34Z,"As Achilles stands alone before the Trojan walls to shout for Hector, the Trojans could have shot him. 
Its so stupid that Hector went out and died, although he knew about Achilles fighting skills

I liked the film very much till to this point.

watch out for dark pixelated scenes.

good rip nonetheless."
,topk,2011-04-02T21:28Z,"Explain please how do you fit a 720p 3 hour movie into a 800 MB file?
Why then all the other 720p quality rips are at the very least 1.4 GB and more usually - around 5 GB?"
