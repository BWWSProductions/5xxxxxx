From HarperCollins:

Baseball inspires writers like no other American sport. From columns 
written by sports journalists, to short stories, to memoirs penned by 
the greats of the game, baseball writing holds a place of its own in 
modern literature. Play Ball! celebrates this writing, bringing to life 
the sound of the ball hitting the sweet spot, the roar of the crowd, the 
thrill of a grand slam and the agony of a strikeout. And most 
importantly, the pure joy of the game, for whether we're on the field or 
in the last row of the bleachers, we're all fans.

This collection highlights the poetry, exuberance, and heartbreak of the 
game that is, in Roger Angell's words, "one of the reasons that summer 
exists." Classic stories from baseball's earthy beginnings, profiles of 
icons such as Joe DiMaggio, Carl Erskine, and 'Hammerin' Hank" Aaron, 
graceful essays on the moment a ballplayer becomes an idol, and humorous 
accounts of modern baseball's international reach â€“ Play Ball! presents 
a lively and passionate tribute to America's favorite pastime.

From AudioFile:

It's not every day you find Hammerin' Hank Aaron and Philip Roth in the 
same place. But you will in this unique compendium on America's pastime, 
along with a warm and nostalgic pastiche of writers and voices spanning 
a variety of topics: prejudice and corruption in professional ball, the 
mysteries of the diamond, split-finger fastballs, on-and-off-field 
heroism and high jinks. Grover Gardner warmly intones the commentary 
alongside aging sportswriters and boys of both summer and October. A 
must for any fan of the game, but particularly those with a sense of 
history.
