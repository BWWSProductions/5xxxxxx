Constable Haven's from Canada and Officer Kowarski's from America. They may have differences when it comes to fighting crime, but they have one thing in common. They want to take The Sandman down! They've managed to track down Rocco, one of The Sandman's cronies, to a cabin in the woods. While Officer Kowarski would love nothing more than to beat the shit out of Rocco to get the information he needs, Constable Haven has another "method" of getting Rocco to talk.
