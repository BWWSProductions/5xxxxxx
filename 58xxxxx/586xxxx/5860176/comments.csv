,delboy2004,2010-11-05T03:57Z,"bcos its a iso file thats why u cant unzip it anymore and you need to apply the update or certain games wont run.

simple unzip burn and play "
,larsbergie,2010-11-10T19:30Z,"you have 1.3 gb.
If you are inside, you must click one of the files.
Note: you must have Winrar!
Then you will come to an iso file, click on 1x and then ""take off"".
Then choose disk and then you have iso!

Your download 1.3 gb ... but it is a game of 4.7 gb!"
,Heenan,2010-12-07T20:49Z,"the fact that its 1.3 Gig download and 4.xx .ISO file is because the used wiiscrubber which compressed unnecessary image files and such that i dont know how to explain properly and all the ""empty space"" it does nothing to the game all wiiscrubber  does is make it SUPER compressed when its unpacked it stretches back to original size.
