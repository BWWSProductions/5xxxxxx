,TorrentAffair,2012-06-19T00:07Z,"@vtwin, thank you ever so much for sharing your awesome music collection. You are one of my go-to people for quality torrents. 

@revolabestia Daydream was done by Wallace Collection (not connection). Maybe that's affecting your search results? Unfortunately I can't find Wallace Collection on TPB yet but hopefully someone will post it.

Seeding,
T&A"
