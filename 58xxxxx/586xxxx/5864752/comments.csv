,gunmaker,2010-12-05T15:51Z,"new notice for distributers and to ALL TORRENT USERS

anti p2p organizations are now ddosing users and sending invalidated data OR VIRUSES into our torrents!!

this chocking of our extending seeding is halt !! -able!

download 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/peerblock/files/PeerBlock-Setup_v1.1_r518.exe/download

and prevent most of them from choking you, and rapidsearch for a non viral loic.exe so u can legally retaliate against them!
(ps if u do get a viraled loic.exe u can simply prune the viruses before u reboot, they sit in the main program files menu and a funny looking icon in there as well as your temp folders. simply delete them before rebooting.

THIS IS THE FUCKING PIRATE BAY! WE DONT TAKE CRAP FROM SCALLYWAGS! YARrRrR!"

,ChinMan,2010-12-26T09:12Z,How can I be seeding at 300kbs and downloading at 30kbs. Fuck all you leachers and actually seed for once in your puny lives.
,ReD_MiSt4,2011-01-24T14:38Z,"@ChinMan
This torrent is being targeted by a malicious group who are sucking all your bandwidth and automatically DDOS your IP and PORT that you use for torrents.
This causes some clients like Transmission to upload excessive amount and crash every 2 minutes.

To combat this problem: 1). Make your torrent client use a CLOSED port, this will offer you a firewall defence. 2). I recommend using Deluge with BLOCKLIST enabled

For someone who has time and wants the best results, use uTorrent and set the peer count to around 20, this will allow you to MANUALLY block the offending IP's."
