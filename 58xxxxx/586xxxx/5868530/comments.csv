,Raukan,2010-10-05T22:13Z,This seems like a fake since the same user upped an R5 version of the same movie as well and noone of the trusted a more up-to-date user have upped this at all. Seems fishy to me.
,suade4life,2010-10-05T22:48Z,dvdrip? fakee
,motherloader,2010-10-05T22:50Z,"tis real. 
to the moron above me^^ an R5 is a russian dvd. if you were in russia, this would be what they are selling in stores.  hence its called a DVD and not an R5. because..... wait for it....   its in russian!!!!  and there have been at least three groups release the R5 so far. the other one he upped is one of them and ....wait for it.... its in english!

[T],FaMoUz,2010-10-06T09:53Z,@motherloader true true.. they already have tha DVDRip but tha language iz in russian so wut tha groups do iz take tha russian language out n take an english cam audio n sync it with tha movie kuz we dont have a DVDRip yet 4 tha dvd audio.. but it iz REAL.....
