           Ida and her family live on a beet farm in 1965. She is         
           almost 12, that means she has only one last summer until       
           she has to work with her older sisters on the farm. Due        
           to the increased acreage of the farm this year, Ida's          
           father hires a group of Mexican immigrants to help out         
           with the farm. Among them is Oscar, a boy close to Ida's       
           age. They spend the summer together, teaching each other       
           many lessons along the way while trying to overcome the        
           prejudice that Oscar and his family experiences from the       
           rest of the town.
