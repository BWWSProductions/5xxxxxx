The beauty of the rainforest and the majesty of the river provided a canvas to create lush musical textures and sweeping melodies. Explore the mysterious Amazon through the amazing IMAX (R) experience and celebrate the beauty, vitality and wonder of this magical rain forest, which is disappearing at an alarming rate. Filmmakers overcame many difficulties to photograph this rarely seen tropical landscape and present it with all the visual power associated with IMAX. Narrated by Academy Award-winning actress Linda Hunt, this unique collaboration between an American scientist and a tribal shaman on a mission to find rare medicinal plants will amaze and astound you. 

The combination of the traditional orchestra along with ethnic woodwinds, percussion and choir, created a musical tapestry as rich as the rainforest itself.
