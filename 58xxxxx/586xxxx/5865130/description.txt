About this game:
City Builder combines two classic game mechanics in a fun, bouncy game where players stack water pipes, roads and power lines to form ever-growing cities across the planet's four continents. The game offers a fresh take on classic pipe puzzle games by expanding the gameplay to three overlapping levels: road, underground (water mains) and sky (power lines). Connect resource pieces together to claim land while racing against the clock and overcoming madcap and hilarious obstacles. Solve each resource puzzle and watch each city grow in wacky and unique ways!
