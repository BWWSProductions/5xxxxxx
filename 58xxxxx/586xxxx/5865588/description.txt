Hell's Bells 2: The Power and Spirit of Popular Music 1 - 6

Over three years in the making, this much-anticipated sequel to the original Hell's Bells  series weaves together science, satire, testimonies, parables, interviews, expansive research, and a vibrant Christian perspective to create a video series that is as fascinating as it is educational and evangelistic. Far more than just a commentary on the dangers of popular music, this eight-part, six-hour, up-to-the-minute documentary uncovers the "war of the worldviews" - the epic struggle between good and evil, sin and redemption for the souls of men and the destiny of our culture.
