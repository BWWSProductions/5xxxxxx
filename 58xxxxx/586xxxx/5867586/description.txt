(the best of) New Order is the second compilation album released by the group and follows their first, the hugely successful Substance  album by seven years. The group had taken a hiatus due to tensions and disputes during the recording and touring of their 1993 album, Republic. Republic  had been the first album that the group had released for London Records, and with the group announcing little intention of working together the label went ahead compiling (the best of) New Order.
