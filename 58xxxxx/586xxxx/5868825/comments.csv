,mymateluke,2010-11-21T23:08Z,"Hi Simmyboy. I gave up on DS games about 6 months ago because I couldnt get many of the new releases to work. However, just about every game you have uploaded works on a newly downloaded V1.28 on R4 Upgrade revolution card from R4I-SDHC dot com. Not sure what this ""wood upgrade"" is but ""if it aint broke then dont fix it"" Many thanks for sharing your work and im hoping it will keep the kids quiet for the next few days at least!"
