Mahalaya is an auspicious occasion that is observed seven days before the Durga Puja, and heralds the advent of Ma Durga, the goddess of supreme power. Its a kind of invocation or invitation to the mother goddess to descend on earth â Jago Tumi Jago. This is done through the chanting of mantras and singing devotional songs. There is a special type of devotional bengali music called Agamani which praise Ma Durga. "
,raju_deb,2010-10-03T13:32Z,"Since the early 1930s, Mahalaya has come to associate itself with an early morning radio program called Mahisasura Mardini or The Annihilation of the Demon. This All India Radio (AIR) program is a beautiful audio montage of recitation from the scriptural verses of Chandi Kavya, Bengali devotional songs, classical music and a dash of acoustic melodrama. The program has also been translated into Hindi set to similar orchestration and is broadcast at the same time for a pan-Indian audience. "
