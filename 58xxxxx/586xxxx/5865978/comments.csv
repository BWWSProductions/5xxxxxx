,crando,2010-10-05T13:56Z,after I applied the crack it changed from Tv Suite to redo plus which has nor dvd burning option.
,registered1,2010-10-14T18:56Z,"Unfortunately with nearly all cracked versions of VideoRedo, the output file is cut in half, ie. half the original length - which renders cracked versions practically useless.

The one people will want will be one with a serial."

If you were able to read, you would have comprehended that the problem has nothing to do with installation.  It's only about the results, ie. the output file of encodes when using the cracked exe is cut in half, ie. half the original length!

Just stop posting false information. People want accurate information, not rubbish."

,JQP,2011-04-19T23:28Z,This one's too much for the cr4ckers.  They cut and run when something's difficult.  Last time I checked the ISObuster developer(s) were kicking their asses too.

,registered1,2011-06-06T21:03Z,"@L4F, You were obviously not blessed with a full box of chocolates and what little you were given clearly melted long ago.  What on earth are you talking about?? If you have a problem with a Release, direct your comments at the Uploader, u fool."
