SSP - In Action 038 - Northrop F-5 Talon


Not much known publicly like some of the other U.S. "F" planes (fighters), but one of my top 10 models of all times.
Black color scheme on it, some details, it's modelers shows winner for sure.

And it looks great. Formula 1 among planes. One of must have models :D
