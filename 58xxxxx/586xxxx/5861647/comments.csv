[V],globeplus,2010-10-02T04:52Z,"THIS FILE NEEDED TO BE REUPLOADED FOR A CIRCUNSTANCIAL INCONVENIENCE WITH THE TORRENT DOWNLOAD , SORRY THE USERS ON THE BEFORE FILE BUT PROBABLY WASN´T TOO MUCH DOWNLOADED PERCENTAGE , SO PLEASE TRY TO CONTINUE OR RESTART ON THIS ONE , I CAN´T LET TO MANY USERS FOR WEEKS FOR EXAMPLE GETTING THE FILE FROM A EXTERIOR LINK . THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING , I PROMISE THAT THIS ONE WILL NOT BE CHANGED ANYMORE , LOOKS EVRYTHING PERFECT AND I TESTED THE TORRENT FILE DOWNLOAD AND LOOKS NORMAL TOO ."
[V],globeplus,2010-10-02T05:10Z,"For the users of the before file i suggest the next thing for not loose any percentage with the change : get this new torrent file and change the name of the before downloaded file like this : where was the PC Â» , now this one is PC - and thatÂ´s it the same blocks already in the folder probably available anyway beside the small touch on the name of the file , so first download the new torrent file, second change the name just changing the indicated symbol , where was PC Â» , now is PC - (with a little trace on the place of the other symbol) , third after this little change on the name of the game folder , start the new torrent file that you download now with a small trace and probably the same percentage getted at that moment with the before file is now on the new torrent file with the small modification , i needed to make this change on the file name because i canÂ´t reupload a file with the same name after deleted the file  and after the circunstancial bug getting the torrent file i didnÂ´t had an alternative then reupload after checking that wasnÂ´t possible to return to the normality the download of the torrent file link . Ok , sorry for this small inconvenience and happy downloading , everything looks normal on this one . "
[V],globeplus,2010-10-02T05:35Z,"PROCEDURE TO CONTINUE WITH THE SAME PERCENTAGE BESIDE THE REUPLOAD OF THE FILE :
1 - GET THIS NEW TORRENT FILE
2 - REMOVE ON YOUR TORRENTS FILES PROGRAM THE BEFORE ONE WITH THE » AFTER THE PC WORD
3 - GO TO FOLDER WHERE YOU WAS DOWNLOADING THE FILE AND AT THE NAME CHANGE THE » AFTER THE PC WORD FOR A SMALL TRACE LIKE THIS - THEN THE NAME WILL BE PC - FRONT MISSION EVOLVED directplay by globe@
4 - PUT THE NEW DOWNLOADED TORRENT FILE ON YOUR PROGRAM FOR TORRENT FILES 
AND IF ALL THIS STEPS ARE CORRECT YOU WILL GET THE SAME PERCENTAGE THAT YOU HAD BEFORE ON THE NEW TORRENT FILE .
SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE AND GET YOUR GAME ."

This game is a problem for many users, just like GTAIV.  In my experience these games are not suitable for ripping due to all the pitfalls. Globe`s  games are very difficult to modify after you encounter problems ( patching …reinstalling crack etc. )
However it is a very good sportsgame. I was lucky getting this to run using the WARG torrent. GL."
[V],globeplus,2010-10-02T13:12Z,"To Guuru5 : put one thing in your brain washed personality : GLOBE IS THE BEST ON PRATICAK FILES AND IT IS NO WAY AROUND THAT , just don´t try to act the dissimulate with bullshot that don´t take anywhere , i do the correct analysis on the games and i really do pratical files making sense for the present game that is beeing worked , just don´t try to say things that can incomodate the possible users because i really know what i am doing and by the way if you get a probelem on GTA IV it was your fault because i have hundreds of users that finished the game with my file ."

Well  listen here you incomodate dissimulate bullshot. Whatever that means. I understand that you think you are king of ripping. Your ego is unfortunately far from the truth. ( Respect to Toed and Skullptura) . What about the hundreds who did`nt get it to work ?
By the way what kind of translator do you use ?  Hmm I wonder why people get mixed up."

,SubzeroSkidRow,2010-10-02T19:08Z,"@globe...

me heard alotta bad things about you, why dont you just fakk up, and learn proper english , before ""trying"" to be the best, fyi, THERRE IS NO BEST, either here in peer-2-globe-peer world or in warez scene at all. and yer methods are plain cheap my friend... every user can see your compiled Setup(converter.exe)crap, not that i bothered, but i heard some birds saying., you can open the converter.exe with notepad, to see how you have hide your lame-ass setups... ahwell iam just here to tell ya to piss off...

btw.>>> why you keep telling an untruth to your beloved fans ?? they must-a-have the same level of lameness like you eh?... 
direct.play = at globes releases = liar!

everybody knows who started this, Dopeman, then ToeD, and you keep fukking using it in yer release mr.converter.exe ??... funny to see how many idiots think you are their king!. keep going king, as you said, 
YOU ARE THE BEST , no one can beat you.
you are the true comedian!. lol, go read your own msg's from the last 10 so called uploads, i mean, dont you have to laugh about yerself when you see yer dumbfukked posts?.... 
lets see with what toed comes up here...

and hey iam not this user here
http://thepiratebay.org/user/Subzero!/
just to avoid rumours!.
btw.

note to the bay crew. can you please remove this account here, me just saw that dumbfuxx posts about being the best., and thought to jump in... thx

bye globe, 
""the best"" (haha, look WHO cracked YER release)"

,lukegoodman2001,2010-10-03T03:51Z,well considering i have tried 4 of your uploads which have NOT worked and other people tink the same just give it up
,adrianadrian10000,2010-10-03T06:20Z,"globe: dunno whatchyoo talkin about regarding this torrent not working. I started the DL about 2am, it was finished when I woke up... Downloaded FreeArc, extracted the arc, skipped the wmv ;-) and fired it up. I've only played thru the training and the first mission in the campaign, but i'd say it works AO-fuckin-K... 

SO ANYHOW, should I stop seeding or what? I've already got like 14gb out, so am I just raining on these poor saps' parades or what? Let me know, cuz I'll kill the seed if theres the need!

Dream the plan, plan the Dream"
[V],globeplus,2010-10-04T00:53Z,"To Adrianaadrian10000 : keep playing and finish your game , only the last video after all the game is finished is missing for that go to youtube when available or sites like this :

,guytonetter,2010-10-04T03:55Z,hello mr. globe just to confirm.. so this rip has the ending movie removed right? coz not everygame ending movie has been uploaded on the internet... maybe just maybe have the movie file available for us?? IF thats possible good rip works ok this game rocks.. thanks globe
[V],globeplus,2010-10-04T17:40Z,"To guytonetter : you right looks a little starnge just the last video removed bit all the gameplay is available , now you ask why the remove of this video , first it is safe , no problem on the gameplay because this video , second he have more than 600 mb for probably close 3 minutes or something and absolute no compression and many sites for nice games have videos walkthroughs showing in action the different parts of the game and many ties the youtube show videos with the end of nice games it is a kind of normal too , of course that i expect that it will be not because i decided not to included the video on my file that this normal places showing the videos donÂ´t do it , i think can be a matter of days for somewhere shows up the video but in last case i can try to do something about it but i can+t get the video working without finishing the game because the videos for this game are workedwith a very nice video codifier from Scaleform and only with the video codec it is possible to probably check them and to get this video codec , you can test him but you have to fill a formulary including giving the name of your company , they are lot of nice pc games that work with this video codec but without a registering in a formulary  you canÂ´t get him , so the best way is probably to wait for the videos wallkthroughs that are already going on the work , donÂ´t make any sense i upload 1 video , probably with 3 minutes for more than 600 mb , for that i prefere to upload a nice movie for little more size than that ."

,Shoobox,2010-10-13T14:52Z,"I would like to point out to people who have problems with opening arc files,
i never use freearc.
  i've always used ""Peazip"" its easier and it will open arc files twice as fast"
,Shoobox,2010-10-14T18:28Z,"I would like to point out to people that download globe@ and tptb games using the arc file. if you use peazip instead of freearc it will unpack faster and better if you encounter errors. 
Ive always had issiues with globe@ arc files untill i realized some of his game arc files requires more than 2gb of ram to unpack. 
Peazip will open anything from 7zip to arc files with no issue and faster. 
if its a bigger file like about 7 gigs of arc it takes me about less than ten minutes to open and extract."
