[V],twentyforty,2010-10-02T18:57Z,"@skillet92: For what fucking reason I should do torrent search and provide you with what you want? I gave you one - and how can I know that Season One of some show I never have watched nor have interest in - have 26 episodes? Seriously?

Beside that - posting the external links is forbidden here."
