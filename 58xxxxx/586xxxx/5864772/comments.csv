,subotai68,2010-10-04T21:45Z,Neither this or the 720p seem to have any audio.  Am I the only one having this problem?
[T],insinuendo,2010-10-05T00:52Z,There is audio.
,rebenga2k,2010-10-05T11:25Z,@subotai68: You're obviously an idiot. Please stay off the internet from now on.
[T],insinuendo,2010-10-06T00:21Z,"I don't think he's an idiot.

But rather as you once most probably were (and I): inexperienced, and in need of friendly advice.

Look into: external mediaplayer such as mediagate or http://www.amazon.ca/Western-Digital-Live-Media-Player/dp/B002KKFP9Y

,subotai68,2010-10-06T20:28Z,"@ insinuendo: thanks for your patience and understanding.  The reason that I posted here was that I have downloaded hundreds of torrents just like these -- some from you -- and never had this problem playing them on VLC player.  I wanted to know if it was my problem or if others were experiencing it. I certainly appreciate your advice and will look into it.  

@subotai68: you may have more technical knowledge than me, but you seem to have gained it at the expense of basic social skills.  Why not just smear your feces on yourself, rather than throwing it at passing strangers going about their business?"
,subotai68,2010-10-06T20:31Z,"lol...so yeah, i addressed that last jab at myself.  xD  that's what i get for not just ignoring you, rebenga2k.  I know what arguing with a fool makes me!  "
