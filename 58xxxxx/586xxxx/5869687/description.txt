                    Master Class.                            
                    During a masterclass for talented young  
                    musicians held by famous pianist Sir Michael  
                    Fielding, prodigy Zoe Stock is shocked to  
                    witness a woman drowning in the river, leaving  
                    a baby on the bank. But when police arrive  
                    there is no sign of the woman or her child. DCI  
                    Tom Barnaby is struck by the similarity of the  
                    reported drowning to a mysterious case from 20  
                    years ago.
