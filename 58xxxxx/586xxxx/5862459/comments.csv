,ruudsach,2010-10-04T19:27Z,"Can I see snapshots or screenshots of these movies?

It unbelievable that you provide almost 720p rips almost FIVE-SIX times less than original size.

Please also provide some screenshots of these so called great rips for such small size.

Even RMVB gives this size [300~450MB] but has rendering issues with every player except MPC, and that too is a re-enc of DVDRip.

If ye are busy, which I count that you are, some of your fans who have downloaded this great HD rips kindly upload some screenshots and provide its links here"
