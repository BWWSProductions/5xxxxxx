,laned130,2010-10-23T15:37Z,"""IP Filter Block With uTorrent.txt"" included with the torrent, contains some great advice: bluetack.co.uk/blocklistpro.com keep lists of IP addresses, which most people on this site would be well advised to block.


However, the file also contains a link to a program that promises to auto-download a list, and update uTorrent for you. It actually downloads its ipfilter.dat file via a link through emulepawcio.sourceforge.net, which has had no new news in over 6 years. The .dat file itself looks fairly legit, but: it is not an official blocklistpro release; it looks to be over two months old; and with over 225,000 records, it's impossible to tell if it's malicious or not"

Otherwise, A:8, V:8, Thanks for the up! ;-)
