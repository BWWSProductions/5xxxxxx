,James_Parker,2010-10-30T03:24Z,Oh and for those who has EA DOWNLOAD MANAGER uninstall the download manager and the game too! And then reinstall the game and when it asks that if u want to install EA D.M just click no or cancel. ;) It will work then!

Can somebody help me? Or know a forum that offers help or something?

I have Windows 7, has that got anything to do with it?"
,James_Parker,2010-10-30T10:31Z,I guess maybe The Sims 3 not fully Windows 7 compatible !

,cmax391,2010-11-11T06:07Z,"Thank you James_Parker for the high end loft stuffs key (07SS-EUZF-FIGH-TING-4FUN)

This actually works if you've done it right.

1.After install Fast Lane (the last one), open the mounted image of Fast Lane
2. Double Click on 'ViTALiTY'
3. Double Click on 'Fast Lane Stuff'
4. Copy the crack files (2 of them)
5. Place the crack files onto (C or)D:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 Fast Lane Stuff\Game\Bin This will replace the original files, select 'all'.
6. Start the game from the crack file that replaces the old one.
7. Enjoy

This is really not very complicated but the instructions should be made clearer.

Thank you so very much for this torrent!! I love the Sims!"
,VpS_Serenity,2010-11-13T00:09Z,"Stop listening to those people who doesn't know how to use a tool like DAEMON TOOLS for installing. This is working as described in english version.

 If you faced the Regional Update Error Do the Following .

A).Go to Run and type ( Reg Edit ).
B).Go to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Electronic Arts\\\\sims3]
C).On the Right side you will find a kay called (SKU) Double click on it and edit the Number chose from 2 to 7.
D).You will find a registry Key for each one of the expanstion packs too change the value of SKU if you faced same Error when updateing .

ps: 1=us

Please don't laugh at me. I'm learning xD"
,Anyok6,2010-12-16T03:44Z,"I made a COMPLETE pack, with updates, cracks, and keys. It might well possibly contain material from this torrent, but it is a complete, updated package that worked with NO region issues or any others. If you download, be sure to look at the revised instructions for the torrent, as I fucked it up when I packaged it. They are found in my comments as well as the torrent info.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6038230/The_Sims_3_Complete_-_12-2010

Thanks .BONE. for making this available though, helped me get my full package together.
