,elite-sky,2010-10-11T10:36Z,Hey Quad-K I know that Kaspersky Pure has the exact same features as kaspersky internet security and more but why isnt it as popular? is it like crappier protection or something?
,adatinis,2010-10-13T03:56Z,"Hi Quad-K !
Thanks for great upload, I have big trouble,
Today and tonight I was trying many antivirus`es,
but none of them updates... I think I have big problem cuz even this monster doesn`t start to update, and now it shows that it got failed :o
And more, it finds one or maybe more wiruses, which can`t be deleted by unupdated untivirus, what could I do with this laptop?
(Reintalation of all windows`es in this laptop is nessesary then, but I can`t cuz it have only 1 loacal disc C: and much imortant information)
ANY1 PLZ HELP! How to make it again shiny and nice pc? ;/
Thanks"
,Quad-K,2010-10-13T06:38Z,"@adatinis,

This is not the place for computer related help, but i will help you anyways.

I would recommend downloading a bootable copy of linux, using it to copy all your important files to another location. Then have them scanned and cleaned via another computer with updated antivirus. Then reinstall your computer and all your programs and put your important files back on. And don't forget to make regular backups to at least 2 locations."
,Quad-K,2010-10-13T06:39Z,PS. NEVER install more than 1 antivirus at the same time. Can cause big issues.
,Tatletz,2010-10-18T09:00Z,"Thank you Seven7i & Quad-K,
It works like a charm. I am using it on my laptop and all is good so far. You guys have done wonderful job. Will post later if there are any issues. "
,Quad-K,2010-10-18T09:56Z,Its a pleasure Tatletz =]
,sparkythewondersquid,2010-10-20T05:29Z,Worked just as advertised Great work
,Tatletz,2010-10-20T23:49Z,"Once again great job Quad-K&Seven7i!
Just wondering if this will work on the trial version of the product downloaded directly from kaspersky's website. Thanks guys!"
,Tatletz,2010-10-26T01:14Z,FYIO: I did experimented it with a trial version downloaded  from kaspersky's website and it works top notch!  :) 
,Clemenator,2010-11-01T15:39Z,"Hey mate all was good, till last step were u said update restart update.. update just keep timein out, so just did restart than was going to update however keep getting error.. AVP application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000022). 
running W7 64bit gamers.. any help or ideas would be great..
i will also try on my 2nd hard drive as it is W7 64 bit ultimate to make sure not just a problem with gamers edition..    "
,Clemenator,2010-11-01T23:15Z,"sorry mate i'm an idiot :) under exclusions i just copied & paste from txt doc, but that was useless because on my computer its under programs files(86), not program files.. after i directed it to the correct place worked like a charm :)  

Thanks mate u r the best "
,venomhed,2010-11-04T19:02Z,"DOESN'T WORK!

Windows 7 x64 Ultimate

Tried the entire process twice with .192, always gives me 30/31 days no matter what.

Used the uninstaller but it always says KAV AVP (or similar) is installed no matter if I ran the uninstaller, rebooted, checked registry etc.

:("
,venomhed,2010-11-05T18:08Z,"BTW I forgot to add. It states my trial will expire

12/5/2020 but I still have 31 days left?

So this shows that I did do the process right, as the year is 10 years from now, but looks like Kaspersky Labs figured out a way to check the date and thus I only get 31 days."
,Quad-K,2010-11-08T05:35Z,It's working for me and everyone else so ..
,sandipani,2010-11-08T17:34Z,"Hi Quad k...
First of all thank u very much for the pure crack that worked for me. Now it shows that i am licenced till 2016.
My query is recently i downloaded the new version of kaspersky pure ie 9.1.0.124 not that previous one of 9.0.0.192 and applied the anti blacklist crack as per your instructions and doing that also showed me the same result that is i am licenced till 2016. Will it work in future or this crack is not applicable to the new version.
Till now since 2 days the updates are working fine.Thanks again and a great upload. Hope u keep up your gud works."

,Quad-K,2010-11-15T10:10Z,"To be honest, im not too sure if it'll work on future versions as they may patch the holes that the crack uses to extend the license."
,clonker,2010-11-24T10:49Z,Works perfect :) thx Quad-K

,pravin_29,2011-03-06T11:57Z,"Key provided in this upload has been detected and blocked by Kaspersky. The only way as said by youse123 is to disable self defense, exit kaspersky and then copy the two fitlib.dll and fitlin.ini to the program files folder. Start again Kaspersky, it will show till 2016. This procedure needs to be repeated every time your restart your pc but not when you hibernate."
,NeoTheKillerGod,2011-05-05T05:38Z,Does anyone else get a skin change of kaspersky pure after they put the two files in the directory and open kaspersky?
,NeoTheKillerGod,2011-05-05T16:49Z,"Mine always changes into Kaspersky Anti-virus 2010 after I put the files in Kaspersky's directory and open kaspersky.After I quit for the first time then Kaspersky won't open anymore,Any Ideas?"
,moody1316,2011-05-10T10:51Z,"i followed all instructions, installed successfully, then restarted. But after restarting kaspersky does not launched..any solutions?.. pls help!!"
,NeoTheKillerGod,2011-05-11T02:17Z,same problem here..I guess it won't work with the latest version of kaspersky so I went to the trial resetter instead.About your problem just uninstall kaspersky and reinstall it.
