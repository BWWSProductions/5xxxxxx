,TranceStation,2010-10-03T19:48Z,"Hey Segel, do you think you could explain again why I'm having trouble seeing all of your other uploads.  You upload the best trance radio stations and do the best job separating them.  I just want to be able to get your previous uploads again.  I would REALLY appreciate it the help.  Thanks"
[V],IndexTrance,2010-10-06T00:31Z,"Impossible to get them! Have them all stored on my portable but i cannot upload them again, would take to much time and will not generate enough seed from p2p.. So you'll just have to download future releases instead :) Take Care!"
,TranceStation,2010-10-06T17:39Z,"Oh! ok, thanks. Yeah, I was just really confused as to what happened.  That's understandable.  Thanks Segel, keep up the great work!"
