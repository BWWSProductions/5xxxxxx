"The Measure of a Manmeet"

When Todd (Ben Rappaport) reluctantly 
begins employee evaluations, the staff 
becomes nervous about their job security. 
After Todd's boss Jerry (Matt Walsh) 
reviews the sales numbers, he tells Todd 
to fire one of his employees. Unwilling to 
lose a team member without a fight, Todd 
hatches a plan to save his staffer.

Enjoy :)
