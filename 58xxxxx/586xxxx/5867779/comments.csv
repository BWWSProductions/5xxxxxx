,bufster,2010-10-06T11:06Z,"Really liking this show and the three main characters. EZ is slow for some reason, happy i get to see it.

Thanks"
,JaGreys,2010-10-06T15:24Z,"I think I'm speaking on behalf of non-Canadians here, and sorry about busting your hat, but you ARE a legend! Keep up the good work."
[V],err0001,2010-10-06T19:43Z,"@bufster: 

EZTV distributes scene content but doesn't create it itself. 

In this case it appears that the scene did not create a video file, so there was nothing for EZTV to release."

[T],despo1ler,2010-10-11T17:56Z,"keep up the early releases if possible pls, it took a week for the ""scene"" to release this episode and when they did they missed the 1st 30 seconds or so which show the end of the show just b4 flipping back in time to how it all began...."
