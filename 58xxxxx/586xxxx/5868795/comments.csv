#1. During the draft, there's NO SOUND unless you turn on the music and menu music....is there originally any voice commentary or draft-day sound effects during the draft, or is it supposed to be that way?

#2. Someone said the Michael Jordan feature isn't working. I haven't tried it yet....does anybody know if it's working? Can anybody verify this??

Other than that, from what I HAVE tried, things seem to be working fine..."
,slamwoo,2010-10-09T03:49Z,Please seed i will seed for a week if i have to as long as I'm playing the game 
,bjst13,2010-10-09T05:54Z,"FYI the Jordan challenge is there(why will they remove it:/) you just have to sign in a user profile to be able to save the settings.

The game looks good, but somehow I felt disappointed with the controls. I thought they had completely eliminated the 'canned animation issues' but it seems that it was still there(for ex. the sizeup is still canned, they just include a sizeup in each direction and you can perform one of it by pressing each of the directions by holding LT)and it's kinda delayed, so where's the responsiveness/total control there?
Or I could be wrong since I'm just using a generic usb controller. I'm still figuring out how to do moves like spin move, double cross, behind the back etc.

I think maybe you just have to get use to it for you to enjoy the game more."

,Strangeway74,2010-10-09T16:05Z,"The game works perfectly (Jordan challenges and all) but there is one very BIG caveat to everyone before you install!  The game appears to block your computers access to any 2kSports web content, including www.2ksports.com (so you can't even view the website in IE or Firefox).

What this means is that if you have any legit 2K games installed, they WILL NOT WORK ONLINE!  Mine are all f'd.  Does anyone know how to undo this???"
,Strangeway74,2010-10-09T16:07Z,"This game works beautifully (Jordan challenges and all).  However, there is one VERY important caveat!

In cracking this, they apparently blocked your computer from accessing any 2KSports web content.  This includes simply opening 2ksports.com in your browser or accessing any 2Ksports servers.

,bjst13,2010-10-11T03:53Z,"For those who are complaining about the slow download try this:

(This was originally use for utorrent but can work in other torrent applications as well, you just have to find a similar option there:p)

In utorrent window click Options-Preferences,
then on the left side with a list of options, click Bandwidth, in the number of connections area,
enter 60000 for global maximum number of connections, and 59999 for maximum number of connected peers.. Hope it works for yah because it increased my download speed significantly after trying this tweak.

@iampeso maybe your system specs are low, or ur vid card? 
@FFCSL600 it happens to me also in one occasion when I'm replaying a play, but when I went back to the game everything return to normal. You might need to clear your NBA 2k11 cache and start a new one (located in your C:\Documents and Settings\'your user account here'\Application Data\2K Sports\NBA 2K11\Cache )

Extract files

Run ""Setup.bat""

Let the installation begin

Install DirectX when prompted

Command prompt will show ""All OK"" but DO NOT close the command prompt. You will see ""Press any key..."" when it's finished"

The reason I want to do a complete uninstall is because at the beginning of the game, I created a player (Not a Player FILE) ... and made that player with really high stats (was my first time playing and experimenting). I put him on the Phoenix Suns roster because I thought that I was choosing where I wanted to play with that character. Apparently not as I found the right way to create a character and went through the whole drafting process. Eventually I had a game against Phoenix and behold my character had REPLACED Steve Nash.

Also, in MyPlayer mode, when I want to add skill points to my man, I can't switch to defense or physic skills. I'm stuck with the attack skills. It tells me to use [   and   ]  but it doesn't work. "
,miduza123,2011-08-26T14:34Z,"gordonflash39 it's a rip, don't you know what's rip for?. You can delete it directly from your hard drive. No need to Click Add of Remove Programs on Control Panel.

Offtopic: Rip is a compressed file that lowers video quality, which means if there are cutscenes in the game, the video will become a normal video instead of HQ."
