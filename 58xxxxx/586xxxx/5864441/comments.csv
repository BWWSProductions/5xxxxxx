,noruas2004,2010-10-12T09:17Z,"it's mkv, so you can disable the subtitles I suppose?"

,Anti_Toast,2010-10-15T00:18Z,"Hey guys, I've been a regular in the movie scene, and while this is undoubtedly an awesome release I don't think I'll be watching it. This morning I woke up and found that TWC shut off my internet, and left me with a cease and desist message in my browser. I'd rather not have to face any settlements or anything, so I think this is the end of the road for me. 

Good luck to everyone else out there, but as for this one I think it might be tracked. I guess that's what I get though, for wanting to watch this movie with my girl. "

,pacocrowley,2010-10-15T20:38Z,"What the hell is TWC? Anyway, sue their ass off for shutting your ""internet"" off, without a legal reason (I'm thinking that the reason is to download movies from TPB). Once my mom grounded for 1 month without internet for smoking pot, that doesn't stopped me from doing that; it seems like you're being paranoid."
,pacocrowley,2010-10-15T20:39Z,"Lol I mean ""asses"" :D

BTW, the movie looks awesome, and I love the ending :>"

,TheChosen1_,2010-10-16T12:47Z,"Thx for the upload -jonny-

I want to ask all of u about watching .mkv movies in notebook.When I watch a .mkv in my notebook , it seems like a divx or slightly better than it.I know the LCD panel of it isnt HD but I just wonder that does it really make a huge difference watching it in a 42"" or 46"" LCD or LED TV ?

Thx for ur answers guys.And thx for the movie again."

,schnewitchen,2010-10-30T20:01Z,".mkv files are for Apple computers, iPads and iPhones. it is a Quicktime file extension used by macintosh so that things can be compressed into smaller files for phone usage (like the iPhone) Sony does not offer this extension for the PS3, because it is not an apple product. you can download a media converter (like iMedia) and convert your file extensions into .avi or .mp4 for them to play on the PS3"

It's just not a format/container that Sony allows.

Use mkv2vob to make the file compatible.  "
,Trance183,2010-11-05T18:51Z,These guys weren't lying. I think someone from the MPAA is posing as a casual uploader and he has this torrent under watch. Its not that unusual for an MPAA dude to hop on a popular torrent. Lets just hope P2P Protection Software works.

I really love that you upload so many BluRay torrents, but sometimes you say irrational things.
