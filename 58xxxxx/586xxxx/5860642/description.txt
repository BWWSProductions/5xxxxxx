"When it Rains, it Pours"

When Liz Lemon (Fey) is surprised that more 
men have been noticing her, Jenna (Jane 
Krakowski) explains that she is coming off 
as more confident because of her new 
relationship. In turn, she uses her 
confidence to solve Pete's (Scott Adsit) 
problem with a persnickety editor (guest 
star Giamatti). Meanwhile, Jack (Alec 
Baldwin) decides he must cheat mortality in 
order to teach his and Avery's (guest star 
Banks) unborn son how to live. Elsewhere, 
Tracy (Tracy Morgan) is determined to be 
there when his wife gives birth, and a 
mystery man is making sure Kenneth's (Jack 
McBrayer) work at "TGS" is still getting 
done.

Enjoy :)
