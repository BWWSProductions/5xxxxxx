[T],Ch4cal,2010-10-05T10:11Z,The main dialogue is Hebrew. English subs provided
[T],Ch4cal,2010-10-05T13:28Z,"Hey Admin..., you guys need to add Hebrew and Arabic to your list of selectable languages!"
[T],Ch4cal,2010-10-05T14:51Z,"If you'd watched the movie, you'd have known that there are several Lebanese actors. If you can't be bothered to watch it then at least please watch your mouth... "
[T],Ch4cal,2010-10-05T15:16Z,Even your handle is distasteful 
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-05T23:59Z,"are the subs hard coded?

I downloaded another version that didn't have hard subs, and .sub files aren't supported on the WD TVLive."
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-06T04:20Z,"ch4cal, don't let nitwits and morons like FS bother you.  

They only spout that shit because it makes their uneducated, low-IQ, menial wage-labor lives feel important and ""strong"".

They are weak and feeble minded."
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-06T04:24Z,"besides, it appears to be somewhat of an ""anti war"" war movie, or at least it doesn't seem to be making war seem glorious and clean.

It portrays it as dirty, dangerous, full of moral conflict and lots of civilian casualties.

But ""anti zionist conspiracy"" loons don't have the mental capacity to pick up on those nuances."
[T],Ch4cal,2010-10-06T21:53Z,"@PhilLesh12, no the subs are muxed into the mkv, so they can be turned off if required. Yep, you're right it is a strongly anti-war movie and has a surprisingly frank moral viewpoint"
,STGstylah,2010-11-13T00:56Z,Thanks!
,ManLemon,2011-01-17T15:48Z,"Excellent, been waiting to see this one (will also buy it when/if the blueray is released here in the NL). One of the weirdest cultural problems (yeah, I know, understatement) I've lived around is the one in and around Israel."
