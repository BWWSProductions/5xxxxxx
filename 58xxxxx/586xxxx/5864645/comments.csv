,jetten,2010-10-10T20:20Z,Works really great with USB Loader GX!
,Bladdezz,2010-10-14T04:00Z,i tried burning this and using neogamma and couldnt get it to work. i then tried playing it with Configurable USB Loader and still coulnt get it to work. any ideas?
[V],r3dcat,2010-10-14T10:45Z,@Bladdezz: Sounds like the issue might be your setup ... Works fine for me with Configurable USB Loader v60; 4.2E; Hermes cIOS 222 v4 38 merged 37
,RatchetJnr,2010-10-15T13:07Z,"Many thanks r3dcat! Running fine with neogamma R7 IOS 249 (Rev 14). Had a Jap copy for a while now, but nice to have one in english.
xCHEERSx "
,Bladdezz,2010-10-16T12:12Z,"i have a very similar setup r3dcat. but when i start it up there is a video issue of sorts which prevents me from playing the game, everything else such as sound work fine."

,Bladdezz,2010-10-20T04:39Z,btw cause im sure it prolly makes a difference im using a NTSC-U wii.
,1000Grams,2010-10-21T13:06Z,if u wii is mod it dont matter it wil play both regions 
,jopi328,2010-10-28T11:48Z,"I don't know what chip you are using, but if it's an wiikey or flatmod it will work for you on ntsc-u wii!
I'm excited to play the game "
,Bladdezz,2010-10-30T02:00Z,mines only softmodded so is there another step or something to make the wii region free?
,Bladdezz,2010-11-01T23:05Z,actually just got some other PAL games and they work fine as soon as i toggle the video to NTSC in configurable loader
,brell69,2010-11-02T17:33Z,thanks for the upload worked great thanks!
,gazzer73,2010-11-16T05:35Z,"I had to join up just to say this:

Its pretty mean to share Wii games in this WBFS format!

And yes I use a WODE but Im not going to rip from it lol"
,gazzer73,2010-11-16T05:58Z,Oh and I cant get it to work as an ISO on the WODE
,gazzer73,2010-11-16T06:05Z,Game doesnt seem to work as an ISO on a PAL Wii on a WODE
,Dineen94,2010-11-21T02:42Z,Great Game! Convert it to iso with 'Wii Backup Manager'
,farhank,2010-12-14T10:45Z,what language does the host speak in? cost the other wii party torrent isnt in english
,ttguy2,2011-02-04T10:22Z,No the host does not speak english. But the written instructions on the screen are in english. And my kids don't seem to mind the host speaking in tounges. I can report this works after converting to an ISO and burning with ImgBurn and running on a softmod Wii with Neogamma  R7 IOS 249 (Rev 14)
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-02-18T01:11Z,"If your Wii is NTSC (North American) and you have downloaded this rom, make sure you have the setting ""Force NTSC"" or it's equivalent on with whatever usb loader you are using. If the game is still in black & white, just search for the NTSC version of the game"
,hakuna_matata,2011-06-10T19:51Z,"This is a good game...
