,KennyFesting,2011-02-16T11:50Z,"Hey guys, I just downloaded this file. Speed was great but I tried to play it and got the message: 

No suitable decoder module:
VLC does not support the audio or video format ""undf"". Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this.

It wouldn't play in Windows Media Player originally, so tried VLC which normally plays everything - no luck. Normally can play files fine but have had this problem twice today. Any ideas?"
