[V],psspss,2011-09-08T01:05Z,"Ep2 avi header damage is easily
fixed with a free video editor called
avidemux very good product like virtualdub 
but gui-ed for windows

just load it into package then say yes
to unpack.. then simply save file back to a new filename.. takes about 1 minute to make new file

however vlc 1.12 will play it fine.. as it rebuild index for you or skip it but ont be able to slide the time as fast.. best to fix it as stated :)

have link to avidemux latest but google it"
