thats a negative on that request...

I've seen the comments on others whom do this list thing.... and people start pushing for the movies to come out... id rather just surprise people with new and old movies ;)"

,lekkeralgemeen,2010-10-05T16:09Z,"Hi, one little comment on your uploads. Could you change the naming of your files? Like the folder will be Love Ranch (PiZ)-OOO, but the movie, can that just be Love Ranch? Or is there a specific reason for this type of naming? BTW, I think it's more ordered with my suggestion, that's why. For the rest, your up's are awesome!"
