Bodycall's "Somatic Turn" is a mixture of EBM and synthpop. Influenced by the great of the EBM scene like And One or Nitzer Ebb just to name a few, it fits perfectly into the poetics of the good times of electronic body music and alternative electronic scene as a whole.

Somatic Turn is also in fact strongly positioned within the synthpop genre, especially in its oldschoolish flavor. Somatic Turn is the first and last album of this kind coming from Bodycall. Later on the band succumbed to more contemporary type of dark electronic music, like dark electro, aggrotech and so on. 

Bodycall's Somatic Turn is not to be missed by anybody who follows the old school electronics, be it EBM, synthpop or early dark electro.
