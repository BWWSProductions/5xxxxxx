,axemblack,2011-06-15T18:08Z,"SidewayDan, you'd never get quality like this at this size with AVI... MP4 and MKV are the way to go. I don't bother with AVIs at all anymore

great rip, very rare to find a release of this size that is genuinely good quality"
,axemblack,2011-06-16T13:14Z,i take it back... the audio is terrible. Its only 48kbps. don't bother with this one. Shame cos the video is pretty good!
,zammil23,2011-08-06T09:14Z,"hi goku61 
I admire ur work and have many of ur downloads like sixth sense, big lebowski, batman begins etc which are of small size and excellent quality like secretmyth,3li and HDlite.I'm a movie geek and like to have  HD prints of classic films(under 2.5 GB).but some films have been missing on my list which does not have a good HD print on torrent sites i know it's too much to ask for u 2  do certain movies as many users have.but i can't help myself not asking u.
1.Apocalypse now redux  version(1979) 
2.Gladiator extended remastered  10th anniversery version(2000)
3.The Rock(1996)

Apocalypse now redux hd  print is available(belboy) but it's above 3 GB
Gladiator is done by secretmyth but it's very dark( ripped from defective version)and remastered edition done by bellboy(not good and huge file size)
can u do these films about 2.5 GB.
Thanks
