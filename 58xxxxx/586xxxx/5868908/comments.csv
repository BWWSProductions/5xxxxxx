,Tyreezy,2011-03-17T14:49Z,"So, I guess you can't play this straight from the .img files on an emulator like psx2? You might be able to, but every time I do I just get the black screen. Ideas on why? Might just be my bios/plugins... haven't messed with it much. thanks"
,Tyreezy,2011-03-17T14:51Z,"correct that, they are all C0# files but i converted them into an UltraISo file using UltraISO and still doesn't work."
