Alex welcomes back to the show Daryl Metcalfe, a member of the Republican Party currently serving in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Metcalfe's annual Second Amendment rally was investigated by an Israeli-based company under a contract by the Pennsylvania Department of Homeland Security. The company, the Institute of Terrorism Research and Response, told the state the police might have to provide â€œcrowd control" during Metcalfe's event. 
[2nd half of hour 1]




Alex also talks with English columnist and novelist James Delingpole. He writes for The Times, The Daily Telegraph, and as a television critic for The Spectator. Delingpole is a critic of the theory of man-made climate change. He is the author of several books, including Welcome to Obamaland: I Have Seen Your Future and It Doesn't Work.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
