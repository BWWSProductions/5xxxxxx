if you guys/gals want to download this you have to learn how to seed good along with downloading.

(the more you share/seed the more i can get the data out a bit to help your download)

75 leachers with only me seeding ( @ max bandwith = too 750kbs) is not gona speed this up. so if you do dl this pich in & help seed this wile downloading. also help seed after done downloading.

(uploading speed would be at least for the lowest speed shold be 150kbs per person)

SEED!!! PLZZZ this rpg is well worth the download"

""when i tries to start the IAlauncer it pops up something with that i have to "" locate my aion.bin to continue "" ?

well at this point with having the IAlauncer window open next to the launch button is options.

click on that & on the pop up window pick browse.. next to aion location: & browse too where your aion.bin file is located. witch should be here : C:\Program Files\NCSoft\Aion\bin32\AION.bin"

,guillaume430,2010-11-23T06:41Z,"fuck you big dick there is a fucking trojan, its the AI launcher nice try asshole"
,GLR457mAn,2010-12-01T15:55Z,"@ applecakeman try running the game on a pc not a laptop. this game is very detailed & req alot of pc power.

@ Agropain try to force recheck your download if your having crorrupting issues. might be a bad hash check in there somewhere.."
,GLR457mAn,2010-12-01T16:08Z,"@ guillaume430 plz dont be a troll & make false claims that the AI launcher is & or has a trojan/virus in it.

its strate from InfiniteAION.com 1000's of ppl  have used that launcher to connect to the private server and your the only troll that claims thats its a trojan/virus.

its ppl like you whos killing good torrents with false claims such as yours. just because it doesnt work for you (prob cant even fig out how to even install it correctly) or pc isnt strong enough to run it. is not my fault. go by a real pc kid before making false claims."

that sounds like a issue you need to take up with InfiniteAION. aka that issue your having should be posted on there fourms & not here..

might be that when you guys/gals made a account there server might of been down or doing updated to the server. as this does happen from time to time.. but again id ask InfiniteAION about that matter.. as for theres nothing i can do about login issues.."
,Liandreii,2011-08-17T12:52Z,How do I know which version to use exactly for infinite aion? I mean should i just let NCsoft keep on updating till the latest version?

,shipz2640,2011-10-30T00:11Z,"Guys, all you need to do is go to InfiniteAION's website (infiniteaion.com), click on ""CONNECT"" at the top, and follow the instructions and it will work like a charm.

You will be able to download everything you need extremely quickly, and won't have to deal with waiting on seeders."
