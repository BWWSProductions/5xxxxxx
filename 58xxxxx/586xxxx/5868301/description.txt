I havent found jfk airport at TPB thatswhy i found it necessary to upload it.Its one of the largest airports in our world.The textures are  ulti realistic.If you dont have a strong processor or graphics card then do NOT install it.I t may slow down your performance and make fsx crashing

Instructions:

1)run jfk_fsx_setup.exe

2)run crack

3)click "patch"

4)click save (or overwrite)

5)After that in the patcher the following message should have appeared "PATCHING DONE"

6)Run fsx and fly!!!!
