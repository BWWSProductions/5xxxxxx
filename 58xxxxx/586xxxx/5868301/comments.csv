,grfam,2010-10-05T17:54Z,is this crack safe? :)
,Jimstalk,2010-10-05T18:25Z,lol of course!!Its from kommu dude....If you dont trust me scan it with your antivirus
,irikimoss,2010-10-05T22:31Z,"don't trust your antivirus completely, I use an even better method:

sandbox IE. If you run the .exe in a sandbox and it doesn't create strange files in C:\windows or do anything wrong, you can _almost_ be sure it's a clean file. I ran all keygens/cracks/patchs inside a sandbox, and I have yet to be infected for 2 years WITHOUT an anti-virus. go and try it:

sandbox IE

,Jimstalk,2010-10-06T07:01Z,"@irikimoss

This patcher is made by Komu.Its the same with ariane's 737 but it patches different files.You you still dont trust it guys download sandboxes and whatever you want.Why should i upload a virus.Its not my first upload.The cls 747 series,the ka-50 X,the grumman albatross were all my uploads.IF YOU DONT TRUST IT DONT DOWLOAD IT"
,Jimstalk,2010-10-06T07:02Z,"@buckrodgers

I have the product you need.Ill try to upload it as a rip because the .exe asks for identification"

,Jimstalk,2010-10-06T19:01Z,im trying to upload the cessna 337 but for some reason i cant see the kaptcha letters.Any ideas???
,N-Z,2010-10-07T03:06Z,"Ok, I'll be the dummy. I can't find any instructions on where to put the patched files made by the crack utility, a couple I can work out but not the others. Anyone care to share. Cheers"
,snapshot88,2010-10-07T05:45Z,"Crack does not work, after you think you patched the files correctly it still shows up as a trial. It might of been simple for you because this is your upload but for dummies like me please explain in better detail how to use the crack. Thanks"
,snapshot88,2010-10-07T05:47Z,"Looking for the new Irissim A-10 Warthog, or the CS 707. anyone has these please upload thanks"
,Jimstalk,2010-10-07T14:34Z,"The patcher is the simplest thing.Read carefully

1.After installing jfk open the patcher
2.Click patch
3After that some windows should have appeared
4.Click save and then click OK on the smaller window which will appear
5.This will happen with 5 or 6 dll's
6.After that a window should appear (registry information)(only for win vista and win 7 users//in xp registry will be added automatically)
7.Click ok
6.''Patching done"" message should have appeared in the patcher
8Run fsx and fly!"
,Jimstalk,2010-10-07T14:36Z,If you still experience problems ill upload a video on youtube(something like a tutorial).Just inform me
,Jimstalk,2010-10-07T19:10Z,"Please upload:Cls md-80 or cs 707

Can the same patch be used for KLAS and KDFW? thanks"
,Jimstalk,2010-10-08T14:10Z,"The crack supports the following airports:

KJFK KORD LSGG LSZH"
,Jimstalk,2010-10-08T14:12Z,"vkk68:

 try it with KLAS.It may work....."
,Jimstalk,2010-10-09T09:22Z,"@ richiperu

You dont see the terminals right???After installing,when opening fsx 2 windows will ask you to verify some dll's.(happens with every payware).youll have to verify both of the dll's(click ""ok""or whatever).The first dll supports the runways and the second supports the terminals+main buildings.Try to reinstall the software and then verify both of the files!!

This error usually happens because TPB is changing his internal IP adress every 1 hour.Just wait for a while and then try again! "
,Jimstalk,2010-10-09T09:30Z,Guys i have  good news & bad news for you.The good news are that i bought yesterday the md80.Its so different from the other cls products.His manual is 160 pages and the manual for a real md80 is only 90 pages xD.The virtual cockpit is just amazing.Everything is clickable in there.Its the best payware ive ever seen.The bad news are that the mad dog is uncrackable!!!A RIP version is not going to work...Any ideas??

,Jimstalk,2010-10-24T15:52Z,Why are you talking like this??Read the first page and youll see what makes it an ultimate edition.If you cant recognise the difference between standard & ultimate then delete these files from your pc and dont post annoying messages.just visit FSDreamteam's site for more specific info

,perckypick,2010-12-15T09:41Z,"Hey Jim, Thanks a lot for the torrent (not sarcasm), but I'm having some trouble. The textures for the runways, trees, etc. are loading, in fact the whole thing is working, except ONE part....the buildings! The terminal buildings aren't loading, in their place is just nothing....if you want I can upload a photo.

Any idea of how to fix this?"
,N988JF,2010-12-24T10:39Z,"Jimstalk, Thank you for this awesome download!
Many thanks for the seeders! Fast as heck. I will keep the seed going.
