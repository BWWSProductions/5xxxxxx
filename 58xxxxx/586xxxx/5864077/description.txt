This was a record much loved by the indie kids at high school and i must confess i enjoyed listening to my battered cassette recording of this . 

Whats particularly impressive is not just that these are songs composed and sung by a teenager at the time but that their is such an impressive melodic sophistication about so many of the songs . 

If roddy frames delivery is at times a little too sweet , then its coupled with a great honesty or naivete . Whatever it is , it makes the songs pleasant to listen to . 

Take "oblivious" for example , trilling latin guitars ,cooing backing vocals and an infectious beat - hit single written all over it . Following that would be tricky but he actually betters its sunny disposition several times with great tunes like "pillar to post" "walk out to winter" and "we could send letters" . "back on board" is another favourite with its moping strums and gusts of organ and harmonica.
