So I created a new torrent, slightly renamed, and uploaded that. Hope I didn't handle this the wrong way. :-\"

When I input the new SN. Then closed and reopend the pgm. When I delete a page from a doc and save it, the doc shows up with watermark. I'm not sure why."
,cable.guy,2011-04-12T21:18Z,thats because you need to upgrade your software from free to pro version by using the keygen provided in the torrent......
