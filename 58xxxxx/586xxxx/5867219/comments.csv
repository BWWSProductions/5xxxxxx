,grand1987,2010-12-06T17:06Z,"Hey To the people who are having a problem with the black screen... the reason why it's black is because they're supposed to be a video there.. you need to download the video patch.. and also the 1.02 patch. just search for them on google.

,corinteno,2011-04-19T18:40Z,"I mounted using Virtual Clone Drive. (Windows 7.) I was having similar issues as some of you. After mounting install disc, the setup screen would come up, and after I clicked install, nothing would happen. I gave up after a bit and decided to look up porn, but after a while the setup screen finally came up asking where I wanted to install. Finished the installation after that with no problems, but when I start the game a black screen comes up. At this point I'm gonna try grand1987's suggestion. 
P.S. While on the black screen, I press Esc and the New Game - Continue screen appears. I move the mouse but there is no pointer. (Don't know if you are supposed to see pointer at this point.) If I press the regular Enter key nothing happens, but if I press the Enter key on the number pad I hear an error sound, but still nothing happens. Just extra information, don't know if it matters/helps."
,rskredz,2011-04-30T13:15Z,"pls help... im new with this, i hve completed the installation... but wen i start the game, an error msg saying insert disc 1,2 and 3... do i hve to burn this game on a disc or is there any possible way to get it from my pc, where there is the downloaded file... pls help...."

,Max219,2011-09-06T13:01Z,"Okay go to : http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads
And download DAEMON Tools Lite. Install it, run it and hit the button where it is a picture of a cd room and has white lethers over it: SCSI.
Now hit the CD-button in DAEMON Tools Lite with + over it. You go find the file you want to use and mount it.
Problem solved.
Plz contact me if I'm wrong."

,Urthurian,2011-09-21T05:42Z,"ePSXe is annoying, having to tweak video settings everytime i decide to play different game.  Plus it does not register to my brain why the hell would old PS1 game have incredibly low FPS, thus lag on today's PC when settings are on medium quality.  I'm gonna give this a try now that there are no stupid exams or tests hindering my adventure, wahaha!"
,Government10,2011-10-25T01:06Z,"If you're having the black screen problem....

DOWNLOAD THE ""TRUEMOTION""CODEC

Its an old codec that was used to play FF7 movies.

the reason you are seeing the black screen,  is the fact that there is a movie that is suppose to be playing,  and your PC doesnt have the codec to actually play it.

google, ""True Motion codec Final fantasy 7""  should be the second clickable link."
,Philonetic,2011-12-21T20:36Z,"For those looking for the best possible version of FFVII...

I've uploaded an Original mod pack with all the mods separated and the old original readme's included, you can find it here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6903748

You can find my alternate mod package with the newer creations here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6903757

BONE rocks"
