Alex talks with the Health Ranger, Mike Adams, in-studio. Adams, a former high-powered software executive, began his mission as the Health Ranger in response to his own failing health. He is the founder of NaturalNews.com, an online news source covering all areas of personal and planetary wellness from nutrition to renewable energy. Mike has written thousands of articles and built a following of over 800,000 people across the globe. Adams also founded a non-profit organization, The Consumer Wellness Center, an online retail center, Better Life Goods, and the popular publishing company, Truth Publishing. Mike speaks frequently at national and local gatherings like the Amazon Herb Summit and the Raw Foods Challenge in Los Angeles.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
