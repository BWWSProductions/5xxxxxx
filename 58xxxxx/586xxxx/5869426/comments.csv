,Rnwbcsmf,2010-10-14T11:20Z,"Hey I'm pretty new to this whole download a game and mount it to play it and whatnot, but I mount the ISO and try to run it but it says that it needs the install disc. Any help would be appreciated. I will continue to seed this for a while."
,vShadowAssassin563,2010-10-15T03:58Z,"To Rnwbcsmf:
HAve you already installed it and are tryingto play it or are you trying to install it??? usually when you mount the iso it will autoplay and allow you to install. Once installed All you do is coppy the No CD fix into C://Programs/EA Games/Battlefield 2. It will say the two files already exist click Replace existing files. Then you wont need the CD. If you still need any help You can Email me at Kennywhite23@yahoo.com And i can try and help you as best i can."
