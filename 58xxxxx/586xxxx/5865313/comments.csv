,Porkster,2010-10-05T13:55Z,"HD version but only 640x480.

Yeah sorry folks I only captured speeches onward. I would have liked all of it as I realised later how good the Indians had made the ceremony. I wonder how good the closing will be.

I hope Indians get behind the sports events and turn up.  The seats are empty for the qualifications.  The Indian gov should send schools for free take sides, later doing lessons on the player nations, etc. "
,dnerikar,2010-10-05T17:17Z,"Yeah Porkster we shock the world...
I think this ceremony is the best ceremony ever produced in any sports event.
Well....all school are off because of CWG 2010 from 1-17 oct..So it will be dificult to send school kids to join games.....anyway thanks for your review's and for replying"
,Porkster,2010-10-05T23:18Z,"dnerikar ok thanks.  I am also very impressed with the facilities and the event.

The previous post was a bit stuffed up in the sentence.  What I emant was that school children should eb asked to take sides and then review the teams they support in school projects, etc.  they should have thought of this before the games started.  It should have been the games for the children of India.  That would have been a major promotion as parents would then get involved."
,dnerikar,2010-10-06T17:03Z,"What you are saying is absolutely correct but traffic is a huge concern here that is why schools and government offices are closed for two weeks...and people of delhi are frustrated with those early overly exaggerated setback shown by greedy indian and international media, especially by indian  media always hungry for trp's...So people need time to digest those incidences and to support games.."
,apsandhu,2010-10-06T19:26Z,"audio=video=ceremony=10
this is the australian channel 10 coverage, commentators are Liz Ellis, Nicole Livingstone and Tim Lane and there r no ad breaks which our own DD channel unashamedly tortured us with.
runtime is 78 minutes starting with Indian PM's speech to the end of the ceremony......the contingents coming and earlier part is missing though......even the it's worth a watch.....
video 720x576 16:9 2200 kbps 25fps
audio 128 kbps 2 channels
Thanks PORKSTER a lot !!!!!"
,apsandhu,2010-10-13T07:40Z,Plz upload the closing ceremony too tomorrow......Thanks in advance....
