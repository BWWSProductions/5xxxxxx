,richiem2282,2010-10-13T00:59Z,"Milestone/Blackbean are the sadist bunch of gaming developers I've ever seen, Take a look at the credits screen at the start and you'll notice that Fanatec have a Trademark on the credits and their steering and pedals don't even work. Amateurs.... at best...."

thanks"
,mathias921,2010-11-22T16:01Z,"Great torrent; thank you AiTB!

However this game really sucks!
This is a don't buy game; therefor I say let us keep it that way!

The physics and environment is all unrealistic:
''Ugly copy of Dirt'' = Indeed

Sure they have made it 100% rally only; but since the graphics is so bad I really don't feel like buying this shit nor to go back to the 2001 in graphics quality!

''Dirt 2 on lowest settings looks visually better thanďťż this game on max setting.'' -Youtube"
,slax2011,2011-04-21T23:48Z,"Dont waste your time downloading this big pile of steaming shit of a game. This game isn't even the quality of rally games from 10 years ago. The developers of this game should stick with playing games and never ever make another game again because this game is a PIECE OF SHIT

Graphics = 4
Sound = 1
Gameplay = 4


PS Wait for DIRT 3 and go buy it when it comes out."
,slax2011,2011-04-21T23:54Z,"DONT WASTE YOUR TIME THIS GAME SUCKS SO BAD I PLAYED RALLY GAMES 10 YEARS AGO THAT HAD BETTER GRAPHICS AND SOUND AND GAMEPLAY THAN THIS. 


WAIT FOR DIRT 3 AND PAY FOR THAT GAME TO SUPPORT DEVELOPERS THAT MAKE GAMES THAT ARE WORTH YOUR HARD EARNED CASH.

THIS GAME ISN'T WORTH WASTING HARD DRIVE SPACE "

I say don't buy any Codemaster Games, they've fucked a great series of games with all their ''DiRT, Ken Block, Ford Fiesta, Monster Energy Drink, Baja and California/ Los Angeles propaganda.

If you Codemasters read this I hope your are happy now, fuck you'll at Codemasters for ruining and using Colin McRae's name for justifying such a bad game. Why don't you just call it X-Games 3 with Ken Block!?

To hell with Codemasters, Ken Cock and their sponsors.
Long live Colin McRae and the WRC,
I miss you so much.. my HERO! "
