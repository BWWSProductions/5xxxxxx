,abhithe05,2010-10-04T15:43Z,"OMFG globe ur so good n fast than other stupid fucking uploaders , downloaded ur pes 2011 clean and working and i'm downloading this now and i know this will also work like a charm thnxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ur the best ripper"
,9898562325,2010-10-04T16:45Z,"netrangi u r talking like a fucking shit
 i have DL ARC files b4 also but it does not open
dats y i asked dat is it fake"
[V],globeplus,2010-10-04T17:19Z,"To 9898562325 : to open the arc files you need to download the freeware FREEARC and use the extraction loke you with 7zio , for 7zio you still need to install the program and then you can make extractions or compressions , it is tha same concept with the FREEARC but this files to xtract correctly need close 1 gb ram to do the work properly , so the best eficace without getting problems woth the extraction of the files or the conversion work is to restart the computer and only be doing the designated operations , acting like this you the necessary work in execution goes normally without interference of any background applications that take necessary ram or causing circunstancial anomalies on the work , so restarting the computer and just executing the necessary works are the correct way to go , after that you are free to back to the normality in everything . I hope this comment help you using this type of files that work like 7zip but needing more ram to execute the normal extraction ."
,gamer_marcus,2010-10-04T20:56Z,I've followed all the steps up to step 4 but during the installation it says it cant find the file Data0.big in C:/...Desktop/FIFA 11/Game. i dont know what to do

,bob258258,2010-10-11T12:02Z,@sudeep_58 The whole game is basically revolving around the use of a Xbox controller but it allows a mouse and keyboard to be used. So yes you can use an Xbox controller but not one that you use for your Xbox. You will have to buy a Xbox controller for PC.
,sudeep_58,2010-10-11T13:16Z,"@bob258258
I mean to say does xbox controller for windows works without any issues?Have you tested by yourself?As i have ordered one xbox controller online to play this game and fifa 11."
