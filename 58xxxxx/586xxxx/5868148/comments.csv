,keyman91,2011-01-05T04:24Z,"Guys, the SKU for this game is BCES00797.
This is the European version of the game. All European region games are Multi5 (English, Spanish, Italian, German, Dutch). 
This torrent has English and will play perfectly fine on a HACKED PS3.

PS. Thanks for the game consolasatope :)"
,keyman91,2011-01-05T04:26Z,"By the way, all PS3 games will be made for 3 regions: US (NTSC-U), JAP (NTSC-J) and EUR (PAL). 
The PS3 is region free when it comes to gaming so they will all work. 
However, the only region to not have English is the JAP versions."
,crila,2011-01-10T20:43Z,"English instructions:

The game is working. Is in English, is the Move version. This is how i got it to work:
- Copy the BCES00797 folder to your default game folder to the internal drive (GAMEZ)
- Copy the 2 folders 00000001 and 00000002 from Parches 1.01 y 1.02 to your internal drive in the following location: /dev_hdd0/vsh/task/ (Overwrite the existing folder)  (It should look like this: /dev_hdd0/vsh/task/00000001)...
- Restart your PS3 without jailbreak
- Start the updates from the menu game (First 1.01 then 1.02)
- Restart your PS3 with jailbreak
- Overwrite the file eboot.bin in the folder: 
/dev_hdd0/game/...../GAMEZ/BCES00797/USRDIR/ with the one from the folder Parches 1.01 y 1.02  (The updates install a new eboot.bin which must be replaced)
- Insert any original PS3 game! 
- Play

I have used CuteFtp on PC, Hermes 4, PS3 FTP Server"

,one19,2011-04-13T03:22Z,I finished transferring the game with blackbox but when I went to run gaia manager I got a black screen with strange multicolor lines.Then I restarted and still.What could this be?
,one19,2011-04-13T03:26Z,Never mind I guess it needed to cool off since it had been on for more than 9hrs.
,s4sentosa,2011-09-25T07:59Z,"thnks m8, works with kmeaw 3.55 without using any patch provided by ya. but it's not move edition. i'v to look somewhere else :-("
,s4sentosa,2011-09-26T20:29Z,"Now i figured it out how to make this game a move version. all ya need is to download update and install it by using install package option in xmb. the update is around 1.11 GB. after installing the update i had the problem with calibration but i turned off my PS3 then turn it on, after this the problem was solved. download the move update from this link http://b0.ww.np.dl.playstation.net/tppkg/np/BCES00797/BCES00797_T3/165c46cf0603cd25/EP9000-BCES00797_00-PATCH00000000002-A0200-V0100-PE.pkg or you can use awesome update finder."
