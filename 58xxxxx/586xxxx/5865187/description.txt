
The landscape of Lake District was millions of years in the making, and itâ€™s not hard to see why people come from all over the world to experience over 800 square miles of rugged landscape, towering mountains and breathtaking views, all nestled in the North West of England. From Windermere to Derwentwater, Coniston to Ullswater, sixteen lakes give this district its name. This new series, presented by Rory McGrath, looks at life in one of Britainâ€™s favourite holiday destinations during a busy summer and the characters who inhabit it.

In this first episode we meet a woman running against time to have her new business open in time for the summer season, a local hotel manager aiming to swim across Englandâ€™s biggest lake, and witness an unusual proposal in a hot air balloon.

The characters weâ€™ll meet as the summer unfolds include the delightfully eccentric Patrick Gordon Duff Pennington who hosts lunches for foreign visitors at the ancestral family castle, Muncaster; Lakeland farmer, George Taylor, whoâ€™s won so many rosettes with his prize-winning eggs, heâ€™s made it into the Guinness book of records; The Barrister turned farmer, Thomas Ballentyne Dyke and his wife Lynne who have combined one of the lakes oldest traditions, farming, with one of itâ€™s newest, tourism and opened up the farm to the public; And the Lake Wardens whose job it is to patrol one of the most beautiful lakes in the land, Windermere.
