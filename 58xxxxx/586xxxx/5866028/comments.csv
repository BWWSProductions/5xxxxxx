,tarball8,2010-10-04T07:02Z,"What the fuck?  17 seeds. 1800 leechers, and my upload/download won't go about 0.1K/second for 15 minutes now."
,aParadox,2010-10-04T08:08Z,"Shut the fuck up tarball, learn how torrents work. This was just uploaded, wait an hour or two until more leechers finish the file and become seeds. "
,Radiolo,2010-10-04T09:46Z,Why can't i see number of seeds and leechers near to every new torrent on tpb? Always 0 and 0. You all guys have it like that?
,m9o,2010-10-04T10:55Z,for a couple of week i've been seeing: 0 seeders & 0 leechers.  i might ask the same as radiolo did.  is it like that for everyone else?
,VR,2010-10-04T14:52Z,"@radiolo & m90
it may have something to do with the court case, that started last week. the actual # of downloads could be being hidden so the prosecution can't say ""in the last week alone x amount of people have caused x movie to lose x amount of dollars."" 

This is just my guess."
,monspencer,2010-10-04T23:20Z,Thanks as always
