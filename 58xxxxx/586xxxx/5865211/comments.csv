,love4959,2011-04-25T22:33Z,"Install CS 1.6 first

Double-click the shortcut on the Desktop

Provide the CD-Key as follows:

5RP2E-EPH3K-BR3LG-KMGTE-FN8PY

Then Install CZero

After intallation completes,
Right-click on the CS 1.6 shortcut and click 'Properties'

In the target box, find the text '-game cstrike'
and change it to '-game czero'

Double-click the shortcut and ENJOY!!!"
,nylon61,2011-07-03T16:24Z,Genuine torrent......might need to change compatibility if it doesn't work on your system........just right click on the counter strike 1.6 shortcut.....go to properties......under the compatibility tab......select your OS and you should be good to go!!!

,Philonetic,2011-07-25T21:42Z,"Forget this complicated crap.  Easy 1.6 + maps here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6049862/Counter_Strike_1.6_Full_with_maps_and_cheats

and btw love, Drake's works just as well as yours, stop spamming."
,Yapad,2011-08-08T15:53Z,"Following the instructions was very simple, although I didn't get the results i was hoping for.
So i played around with it for al...ong while until i got it.
After following the first few steps;  was running fine but i wanted CZ..no shit yeh.
I apologize I'am rambling...After installing czero, Right click the Counter-Strike 1.6 shortcut>properties>open file location> then rename the 'hl' file to 'czero' it is an 80k file>double click and enjoy :)
The Target bar should say something like this
'C:\games\cs16\czero.exe -nointro -dev -nocdaudio -noipx -game cstrike -nomaster' 

First ever comment, thought id put up instructions on how to install this file, so even a noob such as i could understand.
Peace. "
