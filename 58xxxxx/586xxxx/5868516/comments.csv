Note:  To anyone with an onboard graphics processor instead of a high dollar graphics card... Use 3D Analyze and check all boxes that say to emulate something and save the batch file in the directory.  This game will play fine then.

I have seeded a 2.9 ratio and will probably continue.  No virus.  Simple crack. "
