he landscape of Lake District was millions of years in the making, and itâ€™s not hard to see why people come from all over the world to experience over 800 square miles of rugged landscape, towering mountains and breathtaking views, all nestled in the North West of England. From Windermere to Derwentwater, Coniston to Ullswater, sixteen lakes give this district its name. This new series, presented by Rory McGrath, looks at life in one of Britainâ€™s favourite holiday destinations during a busy summer and the characters who inhabit it.

In this episode we meet barrister turned farmer Thomas Ballentyne Dyke, go on duty with the wardens whose workplace is the beautiful setting of Windermere, and find out how Langdale Chase hotel manager Thomas Noblett gets on in his latest challenge to raise money for charity.

The picturesque Langdale Chase Hotel is located on the banks of Windermere overlooking the Langdale Pikes and run by charismatic managing director Thomas Noblett and his wife Clare. Heâ€™s taken on dozens of sporting challenges for charity and says: â€œOver the years weâ€™ve raised over Â£30,000.â€

His latest task is the most challenging yet, swimming the entire length of Windermere and back again; a distance of 21 miles. The Windermere Two Way Swim is organised by the British Long Distance Swimming Association and is one of the most extreme endurance challenges in England. Held at Windermere every other year, people come from all over Britain to compete. Former president of the Association Janet Wilson says: â€œThe slower swimmers could take 16, 17, 18 hours.â€
