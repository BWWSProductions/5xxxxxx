,sixthgearpinned,2011-08-17T06:10Z,"You people trying to download games for free really need to learn how to do it properly instead of bitching at the torrent uploaders of perfectly usable copies of what you're searching for. If you can't handle these instructions I'm giving you, just buy the game since you obviously have no idea what the hell you're doing.
_______________________________________
1 - Download Universal Extractor (Google it) and install to extract the ISO to a usable file format as to not waste DVDs burning copies of games that are unnecessary.

_______________________________________
2 - After the files are extracted from the ISO, Double click Setup.exe, and follow the prompts to install the game like any other.

Once installed, restart your PC (Setup calls for it)
_______________________________________
3 - Then download the latest update so your game isn't using old broken bullshit, and you have things up to date (Something most people don't know how to do)

Google (patch 1.01 wrc 2010) I used the patch from shacknews.
_____________________________________
4- Download the nocd/nodvd patch so you don't need to have the disk in to run the game. This is WAY easier than dealing with MDS/MDF files, Alcohol, Mounting images, etc (Useless Bullshit)

I used the NODVD patch from gamecopyworld*

**Make sure you download the V1.01 Multi5 Fixed EXE since the game was updated in the last step**
_______________________________________
5- Start the game! To the idiot saying only the keyboard works, he's full of shit, if you use a wired USB xbox360 controller, most any game you find will support it without a problem. I have over 60 games on my PC and not one has ever had a problem with a 360 controller. Perhaps SMP, you should try to configure things before assuming they don't work. 

THIS IS A FULLY FUNCTIONAL ISO IMAGE OF WRC 2010 ENGLISH. I HAVE NOT FOUND A SINGLE BUG OR ERROR WITH THE WAY IT OPERATES. LEARN YOUR SHIT PEOPLE BEFORE YOU COMPLAIN THE UPLOADER IS UPLOADING TRASH!"
