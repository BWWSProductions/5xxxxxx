Franco Battiato, born 23 March 1945 in Sicily, is an Italian singer-songwriter, composer, filmmaker and, under the pseudonym SÃ¼phan Barzani, also a painter.

Together with Alice, Franco Battiato represented Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest 1984 with the melody "I treni di Tozeur". Battiato's songs contain esoteric, philosophical and East Asian religious themes.

His collaborations from 1994 onward with the nihilistic-cynical philosopher Manlio Sgalambro have added lyrical references to Emil Cioran, Friedrich Nietzsche and other anarchistic thinkers.
