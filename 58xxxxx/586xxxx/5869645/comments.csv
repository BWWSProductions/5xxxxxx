,wilko1,2010-10-07T23:53Z,A/V looks and sounds great. Wrong subs here though. Anyone know if is any foreign speaking in this movie? Are the subs actually needed?
,hanoo173,2010-10-08T01:50Z,"@wilko1: no foreign language except a line that is not important...

and if u found out any subtitles that needed to be adjusted ( delay ) just in media player classic press F1 for -delay and F2 for +delay"
,wilko1,2010-10-08T23:01Z,Appreciate the helpful reply hanoo173! Many thanks!

,realawesomedude,2012-02-06T23:14Z,"finally a good movie in months 

this is really worth seeing , even if ur not a creepy movie fan its even kinda romantic , its really original , really good movie , the most funny part is is that i went too a video store too look at some videos (videostores give mostly more info about the movies then the internet itself its easier too browse ) and then i saw this movie , didn buy it of course im not stupid , 
it aint lord of the rings but for a low budget movie its a REAL GOOD MOVIE ,VERY NICE


THNX FOR THE UL  FXG TEAM"
,realawesomedude,2012-02-06T23:19Z,"btw 

a/9
v/9
m/8

imdb gives it a 6 but i think it deserves more 
and when a movie @ imdb is 6 its mostly good or highly promoted

its a little bit like black swan and alien mix 
"
,nitz92,2012-05-29T03:22Z,Amazing movie. The sex scenes were so hot.  (; I wish I was that lucky man..
,ixvortex,2012-07-05T05:52Z,"Nice copy for the size
