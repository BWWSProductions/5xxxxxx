,Zappa1966,2011-02-04T14:08Z,where are tracks 19 thru 27 on disc 3?
,Zappa1966,2011-02-04T16:05Z,and why do the tracks on disc 1 come from at least 3 different cd's? what a piece of crap....

But I wonder if anyone might be able to post any of Louis' PRE-Capitol sides, the straight-jazz records he made for Brunswick, Vocalion and Decca? I always liked them better than the later, slicker stuff, but haven't seen one in decades. This massive selection will sure hold me in the meantime, though. Thanks."
,LazarusL,2011-09-06T08:08Z,"Oh, and Zappa1966 ought to pick another name. I met Frank Zappa in 1967 at the Garrick, and offstage, he was neither rude nor an ingrate."
