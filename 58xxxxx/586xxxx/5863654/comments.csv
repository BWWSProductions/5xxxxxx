,asighkick,2010-10-03T01:10Z,"Thanks from New Zealand.  Is there anyone out there that can reseed Series One of X Factor Episodes

S01E06 Boot Camp (seems to have one seed - thanks)
S01E13 Performances
S01E14 Performances
S01E16 Final

Also, a brand new fresh upload of S01E13 Results?

If you are able to help, please seed for some time as we have very slow connections here in New Zealand.

Thank You"

Get you facts right, I always seed."
,AttWhitehartlane,2010-10-03T02:05Z,"ramrodthelarge

Maybe I'm wrong, but shouldn't it say 1 seed in Bit Torrent if you were seeding? 
Sorry if I'm wrong here.."
