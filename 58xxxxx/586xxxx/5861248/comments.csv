This is not the first time, and you are not alone doing it (hoping for more peers?).
AUDIO is ONLY JAPANESE! (DTS, 2 ch)."

This film japanese AND english, hence the speaking of japanese (and the english actors DO speak english). AND there are subtitles in english because this is the way the film is released."
,N-Asadi,2011-02-14T01:00Z,"the original blu-ray has only one audio track
there is no fully english dubbed audio for this film
