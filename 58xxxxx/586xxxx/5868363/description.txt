Inspired by the book "IN HIS STEPS" by charles sheldon..

What would happen if we walked in His steps?

It is 2005 in Raymond California, a thriving town that is a cross section of suburban America. Reverend HENRY MAXWELL, Raymondâ€™s local pastor, prepares to take his family on a fishing trip upstate. As they drive to the campgrounds, a tragic car accident takes place, killing Henryâ€™s pregnant wife and young son.

The story moves to present day where we find the town of Raymond has hit on hard times. The once prosperous town is now a shadow of itâ€™s former self. Enter ALEX YORK, an ambitious politician who wants to bring a casino to town to turn the fortunes of Raymond around. He will stop at nothing and has set his sites on the perfect place to build his casino, the grounds of Henry Maxwellâ€™s church. York approaches the wealthy real estate tycoons in town to finance his casino.

Things change when a DRIFTER comes to town. Impassioned by the Drifterâ€™s pleas for the poor and downtrodden, Henry and five influential parishioners set out to make a difference. Each has resolved to conduct his life according to the precepts of Christ, applying His behavior to their own lives. Will Henry and the others, simply by their own sacrifice and example, help change the minds of other townsfolk? Can they get everyone to band together andfight off the temptation of money and the easy path?
