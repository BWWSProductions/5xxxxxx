,VikingKing001,2010-10-12T21:07Z,Cab't wait to watch this movies....  Thanx's
,svidrigailovjones,2010-10-17T08:13Z,"I'm about 45 minutes into watching this.
It is watchable...the bottom 15+% is cropped out. The audio is synced. The dialogue in this movie is very important and it is audible enough. 
A fun movie so far. I would never pay to see this (I would have waited until my local library obtained it). I don't know how this compares to the other Wall Street 2's on TPB, but this one is OK. In fact, other than the missing bottom portion of the image, the video quality was suprisingly good (too me). Also no baloney passwords and such. Thank You .BONE. , I appreciate the upload, and I hope all you prospective downloaders appreciate my little review and are motivated to comment such as I have on yet to be released on DVD films as I have for the greater good of the filesharing community. 
P.S. Hold your nose and vote Democrat in 2010."
,svidrigailovjones,2010-10-17T09:30Z,"P.P.S. This election, may be more important than you think. It didn't go well for us when Republicans took control during the Clinton administration. Sure, we paid down the debt, but we encouraged corporate mergers, outsourced our jobs, deregulated Wall Street, and sowed the seeds of the current economic crisis which has been devastating not only for the U.S. but for much of the rest of the world as well. And let us not forget about the baloney subpeonas and the blowjob fiasco. Yikes!!! The U.S. has one party: The business party, which has two factions the Democrats and the Republicans, and it SUCKS!!!, but at least the Democrats are throwing a few crumbs to us. With the corporate media inspired rise of the ""Tea Party"", and FoxNews etc. the U.S. is following in the footsteps of facist Europe in the early twentieth century from a PR standpoint at least (who can doubt that there has been a ""soft power"" facist takeover of the U.S. already). Well anyway, it sucks, but you've no better choice at this time than to vote for the Democrats in 2010. "
,HimThatWierdGuy,2010-10-17T22:20Z,"Jeez, wake up man. America got hijacked in 1913 when the Federal Reserve got control over your currency. Since then your precious dollar has dropped 90% in value. Doesn't matter who you vote for. They work for the same interrest."
,svidrigailovjones,2010-10-20T02:46Z,"Wake up and don't vote because of the Federal Reserve? Did the Federal Reserve end jim crow in the south? Did the Federal Reserve give us Social Security and medicare? Did the Federal Reserve give us labor laws, environmental laws? Did the Federal Reserve send us to Vietnam? Iraq? Afghanistan? Did the Federal Reserve give us a minimum wage?"
,HimThatWierdGuy,2010-10-21T23:08Z,"The Federal Reserve feeds Wall Street with fiat money(digital numbers not based on any value).Everyone in the Obama and bush administration is/was from Wall Street. Obama is democrat, bush is republican. Both parties works for Wall Street. So to answer almost all your questions: YES!. 

It is Wall street crooks that runs the government whether you like it or not.

I don't say ""don't vote"".
I just say it really doesn't matter which party you vote in when they work for the same interrest.

,HimThatWierdGuy,2010-10-21T23:21Z,"If you want the bigger picture then search on youtube for: The Obama Deception 
or: Money Masters
or: Zeitgeist Addendum

All 3 documentaries explain it very well."
