,fakebest,2010-11-07T17:36Z,this is a 50 episode series and imdb confirms this from you link I will be back to confirm if subtitles work from the other commenter and if this is the series made into one video file which uses x264 to compress it to this small size
,fakebest,2010-11-07T21:17Z,I just skipped through this and it is english dubbed so subtitles are not needed but it is three hours long.  I am unsure what this is but I think it is a compilation of the series which is 50 episodes and each episode is 45 min of content. That would be 37.5 hours so if it is not a compilation then it is just the first 4 episodes.  I have not watched this all the way through but I will comment when I have time to do so.  there is another version of this by the same uploader and is encoded with xvid so smaller size yet less quality for those that like the smaller size and don't mind less quality.
,fakebest,2010-11-07T21:23Z,I just found this right after the comment I made http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/45691/legend-of-bruce-lee-the/ and it confirms that lionsgate made this 3 hour compilation edit from the 50 episode series.  I am disappointed by this I wish they would release the whole series dubbed in english or at least some one release english subtitles for all 50 episodes. 
,fakebest,2010-11-09T06:08Z,yeah I went through both version from this upload and this one is the worst.  it is not better quality compared to the smaller one and the aspect ratio is incorrect it should be 16:9 but it is altered to be cinema widescreen 21:9 so if you have it you would need to alter it plus there is two language tracks which are both chinese (mandarin) with no subtitles. I have vlc so don't inform me of this stuff.  the smaller one is of same quality except better overall because it has an english audio track (no subtitles) and it is the correct aspect ratio 16:9.
