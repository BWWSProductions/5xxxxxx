,Abbysto,2011-01-08T16:54Z,"Word of Warning:

Neither MP3 nor MP4 are supported by this.  You'll need to convert to WAV to work with audio or audio/video.

Not a huge problem, but a problem nonetheless."

,unique223,2011-05-28T05:43Z,"Works perfectly... Except for the fact that right-clicking any video clip throws up an error and shuts down the program.

Don't even bother."

,TheBlackRider,2011-10-09T01:44Z,"No offense to whoever spent the time making this portable version, but it almost ended my goddamn marriage. It is massively broken and doesn't output hardly any formats, crashes at the last frame of renders and goddam. don't use this "
