A solid pop album. This is probably the furthest Griffith ever strayed from her folk roots, and there is nothing even remotely folky or country about this album -- it's indeed easy to see why both her folk and her country audience felt alienated by this album. The songs are certainly not to blame, because they are as strong as ever, and introduce some welcome change and variety into her catalogue. 

Unfortunately, just as the heavy country arrangements of Lone Star State of Mind smothered her delicate song material, the pop tunings here make this sound like a great album that does, however, somewhat lack individuality. This, and the slightly thinner rate of songs with immediate impact, is perhaps the only problem about this album, which is otherwise another solid and enjoyable addition to her discography
