[V],globeplus,2010-10-05T20:39Z,"To vasilis23 : just really listen what i have to say to you : get the freeware FREEARC that is free and have a normal installation for compressions and extraction with arc files with the same concept as the very common 7zip , then after this little step the file will need close 1gb ram to extract and background applications can affect the normal extraction , so what we do then is to restart the computer and execute only the extraction or the conversion work if it is the case and when it is really finished this operations we are free to go to do anything after that but we want the extarction or the conversion correct , remember that a nice compression of a game file can save a few hours depending on the downloading speeds from the users getting the games on the torrents , as you see it is a needed work to facilitate more as possible to the possible users get the files . I hope now you get the all picture abou the extraction with arc files and be a more happy user of the files with that ."
