Performance improvements: Faster, smoother, better.
Office for Mac 2011 gives you an enhanced user experience overall, as performance and launch times have been improved in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Your documents feel â€œlighter,â€ since they load fast, and respond quickly to your commands. And searching text within documents has never been faster.

Reorder Objects: Move objects and data around, and through, your documents.
Word and PowerPoint give you the ability to create rich documents, by layering text, shapes, pictures, SmartArt, animations, and charts. With Office for Mac 2011, you can now easily reorder all these elements with a stunningly simple visual interface that make the management of your sophisticated designs not so complex.

Word Full-Screen View: Let your content be front and center.
Now you can tailor your use of Word depending on whether you want to write your document, or read it. Full-Screen View gives you a limited user-interface and blocks interruptions from email and instant messages, helping you to keep your focus on your content.
