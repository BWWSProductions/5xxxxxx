,anon197,2011-01-05T03:01Z,"Great torrent, thanks. I had a minor install problem (entirely my fault, torrent is good) which culminated in Microsoft Auto Update deleting every font on my system, but Pacifist did the job for reinstalling. No serial number is needed, just run the DMG and it installs its self."
