Hi Everyone,

DemonDan finally back to upload with my crappy internet connection.

Description:

This is a music video (Rather, Short Movie) for the song "Snuff" By Slipknot.
Vocalist/Singer, Corey Taylor and That Shrink From "Saw" (i think) starr in this clip.

Enjoy.


P.s. about the 720p HD thing, i'm not sure if it is actually 720p cause i downloaded it 720 but i converted it from .flv to .avi (H264)

sorry for that if it caused problems
