Dragon Stop Motion is the most advanced and complete software ever developed for Stop Motion animation.

Create stop frame animation, motion design and special effects using a digital still camera or HD/SD video camera. Dragon Stop Motion controls digital still and video cameras for shooting single frame animation and effects. It provides a comprehensive set of animation and cinematography tools to help you get the shot right. And it keeps your scenes, takes and frames well-organized for post production. Every Dragon Stop Motion purchase includes the new Dragon Controller, a USB keypad that controls the most important functions.


Dragon Stop Motion 2.2 adds 3D playback in the animation window. The new 3D Stereo Review area of the cinematography window provides fine-tuning your 3D imagery, with settings for convergence, edge float, and more. Keyframe editing for DMX lighting programs has been improved with multi-keyframe selection and dragging to adjust timing.
