Underwater Universe

UNDERWATER UNIVERSE tracks the history and evolution of the ocean's seven deadliest zones...locations that throughout history have been the direct cause of human devastation by floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, whirlpools, ice, underwater volcanoes, and shipping graveyards.

Leading oceanographers, expedition footage from partnering organizations like Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and 3-D animation depict the awesome cosmic and geological fluctuations that make the Oceans deadly over time.

Viewers see how history records our early ancestors interacting with these deadly forces, i.e., The Great Flood; cultures worshiping the ocean as a fickle God, and making sacrifices to satiate it. With advances in navigation, engineering, and meteorology, people today have learned to avoid some of these catastrophes. But our sophisticated technologies have also created new threats, and the possibility that our own actions are making the oceans deadlier.
