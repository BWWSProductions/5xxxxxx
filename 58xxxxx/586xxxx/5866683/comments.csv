,jon4fun,2010-10-05T09:29Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

I've been waiting for your BluRay encode of this movie.
I also see you released it in two formats (THANKS on behalf of all of us with small DL allowances).
I am going to use my allowance to take the bigger file asI think this movie is worth it!

I note there is a comment from another DL'er (Nigsy) that there is no video. I KNOW he is wrong BEFORE I DL as this file wouldn't be UP'ed by you if there was any problem with it.

Cheers
Jon

@ Nigsy - Please read the entire comment section that 20-40 puts up. It is very unlikely to be a HW problem with a newer computer anyway. Have you checked the CODEC? If you're running Windows 7 then Google the INTERNET for fixes as I am willing to bet that the problem is OS and not this encode."

,jon4fun,2010-10-05T11:11Z,"@ Nigsy - I've DL'ed and played the file on my playback (PS3 via HDMI to 32"" TV). Works and is excellent quality.

AND I've tested it on my PC using SMPlayer & VLC. I did this just so I could confirm that it is not H/W related as I don't have top range graphics card jsut a decent one. Works perfectly. Just an FYI, I run Vista.

Problem is at YOUR end! So read and don't go bitching until you have. If you still have problems then ASK NICELY & maybe 20-40 would help. 
Although, I would just tell you to fuck off.

Jon"
