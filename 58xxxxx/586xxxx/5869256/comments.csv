8/10 audio
Some R5 rips can have crappy video, this one does not.  The audio is a little fuzzy in some spots if you turn the volume up.  I can't really see a DVD rip being much better than this.  IMO the only thing better would be a 4gig BlueRay rip, but I guess we'll have to wait for the release date for that."
