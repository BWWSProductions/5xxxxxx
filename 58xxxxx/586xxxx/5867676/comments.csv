,apsandhu,2010-10-09T04:39Z,"thnx a lot uploader..........really appreciate the effort......otherwise our own local Indian channel spoiled the show by showing ad breaks and deferred live telecast....not to speak of pathetic commentary.....
audio=video=ceremony=10"
,hakuna_matata,2010-10-10T01:25Z,"
i agree with you completely.. Doodarshan coverage is pathetic. the BBC have so much better people and their editor producer know what they are doing. fantastic 

wish it was Espn or star covering the Games not the DD Sport"
