Release notes:

Kings of Leon will return with their highly anticipated fifth album, 'Come
Around Sundown', on October 15th, 2010. The new album was recorded in New York
at Avatar Studios and produced once again by Angelo Petraglia and Jacquire King.

'Come Around Sundown' is the follow-up to the hugely successful 'Only By The
Night', which sold over six million copies worldwide and garnered four Grammy
Awards and two Brits. It's yet another bold and expansive statement by the
Nashville, Tennessee-based quartet who, in the last two years, have become one
of the biggest bands in the world; also one of the most creatively restless.

As proven throughout their storied career, Kings of Leon love to work. Whether
writing, recording or touring, the band is constantly in motion. Once they
finished touring in support of 'Only By The Night' at the end of October of
2009, they went back in the studio to record in February 2010.

Enjoy!
