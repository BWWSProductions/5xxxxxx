Notes:
Recorded live at The Wiltern, Los Angeles, June 24, 2003. 

From wikipedia: ...recorded in Los Angeles at the Wiltern Theatre in 2003 after The Raven. The show features a drummer-less band (including Mike Rathke on guitar/synth, bassist Fernando Saunders, and the cello of Jane Scarpantoni). Reed delivers dramatic readings of some of his most compelling work. In addition, Antony Hegarty, of Antony and the Johnsons fame, contributes background vocals throughout and sings the lead on "Set The Twilight Reeling" and "Candy Says."

Fernando Saunders plays bass and other instruments. He did background vocals on most songs and sang lead vocals on "Tell It to Your Heart" & "Reviens Cherie", scat on "Sunday Morning".

Three songs were performed during the concert, but did not appear on the album: "Sweet Jane", "The Last Shot" and "Perfect Day" (sung in duet with Antony). "Sweet Jane" is available by digital download.

Animal Serenade was produced by Lou Reed and Fernando Saunders.

Review:

Lou Reed may have been a reluctant icon for the smart, art-fueled post-classic rock upheavals his efforts with the Velvet Underground  and early solo albums inspired, but he's gratifyingly become one of the genre's wisest and most beloved godfathers. This two-plus hour live double-disc collection captures the 62-year-old Reed onstage in Los Angeles in 2003 on the heels of his ambitious, if commercially disappointing tribute to Poe, The Raven. Yet despite that unpromising context, the performances captured here nonetheless represent another unlikely career high-water mark. Wending his way through a body of work that seems ever more resilient and uncompromising in an increasingly disposable, marketing-mad pop landscape, Reed manages to evoke both big-rock grandeur and a surprisingly playful cabaret intimacy, cutting his too easily clichÎ˜d nihilism with bracing doses of cautious, world-weary optimism. The focus may be on Reed the troubadour/poet, but his unusual, drummer-less band (including Mike Rathke on guitar/synth, bassist Fernando Saunders  and the bold, occasionally chilling cello of Joan Scarpantoni) imparts the performance with both a stunning range and dramatic edge, be they smartly rethought Velvets classics or stark, timely revisitations of "The Day John Kennedy Died" and "Men of Good Fortune." It's the rarest and best kind of live album: One that showcases a familiar artist in a compelling new light. -- Jerry McCulley
