Bio-Hazard Battle
SEGA Genesis Classics

During the first global biowar, a powerful retrovirus filled the
planet Avaron with new and deadly forms of life. Only a few survivors
remain in O.P. Odysseus, an orbiting platform circling Avaron.

Hundreds of years after the biowar, conditions on Avaron are still
hostile but livable. Your mission is to pilot a Bioship to Avaron, fly
over the areas that the probes have labeled least hostile, and check
out the conditions there.
