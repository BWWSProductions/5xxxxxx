,kody27,2010-11-15T04:27Z,"The only reason anyone would ever download this would be to get the live houston track maybe. everything else is just regularly released tool shit and tracks from other bands.

MORE IMPORTANTLY - the ""RARE"" and ""UNRELEASED"" folders are full of BULL SHIT that is actually recordings done by this piece of shit whiny kid and an acoustic guitar. BTW when you describe a live track as Acoustic, you're a fucking idiot. Acoustic means unplugged, as in acoustic instruments. Go fuck yourself you piece of shit for actually uploaded chevelle tracks as tool songs, and your own pathetic attempt to sound like the guy from staind but worse. you suck."
,Rch3typ3,2010-11-15T13:10Z,You are an idiot Kody27
,xxxwarwolfxxx,2010-11-30T13:44Z,"thx very much . lost all my albums by an accident . and its good to have em back :) .
and by the way : KODY27 - you are an idiot . 
you dont know this music from this band not really or you cant think about lyrics and advanced music . you stuck in your lifetime because you know nothing . and i think for you with an IQ of 20 it should be really hard to think . SO GET BACK AND LISTEN TO YOUR COMMERZ SHIT kody27 !!!!!!!!!!!"
,hissil,2011-01-26T02:01Z,Are you fucking mentally retarted kody? Oh yes you are get a life cocksucking troll faggot. Tool is a great band and you fail at life for dissing them you sad piece of shit. Tool haters like you suck too much dick and hating on RATM with Tool live is just proving you have no life and have to talk shit here about one of the most complete discogs for the band. Why don't you go listen to some barbie girl music since you obviously hate music (especially acoustic) and have no purpose in life other than to troll and talk shit about bands and people who are way more succesful than your failed gay ass.
,hissil,2011-01-26T02:01Z,I see your just a cloned troll account. Epic fail Kody you faggot.
,hissil,2011-01-26T02:12Z,"They rarely play the song H live, and it's one of their best songs. Kody just dissed that song, and for that he is a dumb cunt."
,albus0420,2011-02-18T20:54Z,Maynard James Keenan fucking rock kody suck a cock you lame ass bitch and tool fans have you seen Maynard's new movie Blood into Wine check it out
,1loveu3,2011-05-02T09:41Z,"GEEEZUS!!! 
Take a chill pill, he doesnt like tool, doesnt mean hes all those things you called him... and because you dislike tool doesnt mean ""you have no life and have to talk shit here"" or ""isten to some barbie girl music since you obviously hate music (especially acoustic) and have no purpose in life other than to troll and talk shit about bands and people who are way more succesful than your failed gay ass."" so calm your ballz! i laugh at you
BTW-if this is real, thanks a lot ill seed for a long time!"
,hissil,2011-05-10T00:30Z,Kody is just an arrogant dumbass who hates good music. That's all.
,hissil,2011-05-24T13:10Z,The song reflection skips at about 6 and 1/2 minutes in. You can find a better version of this song from another torrent.
,hissil,2011-06-17T07:54Z,"Hey everyone, if you want the majority of this torrent in FLAC (far superior sound quality), check out this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6475280"
,TheBleed,2011-06-29T15:32Z,Unfortunately not many devices play FLAC. If any at all.
