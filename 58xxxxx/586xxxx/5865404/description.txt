This is Recorded Books' unabridged version of Bram Stoker's Dracula. The book was originally published in 1897. For easier playback, Recorded Books divided the book into 359 separate files, each about 3 minutes long.

Since the other Dracula on Pirate Bay has no complete seeders left, I got the audio book from the library and ripped it myself (using Windows Media Player). I ripped it in mp3 format at 128 kbps. I also scanned the back cover of the CD box (the front was covered with library stickers) and added that to the file. I also added the .pdf eBook of Dracula that came with the before mentioned other Dracula torrent.

I had never read or listened to the actual story before, but found it was quite enjoyable. I hope you will like it.
