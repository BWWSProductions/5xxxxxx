The Crisis of Consumerism

Are we too materialistic? Are we willfully trashing the planet in our pursuit of things? And what\\\\\\\'s the source of all this frenetic consumer energy and desire anyway? In a fast-paced tour of the ecological and psychological terrain of American consumer culture, Shop \\\\\\\'Til You Drop challenges us to confront these questions head-on. Taking aim at the high-stress, high-octane pace of fast-lane materialism, the film moves beneath the seductive surfaces of the commercial world to show how the flip side of accumulation is depletion -- the slow, steady erosion of both natural resources and basic human values. In the end, Shop \\\\\\\'Til You Drop helps us make sense of the economic turbulence of the moment, providing an unflinching, riveting look at the relationship between the limits of consumerism and our never-ending pursuit of happiness.

Filmmaker\\\\\\\'s Bio
GENE BROCKHOFF | Producer & Editor
Gene Brockhoff has no history in film. He has been and still is a flooring contractor who made this film in his spare time. \\\\\\\"Nobody else was doing films about consumerism, so I thought I\\\\\\\'d fill the void,\\\\\\\" he says. \\\\\\\"It was also a way for me to confront my own desires for materialism.\\\\\\\" In the making of the film he became very proficient with Apple\\\\\\\'s editing software Final Cut Pro and did some of the cinematography as well. \\\\\\\"I discovered a love of editing and the trillions of possibilities. I\\\\\\\'m a possibility junkie!\\\\\\\" He is still available in the SF Bay Area for installing and refinishing hardwood flooring in a sustainable and non-toxic way.

Praise for the Film
\\\\\\\"[Shop \\\\\\\'Til You Drop] takes viewers from the Industrial Revolution to the present, concentrating on the 1950s through the 1970s, when women moved into the workforce, celebrity culture saturated the media, and suburban dwellers worked harder than ever to keep up with the Joneses. Now, of course, they work even longer hours and rack up more debt, leading to a host of social problems. Recommended.\\\\\\\"
