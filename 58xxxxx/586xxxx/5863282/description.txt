Pied Piper is the twentieth studio album, and twenty-fifth album overall, from Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. It marks the third album of Donovan's children's music, after the For Little Ones portion of A Gift from a Flower to a Garden and H.M.S. Donovan. Pied Piper was released in both the UK and the US on March 19, 2002. The album name and title track both come from the 1972 Jacques Demy film "The Pied Piper" which starred Donovan as the Pied Piper.
