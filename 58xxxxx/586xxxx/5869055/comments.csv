,Boolavogue,2010-10-06T23:46Z,"I posted this torrent as a protest against Amazon's extortionate pricing on ebooks.

The book was published yesterday and I really wanted to read it. I went to Amazon and found that the hardcover was $14.48 and the Kindle ebook version was $12.99. That's only an 11% discount! A complete rip-off. 

I paid the $12.99 but only on the basis of vowing to pirate it. 

It's great to see that my $12.99 investment has, at the time of posting this message(about five hours later), served free copies to at least 60 downloaders. I hope that figure reaches the hundreds in the coming days. 

Suck it Amazon!

And if it makes you feel better. Think of the contribution you are making to humanity and the planet, the more people download this gift of yours the less trees will be cut to make books. A million thanks Boolavogue."

Not to complain or anything, but converting seems to mess with the format. 

I'm still very happy to have the book. Thank you again. :)"
,greg707,2011-11-17T13:05Z,Many thanks for taking the trouble to do this.  I have retired and could not justify the Amazon price so would otherwise not have read the book.
