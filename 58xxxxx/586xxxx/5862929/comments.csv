,creeve4,2010-11-01T04:13Z,"Audio and Video are out of sync. Come on FXG, it's not that hard to make a good rip!!!"

It's a decent fantasy action movie but the plot is nearly non-existent, it's dull to say the least. Thanks for the rip though, glad I didn't waste money on this.

+-Fight Till You Drop-+"
,SnoBaer,2010-11-20T10:25Z,Audio was a little off but it was easily fixed with a minor tweak. As for the movie... this has got to be one of the biggest slaps in the face to Asian cultures. Terrible movie.

,mvpmark0726,2010-11-24T01:28Z,"any help/ suggestion please??

i played this movie directly to a sony dvd player using USB but it will just play the first 5 seconds of the movie, same with GROWN UPS - FXG movie, I downloaded VAMPIRES SUCK-FXG and IRON MAN-FXG, and it plays smooth and fine..

,Pedrooko,2010-12-02T19:40Z,"I don't know why most people are saying that this is a bad movie. It is not! I have watched the ""Avatar"" series and have been a big fan of it. This movie is great if you watched the cartoon, since you need some sense of the story. The special effects are really great, the actors as well.

The audio is great and in sync.
Overall: 10!"

,pervertednest,2010-12-15T06:00Z,"Very Tommy Wiseau. I didn't know it was written and directed by an indian. No wonder there are too many indians in this movie. Moreover, the acting, the fight choreography, and dialogues are cheesy."

,Aserisz,2010-12-27T19:32Z,"Good god you people are driving me freaking insane!!!!

Just tell us how you rated the File itself, not the content. Obviously, someone wanted to watch the movie so it's rather rude to run off with your meaningless banter about ""this movie sucks"" or ""there's too much indians"". Give it a rest. If you didn't like the movie then don't come download it and dont waste our time complaining about how you have zero clue what it's about.

It's simple. One, It's technically a childrens show. Two, they took an animated series and made a movie out of it- the concept of which can never end with the movie being as great as the show. Doesn't make it suck though. I hadn't even seen the series till after i watched the movie and i understood what was going on. So piss off, stfu, and leave your opinions to yourself.

V: 9
A: 9"
,heywoodjj,2011-01-05T11:42Z,"FXG - Another great Rip.

I loved the series, and actually didn't mind the movie. Just wish they had cast better actors. Damn shame Mako (Uncle Iroh) passed away before he could be used for this!

Watched on a 50"" Plasma, and cant complaing about quality at all.

You're not paying for it, so just download it, watch it, and enjoy!!"

,ameezeez,2011-10-02T21:48Z,"@cheezypoof101, you really need to read the comments before you post any of your own. period. Everyone's pretty much informed you to get PeerBlock."
,Neonridr,2012-01-03T02:25Z,the letters you receive from your ISP's are just protocol.  The studio sends it to the ISP and the ISP sends it to you.  I have received several in my lifetime but Paramount is not going to bother going after one person.. they have more important things to do than to try to prosecute one individual.. don't be scared by these morons.
