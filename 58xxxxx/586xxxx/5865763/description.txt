"Loan-A-Lisa"

When Grampa gives each member of the family 
a portion of his savings, Lisa and Marge 
spend their money in drastically different 
ways. Lisa invests in Nelson's brand-new 
business venture, but soon realizes that her 
friend's instant success might lure him away 
from the classroom. Worried that his 
judgment might be clouded, Lisa introduces 
Nelson to the well-educated and successful 
creator of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg (guest-
voicing as himself), only to find out that 
he too dropped out of school. But when the 
soaring business suddenly takes a sharp 
turn, Lisa teaches her friend that education 
is invaluable.

Enjoy :)
