,orchlon,2010-10-06T17:46Z,i never liked final fantasy. i heard they were great but the gameplay videos i see on youtube looks like it sucks
,DiMarko,2010-10-09T19:22Z,"So, do all of these work? And do all of the emulators work properly?"
,LightofHope,2010-10-25T02:49Z,"Hi, I downloaded FF7 and I have been playing it for a little while now. When I get to the part where I come out of the Desert Prison and im about to do the chocobo race for my freedom, the game crashes, any ideas? its when im in the jockey room and ester comes in to say that everything is ready to go, when I go to walk out thats twhen it errors."
,Skeingald,2010-10-25T13:13Z,.BONE. for the love of PONY please Seed more
,Skeingald,2010-10-25T13:15Z,"Going to Seed this for at least my whole sleep cycle once its done, so that no one else has to torrent this for 36 hours."
,Skeingald,2010-10-26T03:29Z,How do i get the sound to work on the DS roms?
,DiMarko,2010-10-29T14:06Z,"Downloading, not sure if it's just because it's not finished, or if it's not there at all, but I'm not seeing any DS emulator runner."
,DiMarko,2010-10-29T14:07Z,"Yeah missed this too, nor am I seeing any PS2 Emulator programs. Like I said before, not sure if this is just because it's not done, or my computer isn't finding them."
,DiMarko,2010-10-30T08:54Z,"Well I'm downloading it, and there seems to be no seeders. Like, seven of them stopped seeding today."
,marcus1story,2010-11-21T10:00Z,"I can't seem to play FF7 everytime I click new game the screen goes black and stays there. It doesn't start up a new game, help anyone?"
,kthulu10,2010-12-01T05:03Z,SEEEEEDDDD PLZZZ!!!!!!
,nicklouslingor,2011-03-13T02:07Z,"@orchlon sicne when has a youtube video mean anythign about a game? thats like saying ""oh the reviews for a movie sucked so the movie HAS to suck. form your own conclusions and play the games man"
,xx3000,2011-05-02T19:25Z,btw: Final Fantasy X in this torrent is NOT the International Version--->(http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X#Final_Fantasy_X:_International)...justFYI
,EmoEmoEmo,2011-09-26T19:32Z,Is it really that hard to seed the torrent after you've completed downloading it? Seriously stop being assholes and seed please. Anyway Thanks BONE~ +1
,lubu0369,2012-03-03T11:36Z,"Though I will not play them at all.. I am a fan of some of the Final Fantasy titles. I will download and seed.

.. At least, that was the plan... first time I ever had to use a magnet file... not entirely sure how they work tbh. If it works the same, you have another seed in the making.. if not... then I downloaded it for nothing ^_^;;

Anyway, I have tried PS2 emulation in the past and http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/ps2/pcsx2.html was the best I could find. If you need the BIOS files, a good ol' google search should do the trick. 

Hope it helps,
Lu~"
