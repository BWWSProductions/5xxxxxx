review:


El-Pâ€™s Weareallgoingtoburninhellmegamixxx3 is said to have been inspired, in manner if not in sound, by J Dillaâ€™s beloved Donuts. This makes sense â€” both are essentially instrumental and neither sweats the structure enough to be called a proper album. But thatâ€™s about where the affinity ends. El-Pâ€™s aesthetic is almost the opposite of Dillaâ€™s freewheeling sonic-scavenger approach to production: he goes for depth, not breadth, refining a static consciousness instead of letting it stream. The consciousness is the same one heâ€™s been developing since Company Flow, a thump-and-skitter cityscape of new-age paranoia, a Blade Runner-inflected jumble of signifiers that have gotten rusty but are no less ominous for it.

Weareallgoingtoburninhell gets that consciousness across as cleanly and purely as youâ€™re likely to ever hear from El, foremost because nobodyâ€™s rhyming. On one hand, thatâ€™s refreshing; verbal clarity has never been his intent or forte, and his dark wit comes across amply in his choice of sounds, his rhythmic gestures, his song titles. On the other hand, itâ€™s harder to latch on and stay focused; unlike Dillaâ€™s donuts, these tracks never veer off suddenly or hit unexpected sweet spots. There are a few standalone bangers, particularly â€œTime Wonâ€™t Tellâ€ and â€œHe Hit Her So She Left,â€ and a few confounding tracks â€” â€œContagious Snippetâ€ is a funk odyssey led by Wilder Zoby, of Def Jux lounge lizards Chin Chin; â€œEat My Garbage 2â€ is a mini-mix of the entire megamixxx with all but the drums removed â€” but little thatâ€™ll jolt you to attention. The one communicative sample on the mix, a Twilight Zone clip at the beginning of â€œHow To Serve Man (Stripped)â€ isnâ€™t chilling, exactly, but it does give the steely menace of the track an explicit context, which is good for at least a few minutes of engagement.

In the absence of more such framing devices, some of these tracks run together or run aground â€” which would be disappointing if the mix had pretentions of breaking new ground, or simply of being an album. But Weareallgoingtoburninhellâ€˜s appeal is simply that it showcases El-P less as a producer who makes constantly compelling instrumental songs than as one working tirelessly to describe a mood, one who can take the futuristic sci-fi horror flick in his head and put in your head, too. The mixâ€™s most pleasing moments and its most successful donâ€™t usually overlap: some of the beats are fresh, some of the basslines impeccable, but itâ€™s the extramusical sensations, those slithering intimations of robotic insects rooting through the garbage for your financial information, that make this worth engaging with on his terms, not your own.
