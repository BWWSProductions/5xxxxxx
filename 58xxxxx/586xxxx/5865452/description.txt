"A-10 Warthog - Details" consists of 2 books:
Squadron Signal - Aircraft Mini In Action 1604 A-10 Warthog
Squadron Signal - Walk Around 5517 - A-10 Warthog


These are not part of the "Aircraft in action" collection, as "Mini in action" newer release of aircraft in action and it's harder to get books from it.


As pffut said he's working on it, I find few books with details and color schemes for A-10.


P.S.
If any of you need some book about modeling found or about some plane in details or color scheme, you can find me at http://forum.suprbay.org/. DON'T ASK FOR THINGS TO BE FIND VIA TPB (your comment will be deleted), join suprbay instead and PM me there.
