Release Notes

Perhaps you've seen all the new offerings for classic Sega games on
Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 and wondered why PC was left out - well
wonder no more, the PC is going to seeing some classic games today

Decap Attack
SEGA Genesis Classics

To help pull things together, the brilliant doctor Frank N. Stein
carefully fashioned Chuck D. Head from the leftover parts of some
other people that we dont talk about.

Somehow he couldnt quite get the head right  how many heads do
people need again? Head bone connects to the... what bone? Well, to
cut a long story short, theres this island which is made up of body
parts (like they are sometimes), and the fearsome villain Max D. Cap
has separated all the parts to gain total control. Its now up to
Chuck D. Head to go over there, and sort it all out.
