,tdmk1,2010-10-03T12:42Z,Ignore the seeders/leechers ratio on TPB at the moment - it's not updating correctly for some reason. I always seed until there is a good number of people seeding beyond me - otherwise there'd be no point uploading in the first place... :) 
,MikeR56,2010-10-03T14:23Z,I don't pay any attention to seeder/leech ratio either. Just download it and you'll see real time stats. Thanks TDMK1 for upping this. Big Motogp and F1 fan here.

there is a problem with this and some other races that you have uploade. there are a few seconds missing from time to time, (ex: at 0:55 in this one), which makes it weird when the action gets hot and you miss some of the overtakings. i've tried openning it with diffrent programs, but it's still the same.
just to let you know.
thanks for the quick ups again"
