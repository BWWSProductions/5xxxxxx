,dethpirate666,2010-11-02T02:00Z,"Hello, as soon as I finish downloading and installing this torrent I'll let everyone know how it is. "
,Damu714,2010-11-03T23:24Z,"Worked 100%. Great Torrent, Thank You Stun. I Will Continue Seeding This."
,Masterjohnny,2010-11-04T19:40Z,I guess dethpirate666 never installed it...
,Masterjohnny,2010-11-04T19:41Z,I guess dethpirate666 never got to install it.
,Bjellesau,2010-11-06T14:14Z,I guess dethpirate666 forgot to install it. He was possible too busy doing nothing. And that's a hard work.
,eojamybahb,2010-11-21T13:01Z,i am waiting for dethpirate666 to install it. but i guess it wont and we're just waiting him for nothing... ohhh well.... i guess we have to try this
,Swemd,2010-11-21T21:41Z,"It's not working for me. When it starts installing it gets to Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 x86, and then it just aborts :\. I tried uninstalling previous versions of Visual C++, but it didnt work.

Anyone having the same problem?"
,globalpuffer,2010-12-02T06:31Z,Installed on Win 7 64 bit... Works perfectly!  Easy to install.. Just follow the instructions carefully.. They are extremely simple.  I have used Maya cracks for years and this is by far the easiest I have ever seen.  This installs the fully loaded Maya Unlimited.. (I also installed Stun's other 32 Bit version on another machine and that one worked perfect too)Thank you!!!!
,globalpuffer,2010-12-02T06:46Z,"By the way!   When you are entering the activation code, don't worry about it being 8 digits less than Maya is requesting.. They are not necessary!"

,aldred09,2011-01-10T22:05Z,cant find serial and product key. where is it?
,aldred09,2011-01-12T09:39Z,never mind i got it. great download thanks!!
,aldred09,2011-01-12T10:10Z,"sorry for so many comments buuuuut, keygen cant extract. why?"
,furbieno,2011-01-21T16:11Z,where is the serial code and product code???
,daslayer55,2011-01-25T03:23Z,"I don't know where I went wrong.  I downloaded it, extracted it and got an ISO, and mounted it with Virtual CloneDrive (basically the same thing as Daemon.)  When I mount the file, it just runs me through the setup, no cracks or keygens or anything.  I just went with the 30-day trial installation, with hopes that I can probably activate the code later.  Am I doing this right?"
,daslayer55,2011-01-25T04:43Z,"NVM my previous comment.  I forgot to look in my mounted drive, which had all the installation files and stuff.  Instructions were really easy to follow and there were no problems.

YOU'RE A LIVESAVER!!"
,taiju,2011-01-25T10:59Z,"The key gen gives me an error saying it could not get debug priviledges, so no ""patch succesful"" and the code I guess isn't working because of this. "
,taiju,2011-01-25T14:19Z,Sorry forgot to disable UAC...works great! :)
,furbieno,2011-01-28T14:04Z,"guys still i dont get how do u get this activated? I only have a ISO wich I installed in Deamon tools, but when I start the program i want to activate but I have no key and serial code (they ask 2 codes) where can i find this????? plss someone tell me, im in a rush :o"

,reezy52,2011-02-19T03:14Z,hey guys does anyone know what file i have to unpack
,reezy52,2011-02-19T05:20Z,ok guys i got this torrent to work for me... its installing... all i did was unpack the rar file using win rar 64 bit and the iso file i converted it with d-tool... then run the setup and then i found the keys by unpacking r0 file with win rar 64 bit and then converting with d-tool..

,synchro1,2011-03-26T20:40Z,"Hey Stun, Thanks for the torrent!!! I am able to install it, however when I am applying the patch ""Mem Patch"", it shows ""Could not get debug privilege! Are you admin?"". I am using admin account of Win 7 -64. Also changed the installation folder from default to D drive.  I am not as savvy as you guys. Please help"
,KNowak27,2011-03-26T23:12Z,"Same problem as Synchro1, downloaded torrent, installed Maya no problems, but when I open up the XFORCe KeyGen and hit 'Mem Patch' I keep getting a window that says, ""Could not get debug privilege! Are you admin?"". I am using Windows 7 - 64 Bit and am logged in the administrator account as well. Any advice on how to fix this would be really appreciated!!"
,KNowak27,2011-03-26T23:53Z,"@Synchro1 - Right click on the ""xf-a2011-64bits"" (the keygen) and select ""Run as administrator"", should work fine after that!"
,steenis,2011-03-29T15:44Z,Does anyone know where to DL the song from the KeyGen?

,rk5711,2012-02-29T16:51Z,"This works just fine. Follow the instructions in the ISO. If you cant, then maybe rethinking your future in 3D is in order. "
