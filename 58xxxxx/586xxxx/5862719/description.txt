A Thousand Suns is a concept album dealing with nuclear warfare and themes of war in general. "On this record, the concepts blend human ideas with technology [...] Human fears, your fear of what's going to happen in the world, the music kind of references that." (Mike Shinoda) The album's title comes from the Hindu Sanskrit text Bhagavad Gita: "If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one," a quote made famous by J. Robert Oppenheimer in reference to the atomic bomb.
