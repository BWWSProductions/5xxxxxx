 EVERY MAN HAS HIS LIMIT. 

 No matter how tough,there is a pain threshold beyond which no man can pass
 the point where determination gives way to submission. In the Octagon
 a submission specialist sees an opening and seizes it. He sets a trap
 and then springs it. He imposes his will and breaks his opponent's. 
 If his opponent's will does not break, his bones will. This action-packed 
 collection brings you all the best submissions from superstars 
 Georges St-Pierre, Anderson Silva, BJ Penn, Frank Mir and others
 who found victory by pushing the ultimate limits of pain.

 Extras include Bonus Fights, Bonus from the Vault, and Just Won't Tap. 

 Sometimes the AR goes from 16:9 to 4:3 and back.

 50 Sick Submissions Enjoy! :-)
