An old, but very good version of Traviata starring the beautiful Anna Moffo as Violetta, Franco Bonisolli as Alfredo and Gino Bechi as Germont.


"Anna Moffo was an endearing Violetta, and her identification with the role is lovingly captured by director Mario Lanfranchi, who was her husband, with charming close-ups and detailed attention to her body language. Giuseppe Patane was one of the best Italian opera conductors of his generation, and he treats Verdi's masterpiece with stylistic sensitivity allied to technical expertise. Franco Bonisolli is visually and vocally just right for the role of the impetuous Alfredo and Gino Bechi gives a properly stern portrayal of his insecure, bourgeois father." --Joe McLellan

Being very old don't expect crystal clear quality.
I OCRed the DVD subs to srt, but the original idx/sub are also included, if needed. Unfortunately only English subs were included in this DVD release.

Enjoy!
