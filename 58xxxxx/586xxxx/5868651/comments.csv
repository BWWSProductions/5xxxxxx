"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-06T07:49Z,"@neeru: Thanks, but I reverted back - this is encoding type BEFORE I busted my ass to achieve wide compatibility. Instead of mp4 I was doing mkv - three-four-five years back.

Most of the haters of 272p - 360p mp4 do not know anything (or little) about restrains of portable platforms, where all advanced futures of H264 must be switched off to have compatibility.
This encoding type cannot be played at all on some platforms, including slower computers and limited mp4 players.
Frankly, I was tired of crap thrown at me ""Why mkv looks better""?

Here is the answer.
It doesn't. It is the same shit. Just video and audio are muxed (mixed, ""glued"") differently - but both a. & v. are absolutely same - but such files can be played on handful of devices only. Because MKV or MP4 (in case of x264 and AAC) is more matter of individual preferences - and crazy desire to be played on computers only. "
