Photomatix Pro automatically combines differently exposed images
of a high contrast scene. Photomatix Pro extends the dynamic range
using two images of the same scene -- one exposed for the
highlights and one exposed for the shadows and combines them into
one image with details in both the dark and bright areas of the
scene. Photomatix Pro lets you generate a High Dynamic Range Image
(HDRI) from any number of differently exposed images. Once your
HDRI is created, you can view it through an accessory window that
shows local data at the appropriate exposure. Additionally, it
lets you automate image combination through an easy-to-use batch
processing

What's new in this version
Version 4.0 has the ability to tone map a single image in 8 bits
and channel mode, unified dialog for HDR Tone Mapping and Exposure
Fusion methods, and improved rendering of Tone Compressor tone
mapping method with default settings and extension of the range of
the Tonal Range Compression setting.
