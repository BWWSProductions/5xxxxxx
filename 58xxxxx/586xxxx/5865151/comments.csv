,stickybeak,2010-11-20T11:15Z,License key is not included in the package.
,r-u-nutz,2010-11-20T17:58Z,"Works fine. Thx! 

But why the run-around with the zips/rars, etc.???"
,Heintron,2010-11-21T15:53Z,Be sure to dl the updated 4.0.2 version from the original site and install it because this version fucks up your exif information if you use raw files. Just a heads up.
