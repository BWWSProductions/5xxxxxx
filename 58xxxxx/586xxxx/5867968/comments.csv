,shuffler,2010-12-17T19:58Z,"You're all kiddie idiots who grab this sort of stuff... there's no such thing as a ""faster torrent"" without taking the share by unfairly leeching -  which I'm guessing this does.

Torrents are slow for a few reasons:
- not enough seeders
- ISP traffic shaping

but given you get this shit for free -  does a few extra hours wait really mean that much?"
