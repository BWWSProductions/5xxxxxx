,knightkuyu,2010-10-01T20:59Z,"Dude thanks for this! Is it possible for you to upload Under the Tuscan Sun 720p? Every other copy i'm getting is an uninspired rip. Either way, thanks. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-01T21:13Z,"@knightkuyu: Sorry, I cannot. I do small-sized rips, mainly 272p up to 480p, very few 720p-1080p.

My encoding, in all formats are extremely low-bitrate, supporting widest area of playback platforms possible, and by your question, you need more than that."
,knightkuyu,2010-10-01T22:15Z,S'alright. I understand. Thanks though.
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-02T10:46Z,"@knightkuyu: Even better, Under the Tuscan Sun never was released in BluRay or HDDVD formats. Only as plain DVD. It makes attempt to make or to  find 720p version impossible, even technically. Due to the format frame-size of DVD alone (480p for NTSC or 576p for PAL) obviously - 480p is highest format possible."
