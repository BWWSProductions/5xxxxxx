Drugs, Inc. (TV series 2010) Heroin (TV episode 2010 #1.3)

"Drugs, Inc" presents a very neutral view on a very controversial subject - drugs. In four parts, they review Cocaine, Meth, Heroin, and Marijuana. They show all aspects of these subjects - Heroin, for example, shows everyone involved in the trade from the poppy growers in Afghanistan, the ways smugglers are detected, the dealers who sell it on the streets, and of course, the addicts themselves.

This series of documentaries is very emotionally compelling, and even as a teenager, they discouraged me from ever thinking about touching so-called "hard drugs". What they put in these shows are the straight facts, and the ways they affect people. Without being an anti-drug crusade, "Drugs, Inc" shows a powerful, clear view on the substances they review. I highly recommend this.

The last one will come once this one is seeded in its entirety.

PS: The review is not mine.
