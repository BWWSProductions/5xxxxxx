,dmogx,2010-10-28T21:58Z,"I keep on getting this message with this activator:

EZ-Activator Failed!
Here is a more detailed description about the error:
Failed to start KMSEmulator.exe

any help?"
,bonemalone,2010-11-01T01:56Z,Get a trojan alert. Not gonna risk it. One more day left and my office goes bananas. sigh
[T],pkaji123,2010-11-01T03:11Z,"Trojan Alert is a False Positive,Its flagged as trojan because the Keygen.exe in the activator setups an Fake KMS sever to get Office activated..
In all Office 2010 activators the Keygen.exe is the main part, to get Office activated.
So this is not at all a Trojan or other.

I have uploaded a Final or stable version of the app,so get it first."
