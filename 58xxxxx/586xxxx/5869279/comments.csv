,imrayya12,2010-10-08T13:12Z,Dunno why but my mouse flickers in ther game
,hopelessfellow,2010-10-08T15:47Z,"erm hi i am one of those who leeches from you and here's what i have got to say.i do believe some of your uploads contain virus.chill!!!!!i am not here to burst your bubble or sow discords between you and your loyal fans.just want to confirm certain issues.

recently,i downloaded RTKXI from your torrent and after that my laptop was down with malware immediately despite it being my first torrent.(cos my laptop's pretty new)but i wasn't convinced that the virus was from your upload initially thus i went to conduct an experiment.

here's what i did.i reset my laptop to factory settings and later scanned it utilising norton which i just purchased recently.and yup of course the result shows that it's clean since it's just been reset.then afterward i dl RTK from your torrent again and scanned another round.this time round,the scan took like eternity...

well,i hope that you may check whether the RTK u uploaded has got virus if u dont mind.=D"
,hopelessfellow,2010-10-09T18:06Z,ok i am positive that your RTK torrent's got virus.how do u explain reformatting twice and downloading twice and the scanner shows the same result for both times.i do appreciate how fast it is for us to download your torrents though.
,motley666,2010-10-10T22:14Z,Probably false alarm by Norton hopelessfellow.
,Denixx,2010-10-17T17:19Z,"Hi! While I'm playing the game it just shut's down after a while. I wonder if there's any solution to the problem of mine?

,dutchdrag0n,2010-10-17T23:56Z,the point at which my game gets stuck varies but it always gets stuck at the announcement at which the village gets improved and gets called a town

,qqlanu,2011-02-26T12:11Z,does anyone knows what version is this? US or UK?
,Epizen,2011-04-13T13:25Z,"Nice try with the virus.

guild2_patch_english_10to11

Contains a virus called Hupigon which is coded in Borland Delphi. The specific strain is Hupigon (v).


Hupigon variants have several different types of features. The following list is an example of some:

â€¢ It allows others to access the computer
â€¢ Allows for recording with the user's webcam
â€¢ Can make the user's computer to attack various servers
â€¢ Send victim's computer messages
â€¢ Has rootkit functionality so it has a stealth component that hides files
â€¢ Create logs from keystrokes, steals passwords, and sends this information to remote servers"
,James41,2011-08-18T13:46Z,So you sick twisted bastard either take it down or take off your fucking virus you pig
,James41,2011-08-18T18:27Z,"ok so im sorry... sort of im going to list every little thing i saw messed the fuck up about this

#4 it crashed once again and it said missing disk after the last crash so i tried to delete the game from pc and it crashed my pc and shut it down but its ok your piece of shit work is off my pc forever"
,bearzoo,2011-08-25T10:08Z,"All of his games have viruses. Or most at the very least. All of his games are extract tons of files (a general protection no-no) and then run an .exe next (the biggest of all protection no-no's!)

If you look at his games, they get uploaded.. then that same day or the proceeding few days the same accounts leave comments saying thanks, worked great. They are his fake accounts thanking himself. He doesn't even spread it out. He just does that same and the next few days. Then there are NO comments after that on almost all of them. This was my initial indication of a fagot.

Always read the comments. Always follow the safe procedures until you know the uploader to be trustworthy. Good luck guys."
