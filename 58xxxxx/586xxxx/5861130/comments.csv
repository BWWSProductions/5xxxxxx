,ashm1986,2010-10-02T19:10Z,"Don't confuse Joint Stereo (Stereo mode 1) with the Joint Stereo coding used for MPEG layer 2 encoding - it is not the same. Joint Stereo (Stereo mode 1) encoding for MPEG layer3 allows the MP3 Encoder to use additional methods of encoding, specifically - MS Stereo (Middle/Side Stereo), and for lower bitrates only, Intensity Stereo, in addition to the Independent Channel coding used for Stereo mode 0. MS Stereo uses one channel to encode information that is identical on the left and right channels and the other channel to encode the differences between the two channels. Intensity Stereo encodes only bits that are perceived to be important to the stereophonic image. In Joint Stereo (Stereo mode 1), the encoder dynamically (frame by frame) chooses the method of encoding that produces the best quality for each individual frame. Dynamic encoding improves compression efficiency which results in a higher quality file using less bits. Stereo mode 0 encodes the left and right channels independently. The total bitrate remains constant, but the split between the channels can vary. The MP3 Encoder uses this flexibility to improve quality by allocating more bits to the channel with the more dynamic signal. For MPEG layer 3 encoding, Stereo mode 0 limits the encoder to only one method of encoding - Independent Channels. Because Stereo mode 0 is limited to one method of encoding, Joint Stereo (Stereo mode 1) in most cases produces higher quality. In the exceptions, the Stereo mode 0 quality will be essentially equivalent to Joint Stereo (Stereo mode 1)."" The use of Joint Stereo enhances sound quality such that smaller bitrates are more likely to be considered acceptable. But, the idea that JS simply discards stereo information in an attempt to trim a few kBytes off the file size is completely erroneous.

I'm not opening a debate on this, its not my rip to defend. Lot of myths about JS though hopefully allayed one or two. Thanks."

,ashm1986,2011-03-12T10:56Z,"I was showing why and how Joint Stereo (Which this is) is not always so bad. I was a bit miffed at the implication that it was bad per se, and that I would upload this if there was a higher quality copy available.

You and anyone else are welcome to look for a higher quality mp3 rip or a flac of this, I don't think you'll find one. 

Can you understand that?"
