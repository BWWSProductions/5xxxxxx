Commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain and the 90th anniversary of the band itself, Reach For The Skies will include RAF related classics such as Dambusters March, Spitfire Prelude, 633 Squadron, the Battle of Britain March and Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, as well as featuring the atmospheric sound of Spitfires flying overhead.

The album is dedicated to all those who took part in the Battle of Britain and fought for their country, from the pilots to the radar operators, engineers and plotters.

"Just like all the men and women of the commonwealth nations and our allies did during the Battle of Britain, today's men and women of the Royal Air Force show the same bravery and sacrifice throughout the world to ensure the freedom of others. If through our music we can help keep the tradition and spirit of the Battle of Britain alive, then we will have done a good job." - Wing Commander Stubbs
