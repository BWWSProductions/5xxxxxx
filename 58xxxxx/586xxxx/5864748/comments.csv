,veerenski,2010-10-03T14:25Z,"The most effective download strategy:

When you just download a large torrent containing many files, the download will pick random blocks from random files, which will require you to download the whole torrent before you actually have a single piece, a single chapter from a book fully downloaded.

What you do instead is this:

1. Select the Files tab in your torrent program.
2. Click ^A (Control-A) to select all the files.
3. Right mouse button click on files and select ""Low Priority"" from a popup window.
4. Then select a single file or several files you would like to complete first and do the same, right mouse click on those files and select ""High Priority"" from a popup.

What this does is to make sure you will first download the files with Hight Prioirity. So they will get completed first instead of randomly downloading blocks from different files.

Then watch your download and keep setting the High Priority for next batch of files you want to download. Or simply leave it alone and it will continue downloading other files after high priority files have been downloading.

Note on MP3 listening. You can start listening to MP3 files even if they are not fully complete. You can do it either via going to File tab on torrent program and double click on any file that has at least one dark blue block, which means it has been fully downloaded and saved to disk. That will automatically open your player and will start playing whatever blocks that file has downloaded up to now.

Another way is to right mouse click on a torrent in a Jobs list, and select ""Open Containing Folder"" option from the popup menu. That will open an explorer window and from there you can navigate to one of files and double click on it to play it."
,veerenski,2010-10-03T14:27Z,"Effective seeding strategy:

The basic idea is to maximize the upload speed so your torrent program shows the same seeding speed as your upload speed of your provider connection.

If you see too many torrents and too many slots on some large torrent, your seeding speed will degrade. Because there is overhead with servicing each upload slot. On a typical machine, the most efficient bandwidth utilization happens at about 8-10 upload slots. A slot is a connection to a specific downloader. Each torrent has a number of downloaders or a number of slots.

So, if you are interested in seeding many torrents, then limit the number of upload slots for each torrent by right clicking on a torrent in Job list, then selecting Properties choice from a popup menu and setting the ""Number of Upload Slots"" to 1 or 2, depending on a total number of torrents and slots are there.

Do not limit your upload rate. It will only decrease your upload performance. Each upload slot should go at the max. upload speed for best efficiency. The only criteria is total number of upload slots.

This way, you will utilize your upload bandwidth to the max.

Periodically check on all the torrents you are potentially interested in uploading and see if some of them have less than 4 seeders, which means they are not well seeded and download rate will be way too slow.

If you see some torrents that have more seeders than downloaders, those torrents are probably seeded enough. You can either pause or stop them and go check the other torrents.

Basically, the lowest reasonable number of seeders per downloaders should be 1 seeder per 1 downloader. Less than that will make downloads very slow. At about 2 seeders per downloader the download speed is quite reasonable. Starting with 3 or higher, it is quite good."
,veerenski,2010-10-03T17:45Z,"Warning from Mahasattva Anand Veeren, Acharya!

I just reviewed some video material and was utterly disgusted by all the wannabes in the ""spiritual business"" posing as interpreters of what Osho is.

ALL garbage.

First of all, not a single human being I know among Osho ""lovers"" can possibly interpret what Osho is, does or means. They can ONLY speak for themselves.

Beware of all those smiling, happy ""swamis"" that used to sell used cars and today they are selling Osho, being the parasites they are, forever parasiting on others.

They do not have it.

Osho is not just some sugar pill or candy they make you to believe he is. Never was, never will be. It is just a disgusting insult to him and his work.

Whenever you see this ""positivity"" number in the name of Osho, beware. They feed you poison. Sure, Osho is not here to put them into the place they belong. So, now MANY of them are making money on you, showing you all their phony ""happiness"" and telling you how everything is nice and dandy.

ALL lies. NOTHING to it.

The ONLY one who is real, who spent his entire life investigating as deeply and as authentically as possible, was him, Osho himself.

The first indication of a phony is a smiling face, some ""happy"" swami, posing as a ""messenger"" of Osho, interpreting what Osho is, what he means and what he does, disgusting as it is.

There are some most ""prestigious"" ""swamis"", smiling happy into your face in these videos.
I will tell you who they are in due time.

Remember one thing: ALL that you have with Osho is YOU and HIM. Anybody else in between are just nothing."
,veerenski,2010-10-03T17:53Z,"Ok, here is the trip:

If you have noticed all the dummies keep telling you what God means, what Jesus means, what is their word and what do they imply.

These sick people are so idiotic as to not even being able to comprehend that their monkey minds can not possibly interpret what God means, what he says and why. Nor they have a slightest clue of what Jesus or ANY master, for that matter, is or what is his purpose.

They are just zombies, brainwashed into some ideology, and, at the same time, being as dumb as it gets, if not dumber, to even conceive of an idea that you can POSSIBLY interpret what others say, do, or mean, especially when we talk about someone WELL beyond their comprehension.

Jesus, Osho, Socrates, Pythagoras and quite a few others gave their lives for That Which Is, and these phonies are simply looking for some recipe on ""happiness"". They think that if they smile a lot it will delude you into believing they are real, which is the most idiotic thing conceivable."
,veerenski,2010-10-03T18:02Z,"You, suckers, calling themselves big names better get your shit together and go get a job at some McDonalds. Quit parasiting on others.

You simply do not think you, as you are, are worth a dead mosquito fart and about the easiest thing for you to ""survive"" is to lick some rear end of someone, recognized as something real.

And you, idiots, think by parasiting on others and all your phony smiles are worth even paying attention to.

Just look at that Tirtha ass. I could not believe it, when I saw this:

Osho Video - Geetam, Another Way Of Living - With SW Anand Tirtha

Do you see this crook, pretending to be a ""saint"", who betrayed Osho and even had guts to write back to Osho and ""explain"" why he does not even mention Osho's name?

Just look at his eyes, winking like the eyes of a thief, betraying themselves just to betray Osho later on.

They are forever calculating, not even realizing they are saying things against their own being, which they would have to deny later on, pathetic as it is."
,veerenski,2010-10-03T19:31Z,"One way of seeing these phonies is the clothes, and they do not even realize it.

They will have some hat or some robe or some other gadget that will make them look different than others. Something ""special"", you know?

Amazingly enough, that is probably the easiest way to recognize a phony.

Another thing is, quite often, they will put their picture on the top of Osho's. Like that phony Osho Rajneesh and his web site. The very first thing you will see is HIS picture, the picture of nobody, so you see it first. And only somewhere in the middle of the page, if you are lucky, there will be a picture of Osho.

But WHO are these conmen if there was no Osho? Would you even know or care they even exist?

How pathetic do you need to get ""just to survive, just to survive""?

Grrr!!!"
,veerenski,2010-10-04T05:59Z,"This Gurudev pseudo-master, whose shoes some of them are licking, with his ""cleaning your psyche""  trip as shown on these videos:

  Osho Video - 40 Day Osho Meditation Retreat

is phony.

His hat is phony.
His dance if phony.
His words are phony.

He has nothing to give.
He is a beggar, a typical brahmin, ""teaching"" something he does not have.

He just keeps repeating the words of Osho like there is a need for it, screwing with your minds.

Do not listen to these parasites.
Beware!
There is no need for any ""medium"" between you and Osho, between you and God, between you and existence."
,veerenski,2010-10-04T06:14Z,"Jesus this Gurudev is disgusting!

""One has to transcend consciousness""?!?
""Once you transcended consciousness, you have transcended EVERYTHING...
and that is what we truly are"".

Are you insane, you complex of inferiority driven fool?

First of all, there is nothing to ""transcend"".
All your ""transcendence"" is simply idiocy.

What happens to you once you ""transcend"" consciousness? Do you understand?

DEATH!


""Unless you penetrate...""

There is nothing to ""penetrate"" you fool.
It is just a byproduct of your violence and sexual sickness.
The need to penetrate is what?

You are just a businessman parasiting on all sorts of fools, who gave their own power over themselves to you, hoping to get something in return.

That is all there is to it."
,veerenski,2010-10-05T04:43Z,"What?

Yes, I have heard ALL sorts of stories about this so called inner circle and all the corporations built around Osho's name and fame. And I have heard the first hand statements by people close to Osho including some of his best musicians.

But I have not heard this one so far.

It has to do with some of the very best of the best Osho musicians, Miten and Premal.

This criminally minded money gang calling themselves all sorts of names and titles even had guts to do clearly destructive acts, such as whining to YouTube so that they remove some of the creative work by Mitten.

Grrrrr!!!!

Once you raise your dinky paper sword against nothing less then creativity, beware. Your rotten head is off.

The Diamond Sword knows no mercy. 

Remember this, you worshipers of the golden calf.

This video is made by Miten and it talks about it:

Osho Video - Osho, No Copyright On Freedom

Looks like the time has come to do some investigation on these corporations and foundations. Specifically, the money and copyright related issues.

Secondly, I am not sure they will be able to provide evidence that they are either rightful copyright or trademark holders. The copyright law is one of the most complex areas of law and the issues of validity of copyright ownership are not that simple."
,veerenski,2010-10-05T04:47Z,"The essence of copyright law consists in protection of the author of a creative work and not some phony, capitalizing on work of someone else.

Osho is gone. And he is the only one who can possibly claim the copyright. Secondly, things like bible or recognized religious works are not a subject to copyright as there is such a notion as a benefit to mankind and ""fair use"".

Yes, if the original copyright holder sells his rights, it is another matter. But I just have a feeling all their copyright talk is nothing more than a bluff, and once they start using it as a sword to destroy some of the most outstanding works of creativity, they disgrace themselves in the most profound ways.

There is no evil more profound that the evil of destruction, the destruction of creative work.
There is, and can not possibly be any mercy when such perverted and disgusting things happen.

From what I have seen, whatever is happening in the name of Osho with all these ""corporations"", ""foundations"", ""resorts"" and ""retreats"" is probably the ugliest form of the orgy of money.

ALL fake, and not only fake, but criminal in its very essence and intent."

,veerenski,2010-10-05T05:05Z,"And do not EVER stand on the way of what is happening here or ANYWHERE I appear.

Ask Sheela and Vidiya. They will tell you.

There was only once when Sheela wanted to get on my way. It was at the hall of the airport in Rajneeshpuram in Oregon. Sheela, forever looking few new ways to exploit things once entered into that hall with her ""high powered"" commission. She had an idea that the hall where only me and Margaret, probably the best reporter and investigator of Osho worked. Only two of us in a huge hall.

So Sheela came to see how this hall can be used ""better"". When she and her gang just walked in, I heard the sound of a door and stood up from a chair and looked straight into her eyes. Because I knew what was in her mind.
The whole ""high power"" ""commission"" stopped right at the door. They did not even have guts to enter the hall. They stood there for few seconds while I was looking straight into the Sheela's eyes without any smile and ANY ""proper"" respect.

So they stood there frozen for few seconds. Then Sheela turned around and they all left through the same door they entered and that was the only time she ever even attempted anything like this with me.

Yes, Sheela is not as dumb as MOST of them. She does have some quality none of them have, and who knows, she may have her second chance. I just tell you one thing, if Sheela gets involved into all this jazz, all these ""commissions"" will be flying like dead chickens, right through the window, directly to the garbage dump. Because no matter how you cut it, SHE is the real doer. SHE built the Osho's commune in Oregon, which was his biggest and most cherished experiment, an experiment to build a healthy environment where New Man live is joy and harmony with nature.

This experiment was destroyed by you know whom. Well, actually, you do not know who stands behind it all. But who knows..."
,veerenski,2010-10-05T14:34Z,"I will work with Sheela this time if she decides to get involved and she is ready this time and she is the one, who can EASILY see though this crap. EASILY.

She did not pay attention to me on at least two occasions in Oregon. I can only guess it was too much at a time and she was concerned with all sorts of vital things. I nearly lost my head, and I mean literally, dancing before her and FOR her. But she probably got just baffled by it, being busy with all sorts of vital things for the commune. That's OK. No problem.

But this time, you better pay attention, honey. Pay attention to the way I sneeze."

,veerenski,2010-10-06T21:44Z,"Here is an interesting article where they argue the case related to Osho trademark and copyright issues:

http://www.sannyasnews.org/latest/archives/341

It is interesting that the Osho International Foundation cronies argue the need for trademark and copyright in order to PROTECT the works of Osho from all sorts of abuses. They go as far as to claim that now some shady business from China will take Osho work and pervert it or adapt it in order to sell more condoms or something as equally insane.

ALL phony arguments. Osho work can not be perverted or modified for a single reason. His voice discourses are widely available and it is a preferable and much more comfortable way to receive the information. Plus audio and video contain much more information than the book format. Because his presence is felt much stronger and those gaps, that are the essence of what he is saying, no matter what he is talking about, are preserved in that format.

The audio and video discourses can not be forged, unless you are insane.

But even more significant part is that these phony trademarks and copyright issues are used as a sword against Osho sannyasins and lovers, and that is probably the biggest crime there is as far as his work goes."

Quit parasiting on his work, you, nobodies, posing as some kind of authorities speaking on behalf of him, like you know what he wanted, what he means, what is his purpose or what is his ""message"". There is no central ""message"" of him as far as I know. He has BOOKS worth of ALL sorts of ""messages"". It all depends on your interpretations and your interest and intent.

And that is the bottom line of all this. Whenever I see some of you, phonies with soft deep voice and a plastic smile interpreting what he says or does, I will be compelled to step in and do my part."

http://www.oshoworld.com/meditation/meditations.asp?news_id=about#1.%20What%20is%20meditation?

I suggest you sign the statements on that page at least so everyone knows WHO is saying it. Is it an Osho quote or is it some sannyasin, and if it is, WHO is he? What is his name? I'd like to know that.

As far as ""what is meditation and what is concentration"", things are not as simple.

Once you condemn the concentration, you condemn the very mind. Not a great idea I'd say.

These are different things, different meals, for different times of day.

Osho once said:
""You do need the mind. When I am speaking to you I am using the mind..."" (not a literal quote)

So...

Beware, when you think of things like ""transcending the mind"". UTTER garbage.

To ""transcend"" the mind is to transcend the life itself. If you manage to ""transcend"" it, you won't be able to walk, to speak, to understand anything and to even have a good shit at your bathroom.

Mind is as much a part of your system as anything else. In fact, the most significant part.

The only thing is it has its own purpose and limitations. If this is the ONLY thing you think is valid about you, that is a mistake.

Mind has its place, and that place is by far the largest place in your life. But it is only a mechanical aspect to a large extent.

Long story... But beware of condemning your mind as something useless, something to get rid off. First of all, it can not be done. In Russia they say ""you can not jump higher than your own dick"". LITERALLY.

Mind is a beautiful system, the most powerful thing there is. But like any mechanism, it needs rest. You can not run your car all day long. It will burn out eventually.

There is a place and time to eat,
and there is a place and time to shit,
and there is a place and time to strain,
and there is a place and time to drain,
and there is a place and time to forget all the commotion."
,veerenski,2010-10-07T00:43Z,"Ok, and now the REAL show begins.

I could care less about those monkeys and their ""inner circles"". About the ONLY ""inner circle"" I know of is the circle pronounced by Osho at the ranch. Those ""who are remained behind the scenes and not to do something in public, but do the work being utterly unnoticed"" (not a literal quote).

Now, about God.

Hold on to your seats now.

Osho keeps claiming there is no god.
Well, there is a problem with this argument, a problem of intellectual honesty of a philosopher, which is about the highest value there is.

Now...

Osho IS a ""professional"" philosopher and of about the highest caliber there is.

Therefore, to make such claims is UTTERLY inappropriate. The philosophical argument is simple:

If you did not see something, never experienced it, it does not mean it does not exist. So, strictly speaking, he, knowing full well such an argument is invalid, is simply lying, which is probably the highest order of insult to any real philosopher, interested in ""that which is"", as Osho claims.

Why?

Well, at some point everybody thought the earth is flat. If you would come and tell them it is just a sphere, they would simply kill you. The same thing happens every day."
,veerenski,2010-10-07T01:57Z,"Yes, Osho DID all sorts of investigations and he hever found a trace of god. Understood. But what does it mean, really? Does it mean the earth is still flat?

The problem with God is that by very definition they lay outside the scope of what we are. Otherwise, it is not god, but a puppet, built in our own image, based in limitations of all kinds including the limitations of a physical body.

So, therefore, I, Mahasattva Anand Veeren, Acharya, will step up to the plate and proclaim:

One can not POSSIBLY assert such a thing as there is no god. This is just profoundly intellectually dishonest and is against ""that which is"" as Osho himself defined truth.

What is the purpose of him making such statement is a different story. Yes, you could comprehend a few reasons for him making these statements. One of them is zombification and biorobotization of a human mind. In that respect, asserting ""there is no god"" serves some purpose indeed, just to deny all the mind conditioning. Long story.

The bottom line: Beware! Do not EVER surrender your intelligence to ANYTHING or ANYBODY. YOU are the final ""judge"" of what is what and who is who. Do not just swallow ANYTHING, just because some ""authority"" pronounces something. Because you do not necessarily know what they mean and what is their purpose. Examine every single detail, every smallest statement or event.

YOU are it. Not anybody else. Things will come and go. And what will remain is YOU, and NO ONE but you. Anything else is just a pipe dream, Maya as they call it in India."
,veerenski,2010-10-07T02:17Z,"About mind:

Grrrrr!!!!

Yes, it is probably the most subtle subject and there are reasons various ""religious leaders"" condemn it.

But this has been taken WAY out of proportions.

I will go as blunt as it gets and proclaim:

ALL talk and condemnation of the mind is just sickness!

Yes, during various periods of history, there was a purpose of shifting attention from the mind and showing there is something else, and that was probably the most revolutionary discovery. Mind is not IT. True.

But all the ideas of ""transcending"" the mind, the ideas that the mind is inherently ""evil"" is nothing different than the witch hunts.

Mind feeds your stomach.
Your stomach could care less about your ""enlightenment"". That is just an attempt at futility.

What is the purpose of teeth in your mouth?
Ever thought about this, you ""green"" whatever you think you are?

Well, the purpose of teeth in your mouth is to kill!!! To kill other forms of life.
You don't eat rocks, or do you?

The mind is about the biggest and the only treasure you have. The real one.

But...

It is true that vast majority of minds out there are simply insane. Because mind, by itself is like a computer, a functioning machine. Long subject.

So...

The purpose of saying ""beware of the madness of the mind"" is true to a large extent.

But...

At this point it has become a hindrance.
You have all these Tirtha asses asserting absolutely insane things not even realizing they are betraying themselves.

I have no interest in digging deeper at this point. We'll see."
,veerenski,2010-10-07T07:29Z,"These most fundamental concepts of God, Mind and Truth will be the way to recognize the phonies among all those ""therapists"" and anybody capitalizing on Osho and his work, which is immense ANY way you cut it.

To me personally, it is simply disgusting to see or hear their blabber about how ""evil"" the mind is in principle and the ""dire"" need to get rid of it and become dumb as a piece of wood.

Yes, meditation puts the whole thing in proper perspective and once you have a grip of it, it is tremendously healing, because the mind does have a tendency to go wild, forever inventing more and more complications.

But look at the mind as the most outstanding toy, the most outstanding tool for measuring the life force itself, the most amazing system of interaction between you and the outside world.

Its power and beauty is immense and Osho enjoyed it to such an extent, I am not aware of a single other individual, who played with the mind and enjoyed it like Osho. In that respect he is the king of kings of the mind. That one I am not going to argue.

And yes, he DID have to emphasize the mind's inability to give you any answers as to the very nature of life and your own being. Because it is not its purpose it seems.

As you become a meditator, which I, personally, highly recommend, you won't be obsessed with mind as you were before. For the first time in your life you will recognize its place in your life and will relax about most of your inner tensions, arising as a result of mind conditioning, zombification and bio-robotization, inevitably done to you and everyone else.

http://oshosearch.net/Convert/Articles_Osho/The_Razors_Edge/Osho-The-Razors-Edge-00000025.html

Also, in that discourse, you will find this:
""Heart is not useful, it has no purpose to fulfill...""
I disagree, and in the most drastic terms.
Heart IS ""useful"" in that it provides you the very impetus to be, which mind can not possibly provide.

It ""provides"" you the very joy, the very awe of existence, the very appreciation, the very notion of beauty.

And it also feels. Mind does not feel. It could care less. It only reasons and evaluates the probabilities of future actions and calculates the outcomes.

Heart also LOVES. What is higher than love of a mother towards her own child? And I say: NOTHING. Not even this ""enlightenment"" thing.

It is heart, that is capable of stopping all sorts of violence on your way. Because it feels, feels not only for yourself, but for the whole world also.

It is heart that allows you to fly high as a bird.

Is THAT ""useful""?

Osho himself said:
""My way is the way of the heart"".
What a ""useless"" thing to say!"
,veerenski,2010-10-07T12:35Z,"Here is a little more detailed writeup on this Gurudev phony:

http://oshosearch.net/Convert/Mahasattva_Veeren_Speaks.html#About%20Gurudev%20pseodo-master

And he is quite a typical conman, just like all other ""therapists"".

Who even included this marketing propaganda in the Osho video torrents?

Why did you do that?"
,veerenski,2010-10-08T00:08Z,"Well, this is not a final version of what I have to say. But I feel enough urgency to publish it as is.

I will give you just a small part here because this site does not allow a lot of text to be written in a single post. If you get interested in the rest of it, look here:

http://oshosearch.net/Convert/Mahasattva_Veeren_Speaks.html#Beware%20of%20spiritual%20criminals

Beware of ""spiritual"" criminals!

Just look at this Gurudev conman.
The first 10 days of his ""40 Day Osho Meditation Retreat"" is what?

Well, it is reducing you to a beast.
These criminals, knowingly or unknowingly, are manipulating your mind and force it to become lower than a beast in order for you to surrender""
your intelligence to them so they could ""fix"" you later on as you will INEVITABLY see on their later videos.

But do they actually ""fix"" ANYTHING in you?
Ask anybody you know and see how far did they get in this ""enlightenment"" thing they were promised exists if you are authentic and sincere enough.

The problem with the mind if you do not trust yourself is that it is an extremely powerful tool. It will allow you to travel to all sorts of places and take all sorts of forms. You can imagine you are ANYTHING, no matter who you ""really"" are. Even if you are the most gentle being, never in your life committing any violence, you can become as violent as a monster if you want by simply manipulating your mind and making it take any kind of form or shape the mind controller wants."
,veerenski,2010-10-08T01:00Z,"Jesus funken Christ!

I do not recall being as disgusted as I am with this Gurudev phony.

I had to look at all 3 of his videos included in this torrent and it is such a profound bluff, such a disgusting parrotry of Osho,
so full of these ""new age"" images of ""peace"",
so full of imagery of these poor fools, not even knowing what is that they are looking for,
so full of marketing templates of ""spirituality"",
I am just utterly disgusted.

I could not even watch the 3rd video to the end.
I simply wanted to throw up, so ugly is this phony beauty and Osho impersonation it is.

So, I guess Osho is right when he says ""there is no god""!

:-)"
,veerenski,2010-10-08T01:27Z,"Well, I bet quite a few people, who were hanging around Osho, now claim ""enlightenment"". I just bet you.

But...

I have to see a single trace of it.
ALL bluff.

I could never understand people who are desperate enough to do the ugliest things in the world ""just to survive, just to survive"".

Why didn't they get some education so they could actually do something useful?

One humorist said:
""If you could attach their legs to the electric motor so they could generate some electric power, can you imagine how many light bulbs they could light up?""

EXACTLY.

And if you could attach some wire to their brains, can you imagine how many light bulbs all these mad neurons could produce?

No wonder Hose Delgado says:

""We need a program of psychosurgery and political control of our society. The purpose is physical control of the mind. Everyone who
deviates from the given norm can be surgically
mutilated.

The individual may think that the most important
reality is his own existence, but this is only his personal point of view. This lacks historical perspective.

Man does not have the right to develop his own
mind. This kind of liberal orientation has great appeal. We must electrically control the brain.
Some day armies and generals will be controlled
by electrical stimulation of the brain.""

Poor soul, lost in rivers of bullshit, he himself created, floating in it up to his ears.

You really suck full time. I have just reviewed your main web site. Yes, you ARE quite some character. No questions about it.

It was simply amazing to see how much bullshit you can produce in the shorted possible amount of time.

But you see, you have a little problem. The problem is that you are posing as a master, trying to replace Osho, by saying things like ""we are getting back together again under guidance and with full participation of The Biggest Bullshit Peddler in the entire history of Osho, Osho Rajneesh himself"".

Not nice, suxy. Not nice at all.

Yes, you can create all these dazzling piles of pictures, showing nothing of any significance, piled up on the top of each other, mixing shit with sand. Yes, you CAN do that.

But what is the hurry?

You seem to be in a hurry to travel ALL over the world, wherever you can stick your wenie in, trying to distribute some ""message"".

WHAT ""message"", you fool?

ALL the ""messages"" are already there, and by the ORIGINAL one, Osho, and not some phony, capitalizing on his name and fame.

Yes, you seem to be running out of your skin to get as much ""fame"" as you can manage in the shortest possible time.

But...

Do you really believe ANY of it yourself?
Are you THAT dumb?

Under what authority and according to what certificate, issued by Osho, do you pose as some kind of replacement of him?"

,veerenski,2010-10-09T03:24Z,"Jeeez!

Now, looking at all this stuff and seeing things I do not believe my eyes, it seems to be a miracle that I did not throw away that certificate issued in the Osho's name.

When I was given it at the ranch, I kinda went:
What?
What is this?
What do I need this for?
What do I do with it?

And ALL it had is one single sentence:

""Mahasattva Swami Anand Viren, M.M. D.Phil.M (RIMU), Acharya"".

Signed by Osho, the REAL one,
on June 11, 1984.

And that was the ONLY thing it said!
The most beautiful and powerful letterhead I ever seen, and the only thing it had is that sentence.

Sheela did not even tell me what it means.

Then I heard Osho describing what the whole thing means and talking about ""those who are to remain behind the scenes and do their work without anyone even knowing about it, and who do not even know who the others of the same level are"".

That sounded like some woodoo to me at the moment.

But look at it now...

Jeez! Have mercy on a poor goofball like myself!

Ok, tell you one thing.
Now, I will stuff this certificate into ANYBODY'S face, whenever I want.

Bring all those ""great spiritual teachers, therapists and masters"" here. We'll process them in bulk.
I am in the mood now.

Where is that Sheela hiding?
How many times do I have to call you?

Just ask. Right here."

SMART, I tell you.
That is why she is Anand. Anand is given to males, not females. She is the only Anand woman I know of.

Yes, sure, she is not Einstein in terms of technical details, but she is a Jew, and about the best of it. When no one even looks at something, or even bothers about it, she gets that thing under her belt. And that is how she was able to manage to run the entire commune in Oregon. I do not know a single person who would be able to do what she did.

Do not worry, Sheela, I LOVE you, and I know you love me also, and that is why you pronounced me and BG as geniuses. When I heard it, I kinda went ""what""? How does she know? What DOES she know? But you know what? She funken knows!

Sheela, I, hereby, erase everything clean.
Forget about anything that bothered you.
In fact, there is nothing to erase.
Every single thing was done exactly as it was the best way of doing it.
There is nothing to regret.
There is nothing to forget.

,veerenski,2010-10-09T04:14Z,"Sheela,

I want to know something.

Can you talk about this now?"
,veerenski,2010-10-09T04:17Z,"Request to anyone connected to Osho:

Would you kindly give me the names and possibly URLS of all those ""masters"" or big asses that are using or used to use the name of Osho?

I'd like to look at that crap.

We need to clean it all up.
I will take care of it personally, one by one basis.
Who knows, may be even BG, ""the German"" will show up here... You never know. You never know.

I do not think they have an extradition treaty with the USA, which seems to be an issue."

,veerenski,2010-10-09T12:09Z,"Here is an interesting bit:

-- Quote begin ---

Krishnamurti had no time for Bhagwan, and particularly objected to the use of the word Bhagwan; nobody other than God himself should use that title, he said. Krishnamurti had told Deeksha: I have received thousands of letters from all over the world asking why I do not speak out in public against this man. But I will not, as it is not my way.

The man is a criminal. You have to understand this very clearly. What he is doing to people in the name of spirituality is criminal.

One must never give to another human being â€“ and he is simply a human being â€“ your ultimate manifestation of consciousness, which is your ability to make decisions for yourself.

You have made a great mistake in giving him hat power for twelve years, but understand this:
no man has power except the power his followers give him. That is why he needs people around him all the time, and the more the better.â€

--- Quote end ---"
,veerenski,2010-10-09T20:20Z,"So...

The ""bottom line"" is this:

Osho gives you information and ideas. And that's it.
From then on, you need to use your own mind and see if these ideas are of any interest to you, if you agree or disagree, and if you see any value in it.

And, one more time: Beware! You are dealing with an atom bomb. You can blame no one if you get screwed up in your head by blindly believing or accepting ANYTHING he says.

He is not god. He constantly denies the existence of god.

He is not absolute ANYTHING.

He also states on record that masters make mistakes. So, do not expect him to tell you the 100% truth. First of all, there is no such a thing.

But he DID all sorts of study and he is cunning enough to see through all sorts of conmen and show you their cunningness.

They say: ""in order to know one you have to be one"".

So...

It is YOUR life. Do not blame anyone if you get screwed up with this ""trust"" he demands and with this ""surrender"".

Do not EVER surrender is what I say.
EVER!
Under ANY circumstances.
Because chances are you are going to get screwed first before you see any ""benefits"".

If you are just a dummy, blame no one for your mistrust to your own being.

Clear enough?"
,veerenski,2010-10-09T20:57Z,"Basically, he is obsessed with death.
He says: ""death is the ultimate peak in life"" (not a literal quote).

Which is UTTER bullshit according to me.

Death is not, and can not possibly be ANY ""peak"" according to me. It is just a minute part in your life, just like anything else. There is nothing special about it, just like an orgasm. If you think orgasm is ""the ultimate peak of life"", you are just a fool. Is taking a good shit an ""ultimate peak of life""? Well, it IS, according to this monkey logic. And I am a logician, and about of as high of a caliber as it gets.

My own feeling is death obsession, which is blamed Christians for, is a result of his degeneracy, just as Gregory Klimov describes.
You can review this article to see what we are talking about:
""Degenerates Rule the World!: Klimov Interview""
http://alt.nntp2http.com/discordia/2008/09/c9a948c4c3f0cbdb1a0bac9df236d8f3.html

Now, it is commonly known that he had severe problems with health. His back, his asthma and other things, which is bound to affect ones perception as to the whole ""value"" of life and its limitations, no matter how you look at it.

Secondly, as he himself states on record, he has spent his childhood being totally alone, sitting by some lake, which is bound to affect anyone. He did not have a chance to play with other children or even mix with them. His grandparents would not allow it, I can only guess because they felt their genetic pool is ""superior"" to mortals, a typical degeneracy syndrome, I'd say."
,veerenski,2010-10-09T21:09Z,"So, I do not know what is the cause of what, but he was about the biggest pest you could even hope to find, getting on everyone's case, showing them ""how screwed up they are"", and I, personally, do not support this attitude.

He even brags about him, pissing by the sign at the hospital gate that said: ""no pissing allowed"" or something of that sort.

As a result, he had a poor policemen fired from his job because Osho lied to the hospital chief saying that he pissed under the fence because the policemen pissed also. Now, this is probably one of the most disgusting examples of interference into some one else's life even though he himself claims on record that anyone should have his freedom to decide how and what is he interested in doing in his life.

I am not aware of anyone in my entire life who would harass the others as much as he did, interfering in their own choice on how or what to live.

And, as some of his closest ""disciples"" state, he could care less about even his own ""disciples"". It was totally ego-centric. His fetish and obsessions with objects, money, diamonds, Rolls Royces were beyond disgusting, and I can testify out of my own experience to that. Not that it matters to me at this time."
,veerenski,2010-10-09T21:10Z,"When the ranch was about to collapse, he just hoped on the plane and split, leaving all his people as they were. In my particular case, I did not have a penny in my pocket. I could not even leave. Because I could not even buy myself a ticket, not even mentioning that even if I could, I could not even afford to rent an apartment, or even buy myself some food for that matter. And I was one of those, who gave every single penny and every single object that I had to the commune in Oregon.

So, no one was even interested how would people leave the ranch in terms of money. Because some of them also had nothing left.
All the Rolls Royces were sold at half price at best and instead of taking this money and making sure his ""disciples"" are taken care of, he just split and did not even leave the instructions to make sure all ""his people"" are taken care of in terms of the most basic needs.

Grrrr!!!!

Sure, he is dead now. What does it matter to him?
And he told what would be his ""last words"" before he conks out: ""Fuck you all"".

Do I need to say more?"
,veerenski,2010-10-09T21:33Z,"So he says: ""Beware of Socialism"",
and I say: beware of religious parasites that will suck you out dry for as long as you last.
They will suck your very life energy, to the very last drop.

Because they are simply suicidal, and I can only guess, because they are totally uncreative, and, instead of trying to create something, no matter how small it might look to others, they simply decide to parasite on others. Why work when you can simply suck someone else's blood?

One more time:

Nirvana is death.
Moksha (final liberation) is death.
Samadhi is death.

They are selling you death.

And yes, they are SELLING it to you.
NONE of them are just giving it to you for free.

From the very beginning, you had to pay top dollar, several times more the going price, just to eat at their kitchen, where people were working like slaves for NOTHING. They were not paid even a penny.

And look at this ""resort"" in Poona (Pune) now.
What do you see?
Well, the prices to stay and get zombified by those ""therapists"" are about as high as a five start hotel on the West. How this could possibly be the case in one of the poorest countries int he world?

Osho was, is and will remain to be an empire of money. Nothing more than that.

It is utterly disgusting in terms of even bothering about those very people that provide that money for this money machine to hum like Bentley."
,veerenski,2010-10-09T21:53Z,"Sheela said:

""Do you think he is THAT dumb not to know what is going on? I did that, which HE told me to do."" (not a literal quote)

And I have no reasons not to trust he in this statement. I just know too much about the whole thing and I have seen the examples of it. His very mind is about the best example of it.

""If you are not with me, you are AGAINST me"".
Yep. And ANYBODY, who would have ""enough"" of it, would be harassed if they decided to leave. The message would be passed to the ""meditation centers"" where they live and all sorts of most disgusting campaigns of trying to discredit them would start. INEVITABLY.
It is pretty much the same thing as Scientology in its relentlessness, its viciousness and its disgust.

What seems to be the problem?
Someone, who knows some things, decides to leave? So what?"
,veerenski,2010-10-09T21:53Z,"About the very first thing I have noticed is the face of Lakshmi in Poona 1. That face struck me as manifestation of evil most profound when I saw her picture on the back cover of one of his books, if I am not mistaken ""The way of the white cloud"". That was the face of evil manifest.

Later on, when the whole thing moved to Oregon, she was thrown out into a garbage dump like a used condom. She was crawling on her knees to be ""accepted"" back, and, if I recall correctly, she had a terminal cancer. But now way.

So some of his closest ""disciples"" were thrown out like garbage. He could care less. Seems to me ""they know too much and they are not needed any longer. It would be better to get a new, fresh blood and get some clueless slaves to replace them. By the time they will figure out what is it all about, we'll throw them away just the same"".

He has plenty of titles of a kind ""the biggest this and the biggest that"". But I have not seen a title ""the biggest conman the world has ever seen"" so far. To con SO many people you really deserve a Shnobel (big nose) prize."
,veerenski,2010-10-09T22:10Z,"And now the time has come to look at it as an example of zombification as deeply as possible.

Everything is in place and there has never been a time where things could be researched as easily and as fast as they can be now.

So...

It is up to you, people.
Do as you wish.

Just remember one thing as far as I know:
When you take a good shit at the bathroom, it is not anything less then when you meditate.

If you think meditation will take you to some ""ultimate"" reality, you are just a fool.

The ""ultimate reality"" is where you sit right now.
The ""bliss"" is what is happening to you this very moment.

Sure, learn from him, and he does deserve plenty of credits as being the one, who had guts to investigate all the corruption and blindness.

But most of it is just bragging about himself, telling you all those hour long stories ""about me and about me"". It is ALL ""about me"" type of thing.

Could I care less which way he has farted when he was young and who did he screwed with his cunning mind.

There are pests of people. You can find them any place you go.

And there are those on receiving end of it.
Does it mean the pests are more ""evolved""?
Does it mean ""the survival of the fittest"" degenerate idea, created by ZioNazis, any more valid?

Does it mean, this sick, death obsessed man, calling himself ""Bhagwan"" or ""Osho"" is more deserving in terms of ""progress of consciousness""?

Because I have allowed her, Sheela could not do anything and she became aware of her intelligence, creativity; she saw certainly that she is going to be her rival. When her all crimes are exposed -- and the moment all her crimes were slowly being exposed, she escaped from here with twenty criminals who were part of the gang. She has placed all her people on all the power posts in the commune. So they are all hiding in the Black Forest in Germany.""

Yes, sure, it is your trademark style to milk anyone with money, power and fame.

And that is why there was massive destruction of evidence when the Orgen commune was started. Remember that one? In Edison department? Where all the personal cards were examined and if there was something compromising found on the back of those card, they were either to be destroyed or recreated?

Well, it was all written on the back of your personal card. Who you are, how rich you are, and the rest that could have been gathered about you.

So, when you ask a question and he answers it on some lecture, he will tell you some details about your personal life that no one knows but yourself. And that would be presented as evidence that he has some ""all seeing eye"" of ""the greatest master that ever lived"".

THAT is how, you fools.
And some of you had to unzip your fat valets as a result.

And if ANY of you would become his ""sannyasins"" and they learned you are a fat cat, he would dedicate the entire lecture, licking your ass and sucking your dick or pussy, just to milk you for your money and show you how significant you are in the scheme of things.

Gitit?"
,veerenski,2010-10-10T13:48Z,"And that is why he answered the question ""what would be your last words"" as:

Oh, there is no evidence left?
You pretend the Rolls Royces are not yours. They just belong to commune?

And with the other side of your mouth you say ""I would not sell you MY Rolls Royce"" is what?

Well, if those Rolls Royces, diamond watches, and all your other shiny objects belonged to commune, then how come no one ever saw ANY of them used by that very commune?

Gitit?

WHO designed all these corporations, foundations, funds and all other schemes?

Well, YOU, the ""master of disaster"".

WHO took 16 pills a day of some of the most potent tranquilizers just to look as relaxed as you are?

""turn the whole thing upside down"",

Well, and then?

What do you expect at the end?
How about YOU, being placed under the microscope?

Ever thought about that, you, pathetic worshiper of death, one of the most destructive degenerates one can even hope to find?

You leave me without a penny when that whole Oregon scam gets to the point beyond control, and you just hope the charter plane and hope to split from all of it, leaving your ""lovers"" in UTTER shit?

Cool.

Just look at this ""greatest master that ever lived"" after he was arrested. I have NEVER seen him like this. The most pathetic, utterly helpless conman, exposed for what he really is.

Btw, what happened to his allergies and asthma?
From what he himself said, he was treated in jail like shit, and yet he did not die from asthma attack.

But when I took a good shower before coming to his ""darshan"", ""the meeting with the master"", what did they do to me, sniffing all my holes?

Well, they just told me: no go, you stink too much!

,veerenski,2010-10-11T01:26Z,"Osho says: enlightened man cannot concentrate.
The significance of that statement cannot be underestimated. Because everything in real life needs concentration, no matter how small, insignificant or minute some action is.

In order to operate and be able to produce anything in terms of creativity or in terms of any other kind of action, you need concentration.
Even to understand something needs concentration.

This implies that the ""enlightened"" man is a pathological parasite.

He can not possibly do anything in life if he can not concentrate. Even to clean the floor requires concentration. Even to throw garbage away from your garbage can you need concentration.

And that is what we see all over with all these ""enlightened"" ""gurus"". They just parasite on others. And not only parasite by begging with a bowl, but mega-parasite, owning castles and fat bank accounts.

Is THAT what they call the servants of ""truth""?

And all others are expected to work their rears of, just to bring the fruits of their labor to the feet of these parasites. The real people have to deal with and face all sorts of issues in order to operate in the physical world. But these so called enlightened ones can only give you lectures on how screwed up you are and offer you some ""therapies"" to ""fix"" you, and I am yet to see a single case of any kind of spiritual ""therapy"" fixing ANYONE or anything.

Chandra Mohan was obsessed with hypnosis and its techniques. He is on record as being a hypnotist. If you realize what a hypnotist can do to a suggestive mind, programmed with ""total trust"" and ""total surrender"", your scull would crack.

Do a search on Wolf Messing. Here is just a small bit of it:

Have you heard of Wolf Messing and Stalin's tests to verify his abilities?

Stalin designed this test for him: you go to this particular branch of a bank and show a blank piece of paper to a teller and she should give you hundred thousand roubles. If you can do that, I will believe you are not a conman. And Messing would perform just as expected.

Another test Stalin created is to ask Messing to come see him in the Kremlin without having any ID, entering via main gate. The thing is, there were at least five posts with KGB guards at every single door. To get to the Stalin's office without being the topmost level official was a miracle. No one, under any circumstances, would be able to do that. But for Messing, not a
problem at all. When he opened the door of Stalin's office, Stalin nearly felt on his ass. And these are just a couple of examples of what can be done to your mind. EASILY!"
,veerenski,2010-10-12T04:08Z,"Now, pay attention to this:

Messing, in ALL the tests, did not even say a word to any guards, tellers or anybody.

He would just walk past the most guarded post and the guard would simply think that this is such and such prime minister passing by.

The teller would see the 100,000 dollar check when shown a blank piece of paper.

Sleepers are programmed with the trigger words or phrases. When these words are pronounced, they perform ANY kind of act they are programmed to perform, be it murder or anything else they were programmed with.

The story of enlightenment, the story of significance for anyone, who seeks something they think they do not have:

When I was 6 years old, there was a beautiful winter with lots of thick, fluffy snow. The snow was so immensely beautiful, you could not miss a moment of it. So I played with it outside all day long.

When the night has come and I have gone to bed, my temperature has risen to near death level. As I felt asleep, I had this dream:

I was standing on the top of a huge hill, like a mountain. When I looked down the hill, all of a sudden, I saw a lion, walking very slowly up the hill in my direction. It was a frightening experience.

So...

I looked at the right to see if I could escape that way, and I was shocked. There was also a lion, coming up to me very, very slowly.

Then I looked at the left.
The same thing.
And so when I looked in the back.

At that point, it was it.
There was absolutely nothing I could do.
And the lions kept walking up the hill towards me. As slowly as it gets. So I still had some time. Probably a minute or so.

I knew one thing. Once they reach me, that is the end of me.

There was nothing left to be done. I could not do a single thing, no matter what.

And I stood there.

And the question appeared in my mind:
What is that, which you are afraid to loose?
There was no pain.
There was no suffering.
There was nothing yet.

And realization came:
All you have to loose is your own identity.
The sense that you are something to be lost."

Once this term is used inappropriately, The Diamond Sword comes into power, and it knows no mercy.

Every single individual, using the title Mahasattva, given to them by Osho, is to immediately stop using it.

There is no and can not possibly be any compromise on that.

What they are essentially saying by it:
These are not people. They are animals. Do not ever even attempt to help them ""they will step on it"".

""They get EXACTLY what they deserve, being the pigs they are.

Just about ALL you can do is to screw them. Screw them for your own benefits and never ever even bother with the consequences of it.""

And, seeing some of what some of you are doing and thinking, the argument is compelling.

Now...

I just came across the Koran singing. What a beauty! I did come across it a couple of times in my life in passing. It immediately struck me as something of a divine beauty. But I was not interested enough at that time to dedicate any of my energy to it.

And now I am listening to it as I write this and what I sense is that if I write the music to this singing and you are not entirely dead, your sculls would crack. Such and immense power and beauty it sounds to me.

It is very unfortunate that Muhammad's followers are so profoundly fanatic, intolerant and violent. Because their musical tradition of Koran singing it is so profoundly beautiful, that it can easily bring you to your senses and place yourself into the proper perspective in the ""scheme of things"".

One interesting thing is them being utterly against any kind of imagery of ""god"" as they claim those are just images of evil. Nothing more. God is so grand, no image can possibly even begin to describe it.

I bet if they were less violent, intolerant and fanatic, what they have is a tremendous contribution to keeping the man sane and understanding his place in this grand existence."

I do not know why or how you got interested in all this ""religious"" bullshit. There must be a reason for it. But, and pay attention to it, you won't get the benefits out of all those carrots they will show you.

They are just taking care of their own skin, just like anything else in this world.

But with music, they can not zombify you. They can only show you the real beauty, the beauty of creativity and ecstasy of life.

To me, it is thousand times more healthful, then what you are likely to find with all these ""masters"".

Yes, you do need to ""travel the path"". You will definitely learn plenty of things from Chandra Mohan, mostly about cunningness of this world. And he did do mountains of investigations and was able to gather quite a few jewels on his way.

But...

Once you ""travel the path"" long enough, you are simply bound to see what an idiot you were not to be able to appreciate, enjoy and utilize the Life directly, without the assistance of some crutch.

This man was no just his bully on darshans to keep away the crazies from the ""holy master"". Nope. He was truly his closest person in terms of security and his very life. There wasn't anyone closer.

Who do you trust not only to be your guard, but even your car driver, if were in his position?

And, after all those years of dedicated service, helping to build the security force, train the people and do all sorts of things, he was simply thrown out like a used condom and for no reason at all it seems.

Well, there WAS actually a reason, the MAIN reason by far, as far as I can see. And that reason was this man knows too much, being all those years with him.

And so, when the whole concentration camp moved to Oregon, there was a need for ""fresh blood"", ""fresh start"", trying to forever avoid leaving too many traces behind. There was absolutely no need to get rid of his most trusted guard. First of all, it was utterly stupid and could only backfire if anything, which it did.

And so it goes with many other people in all sorts of situation. This nothing more than a paranoia of a suicidal criminal mind that knows that it will eventually catch up with him, and it did."
,veerenski,2010-10-14T07:01Z,"At the end of his life, Chandra Mohan basically became totally insane with his paranoia.

When he ordered some people to leave the ""meditation hall"" during one of his lectures, because he thought someone is sending ""death rays"" on him, it was the end of him UTTER end. He discredited himself by this single example more than with anything else.

This uncontrollable paranoia of a megalomaniac was the best example of who this man truly was.

You see, WHO in his clear mind would even bother ""sending death rays"" on him? For what? He was finished long time ago, in Oregon. From then on, vast majority of ""his people"" simply turned their backs on him, including his most ""powerful"" and respectable ""therapists"", ""group leaders"" and other ""elite"". Because the whole thing was simply beyond disgust.

He was utterly and profoundly uninteresting to anyone on any kind of level of significance. There was no need to kill him for any reason. He was basically nobody in the scheme of things.

Even if some powers wanted to kill him, there is absolutely nothing he could do with all his ""powers"" of ""all seeing eye"".

There are much more potent psychotronic weapons available. It could be done via many things, including but limited via his phone, without even bugging it, and via many different things he inevitably had to have. There are so many ways to kill someone with modern technologies, you can not even begin to imagine.

Nope. At the end, he was just a pathetic delusional lunatic. Just this ""mystic rose"" ""meditation"" is an evidence of it. It is probably the most disgusting and most perverted form of total mind control and zombification, on the level of literal insanity."

Sorry, I can not help with this because I do not know where she is right now. Have mercy on me, willya?"
,veerenski,2010-10-16T19:40Z,"I do not want to hear this again.
OK?

I was told there are discussions of me being ""enlightened"".

What is this?

Did I ever told you such a thing?
What are you talking about in those forums?
I have no interests whatsoever to see what you are talking about, even if you are talking about me. You do as you wish.

And I don't want to hear what I have heard:
""Please be my master"".

Brrr...

How many times do I have to repeat:
YOU are the only master there is.

This whole existence if for you, and you only.
It was custom built for you. Not me.

Yes, you CAN ask me questions.
But don't suck on my tities.
I will answer it unless you are simply insane.

But that is about ALL you get from me.

I do not accept any ""disciples"".
I do not know what ""enlightenment"" is.
And I will kick your ass as hard as it gets, if I see you bragging on your knees.

Clear enough?"
,veerenski,2010-10-16T19:42Z,"""BEGGING"", not ""bragging"" that was.

:-)

Cool."
,veerenski,2010-10-16T19:47Z,"Cool.

Nice subject.

""Bragging"" vs. ""begging"".

Can you brag on your knees?
I bet you can.
How?
But why are on your knees?
Well, seems to me you want to show that you are ""special"". All others are just ""mortals"". They can not understand teh ""real deal"". But YOU can!

And so you fall on your knees, denying yourselves and your own validity.

For what?

Well, just to brag about how ""great"" you are.

Do you see this?

Or we need to chew on this?

And we are talking about KINGS of this world."
,veerenski,2010-10-17T03:49Z,"I do not believe my own eyes.

Looks like YOU are really looking for someone to zombify you. Is it some kind of a ""kick"" from some drug for you?

Why do you need to be biorobots or zombies?

Does it feel more ""comfortable"" that way?
So you do not have to make your own decisions?

You want someone to tell you who is who and what is what?

You mean you do not have your own mind?

You mean you do not have your own eyes to see and ears to hear?

What are you PRETENDING to be?

These are all lies. You are not that and can not possibly be, even in principle.

Ok, I understand, everybody like to hear some cool stories because it is lulling, you feel like a baby in your mother's hands. You can relax and go back to state of eternal sleep, from where you came as you think.

NO!!!

You are HERE!
You can not avoid life!
You can not avoid yourselves.

Because it is simply an impossibility..."
,veerenski,2010-10-17T06:29Z,"What is the need to waste your life on some forum?

Do you think by TALKING about and about and about you get to ANY place, worth even mentioning?

Oh, you have some ""problem""?

Ok, fine. But listen to this carefully.

The Systems Approach to Solving Problems:

So... You have some problem. Something does not work, no matter what you do. You have spend several sleepless days trying to solve it. But nothing works!

So... What do you do?
Is THAT the question?

Well, simple.
What you do is CHANGE something. Does not matter what it is. And see what it does to your system, or life situation. If nothing happens, change something else.

And I guarantee you, putting all my PRACTICAL experience in about the most sophisticated systems you can find, very soon you will see what was that nasty thing that caused your system not to work.

And you can apply this approach to ANYTHING in your life, no matter what it is.

I am not in the mood to tell you more, even though it is sitting on the tip of my tongue."
,veerenski,2010-10-18T16:12Z,"The story of a Jew:

I have to put this down for the record, just for me to remember and not to forget what remains to be covered.

Now, just it happens in life all the time, today I walked by one of street musicians. He is an old Jew, and he knows it all ""in and out"". And the sense of humor he has is sufficient to place a guy like him into the Louvre museum, so grand it is.

And so I pass buy, and he starts playing exactly the kind of music I like. Because he saw me passing by and we are kinda ""old friends"". Not exactly, but close enough.

So, I decide to give him a little bit of money. So, I stop by and we start chatting while he is playing. Beautiful things, full of joy with some of that famous ""Jewish suffering"" thrown in.

So, to make a long story short, as conversation comes to its peak, he, being a Jew, asks me:

""But you would never sell others, don't you""?

And I answer:

""There is not enough money in this world to sell someone I respect"".

Deep?

So, watch it now..."

Simple:

When you come across some genuine piece of art, music, or ANY form of creativity, for that matter, be it cleaning toilets is this:

Before you encounter it, you are one man.
But once you encounter it, you are a different being.

Simple, isn't it?

And yes, there is not enough money in this world to make me play when I do not feel like playing. No matter what."

I´m currently not in any country with decently fast download speed.
I am downloading this at 40KBs, and judging for the size of the torrent, it won´t be done very soon.
It would be beautiful if this material was more widely available."
