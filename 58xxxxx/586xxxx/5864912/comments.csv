what could be the problem?"
,ninjaracoon,2010-10-04T07:00Z,"to download the VIDEO SAMPLE, just remove the spaces between the letters in the link provided:)"
,ozc,2010-10-04T16:09Z,"---------------------------------------------------

2 hour 1080 movies should be 8 gigabytes or more.
2 hour 720 movies should be 4 gigabytes or more.

Anything less than this is not a proper rip and is degraded. (excluding anime)

,ninjaracoon,2010-10-05T02:36Z,"@ozc-
 you obviously didnt compare my rip to other 4GB+ rips first before saying anything with no PROOF..


"
,ninjaracoon,2010-10-05T02:52Z,"You cant just backup your claims with words, people need Proof. 

so I always give screenshots, sample and comparison 

I never put words like ""excellent quality!!"" or ""this is the best quality"" crap in any of my torrent.

:)"
,ninjaracoon,2010-10-05T03:23Z,"@ozc -degraded? here is another comparison
-WiKi scene release

If you say that this is just a cherrypicked frame, then you should make your own comparison that will prove your claims"
,ninjaracoon,2010-10-06T05:45Z,"""2 hour 1080 movies should be 8 gigabytes or more.

This is true for transparent encodes only like WiKi releases and if you want to preserve film grain(but slightly blurry).

but I prefer a cleaner, grain free and sharper look than transparency. 

@scare_crow - thanks"
,ninjaracoon,2010-10-08T04:28Z,@scare_crow - my source is the 720p WiKi version which is a proper bluray rip.
