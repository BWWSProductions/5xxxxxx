9/11: Press for Truth (Video 2006)

This is an incredibly well-researched and detailed documentary. Paul Thompson has done an amazing job outlining the events that preceded and followed 9/11. This is not a propaganda piece, however it does focus on the efforts of the families of the 9/11 victims to uncover the truth about that fateful day. The Bush administration and the American mainstream media do not fare well in this analysis. I felt as though I was watching Thompson try to put together a jigsaw puzzle made up of a million tiny pieces, scattered all over the globe. Many of the details he has uncovered are completely unknown to most Americans. I found myself moved at times nearly to tears, and at other times driven to anger. Not only do I recommend this documentary, I intend to buy my own copy and show it to anyone who will watch!
