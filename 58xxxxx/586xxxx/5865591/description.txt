
John Bevere - Driven By Eternity 1 - 12 (DivX)

Bestselling author John Bevere delivers compelling principles on how to live with hope and assurance that will carry you through to eternity. Most people would be left destitute if they planned their retirement as carelessly as they've prepared for eternity. Drawing on the principles in 2 Corinthians 5:9-11, John Bevere reminds us that all believers will stand before God and receive what they have earned in life. In building their lives to be ready for that day, and maintaining an eternal frame of reference, readers will develop significant lives. In keeping sight of the goal, readers will learn to labor for rewards that endure--for timeless eternity.
