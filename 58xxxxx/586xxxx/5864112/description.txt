This is one of the best 80's synth-pop albums, filled to the brim with catchy hooks.  "Always Something There to Remind Me" was a fun radio-play cover song, but there's so much more -- the loopy "When The Lights Go Out", the poignant "I Could Show You How", and especially the absolutely beautiful "Promises, Promises", A Very Hard Act To Follow and Fortune and Fame. 

If you don't like 80's synth-pop, then forget about it.  But if you do -- this is the good stuff.
