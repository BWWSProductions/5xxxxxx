@uploader Sir ,

,xavier669,2010-10-07T09:01Z,"Thanks for all the keys - been using them for a long time.  KIS just updated, and now there is no longer the option to use a key file.  Is there another patch available or on the way?  Or would the old one still work?"
,xavier669,2010-10-07T09:09Z,"Hey again - nevermind.  Went through the text files directions both methods step by step, and the 2nd way worked.  Must have missed a step the first time.  Thanks."

,heavydiamond,2010-10-08T10:13Z,blacklisted again aswell
,Rumour,2010-10-10T12:45Z,"Guys, you need to get off the ""oh my key has been blacklisted, I need another one"" wheel.

This is what you do. Install a working key. Turn off automatic updates. Go to settings, and then notifications settings. Turn off notifications for ""out of date database"" and ""obsolete database"". Keep the key for 1-2 months before replacing.

Kaspersky still fully works if the database is not out of date or obsolete (i.e. very out of date). 

Remember you don't need to update Kaspersky or any antivirus software daily. This is a myth the company wants you to buy into for business. Most of all the important/main virus definitions are in the database already. I only update once every 4-6 weeks, or if I read on antivirus forums that there is a new type of virus out.

*** Peace ***"
