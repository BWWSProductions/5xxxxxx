What happened to you guys?

50 minutes ago, I started downloading this torrent.  

So far, I've downloaded 0.0%  There's only one seeder, and I can't even connect to that single seeder.  I've got 148 peers connected to me, and they all have 0.0%

You guys used to rock.  Some of your torrents are still up to par, but more often than not, I get these duds.

What's up with that?"
