,Mcluvin75,2010-10-09T16:40Z,I can`t get any of your downloads to work.  I have been using Wii download manager for 6 months plus but I can`t transfer your wbfs files to the downloader.  Please help. 
[V],r3dcat,2010-10-11T10:39Z,"@Mcluvin75: I am a little confused ... what is ""Wii download manager"" ??? ... and again I am not sure what you mean by ""transfer wbfs files to the downloader"" ??? ... How are you playing your games? off disc or off WBFS partition? ... It sounds like you might be using a WBFS partion in which case download and use ""Wii Backup Manager"" to add the .wbfs file to your partition just like you would add normally an .iso ... Make sure you use the ""Wii Backup Manager"" listed in the description above because not all Wii backup/file managers support the .wbfs file format!"
,Mcluvin75,2010-10-12T14:07Z,Not that anyone got back to me on this I don`t know piratebay sheesh!!!!  These torrents only work with Wii bak up manager I was using WBFS manager.  Stupidos
