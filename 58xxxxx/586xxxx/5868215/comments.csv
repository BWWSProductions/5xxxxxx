Thanks...."
[T],Bigjazz.h33t,2010-10-08T15:07Z,"@mike18xx (and to anyone else who's wondering :))

Vol 10 (which contains the last 4 ep's) is due to be released early November (November 3rd, if I remember correctly)."
,mike18xx,2010-10-11T07:54Z,"Thanks.

(What I'd really love is the entire series done over at 640x480 and 350mb file size with 192 LAME DPLII audio, with a decent deblocking string to fix the weak DVD master artifacts. ...this toon looks mediocre at best on any decent display. Overall I'd give the 233mb 576 widths a B+ versus the C_P 175mb versions an F for perma-fail-you-guys-always_suck.)"
,mike18xx,2010-10-11T07:57Z,"BTW, where do you live, Bigjazz?

I notice you're ripping PAL DVDs."
,tyga-lyons,2010-10-12T07:18Z,"@Bigjazz - Thank you for the episodes! The quality is definitely an 'A'. Forget what anyone else says.

@mike18xx - What i'd really love to see is your versions of these episodes. If you want things done 'right', then maybe you should do them yourself? Let me know when your encodes will be made available. Also I couldn't help but notice that you and Honeyko SEEM to be the same person? If that's the case, then I should probably let you know that your Pinky & The Brain dvdrips are crap, and maybe you should follow your own advice? Danny Phantom tv caps are decent but you should have really used lower aWarpSharp settings since the TV-rating logo isn't even a square on your rips (distorted). Why are you bashing cp encodes? At least they play nicely on my divx player, which is more than i can say about your Ben 10 rips, oh wait, they don't exist! AT also released these episodes, go get theirs. CW and Cp release stuff every f*ing week to the public and not keep it to themselves and their 'friends' on IRC. You're an elitist a$&hole who believes that he/she can do everything better but never does it. You've been doing this for years and you still suck. Btw who cares what this toon looks like on your hd display? it's a dvdrip not bluray, encoded using xvid at relatively low bitrates instead of x264. So just stop the crap! Hell, not everyone can afford an HD display. People do have better things to spend their hard earned money on like tuition, family, bills, etc. Whatever though, you can't change the way someone thinks. 

Again thank you very much Bigjazz for taking time from your schedule to encode and upload these an many more! I'm sure I speak for a lot of people when I say you're like a Robin Hood to us. "
,mike18xx,2010-10-13T06:11Z,"Hey tyga, little miss trouble-stirrer, didja notice the multiple ""Thanks..."" I wrote? Yeah; it's in there. Notice the -1 rating on this torrent? Oh, right; there isn't one.

Pay attention; me and Bigjazz are getting along just fine. Just two guys talkin' stuff.

Regards those other torrent: most of 'em are five years old and scavenged from horrid original sources (such as analog TV piped into a crappy capture card) YEARS before the DVDs were released -- you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. You thing the Danny Phantoms are bad? You should have seen the sources: the fuckin' things needed cropping on all four sides.

C_P? I slam them because they've sucked continuously and consistently since the first day they arrived on the scene -- their quality is so hideous that I'd rather not watch a show until someone else has put it out....but once C_Ps are out, they ""poison"" the desire of those other someones to go through the trouble. 640x480 175mb with monster block artifacts are a fucking joke in 2010 when you can buy a semi full of DVD5 blanks for a nickel, and most people have broadband now -- there's no reason for them to be issuing hideous quality rips half a decade after Moonsong showed 'em how to do it right.
"
,mike18xx,2010-10-13T06:14Z,"High-def? C_Ps look like crap on a 15"" CRT with blurry pixels.

Bigjazz' rips are an order-of-magnitude improvement.

x264? I didn't mention anything about that. 350mb is plenty good enough for full 640x480 XviD AVIs.

IRC and ""hoarding""? I was slamming it and promoting DHT public torrenting probably before you ever heard of either one of them.

DIVX player? Who the hell uses that? ...get VLC; it plays almost everything in one tidy little cross-platform package with self-contained decoders.

Regards the Ben10 rips; I will release a retimed 23.976fps full three-season torrent of B10:AF when the last DVD is released. Not only will Bigjazz be credited with ripping, but the NFO file for the torrent will contain instructions for retiming ""tinny"" PAL rips without re-encoding the video -- which means that EVERYONE can go through their entire collections and retime their tinny 25fps US and Japanese rips to proper NTSC 23.976."
