[V],ExtraTorrentRG,2010-10-04T00:02Z,"this seems to an issue as far as audio is concerned

I have also experienced problems with audio for this torrent .... I thought I might have changed settings for audio rate in VLC at first but media player and others did the same. A shame really, the video quality is a 10/10! Looks like a good movie too, just didn't wanna spoil it with audio issues. :(

Thank you for/to the uploader for the effort
 tho.  :)  :)"
