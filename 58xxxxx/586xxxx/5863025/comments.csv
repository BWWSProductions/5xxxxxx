,magfibre,2010-10-24T07:07Z,I am curious to see the code that goes into the loader executable. We don't know what else is being installed with the exe.
[V],DeGun,2010-11-03T10:20Z,"Magfibre - the exe is infecting your computer so i suggest you buy 7 and you dont come here to get a crack that will destroy and burn all your computer components :) 

All other : 3NJ0Y your genuine windows seven

No customers services though "

Cheers!"
,mercutzio14,2011-07-20T19:04Z,"first, i must say that my copy of windows was genuine as it was installed on my PC the day i have bought it but it had only a 30 days trial period.so.....after it has expired i used Remove WAT 2.2.5.1 to activate it but of course i forgot to select not to update it. it worked for about one year with all the updates up until it updated with the ""famous"" KB971033. after i discovered that this was the reason for the ""This copy of Windows is not genuine"" watermark i uninstalled it (i mean that update KB971033) and right after that i dld this torrent and i used the new Wat Remover 2.2.6 and then Watermark 0.8. IT WORKED AS A CHARM! so you really should TRUST THIS ONE without minding your head with other stupid ways of dealing this problem that you can find on the internet of which i've learned before using THIS GEM. :)"
,cutechicinawhiteT,2011-07-23T17:10Z,"Anyone just recently have issues with their system? My watermark just showed up at 9 am this morning out of the blue and I had not updated in a while. Strange.

But, than you DeGun, I am sure this will work for me like it did a 6-months ago. smiley face"
,ryehoon75,2011-07-24T13:09Z,"You are the man! Thanks so much for this. AVG gave me a false positive on RemoveWAT.exe, but I installed it anyway and it worked perfectly! Re-scanned my system afterward and no threats detected! Thanx ALOT!"
,Conin,2011-07-25T03:24Z,"The title says: ""7 Loader 1.9.2..."" but the genuine 7 Loader 1.9.x is NOT included, there's another file instead."
,1coolguy1,2011-09-05T19:34Z,THANK YOU REMOVE WATT FINALLY WORKED ON MY INSPIRON 1720 LAPTOP!!!! I TRIED EVERYTHING! :) I will check back if I have any problems in the future with the damn updater.
