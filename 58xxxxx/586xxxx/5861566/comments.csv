Please bear in mind that all three parts of this Trilogy are being uploaded at the same time, so they will be slow.

If you want the other two parts, they can be found here:

Part I http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5861567
Part III http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5861565

Enjoy...

@trolkan

As you are the expert, where are you uploads?

Tell me that the bitrate is too low once you have watched the movie, not before you have downloaded it, otherwise that just makes you a TROLL.. kan ;o)"
,ApeX_95,2011-04-26T12:03Z,"Great upload. Amazing quality. Please keep up the good work. Quick question, I realize this will be borderline noob, where are the subs located. I've found the movie and it plays amazingly on my laptop, I just can't seem to find the subs. thanks again"
,eagleh17,2011-07-07T15:45Z,There are no subtitles for this. 
,eagleh17,2011-07-07T15:53Z,my bad i had to enable it on the player. note to other users.
,magnus_lo,2011-08-13T23:40Z,"When I try to activate the English subtitles on VLC, it doesn't work. There are two in English and one in Hrvatski, niether of them work. Any suggestions?"
,rosstitute,2012-02-06T14:38Z,"I'd like to raise the same query as magnus_lo, the subs show in the menu of VLC but don't appear when selected."
