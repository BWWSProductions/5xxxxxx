"Excellence in Broadcasting"

When Brian learns that Rush Limbaugh (guest
-voicing as himself) is going to be at the 
Quahog Mall for a book-signing, he decides 
to go down there and give him a piece of 
his left-wing mind. But when Rush 
unexpectedly comes to Brian's rescue, Brian 
has a political change of heart.

Enjoy :)
