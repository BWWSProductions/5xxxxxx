Broadcast on BBC One, 10:35pm Mon, 13th Sep 2010(Already shown)


A dangerous police chase through the streets of Swansea in the middle of the afternoon ends in carnage; to the surprise of the traffic cops the driver pulled out of the wreckage of the crashed stolen car is a woman.

Meanwhile, a game of cat and mouse ensues in the Welsh valleys, with PC Stanley Baxter having to break down community barriers - and break down doors - in search of his elusive prey.
