Read Notes:
A message to COMPLIANT crew
Your release "The.A-Team.2010.MULTI.PROPER.PAL.DVDR-COMPLIANT" is encoded from STOLEN P2P DVD9 releaseout sept 27th TWO DAYS before your funny release.
Our release "The.A-Team.2010.PAL.DVDR-iLG" is encoded from own source, the same we use to encode the
"The.A-Team.2010.DVDRip.XviD-iLG" out BEFORE all P2P releases (yes offcourse because we have our OWN source)

clap clap clap clap for your FUNNY NFO where you had the courage to write a BIG lie accusing us to steal from
P2P when "YOU" are the p2p thief.

Nukenets site op do more attention when you add guys, a nuker "told a lie" for three times
first nuke "another.p2p.release" (accusing iLG without proofs)
second nuke (after first unnuke) "audio.not fully.removed" a big lie, because made "without" having even tried the DVD on his player 
(perfectly authored) third nuke, same nuke of before producing incomplete, false and incorrect proof.... (DVD menu audio stripped is NOT 
(We repeat NOT) clickable as nuker means with nuke (proof that he NEVER tried to do, and it is scandalous that has been allowed to do the nuke)    

Only lately, final NUKE was for the only right reason (UNDERSIZED, funny but right... read the story about it on tinypics); 
but only after three unnuke proofing that nuker "was a liar" (and this is something very serious)      

Dear COMPLIANT (alias and false crew) clap clap for this "very nice message for scene"...  
your satisfation is our enjoy.
