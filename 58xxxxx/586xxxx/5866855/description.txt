Steve and Becky are Him & Her â€“ a young couple deeply in love, often in bed and rarely in employment.

Content to commit days on end to little more than eating, drinking and lazing around the pair are happy just to exist, doing their best to avoid the world beyond their flat and only occasionally letting life find them at home to visitors.

Him & Her is an anti-romantic comedy. It lifts the lid on love as it really is - warts and all with farts, bickering and toast.
