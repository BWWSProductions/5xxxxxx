I was looking for this CD for a very long time until I found CD at my house after 2 years of seeking.
Note: on 2nd track (Solo se vive una vez), there's silence between 0:10-0:13 (CD is damaged a little bit), but other songs should be normal. Report if you find artifacts anywhere else :)

BTW my upload speed is about 25-35 kB/s so please be patient!
More the people who seed, better the download speed!
So, please don't just download and click that big red STOP button, seed it for some time!
