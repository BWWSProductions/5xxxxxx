There seems to be a lack lossless Dan Fogelberg torrents.


I found this rare 4 CD boxed set contained in another discography torrent, and it provides an in-depth overview of Dan's excellent music. The original files are are ape. Upon extracting them I noted the original ripper named the individual CD's a little differently than in the boxed set but it is not really a problem. The Apple Lossless conversions are also included for the convenience of people like me, Apple users.  The boxed set has apparently been out of print for quite a while and if you can find it new, it runs over $240. 

Dan Fogelberg is one of those few songwriters that can blend great lyrics with wonderful music. His songs don't just tell a story they paint a picture. Although he's known for his top 40 hits he never compromised his standards when writing and producing his albums. This box set gives the listener a great feel of how his music progressed though the years.
