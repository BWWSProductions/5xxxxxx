Drummer Jim Vallance and Bruce Fairbairn had a jazz rock band named Sunshyne. They incorporated Lindsey Mitchell and Ron Tabak, and switched names to â€œUnder Constructionâ€ (also briefly â€œStanley Screamerâ€). Then, when John Hall was brought in as keyboardist, the bandâ€™s name became Prism. (See their official website at http://www.prism.ca/.)

After signing with GRT Records, they released their debut album with a lineup of Tabak, Mitchell, Lavin, Hall, Ab Bryant and Jim Vallance, who both produced, and played drums under the name of â€œRodney Higgs.â€ Vallance did not want to tour though, so left and was replaced by Rocket Norton.

In 1977, they released their self-titled album PRISM, and it had a hit with â€œSpaceship Superstarâ€. The band subsequently issued See Forever Eyes (1978), after which Bryant left, and Allen Harlow was brought in as a new guitarist.

Armageddon (was released in 1979), featuring some compositional input from the then largely unknown Bryan Adams, and Young and Restless was released in 1980.

After the greatest hits album All the Best From Prism, Prism signed on with Capitol Records and after a few more lineup changes (Mitchell and Harlow went their separate ways, Tabak was fired due to â€œlifestyleâ€ issues), and vocalist Henry Small was brought in), they released Small Change (1981). The lead single â€œDonâ€™t Let Him Knowâ€ became their first top 40 hit in America and the follow-up â€œTurn on Your Radarâ€ also charted, becoming their fifth and final American hit.

The band broke up in 1982 but Beat Street followed in 1983 featuring Henry Small, Bill Champlin, Richie Zito, Mike Baird (drummer from Journey), and backup vocalists Bobby Kimball (Toto) and Alan Pasqua.

Plans for a Prism reunion with Tabak were cancelled when he died on 25 December 1984, one day after a brain hemorrhage he suffered from a cycling accident.

In 1988 they reformed for another greatest hits album called Over 60 Minutes withâ€¦Prism, and five years later another new album, Jericho (1993), with Darcy Deutsch as vocalist, Harlow, Mitchell, Norton, and keyboardist Andy Lorimer. Deutsche. Studio musicians included Bryan Adams, Paul Janz, Mark LaFrance, with Rick Springfield doing some of the songwriting.

The band has continued to tour, and is expected to release a new album Big Black Sky in 2008"

For instance, Al Harlow was part of Prism for the album See Forever Eyes, playing bass & guitar. Also, both Harlow and Mitchell were still part of the group when Small Change was released.
The band did indeed release a new album entitles Black Sky with Harlow now on lead vocals."
