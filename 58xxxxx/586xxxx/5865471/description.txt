Product Description
After September 11, 2001, the FBI started collecting small, easily concealed knives and other potentially lethal objects, and compiled a catalog that has been distributed to airport screeners and law enforcement agencies across the country. In The FBI Guide to Concealable Weapons, this information is available to every citizen who wants to be prepared to face future terrorist attacks. In this exclusive reprint, you will see metal, plastic and ceramic knives hidden in pens, keys, belt buckles, jewelry, canes and cigarette lighters, as well as impact weapons disguised as keychains, and items hollowed out for the possible concealment of explosives. As citizens responsible for our own safety, we must know everything possible about the dangers that face us, and awareness is the first, vital step in this direction.
