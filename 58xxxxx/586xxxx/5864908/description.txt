From BrillianceAudio:

In this mesmerizing, funny, chilling novel, the setting is a small town in the 
1940s Midwest, the subject the heart of a wounded and ferociously moralistic 
young woman, one of those implacable American moralists whose â€œgoodnessâ€ is a 
terrible disease. When she was still a child, Lucy Nelson had her alcoholic 
failure of a father thrown in jail. Ever since then she has been trying to 
reform the men around her, even if that ultimately means destroying herself in 
the process. With his unerring portraits of Lucy and her hapless, childlike 
husband, Roy, Roth has created an uncompromising work of fictional realism, a 
vision of provincial American piety, yearning, and discontent that is at once 
pitiless and compassionate. 

From Wiki:

...While at Chicago, Roth met the novelist Saul Bellow, as well as Margaret 
Martinson, who became his first wife. Their separation in 1963, along with 
Martinson's death in a car crash in 1968, left a lasting mark on Roth's 
literary output. Specifically, Martinson was the inspiration for female 
characters in several of Roth's novels, including Lucy Nelson in When She Was 
Good, and Maureen Tarnopol in My Life As a Man
