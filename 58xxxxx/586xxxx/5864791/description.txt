       2/6 - India
       Karl Pilkington arrives in India, where he attends the Holi, a 
       spring festival in which people throw coloured dye at one another, 
       and takes an eight-hour bus ride to see holy men known as `the 
       babas'. He also joins a saint to cleanse his soul in the river 
       Ganges, before paying a visit to the Taj Mahal.
