,RooJo434,2010-11-03T17:31Z,"thank you so much, i am so grateful for this film, this isn't even out on blu ray so this is a golden find, i love your rips they are the best i've ever seen, and if you could possibly upload the 2nd and 3rd austin powers movies i'd be so happy"
,ScottyBox,2010-12-03T10:59Z,"The screen refresh rate is a little too slow for my computer, so it looks really choppy. BUT, GREAT quality. Next time, please try to set the fps to something greater than 24.5. Thanks!"
,ultimagic,2010-12-07T12:02Z,"this is a very good quality but i am very sure that this is not brrip. it hasn't released yet.
by the way. thanks!"
,Brat001,2010-12-10T17:29Z,decent quality but mislabeled. the abc logo and age rating are on the screen so it's not actually bluray. it's an hdtv rip
,dthompson2692,2010-12-12T11:18Z,"the quality of this is great and all and i give it a 10/10 for both audio and video, but its a tv recording so the movie breaks for commercials even though the commercials aren't in the movie."
,wickedspade4,2011-02-26T04:37Z,Thank you..download in 2 min very fast
,rahkmo,2011-03-21T19:18Z,Thanks Prashant! Great Upload!
,khan_sana,2011-05-09T21:11Z,Thanks
,neanderthal88,2011-05-11T16:58Z,this was the first movie i have ever seen on theatre. dont really know how to thank...
,Jkiddy,2011-05-25T08:10Z,Hey. This is the special edition so it DOES have songs which were not in the original version.. 
,alaea812,2011-06-04T02:27Z,"Don't like the added song.  Want the original.  Didn't even know that had other versions!  Otherwise, good file and download."
,MasterXelcas,2011-06-20T19:28Z,"hey thanks man, i wouldnt mind lion king 2 as well, tell me if you upload it. This is my fav disney film... couldnt find it ANYWHERE cause they put it in the disney vault. Thanks a lot, will seed as long as possible (though with 644 seeders you dont need my help lol)"
,-Ronin-,2011-06-22T10:08Z,Cheers prashant22! Thx
,medikonroids,2011-07-05T08:57Z,"A:4 (very low i could hardly hear it with full volume on)
V:8 (good for such an old movie)
downloaded this movie in about 10 mins, good
highly recomend if you have good sound but if your volume cant go high you might not be able to hear much..."
,mmsemple,2011-08-08T23:43Z,"Thanks so much, it can be so hard to find Disney movies and when you do they can be way too expensive. 

V:10
A:9 (it may be a little low, but it's not choppy and aligns great with the picture)"
,mmsemple,2011-08-08T23:43Z,And I didn't have to play around with changing the file type to get it to stream on my PS3! THANKS!
,Kakarot69,2011-09-06T06:20Z,this is crap u burn it to disc and the file skips constantly 
,TheCwi,2011-09-24T12:20Z,Good copy and in only 10 minutes
,vidiation,2011-09-30T22:56Z,"Nice, clear copy, but NOT/NOT a BRRip - TvG rating logo and then the ABC bug/logo in lower right corner for entire movie.  Overall great UL, aside from mis-labeling. Thanks to ULer."
,ghostkernel,2011-11-04T08:13Z,"GREAT 720p HD quality,definitely not bluray A10 V9 M10"
,KirkH420,2011-11-12T23:46Z,"The torrent is real and it is good quality with Subtitles soft-coded. However, it does have the CBS logo on the bottom right hand corner so I doubt it is a Blueray, it is probably a DVR copy."
,KirkH420,2011-11-12T23:47Z,... ment to say ABC logo

,GumbiGum1,2011-12-30T05:31Z,great quality. a little pixelation at times but sweet 95% of the time. 8.5 / 10
,pirataki,2012-01-12T14:26Z,"subtitle font name SOMEONE PLEASE!!!!

,Amy219,2012-03-03T00:14Z,"y has the torrent link dissapeared, cannot download anything"
