,techlover15,2010-10-04T13:33Z,i didnt see any serial number in the nfo file...just a bunch of 0's and a little bit explaining about photomatix
,Clortho,2010-10-06T20:10Z,"@techlover15: The serial is in the .nfo file and it works perfectly, here it is if you still can't find it: 445X-6694-7R9Q-KK9C-57YG"
,tapper101,2010-10-14T04:37Z,"You might wanna include a HOW TO INSTALL description in the nfo.............. all I see is a couple of file types I've never seen before, can't open them with WinZip/WinRar/7-zip and I can't mount them with Daemon Tools, what the hell am I supposed to do with them?"
,inca-81,2010-10-16T20:12Z,"Works great, excellent piece of software"
[M],SteRipper,2010-10-21T06:09Z,"I love you Stun, And I want to have your babies. Thanks for uploading this."
,jesusxenu,2010-11-12T12:03Z,The serial is the only thing you need. go to the official site for installers.
,Barroquecore,2010-11-29T07:08Z,"Worked excellent for me. Seems unfair that it has a -13 for quality. If you don't know how to extract it's not the uploader's fault. Also, the license key IS in the .nfo file, though it might get a little confusing because there's a bunch of characters for a signature or something I guess. Thanks."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-01-15T20:46Z,Downloaded Photomatix 4.0.2 From Official Website and used Serial in Comments - Worked 100% - You Are Awesome - Thank you for helping out we poor photographer :D
,mcbeno,2011-02-14T07:23Z,"@ mrdowntown-
i follow your comment and got mine perfectly!! thanks too stun and mrdowntown"
,stevenpamolo,2011-02-20T07:40Z,You da man. Works perfectly. May your trade routes prosper
,stevenpamolo,2011-02-20T07:45Z,"Danm, I clicked the  - instead of the +. This softwate should be +15"
,leefx,2011-03-18T16:45Z,"Thank you Stun.
I needed this for my college Photoshop class... that extra 99bucks really helps when you're a poor college student!"
,kourtneeeey,2011-04-09T17:24Z,"That was actually like the easiest, fastest download I've ever encountered on this site with the exception of mp3 files... I don't know why everyone is crying about it being difficult lol... I downloaded, installed and registered in about 6 minutes. Now I'm going to bracket some photos. Thanks Stun!"
,footron,2011-04-20T00:12Z,"i received a ""corrupt file"" error when trying to unzip this..."
,quebec101,2011-04-20T18:46Z,"thank you, very easy to figure the install, works fine"
,djanarak,2011-04-21T05:59Z,"Thanks for the serial number, but extracting the archives doesn't work. For a 6mb installer, why even bother splitting it into two archives? Like someone else pointed out, all you need is the registration key. Just download the installer from the developer's website."
,TomBrooklyn,2011-04-28T13:21Z,rar extracts to a zip.  can't unzip zip file.   it says maybe a password is required.   this simply doesn't work for me. 
,mtp234,2011-05-25T19:15Z,Wow this is brilliant thank you so much for the serial number. I was already using the trial version so I just put the serial key in at the beginning when it said 'register' and bingo worked there and then. Cheers!!!! :)
,brajpop,2011-05-31T18:12Z,"Wow, by far the worst explained installation process ever. Can't unzip the files that are already in the zip files, can't do anything with them. You geeks acting like EVERYONE should know how..."
,kevont2000,2011-07-10T05:10Z,Downloaded Photomatix 4.0.2 From Official Website and used Serial in Comments (445X-6694-7R9Q-KK9C-57YG) - Worked 100%...!!
,vbtoons,2011-07-14T21:14Z,Thumbs up!!!
,gg2008,2011-08-01T20:18Z,@kevont2000   your serial worked thanks a lot!!!
,iiiratep,2011-08-19T03:34Z,"That was the lamest archiving job ever. Installer was buried several layers deep, and not a single KB was shaved off.

Nonetheless... great upload. Thanks."
,neuroxik,2011-08-22T06:46Z,"To those whining about such a small filesize being split into 2 parts, I myself usually split it in even more pieces for the simple reason that most AntiVirus software automatically quarantine or delete most keygens and cracks as False-Positives, so this way, you can have more control (add PUP exceptions temporarily or what you like), without losing the backup file."
