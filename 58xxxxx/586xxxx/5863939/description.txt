During the 'Meat Loaf and Friends Summer Tour' Meat had some great shows with plenty of interaction with the crowd. And more important, he had a great strong voice.

This is one of those shows and it was taped on November 29, 2002

This is an audience recording!
If you look for a picture perfect quality or high quality sound I will tell you to skip this. The picture is blurry and shot from a distance, so no sharp outlines from the face. The sound is hissy and noisy, but still you can hear everything well enough. If you want to be entertained foor 100 minutes by Meat and the Neverland Express, this is a must-have show.
