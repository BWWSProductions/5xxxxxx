Documentary about Jimi Hendrix's four sensational years in London told by those who
knew him, admired him and loved him. Driven by the testimony of Hendrix's fellow
rock musicians, this is the story of Hendrix's journey in the UK and the enduring
impression he made on those who witnessed his playing and got to know him well.
Contributors include Eric Clapton, Dave Mason, Ginger Baker, Eric Burdon, members
of Crosby, Stills and Nash and Hendrix's girlfriend Kathy Etchingham..

Hendrix won many of the most prestigious rock music awards in his lifetime, and has
been posthumously awarded many more, including being inducted into the US Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. An English
Heritage blue plaque was erected in his name on his former residence at Brook Street,
London, in September 1997. A star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame [at 6627
Hollywood Blvd.] was dedicated in 1994. In 2006, his debut US album, Are You
Experienced, was inducted into the United States National Recording Registry, and
Rolling Stone named Hendrix the top guitarist on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists
of all-time in 2003. He was also the first person inducted into the Native American
Music Hall of Fame.
