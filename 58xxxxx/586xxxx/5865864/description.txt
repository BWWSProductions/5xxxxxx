The Venture Brothers season 4 begins again, halfway through. I noticed no one else had uploaded this yet, so I snagged it from a website and put it up here.

File is in .avi format, quality and sound both look fairly good. The site I grabbed this from boasted it as HD quality, but I can't tell the difference on my mediocre screen, so no promises there. I'll stay on until there are at least a few seeders.

Several screenshots included, so you can verify that you haven't seen it already. Episodes 10 and 11 to come shortly.

Enjoy,
