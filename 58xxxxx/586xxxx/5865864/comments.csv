,QborT,2010-10-04T04:38Z,"Also being the genius you are you didn't realise that this had already been uploaded under ""The Venture Bros"""
,FadingSwordsman,2010-10-04T05:18Z,"This is also true. This one is considerably smaller though, so lower quality for the folks with 56k? =P

Also, I had a bit of a time finding E09 and E11, considering I'm not completely computer retarded, I would assume some other people have as well."
,QborT,2010-10-04T16:34Z,"How do you figure this is considerably smaller?  This is the standard size for the simple .avi file of all 21 minute shows.  

Every single episode of Venture Bros gets a rip this size (since this is the scene rip which you relabeled).

Whatever, I'm sure some dipshits out there will find this usefull since people seem to be useless when it comes to using search functions effectively."
,sacfruit,2010-10-24T06:50Z,Holy shit all 21 min show rips are the same size!!!?? Honestly...noone gives a fuck.
