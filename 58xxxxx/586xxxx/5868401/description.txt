Release.Info
People who have stuck with LOST all the way through have witnessed something
special. They witnessed THE greatest television score start, develop and
ultimately bring us to its emotionally walloping end. When that first episode
of the pilot aired it had such a visceral impact because of the music. The
danger, the isolation, the hope and the mystery of the entire show flooded into
us through Giacchinos score. It can be intense, it can be tragic, it can be
heartwarming but most of all its thematically grounded

Season 5 was an amazing emotional accomplishment, and before seeing the final
season I was dubbing it his greatest work on the series thus far. Although now
I can say season 6 his is true master brushstroke. In this season the score is
heavily influenced with Benjamin Linus theme. It pretty much takes its stake
as the main theme of the season since so much revolves around that character
Towards the end of the album we get introduced to Jacob's music and some new
thematic material while familiar themes pop in and out through the journey

The only problem I have with these LOST score releases is how theyre mixed and
recorded. What we have here on these discs from Season 2 beyond are live
recording sessions (season 1 clearly was studio mixed for the final dub). Now
again, I dont know what the decision is behind this but it leads to some
distracting air in the tracks. By air I mean all the sounds of the
musicians. You hear rustling, breathing and moving around. For instance at 1:17
in the track For Love Of The Dame you get a full blown sniffle from someone
The fact that got recorded in the final mix is kind of mind blowing. Now, I
know Im nitpicking here and these are really minor distractions, but they are
distractions nonetheless. If I were sitting and watching a movie and someone
was sniffling and rustling behind me I would turn around and tell them to pipe
down. Same goes for my score listening experience, except I cant tell the
musicians to stop knocking about

In the long run the fact that I am listening to another chapter in the greatest
television score ever composed makes me forget about the rush mixing job. Its
a must buy and will give your tear ducts a good draining
