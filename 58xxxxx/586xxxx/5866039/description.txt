RELEASE NOTES

Jetico Personal Firewall will protect
your computer from unwanted hacker's
attacks from outside as well as from
malicious programs "living" secretly
inside your computer's memory and
hard drive.

Three levels of protection are
included: low-level network packets
filtering, application-level network
events filtering and filtering of
user-level process activity.

Jetico Personal Firewall checks every
packet that comes in or out of your
computer. Using configuration sets
for Security Policy you define how
your computer is connected to the
local network and the whole Internet.

Your computer may be completely
hidden from any unfriendly attempts
to access your hard drive while you
are able to access any web sites you
want and you decide on which
applications are allowed to access
Internet and which are not.

With Jetico Personal Firewall you
feel secure, safe and protected while
enjoying all Internet activities.
