,SamiJPaine,2011-05-06T07:04Z,"Not to be rude but I got season 5 *volume 5* on disk and it says tat this season you're uploading has all the same episodes, so am i reading it wrong or what? again, not to be rude"
,SamiJPaine,2011-05-06T07:21Z,"Not to be rude or anything, but i have Volume 5 for dvd and is that the same as season 5 or am i stupid and its really season 6? Cause your listings have all the same episodes as the dvd and i just chewed out some dude for the same thing but i'm seeing a lot of season 6 out here....=\"
,ibeomnivore,2011-06-23T16:14Z,"@SamiJPaine
Volume 5 could be considered Season 5. Some consider the 4 movies as Season 5 and these episodes as Season 6. wikipedia has several different ""Futurama"" listings and most of them consider these episodes as Season 6. I personally don't care about which season, just that I have all the episodes. Comedy Central is refering to these as Season 6. I heard that they will be splitting Season 7 (26 episodes) into an ""A"" and ""B"" (13 episodes each) 2011 and 2012 respectively. I don't know if this info helps you. Enjoy!"
,finisher489,2011-08-22T17:43Z,THX JUGGALOTUS I LOVE YOUR RIPS!!!!!!!!!! THEY'RE IN AMAZING HD!!! I RECENTLY DOWNLOAD FAMILY GUY SEASON 8 HD AND MAN I LOVED IT!!!!!! COULD YOU TELL ME THE CHANNEL YOU RECORD THEM OFF!!!!!
,finisher489,2011-08-22T17:46Z,When are you going to download episode 13-26!!!

,finisher489,2011-08-25T17:54Z,come to think of it the 1080p torrent on ahashare is actually better than this. I'm surprissed becuase JUGALLOTUS'S torrents are usually the best!!! His Family Guy season 8 was properly the only 720p HD torrent for the season. His Cleveland show and American Dad torrents are the best HD aswell. I don't get it!!!!
,TheMadHat,2011-08-27T08:39Z,OMFG SERIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE YOU RETARDED THIS IS SEASON 5 GOD DAMNIT
,edwardsdean,2011-09-18T14:31Z,hey could u uplode the mkvs plz
