hope you wont mind,...can you give me the whole procedure to make the subtitle appear on the screen while watching the video....i had followed your instructions but it doesn't work..please help me out...."
,prototypeunit02,2010-10-09T07:36Z,"@cathyolandres:

bothe files should have same filename example:

movie.avi
movie.srt

if both file doesn't have same filename even space or period would make a difference it will not load so make sure they are the same.

and also you should have a codec if you are using media player heres the link:
