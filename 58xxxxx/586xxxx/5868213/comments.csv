It's playable out-of-the-box on many many devices - computers, PS3, Xbox and newer standalones. Quality is above XviD, especially one new big-ass screens. MKV can be played on computers only (and maybe few standalone players). 
And - 720p is bigger - 'official' 720p JUST SEVEN TIMES. LOL to crazies who burn bandwidth on TV shows."
