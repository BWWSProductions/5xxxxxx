my comments, I recommend to all NON SPANISH speaking to wait for subtitles since large sections are in Spanish and this was broad-casted in Spanish tv so the only subs are for English parts not for the Spanish parts.

btw the subtitles in Spanish are HORRIBLE in yellow jumping up and down allover the screen, a very poor job done since the way Stone films is already very unsteady so having clear subs is a most to be able to concentrate...

Any way, HASTA LA VICTORIA SIEMPRE!! VENCEREMOS!"
