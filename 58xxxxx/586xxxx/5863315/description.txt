Bodycall is dark electro / aggrotech band that has been present on the scene since 2003. Bodycall's style has been constantly evolving towards its today's formula, which can be described as harsh but melodic synth lines with strong beat and aggressive (but much cleaner than it is normally the case in this genre) vocals. 

"Reiteration" consists of brand new versions of Bodycall's songs and two previously unpublished compositions. This material is a kind of side effect that sprouted out of various experiments the band is undertaking during the work on its new full length release. 

Even though the songs featuring on "Reiteration" come from a wide time span (2003 - 2010) the release is consistent and all the music has been written from scratch during first months of 2010. The style is dark electro and aggrotech or electro-industrial. Those who are not purists and "old school only" fans can spot some EBM elements and inspirations as well.
