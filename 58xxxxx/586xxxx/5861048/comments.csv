....and thanks for Searching.for.Bobby.Fischer."
,techstar,2010-10-02T05:23Z,yaar plz add sample in ur movies...
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-02T07:42Z,"@techstar: CAM and TS always have sample included. DVDrips and BluRay  would never have the sample. There is nothing to evaluate. Specs are in NFO.

My tip: go for download where you can have trust in quality of uploader's work - and in this case, go someplace else."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-02T07:48Z,"@dkhere: There is one, here
