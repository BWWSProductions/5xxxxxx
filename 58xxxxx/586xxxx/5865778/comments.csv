[T],on.off.on,2010-10-04T18:22Z,@lldlls First u need to find some subs and then use SrtiPhone 1.0 to convert the SRT file to a normal txt file so ur iphone can read it. then place the txt file in the same folder as the movie with the same name then u can add it to the movie under settings on ur iphone while playing the movie.
