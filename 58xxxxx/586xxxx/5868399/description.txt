This is the Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen DVDrip (2010) Thanks and credit to raymondhome for the source and cudencuden for the subs. I hardcoded the English subs on the movie. There was already hardcoded Chinese subs on the rip so I put the Eng under those for better readability. Sample & Screens included.  

PLOT: Seven years after the apparent death of Chen Zhen, who was shot after discovering who was responsible for his teacher's death (Huo Yuanjia) in Japanese-occupied Shanghai. A mysterious stranger arrives from overseas and befriends a local mafia boss. That man is a disguised Chen Zhen, who intends to infiltrate the mob when they form an alliance with the Japanese. Disguising himself as a caped fighter by night, Chen intends to take out everyone involved as well as get his hands on an assassination list prepared by the Japanese.
