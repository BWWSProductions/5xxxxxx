,heavydiamond,2010-10-05T22:43Z,"just wanna say hi and thanks 4 the effort ,did u find out why your files r coming out slightly larger?"
,AnitialD,2010-10-05T23:40Z,"Well I'm re-encoding them and using different stats. bitrate's, window size and such, I'm trying to not just reup other people torrents 100%. I probably could've kept this one down though. I don't know how to guess what the size will be before the encode and the program I use doesn't say what the output will be. By the time its done hours later, I don't wanna do it again unless there's a problem. I just hope people won't mind and if they do, there's other versions out there. I will take request though, if someone wants something under a certain size, I'll see what I can do. Thanks for asking. "
,AnitialD,2010-10-05T23:46Z,"One more thing. I'm sure you all know by now that new torrents are saying 0 for seeders and leechers. FYI, I upped this on Demonoid as well and as of right now we have a few seeders and a bunch of leechers so feel free to d/l. Thanks and please Seed if possible."
