,milk3000,2010-10-25T09:25Z,"I'm curious as to what L.S.C means and is this the last one in english so far?

If it is i might have to go into subtitled. Does anyone know if the episodes match i.e. are at the same place in the story. ( like would 174 be exactly the same but with dif language and subtitles)"
