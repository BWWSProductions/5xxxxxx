Guitarway to Heaven 4 - Amplified

Tested and working on PSP-1000 (5.50 GEN-D3) and PSP-2000 (5.50 GEN-D3).

Instructions:

To play just copy 'PSP' folder onto your Memory Stick.

Since game controls can turn up unsuitable for Rockband fans i've included optional button remapping plugin. To use it just copy 'seplugins' folder onto your Memory Stick and enable 'macrofire.prx' plugin in any convenient way. This way the UP ARROW will play red notes as it does in Rockband. And LEFT TRIGGER will function as UP ARROW. This achieved by binding Cross button functions to UP ARROW, so be aware of that. And don't forget to disable 'macrofire.prx' plugin while playing other games, cuz it will interfere with your regular game controls. 

Default controls:

Left arrow: green notes
Up arrow: yellow notes
Right arrow: blue notes
Down Arrow: red notes

OR

Square: green notes
Triangle: yellow notes
Circle: blue notes
Cross: red notes

Alternative controls (Rockband-style):

Left arrow: green notes
Up arrow: red notes
Triangle: yellow notes
Circle: blue notes
