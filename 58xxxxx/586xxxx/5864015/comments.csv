,Computer_Man,2010-10-10T10:28Z,"The subtitles have some errors. Can you please update or fix your subtitle maker as these are the errors:

Sometimes for ages a letter is capitalised in middle of a sentence/word.

Sometimes the Capital 'i' is an 'l' or the reverse.

It happens in this torrent and in some of your more new torrents."

I'm guessing you have Lynda's Flash CS4 Videos on your computer.  When you try to play a video file that is not complete, sometimes your media player 'grabs' other files.  I don't understand it, but I've had it happen to me several times.  Once you have the entire file downloaded, it won't happen anymore."

,L0gan5,2010-11-13T04:32Z,"same as others on here, got 2 emails from Comcast saying I've committed copyright infringement and they may discontinue my service. got one of these emails a few years back, so just didn't download for a while then slowly eased back into it and didnt leave utorrent running all day. but does anyone know if ISPs can really discontinue service based on a torrent download?"
,AngelsHalo,2010-11-13T06:03Z,yeah I also got a message from Verizon saying that I was downloading illeagally and that this was the 3rd and final message and that my internet will be shut off permenatly. but I never recieved any calls or e-mails before!

I'd recommend finding a different torrent imho.

,Xector,2010-12-24T00:31Z,"Like others, I got a copyright infringement notice from Comcast from downloading this torrent.

For all of you guys who don't know how this kind of stuff happens, here it is.
Someone from some company that gives a shit about pirating downloads this torrent. Then, when they are downloading, they can see the seeder's info, including their IP address. Then they go find out that seeder's ISP and go tattle on them. Thus, the email.

So its not that you download too much, though if you are using tons of bandwidth that will probably attract attention, its because of that, up above.

FYI."

I am fairly new to Torrents compared to most people on here. Let me start by saying Thank you Very Much for all of your hard work on all of these quality ups of yours!!! Your u/l's are always top quality & I never have to read the comments for A=?, V=?. if it saysâ€¦ By  FXG_team, Itâ€™s golden! I always trust your d/lâ€™s !!! I was wondering if you & your team accept donations of any kind? I myself donâ€™t think seeding alone plus a polite comment here and there is thank~you enough. I do seed as often & as much as I can however. If I may ask another question. My G/F wants to see  â€œFlicaâ€œ & ""Flicka 2"" in a bad way, Would you happen to have them? I would love to have both for her to watch back-to-back. When sheâ€™s happyâ€¦ Iâ€™m happy :o)~ I will give you my email addy so you can answer my first & second questions, if you get the time. I appreciate you sharing all of these quality torrents with everyone. Thanks once again for all of your hard work...it is very much appreciated!!!  Ozzyfan

,SYMatkal,2011-04-27T23:27Z,"Let's get a couple of things straight:
Yes, you can be tracked for downloading this.
Peerblock doesn't necessarily help because it doesn't encrypt the data, it just blacklists certain known ""Bad"" computers. If you want real protection, use The Onion Router network, configurable in your Torrent client. 
Great quality btw, as usual"

That's incorrect. Apart from the fact that the Tor network was not designed to handle P2P and can't be designed economically defendable to use P2P (someone has to pay the exit "
,Nestea_Zen,2012-04-03T02:08Z,"servers), is that none of the clients are designed to use Tor. In Vuze it's an old relict before there was a change of developers.

If one wants anonimity -to a certain degree- you HAVE to pay or use I2P in which case the speed and availability takes a massive hit."
