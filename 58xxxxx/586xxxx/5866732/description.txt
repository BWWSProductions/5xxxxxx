                    Conclusion of the crime drama. The suspected  
                    murderer Marcus Payne dies without regaining  
                    consciousness, but his wife Lucy recovers from  
                    the injuries caused by her husband. Banks must  
                    find the missing girl Leanne Wray, but time is  
                    against him and he is hindered by DS Annie  
                    Cabbot who wants to spend time investigating  
                    the now suspicious death of the killer. Banks  
                    knows that Payne must have had an accomplice  
                    and he questions Lucy. She flirts with Banks,  
                    emotionally playing him. Banks decides to take  
                    her in for questioning on the grounds of being  
                    involved with the rape and murder of the four  
                    girls and the disappearance of Leanne. But  
                    things gets complicated when Lucy's background  
                    and true identity is revealed. Can a victim  
                    also be guilty?
