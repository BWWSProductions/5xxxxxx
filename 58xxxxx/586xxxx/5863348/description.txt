Here is my fanmade Monster Ball Tour DVD by Lady GaGa! 


What I did with this is I used the best Monster Ball bootleg available (the MSG bootleg) for an audio track, and found a bunch of good HD videos from the Monster Ball. I synced them up with the audio track, and then cut the videos down so the angles switched, so it looks like a real tour DVD. This is much better than most of the usual fanmade tour DVDs that you'll fine on YouTube. This is the MP4 version of the torrent. Please visit the links below for  the (smaller) WMV version of it!

I will be posting a sample of the intro + Dance in the Dark in a bit. 

Enjoy!
