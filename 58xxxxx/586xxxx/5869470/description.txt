NOTES! I use TS ELEKTRI4KA video wich i work a little bit on the source and change the brightness and contrast,
the audio source it`s from IMAGiNE release many thx for that, wich i work`it a little bit the sound & increase the volume.
I make the files much smaller without damaging the quality of the movie,and smaller files means faster downloading.
Works with all DVD Players and Compatible > PS3 & XBOX 360.

Gratitude and Respect to:
IMAGiNE, FUSiON, ELEKTRI4KA, PrisM , SecretMyth, Noir, X, LEGiON
