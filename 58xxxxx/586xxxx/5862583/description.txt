Plot:

The film starts with Arush (Akshay Kumar), who is seen leaving his job to go back to stay with his best buddy, Bob (Ritesh Deshmukh) and his wife, Hetal (Lara Dutta), two casino employees in London. Arush's unwelcome gatecrash turns the life of the couple upside down with his bad luck rubbing off into their home. Bob and Hetal set him up with their boss' (Randhir Kapoor) daughter, Devika (Jiah Khan), and it seemed like the perfect match of a traditional Indian boy and girl. But when he finds out that Devika only married him because she wanted her father's property, he leaves her. She was actually in love with an American guy, who her father would not approve of. A final plea to God leads to Arush meets up with his one true love, Saundariya Bhagyalakshmi Venkateshwari Baassappa Rao, aka Sandy(Deepika Padukone).
