13 Cats is an all star neo-rockabilly band consisting of Slim Jim Phantom (Straycats), Tim Polecat (Polecats), Danny B. Harvey (Rockats) and Smutty Smith (Rockats). The album contains all the studio recordings the band made over the past four years. In April 2003 the 13 Cats CD is finally made available on Raucous (UK). The title is still "13 Tracks", even though they threw in 2 bonus tracks, so actually it's "15 Tracks" now.
