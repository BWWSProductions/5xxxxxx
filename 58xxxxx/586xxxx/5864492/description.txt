Hey. As promised, I now upload the pictures from "Amy.ihateyounow.com." 

The site is similar to "Johns' Revenge," "Ihateyoujulie" and "Ihateyounatalie," 

where you have to get people to click on a personally link you get from the 

website.


But unfortunately we wont be able to see all the pictures, when you've get 16 

to click on your link as promised. Therefore, I upload only the images you get 

for 8 clicks. :(  

But many thanks for those who helped me making this possible. :)

NOT "IHATEYOU.COM" (which contains a lot of viruses), but "alli.ihateyounow.com"
