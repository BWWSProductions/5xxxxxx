"'Low-fi' does not quite fit because it has such Beat Happening connotations.... has anyone on the Internet coined a phrase for dudes who just use a MacBook and a Telecaster to construct heartwarmingly simple dance songs? Mac-Fi? After this post, I am contacting the copyright department to trademark it. Part Of Montreal, part Gene Defcon, the music teeters on the verge of novelty but is resiliently earnest and above all- fun. Is that not what we are all looking for in our music?"

"Armed with little more than a laptop, a Telecaster, and a pair of sunglasses (and often leaving behind other things, like his pants), Austinâ€™s Neiliyo is one of several artists making good use of the 21st-century democratization of musicâ€”which is to say he steals cheesy shit from Technotronic and Nu Shooz, rips it apart, and starts again with a barrage of arpeggiated synths, 808 beats, dance-punk guitar, and half-joking come-ons. When heâ€™s not playing digital pirateâ€”as on his new mixtape Copywriting 101â€”heâ€™s cranking out electro-funk rave-ups that split the difference between LCD Soundsystem (before he got all serious) and Har Mar Superstar (before he got all famous).

"...Neiliyoâ€™s music is found somewhere in a funk-meets-hip-hop-meets-dance cloud where humor and mischief dance gleefully."
