,l4z1,2011-09-03T13:26Z,"Here is a tip so you don't waste your bandwidth thinking this is something else

1) Open: the control panel
2) Open: Backup and Restore
3) Put a blank CDR in your burner
4) Click the ""Create a system repair disc"" on the left, and press the create disc button and wait for it to finish
5) You're Done. bandwidth wasted = none. Why? because this download is the same exact file as the once created through windows 7 100%

If you need something more then choose something like Hiren's BootCD which actually has some tools"
