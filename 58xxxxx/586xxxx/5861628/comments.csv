,prydon,2010-10-02T04:53Z,Again; sorry about the crappy upload speeds
,PhiberOptix,2010-10-02T09:00Z,So that's how it ended?! That was a weird ending!
,mkmacabre,2010-10-03T06:34Z,"Hi mate,

I was getting this show from TVTEAM, but they didn't upload the season finale (Episode 10) for some bizarre reason?!?

Could you please upload a normal sized version of episode ten for us all? About 350mb in size?

Thanks :)"
,mkmacabre,2010-10-05T23:27Z,"PS: If possible, in an .avi format? I can not get the .mkv file to play, even on VLC!!!???!!!"
,Mattan138,2010-10-13T13:24Z,"Does anyone have this downloaded 100%?

I've been stuck on 94.1% for days."
,quipeace,2010-10-14T08:42Z,"Looks like this one is dead, just like Mattan138 I've been stuck at 94.1% for ages.

I'm downloading the seperate eps right now, so if there's still demand I'll upload a new pack."
,mkmacabre,2010-10-15T07:09Z,"@ quipeace:

Yes please mate! I got all other episodes (1-9) from TVTeam and/or Scenebalance, but neither of them uploaded the series finales (ep10)!!!!!

Dying to see this last episode for about a month now. but i can not get the .mkv files to work :(

I even downloaded ojo total converter and spent 9 hours trying to convert it to an .avi file, but alas i could not master it.

Could you PLEASE upload a normal 350mb .avi version of episode ten????"
,prydon,2010-10-21T04:29Z,@mkmacabre use VLC to view the mkvs
,mkmacabre,2010-10-21T08:47Z,"@ Prydon. It seems that this .mkv file will not play on VLC player. I get the audio, but it will cause a fatal error on VLC itself causing the shut down of VLC.

However, the .mkv file format itself will not play on a standalone divx player, which is how i usually watch my downloads, on a big TV.

Any chance of the regular 350mb .avi version of episode 10 please?

I spent hours trying to convert this to .avi myself, but failed :("
[T],jonnoel1,2010-10-22T10:32Z,These are not High Res eps (1080+) they are 720p
,Galxra,2011-06-21T22:59Z,To all of you that donât manage to play the files use; KMPlayer. It plays everything.
