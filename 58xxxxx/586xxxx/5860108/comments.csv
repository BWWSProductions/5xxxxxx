,lrdalucard,2011-05-22T14:50Z,"File over 4.49G can't start download?
Thats becouse you guys are using a Computer with FAT32 system, thats old stuff you guys need to update you system to NTFS.(Requires formating PC, if I recall)

That will solve the problm with being not abel to start the download of the game.


Now, has for it to be played in a emulator or in ps3, I think u need to save it to the ps3 hdd.
In case of emulator would be nice to have the original BLUERAY-DISK running on the emulator"
