,ROM3V,2010-10-04T21:42Z,Does It have portuguese?? Like the other WRC games??
,alwaysfullboost,2010-10-04T22:18Z,"Theres no crack? I have installed it, and the image is mounted with PowerISO. but when i try to run the game i get a disk check error. what gives?"
[V],Mbb15,2010-10-04T22:35Z,Look when you mount the game look into the dvd for a crack folder
,alwaysfullboost,2010-10-04T22:35Z,"nevermind, i used virtualdrive and it works without a crack. "
,alwaysfullboost,2010-10-04T22:51Z,"Game installed perfectly. Use virtualdrive and have the image mounted to play the game. 

Online works perfectly, just pwned some noob with a soobie. 

g27 and the 360 controller work fine. No clutch tho GRR!!
"
,justcause28,2010-10-05T00:07Z,LMAO @ Soobie. What is a soobie?
,justcause28,2010-10-05T00:38Z,I wont have this downloaded until tomorrow. Its downloading fair slow.
,ROM3V,2010-10-05T00:49Z,@ justcause28 I think soobie means... Subaru?? xD
,alwaysfullboost,2010-10-05T01:31Z,"soobie - Subaru Impreza STi

hmm for some reason i got DCd from a race and now I cant find anyone else to race... 

can anyone else confirm that they cant find anyone to race online?"
,alwaysfullboost,2010-10-05T01:32Z,Dublens mine works fine. whats your error codE?
,justcause28,2010-10-05T01:36Z,.
,justcause28,2010-10-05T01:40Z,"You meant Scoobie then. In all honesty you downloaded the game by bit torrent pirating the game , went online and got disconnected and you wonder why. I cant understand the stupidity of some people. If you want to play it online (like I always do) If you want to play single player then pirate the game."
[V],Mbb15,2010-10-05T01:42Z,dubbie is trolling dont take him sirious :)
,justcause28,2010-10-05T01:46Z,..
,p2pPirate,2010-10-05T02:27Z,"netfolder .in/ folder.php?folder_id =956719a

download > WRC.2o1o.(mini-Image).-TPTB.rar 

mount mini iso with any virtual drive tool like alcohol etc.

play game!...

tested, as the RLD version does not have a crack included!."
,alwaysfullboost,2010-10-05T03:01Z,"online is working now. idk why it stopped.

@ justcause28 

9/10 id agree with you and I can see why you think im stupid. 

but since you have not played the game, please dont go and call me stupid since you have no idea what you are talking about.

the online muiltiplayer worked fine for 7 hours, then stopped for 5 hours. now its back up.

is it because of my pirated copy i couldnt connect? or was it wide spread? or just a fluke in the server? who knows

THATS WHY I FUCKING ASKED HERE.

so next time you dont know what you are talking about, keep your mouth shut.
"
,justcause28,2010-10-05T08:59Z,@alwaysfullboost: Yes I have played the game. Did you ever hear of these things called demos? There was a demo for this game released last week.
,justcause28,2010-10-05T10:13Z,If you want to play online then buy the game (like I do) but if you want to play single player then by all means pirate the game if you cant afford to buy it. They will still make a profit if the game is good.
,justcause28,2010-10-05T14:55Z,There is no crack. Keep the iso mounted to play the game.
,piromandule,2010-10-05T16:15Z,"Everything works fine. Just mounted and started playing. without crack.
And the game is not even bad. Nice.
Cheers!!!!"
,dezontk101,2010-10-05T19:27Z,"No break through game play, and graphics are really poor even at 1920x1080 with everything maxed. Avoid."
,TheBlaker,2010-10-05T21:01Z,Does anyone know how to get the xbox controller to work
,leon-of-teamtptb,2010-10-05T22:20Z,@ TheBlaker just go to controller settings there is keyboard click it and change to controller mine works anyways but i did have to find the controller settings first hope it helps u 
,ROM3V,2010-10-06T01:45Z,Someone can answer my question please?? Does it have portuguese language?? thanks in advance...
,richiem2282,2010-10-06T17:26Z,"Doesn't work with Fanatec Wheel and Pedals, Any ideas lads, thanks in advance..."
,supr3me_kill3r,2010-10-08T21:21Z,"""No break through game play, and graphics are really poor even at 1920x1080 with everything maxed. Avoid.""

How about avoiding this comment, since your an idiot. Game is a lot of fun, try it."
,cederrowe,2010-10-09T21:14Z,Can't get the g25 wheel working
,richiem2282,2010-10-13T00:53Z,"Milestone/Blackbean are the sadist bunch of gaming developers I've ever seen, Take a look at the credits screen at the start and you'll notice that Fanatec have a Trademark on the credits and their steering and pedals don't even work. Amateurs.... at best...."
,genraltx,2010-10-15T13:06Z,"@richiem2282 All you need to do is enable your wheel assigned to the controls at teh options screen

At the top where it should say keyboard press right on that bar and it should detect your wheel"
,dasgrosse86,2010-10-20T00:27Z,"Maybe IÂ´m really stupid, but started the games twice now and havenÂ´t yet found how and where i save the game.
Boring to start a new career all the time ;)"
,blackanddecker,2010-10-20T18:31Z,"whats wrong with it, it say, set in the dvd disc, can sombody tell me waht is wrong?? ."
,blackanddecker,2010-10-20T18:39Z,"whats wrong, its say, insert the dvd disc??"
,richiem2282,2010-10-20T23:56Z,"@genraltx - That doesn't work, Not recognizing either the Wheel or the Pedals, has that Slider shit as options and not way to set them what so ever, we need to be able to download the updates that Milestone release(if ever), Anyone know where to get them?"
,reamz,2010-11-13T16:27Z,"i get an error, ''please insert the WRC FIA World rally championship DVD to play.''

,reamz,2010-11-13T16:43Z,"sorry about last post, figured it out. It wont play with Poweriso but it WILL play with daemon tools lite. yay i got it working :)"
