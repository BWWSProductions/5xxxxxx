IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Devil vobs ..................Thanks to a good friend 
AUDIO:Devil vobs ..................Thanks to a good friend 

Here we go again with another version... but hey they keep getting better :lol: Well this was a decent homemade cam, had a slanted border across the top left and also has the odd few secs of auto focuse here and there. Audio for good was pretty decent and better then the other cam audio out. What we did for this was first used DGI to make our d2v file and strip the audio and then made a script with the normal brightness, contrast, chroma, rgb eq, sharpness etc... and then we loaded it into vdub and used the quad filter to remove the slanted border without losing any video and then resized it. The audio we just remuxed to the encode... hence the AC3 track.
