[V],globeplus,2010-10-05T03:27Z,"I leave it absolutly normal this game because is unforgiven to deteriote the gameplay of this nice rally game , i think all the players of the game deserve the best gameplay to full enjoy this game ... the launcher executable of the game in order to run properly need a disc in a virtual drive , so i create a fully functional mini-iso that simulates the real disc , it is like that this game , beside this little thing it is nothing else to report and is total complete game with normal quality .
Thank you and enjoy your World Rally Championship from this year ..."
,bd201020,2010-10-05T03:37Z,"Hi Globe, and thanks for the great upload. Quick question: To run this do I need to mount the mini iso or will the game.exe do this automatically? Thanks"

,NSRacer,2010-10-05T08:29Z,YOU ARE THE BEST !!! CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THIS GAME !!!
[V],globeplus,2010-10-05T10:35Z,"To bd201020 : it is the normal stuff for games that needs a disc on the virtual drive , you need to keep the disc on the virtual drive then it is just run the launcher of the game , in this case i prepared a sympathic mini-iso with 20 mb or something simulating the original disc then you put the mini.iso on a virtual drive and you are free to go ."

[V],globeplus,2010-10-05T17:58Z,"To bd201020 : this is not a rip , this is the complete game no doubt with nice compression , just really small things get little touches but nothing to do it with the game ,the gameplay itself is totally complete and absolute normal quality , you can believe me no doubt !!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-10-05T18:07Z,"This comment it is just for saying that beside the fact that the the alternative mini-iso is smaller with only 1.94 mb , have the icon totally correct like the original , so not only smaller but looking better too on the virtual drive . PLEASE , give it a try !!!"

[V],globeplus,2010-10-06T22:01Z,"This last comments a kind that break my heart in the way that as an uploader i follow the pronciples of respect for others work , only beeing another possible valid option to the users and on thing i never did it in many tears uploading files , it was to guilty someone of something without beeing really shore about the acusation , for a circunstancial coincidence 2 different persons can use the same program to do the work but that doesnÂ´t mean obviously that someone is copying the work , i donÂ´t mind to copy when it is the case and many times it is a pleasure for me when i see really nice cracking work doing nice worked executables under many times a kind of tough security proteccions but this guys make an effort to so the correct work and share freely with the others , beside a circunstancial healthy competition between who does this type of work , all of them deserve the credits and thanks for all the downloaders of nice games in the torrents and work like that i sincerely respect and donÂ´t mind to copy but i never had the intention and i  certainly donÂ´t be even for a second to copy anything from my beloved concorrence , i think each one do their own work and the users have the right to make the choice and that is really the correct way to go . happy gaming my friendly users and it is a pleasure do nice work on the files and this new sympathic mini-iso with only 1.94 mb is a prove of that ."

[V],globeplus,2010-10-06T22:30Z,"UPLOADER DISCLAIMER : i probably need a deserved holydays , the situation is the next  : when i maked the work on both mini-isos they was working perfectly at that moment in time and now both are not working and i dibÂ´t realized why bt i have a complementary dll toi the main executable that works perctly for 1.71 mb , please get this dll and play your game for shore :

(copy or write in succession the link to the address bar)
one thing is for shore : if at the moment that i tested them i realised they didnÂ´t work i certainly not uploading them , so now bye bye mini-isos and it is a complementary dll that do the trick without any doubt . sorry for the little inconvenience but sometimes can happen things to an upoloader that donÂ´t have a reasonable explanation easy as that , well i donÂ´t want to understand what happen but get this dll ro run the game . thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-10-06T22:42Z,TO RUN THE GAME GET THE 1.71 MB DLL ON THE LINK OF THE BEFORE COMMENT . THANK YOU .
[V],globeplus,2010-10-06T23:04Z,"The dll works fine but i want to tell the next story : after i did the work i uninstalled the game then when i tried to run the launcher i get a message that the DVD wasnÂ´t on the drive to play then i did the mini-iso and when i run the launcher with the game uninstalled the game runned ok no doubt many times , i didnÂ´t know it about theexistence of the dll at that point , then i made it a small one always with the game uninstalled and once again the game runned ok with the worked mini-iso and i get satisfied with the work uploading both mini-isos to the users , one with the file and the other as an option after that that is in this comments too , today , close 24 hours later and runned the game again with the mini-iso and the game this time not running with a normal dvd message to need the disc at the virtual drive to run the game then iget surprised and i tested the other mini-iso too and happen the same thing , finally i gone to the game copy world and i find a nice worked dll , complementary to the game executable that runs perfectly the game and then i reupload in a nice link that is the link that the users can get on this comments , the moral of this story : why the mini-isos worked at that moment in time with the game really uninstalled and why when i tried to run the game without them at the virtual drive i get the message that the game needed the dvd on the virtual dribe and when i used any of mini-isos at that moment in time the game worked perfectly ? It is my friendly users this story that explains the little inconvenience of i included a non working mini-isos on the file and of course it is a matter to say that sometimes can happens starnge things to an uploader , ok enough story  and get the 1.71 mb dll that works perfectly no matter what , working in mini-isos is not safe and that is my lesson on the work of this game . Thank you and happy gaming ."
,Spades76,2010-10-07T12:31Z,"Hey Globe, many thx for the upload, works fine for me with one little exception:
I just can't get my controller to work... There is no option other than ""Keyboard"" in the options menu and even though I can use my controller to scroll through menus it goes dead as soon as I start a stage. Any help here would be really appreciated!"
[V],globeplus,2010-10-07T13:43Z,"To Spades76 : hi , if for one side the pc games can have problems with troubleshooting sometimes , for other side this particular game it is very simple not justifying minimally the use of a controller and really probably is more pratical to play with the keybord , why ? because the only keys you need are just the cursor keys , left , right , up to accelerate and down cursor key to brake , so can´t be more easy , the controller certainly not necessary ."
,Spades76,2010-10-07T16:59Z,"Ok it was my bad, you can just switch to gamepad in the Control options.
But the game itself sucks, the physics of the cars are ridiculous as are sound and graphics... Why couldn't stupid Codemasters buy the license and give us a real Rally simulation instead of that Dirt2 Arcade junk...
Oh well, anyway, if anyone wants to see for themselves this is definetely a working torrent."
[V],globeplus,2010-10-07T18:01Z,"To Spades76 : play carreer or championship in single player mode and you can choose between 2 to 6 stages for race , it is a nice entertaining rally game beside the fact that maybe was possible a little better here and there in some things but still a enjoyable game ."
