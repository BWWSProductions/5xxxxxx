.: Plot :.

The show focused on the life of Norm Henderson (Norm MacDonald), a former NHL  hockey player who is banned for life from hockey due to gambling and tax evasion. In order to avoid jail time for these crimes, Norm must perform five years of community service as a full-time social worker. Other characters in the show included fellow social workers Laurie Freeman (Laurie Metcalf), Danny Sanchez (Ian Gomez), and Danny's sometime girlfriend and former prostitute Taylor Clayton (Nikki Cox). Normâ€™s boss on the program for the first several episodes was named Anthony Curtis and was played by Bruce Jarchow. This character was quickly replaced by a new boss, Max Denby, who was played by Max Wright.

The second season of the show saw the addition of Artie Lange, playing Norm's half brother. The second season also brought about the shortening of the showâ€™s official title to simply Norm to avoid a legal conflict with Michael Jantze's comic strip The Norm.
