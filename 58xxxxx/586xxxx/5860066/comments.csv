[V],twentyforty,2010-10-01T22:48Z,"That's what I need (and expect). Words of support and not allowing Lunatics United to shit on carpet in my living room. And left me alone to deal with.
Thanks guys!

@monkey_brain: Reason for that is simple: I arrived on TPB as refugee from downed mininova ten months ago. Needless to say, beside fan-base and support from few MILLIONS of downloaders - I lost pretty much everything by that occasion. Well... nothing new..."
