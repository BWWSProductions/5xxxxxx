,drbetico,2011-01-29T04:01Z,"Not worth to download.
Quality poor and audio even worse.
It seems like it was recorded by a grandpa with Parkinson from a cheap cinema.
Don't waste your time with this and wait for a proper DVD/Blue Ray quality to be released."
,drbetico,2011-01-29T04:08Z,"Terrible quality.
People walking on the cinema and cutting chunks of movie, Terrible audio and no english subs.
Not worth it.
People shouldn't be allowed to upload movies with this quality.
Don't waste your time with this crap.
Although, movie looks promising.
I'll wait for the official release.
Cheers"
