,MT_Head,2010-10-07T05:26Z,Thanks for a really nice upload...any chance that you might accidentally seed it or do I just delete what I have?
,MT_Head,2010-10-08T06:13Z,"Pirates, don't bother downloading unless you like to get 99% of a torrent. This fucking noob uploads but doesn't seed enough to ensure an active torrent. I would surmise it is too busy knob gobbling to be bothered with such silly things as seeding torrents that it took the time and energy to upload.

Thanks sooooo much for the waste of time, you ignorant fucking TWAT! Choke on a boner, fonestard."

Maybe you should bother inquiring before you go spouting off moron!"

Thanks in advance"
