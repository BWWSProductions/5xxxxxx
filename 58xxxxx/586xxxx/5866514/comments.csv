I'm stuck at 83.6% and if I don't get a seeder soon I'm outa here (been uploading at half a mb/sec till now)"
,havor,2010-10-22T15:02Z,"Hi Larsen it is a exelent torrent

But could you pleas keep seeding untill there are some more seeders

Just sharinging the torrent dose not do the job you have to put it on seeding, now i get a part and then after a wile a other part, if you sharing sudsh a big DL you also have to put the upload time in to it.

How to do it, if you use uTorrent, right klick on the torrent  > Properties > check [x] Initial Seeding.

Otherwise it would be sudsh a waist of suds a nice torrent ware you have put in so mouths work"
,marcadus,2010-11-14T18:28Z,Stuck at 99.8% I'm willing to seed for a few months once I'm done looks like a good collection and good quality on what episodes have finished
,username1107,2010-12-03T14:06Z,there is no seeds suck at 7% i have start seeding my self but have limit it to 50kb/s upload  in the hope to get more people on
,lillelarsenDK,2010-12-04T16:39Z,"I'm seeding around 150 k/bit per sec. I have registered about 24 other seeder, but I don't know if they are seeding..

,palto123,2010-12-16T01:15Z,"I finished downloading this torrent and have been seeding for a while... BUT I moved the files from my computer to an external hard-drive and forgot I was sharing... ANYWAYS I am using uTorrent2.2 and would like to continue seeding, so my question is... HOW DO I RE-ACTIVATE THE TORRENT TO CONTINUE SEEDING?

ALSO... How many episodes are there in Naruto Shippuden? I notices that after a while its more episodes of when Naruto was small... does it go back in time?"
,lillelarsenDK,2010-12-21T23:36Z,"palto123: You have to stop the torrent, and right click on the torrent, and select advance and choose where you want to download to. And then find the folder and select it.

About the episodes: There are current 191 of the shippuden episodes. currently there are ""fillers"" so it does not follow the manga right now.

Hope it did help

,username1107,2011-01-02T19:02Z,I was seeding but my isp has kill my access to the site/ or torrent died but that not the case i can not download any thing else from the site dam 62% done to
,Spikey46,2011-05-08T16:37Z,"71.91 GiB! Good effort! 
I was wondering, though, because I'm only able to download 50GiB a month, if there was a way you could have 3 separate torrents? Like one with Naruto episodes, one with Naruto Shippuden episodes, and one with movies?
That way it'll cut up the download a bit, because I only really want shippuden, and will pick up the old stuff once I'm done with Shippuden :)
Again, cheers for the torrent, great help to people... especially with unlimited Downloads ;)"
,mrmike75,2011-06-11T13:25Z,I'm new to this so I hope U all don't mind helpin me out? that would be Great. Just by readin the comments seeding is very important. see I'm downloading right now and under Seeds it shows 3(11) is that bad? and also how do we seed? So that way I don't be one of the Leechers which also sounds bad....lol....So if U all don't mind educating me that would be awesome.... Thanks
,lillelarsenDK,2011-07-07T19:41Z,"mrmike75:
Sorry for the late answer...
3(11) means that there are 11 who has the full download and only 3 is online atm. When you have downloaded, you will automatic switch to seeder, tho you are seeding all the time, unless you say that it should download only ^^ - sry my bad english xD"
