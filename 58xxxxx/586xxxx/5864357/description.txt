Kanchenjungha is a 1962 film by Bengali film director Satyajit Ray. It was Ray's first original screenplay and his first colour film.
The film is about an upper class Bengali family on vacation in Darjeeling,a popular hill station and resort, near Kanchenjunga. Shot in real time, the film examines the evolving relationships between the various characters. With dialogue shifting between English and Bengali among an ensemble cast, the film was a departure for Ray.
