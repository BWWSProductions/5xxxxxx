 A young mentally-ill killer, Gunther Wyckoff, escapes   
 from a mental institution, murder a bus driver and,     
 then, takes six hostages in a bar. The gun in Wyckoff's 
 hand kills without emotion or pity wielded by a man     
 bare of emotion. Begins as a moral question whether an  
 insane killer should or should not be sent to the       
 electric, but goes elsewhere before it ends.

  The film is notable as it was one of the first movies put    
  out by MGM under new management which turned the company     
  away from solely making big budget events. This B-movie      
  thriller marked a new territory for MGM.
