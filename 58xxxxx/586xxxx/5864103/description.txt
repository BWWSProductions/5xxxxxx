Pure pop, just as it should sound. Many will only be familiar with the hit "Happy Talk", which is not the best track on this album. The tunes are all strong, and though generally lighthearted and fun there is the odd serious subject and several different musical styles thrown in to add variety. And it works -- Women And Captains First is an enjoyable listen throughout. 

New Musik fans are sure to love this as Tony Mansfield contributes much of his considerable talents, not just with his distinctive production.
