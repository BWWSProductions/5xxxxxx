A couple's golf game comes to a screeching halt when they stumble upon a dead body along the fairway. Doug, the victim, was the caddy and life-long friend of professional golfer Scott Winters, and was also recently released from prison after attempting to date-rape a professional female golfer. Things aren't adding up for Longworth as he investigates all the key players and discovers the victim may have served time for a crime he didn't commit. All the time on the golf course motivates Longworth to commit to finally breaking 80 on the greens. Meanwhile, Heather tempts Longworth with her grandmother's secret lasagna recipe and Callie stews over their relationship. Intern Daniel asks for a promotion.
