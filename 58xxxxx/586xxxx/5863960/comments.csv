,1BigBadWolf,2010-10-03T21:27Z,"Hi Thingy, I posted a comment on your MS Office x64 Uploaded: 2010-09-14 15:02:16 GMT because after working perfectly for a few months, it is now show ""Product Activation Failed"". I first tried the permanent activation posted 2010-09-21 10:28 CET, but it didn't work. I tried the activator you listed from the same uploaded page, but it didn't work as well.  Can you offer some help?  Thanks in advance."
[V],thethingy,2010-10-03T21:57Z,"1BigBadWolf, use the first one and run it as admin (vista/7) and select rearm then install kms then activate."

,shafta132,2010-10-08T03:47Z,"Thanks thethingy another top upload.
I have 1 problem. I installed everything with the internet off and all seems to work properly, however, Expression Web 4 will not work. 
When I try to open it, it says Expression Web 4 has stopped working. Then microsoft is looking for a solution to this etc.
Do you know why this is happening? Any solutions? Thanks in advance."
,shafta132,2010-10-08T08:05Z,"@thethingy, ignore post above apart from the thank you's. It was kaspersky interfering with it, nothing wrong with it at all. Seems to be a common problem with kaspesky users."
,pozdnysheff,2010-10-10T10:35Z,there is an advise about KIS. You must uncheck the option Block dangerous scripts (i could mistake i have russian GUI KIS)
,shafta132,2010-10-10T16:24Z,"@pozdnysheff. Thank you that worked, unblocking dangerous scripts in web anti virus. I found out later the 2011 version of kis has a fix so upgraded and no more problems."
,AlefSin,2010-10-22T18:01Z,"Thanks it installs and runs with no problem. However, it seems it is the academic version since Expression Encoder says it comes with no codecs (look at help/about). I have searched a bit and it seems that because of licensing problems, the academic version if the ""ultimate"" studio does not have H.264 and some other codecs but the retail version does. Unfortunately it seems all other versions available here have the same problem. "
[V],thethingy,2010-10-23T09:11Z,"AlefSin, codecs are add ons you get them free from ms"
,AlefSin,2010-10-23T20:18Z,"It is not the same thing. For example Windows 7 can playback H.264 files by default as it comes with the needed codecs but still Expression Encoder says it cannot create .mp4 files because codecs are missing. I suspect is it more than the windows codes and some components of the Expression Encoder are missing/inactive. Here is an answer a MS employee gave on a forum about this problem: ""Thanks for your interest in Expression Encoder.  We have two version of Expression Encoder 4: The first is included in Expression Ultimate purchased through volume licensing, MSDN, and Bizspark, and does not include royalty-bearing codecs.  The second version is included in Expression Ultimate purchased through retail channels, and does include the codecs. The reason for needing two product versions is due to codec redistribution and reporting requirements."""
[V],thethingy,2010-10-25T09:26Z,"AlefSin, you can still get the codecs though so it is the same thing, try k-lite, also install the sp;

,pjp_76,2010-10-26T22:07Z,"@DUBLIN5: You see, the main problem is that u r using an obsolete Operating System. I don't think that Expression 4 was developed with Win XP in mind."
[V],thethingy,2010-10-26T23:25Z,"pjp_76, Dubs is just a troll he posts ""dont work"" on lots of torrents, if you look on my 64bit office 2010 torrent you'll see he cant get it to work with 32bit windows, he's Irish they are known retards. "
,CreativeProducts,2010-10-27T16:39Z,Works. Get a life trolls :D
,AlefSin,2010-10-28T00:53Z,"@thethingy: I really appreciate that you are taking time to answer all these comments. However, I have already installed that service pack and still Expression Encoder refuses to open mpeg-2 files or create .mp4 files stating codecs are missing. The ""about"" screen also still says ""Expression Encoder Pro (without codecs)"". As mentioned before, apparently it is by design so any future service pack would also not fix it. The only is to get a hold on a retail version of the Ultimate version."
[V],thethingy,2010-10-28T02:38Z,"AlefSin, why dont you just ad a codec pack?, troll through the expression download site, also did you install the complete app cause I can open mpeg-2"
,ShadowMastr,2010-10-28T03:36Z,"Worked fine for me. I installed .net 4 before installing this, all went well.

Thanks, another great upload!"
,AlefSin,2010-10-29T13:14Z,"@thethingy: I do have a codec pack! I have the full K-Lite codec pack installed. I can make .mp4 with all other programs it is only Expression Encoder Pro 4 that cannot do it. It uses its own internal codecs. Check the about screen and no matter what codecs you have installed in the system, the Ultimate MSDNAA or the academic version says ""without codecs"". Again, as mentioned before Microsoft confirms that there are two Ultimate versions out there and only the retail version comes with all codecs. "
,AlefSin,2010-10-29T13:23Z,"To make it clear, here is what I have installed: Expression Studio 4 Ultimate (full install), Expression Studio SP1, latest K-lite codec pack. Problem: when you select .mp4 as the output format in the Encode optoins tab, you get a popup window saying: ""this functionality is only available in the fully-featured Expression Encoder Pro"". Reason? According to microsoft, only the retail version of the Ultimate has this functionality and on the other versions (academic, MSDNAA, etc.) it is disabled."
,jcmphoto,2011-01-10T06:48Z,Great upload. One small issue. The main reason ffor downloading this was for the Expression Screen Capture. It won't let me record more than 10 minutes. It says i need to buy full version after that. Help? Everything else seems to work very nicely!!!
,ProphetFromArcania,2011-04-08T18:27Z,"Can you help!? I got this warning when I went to start Expression Web 4:

""You have 0 [zero] days left to active your Expression product.  You must activate your product now.""

I originally started with the trial version many months ago.  I downloaded [thethingy]'s torrent (thank you btw). I clicked the ""Activate product now"" radio button but it says the product is already activated, then it shuts down. I uninstalled and re-installed. However, I got this same activation prompt when I started the program, and still it says ""Already activated"" and it shuts down immediately.

How can I activate this product?"
,smokerdalejash,2011-04-20T08:39Z,wow. AMAZING program. thanks so much for the upload i will remember to download from you 
,Gibbster01,2011-05-01T01:50Z,I download it and installed it but the only program on the computer is Expression Blend 4 + Sketch Flow and activation programs too. I have been having this problem on the one on there website the same thing happens. Can someone help me out?
,anirudh786,2011-06-07T10:53Z,Can anyone Explain @promodsharma that MICROSOFT EXPRESSION STUDIO is totally different from Dreamviewer. BTW thanks Thing
,L3GiTPro,2011-09-20T02:29Z,I don't think it is activated anymore.  I recorded a video and I opened it up with the encoder and selected the format of mp4 and it said that it was only available in the full purchase of the Encoder Pro.  Do you have a serials?
,chicken_3,2011-09-20T03:12Z,Thanks thethingy.  Fantastic release as always.
,irfanbari,2011-09-22T12:20Z,worked fine for me. Thanks Thingy
,G-Unit_Hacker,2011-09-24T21:31Z,Sup thethingy; It's not activated for me. When i record for +10 minutes it says that only the activated version can record +10m and gives me a purchase link. Same goes for lots of stuff in every tool. It says something like 'This feature is only available in the activated version of {Tool's Name}'
,skulldragon,2011-10-17T10:16Z,"No wonder this crap doesn't work as expected, this is somekinda crippled full version wannabe only.

Don't bother downloading this crap!
Better download all tools separately instead. This is serious crap.
No wonder WU/MU won't give any updates for it. What the fuck is this really? Did you brew this on your Win 3.11 with Visual Basic for DOS? 0.o"
,Raikouho,2012-05-07T15:24Z,"Doesn't work. Had to go through the setup 3 times before anything actually installed. After installing it, was told that I had 0 days of trial left and needed to renew but it was already activated when i clicked activate."
