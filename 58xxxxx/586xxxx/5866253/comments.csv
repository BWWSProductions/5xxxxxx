,catamaranman,2010-10-16T06:16Z,"Thanks guys....been waiting for a decent copy.  I'll post back with my opinions after I watch but being an imagine release, I bet its the best out there...."
,catamaranman,2010-10-16T19:41Z,"OK....this is a decent copy quality-wise but there is at least one place (15:19) where the movie skips what is probably several minutes.  This comes at the worst possible time plot-wise and made me stop watching until I can find a decent copy.  Sorry for the bad news, but the missing part(s) ruined this copy for me. Guess I'm still waiting....  "
,catamaranman,2010-10-17T08:44Z,OK so it's missing More than a few minutes...25min 15sec are missing from probably the most important part of the movie.....come on guys!  This is the best quality copy but its missing like 25% of the movie!  Why even upload this?!?
,NodesOfRanvier,2010-10-19T17:37Z,"Ok here's how it goes.. gets up to around the 15 min. mark then jumps ahead like 15 or so min... but after a few minutes in ""the future"" it jumps back to the original point it skipped ahead at and continues.

I never finished the other cams cuz i couldn't deal with the quality but it seems the movies is all there it just skips around.

for just quality for a cam -
A- 7/10
V- 7/10"
