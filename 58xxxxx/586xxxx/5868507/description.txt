Jonathan Morgan plays a rich eccentric who opens up an amusement park called Lust World, with funding from the success of his first empire - a breakfast cereal called Anal Crunchies, somewhere on a tropical island.
It's a huge place with lots of rides and sights, but apparently is being inhibited by roaming dinosaurs who are wrecking havoc on everyone and everything.  L.S. Talbot (who wrote the script for this one) plays a news anchorman who brings us up to date with the current events on the island.  Everyone else basical y play visitors (Tina and Tony study dinosaurs, Cory and Steve are tourists, etc) while Leena plays Jonathan's girl and Jake plays some admiral/colonel who shows up when the situation gets worse.  But in the end, they are all eventually destroyed by the gigantic creatures (which are made to look gigantic by holding dinosaur figurines up close to the camera
