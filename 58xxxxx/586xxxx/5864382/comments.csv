,KeeSusie,2011-01-08T03:00Z,"Thanks so much for this! I used my HDMI cable to connect my laptop to my 42"" tv displaying on the full screen and it looked way better than I thought it would.  Obviously it's a little less clear than than it would be watching an original but to get 22 episodes into 3Gbs, it's super impressive. I also got season 2-5 from you because the quality on S1 is so high.  Thanks again, it's very much appreciated!"
,Galactigus,2011-01-31T23:29Z,"Pros: V-10|A-10 if i didn't know better i'd think i was watching the actual Dvd.

Cons: Well its not HD nor does it claim to be but it is crystal clear with great sound.

Ps. All the seasons by Riddler are the same quality and they all download extremely fast i'm already through to season 4 episode 11 and every rip so far is same and perfect."
,KeeSusie,2011-02-26T02:08Z,"Thank you very much, RiddlerA!  I had to install the free upgrade to my DivX player to the DivX plus to get the MKV files to play but I am so glad I did. Excellent quality, esp. for the file size!!  Sound was great too!  There were a few times where I'd FF or RW and the sound wouldn't match up with the video but if I closed and re-opened the movie and moved the bar to where I had left off, it would fix it.  "
,WeedPirate,2011-03-13T07:12Z,Great quality.. as usual â ă
,Bobert94976,2011-03-22T09:17Z,Please seed
,CosmAvngr,2011-03-28T05:40Z,"No surprise at this point but these are some of the best size/quality work I have seen.

They look better than the normal Xvids at less than half the size. 

Kudos Riddler. I have a low internet cap and without this kind of size, I would consider downloading. "

,RobTortureWright,2011-08-14T14:11Z,"RiddlerA You my friend produce the BEST torrents i have ever downloaded and the half or less file size makes it extremely quick to D/L.
