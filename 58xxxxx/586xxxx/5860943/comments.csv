,wira020,2010-10-15T23:10Z,"This is a good movie (not really my taste, but i did watch it to the end).. I found out that the sub's a little too early.. so I redo the sub and fixed ALL OCR error and some minor tweaks.. I synced it perfectly with the movie.. you can get it from here.. no worries about virus cause at subscene they'll put  it in .zip...

,MorbidxAngel_V2,2012-05-27T06:37Z,"Just finished watching the whole movie and loved it ""Cell Block Tango"" was definitely my favorite number.

Also I dunno if it was just me but at 2-3 points in the movie the color got really distorted and bright/off for a few seconds and cleared up. Not a big for me just a heads up for everyone else."
