IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Alpha & Omega 2010 VOBS Anton studios .................Thanks MrFreestyle
AUDIO:Alpha & Omega Audio ....................Thanks LKRG

Well here's our go at the anton studio video muxed with the only cam audio out atm.
The video was pretty good but had some colour issues,strong on the colour,lots of glares and some camera movement.
The audio....well what can we say :( Nothing special, but it's all thats out for the time being.
For the video we wrote a script to lower the chroma,increased the sharpness,make it brighter and also a rgbeq filter to correct the colours.
Oh also due to the camera movement we decided to crop to the lowest black border so you lose none of the video... so there will be borders in some parts and different sizes.
Also now and again there's some on the right and left, where the camera moves.
Once done we dropped it into vdub and used a few more filters to try and reduce the glares...
For the audio we used LKRG's synced audio... so yes it still contains spanish audio for them missing scenes... sorry folks.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
