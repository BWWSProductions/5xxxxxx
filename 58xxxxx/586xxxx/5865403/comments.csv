,BeyondMaster,2010-10-06T19:46Z,thx dude!
,ToastyP,2010-10-25T01:41Z,I think this game has compatability issues with Windows 7.  The game tries to start but crashes every time.  I bought the retail version and downloaded multiple versions and it's the same story for all of them.
,wildsnake,2010-11-25T11:48Z,ill try after downloading is done i'll comment :D

,ColdDesire,2010-12-10T17:12Z,"I can't understand how to play, because I don't have any controller (or pad). I'm only using my (Italian) keyboard:

W,A,S,D to move UP,LEFT,DOWN,RIGHT

K to JUMP/ACCEPT
J to ATTACK/CANCEL

Then?"
,dardar6t9,2010-12-19T05:17Z,Whats UAC? Why do I need to disable it? Should I disable it offline?
,binderz_00,2010-12-20T16:53Z,"Got stuck at data3. It wasn't making any progress at all. Tried it again but no avail. Moved the folder to a shorter path but still no good.

As I was trying to install this, I noticed that my pc was quite lagging. I checked the drive and to my surprise, the free space on my drive C was slowly decreasing (I was installing it on drive D). It seems that the ""installer"" is making some files on the TEMP folder.

To the uploader, you should have said it on the description that it will take up some space on drive C and how much space will it take."
,felipel0,2010-12-24T21:54Z,"Thank You, Works Great in my old Win XP.

The only problem is the cutscenes videos, everything in videos are pink, but if i try to open from the folder they are normal. Do u know what can it be?"

,kungfujoe1110,2011-05-13T01:08Z,"THIS TORRENT WORKS ON WIN7
...but not as easily as on WinXP presumably.
1) extract to a short directory (ie C:\Games)
2) in the folder that you extracted to, Shift+Right Click, and select ""open command window here""
3) type ""setup.bat"" (without quotes) and press enter.

If for whatever reason this doesn't work (it worked for me, Win7 x64), Right click setup.bat, hit compatibility, and select WinXpSP3, and repeat ALL THE STEPS (setup.bat deletes some things during install, even if the install fails).

Hope this helps :)"
,powe17,2011-05-15T20:13Z,"works fine for me, just extract and follow the orders, went quick to download and i use win 7 64-bit"

,mihai777,2011-06-07T18:35Z,how to put in fullscreen?
,Fenr1r,2011-06-26T23:40Z,"Hey, mihai77: Just press Alt+Enter and you'll get it to play in fullscreen. Also Alt+F4 to exit.
Just in case... :D

It's worked fine (Win7 x64) but the intro video is missing; the one where they tell you about the legend of Sparda. But all the other videos (possibly :P) are in it.

Good game :D
Thank you blaze69!"
