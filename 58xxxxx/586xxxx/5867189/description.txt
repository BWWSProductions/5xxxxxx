Siblings Arejay and Elizabeth "Lzzy" Hale have been actively writing and performing original music since 1998 when they were 10 and 13 years old, respectively. Both brother and sister started learning piano at the age of 5; Lzzy later progressed to a keytar and Arejay to the drums. Lzzy took guitar lessons at 16. The teen siblings released an EP called Don't Mess With the Time Man  in 2000. In Halestorm's earliest incarnation, Lzzy and Arejay's father played bass before Josh Smith joined the group in 2004. Guitarist Joe Hottinger joined in 2003.

The group signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records on June 28, 2005 and released a live EP titled One and Done. The EP, now out of print, featured an early live version of "It's Not You." Their self-titled debut album was released on April 28, 2009. The song "I Get Off" served as the album's lead single and has gained heavy radio play. Both the song and video for their second single, "It's Not You", were released in late November 2009. In early 2010, the band released a promotional music video for their song "Love/Hate Heartbreak".
