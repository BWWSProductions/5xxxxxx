Coast to Coast AM - 10-02-10 - Rogue Waves

Date: 10-02-10
Host: Ian Punnett
Guests: Susan Casey  
In the first half of the program, Ian Punnett was joined by author Susan Casey for a discussion of her book, The Wave, which examines the ocean's most monstrous walls of water, and some of the people who attempt to ride them. Casey outlined different kinds of giant waves, including tsunamis and storm waves, but focused chiefly on the mysterious and deadly rogue waves. The mechanism that generates rogue waves is largely unknown, though it is thought to involve wave-current interactions, she explained.

These freaks of nature are usually two to three times larger than the other waves around them, Casey said. Until recently, researchers did not think rogue waves were possible. In 1995, their existence could no longer be questioned after a single 84-ft wave came out of nowhere and struck an oil platform in the North Sea. Measurements made from a laser sensor on the rig confirmed the event, she noted.

Casey estimated that at least two large ships are lost to rogue waves every month, and cited several maritime disasters blamed on the phenomenon. The MS MÃ¼nchen sank with all hands in 1978 after it encountered a freak wave measuring at least 65-ft tall. British ship MV Derbyshire, lost in the South China Sea in 1980, may have been the victim of an enormous rogue wave as well, Casey continued. In 1933, the crew of the USS Ramapo came upon a wave they calculated to be 112-ft in height, she added.

Casey spoke more about the profound power of waves, as well as the seemingly insane big-wave surfers, such as Laird Hamilton, who are vying for the title of first person to ride a 100-ft wave (and the $500,000 prize that accompanies it). Several surfers report having conquered waves of that size, but no one's claim has been officially verified, she said. Casey also talked briefly about her book on great white sharks, The Devil's Teeth.

The last two hours featured Open Lines. Past Coast guest, comic book artist and writer David Mack, phoned in with an update on his latest project -- animated prequel episodes for Showtime's Dexter.

During Open Lines, George offered a special hotline for people who sleepwalk. Keith from Mississippi said his mom witnessed one of his somnambulistic episodes in which he entered the kitchen, prepared peanut butter crackers, and then went back to bed. Chuck in Levittown, Pennsylvania, told George he once dreamed he was outside at a family picnic and woke up to find himself standing on the driveway, covered in mosquito bites and locked out of his house (though he later discovered the back door was open). Chuck said he broke back into his house through the bathroom window, hit his head on the tub as he entered, and has never sleepwalked again.

An interesting call came in from Steven in Oregon, who recognized the voice of a caller on a past Coast to Coast show who spoke about being in a UFO when she was young. According to Steven, he was aboard the same craft and recalled the finger sword fight game the two played by the window of the ship. Paula, also from Oregon, remembered visiting a old cemetery in Jacksonville (Oregon) and returning home to find a mysterious set of dusty handprints on her car. Rita in Los Angeles presented two odd tales, one about a haunted radio in the Alexandria Hotel, and another about a girl with a golf ball-sized lump on her face that was filled with baby spiders.
