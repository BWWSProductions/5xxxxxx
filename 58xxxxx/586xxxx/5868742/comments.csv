,abhinav.atul,2010-10-06T17:27Z,Thanks for the up...But need some seeds.
[T],shipJ,2010-10-06T18:12Z,"?
My torrents are always seeded, in fact this had 38 seeds before being upped to this place."
,bugmeless,2010-10-06T18:50Z,"TPB is slightly broken, so it will show 0/0.  I think one of the trackers may also be slightly knackered."
,bugmeless,2010-10-06T19:10Z,"While we're at it though, can you please de-dupe the files before making the torrent?

No need to complain, guys, it's still a fantastic torrent."
,Bakerman2807,2010-10-09T04:11Z,"Maybe I'm just old and missed them over the last few weeks so can someone tell me if The Magdalena #3 and Broken Trinity - Pandora's Box #3 have been upped in the last few weeks. 
Always look forward to this great torrent, much appreciated."
[T],brodahisou,2010-10-09T17:59Z,"@ Bakerman2807

The comics you requested have yet to be scanned.  Once they are I'm sure that shipJ will upload them."
