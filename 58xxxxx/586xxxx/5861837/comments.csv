,dragonfaker,2010-10-02T12:40Z,Thanks
,Fgrade,2010-10-02T13:29Z,why are all the torrents showing 0 seeds & 0 leechs? 
,schmitty84,2010-10-02T13:59Z,That would be because the uploader isn't seeding and people can't download what isn't available. Your a goddamn genius Pyle!
,ZoeyStark,2010-10-02T17:18Z,"@Fgrade I've noticed a lot of trackers arent reporting stats lately.. the files still download quickly tho! Last week i downloaded an ep of Dexter that said 0 seeds, 0 peers, and it finished in 20 minutes.
@schmitty84 Why don't you try to download something before you start talkin shit like that. people, myself included, ARE seeding these files noob "
,schmitty84,2010-10-02T23:28Z,"Well i tried downloading it twice last night. And I'm going to assume that since I've been using this site for over two years, I know how to dl. So maybe you should learn how to seed fuckhead."
,ZoeyStark,2010-10-03T06:28Z,"I downloaded THIS file in less than 30 minutes.. i can guarantee it isn't the seeder's who are doing something wrong so it must be you! Is anyone else having problems downloading this file? or is schmitty84 just a noob who talk's shit he cant back up?? OH!! MAYBE... it could be because the damn Episode was just aired LAST NIGHT when you tried to download it ""twice"" Could that be what caused the issue?? YES!! Brand new file = VERY FEW seeders!! Use some common sense.. and try waiting a day! Geez... BTW... this ""fuckhead"" is still seeding.. the right way... Thanks EZTV!!"

Nah, i guess Schmitty84 is a fucktard that fail at life :) This torrent gives epic speed, 1,3 MB/s. So I don't know what his problem is.
Anyway,
Be a hero, Seed until u get AT LEAST 1,0 Share ratio, preferrably 2,0 or more. :)"
,schmitty84,2010-10-04T14:59Z,"Yes I do fail at life. Also the torrent does give ""epic"" speed... now. I waited to dl the following day and it was fine. It still wouldn't let me dl the day that I commented though. So, Mr. EPIC fail guy and Superdouche, which is probably Mr. EPIC fail guy's lover, notice the posts are from different dates. And I am still seeding also. My current ratio is 30.187. Oh, by the way fuckhead, very few seeders means less than 20 or so. The number I saw was zero. Zero means none not a couple. Irregardless of how new the file was there should have been at least one seed. That would be the uploader. See, the uploader has to seed for a while for others to get the complete file in order to share. Now, if he doesn't that would mean no one has the file to share and it would show ZERO. Go back to school. "
,jrod7149,2010-10-05T18:27Z,There are plenty of seeders and leechers for this torent
