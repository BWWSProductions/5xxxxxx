One contestant expresses a wish to go home this week, creating drama and tension in the house, while another group of players form a secret alliance. Trainer Bob Harper puts the contestants through a grueling workout, zeroing in on one player he thinks has shown him disrespect, and later, trainer Jillian Michaels tries to bring out the athlete in two contestants she thinks need extra attention. Tennis superstar Anna Kournikova gives all the players tennis lessons for a total body workout before a tennis ball pop challenge. Then the players are surprised by another early weigh-in, and those who fall below the yellow line face a wild elimination challenge involving 175 tons of sand before another contestant is sent home.
