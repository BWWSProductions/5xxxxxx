"The Couple in the Cave"

When the remains of a couple are discovered 
in a cave at National Park, the team must 
piece together the identity of the man and 
the woman as well as solve the crime. After 
interrogating two viable suspects, the team 
identifies the woman as a marketing 
executive who also served as her partner's 
AA sponsor, providing clues that lead them 
to expose the truth. Meanwhile, Booth's 
girlfriend and Afghanistan war 
correspondent, Hannah Burley (guest star 
Winnick), makes a surprise visit. After 
meeting Burley and sensing the couple's 
genuine happiness, Brennan re-evaluates her 
own relationship with Booth, and he tries 
to teach her that love is not always 
logical.

Enjoy :)
