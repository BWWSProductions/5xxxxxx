What do a mutt with an uncanny talent for soccer, a newly orphaned boy from America, and a soccer coach/innkeeper in Scotland have in common? The three are thrown together in Soccer Dog: European Cup when the newly orphaned Zach Connolly (Jake Thomas) shows up in Portersburg, Scotland, accompanied by a New York lawyer (Lori Heuring) who proclaims Brian MacGreggor (Nick Moran) his biological father. Brian is a somewhat irresponsible young man who's captain of the abysmal Portersburg team and owner of the Squealin' Sheep Inn--not the most likely candidate for father of the year. Enter a cute little dog, escaped experiment 020371, with an affinity for heading a soccer ball and the stage is set for sporting fun and some very hesitant bonding. While Brian and Zach struggle to get acquainted, the scheming Dr. Oddlike sets out to capture his escaped canine experiment and past team member Alex Foote, who's gone on to the major leagues, heads home to challenge the Portersburg team in a decidedly odd match. Soccer Dog: European Cup features a young orphan and a soccer-playing dog like the original Soccer Dog, but is a completely independent story with all-new characters (even the dog looks different) highlighted by some great canine soccer moves and a nice message about family.
