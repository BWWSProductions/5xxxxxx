- Two Albums -

Höyry-Kone (in English: steam engine) was a short-lived band from Finland, founded in 1991. They released only two albums. After their remarkable debut "Hyönteisiä Voi Rakastaa (Insects cannot love)" in 1995, they surpassed themselves with the mind-blowing album "Huono Parturi (the crazy barber)". Their eclectic music is a weird and defiant mixture of crimsonian guitar driven prog, salon music, operatic voice acrobatics, Klezmer influences, folk, jazz and modern pop - always well structured songs with often unexpected stylistic breaks.
They sing in their native language, but that doesn't matter at all, since it only emphasizes (at least outside of Finland) their crazy and perplexing music.

Two albums you should have heard once in your life.

1995 - Hyönteisiä Voi Rakastaa
1997 - Huono Parturi
