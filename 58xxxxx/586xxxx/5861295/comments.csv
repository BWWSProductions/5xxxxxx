,Jahorse,2010-10-11T06:33Z,Is this fake? The album was pushed back again and currently has no release date so it is impossible for this to be the retail copy. The track list is also way off from what the album's wikipedia page lists.
,bigbenwallace90,2010-11-29T15:51Z,@Jahorse yea its not 103 just a mix of mixtapes im sure some songs will be on 103 but this isnt 103
,HELskelterTER,2010-12-25T08:36Z,"Definitely NOT fake!!! This is as close as your going to get to TM103. I'm Lovin' it! 

Thanks, [NoFS] You never seize to amaze!!

I really appreciate it."
,nickzillaftw,2011-01-04T03:16Z,Not TM 103.. Sick tracklist though. This is mostly the Trap or Die 2 Mixtape.
,Vaxon,2011-01-05T12:52Z,"Not Official TM103, This is basically a compilation of music from his mixtapes, No doubt this is real jeezy just not the album"
