Operation: Payback is a bitch!


Anti-Piracy Groups Suffered DDoS Attacks
Many major anti-piracy outfits, including the RIAA, MPAA and BPI have already become targets of organized DDoS attacks. In addition, a new website was targeted last evening in another DDoS attack. ACS:Law, the British law firm hated by many, was attacked as well. Their website was taken offline couple days ago and since then keeps recovering and falling again. The â€œOperation Paybackâ€ gains momentum.

Last weekend the sites of the RIAA and MPAA saw the 4chan coordinated DDoS attacks launched by people tired of countless anti-piracy actions and trying to attract worldwide attention. While the entertaining industry was targeted over the weekend, in fact the attacks started on Friday. The first target was anti-piracy firm AiPlex Software, earlier boasting about carrying out similar attacks against incompliant BitTorrent websites. The irony is that their website proved not difficult to take down.

After those two, the third attack was carried out against the British BPI, though it was unsuccessful, and finally another wave of assaults was started. A new target was the infamous anti-piracy law firm ACS:Law, sending out thousands of notifications, asking for cash settlements from many innocent users. Considering the way they do their work, it wasnâ€™t a surprise for anyone that ACS:Law became another target. Their website was effortlessly taken down couple days ago and keeps bouncing up and down.

All the assaults were coordinated through the IRC channel. When they were preparing to attack the MPAA, the channel saw the highest number of troops ever. Nevertheless, the targeted website remained online, proving its DDoS protection.

The organizers explained that the target for the latest attack was voted on among the admins of the â€œOperation Paybackâ€. Once the results were announced, the site went down immediately.

The results of the operation are the following: although an attack against the BPI slowed their servers, it nonetheless failed to take it down. The reason was that the IRC channel people used to coordinate the attack was hacked, thus depriving them of the means of communication. That was not an isolated event â€“ at least 3 of the groupâ€™s IRC servers have been hacked.

Meanwhile, the website of the ACS:Law has been keeping recovering and being taken down again, featuring the sign â€œAccount Suspendedâ€ only.

Operation Paybackâ€™ DDoS attacks: a summary of events so far

The saga between the RIAA, MPAA, Aiplex, and Anonymous started the same way any internet war does. No, not with a flame war, but with DDoS attacks. Theyâ€™re a bit worse.

A Distributed Denial of Service floods a server or service provider with a massive amount of requests, attempting to cause malfunctions.But who started it, and whoâ€™s going to end it?

First, a little backstory: Indian software firm Aiplex was hired by the Motion Picture Association of America to help combat piracy.

The company then proceeded to launch DDoS attacks against BitTorrent sites including The Pirate Bay, temporarily causing service interruptions much to the ire of file-sharers everywhere â€” including (naturally) a web group going by the name of Anonymous, which was supposedly organized by 4chan.

The collective retaliated by launching its own batch of DDoS attacks (appropriately dubbed â€œOperation Paybackâ€) with far-reaching effects. Aiplex was a major target, and despite its experience working for Bollywood studios, it couldnâ€™t sing or dance its way out of this one; its official site is still down as of the publishing of this piece.

In addition, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) were also targeted for their attempts to impede file-sharing and protect copyrights â€“ the former getting its comeuppance for hiring Aiplex in the first place.

The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) dodged the e-bullet and, despite an attempt, was unaffected.The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft (AFACT) was targeted later, presumably for its long history of going after file-sharing sites. Unfortunately the attack had some collateral damage: 8,000 other sites collapsed briefly.

Intentional or not, itâ€™s clear 4Chan prefers carpet bombing over a precision missile strike.In other recent news, AFACT also lost a case it was pursuing against an ISP that refused to level action against its morally gray customers.

The highly-loathed legal group ACS:Law was probably hurt the most by 4chanâ€™s DDoS attacks. The firm accidentally published their entire internal email archive online while attempting to restore its website. Oops.

This volley of DDoS attacks and call to arms is pure internet spectacle (check out this open letter from 4chan leaders signed â€œAnonymousâ€), but it underscores an important issue: copyright infringement.

Pirates obviously want to retain an unfettered and more importantly free access to media, while big companies want to protect their properties and investments at any cost.

Itâ€™s the type of struggle where neither side is likely to back down, and neither is likely to â€œwin.â€ Itâ€™s true that â€œOperation Paybackâ€ is just that: a reprisal for previous DDoS attacks.

But do two wrongs make a right? Maybe if something good came of this battle, but that seems extremely unlikely.As usual, weâ€™ll continue to cover the on-going battles as they play out.

Over the last 36 hours or so, the 'Anonymous' masses and many unaffiliated sympathizers joined forces to attack the companies bringing down Pirate sites.

A coordinated and massive DDoS attack Friday and Saturday took down the websites of both the MPAA and the anti-BitTorrent AiPlex Software.

No lawyer, no injunction and no police force can stop these kind of attacks from happening and those carrying them out love the sense of power, the sense of payback they provide.

Panda Security have dubbed this weekend's attacks as "the future of cyber protests".

**At no point was i involved or agree with anything seen in the above video, i merely observed, received information & data and recorded the events.
