,lastjedi,2010-10-08T19:28Z,after downloading this i burned it to dvd-r.the video picture was great but it came out with no audio.waste of a disc.had to throw it away and look for another file to download.
,mrsillyx11,2010-10-12T23:05Z,What did you play it on ? A dvd player wont support AAC audio. Convert it to mpeg 2 with dolby digital and try it again
,Yawako,2010-10-14T08:57Z,I always use ConvertX to DVD if I want to play anything to a DVD player
,Mayenard,2010-10-16T15:12Z,I ran into some Cinavia code about 10 minutes into the movie.  I got the error 3 message preventing audio playback.
,MovieX101,2010-10-24T03:42Z,Thanks For The Up!
,scurvypirate1234,2010-10-28T02:03Z,I only get 2ch audio when playing it on a WDTV.

,thedarkrai,2010-10-30T21:29Z,"quality is nt dat awesome.....
bt still its d only 720p uncut version arnd....no complains :P"
,Ogre_25,2010-11-04T00:14Z,"I too have the Cinavia no volume at a certain part in the movie. A warning comes up saying this blah blah blah is the property of bah blah blah. Disappointing to say the least. I'll have to search for another release.
Thanks for the effort though."
,FloydT3,2010-11-07T15:35Z,Excellent...! Thanks
,fuctup.rm,2010-11-08T16:24Z,Subs for non-English parts only?
,suckitfromtheback,2010-11-19T20:04Z,@ Sephiroth878. I got the same message. I also have charter. Is it only Columbia Pictures that looks for this? 
,riggedy,2010-11-29T09:54Z,"need help.  when I exit my bittorrent program, then open it again, all the torrents that I was downloading are gone.  Anyone else experience this?  Know a fix?"
,dzver666,2010-12-03T02:37Z,"what's the exact time when cinavia appears, I checked all around 10th minute, everything is ok. Maybe is just for ps3 users? Tnx.  "
,AtotehZ,2010-12-06T07:19Z,"Regardless of what people say I think you are an inspiration, a guru and a swede that understands how frustrating it is when you look for a file and the only one to be found is a hardsubbed swesub.

Can it be made simple to hardsub without installing 3rd party software? If so that's the solution to everyones problems. I'd bet the swedes do it to be userfriendly to noobs who can't hardsub themselves before burning their dvd's"
,pedigreewolf,2010-12-14T18:54Z,dzver666 I got the cinavia message about 20 minutes in
,c3bhm,2010-12-17T08:48Z,"NO ENGLISH SUBS FOR THE SCENES SPOKEN IN CHINESE.

THAT'S LAME.

(There are English subs. for ALL of it, but that's even worse since it's so distracting to have them on all the time or to have to switch subs on for every Chinese language scene.)"
,MrOoPee69,2010-12-24T23:17Z,Very good quality! I love this movie 
,murrambingi,2011-01-03T07:02Z,"thx for the upload PetaFOX,

Great quality and good movie.

V = 9
A = 9
M = 7.5"
,PiratesArrFree,2011-01-28T13:35Z,"Hmm, Just copy the movie to a Flash Drive/ External and plug it into ur HDTV.....
Works for me..... Even works on a plasma tv from 2007"
,Headhunter_2.0,2011-02-11T10:16Z,"get all 4 here ->

,dylzy_59,2011-04-01T03:26Z,"Audio/Video: 10
Movie: An easy 9/10

The only downside, there are no english subtitles for the scenes spoken in chinese, although you still get a clear understanding of what's going on.
Downside 2: There is a justin Beiber song at the end.

Other than that, 100% Recommended, enjoy."
,spencexxx,2011-08-04T10:58Z,Is this the uncut version with the tender man-boy-love shower scene? 
,robertrmo,2011-09-21T21:48Z,"@spencexxx Yes, yes it is."
,AEsuzuki,2011-09-25T23:13Z,"Amazing quality, everything works fine including sound."
,DecoStop,2011-12-13T13:20Z,"For those who are to lazy or retarded.

With the wealth of information you have at your fingertips (the internet and school) you obviously still can't use your brain and let alone ""Use"" (Google) is common knowledge now. How hell will you find your way around?, Will you be able tell if your diploma has your name on it or will you have to ask someone else? 

Your fingers are not just stumps they are quite useful, you should try it sometime.

For all you people with broken fingers or no brain.
