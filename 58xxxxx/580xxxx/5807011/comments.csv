,Fr00zeN,2011-07-02T11:55Z,"The dillema. the recoverycds will not run on my tc1000 with ext usb cd drive.so i tried in vmware. it starts restoring process with cd 1.
then cd 2 will not be accepted stating its the wrong file.
checking this shows its the right one ive burned. anyone can make me a full backup of a successfull restore?im after months at withs end. and ive been seeding this torrent for months now. is it just me or is the 2nd disc faulty?"
,RecycledElectrons,2011-10-14T12:00Z,"Before I came here, I tried my own CD of XP Tablet, plus the TC1000's COA. Drivers were a PITA, and then it did not validate.

THANKS FOR SEEDING THIS!!! YOU ROCK!!! THE SPEED IS AMAZING!!! I wish I could seed, but my recently digitized books are my top priority.

I had all kinds of problems getting XP Tablet installed (using the English CDs.)  One program (Turbo ISO, or Magic ISO, or something) burned the CDs, but they were not bootable. Nero failed the burn every time.

I figured it out! I used Nero to burn the ""CD"" images to ""DVD-R""s but I had to tell NERO that it was burning to CDs. That worked! My TC1000 installed off the CD/DVD in the docking station like a champ. It does ask for all 3 discs when installing.

I wonder if I could combine all 3 disks into one ISO. (I've made the ISO, and burned a copy, but now that my tablet is booting, I'll leave the DVD to rot.)

Now, I'm waiting for small, slow updates. You have to wait for Windows Update to automatically do what it's going to do. You can not rush it, even with ""wuauclt.exe""

,RecycledElectrons,2011-10-14T12:02Z,"Fr00zeN, my best guess is: the second CD is not burning because it's too big for the CD. Try burning it to a DVD disc."
,rexnfx82,2012-02-29T23:39Z,Can you please reseed this file.  I'm getting a really slow D/L Speed.  THANKS!
