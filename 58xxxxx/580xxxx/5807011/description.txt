Compaq TC1000 Tablet PC Quick Restore Discs direct from the factory.

My first, well second torrent after TPB banned my account for no reason, but its all good now.

3 English ISOs
2 French ISOs

My upload speed isn't that good, but I will seed for quite a while, until there are at least 3-5 seeders. If at least one seeder doesn't show up for a few days, please leave a comment and I will seed again.

Instructions Included. If your external CD/DVD Drive doesn't work, either buy a dock or use the network restore (what I did). Network install directions included. Go to tc-one-thousand.com for more cool stuff and tutorials for your tablet pc. 

Any questions? Please comment!

Good luck!
