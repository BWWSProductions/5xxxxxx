I WILL BEGIN TO UPLOAD MARVEL/DC COMICS IN BULK.  THE DIFFERENCE....I INTEND TO UPLOAD ISSUES BY SETS AND IN NUMERICAL ORDER.  I'VE COMPILED A VAST COLLECTION, PICKING AND CHOOSING INDIVIDUAL ISSUES AND SORTING THROUGH THEM ALL IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THESE SETS.  

HOPEFULLY, THIS WILL HELP THOSE WHO HAVE MISSING ISSUES IN THEIR COLLECTIONS.

DEPENDING ON THE SUCCESS OF THIS TORRENT AND A SELECT FEW OTHER SETS....I WILL DETERMINE IF I WILL CONTINUE ON.


I'VE BEEN AN AVID COLLECTOR OF COMICS SINCE I WAS 12.  I HAVE CLOSE TO 7 THOUSAND ISSUES.  I BEGAN COMPILING COMICS DIGITALLY OVER A YEAR AGO.  KEEPS ME FROM HAVING TO CRACK OPEN A PAPER COPY OF THE SAME ISSUE....VERY CONVENIENT!






PLEASE SUPPORT YOUR COMIC INDUSTRY!! IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE...BUY THE HARD COPY!!


THANKS!
