,Clawster92,2010-09-03T15:58Z,O.o a simple thank you would be fine too btw ;)
,Mulreay,2010-09-03T21:16Z,"Ahh the old God vs Science conundrum. Thanks for the upload by the way, and quaran basher thanks for telling us so much worthy info. You should right a book or something like some guy did a few hundred years ago to create a rather fallible belief system."
,pako101,2010-09-09T00:50Z,"Downloading at the moment at 7.2kB/s from 6 seeds!!! Come on people seed at a decent rate! Oh by the way I agree with Mulreay all the way, get a life khurram96, one question , just because islam tells you how do you know allah didnt evolve you from monkeys? I'd say that the islamic world is in a little turmoil for all their beliefs."
,Clawster92,2010-09-09T05:43Z,"Well, it is 109 Seeds and 472 leechers, so it will take a little time, but the biggest problem is that people dosnt seed after theyre done downloading.. 

But still, i have a Ratio of 40 Now, so ill seed at a 100% rate until i have around 60, then ill start prio some of my other downloads :) -- i will still seed on this torrent ofc -- "
,pako101,2010-09-09T13:19Z,Thanks Clawster92. keep up the good work!!!
,CaptPeacock,2010-09-09T22:15Z,"A great ul!  

I have only one very minor problem.  There are many times the vanity card at the end of the episode is cut off.    aargh!"
,Clawster92,2010-09-10T01:31Z,Vanity Card?
,retpally86,2010-09-26T00:36Z,"hi, Clawster! You said, ""the biggest problem is that people don't seed after they're done downloading..."" This is my first experience with torrents, and I don't want to screw it up. Will you please explain what that means? I would be very grateful! (And if I live for the next 14 hours, I'll get to watch tbbt until my eyelids freeze!) *g* Thanks in advance - for the GREAT show and for any help you can provide. : )"

P.S. The ""Vanity Card"" is the white screen at the end of each episode, written by Chuck Lorre. I am told that every one of them is different. I have not tested that hypothesis. (haha)"
,Clawster92,2010-09-29T16:24Z,hehe :) just leave the torrent active after ur done downloading:P
