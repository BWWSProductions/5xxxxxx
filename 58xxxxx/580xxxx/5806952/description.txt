Release Notes:
Seen there were no good copy's out, it was plagued with bad audio. Well my names iNK and this is what
I do, so audio problem goodbye. For shyts and giggles I even converted it into 5.1 because I don't like
to release anything less. So much had to be done to it. Removed the big "property" watermark, looks
better if your wanting to watch on a media center or the likes. Touched up the color, used a sharp
filter.. it was quite blurry, brightened it up just a tad. And wahla.. Take it or leave it //iNK
