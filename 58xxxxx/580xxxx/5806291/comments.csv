,anuzbitt,2010-09-03T07:50Z,np but it seems i fucked up the conversion :/ very low sound level indeed :( a proper release will be on soon
,flextm71,2010-09-03T17:52Z,"If the number of people downloading this show is any indication towards the ratings, there probably won't be another season of Masterchef US. That sucks, because I love anything that has Chef Ramsay in it. Can hardly wait till another season of Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares!"
,anuzbitt,2010-09-03T19:56Z,amen dude ! :D ! but im sure theres gonna be more of this masterchef since its on FOX ect and yeah anything with ramsay rulez lol :D !
