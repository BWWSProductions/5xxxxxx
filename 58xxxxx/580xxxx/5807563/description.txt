    The Anglo-Saxons - they divided our land and heralded      
    the arrival of the Dark Ages. But were they really just   
    barbarians?                                              
                                                              
    Dr Alice Roberts continues her journey through a year      
    of archaeology, visiting the key sites that are           
    throwing light on this most mysterious of periods. She   
    visits the royal seat of power at Bamburgh, Northumbria   
    and sees how the skeletons tell tales of violent death,    
    but also of tenderness.                                   
                                                             
    There's a remarkable community project in a shopping      
    centre in Sittingbourne where people are curating the      
    grave goods of their own ancestors. And there are         
    treasures that make her wonder just how dark the Dark    
    Ages really were.
