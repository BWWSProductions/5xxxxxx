From the number of uploads I see that you have not took a vacation. However I hope you had a few relaxed days.
Now I would like to ask you if it is possible to find 4 books. They are all regarding SWL radio and antenna staff so I donâ€™t know if there is a great interest from many other people.
- The first is Shortwave Listening Guide Book by Harry Helms. I search it and is in its second edition.
- The second is Passport to World Band Radio. It is an annual edition and from a search I thing 2010 is the last year they publish it.
- Owing of my poor English and because I made a search on the Net and I didnâ€™t found any book with this title, I donâ€™t know if the third is a book or other type of material so I paste the text found on the Net. (    (Popular Outdoor Antennas, Including Installation.)       One more RDI White Paper and, the only currently available material about SWL Receive Antennas! Everyone needs this booklet. There are many books available addressing the subject of antennas. But, only this one book targets SWL antennas. Most all other articles and books cover antennas from the perspective of use for transmitting. There are many differences between transmit and receive antennas. More about SWL receive antennas will be addressed later in these Tips & Tricks. For now SWL's would be very well advised to read this White Paper.)
- Last is 2009-2010 Guide To Utility Stations  by J. Klingenfuss. ( The world's best guide to non-broadcast stations in the range of 0 - 30 MHz. Aero, maritime, military, diplomatic, time stations and more. Covers SSB, CW, AM and exhaustive RTTY. Thousands of changes since last edition. We recommend this title as the very best of its type. 25th Edition. Â©December 2008. 592 pages.).
There is also World Radio TV handbook but I dont want to take advantage of your kindness.
The truth is that I just bought a second hand scanner and during the vacation I took the bug of SWL.
Thank you again for al your great material you give to all of us."
