Info:

We won't lie to you - we stopped watching Dragon Ball Z a long time ago. We're talking years ago, now. Apparently we're in the minority though, judging by the influx of Dragon Ball Z titles that have been pouring out of Japan like so much rice wine. Shin Budokai 2 returns to the fighting arenas and open landmasses of the first, and the PSP experience is surprisingly enjoyable, but pretty derivative. 

To be honest, Shin Budokai 2 is hardly a true sequel - there is a new story to play through, simply titled 'Another Road', which pits Trunks against the nefarious Dabura, the pink, horned freak with giant ears and a dastardly goatee, and eventually Majin Buu. The story branches out based on which foe you defeat and what choices you make along the way - which cities you save and how well you perform. 

At its core, combat is the focus of the game. Adventuring is just a means to an end - games like this live and die by their fighting engine. Happily, Budokai 2 takes the first game's move-sets and ups the responsiveness and flexibility. Basically, each character has a base set of moves, and these can be customised on the Boosters screen. By customising and increasing your powers, you're a little less likely to have your backside handed to you in battle - as we found after clearing the first few stages.
