In 1958 an italian archaeologist found in a cave in south-western Lybia the mummified remains of a 2 years old black baby.It was a special mummy:it was dated 1000 years before all other mummies found in Egypt.
Who were the Sahara desert inhabitants who buried the mummy? Had this people influenced the rising of the brilliant latter civilization in pharaoh land?
This is the fascinating research of prof. Savino di Lernia and his fellow workers: a tough voyage through Sahara leading to surprising conclusions.
