Alex welcomes back to the show G. Edward Griffin, film producer and author. Griffin is the 

founder of the individualist network Freedom Force International, a libertarian activist 

network. He is the author of the definitive book on the Federal Reserve, The Creature from 

Jekyll Island.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
