Osho - oshosearch.net site - complete

This is a complete oshosearch.net site.
It contains all the books on that site which is almost all the Osho books published.
This way, you can be sure no matter what happens to that site you will still have all the books locally on your computer.

You will be able to select any book and view any chapter of it, just like on the original site.

Your local site will look exactly like the original site including all the styles. You can change the way the site looks and change the background and just about anything you want by simply changing the style sheet.

You will be able to perform the searches also. Except these searches will be performed via Osho's personal search engine, which is located on oshosearch.net site. That search engine will only search the oshosearch.net site and nothing else.
The articles found during the search will be displayed from the oshosearch.net site and not from your local version. As long as that site exists, you will be able to perform all the searches from your local articles.

Just unzip the oshosearch.net.zip file. It will create the Convert directory.
To access your local site double click on index_Convert_Osho.html.
That will bring you to the top level of the site.

Enjoy now.
