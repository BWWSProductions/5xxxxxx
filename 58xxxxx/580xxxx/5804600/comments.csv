,veerenski,2010-09-02T08:06Z,"The idea is this:

You should be able to have access to anything he ever said within seconds whether you like him or hate him. Whatever could take you years, should take hours if not minutes. Just do a search on anything you want and see several versions in different places in different books.

In my opinion, this is probably the most valuable collection in the entire history, and the amount of insights it provides is well beyond comprehension.

Just don't forget to seed.
You HATE him.
- Seed.

You love him?
- Seed.

You are a scientist?
- Seed.

Corrupt politician?
- Seed.

A thief?
- Seed.

A hero?
- Seed.

A prostitute?
- Seed.

The biggest businessman the world has ever known?
- Hey, you are the right guy. Not only seed, but put some chips on the table.

Just seed. No need to screw with your brain trying to figure out this and that. It is just a hopeless exercise.

And do not ask when to stop. Some things are beyond your comprehension. Just have mercy on you.

About the only reasons NOT to seed is if you don't care or have no access to computer or your connection is so slow that it is virtually useless.

,veerenski,2010-09-02T08:37Z,"The amount of research being done right now on Osho is simply mind boggling. Never seen anything like this in my life. Could not even comprehend anything like this is even possible. Good.

If you want to criticize him, you can do the most extensive research and it will take you hours to get anything you want on him. Write it all out and publish it.

If you want to write the most outstanding article as his lover, hey, you've got enough information to do that.

Osho's search engine on http://oshosearch.net is one of the most powerful engines out there. So you can do phrase searches and things like that. Just type whatever question you have and hit the Search button. All standard search engine operations are supported.

The clock is ticking really fast right now. Whatever you could afford to spend YEARS on, you can no longer afford.

Osho says: ""Do not just do something, SIT there"". True. And I say, ""Do not just sit on your energy waiting for some miracle to appear out of nowhere, DO something, even if you do not think your contribution is 'that great'"". Because, how do you know? May be it is greater than you suspected? May be you condemned yourself too much? May be you compared yourself with all the idols that only exist in some movie? I am yet to see someone who when tried something authentically was ""dead wrong""."
,HeyNonnyNonnyNonnyMus,2010-09-10T21:32Z,"Osho was formerly known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his teachings led members of his cult to poison over 700 people in The Dalles, OR in 1984.  He changed his name after he was deported from the U.S., but his teachings are the same - dangerous and insane.  "
