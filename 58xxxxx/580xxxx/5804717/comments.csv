,Sigbintoy,2010-09-14T18:04Z,may i ask why there is an error when I play the exe file
,wobeiteng,2010-11-24T13:27Z,"this game is either completly borken or its still in development, i played previous UFO Aftermath, worked fine.

Bought aftershock, but not even retail cd seems to be working on windows 7 ultimate, tried all compability modes and of course running it as admin. there is error regardless of what i try... if anyone has some feedback on this, i would greatly appreciate."
,Mutad0r,2011-01-17T14:14Z,"Worst torrent ever. can't install patches, because the game is not installed ( you copy it ), and the screen resolution max is 1024x768 ( which normally wouldn't be a problem, but atleast for me, it doesn't try to fit it to the screen. it just has the game in a tiny box in the center. )"
