UFO: Aftershock is the sequel to the highly successful 2003 title UFO: Aftermath and follows directly from one of the endings of the first title, where the player agrees to hand over the Earth to the Alien scientists, who are trying to change the planet into a giant living organism. The Council of Earth and their followers take refuge on an orbiting satellite prepared for them by the aliens, but not all the survivors of the original invasion were re-located.

The game starts after many years in their new home, with no sign of the aliens and a failing life support system--the player must find out what happened to the Earth, the people left behind on the surface and the new visitors.

UFO: Aftershock is a mixture of squad based tactical action and global strategy with the gamer controlling the actions of elite ground troops, and the running and construction of an intricate network of interlinking bases.
