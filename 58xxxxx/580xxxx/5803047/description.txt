Superman: Secret Origin is a six-issue monthly comic book limited series written by Geoff Johns (The Flash, Green Lantern) and illustrated by Gary Frank (The Incredible Hulk). The story features what Johns and DC Executive Editor Dan DiDio are calling a "definitive" telling of the origin story of Superman, dealing with his early life in Smallville, his first adventure with the Legion of Super-Heroes, his brief friendship and eventual bitter rivalry with Lex Luthor, and his arrival in Metropolis and at the Daily Planet.
