This two-disc set was released in 1995 following the death of drummer Connie Kay, and it's a superb commemoration of the Modern Jazz Quartet at their creative peak, a 1960 concert in Ljubljana, Slovenia, from the same tour that produced the equally memorable European Concert. By 1960, the group had gelled superbly, and much of their essential, original repertoire was in place, including John Lewis's composition "Odds Against Tomorrow," the moody and profound theme from a film score, and the light, baroque-influenced pieces "Colombine" and "Pulcinella." What stands out is the acute consciousness of sound, in Kay's sparkling drumming and Percy Heath's warmly resonant bass, as well as Lewis's piano and Milt Jackson's vibraphone. There's a superb economy of means practiced by the entire band, with scarcely a superfluous note in the two hours of music heard here. The treatments of standards are as memorable as the originals. ~ Stuart Broomer 

This excellent 2-CD set provides an invaluable record of what the Modern Jazz Quartet sounded like at the height of their powers and under circumstances that must have been close to ideal: performing live in concert before an appreciative but discriminating audience. Fortunately, they were also blessed, on this occasion, with very good acoustics and a talented recording engineer. The resulting document is monaural, but it has terrific clarity, warmth, and presence. 

All in all, this is probably the best representation of what the Modern Jazz Quartet was all about that is currently available. ("European Concert," which was recorded during the same tour, is also extremely good, though not quite as comprehensive; unfortunately, it is currently out of print.) ~ Buddy Bolden
