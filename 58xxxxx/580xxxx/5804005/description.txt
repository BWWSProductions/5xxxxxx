           In Blythe, California, a small town in the remote              
           California desert, Ethan Inglebrink is an eccentric,           
           agoraphobic heroin addict who is obsessed with his             
           garden. This dark comedy follows the last days of Ethan's      
           life as he struggles to find purpose at a time when it         
           might be too late to even matter. After convincing his         
           senior poker buddies that he is diabetic, in order to          
           explain his frequent use of syringes, Ethan shoots up          
           while trying to win poker money to fund his gardening          
           hobby and drug use. Nearing eviction, Ethan gardens            
           furiously in hopes of winning the $10,000 first prize in       
           the "Garden of the Year" contest so he can pay his             
           delinquent rent. Between sugar-munching binges and             
           exchanges with a motley crew of neighbors, Ethan tries to      
           grow the perfect "American cowslip", a beautiful, rare         
           flower that will be the centerpiece of his garden and the      
           floral representation of his life. When his efforts are        
           thwarted by his landlord/high school football coach/next       
           door neighbor, Trevor O'Hart, Ethan faces eviction and         
           the loss of his beloved garden, his sanity and the             
           camaraderie he shares with his best friend and poker           
           buddy, Roe. Believing he has finally found true love,          
           Ethan unknowingly expedites his own demise when he             
           reciprocates the affections of Georgia, a beautiful            
           seventeen-year old girl who lives across the street and        
           dreams of leaving Blythe and her abusive father behind.        
           Head to head in a hilarious battle of the gardens with         
           Trevor, Ethan must rise to the occasion and fix the life       
           that he has screwed up so badly and save Georgia. With a       
           seemingly subconscious awareness of his impending death,       
           he decides that if he's going down, then he's going down       
           in style.
