,DrAnal,2010-09-03T11:29Z,"other than a slow upload speed, seems to be working and I'm showing 1.001 available.  Thanks so much for this."
,ninjacaity,2010-09-03T15:08Z,"oh good :) sorry its so slow, but i cant leave it seeding all the time. ill seed as much as i can though, so weekends should be steady"
,ninjacaity,2010-09-03T15:14Z,yeah sorry about the speed. my computers very up and down with that -_- um atm the seeding wont be consistent but im trying to fix that so i can seed all the time
,ninjacaity,2010-09-03T15:26Z,does anyone know how 2 move a torrent and keep seeding?
,ninjacaity,2010-09-03T15:37Z,nm ive got it seeding again. its 2 slow though my internets supposed 2 be fast -_- sorry about that
,ninjacaity,2010-10-08T14:39Z,"Goddamnit I accidetally deleted it from my list of seeding torrents -_- I have absolutely no idea if that affects anything (I put it back, but the availability is back to 1), but if it's screwed things up then I'm really really really sorry. :("
,ninjacaity,2010-12-07T07:08Z,"If you want it like the DVD with a menu and everything, you'll need to buy or burn the actual DVD, or find it elsewhere. This is MP4! I ripped only the shows (main features) onto my computer in MP4 so I could watch it on my iPod, so I figured why not be nice and share it with everyone else."
,PNBeast,2012-04-16T16:07Z,"I loved Firefly, and I can't wait to re-watch it after years! Can everyone seed, please?"
,ninjacaity,2012-04-21T05:54Z,"I'm afraid my laptop's pretty much dead now, so I've lost the actual file. I'll try recovering it as best as I can, but I think I might have to restart it..."
,ivelostit,2012-06-15T23:27Z,seed please
