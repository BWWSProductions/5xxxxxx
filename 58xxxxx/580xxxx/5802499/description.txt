BILLY IDOL
VH1 Storytellers DVD
Image Entertainment 1992

The trademark snarl and sneer are still in place, but it's a somewhat mellower, more reflective, middle-aged Billy Idol who takes center stage in this latest installment of the Storytellers series. Backed by a band including longtime cohort Steve Stevens on guitar, the one-time punk pioneer works his way through 15 songs (among which are 8 that didn't make the original cable broadcast, including a superb reading of "Eyes Without a Face") over the course of the 104-minute concert, pausing between tunes to reflect on times that "weren't meant to be remembered," as Idol puts it. More than half the show is performed semi-acoustically; it's odd to hear the likes of "White Wedding" and "Rebel Yell" played as acoustic duets, but they work. And when Stevens brings out his electric for "Dancing with Myself," "Mony Mony," and others, the joint rocks. DVD bonus features include a music-only option for those who want to forgo Billy's rap.
