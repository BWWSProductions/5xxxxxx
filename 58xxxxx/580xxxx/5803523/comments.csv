,Devilhahalo,2010-09-04T13:53Z,Fake....Very Fake...still a mystery....why it has top seeders 
,tomaskern,2010-09-05T17:10Z,Fake.  Can't get it to work in VLC or Windows Media Player.  Don't bother downloading!
,moshster,2010-09-06T02:11Z,Lots of seeds means it's probably a honey trap.  Possibly put up by Digital Playground to trap downloaders.  The adult industry has been jumping on the same anti-piracy bangwagon as mainstream Hollywood.
