,dommels,2010-10-15T12:59Z,Some one about the quality?
,dommels,2010-10-15T14:40Z,quality is minimal..
,XmufasaX,2010-10-16T08:57Z,Seed PLEASE! I'll be seeding till next month.
,XmufasaX,2010-10-16T09:00Z,">dommels
I thought the quality was quite good.
a/8
v/8"
,Delightful.Deviant,2010-11-13T09:27Z,"The video quality is awful and the sound is mediocre at best.
Looks like it was done with either a good cam or poor dvr, not the best, I will not be seeding because A) it took a lil over 6 days to download cause there was no one seeding, with good reason and B) I had to delete it, oh yeah not only crappy quality, but more than half didn't even play.

I Have Real, WMP, VLC, Video Smart & Quicktime, I tried all, I even tried converting with Prism Converter, tch, a week down the drain.
Thanks a Lot man."
,tyrael,2011-01-03T18:22Z,"thank you to the uploader: .BONE.
but for cryin out loud people, SEED it i beg you!"
,tyrael,2011-01-11T12:10Z,"however it takes an idiot who has no idea what interlacing is to apply it to downloadable content.
most of us know that interlacing has sense only on online contents and best if only with images not video...
otherwise things get fugly like this:

,rbewales,2011-04-17T19:09Z,I would really love to download this after your replies.. Thank you very much.
,rbewales,2011-04-17T19:10Z,"I am really confused with all the comments.. For all of those who finished downloading, please post your rating of its quality. I would really love to download it.. Thanks for all of the replies"
,Redt0rrent,2011-04-21T22:33Z,This is dead. Love the fuzzy then stop working. Not reccomended
,rbewales,2011-04-23T03:52Z,the torrent is best downloaded with Vuze.
,useitright,2011-04-29T10:25Z,I would just like to say that this is the most under-seeded torrent I have yet to come across on this site.  I know there are millions of family guy lovers and it just kills me that there are almost 4x the amount of leechers than there are seeders......seriously dont be greedy....it is ALL based on sharing
,xushi,2011-05-11T08:49Z,"Would be so nice if the author of this torrent can give more information... codecs, ripper, etc...

Are these episodes from the TV Rips? or the DVD Rips that include scenes/episodes that were not allowed on TV ?"
,pipilapipi4,2011-05-28T01:21Z,please seed. kthxbai.
,69wangg69,2011-06-03T08:08Z,Please Seed. How's the quality?

,noeldiego,2011-07-13T05:43Z,"The quality is ok, till now. I found two episodes from the fourth season that are, both, in crappy quality (grainy and with low quality sound). But the overall is good (from S01E01 till S04E014)"
,ccp041985,2011-08-01T19:21Z,"i love that for years p2p has been going there are still some people that bother saying ""please seed"" i learnt long ago that its a waste of time asking.so should all of you"
,ilovethacks,2011-09-06T15:23Z,please seed!
,SyphruM,2011-09-07T22:13Z,IF you guys were smart you'd download only 1 episode from each season and see the quality and mostly if it even works overall for your self. :|
,XWinderI,2011-09-18T14:37Z,"please seed! :D

thanks for the upload man"
,stevieb,2011-09-26T20:50Z,thanx :D
,icewolf72,2011-09-28T03:40Z,"If it's bad quality then why didn't you downrate it? oh, and you DO know this is a cartoon right? Last thing I care about is picture quality, or even audio sync."

,BlackSam7,2011-10-21T14:12Z,"THANKS A LOT! It took like 4 days to download at 1mbps connection. I downloaded every season except 8. Season 1 to 7 quality is really good :) dont know what other people say. Simply a perfect torrent! it has some movie and a special episode...!
I reccomend downloading this!"
,TyMod,2011-10-21T23:27Z,"Pretty solid collection.  Downloading really fast for its file size.  (1.5mbps to 2) Only complaint is some of the vids have odd cropping which comes in and then dissappears.  Other than that its a nice DVD rip.  (It's a cartoon, not a movie so I am not complaing, just letting others know they might see some weird cropping around the edges.)

Thanks a ton man.  I know this was a hard collection to get so thanks a ton.

DVD Quality V10 A10"
,TyMod,2011-10-22T01:03Z,"Just wanted to say not DVD rip but some Canadian and Fox TV rip which sucks because they are censored....  I guess if you just want to watch them then download it.  Other wise download somewhere else.

Qualities still good.  Just disappointed they're not DVD rips."
,WhateverHardstyle,2011-12-23T13:12Z,"one comment: ""i love that for years p2p has been going there are still some people that bother saying ""please seed"" i learnt long ago that its a waste of time asking.so should all of you""

next comment: ""please seed!""

some people are just born epic smart apparently..."
,jackthewolffe,2011-12-28T19:32Z,"Download speed was decent. On a really good torrent I'll  get 1000kB/s, on this I was getting average 612.3kB/s. Took about a day.

Quality - certainly not perfect, but definately watchable. If you just want to watch the episodes, they're fine. If HD quality is a must, look elsewhere. But pretty good.

,lionbums,2012-01-08T18:05Z,"Okay my speed got fixed it downloaded in 6 hours at 1.8MB/s. Btw what is that extra torrent called ""Season 8"" is it a better quality of the original season 8 or is it the same exact thing? Maybe some misplaced files added or some broken files fixed? Idk please answer thanks!"
,lionbums,2012-01-08T18:05Z,Also I already uploaded 60GB at 700KB/s. 
,Lpei,2012-01-09T00:44Z,After 3 days of downloading it's at 90%.overall a nice torrent. And the video and audio quality is quite nice :) Managed to upload 5gb.
,gtg925,2012-01-26T04:32Z,I have been downloading this for over a week only at 91% WHERE ARE THE 228 SEEDERS WTF
,SkeelZ91,2012-04-03T18:02Z,"are people still complaining about seeds? you have to get a life, seriously. 
when I first downloaded the torrent, I immediately got 1.2 mb/s on a 100/100 line. Guys listen I can understand that some of you have a low broadband connection; and you don't live alone, and some of you have a cap on how much you can actually download. 
But please, remember that you're getting this for FREE. If you don't want to wait a few hours / days by leaving your PC up during the night or when you're at school, don't complain. There is always a local store next to you, you know? "
