         Brad Gluckman (Kennedy) is a wannabe rap star from      
         Malibu who acts and talks like he's from the "'hood."   
         Concerned that his son is going to embarrass him during 
         his campaign to become the governor of California,      
         Brad's wealthy father and his campaign manager          
         (Underwood), hire two Juilliard-trained actors (Diggs   
         and Anderson) to disguise themselves as "real life      
         gangstaz", and kidnap his son, dropping him off in the  
         "real hood" in Compton, in an effort to scare the       
         ghettofied attitude and behavior out of him.
