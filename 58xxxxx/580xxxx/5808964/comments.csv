,rvcybers,2010-09-04T05:18Z,@ twentyforty Trusted Hey man Ironman 2 dvd is out already. Thanks
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-04T07:26Z,"@rvcybers: I have that two like from days ago. It's a kind of ""god-knows-from-where"" DVD9 and a rip... and it's pile of shit.
I would wait for something at least - decent..."
,sanyam123,2010-09-04T07:27Z,thanks 2040:-)
,bender1110,2010-09-04T09:30Z,"yeah that ironman 2 rip is crap, its dvd but the audio is not and no subs; not to even mention its not sharp.

20/40 are you going to release any more stuff in 720p again?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-04T09:53Z,"@rvcybers: Saved by the bell. I found decent source... So, at 13:00 GMT."
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-04T10:07Z,"@bender1110: I would, but my main goal are small-sized rips for less fortunate of us. Out there are Multi-Giga rips and like zillion of 700 MB ones. Most of them are good and better than mine.
In general, DVDrip cannot be 720p, BluRay - can. 

In future, as in past few years, majority of my work would be in direction of  320p small sized rips.

On TPB I am blacklisted for promoting smaller, human acceptable sizes, but as always, minority try to dictate how it should be done - forgetting that 46% of the world have not decent and fast Internet infrastructure and that 86 PERCENT of users still pay for every byte downloaded."

,htctouch,2010-09-04T10:34Z,yeh i love ur rips maahn thr awsmmm . 320 also rocks if ripd properly like 2040 does .
,bender1110,2010-09-04T12:06Z,"ok 20/40 I understand, just that there are a few people starting to do small rips like yourself but there is hardly anybody doing small 720p rips of movies in under 700mb sizes or 720p tvshows @ 350mb (1 hour)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-04T12:58Z,"@bender1110: Pluto999 did... and few others do 720p movie rips under 600 MB. Warez sites are full of such rips.

You should re-read my first answer to you and maybe you'll figure out why am I so unwilling and why those few uploaders are ...well... discouraged.

I am called MOTHERFUCKER and attacked by idiots (some of them are uploaders of mega-giga shit) on my 720p ups more times than on all 6000+ ups combined.

However, as I said, I will continue to be versatile, by doing 720p encodings of both TV shows and BluRays - but not on the regular basis - but as before, every now and then, when I have some ""internal"" reason for doing that and be willing to eat verbal shit, endure insults and calling ""names""...

ANYONE, literary anybody can do decent H264 rip UNDER 700 MB. Well, 8 GB rips do look better, right?

I said it all."
