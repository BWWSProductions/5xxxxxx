,jamal_sherazi,2010-10-14T12:19Z,"what the fu** with zip files, u could have tell about installatio Mr."
,jamal_sherazi,2010-10-14T12:20Z,files are not completed
[T],FTVDT,2010-10-21T09:39Z,"This include all needed files.
So unrar all files separately and then you have nine rar-files (rg-setup.rar to rg-setup.r07) and unrar rg-setup.rar -file and then you'll get the setup file.
Use WinRAR, so all working fine."
,Deano019,2010-10-30T04:47Z,"WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU YOU DICKHEAD?? COULD YOU MAKE IT ANY MORE FUCKING CONFUSING DIPSHIT? GO FUCK YOURSELF ALONG WITH YOUR SOFTWARE. DON'T DOWNLOAD, IT SUCKS SHIT"
,eaglemob,2010-11-09T20:47Z,"Wtf ?? just  crap .rar files ?. Make it in one file ffs ..
Crap torrent !!! good luck who download this shit."
,setotitan,2010-11-14T19:47Z,"Agreed the file hierarchy is ridiculous, I don't understand what the point of it is. The software is solid and it's accessible it's just a little hard to get at."
,prmayner,2010-11-21T10:02Z,"thanks for the download. for you people that dont know how to install multiple rar's here's how. highlight all the rar files with the left mouse then click the right mouse and select extract here when they are extracted,go down the list opening up the files i think it's the second one down will start the install when you click setup.exe."
,conodor,2010-12-11T22:43Z,Waste of time. 
,Gazza_C,2010-12-30T12:40Z,good torrent :) thanks Uploader works fine

,creeval2,2011-01-01T18:58Z,"FUCK YOU AND YOUR CRAP TORRENT!
IT DOES NOT MERGE PARTITIONS!"
,creeval2,2011-01-01T19:11Z,"Sorry for my comment, it does merge(just another way of doing it than i was used to in other programs).

However you could have saved us alot of time by just letting us download the setup.exe and .nfo...

Again, sorry for missleading comment, it does merge, however not the way i was used too..
(guess i was pissed off by all the unpacking as well...)"
,dkyd30,2011-02-01T08:58Z,"best software.............

,Mamoon69,2011-02-24T13:27Z,"In order to extract the archive you have to select all of rar files then right-click and select extract here and repeat this procedure until the setup.exe file appears.
But I must say that whomever creates an archive like this one here has something wrong in his brain or may be a crawling bug inside that makes him split the archive several times into tiny files ."
