Ill up my upload bandwith allocation for it. 
Also, some of you downloading and wanting to play some of these older games on newer machines may need to use something like DOSBOX. Ive uploaded DOSbox 0.65 here http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/5804800/DOSBOX-0.65.5804800.TPB.torrent"
,klausIHATALO,2010-09-02T07:22Z,Those who may need it can get DOSBox via this link which will work with most 'golden oldies'
