[V],BLACKTROY,2010-09-01T16:18Z,coach544 - i don't know why you having trouble with it. just you alone. i can't help. i tested it.work perfectly
,Fuggew,2010-09-03T01:23Z,"Blacktroy, I couldn't get it to work either.  I got 5 free trials, but thats it.  Maybe there is something missing, or a dll we need to copy and paste?  "
,Fuggew,2010-09-03T01:43Z,"I commented earlier, but my comment is missing, so here it goes again.
Blacktroy, I could not get it to work either.  Keygen generates fine, but it won't give me anything more than 5 trials....
What am I doing wrong?"
,thibood,2010-09-20T23:23Z,"I found the problem, the keygen works great but you can't copy/past keys because it confounds chars ""1"" with ""l"" and ""s"" with ""5"". So, you must check keys."
,bboyxclub,2010-09-26T05:34Z,Still also a trial once I activated it. Copy and paste was not used so that is not the problem. Please can you find a solution to this? Thanks
,n8baywey,2010-10-14T17:39Z,"I've checked the crack, and it appears that, even though the serials given use ""L""s and ""S""s, when typing them into the activation dialog box and pressing enter the program converts those two letters into '1' and '5', respectively. What's the problem?"
,parlins86,2010-10-17T15:39Z,"i have done this: first i generate serial (hardware id is xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xx) and enter the serial. installation starts, then it asks for activation with serial nbr as entered and machine fingerprint number displayed like nnnn-nnnn-nnnn-7.0.
what to do next? i have tried to generate auth-key (with hardware id xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xx) but i does not work.
somebody can help?"
,parlins86,2010-10-18T13:07Z,"I found the problem. Generate a serial key repeatedly until you find one which has no ""O"" or ""S"" or ""L"". Use it and then Voila!!! it is accepted including the Activation Key and Auth-Key.

,crapmeout,2010-10-31T00:03Z,"Hey people, parlins86`s procedure is 100% correct, however PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR MACHINE ID DOES NOT HAVE L S OR O!! Also I verified it changes 3 by 7, so make sure you fixes that too! BLACKTROY rulez!"
,charles_argh,2010-11-04T02:38Z,"@parlin86: still doesn't work
Serial = M109D-DBR-KTJG-ITUD-ZM
Authentification key = D749-8835-ECD0-1871-0157-7606-803B-5403-6E0D-3AEB-84B1-B86D-50C3-90F8-F0CE and still no luck.  

No O, L or S anywhere so what's the catch?  I also checked the hardware ID and there's nothing there either.  Is it maybe because I tried electronic activation at first? 

@crapmeout: you're saying we should put 7s as 3s?  Which ones? Serial, hardware id or authitification key?"
,charles_argh,2010-11-04T02:43Z,"hum... weird, the activation didn't work but I'm not getting the 'trial version' watermark anymore so I guess it did.  Disregard last comment"
,rahsoft,2010-11-21T19:19Z,"Hi
my scanner found runtime fsg inside
anyone else have this issue ?
thanks"
,bbtrt,2010-12-31T03:40Z,Can you please upload 32 -bit version?
,heystooopid,2011-01-07T02:00Z,"If it doesnt work for you, find Nuance.PDF.Converter.Professional.v7.0.ISO-TIw - this one i guarantee it will work... it installs already patched/updated."
,photoscam,2011-01-23T17:46Z,Funky looking keygen. Where do I click on to get the authentification key? I don't see anything after I copy the Machine FingerPrint into the keygen.
,bac1,2011-03-31T13:02Z,Avira antivirus says the keygen is malware.
,mymean,2011-05-01T19:59Z,"Can someone please walk me through how to install and use the crack for this program.  I have tried several times.  BlackTroy did not leave any instructions on how to use the crack.

Thanks"
,mazda94,2011-07-10T15:22Z,"can't seem to locate keygen, does not seem to be included. Any help please"
,NewWorldOrphan9,2011-10-15T09:06Z,"@BLACKTROY, and @parlins86:

@BLACKTROY
Thanks so much  for uploading the software, nice to have in my collection of pirated shit.

@parlins86:
Also, thanks great instructions, maybe BLACKTROY can take those (if they're not Copyrighted, lmao, get it....piratebay/copyright) and add them to the .zip file as maybe a README.TXT, just a thought. The 'L', 'S', 'O' thing is stupid, I also noticed 'L' and 'I', both got converted to a '1' after copy/paste. Something ppl should know when downloading, and shouldn't have to scroll through the comments, that's just my opinion."
