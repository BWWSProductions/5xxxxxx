I see only one difference....this one is smaller by a GB or so.

Thanks!!!"
,ricksell86,2010-09-02T20:10Z,"Nothing, it's just not zipped, I've deleted duplicates and it's more organised.
Hopefully nobody will complain this time :)"
,annabelle31,2010-09-02T20:47Z,"Thanks for not zipping.

Now I could select just the few single books that interested me, instead of downloading the whole archive and tossing most of it.

And you are right: good collection and well organised."
