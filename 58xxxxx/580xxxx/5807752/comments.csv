,tjaffz,2010-09-20T02:12Z,"Keys for Office 2010 retail only works for installation - NOT for activation!
The keys are already used for activation at Microsoft and no further activations are accepted for those keys.

Guess it's working better with Office 2010 VL and volume licensing keys with KMS activator. I've not tried VL versions since I don't like the idea of KMS activator and the constant need of reactivation."
