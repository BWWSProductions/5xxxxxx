Amazing!!!! Love Stone Sour XD"
,bertvid,2010-09-12T19:46Z,Could someone please upload a full uncompressed version of this CD? Quality is not the best here.
,Sarkasmi,2010-10-03T04:54Z,"Unlike the hundreds and hundreds (over a thousand seeds) of others have done, I just gotta say:

Thank you. 

Appreciated!"
,Sarkasmi,2010-10-03T04:58Z,"bertvid, though I think the quality of this album is waaaay good enough for my standards, for anyone with a ""sharper ear"" and higher standards, it seems that here's the ""FLAC"" (Free Lossless Audio Codec) version:

,Sarkasmi,2010-10-03T05:01Z,"Oh and not that I wanna take any dloaders away from this one.. the FLAC version is after all over 500mb compared to this ""basic"" ~150mb. 

But just informing people with higher standards... 


(And to be honest, out of curiosity, I'm dloadin both, just to see if there indeed IS a difference at all :D Not trying to offend, I've never just understood what's the big fuzz about audio compression VS. lossless quality.)"
,skadragon,2010-12-06T23:45Z,FLAC = Free Lossless Audio Compression
