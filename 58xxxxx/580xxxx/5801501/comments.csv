,xiIix,2010-11-02T18:58Z,"Just have two 360's, one chipped and one not. Or buy the fucking game. I personally wait till games hit the $30-$40 mark. I refuse to pay $60 for a game unless it's EPIC. Only most awesome games are actually worth $60. The rest are SO not worth $60. Developers are getting pretentious asking for that kind of money for their shitty games. I would put Hawx down for no more than maybe $40, maybe less. It's an OK game but it's just not an experience worth $60."
