Alex talks with Paul Velte in-studio, a lawyer with a civil and criminal trial practice based in Austin, Texas. Velte is the founder of Peaceable Texans for Firearms Rights, a grassroots politically active group that began as a rally at the Texas State Capitol on President's Day, 1994. "We are citizens who are tired of the continual, piecemeal destruction of the right to own -- and use -- firearms and are doing something about it," explains the Peaceable Texans for Firearms Rights website.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
