I think that file is related to the Windows Desktop and is in the Registry. Anyway, any boot-up errors make me wonder if the O.S. is corrupted.  Is there any chance your hard drive might have bad sectors on it? To make sure my hard drives are runing their best I use SpinRite and/or Hard Drive Regenerater (sp!)- Both programs seem to do about the same thing. Sometimes such hard drive maintaince (SP!) programs can extend the life of failing hard drives, but your problem may not even be related.

I had problems installing Win-7, but I never got the error you speak of. I would consider making sure the hard drive is in the best of condition and then consider making a fresh partition and format/install of Win-7. 

But my solution above is for the worse case, if your lucky maybe a simple re-install of Win-7 may work.  Or maybe try installing the 64 or 32 bit version- which ever you have not tried (most computes built after 2004 are 64/32 bit machines and run either operating system). "

Any more I always try to run a hard drive program and re-partition and format before I install any new operating system, as sometimes what may seem to be a corrupted operating system can be in reality, a failing hard drive. At least hard drives are fairly inexpensive these days."
,MJKW2Ab,2010-09-30T03:11Z,"Well folks this version is almost a month old since install and it's allowing updates and the key # is still being recognized as Genuine Microsoft.

,bolbi6,2010-09-30T05:40Z,I downloaded this and I do not see an iso image. In fact I don't see an iso image in any folder that is suppose to contain an iso image. What's wrong with my computer?
,bolbi6,2010-09-30T08:11Z,Nevermind. When I reinstalled vista (due to a new motherboard) all of my file settings got changed from what I'm used to. Thought the .iso file was a .zip file :p
,MJKW2Ab,2010-09-30T23:09Z,"I hope this may help somebody.

This is the best version I could find and it's still working perfect and fully updated (except for Win update: KB971033 - do not install that Win-7 update unless you wish to deactivate your os!). I am having no problems running the 32 bit OS with only 512Mb ram, and it is quick when using a 16gig USB stick dedicated for ""ReadyBoost"" mode.

However I had wiped my hard drive completely bare and used SpinRite and Hard Drive Regenerator (program names) and deleted all partitions (Fdisk from XP boot Disc) before I partition and formatted. Next I found I had no way to boot to get the disc made from the ISO to run. It finally worked when using a M.S. Boot that was appended to the iso and burned again for the first pass of the installation, then on the first re-boot of the install, I had to swap out discs to the original 32 bit made ISO without the boot strap appended to it. After that little snag we had no more problems. I am very surprised the activation is still valid. 

Still 100%  Microsoft Genuine after one month after install."
,noreds23,2010-10-01T05:11Z,"Followed all steps to the T and find myself in a bit of a pickle. Downloaded the torrent, burned the .ISO to a DVD and backed up my files. Wiped all the old stuff out and went to setup where it was extracting files and got this lovely message:

Windows cannot install required files. The file may be corrupt or missing. Make sure all files required for installation are available and restart the installation. Error code: 0x80070017.

Of course, since I have already cleaned out my harddrive, I have no windows to return to and fix the problem. Any help would be massively appreciated because now I am in the dreaded cycle of Bootmgr is missing and trying to reinstall 7 and having the error pop up. Thanks for any help!"
,MJKW2Ab,2010-10-01T07:59Z,"noreds23:

I may not have the best advise, as it is late and I am tired. So, given that, I assume your BIOS is set to be looking where it should.  I believe if it was me and I had no way of booting that I would use another computer to make a Windows XP boot disc and see if you can run the install from the command prompt.. It looks like DOS, but unlike all MS and Free DOS an XP Boot Disc is compatible with the post Win98 Os. I believe it may be possible to make a WinXP boot USB memory stick too. I have not tried making a Vista nor Win-7 boot disc yet, and I admit I am totally ignorant on that.

It may be a ""in your face"" problem too, like a wrong disc or corrupted disc, as you have ruled out the hard drive as being good. Any chance the drive got formatted in Fat32? I have made that Fat-32 Format mistake more than once and sometimes you wont notice it until a reboot or a disc swap.- Keep us advised here if anything changes. I'll check back and I know there are many smarter people than me on here! Good Luck."
,MJKW2Ab,2010-10-01T08:14Z,"ATTENTION ALL HAVING PROBLEMS INSTALLING:

Microsoft has a little tool that saved my ass during my install, I do not know any other way I could of installed the Win-7 ISO without this tool:

Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool
http://store.microsoft.com/help/iso-tool

The tool, when run, will ask for the name and location of the ISO and append a self=boot to the beginning. Once the installation got done with pass 1 and rebooted I had to swap Windows 7 install disc (or USB stick) by removing the install with the MS appended boot with the disc made strictly from the ISO. Just maybe this Microsoft tool could help others to install Win-7, especially handy when having problems formatting in anything BUT Fat32 which will not work, or just can not find a method to kick start the install disc. Just remember you will likely need two Windows DVD, the pure one made from the ISO AND the first DVD which will have this Microsoft tool appended to make it boot-able until it reboots and you can swap out the disc for the pure one made from the iso.

Sorry if I am difficult to understand, as I am very sleepy.

I'll check back here again. Good luck."

I had to install from bootable flash drive as it was a netbook with no cdrom, and for anyone doing this or even booting from cd check this out.
Follow this tutorial. It uses the Windows7 USB/DVD Tool with a link to ms to get it. Couldn't believe how easy it was.
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/31541-windows-7-usb-dvd-download-tool.html
Here's the link to the tool.
http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool
When my USB stick was ready I followed this tutorial with screen shots. Can't go wrong.
http://pcsupport.about.com/od/operatingsystems/ss/windows-7-clean-install-part-1.htm
Note**On the ms page where the tool is scroll down and read the trouble shooting section. There is a bit about if you are creating a 64bit win7 install from a 32bit win7 computer you need to put the bootsect file in the USB tools folder. The bootsect.exe is in this torrent, just extract this torrent to a folder, find the bootsect.exe and copy paste into the USB/DVD Tools folder.
To boot from USB you're computer must have the ability in bios, and you must change to boot 1st from usb in bios, (when changing bios make sure you have a flash drive plugged in to usb port or you may not see the option in bios).
Once install is finished, but not fully, your computer will restart and boot from USB again and come up with option to install windows again. Take the USB out and restart. It will continue installing win7 without USB installed.
Activation is simple. Sorry for such long comment, just happy I've been helped and hope I can help someone else with this.

The Only Way Too Format It Now Is Too Put The Dvd Back Into Your Computer & Restart It & Re-Boot From The DVD And Do It All Over Again:) But It Gives You The Option To Format It By ""Drive Options"" I Do Believe :)

,5t4lk3r,2010-10-28T09:46Z,"use bootable usb to install vista or 7, thats muc better n much faster, n the other advantage is u wont get fail burning, use ultraiso to do that.

to scurken :

just make sure u dont have any partition aplied when u istall, i have same problem but it solved already, make clean install in 1 clean HD, if u want installed it in partition then repartition ur HD, then first make partition for install, the other partition u can make later after windows get installed by disk management, hope it can help, good luck to u"

,Worldtouching,2010-10-30T13:05Z,"Hi Computer user. 
Just want to say thx for the upload. You deserve credit for this(these) as well as the way you reply comments. As it turned out I didnt need any support, but this was probably mainly due to the fact that I just read the whole thread a couple of times before installing. But the main reason I chose your version was that I knew the support was there just in case. 
I have a question though. A friend of mine suggested that I should choose home premium because it doesnt have the heavy network components Ultimate has, and therefore would boot and run a bit faster. Still I did end up with chosing Ultima x86 due to some other factors. But can you give me your opinion on this? Would it mean a big difference? In case it matters the specs on my ASUS 1201T are 1.6 AMD processor 2Gb DDR800 Ram."

Since Your Computer Specs Are,

ASUS 1201T are 1.6 AMD processor 2Gb DDR800 Ram.

Great Mother Board, Lovely Processor, And Good R.A.M.

With The Amount Of R.A.M. You Have I Would Have Went With Home Premium Myself, But Yes Ultimate Really Does Have Alot More Built In Software & Programs. If You Have 1 GB Or More In R.A.M. I Would Reccomend You Using Any (64 Bit) Operating System. I Do Believe Your Processor Is Capable Of Doing That, If It Isn't, Befor Installation, Windows System Installation Will Let You Know Your Hardware Isn't x64 Compatable :)

,combs84,2010-11-01T23:17Z,"Hello, first off great upload.  Worked great for me after I sorted out a few cpu issues.  Finally off crappy Vista.

But I have a major problem after the upload, there is no option to use wireless internet.  Only local connection works.  I try to go to the device manager to find it under Network Adapters and the only one there is the Realtek RTL8101E PCI-E Fast Ethernet NIC.

No wireless adapter.

Also under it, under ""other devices"" it shows ""ethernet Controller"" and it shows it has no drivers for it, which I'm not sure is what is causing a problem.

i have tried going to the gateway site and installing their drivers, and it's not working, I still can't even get the system to recognize it. 

My model number is Gateway M-6750.  You know what my operation system is obviously =).  Do you have ANY idea what is causing this and how I can hopefully easily fix it??

Thanks so much for any help..."

My question is: when I burnt the ZIP/ISO that says ""Windows 7 32Bit"", should I have burnt the WHOLE files and folders to the same DVD or just the ZIP/ISO file as mentioned???

The Activator I burnt on a seperate CD.

You Only Need To Burn The .ISO File To The DVD :)

If You Burn More Than The .ISO File, The Windows Installation Will Not Work Right :)

If You Didn't See The Section Where You Can Format Your Hard Drive, Then You Must Have Done The Windows Installation From The Desktop, Make Sure You Have The DVD In The DVD-ROM Drive & Restart Your Computer, Do Need To Do Installation From There :)

but i do have a real serious question to ask. Isn't it better to turn off the automatic updates? i mean one way or another microsoft will release an update to check the copy is genuine or not (like the update KB971033) and what are the pros and cons of it (disabling automatic updates)?

and if they did find out that my copy is pirated one what would i have to do after that? will i have to reinstall windows again? 

once again thanks for this wonderful torrent!"

Yes It's Safe To Upgrade, I Don't Have An August Release At All :) But I Do Have Many September & 2 November Releases :)

With The Information That You Told Me, It Sounds Like You Burned The .ISO Correctly. What Speed Did You Actually Burn It With? Sometimes You Can Pick Between 1x - 4x But The Speed Depends On What Brand Of DVD That You Buy.

Also Make Sure That Your Bios Settings Are Set Right, Your DVD Drive MUST Be Set To Boot B 4 Your Hard Drive, Since Your Hard Drive IS BRAND NEW That Is Why You're Getting That Message. :)"

So You Have Installed This Torrent Right? Windows 7 Ultimate 32 Bit?

You Don't Need To Do Anything With The ""Keys"" .TXT Document, Keep The ""Activation Program"" With The Keys .TXT Document At All Times, If You Don't Have It Like That, That Is Prob Why Activation Is Not Working :)

Yes English Is The Default Microsoft Language, If You Need Or Want More Than English, You Can Download & Install Language Packs Using Microsoft Updates :)

Look At The Top Left Corner, Click On ""View Installed Updates""

Find That Windows Update, And Right Click On It & Click On ""Uninstall"" :) :)

When You Used The Activation Program, Did It Tell You That Windows Activation Was Successfull?

You Were Not Suppost To Extract Anything, The File Named ""Windows 7 Ultimate (32 Bit)"" Is THE .ISO File :)

I hace ben using it for a couple of months now on my laptop with NO issues whatsoever.  If you are having problems it is definitely on you and not the uploader.  Simply burn iso, boot to disc, format hdd, and install.  I keep an eye on the updates looking for ""genuine"" software and block them, but I don't even think that is really necessary thanks to the activator included in ""My Documents"" after the install.  I'm even using MS Essentials (the new AVG is too slow).  Thanks again uploader, you're a life saver!"

,toti_rulz,2010-12-13T19:14Z,"Microsoft clarified that all versions of Windows, both legitimate and illegitimate, receive security updates â€“ and that policy will carry over to Windows 7.
Makes good business sense. If Microsoft did not do the updates, hordes of illegal versions of Microsoft Windows would be infected and used for attacks against legitimate user's computers. This would make for a PR nightmare. Better to be on offense than defense, and certainly ensuring that ALL copies of Windows are as protected from virus' as is possible is a good offensive tactic that will pay great dividends in their defense of legitimate users. Since all updates cost Microsoft the same amount of money, no matter how many computers get updated, the only additional cost to Microsoft is the bandwidth and the extreme minority of illegitimate users who would go out and buy the software for the updates.
Microsoft as a whole is a really good company. My only real complaint is Vista, and it looks like they are going an extra mile to clean it up and repackage it as Windows 7. An easy way to remove the nagging ""are you sure"" pop-ups without significantly affecting my security would be very welcome and actually be the straw that tipped my purchase decision into their favor. I know how to turn off UAC, but UAC is not the only annoying pop-up. There are also the ""Downloaded from internet"" ""The unknown publisher ""Microsoft"""", and a couple more I am not remember exactly at the moment.

,Mephisto90,2010-12-18T17:52Z,"Yes, it's probably a noobish question, but how should I burn the .iso file? I mean, I'm using BurnAware, so should I simply burn it using the ""Data DVD"" option, or the ""Boot Disc"" option? And is it a ""bootable"" .iso, or should I unpack it and make a boot image?

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I'm always a little skeptical about these things. And this is the first time I'm downloading Windows, so...

Thanks in advance!"

,youregay3,2010-12-19T00:51Z,Hey I was wondering if I am able to reformat my computer with this?
,ghost0308,2010-12-19T01:27Z,"Hi again Computer_User,
Well I've been using this OS for nearly 2 months now and everything works fine as expected from you.  I have something very curious to share with you and would like your opinion please. The subject is regarding the KB971033. Today I was looking at these new posts and went to my OS and looked at the installed updates from Microsoft just to make sure that I did not install it by mistake. You will not believe if I tell you that I actually found out that the KB971033 WAS INSTALLED in my system!!!!!! The funny thing is that nothing negative has happened to my system (I'm actually using it to write to you!) I did not get blocked or received any message from MS whatsoever!!! Everything works fine as before!!!
My questions to you are: 
1. Do we get blocked straight away right after the KB971033 is installed?
2. Since nothing happened should I still uninstall it?
3. How do I use this OS as an Upgrade from Vista rather than a clean install? (where do I start, do I have to partition, etc???)
4. Imagine someone has the license already for this OS version, during install, where do they type the serial to make it genuine? (without using your Activator obviously).
Well, thanks Computer_user for the great work and I will be very curious about your answers, especially the one relating to the KB971033.
You are the man!!!!!"
,ghost0308,2010-12-19T01:38Z,"Sorry Computer_User...me again,
I was looking at the details of that KB971033 and on my system it says that it was installed on the 12th of November 2010!!!!! That is a long time ago (one month) and NOTHING has happened!!!! What is your opinion...are you not surprised????
Cheers!!!!"
,ghost0308,2010-12-19T03:48Z,"One last question, please: I read in one of your posts that when we burn the Activator onto a seperate CD (like I did), you mentioned to keep the ""keys"" file in the same folder as the Activator.
I remember that when I burnt the Activator using ImageBurn, I only chose and clicked on the activator and did not click ALSO on the ""keys"" file to be copied to the CD. Did I do this correctly? The activator seems to be working fine because this is the 2nd OS from you that I install (I also installed XP Pro) using the same Activator and at the time of activation it said ""Successful"". Does this mean the Activator is working fine? 
Thanks once again Computer_User......."

,ghost0308,2010-12-23T20:28Z,"Computer_User, first of all I want to share with you and with the rest of all downloaders that I have never in my time of using TPB met any uploader that has dedicated so much of his time giving others free, clean and trustable software as you do. Also, I have never in my use of TPB have met any uploader that gives so much technical support to everyone as you do. Please let me know how can I rate you or help you in any way for you to receive another well deserved SKULL.
2 questions please:
1. Does your Activator that you uploaded in September still work with all the December versions AND with all the other Microsoft OS?
2. Regarding your last reply to me concerning using a genuine valid key without the Activator: Do I only have the option to write the genuine serial if I DO NOT use your activator? (ie: I used your Activator and went to Computer, etc as you told me and it did not have a space to enter the genuine key...this is because I used your Activator isn't it? If I did not use the Activator there then woul be a space for me to insert a genuine key? Is this correct?

I tried installing it from a USB, but without surprise, find out that BootCamp had an issue with that too.

Finally got it working once I installed my legit disc for Vista, then started the installer from inside vista. 

Anyone else have an issue with the image on a disc through Bootcamp?
