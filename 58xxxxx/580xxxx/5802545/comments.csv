,killbush,2010-09-12T00:24Z,I nearly vomited just reading the synopsis. Kudos to anyone who can actually watch this drivel without barfing.
,aibrean1978,2010-09-20T23:47Z,can anyone find good subtitles for this movie (english)??? the one included and the one on opensubtitles don't actually translate what the parents are saying. it's more like closed-captioning display of what sounds are happening.
,phishvideos,2010-11-17T05:00Z,"I received an email from my ISP regarding ""Infringement of NBC Universal Properties"" for having this torrent running for about 10 hours.  I have now updated my IPfilter.dat and I recommend you do the same.  Apparently they give two shits about this movie which is 1.5 shits more than I do.  "

I tried leaving several comments, they are not going through.."
,grandmasdiary,2011-02-27T16:12Z,"This is the lamest, cliche ridden movie ever made.
My wife (a documentary film maker) uses this with production companies to show them what kind of movie she refuses to make.

BTW, this was a French production, and as an American living in France, I can see how the filmmakers, in very small ways, are showing their anti-American bent.

Notice how the American family seems overly occupied with hygiene? How there's a certain detachment, a sterility, in the ""family unit""? Not much playfulness? Did any of you laugh with affection while watching the Americans? But we all did with the others, right?

They tried to represent the Americans as wholly ""American,"" but those same types of ""cold"" scenes play out in Western Europe, too. 

So why chose an American family, and not a European one? Partly because there's no market in Europe for ""cutesy baby"" movies, but also because because that ""cold detachment"" might hit too close to home if they had used a French or British family. 

They would rather ""tsk tsk"" at the Americans in the hospital than admit that it's the same darn way over here."
,fklammer,2011-04-25T12:02Z,"@grandmasdiary:

Calm down and relax. The American family could as well be any family in the western world. I've seen this film a few months ago when it was released, and honestly I tough they were Canadian. So much for anti-American film...

Go out a bit more and get some fresh air, everything is fine and Americans are great."
