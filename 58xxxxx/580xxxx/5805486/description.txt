No famous guest stars here, but it's still a 
well-acted story. Noteable character actors 
making brief appearances at the beginning are 
Burt Mustin (as the elderly prisoner) and 
Paul Comi (as the prison warden).

According to my episode guide, this is the 
final appearance of Deputy Emmett Ryker since 
Clu Gulager for whatever reason left the show.
Ryker has very little to do in this episode though.
