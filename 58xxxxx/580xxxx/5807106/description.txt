FLAWL3SS NOTES
Thanks to Imagine for the source files. We know there is a whole bunch of them but people asked for this one here it is. Work done our usual Brightness, Contrast Black levels, Saturation, Sharpness also blurred the watermark in the left hand corner instead of cropping it out. Also the other encodes by other groups cropped it out then they didn't even bother to resize to correct AR hence all these 292
resolutions and 2.5 ar. Enjoy this real release the way it was suppose to be encoded. Hope you all enjoy from team FLAWL3SS.

credit FLAWL3SS & BDK & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
