"Shoot to Thrill" is the second song on the album Back in Black by hard rock band AC/DC. This song is also the second track of AC/DC Live and AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition, and is included on AC/DC: Iron Man 2.

Back in Black is a hard rock album by Australian band AC/DC. It is the seventh Australian and sixth internationally released studio album by the band.

Released on 25 July 1980, Back in Black was the first AC/DC album recorded without former lead singer Bon Scott, who died on 19 February 1980 at the age of 33, and was dedicated to him. The band considered disbanding following Scott's death, but they ultimately decided to continue and shortly thereafter hired Brian Johnson as their new lead singer and lyricist. Producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange, who had previously worked with AC/DC on Highway to Hell, was again brought in to produce. The recordings were made at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, and Electric Lady Studios in New York, where the album was also mixed.

The album was remastered and re-released in 1994, then again in the Bonfire box set in 1997, and as part of the AC/DC remasters series in 2003 by George Marino. In addition, a Dualdisc version was released in 2004, featuring the album in enhanced LPCM Stereo format and the video documentary The Story of Back in Black.

The album has sold an estimated 49 million copies worldwide to date, making it the second highest selling album of all time, and the best selling hard rock or heavy metal album, as well as the best selling album ever released by a band. On 13 December 2007, the RIAA certified it 22Ã— Multi Platinum, recognising sales of 22 million in the United States.

In 1989, it was ranked No. 26 on Rolling Stone  magazine's list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80's. The song "Back in Black" was ranked number 187 on the same magazine's list of 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. VH1 also rated Back in Black one of the greatest comeback albums of all time and No. 2 on the greatest hard rock albums. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 73 on Rolling Stones's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2006, Q magazine placed the album at No. 9 in its list of "40 Best Albums of the '80s". On, July 21, 2010 93.3 WMMR Philadelphia had a poll for fans to choose which side of the vinyl they wanted played on the 30th anniversary of the album. Side 2 was chosen but due to fans' response the album was played in its entirety.

The album is the second best selling album worldwide, only behind Michael Jackson's Thriller, and the best selling album ever made by a band. The album was successful around the world, but never reached number one on the Billboard 200, making the 22x Platinum distinction, denoting 22 million  albums sold, especially unique and making it the fourth highest selling album in the U.S. The album stayed in the Billboard chart for 131 weeks. The album did reach No. 1 in the United Kingdom. In April 2010, the album re-entered the Billboard charts at No. 181.
