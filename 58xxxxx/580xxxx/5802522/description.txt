I've downloaded a lot of torrents from TPB, all were of decent quality or better. My friend(Who speaks fluent German) got me hooked on this stuff. When I wanted to download it to listen on my phone's MP3 player, I couldn't find any downloads period, which eventually forced me to shell out 10 dollars to iTunes for this one album. Might as well share it and save somebody else the money, right? Well, here you go. Music files are in .m4a format, how they came from iTunes. PLEASE SEED AND SHARE, AND KEEP IT VIRUS FREE!
