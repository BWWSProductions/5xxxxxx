If you like these songs, then please support independent artists (who are not rich and famous like so the talent behind so many other torrents on this site) and go & buy the tracks - Nataly and Jack are two _incredibly_ talented artists, who deserve the income for all their hard work..."

I've personally purchased the thumbdrive they sell with lossless copies of all of their music (it's on their web store), as well as contributed to Nataly's Kickstarter for her solo album while it was active. These people are so fucking talented and brilliant."
