This package contains the 32bit Debian / Ubuntu drivers for the Canon I_Sensys MF8000 series of Multi-function printers.


I have installed and tested both the 32bit drivers using Ubuntu 10.04LTS.
The drivers should work on any resent Debian based operating system. See the Canon website for more details.

Instructions are included in the read me files.
