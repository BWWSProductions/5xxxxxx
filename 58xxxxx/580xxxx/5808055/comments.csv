,AeQuitas69,2010-09-06T03:33Z,"Hey Red_soil. Calm down you over aggressive prick.
I love Chitto's uploads. And this worked for me for the 1st two days. 
Then, for some reason, my ""blacklist of keys is missing or corrupt"" which showed each key as blacklisted.
I had to reinstall w/ repair and roll back update. Then this was finally able to work again."
