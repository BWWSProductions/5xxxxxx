Two sisters, no love lives. Both end up dating the same man, and inviting him to meet the family on December 17th. He doesn't know there are two sisters or that he committed to two different dates on the same day.

Tia and Tamera Mowry star as twins Deanna and Danielle Warren, who, even though they may look alike, are anything but identical. When the two sisters plan their grandparents' re-commitment wedding, they start a little sibling rivalry to see who can settle down first and find the perfect boyfriend to bring to the blessed event. Soon enough, they unintentionally begin dating the same man, who believes they are one and the same person. Will true love win in this case of double trouble?
