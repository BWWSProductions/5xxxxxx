[V],wushdishmeen,2010-09-01T21:21Z,"Apologies for the hiccups during yesterday's show at the ""Footless"" movie talk and shortly after Greg Fitzsimmons ISDN interview.  I was made aware of it by some WDM members and I totally did not realize that the issue I had with bitrate yesterday translated into the show skipping like that.

I am going to fix & re-up yesterday's 8/31 show to insure a perfect archive.  Thanks for patience."
