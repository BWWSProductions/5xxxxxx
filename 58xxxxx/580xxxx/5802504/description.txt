Nitzer Ebb - Basic Pain Procedure (demo cassette 1983 )192kps


There was a terrible high pitced tone and a lot of hiss on this demo cassette found elsewhere on the interweb.

I removed it. Ahhh much better now :o) Now my ears can enjoy it.

Such a great tape! Thank you Nitzer Ebb. I love it.

(How about an official remastered release?)
