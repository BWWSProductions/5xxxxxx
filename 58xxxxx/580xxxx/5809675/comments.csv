,Ichida,2010-09-08T06:22Z,I'm running 5.50 Prometheus on a 2000 and having no problems running this; a friend of mine has the same system and firmware but his PSP shuts off starting this up. Can someone shed some light on this?
,sandman1555,2010-09-08T13:11Z,If he has the japanese translation seplugin he needs to delete it. I had this same problem then deleted plugin and works perfect.

,foolmoron,2010-09-08T16:52Z,I am on 5.50 Prometheus with NO plug-ins enabled (not even popsloader) and it works perfectly fine for me (I've only tried up to the title screen though)
,foolmoron,2010-09-08T16:59Z,Only thing is I get a 80111900 error when trying to install from the title screen... bleh
,macsharkski,2010-09-09T02:24Z,can anyone help if i cant seem to play cause when i start to open KH my psp just crash all the time help please
,leetality,2010-09-09T05:08Z,@foolmoron - I hope you aren't trying to use the 'install data' when you're already playing the game off your memory stick.. It's for UMD users.
,leetality,2010-09-09T05:09Z,"@foolmoron - ""Install Data"" is for UMD users. You don't need it when you're already playing the game off your memory stick.."
,thatpublic,2010-09-09T08:48Z,I need help. I keep getting a black screen each time i try to start it up. what do i do?
,BassNinja4,2010-09-09T09:29Z,"@thatpublic
if the game doesnt have an icon, try redownloading

but if it does, maybe you should get the prometheus 5.50 gen D3"
,okoyk,2010-09-09T14:17Z,"Icons shows up on my memory stick. (Icon says data install on it, not sure if its supposed to?)

but when i click it, it just stays completly black.

I don't know what thing i have on my psp, my friend did it for me a few years ago.."
,nerv1025,2010-09-10T01:20Z,"Works perfectly with CFW 5.00 M33-6, thanks for this! "
,gobicles,2010-09-10T12:30Z,does this work on psp 3000 with chickhen 5.03 gen c?
,GravnarWanderer,2010-09-11T01:36Z,"im gonna feel like a noob but i have to ask, 
do you have to mod your psp to play this?"
,wizardopaz,2010-09-11T07:18Z,Can I ask a question?I think I have a PSP 1000 so it won't work.Is it possible to make it PSP 2000???
,totas,2010-09-11T18:27Z,"LOL, PSP 1000 or 2000 is the model... you have to use a Custom Firmware like 5.50 GEN-D (Full) and it will work with no problem... It's like it have the 9.99 firmware... :P

If you have some trouble like black screen, for example, while using 5.50 GEN-D (Full), you have to deactivate the KBBS Plugins..."
,XxBranikanxX,2010-09-12T03:36Z,"to play this game 
1. Put it on your psp WITH custom firmware in the iso folder

2. if you have the patch file DEACTIVATE IT Hold the right trigger on start up (if it doesn't work HOLD the power button up till the screen turns off and try again) go to the plugins option and deactivate the BBS patch. (also i would deactivate any other plugins that have the [game] at the end to prevent glitches)

3. go into your games and click on the game and play, that's its

Note this is the installed data so you cant install again its fast enough loading like 1 to 2 sec loading what more can you ask for? lol"
,Yawako,2010-09-13T03:47Z,"Tested on 5.03 MHU, I only disable khbbs plugin coz Im still playing prince of persia."

,KaramjaHead,2011-06-20T15:35Z,Do i most put it on UMD disc or just on memory stick?
