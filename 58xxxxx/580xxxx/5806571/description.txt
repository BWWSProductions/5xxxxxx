A good album this from Tom McRae. A very good songwriter, as he proved with his well-crafted, self-titled debut release. The downside to his craft is though his almost extreme, whispered laid-back vocal delivery. At times you just want to kick this guy up the backside to wake him out of his self-afflicted, depressing coma he's fallen into. Like the debut, All Maps Welcome is a slit-your-wrists outing. It should really come with a Government health warning sticker on it: DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES PLAY THIS CD IF YOU SUFFER FROM ANY FORM OF DEPRESSION. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. When McRae does decide to lift the tempo, as on "Silent Boulevard", you hear not only the best track on the album, but quite possibly the best track of McRae's career to date. Tom, some advice mate: Get a life, stop feeling sorry for yourself, and open those lungs up when you sing. You know it makes sense Tom.
