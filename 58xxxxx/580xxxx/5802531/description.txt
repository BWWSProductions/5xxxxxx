  Melinda And Melinda combines romantic comedy and drama in a way 
  that Woody Allen, unique among filmmakers, likes to contrast.   
  It takes place in Manhattan and chronicles a pair of crises     
  that give reign to the talents of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Will        
  Ferrell, Jonny Lee Miller, Radha Mitchell, Amanda Peet, Chlo   
  Sevigny and Wallace Shawn. All the usual Allen areas are expla- 
  -ined - the fragility of love, marital infidelity, sophisti-    
  -cated romance, the inability to communicate. As a character in 
  the movie puts it, "He's despondent, he's desperate, he's sui-  
   -cidal. All the comic elements are in place."
