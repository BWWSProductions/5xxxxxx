Manic Street Preachers' 10th studio album Postcards From A Young Man  features guest vocals from Ian McCulloch on one track (Some Kind of Nothingness), John Cale on piano (Auto-Intoxication) and Duff McKagen playing bass (A Billion Balconies Facing The Sun). Manics bassist Nicky Wire sings lead vocals on The Future Has Been Here 4 Ever alongside drummer Sean Moore on the trumpet. Postcards From A Young Man is the follow up to 2009â€™s Journal for Plague Lovers but is musically very different and more in the vein of Send Away The Tigers and Everything Must Go  with unashamed soaring choruses, lots of strings and gospel choirs. It was recorded in Cardiff with producer Dave Eringa and mixed by Chris Lord Alge in the US.
