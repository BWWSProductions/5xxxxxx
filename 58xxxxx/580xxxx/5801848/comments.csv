,stewdavo,2010-09-23T20:20Z,"After reading the comments I'm not sure I'll bother with this one; Send Away the Tigers being a throwaway slice of badly considered fluff, how one can even consider to slice fluff, I don't know. I wonder how these commenters can claim Journal from Plague Lovers was a departure from form, they obviously have no idea what the Manic Street Preachers were and could never have considered a funeral parade for all the ignorant with The Holy Bible providing the soundtrack."
