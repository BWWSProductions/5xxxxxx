,sven_nilsson,2012-06-09T02:34Z,"Cannot recommend this torrent, the video is jerky no matter what player is used and both the sound and video are worse than they should be if the DVD was ripped properly. Some kind of normalization filter was also used during ripping, so the sound volume is inconsistent. Same problem with the Second and Third seasons.

Get the smaller Hunter torrents instead, they are better.
