Here Comes That Weird Chill (subtitled Methamphetamine Blues, Extras & Oddities)is a taster for Lanegan's upcoming album Bubblegum (2004) & is another example of the return of the e.p. (see also John Cale's 5 Tracks; Ryan Adams' Love Is Hell). It also represents a change in Lanegan's career- this is released by 'Mark Lanegan Band' & is moves away from the gothic blend of country and folk common to his previous five solo albums (it's his first release without Mike Johnson, a union from The Winding Sheet to Field Songs).
