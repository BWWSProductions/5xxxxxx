JOE PASS VIRTUOSO
Audio CD 1 May 2 001
Label: Pablo
Format:Flac


Joe Pass is one of the jazz guitar all-stars, and this album highlights his overwhelming technical brilliance. Kenny Burrell and Wes Montgomery may have a sweeter sound, but it is difficult for anyone to approach Pass' stunning dexterity. The album, which consists of Pass playing a number of standards without accompaniment (and no overdubbing, of course), shows that Pass complemented his fretboard wizardry with a solid ear for improvisation and melody. You'll get the occasional glimpse of rock'n roll influence as well. All in  all, a  staggering  achievement.  Highly   recommended  for jazz fans, and a must-own for the jazz guitar fan.
