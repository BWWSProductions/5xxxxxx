,yesbos,2010-09-05T12:04Z,"hi xenl, i have a request for you. Could you pls allow SaM to put DDR's torrents in Pb. I know this is sharing and it should quick too. 
But i am confusing that, to whom i going to request 1.4G version of Lamhaa. When someone requested, SaM to upload any version of DDR's, he did in always. So cud u pls upload that 1.4G xvid version of Lamhaa too. 
I hope u got the point and Tx for this. "
