,Dimmis80,2010-09-02T19:48Z,First of all thanks for this release.Second It might be a stupid question but is it in AVI Format.??
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-02T19:58Z,"1st. Always click on Files: 
2nd: Read at least two lines in Description.
3rd: Click on IMDB if you are uncertain about some movie."

,SunnyDeville,2010-09-02T22:03Z,"1st. Is this real?
2nd. Is this real?
3rd. IS THIS F.U.CKING REAL!?

FFS why cant you guys (Lechers) describe the video and its rating for V/A 

The only reason why i say this is because the other DVD rips of this movie have more space as in GB and this is only 500MB... quality must be bad... if it's even real 

THATS WHY COMMENTING ON V/A WOULD BE HELPFUL! thanks o_o"
,SunnyDeville,2010-09-02T22:10Z,"OMG 1kb Down Speed? by the time im done downloading this film part 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 AND SEVEN! WILL BE OUT! and ill be a old man with a wrinkly D.I.C.K! 

COME ON SEED! "
,SunnyDeville,2010-09-02T22:11Z,THIS IS FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,lilars26,2010-09-02T22:35Z,"@SunnyDeville Noob's should not be commenting on things they know nothing about.If you would learn how to download,you would get it faster.Don't forget to seed."
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-02T22:48Z,Take your meds more frequently and - get some serious psychiatric help.
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-02T23:01Z,"@lilars: Not you. BTW, I still seed on two servers with 132 MB/s, something that crazy Sunny could not comprehend."
,lilars26,2010-09-02T23:32Z,"@ 20-40 I know you weren't talking to me.But if Sunny is still around I saw a nice big TS of Robin Hood 2.43gigs on TPB.If he wants big he should go get it.At that size,it has to be good.LMFAO."
,rjp88,2010-09-03T04:38Z,Thank you 2040 for your Awesome Work. You are the Best. 
,SunnyDeville,2010-09-03T06:12Z,"This is real V/10 A/10

20-40 i know you weren't talking about me either must of been speaking about Dmmis80 O_O gosh what'd he do? anyway great upload =)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-05T15:13Z,"@raja123456kumar: What IF out there is none?
BTW, I put subtitles more often in torrents than thousand of other uploaders combined. Especially for hearing impaired English speakers.

Do NOT ask me to do something I have not done and is NOT my business. It usually gives effect opposite to desired one."
