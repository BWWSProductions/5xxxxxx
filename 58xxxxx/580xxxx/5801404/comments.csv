,TobyzMama,2010-08-31T22:03Z,"Okay... I am new to this.  My neighb showed me this site yesterday.  What is a ""seeder"", what is a ""leech"", and why are people putting viruses on this?  How do I make sure that my download does not have a virus?  fyi, I'm gonna repost this a couple of times to help make sure I get a response.  Thanks!"
,mkiller,2010-08-31T23:22Z,@TobyzMama  u never know when a torrent has a virus or not just before u download anything make sure u see if its a anonimous or a vip user anonymus have more chance to upload crap virus than a vip user try to read the comments some are trolling buit if u see any comment with virus alert or something like that just move on to the next torren. than allways check the upload date to see if it was after the release date or if it was before ( fake than) seeders are the ones that are helping other poeple share this in this moment i m seeding so u guys can have this movie leecher is what u are leecher is the one whos trying to download the torrent. hope this imfo helped u in any way :D
,Rapier_Wit,2010-09-01T03:20Z,Most fake uploaders are stupid and will post a brand new movie as 'DVD Rip'. They also tend to post a whole bunch at once with no previous upload history. Some of these fakes will direct you to a site or ask you to download a special player. NEVER do this. Others are movie company trolls who are after your IP address and will try to bully your provider into giving up your details to threaten you with. Thanks for the upload here. Not my scene but always good to see a genuine upper.
,mkiller,2010-09-01T03:54Z,thank u did my best for all of u guys :D
,TobyzMama,2010-09-01T06:03Z,"@ M Killer and Rapier_Wit - thanks a bunch for the info.  I'm almost 30, stay online but don't keep up with the ""latest"", and with every year that passes I feel like more and more of a tech idiot.  

You guys def helped, but it sounds to me like I'm going to have to download at my own risk.  "
,TobyzMama,2010-09-01T06:04Z,"FYI, BIG scam is that first green ""download"" button... you end up downloading the Gamebox Toolbar.  And it took me forever to figure out how to get that shit off."
,mkiller,2010-09-01T06:44Z,its not the download button lol its the download this torrent button u should hit lololol and tobyz u welcome and yes u got to download at your own risk but with the info we gave u u will have a lower ricks of getting any virus like 20%
