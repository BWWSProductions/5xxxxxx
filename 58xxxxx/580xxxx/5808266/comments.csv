If including subs, always tell in description unless they are in english.
Great quality, but a minus for the subs (not that I am going to rate -1 because of it, I mean just a minus that you did)."

Why the hell is episode 9 (haven't looked at 10 and 11 yet) with hardcoded french subs?
This is the kind of thing that a real ""trusted"" member would either describe in the info or never post at all!
Definatly a -1 this time!"
