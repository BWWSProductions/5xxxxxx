,tjaffz,2010-09-15T21:45Z,"@Tagetes

How are we supposed seed the full torrent when we are ALL stuck at 72.1%?
It has been 71.8% for 12 days and now a huge leap to 72.1% yesterday.

The 3-4 ""seeders"" are NOT in the swarm. Just teasing everybody of the ~1000 users who tries to reach 100%!"
,mikem67,2010-09-20T04:12Z,My download too got stuck at 72.&. Then i switched to FantomLord link and I downloaded it in 36 minutes. That's a download guys !!! I have a fast Verizon Fios.

,shatru,2010-12-25T07:25Z,"bluray playback of cine player is not working. it said this version doesn't support bluray playback. but i can create bluray disks with MyDVD. I think it requires bluray playback plugin. roxio 2010 contains bluray plugin. I think this version missing bluray plugin. 
can anyone upload bluray plugin please?"
