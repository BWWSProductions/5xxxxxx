,Flazhp0intX,2010-09-06T18:27Z,"Wow shit. This album is NICE! Though I need these 2 tracks in HIGH quality (I know it's 320 Kpbs already, but the sound isnt that great):

10. (00:02:37) Lil wayne Ft. Passion Pit - Got Too Much Passion
 13. (00:05:55) Lil Wayne - Prostitute Pt.II (iTunes Bonus Track)

Does anyone have that?"
