,Swaffles,2010-09-09T05:30Z,"I have Windows 7, and it does work. This mod is also independant from other mods. So you don't need, say ""Desert Combat Final"", to play this mod. You only need Battlefield 1942 v1.61 or v1.6 to play."

,Swaffles,2010-10-04T20:26Z,"Remember this: Because this game is from a torrent and not purchased from a store, you will not be able to play on servers that have PunkBuster in them. You can only play on non-PunkBuster servers. And it seems like you already have the game up-to-date, so there is no need to check for patches."

,Swaffles,2010-11-30T18:15Z,"For Windows 7 users: Install BF 1942 into your ""Program Files (x86)"" directory, not your normal Program Files directory. Right-click on the game icon, go to the ""Compatibility"" tab, then check off ""Run as administrator."" This should help.

If you follow my instructions, you will install the game correctly. If the game has some noteable peoblems, try updating it. The latest update is the v1.61b patch [not the cracked patch included in this torrent, it's the one made by EA]. After updating the game, that's when you add the v1.61b Cracked patch."

,Swaffles,2011-02-16T07:42Z,"I don't see why you rely on that website. Microsoft Security Essentials, which is what I use, is much more reliable than that odd little website you used. I scanned the torrent files a few times before releasing this torrent, and a few months after its release, using Microsoft Security Essentials.

MSE found absolutely no threats in the torrent files of this torrent. My PC is cleaner than a new bar of soap.

,Swaffles,2011-02-16T08:06Z,"I have not studied how the key generators work, but what I do know is that you do not even have to have the BF1942 files to generate the codes. They generate codes independant from the game. But the key generators work like a charm."

,Swaffles,2011-04-16T17:09Z,"billissimo86: You're trying to play a game that was primarily made for Microsoft computers on an Apple computer. This torrent works best on Microsoft computers. Usually your issue can be resolved by changien your video driver's settings.

TheTrueLM: There are three patches to install. The two by EA, then [after installing the two EA patches] the Crack patch. So they would go in this order:

1 - v1.6
2 - v1.61b
3 - v1.61b Crack"
,Swaffles,2011-04-16T17:29Z,"To counterbabz, who was having trouble with CD2: Use WinRAR to extract the "".iso"" files. WinRAR is your best choice, and can be used to extract a wide variety of files. Please be specific about the issue you are coming upon so that I have an accurate description to work with.

Danv95: If you want to play online, you need to legitimately purchase a CD key. You can find some servers that allow torrented BF1942 games, so your [OUR] best bet is to find such a server.

,Swaffles,2011-12-02T05:34Z,"Just as a general tip for compatibility:
WINDOWS 7 USERS:

- Install BF1942 under ""ProgramFiles (x86)"" and not just ""ProgramFiles"". Assuming you installed the game successfully, right-click on the shortcut to the game, then click ""Properties"". Change the compatibility to Windows 98, then check the box next to ""Run As Administrator"". I hope this helps.
