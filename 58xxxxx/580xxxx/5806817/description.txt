Battlefield 1942 + Expansions + CD Crack + Key generators

This torrent includes:
- Battlefield 1942 [CD1] [Electronic Arts / DICE]
- Battlefield 1942 [CD2] [Electronic Arts / DICE]
- Battlefield 1942: Road to Rome [CD3] [Expansion Pack]
- Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII [CD4] [Expansion Pack]
- CD Crack: "patch v1.61b cracked"
- Keygen for BF 1942 made by "Immersion"
- Keygen for Road to Rome made by "Razor"
- Keygen for Secret Weapons of WWII made by "Immersion"

Instructions:
- On your desktop, create four folders by these names: CD1, CD2, CD3, CD4. You can delete these later after installing the game.

- Using WinRAR, extract "Battlefield 1942 CD1" to the folder named "CD1"

- Using WinRAR, extract "Battlefield 1942 CD2" to the folder named "CD2"

- Using WinRAR, extract "Battlefield 1942 Road to Rome CD3" to the folder named "CD3"

- Using WinRAR again, extract "Battlefield 1942 Secret Weapons of WWII CD4" to the folder named "CD4"

- In the folder named "CD1" click on the file named "Setup." The file type should say "Application"

- Install the components you want. Use the key generators provided in the torrent's folder where the Disk Image Files are. I believe the installation includes BattleCraft 1942, which is a map editor [made by Electronic Arts] in which you can edit the maps with. You don't need this unless you want to edit the maps.

- After installing Battlefield 1942, you need to go to PlanetBattlefield.com to update the game to 1.6, then to 1.61 [or 1.61b]. After updating, install "patch v1.61b cracked" to be able to use the game without the physical game CD.

- Drop a message atif you need any help. I check it every day. Literally.
