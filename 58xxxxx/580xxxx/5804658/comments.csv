In 1998, Spielberg recut Close Encounters again for what would become the ""Collector's Edition,"" to be released on home video and laserdisc. This version of the film is something of a re-edit of the original 1977 release with some elements of the 1980 Special Edition, but omits the mothership interior scenes which Spielberg felt should have remained a mystery. 

Spielberg regards the ""Collector's Edition"" as his definitive version of Close Encounters."
