"Fans of Ariel Pink or R. Stevie Moore may enjoy this unreleased EP from Outer Limits Recordings, fronted by ex-Test Icicles man Sam Mehran. The sound is very much like an old tape found in your childhood toy box, with hidden gems that in another world would've been perfect pop songs. An excellent introduction to Outer Limits Recordings, hopefully there will be more to come!"
