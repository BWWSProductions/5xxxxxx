,morphirr,2010-09-04T14:53Z,"Any more comments on this, is it working ok?"
,mextus,2010-09-04T14:59Z,"Tried on softmodded Wii with USB-loader GX

Tried it with ios222, ios223, ios249. Nothing works. Just a blank screen.

When I insert the disc in the normal menu it says there is a system update on the disc though, so it is probably legit."
,solid_wolf,2010-09-04T17:31Z,"Does work for me on my Wii 4.3E with Wiikey 1 and no soft modds whatsoever.

Burnt the image with ImgBurn and a Layer Break of 2084960 , speed of x4 on a TDK DVD+R doublelayer disc.

Disk asked for uppdate 2 times, and so I did."

Not sure, how safe is pimp my wii?"
,mondo,2010-09-05T17:33Z,"morphirr >>
Weird, cause I DLÂ´d it with about 2-4MB/s..
I seed it with 100Mb now for as long as possible so hopefully the speed will pick up for you."

,deliopreto,2010-11-25T01:01Z,And its better to run normally through the disc channel or with a emulator?
,deliopreto,2010-11-25T13:25Z,I see no one is geting this file anymore so it's probably bad... but why download so slow? 2kbps with 28 seeds X.X
