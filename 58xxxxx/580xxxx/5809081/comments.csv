,grandy88,2010-09-03T22:51Z,"Also, I don't have quite as big of a pipe as I used to, so you may experience slower downloads initially.  I'll always be seeding, however.

Please help seed."
,roryt,2010-09-03T23:19Z,"woohoo! First leecher/seeder! don't think I have ever done that before. 

Thanks grandy88! The ""grandy88 set"" is now complete! will seed long after it's finished downloading on my end."
,fluppe89,2010-09-04T00:21Z,This are the best BluRay rips of Lost on the web! Thanks grandy88! Please keep seeding guys!
,onegreatguy,2010-09-04T05:54Z,Thank you!
,Neo2109,2010-09-09T00:19Z,"Thanks grandy88 for these great uploads. Could we please have more seeders guys, thanks."
,grandy88,2010-09-14T22:26Z,"I didn't include the audio commentaries, which was a bit of an oversight.  I can separate the audio files and upload them so you all can mux them if you'd like - let me know."
,angel_speak2000,2010-09-16T20:46Z,"is there any possibility that someone who has already downloaded the 8 GB Bonus features, upload it again for us, the download is so slow."
,alanarthur,2010-09-16T21:49Z,"Thanks for this and your other Lost torrents, fantastic and much appreciated! Just one quick question on this one - my TV plays video but no audio on this set, but played the other series you posted without any issues. Was there something different about the audio encoding on this one?"
,angel_speak2000,2010-09-17T00:57Z,"If the audio commentry is available, plz upload it man, i really appreciate it if u wud do so."
,grandy88,2010-09-17T05:34Z,"I fail to see how uploading a new torrent would help your download speeds.

And alanarthur, these were done the exact same way as the other 5 seasons.  I haven't heard from anybody else with audio problems.

I need to re-rip them to get the audio commentary and I don't have the discs on me right now, but I'll get them this weekend and get working on it.  Give me a few days."
,tenkre11,2010-09-17T15:20Z,"Grandy, you are the man.

thank you so much. i was waiting for this (whole series, bluray + extras) and finally there it all is.

just one question. what determines the size of a single episode? cos they all vary in size. that's not a bad thing, please don't get upset, i'm just curious because i wanna learn how to rip things like you do. 

THANKS FRIEND once again. peace."
,FrozenRemains,2010-09-17T21:35Z,alanarthur is right at least from my perspective.  There is no audio coming through on the season 6 episodes but the special features are working fine.  Is there anything we can do about this because I love the quality of your rips? Thanks Grandy!
,Dylnamic,2010-09-18T08:00Z,"This is absolutely fantastic! :D But i have one question; do you know how come the bonus features on season 6 are in stereo when on season 4 and 5 they were in dolby 5.1 surround sound? :) :D Thanks so much for this though, you're a genius!"
,grandy88,2010-09-18T08:53Z,"I have no issues with the audio and I have heard from several others without issues as well.  Not sure what to say, they were encoded in the exact same method as the bonus features and all of the other seasons.  Check your codecs I suppose, let others know if you figure it out.

As for the audio on the bonus features, if the source is available in 5.1 that's how I do it - but if it's only stereo it's because the source wasn't 5.1.

As for the size of the files, they're encoded such that the video quality throughout and between episodes should be the same, so size can vary based on the video in each episode."
,Dylnamic,2010-09-18T10:09Z,Ahh oki thank you very much :D I was just confused that they had encoded the bonuses in stereo when for the last 2 they did it in 5.1 audio  but never mind :D It's amazing anyway so thanks a looooooot! x) The best LOST blu ray rips on the web.
,gujit_ss,2010-09-18T12:59Z,"when i first saw this on PB, i thought 'naah its some other knock-off uploader' then i found out it was grandy88, i registered with PB and had to say so!! love the quality mate, looks sooper!! and i just read english subs, fantastic!"

,msaridar,2010-10-09T22:16Z,all 5 seasons worked great on my WD HD Media Player. Now season 6 has no audio comming out........... help plz :(
,msaridar,2010-10-12T22:12Z,"I found the solution !!! :)
If you don get audio, use mkvmerge to remove the subs from the mkv file.
My WD HD Media player used to show the subtitles corrupted and got no audio from it.
All worked fine when i removed the subs from the file.
Hope it works with you.

Thanks Grandy.
Again i know i might be pushing it, any ETA for ENG subs for all seasons ? 
Thank you."
,abe112983,2010-10-29T02:46Z,The torrent will not download for me it says there are 24 seeders on the site but in Utorrent it say invalid url and won't start. Anybody's help would be appreciated.

,7oki,2011-02-10T09:25Z,"the sub won't show on my hd media player, how can i extract the sub and make it center ?
thanks for the upload"
,Coldblackice,2011-02-17T10:37Z,"How could we go about getting the director's commentary for these blu-ray rips?

Obviously I'm not asking grandy to re-rip everything, I'm just wondering if it would be possible to incorporate the commentary track into this file if we were to find/rip it from somewhere?

Thanks!"

,superuploaderVI,2011-09-22T10:39Z,Where can I find the subtitles?
,wsjiii,2011-09-23T23:49Z,"Damn, the audio is corrupted, my TV plays the first 5 seasons beautifully (thanks for the upload, btw) but I get subs with no audio with this season. I tried using MKVmerge to remove subs but my player won't recognize the new mkv. Any suggestions? For the love of gods, I'm dying to finish the series and can't find any other bluray rips!"
,maxthulin,2011-10-06T15:52Z,"English subtitles synched by ME personally made especially for this release found here (ALL seasons included!): 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6725151

They are all synched by me personally so i can guarantee that they are 100% correct!

Enjoy!"
,David.c,2012-04-21T06:06Z,"Buddy you rock thank you for all the seasons they are ripped wonderfully great quality and everything I will be seeding as much as I can every month to keep all 6 seasons alive come on people seed at least few gig's a month and help keep this mad release alive, Thanks again grandy88 you rock dude. "
,dark_option,2012-05-20T19:05Z,"Thank you so much for all your hard work. I've downloaded all 6 season from you and they are hands down the best rips I have ever had pleasure of watching. You sir are a gentleman and a scholar. I have seeded back almost 400gb so far on these seasons and I'll keep them alive as long as I can. 

Cheers"
,rgoulart,2012-05-26T01:51Z,"Thank you very much grandy88.
I'm downloading all the seasons uploaded by you, and I'm almost finished. Took me only 3 days to download everything, so I can't complain about seeders. The quality is awesome, way better than HDTV rips. The only thing I think is missing, is the audio commentaries, which I would be very grateful if you could upload them separately for those of us who would like to include them in the episodes. Again, thank you for taking your time and uploading such a great rip of the best tv show ever. Beginning tomorrow I'll be seeding this for as much as I can, one season per night."
,Coldblackice,2012-06-19T09:28Z,"Ahh I just figure out what the problem is, why the Extras appear interlaced and why media players won't deinterlace them --

Grandy88 encoded them as Progressive, when they're actually Interlaced. Although the main episodes are progressive, these extras should have been encoded as interlaced. I wish there was a way to change a ""flag"" in the clip to change it from Progressive to Interlaced, so that media players correctly deinterlace the clips (to get rid of those jaggy lines on motion), but unfortunately, the only way to do this is to re-rip and encode the video from the blurays :( 

Grandy88 (or anyone) -- do you happen to still have the blurays, that perhaps you could re-rip the extras content as Interlaced?"
,dzver666,2012-06-22T14:48Z,I'm getting terrible speed...15 kb/s... seed ...gpd damn
