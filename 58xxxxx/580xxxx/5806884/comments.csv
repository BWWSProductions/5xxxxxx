,omegafox84,2010-09-03T04:05Z,@ctang: sure man. an invite to D would be sweet. i just got this movie myself but haven't watched it yet. really looking forward to both of your next uploads. :)

[T],FatFreddy007,2010-09-03T04:46Z,"hey ctang: tell the guy in the movie store, that Python's Life of Brian, also has the Spanish language."
[T],ctang,2010-09-04T19:18Z,"i am seeding again but am at a different location and my up speed is very slow...like max i think is 30kbps...sorry guys

i know i have been doing a lot of movies i have been getting, but like always, I am taking requests"
,cphan,2010-09-04T21:38Z,Are you planning to do Up In Air?
[T],ctang,2010-09-04T22:28Z,no because i dont have it...i believe i said that when you initially requested it
,cphan,2010-09-05T01:54Z,Nah you didn't. You actually didn't respond to my request so I didn't know. But it's cool if you didn't have it. Oh well least I know now. lol.
[T],ctang,2010-09-05T05:18Z,sorry bout that...could of swore i did...i added it to my list but no promises 
,cphan,2010-09-05T17:28Z,"Just a suggest but why don't you add a list of upcoming dvds that you are making torrents for in each new torrent release description so people can now what's coming up next or so.
Maybe I'm wrong but you have a list of what you plan on doing but we don't really get to see that list at all. lol."
[T],ctang,2010-09-05T18:51Z,i almost always say what is up next in the first comment in each torrent...just like i did in this torrent...i am encoding Harry Brown right now and it will be up in a few hours!!!...then will be Monty Pythons Life Of Brian...i have the extra's dvd for it if people want it...i will only upload it if i get at least 5 people asking for it (both will be included in 1 torrent)
,toadman23,2010-09-28T02:29Z,"so how would i burn this to a blank dvd?
with a working menu"
,shady109,2010-10-31T09:24Z,"What should we use to burn this to dvd? I've tried nero recode, clonedvd, & dvdfab 6 & it will not play on my dvd player only on my pc. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I've not had this problem with ur other dvd i downloaded, which by the way is great work & greatly appreciated. Please keep up the good work, we all appreciate you."
