MMPHC is just an ignoramus, at least you left the English audio. 
Shame you embedded the subtitles though, would have prefrered if I had the option of hiding them. "

,tywdyfor,2010-09-03T21:57Z,"The subtitles are bearable, the plot is not.
A:6, V:9, IQ:0"
,Nick3rs,2010-09-03T23:49Z,"in my opinion the Swedish subs are unbearable, but this is defiantly the best quality available right now."
,QuePensa,2010-09-05T07:03Z,"WTF! Sample does not have the embedded subtitles!!!! DONT download this, HARD subtitles in video, cannot be removed. MMPHC was gentle! It seems the quality of the sample was better than the  movie. DO YOU KNOW WHAT SAMPLE IS???? I dont think so.

... what a waste of my limited bandwidth!!!"
