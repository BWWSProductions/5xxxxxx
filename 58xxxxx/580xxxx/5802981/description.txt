                LA.Ink.Fresh.Ink.S04.Special.Part.02.HDTV.XviD-GNARLY

 Apparently no one knows what this "Fresh Ink" show is. TVrage lists it as new series
 epguides says they are specials. As a result we are going to continue to call it a season
 04 special and give it part numbers. For the record it's a bunch of footage from early
 shows that was not included, basically extra/bonus footage. Whatever, enjoy :)
