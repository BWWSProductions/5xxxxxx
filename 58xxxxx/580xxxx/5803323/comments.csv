,Palle-Pirat,2010-09-12T22:25Z,"I can't register the software. It's just running as a standard trial.
I've used the attached username and password:

use this serials
username: EAV-25525900  : 5cddtharh6 

But ESET states that it isn't valid.
Could it be, that the data attached are incorrect..?"

,McLovinnnn,2010-09-15T21:03Z,"Dear everyone
The serial in this torrent is valid okay until 2015, but you cannot update. It's just enough to keep your nod32 registered, but it cannot update because it's not a legit username and password."

,rayder75,2010-09-29T01:45Z,ESET has stepped up it's efforts to blacklist usernames and passwords. Word has it it even has access to minilogin the program that seeks out usernames and passwords for you automatically over the internet from different sites. Any name and password that is found by this program is fed into ESET'S system and is blacklisted. It's going to be extremely difficult to get a usable name and password cuz it will be blacklisted.  Need to wait for a crack or patch is the best bet if not good luck.
,Hayra,2010-10-06T07:12Z,I've tried every username and password on this page. Nothing works =(
,ex0tica,2010-10-07T20:59Z,"CAN ANYBODY HELP ME!!!!!!! i have this torrent and everything, and sometimes nod32 asks you to send some files it found to their lab for analysis (its supposted to help make theyr program better), i think your supposed to say no since this is an illegal copy of it, i accidentally pressed yes and im worried now itll cause attention to the fact this is a downloaded copy...does anyone know if itll come back to bite me in the butt??????

,listenherenow,2010-10-08T05:48Z,"I have been messing with this damned thing all day on and off. 

   I loved my old Nod32 and I am still running it on all my 32bit systems and will forever. But I broke down and built a 64 bit system last week and didnt have a nod32 to put on it. 

  until today.   Then I find this BS with no fx like the old school 2. version.   

  I am not the smartest lightbulb in the cookie jar but guess what,  i just got this working perfect.

  soooo.   I just wanted to say it's possible and don't give up.  By the way =- those enabler sites and shyt that are oit there are slamming your systems with malware.   

  Just to let you know. "
,aXis3,2010-10-08T20:36Z,"@ex0tica
