But I've just found it on Torrentz. 
Looks like I mispelled the final -s. 
Who cares? "

Does anyone know where one might find a copy of Tom Sharpe's new book ""The Wilt Inheritance""?"

,webrosc,2010-12-26T04:57Z,"thanks, but no pdf format?"
,nil7,2011-02-19T12:01Z,"... no pdf is good. Pdf is the *worst* format for ebooks. It is designed (and are excellent) for printing, and bad for anything else. Also difficult to extract meta information (title, author etc.). If you want to handle a large collection without to much trouble, avoid pdf!

I can recommend http://calibre-ebook.com/ for handling ebooks - btw. from its faq:

""What are the best source formats to convert?""
In order of *decreasing* preference:
LIT, MOBI, EPUB, HTML, PRC, RTF, PDB, TXT, PDF

Note that pdf is worse than txt... :)"
