John Mellencamp and producer T Bone Burnett team up once again for the follow up to their first collaboration, Life Death Love And Freedom and once again there is a sonic concept.  Life Death was recorded and offered in something of a high-definition audio format developed by Burnett.  This set was recorded with the band playing in three historic locations using one vintage microphone.  Those three locations?  Sun Studios in Memphis, the San Antonio hotel room where Robert Johnson made his first iconic recordings, and the First African Baptist Church in Savannah, Ga (the oldest Black church in the US).
