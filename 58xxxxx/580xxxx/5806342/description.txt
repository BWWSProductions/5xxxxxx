This was a well-done English filmed anthology series
from the 1960s produced by famed American
producers Herbert Brodkin of "The Defenders" fame
and Herbert Hirschman, the man who produced the 4th
Season (hour-long episodes) of Twilight Zone.

There were only 24 episodes, some of which I plan
to offer in between episodes of The Virginian.
