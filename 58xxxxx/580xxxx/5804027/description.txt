
This album is really good and seeing as it is so hard to find an actual Anthrax album it is a really good buy for Anthrax fans. 
This album shows that Anthrax don't take them selves to seriously, which is always a good quality in a band, but they can still pump out some good tunes. 

What I will tell you is that as a single disc from the Connoisseur Collection this is very good value for money. All the better known tracks are here and they really do the band good service. A few spins of this will have any latter day heavy rock fan understanding what all the fuss was about. Early thrashers like Madhouse, towering thrash metal tunes like Caught in a Mosh and I Am the Law segue into the body of this release where socially aware stuff like Indians, funny off the wall tunes like I'm the Man and well known covers like Anti-Social and Got the Time live. 

Backed up by the heavy duty metal of the tracks from Persistence of time (the last studio effort prior to Belladonnas first exit) this is an ablum for those with a strong constitution and an ear for talent. An excellent taster for this band rendered perhaps a touch redundant in light of later, expanded compilations. (Customers from Amazon)
