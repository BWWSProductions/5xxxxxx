These are the scans of the Lister Diesel Engine Manual that used to be hosted on the now-defunct f1-rocketboy.com site.

The cover lists this instruction and parts manual for diesel engine types 6-1, 8-1, 12-2 & 16-2. Date of publication is 1970 by the R.A. Lister & Co Ltd., Dursley, Gloucestershire, England. I know many owners of Listeroid engines from Asia and India have found this manual very helpful.

Images are in .JPG format, and while not the greatest quality scans, they are still usable. And definitely better than not having any manual at all.
