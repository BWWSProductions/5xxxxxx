,unplacer,2010-09-04T23:34Z,Something is not right here. The current version at the O&O web site is 12.5.351.
,udidwht,2010-09-06T06:20Z,^^^I agree the current version is 12.5.351. Don't believe me? Go to their site.
,bidanset,2010-09-14T08:17Z,check the site again... version 12 is upgradable to version 14 as of recent... this is most likely legitimate in all sense.
