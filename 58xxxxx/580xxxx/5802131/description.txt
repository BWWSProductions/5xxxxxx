Here are my favourite rock tracks from the U.S. and U.K. spanning the last 30yr or so . like every type of music , everyone has their own opinion . so please don't slate me because i didnt include your favourites . but i'm hoping this compilation will please most people . 

I wasnt sure how to make a tracklist to put on this box ,and i wasnt going to type it all out . but if you click download torrent , you will be able to view all the songs . anyway i hope you enjoy and please seed for as long as you can .
