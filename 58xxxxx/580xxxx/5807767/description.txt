Sophie Hall is a fact checker at The New Yorker magazine who

dreams of becoming a writer, but her boss, Bobby, does not

share her wishes. Sophie's fiancÃ©, Victor (Gael GarcÃ­a 

Bernal), is about to open an Italian restaurant in downtown

New York. To celebrate, the two go on a "pre-honeymoon" to 

Verona, Italy. However, Victor is very enthusiastic about, 

and busy with, finding the best wines and cheeses for his

restaurant and, to Sophie's disappointment, hardly has time

for her. While he is out one day, Sophie goes sightseeing 

and comes across the house where Juliet Capulet supposedly

lived and watches in awe as numerous people gather to write

letters to Juliet about their loves and post them on 

Juliet's Wall. Sophie writes of this in her journal and sits 

on a bench for a few hours, waiting for closing time, to see

what becomes of the letters....
