Comments appreciated. :)"
,D0gmeat,2010-09-04T17:22Z,"I am not sure what Winrar you used or if you used a different compression ratio, but I cannot open any of the 12 or so files I grabbed in CDisplay and I am using the latest. However, if I rename the files to .RAR, unpack them and re-RAR them and rename them back, I can view them. So not sure what's going on with them.

But thanks. Just too many files for me to do the above to download the rest."
,D0gmeat,2010-09-04T17:25Z,"I should mention the files are fine, just not compatible with CDisplay. I can view them just fine in ComicRack but I find CDisplay much easier to use."
,ManManga,2010-09-04T23:44Z,"@D0gmeat, do you mean the chapters? All I did with those were change the files from .rar and .zip to .cbr with a renaming app. I used Mac's built-in compressor for some of the other files, then changed them to .cbr from .rar. That could've been the problem.

And not all the files in the Special folder are .cbr. Some are .pdfs, so if you're not showing extensions, that could be a problem. :)"
,D0gmeat,2010-09-06T14:52Z,"Not just the chapters. Most of the specials as well. And only with the .CBR as I don't bother with PDFs.

It probably works just fine on a MacOSX but not having one, I have to do the repacking to make them readable with CDisplay on Windows."

,NinpoLore,2010-11-03T21:39Z,"Super download! In reference to one of the comments below, I found the files perfectly compatible with CDisplay, and the .cbr files were much appreciated - I hate reading manga by reading scanned jpgs. Much obliged!"
