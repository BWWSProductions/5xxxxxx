This video graphically depicts treatment of electrical trauma following an estimated 70kV electrical burn.  The airman lost both arms during the treatment.

While in the Army, we were shown the video as an electrical safety training aid.  The video was referred to as the "Airman Larry" video.

The quality of the video is quite low, as it is clearly converted from a much older format.
