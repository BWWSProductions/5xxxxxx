- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   The Twisted Minds are an atypical French punk/hardcore band in the vein of
   Propagandhi. The band began in 1998 and made Ambitions & Disillusions in
   2003, followed by Neo Dogmas in 2007.

   The Twisted Minds have been playing for more than 5 years with the same
   lineup. In 2005 they took their technical punk rock sound with heavy metal
   licks on the road in France, Europe and Brazil on the Zona Punk Tour 2005.
   Their music reflects a political conscience, while still overflowing with
   powerful riffs, catchy melodies, and an overall great sound.

   Airchitects was mixed and mastered by Andrew Berlin and Jason Livermore at
   The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, CO.
