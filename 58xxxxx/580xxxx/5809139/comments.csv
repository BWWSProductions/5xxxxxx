This is something that should be read by everybody in Europe. Now that we are facing the fall of western civilisation due to the islamic hordes, we'd better recalibrate our thoughts on how we got to the scientific, economic and philosophical heights that we did. Let's hope it's not for nought."

Thanks  bookzilla/ bitchtorent for all the great books you're uploading.
I can't find all over the net any uploaded book about watches - wrist & pocket. Do you have/ found something? Thanks again."
