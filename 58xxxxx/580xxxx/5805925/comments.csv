,amalfy,2010-09-04T22:37Z,ok this works but i cant save.. after i click free ride it gives me some kind of saving/loading error... and all the cars dont work in the garage either... only a few show up.. for the rest of them it only gives the name... 
[T],ADHDerby,2010-09-05T00:38Z,"You can't save in Free Ride Mode, just click on Continue without saving.
All cars work in the Summer Modes. A lot of cars don't have a ""winter skin"" (*_z.sds). If you want to drive in them in the winter, open the pc\sds\cars directory and copy the files without _z and rename them to *_z.sds
Remember: copy and rename, don't just rename them!!"
,Dhatz,2010-09-05T17:13Z,so it's still just a devmode witout ability to choose save location or actually save/load? we need a mod not just customised hidden devmode. another thing that needs to be modded out(after the final tuning has been unlocked by another torrent here) is the autoheal and fuel  regeneration and engine rapairs that keeps you moving no matter what(until the car completely explodes).
,Dhatz,2010-09-05T19:20Z,another things that need fixing is keyboard input for license plates and movable camera when in tuning shop.
,sluner,2010-09-06T17:50Z,"need help it stock on loading when i start free ride, it never stop loading so i can play:("
,nittany,2010-09-08T04:15Z,"This worked great for me, I played for about a hour killing cops and shooting shit up.  I browsed through plenty of cars in the garage, they showed up fine.  Thanks for this!

I'm going to run the Mafia 2 trainer next time with the free roam, I'll be unstoppable!!  Muhahaha.

,nittany,2010-09-08T04:18Z,"BTW, most people probably don't know how to backup their saved game location before they try this mod out.

You have to enable hidden folders in Windows that way you can access the AppData\Local\2K Games\Mafia II directory and copy your saved games that way you aren't screwed if something happens and you lose all your progress in the game."
