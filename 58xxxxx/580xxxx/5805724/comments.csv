,RC_Ebooks,2010-11-11T04:20Z,"I'm gonna give you youngsters a piece of advice on this topic based on my 50 yrs. on this stupid planet: DON'T TAKE THIS STUFF TOO SERIOUSLY! Back when I was a kid, Leonard Nimoy had a show on TV called ""In Search Of"". Well, one of my little classmates fell so IN LOVE with aliens. Bigfoot, ghosts, etc. that he taped the shows with his cassette recorder and proceeded to walk around Jr. high school, playing the damned episodes for everyone to hear... and in turn RUINED his social life for the rest of his school career. These people selling this SHIT: George Noorey, Daniken, etc. are NOT doing it for free and it is all speculation. They may be the very idiots in high school walking around with the cassette player of this crap and EVERY generation repeats this game over and over. There is NEVER AN ANSWER, only more books... overpriced videos and wacky sponsors for their shit. This GAME never changes and like religion.... bilks millions of people out of millions of bucks for nothing!

You've been WARNED, kids!"
,RC_Ebooks,2010-11-12T01:49Z,"IF any of this shit is true, the question is ""Why did they come here"". I'll tell you why and it's the same exact reason why people move from town to town or go on vacations: TO GET LAID!  Don't need an overpriced degree to figure that out, it's the reason you go to work (well, your parents!) in the morning... TO GET LAID. Or at least to PAY for the LAY you've had... that being you sitting there downloading this bullocks. Truth about this stuff is, it will never be answered because there is way too much money to be made from the questions! Once the answers are out, all these geeks have to go work in McDonald's. This BS will be in circulation long after I'm dead and gone, you too!"
[T],houruoha,2010-11-17T21:52Z,"@RC_Ebooks
this is just an entertainment
why worry
:) "
,kimjongwil,2010-11-20T02:03Z,"RC_ebooks - u need to chill out buddy - you're the same as all those hysterical moms out there freaking out about ""satanic messages in rock music"" and ""video games are making kids violent"" and other bullshit like ""if u wank your dick you'll grow hairy palms"" - a lot of people understand this is just entertainment - but i know many skeptics/atheists/agnostics who think most of this is garbage, but SOME of it is strangely logical, and is overall just a bunch of ENTERTAINMENT. 

thanks for ""saving"" us. "
,boognishboy2,2010-12-09T15:10Z,"@rc ebooks,,this might be entertainment butr the non-existance of aliens mathmaticly is inpossibale!!!!!   tghey HAVe to exist!!!  great not to take everything they say as fact but theu are based off of truths!!!"
,Beograd_011,2011-01-08T16:11Z,Thank you i 
,dearghoul,2011-02-27T00:36Z,I have an anal probe to prove it so shut the fuck up.

,xMajesticMeteorx,2011-07-20T12:20Z,"Laugh my motherfuckin' ass off!  I agree with RC_EBOOKS.  It's all a bunch of snake oil medicine show bullshit.
I wouldn't pay for any of it. It's not even worth pausing my DVR for which is why I watch it for free here for mere kicks.
Why do I have satellite TV and a DVR? Because I've got a retarded sister and my nephew living with me that demand it, that's why.
TPB rules baby. "
,skyllaz,2011-08-13T18:41Z,this is only for OPEN MINDED people and eager to learn more about this world. . . at least you have an idea. . . 
,Bogartman,2011-08-19T21:23Z,"Having seen a couple episodes of this on TV, it looks like an OK show to help explore some of these concepts.

For people interested in this area, I recommend watching Star Dreams.  It takes a somewhat more scientific approach in examining the crop circle phenomenon:

,5amjr,2011-10-11T08:40Z,Now how about the quality instead of the forum discussion kiddies!
,wirama,2011-10-27T03:34Z,"Quality?
Audio : 10
Video : 8
Content : 8 (very informative and makes you wonder, but a lot of assumption)"
,ljs9108,2012-02-18T04:23Z,I think the people who feel the need to discredit this view point must be religious fanatics or idiots. It's the only thing that makes sense.
