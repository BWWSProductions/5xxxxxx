,mkdcoupe4,2010-11-30T12:51Z,"I've got the same darkness issue with my SE X10, must just be that the X10"
,mkdcoupe4,2010-11-30T12:52Z,"I've got the same darkness issue with my SE X10, might just be that the X10 can't run it properly?"

,codral,2011-02-14T11:31Z,"Use xxThugxx's torrent, it has the version for both phones (need a snapdragon specific version if u have a snapdragon phone)  Fixed my dark screen.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5806026/Need_For_Speed_-_Shift_Version._1.0.4_For_Android

Get it from there"
,codral,2011-02-14T11:46Z,"Get the other version on pirate bay (it's like 132mb), it's better, has both versions in it, this one isn't compatible with snapdragon."
,xzink,2011-05-05T22:03Z,"Samsung i5800 does not work with this either, I have also tried the milestone and omap version. Don't bother - cars are white."
,jj423,2011-05-08T04:07Z,"maybe you just dont know what your doing?? it works fine on my milestone and my samsung vibrant 2.2! i even tested it on two other android phones....ALL WORKED FINE, now, i am aware that it wont work on some phones as there are two diff. chip-set models of the gme!"
