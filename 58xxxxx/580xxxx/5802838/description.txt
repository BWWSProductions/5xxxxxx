MANTIS TV Series Complete (1994)

M.A.N.T.I.S. is a TV series that aired for one season on the FOX Network between August 1994 and March 1995. (Two unaired episodes were broadcast for the first time on the Sci-Fi Channel in September 1997.) The original two-hour TV pilot was produced by Sam Raimi and developed by Sam Hamm. It starred actor Carl Lumbly. The show was unique, inasmuch as it depicted an African-American superhero.[citation needed]

Lumbly's character, Dr. Miles Hawkins, was a wealthy, mild-mannered doctor who was shot in the spine during a riot while helping a kid. He claimed by a cop and filed a lawsuit but lost the suit. He decided against appealing. Paralyzed from the waist down, he uses his company's resources to invent a powered exoskeleton that not only enables him to walk but gives him superhuman abilities. He utilizes a vast array of technology, including a large underwater lab and a hovercraft called the Crysalid to fly around the city. With his newfound power, he vows to fight crime and assumes the hidden identity of the vigilante "M.A.N.T.I.S." (Mechanically Automated NeuroTransmitter Interactive System).
