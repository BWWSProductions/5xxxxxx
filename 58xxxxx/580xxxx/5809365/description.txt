Spannish Heavy Metal band who had a decent presence in the UK in the 80's. They stuck to Spannish language songs which I think suited them but seemed to ensure that they never made it internationally - just like Trust. Saw them live a few times including a Festival appearance and they were always superb. Enjoy!
