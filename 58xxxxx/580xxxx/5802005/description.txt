Rolling Stone Rare Trax Vol. 21
A good mix between old classics and newer songs by relatively unknown artist. Anyone who likes to look out for samples used in famous rapsongs will be happy with this one (or just in general people with a good taste in music). Check out Leon Haywood, Dr. Dre is such a lazy bastard... The only real minus is the abridged version of \"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\". Stops after 7 minutes although the Song becomes incredibly amazing after 11. Well, i might put up a torrent with Isaac Hayes Albums and then you get the real thing.
