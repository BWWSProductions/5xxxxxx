Studying Intrusions from the Subtle Realm:
How Can We Deepen Our Knowledge?
by John E. Mack, M.D.

"In the focus on the material realm to the exclusion of the subtle realms, we have virtually rid the cosmos of nature, rid nature of spirit and, in a sense, denied the existence of all life other than that which is physically observable here on Earth."

The accompanying article is developed from a talk given at the International Association for New Science Conference, Fort Collins, Colorado, September 16, 1995. 

The accompanying 50 minute audio presentation (320kbps mp3) is believed to be a second reading presented in 1996.


Note: This is the presentation in which Dr. Mack uttered one of his most famous statements,  

"The alien abduction phenomenon appears to be a kind of spiritual outreach program from the cosmos for the spiritually impaired."
