I also get the same error message ""No input file specified."" and therefore can not download this torrent-file.
Experienced the same with a complety different upload some time ago.
Has anybody got a hint of what is going wrong, why it works for others and not for me(us)?"

,flightsimmer99,2012-02-20T23:52Z,Im getting black gauges on W7 32. Any solutions?
,9bytes,2012-03-22T18:36Z,"It's working fine for me on Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. For everybody that's having problems with the gauges, all you've got to do is start the gauges up. If you go to the 'Super 80 Professional Center', 'Training', and 'Tips & Tricks', then click on 'How to power up the aircraft/cockpit' it'll show you how to start up the gauges."
