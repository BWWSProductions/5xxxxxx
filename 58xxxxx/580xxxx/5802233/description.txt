Masque is the third album by US rock band Kansas, released in 1975

On the heels of their Song for America album, Kirshner Records began to apply pressure to the band for a hit single. After some discussion amongst the band members, Kansas decided on a compromise and went to work on their third album, Masque. Vocalist Steve Walsh contributed a few shorter, more accessible songs to the set, but Kerry Livgren's dark epics retained much of the style from the previous recording. The album is somewhat of a bridge between Song for America's heavier sound Leftoverture's more commercial direction. Although the collection contains some fan favorites such as "Icarus - Borne on Wings of Steel," "The Pinnacle," and "All The World," the shorter songs failed to impress radio audiences. The opening track, "It Takes a Woman's Love (to Make a Man)", was remixed for increased radio airplay, but failed to gain attention.
