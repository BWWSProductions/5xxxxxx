computer configurations indestructible. Once Deep Freeze is installed on a 
workstation, any changes made to the computerâ€”regardless of whether they are 
accidental or maliciousâ€”are never permanent. Deep Freeze provides immediate 
immunity from many of the problems that plague computers todayâ€”inevitable 
configuration drift, accidental system misconfiguration, malicious software 
activity, and incidental system degradation.

Deep Freeze ensures computers are absolutely bulletproof, even when users have 
full access to system software and settings. Users get to enjoy a pristine and 
unrestricted computing experience, while IT personnel are freed from tedious 
helpdesk requests, constant system maintenance, and continuous configuration 
drift.



Benefits of "Deep Freeze Enterprise":

Manage and control large computing environments and easily safeguard the 
information stored on the PCs.

Deep Freeze instantly protects and preserves baseline computer configurations. 
No matter what changes a user makes to a workstation, simply restart to eradicate 
all changes and reset the computer to its original state - right down to the last 
byte.

Expensive computer assets are kept running at 100% capacity and technical support 
time is reduced or eliminated completely. The result is consistent trouble-free 
computing on a truly protected and parallel network, completely free of harmful 
viruses and unwanted programs. 

While Deep Freeze provides bulletproof protection, its non-restrictive approach 
also improves user productivity and satisfaction.

Placing no restrictions on a user's ability to access all system resources, users 
avoid the frustration of downtime due to software conflicts, operating system 
corruption, virus attacks, and many other problems. Users are always assured of 
computers that are consistently operable and available. 

Building on the power of Deep Freeze Standard, Deep Freeze Enterprise offers 
centralized deployment and enhanced flexibility options for customizable 
management of large computing environments.

Deep Freeze Enterprise is the best solution for keeping a large number of PCs 
in top notch state.
