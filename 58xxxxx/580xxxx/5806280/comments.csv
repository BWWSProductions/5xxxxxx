[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-03T10:26Z,"@beerswagger2007

M$ dont ban right away. They wait sometime and do  so called ban waves. But i post the warning then its up to ppl to determine what do with it. ;)"
,xCrosseyesx,2010-09-03T18:44Z,"Yeah M$ usually has two a year when big updates come out, but they log you a long time beforehand so there's really nothing you can do about it except play with no network or harddrive connection (assuming your gamertag is stored on your harddrive or memcard, if it's stored internally I have no clue)
@mascatule: You're starting to piss me off. Stop posting those links. We know how to do a damn Google search."
,chriss321,2010-09-04T19:17Z,hey guys i have a problem i cant load thhe campaign it says i cant load content can someone tellme what i did wrong except that the game works fine 
,agentantz,2010-09-04T20:21Z,Yeah Chris i got the same problem : / Must be the file. I cannot even load the first part of the campaign. I just hope the spiderman torrent im downloading doesnt have problems as its from the same guy.. : /
,agentantz,2010-09-04T20:23Z,also Sunblock did you not test this out to see if it works?
[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-05T00:39Z,yes i test it and so far it works....But i get some very strange loading time and the dvd start to work alot. Even when the games is installed on hd...hmmm.
[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-05T00:45Z,"played 5-6 missions with out any problems so far. But some one have shared ""proper"" one if there is something wrong with this....But i cant say so far its."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-05T00:53Z,What i can see is that some can play it with out any problems and some cant play it at all..i asked some friends i gave the game to...and 3-4 can play it and 2 cant so...dont realy know why...but this is the same as .BONE. shared i only pach the game.
,agentantz,2010-09-06T14:24Z,well it can't be the patch you applied because i tried the spider man game you also uploaded and that works prefectly. I haven't tried putting it on my hd i shall try that. Thanks for reply
,Eksand,2010-09-06T18:40Z,Got the menus and multiplayer working but campaign won't load and neither will firefight. Not able to install the game to the harddrive either. A little help would be appreciated.
,real_14,2010-09-07T23:09Z," well, same type problem, i can playpersonalizada, forge, movie, but i cant firefight and freeze kickme out on the firts level after the bridge"
,Gethyper,2010-09-15T07:09Z,This game kicked so much ass.....I'm buying it. 
,physixmaster,2010-09-29T21:24Z,It keeps asking for an update. It installs it then reboots then ask to install the update again. Over and over it goes and it gets nowhere. Il do some testing as I have two 360's one banned and one not banned so it see if I can figure something out. No one else has posted anyprob like this. Oh and slow loading times and the disk working heavily in the drive is a sign you burn it at the wrong speed like 4x instead of 2.4x
,rodzandz,2011-07-27T04:32Z,Does this have AP 2.5? Can it boot from a spoofed sammy with LT 1.0???
