Product Description

A step-by-step guide to Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Thus Spoke Zarathustra is one of Nietzsche's greatest books, a cross-over text that combines philosophical innovation with literary experimentation. With Zarathustra Nietzsche has attempted a redefinition of the form-content correlation in philosophical writing and as such the text is considered an experiment in philosophical style. It therefore represents a large hurdle for undergraduate students. This projected commentary works on the assumption that access to the philosophical core of the text can only be gained through taking its literary ambitions seriously and that, moreover, these literary ambitions can only be understood as an attempt to realise philosophical ideas. This is a book that is designed to be read alongside Nietzsche and will therefore make the reading and appreciation of the primary material achievable. This approach will be welcomed by students and lecturers alike.
