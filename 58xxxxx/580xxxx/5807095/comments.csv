The fight scene with the black jedi in it he dessert with the purple sword rivals the matrix."
,xdddre,2012-02-04T20:29Z,"This has the best of Star Wars and Genndy Tartakovsky. Fills some gaps with amazing action! Great quality as well.

I'M SEEDING THIS FOREVER"
,tatuu,2012-03-18T17:34Z,"@derrend
that's mace f**kin' windu you idiot, not some ""black jedi in the dessert [sic] with the purple sword"". get your facts straightened out or at least check it on wikipedia first before posting nonsense...
