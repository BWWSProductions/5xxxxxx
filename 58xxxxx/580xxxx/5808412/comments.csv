,chowp,2010-09-04T05:37Z,"@maurelop: He probably found out this comment at their site ""We do personalize the files though on installing so if they end up somewhere where they do not belong we will know who to talk to"""
,lostwallet,2010-09-04T05:51Z,"personalize the files, my ass. That might be a scare tatic. if so we got hackers around here. its only a matter of time before they mess around with the files for them not to recognize.

Good Scare tactic thought"

,jamesk5,2010-09-13T20:45Z,"can anyone help me? my autopilot doesnt work, any suggestions ??"
,4NDRESP,2010-09-14T19:07Z,jamesk5 i have a suggestion for you. Go to http://www.aerosoft.com and purchase the airbus X. 
,jamesk5,2010-09-15T19:55Z,to 4NDRESP - autopilot does work now - didnt realize that you had to use right and left click plus the scroll to work it - anyway i would purchase it however i have had bad experiences in buying planes online - 1st i bought the captain sim 767 pro pack and the autopilot didnt work whatsoever. then i went to buy the the pmdg md-11 autopilot problems and elevator problems - the funny thing is i got the 727 pro pack from captain sim from here for free and everything works perfect! and the c-130 and aerosoft 777 and 747 work perfect - so from now on i rather download for free and do the crack to make the planes work - 
,Jackxon,2010-09-24T13:20Z,There is not any manuals or`...?
,rocket685,2010-10-15T04:01Z,"Please can someone get cockpit chatter for fsx would be truely grateful.

,bcaptain,2010-10-18T15:16Z,"@jamesk5 - maybe because you're a moron? I have no problem with the CS767, have you tried installing new version of fsuipc and the latest patch?"
,kbeattie,2010-10-24T02:25Z,I managed to get the full Aerosoft Airbus X EXE file but can't get to get it cracked. It uses ascrypt_pro.dll instead of ascrypt.dll! Any way to crack it.
