[V],mirogster,2010-09-11T14:14Z,"Eng subs, someone please?"
[T],umbraco1,2010-09-22T14:28Z,"Splendid. I have been looking forward to this one.
- This movie became the runner up as the Norwegian contender to the Oscars 2011, for best Foreign Language Film."
,AnotherStranger,2010-10-05T02:28Z,"tack men jag står bara inte ut med inbrända subs, varför???"
,v3rv3,2011-02-13T19:56Z,"please do not burn subtitles in the movie, better to put external subs (.srt or idx/sub) so we can use w/e subtitles we want (english, french, german, spanish, chinese...) :p

also, why two files and not a big 2000Mo file? 
old scene rules is plain silly today with adsl...

thank you!"
