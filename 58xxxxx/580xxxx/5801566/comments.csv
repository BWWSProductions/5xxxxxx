When I hired this as a VHS tape many, many years ago it had a scene where a husband was inside a large urn cleaning it while the guy supposedly buying it screwed the wife while she looked into it telling her husband what to do.
Unfortunately, that scene isn't in this copy.
Any copies with that scene out there??"
