Hyapatia Lee is your hostess in the most erotic version of Geoffrey Chaucer's 13th century classic youll ever see! The sets are fabulous, the costumes sensational, and the sex is hotter than HOT. Join in the lusty merriment as a group of pilgrims recounts one ribald tale after another on this way to Canterbury.

First there's the classic Miller's Tale. Where a miserly miller cheats two students until the miller's wife and daughter repay the boys with a piston-pumping daisy chain. Playing a gypsy, Hyapatia has a sizzling girl-girl encounter with the Wife of Bath, while later she inflames the crystal balls on two gypsy studs! 

There are many, many more Ribald Tales of Canterbury. And as our lusty travelers reach their final destination, the romantic air of their journey lingers on to become a reality!
