ADOBE FLASH CATALYST CS5 TRAINING MANUAL FOR WINDOWS & MAC

Adobe Flash Catalyst CS5 Classroom in a Book

This official training guide from Adobe will teach readers all they need to know to create rich interactive experiences with Flash Catalyst CS5, Adobe's exciting new interaction design tool. Flash Catalyst CS5 lets designers create real Adobe Flash and Adobe AIR applications without having to learn ActionScript.

Using step-by-step instructions in projects that progressively build skills, readers of this Classroom in a Book will learn how to prepare and import artwork from applications such as Adobe Photoshop and Fireworks into Catalyst, and then add interactive functionality in a familiar interface and with tools that are intuitive to use.

Readers will learn how libraries let them organize and reuse assets, how to use layers to view and control objects, how to work with pages and states to create interactive components, how to add transitions and action sequences, and how to work with video and sound. Readers will also learn to incorporate Flash files from other applications and use Flash Builder to extend their projects' functionality.

The companion CD provides users with all the sample files they need to complete all the projects.

The Classroom in a Book series is by far the best training material on the market. Everything you need to master the software is included: clear explanations of each lesson, step-by-step instructions, and the project files for the students.
