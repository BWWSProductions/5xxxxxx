,jersson,2010-09-24T14:07Z,"I have Office 2010 Beta downloaded from Microsoft, Do I have to remove it to use this activator ?"
,moorkop9,2010-09-29T13:18Z,"I have used this activator on my dutch office 2010 and it works great. The activator is a master piece of work and looks great. It reminds me of the activator of Win7. The KMS activation is automatic every time I start my computer. This means every time office 2010 is licensed for the maximum time. That virus scans gives warnings is normal but means nothing. I looked very well for activators but this one is really the best.

,moorkop9,2010-09-29T13:27Z,"This is the real thing. I looked very well for activators but this one looks very good. I tried it on my dutch Office 2010 and checked the license and is full licensed. It works with autokms activation. That is gives virus warnings is normal but means nothing for this masterpiece. Moreover it is suitable for all the activation of office. This activator has all kind of posibilities.

[T],pkaji123,2010-10-03T04:32Z,"KMS works on all computers,irrespective of the system,you must install a clean version of Office that's all."
