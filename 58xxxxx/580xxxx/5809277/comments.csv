,fo0ki,2010-11-06T13:20Z,Not sure what happened - but my copy is truncated (starts about 20 mins into the movie at the aquarium scene.)
,Otaku1,2010-11-20T23:45Z,IMDB lists the runtime as 104 minutes so this is missing 7-8 minutes.
,MaximilianKohler,2010-11-25T19:02Z,yeah it's missing parts of the movie
,usucdik,2011-01-03T07:49Z,"This is the weirdest thing. I haven't been able to find any information about this, but this copy of the movie appears to have been edited to change the chronological presentation, and one scene is removed.

First off, the movie starts immediately in a scene without any intro stuff. I thought maybe the initial crap was removed to save space.

1 hour in and the credits start rolling. After that, it picks up from scenes that apparently were really at the start of the movie. It plays out, and then it suddenly ends, which leaves the next scene missing. But with the way it is cut, you don't even need the scene at all, and I think the scene is too goofy for the rest of the movie.


This is some sort of insane Ripper's Cut version of the movie that I think is actually very good! It makes a lot of sense, as you don't miss anything important for understanding it and it sets up some good reveals. The stopping point of the video ends up having an incredible impact."
