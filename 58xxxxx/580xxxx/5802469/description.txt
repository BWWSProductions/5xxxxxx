
GROUP NOTES:
All this is,is the same video we released but now synced to some nice line audio ;-)
The audio if turned right up as some noise to it,but it's alot better than the cam audio thats for sure.And if anyone was confused by our work done on our cam release,i'll sum it up short for ya.....
This film is complete no missing scenes.....but we did have to use two sources for the video.
First 5mins are blurry due to the 3D effect and then the rest is fine.
Anyway enjoy this crazy film


After a sudden underwater tremor sets free scores of the prehistoric man-eating fish, an unlikely group of strangers must band together to stop themselves from becoming fish food for the areaâ€™s new razor-toothed residents.
