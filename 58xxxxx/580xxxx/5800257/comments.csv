I know what R5 is... and its not pure DVDrip!

""R5, in the film business, is a copy of a movie made with a telecine machine from an analog source""

""R5 releases differ from normal releases in that they often lack both the image post-processing and special features that are common on DVD releases""

Even the Wiki knows that!

,umarnawazkhan,2010-09-02T09:06Z,"change your upload video's to MP4 or MKV
for high quality
720p - x264

What is x264?

x264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec used for High-Definition movies on HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs. It has a high compression which is way superior to xvid. That means you get more quality at equal bitrates. A 700MB x264 rip will be sharper and more detailed than a 700MB xvid rip from the same source. x264 is the future in DVDrips!

What is a .mkv file?

MKV means matroska video and it is a extensible open standard Audio/Video container (AVI is a container, too!). This file format combines several video streams, audiostreams, subtitles, chapters and information in only one file. It supports new standards like 6-channel AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) audio or x264 video "
,signalcorps,2010-09-02T09:30Z,"I'd like to explain a little something to all of you complaining there are 28176 seeds but only 19 are seeding.  when your client announces to the tracker and you see 28176 seeds it's because there are 28176 seeds.  The 19 is the number of seeds your client is connected to.  You need to tweak your client instead of complain all the time.

Now, when you complain that there are 40504 leechers, well guess what?  You're a leecher too unless you downed 100% of the file."

okey movie bit to long"
,Kale_z,2010-09-17T19:09Z,"""The name R5 refers to DVD Region 5""
""R5 DVD can be almost indistinguishable from a DVDRip""

For everyone who is whining about incorrect tagging: R5 IS A DVDRIP FROM REGION 5 DVD. Why is it so hard to understand? R5-rip means nothing as R5 isn't a format. The source for R5 is a DVD so tagging Region 5 rips as DVDRips is fully acceptable. In fact, before the specification ""R5"" was introduced, these rips were actually called DVDRips.

The only difference between R5 and ""real"" DVDRip is that R5 lacks image post-processing. But the editing is minimal in many ""real"" DVDRips, so the difference in quality is rather small. Also, R5 has no extra features, but that isn't something we pirates are interested in anyway.

However, I agree that there should be a mention about the region where the rip comes from. At least for those who are only looking for the very best quality. In any case, naming these rips only as ""R5"" is totally incorrect and makes no sense. We use the ""DVDRip"" word with R1, R2 and global rips too so what's the point of not using it with R5. The correct name for these rips would be DVDRip(R5), R5-DVDRip or such."

both the sound and picture quality are great
I wasn't so sure about the movie
It reminded me so much of gladiator which is understandable as ridley scott directs and russell crowe stars. accents have never been his strong point ""on my signal, unleash hell ""( in a kiwi accent springs to mind) there was something lacking in the film and for me it dragged on"
,JoeyHepburn,2010-10-02T14:04Z,"chyeah115

You may find that downloading VLC Media Players will solve your sound problem. The problem sounds like an audio codec problem and VLC will provide a fix for this.

Google the term 'VLC Media Player' and once downloaded open your torrented video and enjoy."
,RichardHighHopes,2010-10-03T01:23Z,"Can't you guys tell by the sound that this is a CAM???  The picture quality is very good, I don't know how they managed it, but the sound sucks, it was recorded in a movie theatre.  

If it wasn't, then they put a really shitty soundtrack onto the DVD... why would they put such a crappy soundtrack onto a DVD?  I can't see this being a DVD rip."

I don't know if this happens to everyone but every time there's about half an hour of movie left it starts to skip.  The scene stops and then starts after a 2 or 3 second wait where it left off.  It's happened with Robin Hood, Wolverine, Iron man 2 and Inception.   Any one else?  Later days."
