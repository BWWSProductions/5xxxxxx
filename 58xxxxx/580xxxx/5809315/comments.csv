,oyyouthere,2010-09-04T04:00Z,"seed please :D it's going really slow X_X, and I want a full english  version "
,dan_showbiz,2010-09-04T06:38Z,"does it work on 5.00 m33-6? If it does not, how do i make it work?? "
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-04T06:57Z,"Initial source stated that it does, but i have no way to test it, so you definately should check it on your own."
,drstojko,2010-09-04T16:23Z,When extracting says that the file is corrupt...
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-04T18:01Z,"Would be weird if otherwise, but at mine - archive extracts fine and passes the integrity test. Try extracting via alternative programm (i.e. WinRAR, Total Commander, 7-Zip). It can happen that unpacking software is outdated.

,archphonix12,2010-09-04T19:54Z,its cool i changed to m33 driver and changed region to eur and it works thnx for awesome game :) will seed
,marv101,2010-09-04T20:15Z,Seed please people! Downloading very slowly!
,Atlas91,2010-09-04T20:55Z,"It wasn't working for me at first but I found out how to fix it. If you have the folder KHBBS in the root, delete it. It helps with the compatibility of other games but screws up this one. Also the data install doesn't seem to work, not that it matters since it's not reading from a disk anyway."
,cvoliver,2010-09-04T22:53Z,I am using 5.00 m33-3 and whenever I try any type   of data install it gives me an error. Also on my friends psp which is using m33-6 when I dump the iso into his folder it does not show.
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-04T23:33Z,"Atlas91, i'd really like to put this warning into torrent description, but i can't due to TPB's editing bug atm. And if i'd post it in the comments, sooner or later it will be overflowed by the pages of other comments, the only solution will be reposting, but whatever.

People, if game won't boot for you, try disabling KHBBS-patch plugin if using one.

cvoliver, what on earth do you need data install for? Known bug for many iso-games - data install isn't working. But i belive, you don't even need it to play the game from start to end, no?
And not showing the game in XMB may be regarded to many reasons. Firmwares, plugins and lots of other setup-stuff."
,darkcandy1,2010-09-05T00:07Z,"Works perfectly for me, no problems whatsoever, thanks!  MY only question is, why does it say ""Install Data"" on the game icon before loading up the ISO lol.  And my firmware is 5.00 M33-6."
,Duomaxwell43,2010-09-05T01:34Z,"Is this the actual us/eu version, or is it a translated version?"
,Duomaxwell43,2010-09-05T03:46Z,"To answer my question before (and for future reference) this IS the official English version. Also, I'm running it on a PSP 1001 with 5.00 M33-6 and it works fine! Thanks alot, man!"
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-05T11:03Z,"darkcandy1, to be honest, some funnyman modified the game icon and i was to lazy to put the original one back in place, so i left things as they are.

Always welcome!

P.S.: US version, yeah."
,marv101,2010-09-05T17:27Z,Confirmed as working fine on 5.00 M33-6 here :)
,GoldenTip,2010-09-05T20:24Z,"Sorry if I ask.
I have a problem with the cut scenes.
The cutscenes are freezing...
And it freezes bij loading...
What am I doing wrong ?"
,draih,2010-09-05T20:55Z,"anyone have the original icon?
can you upload it somewhere?"
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-06T01:59Z,"Here are japanese game icon and screen background: http://img196.imageshack.us/g/icon0s.png/
Probably, you know where to put all this stuff."
,emandude2,2010-09-06T02:16Z,i have this noobish question. does this need prometheus
,draih,2010-09-06T02:35Z,thanks man
,FastClau,2010-09-06T03:43Z,"tnx nitrogenUA, works excellent on my psp1000 with 5.5 genD3!!! u're the man!!!!"
,bcda12,2010-09-06T05:48Z,"great torrent dude

question though, the game has several frame rate issues during intense combat and i want to fix it by using the INSTALL DATA

unfortunately, whenever i try to install, it gives me an error, just like cvoliver and it really annoys me

does anyone know what's going on?

it deffinitely not the PSP battery or anything or the Memory Stick cuz i can install other game data :|"
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-06T11:47Z,"emandude2, i don't use prometheus and game works for me like a charm.

bcda12, well, data install won't work for me either, but let's go to basics. If it gives you lag now, while you playing from MS, it will probably give you the same lag, cuz gamedata installs on the same MS, and will be read from there too. The only way i see 'data install' helpful is if gamedata was stored inside iso in some compressed state, and while uncompressing it your psp slows down, but it's just a suggestion. So the most possible solution is to set CPU speed faster, if not done yet."
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-06T11:50Z,"GoldenTip, what firmware do you use?"
,GoldenTip,2010-09-06T13:29Z,"Best NitrogenUA,

I am on firmware 5.50 GEN D-3 and I already deleted the KHBBS map.
I'm totaly not getting it :\

GoldenTip."
,GoldenTip,2010-09-06T13:31Z,"Best NitrogenUA,

I am on firmware 5.50 GEN D-3 and I already deleted the KHBBS map...
I'm not getting it...

GoldenTip."
,GoldenTip,2010-09-06T17:19Z,Sorry for the spam... My PC wasn't working well...
,cloudstrifehammy,2010-09-07T00:33Z,"I'm using the 5.50 GEN-D3 on a PSP 1000. I passed the game to one of my friends who is using the same firmware on the same type of PSP. We attempted the multiplayer feature at the mirage arena in-game... We were able to get to the lobby and actually see each other, however, when one of us tries to set up an event (for example, versus mode) the other can't seem to join and it keeps saying the event has been canceled when it really wasn't. 

Has anyone else tried the multiplayer feature?"
,torrenthelper201017,2010-09-07T13:41Z,can this be played on the psp emulator such as the pcsp thnx pls reply asap
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-08T00:50Z,Tested on JPCSP and PCSP - both not working with this one.
,Ghostmb76,2010-09-08T05:06Z,Thanks! If Its Good I Will Go Buy It At The Store Like I Did With Peace Walker. You Guys Should too!
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-08T19:11Z,"Sure it is! Here is what IGN says about it: ""Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep has the best battle system in the series and one of the most ambitious storytelling devices yet; the game's few issues aren't enough to spoil the fun. With three characters to choose from, plenty of fun mini-games and a rich combat experience, Birth by Sleep comes highly recommended."" Birth by Sleep got an 8.5 from IGN and an ""Editors Choice"". So all my doubts should have been gone for now, if i was you. Also, you can check this torrent out, if possible.

P.S.: Speaking of buying things - i'm not really some kind of badman, just can't afford it. And i'm really sry 'bout it."
,MrBigDick,2010-09-10T00:04Z,"When I start the game it says "" The game could not be started (80020148)"" can someone please help me????"
,Xylone,2010-09-10T06:16Z,"Thanks a lot! It works fine, I'm currently playing Ventus' story line, but there's a little problem, scratch that, a BIG problem, well for me.

The moment the loading screen appears when I land on Radiant Garden, it hangs and turns off by itself. D:

Shed some light? :D

Thanks."
,Xylone,2010-09-10T08:08Z,"Nevermind, I checked my CFW, it's actually on GEN-D (FULL). Haha, funny, I could have sworn it was on GEN-D3. :P

It works! :D

Time to finish this. :P"
,cloudstrifehammy,2010-09-10T08:15Z,"I'm still kinda turned off by the fact that we can't play multiplayer with this. :/ I was really looking forward to that. I heard there was some kind of patch that was made to the Japanese version so that people could play multiplayer, I was wondering if it also worked on this version, or if they have to come up with a completely different patch? "
,djinn66,2010-09-11T04:04Z,"thanks, NitrogenUA. it works perfectly. But I had to turn off the KHBBS plugin for it to work :|"

,NitrogenUA,2010-09-19T00:09Z,"ladysin7171, i strongly recommend you updating your firmware. It should help.

BabyBlueJeff, try using prometheus plugin, or prometheus firmware-update, both available for M33 firmwares."
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-19T00:16Z,"Also, for all you guys having Black Screen consider changing your 'UMD ISO Mode' setting (NP9660 / M33 recommended) and 'Fake region' setting as stated above by archphonix12. And dont forget to remove KHBBS plugin (actualy KHBBS folder) if using one. Cheers."

@anyone having difficulties loading game,

-unrar into the ISO folder on PSP
-hold down the ""R"" trigger when powering up PSP
-select ""plugins"" and disable w/e you aren't using
-enjoy!

-This game is worth it. Great PSP game. Please support the platform by purchasing it if you haven't already. And be sure to thank all who enable us to leave our UMDs in the case in favor of memory sticks :D"
