Jim Street (Colin Farrell) is a former S.W.A.T. team member, who along with his partner Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner), is thrown off the team in the aftermath of a controversial 
decision they made during a robbery/hostage standoff. 
Gamble quits the force in disgust, but for Street, being a policeman is his life and he agrees to a demotion, hoping to someday have the chance to redeem himself and 
once again wear the privileged S.W.A.T. uniform. 
He gets that chance when team commander Dan "Hondo" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson) is assigned to recruit and train five top-notch officers for a new Special Weapons and Tactics unit. 
After weeks of rigorous physical training, the new team is immediately thrown into action when a notorious drug lord, offers a $100 million bounty to anyone who can free him from police 
custody. 
As they escort the kingpin out of Los Angeles into the hands of the Feds, the S.W.A.T. team is pursued by a ruthless and well-armed band of mercenaries.
