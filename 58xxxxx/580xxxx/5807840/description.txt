SpyHunter Key Features:

*Easy to Use
SpyHunter is an advanced technology designed specially for people like you, not 
experts. It is automatically configured out of the box to give you optimal 
protection with limited interaction so all you need to do is install it for 
immediate and ongoing protection.


*SpyHunter Scanner 
SpyHunter has been carefully engineered to be powerful and complete enough for the
most demanding technical professional, yet simple enough for a first-time computer 
user to safely and effectively utilize. With just a simple click, SpyHunter Scanner
will scan your computerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memory, registry, cookies, and files. Items found to be 
infected will then be listed for you. 

To find out more information about a specific object, merely select it. When you 
are ready to remove any infected files, all you have to do is check the box next 
to the item and hit the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Start RemoveÃ¢â‚¬Â button. All objects that you remove are 
then placed in SpyHunterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quarantine area. Simple as that!

 
*Process Guard
SpyHunter contains an advanced Process Guard feature, designed to give complete 
control over which processes are authorized to run on your system, and allowing 
you to identify and stop malicious processes before they are even executed. Using 
Process Guard, you are able to allow certain processes to run, while blocking
those do might feel are malicious or unnecessary. 

A list of these processes is available to you to edit as you see fit. By selecting 
a specific item, you can recieve Windows information related to that process or, 
alternatively, you may select the "More Info" button to retrieve accurate and 
up-to-date information off the Internet.
 

*Registry Guard
In addition to Process Guard, SpyHunter contains a Registry Guard feature, 
designed to give you complete control over which processes are authorized to add 
auto-start entries to your Windows registry. This feature will identify and stop 
any processes that attempt to secretly auto-start malware by exploiting the 
Windows registry. 

Registry Guard works exactly the same as Process Guard, with a list of processes 
presented to the user to peruse, offering options that allow certain processes to 
write to the registry, while being able to block others. The "More Info" button 
retrieves accurate and up-to-date information from the Internet.

 
*Active X Guard
An ActiveX control is an object that is often used to extend different 
functionalities to Internet Explorer. These include browser toolbars, document 
viewer plugins, and a wide array of other add-ons. Many ActiveX controls are 
actually beneficial, but malicious programs frequently use ActiveX controls in 
order to embed themselves onto your system through browser security exploits or 
compromised security settings. 

SpyHunterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definition database contains a comprehensive list of malicious ActiveX 
objects, which will be automatically loaded to the blocked list. This file is 
updated continuously by our definitions team. SpyHunter will automatically block 
any ActiveX objects in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“DisabledÃ¢â‚¬Â list from being executed, while also 
offering you the option to manually add and remove certain ActiceX objects 
from the list.

  
*Network Sentry
The SpyHunter Network Sentry is designed to give you complete control over your 
system networking settings, and to prevent malicious objects from modifying and 
disrupting your Internet connection. In addition to HOSTS file protection, 
SpyHunter also offers an option to protect other Windows system files from 
unauthorized modification. These can be manually selected by the user, offering 
you a lot more control over what you wish to keep safe. 

SpyHunter also contains advanced functionality designed to prevent malware from 
hijacking your desired Internet Explorer homepage. Lastly, SpyHunter can be 
configured to monitor your DNS servers and notify if an unsolicited modification
takes place. This prevents tricky Trojan and malware organizations from 
redirecting you to a phishing or malware site.


*Scan Scheduler
SpyHunter incorporates an advanced Scan Scheduler feature, which allows you to 
run a complete SpyHunter scan at a pre-set time, even if you are away from your 
computer. Easy to access and use, the Scan Scheduler allows you to pre-set the 
scan time at daily, weekly and monthly intervals. If you opt for the daily scan, 
you can choose to run the scan every day, every other day, every weekday, or at 
any interval of days that you choose. If you choose the weekly scan, you will be 
able to select the day of the week that your scan will be scheduled for and for 
the monthly scan, select the day of the month that your scan will be scheduled 
for. Please note that your computer must be powered on at the time that your scan 
is scheduled to run. If the computer is not turned on, the scan cannot execute!
