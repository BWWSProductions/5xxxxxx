This summer, the party-starting, festival-happy Montreal plastic-funk duo Chromeo returns. On August 17 September 14, they'll release Business Casual, their third album and the follow-up to the 2007 breakthrough Fancy Footwork, via Atlantic. The band is still finalizing the order of the songs, but we've got the titles of all the songs on the album below. It seems pretty incredible that Chromeo hadn't already released a track called "Hot Mess".

Some fun facts about Business Casual: Solange Knowles lends her voice to "When the Night Falls"; Cassius member and Phoenix producer Philipe Zdar, a longtime Chromeo collaborator, mixed the disc; and, as with Fancy Footwork, Surface 2 Air did the artwork.

Before the album drops, they'll also play a couple of big festivals. The duo has dates lined up at Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo. And at the 'Roo, they'll fulfill their destiny by sharing a stage with 80s pop legend Daryl Hall.

Tracklist:
01. Hot Mess 03:40
02. I'm Not Contagious 03:39
03. Night By Night 03:47
