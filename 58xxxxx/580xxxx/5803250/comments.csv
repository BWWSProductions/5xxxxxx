Tried it on WBFS and it crashes, also burned on Verbatim -r at 2.4x... nothing at all.... if you want to waste your time, and/or create some nice coasters... go ahead and download it.  I'll try to see if I can rent this game and get a real copy up here."

Hasn't been seeded a lot so it is slow 3 day download. I used mac snow leopard then dis utility and burned at 4 X. Works perfectly. 
Thank you for the upload Consolastope. 
I will continue to seed until finished."
