[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-03T19:55Z,"@ Everyone - Sorry it has taken so long to respond to some of you guys, I have been very busy, I have been getting a lot of spam, and was having problems with the hotbox.ru email address but it has been fixed. Also, I got my skull here, and I was promoted to Mod on another site! (^_^) 

As soon as I get stuff that people have requested, I will encode and upload it. I promise. (^_^) 

Also, my B-Day was yesterday, so I was pretty much lazy all day. My party is going to be in a few days, I cant wait to see what I got. I turned 20, it is exciting, look out 21 here I come. lol. (^_^)

Right now, I am downloading Roswell - the Complete series, Lost - the final season, Heroes S04, RoboCop Trilogy, Jersey Shore S01, the rest of Dirty Sexy Money S01, and several other things like XXX stuff for XXX packs. BTW I am downloading on 3 computers, 1 on my network and 2 on neighbors Wi-Fi. 

Right now, I am uploading these to the seedbox - 
Seasons - 
The New Adventures of Old Christine S03, 
Sons of Anarchy S02, 
The Real Hustle S01 

Movies - 
The Band From Hell, 
Evolution, 
The Drawn Together Movie - The Movie, 
Whirlygirl, 
Dumping Lisa

Stand-Up - 
Russell Peters - Red White And Brown,  (Russell Peters is f%#king hilarious!) 

Dane Cook Isolated Incident (Uncensored)

I am also encoding some XXX-packs, some movie-packs, some movies, some tv-shows, and several music video-packs."

[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-03T23:18Z,"@ TKOG11 - I thought that I would give everybody a couple of days to catch up on my stuff and also I wanted to take a short break, so I dont over do it. lol. Also, it means a lot that you are helping me seed as many of my torrents at max speed! Thanks! (^_^)

@ everyone - I plan on uploading around 3-5 torrents in the next 48-72 hours."
