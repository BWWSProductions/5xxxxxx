if u use mpc, right click then subtitles>choose which sub u want to use.. usually this is because scorp insert soft subtitle for them to promote their 400mb(or 300mb?) website.. the text that appear at the beginning or ending of the movie... when you have another sub, rename it to the same name as the video file and the do as i say above... I dont know about VLC (because I hate it ) but i guess it should be the same thing..."
