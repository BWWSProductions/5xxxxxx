Brainphreak TV - Vol 2

This is what MTV would be like if I had control... A compilation of videos by some of the greatest artists ever, many of which you probably never heard of.
These videos were all taken fromor filmed by me on location so they are FREE. I focused on visual 'trippy' stuff and accompanied by good music or sound.
