,Otik,2010-09-17T00:48Z,Looks interesting. Is there a volume 1?
,brainphreak,2010-09-19T08:34Z,"There is a volume 1 yes, I have not uploaded it yet, its a bit worse quality since I had originally planned to just use it personally. Due to popular demand now people are copying the dvd all over the place, this prompted me to create part 2 and upload it. Ill upload part 1 if there is interest. As of now Ive uploaded over 12GB of data and your the only comment! "
