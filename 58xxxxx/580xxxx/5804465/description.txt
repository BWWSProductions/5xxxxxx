RecBoot v1.2

RecBoot is a utility for Windows and Mac users which allow you to put your iPhone / iPod Touch in recovery mode easily. Its a great utility for for those iPhone users who's iPhone Home or Sleep/Wake button is not fully functional.

Moreover this utility saves you from learning the 3-4 steps of putting your iPhone into recovery mode manually. Normally you need to put your iPhone into recovery mode when your want to do a firmware restore.

RecBoot has very simple interface, only two buttons i.e "Enter Recovery Mode" which puts your iPhone to recovery mode and "Exit Recovery Mode" which takes your iPhone out of recovery mode option.

Enjoy!!
