Tonight Obama will announce the â€œofficialâ€ end of Bushâ€™s illegal excursion in Iraq, even though we will still maintain tens of thousands of troops there.  But the violence in Afghanistan, that other front in the never-ending terror wars, still increases with 53 more dead in August, 18 of those since last Saturday.

How much longer will we allow the corporations to dictate how many American lives and Afghan lives will die for their profits?  How is it the NeoCons in Congress complain about enormous federal deficits when we have spent billions in this bloody, un-winnable, expensive payoff to Bush Crime Family cronies?

On a brighter note, weâ€™ll hear from teabaggers in their own words!  Excerpts from interviews at the Glenn Beck tent revival last weekend.  You donâ€™t want to miss this!  Watch it here and weep for the nation.
