,tommo39,2010-09-04T10:17Z,there are BETTER defrag programs than this!!
,.Leto.,2010-09-04T22:01Z,"same question, where do you copy/paste the activation code? there's nothing in the menus. and since it's already saying Licensed to AGAiN does it mean that this software was already registered?"
[T],pkaji123,2010-09-05T06:38Z,"If it's already licensed leave it,otherwise you may need to insert the key."
,TopHouse,2010-09-05T16:28Z,"The installer try's to install but at about 95% it aborts and backtracks, also in the installer util, the shortcut to ""DkActivationReminder"" is a non target shortcut.

Anyone else had this?"
,TopHouse,2010-09-06T01:29Z,"Re my above comment, common problem, read this :-

http://www.techimo.com/forum/technical-support/99459-error-1920-diskeeper.html

But shortcut to activator on installer is still faulty."
,Gilou27,2010-09-06T18:36Z,"Same behaviour as the one described by TopHouse...

According to Diskeeper's documentation, installation is only possible il a ""Licence file"" is present in the directory the software is installed from. 

It doesn't seem that any such file is present in the the downloaded stuff"
,Spixe1,2010-09-11T18:43Z,so basically this wont install right?  i'm getting the rollback at 95% too
,CaptPeacock,2010-09-16T19:38Z,tommo39:  What do you consider better than Diskeeper 2010?
