,Exodus666,2011-07-15T19:39Z,"guess i should have read the comments before downloading.
This is a DUBBED version!

As in the actors move their lips but make no sound while some other guys in a sound studio read a script about something vaguely similar.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
Hopefully we can get a goo quality version in the original language or just buy it in the store :-P"
