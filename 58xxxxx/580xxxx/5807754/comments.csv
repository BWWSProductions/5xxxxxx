,StormtrooperZ,2010-09-03T14:52Z,"Can anyone confirm that this is the english version of the game?

I got fooled twice already where I downloaded the english version and ended up with the german version..."
,StormtrooperZ,2010-09-03T19:08Z,"Game is completely in german, no option to change the speech/language to english. The added file loca.spr probably translates all the text to Spanish, but you're still stuck with german voice acting."
,plufi,2010-09-04T03:55Z,LOL
,mineuvon,2010-09-04T15:15Z,"Yeah, the motherfucker is in german."
,mrgennaro,2010-09-05T14:07Z,"If you manage to complete the installation process in German (which shouldn't be too hard), then you can copy the file loca.spr to the installation directory, which transforms the game into English (both the speech and the subtitles). So this actually is the English version of the game."
,Gateto,2010-09-06T15:51Z,"Confirm that after the German installation and adding the file loca.spr to the installation directory game runs with English language and subtitles.

Only the main menu (where u choose new game, load, etc.) is in German.
The game itself is in English.
Good job uploader - i really wanned this game in English :)
Thumbs up!"
,deakka,2010-09-06T17:34Z,how do you unlock it? i dont see a .txt with a code or any kind of crack or keygen?

,Gateto,2010-09-07T10:35Z,"The game is not locked and does not require a key to install.
After the installation though you need to grab the exe file (the file is inside the image \crack) and replace it over the installed original.
DONT forget to copy loca.spr file over the originally installed file - so you can use the English language inside the game.

Cheers
(P.S. - i played the demo of the game and had a save - its compatible with this version - and i was able to continue my journey from where i left it in to the demo)"
,crniopanak1,2010-09-19T16:01Z,srry guys but tell me where you find that loca.spr file? 
,unreal,2010-09-21T02:01Z,look in the dl folder
,wootletootle,2010-09-26T04:50Z,Many thanks.
,rocco_sifredi,2010-09-27T15:40Z,"Stupid spanish! Why do you write that is ""Idiomas: Inglés"" when the game is in German???? MORON!"
,skreemer,2010-10-03T09:55Z,"mrgennaro and gateto are right. thanks consolasatope for the upload!

come on, youÂ´re windows users and should be able to overwrite two simple files. if not, buy the game and stop complaining!

if you want to _quit_ the game, click on the street plate to the right of the main screen or play the demo to see where itÂ´s located. savegame files in the demo are compatible with this release, iÂ´ve tried it myself."
,mas111,2010-10-12T18:50Z,"Confirm working!
Using Win7 64. loca.spr file is in DL location and crack is in the ISO. Put both in install location and replace it and it will work.

Note that installation and main meny will be in german but in game conversations and text will be in english!"
,tlopez07,2010-10-23T11:20Z,where is dl folder?????????? is it on iso or is it in directory where game has intalled???
,Meddi_the_Strong,2010-11-17T02:33Z,"ACHTUNG * ACHTUNG
This game is in German! "
,zumberman,2011-01-06T01:47Z,"The torrent contains the file loca.spr with English audio and subtitles. Very very few cut scenes with speech with are in German, but these are very few, very short, they have English subtitles and actually it works well because it is 90% the Germans that speak.

However the bonus content has 100% German audio."
,barnabee18,2011-01-06T14:21Z,"I burned a DVD with the image, then installed from the DVD, and patched with the crack and language patches. It seems to work fine. If there are any gameplay problems I'll post a follow-up comment. The main menu IS in German, but the dialog and speech is in English. If someone could post and seed a full English version, that'd be nice tho."
,hexrider,2011-01-22T19:26Z,"the graphics look great, but hows the gameplay???

worth the 4 gigs?"
,WiiZy,2011-02-19T13:47Z,"The Torrent is 100% functional and awesome for adventure.
The main language is in English, with some German inside.
No worries there is the subttile, which is in the torrent!

Nice job, to the uploader and Deep Silver!!"

,hexrider,2011-03-04T00:17Z,"I'll answer my own question: amazing graphics & cutscenes, & the gameplay involves some clever puzzle solving, not too difficult but a few stumpers.
  Maps are very small & the game is quit short.  You could prob. whiz thru it in 6+ hrs. if you skip all the dialog.  Interesting char. & story.  
After a year plus of shooters, I found it quit relaxing to play this.  

If you're into adv. games, its well worth the download!
(note: the entire game has English dialogue & subs)"
,thewatchmaker,2011-03-15T14:55Z,nice relaxing game. thanks to uploader
,rankidd,2011-04-07T18:23Z,Works just fine and it's English after copying the loca-file. Looks like a great game also. Though that's pretty obvious since it's from Deep Silver. Easy to recommend if you liked the Secret Files games.
,juxta99,2011-04-12T14:05Z,"Yeah this is a great game! Should pay for it when I'm rich so they'll make more, no worries about the language it's really easy to install and run"
,wiimii,2011-04-29T13:14Z,"Many thanks - works perfectly in English after overwriting 'loca.spr'. Also, to laucnh the game 'fsasgame.exe' crack is on the mounted iso."

,cgcool,2011-10-18T09:31Z,Help! I can't find the loca.spr file that I have to copy to the installation directory in the iso file.
,cgcool,2011-10-18T09:57Z,My last comment might not have been too clear.  I just cant find the loca.spr file in the iso that I have to copy from the iso file to the installation directory
