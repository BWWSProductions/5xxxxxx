,chong67,2010-09-16T22:05Z,"Anyone else notice that after a few minutes, the program will auto shut off and close out?"
,narfdude,2010-11-15T05:52Z,"Thanks for this one, man.

@chong67 yeah i noticed that too. just change the health check interval in the options to a longer time. I set mine to 8 minutes."
,cjdexter,2010-12-28T09:02Z,Program works well except for the random exiting after a minute or so as chong67 mentioned. Changing the health monitor time or installing the program didn't fix the problem for me.
