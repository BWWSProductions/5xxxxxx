Fonda on Fonda (1992) (TV) 
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104284/

Nicely produced and touching documentary has Jane Fonda hosting this look at the work of her father. Not only do we get interviews with his friends but we also get to see clips from his movies as well as rare footage taken on the sets of several films including color footage of MY DARLING CLEMENTINE and FORT APACHE. We see clips from countless other movies including FAIL-SAFE, MISTER ROBERTS, YOUNG MR. LINCOLN and of course 12 ANGRY MEN, which was apparently Fonda's favorite film. Those interviewed include Peter Fonda, James Stewart, Sidney Lumet, Katharine Hepburn and Fonda's final wife Shirlee.
