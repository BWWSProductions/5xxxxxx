	RELEASE NOTES
	______________

	From the streets of North London to the mountains of Norway, Marlon Brandy has travelled 	the world and has the stories to prove it.  The twenty-something UK emcee has always been down to Earth; waxing lyrical about subjects such as dead end jobs, growing up, relationships and breakups he is one of the few emcees that listeners can actually relate to. 

On his debut album "On The Rocks, the British/Norway based MC proves once and for all why he is one of the most talented emcees to come out of the UK in the last 10 years.  "On The Rocks" is filled to the brim with witty wordplay and banging beats" courtesy of some of the finest underground hip hop producers in the UK.
