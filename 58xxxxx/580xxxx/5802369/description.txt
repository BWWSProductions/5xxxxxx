What is Muscle Revolution? Introducing Chad Waterbury's long-awaited book! Most of my programs focus on delivering what most of my readers want; the biggest possible muscles, obtained as fast and efficiently as possible without the need for anabolic drugs. 

Muscle Revolution: Thereâ€™s more to building bigger muscles than walking into a gym and lifting heavy weights. In Muscle Revolution Chad Waterbury explores the hidden keys to a better physique. The first is performanceâ€”training your body to improve strength and function as a direct path to improving appearance. The second is recoveryâ€”managing the amount of fatigue you induce and then making sure your body had enough time between workouts to get the benefits you want from each session. But thatâ€™s just a tiny fraction of what youâ€™ll find in Muscle Revolution. 

Muscle Revolution - Improving strength and overall conditioning are important aspects of my programs, but to many readers, they're side effects. The real purpose is bigger muscles. 

The Total Strength Program (TSP) is different. Sure, you'll get bigger muscles in any version of this 12-week program (and there are several versions to choose from, as I'll explain). But this time, the goal is to make yourself stronger. Much, much stronger. And not just stronger in general - although that, like hypertrophy will happen. I want you to get stronger in one or more of the three powerlifts: bench press, deadlift, and squat. But don't mistake this as a powerlifting program, and nothing more. It's a terrific program for powerlifters, but my goal is to help you use the powerlifts to reach your own goals, whether you compete in anything or work out for the classic reasons - strength, size, power, performance. 

The key to TSP is one of the most effective strength-building methods I've used in more than a decade of working with athletes; the supramaximal hold. Don't let the jargon put you off. This is more straight forward than it sounds!
