,TheFonzOfTorrentz,2011-04-29T05:44Z,"This isnt ""Get The Munchies"" that title is fake in every country this movie is actually Harold And Kumar Go To WhiteCastle and not Get The Munchies.So dont know why the uploader called it that. im guessing its to get more downloads because people might think its a Harold And Kumar they havent seen yet."

 excuse me get your facts right before you accuse an uploader of putting the wrong title, i do not know where your from but when i lived in newcastle i bought this film and get the munchies was the title in the shops, i dont know if your aware but alot of films released get their titles changed in quite a few films, for e.g jennifers body was advertised in cinema before release as party at the disco!

,thekimster,2011-11-02T14:59Z,"The film was renamed to Harold And kumar Get The Munchies  in the Uk as THERE ARE NO WHITECASTLE in the uk, so they wouldnt get the reference. A lot of moviesare retitled for different audiences, such as the first harry potter wa for american audiences."
,IseeingI2I,2011-12-01T09:17Z,^this mofo right here hit the nail on the head except harry potter was renamed do to bullshit religious reasons where as this is a geological constrain
