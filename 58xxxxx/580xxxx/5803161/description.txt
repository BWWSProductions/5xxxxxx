Jerry & Esther Hicks 
http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/index.php

For over 20 years Esther & Jerry Hicks have published hundreds of books, audio recordings and videos, and have conducted up to 60 workshops a year. Their work is derived from the teachings of "Non-Physical Source Energy" whom they refer to as "Abraham".

The Teachings of Abrahamâ„¢ are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience.

â€œThe thrill of the ride is carved out of the contrast. Without the contrast, you could not decide.â€

Answers and inspiration from the Non-Physical entity Abraham â€” whom Esther calls â€œinfinite intelligenceâ€ and Jerry refers to as â€œthe purest form of love Iâ€™ve ever encountered.â€

Thank you to all who participated to make this possible!
