Plot:
Two young couples are driving through a 
remote forest when their car breaks down. 
When a run-in with a curious grizzly bear 
ends up with the bear being shot to death, 
the bear's mate arrives on the scene and 
vengefully attacks their van. The couples 
are trapped inside the disabled car and 
must come up with clever ways to survive. 
As they battle the surprisingly intelligent 
creature, and contemplate their uncertain 
fate, secrets begin to emerge that threaten 
to tear the group apart before the bear does.
