Plot

The Yangs are a well-known family of soldiers in the service of the government but are betrayed by a government official (Wang Lung Wei) conspiring with the Mongols. All of the Yang family males except the 4th, 5th, and 6th brothers are killed (played by Hsiao Ho, Gordon Liu and Fu Sheng respectively). 4th brother is captured by the Liao and is not mentioned again (in the source story he marries a Liao princess and returns). Fu Sheng loses his mind after the death of his family, while the other brother (Gordon Liu), takes refuge in a temple to put his anger and past behind him. Liu's superb martial arts skill, particularly with the quarterstaff, impress the temple's senior monks. After refusing to leave the temple at first, Liu later fights for the right to depart after he learns that his sister (Kara Hui) has been captured by the conspirators and a senior monk is killed by the Mongols. Liu confronts the Mongols and during the ensuing battle to free his sister, the monks from the temple arrive to lend support and help him to defeat the Mongols.
