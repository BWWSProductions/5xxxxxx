Enrico Rava\'s 2004 outing, Easy Living, marked not only his return to the ECM
label after a 17-year absence, but the complete maturation of his quintet, which
at that time had been gigging together for four years. The Words and the Days
sees most of the same band return with one major chair: Rava\'s great foil,
pianist Stefano Bollani who released his acclaimed solo piano album on the
label, has been replaced by the fluid, more percussive Andrea Pozza. The program
consists of seven Rava originals, a cover of Don Cherry\'s \"Art Deco\" performed
as a wonderfully warm and spirited duet with trombonist Gianluca Petrella, one
each by drummer Roberto Gatto (\"Traps\"), and bassist Rosario Bonaccorso (\"Sogni
Proibiti\" [\"Forbidden Dreams\"]), and a version of Russ Freeman\'s \"The Wind,\"
written as a vehicle for the late Chet Baker. Typical of this quintet recording,
Rava digs into the jazz tradition and brings to it his lyrical gift as a
composer, an improvising soloist and an arranger. His reading of \"The Wind\" is a
fine example. Keeping Baker\'s sparseness in phrase, he infuses it with the
echoing presence of Petrella, playing just a shade behind the melody, and then
playing only parts of it and adding a bit of humor and drama to the work to make
it a bit noir-ish rather than a straight nostalgia piece. Gatto\'s dancing brush
work adds to the present tense understanding of the tune and is underscored by
Pozza\'s painterly piano lines. Only the bassline by Bonaccorso keeps the tune
rooted in history.

Conversely, \"Echoes of Duke,\" which immediately proceeds from it, is a firm case
in point of Rava\'s view of jazz tradition as living in the present and pointing
to the future. Using the scuttlebutt rhythmic impulses of the Jimmy Blanton-Ben
Webster band and the lyric improvisation of Ellington\'s great brass frontliners,
Rava nonetheless moves the tune just outside enough to be a new and sprightly
read on the blues. \"Serpent\" is an abstract piece that roots itself in the
skeletal remnants of Miles Davis\' modal period in the mid- to late \'60s. The
blues are everywhere present, but they are stretched almost to the breaking
point, and Pozza\'s commanding, empathic solo here is nearly breathtaking. The
final piece, the nine-minute \"Dr. Ra and Mr. Va,\" is the best example of the
ensemble\'s inner dialogue, wrapping a minimal chart in grand poetic
designs. Rava\'s solo offers hints as to where he wants the band to go, and they
don\'t just follow, they end up on the frontline with him. It begins so warm and
leisurely it\'s deceptive. There is a lot of spatial organizing going on
here. Despite the chart, there are moments of improvisation happening in the
lyric, and in its harmonic interpolation by Pozza and then Petrella. The tune is
like a MÃ¶bius strip, changing places with itself throughout its length. Once
more, Rava dazzles with his grasp of the languages of jazz: its textures, its
rhythms, its dynamics and above all, of course, its secretive and inventive
melodic improvisation. There is no let down here from Easy Living; The Words and
the Days is a worthy companion that confidently stands not in the previous
recording\'s shadow, but on a ledge of its own.
