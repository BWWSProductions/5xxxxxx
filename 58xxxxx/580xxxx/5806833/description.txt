It is surprising that this obscure session featuring Herbie Mann with the Bill Evans Trio (making its first recordings following the sudden death of bassist Scott LaFaro just a short time after the trioâ€™s landmark gig at the Village Vanguard) only reappeared on LP during the initial wave of CD reissues during the 1980s, but it is available once again nearly 40 years after it was completed.  Mann, who has changed his style numerous times throughout his long career, is heard exclusively in a straight-ahead and bop context on this pair of studio dates.  Evans, who studied flute through his college years, rarely recorded with a flutist (Jeremy Steig joined him on a later record for Verve), though he was fond of the instrument; the capable Chuck Israels on bass and drummer Paul Motian round out the trio.  The low-key â€œWillow Weep for Meâ€ and impressionist composer Erik Satieâ€™s Gymnopedie bring out the lyricism of Mannâ€™s playing, though the trioâ€™s backing is very understated.  Things open up a bit with a sparkling take of Cole Porterâ€™s â€œI Love You.â€  Mannâ€™s two originals, â€œNirvanaâ€ and â€œCashmere,â€ arenâ€™t quite as memorable; substituting one of Evansâ€™ compositions for either of them might have provided some additional spark.  Fans of either Herbie Mann or Bill Evans will want to acquire this enjoyable CD. ~ by Ken Dryden, AMG
