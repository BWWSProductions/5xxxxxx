IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Robin Hood 2010

Right the source was great....one of the better R5's we've seen....only thing that really needed
changing was the brightness levels and make it a bit more alive,as it was dull looking.
So all we've done is did a script and added white balance,brightness,contrast,chroma,hue,sat,intes and
sharpness.....oh along with the normal crop and resize ;-)
The subs were already in english  ( when needed ) which is a change as they normally aren't :)
The audio on it was a nice english 5.1 audio track so it was a simple demux and remux .

We opted for the larger file size though so we could keep bitrate decent as it was a long film and we also wanted
to keep the original audio track so ......Any lower and i think it would spoil it.
(well still watchable but we'd rather have better quality anyday).

Also nice dvdr on it's way aswell ......so enjoy folks :)
