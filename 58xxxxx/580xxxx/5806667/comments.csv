,LHREnder,2010-09-15T23:57Z,"THIS DISC DOES WORK, AND YOU CAN STEALTH IT YOUR SELF.

ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THE FILE FOR THE MULTIPLAYER LEVEL REFLECTION IS NOT COMPLETE.

IT LOADS TO 50% EVERYTIME. only draw back to that is that when online it makes matchmaking never choose that level.

OTHER THAN THAT THIS COPY IS !

99% LEGIT

I DARE YOU TO DO BETTER"
