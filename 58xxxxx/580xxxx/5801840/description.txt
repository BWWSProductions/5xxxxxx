Vol. 29 of the Rolling Stone Rare Trax Series. Funky as hell but suffers unfortunately a little bit from bad soundquality. Still good enough for ipods though and those samplers were anyway just made to make you interested into the artists and look for their other work. Definite Highlights are Ripple and Choclate Milk! Make sure to check them out.
