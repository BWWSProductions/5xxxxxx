Insane in the brain hip hop group Cypress Hill became the first Latino act to achieve multi-platinum status when they stormed the charts in 1993 with their second album Black Sunday. Their cannabis endorsing hits I Wanna Get High, Legalize It and Hits from the Bong became anthems for a smoking generation, with rapper B-Real's nasal vocals setting them apart from previous rap groups. 

Since 1996, band members DJ Muggs, B-Real, Eric Bobo and Sen Dogg have collaborated with fellow rap and rock artists on side projects in addition to continuing their output as Cypress Hill. They flexed their muscle recording a track for former wrestler Tazz and were featured in the video game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas with their track How I Could Just Kill A Man.

Cypress Hill began their Rise Up tour in support of their new album of the same name in April 2010. They bring their hazy shade of West Coast rap to the Main Stage at both Reading and Leeds festivals.
