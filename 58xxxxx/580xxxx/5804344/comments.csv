The quality is absolutely remarkable for 720p, in my opinion, with bitrates averaging 6500K."
,charlestoast,2010-11-23T20:36Z,"whilst I appreciate the upload, I feel that it might have been accessible to more people if the bitrate had been reduced - halved even. It's way too high, and past the point of diminishing returns. Add to that the numerous picture break-ups. Still preferable to the lower res uploads, and probably not so problematical for those fortunate enough to have faster connections."
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-03T11:27Z,charlestoast. The quality is flawless and any problems you have are to do with your dodgy hardware/software. The bitrate is not too high at all; you need to upgrade.
,baybeh,2011-06-21T14:36Z,Are these all the 3 episodes or just the first one?
,ilnot1,2011-06-29T19:48Z,@baybeh You have to click on the number '8' that is next to the word 'Files:' at the top of the torrent page.
,kugasvin,2012-01-04T16:06Z,Thanks!!
,fillinthisspace,2012-01-16T16:22Z,"I tend to agree with charlestoast to a certain extent, although how do you tell what bitrate was really required when doing a 2 pass encode?
I don't understand why anyone would still use 2 pass encoding.

I downloaded series 2 as HDTV 720p torrents, which used CRF encoding, and at a CRF value of 19 the largest was 1.5GB. Take that down to CRF 18 and you might hit 2GB but it does make it hard to understand why Bluray encodes require something like double that bitrate."
,revolver75,2012-01-21T23:32Z,"size is gd quality is gd bigger size bitrate better quality thats why i have 6tb hdd space also higher bitrate helps with larger tv's had no probs here played perfect on htpc & 50"" plasma if i have any fault being picky the dd 5.1 was only 448k rather than 640k or most bd use dts that would have been nice but top upload keep up the high bitrate/quality thx."
,ffsihateu,2012-05-30T19:58Z,"@-jonny-: Dodgy hardware/software? Quality may be flawless, but to some, even most, it would've been flawless at half the bitrate as well. Bitrate isn't really an indication of quality, as it varies source to source, but typically ~6.5Mbps is close to crf 14, which is overkill in my opinion. For me, crf 18 is transparent, and that's 2-3Mbps typically."
