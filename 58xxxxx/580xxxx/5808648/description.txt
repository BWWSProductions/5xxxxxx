This is the re-issue of the older Comedy Central Presents Stand-Up Pack.
Contains the entire 14 seasons aired until now, specials and roasts.
The only two videos missing are:

311-  Victoria Jackson  
The N.Y. Friars Club Roast Of Rob Reiner

If anyone has these please let me know.
Also the Hugh Hefner Roast it's poor quality, so if anyone has it better, please upload it.
Some of the episodes were replaced with higher quality ones, compared to the original pack. Episode 102 - Marc Maron was replaced as in the original pack it was a HBO Half Hour Special.

I know that you might have the older pack, but I would highly appreciate if you help me get this pack with as many seeders as possible(as is almost complete and has higher quality)

This will be seeded every day from 6PM to 1 AM(+2 GMT) untill at least 5 users get it full.
Even if sometimes you won't see a seed, don't worry, I will complete it!

A special thanks to Mijmanxx for helping me get this pack complete(almost), and helping me replacing some episodes with a higher quality ones.

Thanks Again Man!
