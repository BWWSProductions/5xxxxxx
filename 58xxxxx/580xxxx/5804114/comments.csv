Important Notes:

I have patched the game from wave 6 to wave 3. So it can be played on IX 1.6 and with out the actv.iso. *VERY IMPORTANT DO NOT!!!!* play this game on your none banned console. This version/pathing will get your console banned 100%!!. Its for banned consoles. You need also latest dashboard.				"
