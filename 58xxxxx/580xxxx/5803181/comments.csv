,xCrosseyesx,2010-09-01T17:40Z,Halo: Reach is larger than 5.92 GiB. Someone please confirm.
,Orangemohawk,2010-09-01T19:12Z,"@xCrosseyesx

its compressed into like 60 files so the dl goes faster. to extract it just click extract on the file that has theextension as .r01"
,xCrosseyesx,2010-09-01T20:54Z,"I know it's compressed, but it's been taken down by 2+GiB, which games usually don't compress that much.
Oh, and I know new people are gonna be wondering how to burn/play this so here is a tut on flashing the DVD drive and burning the game: http://dwl.xbox-scene.com/tutorial/HitachiSamsungTutorialV40Merged.doc"
,mondo136,2010-09-02T02:26Z,everybody this is fake shit do not download
,xCrosseyesx,2010-09-02T03:38Z,@mondo136: Please back up your claim before you post.
,kainy,2010-09-02T09:20Z,"First it's not a fake, dumb ass. Second it's just compressed at a higher rate, presumably ( It's a p2p release so it's not very clear which scene rules the obey :) ). 3rd the .dvd file has the .iso name wrong... The .iso is named ungodly-hr.iso, but the .dvd file says ungodly-hr2.iso. So to burn it, just rename one of the two, so they are the same.

PS. A Xbox game is never full 7.8gb, as shown after unrarring.... If you use other compression rate, other that ""Storage"" ( WinRar ) the resulted size will shrink, as it nears the real size of the game."
,sresky2,2010-09-02T11:13Z,This better work I only get 30gig a month
,doc3,2010-09-03T00:10Z,"So how is everyone patching this, XBGX is saying patch failed etc???????"
,Orangemohawk,2010-09-03T04:10Z,"It works perfect for me, and doc3, the patch failed because it isn't released yet :P"
,doc3,2010-09-03T04:38Z,@Orangemohawk okay thanks for that info. so its okay to burn and play with out the stealth check patch?
,Orangemohawk,2010-09-03T20:01Z,"Ahh Reflection isnt loading for me :(
