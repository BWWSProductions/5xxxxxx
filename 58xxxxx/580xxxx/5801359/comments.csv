,wira020,2010-09-03T01:32Z,why dont you try a software called mkvmerge... it's very simple to use... it will resync your mkv file permanently.. you can use it to resync as many time as you like... it is actually like a packager for you to put subtitle or audio into an mkv file.. it can also remove file from mkv... usually take less than 30 second to do it...
