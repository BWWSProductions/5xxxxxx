Plot:

Using flashbacks from a statement recorded late in life and archival footage for atmosphere, this film traces Harvey Milkâ€™s career from his 40th birthday to his death. He leaves the closet and New York, opens a camera shop that becomes the salon for San Franciscoâ€™s growing gay community, and organizes gaysâ€™ purchasing power to build political alliances. He runs for office with lover Scott Smith as his campaign manager. Victory finally comes on the same day Dan White wins in the cityâ€™s conservative district. The rest of the film sketches Milkâ€™s relationship with White and the 1978 fight against a statewide initiative to bar gays and their supporters from public school jobs.
