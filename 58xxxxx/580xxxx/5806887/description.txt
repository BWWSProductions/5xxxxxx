Waylon Jennings was one of the major practitioners and popularizers of country music's "Outlaw" period, and he remains a legend for it. This remastered video features the performer's 1978 concert at the Grand Ole Opry (shown for the first time ever in its entirety.) Jennings proves to be a rebellious, rugged individualist -- and therefore the perfect outlaw -- during this remarkably set, in which he performs tracks including a stellar "Good Hearted Woman," "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys," and more.
