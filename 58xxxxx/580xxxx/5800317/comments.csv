,wira020,2010-08-31T21:14Z,"@manish
if you want 2gb++ movies u should just stick with other uploader out there, there's plenty of other people who uploads 720p at humongous size... most of the people here prefer riddlerA because of the small size... it makes it easy for people such as me with sh*tty internet.."

,Heides666,2011-03-01T18:00Z,"I dl'd this & sequel at the same time.  Both are way too dark.  When I check Image Adjust (for gamma) on VLC player this movie gets completely corrupted.  Heavy pixellation, freezing and skipping, freeze on seek, etc.

Plays ok w/o Image Adjust but is as dark as a bad screener.  Also, VLC error when playing sample (not the movie) - ""VLC can't recognize the input's format""

When Nature Calls (x264 MKV by Ridd) has no problems with VLC image adjust, nor does any other movie I've ever downloaded."
,Heides666,2011-03-01T18:03Z,"(...Cont from last post)
VLC and Vuze are updated. As far as I can tell it's either a corrupted DL (hash checks, Vuze says everything's fine and I've been seeding this for 2 days) or the encoding was botched.  Suggestions?"
,scum666,2011-03-27T15:12Z,Still funny after all these years. A true classic. Great quality. Cheers.
