NOTE: This is my first torrent and Blu-ray rip. Please comment and let me know what you think. I know the file is quite large, but it is in Full HD and has all of the audio and subtitle files merged into one .mkv video.

If you need help viewing this video, I suggest Zoom Player Standard. If anyone would like it, please comment and I will try and upload the program as Zoom Player Standard it is no longer available on the Zoom Player website.

SEEDING NOTE: I will only be able to seed during my off-peak internet period. This is between 2am-8am Australian Western Standard Time (UTC +8:00). For example, if you live in London, I will only be seeding between 6pm-12am


Thank you, and PLEASE SEED!
