,nittany,2010-08-31T13:20Z,"Which copy of Robin Hood is better? The FLAWL3SS release or this IMAGINE release?

Also, the uploader called ""extremezone"" uploaded this same movie but he is calling his one a DVD rip, I'm guessing he decided this R5 is good enough quality to just label it a DVD rip? "

,number7777,2010-08-31T14:03Z,"Both groups are using the same (and at the moment only) source.

Audio (full! english 5.1 AC3) & Video streams from a russian DVD9 (Retail or not).

Depending on the interpretation of the ""Scene Rules"" this qualifies as a DVDRip (like from a Retail DVD) or a R5 (DVD Region Code 5 (e.g. Russia))."
