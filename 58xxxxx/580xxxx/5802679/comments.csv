For awhile it was constant error, wrong code. So when I finally managed to index, I try to add tags by clicking edit torrent...surprise..surprise another f*cking error TPB gives me. Never have I encountered such difficulty indexing a torrent on any other tracker. btw, the time limit is dumb. At the least, give the uploader more time than 90sec.. 4 min. at least. Feels like a damn race. One mistake & you're screwed because time wasted correcting it. I barely have time to record the show so I don't have the patience to deal with something simple made ""unnecessarily"" complicated. Sorry DBaum "
[T],480v,2010-09-01T19:27Z,"Well, I do have a demonoid membership with regards to trackers that handle non-specific variety content. But, I don't really upload anything like music or movies let alone a political show like RR. It's typically just sports content usually to private sports trackers. But I guess the reason I don't have problems uploading there is because private trackers usually have better/easier uploading.

Is there anything specific you do for the edit option (the part where u add tags)? Do you have to wait, clear cache/cookies, re-login? Because every time I click it to add the needed tags (immediately after torrent gets uploaded), I get a blank page with a message that just reads, ""error"". Very frustrating. Why the heck TPB didn't just include the adding tags part into the making/uploading process and just extend the 90 sec. limit is beyond me. It's quite stupid."
[T],480v,2010-09-02T03:11Z,"Okay, what confused me was in the suprbay instructions, it says ""do not fill the tag fields yet"". I thought the only way to add tags was afterwards through edit torrent. thanks"
