There are more poll numbers  indicating that Republicans live in an alternative universe. These arenâ€™t so much surveys as they are psychological questionnaires. Why donâ€™t they just start giving Republicans those inkblot Rorschach tests? â€œWhat do you see here?â€ â€œI see Barack Obama sacrificing Christian babies to Satan.â€ In the latest poll, 52 percent of Republicans agree with the statement that President Obama â€œsympathizes with the goals of Islamic fundamentalists who want to impose Islamic law around the world.â€ Hmmâ€¦ maybe the results wouldnâ€™t be so extreme if they didnâ€™t phrase the questions like a Glenn-Beck-on-cough-medicine rant. On the other hand, I guess they canâ€™t just ask them â€œDo you believeâ€¦ basically anything some rightwing nutbag could dream up?â€ Still, I suspect they would say yes. If you ask Republicans â€œHow many fingers am I holding up?â€ the answer would be â€œObama is the devil.â€ It saves them from counting. This poll also shows that 59 percent of Republicans said they believed the president favored â€œthe interests of Muslims over other groups of Americans.â€ That one is a little surprising. I had no idea that many Republicans considered Muslims to be Americans.

How can they keep us this level of ignorance? Glenn Beck is certainly doing his part. Beck has launched a new â€œnews and opinionâ€ website. Of course, to Glenn Beck, thereâ€™s no distinction between news and opinion. His opinions are wrong, and Iâ€™m sure all the â€œnewsâ€ on his site is going to be wrong too. Beck said â€œItâ€™s so hard to find a place that helps me make sense of the world I see.â€ Weâ€™re all with you there, Glenn. I certainly canâ€™t make any sense out of the world YOU see. Gee Glenn, if you canâ€™t make sense of the world youâ€™re seeing, is it just possible that youâ€™re not seeing the real world? Beckâ€™s new site is called TheBlaze.com. Incidentally, The Blaze is already up and, well, blazing. Surprised? Itâ€™s not like they had to spend any time researching their stories. The banner headline when I logged on was â€œExplicit Poetry GPS Phones Help Illegals.â€ Really. Iâ€™m not going to click on the link for the article. Iâ€™m going to just let my imagination run wildâ€”which Iâ€™m sure is pretty much what the author of that piece did. Check it out for yourself. Iâ€™m too busy texting excerpts from Allen Ginsbergâ€™s â€œHowlâ€ to immigrants in the desert suffering from hypothermia and sunstroke.
