This is a video that was aired on the UK channel 4. It used to be available on the net, but has since been taken down, probably due to pressure from Islamic radicals who do not want the Qur'an exposed to critical analysis.

When released, this documentary received high reviews from scholars and others involved in Islamic studies.

This is low res 320x176 video, but the quality is quite good despite the low res.
