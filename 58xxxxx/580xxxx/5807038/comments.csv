1) The songs are just all thrown into one folder. 
2) Songs are not properly tagged and labeled. 
3) Missing a lot of songs. 
4) Some songs seem to fall under the category of 'I can't find it anywhere, so here is something I think would work'. 
^It doesn't. 

I came in here looking for the songs for 9 & 10, and it took me 30 minutes just to sort everything out. 
--------------------- 
My solution: give me a couple of days to fix my soundtracks and get them in order, and then I will upload them here. 

@ EliteMercenary, you can even d/l them, and then re up this with mine. I don't even want credit. I just don't want anyone else to get disappointed. "
