,captaind,2010-09-07T02:24Z,Why do people upload this and never seed?
,captaind,2010-09-09T22:19Z,I finally downloaded this... from a different torrent.
,831394,2010-09-14T02:07Z,SORRY STILL NEW TO THIS BUT FROM DAY ONE OF THE UPLOAD THE COMPUTER HAS BEEN SET TO SEED ALL FILES. IT MAY HAVE BEEN DOWN OR OFF THEN BACK WHEN WEATHER MOVES IN DUE TO THE CABLE BEING OUT BUT RESTARTS ONCE THE INTERNET COMES BACK ON. I CK THE TORRENTS ALMOST EVERY DAY AND SEE A 0 FOR SEEDERS BUT YET MULTIPLE PEOPLE ARE DLING FROM ME.

Would you care to tell where else you got this  torrent? I can't seem to find it.

And the rest of you people, please seed?"

Thanks !!!"
