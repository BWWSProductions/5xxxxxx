,RevueE,2010-08-31T05:40Z,"Idk whats up with TvTeam but they upload a torrent and its now 40 minutes later and still sitting at 0.000 availability. Entourage was the same way last night. After 18 hours they still needed to finally upload 140kb to finish the file. They were sharing 256kb pieces every couple of minutes. Now the same thing with Weeds tonight. We all appreciate the fast torrent release, but not when there's nothing to DL."
