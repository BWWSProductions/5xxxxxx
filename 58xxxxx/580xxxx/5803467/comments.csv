,Cisaroski,2010-09-01T23:25Z,i think he should really upload it again as an iso file. not all the files (67 of them) thats why it takes so long to download. becasue it has to process 67 files each megabyte which is obviously gonna take awhile.. could you re-upload for them bone?

,yrALLnubs,2010-09-02T01:20Z,"I registered to this site just for this one message. First of all if you're going to leech then use a different form of file transfer like newsgroups. It's faster, more secure, and has no association with this p2p crap. You can leech all you want. The same goes for all the people complaining about the leechers. This is what you get for using torrents. Deal with it. I downloaded this game in approximately 25 minutes about 10 hours ago when the file was released. Sucks for you guys. Torrents (thumbs down)"

,xCrosseyesx,2010-09-02T06:43Z,"@jinnos: It extracted and burned just fine for me.

Is this rip ssv2? or crappy kreon rip?

to the guy above me.

no you probably wont get banned but you will get flagged, even if you only play it offline as the xbox keeps a log of everything that happens so as soon as you sign in microsoft will know you played it early. i think its best to wait to play it till at least 1-2 days before the official release datte."
,Billy0827,2010-09-02T18:05Z,"first comment @ ryman15

@plzdontbanme

i suggest searching ixtreme on google. (yes you wil need ""mods"")"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-02T18:15Z,Any game here ( 99.9%) required Flashed FW. 1% is demos etc...and some games (DLC) required a jtagged xbox.
,fhive,2010-09-02T18:18Z,"1 -You WILL get banned if you play this right now: A) I imagine that it is NOT stealth patched, but B) even if it is, the game hasn't been released - all unreleased games played via live will get you banned.  

2 - This version of HF requires a DVD drive firmware mod voiding your xbox's warranty - an unmodded system will not play any copied or downloaded game.  

3 - As for validity, I am currently burning the disc, but I have downloaded from each of the new HF's and can say that they are all the same at this time (the ones released within an hour of this one).  Further, if you want to download this, there is another with label [SpaTorrent] which is exactly the same, you may get better speeds there - if you are lucky."

What i mean in general is that u have a old  firmware (flashed dvd) IX 1.6 = This FW cant read new games waves that is wave 6. So there is an option to use the ""activate iso/cd"" thats flag ur IX1.6 to skip read waves = wave x. :D...Or u need to flash ur dvd again with new iXtreme Lite Touch."

Im burning it now and ill let you know if its real.  But DO NOT PLAY ONLINE TILL GAME COMES OUT.  Im just playin the single player campaign.  Well good luck and when u finish the download you gotta change the dvd file to match the iso file.  Otherwise img burn will not recognize it.

,airmakis,2010-09-03T09:18Z,"@bone,could u be a little more specific about how to rename properly the iso and dvd file,thank you"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-03T09:25Z,"Some answers:

1. There is no other way to play pirategames then flash ur dvd.

2. abgx will fail until the game is Verified (abgx database). It takes some time.

3. I still stan by that there is no guarantee that u will not get banned just becuase you stealth patched the game. M$ banned like i sade before over 1mill consoles (last ban wave) and most did the stealth patching. But im not saying its waste of time but some gets the ide, its a 100% safe way not geting banned. But what ever...:D

4. Match then name.

 Open .dvd in notepad and see if it have the same names as the .iso file. DO NOT change the ""layerbreak"" txt.

5. Why some uploads are smaller.

Some pack the iso files with rar etc..and some just share the iso with out packing it. Thats the diffrent.

6. The game works fine played now for 1h with out any problems.

Hope it helps some ppl. :D"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-03T09:36Z,"and yes i play the game with out  abgx ""stealth patching"" becuase im one of  luky ""banned xbox owner"" :D last ban wave. So it dont matter any more.

when i extract the first file in winRAR it goes until 3% then says i need this (Halo.Reach.RF.XBOX360-Ungodly\x360-haloreach.r00)volume to continue extracting.

so i use the 2nd file in winrar and it will extract to 100% but finish saying the file is corrupt every single time

i just flashed first ever xbox today soley to play reach early and i get this far only to find out i cant extract the iso. fml

please help "

if i just re-download that haloreach.r21 file should it work?"
,ZacGawn,2010-09-09T02:56Z,@philblunt. Id say its a corruption in the downloading of the files (as i had no error in extraction). Unfortunalty you will have to re download. If you can identify which file is missing you can just select to download that in your torrent client.
,philblunts,2010-09-09T04:46Z,"i redownloaded the file that was corrupt but now winrar is saying i cannot replace the file. fml

,groundbreaker59,2010-09-11T01:13Z,"To the people having problems with rars:

If winrar, or whatever program your using is saying that one or more of the files are corrupt, then there should pop up an error window (usually in winrar) and show all the corrupted files. Delete these files from the folder permanently, and redownload them again, and do not use the magnet link, because the download torrent link gives you the option to choose wich files to download, like the files replacing the corrupted rars, instead of re-downloading the whole game again!

If this does not work, try opening different rars in the folder. Look for some rar files that look a bit diffrent from the other ones, because i had once the corrupted rars message, but then i oppened a rar file which didnt have any number on it like the rest had, and it worked! Can depend actually.

hope thsi helps... cheers!  and good seeding!"

1. This is a bad rip (the most likely cause). If you're checking a DVD backup

corruption.

2. Your CPU/RAM/HDD/data bus is unstable and corrupted the data during
extraction/burning or while checking the CRC. Make sure to run the sfv and try
extracting it again (assuming you have the sfv/rars) and recheck the ISO/DVD to
see if you get the same CRC.

3. Game data was intentionally modified for some reason. Microsoft does not

[V],.BONE.,2010-09-22T03:11Z,"NEWS Y ITS NOT LOADING THE CAMPAIGN THIS IS WITH RETAIL COPYS :)
 Halo Reach, the latest instalment in Bungie's celebrated sci-fi shooter series, has set new records for the developer and the UK games industry.

However, shortly after the release, Microsoft has confirmed that disk read errors are spoiling a small number of Xbox gamers' days.

Users have reported looping cinematics, lock-outs and error messages when playing the Halo Reach. The older 20GB Xbox 360 Pro units seem to be the most affected, although problems have been reported with the 120GB Elite version too.

""We are aware of a very small number of customers reporting that their copy of Halo: Reach is causing a 'disc read' error,"" said Microsoft in a statement.

The software giant has advised players to contact its customer support line for assistance.

Owners of the 4GB Xbox 360 Slim have been unable to play the co-operative version of Halo Reach.

The game has already become the UK's biggest entertainment launch of 2010, grossing Â£128 million on the first day of its release. "

what kind of disc do you write it onto to run it in an xbox360?"
,bitchmagnet,2010-09-25T12:44Z,"Game partition CRC does not match the verified ini! There are 4 possibilities:

1. This is a bad rip (the most likely cause). If you're checking a DVD backup
and have AnyDVD or a similar app installed, make absolutely sure the process is
killed! If this is a scene release, search for it on abgx.net and look at the
column ""Bad CRC or Needs Fixing"". If you see a  icon, hover over it with
your mouse to read the alt text. If it says something like ""Bad game data CRC""
or gives the name of a fix (PPF patch), we already know about it. It's also
highly recommended to run abgx360 again with AutoFix set to level 3 if you
applied a PPF to make sure stealth files haven't been corrupted. See ""What is
AnyDVD style corruption?"" in the GUI Quickstart tab for more info on game data
corruption.

2. Your CPU/RAM/HDD/data bus is unstable and corrupted the data during
extraction/burning or while checking the CRC. Make sure to run the sfv and try
extracting it again (assuming you have the sfv/rars) and recheck the ISO/DVD to
see if you get the same CRC.

3. Game data was intentionally modified for some reason. Microsoft does not
take kindly to modifications for any purpose, and even benign changes to game
data or settings will get you banned from Xbox Live!

4. The verified Game CRC in the database is wrong (very unlikely).

Stealth was verified but game data wasn't

I have tried four releases from TPB and I get this every time I check ""Halo: Reach"" with abgx360."

,Torx8,2010-10-08T08:09Z,"For everyone that doesn't know how to play copied xbox360 games:

1)
You NEEEEEED to have your Xbox360 DVD-ROM modified! Costs  about 30 euros.

2)
You NEEEEEED to burn the game using the .DVD file so that the burner software (i am using ImgBurn for this) knows where the layerbreak is.
IF there is no .DVD file provided you have to enter the layerbreak numbers manually in the burner software (if your burner software doesn't allow this, then i suggest you get ImgBurn).

3) You NEEEEED to burn the games onto a DVD+R DL (Double Layer, 8.5GB) disc.

4) You NEEEEED to know which iXtreme version you have used to modify your DVD-ROM so that you can (if necesary) patch the game .ISO file to use the correct Wave version.
If you know your iXtreme version, just google it and you should find which Wave it supports.

To flash the game, use a neat little tool called ""360 Waves Patcher v1.2.6"".

Good luck!"

But since it worked fine for some people, I was thinking, is it the firmwire? Should I upgrade to ixtreme LT? I searched the net and found out, the main difference between ixtreme 1.61 and ixtreme LT is, that u r more safe in case of LT if u play online.

,brawlysnake66,2012-01-01T01:01Z,"Just so you know now you will need to add topology data to this game since it's still ap2.5 game.and if this is a bad rip witch I remember downloading this before you will need the dvd fix file,but dont run it through abgx cause now it wont make a difference anymore since there's already topology data for this.search up ""Master topoloy"" on tpb."
