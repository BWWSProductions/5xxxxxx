,Exhaust,2010-11-11T10:00Z,"Excellent quality, ofcourse. Since its disc images.

And you dont convert it (unless you really want less quality and discspace usage without burning on a dvd.)
Just mount the image with something like Daemon Tools Lite (wich is for free and easy to use,) and/or burn the images with Nero or something similar."
