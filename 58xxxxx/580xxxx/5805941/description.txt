ITV Stephen Tompkinson's Australian Balloon Adventure 1of3 HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2010

Actor Stephen Tompkinson takes on a new challenge Down Under as he bids to win 
Australia's biggest ballooning competition. The journey begins in dramatic fashion when his maiden flight over South Australia's Flinders Ranges ends in a crash landing at 40 mph. But he presses on to the Barossa Valley, where a serene flight over the vineyards is followed by a far from calm cricket match against local winemakers - the outcome of which sends Stephen packing for Victoria and a spell on the mighty Murray River.
