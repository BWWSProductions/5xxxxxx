,DSIN,2010-09-02T22:46Z,"@apple016 ace ventura 2 was dvdrip mate ...only 272p whereas dark knight was BRRip 536p.... 
abt picture quality.. well u can't expect a dvdrip 272p to be as clear as BRRip 536p do u?
IMO his rips are awesome... keep it up XD

@riddlerA : thx for another mindblowing movie bro.. :D

We love his rip for his economical size... you have to consider resolution and video length when determining what size the video is...  and as far as i can tell, his reencodes have very good compromise in all category in order to keep size at the minimum... for example, if i were to reencode a dvd ( dvd is usually 352p or something right? ) into a 10GB h264 aac video file.. it wouldnt be much better than a 400mb video of the same format.. try mkvguy's rip for example...

And the reason small video size becoming popular right now is that more ISP are capping the bandwidth usage of their customer.. 

@riddlerA
thanks for putting 12 monkeys in  the list... "

@wira020
 guys im totally agree wid ur points.
i cant expect output quality from 272p as i can from 720p.and yes riddlera is a one of the 
best encoder i've ever seen.
that's why i like him and support him too.


but guys did u watched  his paper man, i hate luv storys,the king of comedy.these are also dvdrip but lilbit big in size.
these picture has better quality as i seen.

that's why i wrote that 550 or 550+ size of movies would be better becoz they possess better picture quality.
and everyone can effort 550 mb  ryt? 
correct me if im wrong.
again Im repeating that my last comment was just a request not a complaint  ."

First of all ace ventura 2 was not done by me .... It was done by 300 mb united. I did the Ace ventura 1

Secondly, all the talks about what is an ideal size is meaningless as every movie is different & have to be treated differently 
Some can have a very good quality at 400 mb & some may require even a 1 gb size

The first & most important lesson in re encoding is to find a good source. A good source is half the work done. 

In case of ace ventura 2 the source dvd must have been so as it is an old movie. I am sure that even if u download the original source of 700 mb U will get a similar type of quality

What I am trying to say is it doesn't matter how much size u increase or how much u tweak the settings while ripping, If the source quality is bad Rip can't be good either

I hope it marks an end to this size vs Quality debate

@ punisher

Thanxs man ......... greatly appreciated :)

@ jobinpkd

I & many other encoders use megui
It is the most popular, though not the most user friendly software

@ Prank007

I will see in the future
No need for the source I will find a good source when I do it

@ Nkmystyeries

Yeah I know I said I would do twin peaks this month but I have decided to focus more on  movies this month as I am in movie ripping mood right now

Twin peaks is ready 
I will post it next month & as a compensation to all TV show fans next month I will do onlt TV shows & an occasional new movie

So be ready for 

Supernatural
Twin peaks
The Wire
Weeds
Monk
Coupling plus a few more for next month"

,wira020,2010-09-05T22:24Z,"Hehe, it was just a friendly debate.. no hard feelings eh mate.. well, 1 thing for sure is, RiddlerA been doing a good job so far... let's give em all our support eh.. thanks man... btw, do u have any rule of thumb for the size of ur reencode... for example, I use 150mb per 30 minute of dvdrip... 

When I have a better ISP after college, I'd love to help reencode some from your list and upload it here.. "
