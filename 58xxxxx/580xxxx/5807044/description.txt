from as band that used to be very good ... what the hell os going on with Andreas Kisser ?? ... with all respect: now Groove Metal ?? But this is just my opinion, I respect of course people that donÂ´t agree with me.

the version uploaded here is Part I (RR 2314-3), that comes in a slimcase and includes the first four tracks of the tracklist below.

he first Sepultura show was on December 4th, 1984. The band played two songs that never were re-recorded or released.

Line-up of the first show:
Wagner "Antichrist" - Vocals
Max "Possessed" - Guitars
Igor "Skullcrusher" - Drums

The band has changed a lot since their early days. They started out as Death Metal (Bestial Devastation, Morbid Visions), moved to Thrash Metal (Schizophrenia, Beneath The Remains, Arise), then Groove/Thrash Metal (Chaos AD) to Alternative/Nu Metal (Roots) and to Groove/Hardcore from there.

A VHS tape called "Live Reviews" was released by Roadrunner in 1992/93.

Max Cavalera left the band in December 1996, when the band clashed with his wife and band manager Gloria. He went on to form the Alternative/Nu Metal band Soulfly. Derrick Green, originally from Cleveland, Ohio replaced Max.

The band name comes from a Portuguese translation of MotÃ¶rhead's song "Dancing On Your Grave" which is "DanÃ§ando Na Sua Sepultura". Sepultura means "grave" in Portuguese (and in other Latin-based languages).

Roy Mayorga (Stone Sour, Soulfly, Amebix) filled-in for Igor during the European tour with In Flames in 2006.
