,Phatfish,2010-09-11T06:20Z,"Yes, this is an American remake and with most American remakes it's a fucking disgrace to the original.

The original movie made some very interesting valid points about penal systems that this piece of shit remake so nicely have smoothed over so it doesn't get too uncomfortable.

But Thanks For The Upload Anyway, Great Quality Rip!"
