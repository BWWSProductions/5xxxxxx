Hailed by the Associated Press as a: revelatory revue full of wonderful moments, and by USA Today as a: funny, affectionate and revealing tribute to musical theater's greatest living composer and lyricist, SONDHEIM ON SONDHEIM is an intimate portrait of the famed songwriter in his own words...and music. An all-star cast headed by Barbara Cook, Vanessa Williams and Tom Wopat takes on new arrangements of over two-dozen Sondheim tunes, ranging from the beloved to the obscure, interspersed with audio commentary by the composer himself, who reveals fascinating details about his life and his art. Stephen Sondheim's final word on his unparalleled body of work has been preserved by PS Classics in this lavish release.
