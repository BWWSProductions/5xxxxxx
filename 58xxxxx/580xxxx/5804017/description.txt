FLAWL3SS NOTES
I know their are plenty of R5s and the screeners. But i have to admit the R5 looks better then the screener. So we opted to do the R5 and used IMAGINES audio thanks guys. We did our normal stuff to it. We brighten the movie along with saturation, contrast, denoiser and finally a sharpen filter to it. And for added entertainment we made audio 6 channels and hard coded the subs. Many thanks to EleKtriKa and IMAGINE. Hope you all enjoy from team FLAWL3SS
