      SANS SEC 508 - System Forensics, Response & Investigation (Course DVD)


Data breaches and advanced intrusions are occurring daily. Sensitive data and intellectual property is stolen from systems that are protected by sophisticated network and host based security. A motivated criminal group or nation state can and will always find a way inside enterprise networks. In the commercial and government sectors, hundreds of victims responded to serious intrusions costing millions of dollars and loss of untold terabytes of data. Cyber attacks originating from China dubbed the Advanced Persistent Threat have proved difficult to suppress. Forensics 508 will help you respond to and investigate these incidents.

Forensics 508: COMPUTER FORENSIC INVESTIGATIONS AND INCIDENT RESPONSE will give you a firm understanding of advanced incident response and computer forensics tools and techniques to investigate data breach intrusions, tech-savvy rogue employees, advanced persistent threats, and complex digital forensic cases.

Utilizing advances in spear phishing, web application attacks, and persistent malware these new sophisticated attackers advance rapidly through your network. Incident Responders and Digital Forensic investigators must master a variety of operating systems, investigation techniques, incident response tactics, and even legal issues in order to solve challenging intrusion cases. Forensics 508: COMPUTER FORENSIC INVESTIGATIONS AND INCIDENT RESPONSE will teach you critical forensic analysis techniques and tools in a hands-on setting for both Windows- and Linux-based investigations.

Attackers will use anti-forensic techniques to hide their tracks. They use rootkits, file wiping, timestamp adjustments, privacy cleaners, and complex malware to hide in plain sight avoiding detection by standard host-based security measures. Everything leaves will leave a trace; you merely need to know where to look.

Learning more than just how to use a forensic tool, by taking this course you will be able to demonstrate how the tool functions at a low level. You will become skilled with new tools, such as the Sleuthkit, Foremost, and the HELIX3 Pro Forensics Live CD. SANS hands-on technical course arms you with a deep understanding of the forensic methodology, tools, and techniques to solve advanced computer forensics cases.
