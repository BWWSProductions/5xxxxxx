,imsliquor23,2010-09-02T08:45Z,"hey listen... i'm new to the whole bit torrent thing... how do i get downloaded PSP torrents onto a PSP?? if you can help me, thanks... but thanks anyway if you don't."
,Rouca,2010-09-02T16:47Z,"Hey, we all start somewhere. You connect your psp with a standard usb cord to your computer, and press USB Connection. If you're doing this for the first time, it'll take a moment for your computer to recognize the psp. Then go to Computer from the start menu, and open your psp. Copy the 550.pbp to the ""root"" (the first thing you see when you open your psp.) Now copy the PSP folder (from the torrent) to the PSP on your PSP. Disconnect and launch this from the ISO folder on your psp. You'll see Gen-D3 updater, or something. Click on that, and it's pretty self explanatory from there.

After that, copy the Prometheus folder into PSP>GAME, after deleting the GEN-D3 files. Repeat."

,Rouca,2010-09-02T16:52Z,"Oops. Sorry for the double post. If you're talking about how to put the games on your PSP, that depends. If it's an .iso or .cso, you put them directly in the ISO folder of your psp. If it's a lot of data like shiningsword.r01 and shingsword.ro2, you need to install winrar, right click on one of the files, and press extract. This should make a iso or cso."
,iammorbius,2010-09-23T01:30Z,Could you post complete instructions on how to use this on an unhacked PSP-2000 (Fat)? Or is something else required to be done before using this? 
,Rouca,2010-09-23T21:24Z,"Well I've never done it with an unmodded psp, but I hear you have to buy a Pandora battery-- which is about $10. You should ask around though."

,Rouca,2010-10-23T20:33Z,"I included the 5.50 gen d3 files. Put the 550.pbp on the PSP first, update, then put Prometheus on."
