When you are at 1.5 ratio drop the download and move on its not that hard people. Thanks for the 3 american flags I see streaming above 50kb/s the rest of you suck at sharing things go back to grade school :D Also thanks to GreatMagician for the upload I'm sure I will love it when I watch it....in another 3 weeks."
,Thermo18,2010-09-04T02:14Z,"This download is a waste of time unless you must have 720p, download the circlensess dvdrip until these people figure out how to seed something. Going on 6+hours with this download and still only 75% done. Hitting 1.4 mb/s with the circlensess version."
