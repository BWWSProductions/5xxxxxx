Already a successful television series in Taiwan, this Japanese language drama is also based on the manga by Nakajo Hisaya. Horikita Maki plays Ashiya Mizuki, a Japanese girl who has been living in the U.S. until she sees a young man named Sano Izumi (Oguri Shun) compete in the high jump on television. She begins to idolize him, and decides to move to Japan so she can attend the same school. The catch? Izumi goes to an all-boys school, so Mizuki can't be a student there. Unwilling to let such a trifling thing as being the wrong gender stop her, Mizuki disguises herself as a boy and enrolls at the school anyway.
