Abduction, Alienation and Reason
by Angela Hind, BBC Radio 4
30 minutes, flac from producer\'s master

Synopsis - The late John E Mack was a highly respected Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard University and a Pulitzer Prize winner for his work on TE Lawrence. In 1983 he founded the Center for Psychology and Social Change (now the John Mack Institute) and was at the forefront of original research at Harvard University\'s Cambridge Hospital. 

In the early 1990s, he turned the academic community worldwide upside down because he wanted to publish his research in which he said that people who claimed they had been abducted by space aliens may not all be crazy after all. 

Abduction, Alienation And Reason is the story of one man\'s battle with his academic colleagues to keep an open mind and his struggle to understand those who claim to have been abducted. His plea was as much for them as for the future of psychiatry.
