,Sonywalk,2010-09-16T18:59Z,Working ? Anyone tested ?:P
,duraeas,2010-09-19T19:57Z,"Great upload... saved me after previous version expired. 

Any idea why this version is so big? This version has support for many more languages, is it using a proprietary library? I'm wondering if they can be removed from the APK prior to installing, 17mb is a lot of internal storage. Worth it though...

Thanks again for solid uploads.
