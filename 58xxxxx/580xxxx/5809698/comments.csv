,thomasg10,2010-11-05T08:32Z,"This little program started an ""attrib"" -command process and went on to hide every darn file om my computer. Not funny."
,tec78636,2010-12-03T18:44Z,"If you are using Vista/Win7, right click and ""Run as Administrator."""
,Xarop3,2011-02-03T23:55Z,"pkaji123, how can you be so sure??"
,renton10,2011-03-04T10:56Z,"dont listen to false positive shit why you think so many applications like this hide viruses, cos there easier to hide and when found you just say false positive or it's anti-piracy all I'm saying is stop and think before downloading people post warnings for a reason. look about first "
,renton10,2011-03-04T11:00Z,"i'm not saying this has a virus in it i'm just saying for people to be careful when not listening to comments especially on app's like activators, dont mean to offend I know people dont get these pink skulls for nothing"
,kamandcompany,2011-05-05T07:29Z,"Ok, I'm tired of all the think I'm right. This is going to show on any big name antivirus as a virus. Why? Because this is a virus, but it's a good one. it's like the human body we have good bacteria and bad bacteria. What this does is attack the hidden files that we aren't supposed to see that hold all the information on the activation. That's why it is going to show up on your antivirus. I have used over 20 cracks and not one of them showed up clean they all claimed to have viruses. The PB is very good at keeping their good torrents and their bad torrents separated. And your very right renton10 people don't get pink skulls unless they post lots of torrents that are legit and fresh I trust a pink or green skull over your zero skull, no offense."
,fishoto,2011-05-05T20:38Z,"thanks, it works 100%."
,pravesh_18,2011-05-11T18:43Z,"indeed it is a Trojan dude, not only the Antivirus software says so but it also create windows registry files producing error message at start up.
Can you post a better software again? "
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-06-14T23:46Z,This torrent works perfectly with Volume Licensed editions of Microsoft Office 2010. The contents are NOT malicious
,kenny782,2011-07-20T11:12Z,"I've always used KMS, I don't know what the deal is with this version... it didn't work anyway and most of the files on a network drive hidden....."
,InterMike,2011-10-19T03:44Z,"Not working for me. I'm not even sure it's doing anything - whatever I do, it still says 30 days."
,ironchest,2012-02-03T23:07Z,"Dear people,

Forget about Office 2010, its not worth the risk.
Im using a win7 64bit. So this was the only software for me in 64bit. I ran a fresh win7 install and my pc was lightning  fast. I ran the activator.. and first i was so happy. Because office rules the opensource projects by far. But than my pc started super slow. My pc responded slower. I thought maybe if i clean the registry.. it will be fine. But the next day.. all my websites on my own host.. where infected with a malware injection. 

NOW WHERE DID THIS LITTLE SPIDER CAME FROM???! 

Its full of smart undetectable spyware... and i learned my lesson.. i never do activators anymore.. only simple cracks. I will go back to libre office or openoffice. Im really angry because seeders keep telling there is nog malware in it! I uninstalled all the software.. but how do i get my fast pc back??? how do i know im not infected anymore?? I already had avast and anti malwarebytes running.. Fuck im so pissed!.. I have to clean all my websites from the infections and explain to my customers...

People be warned!!!!! i was too stupid to ignore the warnings..."
,ironchest,2012-02-04T02:30Z,"I did a system recovery, before the install! :P
My system is fast like before! 

please peeps take this serieus! i love pirated software but this is crap! Beware for those crackers with bad intensions!! Everybody tries to profit out of hours of work. This is their way!

I dont know if it was exactly this torrent download. But it was exactly this program (from the screenshot)"
,crossebby,2012-02-12T05:01Z,"Ok, I got NIS 2012 and its already quarenteed the file by saying Trojan. But I excluded it and restored it, but while I click it to run NIS again says Blocked a security Thread.

So Run it at Ur own risk. I don't know how much safe it is. I don't wanna risk, there is lot of cracks I ran with out problems from my NIS. So I am out with this crack.

Thanks anyway."
,hyperhouse91,2012-07-04T16:14Z,"Works like a charm--have been using this activator  for some time. My advice to those who think it's a virus....dont download...however, don't call it what it isn't either. Get a clue of how some of these cracks,activators work. Great upload. thanks."
