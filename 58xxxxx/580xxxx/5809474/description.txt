PrisM NOTES:
Here we go. Warm welcome to DiGiTAL iNK. This is a first joint release of many to come. iNK will be bringing new 5.1 high quality line audio to many upcoming cams. This weekend will offically mark a steady release of new source 5.1 lines, not remastered but in real Dolby 5.1. This 5.1 audio we used on v2 was tested on a 5.1 2000watt home theater and is superb quality. As always, enjoy this awesome movie //prism
