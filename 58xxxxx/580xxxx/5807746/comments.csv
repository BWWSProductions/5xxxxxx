,Shanro,2010-09-03T16:23Z,"Sorry about that 4 hour delay, had a power outage..."
,Shanro,2010-09-03T18:21Z,"How to install:
1. Run installer.
2. When it asks to install the sound engines click yes and allow installation.
3. After installation is complete, it will ask you to click finish. Untick the box saying ""Launch Guitar Pro 6"" and then click finish.
4. Follow instructions in Readme... Basically copy and paste the patch into guitar pro folder, run it, let it put the icon on the desktop (as this replaces the original thus bypassing registration).
5. Your done.

Note: When opening a tab, launch Guitar Pro first (using desktop icon) as double clicking a tab will attempt to launch using the original icon (thus will ask for registration info).

Full version: Works (I've only tested on) Windows 7 32bit, however, original torrent said it will also work for 64bit computers."
,John_Hill,2010-09-04T11:01Z,"I'll give it a try..
But the other torrents that i've downloaded they didn't work on windows 7 (32b)
Let's hope that this torrent will..."
,albin_maiden,2010-09-05T14:32Z,Still invalid license.
,John_Hill,2010-09-05T16:05Z,"It doesen't even instal the soundbank....
And the loader doesen't working....
WTF????"
,Shanro,2010-09-06T04:56Z,"It worked fine for me... Just follow instructions, I said above how to avoid registration request... Be sure to run as administrator (suggestion)"
,John_Hill,2010-09-06T10:04Z,"Still the same...I don't know what is happening....
I run it like admin but nothing happened....
The first error is when it's trying to instal the soundbanks....
Maybe i need format!!!! :)"
,Shanro,2010-09-06T11:37Z,Be sure you have the install files in the same folder... On my comp it asked (mid way through installation) Do you want to install soundbanks... I clicked yes and it installed them straight away...
,John_Hill,2010-09-06T22:17Z,"Thanks for the intresting....
But i do have the soundbanks with the installation setup....(as it is...)
Nothing....."
,Evil_Invader,2010-09-06T23:28Z,"""Compilation of two torrents... I have tested on Windows 7 32bit and this works as easy as 1, 2, 3, Guitar Pro is FREE:)""

LOL camon...you are so naughty but you got all attention didn't you?now delete this torrent because it's useless!"
,royalcola,2010-09-21T18:04Z,"The loader doesn't work. It pops up an activation screen that's pre-filled, but still says it's an invalid key."
,calebotto84,2010-09-23T20:26Z,i followed all the instrunctions and it put a user id and key ID but when i hit ok it says its the wrong id please help!
,Thnikk645,2010-09-26T20:30Z,"Worked fine for me. To avoid the registration issue, just delete the .dat file every time you want to use it. As for the soundbank installation issue, I didn't run into. Everything installed without a problem."

,Halahazam,2010-10-06T15:44Z,"I copied all files into a folder I named ''GuitarPro 6'' (Yes, I know that there is one already, but I didn't know it earlier) and now I think all of the files are in there (Also from the original folder). Now when I click the Guitarprorunner, it asks me these LAN setting things, I choose my internet, then it goes to the screen where is the license ID thing but it is already filled, I just hook the box to approve the terms of use or whatever, but then it says invalid license? help please!"
,ynos9169,2010-10-06T22:49Z,"HOW TO ACTIVATE:

1. do as instructions say
2. When asked to select LAN select your LAN [ NOT WIRELESS]

If you select a wireless WLAN it will show a screen with license ID ect. that are filled, try to activate it and it will say invalid. Select a LAN (your Ethernet port) and it will not show you the screen to activate it will open the program.   

By the way great torrent and it does work, thanks!!"
,pranzo12,2010-10-07T00:09Z,Not sure which LAN to choose.

,sanewicked,2010-10-07T21:04Z,"I did what ynos9169 said and I have had no problems so far. 

NOTE: If you download tabs from a website, say ""ultimate-guitar.com"", do not launch the tabs themselves. Open up Guitar Pro 6 and then load the tab. When I loaded the tab by itself, Guitar Pro 6 asked for activation, when Guitar Pro 6 was already open, it did not.

Good Luck!"
,severed1314,2010-10-08T07:05Z,"For some reason the harmonics on the bass g string dont come out at all, no sound. Any help? I tried re-installing with no success. BTW installation went smoothly."
,beawolf220,2010-10-08T23:00Z,"Works in Windows 7 64-bit, but a bit tricky. After running GP6Runner.exe and selecting LAN, it still opens the Activation dialog. If I select Offline Activation and then cancel it, Guitar Pro 6 opens."
,severed1314,2010-10-09T20:23Z,@beawolf That happened to me too. Just go into the gp6 folder delete the .dat file then run it again. It should work.

I only need the SoundBank and it work just great, thank you"
,ld_pvl,2010-10-21T01:40Z,"I had the licensing problem as well. Solved it like this:
- First delete .dat file and re-run GPR6Runner.exe
- Disconnect from the Internet, and run GPR6, proceed with licensing, it might say that it can't connect to the host but it will load.

So basically every time you gotta disconnect from the Internet to start GPR6."

,wierd-old-guy,2010-11-24T23:38Z,"Look - people: if you're going to test drive programs, the companies do NOT want people pirating them. They WILL stop you.
SO.... you MUST turn OFF, disconnect - eliminate the internet BEFORE installing, kill the .dat file - follow the instructions. The internet needs to be GONE before you start installing. This also happens on several other programs and people continue to blame the writer of the keygen or the share-guy, or the programs.....
ELSE, you are going to get  a spanking from the company. They have every right to do so IF you are pirating their shit."

,feruzatan,2010-12-02T03:34Z,"GUYS, GUYS, GUYS!...

I'VE BEEN USING GP6 WITHOUT ANY HICCUP FROM DAY 1 SINCE IT IS AVAILABLE IN TPB. HAVE BEEN SELLING IT TOO (LOL) TO THOSE WHO COULDN'T FIGURE OUT TO SOLVE THE REGISTRATION CODE PROBLEM

MOST OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE TORRENTS' INSTRUCTIONS ARE 90% COMPLETE AND WILL END UP WITH THE REGISTRATION CODE PROBLEM.

HERE'S THE TRICK. THE NO. 1 INSTRUCTION - BEFORE INSTALLING GP6
1) GO TO NETWORK AND SHARING CENTRE IN CONTROL PANEL - CLICK
2) CHANGE ADAPTER SETTINGS - CLICK
3) RIGHT CLICK AT 'LOCAL AREA CONNECTION' AND CLICK ON 'PROPERTIES'
4) THEN CLICK 'CONFIGURE'
5) THEN CLICK AT THE 'ADVANCED' TAB
6) THEN CLICK AT 'NETWORK ADDRESS'
7) THEN ADD THIS ' 0024211EAA99 ' AT THE VALUE EMPTY SPACE. THEN PRESS OK

IT IS THEN YOU CARRY ON INSTALLING INSTRUCTIONS. MSG ME IF YOU GOT PROBLEM(I doubt you have). It's high time to make money from the college boys noobs and beginners(Shhh! don't share this secret with anyone) -

,kajsilud,2010-12-05T20:50Z,"installed it, had no problems but this version is extreeeemly buggy. Can i update it somehow? Has anybody tried autoupdate? "
,wierd-old-guy,2010-12-05T23:48Z,"PLEASE - DO NOT CONSIDER ""AUTO UPDATE"" ; that requires and internet connection.
Let me begin slower. 
The writer's many even have a ""kill"" at their home page and have a ""sweep"" to see if this particular lic. # is being used.
SO....... you want to get this up before you even consider getting back on line.
IF - you get on line prior to it's total functioning you will get hammered. The lic # is no ""hot listed"". That means that you must firewall this program totally AFTER you have it up and running (& don't ever consider an update - where does the ""update"" come from?
Realistically: most of the ""problem"" programs evolve becasue people make very public their ""test-driving"" them and the companies feels that's piracy and they will make EVEY attempt to STOP the functionality of that serial number, etc.
This happens VERY frequently with quality programs that (unfortunately) uninformed individuals install publicly (while connected to the internet)."
