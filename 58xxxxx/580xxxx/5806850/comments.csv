I tried to go to the network site but, despite their promises of ""watch the complete episode"", the had nothing but worthless clips.

A visit to Hulu was even more of a failure,

And that, even when they possess numerous distribution channels, is the reason that I keep coming back here.

Dear Network Executives,
Get a fuckin' clue.

Thanks."

thanks for this.

i never found the appeal of streaming video myself, i know plenty of people prefer it, but i'm a torrent man all the way."
