Brian Wilson has re-recorded and re-imagined twelve classic songs from the Gershwin Brothers and collaborated on two new Wilson/Gershwin compositions. The Gershwin estate gave Wilson access to rare, unfinished pieces of music by George Gershwin, with which Brian crafted collaborative compositions unlike anything the world has heard with â€œThe Like in I Love Youâ€ and â€œNothing But Loveâ€. Wilson chose to record George and Ira Gershwin songs because he considers the late composers of classics like â€œSomeone to Watch Over Me,â€ â€œRhapsody in Blueâ€ and â€œSummertimeâ€ as a critical influence on him.
Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin was produced by Brian Wilson and mixed by Al Schmitt the 15-time GRAMMY award winner (Michael BublÃ©, Ray Charles, Barbra Streisand, Madonna)
