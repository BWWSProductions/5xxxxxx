This is a collection of 25 optical illusions. Simply print a PDF file, cut it out, stick it together, and stand it on a table or window ledge. When you move around, the head seems to follow you around the room. The effect is really uncanny.

Example video of the dragon illusion:

How does it work? If we move around when viewing a solid object, our brain knows how the object we are looking at should behave. However the dragon gives us the wrong clues, because we mis-interpret what its shape is. We assume that the nose of the dragon is pointing out towards us, but in fact the dragons head is concave.
