[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-09-03T13:44Z,"I see, well just bookmark this then, when your serial fails to work , to know where to come back easily ;)))
 On the other hand this is the official with heavy compression and 2 files cracked, the ones that you wouldn't like as long as you are here ;)))))"

[V],thethingy,2010-09-04T00:58Z,"@do_not_delete_me_blindly, really? my mother wouldn't touch an inbred idiot like you,, Romania finally got dial-up now we get all the gypsies posting here, man what has Europe come to???"
,tommo39,2010-09-04T01:56Z,"i thought ""GREENS"" were the cream of T.P.B. it appears i made a mistake. after reading above comments, some are pure shit!"
,tommo39,2010-09-04T02:48Z,"THANKS uploader, installed and working fine"
,tommo39,2010-09-04T08:43Z,@nikhil_33 WELL SAID mate!!
,rockyak47,2010-09-08T23:21Z,"I'm getting this message while shutting down the PC after any backup:- "" Operations are in progress. Please wait. The machine will be turned off automatically after the operations are complete""
It really annoys me a lot.Someone please help me."
,MrSmartyPants,2010-09-20T20:40Z,"@thethingy, Stop yer hatin' man. Makes you out to look like a real putz. Thanks don't delete me blindly. Great upload."
,citizendonny,2010-09-26T18:59Z,Will this update? thank you.
,Tengiz_15,2010-09-30T17:03Z,make me try this
,sh0ne,2010-10-31T14:36Z,Doesn't work. It's not FULL activated. Installed it and it works in Windows BUT doesn't work in Media Rescue mode. When booted from CD and when I tried to Backup my HDD I get a error message that ATIH 2011 is TRIAL and I should buy a full version..
,Tatletz,2010-11-08T03:53Z,Thank you do_not_delete_me_blindly(takes a bit of time to type it). Your torrent works a treat.
,Maoxx,2010-11-17T01:12Z,"Guys, guys, calm down. You're both dorks."
,keshmyster,2010-11-19T14:22Z,Thanks very much man.this works a treat and has really helped me out.
,fairyboi88,2011-01-02T20:18Z,"i can't even get the installer to finish, it keeps saying the the installation was aborted before it could complete. I've tried installing it 3 times now, that's usually the give-up-point. they say 3rd times a charm but this just isn't working man."
,PKM9000,2011-01-18T21:34Z,"The digital signature is broken on ti_managers.dll and trueimagetools.exe I know this is because of the crack but why is it pre-cracked? why not just upload the crack?. I could then run it through sandibox and check out what's happening. It's suspicious. I just don't trust people enough to run pre-cracked and repacked executables. I'd strongly  advise people to not allow this program access to the net by using there firewall to block it. Always manually configure windows firewall when running cracked software off any torrent regardless of there status.

Shame really because all known Acronis true image serials expire quickly."

,marflo,2011-04-19T21:33Z,"Hey, for thethingy!

Why do you try to offend any culture here; if you don't like romanians because you dealt with gyipsy from Romania only, it is your problem not ours; but now will become UE problem with gypsy, finally they will get what trouble romanians  have in their country dealing with gypsy. "

If you try to setup the F11 boot, you get the same error. 

It's a Trial version."

,danman217,2011-05-11T22:29Z,"Worked perfectly for me... Installed without a problem... when it got to the point of entering the serial number, the number was already prefilled in for me, so i just had to continue... Thanks!"

[T],swebarb,2011-06-16T20:37Z,Awesome program. I just cloned 2 drives one 250gb ide and one 320gb sata it works perfect it  copied the first drive with a windows os to the new one and assigning the same letters so in my case i had C:/ (Windows) D:/ and E:/ so my new one got exactly as the old one and when the program asks to reboot it looks like u install windows program does all by itself and when finish u press a button and computer closes in with the new drive out with old and u boot up as if nothing happend it was more easy then installing windows..

,annuit02,2011-08-25T03:19Z,"This worked fine for me, I got it installed and working well. But I have the same question, is it okay for me to update the version or will I lose activation for the product?"
,djdale,2011-09-27T12:36Z,I've been using Acronis True Image Home 2010 for a long time and I've noticed that all newer versions that come out seem to have issues. Acronis 2010 even works on Windows 8 Dev Preview flawlessly. Why bother to get any other version ?
,eXoflow,2011-11-13T01:10Z,"buggy version, can't backup after first time :("
,PapyCholo,2011-11-16T14:12Z,"Installed fine, works good so far

,frontmobe,2011-12-31T02:45Z,sorry to be daft but how do i clone my primary disk? everytime i start to clone disk from my desktop it says i must retstart computer which i do and when i get back to the desktop i nothing happens. Do i have to make a CD?
,Darth_Adversor,2012-03-11T21:07Z,"I've used this twice: once to clone a drive, and the other to do a full back-up.  Works like a boss.  I can't comment on the recovery disc issue though.  Thanks uploader!"
,Suomisisu,2012-04-10T03:01Z,"Can you fucking losers at least be clear and say if this works or not instead of just posting absolute shit in the torrents section?

1. Does the torrent work?
2. Is it activated or is there a serial or keygen?
3. Were you able to make a backup disc to restore the image to HDD from?
4. Was everything sucessful?

Seriously you morons stop fucking around and actually help others out for christ sake. It's people like YOU guys that make good torrent sites total unreliable crap. If you downloaded this your obligation is to at least say if it bloody works or not...

@marflo Shut the fuck up you retard!"
