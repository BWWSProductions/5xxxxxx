PRISONER TRANSPORT (PART THREE) Featuring Calico   + Pics
August 20, 2010 

Calico has a unique talent. When she is getting tickled she can manage to squeal, scream and whimper all at once. Sister Dee and PD are going to work her like a tag team and see what other sounds they can get from their little instruments. They even put a cone around her head to help with the acoustics. When the concert is over they have to tend to their bitch. They take her outside then feed her some puppy treats, before caging her for the night. The only time they get her up in the night is to make her a receptacle for whichever bodily fluids PD wants to release at the time.
