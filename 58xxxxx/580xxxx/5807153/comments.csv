,evath,2012-01-31T05:21Z,"Hi,
I'm wondering if the soundtrack portion of this offering is the exact duplicate of the ""soundtrack only"" link you have posted.  That soundtrack was full of skips and I'm trying to get a better copy.  Is there some way you'd be willing to try again to get the soundtrack perfect, if this is the same one?  Maybe a 2nd download, for me, will do the trick. Thanks ever so much."
