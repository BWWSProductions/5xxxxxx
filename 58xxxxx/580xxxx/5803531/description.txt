This package contains the 64bit Debian / Ubuntu drivers for the Canon I_Sensys MF800o series of Multi-function printers.
The 64bit .deb files were compiled from the 64bit rpm files obtained from the Canon website.

I have installed and tested both the 64bit drivers using Ubuntu 10.04LTS.
The drivers should work on any resent Debian based operating system. See the Canon website for more details.

Instructions are included in the read me files.
