,JTAGpope,2010-09-05T18:30Z,Verified Working! Thanks
,co30op,2010-09-05T22:37Z,"Cisaroski - you can't just burn it.  

If you are using img burn, dvd decrypter, etc you have to manually set your layer breaks to 1913760 in your settings in ISO write mode.  Make sure in the same area to set your Write mode to DVD, Write type to SAO, Link size Auto and check Enable burn proof, lock volume and cycle tray.

After that burn it to a DL DVD at 2.4X

and you'll be good to go."
