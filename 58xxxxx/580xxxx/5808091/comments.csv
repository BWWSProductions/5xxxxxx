[V],twentyforty,2010-09-03T17:28Z,"@houruoha: 720p HDTV.

@seenoevil47: Nope. In moment of writing number of seeders was 7+1 (me). houruoha asked, knowing the rules of initial-seeding."
[T],houruoha,2010-09-03T19:35Z,"@2040 
quality 40% better than regular xvid encoding.
now where the hell will i get some 720p source
hehehhe
thanks

[V],twentyforty,2010-09-03T20:21Z,"@houruoha: 1080p and 720p transport streams are available only for crazy bastards like myself who are insane enough to download 4-7 GB per one episode (True Blood and other ~1 h shows are up to 8.6 GB) then in painfully slow process reencode the input in human acceptable sizes.
Keep in mind that Scene-groups NEVER ever made their HDTV streams publicly available.

Therefore, I suggested like zillion times, to anybody interested in encoding (especially in days back on mininova) - to be wise and do sanity-check about such endeavors - doing such immense and heroic job on regular basis pays off JUST if download base is big enough.
Doing all that shit for yourself and few friends is noble - but relatively stupid...
Whoever wants to do it anyhow - my suggestion was and is to use Best source available - especially sources that can pass aforementioned sanity check and could fit in someone's monthly allowance.
I cannot say anything different than to follow my rule, an order of sources, and follow that through:
1. 720p or 1080p transport streams
if not available
2. 720p or 1080p AVC encodings (x264, WebDL)
if not available
3. High bitrate XviD

So, if 1. can't fly, for whatever reason, you should fall on 2., and if 2. doesn't fly - use option 3."
