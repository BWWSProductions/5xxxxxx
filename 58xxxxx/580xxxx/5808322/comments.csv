,greensmoke1313,2010-09-03T20:28Z,"@ jonezis - that sucks man, gonna buy this one anyway but i wanna play it in the mean time. The demo was great except you had to watch the damn celebration every time you played a period"

,Warlock2019,2010-09-04T18:29Z,*is not reporting but i don't think it is because the disc drive is not working hard at all.
,Dansi51,2010-09-05T01:15Z,anyone confirm if it is working? i dont wanna waste my time uploading something that is a fake
,Dansi51,2010-09-05T18:05Z,just burnt it and it works fine
,Lepy60,2010-09-05T21:01Z,This is probably a stoopid question but im sure many stoopid people as me are wondering the same. Can you play this in europe?

,Hcore,2010-09-06T10:52Z,Can anyone give me full roster of AIK in this game? :)
,kjjs1980,2010-09-07T00:41Z,can someone tell me what i'm doing wrong? i downloaded it fine but i keep getting the stealth status is uncertain and the verification failedl in abgx. I used utorrent to download. unrarx to extract and abgx to verify it. I am also on a mac if that helps
,champ006,2010-09-07T06:48Z,kjjs1980  nothing is wrong.. ABGX is not updated with games that are not released yet thats why you get it. wait a few weeks should be able to stealth patch it. so don't play online. play offline with a gamer tag hard drive that never goes online or get banned. release is sept 7th in US 
,champ006,2010-09-07T06:49Z,kjjs1980 nothing is wrong. game is not released yet. releases today the 7th in US. ABGX is not updated yet. wait like 2 weeks and see should be stealth by then. don't play online or with gamertag that goes online or hard drive. 
,PatsMWF,2010-09-12T17:54Z,wackeypei ... What did you do cause it didn't work for me....
