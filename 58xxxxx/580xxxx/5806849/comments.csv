,Limewave,2010-09-03T07:30Z,"55 leechers, seriously guys? Can someone please seed this?"
,figrindan,2010-09-03T11:53Z,"Welcome back, Chouonsoku.  Thanks for the new episodes."
,Barboron,2010-09-03T22:59Z,"Had me worried you were not coming back Chouonsoku :P

Thanks very much for these Adventure Time! torrents. Great quality.

Stuck at 92.1% now but hopefully that will pick back up in time when more people can seed"
,Chouonsoku,2010-09-03T23:14Z,"Limewave, this just got uploaded yesterday you fucking tard. How about you wait until the file has been seeded initially before complaining? I'm uploading at 3 MB/s, split between 105 people is about 29 kbps ea."
,Limewave,2010-09-04T09:56Z,"Just didnt notice it was uploaded so recently. I thought there were a bunch of fucks who were leeching and running with a 650mb torrent, and I was having a go at them, not you."
,soak314,2010-09-04T15:02Z,"I'm having a problem with episodes 10 and 11, both are showing up with red ""unavailable"" portions on uTorrent's file download status bar. 

The download won't finish because of this.

Any ideas on how to fix?"
,gir4prez,2010-09-04T15:56Z,Seed please! D: I'm stuck at 92.1%!
,Chouonsoku,2010-09-04T18:34Z,"I've been seeding the entire time, I don't know why you're all stuck at 92.1%. Blame public torrent trackers."
,Chouonsoku,2010-09-04T18:38Z,"K, did a new hash-check and apparently the torrent just fucked up when it was created cus it's saying I only 92.1% of the files even though I created them. Re-made the files to double check and they're 100% accurate. So expect a new torrent soon."
,Chouonsoku,2010-09-04T19:23Z,Download the new torrent here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5810921.
