,ruddip,2010-09-04T15:48Z,"i think i got it right the first time.  it just seemed odd that once i got everything done with utorrent and uploaded on piratebay the seeded section on here showed 0.  i'm thinking....i'm the main seeder so why does it show zero.  anyway, so i've been seeding all night.....

as of this message i'm typing:
on utorrent it shows zero seeds but 10(22) peers.
on piratebay...zero seeds 1(8) leech

is this normal?"
