I've applied ""rev-emu_9_8_3-nologging"", hence you dont get viruses etc. 
You can find the emulator here: http://www.rev-crew.info/project/RevEmuWin32/v9_83"

,nofear24,2010-10-21T13:45Z,"gets stuck on first level in the elevator. bug? u click elevator button and then just wait and wait and nothing, then like hectic zombie noises and still in elevator."
,mukidz029,2010-10-22T07:43Z,"great torrent, works great, especially since I just wanted to play single player. Just a few minor problems though, there is a campaign without a proper name, and also, the game closes after you finish one campaign. Any fix for that? it's just a bit annoying to finish a campaign and you want to play another campaign but the game suddenly closes."
,PaLL3rs,2010-10-23T12:12Z,@mukidz029: This works in multiplay aswell... ;)

,tykep,2010-11-08T07:37Z,wait is this supposed to not work with single player when it is updated.. then u can only play multiplayer?
,PaLL3rs,2010-11-08T08:14Z,I always start up a dedi server and run it in coop mode. If i play alone i got bots and if with friends they just take one of the chars. 
,amado198427,2011-07-14T08:00Z,thank you so much i got it working online and offline but there is no players in any of the lobbies and i tried searching for people to play with but no luck. people this is a very good torrent with no viruses. 100 percent clean all you need to do is open the L4D2Dserver and let it run while you click the left 4 dead 2 application and then on the bottom of the screen you will see stream server and it will say your server name here or somthing like that. i dont know how to create a game. i hope to see you all playing. i hate playing with the fucking computer bots they are so stupid and annoying.
,Ieech,2011-08-16T08:59Z,If im not missing something where is the Intro of the game? do i have to update the game or something to restore it?
