why it is only 5.92 GIB while others 7.3 GIB ?!"
,hunter212yy,2010-09-01T11:31Z,It's packed in rar files. That other one is only iso-it's not packed so it's bigger.

,CLe4n3r,2010-09-16T19:23Z,Wahts is the report says of abgx is it staehlt or currupt
,chtnydv,2010-09-17T13:51Z,Dont mind if the abgx log says Game CRCs do not match.I downloaded it and works perfectly fine!!!.However I have not tried this game on Xbox Live.Other Than That The GAME IS PERFECTLY FINE...
,xchillin,2010-09-17T21:13Z,I have never seen such a stern warning from the ABGX360 report like this before...even on other games that I scanned before their release dates. I deleted the iso and I am re-extracting it again now and will rerun ABGX360 on it again. Has anyone played this on Live yet? That warning from ABGX360  that something was wrong with the file (and gave 4 possible reasons for the detected corruption) has me worried....I have never seen that warning from ABGX360 before...
,lucasmxbr,2010-09-23T13:44Z,"Ok so..
I tested here, didnt worked at first time.. Burned it again, and worked perfectly..
I dont know if the main language of this game is spanish, but when i inserted it it came in portuguese (my coutry language), so i believe its MULTI5 of something. Anyway, worked on my NTSC arcade.

And the problem with abgx.. I've checked and i got the same problem as everybody.. I didnt used it online yet, im playing it offline with the cable unplugged.. Anyone has tried it online?"
,woodwindjai,2011-11-18T04:21Z,For making it work for online check this site haloreachpc.com/crack/ It worked easily for me...
