"Like the title says. This album does a wonderful job of conveying these 

vibes. Dark and massive. The massive part is especially profound in a 

few tracks, when listening to this album, I've had moments where I felt 

like I was floating in the sea, with waves crashing overhead at the 

surface, and massive blue whales swimming beneath me. It was pretty 

cool." (http://www.amazon.ca/Dark-Massive-Disengage-
