Once again running behind, just have been busy lately. Anyways,did our usual stuff to the video. Sharpened it a little, changed the RGB around, changed the white level slightly,etc. We went through the screener and made a proper sub file, then went through the R5 and aadjusted the times. Hard Coded them in yellow so they are nice and easy to read without the Russian subs being Imagines release to our video. Thanks guys!

credit Rx & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
