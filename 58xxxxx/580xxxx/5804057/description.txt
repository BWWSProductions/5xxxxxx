Reunion Island is a French Isle locaded in the Indian Ocean near the East coast of Africa. Its scenery covers the entire isle with photorealistic textures of a high quality haute qualitÃ©, on which each airport has been precisely aligned and enhanced compared to the Flight Simulator 2004 default scenery.

This scenery also includes a full and specific autogen for the area, and a realistic AI traffic based on real airlines timetables and flight plans. This way, the virtual pilot will enjoy a large flight area in which he can fly both VFR or IFR with an unprecedented realism.

Features

    * Reunion Island entirely covered by photorealistic textures
    * Textures based on IGN aerial photos (not satellite), enhanced for the best visual effect in Flight Simulator.
    * Summer textures only
    * Specific Autogen for the area (houses and vegetation) on the whole isle.
