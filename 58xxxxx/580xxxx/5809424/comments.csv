Nothing is missing my friend.  The movie consist of one(1) spoken language and one(1) subtitle. Maybe this is the reason why it is very small in size.  This is an original DVD which i bought from a record store.

Thanks for writing a comment.  I hope you enjoy this movie.  Please seed after downloading.
