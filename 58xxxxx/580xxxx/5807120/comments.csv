i'm a big fan of Sara, and this is great. The mix of ""King of Anything"" is different than the single version however, which i found interesting."
,maliciousdestin,2010-09-04T01:06Z,Hate hate HATE the watermark on the songs. I'll wait for a release that doesn't have them.
,brent825,2010-11-15T06:20Z,"Every song has the periodic voice saying ""Music On Demand"". These songs were probably captured from a live stream... which leads me to believe that, in addition to the annoying voice, they are probably not true 256. It may have been captured at that bit rate, but I doubt the stream was that high of quality. "
