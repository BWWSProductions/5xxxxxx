,Fozboz,2010-09-04T14:46Z,"Seriously, how about seeding?"
,beerman100,2010-09-04T14:53Z,"@fozboz

Because they have all removed the torrent after DL and are watching this movie right now because they do not care about TPB or its users. Thats why they are called LEECHERS."
,Br1xXx,2010-09-04T14:54Z,"@FozBoz 

How about if you seed? Im downloading with ~2MB/s and uploading with ~4... There more you give the more you get, so quit whining."

,pcube,2010-09-04T16:41Z,simplest  definition of seeding:seeding means not removing the torrent aftre downloading is complete ..... oh yes ....and also not stopping
,silentbob515,2010-09-04T16:45Z,"4 hours,52% down,nearly 400% up.30/10 mb link.Everything is clear for me now,bigger upload speed=slower download.

In the United States, a new law proposal called The Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA) was introduced last week, and there will be a hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee this Thursday.

If passed, this law will allow the government, under the command of the media companies, to censor the internet as they see fit, like China and Iran do, with the difference that the sites they decide to censor will be completely removed from the internet and not just in the US.
