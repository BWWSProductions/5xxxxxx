Looks like we have the needed number of seeders for Las Vegas Seasons 1 and 2.  

KEEP SEEDING THEM.  

I am suspending my seeding of seasons 1 and 2 so I can quickly seed Season 3...so keep it all going.  Thanks.

LAS VEGAS - TV show  H.264 .m4v/.mp4

SEASON 3

OKâ€¦first off there are a few known problems.

The disks I rented had some scratches causing some chunk pixilation and a short audio drop on episodes 12 and 22.

I have kept these rips intact but I have also included alternative broadcast rips of these episodes.

I tried to fast scan through each episode after I ripped it and watched samples of each episode for audio and video quality checks. 

------------ 
NEW SEED.  Please keep this seeding as I have limited bandwidth.  I will put up Season 4 after I see 4 seeders.

I'm a big fan of this show and unfortunately there are some pretty crappy torrents available for these shows and all in an .avi format

I rented the DVD's of Las Vegas and ripped H.264 MP4 files of each episode.  The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using Handbrake with an Apple TV standard so they can be played on any iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes.  They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.
   
There are no subtitles or alternate languages.
