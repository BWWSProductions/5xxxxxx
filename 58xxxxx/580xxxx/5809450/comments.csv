I've been around TPB for a few years now and will say, there are people who do exactly what you mention, as too have i many times.

But opposite side of the coin is, it's simple enough to have IMDB as a links bookmark, select/copy/paste name of media from several places on the torrent page into IMDB search bar or Google if as is the case of many Discovery Ch and History Ch etc.

It is simple enough to do and to check something takes me all of about 10 seconds with IMDB and 30-60 with Google.

Sometime TV Team do have a brief synopsis, sometimes they don't, same with some other regular uploaders, sometimes somebody will post a link to IMDB or another description page.

But as well as what you say, and i do agree and have posted links myself, again as too many users have, one could argue that uploaders to public trackers could take a couple of minutes when upping, to include an IMDB link in the input box provided on the upload torrent page, i notice you haven't one upload, did you know there's an IMDB link box on the upload page matey.

But don't get me wrong, i appreciate the time and effort of every uploader of at least half decent quality media.

So too, could any user spend 10 seconds to a couple of minutes to copy and paste the name of something into IMDB or Google it for info', the users of TPB aren't incapable.

But to have a pop, albeit in a respectful manner, at all users as though nobody else but you bothers, seems a bit, well, conceited matey.

I've had a right go at racists on here, i've taken issue when some smart arse trolls slag off one of the decent uploaders etc, i've posted links myself.

But not once in the years i've used TBP, have i once dug the community out just because there's no links posted in comments as the uploader hasn't any NFO description or IMDB link.

I do agree, but again, users themselves aren't incapable.

Just because on this occasion, i've not seen your name anywhere else before so don't know if you actually post a link in torrent comments, Every occasion there's no info' but just because you happen to be the first to bother on this page doesn't mean nobody else does bother nor does it give you the right to output your ego and call out the community for not providing info, you never know, i myself having navigated to the page may have done so in your absence, maybe somebody else will have.

So when you say everybody shouldn't be so lazy and selfish, perhaps you shouldn't take it upon yourself to be so smug and coat of the whole TPB community as though nobody else gives a crap but you, because it definitely isn't the case.

The mods, at least one i know from the forum when i used to post there, maintain the site, want to have a pop at them for not caring enough to amend torrent where uploader don't include NFO descriptions or IMDB links, i mean they work for the site matey, care to cite them as lazy and selfish?

I admit, the last time i posted links is a few months back, but i do and so do many other but i've never see any other person coat everybody else off just because some torrents which upper ain't given description doesn't happen to have links already posted by another member.

Are you sure you aren't just having a go, because as links weren't already provided, you had to be inconvenienced and had to go look for yourself and it's more a case of ""How dare people make me work for my information on the media so i am damned well going to say something!"" sort of thing, i mean getting Pissed off and deciding to coat people off because you had to go and search for the info yourself, is worse than lazy and selfish, is it not.


No offence like.


Peace. : )
