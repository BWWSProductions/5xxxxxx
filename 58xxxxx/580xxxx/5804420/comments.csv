,Yaggy,2010-09-04T07:24Z,"Downloaded it. Many thanks.

And now, a suggestion â You've stripped out the most vital extra from the DVD, i.e. the Director's Commentary, and have left the rest of the crap intact. Now, whatever made you think cast and crew interview would be more important than what the maker of the film has to say about the film he made! Hope next time you will use some more intelligence when stripping out the extras!

Thanks again for the upload. Appreciate your work."
