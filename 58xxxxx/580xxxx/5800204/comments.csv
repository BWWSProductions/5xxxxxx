Enjoy and seed this torrent.Thanks uploader "
,scrpzking,2010-09-01T06:27Z,"Like many others I prefered that you ripped in mp4 format as most devices support it and it counts as a dominant format as of late as most households own a ps3, xbox or apple device. plus you get to hook it onto a big screen tv and enjoy it (like me) and mkv is only playable on the computer itself. Though your rips never fail in quality I hope you would consider ripping them in mp4 again because your still ripping them at the same size and I was opting for your rips because of the mp4 format.

If anyone does know any quality mp4 rippers let me know, I'd appericate it.

I think we should have a poll...mp4 or mkv

MP4 for me
