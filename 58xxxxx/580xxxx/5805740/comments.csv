,hollydey,2010-12-18T18:19Z,"Toxicatedworld is a dolt.  This torrent works perfectly.  Simply download, then unzip/unrar the file.  Double click the setup icon.  No need to mount in Daemon Tools or the like.

I'm a couple hours into the game at present; it works fine!  :)"

I'll be seeding while I play because I'm home sick today. xD  Thanks esharoth! Do you have any other ND games by chance? I'd like to play Danger on Deception Island but I can't find it anywhere. "
