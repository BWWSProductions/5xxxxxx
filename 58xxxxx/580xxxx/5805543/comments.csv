,Caree,2010-10-10T12:47Z,"I do appreciate the upload, I really do, but I just need to ask you one thing nickecross. Why do you put the VIDEO_TS in a .rar-file, which you later divide into many .rar-files. Why couldn't you just have put the VIDEO_TS folder in the .rar-files immediately?

Think of it until next time you decide to upload. Don't double-rar it.."

,javierdev,2010-10-26T00:26Z,"Excelente torrent, bajo rapidÃ­simo. Lo Ãºnico es que hay que descomprimir el archivo .iso que esta en el r-dwftgnhtdk.rar y listo, con cualquier programa para grabar dvd's lo graba de uno. Buena calidad y gracias por los subtÃ­tulos en espaÃ±ol.

Excellent torrent, very fast download. The only thing is you have to unzip the file .iso that is in the r-dwftgnhtdk.rar and ready, any program to burn dvd's will recording. Good quality and thanks for the subtitles in Spanish."
,Azzabat,2010-11-17T22:27Z,"Would you mind explaining why the additional descriptive audio track is always removed from your uploads?

I am registered blind/visually impaired. While this content is of little use to you, not everyone who uses bittorrent can say the same. For me, the audio description track is vital, and increases my enjoyment and understanding of the film.

It would appear that some teams, eg BOW and 2LIONS, actively strip this vital content along with the apparent ""junk"". They seem to think that if you don't speak English or have good vision that DVDs are useless.

In some ways this feels like a personal attack. It is certainly discriminatory. Many visually impaired people use bittorrent.

In future, please leave the audio description track intact. If you have any current releases can be reseeded with the audio description track I for one would appreciate it.

Thank you."
