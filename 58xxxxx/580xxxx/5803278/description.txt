The Deep [5 Part Miniseries]

The submarine  'Hermes' disappears in the Arctic,along with its module  'Caspar' with marine biologist Catherine Donnelly on board. Six months later Catherine's engineer husband Clem joins the crew of another submarine,the 'Orpheus',to discover the fate of the 'Hermes',and captained by Frances Kelly,who is in an affair with married crew-man Samson. Also on board is salvage expert Raymond Hopkins,who plays Frances and Clem a recording of Catherine's last words,implying that the 'Hermes' was swallowed by something huge. The 'Hermes' is located but the 'Orpheus' gets stuck on the sea-bed with a mysterious craft hovering above it. Another crew member Maddy dies after arguing with Raymond,causing suspicion as to the real reason for his presence.
But this is only the beginning...

The Deep is a fantastic BBC 5 part miniseries, which is highly enjoyable and one of this years best shows so far! I loved it so much, that I made a little trailer again (to the music of Queen's 'Under Praesure'Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â), in case you want to show a friend, what the show is about... ;)

All files properly named, keeping the original filen ames intact. I don't take credit for what I didn't do! This pack wouldn't have been possible without eztv, VTV, TvTeam, thank you all!

Please be patient,  upload speed is 1Mbit, which means after 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.
