Dj.Nece's Classics Of House Mix 3
This summer deserves some classics for the children to remember so as always I got that for you!
I chose some of the hottest jams from way back then when The Sound Factory in New York was
ruling things and there were no such things as another best club. I took it back to some of those fun
days you will remember with this mix. Some jams you will remember but if you don't you will just
imagine what it was like. I was a young kid just catching up to some of these hits but hey I am here!

Hope you liked it some artist you will now know them as Roger Sanchez, Fatboy Slim that's because you haven't
done your history homework a this electronic music thing. This one is dedicated to the music industry if your
DJ's dont know about these sounds maybe you need to check me out and contract me!?Keep the music pumping
and listen closely. Don't think it stops there wait til the next one!!As always tell a friend or a million!
God Bless You All!
