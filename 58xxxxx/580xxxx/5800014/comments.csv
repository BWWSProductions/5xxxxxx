IMAGiNE NOTES
SOURCES:
VIDEO: Russian DVD9 - Thanks to our russian friend
AUDIO: Russian DVD9 - Thanks to our russian friend

Right the source was great ... one of the better R5's we've seen ... only thing that really needed changing was the brightness levels and make it a bit more alive, as it was dull looking. So all we've done is did a script and added white balance, brightness, contrast, chroma, hue, sat, intes and sharpness ... oh along with the normal crop and resize ;-) The subs were already in english  ( when needed ) which is a change as they normally aren't. The audio on it was a nice english 5.1 audio track so it was a simple demux and remux .

We opted for the larger file size though so we could keep bitrate decent as it was a long film and we also wanted to keep the original audio track so ......Any lower and i think it would spoil it. (well still watchable but we'd rather have better quality anyday)."
