,suck22,2010-09-04T13:40Z,there is no one seeding.
,kennlou,2010-09-05T09:16Z,dont upload if your not going to seed :(
,suck22,2010-09-05T10:02Z,"Jason, there is no one seeding. How are we supposed to seed when there is no one seeding it in the first place?"
,firsteye,2010-09-06T07:52Z,Is 99.6% really the highest this torrent goes because it's been at that for a really long time even though it only took a short time to reach it?
,Mercyflush64,2010-09-08T01:16Z,I have the full download and I'm seeding it and will for a while. Just a warning though issue #2 is missing pages and won't open. I used winrar to see what was inside so if you really need to read it you can do it that way or find another source
,jasonfire23,2010-09-08T02:08Z,tnx for seeding guys.....
,UnfadingJihad,2010-09-24T23:10Z,This isn't complete. It doesn't include the crossovers that have vital points to this series. 
,IkillLater,2012-05-29T22:29Z,if u notice it doesnt say red hulk complete with crossovers 
,IkillLater,2012-05-29T22:29Z,and yes i like commenting on old pots
