likes of the Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, et al. That pleasantly stoned, slightly detached, wonder-of-it-all feeling is certainly present throughout the album. A mildly bemused attitude towards the world is at the center of the lyrical excursions, married to accessible, pure-pop moves.

The debatable alt-country flavor that some heard on SLUMP is essentially absent here, with the balance tipped more in favor of that classic straight-eighths indie guitar style married to some gorgeous atmospheric production touches and some first-class melodic songwriting. With the combination of heavenly harmonies, hooky melodies, and kooky electronic effects, one is tempted to imagine what might have happened if the Electric Light Orchestra started out in the mid-'90s in a basement with a four-track and went on from there.
