x264 and H264 are two totally different encoding. x264 uses x264.exe via Handbrake,Megui,libebml,libmatroska,mkvmerge etc according to my choice. You may find x264 encoding a little bigger in size
where H264 encoding is encoded with toolchain provided by twentyforty [this encoding is much better i guarantee you :)]http://thepiratebay.org/user/twentyforty
enjoy
