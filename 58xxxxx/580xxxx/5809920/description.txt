    An intimate portrait of the spectacular Drakensberg -      
    'dragon mountains' - of South Africa, following giant     
    antelope, bone-cracking vultures and raucous baboons as  
    they struggle to survive in a land of extremes.           
                                                               
    Serval cats and jackals patrol the slopes watching for    
    any weakness and bearded vultures fly overhead. Eland    
    antelope face constant challenges straight from birth     
    and climb high to find food but avoid wildfires,           
    freezing rain and starvation on the way. Despite these    
    battles, this mountain kingdom offers some respite in    
    summer and allows life to cling on in Africa's stunning   
    Dragon Mountains.
