This version of NodeZero has a tool that's been causing him legal trouble, which is why the file isn't currently online on the website (http://netinfinity.org/download/). He's making changes, and then will upload the file again sometime this week. But he's asking that no one uses this version, as he doesn't want any lawsuits. Thanks."

If anything, that makes me want this torrent even more....What tool is he talking about? Is the tool removed for proprietary reasons, or is this some tool that could be used for 'good' by ethical hackers but in ways the establishment doesnt care for?

My curiosity is piqued. 

Would you mind telling me which tool is the one in question? I would be very interested in researching this.

Of course I would always be a vocal supporter in his favor if problems were to arise, and I do respect that you are offering this stated position/disclaimer that this is not being distributed by his will. "
,Nicodemos_the_Djinn,2010-09-20T14:08Z,DEFINITELY get this torrent now before its gone forever!!!!!
,Nicodemos_the_Djinn,2010-09-20T14:21Z,"Where did my post go? Maybe I posted a follow up too soon?

Do you happen to know what tool is the one in question?

I can respect that he is taking this position for liability reasons, which he is obligated to take, though I suspect that the problem isnt that we HAVE this tool but rather that he is taking all the necessary efforts to stop its distribution....he really isnt responsible for what others distribute against his will though.

Medibuntu runs into the same licensing issues, yet everyone who matters installs it anyway....but the distros themselves sometimes wont because they can get in trouble while individual users have little to worry about.

If you would tell me which tool is the one in question, that would be awesome....maybe I could take full responsibility and add it to my own distro I am working on (just for myself and friends).

Perhaps I could rip the app into a deb with APtonCD, then add it to a remastered version of Mint XFCE +E17."
,grantstone1,2010-09-29T04:24Z,"I'm not sure which specific tool is creating a legal issue for him, as he didn't specify. And just to be clear, you do NOT need to download this torrent before it's removed. It's not like the distro will disappear if this torrent is gone. When he uploads the final product he's been working on, there will be another torrent for that. This distro is here to stay though. If you want more specific information, email him like I did. ^_^"
,Rogueassassin,2010-10-03T12:57Z,"I hope you can understand the curiosity. Obviously the DISTRO will still be around, but WITHOUT some of the tools.

Are these tools any good? Are they so cool they are now illegal? Is it really a ""licensing"" issue like you say it is, or could it have something to do with the law against certain types of cracking software just passed in Germany?

If it was verified that it is ONLY some trivial packages removed, then yes, there would be no reason to keep this version around.

If there is some hacker tool that we wont have access to in future versions that we cant even get on backtrack, then people are going to want to hold onto it.

I dont want to get the guy in trouble, and I seriously doubt he will if he voluntarily removed it from his official distribution, but maybe somebody would want to make .deb files for the missing apps, rebrand them and take full responsibility for them themselves without attacking his name to it.

Knowing the tools in question would probably help everyone, as they could be forked and he could wash his hands of them. "
,grantstone1,2010-10-20T07:26Z,"The official one is back online now. From what I understand, he did more than just take off a tool a two. He changed some other things as well.

Thanks."
,haxist,2011-09-19T23:06Z,"Is there some reason nobody will tell us what tools were removed and what changes were made? It seems like a simple question.

What if some of us want to use these tools on our own, separate, taking all the responsibility away from him?

Somebody should explain to me what the harm will be if I choose to seed this.
