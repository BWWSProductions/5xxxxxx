,Hipirarte,2010-10-10T14:26Z,"first I wanna thank you for your torrent. I installed it on my galaxy, it works very well but it doesn't show the cars pictures.
Is this my problem or the game doesn't show any car?"
,nofear24,2010-10-10T17:15Z,Works on Sony X10 but the cars are black with the background can only see brake lights and the green arrows to follow the rest of the track is all one black. is it cause of android 1.6?
,Hipirarte,2010-10-10T17:51Z,I have the same problem on Android 2.1
,Hipirates,2010-10-10T18:03Z,me too
[T],xxThugxx,2010-10-10T22:17Z,Hipirarte did you install the omap version? nofear24 i think this may need eclair+ what cpu does the x10 use? is it an arm cpu?
,Hipirates,2010-10-11T10:27Z,"I installed the omap version. When I was copying the Android folder to my sd card, I replaced the data. Does it have anything to do with my problem?
(cars have no picture)"

,metro2033,2011-05-13T10:50Z,wtf i installed first this game and it worked and seond time i got corupted graphics...wtf ? ? ?
,metro2033,2011-05-13T11:22Z,"ok got it : this is how you get rid of the black cars 

1.Reset your phone (not sure)
2.instal Astro
3.Instal the apk. for Snapdragon (not OMAP)
4.DO NOT COPY ANY OTHER DATA ON YOUR PHONE, yes just instal it no need of the data folder thats why xxThugxx includet only the apk in the folder"
,f.tremblay94,2011-05-20T22:22Z,"Does it work for Androids without sd card slot, like the Nexus S? If i copy the .apk file in the internal memory, will i be able to install the game or app?
Thanks"
,rabatavus,2011-07-10T23:03Z,"This is not working for me. Tried both version on my galaxy S2. All I get is the white screen with EA logo and then the app seems to crash, I get back to applications menu.
Any help?"
,henryaga,2011-07-19T16:22Z,"Thanks.  It is working fine in HTC incredible (Snapdragon processor).

I just wanted to add the music files to the install.  Is that possible? I saw the music files in the other version, but the Snapdragon version is not containing music at all. How can I add the music to the app?

Thanks again!"
