Even if some of the apks you have posted are simply the demo versions, many thanks for all your posts!

maagrapu,

Thanks for commenting and saving the rest of us trouble. Good comments make any torrent posting more valuable

,maagrapu,2010-09-04T21:15Z,"I'm very happy for the Android releases by xxThugxx and mean no disrespect. Thanks for all the nice apps and games so far.

I've put some coins to buy some of the apps I found particularly useful - IMO, they are very cheap, but I still want to try the full thing out before swinging the credits."
,maagrapu,2010-09-04T21:40Z,"It's funny when some anti-pirates start talking about how cheap the apps are, and how expensive the hardware is compared: ""Yeah you've put 600€ to buy a phone and now you're getting cheap buying software that costs less than 2€!"" I always tell them that ""if you owned a 2M€ Bugatti Veyron, would you buy 1kg of cow maneuver for 1€, if it was sold to you as a 'farm odor' to your car?"""

specifically 
Norton antivirus mobile
Kaspersky antivirus mobile"
,selkie606,2010-09-05T09:18Z,"oh and for the people complaining about them not being cracked or saying you need to buy it

that is probably because of the different versions of android"
[T],xxThugxx,2010-09-05T10:33Z,"selkie i used to do winmo apps lol i uploaded a version of kasperky ages ago, i think the definition database is still updatable, look here:  thepiratebay.org/torrent/4723634/Kaspersky_Anti-Virus_For_The_Pocket_PC , if its no use tell me and i'll get hold of them for ya "
