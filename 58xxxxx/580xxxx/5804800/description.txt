DOSBOX 0.65

NOTE: (taken from readme file)
=====

While we are hoping that one day, DOSBox will run all programs
ever made for the PC, we are not there yet. At present, DOSBox running on a 
high-end machine will roughly be the equivalent of a 486 PC. The 0.60
release has added support for "protected mode" allowing for more complex and
recent programs, but note that this support is still in an early stage of 
development and unlike the support for 386 real-mode games (or earlier) hasn't
been completed yet. Also note that "protected mode" games need substantially 
more resources and may require a much faster processor for you to run them
properly in DOSBox.


An essential program needed to play many older games on newer machines. Suprisingly for me this actually worked on a x64 bit system (vista x64 ultimate).
