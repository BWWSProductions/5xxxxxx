,karmicboy,2010-09-01T21:15Z,"And also season 14 special - best of 2010 is still missing

I never thought that there is another one like me that REALLY wants this collection completed....

You have all my gratitude.."
,karmicboy,2010-09-01T21:20Z,"Mijmanxx

Please send me a short email at karmicboy@yahoo.com. I will send you a invitation to a very good private TV tracker "
,karmicboy,2010-09-01T21:30Z,Also...the hugh hefner roast...do you have it in a better quality than in my pack?
,Mijmanxx,2010-09-02T03:48Z,"I'll have to look at my Hugh roast. I don't remember what my source of that one was. I am fairly sure I downloaded it somewhere. 

I do have the best of special for season 14. I'll get it up when I can.

The worst part of the Victoria Jackson episode is that...she's not funny. And insane. I wish I could say ""screw her"" and get on with my life. But I'm a completest."

Don't worry, I'm the same.
Started this collection in 2005, on a modem based line, cable, with a max download speed of 350kbs. I was searching everywhere for the episodes(including emule, and waited for months for some episode to get a seed.

Now i have a 100 Mbs dnl fiber line witha 20 Mbs upload one.
So I want to put up this collection asap,"
,Mijmanxx,2010-09-02T18:54Z,"The Best of episode should be up later this evening.

My Hugh Hefner Roast seems to be from yours. But I hold out hope that they'll run it again, for a better copy."
