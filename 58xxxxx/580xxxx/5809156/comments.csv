,XenoJoker,2010-09-04T00:17Z,Now seeding...and will do for a while. Please help seed as its such a large DL.
,galendator,2010-09-08T19:28Z,"No one is seeding ATM. I'll help you seed, when i get it all m8. i got 100/100 mbit connection. "
,XenoJoker,2010-09-08T23:21Z,"I'm seeding, between home and work. So seed may go down for few hrs a day."
,XenoJoker,2010-09-09T14:50Z,"There is an error in the ""Collection Index.txt"" file.

For Macross Zero is says the resolution is ""840x480nominal"". This is wrong its actually 1280x720 through out all the episodes.

I forgot to update the txt file after i found the 720p THORA rip of Macross Zero, which is far better than the one i originally had."
,XenoJoker,2010-09-13T09:33Z,"OK updated my collection with:

1080p version of Macross Zero
1080p version of Macross Frontier
Higher Res of Do You Remember Love?
Higher Res of flashback
Higher Res of Macross7 (ep 1 to 28)
...some others too...
DVD booklets for some releases

If ppl really want these i will make an ""update"" torrent to this one. Please drop a message here and if there is significant interest i will make the torrent but be aware its gona be another 40 odd GBs!"

,gpf_drizit,2010-12-08T06:46Z,Thanks man You of all people probably have a good idea of just how long i've been looking to put somthing like this together myself.  I would gladly download and seed another torrent with the update.  Hell I downloaded the Stargate torrent and that was over 110gb.

,bobkat2769PB,2010-12-22T02:55Z,"I would be very interested in an update torrent with better HD versions and English subtitles! =^.^=

I suspect a lot of others that have already DLed this torrent would also be interested, but unless they saw your comment about adding stuff they wouldn't be likely to come back to read these comments again.

Anyway! I hope you'll put an update torrent up.

Thank you for the great stuff you put up in this one! =^.^="
,koudepinda,2010-12-30T16:57Z,i'd be interested in the higher ress versions. even if its bigger hell i've got 5TB space so why not 
,XenoJoker,2011-01-13T15:57Z,"OK, will start work on the update to this torrent and release within the next few weeks. It will also include 'The False Songstress' at 1080p thanks to Thora."
,koudepinda,2011-01-15T00:58Z,"thnx, looking forward to it."
,tazmanian_dragon,2011-02-23T19:42Z,"Uhmm, it seems no one is seeding anymore..
Xenojoker any clue when you'll start uploading the 'updated' uber collection?

,cdarkdreams,2011-02-25T10:05Z,"This looks like an awesome torrent! I can't wait to check it out.

Could someone please let me know if this includes: 
Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross and
Genesis Climber MOSPEADA?

Thank you!"
,XenoJoker,2011-05-26T13:10Z,"@cdarkdreams

Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross and
Genesis Climber MOSPEADA are not part of this - this is pure macross only. ;)

@everyone

Really sorry for the delay in releasing the updated torrent. Had to spend some serious time finding the best available macross on the net and as a result 90% of my collection has been updated and replaced with some serious macross art and booklet additions.

I'm currently hacking together Jap BD rip versions  (1080p) of Macross frontier and Zero with Thora's 720p released english subs to create the 1080p very high quality release.

Once this is done i will release the new torrent ""Macross Uber Collection II"". Will need your support to check that the subs are synch'ed correctly for Zero and Frontier, but will do my best to check as much as i can before the release.

Hang tight - release will be done very soon - it's worth the wait"
,XenoJoker,2011-05-30T23:55Z,"OK finally released the Macross Uber Complete II here:
