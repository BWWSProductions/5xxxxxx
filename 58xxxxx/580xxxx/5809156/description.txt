OK got tired of tracking down all the Macross Movies and OVAs so made this large collection to make your life easy - but its a large download (i know!)
Made this torrent after weeks of searching the net and compiling the best available (English sub/audio version) downloads for all the macross anime.
Files are avi/divx/xvid as far as i recall with mkv containers in most cases. Use K-Lite standard codec pack 630 or later to play all of these with no problem.

Note: There is another large Macross collection torrent out there made about 3 years ago (~ 2007) which did not have Macross Frontier.
Some of the comparable files were also of lower quality probably to save the file size.

In (release order) the collection has: (* denotes Jap with Eng subs / ^ denotes 640x480 res)

None of the robotech junk which was hashed together from Macross and other anime by US broadcasters.
None of the movies or episodes are split across multiple files, each is contained in a single file
