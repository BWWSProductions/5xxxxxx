[V],harry711,2010-09-08T05:38Z,"@jamesensor: just copy and paste the downloaded vpks from this torrent into the \Steam\steamapps\common\left 4 dead 2\left4dead2\addons directory. You need L4D2-Addon-Support installed as well (Steam->Library->Tools-> L4D2 Addon Support). After doing that, you're done! You should now be able to join or create a game with these maps with other people!"
