,cool1919,2012-05-11T07:23Z,"rom the pdf i found that 
""Normally, we wouldnât hard-code a width and height value here. 
However, because weâre using those navigation icons, we need 
to return to the PSD and measure the width and height of those 
images. I found them to be 112px wide and 111px high."" 

but in the source file, i didn't find the exact pixel for the icons. so i couldn't finish the project. anyone understanding my problem?"
