@ Mitzip

I don't know about Kickass but I attach a sample with all my movie uploads so u can check urself. 

Also I would like to insist to everybody to check the sample always before downloading as screenshots does not always give a true Picture

,DSIN,2010-09-04T09:28Z,thx for this one bro... this is another cool movie... gr8 quality (checked the sample) - a/v = 10/10  XD
,Djchaks,2010-09-04T09:37Z,"I think Iron Man 2 720p will be out soon.bcoz dvdrip is out already.Plz do it as soon as possible.And try to do it in a quality like ""The Dark Knight"".Your POP was a bit pixelated and not upto ur standard.You can increase a few MBs for that.OK? Reply....."
,DSIN,2010-09-04T13:25Z,@Djchaks : wat r u sayin dude... i think POP was pretty awesome Rip.. ofcourse his Dark knight is one of his best quality Rip after avatar IMO..
,Djchaks,2010-09-04T15:07Z,"@DSIN, I was saying what I saw in some places of the film.Otherwise I am a huge fan of Riddler.And i think evryone would want every film to be of the same quality as of The Dark Knight....Isn't it? It wasn't a complain.Just a suggestion."
,jamydoug,2010-09-04T15:45Z,"dude thanks a lot for this!!!
this was my own request..
u r d best ever!!"
,wira020,2010-09-15T00:23Z,"Thank you so much for this.. audio and video is great.. totally good.... the film is great.. i love seeing daniel day lewis as bill the butcher.. I think he acts better than johnny depp in pirates of caribbean.. I just wish they had someone else other than Leonardo dicaprio, he's a bad actor imho... thanks riddlerA!!!"
,gustaff14,2010-09-15T21:31Z,"man...your uploads are the best, thnx for existing!"
,wolf890,2010-09-16T17:48Z,Thanks dude
,MikeQuest333,2010-12-19T15:47Z,seems like a very good torrent but the end credit have been mentioned cut off..... :(
,Riyote,2010-12-27T17:37Z,"RiddlerA......
I am a fan of yours..
I dont even look at other torrents when i see yours... Keep it up man!!!!"
,mikecj,2011-01-26T14:12Z,"beware! i don't know what you lot are watching this guys uploads on?! I am watching off of a LaCinema Classic HD, through HDMI to a 37"" Sony TV. With these i am getting poor quality! Pixelated blacks and over-sharpened edges. I will stick to the 1GB+ file sizes, until someone can actually deliver on this kind of promise! Nice try, thanks for sharing, it's close but it's not quite there yet. If only you didn't over-sharpen and lower the export size so much!
let the onslaught commence!"
,rhshaffer,2011-03-16T10:24Z,"I also was getting pixalated block and the video seemed to stutter as if it was skipping a frame ever 1-2 seconds. If you are looking for a smaller size file it will be better to get the dvdrip rather than this one.
Thanks for trying though."
,FRivera,2011-04-05T20:24Z,"10x Riddler, great quality as always. v8 a9"
