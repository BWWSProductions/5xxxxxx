IMAGiNE NOTES
SOURCES:
VIDEO: Piranha.3D.2010.TS.DVDR-Demedic, Russian relizlab video 5mins 37secs Thanks to both.
AUDIO: Our own line audio.

Well for the work done see our cam version NFO.....
All this is, is the same video we released but now synced to some nice line audio ;-) The audio if turned right up as some noise to it, but it's alot better than the cam audio thats for sure.

And if anyone was confused by our work done on our cam release, i'll sum it up short for ya..... This film is complete no missing scenes..... but we did have to use two sources for the video. First 5mins are blurry due to the 3D effect and then the rest is fine.
