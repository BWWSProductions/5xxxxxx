- Slain Latino Journalist Ruben Salazar, Killed 40 Years Ago in Police Attack, Remembered as Champion of Chicano Rights

Ruben Salazar was one of the most well-known Latino journalists of the 20th Century and one of the few journalists killed while reporting in the United States. This Sunday marked the 40th anniversary of his death. He was killed on August 29th, 1970 when he was struck in the head by a tear gas projectile fired by a Sheriff's deputy into an East Los Angeles bar as he was covering the massive National Chicano Moratorium Against the Vietnam War, a massive antiwar march that drew some 30,000 people to LA's Eastside. For forty years, speculation and controversy have swirled around what happened. We remember the life and legacy of Salazar and the Chicano Moratorium.
