Lyrics :  :D

I used to be so fearless so limitless and free
Happy on my own and nothing really bothered me.
I had desires to see the world, jump out of planes and fly
And I love to be alive but I was not afraid to die

I used to be so sure of things and self-contained
I could carry on with no need to explain
It didnâ€™t matter if I ever made it home
Could go too fast, and drink all night and dance alone

I love to be alive but I was not afraid to die
I love to be alive but I was not afraid to die

Iâ€™ve got everything to lose

I used to be so thoughtless, so easy and free
Could walk away, not think ahead, and had no plans to keep.
No hand to told, no one to bring down with me.
I wouldnâ€™t see the worst and it only hurts me.

I love to be alive but I was not afraid to die
Iâ€™ve got everything to lose
Since Iâ€™ve met you
Iâ€™ve got everything to lose
Iâ€™ve got everything to lose
Since Iâ€™ve met you
Iâ€™ve got everything to lose
Iâ€™ve got everything to lose


Enjoy
