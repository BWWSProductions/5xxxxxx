This is a compilation of dance & house music, collected for Dee Jay's. Here you can find a key and Bpm of each song, which is good for harmonic mixing. Also I will post every week or two, something like this, in my opinion deserves to be noticed and listened to. Enjoy, and be ready for Disco Club and dancing, Aladin.
