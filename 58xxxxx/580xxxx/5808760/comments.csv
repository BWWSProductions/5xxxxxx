,mhrunge1,2010-09-10T06:48Z,"Will this work with non-jailbroken iPhones and iPods, and how does one install these on the Apple products?"
,the_duke78,2010-09-11T01:36Z,"No, it will not work on non-jailbroken iDevices.  You need to jailbreak yuour iTouch or iPhone first.

The simplest way to do that is thru your touch/phone - open Safari and goto www.jailbreakme.com and ""Slide to jailbreak""

Then load up Cydia....then follow these steps.... Cydia -> Manage -> Sources -> Edit -> Add

Enter the link â€œhttp://cydia.hackulo.usâ€ 

Then add the Appsync addon (this stops iTunes deleting the apps you put on the jailbroken device)

---

To install these apps, just double-click and they load into iTunes; then plug your device in and Suynchronise it and Hey Presto, job done!"
,diveross,2010-09-19T14:49Z,"Do you need 3.1 software for appsync ?

My iphone is 4.0.1 and jb"
,the_duke78,2010-09-28T21:47Z,"Appsync is now designed to work on any version of firmware, i started using it when i ran 3.1.2 and now i'm on os4.0 and know people on 3.1.3 and 4.01 that have no problems - i hope you don't either."

,ampageg,2011-02-26T16:54Z,"If you need apps, simply go to apptrakr.org and browse. They have about 95% of all iTouch apps including iPad and iPod Touch."
,ampageg,2011-02-26T16:55Z,"Scratch that, its apptrackr.org not apptrakr.org"
,the_duke78,2011-03-08T02:56Z,"Yeah, I have to agree that apptrackr.org is legendary!  Most of these apps all came from there, but before I knew about the place I was getting them from random torrents - I thought I'd make this for the others that didn't know about apptrackr and forgot to mention it in the description.

,markus-81,2011-03-16T22:55Z,"hi guys, can anyone help me with this. I have performed the jailbreak on my iphone and I have Cydia installed.
I dragged one of these apps into itunes but when it is syncing a message comes up saying "" this app did not installed on the iphone because the app signature is not valid"".
Can someone let me know what I have missed.
Thanks"
,chookiegirl,2011-04-16T11:37Z,jailbreak wont work on versions newer than 4.0.1/ 3.2.1 its says to downgrade which is impossible before using the web site to jail break. Any other sites than can help with jail breaking iphone 4.3.1?
,tgouch,2011-05-01T17:26Z,"Chookiegirl- The new iphones can be jailbroke! I used a program called Green poison, however there is a step that MUST be performed before you can jailbreak the new iphones. You must open the file     C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts for Windows or /etc/hosts for Mac. Once you are to this point you must add the following entry      74.208.10.249    gs.apple.com           By doing this, Itunes thinks that it is talking to Apple but in reality it is talking to the Cydia which will allow Aplle to access signatures that are already stored by Cydia's ""on file"" feature.


I hope that this has been helpful!!        "
