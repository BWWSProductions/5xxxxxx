I used a flip video to record this. I was in section 3 towards the center. It has the entire concert except the Led Zep solo song from Paul and the song God Gave Rock N Roll To You.
I did my best to record it. Some of it may be a bit fuzzy. But I've watched the concert twice again already. If you love KISS, share this torrent!
