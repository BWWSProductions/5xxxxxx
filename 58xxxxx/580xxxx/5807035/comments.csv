,cameleon1267,2010-09-03T15:43Z,"@cleverta: Interesting. I actually never used this module. I usually work with AC-DC and RF. I will give it a try today.
If you're right about the elechtrochemistry module, I will edit the torrent description to warn people."
,cameleon1267,2010-09-03T16:07Z,"@cleverta: You're right and I think I know why.
The electrochemistry module was implemented I believe in 4.0a and the license file is from 4.0, so it does not recognized the module."

How can I get Comsol 4.0 to work with MATLAB?

THX for the answer!"
,domrich,2011-07-14T21:42Z,Works great! Thanks. I confirm the electrochemistry module do not work with this license like 3D files (IGES or other and solidworks files) .Only STL files can be imported. Did not try Catia files. An idea? 
,pam5663,2011-08-12T03:07Z,"Hi, i use PowerISO, after mounting the disc, I run setup.exe. And it tells me ""the Setup executable launcher was unable to locate its companion shared library"".. any idea what the problem is ?"

but I need someone to bypass the licensing sequence.. (making a crack) I dont have a working passcode or license file."
,bobby2sox,2012-03-20T18:21Z,"Does anyone know where I can find some good tutorials for this?  I am trying to model some magnetic fields for sputter deposition sources. 

Thank you"
,bobby2sox,2012-03-20T22:26Z,"Anyone get the license to work?  I am trying to import solidworks models... cant get that part to work. 

I can model in-program and do some things... but the import doesnt work. "
,bobby2sox,2012-03-27T19:39Z,"okay, I got models to import.... if I save the part in a .WRL format.... so... anyone know how to use this software?  I am interested in simulating magnetic... can anyone help me out?

Thanks. "
,bobby2sox,2012-04-02T18:17Z,"I don't see permanent_magnet.mphbin in there... missing some of the modules, I am trying to do magnetic simulations and there is no neodinnium iron boron in the material library. "
