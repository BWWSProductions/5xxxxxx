Comsol 4.0a (4.0.0.982) DVD ISO for windows, mac and linux

How to install:

1. Burn or mount the iso file with poweriso (free download)
2. choose license file and select the comsol-nodelocked40.dat file

That's it.

I don't take credit for the license file. I got it from MACsimm torrent on demonoid.
This is the license file for 4.0 but it also work on 4.0a

Last time I uploaded this torrent without the license file someone reported it as fake and almost got me banned from TPB.
This iso file is perfectly valid and virus free. I tested it on mac, windows 7 (32 bit) and fedora core without any trouble.

The only problem I noticed, is if you try to run comsol inside a 64 bits virtual machine running windows 7 64 bits. I got it working by launching the 32 bits exe.

This software has only few user so please seed as much as you can.

enjoy the simulation
