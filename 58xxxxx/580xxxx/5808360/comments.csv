,heyman1981,2010-09-04T02:10Z,what happend to you saying KHBBS wasnt out? FAIL
,khik087,2010-09-04T03:19Z,"khbbs? its OK as long as the game works..
can i request the new ufc im w8tin 4 this a long2 time..."
,Fawkes_Lament,2010-09-04T04:40Z,"I'm scared, but will still download.

Reason for wariness: This is 730.81 MB, Japanese one is 1.04 GB (Source: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5297635/(PSP)[JAP]Valkyria_Chronicles_2_[Works_with_5.00_m33-6])"
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-04T06:29Z,"heyman1981, i wonder, why wouldn't you dl KHBBS from wherever it was available? The game wasn't available to me and now - it is. And i have a life, you know. Not just only sitting and waiting for releasing games for you. Also, some hours passed after me saying that, and in our fast-paced internet age it really MATTERS, but whatever. You can prove i failed as long as you want, others just thank, probably)

khik087, i belive, UFC isn't out yet, but coming soon.

Fawkes_Lament, to be honest - it became 730Mb due to some street-magic, that we - releasers regulary do. And ofc it is done to faster your dls a little bit."
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-04T06:59Z,"damn, i was trolled on TPB... never thought it could happen here."

,totsuko,2010-09-04T20:29Z,"people having trouble running this should try to restore the eboot.old to eboot.bin in the iso file!

,Reginleif20,2010-09-06T01:14Z,Sometimes the screen just stays black when you sleep after a mission
,Reginleif20,2010-09-06T01:23Z,"Sometimes, the screen stays black when you sleep after a mission"
,deathtoallorangatans,2010-09-11T04:50Z,I'm getting a black screen when running the game.
,deathtoallorangatans,2010-09-11T04:54Z,"I use Prometheus too. What do you mean by ""try to restore the eboot.old to eboot.bin in the iso file""? How does one do that?"
,Cr1me08,2010-09-11T05:02Z,"Hi im a newb here but this game works on my psp-2000 flawlessly i just updated my gen-d3 to gen-prometheus 2 at first my game stops after i go to sleep in the game but after I updated to prom-2,have no problem since hope this helps!!

here's where i downloaded the prom-2"
,deathtoallorangatans,2010-09-14T22:34Z,Thank you Cr1me08! It's people like you who decide to leave comments that help
,deathtoallorangatans,2010-09-15T01:30Z,"Oh man! That Prom-2 CFW didn't stop the Sleep issue afterall!:( Still black screen when sleeping. It's only happening on the current mission I beat twice now and had to turn the game off after both times because of the error, so maybe it has something to do WITH that mission? Or maybe the problem only actually happens if you choose to Install the data? Come to think of it, I only started having the problems after then! I'll try deleting the installed data and report in after."
,deathtoallorangatans,2010-09-15T03:58Z,"Yes, I deleted the install data for the game (a hefty ~450MB) and I haven't encountered the Sleep issue again yet!=) I'll let you know if it comes back afterall. I never noticed a difference in the speed of the game or anything else between having the data installed or not, so no need"
,exomikage,2010-09-18T16:55Z,"Thanks for the upload
Works for me (5.50 GEN-D3)

Though it sometimes hangs when I load my saved game and automatically turns off.. Since nobody has the same problem as I do - am I doing something wrong? DX

Either way thanks again.. At least I can still play XD"
,Bluuorb,2010-09-19T03:26Z,"why when i try to run this game,

,Geordie1981,2010-10-05T02:23Z,Ok I tried running this game and every time I start the game it hangs and then resets itself!! i'm running 5.50 Prometheus. any help folks??
,Geordie1981,2010-10-05T02:37Z,"Having problems here guys. I downloaded and added to my ISO folder as per normal and i'm running 5.50 prometheus without any problems on other games. As soon as I start the game up it loads for a second, black screens and then resets itself!! Any help?? Plz I really want to play this game!!!"

,arciusrhetus,2012-05-18T19:30Z,"Guys, could you take a minute to complete this survey: bit*ly/GLFront (replace * with .)? It's part of the Gallian Liberation Front campaign to persuade 3rd-party publishers to localize Valkyria Chronicles 3 and the goal to provide a statistics of the fanbase to these publishers. Don't worry, it's not a virus or anything. Thanks a lot!

I'm posting this on other Valkyria torrent as well, sorry for spamming."
