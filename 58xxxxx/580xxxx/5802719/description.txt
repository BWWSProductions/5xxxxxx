[Background]----------------------------------------------------------

"Gordon is the major label debut album by Canadian band Barenaked
Ladies. It was released through Sire Records on July 28, 1992. After
The Yellow Tape was certified platinum in Canada, the group won a
contest hosted by a local radio station. With the winnings, Barenaked
Ladies was able to hire producer Michael Phillip Wojewoda and record
the album at Le Studio, north of Montreal. Though most of the album
was recorded without incident, difficulty with "The King of Bedside
Manor" caused the band to record the track naked--a tradition they
would continue on other albums. Horn parts, guest vocalists, and nods
to other bands including Rush allowed Barenaked Ladies to expand on
the sound they had developed while touring. "They had a real clarity
about what they wanted [the album] to be... I just captured what it
is they do," said Wojewoda."
