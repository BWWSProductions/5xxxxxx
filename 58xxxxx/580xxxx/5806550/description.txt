Plot:
     
"Tere Bin Laden" is a tongue-in-cheek 
comedy about an ambitious young news 
reporter from Pakistan who is desperate 
to migrate to the US in pursuit of the 
American dream. His repeated attempts 
to immigrate are shot down as his visa 
is always rejected. But when things 
couldn't look worse he comes across 
an Osama bin Laden look alike. Ali 
then hatches a scheme to produce a 
fake Osama video and sell it to news 
channels as a breakthrough scoop! 
Unfortunately there are serious 
ramifications as the White House 
gets involved and dispatches a 
overzealous secret agent on Ali's 
trail.
