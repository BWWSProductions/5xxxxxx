           After a car crash, Jamie, 30, comes to, locked in a room       
           at a factory. Her son, a diabetic, is missing. A man           
           wearing a ski mask comes into the room and tells her that      
           she must help him find her husband who has stolen              
           millions from his boss. He says her husband is a killer        
           and a drug trafficker. Jamie is certain it's a mistake.        
           Her captor insists she help him or lose her son. He            
           brings her audio tapes made in their apartment demanding       
           she figure out how her husband was communicating with an       
           accomplice. She has only 12 hours before she and her son       
           will die. Can she force herself to believe that she has        
           been betrayed - and then what? There's no way out, yet         
           she resolves to save her son.
