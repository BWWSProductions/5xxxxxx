Following their extraordinary debut at the Proms last year, 
John Wilson and his hand picked orchestra return to the Royal 
Albert Hall to give a programme of Broadway hits penned by the 
great creative partnership of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. 

Excerpts from Oklahoma!, Carousel, The King and I and The Sound of 
Music are just some of the movie orchestrations recreated by John Wilson 
and performed by his orchestra, with soloists Kim Criswell, Anna Jane Casey, 
Julian Ovenden and Rod Gilfry. The concert is introduced by Katie Derham.
