,upload69,2010-09-02T13:42Z,Are the captions in English or Russian?
,boganhobo,2010-09-03T03:34Z,"I havent watched it yet but i have skipped through parts of the movie. It's basically a filtered version of the russian/english version
I couldnt tell if there was new english scenes but there is definitly russian in the film"
,Mickalick,2010-09-03T04:46Z,"Haven't watched many cams, but its really dark, has the russian text still, audio isn't great and its missing like the first 5 minutes, but it's still watchable.  Great movie, but I would wait for a better one.

,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-09-29T14:15Z,"Everyone should listen to the NOTES on the release. It's watchable since I did sit through it all and watched it. Weird movie. And the quality is sucky. Especially the parts when static from some radio station come in. I wouldn't watch this on a TV. This is a PC movie due to bad quality. Still, watchable movie if you can't wait for a better copy. Appreciate the upload.
