FLAWL3SS NOTES
Well this was a dark movie and we brightened as much as we could with out ruining the black in it. We did our normal stuff to it as we said we brighten the movie along with saturation, contrast, denoiser and finally a sharpen filter to it. The audio is from IMAGINE and aside from the ocassional static and another radio station coming in about 3 or 4 times it's very good better then cam that's for sure so you have been warned. Many thanks to EleKtriKa and IMAGINE. Hope you all enjoy from team FLAWL3SS
