Put more details on the description please.

Firstly, thanks for doing what you do. It's a pretty selfless service that those like you provide, in giving your time, energy, knowledge, etc......to the needy or/and ignorant masses like myself. It's greatly appreciated!

I have a genuine COA for Windows 7 home Premium. Can I use it to authenticate/legitimize this copy (by the means that the makers intended)?

I ask as it would be a total waste to have it but to never use it (and, by doing so, perhaps have to deal with some combative anti-piracy, etc, issue from Microsoft at X point down the line)?

If it is possible what (if anything) would I need to change to this installed download?

Thanks! "
