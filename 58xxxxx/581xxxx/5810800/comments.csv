[V],neon,2010-09-04T18:47Z,No cropping...No hardcoded....  this is the R2 PAL DVD Rip...use srt files for subs
[V],neon,2010-09-04T19:01Z,"Disregard my last comment..heres the info


	English Subs in SRT format for foreign parts only. (turn the subs on/off in your player

After credits have 45 seconds of film

The German R2 PAL DVD have german hardcoded subs on russian parts."
