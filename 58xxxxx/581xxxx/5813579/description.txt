STORY
The Day God Walked Away, is a film that takes a very personal look at the Rwandan genocide, telling the story of a mother of two, a Tutsi, who is working for a Belgian family in Kigali when the genocide begins. The family leave her behind and she has to save herself amongst the slaughter.

The film features a powerful performance from the lead Ruth Nirere in what is described as rich and immersive film, and judging from the trailer it's going to be a powerful and emotional film.
