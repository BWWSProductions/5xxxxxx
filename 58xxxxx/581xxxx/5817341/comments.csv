I thought it was a pretty well writen at the start and describe the Warsaw Ghetto to a kids point a view, nothing like it was really.   I dont really recomend this movie if your older then 15, I recomend the pianoist instead.  OH i stoped watching like 3/4s way through this film, i didnt want to even find out how stupid it gets in the end.  Sorry but the nazi's raped the jews and they didnt rape.  This is like pg 13 or soemthing gay"
