1080p?
no its not.
also choppy sounds and washed up imagery is not what the iron man 2 is suppose to be in true hd! @NLUPPER002 its not your fault but the encoders of this were noname russian group which failed on this poor release! im waiting for a chd or wiki release! thx for the upload bro but im gonna have to rate the quality -1"

@Quark1 WTF are u talking about ?????"
,pewpew,2010-09-10T20:21Z,@ak47bluntz: Protip: movies are not filmed in 16:9 aspect ratio.  Therefore publishing a movie in 16:9 HDTV formats requires either black bars or else cutting off the sides of the frame. So chill a little. 
,maturd,2010-09-10T21:25Z,"Since when 1920 x 816 is 1080p?!

here a hint; res 1920 x 1080!!! U SHITHEAD!!!"
,maturd,2010-09-10T21:33Z,"ak47bluntz is right. There is no black pixel row on a TRUE 1080p.

By the way, I don't remember the last time I laugh so hard after reading your comments. "
,muneeb.abbas3,2010-09-10T22:47Z,Maturd.. You fucking asshole.. you dont know shit. Some movies are not shot in 16:9. You wont get a 16:9 ratio of this movie.. even if u buy a BD.. It depends upon the choiceof camera lens by the director..  And plz stop fighting and tell about the quality ??
,xtero,2010-09-11T01:52Z,"1080p means that the picture is 1920 wide, the height depends on the aspect ratio. The same is true for 720p, it is 1280 wide and the height depends on aspect ratio. Most movies are not shot in 1.78:1, which means there will be black bars. A 2.35:1 ratio results in approximately 1920x816 picture. Got it?"
,ak47bluntz,2010-09-11T07:00Z,"oh right..... still not 1080p tho.... by my Standards I DONT GIVE A FUCK WHAT OTHERS SAY!!!

,muneeb.abbas3,2010-09-11T07:41Z,Try to understand mate... Its just a convention to write it 1080p. It depends upon the vertical lines. so 1920*816 is actually 1080p.
,TheChosen1_,2010-09-11T11:42Z,"There are too many negative votes.If you are gonna download this release, I guess you should think again."
,whackos,2010-09-11T14:24Z,"Bit rate : 6 078 Kbps.

Not good enough for 1080p. Should be over 10 000. I'll rather download the 720p version of roughly the same size. 

@ ak74bluntz: you are more than welcome to have your own standards, but most action and thriller movies are released with the 2.39:1 aspect ratio. If you are only going to watch ""true"" 1080p movies, you are stuck with dramas and comedies, but if thats your thing..."
,xtero,2010-09-11T23:41Z,"@ ak74bluntz, If you use Media Player Classic you can turn numlock on and then press number 9 to zoom in to get your ""true"" 1080p. Is that what you want?"

How to For Noobies:

(Does not work in MPC player, but does in VLC player(

unzip file to folder where you have your movie
then when playing movie in VLC click on video/subtitles track, then open file... you must locate where you saved the .srt file.

,ppywcps,2010-09-14T22:04Z,"To those poeple wanting a 'real' 1080p rip that's 1080 pixels high. I will personally pay each or you one million of your local currency if you find a copy of this movie that is 1080 pixels high that is:
1) Not upscaled in any way
2) Not cropped in any way

Try playing the real store-bought blu-ray on your computer (that has a blu-ray drive). You will find that the resolution of the video on that disk will be *drumroll* either 1920x816ish or 1920x1080 WITH BIG BLACK BARS TOP AND BOTTOM, that, when removed leave about 812 pixels hight."

,suisenbenjo,2010-09-17T02:16Z,"I can't believe all you dumbasses that don't understand what 1080p is.

Pristine 1920 pixel wide wide screen goodness. 

Note that the ultra-wides-screen movie 2.35:1 aspect ratio does not provide 1080 vertical pixels, because to do so would cut off the sides of the frame.

The dual audio tracks are the special treat, so that it works well with many players including the WD TV units that only support AC3 audio.

They are right, you CAN turn them OFF.

I played this in WMP (using codecs from the CCCP).
Under that scenario, I could NOT turn them off.

I loaded an old copy of VLC, and sure enough, I could turn them off with a simple right click.

Thanks so much for this file, and for the users for pointing me in the right direction.
