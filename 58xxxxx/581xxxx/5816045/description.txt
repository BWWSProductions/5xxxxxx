This show comes on E4. I am not sure when S03 start. I will do S02 and when S03 starts I will do it.

Basically, they just want to get laid. I love this show, its freaking hilarious!

I would say this is the British version of The Hard Times of RJ Berger.

Show Nfo - The Inbetweeners is a six-part series about four teenagers growing up in suburbia; a world of futile crushes, sibling brawls, getting drunk too quickly, fancying the girl next door, casting aspersions on your friend\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s sexuality and riding rollercoasters.

Will\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s (Simon Bird) parents have just divorced and he has unwillingly had to move area and change schools. Previously enrolled at a private school, where he picked up some snobbish tendencies, Will now attends a comprehensive school and has had to make a new set of friends, Simon (Joe Thomas), Lee (James Buckley) and Neil (Blake Harrison), none of whom are that cool or credible.

The Inbetweeners offers a comedic take on growing up in middle-class suburbia. A place where there are no teen pregnancies, no drugs, no knife fights and no guns. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s about a bunch of lads who get into real scrapes rather than real trouble.

Review - The Inbetweeners is a breath of fresh air to comedy programs, not over the top stupidity, nor do you have to be at all intellectual to find it funny, the plot revolves around 4 young students entering sixth form and follows there days as your average teenager, its the great mix of characters which makes this worth your time in watching as i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m sure most people can relate to one of the 4, based in the UK the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"average\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" group of friends find them selves in all sorts of awkward, embarrassing and often hilarious moments which all of us would have probably encountered sometime or another in our teen years,I hope to see more of these new actors in the future, this series is just what we needed, a comedy of the new generation.
