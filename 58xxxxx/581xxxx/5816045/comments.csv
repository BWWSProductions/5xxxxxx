[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-07T19:23Z,"@ Everyone - Sites Raids! Warning! I learned this from - Site Busts 07-09-10 READNFO-WARNiNG

If you don't know about the .eu site raids. You might want to read this!

Important Nfo Please read! - There has been some raids today in .eu many sites got busted, confirmed sites that got hit: BAR LOST SC

Police in up to 14 countries around Europe have coordinated to carry out raids against suspected file-sharing servers this morning. Locations in The Netherlands, Czech Republic and Hungary were targeted but Sweden appears to have borne the brunt of the action. Seven locations including PRQ, which hosts WikiLeaks, have been raided.
This morning news is coming in which indicates that very significant raids against illicit file-sharing are taking place in locations across Europe.
Police in up to 14 European countries are said to be involved in an operation, said to be in the planning for two years, targeting the Warez Scene, the network of individuals and servers at the top of the so-called â€˜Piracy Pyramidâ€™.
Details are scarce at the moment, but it is believed that at the behest of Belgian authorities, raids have gone ahead in The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Germany, Great Britain, Czech Republic, Hungary and Sweden.
Not unusually, Sweden appears to have borne the brunt of the activity with a total of seven locations raided including Stockholm, MalmÃ¶, UmeÃ¥, Eskilstuna and Solna.
Armed with IP addresses, this morning police officers turned up at the Solna premises of PRQ, the company that in part hosts WikiLeaks.There is no suggestion that the controversial whistle-blowing site is connected to the operation.
â€œAt 9:00 this morning, five policemen were here,â€ explained PRQâ€™s Mikael Viberg. â€œThey were interested in who were using two IP addresses from 2009 and onwards. We have no records of our clients but weâ€™re handing over the e-mail addresses for those behind the IPs. However, itâ€™s rare that our clients have mail addresses that are traceable.â€
This is a breaking news story and will be updated.
Update: Swedish Prosecutor Frederick Ingblad told Swedish news outlet Expressen.se, â€œI can confirm that [this operation] is not about Wikileaks.â€
Update 2: Thus far, four people are said to be being questioned on suspicion of breaching copyright law. Servers and computers have been seized in Sweden.
Update 3:Police raided the UmeÃ¥ University.

,nhprm,2010-09-08T01:37Z,"@one burnt - who the fuck are you? And, why are you on the pirate bay to complain about the illegitimate rights of the MPAA/RIAA?




This show is, in a word, ""Brilliant."""
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-08T03:06Z,"@ nhprm - One_Burnt_Potato was just concerned about me, and was wondering why I take the risk of doing this, when I know that it could get me into trouble.  
Also yes this show is brilliant and I love it, cuz it is funny as hell just like The Hard Times of RJ Berger.   (^_^) 

@ One_Burnt_Potato - I do this because I love you guys and gals, cuz you all are a part of my online family / friends. I enjoy sharing stuff that I like with you guys. I want give ck to the online community. I am a guy, I enjoy doing crazy, dangerous, and sometimes risky things, cuz it gives me a rush. Cuz I like to live life on the edge and takes chances, but I do take some extreme precautions when doing this. (^_*)"
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-08T03:07Z,Typo = I want give something back to the online community.
