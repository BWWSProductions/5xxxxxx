Thorhammer2000 thx"
,melloyello33,2010-09-08T12:27Z,"Still stuck at 97.5 %. Could you please, Thorhammer2000, seed it a few more? It just needs one to complete the download. The rest will complete right after that.

Thanks mate!!"
,thorhammer2000,2010-09-17T19:27Z,"Sorry if there's a problem with this - I always seed from 00:00 - 08:00 GMT every night, all of ""my"" torrents are still seeding and 123 MB has been uploaded on this torrent. I presume this torrent is OK now?"
,thorhammer2000,2010-09-17T21:39Z,I've now fixed this torrent and changed some settings so it shouldn't happen again!
