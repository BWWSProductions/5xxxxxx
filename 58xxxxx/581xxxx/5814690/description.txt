Blackfoot's 1975 debut, No Reservations (named in reference
to their Native American bloodlines), had been a critical
and commercial bust for their indifferent label, Island
Records, so after being cut loose from their contract, the
resourceful Southern rock group immediately hooked up with
the more rock-friendly Epic Records, for the release of
their second long-player, Flyin' High, the very next year.
The bottom line was that Blackfoot were also still seeking
their songwriting groove on their way to establishing the
heavier style of Southern rock that would eventually
distinguish them from Skynyrd and all of their clones. And
yet a handful of these tracks - "Save Your Time," "Island
of Life," the title cut - pass muster by Blackfoot's future
high standards, and in retrospect, there's no telling what
proper promotional support could have done for Flyin' High
(after all, Blackfoot on a bad day still beat hell out of
the competition). But the album was roundly ignored by
consumers, saw the group dropped for the second year
straight, and would join its predecessor in cutout bins,
languishing out of print for decades on end. By the time
Blackfoot made a comeback with 1979's watershed Strikes LP,
many new fans simply assumed that this was actually the
group's first release, rather than a case of well-deserved
third time lucky.
