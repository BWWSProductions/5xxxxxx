Hello and thanks for downloading my torrent.

Once this torrent was created it was out of date as MS release updates constantly.
This torrent allows you to have a base to just download the small weekly updates needed to bring you up to date.

I have not included any Virus's or Trojans, I have scanned all files with F-Secure Client Security and NOD32 ESS.


I have included all the AutoPatcher elements from the current version APUP 1.3.0.1

Some older releases have been retired, but I have includeded them to complete the archive.


APUP was run Sunday 5th September 2010 at 09:00 GMT

The files where then compressed using 7zip.
Goto www.7-zip.org if your usual program will not open .7z files.


If you find this torrent useful please post on TPB.

I will be seeding on 100mb Dedicated Server using uTorrent 2.0.4 with Encryption & PeerBlock Blocklists,
so if you do not see a seed do not worry I am there!

I have split the releases into their own archives so you can download just what you want.

When you download these, un-7Zip to drive with 8GB free space, then run APUP, select relevant element
and update your version of AutoPatcher.

See ReadMe.txt file in each folder for selections.

Please support the guys at www.PeerBlock.com, Blocking for Windows Vista/Windows 7 etc. - Great Job guys.
Then goto www.iBlockList.com and select lists.
Please consider donating to these sites to keep the projects alive.

Please seed, if a few weeks I will upload files to http://ap.snowmanuk.net for http downloads if required.

Thanks
