\\\"The Country Teasers would eventually win audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. Crypt was the first label responsible for the group\\\'s American exposure, thanks to distribution of a self-titled 1995 ten-inch. The album Satan Is Real Again was released the following year. After 1997\\\'s Anytime Cowboy EP, the Teasers moved to Fat Possum/Epitaph and released 1999\\\'s Destroy All Human Life. Science Hat Artistic Cube Moral Nosebleed Empire came in 2002 -- a double LP released by In the Red, it compiled material dating back to the early \\\'90s. The group\\\'s relationship with In the Red continued in 2003, with the release of Secret Weapon Revealed at Last.\\\"
