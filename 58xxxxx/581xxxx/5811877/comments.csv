Would you (or someone with a full download) seed the left part?"
,Wieb,2010-10-06T22:52Z,"Awesome torrent! But I unfortunately got the same problem here, it stops at 96,3%. "
,Suba23,2010-10-26T01:09Z,1 seeder would make my day :)...thnx...I swear to God I'll seed it for 6 months :D
,KingKarat,2011-02-20T15:22Z,"Yeah, same for me. I've been stuck at 96,3% since 2 weeks and nobody's seeding. Somebody, please? This is really annoying."
,Driver097,2011-03-30T13:28Z,No seeders?! Fuck you!
