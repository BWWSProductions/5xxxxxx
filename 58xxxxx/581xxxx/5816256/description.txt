FreeDroidRPG features a complete real time combat system with melee and ranged weapons, fairly similar 
to the proprietary game Diablo. There also is an innovative system of magic, 
with features such as forced casting and over 20 spells.
You can use over 50 different kinds of items and fight countless enemies on your way to your destiny.
We have an advanced dialogue system, which aims at being at least on par with Fallout's. 
The dialogues in the game represent a large part of the gameplay.
Finally, if guns are too inaccurate and blades too messy, you can always take over your enemies 
and have them fight on your side.
