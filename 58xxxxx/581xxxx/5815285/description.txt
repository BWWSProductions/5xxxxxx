           After skidding off the road in the dead of night, four         
           friends find themselves lost in the forest and tangled in      
           a twisted love story. As they are each picked off one by       
           one by a bizarre beast it becomes clear that none of them      
           will make it out of this forest alive; unless the one the      
           monster so desires is left behind. Will they stick             
           together and find their way out of the grips of this love      
           sick monster or will they turn on each other and perish        
           in this dark fairytale?
