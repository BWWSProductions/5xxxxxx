The second storyline in the the Locke & Key saga written by acclaimed suspense novelist and New York Times best-selling author Joe Hill (Heart-Shaped Box) and artwork from Gabriel Rodriguez (Clive Barker's The Great And Secret Show, CSI).

Following a shocking death that dredges up memories of their father's murder, Kinsey and Tyler Locke are thrown into choppy emotional waters, and turn to their new friend, Zack Wells, for support, little suspecting Zack's dark secret. Meanwhile, six-year-old Bode Locke tries to puzzle out the secret of the head key, and Uncle Duncan is jarred into the past by a disturbingly familiar face. 

Also contains Locke & Key: Welcome to Lovecraft, Special Edition and Locke & Key: Welcome to Lovecraft, Legacy Edition.  
The Special Edition reprints the sellout debut issue of the first mini-series, Locke & Key: Welcome to Lovecraft and includes the script by Hill and an all-new 11-page story, â€œFreddie Wertham Goes to Hell,â€ written by Hill and drawn by the late Seth Fisher and presented in color here for the very first time. 
The Legacy Edition is an extra-length edition of the first Locke & Key issue containing the original 32-page story, as well as an 8-page recap of where the series has gone before.
