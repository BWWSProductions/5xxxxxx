,ghsodt,2010-09-20T02:04Z,"Hi, I'm seeding now. Sorry I wasn't before - it seemed to be broken so I had given up. But today (sept 19) there seems to be leachers so maybe is now working? I don't know which version - this torrent or the other (I tried the same thing twice) - is actually working so try both to see which connects. I will be seeding and leave my computer on now that I know it works. Please be patient and reseed so we can get this torrent out there finally. Thanks."
