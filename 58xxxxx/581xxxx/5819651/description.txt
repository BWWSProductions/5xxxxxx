Gordon Neufeld, author of:
Hold On to Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers by Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Mate M.D

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold_on_to_Your_Kids_%28book%29

This book is about the pivotal importance of children's relationships to those responsible for them and the devastating impact in today's society of competing attachments with peers. However it is much more than a book on peer orientation: it is about parenting with relationship in mind. This book restores parents to their natural intuition, confronting such relationship devastating devices as time-outs and using what children care about against them. Offering effective strategies for preserving and restoring the child-to-parent relationship, this book provides refreshing natural alternatives to today's contrived methods of behaviour control. The content is relevant to parents of children of any age, from infants right through to adult children. Readers have commonly commented on how much hardship and confusion they could have avoided had this material been available to them right from the beginning.

This book was first released in Canada where it became a bestseller within weeks. It is now available in the US and several other languages including French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese (Brazil), Hebrew, Swedish, Norwegian and Korean.


'Dr. Neufeld's approach has the power to change, if not save, the lives of our children.'

Common Challenges (Power to Parent Part III) - an eight-session videocourse

Raising children is rewarding, but not always easy! Every child gets stuck from time to time on the road to maturation and every parent faces challenges at some point on the journey. At these times, we could benefit from experienced insight and practical suggestions that are in the best interest of our children. In this third part of the Power to Parent series, Dr. Neufeld helps equip parents to read the signs of a child in trouble, live with a sensitive child, cultivate resilience in a child, lead an alpha child, soften a defended child, discipline a stuck child, and more. Dr. Neufeld offers effective and safe practices that honor and preserve the relationship, even when the problems seem daunting. In making sense of a child's experience, parents are better prepared to lead them through challenging times.

DVD Ripped on Ubuntu 10.04LTS Lucid Lynx
tried to use k3b, Acidrip, DVD:Rip, and Nero Linux but none properly would read the disc even though it isn't encrypted! So I ended up using Acidrip as a guide to just do it on the command line with mencoder. I've compressed the files quite a lot to save space and because you don't need high resolution for something like this lecture style video.
