[V],thethingy,2010-09-05T15:29Z,this is cs5 training
,likishru,2010-09-29T17:49Z,"Hey thethingy, thanks for this upload!
I know this'll sound stupid, but does this help me learn how to use flash cs5? That is, if I'm a total dummy at flash?
And one more, is this an Adobe release? Or made by someone else?
Just asked, thanks for the great upload anyway! And yeah, almost all the programs I use, right from the OS (Windows 7 Ultimate) to the utilities, are your uploads! Owe my entire running PC to you, pal...!"
[V],manOtor,2010-10-09T23:28Z,"Maybe I can answer that one:
YES! If you are a total dummy at flash, this introduces the program from the start.
If you can't get it from there you probably should do something other than flash..., or computers in general.
And second it's not an Adobe product - like Lynda.com, Total Training specialices in e-learning for all kinds of things - hell, there might be even a lecture on how to shit ;)!"

,Helixdisc,2011-08-23T07:53Z,If you download the premium suite from the thingy there is the directions to manipulate your host file to make it (adobe) products free forever and if you do it right then you can download updates.
