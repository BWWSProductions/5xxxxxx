- Ceux du Dehors (1981) -

This is the 3rd studioalbum by the Belgian avant prog band and the first without guitarist and founding member Roger Trigaux, who had left to form his own group, Present.
The album represents a transition from the earlier thick and dark Bartok influenced chamber sound to the later jazzier and keyboard-tinged music.
In any case, CEUX DU DEHORS is one of U.Z.s greatest work.
