Scandal was formed in New York in 1981. They are best remembered for the hit \"The Warrior\" from 1984 which was written by Nick Gilder and Holly Knight.

This CD was released as part of VH-1\'s \"We Are The 80s\" series. This proved to be a very interesting release for Scandal fans, as it is more than just an average compilation for these reasons:

1. The entire Scandal EP from 1982 is presented here on CD for the first time.Tracks 1, 2, 4, 5 & 6 make up the EP in its original running order, unfortunately interrupted by \"The Warrior\" probably due to the CD producer wanting familiar songs up front.

2. Also for the first time on CD, \"All My Life\" which was originally a B-Side to the \"Goodbye To You\" single.

3. Tracks 12, 13 & 14 are never before released from the EP recording sessions.

4. The remaining tracks are from 1984\'s \"The Warrior\" and include the hits \"The Warrior\", \"Hands Tied\" and \"Beat Of A Heart\" from that album.
