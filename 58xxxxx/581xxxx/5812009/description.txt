This episode was the first to be hosted by Revolution Broadcasting, in which we covered the case of Christopher Pittman, antidepressant violence, and corruption within the pharmaceutical and justice systems. We also discussed the unwarranted hysteria around S.510, America's endangered symbol (the bald eagle), the upcoming FDA decision on GMO salmon, the dangers of energy-efficient light bulbs, eugenics-style sterilization for healthy women, and the exploitation of the egg contamination by the chemical industry.
