dont forget aXXo guys, in 700 mb he used to give us what many morons cant give in 1.5 gb. 
its called talent.
anyways, in absence of aXXo(wish he returns soon) FXG, raymondhome,.bone, MXMG are doing great jobs. can rate the a/v w/o watching the movie. a=10 v1=10"
,ramikaz,2011-08-10T20:01Z,Thanks for a 700 MB version.
,michaelrwatson,2011-11-20T01:38Z,"Yeah, er, wait, it's actually 702 MB and doesn't *quite* fit on a CD, you inbred fucktard."
,michaelrwatson,2011-12-16T04:05Z,"Oh wow, this is worse than I thought--IT IS WATERMARKED periodically with MXMG's logo and website URL (or some such crap). Can you fucking believe that? 

Hey mxmg, do you expect people to stop while they're watching the movie and go visit your website..? Or maybe pause the movie and write it down so they can visit it later..?

You are first class morons.
