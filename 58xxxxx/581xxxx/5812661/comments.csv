So, if anyone knows of a way to bypass this shit, pls send me an email to diasvld@mail2dude.com. Sorry again...i will keep uploading,and be sure i will keep seeding until there are at least 20 seeds in each torrent. PEACE!"

What ISP are you using?"
,Josha5000,2010-09-05T23:23Z,"I miss the edit-button:

You can also try to put your torrent client on port ... lets say 21 (if you don't use a ftp server at home).

Not sure if it works, but if ISP is only checking the ports it will do fine."
[V],dias_vld,2010-09-06T00:31Z,"MAn, send me an email so i can reply you on a more discret manner, ok? :) cheers!"
[V],dias_vld,2010-09-06T02:21Z,"again, send that email to diasvld@mail2dude.com. Cheers!!"
