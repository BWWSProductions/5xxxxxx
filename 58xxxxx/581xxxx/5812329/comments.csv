,SD_rocks,2010-09-06T12:39Z,@invader: i am facing the same problem. its just that k-lite codec pack doesn't support subtitling in .mp4 extensions. i dont know whats the reason. as pluto suggested u can use vlc but the quality is never as great as in k-lite...
,pri_246302rocks,2010-09-06T15:10Z,"@iinvader123  & SD_rocks :

If you are using Windows 7 and have problems with subtitles for mp4 in WMP ! Try this :

>> Install K-Lite Codecs from:
http://www.codecguide.co/download_kl.htm 
>> Download this file:
http://www.download.hr/software-filter-tweaker-for-windows-7.html
>> Run as administrator
>> Select ffdshow (DXVA) for H.264
>> Select Apply
>> In the very next page select mp4 
      (To disable media foundation for mp4)
>> In the next page select:
      Disable Mpeg4s Decoder DMO
      Disable Mpeg43 Decoder DMO
      Disable Media Foundation


Hope this works for you guys ;) It worked for me :)"

The source looks like it was an R5 bootleg. 
It's not good quality, I've seen better in this size.
