Cal Tjader developed a thirst for Latin Music that became unquenchable when he discovered El Sonido Nuevo (The New Sound) of Afro-Cuban Jazz on the streets of New York City. He played with some of the all time greats through out his career, and from the founding of his Modern Mambo Quartet in 1954, to his death in 1982, he helped launch the careers of numerous musicians. His music continues to inspire, and have impact on the evolution of Latin music in the US. 
The 16 tracks presented here are some mighty fine recordings, featuring Cal Tjader on vibes throughout. "Manteca" becomes a sexy weaving of melodies between the flute and vibes, adding depth to this modern classic. "Soul Burst" features an explosion of percussion by congas, timbales and more--while Tito Puente's "Picadillo" is rendered superbly as well. 

Not a bad track on the CD, and you will have fun recognizing some of the 60's classic jazz performers that have joined in, including Chick Corea, Donald Byrd, Willie Bobo, and more. ~ Edward Alexander Gerster "miamibooks" ~ Miamibooks
