,boe2,2010-09-05T13:43Z,"Looking good this time, thanks :)"
,napptunes,2010-09-05T19:40Z,"thank you so much one more time.
if you bought them from itunes, could you please post the artwork of the show ?
thank you in advance."
,cliohcraven,2010-09-07T05:13Z,"definitely worth the initial confusion, thank you"
,DGKnight,2010-09-12T22:10Z,How hard would it be to get all of these uploaded with each half-episode in separate files?

,Chouonsoku,2010-09-14T06:58Z,"It wouldn't be too hard to split them, I suppose. Maybe when the season is finished I'll upload a pack that's split instead of in the iTunes format if there's demand for it."
,DGKnight,2010-09-14T20:37Z,"I have split the first few and removed intro and credits to make using them in XBMC less of a hassle. I'm just thinking there are probably several people that are in the same position and don't have the time to do it themselves.

If this could be done you'd be my hero. "
,Chouonsoku,2010-10-02T19:46Z,"Well, if it's for XBMC (I'm using it too) you can use a program like Media Companion to basically combine the episode info for the two parts into the same format I have the episodes in now. It'll output the video scrape info into an NFO file that XBMC will read from. I can upload the NFO files with the next torrent for XBMC users."
,Barboron,2010-10-09T00:03Z,Will you be uploading episodes 12 and 13? The rest have been really great quality!
,figrindan,2010-11-08T23:09Z,"Thank you for all of your mathmatical Adventure Time uploads!!!
P.S. We miss you, Chouonsoku.   :("
,thespace101,2010-12-15T01:30Z,Chouonsoku where are you????
,sweaterpuppies1,2011-01-30T21:13Z,we miss you ;-;
