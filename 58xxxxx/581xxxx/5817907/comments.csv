* It has hardcoded subs for the Chinese parts.
* No scenes are missing.

@ Coolum, almost every new piece of media (games, videos, music, programs) is being watched.  If they are watching one version of this movie that are essentially watching all. Protect yourself and block IPs.


Jackie Chan plays his part extremely well as usual.
He plays the part of this funny, serious Kung Fu trainer. As usual, he likes to mix those two parts up together, providing and interesting role for him.

Jaden Smith, as young as he is, plays a great part as well. I see a decent start to his career.

Best thing I can say is, do not analyze the hell out of this movie. Watch it and enjoy. Not every film is going to be a box office hit. If you like some Kung Fu, Jackie Chan, a bit of humor, and a pretty good story. Then watch this film. If you do not really care for at least most of those attributes that I named off, then do not bother watching this film, because you will just be on here a bit afterwards complaining at how bad 'you' thought the movie was. 

                                    Thank you,

                                           Mr. 320"

,vidwyz,2010-10-16T20:17Z,Why does this have a runtime of only 134 minutes? IMDb says the runtime is 140 minutes.
,TheTsel,2010-10-19T23:58Z,"BE CAREFUL! 

I got a call from my ISP about a Copyright Infringement Notice the other day. "
,KiraNL,2010-10-20T16:25Z,"Downloading now.

btw @TheTsel
I am happy that downloading copyrighted material is legal in here, fuck the ISP's lol."
,TheTsel,2010-10-21T03:09Z,"@KiraNL 
Haha, my ISP didn't even care, they were only calling because they had to. The letter they forwarded us was pretty lulzy too.

On the topic of this movie, the quality is outstanding."

,danialjaveed,2010-11-08T13:10Z,Thanks!!
,theRealKarmine,2010-11-08T14:23Z,what they watch for is people who release.  if they would sue downloaders then theyd have to sue 75% of the world.  theyd get a bullet in the head.

,donedson,2010-12-22T07:13Z,I downloaded PeerBlock and I blocked P2P. But da movie downloads r also blocked. How do I fix that? Download movies and yet block my IP address. Thx..
,squigglesklok,2011-02-01T04:14Z,Great upload and fast too! I'm a big Will Smith fan and his kid is a pretty weird kooky actor! Good to see Jackie Chan in a more serious straight role too! Thaaanks scenebalance!
,kraziaznvtboi,2011-04-18T10:19Z,"I'm only speculating, but if the companies do sue the downloaders they would sue specific ones.

They'd track someone who would download quite a lot of copyrighted material and when they feel like its enough for a case, they take that specific individual and make an example out of them or something.

I dunno, just a guess."
,ronny12507,2011-05-01T06:03Z,thanks for the info on peer block
