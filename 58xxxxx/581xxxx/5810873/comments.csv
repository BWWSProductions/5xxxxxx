When it asked for a serial:
PAT4-F3V48-HTQ63-X6Q25-GRAW2"
,xort999,2010-09-04T21:38Z,"Even better, the game is in russian, so maybe you need to change some more files to get english menus."
,xort999,2010-09-04T21:47Z,"Ok the file you need is the options.ini it hides out in different places on different versions of windows. Use the run command, (winkey+r) and type in %appdata% this will open the correct location. Go down to Kalypso Media then inside. Open up the options file and change the language setting to:

Language = enUS"
,Dimmis80,2010-09-05T00:13Z,Hi guys.@xort999 it tried the solution u wrote but it wont work.I installed the game and then i run the crack-fix then i deactivate my firewall but when it asked for a serial key your serial key dont work dude.!It says invalid key.And in my App data folder where there are 3 folders Roaming-LocalLow-Local there is not anywhere the Kalypso Media folder.!!So any other solution or any advise how to make it work.?(I even turn of my internet connection but it wont work either).

No internet connections when you star to play [can connect to internet when playing the game. by hit some key, to go back to desktop]
Change the language to English in options.ini, locted under users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\Kalypso Media\Patrician 4
 Language = enUS   [change to enUS save]
Play the game in english but the audio is not in English ok

,ravenlingat,2010-09-07T12:10Z,no help here?
[T],Knaster,2010-09-07T16:26Z,ravenlingat update your directx or graphic card drivers.............................
,ravenlingat,2010-09-09T13:13Z,i dont get it. -_-
,devsrex,2010-09-09T16:48Z,"i managed to install it but i get a blank screen, the cursor tho is like the plume and i hear the music including what sounds like the company's avi intro. i updated the driver, you think having directx 11 has something to do with it?"
,BigD145,2010-09-10T05:30Z,I'll wait on a proper English release.
,warrat,2010-09-10T14:44Z,"maybe i'm stupid but after setup i got only 8 files without crackfix.When i try to start the game its always saying can't find D3DX9-42.DLL

Maybe someone can help me"
,BigD145,2010-09-10T20:07Z,You have to update your DirectX files. Is there a DirectX folder in this install? Use that.
,loempieja,2010-09-11T10:34Z,"Here's how I got it running. Before trying this download, I tried Patrician.4.Full.RiP-JoeKkerr first. This one doesn't work (key not accepted), but it did contain the DirectX update that this game needs (had the D3DX9-42.DLL issue as well, but after updating directx that issue was resolved). 
1) I downloaded this torrent. Then ran the Patrician IV ALI213.exe file. 
2)After the installation was done, I disabled my internet connection and started the game. 
3) Fill out the key (works well)
4) exit the game, and navigate to the options file like mentioned before and change the language.
5) Start the game and you can play.

Note that I did NOT install any chinese crack, it's running fine on my computer without it, also the crack just contains a inet link.

Other note, the language used in the game is GERMAN not Russian. But the context menus are switched to English when changing the language option."
,wroobel,2010-09-13T16:15Z,"Does anyone have problem with screen being partially covered with blue colour ? Problem still exists after updating directx and catalyst, only way I found to make it disappear is to set all details to very low but... come on, there must be another way."
,BigD145,2010-09-13T20:10Z,Update your video card drivers.
,wroobel,2010-09-14T15:17Z,they're updated
,xristoffer,2010-09-14T16:46Z,"After i did the crackfix my game changed to english version. I did not need to change any file, just runned the crackfix in my gamemap on the computer."

,alpakal,2011-02-07T17:35Z,"Does anyone have crack for version 1.3 (release date about 2010-12-17)? 
It could be great, because this version fixs many bugs. Download page for pure patch e.g. http://games.softpedia.com/get/Patch/Patrician-IV-Patch.shtml."
