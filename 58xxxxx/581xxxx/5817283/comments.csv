Every TV made since the introduction of colour can display better than 480p
None HD CRT TV's display 800x600 so as this is only this is 720x304 it's not even decent SD Quality"

,Jack_Raiden,2010-09-08T15:33Z,5.1 AC3 audio at 192 Kbps! Wow! (I didn't think ViSiON would fail this hard again!)
,Jack_Raiden,2010-09-08T15:37Z,"Apologies, this is ViSiON's better BRRip (with proper bitrate/size, 5.1 AC3 at 448 Kbps), not one their embarassing X264 releases. (Don't hurt me!)"
