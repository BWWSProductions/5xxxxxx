,opensociety,2010-09-05T23:21Z,"WHAT do you mean, Softwarez?!

The idea behind this site is to spread information, e.g. movies. Steal? B-s!
The more spreading the merrier, more people get access, THAT is the idea!!!

,metrOjedi,2010-09-06T07:51Z,"Terrible film.  OMG what the fuck is the movie industry on!?!?  The cocaine/alcohol days are back.  B movies are a dime a dozen now.  Their is no creativity in movies anymore.  They all need to try Ayahuasca, DMT, Psilocybin, and at LEAST for the love of humanity, LSD, Mescalin, Herbs...
I miss the days of crappy VHS films but, this is just, awful..... I also miss good films... that use thought, brain power...
Anyway thanks for the re-up/hash... I don't mind experiencing the mundane.  Helps me grow.

,CokeInMyNose,2010-09-06T11:56Z,"@metrOjedi Steven Seagal is in the fucking movie. What did you expect? Go watch inception if you want a good movie.

Thanks for the upload"
,luis23679,2010-09-06T18:09Z,so the audio is fixed then
,lilars26,2010-09-06T18:27Z,The only Seagal movies I like are the ones where he gets killed off.
,horsse,2010-09-06T18:38Z,"A2 V3, pretty bad even for a cam. 
Watchable for the really desperate."
,Mackmidnight,2010-09-09T01:06Z,Worst movie ever!!! I went to the movies and seen this bullshit!! and walked out i cant believe that they put this in the theaters!! its a C movie at best!! something thats in the bottom of the movie bin in walmart you buy for 1.50$ its that bad!! 
,thoughtcriminalz,2010-09-09T06:29Z,"not the best quality torrent. Dont understand the bad reviews, umm this movie isnt Inception but its not supposed to be. For what it is, an exploitation flick, its hilarious and very well done. If you hate directors like Quentin Tarantino you won't like it. If you understand its not supposed to be a ""serious"" cut and dried movie then you'll dig it. It's awesome."
,thunga,2010-09-09T13:11Z,Thanks for the upload.
,Mackmidnight,2010-09-11T10:09Z,"i went in with the same concept ""dont take this movie seriously"" but it was just sooooooo far fetched it was comical!! he rappelled from a mans intestine.............that did it for me I told the wife lets get the fuck out of this shit movie...  "
