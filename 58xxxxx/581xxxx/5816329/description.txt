This dvd was included with a three disc set i purchased.  John Leguizamo's FREAK was the main title in triple pack.

I have already released FREAK on the pirate bay (http://thepiratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3284560).  The 

third dvd in the triple pack was labeled as a bonus dvd and is a show called "BRAVO Profiles" which this episode

is about John Leguizamo.  this bonus dvd will be released on the pirate bay soon. but enough about the other discs!

John Leguizamo's Mambo Mouth [1991] - http://imdb.com/title/tt0247497/



(taken from imdb.com)

 MAMBO MOUTH is profane, scathing, blunt, and brutally honest. It is also one of the best stand up performances 

ever devised. I had the opportunity to see MAMBO MOUTH on television when I was a kid and it was the first time 

I was introduced to John Leguizambo. Very few people know about his history as a playwright before his various 

acting performances in film. MAMBO MOUTH is based on his won Obie award-winning play. Throughout the performance, 

he depicts various character stereotypes (including a woman) in his own unique, and very funny way. An excellent 

performance!
