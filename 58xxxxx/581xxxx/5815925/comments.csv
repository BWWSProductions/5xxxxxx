,lpunderg,2010-09-29T08:57Z,"I have reinstalled PES 2010 about three times and followed the instructions of the patch, but I'm still getting wrong logos, wrong team names, dummy players and a whole bunch of other stuff. Also when I installed PES there was no save folder to put ES2010_EDIT01.bin into so I just grabbed the entire folder from the patch and put it on the pes folder. PLEASE HELP ME!!!!"
