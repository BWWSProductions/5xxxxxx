Your plain-English guide to advanced physics 
Does just thinking about magnetism make your head spin? Thanks to this book, you don't have to be Einstein to understand physics. It walks you through the essentials and gives you easy-to-understand and digestible information on this often-intimidating course. From sound and light waves to electric potential and electric energy, this no-nonsense guide makes this fascinating topic accessible to everyone. 

Physics II 101 â€” get a crash course on the main topics covered in a typical Physics II course and brush up on basic skills, like making conversions and working with scientific notation 

Get charged up â€” understand the role of electricity and magnetism in Physics II, from AC circuits to permanent magnets to magnetic fields 

Ride the wave â€” learn how light waves interact and interfere with each other and how they bounce off things, pass through glass, and do all sorts of cool stuff 

Go exploring â€” take a look at the theory of special relativity and learn what Einstein (among other physicists) had to say about it
