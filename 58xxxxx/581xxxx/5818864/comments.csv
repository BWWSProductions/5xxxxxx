Setting post processing to 6 in VLC helps ... but i have other star trek vidz, smaller file size and bitrate, same resolution, which do not suffer these symptoms, and are perfect to watch without VLC post processing ... 

I'm going to try download a better conversion of this movie"

Its just my preference .. i know it can look far nicer and sharper, and still result in smaller filesize"
