              The archetypical renegade Texas Ranger          
               wages war against a drug kingpin with           
               automatic weapons, his wits and martial         
               arts after a gun battle leaves his partner     
                 dead. All of this inevitably culminates a       
                 martial arts showdown between the drug          
                lord and the ranger, and involving the          
                woman they both love.
