This collection of music was written and sung by Joel Thibodeau. It is unlike anything youâ€™ve ever heard. People will call it many things. Few will get it right. This is Death Vessel.

Death Vesselâ€™s debut album Stay Close was released in 2005 to critical acclaim. Since that albumâ€™s release Death Vessel has toured with Iron & Wine, Low, Jose Gonzalez, and The Books, among others. Recorded with longtime producer/collaborator Pete Donnelly (The Figgs) at his New Jersey studio, and various locales across the northeast, Nothing Is Precious Enough for Us is Death Vesselâ€™s Sub Pop debut. While in recent years Joel has toured primarily as a solo performer, and the songs are inarguably mesmerizing and relevant in that setting, on record they take on a new life, thanks to his and Donnellyâ€™s inspired, and often unusual, arrangements, and the contributions of numerous friends and players. The album exudes a unique, wide-scope ambition. Its musical reach is fully extendedâ€”-deep into the past, grounded in the present and nodding to the future. Owing to the gritty avarice of Joelâ€™s singular spirit, voice and musicality, the songs sound as progressive, experimental and modern as they do antique and old-world. The music is haunting and spiritual, mysterious and kind, ageless and contemporary, soulful and psychedelic. In short, itâ€™s where the requiem meets rock â€˜nâ€™ roll.

â€œNow I am versed in silence/my throat hurts, not from yelling but from holding back,â€ Joel sings on â€œBlock My Eye,â€ the albumâ€™s opening track. And thatâ€™s ok, because the music speaks for itself. And nothing ever sounded so loud, and so clear.
