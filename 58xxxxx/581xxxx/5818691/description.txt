Product description:

Gibraltar is a special place. Itâ€™s a bit of Great Britain on the Iberian peninsula with an amazing geography. When you look at the map you understand why Great Britain wanted to keep hold of it. Amazing high detailed VFR scenery of Gibraltar including the airport and Upper Rock. Real holiday feeling for FSX!

Details:

Before the Suez canal there was no other access to the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. One guy with a binocular could see what was going in and out. Even today this is a strategic advantage of immense value. Approaching the airport from either side is a strange sensation with the huge mountain (The Rock) and the runway stretching out into the sea. Itâ€™s a great place to visit, both in the real world as it is in this remarkable rendering for FSX.

Gibraltar Airport has the distinction of being the closest airport to the city that it serves, being only 500 meter from Gibraltar`s city centre. The main road intersects the airport runway, so consequently has to be closed every time a plane lands or departs.

The airport and its surroundings are built up to the smallest of detail. This is a total rebuild of the whole island and the airport. All buildings, lighting systems, navigation beacons have been modeled to the smallest of details including all buildings and airport institutions.
