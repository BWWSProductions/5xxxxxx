Win32/Heur found in BayGenie.exe


...care to explain?"
,sikth13,2010-10-27T20:55Z,"found win32/heur 

Win32/Heur, also mentioned as Virus Win32 Heur is a dangerous self-mutating polymorphic trojan , typically installed on windows system without victims knowledge. The Win32/Heur virus infects PC's via dubious filesharing applications, corrupt media files, spam emails and porn related web sites. Once infected, Win32/Heur virus will modify Windows win32 system files, and install additional trojans, worms and viruses onto the infected computer. The Win32/Heur trojan is usually detected with the ""Virus found Win32/Heur"" alert and may activate fake Dr. Watson security warnings and redirect Internet Explorer and FireFox browsers to sites like ripetv.com or crackle.com"

,teikyo30,2011-03-16T08:37Z,"Out of curiosity because of what the others wrote I scanned it with Avast! and it found: nothing! Then I scanned it with Avira, and it also found nothing. Then I scanned it with Antimalware, and it found nothing. In my opinion the file is completely safe. "

Also, I scanned this with F-Secure, a v.expensive anti-virus application we use across our organisation...no virus...so do not be fooled by crap anti-virus software ...this works just fine...follow the instructions before you start complaining it doesn't work"
,dzldriver,2011-08-03T21:26Z,"I am not able to get this one to work.  When I do all the steps described in the .nfo file, and then try to start the software, I get a window that says ""Can not create empty file""

Anyone else getting the same stuff??"

,aguila9,2011-08-29T01:46Z,"U fucking mongoloid retards!

 Every illegal software you download especially if it has a crack will cause a false virus detection...
who cares!


get over it..."
,aguila9,2011-08-29T01:49Z,"Especially if your stupid enough to pay and use a commercial virus detector like AVG, Norton, etc...

Ah, you ignorant retards with with your moronic worries and posts!!!!

,Cyber1982,2012-01-28T18:59Z,"Ok Maybe it didn't use to have a virus, but it def does now, ive used pirate bay for years now and this is the first time ive ever had a virus get thru onto my computer, i downloaded this file, the second it stopped downloading and started to seed i got error message after error message, corrupt hard drive file, corrupt windows system 32 file, a program is hidden in this one and it just ate my harddrive, its a new laptop and now i have to reformat and possible buy a new hard drive, nothing else was downloaded so I am 100% certain it was because of this one, thanks a lot, i guess all the money pirate bay has saved me finally caught up to me"

[M],Gargravar,2012-01-29T09:15Z,"If you did get those error before you RAN this program how is the virus supposed to have been started?
