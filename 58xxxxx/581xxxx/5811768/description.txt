Book Description
================
Widely acclaimed for his work completing Robert Jordanâ€™s Wheel of Time
saga, Brandon Sanderson now begins a grand cycle of his own, one every
bit as ambitious and immersive.

Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible
power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped
ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in
branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built
only where the topography offers shelter.

It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known
as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain:
mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into
near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were
fought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on a ruined landscape
called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical
apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced
to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately
against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the
leaders who consider them expendable.

Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his
brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The
Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and
the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.

Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train
under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinarâ€™s niece, Jasnah.
Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallanâ€™s motives are less than
pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at
secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.
