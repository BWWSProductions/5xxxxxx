I have an image with text in a .jpg and in vector format.  I want to seperate the image from the text and then save the image as .jpg and possibly vector.  There are so many photoshop apps here...which is the easiest for me to use?

again as usual, you have provided a gem here.
With my temp setup and weak net connection, it took me more than 79 hours to get this superb download, and forever like so many others, I am grateful to you, brother.
Thanks & Thanks
