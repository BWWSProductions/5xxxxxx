
Modest Mouse released a collection of B-sides and outtakes from their aforementioned successes last year. The EP titled No One's First, and You're Next is the most recent output for the band to date. Despite rumours they'd be testing out new tracks, Brock has maintained the band isn't quite ready, so expect a display of their biggest and best when they hit the Main stage.

*With no available info and at short notice, I am unable to provide the tracklisting for this set.Hopefully somebody else can post it and I'll add it to the description later.*
