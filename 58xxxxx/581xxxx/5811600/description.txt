PrisM NOTES:
Sorry, I'm a perfectionist and I couldn't take hearing the audio was tinny, or complaints about echo. Killed the tinny and murdered the echo. Sorry this should have been how it was the first time, can the p2p scene forgive me? Yes it's another repack, but until we perfect the encoding settings theirs gonna be 1 or 2 extra...but it's no odds either way, and we want to give you the best possible release from what the sources permit. If you were satisfied the first time around, don't worry about it. Here's a great release of A-Team until dvdrip or something better comes along. This is the  best audio out I can guarentee you that, so add it to your collection, or don't.. I will still keep releasing what everyone loves to have. I included two samples, sample from the first release, and sample from the REPACK. Compare before you download, Enjoy //iNK
