,nslewand,2010-09-07T16:58Z,And this is in the xbox 360 section why?
,JTAGpope,2010-09-07T21:03Z,OMG It is happening! PS3 Uploads here I come! 
,SpitvenoM,2010-09-08T00:17Z,well if you guys hadnt noticed there is no ps3 section yet (get onto that pirate bay) still could of uploaded to ps2 section i suppose but im just glad to see ps3 torrents fuck 3.42fw i am hpoing for cfw :D
,nslewand,2010-09-08T00:49Z,So if it is 8 gigs...how are you supposed to burn it. Burning 8 gigs to a bluray would be a waste of space.
,nslewand,2010-09-08T01:17Z,"nm im dumb, i forgot dl's are 8.5 gb. I am used to 360 isos."
,pickled_egg,2010-09-08T02:44Z,"To play this you need the PSJailbreak USB Dongle

Put this image on an external hard drive & connect it to your PS3.
Load PSJailbreak Menu
Select your game from the hard drive
Exit back to XMB
The Game will appear as though you have inserted the BluRay Disc so you just load the game as normal from there.

You can stare as many games as you like on the HDD but don't change the image name as some games won't load if you do (All games on the HDD show a mini picture in the PSJailbreak menu so you can see what the game no matter what name it has)"
,MoleP,2010-09-08T05:05Z,TPB should create new section for PS3 Games now!  
,Bujaaa,2010-09-08T08:30Z,I heard that sony made a new firmware version for PS3. You must install this update to play games and when you do PSJailbreak becomes useless. Is this true?

[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-08T13:05Z,And stores who sells the PSJ will get sued.
,Wasson15,2010-09-08T14:47Z,@Sunblock there is a work around for that update also you can use a TI-84 calculator to upload that software. Not just the Dongle .
[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-08T20:25Z,Well then u have nothing to worry about i guess :P
,daperdon,2010-09-08T21:16Z,@sunblock were do uget the psjailbreak firmware from
,pickled_egg,2010-09-08T22:37Z,"Stores who sell the PSJailbreak will not be sued as they do not break any laws in any country in the world.

Anyone can sell anything to play backup/copied games on any Computer or console.

The Only laws say that we the users cannot use the devices/software to play BackUps unless we own the original Game.

Thats why no company has ever managed to get any backup system banned. 
Nintendo tried in the early 90's to ban the Super Magic Drive & it's variants.... They Failed
SEGA tried in the early 90's to ban the Magic Drive & it's variants.... They Failed
Sony tried to ban the Mod Chip in the PSX.. They Failed
Sony Tried to ban the Mod Chip in the PS2.. They Failed
Microsoft tried to ban the Mod Chip in the XBox.. They failed
Microsoft Tried to Ban the flashing of the Xbox360.. They Failed (But won the right to refuse a flashed Xbox360 access to their servers... Making it the only Decision any court has ever taken against us)

As for the new sony PS3 update. I just refused it & continued to play my games even online"
,daperdon,2010-09-08T22:55Z,@pickledegg were do i get the firmware or flashdrive or software to play back ups on my ps3

,real_14,2010-09-09T00:00Z,"well i understand the penddrive have a chip or something similar, itÂ´s not a normal pendrive usb"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-09T11:08Z,"@pickled_egg

There is several store have withdraw the PSJ from there advertisement etc.. That means Sony have made some legal pressure on them. If it leads to something i dont know and time will tell i guess."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-09T11:22Z,"But there is so many other options and Sony will never win this in the end...AT90USBKEY, Teensy++ 2.0..etc....:P"
,SpitvenoM,2010-09-09T11:38Z,You can jailbreak ps3 using calculators and phones now.
,daperdon,2010-09-09T12:29Z,is thier tutorial somewhere to show me
