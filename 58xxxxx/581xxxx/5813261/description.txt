Notes 

Note on that last feature above, I've tested the larger files on a 6th generation iPod Classic (2007) and on an iPhone 3G and found no issues with the file size or length. Audiobook Builder has built-in limitations for size based on bitrate/quality/etc and each book came in under the max size for a single part. I suspect you will have no troubles with these on your iPod. If you do decide you want to split them, I recommend downloading Audiobook Builder. It's exceedingly easy to use, and you'll have no troubles at all. It picks up all the chapter titles, etc from the files you add into it. You will have to open the file in Quicktime and re-drag all of the individual chapter art into Audiobook builder though (as I had to in updating these), but this is a very quick process.

I hope you find that this is the definitive collection of the Jim Dale readings of the Harry Potter books, and that you enjoy it as much as I do!
