While commenting there seems to be many restrictions on the words we post , it seems to be a list of blacklisted words, 

Whenever we try to include this words in COMMENT, we get a DATABASE ERROR, but we have no idea which word it is ,for a very long period i don't know i cannot post any links here ,"
