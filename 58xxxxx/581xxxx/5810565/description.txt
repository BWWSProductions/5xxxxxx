ScanSoft TextBridge Pro OCR
TextBridge Pro is an excellent state-of-the-art OCR program (Optical Character Recognition) that will convert a scanned image of text into editable text characters suitable for your word processor. TextBridge Pro can be run standalone, or from the menu of most word processors, or integrated from Pagis Pro. It will scan that image, or use previously scanned image files of formats BMP, PCX, DCX, TIF, XIF, and Winfax Pro files (there is even a scheduler to do large runs overnight). It can process many pages of images, and can run your scanners Automatic Document Feeder too, if you have one. It can output files in most word processor file formats, and Postscript EPS and HTML too. Or you can route the text directly into a word processor via a Send To menu.
