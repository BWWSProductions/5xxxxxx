,floorman1,2011-01-06T04:44Z,thanx
,catness24,2011-01-09T19:24Z,"you may need to advise anyone changing name to make sure its at least 4 charcters long as this is part of the license number generated.
Thank you for the load it, works well."
,kl2o,2011-02-01T06:31Z,"Works perfectly!

Try writing a different name and email if it doesnt work, and remember to ""patch"" before you ""generate.""

I also did a firewall block just to be safe on the executable file."
,Enigma1990ad,2011-02-01T21:08Z,"I followed all of your instructions and still when I opened the application it requested a serial number from me. 
Is this because I am running Windows 7 32-bit OS?"
,tikigod19,2011-02-19T13:56Z,"just to let you know this simply does not work on windows 7 x64.

I am familiar with the install as its the same as a previous version I had, but this DOES NOT WORK on win 7.

Shame."
,the_phantom75,2011-03-04T13:14Z,"Hi

I can confirm this DOES work on Windows 7 64 bit.

Cheers"
,jarlsberg_n,2011-04-20T11:10Z,"It took me a while to make it work on Vista 64b despite all the advice given here. Here is what I did (I already had a previous version installed; I followed the instructions given here plus one or two things):

1) Delete the old version (and delete the folder in program files\Pegasys Inc)
2) Delete the folder C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Pegasys Inc\TMPGEncAuthoringWorks4
3) Delete the folder TMPGEnc in My Documents (Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s absolutely necessary, but it didnâ€™t work until I did it)
4) Install the new version
5) Right click on the Pegasys Inc folder, properties, Security, Modify, and grant total control to users, administrators and SYSTEM.
6) In the app folder, set compatibility mode to XP SP2 for the exe files, i.e. TMPGEncAuthoring Works4 and TMPGEncAuthoring Works4Batch [right click, properties, compatibility]
7) Run the app (i.e. TMPGEncAuthoring Works4) once and close it.
8) Restart (weird, I know, but when I ran the crack without restarting, it bugged, as if the app was still running and the crack couldnâ€™t access it)
9) Set keygen compatibility to XP SP2.
10) Run it as admin and change the version to: 4.0.12.42
11) Select the install folder.
12) Click on patch.
13) And then click on generate (even though it's the 1st button).

Hope it works for you

IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL ON WINDOWS 7 X64 BIT Version, change the Pegasys Inc Folder Location to c:\Program Files (THE X64 one and not THE c:\Program Files(x86))"
