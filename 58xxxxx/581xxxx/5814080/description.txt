    Patrick Stewart narrates a landmark three-part series      
    on the world's last mountain gorillas.                    
                                                             
    This edition follows the plight of some of the youngest   
    and most vulnerable of the mountain gorilla population.    
    Includes the two young orphans whose mothers were         
    callously murdered in execution-style killings, the      
    young female battling with new emotions, and the new      
    gorilla king struggling to keep hold of the group he       
    fought so hard to win.                                    
                                                             
    Discover how they cope in this exploration of what the    
    future holds for the remaining last few hundred            
    mountain gorillas.
