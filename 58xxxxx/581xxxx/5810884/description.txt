On behalf of 20-40, i.e. his encoding, my uploading to free up his slots.

I have a slow UP speed so please be patient.

Craig Ferguson shows will be UP'ed by me until 20-40 can free up a slot or the demand for CF suddenly increases. It is has a 'very small but decicated following'; you either like him or you don't.

I happen to know tha 20-40 likes CF, however, 20-40 'fans' and THEIR preference/demands always come first and market forces demand that others shows take precedence.

Please check back here between Tuesday-Saturday everey week and I will do my best to UP the latest CF show one day at a time.

AGAIN, I have a slow UP speed so please be patient.

Thank you.
Jon
