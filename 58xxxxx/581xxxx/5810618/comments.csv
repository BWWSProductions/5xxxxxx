,SS4Moku,2010-09-06T23:12Z,Are any of these missing pages at all?
[T],brodahisou,2010-09-06T23:28Z,"No they are the best complete scans I could find.  Volumes 1, 3 and 4 are the fixed scans and should contain any missing pages."

The software is free and it worked like a charm!"

I have downloaded several other torrents with some pages scrambled, it's kinda hard to put them in the correct order without having the actual comic."
,cartman19987,2011-03-13T19:34Z,Thanks for this perfect upload!
,coleix,2011-08-19T23:42Z,"Thanks for the upload, read book 6 and was great quality."
,ovisobscuris,2011-10-08T20:28Z,I rather prefer to unzip them and put them in a folder than add more programs.
