,tinstaafl,2010-09-11T02:59Z,"@thetorrentlord - I'll get those ISO's for you, but first I would like to see at least 2 other seeders for this torrent first.  Then I'll do the same with each of the ISO's."
,cheborneck,2011-04-24T08:02Z,good luck getting seeders. if you're going to rip dvd's do them as iso's. indy tracks are useless as torrents
,holdenmcgutzen,2011-05-24T23:21Z,"Don't worry bout chubbyneck.
You are doing a great thing tinstaafl!!!
I wanted to see some of these videos for many years.
And these are a very user friendly file format.
I'm a good seeder and I'll help as long as I can"
,Intrepidone66,2011-09-03T16:09Z,Thanks for Sharing! I will keep seeding it over the labor day weekend.
,ThickMcRunFast,2012-06-06T17:30Z,Seeding through the weekend.  Very stoked about this torrent.  Ignore the haters.  THANKS!
