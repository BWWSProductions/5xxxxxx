,sugarze,2010-09-09T13:13Z,So.. does this one work with win7 64 bit?
,Hatredg0d,2010-09-10T08:34Z,"Ummmm, yes, the sims 3 works on win7."
,djNecr0,2010-09-14T09:38Z,"Repost from the other upload of this torrent (same package)

This iso will install the game, and the serial does work, but if you extract the iso, there is no crack folder, just a vitality folder that makes no sense. I am not also clear if this version is compatible with licensed versions, or if it is compatible with anything but the Base Game.

I tried to find the copy files but with the way EA makes sims 3 (After Ambitions), and the fact that the base games have to be manually uninstalled to work, I am not going to copy any of the files over.

Usually stuff packs don't have the same protection but they can change the game structure.

My launcher screen crashed out and wrote a bunch of errors which had to be scanned and also the reboot detected errors.

I'm going to do a standard uninstall and see if that fixes the game.

I'm pretty experienced with this, and Sims 3 games turn to malware if you screw up a pirate copy and are extremely painful to remove and make work, even if you own legit copies (a lot of the custom content can also corrupt your game after Ambitions)

If there is a solution to this, please let me know. If not, I don't advise installing it if you have legit copies and particularly of Ambitions."

,leahh,2010-10-26T15:14Z,"So I have mounted the disc and installed and then used one of the serials below. Once I run the The Sims 3 Fast Lane, it eventually tells me that this isn't a correct copy. Is there something I'm missing? Am I supposed to copy over a file? Please let me know."

Thanks IWalkAlone247."
,Napwnleon,2010-11-16T21:36Z,"Don't know why, but this one broke my game. I have Late Night and High End Lot Stuff installed. When I installed this one, it kept giving me an error whenever I tried playing the game. So be cautious downloading/installing this if you have the same 2 xpacs I have. I also have Vista 64bit if that helps with anything."
,yelloo,2010-11-21T03:41Z,Thanks AiTB.

expansiones de tal manera que no se
actualicen nunca?,es que se me actualizan 
y ya no puedo jugar...gracias"
,liammyster,2010-12-10T23:50Z,"@womaan

instalar la expansión, con ese código de CD (((VPMV-7PYX-VTY6-RTY6-6VTY ))), entonces, no se actualizan nunca más. el ""crack"" no se puede actualizar. de lo contrario el juego no funcionará.  Lo siento, mi español es muy mal. la gramática es mierda "
,Dartion1,2010-12-26T23:37Z,Does this work wih the razor version? and if so how do i install this and all the other stuff
,spaz92693,2011-01-02T17:26Z,"Thank you very much for this. I have successfully installed this, and the bass game (razor1911) on my mac.

WORKS IN WINDOWS 7 64B WITH THE OTHER EXPANSION PACKS. "
,jimmyjojr,2011-02-01T09:21Z,"Stupid question, if I have a LEGIT version of the base game, can I still install this or will it cause problems?"
,atarigamer,2011-02-07T01:23Z,"jimmyjojr, it's not a stupid question. Installing a pirated expansion pack on a legit copy of Sims 3 will still work, but you will need to use the cracks provided on the CD. Also, you might want to stay away from anything online too."
,Amy McGregor,2011-02-12T21:34Z,"I run a Win7 64-bit OS. I have the original TS3 basegame and High End Loft Stuff, Outdoor Living and now Fast Lane Stuff, in that order, and it works very good! Thank you AiTB!"
