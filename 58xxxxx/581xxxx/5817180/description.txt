PLOT

When Chance (Brian Presley) returns home after five years in jail, he is determined to escape his past, 
start a new life and make peace with his father, (Ed Harris, Golden GlobeÂ® winner), 
who is the head of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang and serving a life sentence for murder.  

Upon his release, his dreams of a crime-free future begin to disintegrate when he is forced to assume his best friend's outrageous debt to a local mobster. 
Despite being thrust back into a world of organized fighting, drug dealing and ties to corrupt police agents,

living a normal life seems almost within reach. But will he be able to escape the crimes of his father and his past?
