The other (Well seeded?) torrent you refer to has only 6 seeders and 2800 leachers."

So what?Does that mean this torrent is really good? I dont know but i respect some comments ,so i will skip this one.I prefer you to do same thing until a ""really"" good rip will be released."
,PriSoner69,2010-09-06T15:14Z,"I have allready downloaded this torrent.

Both rips are the same rip and as good as they get for a 720p rip. A10 V10

It's just that this rip has more seeders than the other and as such will download faster.

This now has 170 seeders vs 30 for the other torrent."

Can I ask what you use to watch this kind of movies (Blurayrips)? A LCD/LED TV or PC ?

Thx."
,PriSoner69,2010-09-06T16:10Z,"a 2 Year old 32"" LCD Full 1080p TV via a Play!On HD Network Media Player."
,TheChosen1_,2010-09-07T11:56Z,"Ok thax but as i know, it is not so possible to find out if the movie's quality is already 
good or not if you arent using a LCD/LED bigger than 42"".I mean it wont be different 
if you are watching a BRRip or original BlurayDisk in 32"" (for instance).I am not telling it for
being a ""bad boy"".I am saying it cuz it is not still clear the video is really enaugh or not.
(I am using 46"" LCD)

And I want to know something too.If I watch this (and some others) in a 51"" high-res tv or 
bigger, can it cause some problems?Can it look like a movie which has dvd quality or
worse?

Thank you guys and thx uploader."
