Description: Discovery Channel produced a fantastic series, captured the sunrise in the beautiful corners of the planet. It can not be fully described a documentary - it's just the sunrise - from the moment when the first rays break through the horizon, heralding the imminent end of the night, until the moment when life is waking up from sleep. On a remarkable moment of dawn tell only the sounds of nature - the cries of birds, the sound of the surf, the rustling of the morning breeze.
