â€œCombichristâ€ is an aggrotech group, formed in Norway and currently based in the United States.

In 2003 Andy LaPlegua of â€œIcon of Coilâ€ wrote a few power noise/techno cross over tracks under the name of â€œD.r.i.v.E.â€. This was changed to â€œCombichristâ€ when the debut album, â€œThe Joy of Gunzâ€ was set to be released on Out Of Line. The name Combichrist originates from a hardcore fanzine LaPlegua made during the late 90s, with â€œJR Ewingâ€ guitarist HÃ¥kon Mella.

The follow up EPs, and the clamour for live shows, sent Combichrist out on the road where they would become known for their strong and energetic performances.

Their second EP, â€œsex, drogen und industrialâ€, spent 7 weeks at number one in the DAC charts.

In March of 2007 they released their third album â€œWhat The Fuck Is Wrong With You People?â€.

Their latest album, â€œToday We Are All Demonsâ€, was released on January 20th, 2009.

Combichrist have had much more success than many of the other acts emerging from the electronic underground and the band have become one of the dark electro sceneâ€™s most popular live acts. 


The roster of live members is currently Joe Letz (ex â€œGenitorturersâ€), Mr Petersen, Z_Marr (ex â€œHell Trashâ€), Kourtney Klein (who also played drums for the reformed â€œNitzer Ebbâ€) and Trevor Friedrich who was the drummer for â€œEighteen Visionsâ€ and â€œImperative Reactionâ€. Past live members include HÃ¥kon Mella, Bjoern Petersen, Syn M, Shaun Frandsen & Jon H.

combichrist's newest album isn't as good as their past stuff, but it has some good tracks.
