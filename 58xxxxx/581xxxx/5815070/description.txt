This is the workbook for the Japanese learning course Genki II. The existing pdf version of this workbook that is out there seems to have bleed through on the pages, so you can see a faint image of the next page on each page. This makes it unsuitable for printing. As I am going to be going through this book in the near future, having a printable version of the workbook was highly desirable, so I created this and thought I would share. It's in high resolution and should look good printed.
