Sha Na Na is an American rock and roll group. Announcing themselves as \"from the streets of New York,\" and outfitted in gold lamÃ©, leather jackets, and pompadour hairdos, Sha Na Na performs a song and dance repertoire of classic fifties rock and roll, simultaneously reviving and sending up the music and 1950s New York street culture. 
Their current touring group features original members Donny York, and Jocko Marcellino, and another member from the TV show who had joined just after Woodstock, Screamin\' Scott Simon. Everyone else from the TV show has left the group, and been replaced by bass singer Reggie Battise, bass player Jim Waldbillig, guitarist Gene Jaramillo, drummer Paul Kimbarow, and sax player Michael Brown.
