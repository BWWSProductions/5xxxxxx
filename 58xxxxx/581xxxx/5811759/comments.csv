I think this is a very good series.. very realistic and most of the facts are correct.. I got hooked to watching this last week.. Among the show u listed, none of them I like... I totally hate numbers, lost and prison break ( especially after season 1)... Lost is too confusing, Numbers is too fictional, Prison break is just... bad n boring.. No offend to people who like these series.. Everyone has their own personal preferences.. Maybe I like Breaking Bad because I had some experience with it myself.. Thank u riddlerA, I hope you'll do weed soon while I'm still in the mood for these kind of shows.. hehe..."

,akaleeroy,2010-11-19T19:20Z,"This upload is a model for all other: MKVs, fitting English subtitles included, good naming scheme, precise description, complete series. And what a series! 

Notice how the archetype of the contemporary individual finally gets his spot on TV breaking the age-old chain of mediocre, overly politically correct, everybody-should-understand-it shows. 

We now have House MD, Californication and Breaking Bad!

These tap into the thirst for science of an increasing number of people. 
And of course, they draw such a following because they're a reaction to the dull series of before. Action, reaction. Cause and effect. "

Awesome quality for the filesize, thanks Riddler."
,eclecticjohn,2011-09-17T19:35Z,"I know you get a lot of requests, a lot of which are for bad shows and movies. Based on that, I'm not going to ask for any shows. But, were you planning on doing Sons of Anarchy or True Blood. More so SoA, the last two dates ago I've been on, I've had True Blood come up and I need something to talk about on my next one cause I'm boring :p I did skim over your collection and it mirrors my own tastes, so was just curious. Cheers."
,Deathspanka,2011-09-19T12:45Z,Best TV show like ever! THX 
,734Ch3r4u,2011-09-19T20:57Z,"Minor video skips/glitches once or twice a show but since they are very short in duration, I still recommend this torrent.

,eclecticjohn,2011-09-21T21:01Z,"You've done it, again! Any chance of season 4?"
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2011-09-22T07:55Z,"@Halizar

or you could not be a tool, and simply download the codecs (k-lite bunch), and then watch it with Windows Media Player. Save a lot of time not having to convert the files."

,Tignus,2011-10-16T16:00Z,"Yes censored version, if you're talking about ""fuck"" being censored.

Nice video, audio is good until season 3 at which point it seems to me that the quality lowers a bit. But still a very good torrent."
,Tignus,2011-10-16T17:37Z,(UPDATE) The audio in Season 3 is back to good quality around episode 6-7

,piratiinho,2011-12-31T20:31Z,"By the way, the subtitles of season 3 are rubbish. So if someone is not very good at English, he better look for other ones."

,theshdw99,2012-02-01T03:01Z,Needs more seeds!!! Awesome upload btw :D
,omkar1990,2012-02-19T13:57Z,"Hello RiddlerA. You are a great uploader. There is a TV show named Top Gear. The total torrent size for it is 80gb. Is there any way you could compress it to 30gb and upload. It would be really great, and popular torrent. Pease, Pease, Pease."
,omkar1990,2012-02-19T15:08Z,It would be best if you could upload Top Gear season wise. I would be very grateful. Many of my friends too want it. Our HDD space is running out fast.
,[khemist],2012-03-05T05:23Z,"thanks uploader for a solid space-friendly release. but really, if you honestly think this is an A10/V10 release you need to have both your eyes AND ears checked!"
,edman3d,2012-04-08T03:52Z,Need seeders please! 9kb/s sucks! Thanks.
,remomama,2012-05-26T10:17Z,Thanks Riddler for the awesome effort. A 9 V 6. Video blurry and heavily pixelated as usual. Not that I'm complaining with this size! :D
