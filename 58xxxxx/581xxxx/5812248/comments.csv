During installation it says previous installation of SPB Pocket Plus must be uninstalled, and it tries to do it. Then it says a soft reset is necessary and it goes through that process. And it does through the same process, but the previous (unregistered, expired) version is still present but not operable...I assume because it's expired. I can't find a good serial # to register it."
