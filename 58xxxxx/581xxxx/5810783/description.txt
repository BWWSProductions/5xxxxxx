
When Erwin Rommel diedâ€”by forced suicide at Hitlerâ€™s commandâ€”he left behind in various ingenious hiding places the papers that recorded the story of his dramatic career and the exact details of his masterly campaigns. It was his custom to dictate each evening a running narrative of the dayâ€™s events and, after each battle, to summarize its course and the lessons to be learned from it. He wrote, almost daily, intimate and outspoken letters to his wife in which his private feelings andâ€”after the tide had turnedâ€”forebodings found expression. To this is added by Rommelâ€™s son Manfred the story of the field marshallâ€™s last weeks and the final day when he was given the choice of an honorable suicide or an ignominious trial for treason. An engrossing human document and a rare look at the mind of the â€Desert Fox,â€ The Rommel Papers throws an interesting light on the Axis alliance and on the inner workings of Hitlerâ€™s high command.
