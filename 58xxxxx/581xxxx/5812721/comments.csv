,plsx4,2010-09-06T02:35Z,this is pal or ntsc 
,coorzltz,2010-09-06T02:58Z,"Number one, there were no connected seeds when I commented. Number two this movie is in fucking PAL not NTSC. Learn to post correctly!!"
[V],NLUPPER002,2010-09-06T09:17Z,"Its PAL 

No seeders well using Initial seeding so it runs with no seeders LOL

And yes I'm human and humans sometimes make mistakes.
But to immediately curse and swear, is exaggerated.

Its still a nice release,

Greatings"
,coorzltz,2010-09-06T16:07Z,Well sorry but you were tardy to the party. By you're human mistake alot of people downloaded this to find out it didn't work. I do appreciate your work. While it can be watched on a computer alot of people were looking for the NTSC version so they could watch it with their family.
