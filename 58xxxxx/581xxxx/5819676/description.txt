	NOTES:
	
	All the previous DSR encodes from S01 by OMiCRON and one 
	ep by YesTV should be nuked for no ivtc. Since this is 
	PDTV we couldn't tag it proper, but we still wanted to 
	make it known. 

	Also VH1 has a habit of removing the opening titles and
	end credits when they reair multiple episodes so that is
	why runtime is a bit short compared to normal. They were 
	not removed by us.
	
	INFO:
	
	MINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all
	the gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing
	of unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the
	show is really old and the hope of finding the original
	release is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. 
	
	This of course makes our releases a bit random and some
	might think we are mad but there will be a reason behind
	the madness.
