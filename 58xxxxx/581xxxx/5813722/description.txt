In this unprecedented sit-down Interview, Esther and Jerry Hicks relate their incredible story and introduce Abraham. Abraham then explains the basics of their teachings, and answers a myriad of questions about every facet of living. Also included is a bonus segment from an Abraham-Hicks seminar cruise in which Abraham reveals the secret behind the best-selling video and book â€œThe Secretâ€, which was originally based on Abrahamâ€™s Teachings, but from which Abraham was ultimately deleted. Finally, join Esther, Jerry, Abraham and hundreds of attendees at a 2010 â€œArt of Allowingâ€ workshop in San Francisco, California where Abraham explains their powerful Vortex of Creation concept in detail and then answers questions from several guests seeking more clarity.

Jerry & Esther Hicks 
http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/index.php

For over 20 years Esther & Jerry Hicks have published hundreds of books, audio recordings and videos, and have conducted up to 60 workshops a year. Their work is derived from the teachings of "Non-Physical Source Energy" whom they refer to as "Abraham".

The Teachings of Abrahamâ„¢ are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience.

â€œThe thrill of the ride is carved out of the contrast. Without the contrast, you could not decide.â€

Answers and inspiration from the Non-Physical entity Abraham â€” whom Esther calls â€œinfinite intelligenceâ€ and Jerry refers to as â€œthe purest form of love Iâ€™ve ever encountered.â€
