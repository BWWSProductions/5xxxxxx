,simonrulestheworld,2010-09-16T21:01Z,its the real deal. Thanx a bunch!
,storden99,2010-10-15T22:26Z,Nice!!! :D Tackar som fan!!!!! 10/10 :)

,awesomewelles,2011-01-02T07:03Z,"^^^^ Oh, NO!!! its a RAR! Whatever will I do? :D"
,monlor,2011-01-08T16:11Z,well it'd save everyone quite some time and hassle. I don't really get why the uploader didn't unrar it in the first place either.
,spamfarm,2011-02-01T23:03Z,"Rar'd - and doesn't unpack correctly for me. Fuck it, not worth it."

To those who don't know how to unrar a file: go to the store and by DVDs."

,chandlerboy,2011-02-26T16:50Z,Uploading torrents of RARed files is stupid and moronic. Wasting everyone's time.
