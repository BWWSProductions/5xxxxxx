Michael Palin - Hemingway Adventure [1999 PAL DVD-DL][En Subs[En]

The following review is based on watching the DVD version of 
Michael Palin's "Hemingway Adventure", subtitled "On the trail 
of an American legend". This version consists of a single DVD-DL 
disc with four programs totaling approx. 3 hours 15 minutes. 
There is no extra material, but English subtitles can be 
turned on or off. I'll hope you'll enjoy. 

This "Hemingway Adventure" is a set of TV programs originally 
made for the BBC in 1999. Michael Palin visits many of the 
places where Ernest Hemingway lived and traveled, displaying 
a keen interest in Hemingway, mostly as a person rather than 
Hemingway's authorship.
