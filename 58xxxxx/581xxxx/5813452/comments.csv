,DDQ,2010-09-06T04:43Z,Just downloaded this and I can confirm it is 'The Next She-Male Idol 2' as the title here says and NOT 'She-Male Idol: The Auditions 2' (a different Joey Silvera movie) despite the fact that the cover of that other movie is given in the links.  Screens are accurate but not cover.
