These are a bunch of brushes to use in Adobe Photoshop. The basic brushes are included, so if you have just the bare essentials, you can copy and paste all of these in your brush file. 

The rest of these can be found all over the internet. I left the folders with various rights/attributions intact. You don't need to take the ABR files from the folders.
