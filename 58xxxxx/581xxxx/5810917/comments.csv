,jiapita,2010-09-06T08:20Z,"i rarely make negative comments as well but... the only reason this does not have the german subs is because they had been cropped and then english subs added,you can just make out the top of the german subs during the film when they are used ,for example at 1:52 when mickey rourke's character is talking to the old man,at the bottom of the screen you can just make out at times the original subs"
