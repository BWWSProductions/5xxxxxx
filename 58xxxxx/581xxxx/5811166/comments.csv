plays brilliantly on a 50"" panasonic plasma using hdmi from an O!play HDP-R1

the O!play offers to either play the whole folder or navigate the folder

choosing play folder goes instantly into the film
otherwise youre going to have to navigate to the dir with the mt2s file in it 

cool film my kids (and I ) loved it 
slightly adult level of wasp / frog violence so might be a tad advanced for the very youngest of childern

10 audio
10 video

THANKS FOR THE UL"
