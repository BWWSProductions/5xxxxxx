,ovenden,2011-02-27T05:53Z,"Okay, so call me stupid. I still cannot figure out how to activate this. I have loaded everything where it should be but TomTom asks for a promotional code to activate. What do I need to do?
Thanks."
,r00ted,2011-09-30T18:31Z,"So, will these work with the simple, stripped down, cheap-o TomTom XL that I got for Black Friday last year?  It has no SD expansion memory, all ""internal"".....but read a lot about some of these maps requiring a ""navcore update"" and some of the maps will not work with the TomTom if it doesn't have the new navcore?"
