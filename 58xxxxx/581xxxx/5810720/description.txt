Curve Fitting Toolbox
* OAS and CDS calculations in Fixed
Income Toolbox, Reuters Contribute
functionality in Datafeed Toolbox
and credit risk enhancements in
Financial Toolbox
* Graphical tool for fitting dynamic
networks to time-series data in Neural
Network Toolbox
* Next-Generation Sequencing Browser in
Bioinformatics Toolbox and time lag
error models, and covariate analysis
in SimBiology

New capabilities for the Simulink
product family include:

* Arrays of buses with For Each subsystems
for reducing Simulink model size
simulation time, and data copies for
large-scale models
* Subsystem variants in Simulink and atomic
subcharts in Stateflow to create
reusable model components
* Test harness generation, data logging
and scripted test execution in Simulink
Verification and Validation
