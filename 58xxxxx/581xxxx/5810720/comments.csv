Just to let you know, when I finished installing there was no desktop icon or start menu folder! Don't worry thought the executable is located in

,ilovez,2010-09-27T00:06Z,Same here! Cannot find crack file and install. Was the crack file removed?
,DennisOlof,2010-09-27T21:26Z,"SIGH.

There IS not crackfile for this program. If you mount the .ISO file (or burn it out) there is a directory on the DVD (of if you explore the .ISO file).

In that directory (/crack or something) there is a .txt file, open that and you have the instructions how to install the program. Just follow that and the program will work just fine.

This is just a updated version from ""The Bitter End"", same installation as r2010a (you can find that too here on TPB so incase you have problems with this version get the r2010a)

Same with .rar files, get free program to unpack it and you will have the ISO file.

,datalog,2010-10-04T20:07Z,"Hello, Why the size of release 2010a is 5,2 Gb and ths release just 3,69.   Any toolbox left? if is it, which tooolbox? TNX"

,AlefSin,2010-10-22T17:53Z,I installed it with no problem but it seems that the license file is not entirely correct: a majority of the toolboxes do not get activated (for me something round 40 out of 60 installed toolboxes do not work). I checked the license file and there is an entry for each of those 40 bad ones but for some reason they do not work. 
,AlefSin,2010-10-22T21:43Z,"I fixed it! Here is how: as you might have noticed, the installer seems to be broken. When it completes the install it does not even create a shortcut for MATLAB in the start menu. Now that one is easy to fix. My problem was with the toolboxes being installed but not available for use. Now the thing is, apparently the installer also fails to create correct MATLAB path. Fix is easy: Goto File/Set Paths. Press the ""Default"" button and then Save. That's it! (to make sure things are fine look the list of the toolboxes in the ""product help"" or the doc command before and after fixing the paths)."
,NagatoYuki,2010-10-31T21:20Z,"I am not sure the real reason that cause the problem installer ...
But I have tested that modify the components in custom install (I deselect the MATLAB Distributed Computing Server), then the next page should shown the file associations and shortcut page, then after install, all the things seems OK"
,gluckman1,2010-11-09T19:22Z,"ok, i use win rar to extract my rar files go to cnet download, its free. "
,knas999,2010-11-11T19:54Z,Don't worry! All the toolboxes are included (cannot list them all here). Regarding the filesize this installation is not spitted up in a 32bit & 64bit (like the R2010a) but combined and saves a lot of space.
,andy5174,2010-11-17T02:08Z,I already have the installation file. Could anyone who had downloaded this tell me what the serial is? Thanks.
,lemonsti,2010-11-19T11:44Z,"Hello there and thank you for matlab,
How can i make a desktop shortcut of matlab??
thanks"

,ppole,2010-12-22T20:12Z,"hi all,
I am new to torrent. I have downloaded that folder. How do i install it now?do i need to write a DVD for it and then run or extract files?
Please let me know guys,

Thanks"
,ZeroZeroOne,2010-12-26T01:51Z,"Thank You! Needed this for electronics class. For those asking:

1. Download the torrent

2. Double click one of the rar files and choose to open with 7zip or Winrar or whatever. If you don't have one, get 7zip (Google it) it's free

3. Extract the .iso to the same folder or wherever you want

4. Mount the .iso with a virtual drive such as Daemon Tools, or burn it to disk if you want

5. Install

6. Choose 'install manually without using the internet' (as the readme in the crack folder says)

7. enter file installation key (also in crack folder' when asked

8. wait for install to finish

9. again choose 'activate manually without using the internet

10. Choose 'browse to location of license file', or whatever

11. browse to the crack folder and choose one of the .dat files (standalone in my case

12. You now have Matlab!

13. launcher installed in C:/Program Files/Matlab/bin

14. launcher is called Matlab and type is application, you can right click it and 'Send to.. Desktop (create shortcut)

15. voila"
,ppole,2011-01-03T20:47Z,"thanks zerozeroone,
I could get till step 7. The moment I enter anything as key, the installer exits :(
I am not sure what to do!!! Do u have any idea?
Thanks"
,crazzylarry,2011-01-19T20:33Z,Are all the .r04 files necessary or are they just copies of one another ?
,lottiexx,2011-02-10T14:53Z,"If you cannot find the crack file. Go to my computer, select the DVD drive with right mouse button and press 'open' to browse files in .iso file"

,cfiziksh,2011-04-02T22:23Z,"Here's what to do if you start MATLAB and get an error saying  ""Warning: C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2010b\toolbox\local\pathdef.m not found."" etc. etc.

1. Launch MATLAB by starting C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2010b\bin\MATLAB.exe

2. Type ""restoredefaultpath"" and hit enter.

3. Go to File->Set Path...

3. Click ""Default""

4. Click ""Save""

5. If it asks to save pathdef.m to a different location, click Yes.  If it doesn't ask that, skip step 7.

6. Close MATLAB

7. Find the pathdef.m you just saved.  Move it to C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2010b\toolbox\local\

8. Reopen MATLAB.  It should work now!

Optional: 

9. Create a shortcut of the C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2010b\bin\MATLAB.exe program in your Start Menu, on your Desktop, or where ever else you want a shortcut.

10. Right click the shortcut and click Properties.

11. Change the path next to Start In: to the folder where you want MATLAB to start by default.

12. Click OK."

Both the install.txt and the two license (.dat) files are corrupted / encoded / encrypted.  They are not text files (they should be).  The actual install files are working. I have noticed that other people had the same problem, but I don't know how they solved it.  I have exactly the same problem trying to install 2009b, 2010a and 2011a.  What am I (and other people) doing wrong?  Why some people see text files while others get binary garbage?  Is it some kind of character encoding or something completely stupid that I am missing?  "

I didn't need to disconnect from the internet, just follow the instructions.
