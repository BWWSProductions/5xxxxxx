From the Academy Award winning director Clint Eastwood comes the untold story of the Japanese soldiers who defended their homeland against the invading American forces during World War II. With little defense other than sheer will and the volcanic rock of Iwo Jima itself and the unprecedented tactics of the General Tadamichi Kuribayashi and his men transform what was predicted to be a swift defeat into nearly 40 days of heroic and resourceful combat. Their sacrifices, struggles, courage and their compassion live on this taut and gripping film Rolling Stone calls "unique and unforgettable".
