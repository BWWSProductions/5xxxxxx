From Booklist
Hundreds of thousands of men are fed into a meat grinder in futile charges against entrenched positions; opposing armies are forging a weird sense of camaraderie as they fraternize during lulls in the slaughter; and rows of rotting corpses are scattered over a bleak, pockmarked landscape. But this isnâ€™t the familiar western front in France. Rather, these stark images are part of a stunning and emotionally wrenching account of war between Austria and Italy over the disputed terrain they both claimed. Although the struggle was recounted in the writings of Ernest Hemingway, the Italian front was regarded as a sideshow by many European journalists as well as Allied war planners. Whatever the strategic value of the campaign, Thompson illustrates that this was a massive, epic struggle that may have cost a million lives. He crafts a narrative rich in detail and which does not shrink from describing the horrors of a war that began, on the Italian side, in a spasm of wild nationalistic fervor but quickly degenerated into resigned cynicism. This is a masterful and moving chronicle. --Jay Freeman --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.
Review
The Weekly Standard
â€œ[A] study as pioneering as it is brilliant.... Drawing on an impressive array of British, Italian, and Austrian sources, including fascinating interviews with survivors, Thompson re-creates the Italo-Austrian conflict in all its facetsâ€¦. The White War is the work of a bright young historian proving his mettle.â€

Dallas Morning News
â€œThompsonâ€™s book is a comprehensive work following the causes, culture and combat of Italyâ€™s war against Austria-Hungary and Germanyâ€¦. Itâ€™s worthwhile reading and remembering, particularly when trying to comprehend what price victory.â€

Robert Fox, Evening Standard
â€œBrilliant â€¦ It is the first general history of the serial incompetence and brutality of the war in north-eastern Italy between 1915 and 1918, which makes it exceptional enough. In its elegant sweep of cultural and political as well as martial themes, it stands alone: it is one of the outstanding history books of the year.â€

Christopher Duggan, Times Literary Supplement
â€œMark Thompsonâ€™s wonderfully rich and poignant study, beautifully written and based on a detailed first-hand knowledge of the terrain in question as well as an impressive array of published Italian sources shows graphically why the events of 1915-18 had such a searing effect on the countryâ€™s national psyche.â€

Max Hastings, New York Review of Books
â€œMark Thompson, a young British writer, can claim a notable achievement with his narrative history of Italyâ€™s World War I experience. With authority, sympathy, and unusual literary skill, he illuminates an aspect of the conflict about which some of us feel embarrassed to have known so little. The battlefield saga is sufficiently fascinating, but eclipsed by the portrait of Italyâ€™s social and cultural experience within which the author sets itâ€¦. Thompsonâ€™s book gives a fascinating, indeed brilliant, portrait of a society immolated by its own delusions.â€

The Economist (Best Books of the Year)
â€œA startling indictment of the Italian stateâ€™s conduct during the first world war, which shows how Italyâ€™s nationalist dream of expansion would turn into the Fascist nightmare.â€

John McCourt, Irish Times
â€œBrilliantâ€¦ In presenting this conflict with such uncompromising focus and detail, Thompson has successfully accomplished a necessarily uncomfortable act of remembranceâ€¦. It should be hailed as the best account yet of what Hemingway described as â€˜the most colossal, murderous, mismanaged butcheryâ€™ of the Great War and of the experiences of the vast majority of Italian soldiers who, in Giovanni Comissoâ€™s words, had little or no knowledge of â€˜what they had done, or why.â€™â€

Peter Popham, Independent
â€œThompsonâ€™s book is beautifully written, and he skillfully interweaves vivid accounts of military progress with telling vignettes about the more extraordinary figures caught up in the fighting.â€

The Washington Times
â€œ[Thompsonâ€™s] writing is so vivid, so detailed, so sobering that a reader must take an occasional break from the horrors he describes.â€

Newark Star-Ledger
â€œ[A] gripping, superbly written accountâ€¦â€

Michigan War Studies Review
â€œThis is no ordinary work of military historyâ€¦. Thompsonâ€™s narrative strategies make for an engaging, powerful bookâ€¦. [A] richly textured account of a people and its army at war.â€

MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History
â€œ[A] memorable workâ€¦. [A] riveting description of World War Iâ€™s forgotten front.â€

H-Net Reviews
â€œ[I]lluminatingâ€¦. [B]oth historians and general audiences with interest in the First World War will benefit from Thompsonâ€™s study as a contribution toward a more comprehensive, diverse picture of the war than the one to which most western readers are accustomed.â€

Military Review
â€œThis narrative of that frostbitten war draws from the work of generations of historians and writers (among them Ernest Hemingway) but gleans vignettes that display the passions of the time and the difficulty of changing a strategy mired in repeated failure.â€

Journal of Military History
â€œThompson writes well and his narrative flows smoothly and easily. He has the novelistâ€™s ability to capture a character in a phrase, and produces some telling snapshots: Lloyd Georgeâ€™s â€˜silver tongueâ€™ and Clemenceauâ€™s â€˜salty charismaâ€™ stand out.â€

Choice
â€œ[A] stunning account of repeated failure and despair, incompetence and opportunism; a human tragedy all too easily entered upon and pursued. In addition to sustained accounts of military engagements, there are vivid portraits of key figures, notably Dâ€™Annunzio and Mussolini.â€
