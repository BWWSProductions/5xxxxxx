SYNOPSIS: Tom Courtenay gives a flawlessly nuanced performance as Billy Fisher, the underachieving undertakerâ€™s assistant whose constant daydreams and truth-deficient stories earn him the nickname â€œBilly Liar.â€ Julie Christie is the handbag-swinging charmer whose free spirit just might inspire Billy to finally move out of his parentsâ€™ house. Deftly veering from gritty realism to flamboyant fantasy, Billy Liar is a dazzling and uproarious classic.
