,Strongbad,2010-12-29T18:42Z,"Didn't work for me.
Error in ISO file when using WBFS 3.0 to add to an USB HDD.

Cant say if it works when you burn on a DVD but if you like me is using an external USB HDD and WBFS 3.0 then don't bother with this release."
,fc322,2010-12-29T21:08Z,"I too had the ""error reading ISO"" message but I rebooted my PC and it went away.  

I am in USA and use NTSC wii console.  This works fine via USB Loader GX but you must choose the game > settings > and set the first option as ""Forced NTSC"" or else the game is black and white."
,impuls3,2011-01-02T09:25Z,"Works on 3.4u, 4.2u, and 4.3u softmodded wiis. All using usb loader gx and/or Neogamma R8 and wiiflow.

For disc, I used ""staples dvd-r"" it was cheap on black friday. and img burned using Roxio Creater DE 10.3 that came with my laptop and that works. Tried using img burn but that didnt work.

hope that helps"

,codencis,2011-09-06T00:15Z,"TO USE THIS ON A WII:

Your Wii needs to be modified before you can play these games. 

Look at buying a WODE or something."

,rottengaper,2011-09-21T19:15Z,"This is the bollocks. I am totally new to all this, i have soft modded my 4.3e wii using an online guide, downloaded this game as my first and the whole thing worked better than expexted. So just a note to those who can't manage, read forums, instructions, download latest software then read again, if you don't know what to do it's a learning experience."

,404url,2011-10-31T11:42Z,Killer slow speed. How come there appears to be 298 seeders yet my speeds are really slow. ;(
,indie_guy,2011-11-09T13:28Z,"Peoples, in order to play this on a Wii, it needs to be softmodded (the Wii). Google the guides. I've read that even the latest update (4.3) is softmoddable. After that just burn it to a DVD-R (preferably Sony or the expensive Verbatim DVD-R), but DON'T USE DVD-RW. An even better idea is to use an external HDD, there's a guide for that too. Cheers ;)"
,jlhnrjd,2011-12-13T11:02Z,This game works great after my torrent kept saying damaged or corrupt I finally got rid of winrar and went to 7-zip the game extracted to wfsb and playing it now on my 4.3  ios249 ubloader thanx a million  webchella
