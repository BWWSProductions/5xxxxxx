JAZZ/IMPROVISATION

Percussionist and jazz pianist Christian Jormin and his trio play music
that is contemplative and meditative. But it never lacks focus or meaning.
Here you will find warmth, spirit, curiosity and inventiveness. Six of the
ten tracks are Christian Jorminâ€™s own compositions, the rest are
improvisations on choral melodies. The trio, which came together in the
1990's, features - apart from Christian Jormin â€“ the bassist Mattias
GrÃ¶nroos and Magnus Boqvist on drums.

"This music has evolved during the church concerts weâ€™ve had over the
years. Music with a contemplative basic character. Simultaneously full of
movement and surprises. Some call it meditative jazz. In our opinion, it doesn't
matter what it's called. If you look at something from a distance, a pattern
emerges. When you move in closer, you can distinguish the details." Christian
Jormin
