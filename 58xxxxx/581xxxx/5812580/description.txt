Osho - Remastered - Volume 1

This is a remastered version to improve sound quality and remove
the defects of the source material, minimize the noise, rumble and
other distracting sound characteristics and make the voice sound
more intimate so your contact becomes closer.

It also contains the Fluctuation Meditations 1 - 3.

This collection is released for archival purposes.
If you already have the remastered versions, there is no point of downloading this one. But if you don't, or are not sure you do have all of them as of this date, then this one will take care of all Remastered versions existing at this time.
