Now, baby, you are sucking at as high bandwidth as it gets, well almost.

Do not fail me now. If I see you go away after you received a royal treatment, that is no good for your soles. We'll just rip them off and make you walk barefoot.

Yes, the Scandinavians seem to be strange people, especially Sweeds. Who knows, it may be the weather. You ALL, suckers, come high speed connection and once you get what you want, you could care less the planet Earth exists.

Are you sure? Do you know what you have downloaded? Well, if that is who you are, you downloaded your own death. It does not matter whether you decided to do your part or not. You won't be able to ignore it. Sooner or later you WILL look into it, as deep as it gets.

Hey, welcome.

Anyone else sucking at high bandwidth just to accumulate more and more and more and more
of NOTHING, join the party. Top of the list treatment will be provided."

They only have a small fraction indexed. Plus it will bring you all sorts of other articles you do not necessarily want to see.

Better go to http://oshosearch.net site and perform a search from there. This way you are guaranteed to search every single article on that site. That site does not have any kind of ads or any other irrelevant things.

,HeyNonnyNonnyNonnyMus,2010-09-10T21:32Z,"Osho was formerly known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his teachings led members of his cult to poison over 700 people in The Dalles, OR in 1984.  He changed his name after he was deported from the U.S., but his teachings are the same - dangerous and insane.  "
,veerenski,2010-09-12T08:24Z,"I do not know what kind of jerk you are and what is the purpose of your shitting all over Osho torrents. Are you trying to get famous?

You are definitely an idiot, an of a blood boiling type, desperately craving for attention. But have some mercy on yourself.

You claim Osho and his ""teachings"" cause a massive poisoning. What does OSHO has to do with this sickness?

Would you acuse Jesus and his ""teachings"" causing the most disgusting homo-degenerate violence among the Christian priests towards innocent children, you idiot?

What was the benefit for Osho for poisoning many people, you lil ding dong, desperately craving for attention?

Even an idiot with slightly more intelligence than yours, just slightly, would be able to compute that such a strategy can not possibly produce any tangible benefits of ANY kind. For what? What do you expect as a result by poisoning some people? What are you going to achieve?

Do you think Osho is so idiotic to even conceive such a profound sickness?

Did you listen to ANY of his discourses? And what did you hear, Mr. Ding Dong?

Yes, you can shit all over the place with your sub-idiotic ""revelations"". No question about it. But what do YOU expect as a result? Unseat Osho from the place where he sits?"
,HeyNonnyNonnyNonnyMus,2010-09-18T06:33Z,"veerenski, Wow.  Look at the hatred you have!  

I posted facts and you post anger and crazy accusations in return.  That is the kind of thing that osho teaches.

I couldn't have proven the point that osho's teachings are dangerous and insane any better than that.

Thank you.  "
,veerenski,2010-09-19T20:37Z,Grrrrr!!!
,LamaPower,2010-09-20T13:52Z,You honored your being and the teacher mate. I am really happy for you.
,veerenski,2010-09-21T17:48Z,"LamaPower,

You have a beautiful heart, alive and throbbing. Do not worry about anything. You are in as good of a shape as it gets.

Osho says: ""My way is the way of the heart""."
,veerenski,2010-09-23T11:31Z,"If you do not have anything by Osho yet, by downloading this torrent, you will have all there is to know. It contains several books and constitutes > 99% of the essence of what he is talking about. If you think this is not enough, just forget about Osho and go find something else. You won't get anything else. So, no need to waste the bandwidth and suck on limited resources. It won't help you ANY way you cut it.

Now, if you do not have anything else so far, start downloading this torrent and to be able to start listening to some discourse or a chapter of your interest, set its Priority to High and priority for all other files to low. This way, you will download those chapters with High priority first.
Then start listening to it while the whole thing downloads. That is the best strategy.

You do not need to download the individual Remastered or Fluctuation Meditation torrents. They are all here in this one.

Enjoy."

BELOVED MASTER,
WHAT ARE YOUR LAST WORDS GOING TO BE TO THE WORLD?

It reminds me of a story George Gurdjieff used to tell his closest disciples. The story is about a great past master, a buddha, who had a self-appointed right-hand man who was a faithful follower for year after year. And when the master was in his room on his deathbed, all of the followers silently waited by the door not knowing what to do and incapable of believing that their mystical master was really dying.

Finally, through the sorrowful stillness, the master's voice was faintly heard to call the name of the right-hand man, and all of the followers looked at him intently as he made his way to the master's door. As he reached for the knob he glanced at the peering faces around him and imagined their envy and respect for him at being the only one to be called to the master's side during his final moments. He already imagined how after the master's death he would slowly emerge from the room as the new head of the system, a veritable Peter-of-the-Rock.

Quietly he entered the darkened room and slowly he made his way and knelt by the bed. The old master nodded for him to come nearer, and he leaned over with his awaiting ear by the old man's mouth, and the master whispered, 

""Fuck you.""

Enough for today."

,veerenski,2010-10-02T09:09Z,"Effective seeding strategy:

The basic idea is to maximize the upload speed so your torrent program shows the same seeding speed as your upload speed of your provider connection.

If you see too many torrents and too many slots on some large torrent, your seeding speed will degrade. Because there is overhead with servicing each upload slot. On a typical machine, the most efficient bandwidth utilization happens at about 8-10 upload slots. A slot is a connection to a specific downloader. Each torrent has a number of downloaders or a number of slots.

So, if you are interested in seeding many torrents, then limit the number of upload slots for each torrent by right clicking on a torrent in Job list, then selecting Properties choice from a popup menu and setting the ""Number of Upload Slots"" to 1 or 2, depending on a total number of torrents and slots are there.

Do not limit your upload rate. It will only decrease your upload performance. Each upload slot should go at the max. upload speed for best efficiency. The only criteria is total number of upload slots.

This way, you will utilize your upload bandwidth to the max.

Periodically check on all the torrents you are potentially interested in uploading and see if some of them have less than 4 seeders, which means they are not well seeded and download rate will be way too slow.

If you see some torrents that have more seeders than downloaders, those torrents are probably seeded enough. You can either pause or stop them and go check the other torrents.

Basically, the lowest reasonable number of seeders per downloaders should be 1 seeder per 1 downloader. Less than that will make downloads very slow."
,veerenski,2010-10-02T09:10Z,"The most effective download strategy:

When you just download a large torrent containing many files, the download will pick random blocks from random files, which will require you to download the whole torrent before you actually have a single piece, a single chapter from a book fully downloaded.

What you do instead is this:

1. Select the Files tab in your torrent program.
2. Click ^A (Control-A) to select all the files.
3. Right mouse button click on files and select ""Low Priority"" from a popup window.
4. Then select a single file or several files you would like to complete first and do the same, right mouse click on those files and select ""High Priority"" from a popup.

What this does is to make sure you will first download the files with Hight Prioirity. So they will get completed first instead of randomly downloading blocks from different files.

Then watch your download and keep setting the High Priority for next batch of files you want to download.

Note on MP3 listening. You can start listening to MP3 files even if they are not fully complete. You can do it either via going to File tab on torrent program and double click on any file that has at least one dark blue block, which means it has been fully downloaded and saved to disk. That will automatically open your player and will start playing whatever blocks that file has downloaded up to now.

Another way is to right mouse click on a torrent in a Jobs list, and select ""Open Containing Folder"" option from the popup menu. That will open an explorer window and from there you can navigate to one of files and double click on it to play it."
