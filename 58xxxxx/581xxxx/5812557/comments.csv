,ninjazx,2010-09-17T11:42Z,"DONT download this. 

My AV progrma detects it as a Trojan:

spr/tool.wpakill.b.7"
,ToonPal,2010-09-23T01:15Z,"This is not a virus.  It's just that some anti-virus programs blacklist programs that defeat piracy countermeasures or other mischievous traits.  I have a thumb drive on which I keep Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder which retrieves the Windows product key and product keys of other installed programs.  When I once stuck that thumb drive into a friend's computer, his Norton instantly scrubbed it off!  At least NOD32 Anti-virus lets you choose whether or not to delete a program or to de-blacklist select programs so your vast collection of hacker toys doesn't suddenly vanish into thin air."
,Jessiejj,2010-09-30T16:57Z,"I love you Thumper! Thank you.. you saved me from pulling out the last hair on my head. I have one question though, you said it does nothing to the validation.. does this mean that MS can still run a check and see it's not activated or properly licensed?"
,bowzee,2010-10-13T16:33Z,"Vicious trojan, shows up as a new file after the you execute the activator."

,sitesida,2010-11-14T13:12Z,worked on my win7 64bit
,Figmo,2010-11-25T00:32Z,"Works for activating Win7 x64 and getting updates - BUT cannot install Microsoft Security Essentials.  It says ""not a genuine copy of Windows"", so this will not pass all MS genuine checks."

,dorsman,2011-02-19T21:37Z,"works great but for some reason one day my tag at the bottom of the screen ""This copy of windows is not genuine"" came back.  Everything works fine except for this tag being there.  I put the wat back and re-removed it but its still there.  Does anyone know how to get rid of this?"
,toenail77,2011-02-20T14:36Z,"tag at the bottom of the screen ""This copy of windows is not genuine"" 

happens after SP1 install

we need an updated Remove Wat"
,stubbieaussi,2011-02-23T22:06Z,"Same here.
After updating to SP1 you are unable to remove the ""This copy of windows is not genuine"" watermark at the bottom of the screen.
None of the watermark removers currently on the net gets rid of it either.

Please post if you find a solution......I feel dirty."
,12alpha,2011-03-02T13:17Z,"Go to Start > Control Panel > System.
As soon as the system page is selected, the
watermark disappears from the screen for about 12 hours. This works every time for me but I would obviously  like to remove it permanently.
Waiting for some clever guy to come up with a
solution."
,sovyet,2011-03-06T10:46Z,"The best advice I have for those of you having trouble with Service Pack 1?  Uninstall it until a method of removing the new WAT (or whatever the issue may be now) comes along.  I'm doing it right now...damn the service packs, full steam ahead!"
,agapimou26,2011-03-13T07:56Z,"restore WAT, use the daz loader, do NOT download the latest 1.2 mb kb971033 update, works for me!!!"

,12alpha,2011-03-24T21:45Z,"After uninstalling SP1 I got a black screen on every bootup but was able to set a wallpaper which had the watermark and also windows limitations. Downloaded and run Chew-WGA 0.9
from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5422028/Chew-WGA_0.9
And it worked a treat- no black screen, Windows activated and no watermark."
,hakanmutlu,2011-03-30T23:15Z,it works perfectly. Also it is virus free. thank you so much

Percebi no entanto que diversos deles na verdade reconheceram o removedor de WAT, e por isso o alertaram.  


É mesmo um vírus?
Removido o wat, eu ainda posso instalar manualmente atualizações que considerar importante, ou não é recomendado?"

tried a few of other windows loaders, none worked. dont remember the names.
