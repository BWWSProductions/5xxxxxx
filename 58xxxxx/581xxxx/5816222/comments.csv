You may be right about Rambo  and American movies but you must remember ;

This Particular movie I uploaded is  based on true events that unfolded in June 27, 1976, after the highjack of an airplane carrying Jewish passengers heading for Tel Aviv. Israel. No country has ever carried out a tactical military maneuver from 2000 km away.

Americans tried the same but failed completely when their Embassy was taken over by the Iranian Militia in late seventies.
Movies based on true events does send a message though i condemn Israeli politics,bloodshed,suppression and human right violations in occupied areas of Palestine

does that make sense ?"
,pirateradiorocks,2011-05-25T18:08Z,"@ everybody   Sure hope the .srt works okay for those of you who asked for it.  A fellow at immortalseed provided the .srt and it seemed to sink up with my vlc player just fine.  I was shocked!!  My apologies for the delay in getting back, but it has been tornado alley around here these last couple weeks. 

@ajkalla  Thank you for the upload.  The recent 'stealth' helicopter loss in bin Laden raid (right or wrong) highlights risks in such operations.
