where is the fuckin serial code????

impossible to install the game if there is no serial !!"
,Unknown_Creature,2010-11-21T19:38Z,I can't find the serial either.......
,ViviBlckMage,2010-11-22T06:34Z,You don't need a serial. Run the 'steambackup.exe' file located at the root of the disc image. Then tell it where you want it installed.
,Unknown_Creature,2010-11-22T17:25Z,When?? If i run the steambackup it disapears after i said where to instal....
,Charlie117,2011-01-11T03:37Z,"ok so with the lack of comments i had to risk and try it for myself, and it works perfectly

1 download
2 mount and run iso
3 some installer with bad music comes in
4 select where you want to install it, be sure to select it because i kept clicking continue and it went nowhere
5 it installs, then open iso, copy and paste crack files (ruse and steamapi.dll) in the games original folder, you might want to back up the original files...
play...

if it doesnt sart when you select the iso (step3),
open it with right click, and select steambackup, then continue with step 4

no serial needed. works awesome, thanks!"
