,rhos22,2010-10-03T10:30Z,"Hi all,

Unforunately I was hoping this copy would be a good verison, it is not.  While you can activate it, it eventually (for me 7 days) realizes IT IS NOT GENUINE.  

Now no biggie right?  Cuz you can get a patch to remove that annoyaning message.  But Windows  7 then slows your computer down and at times makes it in operatable.

Examples are Windows Explorer lagging, Internet ocassionally locks for 10 seconds, and cpu use can go to 20 percent of its max preformance.

Microsoft ran into too many issues with its previous plan to reboot Windows 7 non genuine every 2 to 4 hours.  Its changed now to use variable amount of CPU, Serial, Video, capacity.

Google yourself : Not Genuine Slow

here examples

There Isn't Any Problem With This Windows Installation. You Must Have Downloaded And Installed The Dreaded (KB971033) Windows Update For Windows 7 Activation Technologies. If You Make That Windows Update Hidden And DO NOT INSTALL That 1 Windows Update. Your Windows Installation Will Be 100% Genuine. I've Had The Windows 7 Ultimate 64 Bit Version For Over Half A Year. And Havn't Had Any Problems With It. It Is Still Genuine, And Passes Any Mirosoft Genuine Advantage Validation Software."
,jhernandez305,2010-10-18T10:13Z,what if i dont do a clean installation?
[T],Computer-User,2010-10-20T05:06Z,"""jhernandez305""

If You Don't Do A Clean Install You Should See A Folder Containing Old Operating System Files I Do Believe. But I Always Reccomend Doing A Clean Install (Format Existing Operating System) :)"

I was just wondering, because wouldn't SP1 include ""The Dreaded (KB971033) Windows Update For Windows 7 Activation Technologies"" and therefore make it not genuine?"
