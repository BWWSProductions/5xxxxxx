Release Notes:
Got this line over the weekend. Boy was this a bitch to sync. A couple small missing scenes.  I was forced to watch
the movie while I was syncing it, I kinda liked it, nothing big missing. The device that was used was replaced because
when it was done recording I listened, was recording loud which caused a bit of clipping. I fixed 99% of the clipping,
it's pretty decent line, 5.1 source, spent quite a bit of money on new equipment. Used uncs video for the release. 
Enjoy the first TeleSync of Despicable Me in the scene. //iNK
