,VampireKitty,2010-09-19T13:02Z,"It's got a creepy atmosphere but it's not about combat like Silent Hill, it's more about solving some tasks and some of them require some thinking. I haven't really played through all of it myself, I was kinda in the middle of it but then got a new laptop, on which I haven't installed it yet. BTW, the game is originally in Russian (this version is English), and the translations are far from perfect. It's OK to understand and everything, but if you're sensitive about the language, it might bother you. The community is currently working on a better, non-official translation though."
