You have over 9000 photo sets that I'm even ashamed to look at the descriptions of, let alone plaster my good name upon their pages.

Seriously, shadowyad, I wish you had a girlfriend for the sake of all men everywhere. Having this amount of dedication to photos of celebrities that Women's Health would run as covers isn't right."
