This is the old, 90's Crystal Rainforest by Sherston Software, not the new one.

From what I understand it's designed to help teach kids the basics of maths and ICT.

I will be seeding for 12 hours every day, midnight to midday in British Time. Any more than that has the tendency to make my internet connection very slow/disconnect a lot - sorry!
