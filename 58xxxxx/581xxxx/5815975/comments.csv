,retarded_player,2011-09-12T16:29Z,"I'm having some problems when i'm trying to make Keil use the settings from a ""TOOLS.ini"" file. 

Components, Environment and Books/ ""Folders/Extension""/- use settings from TOOLS.INI

I'm wondering if you have programmed Keil to read a specific ""TOOLS.ini"", which is contained within the ""Keil uVision4.exe""?

EXCEPTION 0021H: PATH OR FILE NOT FOUND
FILE: C:KEILC51LIBL51_BANK.OBJ
