
This is one of the last appearances of Stacey Grainger, 
since actor Don Quine soon quit (??) this series after 2 years. 
Even though this episode centers on Stacey, he doesn't 
leave Shiloh and there is one more episode "The Decision" 
in which he has a small part.

A minor note: The copyright date shown on this episode 
MCMLXV (which would be 1965) is incorrect. It should 
have read MCMLXVIII, since this episode is clearly from 1968.

Featuring John Bryant as Doc Spalding 
Guest Star: Robert H. Harris as Dr. Andrews
