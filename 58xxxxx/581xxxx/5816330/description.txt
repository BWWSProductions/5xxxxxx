I am very pleased to bring you, a very special dvd, of some very hard to find pieces of stand up comedy!





John Leguizamo's Sexaholix





This dvd was included with a three disc set i purchased.  John Leguizamo's FREAK was the main title in triple pack.

I have already released FREAK on the pirate bay (http://thepiratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3284560).  The 

third dvd in the triple pack was labeled as a bonus dvd and is a show called "BRAVO Profiles" which this episode

is about John Leguizamo.  this bonus dvd will be released on the pirate bay soon. but enough about the other discs!

John Leguizamo's Sexaholix (a love story) [2002] - http://imdb.com/title/tt0318062/



(taken from imdb.com)

 In this one-man stage show, John Leguizamo acts out scenes from his past family life, touching on his 

relationships with his mother and father, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles, and his wife and children. 

He shares with us the lessons he's learned from his life experiences. I can't imagine there are too many people 

who couldn't relate to some of them. At times it's so intimate that it's hard to watch, but at other times it's

incredibly moving. And of course, it's funny. Mr. Leguizamo is so talented, it's a crime that he doesn't get 

better film roles. Hopefully, that will change soon.
