Star Wars: Clone Wars â€“ Vol. 1 (2003)

This is Volume 1 of the 2D, hand-drawn clone wars series from 03/04. It is a collection of five min. short stories that add up to make an awesome Star Wars movie. This is not the crappy 3D clone wars cartoon that came out recently. George Lucas had nothing to do with this one except signing off the license. If you are like me and you hate the new movies, you will still like this series. Volume 2 to follow if this one is popular. Enjoy, and don't forget to SEED!
