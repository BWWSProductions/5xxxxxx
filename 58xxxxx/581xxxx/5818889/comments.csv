[T],zombifuzz,2010-09-13T07:30Z,my little brother wanted me to thank you for this.  he has everything you could possibly imagine that has to do with star wars except this.  he wants to know if this is the only disc for vol1 & how many other volumes there are.  also if you will be upping them too.  i want to thank you too for this because it made him really happy.  i seed ctang/seedkey/tater44 dvds to a 30:1 ratio.  about 100GBs i give back.  hope to hear from you soon.

There are 2 volumes, both have 1 disc each.  I actually tried several times to upload volume 2 this afternoon, but it just went to a white screen after I filled in the Capcha and clicked Upload.  No idea what went wrong, but I will try uploading it again tomorrow.  It is all ready to go, but TPB website wont accept it for some reason.

Tell your bro I will have volume 2 up as soon as the site lets me, and I hope he enjoys them as much as I do.  And thanks for seeding!"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-09-13T09:58Z,"thank you very much for the response.  i can see you are going to be a well known uploader sooner than later.  i tried uploading an album today & i got the same problem you did.  something must be up with the site. the only difference is, i dont need to put the capcha in any more (VIP, thank god. i hated it).  hopefully they sort this out because i have an addiction to uploading haha."
