Test it before publish as publicly. "
,dinodig,2010-12-13T12:09Z,"ITS WORKING PERFECTLY!!!!!!!!!!!
But there is one mistake in the Installation notes;
""6. Copy everything in the update folder
7. Go to the installation folder of Whitecap (Default: C:\\Program Files\\Whitecap\\)
8. Go to the \""home\"" folder. (in the installation folder)
9. Paste everything. (You have to overwrite everything)
""

Trust me, if you do this ""IT JUST WONT WORK"".
Just install it, disable automatic updates and use it. "

Thats what I'm talking about. So nobody can use the updated version. u have to use the 5.05 version.
Then what's the point of saying this ""Whitecap 5.0.5 Platinum with stuff from 5.30 ""?"
,bluebear_708,2012-01-03T20:08Z,"Hi,
Can you fix Aeon?"
,gordo109,2012-03-24T02:04Z,"Yes, if you could get Aeon that would be amazing! Thanks for this, works well."
,tom282f3,2012-06-14T16:28Z,"!!!THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT YOU SHOULD WATCH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LIMITED TO TRAIL VERSION!!!

1. Start>WhiteCap>WhiteCap Standalone.
2. Click [H] on your keyboard, then [SHIFT]+[C] for no more secretly checking, just like I was.(I use the instructions in this torrent and so I've been limited, but I reinstalled it. :P)"
