,x7thdayx,2010-09-08T19:43Z,1080p and it's not even 3 1/2 GB's? Quality couldn't be that great..
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-09-08T19:45Z,"Audio Tracks ( all demuxed, download the one you want)
Use MPC (  http://cccp-project.net/   ) to be able to automatically recognize and play the external Audio tracks or mux the Audio in MKV with mkvmerge (   http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix  ) if you wish to use other player.

Movie is only 2.24 GB. See this torrent at AhaShare for more info."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-09-08T20:05Z,"Size-queens shouldn't underestimate the power of x264 especially with very high encoding settings In this case:
 : cabac=1 / ref=5 / deblock=1:-1:1 / subme=9 / psy=1 /me_range=32 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=2 / 8x8dct=1 / bframes=5 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=2 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=3800 /
40 Hours on a Quad processor pc. 
In fact this rip looks less pixaleted then the original without loosing details (deblock=1:-1:1 ).
If a file is too big is a problem, if too small not good either. Most of the rips I've seen around are made under lower encoding quality settings, especially those made for PS3. Only 3800 KB/s because the source is not that great, 4200-4500 for the clear pictured Blue-rays. 
And yes, you need powerful pc & graphic card to be able to play it. "

,Dadatron,2011-07-22T18:51Z,"Nice torrent, i merge the audio with mkv file using mkvmerge and got excellent results. The spanish subtitles are messed up but nothing that i cant resolve. Thank you and greetings from Colombia. ;)"
,Otik,2012-01-23T23:45Z,"hey thetruesong, fuck you!! I've learnt how to play mkv files but you'll always be an ashole."
,smerte,2012-03-23T16:07Z,"Thanks for this upload, I loved it, especially with the multisubs!!!!!
Now, I'll have some fun with mkvmerge... :o


Well, Otik, I pointed my friend to a program who plays everything with subtitles. But why should I supply you with this information since you're the one behaving like a asshole?

You can search at google, behave yourself or complain further. Your choice.  Life is too precious for such stuff."
