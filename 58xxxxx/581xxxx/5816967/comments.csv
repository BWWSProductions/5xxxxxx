,azrash,2012-01-01T22:48Z,"thanks for supporting guys, it has been more than a year and all your support is much appreciated. if you need more quality encodes, i would recommend checking 300mbunited releases, they have been releasing good quality encodes at small size.

 i am not affiliated in any way with them, most of my release are made because there are my favourites and i would love to share quality encode with the rest"
,LackThereof,2012-01-12T03:31Z,"Almost awesome, but the bitrate is just a hair too low, and there's noticeable artifacting.  

You'd be better off with a crisp SD version than an artifacted HD one, I think.  If it had been at just a slightly higher bitrate or slightly lower resolution, it probably would have been fine."
,azrash,2012-01-27T06:29Z,"@LackThereof

thanks, i would try to do a better one next time. so far, my best work is 500 days of summer and the shooter, i will try to maintain the good standard and get a better source next time"
