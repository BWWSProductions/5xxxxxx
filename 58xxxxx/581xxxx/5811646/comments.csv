[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-09-05T17:50Z,"@ everyone - I am getting ready for church, but I will leave my 1 of my desktops encoding Covert Affairs S01E07-E08, White Collar S02E01-E08, Rizzoli and Isles S01E01-E08, Robocop Trilogy, and a couple of other things.

@ penguin1-1 - I will do futurama s1-5, but it will take some time. BTW, I test everything on 3 of my PSPs, before I upload it. So all of my stuff will work on PSPs. I will do Burn Notice S04 (HDTV-Rips) and Royal Pains S02 (HDTV-Rips) first, then I will do Royal Pains S01 and Burn Notice S01-03."

@ penguin1-1 - As soon as season 2 of Misfits starts I will do it, I think it starts next month. I will upload the latest episodes of Covert Affair and all White Collar S02 episodes that have aired in a day or so, when the torrents above and some other are well seeded.  (^_^)

@ megaeddd - The only copies available of Inception are Telesyncs, they are watchable on a small screen. If you really want me to encode 1 of the Telesyncs, I would.  (^_^)  But, as soon as a VHS-SCR, DVDSCR, BR-SCR, PPV-Rip, Telecine, R5, DVDRip, or BRRip becomes available, I will definitely do it. (^_^)

@ Movieman17 - I will be glad to do The Sleeping Dictionary, I will download it in a day or so.  The source will be -   http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3901462/The_Sleeping_Dictionary_%282003%29/ 

@ hellobye - If I can get them, I will do them. I will let you know in 1 of my newer torrents.

@ One_Burnt_Potato - Yep, Scarlett Johansson is F%$king hot! I would eat her ass out! LOL! "
