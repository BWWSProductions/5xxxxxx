so by my count 20 people downloaded this torrent fully, yet none of them helped seed.
i would appreciate some thoughts on this torrent from those who download it. should i keep it alive?
now, i can not seed 24/7 all the time, but i will not let it die. i will be seeding all day long, from 9am to 9pm. btw i am gmt+2."
,Iron_Yuppie,2011-02-09T06:02Z,Could someone please help seed this. It's the best quality encode on the internet as far as I can find.

Thanks."
,misha0209,2011-04-01T16:16Z,"i am still seeding this (alone mostly), but i get to see upload speeds of 2MB/s, so if it is slow the problem is on your end, or somewhere between the 2 of us... sorry...
i will seed like all day long, for gmt+2 time, so be online when i am."
