NEON_GENESIS_EVANGELION_TV[platinum]+MOVIES[renewal][h.264_5.1ac3]

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I relly like the series, but i was anoyed that there were no good encodes of it (best i could find are zx) so i decided to go ahead and make my own.
finding sources was hard, but thanks go out to Gianni86 of tntvillage who posted the original discs of the TV series (platinum edition)-DVD9
i chose to encode using a crf of 15 because that was the point where i could not tell my encodes from the original videos.
if someone wants to do styled subs on this release, and time them better i would be verry glad.
this has no orderd chapters, i just put a clean intro in the batch for the heck of it :D
i added an ost video i found on one of the discs, it's in 5.1 ac3 @ 448kbps.
my uplod bandwidth is 512kbps. i will try to seed 24/7 untill there are at least 5 sedds.
hope you enjoy, and pls help with the seeding :p

TV

 Video:
 -h.264, encoded with CRF15.
 -source PAL: 720x576 @ 25fps (resolution and framerate are a bit higher than in ntsc-720x480 @ 23.976-)
 -the source was PROGRESSIVE, i did not do any deinterlacing.
 -the source was italian so the intro and outro text is in italian. no other changes to the video.
 -i did not crop, because i did not want to loose any frame info, and keep mod16 resolution.
 -i set the display aspect ratio to 1.34(772x576), this way, i see the movie as wide as it should be on 16:9 monitor
 
 Audio:
 -ac3 5.1 @ 384kbps.
 -this is the original audio, i only muxed it (i did NOT recode).
 -i only muxed the japanese audio (the other track was italian but to me as far as anime goes, japanese audio, with subtitles is how it should be).
 -episodes 20 and 26 (i think) have english commentary.

 Subtitles:
 -Translated by Wada Mitsuhito (Wada-kun)
  Timed by: Todd Perkins
  Edited by: Todd Perkins, Hiroaki Fukuda, Dave
 -i did not style.
 -the subs were made for 23.976fps, i used subtitle workshop to retime them for 25fps, and used delay option when muxing to make them just about right.
that is to say i did not carefully time them so they are not perfect.

Movies

 Video:
 -h.264, encoded with CRF15.
 -source NTSC: 720x480 @ 23.976
 -the source was PROGRESSIVE, i did not do any deinterlacing.
 -i did not crop THE END OF EVANGELION, beacause i did not want to loose frame info (yes there are black bars on the sides, if you do not like them simply hit numpad 6 when playing if you use MPC).
 -i cropped the hell out of DEATH TRUE2 because the source was odd(still the best one i could find), there are thin black bars all around the video because i did not want to dig into the frame.

 Audio:
 -ac3 5.1 @ 448kbps.
 -this is the original audio, i only muxed it (i did NOT recode).

 Subtitles:
 -i got them from the ZX versions.
