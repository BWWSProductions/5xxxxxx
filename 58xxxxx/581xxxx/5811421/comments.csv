,Lype,2010-09-05T23:05Z,"Well... From the screenshots to judge, the text doesn't look too good to me. Here are the problems:

The text is not white, the text is not a standard font and the background seems to be blurry."
,SUBURBANmisfit,2010-09-06T00:03Z,Well yer it's the iJUGGA source iv just blurred out the the original subs and redone them in english because all the other copies had to much text all over the screen and it just looked to cluttered.
