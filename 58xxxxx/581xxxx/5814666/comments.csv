http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5815045

More about xPUD here: 
http://www.xpud.org/

It's extremely fast and a fast alternative to get to the internet as quick as possible if you have a XP system that never seems to start. It can also be downloaded from http://www.xpud.org/ but it can sometimes be painfully slow (but test it if the torrent is  slow)."
