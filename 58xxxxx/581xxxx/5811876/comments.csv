,leracos,2010-09-20T14:59Z,"One question; English subs, included/accurate? The downloadable ones are from what I heard not that great.

Thanks, this was recommended by a fellow foreign film lover."
,pesmaniac,2010-12-14T17:31Z,Thanks a LOT mate.
,aghababak,2011-02-27T10:01Z,its funny how noone mentioned the AV rating...is this a scam?
,MaximilianKohler,2011-03-23T06:01Z,"damn it, quality sucks ._.

A/V: 7/7"
,vhg,2011-07-12T16:00Z,let me check the quality
,onion513,2011-10-26T17:35Z,This is NOT in 720p...... DVD quality at best
,naz.houie,2012-05-02T13:25Z,"Horrible quality.. No way is this a real 720p encoding. I have seen some excellent 720p's ranging in size from 500 MB to 800 MB, depending on movie duration, so 712 MB should have been more than enough for this movie had its source been a real 1080p or at least a 720p with higher bitrate. This rip was probably up-scaled from a lower 480p copy.
A=5, V=5."
