Back in the mid 90's a band called Cymonic Drive featured Dan now in the band Madhops on bass and Dennis AKA D-hauz now ex-20 Dead Flower Children on vocals. While another band called Skumbag featured Steve now of Taproot on drums and Mike now of Taproot on guitar, one day these bands played a gig together and both took interest in each others band. After a few conversations the 4 members dissolved their current bands and got together to form Taproot.
