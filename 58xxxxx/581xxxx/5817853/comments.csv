,cweb512,2010-09-11T01:01Z,At the very beginning of installation you are asked if you want to update the product before installing. Will this render the serial unusable. 
,FantomLord,2010-09-11T06:28Z, it updates just fine even  after installation
,gailyguy,2010-09-11T17:39Z,Its working perfectly... thanks team...

,FantomLord,2010-09-12T20:59Z,"@Mario82368 the serial is on the first disc in a notepad file

@Ganddi if it took you a week you must have a very slow connection because even at 300kbps you can get this in a couple hours"

I have the same problem as you. I am running Win 7 x64."

@trm96

this had actually been a problem for some on previous versions First thing make sure you run the setup .exe as administrator if that doesnt work...

  1.  Go to your computer's Start menu > Control Panel.

   2. Windows XP: Select Add or Remove Programs.
      Windows Vista: Under Programs, click Uninstall a program.

   3. Uninstall ""Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1"".

   4. Once this process is complete, reinstall Creator 2011.

If the steps above do not resolve the issue, you may try the following steps.

   1. Open My Computer (or Computer for Vista users) from your Start menu.

   2. Go to C: drive -> Windows folder -> System32 folder.

   3. Look for a file called dsetup.dll in the System32 folder.

   4. Rename the file to ""dsetupOLD.dll"" or delete the file.

   5. Reinstall Creator 2011 and follow the on-screen instructions.

you may also need to uninstall dirextX"
,tenor54,2010-09-17T03:30Z,"Thanks Fantomlord. Tried all of your suggestions and installation is still interrupted. Looks like a no-go for this Vista 64 user. Glad I didn't buy the retail package, as it's likely plagued by the same issues. I did buy 2010 version earlier, and like it just fine."

I get around it by using the applications but the whole reason I downloaded this was for the DVD burning (I was surprised that it was a really cool set of tools) and when I go to burn it gives me an error message everytime. The other applications work great as far as I know."

,Infested_Dave,2010-10-06T03:33Z,"I AM VERY VERY UNSITISIFIED WITH THIS RELEASE!  I AM VERY GLAD THAT I DID NOT GO PURCHASE IT WITHOUT TRYING IT FOR FREE FIRST.  

I want everyone to know that the program work very very well, you CAN update it online, and the serial included DOES STILL work as valid.  

The reason I'm unhappy it this.   I've installed it TWICE.  I run windows XP Professional.  Everything is UP-TO-DATE (eg. DirectX, .Net Runtime, All windows updates)

Like I said, I've installed it twice. The first time I installed it, it ran perfectly, but it broke my Windows Media Player 11.  I tryed EVERYTHING to fix Media player, and nothing would work, so I formatted..  

After re-installing windows, I re-installed Roxio, and THEN I up-dated windows from their site.  Still, Roxio has broken my Media Player.  I can go to Microsoft's site, and download the player and re-install it, and nothing works!!   

WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL USERS- BEWARE."
