,WooHooFreeStuff,2010-09-27T00:25Z,"Hi, if i download these from zophar and place the zip in the download destination for this torrent, will i be able to seed it as part of this torrent? I'd love to help out"
,WooHooFreeStuff,2010-09-27T00:34Z,Woah! totally works! uploading man!! bout 125 kbps 
,kotenu,2010-09-27T01:29Z,"I was hoping that would work, hence my reason for not changing the data in any way.  If you're interested, initial seeding has me about half-way through the roms (alphabetically) so you will be popular if you join with complete versions of games in the second half of the list.

Thanks for your help WooHooFreeStuff."
,WooHooFreeStuff,2010-09-27T17:29Z,done deal =]
,kotenu,2010-10-20T00:59Z,"I managed to completely distribute the data a week ago and since then several people have reached 100% and left the swarm.  I've now switched from 'inital seed' mode to plain seed mode.  Now is a good time for those of you who just want to download a few roms to join the swarm.

As always, I'm grateful to anyone who can upload a little more than they download."
,kotenu,2010-10-27T12:22Z,"It did take a very long time.  Zophar is an excellent rom resource but its server(s) have been suffering under the weight of its popularity.  I hope this torrent helps to reduce this effect.

I plan to seed this for another 9 months at least and I'm really grateful to other long-term seeds (I'm assuming your harddrive is not on its last legs YoungDaddyTC :D).

Massive bonus points if you ever manage to upload twice the total download.  Not only would you pay for yourself but you'd approximately add a whole extra copy into the swarm, essentially creating a virtual seeder!"
,shockingbehaviour,2010-11-11T00:06Z,"I just wanted to say THANKYOU, and to say WOW at the size/amount of roms here!

I cannot possibly fit 371Gb on my pc, but I am downloading about 20Gb of mainly big named games and will continue to seed until they come and take away my computer haha!"
,kotenu,2010-11-11T12:53Z,"Thank you very much shockingbehaviour.  I'm glad this torrent is attractive to people looking to seed just a few roms.

I believe we will all benefit from pooling our resources with a single torrent.  I also think we are each safer from the point of view of law enforcement than we would be sharing roms in individual torrents.

Long may we live."
,SaltSlasher,2010-11-24T12:24Z,"I found the best thing is to go through and pick your favorite, because I could easily take 200gb off and still have a treasure chest.
So I will leave it seeding, even though I didn't dl all the games.
I want to go and buy a 500gb hd, just for this.lol
It would be the coolest thing ever. A HD that is pretty much a brand new PSX w/ every game!"
,Snuffish,2010-12-01T01:28Z,"I'm downloading a couple games, for this round, just waiting for my new HDD, then i will download this whole torrent, and i will seed as much as i can and more! =)
Thanks for a super great upload!"
,kotenu,2010-12-02T13:26Z,"I'm extremely grateful to all seeders, whether you are seeding just a single rom or the entire set!  Those who are sharing only a small collection of popular roms are being very helpful because this takes some pressure off of ""complete seeds"" which can then focus on being rare rom distribution specialists.

As always, the important thing is to upload a little more than you download to grow the torrent.

Hopefully, by making it easy for anyone to obtain Playstation roms, there will be renewed interest in Playstation emulation!

Long may we live."
,ChupacabraSquirrel,2010-12-03T20:45Z,"Am going to download one to three at a time till all is complete... Therefor, as I upload, I'll have complete files for peeps elsewhere. Hoping I'll be able to seed when I am completely done. :-)"
,ChupacabraSquirrel,2010-12-09T03:34Z,Slowly but surely am getting closer to being a seeder on this torrent myself... Yay !
,ChupacabraSquirrel,2010-12-11T20:57Z,"Sadly, as of December 11, 2010, these roms aren't available through Zophar anymore... Thus, I wil continue to upload as much and more than I download and help us all keep these wonderful ROMS from disappearing forever."
,manicstonewall,2010-12-17T23:25Z,It's going to take me about 20 weeks to finishing downloading all of this.  Keep it going and I promise I'll seed it in it's entirety for a year.  This is a great collection.
,ChupacabraSquirrel,2010-12-18T08:31Z,"Download Average: 25.9kb/s
Upload Average: 112.4 kb/s

What gives, no-one else uploads ???"
,kotenu4,2010-12-18T16:36Z,"Despite my best efforts, I've been unable to login to my usual account for the last 2 weeks and have had great difficulty creating a new account, probably to do with configuring TOR correctly.  I don't expect this account will last very long either.

I'm sad to hear that zophar.net has decided to stop hosting the commercial playstation roms (among other romsets) but if they feel they need to do this to protect themselves then I believe it is the right decision.  I'll do my best to keep this torrent healthy for as long as I can."
,kotenu4,2010-12-19T14:52Z,"Thank you ChupacabraSquirrel for maintaining an incredible upload ratio, I only wish you could get hold of the files you want faster.  I'm very grateful for your help in making this torrent healthy.  Try not to be disheartened by the selfish behaviour of some peers; for every 5 or so parasites (peers who download faster than they upload and then leave the swarm with a ration less than 1!) you'll find an honest peer who will pay back to the swarm in full and will be very grateful to you for your efforts.

I've wanted to say this for weeks!  I'm having serious problems writing comments here."
,Ghunter43,2010-12-20T22:56Z,"371.48 GB? shit, how the hell im supposed to get all that free space?"
,ChupacabraSquirrel,2010-12-22T08:38Z,"Ghunter43, two options: Delete files you don't want or go get another hard drive. (1TB can be had for around $100)"
,paddy0815,2011-01-03T16:46Z,Is this the biggest torrent here?
,kotenu4,2011-01-13T13:38Z,"My torrent client has been down for a week; someone shut down my computer while I was away.  I've just bought it back online.  On the plus side I've recently gotten some more upload bandwidth and am now uploading at 420KiB/s.

This was the biggest torrent here when I uploaded it but I don't know if that's still the case.  It was 23rd largest on the web according to bitsnoop but has dropped a few places since then.

Long may we live."
,Blood_Beard,2011-01-17T09:57Z,Thanks for the torrent dude i really appreciate it. And by the way im uploading at 500kbp/s to 1mbp/s :D
,kotenu4,2011-01-19T19:10Z,"You're welcome Blood_Beard and thank you for directing that rather serious lump of bandwidth our way.  Between us we manage nearly 5Mb/s which is about one rom every 8 mins!

It seems I owe thanks to many of you in fact.  With 7 complete seeds this torrent is looking pretty healthy and stable.  Thank you all for your support!

Long may we live."
,Tyonidas,2011-01-30T14:09Z,This is worse than waiting for christmas as a kid!  At 23% total done so far and I leave my computer on 24/7 so people can upload from me.  Lets get some more people in here to keep this file alive.  Would be a complete shame to let this masterpiece die.  :)
,oojoe26,2011-02-01T11:37Z,Should I unzip and then open the .bin file in the emulator? or will the .rar be compatiable?
,kotenu4,2011-02-01T14:09Z,"Whether or not to manually decompress a file before running it very much depends on the system and emulator you are using.  I have plenty of space (nearly 10 TiB) so I keep everything decompressed for simplicity.  If an emulator will run a '.rar' directly then it is simply using a system library to decompress the rar and then running the resulting rom; there should be no performance loss or gain.

One related tip: Sometimes the read speed of the medium containing the rom can make a big difference to emulation.  I initially had problems trying to run FF8 in Linux (psx-1.13) on a 900MHz notebook.  It turned out the SSD was too slow and copying the rom to a ramdisk solved virtually all of those issues giving me practically flawless emulation.

Tyonidas: I honestly think this torrent is very healthy given its size and contents and it's not going to die anytime soon.  If you are trying to get a full copy (rather than just a few roms) and you have say less than say 512kbps of upload then you will just have to be patient."
,Kasharicdaims,2011-02-01T19:30Z,"Just wanted to say i'm only downloading 8 - 9 of these games but i will never stop seeding them.
awesome torrent, keep up the good work :D"
,mrolie,2011-02-04T04:52Z,"Wahoo 1.6% in 2 weeks come on baby! Awesome torrent anyway kotenu, cant wait till 2012 to play em! ill seed for good afterwards :)"
,93mitsu,2011-02-15T13:38Z,DOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! I RECEIVED COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT DUE TO THIS TORRENT
,Kasharicdaims,2011-02-15T20:20Z,"So far i have downloaded a total of 867MB of the 5.28Gig i'm downloading. and i have uploaded 2.34Gig..... its a slow download for me it seems, but well worth it. i'm currently playing through Vagrant Story and it works like a charm. Love this torrent sooooo much :D"
,kotenu4,2011-02-18T18:33Z,"93mitsu: Could you give us any further information?

Is the copyright infringement notice you recieved genuine?

If so, which particular roms are you accused of infringing the copyright on and on what date were you accused of comitting said infringement?  Without this basic information and given the all-caps format I'm going to assume that this post is just intended to scare potential peers off.

Are you using encryption? DHT? PeerGuardian/moblock? Did you obtain the original .torrent file using a magnet link or through TOR/i2p?  Are you using a proxy?  Are you a citizen of the USA?  (Obviously don't give information here that you fear could be used to identify you).

Of course, I intend to continue to share this data 24/7.

Long may we live."
,XP2014,2011-02-18T20:56Z,I've been seeding this for about a month with a .73 ratio and will continue as long as people don't hit and run. I've seen a lot of 90%+ peers leave the swarm without uploading after they completed.  Please seed for a few weeks at least. Thanks for the upload kotenu.
,allsuited,2011-03-06T10:50Z,hey kotenu can u just email me the file???
,kotenu4,2011-03-06T14:45Z,Unfortunately I'm having some bandwidth issues right now.  Ask me again in 2035. :)
,cmdhockey12,2011-03-12T08:43Z,Just started this torrent and picked a bunch of games I've owned from my childhood but lost and am dying to play. Getting upload speed's of about 200-400kb/s. I'll stick around for a long time with this torrent.

,cyfa89,2011-04-02T17:20Z,"kotenu
many thanks, truly awesome
i was d/ling individual roms until i found this B)
had it on here since christmas last year, almost 3 weeks solid of it being on!
im only taking 40gb or so of a truly expansive collection (i think i have 120 or so)
if i like a torrent or see that it doesnt have many seeds, i stay on. this i will always seed!
i like how you comment on your torrent, its good, many dont which can be annoying.
i got to around 97% the other day but found a few more games! so im back around 94%
upload ratio isnt so good though (currently got .09 but will keep going)
i only get about 40kbs upload though
download speed has varied greatly, i guess that depends on which file is being downloaded at a given time.

im not sure how torrents work fully, but could you add snatchers and policenauts to this one if possible? (MGS kid! :D )"
,cyfa89,2011-04-28T02:08Z,"cant get devil dice to work
