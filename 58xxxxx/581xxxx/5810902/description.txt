This is a bonus sampler disk that is included with some realises of My Chemical Romance's I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love and maybe some other realises by Eyeball Records, I'm not sure.

It has songs from various bands that have recorded with Eyeball Records, see track list below. Having said that, it's hard to determine this CD's genre since each band has a unique sound, but it's mostly one kind or another of rock. This CD is a rather rare realise, however *some* of the tracks on it are more easily available.
