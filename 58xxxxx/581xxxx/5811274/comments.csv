,snilloc,2010-09-04T23:13Z,"@ raymondhome.

Is this possibly better than âIron Man 2 R2 Xvid - CLASSiFiED(READ NOTES)âyou uploaded earlier today ??

I downloaded it and its fantastic quality to my eyes and ears :)

Can this possibly be better??"

,bigough,2010-09-05T19:20Z,"Just Google the subtitles, not that difficult.  Then use this link to learn how to add them permanently to the avi file.

,torrtruk,2010-09-05T20:08Z,"stop asking for subtitles. noir can only provide you the movie. subtitles can be easily searched for, elsewhere. use your search skills before asking here.

and no, there's no point in asking for A/V as Noir/raymondhome are elite uploaders and theirs are usually 8/8 or better. 

Thanks a lot for providing us this movie. Thumbs up!"
,staticghost,2010-09-06T02:42Z,there are lots of seeders with 100% but are not seeding at all... seed you fucking retards!
,tpbcrazy,2010-09-06T23:53Z,"4000 seeders and 11 comments. gr8 going guys. not that i need A/V comment on a raymondhome upload. trust this fucker w/o a trace of doubt. thanx again mate. after aXXo, you are my new hero."
,skozlow,2010-09-07T22:14Z,"No offense, but this is definitely not a DVD rip.  If a cam is a 2/3 and a DVD rip is a 10, this is at most a 6 or 7.  I don't understand why people ever label things a DVD rip if once you download the movie it is quite apparent that it is no where near the quality of a DVD rip.  Stop mis-labeling things, it just makes people distrust your future downloads.

V: 6
A: 7

This is not a DVDRip.  So do not label it as such.
On another note, thank you raymondhome, this is the best quality version out there so far, so kudos to you.  But shame on you for mislabeling it, it does not make you any cooler."
,uberjuice,2010-09-09T04:52Z,"Worst. Upload. Ever. 
Audio 3 (gets loud as hell and distorted as fuck)
Video 3 (CAM release labeled as a DVDrip. also, dim as hell)

At least tell us if something is German. http://thepiratebay.org/user/raymondhome/ speaks about 15 languages anyhow, if you look at his uploads."
,jordan2522,2010-09-09T15:22Z,can someone please tell me how to download subtitles so they match up with the sound in movie ive tried 6 diff subtitle downloads and they are either late or early with the sound by minutes sometimes even thanks
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2010-09-10T06:24Z,People need to check to see if the post has screen shots before they ask for A & V quality comments lol. Looks good to me...thanks
,crazyrat,2010-09-15T17:51Z,A10 V10 excellente
,blkheart,2010-09-19T16:23Z,why is it when burning this the sound is all jacked up?
