,nittany,2010-09-06T09:51Z,"I wish some screen shots were posted before I spend 6.6GB in bandwidth.  

Can anybody comment on the A/V rating?

This is the 1st and right now the only HD copy of this movie currently on piratebay, I hope it's legit and not some HD cam or some crap."

,lillsowi,2010-09-06T10:27Z,"@nittany 
Are you blind or just stupid. 
Because clearly you can't se the purple skull."
,tbone3181,2010-09-06T10:39Z,"Is it just me or is every 720p HD torrent of a new movie getting more and more leechers? A new movie used to be upped and i could download 4.5/6.5GB in a decent time, usually complete the same day....but now every one is like 5 seeds 3000 leechers, takes days"
[V],GoodFilms,2010-09-06T12:00Z,"Yes, they are getting more and more popular because more and more people are discovering how amazing BLURAY is compared to shitty DVD."
,nittany,2010-09-06T12:43Z,"@lillsowi

Trust me, purple skull doesn't mean shit.  I've seen uploaders put up HD cams or upscaled DVD's and claim them as HD.  I trust no one."
,caliwillbemine,2010-09-06T13:31Z,"Wait until they discover the full HD 1080p torrents, compared to this 720p one lol.
Of course size will increase."
,improveurself,2010-09-06T17:06Z,share the fuckin file and SEED!!
,muneeb.abbas3,2010-09-07T03:03Z,How the hell are these torrents available before the announced date.. btw screenshots look good.. its HD.

SEED GUYS"
,Jauert70,2010-09-24T00:41Z,What do i need to play a .mkv file?
,ejuoi1,2010-09-27T19:42Z,WTF. What's up with all the seeders available yet slow download speeds??? I'm averaging 100kb when it should be 1000.
,LanMax,2010-10-04T17:48Z,"Jauert70 - You don't need VLC or google, you just need K-LiteCodec Pack and you can use any players like WMP.

Thanks! Nice Copy.
"
,P149U3,2010-10-05T08:50Z,Come on people if you DL....... SEED for a few days is it that much to ask
,roryt,2010-10-06T03:05Z,WHen is the Top 100 going to get fixed? The Whole 0 peers 0 seeders on every single new torrent started like 2 weeks ago. 
,Bshroom,2010-10-10T19:53Z,"Leechers should be a resource to if you think about it...

Ideally leechers each have many different parts of the file and contribute with what they already have downloaded.

But leechers may cut their upload rate if it APPEARS to hurt their download. So theyll put inn like 100kb for upload. Wich kinda sucks...

A torrent program should take into account lazyness, technical superstition and plain old stupidity when making their setup interfaces.

The human factor is also why I think RARs are a bad idea. People are lazy, selfish and stupid (they'll delete those RARs the second they are done unpacking them, since for them they are just wasted HDD space = seeding fails). Fighting that is a futile battle. So might as well work with the flow, not against it.

While going to school I worked part time at a gas station were we had trash cans. The area would be littered since people were to lazy to walk a few meters. Moving the cans into their path = alot cleaner and less cleaning up to do. Yelling at them or putting up signs were pretty pointless. Same with torrents. You just have to make it easy for people. Plus no RAR = they forget/don't care that the file is there and keep seeding. Thats working WITH lazyness, instead of against it..."
,Shadintel,2010-10-13T14:46Z,"Great quality, good speed! Thanks for the upload. (about leechers: it can't be helped, some people think that UPLOAD could affect DOWNLOAD negatively, when the truth is the whole opposite)"
,kadrikene,2010-10-16T00:55Z,"Very bad seed, taking days to download with my 100/10 internet :S People get a proper broadband!"
,samsicht,2010-10-16T11:33Z,please seed!!!
,TheChosen1_,2010-10-16T22:53Z,"Hi guys.

I want to ask all of u about watching .mkv movies in notebook.When I watch a .mkv 
in my notebook , it seems like a divx or slightly better than it.I know the LCD panel 
of it isnt HD but I just wonder that does it really make a huge difference watching it in 
a 42"" or 46"" LCD or LED TV ?

Thx for ur answers guys.And thx for the movie again."
,Kemedu74,2010-10-26T14:03Z,This movie is crap. It is full of logical flaws and historical incorrectness. The storyline in it self is really boring. If you really want to see a good Robin Hood movie I highly recommend the 1938 version found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5727053/The.Adventures.Of.Robin.Hood.1938.720p.BluRay.x264-CHD
,goalskn,2010-10-27T03:27Z,"absoutely awesome quality ... and a pretty decent movie, i would definetly recomend it ... tho people need to see it more!"
,hoensbroek89,2010-10-30T19:59Z,thnx keep it up :P
,TaZeRz,2010-10-30T22:00Z,I dont understand why you rip the movie this way and say its 720p when its clearly 1280x536 with huge black bars can someone explain to me the reason or the people just dont know how to rip a movie properly?
,SoftWarez,2010-10-31T11:22Z,"You really thought i ripped it? I am just an uploader, ass'ole. Group named AMiABLE did it, bitch with them, not with me. OMG."
,Mercury8215,2010-11-04T00:49Z,"1280x536 is the same wide screen ratio as the movie theater.  And those huge black bars can be cropped out by the media player you use.  But you're not seeing the whole shot whether it's cropped by converter software before hand or you're video player while you play it.  I personally prefer seeing the whole picture that the director intended us too see.  

Maybe you should get a little more computer literate yourself before you go givein people attitude."
,yopepoy,2010-11-16T07:30Z,yes its better to watch 1280x536 than crop it to 1280x720.
,IamDUFF,2010-11-21T08:50Z,"Bshroom, there's also crappy internet. I can dl a mb/s but the most i can possibly upload without any other traffic is 60kb/s.
=/
I'm a bad pirate.
One day i hope to get a better connection and download interesting things only for the sake of seeding them. lol."
,Dk121,2010-11-28T14:45Z,1.6 Mb for me:D...in 1 hour I will get to see the movie...I will seed for you guys....:P:D
,Dk121,2010-11-28T14:47Z,"Oh and btw...720p comes from pixels...the higher the pixel number, the higher the quality...there are diferent resolutions but they are design to meet the specified number of pixels...360, 240, 720, 1080 or God knows what else...at least that's what I think it means...:D"
