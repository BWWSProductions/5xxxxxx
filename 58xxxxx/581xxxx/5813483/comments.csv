Use firewire (IEEE 1394) from cable/satellite box to PC.

BTW, anyone know where I can find episode 8?"
,lydonit13,2010-09-15T16:28Z,"Oh, no I don't think TIVOs have firewire.  They'll have USB ports, which can be hacked for this purpose, at your own risk (Google it).  Standard cable boxes should have firewire ports as output, along with composite, s-video, and/or hdmi ports; but you can only capture live HD signals via firewire.

BTW, I found episode 8 here:
