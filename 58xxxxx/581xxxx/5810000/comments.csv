please help. failing to use the crack."
,yosoyusuario,2010-10-11T00:31Z,"Muchas gracias a Webchela. Ngundu: try to aply crack disconected from internet. If you still have problems, use your firewall. Sometimes, your antivirus detects the crack as virus (false positive), in that case, just ignore it, turn off your antivirus and try again. One more thing, if you are using vista or seven, you should try applying the crack clicking on it with the secundary of the mouse and choose ""execute as administrator"" (or something like that). In some cases, it is neccesary to move the crack to the file/folder where the program is installed and execute the crack in that folder. I hope you find this information useful. Good look  "
