,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-09-05T19:47Z,"is it this ? http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1428459/

if you ( everybody ) look at a torrent and it has no screenshots or link to boxcover/official info about the file  google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out ! please dont be lazy and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself , the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now !"
[V],SaM,2010-09-05T22:03Z,"@zeit
yes it is the same movie
the problem is that TPB editor is having a problem and we cant edit the torrent to add more info any more
they said they r fixing it but it is taking more time to happen"
