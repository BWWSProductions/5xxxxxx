,riskfree,2010-09-05T08:58Z,thanks for upload and THANKS for resizing your subs again...u ppl r super :)
,Vipe0713,2010-09-05T09:19Z,"hmm subs aren't working for me... says ""unsupported subtitle format"" any1 else?"
,Madkk,2010-09-05T10:41Z,"Unfortunately english subtitles are done by someone with limited english skills.
Would be highly appreciated if anyone has a link to decent subs for this movie?"
,Zombie_Boy,2010-09-05T11:47Z,"@ vip0713, just did a quick check - try using vlc player, subtitles works fine with me.

@madkk, havent watched the movie yet so cant comment on that yet.

@ FXG thanks for the brilliant upload, quality looks mint as usual! stay around on the scene, bro."
,Zombie_Boy,2010-09-05T13:51Z,"crap, english subtitles suck big time - small example -> ""they haunted us"" - when its supposed to mean ""they are following us""!! I stopped watching the movie after 30 mins, cos it got really confusing. If someone has improved english subtitles then please post the link here. Otherwise video and sound are superb."
,feartruth,2010-09-05T16:33Z,Thanks FXG. Now awaiting Iron Man 2's DVDrip.
,crufshac,2010-09-05T21:06Z,English subtitles suck big time. This is not FXG_team quality which I am used to :(
,urahara75,2010-09-05T23:15Z,"Guys, keep in mind FXG only rips the video and subtitles from the disc(s). It's actually the production companies' fault(s) if they produce and distribute films with flaws in the audio/video/subs. You can't blame FXG Team if the subtitle work is sub-par &/or too liberal from strict translation."
,solidsnake2730,2010-09-07T01:25Z,"Great Movie

Shit Subs.
I actually downloaded different subs and they were still complete shit, Example ""Or i will bang you""=Or i will kill you. i mean cmon. Seems like the french language should burn in hell. "
,cheesburgerWalrus,2010-09-07T10:35Z,Whoever translated this movie needs to re-evaluate their understanding of the french/english language... its unwatchable when nothing that is said makes sense/ is in right tense... GEEZE!!!
,Swanee1,2010-09-07T14:48Z,"Thanks FXG Team, as usual the quality of the movie is excellent, but the subs are terrible. If anyone can come up with better English subs, please let us know where."
,ouiken,2010-09-08T03:57Z,FXG U THE BEST IN THE GAME .
,jul_2020,2010-09-08T04:57Z,"Man....wonder who they pay to make such errors, I should start my own company...would definitely be more credible. "
,jul_2020,2010-09-08T04:59Z,Luckily I don't need the subs to understand :)
,mmr061485,2010-09-09T11:03Z,"@ jul_2020,

Show me a creditable company anywhere in the world that sells bootlegs and gets paid for going in theaters camming, stealing releases, sync'ing, uploading torrents of Movies & I'll show you a picture of me and Jesus drinking a beer...

You would get sue'd & thrown in prison so fast your body wouldnt even have the chance to piss itself..."

,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-10-19T17:26Z,"If you look at a torrent and it has no screenshots ( for porn) or a link to boxcover/official info about the file ( for films or tvseries etc) first search thepiratebay often someone else has uploaded the same file & bothered to include screenshots or google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia and then  copy and paste links to the info you find to help everyone else out who dont know what the file is , please dont be as disgustingly lazy as 99.9% of tpb users and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself it only takes a few seconds per file ( once youve found the info) ,the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now please. see http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/10/01/coica-bill-postponed-its-time-to-discuss-alternatives-to-traditional-dns/
Also keep seeding dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets you upload the faster your upload speed the faster you download speed is for recieving data thats how bittorent works !
im not a hypocrite sometimes when i go to post info tpb says database error failed to write..i dont have time to remember to go back to the files i couldnt help out on..so if u spot files needing info please help out. ps if you look at porn remember to respect women theyre gods greatest creation.

so who has good subtitles please provide a link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1167638/"
