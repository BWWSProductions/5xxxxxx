,fuckerr,2010-09-06T21:32Z,"@djvikas but bro consider this tht if the other uploader has already uploaded a 2gb rip thn there's no point in uploading similar size rip...try uploading in reduced size arnd 1gb or may be less n u'll evn get more seeds...n whosoevr wants 2 gb rip already has d option but 1 who wants in smaller size has no gud uploader...please think abt it...
thanks anyways for this upload.."

I had seen the same movie in 1gb Blu ray rip. I saw blurr effects in many scenes. So it's a request Don't rip BluRays less than 1.5gb. Cause Agar kam size mein rip karoge toh Blu ray ka meaning hi kya raha High Defination ka... DVD rip acchi hai usse. Jo bolte hai size kam unko bolo ki 1gb yaa 1.5gb dvdrip dpownload karo. I'm Totally agree with you in your answer to Kuttynni."
