,Apocangel,2010-09-06T15:52Z,"Brain fart, It came out already..."
,Apocangel,2010-09-06T15:53Z,Brain fart... It came out on theaters already.
,x7thdayx,2010-09-06T15:57Z,The movie has been out since August 13th. What boggles my mind is that within a month this has come from a cam to 720p BRRip. Nightmare On Elm Street has been out since April 30th and has yet to show up even as a DVDRip.
,TheChosen1_,2010-09-06T15:57Z,This cant be real...Its impossible for now i guess...
,Craziness,2010-09-06T16:23Z,Some movies comes faster then anothers
