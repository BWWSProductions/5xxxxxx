One of the most seditious videos -  the original, contemporary news report where it is openly stated that the fourth passenger aircraft was shot down by an F-16 fighter-jet from the US National Air Guard, moreover, it was so done on the request of the White House. Original FOX news video clip.

Shown by FOX at 16:29-16:30 September 11, 2001 and once more at 22.30-22.32 the same day. A service-woman said to be Lt.Col. Phyllis Phipps-Barnes from DC Air National Guard confirms this fact to the FOX reporter. 

Flight 93 exploded in the air still at a high altitude  and  its debris were scattered at a distance of at least 6 miles. It is not like an infamous slip of the tongue by Donald Rumsfeld who slipped up saying a plane was shot down over Pennsylvania. This is a public news report ---  i.e. legally admissible evidence. You can go to court with it if you want.
