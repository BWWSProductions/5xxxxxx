Without actual hard evidence to back it up a news report is only hearsay and, as such, cannot even be mentioned in a court of law except when the report is erroneous and is, itself, the basis for a libel or defamation suit.

Why is it that most conspiracy nuts are such total fuckin' idiots?!?"

Norman Mineta testified to congress that Dick Cheney had repeatedly stated that the order to not shoot down suspect planes stood."

That's just silly.

It was thermite that was used as cutter charges on the support columns of the world trade center towers.  It has been well documented by chemists and ordinance experts.

If it was nukes, I'd be dead or riddled with cancerous lesions by now.  I walked all around the attack site days after the attacks, because I worked at 45 Broad St. at the time."
