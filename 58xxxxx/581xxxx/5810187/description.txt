Plot Outline
After his latest failed relationship, Duncan has hit 
emotional rock bottom. He just can't understand what, or who, 
has caused all of his relationships to fail. Was it something 
he did or didn't do? In a final attempt to find out where it 
all went wrong, Duncan takes a ride through the memories of 
his last five relationships. He's pretended not to care about 
ex-boyfriends that haven't quite disappeared, disastrously 
attempted to give fashion advice, and even been the first to 
utter those three special wordsnothing seems to work out, 
but that's all about to change.
