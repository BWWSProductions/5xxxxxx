 Release Notes
 -------------
 Source: Iron.Man.2.German.720p.BluRay.x264-EXQUiSiTE [THANKS!]

 We used the German BluRay for this,Didn't want anyone to confuse this with U.S.
 Retail. There is no German subs,and only one spot with anything written German,
 that's about five minutes in where it say "Six Months Later". We HARD CODED
 English subs for foriegn parts(Thanks to ViSiON for there sub file!). Didn't
 do much work to the ViDEO,sharpend,denoise and a few other minor adjustments,
 left the colors aand contrast alone. Then Muxed the sources 5.1 Studio English
 AUDiO to our encode. Enjoy!=]
