[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-05T10:22Z,"Dont understan whats propert with this one. Its exact same media ID as the rest of them here.

This:

XEX CRC = 4BA83208

.BONE.

XEX CRC = 4BA83208

....all are the same game."
,mrwolfy,2010-09-05T11:37Z,"I've heard there's a version 2 of this game that is safer to go online with, maybe this is it"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-05T12:35Z,"There is no info in what is ""proper"" in this version and there is no diffrent then the rest already shared. My guess only a promote trick for ""sos""."
,Colby3316,2010-09-05T18:03Z,Hey Does this work with a modded xbox and not a jtag? If not is there any halo reach that works with a modded xbox?
[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-05T19:04Z,works with modded box yes. 
,tsailer2,2010-09-05T22:08Z,Can anyone Confirm this is workin? i downloaded the wave 3 one and only first level and custom matchmaking worked... need to know im not wasting my time???
,jamesmal,2010-09-06T04:31Z,You don't need jtag for this to play .You only need your dvd drive flashed with ixtreme LT or earlier with an activation boot disc
,Pooser,2010-09-06T11:39Z,"PROPER:

Previous releases had various problem with corrupted rars
to in-game problems.  I have been assured that this is tested
and works fully.  This has also been pacthed to SSv2.

READNFO:

Was sent this iso and I have checked the Raw SS CRC value and it
is a different rip to previous release but will likley be from
same source disc so thnx to original ripper."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-09-06T14:30Z,"Well maybe its the ssv2 

 This is iso:

     SS Version: 2 (trusted)
     SS CRC = 922E3297 (RawSS = 75989F86)
     SS Media ID: D5F8036CA497AFADC59687E1-    566C10D3 (matches game)


Other isos here:

     SS Version: 1
     SS CRC = 922E3297 (RawSS = 39A1DB7F)
     SS Media ID: D5F8036CA497AFADC59687E1-566C10D3 (matches game)


I gave it to a friend that didnt get it to work like solo campaign and load map Reflection etc..But this works for him now...But i have enver hade this problems with the other isos here so.......
"
,venom8599,2010-09-09T04:07Z,"@sunblock
In addition to having SSV2, the Proper release has a different Game CRC than the previous version available.

Previous release Game CRC: 61CB5A8F
PROPER release Game CRC:  8BEC1F2B

That means one of the two has a corrupt game partition."
,term0117,2010-09-09T09:36Z,How do you know what the game crc is? I cant find it in abgx?
,venom8599,2010-09-10T03:06Z,"Check the following on the options tab:
Check for AnyDVD style game data corruption
Check Game Partition CRC when needed

Then the game CRC will be checked and output with the rest of the check. It's a good idea to save those settings as your default along with setting AutoFix to Level 3 in the AutoFix tab. It takes longer to run through abgx360 when you check that data, but it's the only way to be safe from corrupt game data (once the title verifies or if you can compare 2 releases as in this case)."
,term0117,2010-09-10T03:43Z,So this release will be verified in a few days correct?
,venom8599,2010-09-10T22:50Z,I'd expect it to be verified sometime on the 14th.

,agentantz,2010-09-13T12:20Z,So this is retail? The early leak was bugged to fuck.
,bckmnjsh,2010-09-14T02:19Z,"So I get that this is patched with ssv2 and it works perfect, and i am downloading it right now. I'm just scared about the ban wave i was told about on november 4th. I am just going to play it when it is actually september 14th where i live, just to avoid all risks. But still, am i bound to be console banned on the 4th of november? :("
,Dackdead,2010-09-14T02:35Z,"Can someone confirm this ISO isn't bad with abgx? The other ISO came out as a bad rip after checking, I wana know if this one's good."
,Dackdead,2010-09-14T02:38Z,someone please post an abgx report now that the stealth patch is up.
