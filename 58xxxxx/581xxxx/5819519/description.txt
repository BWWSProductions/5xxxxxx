Compelling documentary for people interested in astronomy., 20 March 2002
Author: bsch4504 from Sydney, Australia

This is the most comprehensive documentary I've watched about our solar system. Interesting narrative, excellent computer generated images (for its time), extensive interviews with numerous scientists (mostly Americans and Russians-thank goodness this documentary isn't biased towards any country) and a memorable soundtrack combined to make compelling viewing for anyone interested in astronomy.

Even if you have no interest in astronomy, go watch it. It may change your mind.
