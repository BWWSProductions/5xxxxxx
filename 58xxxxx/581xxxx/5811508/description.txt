The Board

The inside story of one human soulâ€¦wrestling with the ultimate decision.

A dilemma is posed and a battle ensues. One-by-one the power brokers of the soul â€“ Mind, Memory, Emotion, Heart, Will, and Conscience â€“ step forward to weigh in. The stakes couldnâ€™t be higher. The outcome has consequences for eternityâ€¦

The Board Movie was based on a script written by church member Gary Varvel. Gary is the editorial cartoonist for the Indianapolis Star and a syndicated cartoonist as well. His son Brett Varvel, a graduate of the Telecommunications Department at Ball State University, a two time Dave Letterman scholarship winner, and a film festival award winner, is the director of the movie. Over 60 members of the church were involved with the production, which primarily took place over a week of shooting in June, 2008 on the Bethesda campus.

Bethesda has several members who are professionals in television and film, audio, lighting, construction, and electrical who volunteered their expertise and time with various aspects of this film. Additional skills in acting, drama, and makeup were utilized.
