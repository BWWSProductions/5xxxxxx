[V],jainmehul,2010-09-06T10:43Z,good one but buddy why did you delete the EAC log file.please keep them intact in ur torrents when you upload
,xerovy,2010-09-06T23:46Z,"thats a pretty harsh thing to say to any uploader let alone this one! 
E.A.C. Log File did you say > 
Ripped by dBpoweramp (Secure Mode)..
there's your answer Jainmehul. dBpoweramp is the best for MP3 and EAC is the best for FLAC.. and besides that a Log file is normally used for private sites to score a perfect rip in FLAC.. not needed for MP3 at all. "
[V],jainmehul,2010-09-07T07:40Z,ohhhh sorry i thought it was ripped by EAC (bcoz thats how bub. does all his cdrips)..... anyways thanks

[V],bubanee,2010-09-08T23:12Z,"Ando... lol :))
J.. i normally do but believe it or not i actually use dB.. more away from the computer.. it's more of a habit really just clickin' EAC 'cause i do FLACs firstly and then MP3.. but xerovy is dead right though dB is better than EAC for MP3.. even though i think they are exactly the same! :)))"
