,Brad110,2010-09-15T04:28Z,Hmm... the laptop battery kext works perfectly but others did not.  Are there dependencies for these such as you need to use a voodooHDA kernel? Any information would be great thanks.  This seems to be fully legit and is great because i looked FOREVER for any information on the kext for my Acer aspire 5732z.
