How Earth Made Us (2010) PAL DVDR (2 x DVD9)

Our planet has amazing power, and yet that's rarely mentioned in our history books. 
This series tells the story of how the Earth has influenced human history, 
from the dawn of civilisation to the modern industrial age.
 
It reveals for the first time on television how geology, geography and climate have 
been a far more powerful influence on the human story than has previously been acknowledged.
