Liberation Army is a freeware strategy/shooter designed by Kou's, and translated by Aeon Genesis. The game was originally available from a number of sources, but the developers website went down fairly recently, and as mirrors dropped, it's become more and more difficult to find. 

Contained are version 1.35, the final free release of the game, and AGTP's translation, which contains the readme on how to patch the game itself.
