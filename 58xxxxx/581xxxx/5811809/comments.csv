2. Along those years we are looking 4 good quality of these bands: seona d, figures oab breathless, wire train adresse ...,  d alexa,  parade g gold rush, red f control 88, wave of dest, flash cero nuevo ser + doble p, etc.. Thanks .."
[V],80zforever,2010-09-10T00:14Z,"rockthisway, I got The Front - Gina's at a Party from itunes a while back. If I get to converting it to mp3 and if I post music here again, I will upload it for you.

new romantic, actually it's a box-set of Cds and dvds. If I remember correctly, it is 9 CDs/Dvds in total. I shared part one only.

videoelectro, most of vinyl records are my own rip, many are from CDs and some I got from friends. I guess it's a bit late in the game to request a 320kb rip etc. What you find posted here is what you'll get. If you need a higher byte rate of an album, you need to hunt it down, but you need a bit of luck there.

,new_romantics,2010-09-13T23:08Z,"80zforever, do you have a link to this box set from OHAMA?"
