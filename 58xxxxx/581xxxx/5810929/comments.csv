,movingtype,2010-09-09T08:39Z,THIS IS NOT COMPLETE. TUTORIAL 1-12 IS MISSING. 
[T],DjAligator14,2010-09-09T08:56Z,i don't know what is missing for you because there all there.
,Mr.mofo,2010-09-10T10:56Z,"Thanks for this!

@movingtype ... this is PART 2 Advanced.

Lessons 1 - 12 are 'missing' because they are PART 1 Fundamental course.

Nothing is missing.

You are a fucking idiot.  "

There is always one Dickhead like you who gets on here and talks shit about trusted uploaders when they wouldnt be trusted if they uploaded half torrents u fuckin retard. Get a life and stop talking out your thrashed asshole."
,Photojunkie,2010-10-31T20:55Z,"Hi
Thanks for download.
I have a question,
why is this download almost same size as your other which is the full series, IE: Fundamentals/advanced and mastery?
Sure a sensible answer awaits but would like to know please.

,Senditu,2011-01-08T22:37Z,"This post is not so timely ...(sry) but Icould not help but to comment back to that freakin MORON ----> ""movingtype""

@movingtype
You really are an unobservant, haste driven, impatient, f-cking moronic idiot.
Try for a moment to actually read and understand before jumping on the idiot wagon and start calling anyone and everyone incompetent.
Those who so readily jump to accuse are so many times the ones that are at fault.
YOU ARE CERTAINLY NO EXCEPTION HERE !!!
I would love to meet you in person quite frankly, I would attempt to knock stupid right outta you. Tr laying off the stupid pills for a few days. 
Sincerely,
Your Nemesis for life (promise) !!!! "
,variousother,2011-01-13T09:46Z,"Hey @Senditu, I diagnose we Piratebayers should just ignore those rapid first responses stating THIS IS NOT COMPLETE, as written by @movingtype.

99% chance that such comments are written by overseas outsourced alternative piracy-frustration-services, hired by companies as LYNDA. 

""knock stupid right outta you"" wouldn't really make sense, because it's just their job and they've moved on to commenting on other torrents by now. Never ever downloading one of them actually."
,tomy_pond007,2011-03-21T13:39Z,thx man U rock
,Evo911,2011-05-23T02:43Z,"Ok I can verify here as well that the exercises archive is corrupted. The rest of the files are perfect, but the exercise files are in a zip archive and it is not extracting. Is it working for the rest of you guys? Please verify, and if it is, plz share them here as they're not extracting at my end. It says the archive is corrupted."
,nicoya,2011-06-06T06:35Z,"Thank you @DjAligator14
