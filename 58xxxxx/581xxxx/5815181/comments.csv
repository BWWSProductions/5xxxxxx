,SmudgeTheCat,2010-09-08T04:23Z,Thin instructions here.  Unzip/Unrar which file?  There are 49 .zip files in the download I got and no sign of a crack/instal.txt file so wazzup?
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-09-08T16:27Z,@SmudgeTheCat extract all zip file sin one folders which are rar files who needs to be extracted and those will contain files you need. Don't blame me i did not release this :)
,1TWISTED,2010-09-09T15:55Z,"thank you, nice up load. well done, as always,... : )"
,rdhtgo,2010-10-01T15:59Z,"Thanks for this Stun. I've unzipped and unrar'd everything successfully, gotten to the point of generating the key, but it keeps popping up with an error message on the keygen: ""The request code must contain only uppercase letters separated by hyphens.""

I have entered the request code, in caps, separated by the hyphen just the way it appears in the activation screen (yes, the phone activation one) so I'm not sure what the problem is. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks. "
,Rooinooi,2010-10-02T22:58Z,"After i extracted the .pkg and installed it successfully, I receive a error when i try to launch it it keeps saying its looking for files in a zResource folder which does not exist.

Any ideas?"
,cgfied,2010-10-07T05:45Z,"@Stun Thank you. This works like a charm. 
@Rooinooi The instructions are a bit confusing. I used ""RAR expander"" for the .rar file and ""zipeg"" for the zips (all free, just google). Make sure all of the files ending in .r## are on the same folder as the .rar. It worked flawlessly for me. So it should work. If anything, delete everything and try again. Hope this helped at least a little bit. "
,dauberbanaan,2010-10-19T18:16Z,"easier way: get into terminal, get into the folder in terminal (cd /pathtofolder) and type in ;unzip ""*.zip""; (with the quotes but without the semicolons).

Also, Zipeg sucks and will usually render your files corrupt."
,dauberbanaan,2010-10-19T18:44Z,"Just installed, works flawless, thanks!"
,xsnacksx,2010-10-21T01:39Z,"just installed, no problems...works great...thank you!!!"
,xniggler,2010-10-25T16:44Z,thanks a lot...
,HippyKitten,2011-01-26T18:47Z,Just downloaded... installation failed the first time... but then I double checked everything and it installed just fine the second time! It runs great and I highly recommend. Thank you so much for taking the time to make this available! :)
,kbradenj,2011-02-24T23:13Z,I unarchived all of the files and the only .rar file I found was in the first unarchived folder. It was called zb4osx.rar. When I ran it through Unrarx it gives me this message: ZBrushOSX 4.0 Installer.pkg - CRC failed. I have tried downloading this probably 4 or 5 times from both Stun and Anonymous and I cannot find the install file. Any help is greatly appreciated.
,kbradenj,2011-02-24T23:26Z,Nevermind. I got it! I did what cgfied said and moved all the .r## files into the same file as the main .rar file and then just ran the rar file through unrarx and it worked. Thank you very much for the upload. Glad to be on my way with the awesomeness of zbrush!
,Cool_Story_Bro,2011-03-20T11:04Z,"works great
thanks for the upload Stun"
,geecue,2011-04-20T21:51Z,"Just unzip all the zip files, place the .rar and .r## into the same folder and unrar the .rar file. Follow the instructions in crack/install.txt.

Works like a charm."
,s63amg,2011-04-25T08:48Z,I hope this one comes with an installer? not like the alien one you upload which didn't.
,Malcavian,2011-05-19T02:15Z,Sweet! Everything works flawlessly. A big thanks for the upload.
