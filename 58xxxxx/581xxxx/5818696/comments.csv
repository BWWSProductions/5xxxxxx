Most of the books in this torrent are easily available elsewhere in pdf or plain text or html. Better to just find them in those formats and use a pdf printer if you really want pdf. Or just download an epub reader (there's a Firefox extension that works well for this)."

1.convert the epub to Lit format using Calibre (its free,just google it)

2.  then use the Lit file to get a Pdf using ABC Amber LIT Converter (its also free) -

,kash79,2010-09-09T01:47Z,this method gives a better formatted Pdf when compared to Calibre.

,Maikeru_Defect,2011-05-19T03:06Z,"Nice upload, thanks, though I thought that I should inform you that ""Lord of The Flies"" is incomplete (missing last two chapters). Still a nice upload for being collected from various forums though. :]"
,cypherpunks,2011-08-30T13:28Z,"Fight Club has 30 chapters, not 26. I've got the paperback right in front of me. Which ones are missing here?"
,Puzzywuzzy,2012-03-28T12:54Z,"I've been looking (almost, I see now) everywhere for some of these titles, completely without luck. Thank you so much! "
