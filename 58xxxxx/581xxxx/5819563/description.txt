Quality: flac + cue

\"Cine Teatro Gran Rex\", Buenos Aires, Argentina, June 24, 1973

First issued as a two-LP set by Yellow Note, the Bill Evans Trio\'s 1973 concert in Buenos Aires was never widely distributed worldwide. Yet this concert recording, a bootleg (since Evans was signed to Fantasy at the time), is very representative of the trio, with the superb bassist Eddie Gomez and the underrated drummer Marty Morell, at the peak of its powers. Opening with a tense interpretation of &â€œRe: Person I Knew,\" his tribute to his former producer Orrin Keepnews, most of the remainder of this CD focuses on the pianist\'s settings of songs popular during the 1960s, ranging from the gorgeous &â€œEmily\" to the moving &â€œWhat Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" The pianist\'s emotional ballad &â€œThe Two Lonely People\" remains one of his most overlooked compositions, though he rushes through it in places in this version. There are two errors in the track listing: the song listed as Evans\' &â€œTime Remembered\" is pop singer Bobbie Gentry\'s lovely &\"Mornin\' Glory,\" while the final song, listed as &â€œ34 Skidoo,\" is actually Evans\' demanding composition &â€œT.T.T. (Twelve Tone Tune),\" in which the pianist and bassist sparkle in their musical exchanges. This CD will be hard to find, though it will doubtless appear on a different European label in the future.
