,Rapier_Wit,2010-09-09T13:19Z,I have a Go 910 which has the original map packs it came with from new. Can I simply load the maps here on it and replace old ones? Thanks in advance for any advice.
,uran235,2010-09-11T14:12Z,"Rapier_Wit, no you can not.
 You must patch ttnagigator or ttsystem  and activate the map.
 If you know what you are doing this takes 2-5 min."

,RotKT,2010-09-13T22:51Z,"are these for WM (ie. HD2?)
thanks"
,ScorpioPirate,2010-09-15T02:02Z,"RotKT
Nope... you have to wait to 855.2883 maps working on HD2"
,bonkeman,2010-09-17T14:24Z,"Now when the European maps are larger than 2 Gb, how do you split them so they fit on the 2 Gb internal memory? When you download with TomTom HOME you can select which part of Europe you want to install because the whole map is too big."
,hardox_400,2010-09-21T20:11Z,meta is missing

ThANKS for the upload guys.
//RESPECT"
,sionbach1,2010-12-18T22:37Z,"T0NK4, Thanks for these maps and all the others you have uploaded but why isnt there any instructions at all with them, or even links for instructions.  Its a pitty that some people cant use them as they dont know how to install them and if people like me cant use them, we wont seed them as they are useless to us  Ive googled for hours trying to find how to install with no avail so please dont think im lazy and cant be asked. Can anyone help me out please, Ive got a Go300 with the sd card slot. Thanks if you can"

,foz405,2010-12-20T02:12Z,I'm with Sionbach1.  I too have a TomTom GO300 and after hours I have no idea how to load any of these maps.  I'd really appreciate some help.
,Boobyman,2012-05-17T10:49Z,"patching with tomtom go 300 is easy. Copy UK map folder to the SD card, run the patcher exe, download latest meta, patch the applicaiton and the map. Takes about 2 minutes. Patcher does everything for you.

Not like you have to compile your own linux drivers. jeez."
,Boobyman,2012-05-22T10:51Z,"Rapier_Wit , no you need to crack tomtom app and also crack tomtom maps.  Fast activate does that all for you.

I'd recommend copying the entire SD to your HD as a backup. Zip up the contents. Then delete the old map from your tomtom. Copy over the new map. Run fast activate, point to your tomtom. Hack app and map. Then copy your backup zip from HD to  a directory in your tomtom (so you have a backup there of your old system and map)"
