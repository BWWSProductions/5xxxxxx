iTravel is a mobile gateway to Wikitravel, the Wikipedia of travel guides.

Use it to download Wikitravel pages, navigate their information with an iTunes-like interface, plot the sights/restaurants/hotels/etc on a map, and add/edit listings yourself.

All the data you download remains available when offline, too.
