Movie 1 Nfo - Robocop tells the story of a young cop named Murphy, played with deadpan charm by Peter Weller. He transfers to Detroit, where criminals run the city, the rich live in pampered sky scrapers, and the homicide rate is obscene (Only in the giddy world of fantasy). Murphy is killed brutally on his first day of work in an execution that probably holds a record for number of bullets entered into a single human body. Enter slimy yuppie guy who wants to use Murphy?s dead body parts to build a cyborg police officer, after all nothing could go wrong there, could it? So Robocop is born, and begins to kill criminals in wonderfully over-the-top ways. That is until some of his memories start to return, then for a change of pace he starts to kill the people who wronged him in wonderfully over-the-top ways, this time with the aid of his old partner.

Review - "RoboCop" is a surprisingly impressive action film about a young cop (Peter Weller) who is killed by a gang of cruel criminals and is brought back to life with both human and robotic characteristics. Now he is cleaning up the city of Detroit and going after those who brutally murdered him when he was 100% human. This film is ultra-violent in every sense of the word. Anyone under the age of 17 should be strongly cautioned before seeing this film. However, the violence makes the film realistic and more exciting. Paul Verhoeven does some of his best work as a director. The screenplay is very smart for an action film and all the actors give bravura performances. Peter Weller will always be remembered as the original "RoboCop". Ronny Cox, Nancy Allen, Miguel Ferrer, and an incredibly evil Kurtwood Smith all do the best work of their careers. An impressive film from the action genre. 4 stars out of 5.
