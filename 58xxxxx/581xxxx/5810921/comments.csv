,boe2,2010-09-05T01:15Z,"The torrent still has issues. ""Adventure Time 1x10 The Duke - Donny.mkv"" is heavily corrupted. I tried deleting the file, downloading and rechecking again, but the torrent claims the file is ok, so the problem lies in the the files itself.

I'd recommend against seeding this any further (I killed mine for now, even if it's just me, I'm seeding some bad data and the torrent doesn't complain) because you'll be wasting bandwidth ;)"
,caul,2010-09-05T02:18Z,"Yeah just as boe2 says, episode 10 is corrupted and re downloading doesn't fix the problem."
,Chouonsoku,2010-09-05T04:41Z,"K, I was able to duplicate the glitching in episode 10. Are the other two episodes fine?"
