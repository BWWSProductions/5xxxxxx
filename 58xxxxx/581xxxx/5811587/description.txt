Taking a refreshingly innovative approach to the subject, Biological Psychology: An Illustrated Survival Guide uses cartoons as an effective teaching medium. Each chapter is organised into a mini lecture, and offers an accessible introduction to key topics including:

- The brain and nervous system
- Vision and audition
- The mechanical and chemical senses
- Emotions and sexual behaviour
- Memory and learning

Intended to complement traditional textbooks in the area, Biological Psychology: An Illustrated Survival Guide provides undergraduate and â€˜Aâ€™ level students with an alternative introduction to biological psychology and an invaluable study aid.
