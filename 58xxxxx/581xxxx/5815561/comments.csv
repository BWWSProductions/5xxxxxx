,pizzahut123,2010-09-06T23:21Z,"this is the german subbed one!
fuck! lol"
,tbone3181,2010-09-06T23:51Z,"just to clarify sailo, there are NO subs at all? cos you mention its from the german bluray and the dvdrips from germany apparently have hardcoded subs over the foreign language parts. will i need eng subs if i download this? i havent touched any of the dvdrips, waiting for a 720p, but dont want to miss out on dialogue"
,tbone3181,2010-09-06T23:52Z,*hardcoded GERMAN subs* i meant 
,Morbos,2010-09-08T18:26Z,"So slow speed 0.2 kb/s
And its just for the sample"
,shasha2333,2010-09-09T08:24Z,"ok so whats the deal the German subs are hardcoded, some didn't sound so sure, if they are, This release will probably be annoying to anyone who doesn't read german.  "
,shasha2333,2010-09-09T08:31Z,"This would be a great Micro-HD release if it does not have German hardcoded subs, the NFO by the uploaded says ""No Sub"" so is that accurate? And if so why are people saying it has hardcoded German subs?"
,Saki33,2010-09-27T04:37Z,"Trying to figure out the confusing comments about hard-coded German subs so I downloaded the sample. There are no hard-coded subs on the English dialogue in the sample. A comment above says that there are hard-coded German subs on the foreign language dialogue. I interpret foreign in this case to mean non-English, therefore hard-coded subs in German will appear. The US version will be released on 28 Sept, so I suggest English speakers wait for that one."
