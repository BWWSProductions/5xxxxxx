Doctor Who returns to the Proms with a new show hosted by the stars of the series -
Karen Gillan (aka the Doctor's companion Amy Pond), Arthur Darvill (aka Rory
Williams) and featuring a special guest appearance by Matt Smith (aka the Doctor).

The concert features Murray Gold's music for the television series, including his latest
re-imagining of Ron Grainier's classic theme tune performed by the BBC National
Orchestra of Wales, the London Philharmonic Choir, soloists Yamit Mamo and Mark
Chambers, and conducted by Ben Foster.

With exclusive behind-the-scenes access, specially-edited sequences from the most
recent series, a host of monsters laying siege to the Royal Albert Hall and a new
scene written especially for the Proms by Steven Moffat and featuring the Time Lord
himself, this is an intergalactic musical adventure like no other.
