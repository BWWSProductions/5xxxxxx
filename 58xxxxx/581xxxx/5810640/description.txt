â€œI was making music in my bedroom [during my childhood]. My one rule was not to sound like anyone else.â€ Judging by his bandâ€™s debut album, lead singer Jonathan Higgs rarely had to send himself to the naughty step.
For while you might detect an occasional Yeasayer bass noodle or lei-wearing Vampire Weekend riff, this Manchester quartet flee from any identikit indie clique, throwing ever-changing, protean sonic shapes. They career between time signatures, changing keys and genres â€“ often within bars, let alone songs â€“ as they playfully elude categorisation.

Telling of teenage terrorists, war, homicidal lovers and the human condition, they leap and crackle, Jonathanâ€™s voice a frenetic falsetto bounding like a Labrador on speed, to twisted brass fanfares or military stomps that challenge you to dance then trip you up. They grow wistful and sing in sync to a line of Baroque harpsichord (Two for Nero), or, on Schoolinâ€™, drag you through as much terrain (pop, electro, jazz, funk, progâ€¦ and, er, whistling) as the most self-indulgent of Yes epics â€“ but without the soporific effect.

Even on the relatively simple QWERTY Finger, which has an innocuous handclap-and-drums opening, they give us a rushing euphonic mash-up of scaling synths and chasing vocals, before turning and returning, pausing midway for an anthemic break, complete with yelping. Yet this track not only sounds coherent, itâ€™s glorious â€“ despite the fact that here, as on much of Man Alive, the boys seem to be stuck in the surreal environs of semi-consciousness, where Lewis Carroll is king. Itâ€™s a place where lyrics such as â€œSo how will they remember us whole when we turn into salt / And it\\\\\\\'s mine, the fault, mine the dream, and the vein, home of whale-flesh, make soap out of it!â€ apparently make sense.

Whether theyâ€™re talking a load of gibber, spewing poetic profundities or playing auditory jokes (the criminally catchy chorus of Suffragette Suffragette demands a double take) it doesnâ€™t really matter; it merely adds to their quirky brilliance. And it is brilliance. EE are wilfully eccentric, and endlessly entertaining, but they know more than most how to craft a song, how to make an album. They know how to give it depth, light and dark, and they â€“ crucially â€“ know when to stop. Give it a month or two, and the EE wannabes will start to queue up. Luckily for this band, soundalikes are not an option.
