,xiIix,2010-09-08T07:14Z,"I was kind of disappointed with the beta and the demo. It's a good game, but it's nothing new. The engine is nice, and fluid, but I think the graphics could've been better. It looks great, I just think they could've pushed it a bit further. Who knows though, multiplayer could be a blast. I personally love World in Conflict, always have. It really set the pace for RTS games that concentrate on fighting and tactics rather than building resources. Overall, it's a great effort, and a great game, I just don't think I'm going to spend $50 on this when I could just fire up WIC and get the same satisfaction. 

I'll play the demo a bit more and see if it grows on me, but for now this is a pass."
,Lotharius911,2010-09-08T07:55Z,"Yeah cause graphics = How good a game is >.>
Personally, I'd rather have no game have better graphics than this. Nowadays all developers put into games is graphics and barely any effort into gameplay or story or anything else. This game is a perfect example of what the high end of graphics should be so more people can run it comfortably and more can be spent on actually be making the game fun. Am really excited to try it out and see if I like it. Thanks for the upload!"

Maybe I am a total noob, but how to avoid steam when installing?

*** Answer :
Once you open the iso, there is a exe called, ""Steambackup.exe"" you have to install the game using that to jump steam. The exe will ask you where you want to install it, then you copy the files provided by reloaded in the install folder."

,Markolie,2010-09-11T20:59Z,"Here's my way (it works perfectly)!

1) Download (click ""Download this torrent"")
2) Open files after download has finished
3) Unpack one (1) of the rars (using WinRar, Google it)
4) Mount the ISO file (using UltraISO, Google it)
5) Go to Computer --> Mounted drive (probably J:)
6) Run steambackup, choose the Steam file in Program Files (x86)
7) Run Setup
8) Go to the ""Ruse"" file in the Staem map
9) In the Crack map on the J: drive copy over the contents from the ""Crack"" folder to the ""Ruse"" folder, overwrite if necessary.
10) Choose ""Ruse"" to play the game.

,whistlersmom,2010-09-13T20:17Z,"Okay since many of you obviously have trouble reading the instructions , ill break it down for you step by step , how I got the game to work. 

Okay.

Step ONE: DOWNLOAD THE GAME USING THIS TORRENT.

Step TWO: Once the games has been downloaded, extract the game. There are many winrar files so it might be confusing for some. Just extract the first one and the rest will be extracted as well.

Step three: After you have extracted the game , there will be a file called "" rld-ruse"" This is called an ISO file.

Step FOUR: Mount the ISO file using deamon tools. If you do not know how to do this go f***k yourself.

Step FIVE: Install the game following the instructions on the screen!.

Step Six: ONCE the game has been installed , Go to: My Computer ---> There will be an icon called RUSE. Rightclick this icon and then choose EXPLORE.

Step Seven: In this directory , double click on the folder called "" Crack ""

Step Eight: mark all the files in this directory and press CTRL + C.

Step NINE: Locate the directory where you installed the game.

Step TEN: Enter your directory where you installed the game and paste the files you copied before , then press YES when it asks you if you want to overite the files.

Step ELEVEN: PLAY THE GAME BY DOUBLE CLICKING ON THE RUSE ICON ON YOUR DESKTOP.

HAVE A GOOD LIFE

PS. IF YOU CANT READ PROPERLY , NON OF THE STEPS ABOVE WILL BE OF ANY HELP
