Ripped as FLAC via the American Idiot CD and cleaned as professionally as possible using AudaCity and Acoustica MixCraft 5. No silences, no jump-cuts, no curse words.

All tracks are at 320KPBS MP3 and went through only one render during the editing stage for the finalization, they are at the highest quality possible.

Note: 'We Are The Waiting', 'Give Me Novacaine' and 'Holiday' have been edited to end on their own as solo songs, rather than lead into their next respective tracks.
