....would you like to explain how you can have low quality 720p...

It's called HD for a reason douche."
,piromandule,2010-09-14T14:23Z,"This release of a rip is one of the best here on TPB.
Cheers!!
Soo people, when will the US version come out and will the bluray(and rips) be better then the german?"

You shouldn't be so eager to call people names especially when you seemingly don't know enough of the matter you're talking about.

720p tells that the video has 720 pixels and a progressive scan. What it doesn't tell is the format and most importantly bit rate. In short: Bit rate is the quality of the file. "

,joshua_perez1980,2010-09-26T02:56Z,"this torrnet is a FAKE!!!  after downloading it, a few hours later my internet company disconnected my service.  they said that this torrent was being observed by Paramount and traced it back to me!  BEWARE!!!!"
,kortdogg,2010-09-28T00:52Z,joshua perez was right....I was just filed for copyright infringement by comcast for downloading this.  Wanted to warn you guys.
,Saabatron,2010-09-29T05:22Z,"mhmm yeah ... beware *-)  
what are they trying to do anyways? (joshua_perez1980 + kortdogg)"
,Samz47,2010-10-01T21:54Z,"It can be low quality 720p if it has small resolution so il looks like low quality on full screen so this is 1280 x 544 so it isn't that small like 700 x 300 is annoying but for me, i have 1440 x 900 screen so ya its good."
,ninjaracoon,2010-10-04T06:43Z,"try this one
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5864912/Iron_Man_2_(2010)_720p_x264_AAC5.1_-NR
real HD quality, check out the screenshots and video sample for comparison."
,ozc,2010-10-04T16:08Z,"---------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------
2 hour 1080 movies should be 8 gigabytes or more.
2 hour 720 movies should be 4 gigabytes or more.

Anything less than this is not a proper rip and is degraded. (excluding anime)

,gmjh,2010-10-19T12:47Z,"ozc, I've had 6GB HD files that look terrible with loads of pixellation on backgrounds (like the Kick-Ass I downloaded) and 2GB HD files that look superb (like this one) There seems to be a lot more to it than size."
,ultamanl,2010-10-19T12:59Z,"good quality!, but i do prefer proper english version, as i noticed this source its from poland?..

,PawnSacrifice,2010-11-07T14:27Z,"So is the sound in english or what? 

Why is it a 720p if the resolution is 1280 x 544???"
