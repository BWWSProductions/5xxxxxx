,Hawkyboy,2010-09-07T04:14Z,Downloaded a version of this movie and copyed it to my PS3....but it contained some copyprotect thingy..... muted the sound all the time.... anyone knows if this contains the same protect?
,Summersky,2010-09-08T01:39Z,"Same problem here with the PS3...and when I use the PS3 Media server, about 30 seconds into the movie, it automatically disconnects from the server not allowing any playback whatsoever...I think I'll try a DVD rip instead and see how that goes...these BR rips lately don't do jack s**t."

,sephiroth77,2010-09-18T17:52Z,"YES GUYS THE KK IN THE PS3 WONT PLAY BECAUSE IT IS CINAVIA PROTECTED, AL NEW BR HAVE THIS YOU KNOW ALSO ROBIN HIID AND REPOMEN, THE LOSERS.. SOMEONE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING PLEAAAAAAAASEEEE"
,JRH7783,2010-09-26T02:09Z,I only get CINAVIA PROTECTED problems with early copies of movies such as bootlegs and screeners with the original audio out the movie theatre. DVD and Bluray copies always work fine for me.
,checho_0,2010-10-09T15:05Z,"wow why would you try to play a movie on a ps3 anyway? Use your HDMI from laptop straight to your TV. Oh and for the record the OG KK 1, 2 & 3 were classic and are way better than this trash. Kids today are just spoiled with cg that takes away from good writing. "
,corn_bred,2010-10-11T07:46Z,"Cause streaming to the PS3 is hella easy and awesome, that's why"
,delston,2010-10-17T21:11Z,WD Live rules all
,Tovansky,2010-11-05T01:43Z,"if you guys plan to watch it on ps3, don't download this one because it is Cinavia protected, it would mute the audio of the film all the way to the end. "
