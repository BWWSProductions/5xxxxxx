,kbchris,2010-11-20T00:27Z,still one missing... and the name of 21st is help me
,lucifer2010,2011-04-01T15:24Z,actually there aren't any missing... if u notice episode 1 and 2 are together then ep 3 is labeled as to and it continues that way.. so it says there are only 21 but there are 22.. just look at what you are downloading
,lucifer2010,2011-04-01T15:26Z,sorry ep 3 is labeled as 2** typo
,lucifer2010,2011-04-01T15:27Z,sorry it meant to say ep 3 is labeled as 2**  and so on...
