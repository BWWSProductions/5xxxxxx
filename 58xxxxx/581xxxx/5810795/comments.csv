,Luvpeaceguru,2010-09-11T20:45Z,Thank you very much for all six series. A great job!  Is there one more series yet to come?
[V],meech,2010-09-12T16:26Z,"I'm assuming you mean all 6 ""seasons"", not series?  If so, yes, there is one more season to go.  I am in the process of ripping season 7 and will then be done with ds-9.  The final season 7, should be out by the end of this week."
[V],meech,2010-09-12T16:29Z,"In case anyone is interested, I will be doing high quality rips (600mb, 5.1 sound, etc.) of Farscape next.  I have already ripped season 1 and most of season 2.  Season 1 will be posted shortly after ds-9 is finished."
,gitonwiddit,2010-09-12T18:56Z,Thanks! I can't wait for season 7. Then I'm on to you ST:TNG uploads. Wonderful quality on these!
,Eryxis,2010-09-13T01:38Z,"These are amazing... you apparently have the exact same television tastes that I do.  I wanted to say thanks, and tell you that I registered for TPB after lurking for at least 5 years just to comment on these torrents.  I've got all your DS9, TNG and even Space Above and Beyond torrents queued up now."
,uthacalthing,2010-09-15T15:29Z,"I second the comments by Eryxis.  Have created this account just to log in and say thanks a whole lot!

I unfortunately don't have the space to permanently seed this series as well as TNG on my torrent PC, however I plan to D/L them one season at a time, and will be sure to seed each one well past 1:1 ratio, until I've finished watching the whole season, before I move on to the next...

Thanks again, I haven't watched these in years, and never in 5.1 before... having a blast!

You don't, by any chance, plan on giving the same treatment to Voyager at some stage?

Glad you are enjoying the torrents.  I do plan on doing Voyager in the future.  However, my next project is Farscape.  After Farscape I will probably do either Stargate Atlantis or Voyager.  Thanks again for your positive feedback."
,ZeNiTH_NL,2010-09-18T18:32Z,"Thanks for the great uploads and for the time you spend on it all.

CanÂ´t wait for you to release Voyager."
,ZeNiTH_NL,2010-09-18T18:33Z,"Thanks for the great uploads and the time you have spend on it all! Really appreciate it.

CanÂ´t wait for your release of Voyager. "
,uthacalthing,2010-09-20T13:17Z,"Well, I finally bit the bullet, and got around to installing uTorrent running as a background service on my server.  Now I've got over a terabyte to save torrents to, so I'll be able to seed these shows forever!

Thanks again for these torrents, they're awesome!  I'll definitely be getting Farscape, Voyager and Atlantis (and doing a proper job of seeding them now, too)"
,CaptainMidnight,2011-07-10T06:17Z,"Thanks for the show. And just for future reference, ""series"" is the term our friends over in the UK use instead of the US ""season."""
