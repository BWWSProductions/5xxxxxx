,lordsparta,2010-09-08T00:55Z,this is 100% full game and works perfect on win vista 64bit and no virus found according to avg free lol. Thanks for a great upload. :D
,Alyani,2010-09-08T02:27Z,How can this be the full game when the official site claims that you need 3gig free space? 
,stewartyuk,2010-09-08T03:25Z,its the full game ppl
,Demibob,2010-09-08T04:02Z,"Confirmed working :D About the size, Penumbra was, what, 400mb? Black plague followed with 600mb. Nothing unusual there :) Probably the full game, though i dare not play any more tonight :P (I heard a scream, then a growl and told my self no matter how indulging this game is, it's not worth ruining a much needed nights' sleep). 

Have anyone found the level/particle/model editor anywhere in the game directory? Or will it be released at a later point as a download? "
,malloonn,2010-09-08T04:25Z,clean; Thx
,xMrAx,2010-09-08T05:29Z,Anyone got to the ending yet where you have to find the cure for the guy or whatever? Been trying to get into the laboratory and can't figure out how.
,johnz13,2010-09-08T05:31Z,"Ty esharoth!
This is actually the full game. I played for a few hours, and it goes mutch further than the demo. Thanks again!"
,bdm2416,2010-09-08T05:35Z,thnxs!!! will seed!!
,GerQ,2010-09-08T07:18Z,"Once the the game has started fine, after that, i quited, i launched it again, since that, the game won't run, it writes: ""Error! Can't Load The Config File!"" Why? What i supposed to do? I tried everything! I f*cking want this game!!! :("
,Soeni,2010-09-08T07:34Z,"Running : Win7/64
4Gig RAM
nVidia 9400 GT
Intel core i5 2.6GHz

And I am getting a crash every time I try to start the game.

==============================
Amnesia.exe caused an EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION in module  at 0023:0000000

,TheKnThrak,2010-09-08T08:18Z,"For those having problems with being asked for a serial:

You need to temporarily give your current - restricted - user account administrator rights. That did the trick for me.

I suspect the problem was that without that I had to supply the admin-data for the install, which caused the cracked parts to be written into the wrong user directory."
,Black_dragon55,2010-09-08T12:22Z,thx very much uploader...its good to know that many people are still playing these quality horror games.
,esharoth,2010-09-08T12:43Z,"It's the full game. The level editor will be released at a later date.

About the small size: the installer uses the LZMA algorithm, which feaures a (very) high compression ratio. The installed game will occupy 1.8 GBs of data on your hard drive. 

If you're asked for a serial: install the game from an administrator account, as the installer must be able to copy a small file containing the serial number in the 'My Documents' folder of your account. If you don't want to reinstall the game, use the following serial number: THETA9211H1PBD.

About the other errors mentioned: I was not able to reproduce them, so right now I can't help you."
,xPocketRavex,2010-09-08T17:02Z,great game. worked fine for me no problems running on windows 7 64. play in the dark headphones on turn up the sound. Its the way it was meant to be played. thanks for the upload 
,Alyani,2010-09-08T20:04Z,"Euh, noob Q here. What's all that about the game image? When i download it i only get a iso file or something. Can anyone help me :p"
,xiIix,2010-09-08T21:54Z,Game looks too fuckin' scary for me.
,Quibb,2010-09-09T03:11Z,"@Alyani

You usually need to have more free space then the game requires for the install. 

And 767 MB is a fair amount for an indie game. It isn't one of the games where you go from area to area quickly, I imagine each area will be fairly long. "
,zombieballz,2010-09-09T12:33Z,Works perfects only the game kicks me to desktop when i click to much wierd shit :/
,xPocketRavex,2010-09-10T02:16Z,I WOULD NEVER SAY THIS BUT plz buy the game download this if you don't have to money i did and bought the game when i got paid if this game doesn't sell well say good bye to real survival horror. its only £10 on steam 
,Mikesnype,2010-09-10T02:53Z,"Great Torrent.
If you don't know about Penumbra, play that series, it's another game from the same makers of Amnesia.
And please buy this stuff, they deserves credit."
,sdnl1j2,2010-09-10T08:15Z,"please people buy this great game to support quality and the hard working developers like these
and show the world that piracy isn't the reason games doesn't sell well, but its quality when its high quality like this we buy the product to show our appreciation!"
,mpt86,2010-09-10T14:01Z,"Hey guys. I just bought this game after trying out the demo and downloading this through torrent. I had it seeding and uploaded around 10GB.
If you can, just buy the game like I did after trying it out and finding out how freaking awesome it is. Frictional Games deserves our support, in my opinion. Its just 20â‚¬.
I would totally want to see more from them. And now they don't even have the support from Paradox so their success and future depends on the outcome of Amnesia.

So to conclude, my philosophy is this: If its a great game, then buy it. Specially if its made by a small independent team.

Long live the pirate bay. And always remember to be ethical enough to support the stuff you love, when you can.

peace "
,fishword,2010-09-11T01:55Z,"Buy the game, support indie developers! Amnesia: TDD is freaking awesome!"
,Tyranastrasz,2010-09-19T01:23Z,"@9em
I've scanned this with Malwarebytes, SUPERantispyware, Prevx, Avira Antivir, Spybot Search & Destroy, Hitman Pro, Windows Defender, and Microsoft Security Essentials.

If you check av comparitives, you can see that both MSE and AntiVir are among the highest rated for both heuristic and definition-based detection. I wouldn't worry about it. I've installed it, and it's been just over a week with nothing suspicious happening. My HIPS also detect nothing. 

You have every right to be suspicious and worried, but I'd say your fear is misplaced here :)"
,blizzard_67,2010-10-06T20:23Z,"nice ... works i guess!!
thanks for this game apriciated!"
,diyarsonist,2010-11-29T11:34Z,"Another ""Renderer #0 could not be initialized. please make sure your graphics card drivers are up to date. check log file for more information."" error code here. No wonder this gaming studio is about to fold. This game refuses to play on ANY LAPTOP with on-board video. Get fucking real. I can play Starcraft II but not this?"
,kuzuzae,2010-12-13T23:04Z,There is only an ico? How do i mount this? I got virtual clone driver. Some instructions would be alot more helpful :S
,kuzuzae,2010-12-13T23:08Z,If anyone can post insturctions on what they did and what program they used that would be awsome :D Btw im on windows 7 and on a laptop. 
,8Putnik,2010-12-27T18:59Z,"I downloaded this, scanned with Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 nothing was found... I installed and it works perfectly :) but I am thinking is this actual full game ? Have somebody beat it ?!
Thanks... sorry for my eng :)"
,hey_its_me,2011-01-31T05:26Z,"hey i have to reinstall the program every time i try playing it, im not sure why the launcher is not working but if any one can help me out that would be great thanks :D "

,churde,2011-02-23T00:05Z,"I swear if this torrent gives me the violation error, like skidrows (wich has no fix, the developers know this and didnt do jack shit) im going to spread this game to so many sites, upload it freaking everywhere.

,NoGimmics,2011-09-14T10:41Z,"can someone please help me out,
the installation goes perfectly fine but then i get a render error when i try to use the game?
what do i do?

windows 7?"
,NoGimmics,2011-09-14T10:58Z,please email me at alybeswick@hotmail.com if anyone knows what to do?
,kspencerjr,2011-09-23T08:28Z,"To the one that said that this can't be played on a laptop with integrated video - I've played this on my HP DV5 with an ATI Radeon HD 4250 - Not on the HIGHEST settings, but it's definately playable especially with HDMI out.  You might want to make sure your video drivers are the newest, and allocate at least 512 MB for video (This goes to 3 GB, 512 MB standard).

I love this game.  EXTREMELY creepy, and the sound really sells it.  Take my advice and get a good set of headphones if you're on a laptop, it'll be worth it!  Pretty speedy download, too.  I used to use Daemontools to mount it but I heard there's a better program - Is this true?

Overall, great quality - And nothing extra that makes it a PITA to install.  Keep up the good work!"
,willow_man,2012-02-13T08:16Z,so i've tried to get this torrent from more users but every time i try it only gives me the option to burn it to a disk instead of download the game. can someone tell me what i'm doing wrong?
,NemanjaaB,2012-03-05T11:34Z,i cant download torrent -.-
,darkenedmind,2012-03-15T00:39Z,I'm not the only one who has the same issues as Hey_its_me. I have to reinstall it each time I want to play. How can I get it to where I can open it rather than install it?
,gps1976,2012-04-08T20:32Z,None of these Amnesia games on TPB work - errors and crashes on startup everytime
,Getreal11,2012-04-27T09:57Z,"Really, REALLY good.

The torrent downloads very fast. Up until 71% it downloaded in less than five minutes, and afterwards took a couple of minutes to finish and seed.
Please do buy the game, 
I played the demo, and REALLY REALLY enjoyed, it really costs nothing, and please support Frictional Games.

After trying out the game, I will definitely buy it."
,0rochimaru,2012-04-28T16:58Z,"Works fine in Win7 64-bit.  Good torrent.
