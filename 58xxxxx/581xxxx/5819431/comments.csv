,animangavideo,2010-10-21T18:45Z,"I can confirm that this does work on an NTSC/USA console. For some reason BlackBox would not allow me to FTP this to the hard-drive like I have with other games. I popped in onto a FAT32 formatted hard drive and loaded it from GAIA v1.0 RC10. At least half the games I have tried do not allow direct boot from within a boot manager. You have to disable direct boot in the manager, select the game you want with X. Then the BM will exit to XMB where you can select /app_home/PS3_GAME/ this will boot the game and emulates a disk in the drive. You can still play disk-less, just cant boot directly from the boot manager. I am using Hermes v4 with a PS3Key."
