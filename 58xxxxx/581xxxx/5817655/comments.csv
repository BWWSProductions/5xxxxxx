[V],bubanee,2010-09-09T21:38Z,"@ piratelionheart..

if your going to post your link on my torrents, which i couldn't give a shit about at least write the correct info.. your 320 has a cutoff rate of 18.9khz which makes it a V2 or 196mp3.. roughly.. 
if your new to this turning a V2/196 into a 320 makes it a transcode and does not offer any better sound but more MB's for people to waste there download on.. "

,Salient1,2010-12-29T21:51Z,"you know what i dont understand?

a while back linkin park had the ""Catalyst"" remix contest....

they said they would include the winning track on this album and it would be distributed to all buyers/listeners.

pretty much, linkin park was going to help promote the winner on their new album by including that remix track.

they said it in video blogs and posted it in the prizes area of the rules.

i still havent found 1 copy of this album with the winning remix track included.

i think linkin park LIED to everybody!!!"
