And READ BEFORE WATCHING.txt won't download at all. Minor issues, aside from having to repair Pokemon 4 every time I open it, they all play fine. I'm just stuck at 99.9% downloaded, can't seed untill it's fixed and I can get 100%.

Aside from these issues, the download went much quicker than I'm used to."
