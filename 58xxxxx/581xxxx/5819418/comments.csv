,ls365,2010-09-09T08:57Z,"Ok, so from nfo I read to put this on external HDD but could we use ftp homebrew to move to internal HDD? Looking forward to future updates from you."
,ls365,2010-09-10T07:48Z,It hangs when you try to load a game if it is on an external drive. Works if you put it on your PS3 over ftp onto internal drive.
,Squeazer,2010-09-24T00:22Z,"The game itself loads from the external HDD, but hangs if you want to start a new game."

,badassdeeess,2012-02-19T05:24Z,"Files are .arc so if you are on a Mac or you do not have a way to extract it without buying and extraction application. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. 

Why .arc? it was only used back in the days of MS-DOS?

Waist my 6 GB lol.

Na if you can extract .arc your algood.

Ive used. winzip mac, winrar mac, iArchiver, 7zx, RAR expander, arc open, and stuffit.... 

Maybe its me, maybe i dont care because i suck and couldnt get it going but... it is what it is"
