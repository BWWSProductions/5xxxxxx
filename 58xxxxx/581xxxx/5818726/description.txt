This isn't a cd or dvd image!
Image needs to be `burned` to a flash drive not to a dvd!

If you using windows, just unpack the iso file (winrar wont work so use magice iso or something else), go to utils, and use Win to Flash to to copy win.iso to a flash drive.
Win.iso located under ms windows sub dir, so as Service pack3.
Use your own serial no, from the bottom of your acer one.
Boot from the flash drive using F12 boot menu.
First boot TXT mod second time GUI mode.
You have to boot from the flash drive in GUI mode, as long as you haven't finished with the installation.
Soon as the system up and running you may remove the stick and boot from the HD.
Drivers are located under Drivers, not need to download anything.
PLEASE SEED!!!!!!!!!!
