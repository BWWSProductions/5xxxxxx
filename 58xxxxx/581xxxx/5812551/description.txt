Release Notes
-------------
Source: German.2010.DL.PAL.DVDR-KiNOWELT [THANKS!]

Thanks to rok3r for sending us the DVD!=]

We used the German DVD for this,so there is ahaard coded german subs during 
the foriegn parts. However we Hard Coded English subs over them. Thanks to
ViSiON for the sub file. Did our usual work to the video,we went a little
bit bigger on the file size than normal in order to give it a decent bitrate.
Source had 5.1 English audio. 

Ok,well somehow the .srt file got corrupted when we muxed it into the avi on
previous release. We tried to come up with a sub fix for it,but nothing seemed
to wanna work. So here we are....we re encoded the DVD,HARD CODING the subs
this time around. Sorry for last release not working outside of your PC. This 
Release works 100% on PS3 and with ConvertXtoDVD. Enjoy!=]
