,Quad-K,2010-09-23T11:43Z,"I have uploaded 20GB worth on my 50KiloByte upload net, its been going non-stop for a while (few days after release).

Uploading to PS3 now, just got my Teensy 2.0 :D

Will post results With Ninja Backup Manager v2 when done.

If you liked this torrent, upload as much of it as you can :)"
,Quad-K,2010-09-23T11:45Z,"BTW 

***PS3 REGION DOES NOT MATTER***

All games are region ""UNLOCKED"", so don't worry about not being able to play.

To put straight on Ps3, use the PS3 FTP Server package, an application you can install if you jailbroke your PS3."
,Quad-K,2010-09-23T12:49Z,"Works with PSGroove 1.1 on Teensy 2.0 Board.
Took me 7 hours to upload via FTP :(

But about the game. Great Engine, the game-play is pretty decent. Its 3rd person and really does bring about a nice story focus for once. The cinematic camera angles are awesome, and the graphics are good, besides the naked girls looking fake and rubbery (lol). Overall, great Game."

,angloaxman,2010-09-27T06:34Z,"This is my first time trying a ps3 iso. But from what ive read, if your transfering the game file to your ps3 via ftp you will need the game ID to be the proper BLESXXXXX. This games ID is BLES00521. You can find out ps3 game ids by using ""PS3SFOEDIT"" and navigating to the .sfo file in the game folder. Rename the Mafia.2. folder so that it is like this. So if your using ftp to transfer this game should be like this âdev_hdd0/game/LAUN12345/GAMEZ/BLES00521/PS3_Disc.SFB , PS3_GAME, and PS3_UPDATE.â"
,cronix91,2010-09-30T03:42Z,"Work great for me. using a usb stick, psfreedom to my htc hd2!  Thanks for it"
,twofour88,2010-10-04T06:41Z,Works perfect ! just a question can i run PAL games on my ps3 even though i live in north America ? because this says euro and it still works ! So does anyone know if the region lock doesn't matter ? because I'd like to share some games with the Europeans and whatnot. 
,ahmed919,2010-10-06T17:59Z,"Great upload thanks ""thenoobish""....i can confirm this works from a External USB ... CAN SOME ONE ON PIRATEBAY PLEASE CREATE A SECTION FOR PS3 !!!!!!!!"
,NerdCore47,2010-10-06T21:04Z,"twofour88 : PS3 games are not region locked. Any game should play on any system. I'm also in NA, and have been able to play EUR and JAP games without issue."
,kamyk87,2010-10-08T22:44Z,"Ok, 24H of download and not even 1KB downloaded.... what the hell happened with all the seeders?"
,twofour88,2010-10-10T09:27Z,"@nerdcore47 thx , reason i asked is because i downloaded little big planet and it                    wouldnt boot"
