Release Info:

This dump was made using the PSGROOVE (PSJailbreak) method using Backup
Manager 1.0 . We have tested quite a few old PS3 Scene Rips which mostly
didnt work correctly (empty/corrupted or missing files etc..).

To warm you up until you receive your jailbreak device well
bring you a few PS3 exclusive and some major cross platform titles
to get things going.

Unrar contents to an external fat32 formatted usb drive into a
folder called GAMEZ (in root dir), connect it to your PS3, use
your usbkey to get it into service mode and play from the external drive.
Make sure you have an original ps3 game in your drive (any game will do).

Notes:

Be aware that fat32 filesystem cant deal with files bigger than 4gb. So
some Games cant be ripped to an external hdd - only to the internal ps3
hdd. As soon as more tools are available, we might change the format (e.g.
using some form of containers like .iso etc..) Time will tell



DUPLEX is here to get the real ps3 scene going

bmx!
