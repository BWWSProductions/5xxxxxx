,delta.turbo,2010-10-02T10:56Z,"Great film, very watchable quality but NO SUB TITLES IN ENGLISH? Although it says it has them? just spoken language in THai/Japanese?

If there are subs in engligh they dont show on my d.load?"
,haku_jin,2010-10-04T03:17Z,"this is the subtitle file >> Ong Bak[2003]DvDrip[thai+eng subs]-KUNJU.srt
rename it to >> Ong Bak[2003]DvDrip[thai+eng_subs]-KUNJU.srt
so that it will have the same filename as ""Ong Bak[2003]DvDrip[thai+eng_subs]-KUNJU.avi"""
