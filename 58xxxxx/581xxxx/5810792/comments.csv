,immagical,2011-12-05T00:18Z,"just thought i'd say thanks to the uploader,.  and that i had windows 7 home premium genuine, got a key for upgrade but wouldnt work, then i came across this and downloaded it and used it, opend up the anytime upgrade again and tried the key after activating all upgrades using this download and it started no probs,  when i started windows again it said the windows i was running wasnt genuine but soon as i put the activation key in it became genuine so,  this definetly work well now i have windows 7 ultimate  rather than the home prem,. just to add without this it was costing me ĂÂŁ125 to upgrade from home premium to ultimate,  so again thanks for this..;)  :)

i'm just a basic user of computer so i still dont know everything this does"

,immagical,2012-03-07T22:49Z,"Also lads and laddets..   When you decide to ever do a fresh windows install,,  keep the licence key you get from this and load up from fresh with your old os discs old windows.

once done just download the ""anytime upgrade"" and install the windows you got using this before the fresh install and it still works and you wont even have to have this app installed.  Just activate with the licence key this app get you.

,ldcsniper,2012-04-23T20:17Z,"First: AVG identifies as a threat
Second: Ignoring the threat, the windows display this message: ""Unable to access the device, path or file specified. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access this item."" But I've tried opening as administrator and it did not work.

HELPPPPP TNKSSS"
,immagical,2012-05-09T14:55Z,"@ldcsniper its because if its pick up as virus you will have to go look in you anti virus vault and restore the permissions or files it has taken from the app,  that's what's probably happened.   or download again and  turn off anti virus till you have it installed and working.."
