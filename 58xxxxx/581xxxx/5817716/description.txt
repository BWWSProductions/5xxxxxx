Rolling Stone (8/30/01, p.122) - 3.5 stars out of 5 - "...Slow and elegiac....The music is stately and deep as good loam, built around a few measures repeated stolidly with a kind of back-country resignation....peculiarly evocative."

Spin (10/01, p.127) - 6 out of 10 - "...A thick candy-and-sandpaper shell of weird old keyboards, strings, and liberally applied distortion concealing Dave Fridmann's frail Virginia murmur and surreal images..."

Q (7/01, p.116) - 4 stars out of 5 - "...Excellent....combining droll lyrical insights with various permutations of guitar, keyboards, drums and electronica..."

Alternative Press (10/01, p.100) - 7 out of 10 - "...An enchanting record..."

Magnet (12-1/02, p.57) - Included in Magnet's "20 Best Albums of 2001".

CMJ (9/3/01, p.5) - "...This is a mood record for sure - but one that's not without its mood swings..."

Mojo (Publisher) (7/01, p.98) - "...Among America's modern primitives Mark Linkous is close to pre-eminent."
