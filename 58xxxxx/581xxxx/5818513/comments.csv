,MrKotor,2010-09-09T04:23Z,"These guys aren't kidding. Frictional Games make some amazing software, and if no one pays for them, they can't afford to make newer better games.

Plus these guys do this for a living, how else are they gonna put food on the table?"

,mpt86,2010-09-10T13:59Z,"Hey guys. I just bought this game after trying out the demo and downloading this through torrent. I had it seeding and uploaded around 10GB.
If you can, just buy the game like I did after trying it out and finding out freaking awesome it is. Frictional Games deserves our support, in my opinion. Its just 20â‚¬.
I would totally want to see more from them. And now they don't even have the support from Paradox so their success and future depends on the outcome of Amnesia.

So to conclude, my philosophy is this: If its a great game, then buy it. Specially if its made by a small independent team.

Long live the pirate bay. And always remember to be ethical enough to support the stuff you love, when you can.

peace"

so to some up if this game manufacturer goes out of business then the only person to is you 
i also think if people can genuinely afford games they will buy them ,the people on here are skint and besides that ive spent hundreds of pounds on xbox360 games and half of them wernt playable but you try asking for a refund because a game is shite

Really freaky!
The most freaky game I played!

If you have a crash issue after going into a loading area and every time you continue it crashes, simply load a file or 2 back behind it.
I don't know why it did that to me but that fixed it.
Also avoid spamming the mouse button on loading screens.

Again TY!

I had the exact same problem as you.. But i figured it out how to solve it cuz noone else couldn't help me in the forums or anything :) I basically thought that something must be up running in the background that disturbs the game, which it should be the same for you too... So what you need to do is:

1. Start the Amnesia launcher
2. Open up your Taskmanager
3. Check for the process ""RunDLL 32"" if you find it, there should be 3, 2 or 4 or whatever running at the same time!
4. Shut down ALL of the ""RunDLL 32"" Processers
5. Start the launcher again and thats it.
6. You can also shut down all of them except 1 i think. That should be all and the game should run perfectly smooth and nicely! :)"

,bugnexus7,2010-11-30T09:02Z,"Ok, here is the deal.

I encountered the very same exceptions/errors as most of you. Whenever an application encounters an error it USUALLY leaves a log file behind...lo and behold, there it is. It even TELLS you what caused the error.

In my case it was a failure to create a buffer for shadow rendering. This tells me that it has nothing to do with the crack, and more then likely either a problem with the game OR a problem with my video drivers. Obviously, it is easier for me to do something about the drivers then the game. 

Long story short, I went to their forums and found repeated posts where people had the same issues as here on TPB...and most were solved by updating drivers. 

Guess what? It works and here is why. 

With older games, the required buffers sizes were far smaller and were also determined by video drivers on your system. As time went by games started getting more complex graphically and LOGICALLY require more and more memory/larger buffers. The only problem here is that most OLDER drivers set the buffer sizes too small and the game quite simply doesn't run with them that small. 

The latest Nvidia driver package (260.99_desktop_winxp_32bit_english_whql.exe) opens up such things, wide open. Use it.

You ATI guys are kind of screwed if the ATI patch doesn't help you. 

Another thing the devs stated in one of the posts was the importance of doing a CLEAN driver install(erases all traces of the old one). The latest Nvidia package has a button on the installer to do exactly this. 

After doing a clean install of that above package, and NOTHING ELSE, the game runs perfectly. Perfectly. 

What this tells me is that everyone should not blame the game developers--they offer cutting edge gaming that requires the latest SOFTWARE (free in most cases!) to run, not a new video card. One more reason to pay them for this game. Buy it. It works, if it doesn't, update your drivers.

(Another thing I noticed is that Nvidia Driver updates are including changes for specific game requirements, ie they are making changes to the drivers to make games work BETTER then they did when you bought them. Kudos, Nvidia. Speak with your wallets, people!)"
,bugnexus7,2010-11-30T09:10Z,"Obviously, if you are not using XP (or Nvidia for that matter), that driver package is useless to you. 

For you Nvidia users, go here and get the one for your machine.

For the rest of you, Google is your friend.

,churde,2011-02-22T01:56Z,"@ItsxTre

A release is when the manufacturer sticks lots of games in up ass and gets really fat stuffed with games up in there, then every few months the people grab him and demand from him to release the games. so they bring in charizard so the manufacturer can suck his flamey dick and release the games."
,churde,2011-02-22T01:59Z,hmmm where did my comments go @_@

-Download
- Mount the iso file with Power ISO or Daemon Tools
- Doubleclick the cd-unit and install
- Explore the cd-unit and copy the skidrow crack to REDIST and overwrite.
- Run the file you overwrote and play!

,brokentrigger,2011-03-11T14:51Z,"dude anyone who says ""just go out and buy it"" and ""oh they cant survive as a buisness without your money"". SHUT THE FUCK UP. leave the comments for people that are having issues and to see if the torrent works. If u dont like it go to gamepro and download the demo, but stay out of our community traitor. Btw you really think torrents have that much of an effect on a game company that refused to pay out the ass for marketing? Look at halo dude, huge budget, then look at lets say Psyconauts...which was just as good or better with no marketing and did not sell. So calm down whiteknights and keep your negetive comments to yourself asshole (especially if your going to talk out your ass not knowing what your saying or anything about the industry)"

,N1k0Bellic,2011-03-29T19:21Z,"I'm gonna download this game because I trust SKIDROW and I wanna try to run this game on my crap Intel graphics card with 3D Analyzer. You see, according to canyourunit.com, I meet all the requirements except for video card. specifically Hardware T&L and Vertex Shader version 2.0.

So, with that in mind, I will attempt to use 3D Analyzer to emulate certain features that video cards like NVIDIA and ATI are made with and Intel can only wish to have. I will report my findings to you, fellow pirates. Hopefully this will work, because I really want this game. 

Stand by. ETA: 1h 7m"

,N1k0Bellic,2011-03-29T21:13Z,"OK, f*ck Intel graphics. Useless piece of sh*t. For starters, the game doesn't even load with 3D Analyzer. 

Second, when you load the game without using the very thing that would allow you to play with great FPS, you will only get to adjust your settings. Don't even try to launch the game fellow Intel graphics user, you will get an error and get thrown out on your ass. I'm sure the game would be great and work fine, but I can't even get that far due to Intel's lack of f*cking EVERYTHING. F*********CK INTEL! A graphics card that lags when playing MINECRAFT with max draw distance needs to burn in hell forever.

TL;DR: If you have Intel graphics, go play Terrorist Takedown 2. If you have NVIDIA or ATI, enjoy this game on max f*cking settings you wealthy motherf*ckers. 

Niko over & out."

,LordOrwell,2011-03-30T16:48Z,"@nicobellic:  For god's sake shut your pie hole.  For one thing, intel doesn't make graphics processors.  they make a chip that uses your cpu to generate a graphics display.  Get yourself an external card and quit whining.  3danalyzer isn't perfect.  I know this since my hp laptop uses their graphics, and i've owned macs in the past.  
Spend about $50 and buy a graphics card off ebay like us rich folks.  Doesn't that make more sense than buying a gaming laptop?  Gaming laptops run about 3x what a similar pc runs.  Your multiple posts have made my brain hurt and if i hear much more i'm liable to kick a kitten."

1. download winrar and install so you can extract the compressed file i.e. the downloaded file (i extract to desktop).

2. Download Daemon tools lite and install (creates a virtual/fake DVD drive to mimic hard drive downloads as discs). Once Daemon is open right click on the tray icon and mount move the image i.e. locate the file you extracted to desktop.

3. It should auto prompt you to run or explore. I generally just explore and locate the install icon as sometimes the autorun is bugged. If you are not prompted go to my computer, right click on virtual/fake drive and explore - locate install file. 

4. Just use the code provided, remember to count the number of 1's used as the game will let you enter more, thus giving wrong code.  With a lot of the downloads the crack will be installed within the downloaded area above.  right click on crack and copy it. Now locate where the game was installed to i.e. my computer -> hard drive -> EA. Once in there look for an icon that look similar to the cracked icon. 

5. Once found, right click on an empty space and paste, you should be prompted to copy and replace, do this. Now your free to play the game. At this point I right click on the pasted crack and create a shortcut and drag it to the desktop for easy access. If you get a lot of games, create a games folder and put all your games together. You get really quick at this. 

good luck

Yeahhh they come as rar files.  What you need to do is unpack the rar files with a separate program like Winrar.  You should be able to search for a free download somewhere online.  "

The only problem i got so far is that when i play full screen and i put the game in background, my mouse is buged. Otherwise, everything is fine and i might buy the game later on. Thank you Stun."

,RiggadoN,2011-06-14T07:42Z,"perfect crack, everything worked perfectly. except the game made me shit about 8 pounds of bricks, its fucking scary. 

and to all the retards who dont know, heres how to make the game work:

1. make a folder anywhere you want, call it ""Amnesia""
2. select all of the files in the folder you dl'ed
2. right click on them-> 7zip-> extract files...
choose the folder you just made as the extract directory
3. the files will make an iso image, so like a dvd. mount the iso using daemon tools or whatever you prefer
4. enter serial or copy crack, might as well do serial its easier"
,DavidCerqueiraa,2011-06-14T15:33Z,"If some of you are getting problems with the graphics it's because this game it's not supported with Intel HD Graphics - at least that's what I think. I tried to play but after i ran the game, it would crash."

,kaitymckaiterson,2011-07-07T21:54Z,"I made a TPB account to comment on this! Might as well start uploading torrents. ANYWAY. For those of you with Intel HD graphics, I'm not the most knowledgeable person about computers, but I try. Anyway, Intel HD graphics aren't great for gaming. If you're getting the renderer #0 invalid error, what you should do is what it say, and go update your graphics drivers. You can use Google and get them from the Intel website. After I did that, I launched the game with the lowest settings and it starts, but in my case, I can start a new game, but the screen is black, and I can hear the voice acting, and I can move around, but there's no graphics output other than the mouse pointer. I'm PRETTY sure the beginning of the game doesn't start in complete darkness, so I'm trying to fix it."

unfortunately Intel HD graphics cannot play this game. I had the same problem myself, I was on a laptop and was gonna play this game but all I got was the black screen. I looked around and did some research on how to fix it but the only thing that I could find was that machines with Intel HD graphics cannot play it and are basically screwed."

,Razr92,2011-07-29T02:06Z,"If you made your own Drivers from the binary source files , like I make my own drivers , you can run possibly every game . It wont lagg just graphics wont be as good as it was supposed to be. Run Quake Wars on Gma 900 , np , would look like Doom 3. I played Crysis with Med settings on my Gma 950 onchip intel GPU after burning my 8500 GT , Now Im playing amnesia too. The driver is the information source for every application. If it says you got shader model 4.0 then The application beleives it. On top of that many Chips have some features locked due to issues of overheating , If your like a pro user then you can get around the solution with some cooling addons to your PC and unlock these. For example The latter versions of Geforce 7600 had the same juice and features/chip of the 7900 but they were locked which were unlocked with 3rd party mod releases later which made nvidia stop 5x 6x and 7x Geforce production completely , The Google is at your disposal for your GPU , dont ask me if you need something.

Ive downloaded this torrent twice thinking something might have been corrupt the first time. But when I run the game I have to turn the settings extremely low (640x480 windowed mode with lowest graphics settings) to even get it to run, and then whenever I push any keys to open the inventory or talk to the note on the desk the game crashes. At first I thought it just wasnt able to run on this computer but I went to the site and downloaded the demo version and that runs perfectly on max settings with no crashes. Not sure whats up with it but I cant seem to find a fix."

Thanxxxx for this excellent torrent...

"
,Dancanabinol,2011-08-18T02:26Z,"Another IMPORTANT thing for you all: 

the SKIDROW folder is in one .rar file that is different from the others; when you extract one of these files you have to be sure that you're extracting everyone of them because in one of these files (the less heavy in kbytes) has the cracked files (skidrow folder) that you have to copy-paste in the main directory of the game...

,TheAC30fSpades,2011-09-11T21:38Z,"@tyrosxps

Because right-clicking the first .rar and clicking extract files... is too much work to get the .iso is too much work right?  What the hell was SKIDROW thinking with making us click two extra times with the mouse!?  You disgust me, if you don't like what SKIDROW provides us with (FOR FREE) just go buy the damned thing.  Game works perfectly, really creepy game.  Nice upload, MAFIAA.!

For those who are new to this, I suggest looking at TPB forums for how to's that provide easy answers to most of your questions.  But for now, this is what I did.  What you need: WinRAR (Download here - http://www.win-rar.com/download.html) and DAEMON Tools Lite (Download here - http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads)
Note: both are free.

1) When torrent is completed, right-click on the first .rar file you see (using WinRAR [WinRAR should be the default program to open the .rar with]) and click extract files... and it will create a folder named 'sr-atdd' with the disc image inside (.iso).

2) Open DAEMON Tools Lite and open the disc image (.iso) and add a virtual device.  Mount the disc image to the virtual device you've added and the setup should begin for installation.

3) Once the installation is complete, you can choose one of two options to bypass the product key verification process.  You can a) use the '11111111111111' serial code SKIDROW provides us with, or you can b) go to My Computer and right-click on the (E:) drive and open the SKIDROW folder and copy the cracked content over to the installed directory which I assume you installed to 'Programs x86'.

I suggest you go with option b), because they cracked the game for it to work without the serial code, and from what I've read, people are having trouble with putting the '11111111111111' serial code.  I hope this helps all who were confused!"

,OscarAndradePTY,2012-05-09T23:56Z,"@oJS6

You have to right-click on any of the rar files and then click on ""Extract here"". Wait for the extraction to complete then mount the ISO file with Daemon Tools or another similar program. After that, just open the Setup.exe file and install the game.

Hope this helps. :)"

,GeekIntel,2012-05-29T00:13Z,"Downloaded this torrent plenty of times. It completely 100% works. Before you go off and complain about problems, check all the comments to see if other people have had the same problems as you, and to find a possible solution to your problems. Or Google it, whichever strikes your interest. 

Great torrent & thanks, MAFIAA "

What works for me to free up the cursor, is Alt+cntrl+delete and start task manager, then just minimize task manager.
XP automatically goes to task manager, but newer windows versions go to a menu."
