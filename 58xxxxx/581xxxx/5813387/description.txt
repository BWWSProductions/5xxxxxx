This is the full version of Windows Vista Home Premium Retail (Norwegian).


Since this is retail version can be transferred to other computers (but only used on one computer at a time of course), unlike the OEM version is locked to only one computer (ie a given composition of components). Retail version also means that the license key works for both 32 and 64-bit installation (only one at a time of course), unlike the OEM that is locked to either 32 or 64 bit when you buy it.
