Software automaticly upgrade Flitestar to 9510 Build 15120).Works great, but now...program do not recognize Raster Charts Europe 2007. Try to reinstall all from ver 8.5 ,until update to Data Cycle 1016 is OK, After mounting 1017 it's always the same message ""Error Reading Raster Charts from C:\Jeppesen\Charts\Raster\.  The Drive May Not Be Accessible"" Any idea? "
,hs125,2010-09-12T12:37Z,"i have problem with jeppview since 1016, it is not working at all any advice? I read about stylesheetupdate....."
,warloot24k,2010-09-12T13:45Z,"hs125

If you are still using cycle 1015 and 1016, then you need to adjust your clock (time zone) to a country that has DST (Daylight Saving Time).  From there, you can access jeppview.  But, if you already downloaded and installed cycle 1017, then there is no need to adjust the clock to DST."
,warloot24k,2010-09-12T13:46Z,Jeppview will work without adjusting the clock to DST.
,hs125,2010-09-12T22:23Z,"warloot24k
thanks for your reply, but i tryed 1017 and this doesn`t work with 1017 at all"
,warloot24k,2010-09-13T05:36Z,"hs125

If that is the case.... I think you need to reinstall jeppview 3.5 program again.... then from there, install the latest cycle which is 1017.

(Uninstall your old jeppview 3.5 then reinstall)"
,hs125,2010-09-13T13:40Z,"i tried few times, but this was with second 1017 torent, now will download this one and will try again.
Thanks "
,savaz12,2010-09-14T01:06Z,"same with cycle 1016....
