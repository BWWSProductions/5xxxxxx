,DoDirty7,2010-09-09T15:57Z,I started my download yesterday.  Still no seeders.
,Mercyflush64,2010-09-10T21:29Z,I ended up deleting this download. There never was a seeder beyond .04% so what is the point of making an upload if you only seed single issues and not your packs.

think that's all there's available in the swarm :(
hardly any complete issues"
