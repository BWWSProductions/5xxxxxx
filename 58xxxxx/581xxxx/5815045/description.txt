2)
Put the xPUD iso in the root and you will be able to boot it through the grub4dos menu at boot.


More about xPUD here: 
http://www.xpud.org/

It's extremely fast and an fast alternative to get to the internet as quick as possible if you have a XP system that never seems to start. It can also be downloaded from http://www.xpud.org/ but it can sometimes be painfully slow (but test it if this torrent is is slow).
