,bobchpth,2010-09-09T09:57Z,There are hardcoded Korean subs on this upload - should this not be mentioned before those of us who dont want them waste our time ?
,lynx_ca,2010-09-18T17:42Z,"yeah definatly, if there is hardcoded subs of any language then the uploader should be telling us... 

not what i expect from a 'trusted' uploader, especially one ive downloaded so much from. im sure quality is great though. "
