,niterescue,2010-09-09T02:18Z,"is this an error?

05. Paste into Kaspersky\\\'s installation directory
06. Delete the 2 patch files BEFORE start and enable Kaspersky self defense again.
07. Start Kaspersky BUT DON\\\'T ENABLE SELF DEFENSE YET!


The above just doesn't make sense.  Can anyone else verify this is legit and not some virus to steal your data!!!"

Ignore the 2nd statement in point 6. You can’t enable/disable the self defense before having started KIS. "
