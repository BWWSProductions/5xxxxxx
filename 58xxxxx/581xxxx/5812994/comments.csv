,hauntnut,2010-09-12T03:47Z,Quality is excellent! Thanks!
,vivatpb5776,2011-07-06T20:25Z,"Video quality is very good; however, this is a FULL SCREEN release (992*720). Not sure why the uploader choose to crop the sides of a BRRip but that is just ridiculous. Additionally, the size of the movie after extracting it from the compressed .rar files is excessively larger than it needs to be. This had the makings of being the best, if not the only, quality release of this movie available. I was seriously mistaken."
