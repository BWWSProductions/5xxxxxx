,Eddie_Teach,2010-09-09T05:14Z,"Quick note to everyone...this file has TWO audio tracks, so make sure your video player is set to the right one to hear the Rifftrax. I almost flamed crowvo for leaving it off... ;-)"
,murdkipz,2010-09-10T14:08Z,"Thanks for uploading.

Instead of donating, just buy the actual Rifftrax file from their website. They still get the money, and then they can see which movies people are most interested in. They need the cash, yeah, but it's important for them to also be able to calculate their sales numbers. From their perspective, just getting a couple bucks out of nowhere in your paypal only raises several maddening questions that can never be answered. Which movie did they watch? Did they like it enough to buy another one? Did they watch every single one, and it was all only worth a couple bucks to them? Think about it from their perspective.

tl;dr Buy the rifftrax file instead of donating, it makes more sense "
,TN-048,2010-12-01T02:23Z,Hahahahahahaha lol I love this so much. Now to force my family to watch it :P
,MarkoOhNo,2010-12-18T04:08Z,"WARNING to anyone who thinks they're downloading the original Star Wars Holiday Special - that's not what this is. I realized late that it's dubbed over by the same guys who did Mystery Science Theater 3000. A bit irritating when I wasn't expecting it, no matter how much I love those guys."
,MarkoOhNo,2010-12-18T04:12Z,How do you shut off the rifftrax track so you can only hear the original audio track?
,Kali_Flower,2010-12-22T13:18Z,"Hey Marko-
That's what Riffs/ Rifftrax are! It's a movie with the MST3000 guys making jokes over it, and it's awesome! X-D  The uploader said so in the description so really you just need to read those a bit more carefully and make sure you know what you're downloading."
,crowvo,2011-01-16T17:03Z,"Marko, I really have no clue how you couldn't figure that out.

I mean, really.

Rifftrax is the first thing on the title, and the entire comments section talks about Mike, Bill, and Kevin making fun of the movie.

If someone can't figure it out by then, I really doubt they'll scroll down and read your comment.

Also, it should be dual audio; so if you -really- want to watch this film abomination without any sort of humor to protect your soul, just boot it up with VLC or anything that can switch the audio channel."
,murdkipz,2011-04-09T14:53Z,Quit telling people to donate. BUY THE CORRECT FILE FROM THE SITE and then they'll know what people like and don't like. Donating money randomly is the most asinine thing you could possibly do.
,miketheratguy,2011-09-08T00:52Z,"YES!!! It even has the commercials! For some reason, some versions of this have the commercials cut out which sucks because the guys riff on those too.

For me, the original UN-riffed audio track is the standard one, and the Riff track is the second track, easily selectable in VLC or other programs.

If you want to change the default track just run this avi file through mkvmerge GUI or similar muxing program. Thanks for this upload; I lost my 4 gig copy and never thought I'd see it again (let alone in an infinitely more convenient size)!"
,niggerplz,2011-11-13T18:58Z,"the original audio on this if off sync, and the riff track or whatever it is isnt funny, not to mention the video size is so tiny that expanding it to a whopping 12"" screen turns it into a bunch of mush. "
,niggerplz,2011-11-13T19:44Z,"FYI this version is 400x288@30fps, 1:57, includes commericals. "
,niggerplz,2011-11-16T23:52Z,"finished dl'ing the 3.4gb version on here and the quality is much fuzzier compared to this one scaled to the same size, and the audio on this one is cleaner too. Also the color on this one seems to be truer. Gonna dl the fullsize riftrax one."
