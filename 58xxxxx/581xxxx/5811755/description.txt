Since there's a very limited supply of this Riff (either a 4 gig IMG file or a very low quality movie if you really dig through google), I decided to cut out the hard work and deliver the .avi to the public!



Join Mike, Bill, and Kevin on an adventure into the mad mind of Lucas. This includes the gayest sequence ever filmed, long un-subtitled Wookie-only scenes, a terrible and random cartoon, and guest stars that you end up pitying more than anything else.



Please remember to donate to the fellas atThe Riffs are only what, $5 tops? It's definitely worth every penny!

And don't forget to seed!
