[V],meech,2010-09-09T03:49Z,"I applaud CTU for offering quality over quantity in all of their encodes.  I'd much rather spend the extra time and hard drive space downloading these higher quality torrents than a speedy download of lesser quality.  I don't know how people stand the quality of the lower bit-rate encodes.

x264 is by far the superior encoding engine.  Not sure why xVid is still preferred by some.  Plus you include 5.1 audio and 720p HD video.  So all those things combined make for a great viewing experience on my 50"" LCD/Surround System.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  Thanks CTU!  And thanks TvTeam for posting them!!

p.s. I love this show.  The acting and especially the writing are extraordinary!"

I Totally agree.  i have no idea how i managed to watch the entire first series in such poor quality once you get into watching in HD you cant really go back."
