             ABOUT THE SHOW           
                                                                    
                                                                              
 It's a genre-bending spectacular. A satirical newscast that is part          
 skit-show, and part sitcom.                                                  
                                                                              
 Each week, cameras take you behind the scenes to spy on a frantic, ratings   
 obsessed current affairs show, where the Feedback team must deal with a      
 caldron of ambition, deceit and sexual misadventure.                         
                                                                              
 It's been a slippery slide of moral decline for high-profile news presenter  
 Arthur Meek.                                                                 
                                                                              
 The former primetime media darling has seen his current affairs show         
 relegated to late-night after his team were caught faking the news.          
                                                                              
 Shunted from 7pm to 10:30pm, the network has delivered Arthur an ultimatum:  
 rate, in a new late-night slot, or die.                                      
                                                                              
 With his back against the wall, Arthur vows to do whatever it takes to get   
 back on primetime - so he and his crew make the most muck-raking,            
 crowd-pleasing and inflammatory news possible.
