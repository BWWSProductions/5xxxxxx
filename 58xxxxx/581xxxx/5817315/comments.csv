,duffyrabbit,2010-09-09T02:20Z,I'll check it out. It can't be worse than Star Trek reboot. ;-)

,duffyrabbit,2010-09-09T12:00Z,"Well, it was probably made with a Mac, so of course, they would use some Quicktime format over MKV.

It's not bad.  I don't particular care for the acting of the guy who plays the Captain, though.  Unlike one of the other fanmade shows I've seen, this one doesn't try to add music/sounds into every single moment of the episode.

Funny how there's one scene when their phasers are not working, but they keep carrying it as though it did work, and then were not surprised when they squeezed the trigger, and the phaser actually fired.

BTW, you would think that someone would have made hybrid guns (energy weapon + projectile weapon) in the event that there was electronic jamming (eg. EMP)."
