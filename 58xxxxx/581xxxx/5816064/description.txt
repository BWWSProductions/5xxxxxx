The music of As Kindred Spirits is the sound of cultures colliding.

This unique recording of World Music perfectly captures the uplifting and energetic atmosphere in which As Kindred Spirits crafts their music â€“ where devotional Indian songs, and rich ethnic melodies are infused with a fresh, western twist, creating tracks that are both hip and inspired.

â€˜Nectar of Devotionâ€™ is a candid collection of songs from these very diverse and talented musicians. Gaura Vani and Sandeep Mody open our hearts with their sincere music and evoke long forgotten spiritual feelings dormant for countless moments of eternity.

Allow this album to place you in direct contact with the Divine through the universal language of devotional music.
