,TheWun1,2011-01-09T13:35Z,"So if Virus Total says that 33 out of 43 say that patch.exe is a virus, what do I believe? All the big ones except Kaspersky say it's a virus.
I've always wondered about this and when it's only 5 or even 10 that list it as a virus, I figure it must be OK, but 78% makes me a lot more cautious.

If someone can confirm that this is not a virus, can you also please explain why it is that these patches or cracks often show up that way?"
