Chew7 is the only activation solution that disables the loathed \"calling home\" feature (spyware) that is embedded into the software protection platform of Windows. In Windows XP days, when WGA was first released, it quickly became apparent to the more self conscious technologically inclined users, that Microsoft was retrieving personally identifiable information from its users without notice on a daily basis (every time the system boots up and then on a 24 hour interval after that). Now they have switched to a robust \"software protection platform\" built into the framework of the operating system itself, and they\'ve changed this 24 hour grab interval to something much less conspicuous â€” 14 days, so it\'s no wonder most people haven\'t caught on to what\'s happening. Even with a firewall installed, most of us are inclined to simply ignore notices about Windows components connecting to the internet without apparent cause. Private information like names and internet protocol addresses, browsing history, and sometimes even files that they deem to require further investigation, are being sent over the internet. What do they do with all this information? It\'s anyone\'s guess, but the way we see it, it\'s certainly an invasion of rights to privacy. Will they admit to it? Probably not; it\'s spyware after all.

Installation:
=============

(For users on a fresh install of Windows, you donâ€™t need these instructions.)

1.Turn off or disable your anti-virus/anti-malware software.
2.Completely uninstall any previous versions of Chew-WGA or related software.
3.Run â€œsfc /scannowâ€ (without quotes). Wait for it to finish, then restart the computer.
4.Run â€œservices.mscâ€ (without quotes) to open the Microsoft Management Console \"services\" snap-in.
5.Verify that the startup type for â€œSoftware Protectionâ€ is set to â€œAutomatic (Delayed Start)â€.
6.Verify that the startup type for â€œSPP Notification Serviceâ€ is set to  â€œManual.â€
7.Run â€œChew7.exeâ€ and click the â€œInstallâ€ button.

As with any application, there is a chance that your anti-virus / anti-malware software will falsely detect trojans and other viruses when it scans Chew7. As long as the cryptography hashes of your copy match with those listed on the website and in the Cryptography section above, you can ignore these false positives. There has never been, and never will be malicious code in Chew7.


If you are wondering what this is, it\'s an activation tool for Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Home Server V2 (aka Vail).
