,HUMASTRUM,2011-12-21T04:36Z,I installed this on a new os and ended up with a cmd.exe taking 40% cpu all the time.
,HUMASTRUM,2011-12-21T04:42Z,"here is how to uninstall the crap, http://www.cybertechhelp.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1206230"
,Random-User,2012-04-08T08:48Z,"Ok, no viruses were found when scanning the installer or when it was run. 

It does activate WHS and other OS's (tested on WHS 2011)

However, yes, it is a Virus. You need to watch it very carefully when installing it, ensure that you have no internet connected when running and follow the steps bellow:
Run as admin.
Allow to reboot but hit F8 untill safemode options appear.
Enter SafeMode.
Open MSCONFIG and kill ""hale.exe"" startup.
Open C:/Windows/system32/ folder and delete Hale.exe (need to show all hidden files).
Open REGEDIT and search for CHEW and Hale.exe and kill chew folder and Hale string in the run entry.
Reboot and enjoy a cracked OS without the viruses that will ensue if not done wisely."
