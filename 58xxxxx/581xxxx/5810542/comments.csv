,jon4fun,2010-09-04T19:04Z,"@ 20-40 - Congrats on the 'green skull'. Not before time, in fact long overdue and.

Keep on keeping on. Hope you manage to get a new PC up and running so that the skull actually means something.

@ ALL - All the other fans seem to live in a bubble, alhtough I know it is slowly expanding - you know who you are and thank you.

The rest of you sicken me. 20-40 has a 'green-skull' therefore ALL his computer problems have been resolved.

Put YOUR fucking hands in YOUR fucking pockets and help OUT with keeping the best there is on-line. 

YES - I am TALKING TO YOU!

Jon"
