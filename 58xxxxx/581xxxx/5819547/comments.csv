No wonder this gaming studio is about to fold. This game refuses to play on ANY LAPTOP with on-board video. Get fucking real. I can play Starcraft II but not this?"

,skaterfox6,2011-04-17T19:27Z,"I need help ASAP, so i downloaded it and played if for a few hours and had a great time, love this game, but when i got to the water level, I made it to the part where you distract the monster so you can open the gate, but when I try opening the gate it makes the sound but neither the wheel nor the gate move, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times as well as changing the mounting program. I have no idea what to do, can anyone think of anything?
Email me soon please at "
