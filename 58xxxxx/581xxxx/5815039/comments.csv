,Intlwaters,2010-09-06T18:15Z,If this has English Hardcoded subs for the non English parts i will most likely have a NTSC DVD Up at the end of the day i norm wouldn't do this but there are over 100 people on here that want it and so do i and i am taking the time to process it so might as well put it up. That is if it is on with you raymondhome. Unless you do it firss.

,muneeb.abbas3,2010-09-07T03:06Z,Its real but its 480p.. I ll probably wait for 720p or 1080p.. 
,Vimes84,2010-09-08T12:20Z,"Far better than MAX ""dvdrip"". Intense colors, no German hard subs, although German rip (there are some logos before Paramount). After credits scene is present.

V-10, A-10.

But still waiting for 640x272 1,4Gb rip. "
,jinqx,2010-09-08T20:06Z,"V10 A10 Excellent.
No hard German subs , used Visions subs for non English speaking parts, no problem.  "
