The new one I agree, is boredom. The older one however, is awesome!"
,crowvo,2010-09-06T12:28Z,It's the newer one; Rifftrax has yet to make fun of the original.

Instead of donating, just buy the actual Rifftrax file from their website. They still get the money, and then they can see which movies people are most interested in. They need the cash, yeah, but it's important for them to also be able to calculate their sales numbers. From their perspective, just getting a couple bucks out of nowhere in your paypal only raises several maddening questions that can never be answered. Which movie did they watch? Did they like it enough to buy another one? Did they watch every single one, and it was all only worth a couple bucks to them? Think about it from their perspective

tl;dr Buy the rifftrax file instead of donating, it makes more sense"
,crowvo,2010-09-11T21:03Z,"Exactly; I agree with murdkipz. I tried very hard to sync up my first purchase with Star Wars Episode V, and just could not enjoy it as much because of sync issues. 

However, I have made an effort to purchase every rifftrax that I torrent. 

I merely urge people to donate because people are, usually, very lazy. I would rather see the rifftrax team get paid then see them not get paid because people are too lazy to purchase the actual riffs."
