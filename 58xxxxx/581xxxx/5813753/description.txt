In conjunction with Mythology Month, this is audio taken from the History Channel series "Clash Of The Gods." The visuals for the series are almost pointless and it actually makes for a really good audio book.

(There is an episode on Tolkien's Monsters which doesn't fit into mythology but I thought I'd leave it in to complete the series.)  

There are two folders..

320kbs
128kbs

Also included is the promo art.

Will seed until the conclusion of Mythology Month.

All hail the Olympians.
