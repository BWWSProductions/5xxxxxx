Chi is something we feel every day in many ways. Can't wait to do something?Your Chi is probably strong. Can't get out of bed? Your Chi is probably weak. Angry, frustrated, depressed? Your Chi is probably stuck. Our attitudes, our emotions, our sense of well-being; all are forms of Chi. Cultivating Chi is an art and a science. With practice, you can achieve results. This is a complete exercise regimen for learning and understanding the practice of chi gong and Tai Chi. A very comprehensive approach, appropriate for everyone: beginning, intermediate.
