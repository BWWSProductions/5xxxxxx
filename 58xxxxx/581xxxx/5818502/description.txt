Hello everybody!
After you install the Microsoft Visual Studio 2010:
---------------------------------------------------------
1)
you should copy the content of HelpLibrary.7Z to:
in Windows 7:
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft
(if you coldn't see, follow Start Menu -> type %programdata% and press enter)

in Windows XP or Vista:
I don't know! Look for a folder,named HelpLibrary!
(probably you can acess to that by following the Start menu -> RUN -> %programdata%)
---------------------------------------------------------
2)
Now Open Visual Studio 2010 and follow:
Help => Mannage Help Settings

if you see a window, whitch contains:
O I want to use online help
O I want to use local help
choose second one!
else
you probably see a window, witch contains 5 options
select "Install Content disk"
browse the path: C:\ProgramData\MIcrosoft\Help Library\VS_100_en_US\ and select the file: HelpContentSetup.msha
(as I had said, the path may be different in each version of windowses)
---------------------------------------------------------
3)
Click Next
...and you've done!
