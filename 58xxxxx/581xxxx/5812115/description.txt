Cincinnati based CJSS was an early 80\'s band of guitarist David Chastain. Shrapnel Records\' Mike Varney was interested in forming a recording project around David, but not CJSS. CJSS recorded 2 albums before it was dissolved so David could concentrate on his recording project Chastain as well as solo releases.

After a few CJSS reunion shows in 1999 to celebrate the re-release of their first 2 albums, a new album was recorded in 2000. Locomotive Breath is a cover of the classic Jethro Tull track.
