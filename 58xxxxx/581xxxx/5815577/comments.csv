,PhiberOptix,2010-09-08T22:33Z,"I agree with Rusticlys. The guy in the middle has this nice skin tone all the time, he never gets ""white cold skin"". Their breath is never warm. There's no ""cold smoke"" as they breath. The lift they are sitting in looks warm the whole time, no ice on the sides of it. Even as it snows!
The jump scene is just stupid. The snow is soft under these lifts really.
And as someone who has actually worked at a ski resort standing in a ski lift all day - they never leave without checking the lift. There's a guy at the top who helps people off and he goes down along the ski lift. So it's like being locked in a store - it doesn't happen. 
Oh, PS, what was up with the whole ""lights out""-scene? Why are they turning off the lights one by one, and then as the came switches, they turn it off by zones? Also doesn't happen.

,jason16424,2010-09-10T03:30Z,"I would have written a review on IMDb but seeings how they wont send an activation email i cannot so i will report this to you guys.

First things first.

PROS: hot chick, snowboarding, you get to see half a boob well like 1\23 of a boob.

CONS:

Wires on ski lifts aren't 'razor sharp' there as dull as any other cable especially being 1.5in thick. 
2. why wouldn't they have made a rope out of their clothes even if they were 40ft up, a fall from 30\20ft is survivable if they swung themselves down slope.

3. wolves almost never attack humans unless their threatened, they're like raccoons they like to investigate.

4. stupid fucking producer, stupid nonsense plot, the ski lift operator takes the last ride from the top checking every seat. 

5. Her hand 'froze to the safety bar' but wasn't black from frost bite? the tissue would have died in minutes being below freezing as they said in the movie. 

6.waste of my time, although i enjoyed seeing that guy get eaten and break his legs. Someone on a snowboard is capable of going upwards of 60mph, beings that this was a very seasoned rider, I see no reason for this guy to be caught by wolves, they run at just over 20mph possibly sprinting at 30 for short distances. 

this movie was bullshit.

Glad that I pirated this instead of bought, it SUCKED."

However the movie itself is full of errors and mistakes , wolfs don't attack human to feed .

the guy who jumped , no one has a brain would do such a mistake , they had many and many options already , cell phones maybe ? 

they said "" No one knows we are in this place so they won't come searching for us "" , another mistake .

the other climbed the wire and succeeded to get down on the ground , 2 min later the wolfs attacked him , why he didn't try that before the first guy jumped that death jump ?

BAD MOVIE , I've no idea why it has such a good rating on IMDB "
,Nevoria,2010-09-28T20:46Z,"@ Asem65

I did some research and found out that wolves do attack people, however they do not attack a living person, maybe a dead and yes they would for food.

They did not have any cell phones. If you watched the movie you should've seen when the guy helps the other girl and gets her number while clearly telling that he doesn't have a phone. They obviously would've called for help if they had a phone right?

@ they said "" No one knows we are in this place so they won't come searching for us "" , another mistake . It sure is a misstake not telling someone where you are.


@ the other climbed the wire and succeeded to get down on the ground , 2 min later the wolfs attacked him , why he didn't try that before the first guy jumped that death jump ?

Probably panic and in shock of not knowing what to do.

,Bob__Dole,2010-10-10T17:13Z,"Wolves do attack people - when there is a pack of them and no other food.  It doesn't matter if people knew they went there, that doesn't mean a search party would find them before they froze to death.

Cell phones don't work everywhere due to tower distance and mountains in the way, some pretty spoiled city dwellers must not understand this.

Overall, the movie had no plot errors, it could have happened as portrayed.  Actually it was a little TOO realistic in that it became boring just listening to them talk away the whole time, but that's life, freezing to death isn't terribly exciting to watch.

They should have added zombies, hookers, and a UFO attack."

V/9
M/3

This is a really poor film. What could have been an interesting psychological thriller was a ""blunder plot"". 
Teens in their utter stupidity get into a jam & instead of acting logically; make things worse.
Ending was ""cut-off and wrap"".
And it actually could have been unique. One of the reasons is that the concept was reasonable, the issues however were presented from blundering into straight up stupidity.

It almost begs for something to make it take hold of the audience but instead it gives you that desire to shake your head & mumble ""what a stupid move; why did they......""

Frankly I think this may be one of the poorest jobs of directing I have seen in a really long time. It MAY be very good to watch it to learn how NOT to direct a movie and design a screenplay. You may come away with a feeling that it could have been an interesting flick. 
That's bad directing."
