FlÃ¥msbanen - anaglyph 3D

NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) filmed (also in 3D) FlÃ¥msbanen which is a train ride between FlÃ¥m and Myrdal in Norway.

The video material of this ride have been released by NRK under a Creative Commons by-sa 3.0-license. Since most people still don't have 3D-TV, I made an anaglyph 3D version of it using the left/right-video supplied by NRK. My download have the same Creative Commons-license. 

The video does not contain audio.
