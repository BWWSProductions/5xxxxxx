,AryaNFirE2010,2010-09-08T17:00Z,"I assume it's working, because 120 people are done with it and haven't commented that it doesn't work, probably because they are busy playing it. Fingers crossed."
,Ratspike,2010-09-08T18:30Z,confirm? deny? Not a single comment saying it works?
,FrUsTrIc,2010-09-08T19:20Z,"Downloading to confirm, looking forward to this :)"
,Th3Dr4k3,2010-09-08T19:47Z,Works great.  Playing it now.  It overwrites MassEffect2.exe so back that up or grab another 1.02 exe when it is done installing
,cangiz,2010-09-08T20:33Z,"Guys this torrent works fine.  Dled, tested and comfirmed.  Going to be seeding for a couple days so get it while its hot.

It comes with the entitlements as well."
,JuicyKraken,2010-09-08T21:21Z,"I registered just so I could confirm this, it works great, though I did have to re-download the 1.02 crack only, as it overwrites the old .exe, like stated above. Have fun, everyone!"
,waarts,2010-09-08T22:46Z,"this one works

as said before just update to version 1.02 (if you hadn't done that yet) install the dlc run giveme2entitlements and replace the 1.02 crack

thanks a lot!! :D"
,toenail88,2010-09-09T01:44Z,"WOOOOHOOOO!!!!!!

the greatest game ever made

thank you"
,toenail88,2010-09-09T03:17Z,"anyone tested it with texmod? no problems?

thx"
,EvilAsh34,2010-09-09T03:54Z,Tested. Works. Clean. Fucking awesome!
,Zeigh,2010-09-09T12:56Z,Doesn't work for me fully. After the car chase the screen goes black and nothing happens. Anyone knows why?
,DonCorleone7,2010-09-09T13:19Z,"@ waarts

I did everything you said to do, but it just does'nt seem to work? I replaced the crack it loads up but i don't know how and where to start the dlc? 

I go on the extra content part but it redirects me to bioware's website telling me i haven't got enough points for overlord...but this isn't overlord. Im so confused"
,ard_ef,2010-09-09T15:27Z,"doesn't seem to work :( rewrited 1.02 crack, but it still says ""failed to authenticate the disk"". Could anybody help me with that, please?"
,EvilAsh34,2010-09-09T15:27Z,"@DonCorleone7

You shouldn't go into the ""Extra Content"" part of the game menu. As you found out it just directs you to the Bioware site to buy the DLC.

You'll know if it is installed when you are on the ship. You will get a message at Shepard's terminal. After you read it you'll have a new quest under ""Assignments"" in your journal called Overlord. You'll also see where the mission is on the Star Chart.

Hope that helps."
,EvilAsh34,2010-09-09T15:40Z,"This is what I get for saying people can't read. I'm a moron, sorry. Wrong DLC. Sorry for the double post.

@DonCorleone7 (again)

You'll know that it's installed right away if you check your achievements list. You'll see 5 new ones listed. 

It's not obvious that it's installed at first unless you've already been to Illium. After you've been there you'll get a message at your terminal. Then you'll get the quest under ""Missions"" in your journal.

,JuicyKraken,2010-09-09T17:08Z,"@ard_ef - try another crack, I used this one: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5630160/Mass.Effect.2.Crack.1.02-IMZ and it worked with my copy"
,Johnw81,2010-09-09T21:36Z,"http://static.cdn.ea.com/bioware/u/f/eagames/bioware/masseffect2/ME2_DLC/ME2_ShadowBroker.exe

Download the DLC from EA and get the entitlements executeable from this torrent."
,Casevil,2010-09-10T06:10Z,"Works perfectly. Great DLC, love it!"
,jolinaxas,2010-09-10T07:47Z,"This isn't a problem with the torrent specifically, but is anyone else having the video cut out after the chase? Trying to figure out whether its an issue with the torrent, my graphics card, or the programming"
,merim_10,2010-09-10T11:11Z,does this work with the TPTB version of game?
,Monoris,2010-09-10T13:50Z,"THIS UPLOAD SUCK! AFTER CHASE SCENE GAME CRASHES! WTF IS THIS, UNTESTED?!"
,LonelyWarrior,2010-09-10T20:46Z,"Monoris,I tested this torrent myself before uploading it and it works great for me and it obviously works for some other people here.I really don't know why it doesn't work for you too but I don't think that torrent is the problem.Do you have 1.02 update installed.I couldn't even start Overlord without it so maybe that's the problem.If not,I can't really help you."
,LonelyWarrior,2010-09-10T20:57Z,"Monoris,I tested it myself before uploading it and it works great for me and obviously it does for some other people here.Do you have 1.02 update installed?I couldn't even start Overlord without it.If that doesn't help you then I don't know what's causing your problem but I don't think it's because the torrent."
,DonCorleone7,2010-09-10T23:47Z,Yep its working perfectly :) great torrent
,Monoris,2010-09-11T00:46Z,OK sorry for that bad comment LonelyWarrior it was my fault. NOTE TO ALL THAT HAVE FREEZE PROBLEM: You NEED to have version 1.02 exe crack installed 1st. Without it both Shadow Lair AND Overlord DLC crash.
,Monoris,2010-09-11T00:49Z,"Once again sorry for that comment, i was ryly pissed off cos i was reinstalling patches whole day and no torrent info made me think that everything should work after installing DLC"
,crazy1118,2010-09-12T18:49Z,It works perfectly....just finished the mission...gonna seed for sumtime
,MPEGMASTER,2010-09-15T05:37Z,!!!Put the 1.02  MassEffect2.exe  in the Mass Effect 2>Binaries  !!!
,MPEGMASTER,2010-09-15T05:39Z,!!!Put the 1.02 MassEffect2.exe in the Mass Effect 2>Binaries folder !!!
,greysaber,2010-09-15T15:01Z,Works fine.  Hell better than fine if there was such a thing.  Easy install.  Seeding.   Thx LonelyWarrior
,alcapowned,2010-09-18T16:01Z,"I'm having some problems. I dled Mass effect 2 (from gamesthe4theworld) then used a Vitality patch for 1.02 + crack. I then downloaded all the DLC's and used a ME2DLC_unlocker to unlock them.

After playing for a bit I wanted to try lair of the shadow broker so i downloaded the DLC from Bioware. I then downloaded the ""giveme2entitlements"" from here and ran both the ME2DLC_unlocker and the ""giveme2entitlements""
I still get a message saying my DLC's are not authorized :(
Halp"
,Penwin,2010-10-08T09:28Z,"Doesn't work. I have a legit copy of the game and I installed a 1.02 crack and the giveme2entitlements_v2. Now every time I try to log into the network I get this popup telling me I am not authorized to use this content. I ended up having to forcibly remove the content through the C:\Program Files\Mass Effect 2\BioGame\DLC folder.

This DLC obviously worked at one point but it doesn't anymore. Don't waste your time and bandwidth on it."
,LonelyWarrior,2010-10-08T10:52Z,Did you overwrite the game with 1.02 crack AFTER running giveme2entitlements?I guess not
,Smashy79,2010-10-10T14:48Z,"Just querying this.
I'm going to install this with the DLC Pack + Patches - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5636177/Mass_Effect_2_DLC__amp__Patch_Repack_(incl._Overlord_and_Patch_1.02)

Reading over the comments, presumably it would be better to install the DLC Pack after I've installed this Shadow Broker DLC as I'll then have the correct patch (1.02) applied?

So essentially, it would be:
a) install the game
b) install this DLC
c) click giveme2entitlements
d) install the other DLC pack
e) launch the game through ""RunMassEffect2.exe"" as provided by the other DLC...

Any corrections here would be much appreciated!"
,LonelyWarrior,2010-10-10T18:09Z,"I think it's more like this(not sure though):
a)install the game
b)install other DLC
c)install this DLC
d)click giveme2entitlements
e)put the 1.02 crack in Binaries folder
f)launch the game through ""RunMassEffect2.exe"""
,roar2482,2010-10-16T02:19Z,"Lonely Warrior is correct if anyone is experiencing the game crash ""Insert CD"" pop-up problem. :p"
,roar2482,2010-10-16T02:20Z,"LonelyWarrior is correct incase anyone else is having the Game crash, ""Insert CD"" pop-up problem. You dont need to re-install the game, just reinstall the dlc, run the ""Givemetwoentitlements"" and finally refresh the ME2 v1.02 crack by overwriting and you will be fine."
,DakotaDC3,2010-10-28T19:08Z,How do i know if this is working? I don't see anything new in the game. Please help.
,LonelyWarrior,2010-10-30T17:46Z,"Once you visited Liara on Illium,you'll get a message from Cerberus at your private computer on Normandy.After you read it,just go back to Liara and start the DLC."
,brinta.1,2010-11-07T08:48Z,all this problem with the 1.02 crack!!! don't u people atleast try the iso crack??? i don't have any problem with that as u don't have to replace the original exe. try the iso crack.
,jackattack95,2010-11-13T12:20Z,as soon as i get to the skycar chase part the picture starts flashing and i cant make out anything! i can still see the hud and the subtitles though. can anyone help

,LonelyWarrior,2011-01-02T13:21Z,You need 1.02 crack.That's it
,lokikun01,2011-01-21T07:52Z,"Unlike others here my screen doesnt go black once i get back outside for I'm guessing is the start of the car chase scene, nothing happens, i can move around but NPCs are not doing anything, this is right after fighting through all the shadow brokers forces to get back outside, got a legit copy patched to 1.02 so i didnt use the crack, Please Help would like to finish the DLC"
,slaindz,2011-02-14T00:35Z,"This isn't working for me. I'm using Windows 7 & an error comes up saying ""Not compatible with this version of Windows""

I obviously tried changing the compatibility settings to no avail."
,zanakanishi,2011-03-28T03:05Z,"@ Penwin 
read comments, and you might not come across as an ignorant newb. I just installed it, works great, no problems. Just make sure you get the patch update."
,Gunfire909,2011-09-14T07:57Z,"For those of you having the problem that the cut scene is freezing during the car chase. There was a similar problem in the DLC ""Arrival""... go to Configure, then video and put the game resolution to 1024x786(worked for me). If not i presume you would have to reinstall the game then the DLC. Other than that torrent works perfect and was an awesome misson! "
,maximus333555,2011-09-27T08:33Z,"Can any one plz confirm that whether Mass effect 2 (14 GB) is required prior to installing this download? in short, do i need mass effect 2 in order to play this one?"
