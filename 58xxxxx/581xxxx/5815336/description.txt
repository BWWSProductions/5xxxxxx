Hi There

Itâ€™s been a while since I have posted something here but... 

These are all homegrown Jimi Hendrix "Alternate Mixes" that I made. 
I enjoyed some of the final results and I hope you do too. There were also many mixes I did not use cuz they just weren't that different from the originals. All I had to use was a Creative Wave Editor that I got on a PC back in 1998 and some old cakewalk software from 2002 or 2003. I mostly just used the wave editor though. The results are what I call Mustash Mixes...


Each mix I assure was not the workings of listening to the left speaker and not the right etc...

I really liked foxy vocals & the manipulated Purple Haze Vocal effects too. The Manic Mix? I wish we had tapes like these, one could only dream... The wind cries Mary swapped a few of the items in each channel. Hey Joe Guitar enhancements were interesting also...

Enjoy
