,lpmurphy1,2011-02-07T12:08Z,"Hi Backtroy,

Have downloaded the torrent and extracted the zip folder to the same folder as all the other folders in the torrent. Now what do I do to install?"
,lpmurphy1,2011-02-07T13:33Z,"Hi again Blacktroy,

Managed to burn a copy Omnipage to CD by opening the image files. Ran the installer but I'm getting a 1305 Error msg ' Error reading from file C:\Program Files\Nuance\RealSpeak Solo v4\speech\components\data\vf_tom_full_155rmf22_270_06.dat.' It seems to hang @ 17 files & gives the above error msg. I have looked @ HD & files seem to be there. Any suggestions?"
,pilot12,2011-06-24T05:20Z,"Please guys, we are stuck for dayyyyys at 98,7%. There are 2 seeders who pop up from time to time but seem never uploading anything. We are 71 in the swarm waiting at 98,7%. Thanks."
