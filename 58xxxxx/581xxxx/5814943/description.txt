I downloaded the original torrent here:-
 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5802234/Camp.Rock.2.The.Final.Jam.2010.DVDR.NTSC-[DirectasXD]

but for some reason this would not copy using CloneDVD2, some error or something, even though it played correctly on my PC.

I then re-authored the original NTSC DVDR to PAL using Cyberlink PowerDirector, this copied to disc perfectly.

Here is the ISO.
