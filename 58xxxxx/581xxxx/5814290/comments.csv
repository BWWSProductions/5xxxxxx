,Senyuno,2010-09-27T02:14Z,How are we all suppose to play ESO using the same CD Key?
,Jerto_xD,2010-10-02T00:28Z,"Its a cheap version released by ubisoft wich does not require discs to play.
I removed all other langauges sizing down the download greatly.
This version does not work online because it wont patch up.
Also uses the same cd-key on each sale.
I have a legit gold edition that works online here home but the discs are damaged and I have an eso account with it.
I searched the web for an online working gold edition but failed.
Went to the store bought this crap version, turned out it didn't work online and contained the same cdkey that is widely published on the web...
This torrent was created cause I wanted to play online with friends and they could download it whilest also providing piratebay with a smaller sized aom download.

I miss playing tower defence in that game :("

,MITCHY1235,2010-10-20T23:04Z,Hey I can succesfully add the cd-keys but then goes on telling me I still require the disks. Anyone who can offer me a solution to this problem would be greatly appreciated.
,Jerto_xD,2010-11-11T23:45Z,"Be sure to take the english flag.
Others wont work."

Same here bro I've searched all over the web to be able to play online again but I failed. Think they shut down the eso servers for this one anyways.
But thats just me speculating..."

,jackoseth004,2012-02-08T09:58Z,"When I run the Autorun.exe I can choose the flag but when I click on the Age Of Mythology picture to install it does nothing. The program just stops running. If I click the expansion it comes up with an error message.
Help?"
,permtemp,2012-03-27T15:23Z,Any word on what to do if it asks you to insert a disk?
,WezzLee,2012-04-16T09:10Z,"I have the same story - I have the retail disc for AoM GOLD but I have lost the second disc, all I need is a iso rip for the second disc or a install that works online! All the other versions of gold on tpb don't work online."
,WezzLee,2012-04-16T11:00Z,Jesus Christ. Why are there so many bad AoM torrents. This is NOT GOLD EDITION. This is the original and the expansion. Gold Edition has only one install and uses only one cdkey. I've wasted so much time trying to find a (online) working copy of GOLD edition and I'm sorry but label your torrent correctly >.> Starting to get annoyed now.
