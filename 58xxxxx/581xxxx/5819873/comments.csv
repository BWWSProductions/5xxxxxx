,pheonix3000,2010-09-17T00:59Z,I have burned the ISO file to DVD using powerISO but my laptop will not boot from the image. Don't know how to fix this one. I have changed the BIOS settings so it boots from CD/DVD first but it is still just starting windows as normal without booting from the DVD. Any suggestions? I have burnt a bunch of dvds to see if there was a corruption so its not the dvd image. Is there anyway of manually booting from the DVD rather than just setting it up in the BIOS and hoping it picks up the DVD when the laptop is starting up?

,Naethyn,2010-10-09T06:39Z,"@dieselee90

Yes, this you can do, because you are burning the .iso file to a DVD-R/DVD-RW, you can just install it as if it were brand new from Windows and use the same activation code.

@Computer-User

My question is ""How much space does the OS .ISO file take up on a disk?"" I only have CD-R and I need to reinstall Windows really bad and format everything off my harddrive."

,guice522,2010-10-10T00:22Z,"I burned the .iso file on a blank dvd and when I restarted the computer to boot from the dvd it said ""NTLDR missing"" Any idea what that is and how to fix it?"
,Schizoman,2010-10-10T21:25Z,To avoid problems with the activation included in the torrent... I installed the 64-bit of this just fine with the key that came on the sticker on the bottom of my laptop.  If you use the key made for your laptop you know no one else is going to have used it enough for it to get blacklisted and therefore your Windows installation will always be Genuine without needing the activator.

1. Burn the Image File with any tool (PowerISO, Nero, etc.)
2. Burn the Image File at slowest possible speed with your DVD Drive (To ensure best results and bootable).
3. Restart Computer via BIOS Setup.
4. Change Boot Sequence to DVD Drive first, Harddrive second.
5. Exit BIOS (if done correctly Step 6 should work.)
6. Follow On-Screen Prompt (Boot from Disk Message should appear)
NOTE: You can use a legal CD-KEY of any computer that originally had Home Premium on it. YOU CANNOT USE Other Keys (Ultimate, Proffessional, etc)
SIDE-NOTE: If you are upgrading from previous versions of Windows, or upgrading from 32-Bit, make sure you hardware supports it, as you will be forced to do a CLEAN FORMAT. No questions asked."
