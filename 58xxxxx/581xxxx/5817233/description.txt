This offering from Norway starring Ms. Lise Fjeldstad is the best rendition of 
Henrik Ibsen's "A Doll's House" that has ever been produced, being entirely 
faithful to the script in all respects. None of the other renditions compare quite 
as well, although the Germany production is also excellent in its own right. The 
Hopkins version is poorly cast in its unsuitable selection of Claire Bloom for the
part  of "Nora" as it defeats the purpose of the tale. The Jane Fonda version is 
of interest for mainly American audiences too certainly.

We have taken the Xvid movie file we first obtained and added the most lovely 
"Irish green" English subtitles using the "Century Gothic font". The results are 
so nice in this respect that you'd appreciate the movie whether you are watching 
with - or without the intent of using the "always on" subtitles as they are
attractive enough to desire, even for those audiences that are in fact fluent in
the language of Norway too (in which this movie is produced). We converted to an
SSA subtitles file the subtitles from the DVD subtitles folder. We the used
AVI-recomp to produce this fine masterpiece. Someday we'll produce a file twice
the size for even the largest screens out there (if we can ever get a hold of the
original DVD itself). Do enjoy this seed!
