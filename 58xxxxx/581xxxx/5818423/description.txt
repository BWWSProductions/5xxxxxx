In my opinion, Mel Torme was not that good as a singer,
and as with Fabian Forte, they both barely managed to
come through as straight actors on The Virginian.

At least Fabian got to appear in 3 episodes, but
it was probably to appeal to female viewers.
Torme (a.k.a. "The Velvet Fog") was just the opposite.

Mel's strong point in his purposely mellow performance
in this non-singing role is the writing,
because "The Handy Man" was devised by him and I 
think he did a decent job with the script.

Also in the guest cast is Tom Simcox, Paul Mantee,
and semi-regular Ross Elliott as Sheriff Abbott.
