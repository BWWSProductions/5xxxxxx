One Hero must rid the galaxy of evil. Follow Luke Skywalkerâs Journey in this epic Beowulf Parody. Immerse yourself in the best no budget film ever created., with slightly stunning visual effects, mediocre acting, and B movie quality entertainment. Be prepared for the greatest school movie project in history.
