NFL Preseason 9-2-2010 New England Patriots at New York Giants

Yes yes yes QB_patz it's in the pipeline =P Don't worry both Manning and Brady actually played during the first half and were in uniform, they weren't benched like most of the leagues starting QB's on week 4 preseason. Oh and I dunno whats up with the color, the scoreboard and other stuff looks fine-it's just the stadium lights? Maybe after spending all that money to build the new stadium they didn't spend the extra money to purchase the expensive high-scandium metal halide stadium bulbs.
