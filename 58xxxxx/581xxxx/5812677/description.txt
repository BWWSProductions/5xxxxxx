JADE returns this week as your feisty Psychology Student.  It seems that JADE has decided to earn some extra credit from her new Professor, and there are no boundaries when JADE sets her sights on something she really wants!  JADE's most powerful session yet, set in a real College Classroom is a lot of fun, and a lot  more powerful than you've seen from her in the past.  Because JADE is an actual Hypnotist, she understands Inductions, Deepeners, Trance, NLP, and Hypnotic Triggers.  Because JADE is from the Orient, JADE utilizes Ancient Asian Techniques and the Powerful Hypnotic Secrets of the Orient!
