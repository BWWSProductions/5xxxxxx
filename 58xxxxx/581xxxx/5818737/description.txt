Not just covered â€“ Neil has been smothered

Been collected covers of Neil Young songs for a while and thought it was about time to share them. There are nearly 1900 covers here, many from live shows. 
Covers are organized by Album as much as possible. 
I realize that not all of these are strictly Neil Young Songs (i.e., Oh Lonesome Me) and I also included some Buffalo Springfield and CSNY covers. 

Some interesting/surprising covers:
The Loner - Three Dog Night
Pocahontas - Johnny Cash 
Old Man â€“ Bob Dylan
Like a Hurricane - Adam Sandler
Ohio - Devo
See the Sky About to Rain â€“ The Byrds
Southern Man â€“ Robert Plant
Southern Man - Dave Clark Five

Some observations:
After the Goldrush is the most covered album with 319 covers.
Harvest and Everybody Knows this is Nowhere are about tied for second.
You can kind of chart Neilâ€™s career by the number of covers
The Buffalo Springfield and CSNY era is well covered (188 covers)
