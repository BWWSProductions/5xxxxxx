According to Comic Relief, sales from this book and its companion Quidditch Through the Ages have raised Â£15.7 million. In a 2001 interview with publisher Scholastic, Rowling stated that she chose the subject of magical creatures  because it was a fun topic for which she had already developed a lot of information in earlier books.
