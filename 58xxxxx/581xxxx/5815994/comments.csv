In iTunes, when a file with a DTS codec plays, my amp makes a loud click and switches, it to DTS mode.  

On a different note, SEED PLZ!  I'll give you feedback, I'm a bit of an audiophile."

The results were underwhelming. I never gave Dolby Pro Logic II the credit it deserves. It's not TRUE surround sound, but I have to say- it's convincing. "

I heard Live at the fillmore east when I was tripping on something called DOI, which is related to mescaline, and until then I hadent understood why Hendrix was considered the best gutiarrist ever, and because I started playing myself, I just had to find out why =).

And when it all made sense to me, his music... you cant even describe it in words, dude(!).

We seem to agree about some shit, go ahead an email me your thoughts on hendrix, please.

peace oot "
