'Who We Touch' is the eleventh studio album from veteran British indie rock band The Charlatans. Absorbing influences from acts such as Throbbing Gristle, Killing Joke and The Horrors, the group enlists expertise from producer Youth (Paul McCartney, The Verve) to record one of their most energetic and inspired albums to date. It includes the tracks 'Love IsEnding' and 'My Foolish Pride'.
