,claudefrog,2010-11-16T12:47Z,"works good. all you have to do is after you run the setup, if it doesnt automatically go into your mafia II folder, just copy the folder into it and say merge when asked. You then run the game and there is a new heading with the jimmy's vandetta. Been cooler if this was a sequal to the actual end of mafia II."
