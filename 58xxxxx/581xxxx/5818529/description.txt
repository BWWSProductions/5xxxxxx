      Jimmy's Vendetta will take players into an alternate           
      perspective of the mob through the eyes of Jimmy, a mercenary. 
      Jimmy is the guy the other guys call when they need to finish  
      the job. Jimmy's Vendetta features dozens of intense newly     
      created arcade-style, city-based miions that keep Jimmy      
      driving, shooting and rampaging through Empire Bay. Miions   
      will unlock as they progre, activating a slew of             
      aaination and timed vehicle miions ending in dramatic    
      shootouts and explosive car chases. Players will rack up       
      points for performance, power slides, and skill shots. The     
      scores will be immediately posted to the new leaderboard       
      system, providing extensive re-playability, as players work to 
      rise to the top of the ranks. Get to know Empire Bay - the     
      executioner's way.
