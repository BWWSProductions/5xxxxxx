,TaleMunja,2011-07-23T02:33Z,Thanx from me also. I have dvd rip but i rather watch 720p quality(less for download then 1080).
,plat987,2011-09-11T05:23Z,@ vivatpb5776 The graininess was in the original theater release. It's just due to how cameras handle the low light settings they were shooting in.
