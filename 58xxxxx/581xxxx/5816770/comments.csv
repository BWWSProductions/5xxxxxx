,kjrisky,2010-09-12T10:19Z,There are no English subs with this movie; only Chinese. Neither can I find them anywhere on the internet. Such a waste of time and bandwidth.

,brazcafe,2010-09-29T05:35Z,"This is great movie. Saw in the movie theaters. Very touching. And interestingly IMDB has the movie name wrong, I mean the English name. And hence the release name is wrong here too: Aftershocks. It is ""Aftershock"" as you can see in the poster. Haha nitpicking, but IMDB got it wrong. :)"
