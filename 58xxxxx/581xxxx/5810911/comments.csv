,yadam2001,2010-09-05T19:54Z,do i need all this files?
,sabretooth1,2010-09-26T11:33Z,"there are actually 18 seeders at time of writing this, pirate bay is just really bad at updating the figures. 

I've downloaded over70% in less than 12 hours. ETC (estimated time of completion) is a further  5-6hrs, as you may know torrents download slower near the remaining few files, depending on your clients settings. 

Just wanted to say a big thank you to thenoobish, for uploading, and I'm astounded at the speed at which Im downloading this. 

One seeder in particular giving me nearly 1mbit for the last 10 hours!! thanks!! If only my ISP let me upload as much as that, Im stuck on giving a max of 100kbs.  Thanks again, I can't wait!
