,cb1982,2010-09-10T10:51Z,"This is it. The back catalogue that Ben & Aaron charged $60 for and then discontinued due to ""copyright issues"" with music from the first 7 episodes. All of the episodes are the premium extended versions (From the point when membership started. Around episode 49.), all of the specials are there, and, of course, the very rare original 7 episodes, which where NEVER available from iTunes. This is, by far, one of the best podcasts out there and, without a doubt, the best in it's genre. SEED LIEK HELL!!!"
