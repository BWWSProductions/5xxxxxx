    Doctor Who returns to the Proms with a new show hosted     
    by the stars of the series - Karen Gillan (aka the        
    Doctor's companion Amy Pond), Arthur Darvill (aka Rory   
    Williams) and featuring a special guest appearance by     
    Matt Smith (aka the Doctor).                               
                                                              
    The concert features Murray Gold's music for the         
    television series, including his latest re-imagining of   
    Ron Grainier's classic theme tune performed by the BBC     
    National Orchestra of Wales, the London Philharmonic      
    Choir, soloists Yamit Mamo and Mark Chambers, and        
    conducted by Ben Foster.                                  
                                                               
    With exclusive behind-the-scenes access, and some         
    specially-edited sequences from the most recent series,  
    a host of monsters laying siege to the Royal Albert       
    Hall and a new scene written especially for the Proms      
    by Steven Moffat and featuring the Time Lord himself,     
    this is an intergalactic musical adventure like no       
    other.
