I dont htink this trail resetter will work. I installed this (didnt know it was in Spanish) but the norton account doesnt get block. Thats one of the ways Norton finds out if you have a legit account or not. 

Sorry dude, even if you get the resetter to install, you will be caught. 

A for effort though."
