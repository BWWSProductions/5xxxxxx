I got to cast all my friends in the new music vid for Teenage Dream = amazing insanity." Perry was interviewed online viawhere she talked about the music video. She said,

"It is gonna be completely different from 'California Gurls.' With 'Teenage Dream' you'll see a very raw, almost vulnerable `side] ... I had to wear so many less layers of makeup. I had to make out with a boy which was very traumatizing, I was kind of mean to him. I would be the one to call cut because I was like, 'oh I cant do this!' I feel so horrible. But I know it's a job. [Russell and me] understand what our work is."
