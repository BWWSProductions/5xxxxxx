[color=pink]Release Notes:[/color]
Remade our subtitles fixing the times to the exact frame :) Kept the ORIGINAL frame rate which was 23.976, resynced
our audio from our PrisM-iNK Release to make it synced....and just added a little sharpness. The subtitles are not
hardcoded and come in a .srt. Audio is our 5.1 448 6Channel Audio. Thanks to DINGIE For the russian link to 1080p
day or so ago. Thanks bro;)

Some other Random Crap:
iNK Has no joined PrisM fully and will be releasing as PrisM now.
SHK And SHiRK Has always been apart of PrisM and is now public knowledge...so big hello to those encoders :D

On another note....we are looking for 1 more video encoder, and 1 more audio syncer to join us, feel free to get in
contact :)
