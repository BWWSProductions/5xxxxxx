I lost it during a problem with a hard drive and almost freaked, because the ones I found aren't the same (i.e., 28,135,936 in size), the others I found with the same name aren't the same size. Whether they work or not I don't know, but this one activated both Windows 7-64 and Office 2010, so much so that my Windows even passed Bill Gates' legitimacy test to download files such as Microsoft Security Essentials. As for Office, I've activated it with this on several computers with no problems. IMPORTANT: type (with cmd as administrator, for Windows 'w7lxe.exe /update and for Office w7lxe /update /office2010' (sans quotes). This will download the latest information and use it. Oh, and it would help to disable your antivirus too, epecially for Office."

Second: Ignoring the threat, the windows display this message: ""Unable to access the device, path or file specified. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access this item."" But I've tried opening as administrator and it did not work.
