,shatru,2010-12-25T07:26Z,"bluray playback of cine player is not working. it said this version doesn't support bluray playback. but i can create bluray disks with MyDVD. I think it requires bluray playback plugin. roxio 2010 contains bluray plugin. I think this version missing bluray plugin. 
can anyone upload bluray plugin please?"
,redmick39,2011-03-05T19:03Z,"Murlok, sry but i dont know how to mount iso, can u help me please?"
,esejjoker,2011-04-29T00:40Z,@redmick and to many other people who dont know to mount iso just download and install POWERISO or DAEMON TOOLS i think and when you encounter a iso right click it and choose poweriso and then click mount on virtual drive or somthing like that
,Persian-boy,2011-05-16T08:09Z,"Sorry Murlok
It didn't work on my Windows XP + SP3

Seems serial number isn't enough and needs crack or patch.

My comuter is always connected to internet. I just disconnected and tried to install this but didn't take effect.

Unfortunatley I still couldn't find Crack on internet...

Find and installed Service pack 1 for Roxio but didn't take effect. I tried to reinstall this software but didn't work at all  :("
,Disc203,2011-09-06T02:48Z,Works perfectly fine. Thanks Murlok.
,Malasky,2011-09-21T12:13Z,"Murlok. You sir, are a star! Works great on Win 7 Home Premium. I'm no computer geek, and even I managed to install this.
Used 7Zip to extract files and then get to CRACK folder, mounted with Virtual Clone Drive. 
Fully installed in around 10 mins. Beats the hell out of my Creator 9 Suite."
