You Can Upgrade, Just Alot Of People Have Had Trouble Upgrading, I Believe The Reason Some People Have Trouble Is There Is Bad Sectors On Their Hard Drive, Which Will Make Windows Restart For No Reason, Shut Down For No Reason And Freeze For No Reason. They Only Way To Fix That Is To Format The Whole Hard Drive And Do A Clean Install Of Windows. But Yes You Can Upgrade To Windows 7. But If It Tells You That You Can't Then You Can't. You Will Then Need To Erase Your Old Version Of Windows And Install A New ""Clean"" Version Of Windows 7.

,rhos22,2010-10-03T10:26Z,"Hi all,

Unforunately I was hoping this copy would be a good verison, it is not.  While you can activate it, it eventually (for me 7 days) realizes IT IS NOT GENUINE.  

Now no biggie right?  Cuz you can get a patch to remove that annoyaning message.  But Windows  7 then slows your computer down and at times makes it in operatable.

Examples are Windows Explorer lagging, Internet ocassionally locks for 10 seconds, and cpu use can go to 20 percent of its max preformance.

Microsoft ran into too many issues with its previous plan to reboot Windows 7 non genuine every 2 to 4 hours.  Its changed now to use variable amount of CPU, Serial, Video, capacity.

Google yourself : Not Genuine Slow

could u give me some advice, pls?...

i've got a brand new ASUS Eee pc 1015 Seashell  Netbook, with an Intel Atom N475  1.83GHz, 1GB RAM, and it came with the Windows 7 Starter Edition 32 bits, which is a fantastic  load of CRAP. and i'm dying to switch to the Professional edition - but i don't know this Notebook weel enough yet and i was still a bit too used to Windows XP... and i've never switched OSs before...

so, what i'm asking is:

1. do u think i will have any trouble in downloading and activating Windows 7 Professional Ed. 64 bit? or would it be better for me to try the 32bit version?

2. will i have to completely format or will it automatically do it, since it is a sort of an upgrade?... cos i have no idea how to completely format this thing ;p and i don't wanna fuck up a brand new notebook ;p lol

3. is there a chance of me loosing the 500GB webstorage space that ASUS gave me when i bought it? (which runs with a proper program that came already installed on the notebook...) 

4. might it mess up the Express Gate OS it's got also installed?... 

tanx 4 the attention.
and tanx for the upload, in advance ;)
cheers."

No With Your Amount Of R.A.M. I Only Reccomend 32 Bit :)

3 Or More I Reccomend 64 Bit.

Yes The Download And Activation Will Be Easy.

You Need Too Do A Upgrade If You Don't Want Too Loose Any Information.

Other Than That, I Reccomend Always Doing A Clean Install :)

When ever I'm trying to download one of your torrents I'm getting some error in uTorrent. 
Error: The requested operation cannot be performed on a file with user-mapped section open. 

And I have no idea what the hell that means lol.  Any help please? And also a suggestion on which windows is best here? Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate? Or else any other?

Thanks in advance I really need a good OS that works like a charm with no bullshit. And as I've read the best is to write the ISO is with nero on a lowest writing speed right? I've got myself some Windows 7 Ultimate from August 2010 and burned it with Power ISO before. It all looked good when re-formating but right before my desktop showed up I saw some error message for a second and I don't know what it was. All I saw is ""Windows can not..."". Anyways I installed drivers and all that was needed like I always do when re-formating but now there's some shit going on that never has been before. Like I was watching a movie and at the end when it ended my PC just shut down. I mean wtf like. Or in one of my programs for watching videos I've been getting some errors that it cannot save something I'm not sure what exactly it was. And there's so much other retarded stuff and it's pissing me off and I don't know what to do and on who to turn for any help on this. So first that came to my mind was this writing speed mistake I made as I've wrote windows on max speed with Power ISO. And when installing graphic drivers I've got blue screen error. I found that info so I've re-burned it with lowest speed and now is where I am with problems I've already explained. So now my goal is trying to burn it with nero and using one of your windows releases as it looks they're good and trust worthy. I just can't seems to download any at the moment. :/ This never happened to me before though -.-"

Burn the Image on a 4.7 DVD Disk Make sure in MagicISO it says (Bootable)
After all this put the dvd disk inside the Computer.
Restart it wait till you see that your Computer has found the disk.
If not go to BIOS settings and enable Booting from Disk , If still not working Try Pressing F11 / F12 While Booting is going on!
