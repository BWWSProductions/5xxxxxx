,godzilla0001,2010-09-04T19:18Z,why do thay need to sling shot it when thay can just send them strate to mars...who needs big rockets like that have a shuttel attach a line and slowly start to drage it pick up speed and let it go let gravity do the rest(We need to make a base on the moon ASAP)If only to use less fule going back and forth now the base is manly for melting down metals that small drones find and then tow back to a sight where grownd drons can take them away and do there thing all this is to make a 25 to 70 person base there have a nuclear reactor way away from the compound but the base most likely to feal like the inside of a ship\sub but all space ships will feal like this at first then come the biger and better ships when we have a lot of metals and such
,godzilla0001,2010-09-04T19:22Z,the only reason the moon base comes first is becus there is so much fule being burned and all thay are doing is wasting it 
,godzilla0001,2010-09-04T19:24Z,"but i have a feeling that theres going to be a lot of pig farming in space for the gas, oil is not going to last for eva"
,godzilla0001,2010-09-04T20:32Z,but seriously if we are going to build a ship or a space station make it so it can gather metals and such from near by astroids return and and process them(ALL first ships\space stations have to be construction yards) to make the base\ship biger dont most dont stop growing some start makeing new ones so thay can start growingthen all the ones that did not stop can build something new to start growing then befor you relise it you have a massive fleet that are easy 150+floors  each ship befor you know it you have a death star size ship just becus you keep buildingit will take 50 to 100 years to do this
,godzilla0001,2010-09-04T20:33Z,now emagen if most of them ship linked togeater and made one big ship
