OK, so I still haven't worked out how to put URLs in torrent description, and Edit is still broken. But it would still help if you didn't call a cover (that incidentally has a photo of a scene that does not actually appear in the movie) a ""screen."

[T],GirlsOnlyPlease,2011-05-13T18:40Z,"I spent some time converting these to avi/mpeg4 (my h264 encoder isn't being nice) and discovered it's much more difficult to get high quality video with mpeg than it is with theora.

That said, is anyone interested in a avi/mpeg4 ""just the good bits"" version of this torrent?"
