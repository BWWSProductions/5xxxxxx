,.ANCIENT.,2010-09-26T08:41Z,"Thanks YIFY for introducing me to MKV. I have found it superior to AVI, MP4, etc. Quality in such a small package. Also this torrent is great. Finished in only 48 hours and seeded 3:1. Don't pay attention to those squeamish about large torrents, they just need to learn to open their listen ports and/or be patient. And thank you so much for this upload! (I'm working on the Simpsons now)"

Nice Show , It's a shame charlie won't be in season 9, I will miss him and his sarcastic style humor in particular!! 

please seed well for this.

Does anybody has Small wonder all seasons ??
"
,roxas_nevermore,2011-08-27T14:13Z,"its really hard to find seeds for this torrent, its big and the seeders always went on and off.

Charlie was a really a funny guy, or was it really just the script? anyway, thanks yify for this"
,ZtorkX86,2011-08-29T23:06Z,Has anyoned watched through this version and encountered any issues?
,roxas_nevermore,2011-08-30T16:59Z,"the only issue i got is that there still no seeders since i reached 80%.

Playing issue? download k-lite codec/vlc.
All file working just fine, qualities are good enough for me xcept the unaired episode which is very different from other."
,ZtorkX86,2011-09-03T19:08Z,Half the size of the xvid version but a few episodes have some bad qualities in a few scenes here and there otherwise fine. Good if you don't mind the sacrificed quality for faster download and lesser size.
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-12-11T13:49Z,"Only used this for season 7. But I can say season 7 is.

A= 10
V= 10"
