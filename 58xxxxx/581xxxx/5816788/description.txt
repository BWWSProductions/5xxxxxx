Coast - seasons 1-5

Coast is a BBC documentary series first broadcast on BBC Two  television in 2005. A second series started on 26 October 2006, a third in spring 2007 and a fourth in the summer of 2009. It covers various subjects relating to both the natural and social history of the British coastline and also more recently that of the Republic of Ireland, Norway, Faeroe Islands and France. A fifth series was filmed later in 2009. The series is a collaboration between the Open University and BBC Productions, Birmingham.

This is a compilation of the Coast series episodes in response to a request on Suprbay. A lot of the older episodes are tough to get because they're barely seeded. It took me over a month to collect every episode. Credit goes to the original rippers and releasers.
