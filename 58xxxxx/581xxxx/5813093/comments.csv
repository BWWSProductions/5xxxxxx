The quality is good, probably as good as you can get seeing as it's an older movie.  It downloaded for me in only a few minutes which was awesome!


The movie itself was a little disappointing.  Good acting but not so great writing.  I had more fun reading about the true story online, so I'd recommend that. 

Thanks for the upload .BONE., it is greatly appreciated!"
