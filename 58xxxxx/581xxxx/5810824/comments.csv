,chuf1234,2010-09-14T10:06Z,"not working on 5.50 prom-2 slim 2000

,chuf1234,2010-09-14T19:53Z,trolling the intrnet its saying you need full iso's that arnt patched for it to work............but if anyone knows any diffrent please ket me know...
,warofgears,2010-09-18T13:04Z,works great on gen-d thanks alot mate. is there any chance you could upload pro evolution soccer 2010 in english? would really appreciate it thanks again. Gears
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-19T00:06Z,"chuf1234, probably, you can unpatch this one with the iso_tool and then come up with something. Good luck."
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-20T11:59Z,"warofgears, i'd like to, but since there are lot of new games and my bandwidth has it's limits - i can't. Though, i belive it is available here at TPB. Peace."
,ruleofthespear,2010-11-12T15:37Z,Is this compatible with JPCSP emulator?
,NitrogenUA,2010-11-17T10:32Z,"Yes, but first you have to remove prometheus patch from the iso, cuz jpcsp detects it and refuses to launch the game. And even after that i was able just to browse menus, but when i select fighters and try to start a match it goes to an infinite loading. Also there were no letters in main menu. So you definately can try, but you have been warned."
,ruleofthespear,2010-11-17T11:50Z,"thanks for the heads up,but i already tried it and yes,the problems occur,everytime.any possible solution/s?"
,ruleofthespear,2010-11-17T11:52Z,the problems you were talking about occured.any possible solution?

,boogerkukaka,2010-12-18T03:23Z,"Does this work on 5.50 prometheus? if not, what should I do? Should I upgrade to prometheus 2? After downloading it, there's a book in my desktop that is named, ""UFC2010"". Should I put that books in my ISO folder on my PSP? Sorry for the noobish question. Answers will be truly appreciated. Thanks. :D"
,boogerkukaka,2010-12-19T15:26Z,"It worked but there's a part that it will hang. When always playing as St. Pierre and the other superstar. it hangs when their faces appear on the screen then turns off. NitrogenUA, HELP ME AGAIN PLEASE! :(. I haven't tried to play the whole game. "
,boogerkukaka,2010-12-19T15:46Z,"HELP ME!! Whenever the game showsthe bout of each fighter, it hangs. :("
,boogerkukaka,2010-12-19T15:53Z,it hangs when it displays the bout in the arena. Why? HELP nitro.
,boogerkukaka,2010-12-20T13:43Z,"any ideas why it hangs when the bout of the fighters appear? But when I play in the training arena, it does not hang because the screen doesn't appear the bout. But in other stage arena, it does. Why? Sorry for bad english. HELP PLEASE. THANKS. :)"

,KeirOlen,2011-08-21T23:09Z,Nice! I mean good torrent downloaded about 1M/s and works fine (im using PSP3004 6.39Pro-B)
,Sneaky_B,2011-08-27T16:10Z,"If you are having problems loading newer games, especially those requiring firmware 6.oo and above, go to PSP-Hacks (Dashhacks Network, now) and download ISO Tool http://psp.dashhacks.com/download.php?id=1931
Follow the instructions in the readme file and it will explain how to 'decrypt' the EBOOT.BIN file within the games ISO/CSO so it can be played on your PSP without having to upgrade to a newer CFW.
I have been using CDW 5,00 M 33-6 since it was released. Best all around, stable CFW out, in my honest opinion. Especially for those of us who refuse to use anything but a Phat.... 1001 rules."
