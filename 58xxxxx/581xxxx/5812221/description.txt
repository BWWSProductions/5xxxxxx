In this powerful and stunningly beautiful two-hour programme, The Qurâ€™an, award-winning director, Antony Thomas takes us into the heart of the Muslim world and through the personal lives of people, living according to their understanding of the Qurâ€™an.

The range of witnesses and experiences is extraordinary -- from Ayatollahs and Grand Imams to simple farmers; from women in positions of power to women living in veiled seclusion; from those who speak of the Qurâ€™anâ€™s uncompromising message of peace and tolerance to those who find justification in the text for violent conflict and suicide bombing.
