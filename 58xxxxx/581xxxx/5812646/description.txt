FairUse Wizard 2.11B Full Version + SubRip 1.50 Beta 4 - W1mm3r

DVD and Sub Rip tools to make quality rips

Fairuse Wizard is a easy to use dvdrip tool that makes quality rips with the right settings.

SubRip to rip *.srt subtitles from dvds.

note:
Fairuse Wizard can also make sub extern sub files,
but it's tree files and they don't look as nice when loaded.
Thats is why I use SupRip
