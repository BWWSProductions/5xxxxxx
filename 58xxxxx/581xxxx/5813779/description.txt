Track 14 is missing in the other torrents, I added it.


Before he gained renown as an actor/director, Woody Allen stalked the planks of comedy clubs across America as a standup comedian. This album documents those years (the performances here are from 1964 to '68) with uproarious samplings of Allen's live act. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Allen's standup persona differed little from the one he presented in his early films - that of a sarcastic, self-effacing nebbish confounded by the most basic functions of everyday life.

As in his movies, Allen plays up his Jewishness (a possible holdover from the borscht belt days) for maximum comedic effect, using stereotypical Jewish neuroses as a powerful comedic building block. Besides being a hilarious comedy album, STANDUP COMIC also provides a peek into Allen's writing process, as some of the jokes here would resurface years later in Allen's cinematic efforts.
