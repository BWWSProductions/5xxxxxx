           Fifteen New Yorkers go into a Friday night unaware of the      
           fact that their lives are about to change. Larry, an A&R       
           executive, has been sublimating his deep fear of getting       
           older by carrying on an affair with his young assistant,       
           Emily, unbeknownst to his stunning model girlfriend, Mia.      
           Abby, a sensitive college student, worships her older          
           boyfriend Marc, while thinking her friend Clarice is only      
           a child. Michelle is looking forward to meeting Jack,          
           with whom she's flirted on-line but has never met in           
           person. Wendy is sure she needs a change in her life, but      
           she's not sure what it should be. And Greg, a charming         
           but nervous actor, finally gets to go out with Angelina,       
           the object of a long-standing crush. As the night              
           unfolds, the characters all convene at the same music          
           venue, and their lives intersect. By the morning, their        
           lives have changed -- some subtly, some dramatically, but      
           all irreversibly.
