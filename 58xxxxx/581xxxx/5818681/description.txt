Lyrics:

i'm turning the pages
just wanna be in love forever & ever
you & me always together, and i know
i don't wanna cry no more, i can't no more
feels just like i'm falling in love
feels just like i'm falling in love, in love
feels just like i'm falling in love

listen, i didn't wanna fall in love, it's too soon
im falling in love, and it's all 'cause of you
& i don't wanna fight it, i kinda like it
love rocks & baby you too
look how you got me feeling
ima wait for this love, no sleeping
but loves here to stay, so don't leave it
& let it flow until we get seasick, seasick

they say i look better with love
but love looks better with us
i've met girls around the world
but you're the only one i trust
cause ima' stay true to the end too
you're not just my girl, my best friend too
i'm glad your ex left you
left room for me to accept you; l o v e


i'm turning the pages
just wanna be in love forever & ever
you & me always together, and i know
i don't wanna cry no more, i cant no more
feels just like i'm falling in love
feels just like i'm falling in love, in love
feels just like i'm falling in love, love
feels just like i'm falling in love

look, l o v e got me falling, falling
& this chick got me talking, talking
i didnt wanna stand for love
but somehow she's got me walking, walking
huh, & i would run for love, have an election
women supporting, supporting
but a banner up, me & her
gunna' fight for this love with no stalling, stalling

we never had a love like this,
you wanna feel my light kiss?
you eternally feel like this
so let it in, dont try, fight it, please
i need you to be my star
so when you shine i know where you are
i'll always wanna feel your heart,
forever & ever, whenever we're apart

i'm turning the pages
just wanna be in love forever & ever
you & me always together, and i know
i don't wanna cry no more, i cant no more
feels just like i'm falling in love
feels just like i'm falling in love, in love
feels just like i'm falling in love, love
feels just like i'm falling in love

they say i look better with love
but love looks better with us
i've met girls around the world
but you're the only one i trust
they say i look better with love
but love looks better with us
i've met girls around the world
but you're the only one i trust, i swear

i'm turning the pages
just wanna be in love forever & ever
you & me always together, and i know
i don't wanna cry no more, i cant no more
feels just like im falling in love, love
feels just like im falling in love
