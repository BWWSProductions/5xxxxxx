Lana tells Clark that she is moving to the Metropolis University and she is accepted in the Tri Psi Sorority, a sisterhood with hot vampires leaded by Buffy Sanders, and Lana is transformed in a vampire. Meanwhile, the chief-editor of The Daily Planet, Pauline Kahn, denies an intern position to Chloe, but in the end she proposes Chloe to write a good story to prove that she might be part of the team of reporters. Meanwhile, Lex intimidates Professor Milton Fine, but in retribution he shows a dossier about the secret experiments that Luthorcorp is performing in the campus of the Kansas University. When Clark sees Lana at Chloe's room, he believes she is with a hangover; later, he goes with Lana to a Halloween costume party promoted by the Tri Psi. When Lana attacks Chloe, Clark discloses the truth about Buffy and her sisterhood of vampires and tries to find a means to save Lana and Chloe when she gets bitten by the evil vamp Lana.
