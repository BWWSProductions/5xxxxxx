Bravo AC3."
,toastysausage,2011-01-30T15:00Z,Thank you!
,Booo(-_-)mmm,2011-02-26T15:47Z,"Thank you!!!


@ toastysausage...  AC3 isn't a team group. It means that the audio is AC3 (2-5.1ch) rather than mp3 (2ch)."
,camo12345,2011-03-11T18:23Z,"Subtitles wont work for me :/ not even with VLC! I tried hardcoding the subs with software so i could watch it on my PS3 but it says I need to edit the srt file

I just get this message:

""[The Pianist[2002]DvDrip AC3[Eng]-FXG.srt.srt]
ON READING ""The Pianist[2002]DvDrip AC3[Eng]-FXG.srt.srt"":
Cannot parse subtitle 00:00:00,000  00:00:30,000
Use Windows Notepad to edit and fix srt file.
Please note that the subtitle may not be
placed according to its number. If not found
where expected search the whole srt file.""

How do i fix it?"

,usdoingthis,2011-09-06T14:31Z,great download...thank you...
,TheMeatshack69,2011-09-21T01:06Z,"Let me start by saying that this is a great movie. Very emotional. The video file doesn't work for standard Windows Media Player, but if you don't have VLC by now you're just silly. Video quality isn't excellent, but it's good. Nothing wrong with the sound. Couldn't find the subtitles for the German sections, but there's a link in the comments I think. Fast DL. I'll seed for a few weeks. Enjoy."
,teemu92,2011-09-24T03:29Z,"Thank you, i LOVE it when the uploader adds english sub that actually sync in with the video, i cant tell you how many times i have downloaded a movie, and tried to look & download 10 different subtitles files and none of them sync right.

Thanks again +1
remember to seed people!"
