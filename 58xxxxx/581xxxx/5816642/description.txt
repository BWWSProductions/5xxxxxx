    Holby City actor Hugh Quarshie was born in Accra, Ghana    
    but moved to Britain with his parents as a small child.   
    Hugh knows there is Dutch ancestry in his family, a      
    reflection of centuries of Dutch influence on Ghana's     
    Gold Coast, but doesn't know where that bloodline began    
                                                              
                                                             
    Hugh starts by travelling to Ghana to find out more       
    about this mixed heritage. He visits his Uncle Jimmy in    
    Accra. Jimmy is the son of Hugh's grandfather, William    
    Reginald Phillips. He tells Hugh that his grandfather    
    was a successful businessman, setting up a trading        
    company. So where did he get the money to do this?         
    Jimmy reveals that William's mother was Anna Kamerling,   
    who was half-Dutch and lived in a town called Elmina.    
                                                              
    Hugh travels to Elmina to find the Kamerling House. He     
    discovers a new relative, his Aunt Gertrude, who tells    
    Hugh that his grandfather's half brother became the      
    chief of Abee. Hugh remembers that his mother used to     
    call herself the Duchess of Abee. What did she mean?       
    Hugh travels to Abee and meets the new chief, who tells   
    him an interesting tale which could solve the mystery.   
                                                              
    Hugh decides to travel to the Netherlands to find out      
    if he can go any further with the Dutch side of his       
    family. Here he encounters a whole line of the family    
    tree he never knew he had. He uncovers a love story       
    across time and race that is a microcosm of 19th           
    century coastal life on the Gold Coast.
