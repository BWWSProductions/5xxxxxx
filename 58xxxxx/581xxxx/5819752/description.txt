Special Forces: Nemesis Strike - Action from the third person, where you as a player, belonging to the elite unit fighting against terrorism. Your team consists of two elite agents prepared for any opponent and to any conditions. The first is a specialist in penetration, the second an expert on weaponry and melee combat.
Hip Games' Special Forces: Nemesis Strike, or CT Special Forces: Nemesis Strike, depending on whether you believe the box art or the game's main title screen, is a console and PC reenvisioning of the publisher's semi-obscure CT Special Forces franchise, which has existed solely on the GBA up to this point. However, whereas the GBA CT games were thoroughly competent knockoffs of the Metal Slug franchise, there's nothing particularly competent about Nemesis Strike. Essentially trying to ape everything from Splinter Cell to kill.switch, Nemesis Strike throws far too many disparate parts into one cluttered mess, and it doesn't bother to polish any of them beyond what was required to get the game gold and onto store shelves. It's a trite and aggressively boring version of what a million other third-person action games have done. And even for its budget price, it's a pretty lousy value.
