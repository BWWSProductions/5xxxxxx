This is the famed \"Tolkien in Oxford\" BBC interview/documentary from 1968, one of the very few interview\'s that Tolkien ever did and rarer still that it was a video interview.

It was ripped from the BBC site  http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/writers/12237.shtml  using StreamTransport into a .flv format (playable in VLC and other standard media players).
