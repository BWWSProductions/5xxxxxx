,ventura8,2010-09-06T19:51Z,"hero of sparta is the only game that has sd files in sdcard/gameloft/hos
in other words copy hos folder to sdcard/gameloft, not gameloft/games !!!
if the gameloft folder or the gameloft/games folder does not exist, created yourself"
,ventura8,2010-09-06T19:53Z,"for hero of sparta (AND ONLY FOR HOS) copy hos folder to sdcard/gameloft, DO NOT COPY to sdcard/gamelof/games
if a folder does not exist (ex: sdcard/gameloft) create it yourself"
,ventura8,2010-09-06T20:06Z,skies of glory installs only through adb install  
,ventura8,2010-09-06T20:11Z,if a games fails to work invert steps 1 and 2 (be sure to uninstall the game and delete all the files of the game from sd card (files always remain on sd card after uninstall) and only then proceed with  the install. always be aware of step 3 on a first run!

,Nerz84,2010-09-27T04:46Z,"I'm not sure if anyone is having this problem, but on nova i cant start it without downloading extra content (i have put the nova folder in /sdcard/gameloft/games/nova). After it downloads i can play for a cpl of time then it says ""this is not an authentic copy"". also gangstar, and aspault doesn't show everything, for example alot of pieces of the 3d graphics are missing and are white. i'm using a samsung captivate so i know i can handle it"

Hero of sparta, works fine, and nfs also works p until the second level whereit has a problem with the memory(hopefully android 2.2 will fix that). As to the other games ive yet to try and will try adb installing to see how they work"

,DevilBeezy,2010-10-29T11:12Z,"guys why does it say ''this game requires additional data to play''? I have created a gameloft folder in the sdcard root directory and in that folder a folder named games. 
Ex: Sdcard(root) / gameloft / games / Nova"
,gunmaker,2010-12-05T16:02Z,"new notice for distributers and to ALL TORRENT USERS

anti p2p organizations are now ddosing users and sending invalidated data OR VIRUSES into our torrents!!

this chocking of our extending seeding is halt !! -able!

download 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/peerblock/files/PeerBlock-Setup_v1.1_r518.exe/download

and prevent most of them from choking you, and rapidsearch for a non viral loic.exe so u can legally retaliate against them!
(ps if u do get a viraled loic.exe u can simply prune the viruses before u reboot, they sit in the main program files menu and a funny looking icon in there as well as your temp folders. simply delete them before rebooting.
