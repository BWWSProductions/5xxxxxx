Pundit Chaturvedi, a Hindu Priest fastidiously practices his religion. One day, a child comes into his life. He adopts him and names him Kartikey. The priest's life is filled with joy, till the day Pandit Chaturvedi is forced by religion to turn Kartikey away. The 4 years old child challenges the very core of the priest's belief.

What should he do? Keep the child besides the religious incompatibility or save his social status and religious belief?

DIRECTOR'S NOTE

Hinduism is not a religion but a way of life, it is believed. People from the world over have tended to turn to this way of life when faced with "spiritual crises". Unfortunately, Hinduism itself is facing a spiritual crisis.

In India, animosity has been infused amongst Hindus and Muslims, two communities that have co-existed here for centuries. Militant Hindus are being created to fight back the "Jihad" or Islamic religious wars that certain Muslims seem to be fighting the world over.

This is extremely unfortunate as the Vedas (Hindu Scriptures) prescribe "Manavta Paramo Dharma" which means that Humanity is every Hindu's prime duty. It can also be interpreted as - Humanity is the only religion. (dharmthefilm.com)
