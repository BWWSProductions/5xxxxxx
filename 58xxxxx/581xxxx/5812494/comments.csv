,sabasNL,2010-12-03T14:52Z,"@Veritas1776

Translate the text, and you would know the serial is  6DIE-UDIE-MDIE-6DIE-BDIE for Soviet Assault.

Good thing I can read Spanish, just for when one of the Spanish groups release something nobody else did."

,r33fer,2011-01-20T18:48Z,Mount or burn the image file. Install the game. soviet assault included when you install the S / N-6DIE UDIE-mdie-6DIE-BDIE (in the iso there are others) and have fun
,1shidiwen1,2011-02-15T02:12Z,my pc suts down when i start the game why the fuck?

,jackalxxx,2011-02-24T14:59Z,"i have same problem, the launcher says soviet assault but canot change to play world in conflict, only soviet assault. any suggestions?"
,squishyrob,2011-03-13T12:28Z,"good thing i can read spanish, just for when one of the kazahkstan groups releases something in japanese with russian subtitles."
,Blinkster95,2011-03-13T23:28Z,hey iam new how do u transle the languge?
,Blinkster95,2011-03-13T23:32Z,how do u transle the languge? new to this
,Reaperjr3,2011-03-14T17:50Z,"To everyone saying that it's only Soviet Assault, if you played the campaign you'll notice the first mission is from the Soviet Assault add-on and the 2nd is the original World in Conflict.  The missions are put together in the storyline and every few missions or so is from the add-on.

Jw, but is it possible to patch this and have it still work without a crack? Or will I have to find a crack elsewhere?"
,Nukecell,2011-04-05T19:19Z,"Great DL, seems to work just fine. For those new to virtual drives and mounting devices, heres another way. open with winrar (free download online) and extract it to a new folder on yer desktop. Click setup,install,use serial key. After installation you can delete the new folder on desktop. If you dont see a shortcut on yer desktop for game (like i didnt), then goto C/program files(or in my case program files(86),Ubisoft. find the wic icon (looks like a shield) and right click that. chose to sent to desktop shortcut. And then yer done. Hope this helps those new to the game. Seed at least 1:1 fellers"
,boobydlonra,2011-04-22T14:36Z,Which language is the game?
,strgzrfv,2011-04-25T00:19Z,"The game is in English by default (at the installing screens) but you have it multilingual.  Works perfect, it first installs World in Conflict, the original game, then the Soviet Assault addon. Thanks."
,Chosokabe,2011-04-25T16:12Z,Why do you want to launch normal World in Conflict anyway? Soviet Assault has everything from the origin World in Conflict.
,Ash_D,2011-05-08T14:25Z,PLEASE SEED

,joeri86,2011-07-21T19:30Z,"I need a little help please, now im not a retard and most certainly not new in playing pirated games. I know really well how to copy and paste the no cd crack.. but this seems to be the first to fail) first of all, on this disc there is no no-cd crack, so i downloaded it from somewhere else. After i double click the WIC icon, the game will launch. I can see the whole intro, i can chose the tutorial in the main screen but then, before it will load 100% it will shutdown and crash.

Im running on a AMD Athlon II X4 640 (4x 3.00Ghz.), 4Gb of memory. My videocard is an ATI Radeon HD6570 with a Gig of memory.

Now i dont think it will be the set-up...

Who knows what to do beside's buying it ofcourse ;-)

I mount the ISO with Daemon Tools Lite and click on ""setup"" amd a little black window pops up and goes away. Can't INSTALL it. 

Anyone encounter this problem? A troubleshooting pro would be a godsend.

Thanks"
,Rioul,2011-07-29T15:04Z,"i am having a problem, the torrent can't download, even if i see here that are 63 seeders"
,ismellfunny67,2011-08-04T00:51Z,Works great. Super simple installation.
,British89,2011-08-06T19:47Z,"@joeri86

For me the game was already cracked, Just install and play. If you cant get it working, Try right clicking the games shouldn't and pressing properties, Then set the compatibility to windows xp sp3

@Rioul
Right click torrent and ""Force Start""

@TheFailGuy
lol at the language fail, And double fail about knowing shit, WIKI IT pfft lol"
,British89,2011-08-06T19:49Z,"I failed the line 
""Try right clicking the games shouldn't and pressing properties,""

Should read
""Try right clicking the games short cut and pressing properties,""

I have a predicted text installed for faster office work, And it sometimes fails."

,mookey,2011-09-12T13:51Z,This torrent is mislabeled. If you're looking for the complete edition(2in1) don't waste your time; you can only play the Soviet campaign in this one. I also find it peculiar that the game executable shows up as a keylogger in my firewall.
,PDQS,2011-09-16T16:19Z,THIS TORRENT FLAGGED MY ISP FOR COPYWRITTEN CONTENT. FIRST TIME IN 4 YEARS. IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THE KEY IS DIE DIE DIE. 
,medisina10,2011-10-25T05:22Z,"HI guys!! im kinda jealous wit all of u guys bec u all seem to get past the installation process.. me? im kinda unlucky.. u see, i mount it (im using Daemon tools lite), i press intall... languange selection, next a window will open

,PutUmToSleep,2011-10-30T07:55Z,"Guess what.... this torrent is definitely flagged, the key is die die die die, avg thought the executable was ""a threat"" and in the INSTRUCTIONS file the txt file is called ""die"". a couple days after downloading my internet, suddenlink, was disconnected lol, and they specifically cited this game."

deal next time! P.s. take a long walk off a short pier, suckers.""
