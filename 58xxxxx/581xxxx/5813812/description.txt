
The Isley Brothers have had a number of greatest-hits compilations over the years, highlighted by Rhino's exhaustive two-volume retrospective The Isley Brothers Story. 
Since it's a budget-line compilation, Super Hits  doesn't come close to matching that glorious set, but it's a surprisingly effective summary of their T-Neck recordings, containing their biggest hits for the label "It's Your Thing," "Fight the Power (Parts 1 & 2)," "That Lady (Parts 1 & 2)," "Who Loves You Better" plus an interesting selection of smaller hits and album tracks, including "Summer Breeze," "Freedom" and "All in My Lover's Eyes." It may not be definitive, but for casual fans on a strict budget, it certainly provides their money's worth. (AMG)
