,x7thdayx,2010-09-05T05:44Z,"Yeah, 86GB seems a tad bit overkill. But my god, Video Bitrate of 31,290kbps and lossless audio. Delicious."

Thank you."
,envisaged0ne,2011-10-01T15:26Z,"boyforalljob - It includes english.  You need to have a media player that can play bd movies.  I created an ISO for each disc.  Mounted it with Daemon tools, then played it with windvd.  There it behaves exactly like a regular bd movie, complete with menus and language/subtitle options"
