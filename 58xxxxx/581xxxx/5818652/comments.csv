,th-mach,2010-09-08T23:02Z,"""Stealth"" Islam? Why such paranoia? Moman73 uploads many, many excellent books, including some that are (whether he knows it or not) pro-Christian -- for example, Larry Hurtado in this torrent.

Moman73: keep up the good work."

moman73, do you have Cambridge History of Christianity, Vol. 3?
