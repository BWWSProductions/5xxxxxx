Live in German TV Studio 1975. Rare outing for much underrated band. Gurvitz Brothers came from Three Man Army and before that Gun (of Race with the Devil fame) Baker needs no introduction. Snips was vocalist with Free\\\'s bassist Andy Fraser\\\'s band, Sharks. This track was on their 1st Vertigo album. Enjoy
