,myOne,2010-10-08T02:37Z,"fachman: Are you _ever_ going to release your compression method to the public?

I asked you before and you said that ""it wasn't finished"". Is it finished now?

You are using x264, a free encoder that's driven by all kinds of contributions, and you are not giving anything back to the community. 

Very selfish of you."

Thanks ""Stun"" to making all the 3 in 720p & fitting them in a single writable DVD!!! You are too good :-)

,Mr.Anonymous,2010-12-13T11:57Z,Hey.. I'm having problems with the subtitles. Why they are not showing up? I'm frustrated. Do MP4's are all like this? I don't have problems with mkv
,zdude555,2010-12-15T07:23Z,Continuing my previous comment...the rip is good if you want all 3 on 1 disk...but there are visible artifacts in the rip.
