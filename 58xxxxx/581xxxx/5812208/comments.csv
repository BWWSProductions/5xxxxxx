Could definitely be better but for it's size it's an amazing rip. Honestly I would go for a few hundred MBs more and get a better version, this film deserves it."

,sdfef,2011-08-22T20:44Z,"dude..ur torrent occupies my highest priority..1 word of advice though.if u had gone a bit larger,say 250-300Mb more,this could have easily been the best torrent available for this legendary animation movie of all times.Dont be stingy while ripping animation movie..because an animation movie is all bout colors,fantasy nd background score..any cartoon movie buff would b highly disappointed by this rip..i am still hunting for a good rip of this movie.."
,sdfef,2011-08-22T20:51Z,"i know if u rip a 700Mb file for this movie(which it so deserve),u cud put to shame all those 2-3Gb prints available.I downloaded around 5 different torrrents and all of them are resting peacefully in my recycle-bin.Its my earnest request to u that u re-rip this one as it is not an ordinary movie.u dont know how oblige can u render all the animation worshippers lyk me..thnx in advance..."
,Xian616,2011-08-30T03:19Z,I juss wanna luv u man......boss upload :)

,master_oj,2011-11-10T14:56Z,Thanx man what a movie........
,xnaevs,2012-05-24T20:03Z,"Amazing video/audio quality for its size & length, very sexy upload except for one major problem:

The subtitles are complete bullshit & suck the magick straight out of the film. I just wasted two hours disambiguating the thoughtless mess.

Can someone please tell me how millions of dollars & years are spent on a film, & yet no one can manage to match the dialogue in the film? What a fucken disgrace.

The better a film is, the more subtlety there is & precision of dialogue is imperative.

IS IT JUST ME? Searching for subtitles on the internet is a fucken nightmare.

I've uploaded almost nothing to the internet. That makes me a better person than almost everyone who has. Please stop, everyone just stop. You have no talent, understand?"
