hey buddy thanks for your help.I now active at demonoid.just a quick question.what is the procedure to upload torrent here with the ""demonoid txt file"" in it??....."
,Yaggy,2010-09-06T14:41Z,"You may not have noticed, mate, but the following:

""+Compressed And Re-Encoded Using DVD-RB Pro + CCE (DVD9 SO DIDNT DO)
+CCE Passes - None (DVD9)""

can be summed up as ""untouched""."
[T],ctang,2010-09-06T17:03Z,"yaggy: and your point is...i keep the same format from upload to upload

jainmehul:  actually TPB must not care if that text file is in the torrent because i havent had any problems...but this is what i do:
1. go to D and get the text file
2. put it in the directory
3. check the box on D and select movie and then next
4. take the tracker that you now should see and make sure it is #1 tracker in the torrent
5. create the torrent (then i usually go to torrenteditor.com and make sure the D tracker is #1)
6. upload to D
7. wait for the torrent to be in the ""pool""...check this by going to the tracker area within your bitorrent client (if it says not in pool yet then just wait about 2-3 mins and click refresh trackers somewhere in your bitorrent client...for utorrent you should just have to right click on the torrent and go to where it says update tracker)
8. when your tracker status looks normal (should say working) you can then upload it on TPB
note: i upload on D first because it seems to be a bit more touchy and sometimes wont take the torrent and TPB seems to take almost every torrent...this saves you from uploading to TPB first and it working and then going to D and it not working and therefore you wont have to delete it from TPB just to get it working over on the D
note2: make sure you initial seed [utorrent] (or start seed or whatever your client calls it) because you will upload your torrent much more efficiently....when your doing over 4GB torrents and possibly have a slow connection you want to be as efficient as possible because if you dont initial seed it is possible you may upload 8GB before your 4GB torrent is completely uploaded...this means you can be more 1:1

i hope that helps (not just you but anyone that is inexperienced with making torrents...i was there once so i know how it feels) 

@Guymovie:  thanks...i cant wait to get it!!!...your movies are still on my list but i need to process a lot of movies i have on my computer from renting and therefore am going to upload them since they are already on my computer...i may mix in one of your requests among the others though but no promises...all depends on if i rent more movies and have space on my 500GB laptop hard drive!!!!

@kimiani:  hot fuzz is already on the list so hell yes i can do it...lol :)

@SK: i commented on your most recent torrent...and yes i do understand some english (even though it is my one and only language lol)"

I can't use DVDFab 7 to open VIDEO_TS folder. Has anybody else have any problem with burning this on DVD-5 that can be played on a stand-alone DVD player (not on a computer)?

Thanks for the upload."
