,ruudsach,2010-09-06T11:17Z,"Is the language english?

someone at other trackers suggest the language / audio is in spanish"
,dzlrules,2010-09-07T02:24Z,"just download the sample avi to see if it suits you.

PS, thanks for the upload. Video isn't terribly bad for a cam and as for the sound, as least it's not muted as seems to be the case with other cams I've d/l'ed."
