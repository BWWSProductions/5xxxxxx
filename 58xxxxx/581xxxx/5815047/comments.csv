This is very watchable. The only downside and it's a small one, is that there's hardcoded Russian subtitles for the Spanish dialogue.

Hopefully we will see something like what Evo did with Iron Man 2 and make a release without any subtitles. :D"

V- 10
A - 10
Subtitles show up in 2 languages but only at parts of movie where non English is spoken and they do not interfere with the movie.

Thanks Cgaurav"

Going to download the entire file to see if it's just the sample that has 2.0; will post another comment to confirm."
,hauntnut,2010-09-19T04:14Z,"Just confirmed: the audio for this is not 5.1, but rather 2.0. Video quality is terrific, and audio isn't bad for what it is, but the Rx release uploaded by scenebalance looks just as good and has 5.1 audio. "
,hauntnut,2010-09-19T10:19Z,"When played back on a PS3, the audio is out of sync with the video. This doesn't happen on the PC, however."
,Tovansky,2010-11-05T01:37Z,played this with ps3 and the audio is out of sync with the video.
