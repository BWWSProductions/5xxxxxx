I did exactily as you wrote here but...when running the ""RUN THIS FIRST"" I get this window saying...""m: /Library/Application Support/.F9868D_FDE6_4CC4_AD1C_ABFFDF2BF7:
No such file or directory""
What did I did wrong?"
,Cachorro,2010-09-05T12:30Z,"I did happen the first time I clicked on the script, I went ahead with the next steps faithfully to your intructions. At the end I can use the program but in the lisence window is showing me I am on a 30 days try. Do you mean that it does not expire after 30 days.
If so... THANK YOU VERY MUCH for this upload. It is the best for working in raw files in Photo.
""Whiskas"" is a brand of cat food in this country....Do you own it?  :-)
Thanks again!"
,skullgated666,2010-09-05T12:52Z,same issue as >Cachorro< followed instructions with the same end result...
,Cachorro,2010-09-05T15:12Z,"I removed all files & programs with CLEANAPP and installed again following your intruccions.
Still comes up the message when I clic ""RUN THIS FIRST"" but the program is working well and no info about expiry when I click about Capture One.
I guess it is all Ok.
Thanks once more Whiskasnwhiskas."

Please explain this to me like I'm a 2 year old.  Lol."
,milo12345,2010-10-23T09:40Z,Is this for a mac?  Because the crack is an .exe file!  And how do I unpack all the components?  Help please!
,milo12345,2010-10-23T09:50Z,This is NOT a Mac version!!!!!!!
,milo12345,2010-10-23T09:52Z,Why does it say Mac version?  It's a PC version!!!
