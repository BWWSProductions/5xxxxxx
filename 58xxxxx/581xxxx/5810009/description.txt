American Princes' second CD Less and Less  was, for me, almost a sexual experience. This indie rock band from Little Rock, Arkansas and their bluesy garage-rock sound is breathtaking in its intensity and emotional release. Itâ€™s like making love outside in the pouring rain. And youâ€™ll love every minute of it.

American Princes unique lyrical, vocal, and musical combinations create a sound that ranges from Kings of Leon to the Chili Peppers, Cream to Bowie. Less and Less is a triumph of talent and imagination. Itâ€™s raw but cultivated, passionate yet intelligent, retro and cutting-edge rock with provocative blues undercurrents. I loved this album but not without exception.

â€œOpen Letterâ€ has a lot of drum and rhythm guitar. David Sladeâ€™s unique vocals are gravelly, arousing and raw. â€œAnnieâ€ mixes acoustic guitar and synthesized strings that, together with Sladeâ€™s rough, bordering on hushed, vocals create a sweet, innocent, wild-flowers-picked-from-an-obliging-field, lost-love kind of a song.

â€œNever Grow Oldâ€ has the same throaty, carnal, vocals, emotive lyrics and â€” what you soon learn is an American Princes trademark â€” catchy riff. It will have you singing along before you even know all the words. â€œYou & Themâ€ is beautifully acoustic with reverently sung poignant lyrics.

â€œBreaksâ€ sounds like a nod to Chris Isaak. Soft, melodic bass lines and pulsating beats drive Sladeâ€™s intense, deep, sensual vocals to a wet, quivering, all but orgasmic brink.

It wasnâ€™t true love however. â€œStolen Bluesâ€ sounds like the Clash with soft bits and I never warmed to it. And â€œTV Keeps Me Upâ€ is a skiffle nightmare that is out of place on what is otherwise an excellent album.

This album feels like sex on a CD. Less and Less is a sensual, sexual, throbbing, rock & roll/ blues classic. And I think I may be in love.
