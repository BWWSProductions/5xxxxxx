In Stockholm, Mikael Blomkvist is a leftist journalist who's lost a libel case brought by a right-wing industrialist who set Blomkvist up. While he awaits his jail sentence, a fading CEO hires him to find out who murdered his niece - she disappeared 40 years ago. It happened on an island with few suspects, almost all members of the magnate's family. Mikael combs through files and news photos, interviews the investigator, and gets unanticipated help from Lisbeth Salander, a computer hacker with few social skills, a checkered childhood, and an abusive court-appointed guardian, the first of several men we meet who hate women. The investigation puts them in danger. Murder will out?
