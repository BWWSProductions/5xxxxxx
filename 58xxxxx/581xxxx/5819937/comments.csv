,murdkipz,2011-01-09T14:38Z,What is this supposed to be? To Anyone has twelve tracks on it. This torrent has 21 files. Why are there repeats? Why aren't the track numbers correct? Why is there a website URL in the file information? This torrent is garbage.

Actually, this is a good quality torrent. I don't know what you mean about the website URL, because I saw no such thing. All the track numbers are indeed correct, and yes there are a few doubles, but you can easily delete those [most have the name in Korean]."
