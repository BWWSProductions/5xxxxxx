,girvan6382,2010-09-10T01:53Z,"You know, I have defended Linkin Park now since they have released there last 2 albums by saying that they are a true rock band and do have some talent.  There first was great, but they seemed to have gone down hill since then.  When I heard this album I thought for sure it was a fake.  I can agree with all the haters now that they are sell outs and this album is by far one of the worst pieces of music I have ever heard.  What a joke, this album is so disappointing.  "
,superchrisc,2010-09-10T11:19Z,"After listening to the single 'the catalyst' i was excited for the album. 

7/10 it's linkin park, for the fans who wanted more hybrid theory, you will be disappointed, for the fans who know linkin park and the musicians they are will enjoy it 

on a last note roll on the european tour 

4th n 11th November :D"
,Wezzor,2010-09-11T10:25Z,"Its not your typical rap-core stuff that linking park has been pigeonholed into. What it is, is a very political album, beautifully created and brilliantly layed out. Hands down i think they're best album ever, and possibly, with the exception of maybe Sixx AM, the best concept album i've ever heard.

,flibaflob,2010-09-11T18:32Z,Not 100% percent on this but I was under the impression Chester Bennington cannot scream like he used to. He has had a number of surgeries and he just doesnt have the capacity to produce the sound and intensity from their past albums. I believe that is one contributor to their new direction and sound on this album. Not saying its the sole reason but definitely a reasonable partial explanation.

,IndigoAK,2010-09-13T14:33Z,"I love how everybody expected Linkin Park to remain juvenile their entire careers.

Hybrid Theory and Meteora were awesome albums, but it's time to face the music, people.  Linkin Park are in their mid-30s now and their old fanbase is in their mid 20s - most of them have grown the fuck up and moved on (hopefully) to more mature music choices.

The band needed to change, they needed to find a different outlet.  This is that outlet.  You may like it, but at least understand it."
,tnoob,2010-09-14T00:58Z,"Ok first of all it doesn't matter what kind of music you listen to, your not listening to more mature music. Theres different types thats all there is to it. The reason so many people complain on this album is because many people loved the older style of linkin parks music. Some like harder/rap others like the softer stuff. Me personally I can only stand listening to blackout. Every other one isn't my type. Hybrid theory is my favorite album and i think they should work on that style more. (My opinion)"
,limited305,2010-09-14T07:51Z,Man I hope Mike makes a new Fort Minor album
,darnops,2010-09-14T17:22Z,"you dissapointed me, linkin park , you used to be one of my favourite band and i buy ur album all the time, now this crap make me think that u guys have given up on music or something. im glad i download this album rather than buying it. wish old linkin park is still in u."
,evildrugmonkey,2010-09-14T17:54Z,"Last thing first great torrent perfect quality , thanks. Ive listened to the album over and over and really like it. Never been into linkin before exactly becuase of all the screaming and racket. Just never got why a grown man has to scream like hes being buggered by the whole of A wing. So this was pleasant suprise , if your over 13 you might like it."
,tmnothing,2010-09-14T20:26Z,"Wow...

I liked Hybrid Theory, loved Meteora, and even liked Minutes to Midnight a little bit. Shadow of the Day is an awesome song.

I wouldn't exactly call myself an LP fan or anything, but I liked their music somewhat.

But, this album sucked. I literally downloaded this listened to every song once, and deleted it from my iTunes immediately. I mean, I don't mind softer music, but they don't sound good, at all. They sound like some Kidz Bop indie fork of U2. I can't even express in words how terrible this shit is. Ugh... Every song in their whole album takes about a minute to even get started. It feels more like a Psychadelic instrumental with rifting vocals that climax in the least exciting or understandable way. 

The album in general sucks, but the torrent is 100% legitimate and sounds high quality.

Not hatin', just sayin',

,Thalarian,2010-09-15T06:03Z,"The album was a little different than I had hoped to hear from Linkin Park, definitely not their best work. Not something I can listen too for hours on end like Meteora or Hybrid Theory.

@ReaperMediaUpload - So by being a 'true' fan you're saying that you basically bend over and take in the ass anything a band you like will give you. I'm a fan of LP, always will be, but that doesn't blind me to the fact that sometimes a band *CAN* release an album that is pretty shitty. Get over yourself."
,schmitty84,2010-09-15T12:51Z,"Thalarian, I agree completely. I am a LP fan also, but this is one of the worst albums I've ever heard. I didn't say the worst but it's up there in the top 15 or me. I am a HUGE Metallica fan also, but St. Anger sucked ass. Just because it is a artist that we have listened to for years doesn't mean we have to like every album or every damn song."
,Luzzu,2010-09-15T18:52Z,"Worst album of theirs, by far. Don't bother."

thanks"
,josh555,2010-09-16T16:20Z,Linkin Park became famous for their unique style with albums like Hybrid Theory and Meteora. They were albums you could listen to over and over and love more and more. Chester screaming those awesome lyrics with Mike rapping was a great combination. Now there is a lot less of both of those things. This album isn't 'bad' but it's not the style that made people fall in love with the band in the first place.
,bubunapirate,2010-09-16T17:12Z,"PIECE OF SHIT Album ....

,jivice,2010-09-17T06:30Z,"You guys are MORONS.

I'm a huge Linkin Park fan, but EVERY SINGLE previous album they have ever had has been the cliche of teenage angst or the epitome of white boy anger.


At least now they are actually being original and doing something different. The argument  for LP fans isn't whether or not it sounds good.

The fact is, the second they release something THEY like and that THEY created, if it isn't exactly what you expected or wanted you dismiss it as ""garbage"" or ""gay"".


The fact is, THIS is what music is about. Being Dynamic. Evolving your tastes. If you don't like it, just delete it and keep your mouth shut. It sure as hell won't deter any REAL Linkin Park fans, and it just casts the image of you being a bitchy teenager complaining about music you got for FREE."

Linkin Park have reinvented themselves, something all good bands do. Everyone who is complaining about the new album (that they downloaded for FREE), if you don't like it, then delete it and get on with your life, we don't care if you don't like their new genre.

LP is trying something new. And yes, as a true fan you will accept this and not abandon them. It's disgusting for you 'true' LP fans to just be shitting on the band and leaving them. If you guys haven't noticed, the world's music taste is changing. And with this new album, it's opening the eyes of people like me. I didn't like their old songs, a lot of them, in my opinion, they just put an excessive riff to excessive drum 
noise'. I so glad they finally stopped being angry. and started using a different emotion.

I agree with the comment that if you liked the older albums, you probably won't like this album. But then again, do you like any new songs? (E.g My Chemical Romance's new album)

I am happy they have tried this new path. I love their new album. And to me, it's the best so far."

So when did you start listening? When they started sounding like everyone else?
If you didn't like Meteora or Hybrid Theory then you have no say in the matter because that's who the true fans are.
I'm sorry that I've been listening since they came out and I own almost all their CDs(I don't have most of the cover albums) and that their new stuff that sounds like all the other shit on the radio pisses me off. When I heard a new LP was coming out I was all HELL YEA, but then I heard What I've Done and I HATED it the first second and third times listening to it. This is MUCH better than MtM atleast most of the songs are, the only song I liked on MtM was Bleed it Out, I still plan on buying this CD, but I'm going to be over here finding a Place for My Head, and In the End when they realize What They've done to their sound they'll Break the Habit and be One step Closer and find that Nobodies Listening."

I've heard their old songs. But I didn't start listening until this album. A Thousand Suns doesn't sound ANYTHING like the shit on radio dewd. Radio's so morphed now that they're practically deleting metal bands.

Linkin Park doesn't sound like anyone else, crymsonnite. Of course, you'd know that. Right ?
