The Broken-Down Comforter Collection is very aptly named. Broken-down is right - most of the time, the song's protagonists are disappointed, dejected, or in the case of 'Taster' literally dying. Collection is right - the songs don't really segue perfectly together, which is the only thing keeping this album off the masterpiece rating. And Comforter, because that's what these songs are if they're anything, big warm blankets of reassurance. 'For the Dishwasher', in particular, is a masterpiece that would add three stars onto the rating of any album lucky enough to include it.
