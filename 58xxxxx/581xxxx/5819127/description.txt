Braid is a puzzle-platformer, drawn in a painterly
style, where the player manipulates  the  flow  of
time in strange and unusual ways. From a house  in
the city, journey to a series of worlds and  solve
puzzles to rescue an abducted  princess.  In  each
world, you have a different power  to  affect  the
way time behaves, and  it  is  time's  strangeness
that  creates  the  puzzles.  The  time  behaviors
include: the ability to rewind, objects  that  are
immune to being rewound,  time  that  is  tied  to
space,  parallel  realities,  time  dilation,  and
perhaps more. Braid treats your time and attention
as precious there is  no  filler  in  this  game.
Every  puzzle  shows  you  something  new  and
interesting about the game world.
