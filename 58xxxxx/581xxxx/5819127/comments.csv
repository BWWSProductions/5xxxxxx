,Tectonic-Web,2011-03-21T16:37Z,How do I run this? When I join all the files with HJSplit then it makes a file with no extension. What extension should I give it?

,xi0mara,2011-06-19T13:41Z,"Hi Thank u for uploading this game it really works for me...for all newbies for u to download this game first u need to open the file using WinRar, you can just open the part001 file then extract the .bin file...once u extract it automatically it will extract those other files..

once you've than that for u to mount the file u extracted u need to use some tool like for me i used DAEMON tool..add a virtual device then double click the virtual device u created..it will ask u to choose a file..u need to choose the fille u extracted from the torrent u downloaded..once u did that it should auto run on your computer and u can see the .EXE file for u to download the game..if its not go to My Computer and double click the virtual device u created then it should be the same...hope it helps"
