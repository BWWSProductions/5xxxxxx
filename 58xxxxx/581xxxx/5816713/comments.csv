,resi10,2010-09-07T16:29Z,Oh yeah and PLEASE seed i'm stuck at 94%.. Thanks man =)
,Ryuk94,2010-09-07T20:35Z,"On mission 2 no bugs, good torrent. "
[V],Mbb15,2010-09-08T01:12Z,"thanks, I heard that you need to remove the freeride mod if you want to play the missions without bugs"
,Lobster_Ear,2010-09-08T02:27Z,"I had to create the dlcs folder because it wasn't there and when I start the game it shows up on the main menu, but when I click it it just loads forever. Do you know a solution to this problem?"
,brianxxx,2010-09-08T03:04Z,Thanks!
,nittany,2010-09-08T04:16Z,"Thanks, I have it installed but haven't tried it yet.  Once I get through I'll post back if this DLC played through smoothly."
,xiIix,2010-09-08T06:10Z,I'm having issues loading my save. It just won't load it. Tried loading it without freeride and without dev console. This is pissing me off.
,xiIix,2010-09-08T06:13Z,It also crashes after it fails to load my save. This is for this DLC not the main game.
,xiIix,2010-09-08T06:14Z,"Where'd my post go. What's going on with TPB lately?

I can't load any of my saved for jimmys vendetta. It fails to load the save and then crashes. Anyone know what might be causing this?"
,xiIix,2010-09-08T06:15Z,"Nice, now they all show up and make me look like a cock."
[T],ADHDerby,2010-09-08T08:02Z,"It loads the savegames without problems here. Im using SKIDROWs fixed files and I didnt remove the Freeride mod. Try starting a new game without using the dev console, its known to cause problems."
,Aleksa030,2010-09-08T12:05Z,"I beat the cops on the tutorial and then, when i should start the real game I spawn somewhere below the city and keep fallinf and falling, like on San Andreas. Does anyone have a similiar problem and can someone help me please!?"
,thankuforurhardwork,2010-09-08T12:30Z,Thanks mate.
,Performer81,2010-09-08T13:41Z,"Works without any problems, thanks."
[T],ADHDerby,2010-09-08T18:12Z,"Youre welcome! :)

@ Aleksa030: This happened to me also when I started with Hard difficulty. Try starting a new game with the Medium difficulty setting."
[T],ADHDerby,2010-09-08T19:02Z,"Edit: It has nothing to do with a difficulty setting, just dont skip the cut scene!"
,Aleksa030,2010-09-08T19:58Z,Thanks ADH Derby it works now. xD
,Dhatz,2010-09-10T19:34Z,I'm not the first to have his savefile fucked by by this DLC. I was 64% score 310K and had all cars that cruise roads twice one of each kind tuned to max complete with plates(what an assrape we can't type those letters there) excluding the DLC cars(I have all 5 car+apparel DLCs). can anyone upload a save with medium diff at least 50% and at least one copy of all default fully supercharged cars in garage?(preferably without DLC cars as they automatically get added to saves)
,mrgamecontroller,2010-09-11T16:48Z,"for LOBSTER_EAR

when you 've downloaded the game mafia 2 not this dlc but for example maffia II skidrow , when that download was finisht you hava a map called maffia 2 clic on it and there will be 3 different map called sr-mafia2iso. software info and Mafia.II.Crackfix-SKIDROW.rar this one do you need. double clic on it and winrar will pop up clic on the map in your winrar program and then you will see 2 files sr-mafia2f.rar and sr_mafia2f.svf copie those two files in you instalation folder in your program files. the sr-mafia2f.rar is important, once you did that you nedd to clic on the sr-mafia2f.rar then wil one outher rar wil pup up whit the fix crack somewhere in that folder you will see dlcs copie that dlcs folder in your mafia2/pc folder and then you can put this dlc and then you normaly can play it "
,morre17,2010-11-02T18:41Z,is this gonna work on this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5792751/Mafia_-_2_%28Eng-Rus%29
,Greatwhitedope,2010-11-17T18:24Z,"Hey, I bought Mafia 2 through steam. 
And i downloaded the vendetta.. Well when i installed vendetta i moved the dlcs to the pc folder in steam mafia.
Then i extracted the DLC download to it. and still gettin nothin. when the game boots up. It tells me ""Jimmys vendetta has been installed please purchase the DLC"" idk wut to do. try to install dlc again?"
,Damien74,2010-11-24T15:19Z,"Perhaps the falling through ground bug on chapter 14 really is fixed with update 2, I dunno. 
However, just take the left door when leaving the building. U can skip the cut scenes as well if you want to."
,Greatwhitedope,2010-11-25T02:25Z,"Is there anyway to run this through steam without them telling me everytime i did  not purchase this DLC, please purchase in order to use it"
,jeremykok,2011-06-18T11:27Z,Worked fine. Thanks! Any files for Joe's Adventure?
