LAS VEGAS - TV show H.264 .m4v/.mp4

SEASON 4

There are no know problems on this rip. For once the DVD's were pretty much scratch free! This is the "short" season as the 2006-2007 broadcast year was hit with the infamous writer's strike. Episodes 5 and 6 are combined on the DVD and I numbered them so the keep the episodic numbing intact.

This season is also the last one with James Caan starting as Ed Deline and the last season with former star Nikki Cox staring as Mary Connell. You may remember that Niki's breast implants exploded when she was flying in an Boing 737 airplane that depressurized in early 2007 which almost killed her and left her permanently disfigured.   

I tried to fast scan through each episode after I ripped it and watched samples of each episode for audio and video quality checks. 
------------ 
NEW SEED. Please keep this seeding as I have limited bandwidth. I will put up Season 5 after I see 4 seeders.

I'm a big fan of this show and unfortunately there are some pretty crappy torrents available for these shows and all in an .avi format

I rented the DVD's of Las Vegas and ripped H.264 MP4 files of each episode. The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using Handbrake with an Apple TV standard so they can be played on any iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes. They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.

There are no subtitles or alternate languages.
