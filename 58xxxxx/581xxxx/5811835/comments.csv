,j800r,2010-10-02T18:56Z,"thanks for this Kitlope. nice to see a full discography in FLAC. naturally, i'll be converting it to AAC to go on my iPod but it's nice to start from the original quality rather than some compressed as hell mp3, or (god forbid) wma. btw, no one should EVER encode to wma. It's restricted to windows and is the most compressed, lossy, awful codec in existence. if you don't wanna use mp3 or FLAC, use AAC (the best lossy format out there imo)"
,freedomdwarf,2010-10-04T16:06Z,"Why do people upload stuff in FLAC???
I'll have to convert all this to MP3 before I can play any of it in my stand-alone players.
Nice discography, shame its in FLAC."
