,killa5k7,2010-09-06T04:18Z,The 3rd Birthday has yet to be released in Japan let alone USA. I believe the release date is still to be determined. Cannot wait for it though. I was wondering if this works with M33-6?
,LeonBlueblade,2010-09-07T02:49Z,I got this to work with M33-6 by using the M33 6.20 plugin

It's part of the Gallian Liberation Front campaign to persuade 3rd-party publishers to localize Valkyria Chronicles 3 and the goal to provide a statistics of the fanbase to these publishers. Don't worry, it's not a virus or anything. Thanks a lot!

I'm posting this on other Valkyria torrent as well, sorry for spamming."
