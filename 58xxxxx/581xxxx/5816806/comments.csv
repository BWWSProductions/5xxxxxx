,oceansoflovewi,2010-09-18T23:43Z,"Horrible, not the quality like on itunes, subtle but you can tell, not crystal a bit muffled."
,oceansoflovewi,2010-09-18T23:55Z,"You want THIS torrent, 320 kbps, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5825084/Rihanna_-_Only_Girl_(In_The_World)_(2010)_[mp3_320]

[V],jainmehul,2010-09-21T19:08Z,"@oceansoflovewi :-
this has more seeds bcoz i uploaded this 1st on TPB and the quality isn't that bad how much you are saying!!....."
,uwabaki,2010-10-17T21:34Z,Quality is really poor. Very noticeably poor when using higher end head phones. Download the other better quality torrent.

The quality IS that bad, it sounds like the file was recoded from a 64K rip ughh definitely NOT 192k. I'm listening to the song as I type this and I guarantee that anyone not using the equivalent of  crappy ipod ear-buds is going to notice immediately. Anyone who tries to call this torrent 'good quality' has obviously taken to listening with fingers in their ears."
,BaronVonWatermelon,2010-12-24T05:07Z,"Wow! The top 100 music torrents contain sooooo much bullshit. Lady GaGa, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Kanye West, Black Eyed Peas... What in the flying, blue-blazing fuck is that all about!?

To quote Aerosmith: ""There's somethin' wrong with the world today."""

,cronz1904,2011-01-02T16:34Z,"@BaronVonWatermelon: I couldn't agree more. I didn't think it could get any worse until I saw -Like a G6- on the list. What the fuck are people smoking nowadays? I really wish I had an answer

Such bad songs. And why even download when you can turn on any radio and you'll hear them being played like 7 times per hour

People need to develop their own taste in music, not just automatically go crazy over the new latest crap song just because ""everyone's listening to it"" and then never play the song again after a few months.

Seeing this top 100 list has gotten my day off to a bad start"

This is one of very few ""single pre-releases"". At the time i got it it was the only one....."
,blazivic,2011-02-06T12:58Z,"Downloaded this and turn out to be VERY BAD QUALITY!!!

@jaunmehul: you upload great torrents! but looks like you forgot to check the quality of this one!

it's a rihanna song, so im not surprised it got so popular even though the quality isn't good"
[V],jainmehul,2011-02-06T14:24Z,"^^

yup i forgot to check the quality of this one i just was in a hurry because i knew this would be one of the hottest torrent on TPB... sorry folks.anyways you are free to download any version you want"
,ThaPyratBay,2011-02-09T02:13Z,"Can you delete this torrent, jainmehul? If all these people are complaining about this, the song shouldn't be available."
