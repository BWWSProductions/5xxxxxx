,hypno777,2010-09-26T07:55Z,Can someone please help and give detailed instructions on how to install this on PS3 (v.3.50)
,Mr.Manikin,2010-09-26T09:58Z,"Sorry bud, but the moment you upgrade from v. 3.41 you no longer can do the jailbreak. Thanks for the up!"
,ahmed919,2010-10-04T21:39Z,Does anyone know if God of war III US version contain files over 4GB???
,Quad-K,2010-10-06T07:25Z,"Its soooo MASSIVE, biggest game i have ever played/ downloaded. But it works, make sure you have a big HDD in your PS3, less then 120GB and your screwed."
,DDRobert,2010-10-17T00:14Z,"I think I've figured out all our problems. ps3's only read old fat32 drives which although can be larger, can't get files larger than 4g on them at a time. I unrared Mafia 2 & Wipeout to an old Fat32 (my old iPod) and they ran fine but with this game and Red Dead Redemption I can't just unrar and I have no desire to FTP Server out of risk of logging onto PSN and being banned - any ideas?"
,DDRobert,2010-10-17T00:25Z,"and to answer Ezel, just patching isn't the problem as ""patching"" an old 3.41 firmware for the new 3.50 PS3UPDAT.PUB won't work either.
The problem seems to be getting large files onto ps3 w/o ftp"
,MarFGuy,2010-10-20T14:10Z,"My USRDIR/DATA folder disappeared after a quick removal from usb, but size didn't change. Can someone write what DATA folder contains?"
