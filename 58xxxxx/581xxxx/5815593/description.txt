After slicing a rampaging Minotaur repeatedly with your trusty              
Blades of Exile, you finally knock the exhausted beast down, leaving        
it dazed and disoriented from your virtuosic display of hatred-fueled        
combat. As the Minotaur writhes on the ground, badly wounded but still      
not ready to succumb to deathâ€™s waiting embrace, you sprint over and        
take hold of its piercing horns. With muscle-tearing effort, you            
grapple with the monster, twisting its neck as it desperately tries          
to break free of your hold. A horrific snap echoes across the room:          
You have won the fight. His limp body falls pitifully to the ground,        
forgotten as you run off to your next conquest. God of War III              
relishes death like few other games, glorifying the downfall of              
mythical beasts, rock-solid Titans, and not-quite-immortal gods in          
grotesque and satisfying fashion. The visceral combat and overwhelming      
sense of scale that have become the hallmarks of this brutal franchise      
have been pushed further than ever before in God of War III, creating        
an experience so focused and explosively fun that it's hard to put down,    
and even harder to forget.
