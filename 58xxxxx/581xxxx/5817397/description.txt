We just want our music out there for people to listen to.


From out of the woods arise the sounds of battle.  The cries of the dying and the shouting of the victorious can be heard for miles.  The acrid smell of sorcery and blood taint the air.  Bewareâ€¦ for this has been foretold in tales for centuries.  The Gnome Sorcery Federation has arrived.

Formed in September of 2005 the GSF is out to destroy the standards of the Portland nerd rock scene. At this point The GSF is playing a frantic collage of speed metal, hardcore punk, surf, jazz, noise and really anything they damn well please!  Their influences vary pretty widely from Iron Maiden to Buddy Guy to the Bad Brains to Earth Wind & Fireâ€¦ etc.  Their main goal being: to stick to their ideals of artistic integrity, originality, and chaotic fun while hammering out a diehard following, and having a blast along the way.
