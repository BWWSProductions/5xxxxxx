[V],AlbaGuBrath,2010-09-06T19:04Z,"@ thethingy i didnt know someone else had released this, ive had it for weeks but forgot to upload it, i havent used it for windows 7, instead i used it in the way described to activate Office 2010, which it works 100% for!!
With regards to connecting to the internet, i do advice turning off you AV when installing this!! but if you have to disconnect from the internet too(which i didnt tbh) then its worth it to have a fully activated version of Office 2010"
,JesMe247,2010-09-07T01:46Z,"The ""simple instructions""?---WTF!!!---#2 of the instructions says to run CMD and copy, etc....WHERE IS THE FILE?????
I tried this and it DID NOT work."
[V],AlbaGuBrath,2010-09-07T02:22Z,"^^^ obviously, you didnt listen and havent closed down your Anti Virus and its removed the file!!

Turn off your AV then extract the files again, right click on the .exe file and paste it into your (C:) drive next open up the CMD

Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt (or just type CMD in the search bar and hit enter)

Then copy and paste this C:\w7lxe.exe /office2010
into the CMD and press enter!!
Job done!! seems simple enough to me!!
Hope this helps!!"

@ grizzmo Yes, like thethingy said, this is windows extreme loader and if you follow the link he provided to stunns torrent, he lists all the uses for it, including activating Office 2010, which was the purpose of my upload!!

@ shahe what do you mean nothing happens? after you follow the instructions, now run office 2010, you'll see its activated and if you were previously getting a not activated or not legit message, you'll see that is now gone!!"

Okay enough!!  This is ridicules.  
@code-t+c thank you for the seed.  Iâ€™ve tried it on XP, Win 7, Xp - Win7 Notebooks and Desktops.  In fact everything Iâ€™ve tried it on it has worked perfectly without one hic-cup.  The quiet seceders are done and dusted and are not coming back to pay homage until they require your download again, so weight up the positives that way. They are happy
@ all the minority of morons that donâ€™t appreciate the effort and resources that people like code-t+c give up for you,  so you can have access to software and hacks you would normally not haveâ€¦ Go away! Leave the good people alone.  Go on get out of here! "
,pirate-love,2010-09-08T02:10Z,"I followed the directions from the 'read me' file. It works, (I use Windows 7) but overall it's not the best KMS activator for Office 2010. 

I set the system date to about 6 months ahead from now (to test what will happen after 180 days) and then restarted the computer, hoping this activator would automatically activate itself. I checked the activation status with another KMS activator and MS Word. My Professional Plus was in Out-of-Tolerance Grace and the help menu in Office said: Product Activation Required. So it's not ""lifetime"" activation if you need to manually reactivate it yourself every 180 days. Some activators (such as Raz0r's Office 2010 Activation and Conversion Kit 1.6 and CODYQX4's Office 2010 Toolkit and EZ-Activator 2.0 Beta 3) automatically reactivate Office when the computer is restarted. Is there a way to have this activator reset itself before the 180 days are over? Thanks for the upload though. I know a few people with unactivated copies of Windows 7 and this seems like it'd work perfect for that.

rvcybers, instead of being a spammer, why don't you provide a real comment about why this is supposedly ""fake..."" Copying and pasting the same word over and over again does nothing to help TPB community."

,taneal1,2010-09-09T05:32Z,"Yes, the procedure IS simple. I have followed all the steps, but I still receive ""Product NOT Activated"" when I start any Office program.
"
,wilsen3,2010-09-09T08:37Z,"Thanks T&C.

The activation worked on my pc running my win7 x64 - very simple step. all i did was:
- uninstall my office 2007
- install office 2010
- diregard the patch that comes with the installer, instead i used T&C's activator which i downloaded here.
- switch off firewall and AV
- follow the instruction from the crack
- with minimum effort - patched it! and wallah all working.

However my lappie running win 7 x32 was not so lucky. what i did was:
- uninstall the existing office 2007
- install office 2010
- run the patch that COMES with the installer - that activator didn't work.
- so i tried to activated the second time with T&C's activator which i downloaded here - and this time it didn't work either
- i guess i may have jinxed it with the activator from the installer.
---> my take on this is: if i have totally ignored the activator that comes with the installer and just use T&C's activator - i wouldn't have any issue like how i did with my PC.

thanks T&C - two thumbs up!"
,wilsen3,2010-09-09T09:14Z,"Thanks T&C.

Worked for me. PC running win7 X64

what i did was:
- uninstall existing office 2007
- restart
- install office 2010
- turn off AV and firewall
- download the activator from here
- follow simple instruction
- activate with the activator
- wallah.... its completely activated.

thanks :)"

The .exe wanted internet access for some reason. Windows asked whether to allow it or not, I declined. The product activation still worked. Might explain why some users started getting pinged to death.. ;)"
,Mr.DiVA,2010-09-13T02:24Z,"THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT LIFETIME! I rolled my date ahead to November 2012 AND then opened Word and it told me: ACTIVATION REQUIRED!
but It works for now...Thanks., But not lifetime. Please don't mislead.

I think as someone else did, they rolled their computer ahead by 180 days, and that is the limit."
,Hi-5,2010-09-14T06:23Z,"This is indeed a Windows 7 Activator, but it's also working with Microsoft Office 2010.
However, using this activator on XP requires some additional files:

1. pidgenx.dll, which is not a part of XP, can be downloaded and copied to 
C:\Windows\System (Windows 95/98/Me) 
C:\WINNT\System32 (Windows NT/2000)  
C:\Windows\System32 (Windows XP, Vista, 7)

2. advapi32.dll is part of XP, but it gives an error (when pidgenx.dll is already copied to the 
system folder):""Cannot find the enrtypoint procedure RegDeleteTreeW in a DLL-file of advapi32.dll"".
The advapi32.dll from Windows is a newer version than the advapi32.dll which can be downloaded.
Also advapi32.dll is a running XP system file, and stopping and replacing it with the older 
advapi32.dll may cause problems. 


To me it's not worth taking the risk replacing the original XP advapi32.dll with the older one,
so I can't tell if this works on XP, and so far no one confirmed.

Bottom line: To avoid complaints maybe the uploader should mention the problems when using this 
on XP, once the edit feature is fixed.

,pirate-love,2010-09-14T21:50Z,"Mr.DiVA, this isn't limited to only 180 days since you can just repeat the process again after (or before) the 6 months are up. This activator is good if you can remember to manually reactivate every 180 days. 

I just retested this activator and it reactivates itself months after Office goes into notifications mode."

,ragman420,2010-11-16T02:17Z,"Great upload, thanks.  The so called trojan everyone is worried about is a file placed in the temp folder that tries to access the web, but Windows Firewall blocks it.  If you let it through it activates the product.  After activation you can just empty your temp folder if you're worried about it.  The other link someone posted that's supposed to be the same thing without this ""trojan"" does the exact same thing when ran from the command line like this one and it too gives a false positive.  People should know what they're talking about before they knock the upload.  Thanks again.  This is the only method that consistently works."
