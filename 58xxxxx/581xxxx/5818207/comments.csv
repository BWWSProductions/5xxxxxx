,simon75,2010-09-08T13:13Z,Screenshots are the same as teh 2d screener that was released. No sample so cant check. Why do people upload other peoples work under a new name! Il wait for a better copy!

,shaherashhab,2010-09-12T05:01Z,"this is just a fake DVD Rip!!! don't download audio 5 and video 6

why would someone upload such a thing and name it as a DVDRip!!!

and with yellow chinese subtitles!!!!"
[T],razvanripper,2010-09-12T20:10Z,Its an r1 if you dont know what that means search google and go fuck yourself if you dont like it dont download mother fucker
,karate104,2010-09-13T01:14Z,"Sir, you call this an R1. According to Google, an R1 is a Region 1 DVD. Region 1, according to Wiki, contains the United States. You are therefore implying that Toy Story 3 has been released on DVD in the US. This is obviously incorrect, since this movie is still in theaters in some places in the US. Also, if the previous poster is telling the truth, yellow Chinese subtitles would never appear in a US DVD.

Please do label your torrents correctly, this is all I ask. If I have said anything that is incorrect about what an R1 is, please correct me.

Until proven wrong, I will not download this torrent."

,chefgeek,2010-09-18T07:13Z,"Wow razvanripper, what a jerkoff you must be.  Just because you can type it, doesn't mean it's true. Karate 104 hit the nail on the head, and yet in your previous post, you were bagging on someone for calling you out on your BS. Piss off, you are nothing but wasted space on this site, and TPB and loyal uploaders and users this site have to screen what we download much more carefully than we should because of fuckwads like yourself....cheers asswipe."
,Notor1ous,2010-09-21T13:33Z,"I have an idea.. Why don't we just NOT upload shit?

No body wants to see shit quality films, and those who do want to see them for the sake of seeing it ASAP after its been released in the movie theatre (no matter the quality) aren't people who're worth uploading for."
,jacksparrow2010,2010-09-21T18:36Z,Fake
,Dappleblood,2010-09-28T03:58Z,"i have an idea too...

why dont you, razvanripper, not call it, ""R1"" or, ""R8""

instead how about

""RR"" -razvanripper retarded

""R-0"" -razvanripper quality uploads are like shit

""R-Get off TPB, your wasting our time, TPB's space, and a humiliation to the professional ripping sect.""

""You are a humiliation to AXXO."""

,aParadox,2010-10-01T08:49Z,"Hey, king, here's a hint- read the shit everyone's already typed out. This is a dupe piece of junk release. It is a CAM, it's not a DVD rip, etc etc."
,piyal,2010-10-08T06:38Z,this isn't a DVD rip
