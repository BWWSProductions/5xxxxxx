          It has been over half a century since true American original Jerry Lee Lewis first rocketed to the top of the charts with Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On and Great Balls of Fire. While his iconoclastic performances still define the essence of rock 'n' roll for millions, The Killer himself continues to thrill audiences around the world with his unique, scorching blend of rock, blues, country and gospel. 

Music icon Lewis, who turns 75 in September, will continue this legacy with his new CD, 
Mean Old Man, a country-inspired set which features an impressive roll-call of special guests, including Mick Jagger, Ronnie Wood, Eric Clapton, Kid Rock, Sheryl Crow, Keith Richards, Ringo Starr, Willie Nelson and Mavis Staples. Released by Verve/Universal Music on October 11th 2010, this is Lewis' much-anticipated follow-up to 2006's Last Man Standing, which continues to sell consistently with sales of over 500,000 worldwide. 

"With a lifetime of triumph and tragedy to draw from, Jerry Lee Lewis sings and plays with the seasoned wisdom of a man who has seen it all, exuding the savvy confidence of a performer who knows that the music - and the emotional truths it carries - is what matters most," commented Bruce Resnikoff, President & CEO Verve/Universal Music Enterprises. "Verve/UMe is proud to be releasing Jerry Lee Lewis' first new country-inspired CD in decades." 

In addition to Lewis' many rock hits, he has also paid homage to his deep country roots throughout his career. GRAMMYÂ® Lifetime Achievement winner and Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame inductee, Lewis has had country hits with Another Time, Another Place, To Make Love Sweeter For You, There Must Be More To Love Than This, Think About It Darlin', What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me), She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me), Once More With Feeling, Would You Take Another Chance on Me and Me & Bobby McGee, among others. Mean Old Man continues that spirit with a number of country influences as well as the compelling force of his signature rock, blues and gospel style.
