I keep getting the ""There are 0 days left in your subscription, fool"" message and then after a few days, I get just an error message on program startup.

Can you re-crack and post?? "
,brewsip,2011-02-27T17:01Z,"Good stuff, thanking u :)"
,jab4207,2011-03-11T01:41Z,"keep getting 
""You have 0 days left in your subscription""
do i need to block with firewall"
,limeydivad,2011-06-06T13:09Z,"Many Thx
Works perfectly.  Incredibly fast conversion time.

Re above: Once installed I opened crack file
& then opened the application in there.  I don't get any labels on action buttons eg. 'convert' but I click it anyway and it works.  Don't try without going into crack file, you'll only get '0'
days left message."

,PIRATE-555,2011-11-27T20:58Z,"YES, it was true for me.  You should BLOCK the three "".exe"" files in your Windows Firewall.  ALSO, block this Site:  208.67.226.9

Works GREAT when you do!  Win7, 64Bit, Ultimate.
