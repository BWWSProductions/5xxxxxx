,Piratar,2010-09-09T06:59Z,Iron man 2 Please .........
,feartruth,2010-09-09T14:26Z,"Even I was looking forward for Iron Man 2's DVDrip. However, with the inconsistency in the file size of the RIPs lately, I'm not so excited now. This is really disappointing. I wish they'd maintain the size to around 700 MB.

Some of those enjoying great bandwidth speed may ask me to STFU for they may not understand the difference. And some might wanna preach & give me a lesson or two about the quality of the RIP, but for me, the quality of 700 MB RIPs was great enough as it was.

Anyway, it's good that there are other decent options available. For once, beggars can be choosers!!! :P"
,jordan2522,2010-09-09T14:47Z,I am new to this so can someone please tell me how to get the right subtitles for movies that dont have them included in the download?ive tried downloading subtitles but they never match up with the movie always run ahead or behind the sound.
,sumax36,2010-09-09T15:00Z,what the hell ridley scott was thinkin gladiator 2??
[V],Alia_Erenel,2010-09-10T00:15Z,Thanx :) !
,egribeiro,2010-09-11T01:37Z,"For subtitles you have to look for one that matchs with the size of the release you downloaded. Best if you get exactelly the same you got, or you get (SubtitleWorkshop) and edit the speed of the subtitle from there, right on!!! ;)"
,GhostOnes,2010-09-11T03:51Z,"Funny, egribeiro. Good luck jordan2522!... and iHope your name isn't really Jordan. Size and quality are a sticky wicket. For now, to be able to get avi files, at this sort of quality; even with the size, is of great value. Stop being a brat! It may so be that it takes more work to reduce the size, etc. Go analog or something... lol"

,0skippy0,2010-09-17T08:29Z,"V=7 A=10

Is a good quality rip but is a bit grainy but that is understandable seeing as it is a 2 and a half hour movie in 700MB.

THANKS UPLOADER!!!! :)"

,lkltt,2010-09-18T17:18Z,"Guys , I know this is FXG and i appreciate his work.
but i recommend waiting till 21 september which is the official release date of RobinHood 2010 Dvd and Bluray. This one has  got to be a R5 or some  other shit. u will definitely get superior quality  and many other torrent options as well if u can wait a bit more longer."

,StanlyManly,2010-09-19T08:14Z,"I disagree with the above comment.  I thought the quality was excellent.  I've give it an 8 or 9 (10 being flawlessly perfect) on audio and video.  As for the movie, I fell asleep after the first hour.  Thanks for the upload, I would have been very upset if I would have seen this in the theater."
,Jupiter315,2010-09-19T21:43Z,"FXG - your movies are superior.  Thank you for taking the time to share.  I appreciate it! Do you take requests??  I would love a good DVDrip of the original Tomb Raider 2001.  I can't find a good one here on TPB.  They all either have subtitles that I cannot turn off, or the DL speed is extremely slow.  I'll keep looking every now and then. Thanks again!"
,KingBaldwin,2010-09-25T08:24Z,Just watched it...great work man
