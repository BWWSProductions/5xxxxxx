A bit gloomy ambient album. One of my favorite Amethystium disks. Donâ€™t know how to describe ambient music, so just download it. Or not =)

All tracks are separate & with tags. Ripped by EAC. All pictures in booklet is 300 pixels/inch.
If you want to burn this CD, you can download cole2K Nero audio plug-in (google helps you), or use alcohol, EAC  etc. 
I can't seed all the time, but I'll seed every night, till someone downloads. Just wait. I'll be happy if you seed few days after download.
If you think you want something else, just tell me here. Or ICQ 423 709 848

P.S. Sorry for my bad English. I'm Russian.
