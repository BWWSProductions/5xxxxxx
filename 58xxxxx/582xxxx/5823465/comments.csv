,Chabs232,2010-09-11T22:45Z,"Why the ""BUT"" Hellstalker ? Everyone uses that kind of crap, we ain't got much choice."
,Jakareh,2010-09-12T10:20Z,Is anyone else encountering a bug at the point where you get ready to fight the traitorous asari? When I play she freezes and doesn't attack or suffer any damage when shot.
,pervigilo,2010-09-12T19:32Z,Anyone else getting a black screen when cinematic of taxi chase?
,LonelyWarrior,2010-09-12T20:18Z,You need 1.02 update
,Hellstalker,2010-09-12T22:19Z,"Chabs232: The comment was due to, that even after 5 DLCs,  some nitwits still post comments like ""I get a dialog window saying that I have a corrupted .exe"" or the likes. Im just trying to avoid reading dumb comments"
,Hellstalker,2010-09-12T22:20Z,"BTW, I finished the DLC last night. Its a kind a of short, maybe 35 min play 50 min. at most"
,pervigilo,2010-09-13T02:23Z,thanks LonelyWarrior 1.02 fixes!
,Flakmasta,2010-09-13T13:05Z,"so, i have all the dlc, with patch 1.02 after i installed the dlc and hit the giveentitlements, what do i do after that?"
,lorelai2009,2010-09-14T13:29Z,"Thank you Hellstalker! Works great!
@Flakmasta, like the others said before, you have to apply a crack for patch 1.02. "
,Metalprofi666,2010-09-14T21:49Z,"so,where to find this crack for patch 1.02?"
,Hellstalker,2010-09-15T05:19Z,Ill be seeding until tomorrow Sept. 15 since there is a fair amount of seeders. Hope you enjoyed
,pietpiraat1,2010-09-18T11:23Z,"hey guys on my friends pc it says if i run the v2 entitlments
error could not encrypt the entitlment cache.
what does that mean? does he need to get a windows update or fix or something to get rid of it(he got his game installed on the external harddisk me2 runs without problems only the dlcs wont work)and with the normal entitlments that gives no error but still if he wants to play the game he recive the message unable to authorize the listed dlc's, with my pc i didnt had any problems at all with the dlc, what can be the problem here? "
,allindal,2010-09-19T02:42Z,"I have a cracked version  of ME2 from blaze, which worked perfectly ,but after I ran the ""ME2_Shadow...exe"" then the ""giveme2....."" in that order, i tried to open the game and it asked for a disk? What do I do?"
,Hellstalker,2010-09-23T05:34Z,allindal: You have to apply the crack AGAIN. The DLC restores de original .exe so you have to copy it again
,macascfl,2010-09-23T23:05Z,"I downloaded it and it works fine up till the car chase scene. When it goes to the cutscene at the end of the chase, the screen goes black, but i can still hear everything, but i can't do anything. Any suggestions on what to do?"
,ashdfiajweoifnc,2010-09-24T04:00Z,"Ok, macascfl, you have to go to the program files folder, go to mass effect 2, open the file folder called levels, and go to the levels folder, then pick ""Chase Scene"" and open the .dfr file in notepad.  Once there, change the value of the line
""screen black"" from 0 to 1.

That should work"
,ashdfiajweoifnc,2010-09-24T04:02Z,"Ok, macascfl, this is what you have to do.  You have to go to the mass effect 2 folder, then open the folder called levels, then open the folder car chase, then go to the file called carchase.der in notepad, and edit the line called 
""blackscreen"" and make it a 0 instead of a 1.
That should work"
,ashdfiajweoifnc,2010-09-24T04:03Z,"Ok, macascfl, this is what you have to do.  You have to go to the mass effect 2 folder, then open the folder called levels, then open the folder car chase, then go to the file called carchase.der in notepad, and edit the line called

,DelyarP,2010-09-29T19:17Z,"I have the same problem, screen goes black. Can't find levels folder.... And if to play Overlord, game crashes after entering Hammerhead."
,wawawa123,2010-09-30T17:09Z,for some poeple going in to the mass effect 2 configurer and turning off motion blur works so maybe u shuld try that.
,blazzox,2010-10-11T21:38Z,@Flakmasta after you do that u have to PLAY!!!!!
,macascfl,2010-10-21T05:02Z,i also have the same problem as delyar with overlord. any solutions?
,kinteo,2010-10-25T11:02Z,"when i click on ME2_ShadowBroker, it says Mass Effect 2 needs to be installed first. can someone please help ? what should i do ?"
,snyp3r5,2010-10-28T22:03Z,"No, this does not fucking work, it will ruin your game."
,brandon509,2010-11-06T08:17Z,"just loaded up for me... havent beat it yet but wanted to confirm this works.

,brandon509,2010-11-06T08:18Z,you need to re-apply the 1.02 crack. Its the same one that comes with the RAZOR911 crack
,yogiman,2010-11-14T00:24Z,"Since installing I cannot resume my saved games, but get this message:
The selected game cannot be loaded. The following downloadable content missing: firewalker mission pack.

I have reinstalled the firewalker pack, still doesn't work. Please advise.

You've ruined my half completed insanity level game Hellstalker... NO SKULL FOR YOU!"
,tanknitro,2010-11-28T03:16Z,"hey guys, got the whole black screen at the car chase problem. can't find the levels folder , it just doen't exist. anyways, need help Pronto. THANX"
,Bruno_ra,2010-12-08T03:06Z,"Ok guys so IÂ´ve been reading the comments and apparently macascfl is right, i canÂ´t find the levels folder either...

Would appreciate if anyone could give me a hand on how to solve the black screen at the car chase cutscene...

Thanks"
,Bruno_ra,2010-12-08T21:56Z,"Ok so guys I figured out how to fix both the Lair Of The Shadow Broker (car chase black screen) and The Overlord (Hammerhead crash). 

This worked for me so give it a try. 

1. I installed Razor1911 release of Mass Effect 2.
2. Installed al DLC's including Lair of the Shadow Broker and Overlord.
3. Updated to version 1.02 (at this time it still gave me black screen and crash using Razor1911 crack)
4. Downloaded Vitality's crack and voila it worked just fine.

Just google (Vty 0315 7z) and it should be pretty easy. Copy crack to directory and overwrite.

Hope it helps.
Enjoy"
,yogiman,2010-12-17T02:37Z,link?
,wrathbreaker,2010-12-19T00:44Z,"damn i got the game working with the rest of the other majority of DLC, i installed this one and it says cd key check. someone help me please "
,wrathbreaker,2010-12-19T00:59Z,pfff w/e ive fixed it 5 mins ago.....thanks for the DLC anyway
,wrathbreaker,2010-12-19T01:03Z,"sorry third post...for those who got a problem...try this

1. turn off feedback and online settings at options
2. install the DLC(works for all DLC until step 3 only)
3. install patch 1.02
4. find a crack then copy paste it to binaries on your installer directory 
5. run the crack to play game "
,auricon69,2010-12-20T09:50Z,So I have a question. i have all the DLC working except for this one. all the right dlc shows up in my questlog like the armor suits and overlord but there is nothing about LotSB at all. Is that supposed to be right?
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-12-21T06:35Z,"@auricon69

I don't think you get any notification of this DLC until it gets activated by doing the Horizon mission and after you've collected, Garrus, Jack, Grunt and Mordin. Apparently you will receive a message from the Illusive man about it.

Also, it doesn't recommend even doing this DLC until you've finished the game anyway... as most of its dialog is consistent with having finished the game. Just FYI.

At least that's what the wiki says... I hope its true. lol"
,Mart726,2010-12-26T13:33Z,"Hello. I've installed Mass Effect 2 eng version, then I've installed this DLC. For the first time I run it I got the error message about conflict of DLC with the game. Then I've installed giveme2entitlements_v2.exe. From that point I don't get any message but I DON'T HAVE THE DLC IN THE GAME MENU EITHER! 
What can I do?
I've tried ME2_AuthPatch.exe too and it does not enable the DLC either.

I don't want to play the ME2 original story but should I to unlock the DLC? What is the problem?"
,ardus666,2011-02-22T03:39Z,"I am using Windows 7 Pro, does anyone know how I can get this DLC to work if I have the STEAM version of Mass Effect 2? 

Any help would be appreciated. "
