,bpkdasbaum,2010-11-26T21:56Z,"the original series was 4:3 ratio and the guy who ""reencoded"" it, simply saved it to 16:9, thus stretching the video instead of trimming or widening the video resulting in a distorted picture ... 

dont download this "
,pkryder,2011-01-30T12:55Z,"Sorry Kittyfuzz but this is shit, thank fuck I only downloaded the one episode. This is 4:3 stretched to 16:9 and it looks shit. You can reset the ratio in VLC but why bother get these instead:
