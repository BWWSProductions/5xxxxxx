,Comptonius213,2010-12-24T20:35Z,"This album filled a musical void in my life that I never really noticed until I listened all the way through.. Its like I've been waiting 20 years for this.. Mirage - Awesome blend of classic and modern elements.. Feels So Good - So smooth its intoxicating.. Virtual Friend - Experimental Dance? Wow.. Love Too Hard - Story of my life..

This is an album you'll gladly buy after hearing..

And the torrent itself is stellar, no clips, bleeps, or breaks...

Go to ASOT 500 on your continent!! Happy Holidays!!
