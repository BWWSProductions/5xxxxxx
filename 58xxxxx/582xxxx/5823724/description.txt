America Live at the Sydney Opera House  was filmed during the band's January 2004 tour of Australia. Bunnell and Beckley are obviously the front men of the outfit, and on the night they were supported by Michael Woods on lead guitar, Richard Campbell on bass and long-serving drummer Willie Leacox. The group played two shows at the Opera House as part of their Australian tour, with both shows sold out.
