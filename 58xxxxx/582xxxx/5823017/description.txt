          PLOT SUMMARY             
                                                                            
        
         It has been said that since the first fleet arrived Australians 
         have been unsure whether they were on the side of the convicts or 
         the guards. From that moment allegations of corruption and the 
         Australian Police have never been far apart.

         By the 1970's many began to suspect that the 16,000 member New 
         South Wales police force - the third largest in the world - was 
         rotten with entrenched corruption. There was talk of high level 
         police protecting drug dealers and trafficking drugs themselves, 
         of police involved in assault, in verballing, in fabricating 
         evidence... even in murder. If true, this was not a case of a few 
         bad apples but a diseased crop - the police were out of control.

         In 1994 an extraordinary confluence of events allowed a now legendary 
         team of corruption fighters to take them on. To do so they unleashed a
         n investigative model so extreme, it seemed to challenge the very 
         boundaries of justice itself.

         Told by the key players themselves: Independent MP John Hatton, 
         Justice James Wood, Counsels Gary Crooke and John Agius, and 
         Investigator Nigel Hadgkiss, The Inquisition is the story of 
         the Wood Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service that became 
         an international model for battling entrenched corruption. Like 
         The Untouchables, the stakes were high in their unprecedented 
         investigation. For many, it was a matter of life or death.
