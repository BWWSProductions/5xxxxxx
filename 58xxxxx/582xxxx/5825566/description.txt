hey peeps - 

sweet album of soothing bits, thought inducing & somewhat rare - ripped from the original CD into 320kbps VBR MP3's.  included is the FLAC w/ corresponding .cue & the cover pic.  sounds great in my various players.

simply tick the box(es) with the folder(s) of files you wish to download.  please ask questions or use your favorite googler if you're not sure of what to do with these files.

question, comments & uprates always welcomed...

please remember the motto - "seed, seed til your eye dem bleed" !!

capitalism is an economic prison - wage slavery means we are ALL prisoners of our various economies - some are more adversely affected. help crush this amoral + inhuman system...

much love, frosty

This review is from: Something Borrowed Something Blue (Audio CD) 
Everything on Scape (Pole/Stefan Betke's label) has been good but this is definitely one of the stand out records. In a similar vein as the earlier Pole material with the whole dub foundation, but different enough to constitute it's own thing. In my opinion this is what a lot of people are trying to do with the integration of the organic/electronic sound, but this just nails it. Buy it.
