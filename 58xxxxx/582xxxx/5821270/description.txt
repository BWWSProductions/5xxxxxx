Please help seed these FLACs! 


Consider this a little project for me since I noticed not a decent 1980â€™s FLAC download available on the torrent network. Believe me when I say this took quite some time to rip, download, tag, audiocheck and finally upload. Some of these are my own rips and some are taken from torrent sites. I used a program called audiochecker to validate how authentic the FLACs that I downloaded are and the log is included in this torrent (check in the Audiochecker folder). Of course there is no log or cue file with such a torrent but rest assured the rips that I did originally had them and many of the ones I downloaded had them too but I didnâ€™t bother including.

Audiochecker isnâ€™t 100% accurate either. For instance, â€œOne Day in Your Lifeâ€ by 54-40 comes back as 95% MPEG. I donâ€™t understand this at all since I ripped it myself into FLAC. Also, it shows that â€œBack To Paradiseâ€ by 38 Special is 54% CDDA and the rest of the tracks are 100%. This is the same 38 Special Greatest Hits torrent I downloaded so why is one track at 54% and all the others at 100%? The ones that come up as ERROR Iâ€™m not sure about either â€“ many of them I ripped myself (Blue Rodeo, Luba and a few more) So use Audiochecker more as a guideline for quality rather than the absolute truth because I can guarantee its not 100% accurate with its results and can be misleading.


Also, I left the tracks as is. No equalization, no Replay Gain, no nothing. I figured if anyone wanted to "fix" the tracks to their liking they could do it on their end. Some tracks are from"remastered" sources so the volume is much louder than other tracks that haven't been. I don't really consider a lot of remastered music remastered since all they do is up the levels (compression and not in a mp3 sort of way) and brickwall the sound. Most Joe Six Packs prefer this type of sound but the rest of us that actually know what a good recording sounds like (something called Dynamic range that is all but dissappearing in modern recordings) hates this effect.

Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s a lot more songs that could have been put into this torrent but after a month of working on it I just wanted to start uploading. Iâ€™m hoping this will meet the needs of a great 1980â€™s FLAC torrent.
