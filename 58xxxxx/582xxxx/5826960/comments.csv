@All New Guys
Please keep the torrents on, do not remove them after you are finished with download. Keep Ratio above 1:1. And dont worry your ISP donot charge you for the uploads. So help Others. sharing is Caring. God Bless "

I now live in Thailand and while F1 it is sometimes available live, the coverage is not as comprehensive is that which I was used to in the UK.
Thank you so much and I do hope you do not tire of providing the torrent.
Best wishes. "
