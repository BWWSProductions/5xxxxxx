This isnt one i was going to release but ive been asked quite a few times now so while ive had some time this is what ive come up with .....

This is taken from IMAGINES release - Thanks 

1st 5 mins are from the 3D release the rest is 2D so if you never read this ......dont blame me which you will as you never read this ......

Played around with the hue and saturation levels a touch of smoother and a slight change in contrast ..

So if your not sick and tired of Piranha heres another copy of it to have a look at ...Every encoder has a different take on things what i like you may not and vice versa ...Enough babbling now ...Enjoy !
