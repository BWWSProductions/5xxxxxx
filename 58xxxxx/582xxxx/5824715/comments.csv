[T],n2kmaster,2010-09-11T16:41Z,"Ill also add here, i read about the blurriness of the cam version, the increase in dpi has dropped the autofocus bs down quite a bit, watching the copy now myself, considerably better than the original from what i can tell."
[T],n2kmaster,2010-09-11T17:23Z,"K spoke to soon, night scenes when the autofocus goes nuts is still a little hard to see, still better than the original, ill be taking a second pass at this one, i know that can be improved a lot"
,dac1949,2010-09-11T17:36Z,"Its CAM, dont waste your time.
Wait for DVDscr, R5, ... "
,RIggsta,2010-09-11T19:12Z,"This is crappy, but thanks none the less...."
[T],n2kmaster,2010-09-11T22:05Z,"K first off dac1949 there is no DVD screener or R5 version, like the comments told you IT WAS A CAM. Rigsta this is the best version online, until my 1080dpi version hits tonight but at least you said thanks cuz after all it is free and not everyone wants to wait for the DVD screener or R5, the ones who complain should pay to go see in the theaters rather than bitch about the best copy online and those are the ones who completely forget ITS FREE!"
[T],n2kmaster,2010-09-11T22:08Z,"so anyway dac1949 when are you gonna contribute to the site, you know with actual torrents instead of opinion? "
,Pr3dator.AL,2010-09-12T00:15Z,How come no HD copy of this movie like all the other ones?! it's been a while since it got released though.!.
[T],n2kmaster,2010-09-12T00:52Z,"i heard there's a R5 out but no one can verify cuz of the fakes out there, ill keep you posted, btw its an imagine release as well dunno what his qualities like or what the sound is like or even if its true that theres an r5 of it out. I figured the screener or whatever would be out by now as well. But wa wa waaaaaaaa no better copies. So far this is as close as we got to r5 or better"
[T],n2kmaster,2010-09-12T02:21Z,anyone know if the spanish versions have better night scene or not? 
[T],n2kmaster,2010-09-12T04:10Z,"nvm checked the spanish copies, EVERYONE has the same copy lol, I guess I was the first again to at least try and clean it up"
,dardar6t9,2010-09-12T05:33Z,cant be long till an R5 or even dvd release.....its been off at the theatres for over a month or more. I'll wait. Wouldn't d/l a TS unless it was in 264 or matroska anyway......over 1Gb for crap....saving my bandwidth ;-) Have a nice day
,sudhiraju,2010-09-12T10:23Z,same old onez 
,dac1949,2010-09-12T18:33Z,"n2kmaster, Keep your temper!

,Pr3dator.AL,2010-09-14T23:49Z,Cmon DVD Rip ASAP pls!
,defecator,2010-09-15T19:58Z,"This is the same file as the PrisM release. I tried to do a comparison and when I didn't see ANY difference at all between this and PrisM, I checked the sizes of the files - 1267288064 Bytes each.

Sorry n2kmaster, but apparently you got your shit mixed up."
,billyboy999,2010-09-17T21:12Z,"Its no even called ""The Predators"" wank-job.....And what is it with this fukkin torrent man?? It's a decent movie and its taking ages for even a watchable cam to come out...Whats the fkkin point of 'torrents'when you have to wait for the DVD to come out to get a decent copy of the film......Jeeezzz!!!!!!!!!"
,Pr3dator.AL,2010-09-20T00:00Z,Why the fuck does it take so long for a DVD Rip?!
[T],n2kmaster,2010-09-21T21:41Z,"I love how all you such talent mouths here can't read a description, i dont claim its a cam, I told you it was Prism release with fixes, like dig the crap out of your ears and eyes before you open your mouths. I'm looking your way you no contributors"
,MikeUSMC,2010-09-22T05:03Z,"N2KMaster,  Thank you."
,defecator,2010-09-22T10:21Z,"Tell me, n2kmaster, why does this file have a MD5 checksum of 161edf625d7b20b69c0ea94dbd851496,
which is EXACTLY THE SAME as the original PrisM release?! There is NOTHING changed about it!

This IS bit-for-bit a COPY (not a remaster) of the PrisM release and I can say that for sure. For those in doubt - do a quick MD5 check."
[T],n2kmaster,2010-10-03T05:54Z,"Are you an idiot, 1 its different resolution and dpi of prism release, 2 its a different codec, 3 why did i spend 8 hours working it thro Watermark Master which i used for all my Reworkz. Anything else you wanna bitch about? My feelings aren't hurt here in the slightest. I'll get over it and upload more."
[T],n2kmaster,2010-10-03T05:55Z,"oh and to also add to that, it was then converted from MP4 back into even higher resolution after thru Ultra MP4 Converter into AVI format. This is no bit for bit copy. AT ALL. "
