Red Dwarf Remastered
(The Bodysnatcher Collection)
DISC 2: Red Dwarf Remastered Series One

Red Dwarf Remastered was an attempt in 1998 to bring the first three series of TV comedy Red Dwarf up-to-date. A collaborative effort between BBC Worldwide and Grant Naylor Productions, it was hoped that remastered versions of the episodes would prove more appealing to broadcasters in international territories. Only Series I-III were remastered.

Red Dwarf Remastered series one contains the same 6 episodes as the original Red Dwarf series one, but with differences as listed below:

   * Replacement opening credits.
   * All new computer generated special effects of Red Dwarf flying through space.
   * Additional post-production video effects.
   * Most other model shots of crafts in space being replaced with CGI.
   * Further computer generated additions and replacements.
   * Additional bluescreen elements being applied to particular scenes.
   * Replacement music and audio effects being applied to all scenes.
   * All videotape work being filmized, giving a look similar to Red Dwarf series 7.
   * Cropping of the top and bottom of the original picture to leave a 14:9 picture.
   * Occasional close-up scenes with Holly being re-filmed.
   * Trimming of some scenes.
