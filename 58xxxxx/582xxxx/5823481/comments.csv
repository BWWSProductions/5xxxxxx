,dragonzer0,2010-09-12T09:35Z,This is 2009 not 2011. It works good though. Thanks for the up.
,hamazan,2010-09-13T08:00Z,Dragonzer0 - how do you know its 2009 and not 2010?  If you look at the list of slots available in the game it matches 2010 perfectly.  It does load characters from older games and lists their achievements.  The readme in the install folder also says Thanks for purchasing hoyle casino 2009 so not sure what that is about lol.  Far as I can tell its legit when comparing the slot names.

I'm just going by the information you stated and the copywrite is also for 2009.
 If Encore is calling it 2010 when packaged then sobeit. Either way it is not 2011, as 2010 was   just released Sept. 2nd."

Perhaps you should actually look on the Hoyle site..... 2001 in what is realeased. Not 2010 "
