2005 Our Shadows Will Remain    CD  14th Floor 5050467888654 

Pros: The delicate mixture of bumping beats, electronic textures and vocal layering makes almost every song a winner.

Cons: Vocals are occasionally harsh; subject matter is almost uniformly depressing.

The Bottom Line: Arthur Park is frightening in the dark. But these songs are so dang catchy that sometimes I just don't care.


1 In Ohio  0:46 
2 Can't Exist  4:08 
3 Stumble and Pain  4:43 
4 Devil's Broom  4:46 
5 Echo Park  2:51 
6 Even Tho  4:47 
7 Puppets  3:53 
8 Wasted  4:13 
9 Failed  4:22 
10 I Am  4:14 
11 A Smile That Explodes  3:21 
12 Leave Us Alone  3:47 

So, pretty good if unspectacular stuff all the way through after "Can't Exist." That track is worth the purchase alone.
