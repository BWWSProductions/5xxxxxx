Strangely, the volume for both recordings came out considerably lower than usual. I did not change any program settings or adjust volume. I don't know why this happened. I tried normalizing the sound, but it just made recordings sound shittier (background noise, hiss, etc.). Anyway, It's not too bad, just turn up the volume a bit. Peace."
