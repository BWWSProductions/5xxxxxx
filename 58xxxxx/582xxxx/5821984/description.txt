Barack Obama is trying to make John Boehner the face of the Republican oppositionâ€”the day-glo orange face of the opposition. During his speech in Ohio, President Obama repeatedly called out House Minority leader John Boehner by name. The good news for Boehner is that the President didnâ€™t intentionally mispronounce his nameâ€”always a temptation for anyone. Iâ€™m sure John Boehner grew up constantly hearing jokes about his name. Maybe thatâ€™s why he developed his habit of never listening to anything anyone else ever says.

President Obama himself has called on Pastor Terry Jones to call off his Quran burning. Obama said that â€œthis stunt that he is talking about pulling could greatly endanger our young men and women who are in uniform.â€ I donâ€™t know if would use the word â€œstunt.â€ Stunts are for Criss Angel and David Blaine. Nobody would complain if Pastor Terry Jones was freezing himself inside a block of ice. In fact, I would be encouraging him. 

Conservatives keep comparing the Quran burning with the plans to build an Islamic center in downtown Manhattan. Not a valid comparisonâ€¦ thereâ€™s a big difference between burning somebodyâ€™s holy book and building a swimming pool. The Quran burning is an act of provocation. Building the proposed rumpus room is an act of recreation.

Glenn Beck has come out against the burning of the Qurans. I donâ€™t care, I still think itâ€™s a bad idea. Beck posted his objections on his blog. I donâ€™t know if the best place to object to a book burning is on a blog called â€œThe Blaze.â€

Finally, itâ€™s being reported that a big $30 million bio pic glorifying Ronald Reagan is in the works. Greatâ€”yet another Ronald Reagan movie with absolutely no connection to reality. If this movie is going to be true to the spirit of Ronald Reagan, the production will end up having a huge budget deficit. And who are they going to get to play Ronald Reagan? All I know is that Ronald Reagan did a pretty crappy job of it.
