This torrent includes everything you can find in the other torrents here. But the difference is that this one comes with an enormous 2 1/2 gigabyte sample library. The list of instruments sampled is impressive:

Chamberlin M Series
Chamberlin Misc
Chamberlin Music Masters
Chamberlin Rhythmate
Mellotron M300 and Mark II
Mellotron M400 and Mark V
Novatron
Optigan Instruments
Optigan Loops
Orchestron
Powerhouse Loops
Stylophone
Talentmaker Loops
Three Sixty DigitalTron
Tube Tron
Vintage Effects
VP330 Vocoder

Yes, you get the historically important Chamberlin Rhythmate, the loop-based drub machine that was the first model in Harry's Chamberlin line. There are also rhythms for Optigan and Talentmaker, so fans of vintage rhythm tracks will be well-served. There is also a hefty supply of old sound effects (not the same at the M-Tron Pro collection) for musique concrete enthusiasts.

But after that, I'm sorry to report that things get sorely disappointing. Everyone knows that a standard Mellotron has 35 keys. With this software, you can play a lot more keys than that. They have committed the cardinal sin of only sampling a few notes for each instrument and then speeding them up or slowing them down to fill out the range of the keyboard. So not only do you not get a faithful re-creation of all the individual samples, but you get several notes that have been sped up or slowed down and just plain sound weird. These guys should be punched in the face.

That said, the library is not without value. They've rescued some pretty obscure samples here, Rhythmate in particular. And some of the instruments sound nice even if they have been criminally tampered with; depending on your disposition, they could be usable.

Sorry to lay such a bummer on you, but I'm just the messenger.
