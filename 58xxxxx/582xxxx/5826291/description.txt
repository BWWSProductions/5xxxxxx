This is a LCD repair manual for when not not just the caps that have a faulty

something . Used with a service manual, say from http://elektrotanya.com/?q=keres

Can help you repair your LCD, though you will need to a voltage meter from ebay for

$4.  

Ebay repair kits can be successful and just need you to do some soldering to overcome common faults without diagnosis.  

Help you on your way to repairing electronics , a useful, life time skill , used once every 3 or 4 years!
