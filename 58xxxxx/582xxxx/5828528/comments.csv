,lallyladie,2010-09-14T13:45Z,"I think you are possibly the greatest person to walk the planet! 

I have lived in Korea for 5 years and the only thing I miss about the UK is Eastenders. Thanks to you, I can watch it! 

Thank you so, so, so, so, so much for your great quality videos with speedy uploading! 

I really do appreciate it!
