Based on the famous novella from  Robert  Louis  Stevenson      
the player experience the fascinating world  of  Jekyll  &      
Hyde  and  must  solve   the   secrets   behind   London's     
underground   world.   Fascinating   storyline   about   a      
conspiracy of an ancient mysterious  sect.  Therefore  all      
puzzles (quests) are based on the Greek mythology.              

Combining classical Point and Click features  with  action      
elements, Jekyll and Hyde is featuring a 3D engine with  a      
lot of special effects. Players must solve the quests with      
two completely different characters.                          "
