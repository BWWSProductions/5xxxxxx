This Is The x64 (64 Bit) Version Of Windows Vista Home Premium SP2. Are You Sure You Havn't Gotten Them Mixed Up?"
,dublea2,2010-10-19T20:07Z,"@Computer-User

I'm positive.  When I installed this and brought up the system property window, it states it's 32bit.  This was the first one I attempted and found that it was always installing an x86 version.  I had to go download one from another torrent site to find one that was actually x64.  I had a PC that needed a new HDD and Sony only made drivers for x64.

And this instructions are a joke:  
Burn The .ISO File With Nero Burning Rom, Magic ISO, Power ISO.



Place The DVD Into Your Computer & Restart The Computer.



Boot From DVD, After You Have Booted From The DVD.



Always Do A Clean Install By Formatting The Current Installed Operating System.



After The Windows Installation Is Finished.



Use The ""Windows Activation"" You Can Burn It To A Sep CD Or Dvd.

Makes no sense grammatically.   I attempted with out a key and deselecting avtivate online and attempted with a key.  Either way, it was always x86."

could i use my own CD key if i wished for, or is that simply not needed?
i ask because i need a clean install of vista and i already have a CD key, but if this version is tweaked not to need one, that is good too. as long as i get the updates i want in the end.

thank you."

Hi, I am attempting to repair a Vista Home Pre x64 SP2 PC, but when using this image, and booting it from within Vista, I'm not given the option to Upgrade.  Apparently you need to have a Full Retail or Upgrade version of Vista, which you say this is.  Is there something I'm missing that you would know?
Appreciated any insight you might have.
Brgds,
John Not.

  Here is the link for repairing install using upgrade.

No All Of My Operating Systems Are Full Retail & Untouched, There Is No Way Too Do A Upgrade Type Windows Installation By Doing The Installation By Restarting The Computer, You Can Only Format (Clean Install) By Restarting The Computer.

The Only Way Too Do A Upgrade Type Installation Is Too Do The Windows Installation From With In-Side Windows. :)"

This is 100% clean and untouched windows vista home premium 64 bit, and is bootable, this is the best way to make the bootable dvd,
1) download and install poweriso, and use this serial key 
Name: TEAM EXPLOSiON
Serial: GLZYY-983YI-IE5U8-EWFKX-3IQYZ

then when windows vista has finished downloading, just double click the iso file in the vista download folder, and then burn to a blank dvd at the slowest speed ( dont do it at a fast speed cos you'll end up getting registry errors ) when its finished burning to the dvd, all done, thanks goes to Computer-User"

You just install the SP2 and boom Vista home premium Service pack 2. lol why would you try to make a bootable disk of a sevice pack. this is not the operating system disc. This is the required update for those that already have the operating system on their computer. Just download this torrent, open install. If you screw up and need to redue your operating system partition, just redown load this or burn it to disc so you have it.
