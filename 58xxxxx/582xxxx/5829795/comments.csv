,burgledikon,2011-01-10T22:33Z,top quality. thanks!
,JackTheForest,2011-01-17T23:36Z,"If this is real or close to 720p (better quality than BONEs, like GoodFilms said) what is BONEs upload quality, DVD quality? I got BONEs by 48% and still cannot test the videos, except for the B&W beginng...

Offcourse im really thankfull for all the great uploads and everything is better than nothing, but its really bad that so many people use 720p, 1080p and HD even when its only a bad copy from a blu-ray.

Same like with the ""HD"" youtube movie trailers in 380p...

Explanation for the Women: Somebody makes a picture of a pretty Gucci dress, prints it out on paper, stiches it together and gives it away for free."
,rakz2cul,2011-01-26T02:19Z,thanks for sharing...
,DutchDK,2011-02-05T05:19Z,"Seed please. Getting downloads of 30 Kb/s overall, with individual peers at 1-2 Kb/s.
Please disable the upload throtling in Bittorret/uTorrent, if it is enabled. (options - preferences - Queueing - remove checkmark in the ""When Bittorent/uTorrent Reaches the seeding goal"")

Thank you"
,turnstile,2011-02-24T19:45Z,"What's the difference between this and the ""The Pacific (2010) Complete 720p MKV"" torrent? (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5570668/The_Pacific_%282010%29_Complete_720p_MKV#filelistContainer)

This one says Blu-Ray and is twice as big, but both say 720p x264.
I'm just trying to decide if the extra 15GB is worth it."
,VerySmellyballz,2011-04-02T07:05Z,C mon people....you get shit for free and you dont even help others to get it for free also. Stop hit and running and SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!!!!
,bluehulk,2011-06-09T09:26Z,"EY YO wtf?
I dont have any intro's with the old veterans in your episodes. I love the intro when they talk about what they did in the war and you left those crucials out of the torrent? why if i may ask?"
,bluehulk,2011-06-09T09:33Z,Why are you deleting my question? Why did you leave out the intro with the old veterans?
,chemicar,2011-06-28T02:55Z,i have no audio.. can someone please help??
,relevant-stuff,2011-08-11T05:29Z,I'm DL now and will seed for 8x the size at 3MB/s
,h4ckerman,2011-10-28T12:12Z,Great torrent thank u GoodFilms :D
,ericu65,2011-11-17T15:28Z,"@bluehulk is correct. The 3-5 minute history/interview intro is missing in this one (and available in the other one). But quality is better in this one. I for one am downloading both and watching the intro from one, and the rest from this one."
