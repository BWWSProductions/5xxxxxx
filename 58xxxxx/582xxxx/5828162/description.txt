I'm doing a little research so i'm curious about what downloaders use to watch their movies on. If a comment is left, I would like a short description of your entertainment set-up.....for example.....I use an Apple TV connected to a 55" Samsung LED with a Samsung Receiver connecting my surround sound. Basically, a short description on what you primarily use to play my rips.......Thx!
