I use a Dvico 6600 media player, 55"" LED Samsung TV and Onkyo receiver (HD audio)
One thing I'd like to see less of is AAC audio and more AC3/DTS
Not many things can output 5.1 in AAC"

I agree totally....alot of encoders use 6 channel ACC which is not true Dolby Digital 5.1. Its the equivalent of Pro Logic II but its not Dolby Digital. Most receivers can't identify it so it outputs it as a Pro Logic II track with sound going to all 6 channels. U can def tell the difference between 6 channel and DD 5.1......I would like to go with DTS but not enuff Media Players support it."
