Compared to the DVD version and also for a HDTV rip, the video is excellent.  I presume the audio was sourced from the DVD.

Anyways, the reason I'm writing this comment (other than to thank you) is that my one con about this release is that it's 25fps (the european standard).  Of course that's not your fault and the release still looks and sounds great.  But I like to convert all my HD films which I find are 25fps back to their original intended frame rate of 24fps and I was able to do so perfectly with this release as well (although it wasn't easy compared to others I've done in the past).

If anyone would like a tutorial on how to do this, let me know and I'll write one up here."
