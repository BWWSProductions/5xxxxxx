The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn\'s Quest is an upcoming third-person, action adventure video game developed by Headstrong Games for Wii and TT Fusion for Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. It is the first The Lord of the Rings game to be released by Warner Bros. Interactive, who obtained the lease following Electronic Arts\'s titles.

The existence of Aragorn\'s Quest was initially leaked by the Entertainment Software Association in their E3 list of debuting titles.[8] The game was officially announced in a press release a week later, on May 28, 2009, and marks the first title in a new franchise after Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment obtained the license for the Lord of the Rings series from The Saul Zaentz Company and New Line Cinema after years of the series being licensed to Electronic Arts. The press release noted the game would be available for Wii, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2 and PSP sometime in Q3/Q4 2009.[9] In August 2009, the publishers announced the game would be delayed until Q1/Q2 2010.[10] No reason was given for the delay. On March 10, 2010, the publisher announced the game would also be available for the PlayStation 3 and support the PlayStation Move, a peripheral set to launch in Q3/Q4 2010. With this announcement also came a further delay, pushing the release date back to Q3/Q4 2010 for all platforms. Kotaku speculates that the additional support for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Move was the cause for the delays.[1] The game is scheduled for a September 2010 release.
