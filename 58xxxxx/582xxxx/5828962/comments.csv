Enjoy"
,diziguy69,2010-09-20T02:15Z,This is BY FAR the stupidest compression method I have ever seen in many years of downloading.
,Green-Banana,2010-09-20T11:55Z,"Why trust something hidden in a compressed file, people?  

Besides I have not yet seen one mention as to whether this is a PROPER crack or not--i.e. does it actually break the scheme where Trillian FORCES itself to be upgraded to a noncracked version after a while?  "
,mustaphanaru,2010-09-21T15:59Z,if you don't trust so don't download :)
,Wisper83,2010-11-08T16:10Z,is it just me or the last compression is missing a file ? = unable to decompress the .exe ?
