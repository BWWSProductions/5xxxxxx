Any more hit-and-runs and im gonna stop wasting my bandwidth on it."
,questar,2010-10-04T22:06Z,Thank you for this. There's no way anyone can recover the ratio hit after downloading this from TheBox. I'll keep seeding after it's downloaded.

,KrazyKanuck,2010-11-26T17:31Z,Thank you!
,KrazyKanuck,2010-11-26T17:32Z,PLEASE SEED FOLKS

Peace,

Happy Holidays!"

,godswallops,2011-06-07T04:04Z,"Thanks for this... I'm still seeding (at 50% so far).

Great quality, except for S01E05 - His and Hers. This file is only 53.8mb and only runs for about 6 minutes.  It has been truncated.

What I have done, is grab S01E04 - His and Hers from this torrent: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5528875/Are_You_Being_Served_Series_01#filelistContainer  (the episode numbering is different).

There are only a few seeders of this torrent, including me, and I only have this episode. It is about 40mb larger at 321mb, but is about the same quality.  This makes the collection complete.

Thanks again."
,Jona198102,2011-08-19T21:06Z,"The Pilot episode is bad, in addition to ""His and Hers"". I've uploaded a torrent with the correct files as well as the 2010 color version of the Pilot here:

,meirleach,2011-10-12T10:53Z,"Excellent! Thanks to purplebic for the initial torrent, and to Jona198102 for the corrected Pilot and S01E05!

I got introduced to the series by my ex-wife, and I still love it. I'd never been able to watch all the episodes until now. I'll be seeding it as much as I can."
,ilmp,2011-10-24T21:29Z,"seeding for awhile, a lot leachers i think though folks"
,fookju,2012-05-09T18:18Z,thx
