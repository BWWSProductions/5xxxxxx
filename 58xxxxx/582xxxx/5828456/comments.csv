[V],big_dad_e,2010-09-14T03:06Z,Ha ha!  This should be a good one.  Thanks neonrainbow!  I hope all these leechers turn into seeders!
,TheChosen1_,2010-11-09T20:20Z,Wtf is 680p?This is 720p not 680p or else...Into the video information you can see it clearly...It is 1280*680 --- so 720p right?( As i know 1280*x always 720p and 1920*x is 1080p)

I'd recommend everyone see it."
