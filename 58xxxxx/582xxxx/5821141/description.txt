       A man with a remarkable talent for violence must fight to survive when
       he sets out on a remarkable journey in this fantasy from director
       Nicolas Winding Refn. One-Eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is the nickname given
       to a nameless, mute warrior who has become a slave to
       Barde (Alexander Morton), a wealthy Scotsman who obtained One Eye
       for his remarkable fighting skills. One Eye is a fierce warrior but shows little
       loyalty to his master, and when the opportunity presents itself, One Eye
       murders Barde and his mercenaries and sets off on his own, with 
       a young boy (Maarten Stevenson) tagging along to speak on his
       behalf. Eager to leave Denmark behind in favour of freedom and adventure,
       One Eye throws in his lot with a band of Christian Vikings, who've set 
       out on an ambitious quest to travel to Jerusalem and claim the 
       Holy Land as their own. But the voyage to the Holy City is a difficult one,
       and the Vikings are met with violent resistance, forcing One Eye
       to rely on his talents as a warrior to protect himself and his young apprentice.

       PROPER Notes:

       Other rls from KAFFEREP got nuked for having bad framerate (19.1808)
       It also have a spectaculary low bitrate around 317kbs..
