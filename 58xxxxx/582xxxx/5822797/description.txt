Maroon 5 have released two multi-platinum studio albums (2002â€™s Songs About Jane and 2007â€™s It Wonâ€™t Be Soon Before Long), scored a string of hit singles (â€œThis Love,â€ â€œShe Will Be Loved,â€ â€œHarder to Breathe,â€ â€œSunday Morning,â€ â€œMakes Me Wonderâ€), won three Grammy Awards, and sold 15 million albums around the world. Now the Los Angeles quintet is back with its third-studio album, entitled Hands All Over â€” a killer hybrid of rock, pop, funk, and R&B, that showcases the bandâ€™s considerable strengths: buoyant, unforgettable melodies, sleek, stylish grooves, charged lyrics about turbulent relationships, and crisp, dynamic performances.
