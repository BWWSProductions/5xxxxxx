Review from Highly Evolved

\"I donâ€™t often review metal albums. Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t listen to metal, in fact I am often searching
for new metal bands, but there in lies the problem. As a listener of music, I do like to listen to bands
that are different to the norm, and at the moment metal music seems to be in a rut (with only a few
exceptions).

Blatherskite is one of these exceptions, they are very close in sound to Tool, but with less math-rock
elements and more grooves.â€Where the Wasteland Endsâ€ is the bandâ€™s fourth studio album and has been
lauded by many, for good reason.

"Where The Wasteland Ends" - Blatherskite

Blatherskite are a five piece made up of two guitars, bass, drums and vocals. The two musicians that
standout are Nick Goryl (Vocals) and Brendan Davie (Drums), I always say that a band has to have
something that puts them above other bands, in this case itâ€™s the bands chemistry and musical ability.
Just listening to the recording, you can tell that this band is tight, Davie seems to keep pace on drums
and this really rubs of onto the rest of the band. I also canâ€™t fail to mention the singerâ€™s hauntingly
similar voice to Maynard James Keenan, itâ€™s quite impressive. His voice is one of the highlights of the
band and it really stands out on the album, especially on the opening track, â€˜Majesticâ€™.

The production is impressive and especially on an album that has had minimal backing in term of funds.
A lot of smaller bands fall over with the production and in my experience it does have a very large
detrimental effect if the production is not up to standard, but in the case of â€œWhere The Wasteland Endsâ€
this is not an issue.

There is only one disappointing aspect of the album though, in the end there is a lack of a standout song
that really imprints itself into your memory and I think most top-class albums have a song that achieves
that. Because of this, the album a piece of music that has to be listened to in full.

As an album itâ€™s bordering on a top-class album, but it lacks that little bit that would make it into a
great album. In saying that though, I canâ€™t remember an Australian metal album that betters â€œWhere The
Wasteland Endsâ€. Sure, Karnivoolâ€™s â€œThemataâ€ and Cogâ€™s â€œThe New Normalâ€ are amazing albums, but they both
stray from metal and delve into prog-rock, causing me to usually lump them into the rock genre, unlike the
two bands mentioned, Blatherskite sounds like a metal band.

Overall, why would you listen to this band? Well, the answer to that is simple. They are a band that has
incredible chemistry and have made an album that stands up to most metal albums made in the last decade.
The fact that they are a part of the Australian music scene, should evoke pride because I think one of the
negatives of the Australian music scene is the lack of quality metal bands.

Support this band, they should be a well known Australian act, but for one reason or another they arenâ€™t.
Get onto them.
