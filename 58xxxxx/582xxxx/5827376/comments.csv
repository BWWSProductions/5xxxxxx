@All New Guys
Please keep the torrents on, do not remove them after you are finished with download. Keep Ratio above 1:1. And dont worry your ISP donot charge you for the uploads. So help Others. sharing is Caring. God Bless "

[V],twentyforty,2010-09-14T08:37Z,"It has been cut-out from this torrent-description (which usually accompanies at least one of my torrents per day) and it may help 'cause some tips about playback have been given.

And - I don't deal with similar questions on individual basis. I never download a thing I know nothing about. Anything (literary) is on TPB in like zillion different incarnations.

So - you can read such full torrent description at last TV torrent today:
