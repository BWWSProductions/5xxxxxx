 Marmalade    
22 Falling Apart at the Seams
 
46 songs on 2 CD's, released between 1964 and 1976 - all original versions! - by The Marmalade's predecessors Dean Ford & The Gaylords (4), of course The Marmalade themselves (40) and their founder member and main songwriter Junior Campbell (2). 

The Marmalade were good. And various of their songs should be admired as classics of pop history ("It's All Leading Up to Saturday Night", "Wait for Me Mary-Anne", "Mr. Lion", "Baby Make It Soon", "Butterfly", "Rainbow", "The Ballad of Cherry Flavor", "I'll Be Home (in a Day or So)", "Kaleidoscope", "Dear John", "My Little One", "Sarah", "Lady of Catrine", "Empty Bottles", "She Wrote Me a Letter", "Just One Woman"). 

But the only ones they seem to be really remembered for are their version of the Beatles' awful bubblegum schlager "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da" (12/68), their own immortal "Reflections of My Life" (11/69) and maybe their mediocre, but catchy "Cousin Norman" (8/71) and "Radancer" (3/72) plus their very last hit "Falling Apart at the Seams" (2/76).
