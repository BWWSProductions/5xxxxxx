After time off due to the international week, the Championship swings
 back into action. Coventry and Leicester meet in the M69 derby, while
 there is another local affair to be resolved in Lancashire when Burnley
 welcome Preston North End. Just 25 miles separate the two clubs, and
 Burnley will look for an instant return to the Premier League; as for PNE,
 a nervy start to the season would be quickly forgotten if they could put 
one over their local rivals.
