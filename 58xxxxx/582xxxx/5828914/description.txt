PrisM NOTES:
Well.....:hmmm: Where do i start on this, made an avs script from the mpeg file, which had to crop the black borders, upscale the image to what i thought was big enough and looked ok...then loaded the file into virtualdub, used a brightness filter, slight contrast filter to try and get the scenes watchable, as it was very dark :-/, Once i done that i used a couple different color filters to try and do something with the colors, they were a bit funky, so i worked on the white to try and get it white and go from their...that seemed to work, i used another brightness filter which i rarely use because it causes conflict with others, but used it on a low setting, it seemed to fix the dark scenes a little, also used a smoother filter on a low setting a denoise filter, and sharpness. After all that it looks pretty good...and watchable for most. Audio just used the one on imagines rls as they filtered it, and rest of are guys are sleeping...Lazy feckers. Anyway, ive included a sample from about 15minutes in to see quality, not from the end of the movie like most. Enjoy movie....seems to be a good one.
