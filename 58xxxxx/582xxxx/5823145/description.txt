Summary:
Birth of a legend. Following King Richard's death in France, archer Robin Longstride,
along with Will Scarlett, Alan-a-Dale and Little John, returns to England. They
encounter the dying Robert of Locksley, whose party was ambushed by treacherous
Godfrey, who hopes to facilitate a French invasion of England. Robin promises
the dying knight he will return his sword to his father Walter in Nottingham.
Here Walter encourages him to impersonate the dead man to prevent his land
being confiscated by the crown, and he finds himself with Marian, a ready-made
wife. Hoping to stir baronial opposition to weak King John and allow an easy
French take-over, Godfrey worms his way into the king's service as Earl Marshal
of England and brutally invades towns under the pretext of collecting Royal taxes.
Can Robin navigate the politics of barons, royals, traitors, and the French?
