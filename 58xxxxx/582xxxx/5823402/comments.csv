Have you ended uploading Match Of The Day torrents? This season, when you're not doing the rips, it's a pain to find properly seeded ones and usually the quality is worse, than it has been with you :)

So if you're thinking about wether you should or should not start to upload MOTD's again, you have my vote! :)"
