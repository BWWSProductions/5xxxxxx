2010 for 180 days.
After that period Office needs re-activation, which you can do by simply executing the activator again.
Also, at the end of the activation process the Activator gives you the option to program a scheduled reactivation....

I've run the Activator through Avast
! Pro - came out as clean. Some AVs will report this as a hacking tool, though - because that's what it is...used it on Office 2010 Professional Plus in Win7 64-bit and worked fine.
