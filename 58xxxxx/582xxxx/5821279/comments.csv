Excuse my ignorance, however I have just come across .flac files and obviously still do not understand them. if .Flac files are compressed audio files, then why are these files 20 - 30 MB when a normal single song is maybe 5 - 10 MB? I don't mean to insult, but just need some advise."
,Zarkow,2011-01-03T18:52Z,"Most people might play this great FLAC release on the computer, but if you want to put it on your cell phone etc you might have to convert it to a MP3.

If you wanna try a Beta of a free tool called zAudioConverter, that does this. http://www.digitalsoftware.se/forum/viewtopic.php?t=289&tag=zaudioconverter_beta_released_

Info to poster above me: FLAC is an lossless format, meaning the sound is digitally undestroyed, in perfect shape. One could say that the format is more like zip or rar, in the sense that it compresses the file in terms of disc-space but it will uncompress it during playing. mp3 and some other formats however reduce the sound-space a bit and does several compressions (simplifications) of the audio, hence the reduction of size.

When it comes to classical music lossless is much better since that is a typical style of music that normally uses a wider range in sound-space."
,Robertissimo,2011-01-15T15:54Z,"Great effort but this collection contains American rock mainly and - to be honest - more than half of the performers and songs are totaly unknown to me (I consider myself as an average European listener). In the 90s I was in my late 20s so I think I know the 90s music very well. On the other hand, most of the (European) greatest hits of the 90s are not included here."
,seattlebt,2011-05-10T00:12Z,I'm not convinced these files are lossless.  They sure don't sound like it.  I've compared a few files to songs I already have.  Beware.
,saltiva,2011-05-18T19:22Z,"more seeder please,,
only 10 kBps is bad"
,gianfrancobrionesdy,2011-05-27T04:18Z,wow. this makes me crazy COZ IT'S IN FLAC YALL.
,GOBSERVER,2011-07-28T21:17Z,Thank you very much. Great work
,Indomidable,2011-08-13T19:17Z,"@shannonm  If you've not bothered to check out what FLAC Means (Using Favorite Search Engine)... It's A Lossless Compression (so it means that it's compressed but to the limit of 0 loss in sound.) Thus it's = to CD Audio with out taking all of the space. I usually use FLAC 8 myself (the number is how tight it'll go) All levels = Lossless but higher the number the smaller the file 6 is 99% compression 8 goes the extra mile to save space at the compromise of speed.  Regardless, the music quality is lossless.
I've got a 6 Core AMD and a 4 Core I72600 (8 Threads/Cores) So running at FLAC 8 isn't a problem. Slower systems may have to compromise."

-.-"
,muumtaz1,2012-02-28T15:01Z,the download speed is frustrating. is it because I choose not to download all the songs but only half of them instead? expert advice needed. thanks
,muumtaz1,2012-03-04T03:22Z,"stuck at 95.5%, please...please seed anyone."
,JailorSerry,2012-04-14T05:37Z,Slow download speed... please seed! I've uploaded far more than I downloaded.
,bhanul,2012-05-20T06:42Z,"You are a legend mate, awesome series on decades in excellent quality.
