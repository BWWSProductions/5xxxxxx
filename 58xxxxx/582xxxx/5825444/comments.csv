This 8 episode pack is not the complete Season 1, but is all episodes aired so far. Episodes 9 and 10 will be released after they show on Discovery Channel and once episode 10 is shown and shared here, I will also recreate the Season 1 torrent with the final 2 episodes of this season added to make a Season 1 Complete pack.

A second note, anyone who has already downloaded these episodes from my torrents can simply put them into a folder called ""Man, Woman, Wild (Season 1)"" and then have your torrent client download to the folder that ""Man, Woman, Wild (Season 1)"" folder you created is in, and any episodes you have not gotten will download from this torrent. This can also be doen to allow you to seed this torrent without downloading these same files again, which you've already downloaded individually before. The same will be true when the final Season 1 Complete pack torrent is later uploaded."
