A TERRIFYING DVD of a car and a motorcycle racing along country roads at 186mph

Plot

A high powered Suzuki GSXR emerges from the urban decay of a run down
English suburb, tailed closely by a Mitsubishi Evo. The setting is not
a pre-made set like the Ghost Rider videos...It's real roads, no
special effects and never speeded up!

Watch as the team rides and drives at speeds reaching 186mph, gets
chased by the police, burns a speed camera, wheelie's through fire
walls, do burn outs, stand up wheelie's, tank wheelie's, then offer
Ghost Rider a race and much more...You will be riveted to this hi
octaine adrenaline filled DVD masterpiece from start to finish.
