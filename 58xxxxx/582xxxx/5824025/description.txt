"Dance with My Father" is the title track from the 2003 Luther Vandross album Dance with My Father. It was written by Vandross and Richard Marx. The song reached number 38 on the Billboard Hot 100 on September 16, 2003, becoming Vandross' final Top 40 hit.

In February 2004, Vandross and Marx won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for "Dance with My Father".

"Dance With My Father" was the last top 40 hit for the late Luther Vandross in his homeland, U.S., peaking at 38. The song also peaked at 21 in the UK. As of Saturday 29 August 2009 the song re-entered the top 40 after a performance of the song on the British hit TV show X Factor by Joe McElderry. The song entered the UK Singles Chart on the 20th December 2009 at number 48, just outside the Top 40.

The song comes from the good times Vandross shared with his late father, Luther Vandross, Sr., when he was a child and they would dance with each other.

Dance with My Father is the 13th studio album by American R&B-soul singer-songwriter Luther Vandross. It was released in the United States on June 10, 2003 by J Records, his final album to be released before his death on July 1, 2005. The album, especially its title track, was dedicated to Vandross' late father.

The album earned Vandross two American Music Awards in 2003â€”Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist and Favorite Soul/R&B Albumâ€”and four Grammy Awards in 2004â€”Song of the Year and Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for "Dance with My Father" (also nominated for Best R&B Song), Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for "The Closer I Get to You" (with BeyoncÃ©), and Best R&B Album.

Dance with My Father debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart, moving some 442,000 units in its opening week alone, and also topped the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, after debuting at #42 the previous week.

It was Vandross' first and only album to top the 'Pop' albums chart. It was his eighth time at #1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. Dance With My Father also stands as the biggest selling studio album of Luther's entire career with over 2.9 million sales in the United States alone. The title track single was a hit on Pop, R&B, and Adult Contemporary radio. It received the 2004 Grammy Award for Song of the Year, which Luther shared with his father.
