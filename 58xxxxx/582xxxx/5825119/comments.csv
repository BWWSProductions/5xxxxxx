Thanks for letting ppl know that the tracks aren't seperated, I found a torrent whose tracks are seperated here:

,DoaKao,2010-11-28T09:47Z,repeating what the previous commenter said - thanks for letting us know that the tracks aren't split
,frizoky,2012-03-12T08:13Z,its not split and its definitely not 320kbps
