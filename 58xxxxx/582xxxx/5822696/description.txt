\'Crook\' is based on the the injustice done to the indians in Australia and will have four australian actors and one among them will be the South heroine - Neha Sharma.

Suri further adds that the shoot for the film will be start near by february 2010 and the reason is not the transparency with those attacks on indians in Australia. Instead as a whole it is based upon the racial discrimination theme. The compatible language in it hybrid type.

Neha Sharma has done few movies but those were regional ones and among them the famous one is with Chiranjeevi\'s son Ram Charan Teja in \"Chirutha\". Her acting is appreciable but let us see what she can create difference in \"Crook\".

Neha Sharma, the south Indian actor will debut in the hindi film on Mohit Suri\'s Movie \"Crook: It\'s Good to be Bad\" and the astonishing fact in the movie is that his co-star Emraan Hasmi known as the serial kisser will not share any smooches with Neha, instead that will be with an australian star.
