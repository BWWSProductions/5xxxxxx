"The Very Short Introductions series (or VSI series) is a book series published by the Oxford University Press publishing house since 1995. Each book in the series offers a concise yet cogent introduction to a particular subject. Written by acknowledged experts, most books are between 100â€“150 pages and contain suggestions for further reading. Authors often present personal viewpoints, but each introduction is intended to be balanced and complete." (Wikipedia)

This is a collection of 158 books from the series that currently numbers 245 titles. The file Missing.txt contains a list of the subjects that have been covered to date but which I have been unable to get a hold of. If you find one of the missing books (or are in possession of an original and willing to share), I would be very glad to know!
