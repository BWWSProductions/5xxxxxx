,dlarrym1111,2010-09-14T06:45Z,"MAD KUDOS!!! I wasn't sure if anyone was going to upload the continuing Venture Bros. saga. Yes it is Insane but very entertaining. The style is also unique in that it is animated in the tradition of older styles of animation when ALL cartoons were NON computer assisted animation. The throwbacks to Johnny Quest with RACE BANNON making ""cameo"" appearances, as does an adult, drug addicted Johnny Quest!! If you do not know these older throwbacks it may not be as entertaining. They even had an episode playing off a popular action show of the 70's called ""The Six Million Dollar"" and not just references to the show itself, but specific episodes, Like the episode where BROOK found Steve Austin hiding out in a national park with Bigfoot. (in the series, The Six million Dollar man, they actually had an episode in which Steve Austin encounters big-foot and discovers he too is some kind of intelligent android put on earth by extraterrestrials !! I am not kidding. This show came on around the same time that Fantasy Island was on and DALLAS (Who Shot J.R.) Three is Company, etc. Man(I have EVERY episode including the pilot episode of the original 1960's Era classic prime time cartoon. Great upload, keep 'm' coming.!! many sincere thanks. If I had a TIVO, I'd be uploading these as well.

P.S. - 

Just out of Curiosity, the SQUIDBILLIES is preparing for more episodes/seasons also. PLEASE upload these as they are about to begin being aired very soon."
