Despite  the cash-in title, Pulp Fusion is an intriguing compilation of mostly obscure jazz tracks that have been sampled by hip-hop and dance musicians over the years. Besides the delight inherent in spotting the sample, the songs work excellently by themselves, including Herbie Hancock's "Hang Up Your Hang Ups," Reuben Wilson's version of "Inner City Blues," Lonnie Smith on "Afrodesia" and the Pointer Sisters' "Don't It Drive You Crazy."
