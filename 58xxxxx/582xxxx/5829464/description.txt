Luther Vandross And Gregory Hines - There's Nothing Better Than Love (2nafish)


"There's Nothing Better Than Love" is a 1987 vocal duet by Luther Vandross with Gregory Hines. The single went to number one on the Hot Black Singles Chart, for one week, and peaked at number fifty on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. "There's Nothing Better Than Love" was Luther Vandross' follow up to his previous number one soul hit, "Stop To Love."

Give Me the Reason is the fifth studio album by American R&B/soul singer Luther Vandross, released on September 19, 1986. The album earned Vandross an American Music Award for "Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist" and a nomination for "Favorite Soul/R&B Album" in 1988, while the title track "Give Me the Reason" was nominated for "Best R&B Vocal Performance, Male" and "Best R&B Song" in 1987.

Vandross released a series of successful albums during the 1980s and continued his session work with guest vocals on groups like Charme in 1982. Although the albums were successful overall, many of his earlier albums made a much bigger impact on the R&B charts than on the pop charts. During the 1980s, Vandross had two singles that reached #1 on the Billboard R&B charts: "Stop to Love", in 1986, and a duet with Gregory Hinesâ€”"There's Nothing Better Than Love." Vandross was at the helm as producer for Aretha Franklin's Gold-certified, award-winning comeback album Jump to It. He also produced the disappointing follow-up album, 1983's Get It Right. In 1983, the opportunity to work with his main music influence, Dionne Warwick, came about with Vandross producing, writing songs, and singing on How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye, her fourth album for Arista Records. The title track duet reached #27 on the Hot 100 chart (#7 R&B/#4 Adult Contemporary), while the second single, "Got a Date" was only a moderate hit (#45 R&B/#15 Club Play).

In 1985, Luther Vandross first spotted the talent of Jimmy Salvemini, 15 at the time, on "Star Search." He thought Salvemini had the perfect voice for some of his songs. He contacted Salvemini, who was managed by his brother Larry. A contract was negotiated with Elektra records for $250,000 and Luther agreed to produce the album. Luther even contacted old friends to appear on the album, Cheryl Lynn, Alfa Anderson (Chic), Phoebe Snow and Irene Cara. After the album was completed, Luther, Jimmy, and Larry decided to celebrate. On January 12, 1986, they were riding in Luther's convertible Mercedes when it crossed the yellow lines of the two lane street and smashed into two vehicles. All three men were rushed to the hospital. Larry Salvemini died during surgery, and Vandross and Jimmy Salvemini survived. At first, the Salvemini family was supportive of Luther. In 1986, Luther faced vehicular manslaughter charges as a result of Larry's death. Vandross pled no contest to reckless driving, and the Salvemini family filed a wrongful death suit. The case was quietly settled out of court for $700,000. The Album called "Roll With It" was released later that year.
