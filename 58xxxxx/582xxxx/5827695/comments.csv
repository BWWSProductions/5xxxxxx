,vespadelus,2010-09-13T14:56Z,It somehow isn't picking up any seeders although I am seeding and all seems fine ?!? Just go for it....
,zardoz78,2010-11-05T22:04Z,"Thanks, but please you should keep the release name in the file name, for each episode.  This will make finding matching subtitles much harder..."
,vespadelus,2010-11-12T13:12Z,All file names contain episode number and their release name as listed on IMDB. So I am not sure what your problem is....
,vespadelus,2010-11-15T13:07Z,"...ah, it dawned on me. You mean the original release title as posted like Legend.of.the.Seeker.S02E02.HDTV.XviD-2HD.avi etc....

....will keep in mind for the next time ;-)"

,ust2,2011-07-01T13:21Z," Wow the show only went 2 seasons? Just read up on it some earlier after finishing Game of Thrones, and I guess this has been canceled. 

 Which doesn't make sense, it was pretty good from what I did see of it already.

 I skipped watching it on TV after awhile since it seemed like something better watched together instead of broken apart by weeks, really thought there would have been a lot more catching up to do than this.

 But it seems my waiting was no better served, seeing as it will never come to an end.. now i'm just sad :(

 Ty for the upload, and especially to everyone else for still seeding this one (all the individual files are dead)."
