Here is a collection of photos and video released under the FOIA back in March. These are important historical records of the tragic events that unfolded in New York 9/11/2001 and of great interest to any 9/11 researcher.

In a few days The International Center for 9/11 Studies will start releasing hundreds of hours of video footage and tens of thousands of photographs (3TB!!) obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, in response to a lawsuit the Center filed against NIST. The files will be distributed by bittorrent and the relevant .torrent files will be available from http://911datasets.org.
