,YiNG_YaNG_6o4,2010-09-13T01:04Z,"you're telling hakuna to keep his comments to himself?? hahaha!!!  you always bitch and complain about the free stuff you get and you wanna tell other ppl to keep comments to themselves??  try taking your own advice before you tell other ppl what to do.

and do not argue with me.  because you obviously do not understand english and obviously didn't understand what i wrote.  it also gives me a headache reading your poor grammar.  don't try and talk big with your refugee language. ""did i asked you anything"" ""its none of your matter"" ...  maybe funny language i speak you at will understand better me.  little education brain has you to talk so stutter you will re-re-retar-tard.

you don't have to ask me anything.  your name is feces.  so i must talk shit about you.  its freedom of speech =)"
,hakuna_matata,2010-09-13T14:58Z,"@Fetal19
You made me laugh my boy. Dont use this type of languge boy on our The Pirate Bay is scared Place.You are one hell of a newbie on torrent filed. You just come here on TPB and expect to get everything. I have been around for years and yes I am on demonoid as well, I was about to give you a invite and was asking for ur email id but you have ruined it. You donâ€™t know English you idiot, and definitely donâ€™t understand the street slang language very well. I said in a polite manner not in aggressive way that you talk. This is bcoz English is not ur first language. I said be polite man and that will help you understand. People come on torrents to share.. "
,hakuna_matata,2010-09-13T14:58Z,"Sharing is Caring.  Earlier Darmeth used to upload but some how some newbie pissed him off he stopped uploading in a middle of a season. If you can try to get in on their forum. 

Slang language can be used in a good way or a bad way.. it is you to decide where you draw the line. That move of Schumacher on Barrichello on pit wall was ok.. no it wasnâ€™t. So you need to know the line when you talk bad from your mouth. Be polite boy and you will grow. you donâ€™t know but you have been downloading some of my work as well. And Yes its not one guy itâ€™s a team who uploads the torrents.

@YiNG_YaNG_6o4
He is newbie on torrent filed. Thanks for the support though. and I still need the name dear, I know darmeth people dont allow inside, i am on demonoid that not it, it has to be a private tracker or may be box or hmm let me see. I will ask you on demonoid. Have a good day bro. Takcare."
,Lm602,2010-09-13T20:24Z,Can u post practices too? I enjoy watching them too. It gets you familiar with the track and builds somewhat of an idea who is going to do well among the drivers. thanks.
,hakuna_matata,2010-09-15T01:11Z,"No its not possible for tdmk1 to upload practice session he has told us manytimes before, i just hope someone start doing that for us. hope that helps. "
