I would love a torrent of the CBT Nuggets Windows 70-685 videos. Thanks again."

The annoying presenter talks at an absurdly fast rate, skips vast sections of pertinent matter, omits doing any useful examples and blathers away on pointless side-issues that have nothing to do with the curriculum. Download just one and try it first before you waste your bandwidth allocation on the whole set."
,a33e,2011-05-18T00:03Z,"James Conrad is BEST presenter i have ever heard!
I hope that they make J.C. versions of every video lecture that CBT Nuggets have!

Other narrators i have heard sounds boring as hell compared to this motor mouth. :D
Conrad puts some funny stuff like jokes in between material AND has ability to keep topic interesting and listener awake.

Highly recommend for 'quick people'! Like i said he makes other sound boring, or almost like they were speakingin slow motion.
When i have watched some videos done by others than Conrad -in CBT as well as other companies- i have had almost unbearable urge to play videos with higher speed. 
Other guys talks so slowly and without same passion and dedication as J.C.

If there's an fan club for James Conrad i'd join immediately!"

I have studied many CBTs that he has made, and have been certified for them all."
