This is a 4-hour, $60 subscription Video Workshop which was recorded 2010-03-13. We were expecting 11 hours, like on CDs but the video was only 4 hours (Disc2 to Disc5). We included those 11 CDs in this torrent. If you have Abraham-Hicks 2010 1st Workshop Collection.torrent then you already have them.

Our intention is to connect with those that are attracting Abraham's material via torrents and with those that want to help us to make it available in a sharing format that is easy, economical and simple.

Remember that the SEEDERS are the backbone of Abraham-Hicks Torrents!

Jerry & Esther Hicks 
http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/index.php

For over 20 years Esther & Jerry Hicks have published hundreds of books, audio recordings and videos, and have conducted up to 60 workshops a year. Their work is derived from the teachings of "Non-Physical Source Energy" whom they refer to as "Abraham".

The Teachings of Abraham are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience.

"The thrill of the ride is carved out of the contrast. Without the contrast, you could not decide."

Answers and inspiration from the Non-Physical entity Abraham - whom Esther calls "infinite intelligence" and Jerry refers to as "the purest form of love I've ever encountered."


Thank you to all who participated to make this possible!
