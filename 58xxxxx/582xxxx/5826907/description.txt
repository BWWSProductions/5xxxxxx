I KNOW WHAT I SAW, a documentary guaranteed to change the way we see the universe. Director, James Fox assembled the most credible UFO witnesses from around the world to testify at The National Press Club in Washington D.C.: Air Force Generals, astronauts, military and commercial pilots, government and FAA officials from seven countries tell stories that, as Governor Fife Symington from Arizona stated, "will challenge your reality".

Their accounts reveal a behind-the-scenes U.S. operation whose policy is to confiscate and hoard substantiating evidence from close encounters to the extent that even Presidents have failed to get straight answers. I KNOW WHAT I SAW exposes reasons behind government secrecy from those involved at the highest level.

UFO Close Encounters

- The Reality as Seen by Former High Level Government and Military Officials
- Pilots to Tell Their UFO Stories for the First Time
- Group to call on US Government to Re-Open its Investigation

The American public is not alone when it comes to sighting what the US Air Force has labeled Unidentified
Flying Objects (UFOs). So too have former governors, high level military and government officials, highly
trained airplane pilots and aviation experts. The phenomenon is real. It happens worldwide. No one is sure about
its nature. Experts from seven countries will divulge what they have discovered about UFOs at a November 12
panel discussion moderated by former Arizona Governor Fife Symington (R) at the National Press Club.
Just one year ago, pilots, mechanics and managers from United Airlines witnessed a metallic disc-shaped object
hovering over the United Airlines Terminal at Chicagoâ€™s Oâ€™Hare Airport. The clearly observed object shot
straight up leaving a hole through the clouds. Despite the clear aviation safety issues involved, the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) never investigated the incident and dismissed it as weather. This head-in-theclouds
refusal to investigate stands in sharp contrast to efforts by governments of other countries to understand
these incidents.

â€œI believe that our government should take an active role in investigating this very real phenomenon,â€ said
Symington, who was a witness to the famed â€˜Phoenix Lightsâ€ incident seen by hundreds in Arizona while he was
governor. â€œThis panel consists of some of the most qualified people in the world with direct experience in dealing
with this issue, and they will bring incredible, irrefutable evidence, some never presented before, that we simply
cannot dismiss or ignore,â€ he said.

The group, using previously classified documents, will discuss many well-documented cases, including two
investigated by the US government. The first involves a Peruvian Air Force pilot who fired many rounds at a
UFO which was not affected. The second was an Iranian Air Force pilotâ€™s attempt to fire at a UFO, but whose
control panel became inoperable. â€œThis case is a classic that meets all the necessary conditions for a legitimate
study of the UFO phenomenon,â€ stated the US Defense Intelligence Agency document on the Tehran incident.
Both pilots will come forward to speak about these events publicly for the first time.

WHAT:

Former Arizona Governor Fife Symington will moderate a distinguished panel of former
high-ranking government, aviation, and military officials from seven countries to discuss
close encounters with what the US Air Force describes as Unidentified Flying Objects
(UFOs). Representatives from France, England, Belgium, Chile, Peru, Iran and the US
will call for the US Government to join in an international dialogue and re-open its
investigation â€“ which the Air Force shut down over 30 years ago â€“ in cooperation with
other governments currently dealing with this unusual and controversial phenomenon.
While on active duty, the panelists have either witnessed a UFO incident or have
conducted an official investigation into UFO cases relevant to aviation safety and
national security.
