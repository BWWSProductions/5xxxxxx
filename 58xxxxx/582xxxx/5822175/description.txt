Mystery Skulls of Palau

National Geographic scientist Lee Berger and a team of top scientists attempt to unearth the life and death of a vanished tribe in Palau, and put their very existence into perspective.Palau is a remote tropical island in the Pacific, 500 miles from any other land mass. 21,000 people live on the main islands of Palau, but there are also hundreds of additional uninhabited small islands. Modern man, Homo sapiens, evolved 195,000 years ago, but the first inhabitants of Palau were only thought to have arrived 3,000 years ago after traveling east from Indonesia. New discoveries change this thinking.
