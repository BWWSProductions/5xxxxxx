This is a torrent of a cache of original images I took of 10,000 items in a typical supermarket. All the baby food, all the cigarettes, all the condoms, all the snacks, all the soda..it's almost all here. Images were taken over about 3 months in 2008 and required over a dozen trips to various stores.

All of these pictures were taken for my video piece, 10000 items or less, which you can view here: http://vimeo.com/890119

I am hoping that people will find some interesting ways to play with such a large set of images. For example, I considered making a version of the video where I sorted all of the images by color, but never got around to it. An average of all of the frames could also be interesting.
