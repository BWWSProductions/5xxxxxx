,akertyne22,2010-09-27T06:57Z,I couldn't get activation patch to work. Ran half way then quit. As a result serial number was not accepted.

Activation works! Must patch first and use patched .exe pair with code. Again, thank you :)"

,schoolius,2011-05-14T20:37Z,The serial number provided in the text file definitely doesnt' work.  I suspect this is because I selected US as my location during the install.  I think it will work if I select UK as my location since the install file is labeled UK.  This should have been mentioned in the instructions though.  I'll try it again later and report my results.

,bay985,2012-01-27T01:04Z,"ANYONE HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THIS TORRENT! Check where your file is. :) I was having the same problem until I realized the file being extracted was going, by default, to C:\Program Files\MAGIX\Movie_Edit_Pro_16_Plus_Download_Version. The program was saved, however, to my Program Files (x86) folder. Simply go to Program Files, MAGIX, Movie_Edit_Pro_16..., and copy the program from there, then paste it to your the folder within Program Files (x86), overwriting the previous file that the activation code wouldn't work for. :) I hope that fixes your issues!"
