Mistaken Identity is the second album by Australian singer Delta Goodrem, released in Australia on November 8, 2004, a day before Goodrem's twentieth birthday, by Epic Records (see 2004 in music). Goodrem co-wrote some of the album with Guy Chambers, who also produced the album with Richard Flack and Steve Power. Mistaken Identity debuted at number-one on the Australian Albums Chart making it her second number-one album, but the sales did not match up to her previous album Innocent Eyes (2003) which sold 4.5 million copies worldwide. The album produced Goodrem two more number-one singles with "Out of the Blue" and "Almost Here", and the rest of the albums singles, "Mistaken Identity" and "A Little Too Late", became top twenty hits. The album features Goodrem's first duet, "Almost Here" (with Irish singer Brian McFadden).
