,51t,2010-09-10T19:15Z,It does have hard coded english subs. The Video Quality is also very good. -51t
,onegreatguy,2010-09-10T19:21Z,"Yes, it does."
,iamcims,2010-09-11T18:36Z,"Thank You. This is the best rip you'll find. Perfect quality. It's just like watching the actual blu-ray. It includes all the subtitles (which english speakers will turn off of) just like the blu-ray would. And also the main important thing is that the hard subs are included in this version, for when foreign language is used, like russian. Just like the movie intended it to be seen.

Thanks."

,slywrp,2010-09-11T22:54Z,"hard coded subs = Subs imbedded to the video image. Cannot be removed or replaced.

usual matroska subs = Subs inside the .mkv as a separate .sub or .srt file. Can be replaced and removed real easily with some muxer like mkvmerge.

I'm pretty sure this -Wiki releases usual matroska subbed stuff."

,k0ticgood,2011-02-10T12:24Z,I don't understand why this has 30 negative ratings to 4 positive. Could someone explain? Fellow uploader mass down-rating his competitor or something?
[V],GoodFilms,2011-02-20T01:08Z,ignore the stupid ratings. it's all one pathetic person.
