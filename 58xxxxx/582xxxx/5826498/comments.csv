Just noticed tomorrow (Monday) it's showing :

Monday:  The Gates, Mad Men, Rubicon  as 320p H264;

Does this mean no True Blood?
Many Thanks, Keep up the good work.

[V],twentyforty,2010-09-12T17:03Z,"@Lack8: It's my mistake, OLD, last week's schedule is a part of today's torrents. I usually swap the schedule at Sunday eve and post a new one in the description of the last torrent at Sunday - today it's NZ ""Boy"" DVDrip.

In advance - do not worry - tomorrow is full, ""normal"" Monday - with True Blood, Mad Man, Gates, Entourage, Rubicon, Hung and god-knows-what more..."
,Lack8,2010-09-12T17:30Z,Thank-you very much. Looking forward to another Great Encode! :)
,madtown4,2010-09-12T18:37Z,thank you !! big fan of your work!! 
,lilars26,2010-09-12T19:15Z,Thank you 20-40.
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-12T21:46Z,"@madtown4: I know my friend. I hope that your new job is good (as can be). Say hallo to your lovely wife.

@lilars: Both TiaraS today aren't  top quality, but that for Machete is a fifth one... previous four were unbelievably ugly CAMs."
,lilars26,2010-09-12T22:52Z,It looks and sounds pretty good.+1 from me.
,ohmuse,2010-09-13T18:40Z,"many cuts along the movie, the first one precisely when machete shot to robert de niro. good try, twentyforty, but i prefer to wait a movie with out cuts."
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-14T10:17Z,"@ohmuse: Be reasonable. How in hell one can say 'bout cut-outs - without comparing this CAM with theatrical release?
For sure, 99% of downloaders (as myself too) cannot afford going to cinema... 

By the way, you DO realize that this is a CAM video, right? And you do not think that I personally carried a cam in theater and shot this movie just for pleasure of being insulted on some way?

Next time, keep your shit inside your head. You should thank me or say nothing at all."
,ohmuse,2010-09-14T18:14Z,@twentyforty: you have a sparkling quality on your uploads. it's true because I have downloaded many of your torrents on mp4. but MACHETE with cuts is not your style.
,RnRTeeM,2010-09-14T23:39Z,nice job! but the only thing is the camera moves around a couple of times. other than that its a good cam. thanks uploader!!
