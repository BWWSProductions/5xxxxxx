This is not the run time of the file given in the torrent.. Its 1hr:47min:12s while the original run time is 2hr:35min.

Its good torrent with nice print on the second day of release but the sound isn't that good and I won't be watching it since I guess its ripped alot.. Seeding.

Its not the runtime of the file in this torrent. Original runtime is 2hrs 35min while this file is only 1hr 47min 12sec. 
Print is good for the second day release but audio quality isn't that good. I won't be watching it and wait for full release. Thanks anyway, Seeding.
