PLOT: Hung Season 2 continues brilliantly seeing Thomas Jane as Ray Drecker, a down-on-his-luck high school teacher and sports coach as he tries to supplement his income by being a male prostitute with the help of his friend Tanya (Jane Adams) and Rebecca Creskoff as Lenore Bernard. Complications arise as Drecker struggles with the eclectic responsibilities of his vocation as a prostitute, while dealing with his undying passions in life; ex-wife Jessica (Anne Heche) , and raising his two teenage children, fraternal twins Damon and Darby (Charlie Saxton and Sianoa Smit-McPhee).
