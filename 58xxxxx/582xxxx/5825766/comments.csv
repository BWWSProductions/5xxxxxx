,batterymax,2010-09-12T06:03Z,"How to restore original textures:
1. Goto: ""C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\bin"".
2. Open minecraft.jar with WinRAR.
3. Copy content of minecraft_original (not the entire folder) located in the same place to WinRAR window with opened minecraft.jar file (just ctrl+c/ctrl+v).
4. Click OK.

Buy this game, It's totally worth it!"
,Renegade78,2010-09-12T06:11Z,I put together a new torrent with default textures: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5825855

,NanoEntity,2010-09-12T06:16Z,"Original Textures are in 

/.minecraft
/bin
/minecraft_original

Move all the files into ""minecraft.jar"" in BIN Folder.

You can open ""minecraft.jar"" with WINZIP or Winrar program."

,Renegade78,2010-09-12T06:27Z,"@Nano
Should have left the jar file as it was and made a separate folder for your custom textures, not the other way around."

,NanoEntity,2010-09-12T06:34Z,"@Renegade78
Dose it matter?
Quite high jacking my torrent.

All the files are there, besides im sure people will replace textures anyways with something else.

All original textures are in ""minecraft_original"" folder, most people can figure its not that hard to miss."

,Renegade78,2010-09-12T06:49Z,"What's with the comments not showing up until I repost? Weird.

@Nano
I know all the files are there, but not everyone is as computer savvy as you would expect. Just doesn't make sense to me why you would impose your own textures as the default when you could have just left them on the side as an option."

,NanoEntity,2010-09-13T00:05Z,"Muliplayer only works with the server i have posted here, its especially configured for LAN.

You wont be able to play on real servers."
,XxVinsxX,2010-09-13T00:46Z,"yeah we play on the server you said and then i gave him my ip but it dosent work, :( so we need to be on a lan?"
,NanoEntity,2010-09-13T01:45Z,"Direct IP should work

Make sure you and your friends firewall is not blocking the game/server.

And make sure your ports are open for the server.
If you have a router that's where the problem is, not open ports."
,mudkips1997,2010-09-13T03:06Z,"""failed to connect:refused"" any ideas?, also i cant run minecraft.jar from this one""main class"" that i cant find."
,gakor,2010-09-13T03:32Z,"Alright then so can someone write a simple guide on how to get people into our own servers?

I understand that with this we cannot play on a normal server,
but when using the server files provided to create my own server, how do I get my friends to join?
I tried following the directions exactly.

When someone tries to connect to the IP provided to them by me [which I get from www.whatismyip.com], they cannot connect. I also noticed that no message of them trying to connect appears on the server console.

HOWEVER. I am able to join my own server from another computer in my network through my local IP [192.168.0.1xx].

Any ideas?"
,tgslothic,2010-09-13T03:53Z,"Everything is working fine (though I can only connect using 192.198.1.xxx) except that tnt isn't working in multiplayer mode. I give myself tnt and set it off and the ground gets destroyed but then the ground respawns as if there way no tnt.

How do I change it to allow tnt to be able to destroy things?"
,tgslothic,2010-09-13T03:55Z,Oh and how do I use commands that make it day time?
,gakor,2010-09-13T04:15Z,"@tgs:
The spawn area is protected, and things respawn as soon as they're destroyed.

Have you tried moving away?"
,NanoEntity,2010-09-13T06:30Z,"I added a mod to server to prevent TNT and LAVA from destroying things, its to prevent griefing on the server.

You don't want someone logging into your server and blowing up everything you build.

type /help for list of commands.
/time day

And spawn area is Protected yes, only ADMIN can edit spawn area."
,gakor,2010-09-13T06:33Z,"That's cool, but it would be GREAT if you could help me out with my problem. :D"

,NanoEntity,2010-09-13T07:15Z,"Found the BUG, don't use 127.0.0.1, no one will be able to log in lol.

Use your server IP to log into.

Works fine, tested it on my laptop and desktop PC."
,NanoEntity,2010-09-13T07:19Z,"Also KIT.txt needs to be adjusted.

If Player, Player, Player logs into game.

They can only use 1 kit very 5min.

So just remove the time on it.

Also other way would be change user name when logging into server, but that don't work anymore."

,coke192,2010-09-13T21:15Z,what do u mean by server ip ? the one who starts with 192.xxx.x.xxx ???
,omega2346,2010-09-14T00:07Z,"THe problem witht eh multiplayer is that it only works for ""lan"" addresses, an easy way yo bypass this is use hamachi with your friends for it's ""virutal"" lan, "
,NanoEntity,2010-09-14T00:26Z,"Yes Use Server ip 192.xxx.x.xxx.

Do not use Local 127.0.0.1."

Go to

It let him connect but then he immediately disconnected because he was ""already connected"".

I tried changing the server's ip in the config files to the hamachi one and it still didn't work.

Is the problem that everyone has the same username?  (Scruffy Puppy)
