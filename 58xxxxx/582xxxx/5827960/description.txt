Special thanks to http://www.archive.org/details/SmashingPumpkins where the original live recordings can be found, as well as tapers Eric Agnew and Lapis, since the recordings were used from 8.10 & 8.11 in Tokyo and 8.28 in LA for the SSMF, respectively. I left all of the tags as is (except for the track numbers) so you guys get the credit you deserve.


Be sure to check smashingpumpkins.com any day now for the free download of the 6th Teargarden track, and be sure to request the current single, Freak, on your local rock radio station.

Rock on,
