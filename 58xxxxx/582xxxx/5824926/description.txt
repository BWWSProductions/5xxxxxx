Mixed Race is Tricky's most passionate album to date. Musically his production work takes influences from UK, Jamaica, the US, North Africa and French music. The album is an intense lyrical journey with temptation, reflection, mischief and misbehavior. There's a wealth of knowledge distilled within the music as Tricky approaches twenty years of recording. "Every album is a learning experience and this is concentrated music, there's no dilution" said Tricky of his new collection, "I've spent my life going between cultures; Mixed Race is about that in a very direct way."
