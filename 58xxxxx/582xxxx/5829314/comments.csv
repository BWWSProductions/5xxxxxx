,zadig1,2010-09-17T05:51Z,"""Stephen Hawking is such an asshole who think that he got unknown knowledge and he is sure that he only knows; in reality he did nothing for science and his ideas are crap; looser"" -deadGenius                                                                I've seen some really stupid comments on TPB, but this one may be the most jaw droppingly stupid thing ever written.  deadGenius, please do us all a favor and put a bullet in you own brain."

There, it's done, no more need for it."
,sublimize,2010-11-30T01:40Z,"deadgenius, I agree, Stephen Hawking what a moron.  I mean, who hasn't discovered radiation coming from blackholes?  Come on Hawking, tell me something I didn't know."
,emynor,2011-11-28T14:26Z,Thanks for the fantastic upload joeblowman. Thanks for sharing the knowledge. As for you deadgenius: You REALLY ought to be dead and you are most certainly NO genius!
