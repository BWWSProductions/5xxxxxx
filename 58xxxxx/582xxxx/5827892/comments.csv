,Camel-Toe,2010-09-14T05:43Z,"There is no virus in the pics.
@ konk684 you propably got the virus from some ass beating you took from the gay club.

Someone delete or ban this troll."
,monkeyman114,2010-09-15T02:21Z,"Its common to get false positives if you have turned on heuristic scanning, or if you use AVG.

Just don't rename any of them .js and execute them 8-)"

Camel-Toe , seriously, just grow âup and learn to see the value of an educated trading community."
,Camel-Toe,2010-12-15T06:05Z,"@konk684

I'm trading and you're not educated by leaving noob comments that are totaly false.

Go back to your community fag house and get your value by trading your ass for that virus you keep moaning about.

Shit I hate fuckers like you that complain about freebies."
