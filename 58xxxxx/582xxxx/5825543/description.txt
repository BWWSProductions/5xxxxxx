You're all in for a treat. I created a great concert from almost scratch

And if it's not too much trouble tell me what you tought of it once you downloaded and watched it    :) 

This is the Hang Cool Teddy Bear US Concert Tour 2010.

There have been a lot of lose clips from the concerts floating on the web lately. So I decided to collect them and make one big concert out of them.

I used two audio sources for this dvd. 
Most of the sound is from the bootleg cd from the 'Mohegan Sun Casino'. It was taped on july 12th from the audience. Very nice quality for a fan recording.

Second source is the House of Blues in Texas concert from August 26. I used that mainly for the talk with the audience stuff (some very funny stuff in here)

Then I used video sources from:
Fantasy Springs Resort Casino, Indio
Gibson Amphitheatre, California
Seminole Hardrock in Hollywood, Florida
House of Blues, Texas
PNC Bank Arts Centre, New Jersey 

And I started mixing them together. It's all audience video recordings so don't expect professional quality here.

I grabbed all the clips I had and started to lypsinc them with the sound. And for most part I think I succeeded.

What's left is a 110 minute concert giving you a very good impression of Meat's current tour. It's almost complete only missing two or so songs

It took me weeks to get it right (or at least good enough to make it show) so again please let me know what you think of it   :D 

Besides that all credits go to the fans that video/audio taped the material I used.
