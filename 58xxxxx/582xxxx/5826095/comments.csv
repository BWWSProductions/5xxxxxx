,freakshow999,2010-09-12T11:04Z,"Is this the same one that is actually The Experiment that was uploaded both here and on deomoid by another nl sub upper?

Sorry got to ask..."
[V],NLUPPER002,2010-09-12T11:11Z,"@freakshow999

No this real and AVCHD version.

The other was a mistake of me.

Sorry for that.

And the uppers are the same, just me."
,Notanumbnut,2010-09-12T12:28Z,Many thanks DUDE!
,devildog93,2010-09-13T02:11Z,"Really hope I don't waste another 3 days on ANOTHER copy of The Experiment.  Bad enough show as it is, now I have 2 copies of it.  Please don't be a third."
,Firedog747,2010-09-13T05:06Z,"This is The Experiment NOT The Expendables nice try ""Trusted"""
,Firedog747,2010-09-13T05:32Z,"This is ""The Experiment"" NOT ""The Expendables"" Wrong description! "
,x7thdayx,2010-09-13T14:11Z,Really? An ISO? Ridiculous.
,VelociLord,2010-09-13T16:38Z,Has anyone finished downloading this .ISO yet and can confirm that this is The Expendables rather than The Experiment?
,Nasua,2010-09-13T17:29Z,This iso is in udf 2.5 format you need toshiba udf driver to extract or view !!! 
,pizzahut123,2010-09-13T18:15Z,dumbass -_-
,offset,2010-09-14T21:33Z,"Its real deal. Movie is ""The Expendables""
Good quality.

With Mac you can watch it: mount the ISO with Discimagemounter and go to folder BDMW/stream/and there is file 0000.m2ts 
Use VLC to open it."
,peppes bodega,2010-09-15T16:44Z,det er riktig film bare mounta med ultra iso gì±… till folder stream och kopiere til valfri mapp!!
,Notanumbnut,2010-09-16T20:22Z,The film has been zipped with Winrar and then PASSWORD PROTECTED!!!!
,Notanumbnut,2010-09-16T20:31Z,"Ok, file is  passworded but here is what I did!
The film IS 'The Expendables'..
Firstly mount the '.mds' file (I used Daemon Tools Lite')..
Go to the CD drive that now says 'The Expendables' and find the folder that says 'BDMV' then the folder 'Stream'..
Play the .mts file with VLC player or a fully spunked Media player..
Job done!
I have NEVER had to do this before but it was free so 'musn't grumble' :)
Thanks uploader, although I nearly put a curse on you. :)"
[T],megadethmen,2010-10-07T20:00Z,no way you cant use iso files ppl. bury yourself!
,dake71,2010-10-07T23:09Z,kan je deze aub uploaden in mkv 1080p ac3 +dts
,zemiakovica,2010-10-13T23:31Z,"This simply doesn't work. Maybe telling us what uncommon program you used to create the .iso file could have helped. Or anything telling us anything about the compression used. I'm mad as hell for downloading this bullshit. I guessed that trusted means something here, I guess it means virus free torrent, nothing about torrent quality however."
,zemiakovica,2010-10-13T23:54Z,"OK I made it work ( winXP sp3 ). It doesn't support the file structure of the disc.

I had to download cyberlink powerdvd , mount the image .mds file with daemon tools, and play the dvd drive through the powerdvd. Windows would see the drive as corrupt but powerdvd will play it."
,jolsrud2000,2010-10-21T10:46Z,"Bullshit movie, TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!!"
,reine12,2010-11-01T08:36Z,"Why don't you up the movie as an .mkv and spare all the problems? It's obviously a stripped bd anyway?! (7,91GB). 

Seems that a lot of people are having difficulties with this one?!"
,reine12,2010-11-01T09:19Z,"@ Firedog:

What's all the bullshit about ""The Experiment""?"
,jesusxenu,2010-11-12T15:22Z,"Says AVCHD right in the title.
fucking idiots, try to read before you comment."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-11-12T20:21Z,"Dolby Digital Audio English 448 kbps 5.1 ? there is no DTS or 640 KB/s AC3? weird upload for a 1080 BDRip.
Besides all the fuss with the Iso & Dammon...
better wait a couple of days for a proper BDRip 1080p mkv.
And I thought NLUPPER002 is professional...yuk
Encoding it to a proper x264(High profile encoding)
takes up to two days and couldn't wait because NLUPPER002 wanted to be the first uploader of 1080p?"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-03T20:57Z,"For the know-it-alls that actually upload nothing themselves, unlike DVD iso's, AVCHD iso's are blu-ray structured, so WinRAR, MagicISO and alike will NOT recognise them - if you will need to extract the files/folders from the image with PowerISO v4.5 or later, or mount the iso directly onto a virtual drive using Daemon Tools or similar.

For the fellow uploaders that have just come here to take low blows at ULUPPER002 - you should be ashamed of yourselves. What was the problem, did you come to take the torrent and upload it yourselves, and it wasn't what you wanted? Bless..."
