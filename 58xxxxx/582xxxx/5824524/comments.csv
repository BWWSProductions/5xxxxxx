,x0myheart0x,2011-05-06T01:52Z,"Yes, I do agree with Pro21.
Thanks for letting us know it's spanish.

Though, my question is, where can I download all 291 Dubbed DBZ episodes?  I have them on my laptop, but of course it broke, so I'm trying to get in on this computer, and I cannot find anything!! WTF?! >-"
,megatron333,2011-12-09T01:29Z,Spanish is the best version of this anime !!! as good as Japanese. @fakebest read a little more so you would know that Spanish is from Spain not Mexico idiot!! i understand that in America the education is poor but common!!!
,jvmunhoz,2012-06-30T15:26Z,"Well, as soon as the fansub I get the episodes finish  DBZ Dragon Box (it's a Brazilian fansub) I will upload it here, it contains english dub, PT-BR dub e Jap dub, with  PT-BR subs and english dubs. Hope you like it."
