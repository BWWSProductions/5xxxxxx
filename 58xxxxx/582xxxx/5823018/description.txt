Meltdown: The Men Who Crashed the World

The secret history of the global financial collapse kicks off a new season of CBC Televisionâ€™s flagship documentary series, Doc Zone, with the first instalment of the four-part series MELTDOWN, on Sept. 9 at 9 p.m. (9:30 p.m. NT).  

Trillions of dollars have been spent jump-starting economies and rescuing financial institutions over the past two years, and yet the financial collapse that started in 2008 continues to send shock waves around the globe. Now, MELTDOWN traces the stories of the bankers who crashed the world, the leaders who struggled to save itâ€”and the ordinary families who got crushed.

The CBCâ€™s Terence McKenna takes viewers behind the headlines and behind the scenesâ€”into the backrooms of the highest levels of governments and financial institutions from Wall Street to Dubai to Chinaâ€”and reveals the backstabbing and the tension as the world comes dangerously close to another Great Depression.

MELTDOWNâ€™s cast of characters includes Geraint Anderson, a.k.a. City Boy, a hippie-turned-stockbroker in England who reveals the dirty secrets of high finance; Dick Fuld, the former CEO of Lehman Brothers, who boasted that he would rip out and eat his enemiesâ€™ hearts, but watched his own empire collapse; and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the self-styled CEO of Dubai Inc., who built a real estate empire that turned out to be largely a mirage.

Viewers will also meet desperate homeowners in California, disillusioned autoworkers at the end of the line in Ontario, and furious workers in France who shocked the world by kidnapping their own bosses. To date, no major banking, regulatory or government figures have been convicted of any wrongdoing.

Part 1
The Men Who Crashed the World
Greed and recklessness by the titans of Wall Street triggers the largest financial crash since the Great Depression. It's left to US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, himself a former Wall Street banker, to try and avert further disaster.
