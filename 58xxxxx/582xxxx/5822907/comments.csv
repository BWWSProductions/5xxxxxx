,vaska123,2010-09-10T21:16Z, is Bootable Media with Plus pack?

No, you must install all the suite and create it."

Great up! Is there a recommended ""order"" for installing the ""Add-ons"" and ""Plus Pack""? And, what features are included in the ""Bootable Media"" ISO?"

You can take only the boot disk in this folder.

You can install only Add-on, only Plus Pack o both.

I installed the ""Media Add-Ons"". It added a ""Media Add-Ons"" folder under the ""Acronis"" folder.

But, it's not clear how to use this to build the ""BartPE""? Are there directions elsewhere to be found?"

BartPE is a long story ...

,nittany,2010-10-24T05:02Z,"Created a backup using this and it did it and verified it, so far so good, but I haven't tried restoring anything.

Also, only the main Acronis True Image program is build #5519 in this torrent.  The plus pack and media add-ons are the older build 5105.
