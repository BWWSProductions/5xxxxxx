,Pro21,2010-09-11T08:55Z,This is my first-time uploading a torrent. Please leave feedback and ratings to let me know how it turned out! Hopefully I didn't fuck it up!
[S],velvet.,2010-09-11T09:02Z,"You really need to get yourself a modern bit torrent client, such as uTorrent or Vuze.

The old BitComet crap you are using is way past its best before date.  :("
,Pro21,2010-09-11T09:56Z,Well Velvet as I have previously stated...I'm new to this but thanks for the tips and I'll look into it and make the switch if it is what you claim.
,darkedness1,2010-09-11T12:06Z,"Sorry it is not that hard since I had uploaded it on the 5th of July. Best bet is to search the title of the item you want to upload, then make sure it is not in TPB.

,3xil3d,2010-09-19T05:37Z,where is 6???
,3xil3d,2010-09-19T05:38Z,where is number 6
,Pro21,2010-09-22T09:34Z,"@velvet: you are correct, i have officially dumped BitComet and made the permanent switch to uTorrent, thanks for that! 

@darkedness1: sorry about that but at the time i had ran my search (prior to me creating and uploading this torrent) i did not come across your UL, maybe something got crossed there not sure...? :-/

@everyone: i'm going to try and upload some stuff that is not too common on TPB, but again, that is kind of tough to do... more on the way soon! :-D"
,3xil3d,2010-10-19T20:57Z,hey can you upload americunt dragon 2? just like this one? cuz i cant open a .rar file
,Pro21,2010-10-28T09:58Z,"@3xil3d: a tip: you can download the winrar software here on tpb (full-licensed version). once you have it then you can start using .rar files. hope this helps! 

(i don't want to upload another torrent of the same when it's already available on the bay! :-))"
