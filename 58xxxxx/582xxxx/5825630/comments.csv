Is it a PB quirk or is the torrent at fault?"
,wencitofrum,2010-09-12T09:05Z,"same think here.

I'm getting a 'broken link' answer everytime.

Does anyone know the reason?"
,AARRGGHHH,2010-09-12T22:27Z,"Are you guys still having problems with this one? I'm showing it uploading at 100K with 12 seeders and 16 leachers, it should be fine. "
,wencitofrum,2010-09-12T22:58Z,"yes, the problem is still the same, and appears only for this torrent.

I havo no idea why."
,AARRGGHHH,2010-09-13T00:25Z,"Everything is fine on my end, so I can't figure out  what's causing the problem. I'll check in the forum  to see if anyone knows what can cause the broken link error."
,AARRGGHHH,2010-09-13T04:32Z,"Okay, according to a very helpful mod in the forum, it's an issue with the server that the torrent is stored on. 

Workaround: Use the magnet link, that IS working. The mod mentioned current versions of Vuze (Azureus), uTorrent, and Transmission, as working with Magnet Links. "
,wencitofrum,2010-09-13T07:48Z,"The workaround works. 

Thank you for taking the time of finding out and explaining."
,AARRGGHHH,2010-09-13T08:04Z,"You're very welcome. I take my porn very seriously. :) 

Happy Wanking !! "
