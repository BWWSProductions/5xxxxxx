LIGHTSHINE is a very unknown but great band from the Krautrock german scene, which was formed in Emmerich by Wolfgang, Ulli, Joe and Egonwhen when they were about 20. They played very trippy and beautiful music pieces, in the style of AMON DÃœÃœL II, ELOY, with a little touch of LED ZEPPELIN, GENESIS and PINK FLOYD. The band manages to bring something new to the Krautrock movement.
In 1973, they released their unique album, Feeling, edited with a limited number of copies. The disc features great epic floating long pieces, mostly dominated by electric floating guitar and alternates relaxing and catchy passages. An unknown classic of Krautrock !
