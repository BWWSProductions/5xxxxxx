"Moxy FrÃ¼vous was a  socially  conscious and politically  satirical
 folk-pop  band  from  Thornhill,  Ontario,  Canada. The  band  was
 founded  in  1989, and was  active  throughout  the  1990s. Common
 themes in FrÃ¼vous songs include Canada and the "human experience".

 The band  formed in 1989 when  Jian  Ghomeshi  (then going by Jean
 Ghomeshi), Murray Foster  and  Mike Ford, former classmates at the
 local Thornlea  Secondary  School and playing in a pub band called
 The Chia Pets at the time, joined with David Matheson to  busk  in
 Toronto. They drew  unusually  large  crowds, and, eventually, the
 attention of  Toronto-based  CBC  Radio, which commissioned  songs
 about political and local issues for the radio show Later the Same
 Day. Some songs  written  for the  show  later  appeared  on their
 albums; these songs include "The Gulf War Song" and "My Baby Loves
 a Bunch of Authors", which was  written  for  a  Toronto  authors'
 festival.

 They cut a six-song demo tape in 1992, and their first major-label
 album, Bargainville, was released the next year. Its single, "King
 of Spain", was only the second Canadian  independent #1 hit in the
 country's  history. (Torontonians Barenaked Ladies were first by a
 few months, with  1991's  "Be My Yoko Ono".) Shortly  after,  they
 embarked on a touring schedule that continued, practically without
 stopping except to record new material, until the end of 2000.

 The band sometimes sang with little or no accompaniment in a style
 similar to contemporary a cappella. A number of their  songs  also
 express the band's progressive  political  leanings ("The Greatest
 Man in America", for instance, harps on  Rush  Limbaugh,  and "Big
 Fish"  lambastes  former Premier of Ontario Mike  Harris). FrÃ¼vous
 was also known for their  close  relationship  with their fans and
 their  live  shows,  which  were  full  of  political  commentary,
 humorous banter, and musical improvisation.

 The band gave its last  concert in 2000 (excepting performances at
 annual fan conventions in 2001 and 2002)."

Great album from a dinky little Canadian band, Moxy FrÃ¼vous. I ripped
these personally and securely with the use of EAC. The logs are incl-
uded, as is the cue sheet. A bit-for-bit rip.

Comments and feedback welcome.

Enjoy the music. Seeding is sharing. ~Igneous_X4
