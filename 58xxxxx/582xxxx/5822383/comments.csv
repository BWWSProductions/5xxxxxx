see what bubanee (V.I.P.) has to say about piratelionheart's torrent...
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5817655/
(quoted from the above link)
""@ piratelionheart..

if your going to post your link on my torrents, which i couldn't give a shit about at least write the correct info.. your 320 has a cutoff rate of 18.9khz which makes it a V2 or 196mp3.. roughly..
if your new to this turning a V2/196 into a 320 makes it a transcode and does not offer any better sound but more MB's for people to waste there download on.. """
