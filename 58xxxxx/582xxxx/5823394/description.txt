All the songs are embedded with complete ID3v1, ID3v2.3, Lyrics, Lyrics3v2 and Album Art information. Will be uploading every three to four weeks as its a tedious job to find high quality media files and then top it up with embedded information. If you can find anything like this anywhere i wont take the pain to do this.. so lemme know. Seed and Leave Comment. Cheers!
