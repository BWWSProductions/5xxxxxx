About Living with Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is a malignant tumour in the breast. The severity of the disease depends on the size of the cancer and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.

Being diagnosed with breast cancer can be overwhelming. Making decisions about treatment and management including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be difficult. Women, their partners and families need support to cope with the emotional impact of the illness on their daily lives.

Speaking From Experience offers first hand accounts from women who have experienced breast cancer from their diagnosis and treatment, how their illness has affected their lives and how they are facing the future.
