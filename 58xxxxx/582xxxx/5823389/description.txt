The title of 1969's SIR JOHNALOTÃ  is actually long and wordy in the finest Joycean fashion. Whatever you call it, this collection of traditional-style songs and ballads is John Renbourn's finest solo album. Acoustic six and 12-string guitars, played in Renbourn's inimitable style, accompany period instruments, reeds, and even a bit of sitar and Indian percussion.

Renbourn's remarkable skills are on display throughout, but this is not merely a display of chops. The playing is entirely in service to the song. When Renbourn reels off a dazzlingly fleet-fingered solo on a piece like "White Fishes" or "Sweet Potato," it's because that's what the song needed. The album gets progressively jazzier as it goes on, until the closing "Seven Up" suggests Django Reinhardt set loose in a medieval fair. Wonderful stuff, and one of the finest guitar-instrumental albums ever.
