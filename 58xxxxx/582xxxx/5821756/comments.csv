,davidouu,2010-09-10T19:54Z,"Can you read?
What would be the point of me saying this is different and pucker compared to the pile of shite that was with the original release......take a chance, its all of 90k...."
,davidouu,2010-09-10T20:22Z,"And while I am here I may as well point out that your grammar is borderline illiterate.

Sentences start with a capital letter, I think you will find that as the word 'subtitles' is pluralised that you should correctly refer to them, as 'these' and not 'this'.

One is a word, unless forming part of a date, telephone or other numerical reference, hence I am sure you meant to write 'one' as opposed to '1'

In addition 'that has' (which would have been the correct grammar) is shortened to 'that's' and not 'thats'.

Finally, I am unsure what the letter n signifies in between the word 'around', perhaps you meant in fact to write 'and'.

I thank you very much for querying the grammatical correctness or otherwise of the aforementioned subtitle file.

That is all."

,LittleFang,2010-11-13T04:27Z,"Hi davidouu,

earlier this year, in the comments for lozza367c's upload of 'This Life - Series 2', you mentioned that you had fixed the problems with the episodes and that you would upload it if people were interested.

I realise I'm only one person, but am sure there will be others who'd like to see the second series too.. Anyway, I just wanted to express my interest (and my commitment to seeding it) if you ever have a chance to upload your good version.

Cheers!

Oh - and I know I'm late to this party, too, but I thought your comment (above) to Zombie_Boy was hilarious, by the way."
