I suppose your mom never told u anything about a false positive.

3/42 and no major antivirus detected a virus
=CLEAN"
,parmourson23,2010-09-12T11:21Z,"This is Clean, only the keygen may give a false reading,Run it Sandboxed if you that worried."
,mickpitkin92,2010-09-12T20:47Z,"If you need to run the KeyGen sandboxed then use the PSEXEC utility from Sysinternals with the -L option and the path to key gens executable.

The -L option only works on Vista and Later with UAC enabled though."

all u need to do is run keymaker and click register
then run alcohol (it will be registered)"
