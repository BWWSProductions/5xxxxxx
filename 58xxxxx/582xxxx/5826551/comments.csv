,tony4561,2011-08-01T17:26Z,What an a-hole who posted this with a password that requires a lot of crap before finding out you can't get it
,Amea81,2011-08-03T03:51Z,So what's the password then?
,k1037,2011-08-16T08:04Z,"I'm not sure what theo4000 or tony4561 are talking about, but these are all separate epub files - no RARs, no text files, no passwords."
,Lordsbassman,2011-08-19T11:17Z,This looks like the exact same list cydia/xsellize has listed haha! nice.
,Joab1,2011-09-23T23:24Z,"I don't understand why these faggots keep posting about passwords over and over again. 
Seriously, how long must it take you to make new accounts over and over?
Go and get a life instead of failing to ruin a great torrent.

Thanks arsvs"
