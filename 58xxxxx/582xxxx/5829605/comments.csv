Used mkvmerge to remove unwanted audio tracks and subtitles, and it played back fine using VLC Media Player.
Thx a lot!"

Video length 2:01:29.615
Audio length 2:01:27.296

What the fuck I suppose to do now? Stretch the audio out?"

in vlc, click file - advanced open file - and in the top tab browse and select the MKV file

it then also says 'play another media synchronously' browse and select the English AC3 2CH file and audio and video will play in sync
