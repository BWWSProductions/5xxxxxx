This torrent contains 333 Harry Potter Fan Fics. I do not claim any of the works contained within as my own. I just used a Fan Fiction Downloader (included) to download them.

The Title and Author metadata is all set and should display properly. These files are all in the .mobi format, but can be easily converted en masse with Calibre. (Also included.) These files will work on a Kindle very well and I am sure other readers too.

As to the fan fics themselves, some of them are very well written and engaging, while others are not. Almost all of these have over 40,000 words in them and several are even close to a million words. They are all in English and pretty much every genre is covered.

All of these were available publicly on FanFiction.net within the last few months.

I have no idea how popular this torrent will be, but I hope you enjoy it! :)
