,assholo,2010-09-14T11:43Z,fucking ew. all they did was hard limit the songs and raise the treble until it makes your ears bleed. fuck you rhino records.
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-09-14T13:17Z,"There are only 2 discs - look in the details - Disc 1 has 12 tracks, and disc 2 has 12 tracks...... 

CD1 features the original album remastered, while CD2 has live
performances. Enjoy!

Get your info right before you have a moan - and it was free!!! (what's the betting i don't get an apology............)"
,assholo,2010-09-14T17:37Z,"i didn't mean any offense to you, it's just that you had this listed as the deluxe edition earlier, which is the three cd set, while the two disc set is called the ""extended edition"". i'm sorry i was a dick, but this remaster really pissed me off, it's clear that it's just a grab for cash. thanks for the upload for sure though, you saved me from wasting any money on this trash"
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-09-14T18:29Z,"Apology accepted, but its the 20th anniversary edition - not deluxe"
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-09-14T18:32Z,"Sorry, I didn't mean to sound like an idiot then - i mean i hadn't listed it as the deluxe edition lol? Glad you didn't waste your money anyways!"
,hogrod,2010-09-15T03:11Z,"I Agree with Assholo, The sound quality sucks on this remaster. I'm on my way to emergency room now to get my ears looked at to stop the bleeding. 

Nothing against the uploader/ripper its just shitty mastering. "
