Group Notes

After more than a half decade we think it is time
to change this message. The scene changed so much
in the past few years. Many lamers hangin\' around
sharing scene  releases on  public places such as
FXP-Pubs, DC hubs,  P2P  networks  and  so  on.

WE  DON\'T  WANT  OUR  RELEASES  GETTiNG
SPREAD  TO  SUCH  LAME  PLACES

The psytrance scene is kinda small and needs YOUR
SUPPORT. If  you LOVE  this  music  (like we do),
please BUY the music  (like we do)  Artists work
long & hard on their music.  Please be honest and
support the  artists & labels  to make more great
music in the future too.  Every sold  CD  counts
Our  releases are  meant  for promotion only - to
give  you  a  sample  of  the  retail  product.

NEVER FORGET - THiS iS NOT A COPY, iT\'S JUST MP3

Furthermore we wanna say thanks to all the people
who made this  whole thing  happen,  in the past,
present and future.  And finally, we want to send
greetings  to  all our  fellow  friends  within
the    scene  You  know    who    you  are
