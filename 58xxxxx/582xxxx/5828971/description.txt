Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Einstein's Relativity and the Quantum Revolution: Modern Physics for Non-Scientists
(24 lectures, 30 minutes/lecture). Taught by Richard Wolfson, Dartmouth College.
   
Noww you can learn the basic ideas behind the theory of relativity and quantum physics from 24 lectures that require no special background in math or science. 

Professor Richard Wolfson teaches the awe-inspiringÃ¹and even, at times, mind-bendingÃ¹concepts of modern physics in ways that anyone interested in learning can readily master.

With scientists perhaps on the verge of unlocking the deepest secrets of the universe and with breaking news of discovery after discovery, an understanding of this fascinating subject has never been so important.
