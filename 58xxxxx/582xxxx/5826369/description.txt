This is the plugin that allows the license you use for cs3 to be used for cs5 in after effects.

You will need to grab these for this to work and all credit for them up-loaders.

Just to confirm that this is the 64bit plugin that works on just windows systems and for After Effects CS5, and instructions on how to make it work.

Thanks....
