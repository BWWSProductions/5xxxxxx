Realy appreciate it
Was very busy so couldn't respond before

@ Iron Man 2 

Was facing problem with the movie as I used the wrong source the first time
Redoing it, so it may take some more time
If it done by the time og my next upload I will post it or else Matrix trilogy would be posted

@ friends

I was doing the Uncut Dvdrip version .... even completed 5 seasons but as it is the old series the quality was not that good
Fortunately found a good source at IPT, its 480p (700x480) resolution. The quality though not perfect is better than Saint dvdrip versionSo am staring on it ....... Its a big 75 gb version.
Though I will keep my december deadline for Friends

@ The Wire, Supernatural

Next month

@ axis

Will be doing Toy story 3 720p when it comes ..... Sorry abt the others

,PHREEBO,2010-09-24T08:04Z,"I used latest VLC w/k-lite (on PC 1) & KMPlayer w/CCCP (on PC 2) and the first film's audio was noticeably out of sync on both systems. The video quality was not that great for the size, and it had seeking problems.
Hey, I have a request, could some people stop drinking the cool aid and actually post about the actual quality of this upload, as to at least confirm or reject my findings..... whatever... We need more trusted commentators of sustenance and less vacuous propaganda. The skulls and big swarm sizes don't seem to mean much anymore..
Thanks to all that contribute!"
,muthineni,2010-10-04T17:56Z,"no sample riddler?
i was about to dowload when i saw the previous comment...
saved myself lot of space n time.
guys stop shitting on the torrent with all ur requests instead use it for what it was mean to be
......... commentin on quality or thanking.....

if it had a sample it would have been fine but otherwise ur all being fags with ur fag requests"
,PHREEBO,2010-10-15T11:35Z,"You said it muthineni, I guess I'm too polite, I'm glad to see i'm not alone on this... 
As for the rip, I do understand that making small MKVs is not easy, and they may(?) play fine on some machines but not well on others.
The fastest machine I tested this on (from my comment above) was 1.6 ghz with 1 tb of ram on XP, so that may be part of my problem.
Still, I get no problems with most MKVs on these machines. MKVGuy's rips seem to work the best for me.
In the end, I did find a good copy of this collection from Booster2 here at TPB. It's 8.20 GB XviD, but no subs. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5343069/Star_Wars_I__II__III__IV__V__VI"

so i went out to find it online... here it is from opensubtitles:
http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitleserve/sub/3962428"
,miketheratguy,2011-07-31T03:50Z,"I signed up specifically so I could address this set. I don't want to come off as a dick or anything, but there are all kinds of strange things about this set that mystifies me.

First of all, let me make clear that the actual quality (that is, the video and audio clarity) is excellent. I'm really satisfied with that. I just don't know if I can keep these because they seem like some sort of alternate cut between the special editions and 2004 dvd releases. For example:

1: In A New Hope, the SE additions such as the dewbacks and Jawa comedy at the cantina are present. Yet, Han still shoots first. Huh?

2: Empire does NOT have Ian Mcdiarmid in the role as Emperor; that is still played by the woman with the superimposed chimpanzee eyes.

3: Yet, Jedi still has Hayden Christensen rather than Sebastian Shaw joining the Force at the end.

4: Sith ends a good ten minutes faster than it should due to a faster framerate, and the last minute or so of the credits ARE cut off. And at about 2:08:30 of the end credits, some weird calypso music (sounds like Dido's ""Thank You"") is mixed in with John Williams' score. WTF?

5: In Clones, the end of the movie (notably the Dooku duels) becomes jittery as if the framerate has abruptly changed.


I didn't even watch these all the way through (or watch episode I at all) so I don't know about the rest; these are just random observations from skipping through.

It's not that I'm trying to complain- again, these are free; I appreciate the upload; and the AV quality is excellent. It's just....well, I don't even know what to do with these. On one hand TESB seems to be the special edition without the re-done Emperor, which is strange because I'm unaware of the SE being on disc yet this is easily dvd / bluray quality. But then the consistency is thrown off when, in ROTJ, we're getting Hayden Christensen. We've got the other movies at the correct runtime, but ROTS ends 10 minutes early and has a few seconds of weird music dubbed into the end credits.

Again, I'm not trying to complain, I'm just really confused here."
,peekowang,2011-08-16T22:56Z,NERD ALERT ^^^^^^^^^
,scroooge,2011-08-19T00:50Z,"Quality is very good, but audio is somewhat out of sync (at least in Ep. V.) Thanks for the upload anyways!"
