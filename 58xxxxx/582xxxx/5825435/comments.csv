,Drummaniac17,2011-08-15T00:21Z,"I've played this game a countless amount of times on the PC (uncut like it's supposed to be) and I've gotta say, this is my favorite Rockstar game. AoF can probably vouch for me when I say the story line is god tier. Even though the general concept is kind of cliche, Rockstar did it perfectly.

I'm downloading this now, I'll come back to say if it works on my 6.39 PRO-B firmware."
,Drummaniac17,2011-08-15T05:17Z,"Well the game is running excellent. Quality rip. I've played quite a bit of this and I haven't run into any problems at all. I'm quite surprised at the quality of the port. It's as if I'm playing it on the PC or PS2. The graphics are barely at all downgraded and it just looks great. I'm also surprised about some of the things they left in (like the dentist chair execution) even with the filters!

tl;dr Great rip, no filters, nothing cut. I recommend downloading it."
