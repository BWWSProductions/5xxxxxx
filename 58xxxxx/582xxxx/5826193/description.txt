NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....The Last Exorcism 2010

Ok first off many thanls to Lkrg for sending us the vobs .....cheers m8ty ;-)
Right source was filmed at a slight angle and had borders at different angles at both sides and bottom....The mainly issue was
the flicker also colours seemed to change throughout the film and was on the dark side.
Audio on source was dd2.0 448 .....still cam audio and pretty decent for cam after the first few secs

Well work done......first decent to strip the audio and encode it to mp3 128 and to leave more room for the video bitrate.
Then it was a case of making a script which inc the normal resize,white balance,brightness,contrast,chroma sharpen.....but we also needed to use
some of vdub plugins,we used the quad filter to allow us to crop at different angles without losing any video and then we used a smoother to reduce
the video noise and a rgb eq filter.
Once done it was a case of remuxing the encoded audio

Now for the flicker.......it's still there and it's not nice ,shame really  Anyway you have been warned and if your unsure grab the sample.....
Oh and yes the screenies will look better,they always do,but they are off this release.

Enjoy ;-)
