,AMER92,2010-09-19T05:31Z,"and imdb is wrong because episode 7 was on the 1st episode 8 came out on the sunday of the VMA's not the 8th of sept so episode 9 did infact air on the 16th
FUCKING MORON!!!"
,word69,2010-09-20T22:43Z,"@ AMER92:

your the fucking idiot...use some common sense.  the show normally airs on thursday nights.  so Ep 7 aired on Sep 9.  Ep 8 would have normally aired on sep 16, but they aired it on sunday sep 12 because of the VMA's.  then MTV re-aired Ep 8 on thursday night sep 16.  so Ep 9 will be aired this thursday sep 23.  again use some common sense before posting...and do some research...its pretty easy nowadays.  IMDB is not always correct"
