,sarahbabe,2010-09-11T12:21Z,"Aren there any references to mo's child bride? You know who I mean,  six year old alisha? Any references to the fact that he was a murderer and a rapist? Why did it take 23 years to write it? Was mo stupid or was it the angels fault? Why are there so many references to death in the book? Why does the sun set in a puddle of mud? If it was written by god, wouldn't god have known better?"
