5.5 years after posting the DVDr i thought it might be time to get around to re-encoding this and uploading a DVDrip... so here you go:


==[rip info]==============

Video Codec: H.264 / AVC (24 fps)
Audio Codec: MPEG-4 AAC @ 159 kbps
Length: 1 hour 29 minutes and 43 seconds

==========================


I looked high and low for this show (in any format) on all sorts of different p2p networks, i found it once (on edonkey) and downloaded about 99.73% and then realized my 6 peers were also stuck at 99.73%  =(  needless to say that download never finished.....

so after almost a year of searching for this, i finally bought it... the quality is ok, not great, but ok.... it looks like the person i bought it from (on ebay) transcoded a VHS tape into a DVD (and even left fuzz/snow at the end of the show)... i can\'t complain since this show is nearly impossible to find!

Enjoy!

(this actually might be a Region Free DVD, you should be able to play it as long as you can play NTSC.... i ripped it using MacTheRipper which is supposed to remove Region Specific Coding from the TS_VIDEO folder - i just havent verified this, so i listed it as Region 1)

from IMDB:

Plot Summary for Freak (1998/I) (TV)
John Leguizamo's semi-falsified, one-man-standup performance as...himself. This is his autobiographical story, about his life growing up, and his journey to try and be accepted by his father. We see this story through a bizzare myriad of characters and situations, which include the eccentric Uncle Sanny, the "Fat Boy Called Bitch"; (John's little brother, Poochie), his mom, his evil grandmothers, and Lee Stratsberg, not to mention a brief appearance by Spike Lee as God Almighty.


==================================

This came from a triple pack which includes John Leguizamo's "Sexaholix", "Mambo Mouth", and a bravo-profile documentary *(mislabled on the dvd as spic-o-rama and yet to be uploaded)

Here are the links for sexaholix and mambo mouth:
