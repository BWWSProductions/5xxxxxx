Low-fat, lower-calorie bulk cooking from bestselling author Deborah Taylor-Hough.
Through the bestselling cookbook Frozen Assets, Deborah Taylor-Hough became known as the "once-a-month" cooking expert. She taught people how to increase time at the family table while decreasing time in the kitchen and drive-thru lanes. She also saved more than $24,000 over a five-year period and taught readers to do the same.

In Frozen Assets Lite and Easy, Taylor-Hough is back with a book of lowfat, lower-calorie meal plans that use the same time-saving and cost-effective methods. Why cook every night when you can cook once a week for seven (or more) delicious, healthy, family-approved meals? Frozen Assets Lite and Easy shows readers how to be healthy while still saving time and money, with shopping lists, recipes, and detailed instruction on how to make freezer cooking work for you...............
