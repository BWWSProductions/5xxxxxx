7/7: Seeds of Deconstruction is a brand new, independent feature-length documentary exploring many of the questions and conspiracy theories about 7/7, the 7th July 2005 London Bombings.

The film places the debate about 7/7 firmly in the context of the history of Western-backed covert operations.  The first half of the film examines three periods from the 20th century: Central America in the 1950s and 1960s(CIA coups in Guatemala and Cuba); Italy during the Cold War (NATO's Operation Gladio); Afghanistan and the Balkans in the 1980s and 1990s (Operation Cyclone and the wars in the former Yugoslavia).  

Though the movie does not explore 9/11 in detail, it functions as a detailed account of false flag terrorism in general, and so speaks to the debate about 9/11 as much as it does to the debate about 7/7.  The second half of the film examines 7/7 in details, and concludes with a lengthy discussion on intelligence and security policy.
