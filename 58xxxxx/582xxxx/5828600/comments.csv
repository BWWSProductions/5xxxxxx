[V],big_dad_e,2010-09-15T02:48Z,"Thanks RobbingHood, works great!  Keygen instructions took a couple attempts, but that's just me.  ;-)"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-15T03:05Z,The keygen may need to be minimized and opened again if it's been covered by another window in order to be displayed correct. 
,KATMANDO22,2010-09-15T06:11Z,"Hello RobbingHood,

I am not very Internet savvy, so thank you for pointing me in the right direction.

Take care.

""VirTool.Win32.Obfuscator.XZ (v)""
nasty one,in the keygen:
after reading allot about it:
its crypt so virus programs does not recognis it."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-11-04T06:27Z,"@kimedu

All the Sunbelt programs at my account are different. Obviously you can't read or are just plain stupid, which would explain why you can't read."
,innocentgee,2010-11-06T13:19Z,Thanks for your comments but let me try it out and verify 
,Sidney01,2010-11-11T09:51Z,"I know it might bee me, but then do help me, as I cant see what I'm not doing right.

I have installed the program, - works fine, but
- when I try to run the KeyGen, my AVG anti virus program warn me, and then remove the icon, without leaving me an option NOT to delete.

I don't know what to do, please help"
,Sidney01,2010-11-11T10:00Z,"Also, - while I'm at it, 

then I don't understand why it is necessary to make these small programs (keygen) so that our anti virus program see them as a tread and delete them.
Is it necessary?"
,Tester174,2010-11-28T13:49Z,"Can I update? Because my updates are disabled and so is my Active Protection, please help!

[V],RobbingHood,2011-06-19T00:56Z,"@micobartek 

What's just sad is you, cause obviously you've got no idea what you're saying at all."
,Cerebral222,2011-06-26T07:35Z,"Excellent upload, I had no problems with this at all, lifetime sub, love it. Cheers RobbingHood, for a nice clean torrent."
,Rumour,2011-07-02T01:29Z,"Can't get the keygen to open. In XP it doesn't respond, and in Win 7 it says a dll is missing. Ironically Count V4 does class it as a highly dangerous, but kaspersky doesn't. What's going on here?"
,Rumour,2011-07-02T02:12Z,"All good. You have to install c++ 2010 (provided) first. I ran the keygen in sandbox (kapersky saferun), and it worked fine. I think counterspy has flagged this keygen as dangerous because they know what it is for. 

Thanks to the uploader :)"
,xxHudsonxx,2012-02-25T16:15Z,Another great Torrent RH thanks man!
