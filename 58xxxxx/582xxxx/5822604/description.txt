On September 14th, Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant will release Band of Joy, the first album from his revived band of the same name. While the original Band of Joy was an experimental blues outfit that ran from 1966 to '68 and featured drummer John Bonham, Plant's new lineup â€” singer Patty Griffin, multi-instrumentalist Darrell Scott, guitarist and co-producer Buddy Miller, drummer Marco Giovino and bassist Byron House â€” have helped him make an album that recalls the intimate, moody vibe of his Grammy-winning collaboration with Alison Krauss, Raising Sand. Band of Joy  features covers of Townes Van Zandt's "Harms Swift Way," the spiritual classic "Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down" and Los Lobos' "Angel Dance" â€” the groovy, rootsy first single.
