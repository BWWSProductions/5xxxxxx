Fourteen year old go racecar enthusiast Marc Benton (Randy Shelly) attempts to raise enough money to buy his own go cart and compete in a local go cart race. Though at first it looks like Marc's dream is a long shot, his goal comes into reach when he befriends kindly track manager Buddy (Priscilla Barnes) and lands a job repairing race-damaged go carts. Over time, with a little help from Buddy, Marc learns that being a true champion takes much more than fast reflexes alone.
