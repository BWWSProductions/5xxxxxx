,Durial,2010-09-14T17:22Z,So you still can't play online? :( sad face 
,assess39,2010-09-14T23:24Z,How do you run this... 
,NanoEntity,2010-09-15T02:35Z,"You need Java installed.

,AnonDeveloper,2010-09-15T03:55Z,"Yes, you can play online, just make sure the server has
online-mode=false
verify-names=false
in the config.
If the server is configured like that, you and anyone who purchased the game can connect and play, just use the name spoofer if you don't have a game account."
,AnonDeveloper,2010-09-15T04:01Z,"Tunngle is not necessary to play with your friends, as long as you each use a different player name.

You still can't join servers that have account protection, which petty much all servers listed on the minecraft site have, but you can join a lan mode server over the internet, and it's not hard to set one up."
,coke192,2010-09-15T17:53Z,"it works great thanks!

,martink123,2010-09-16T22:05Z,ok the minecraft_name starts and works fine but it opens alot of jawaw.exe processes takes alot of cpu
,NanoEntity,2010-09-17T08:12Z,"Close the process with task manager, its easy.

If your CPU cant handle it."
,yui11,2010-09-17T22:14Z,thanks but when i open the launcher and click login it doesn't let click play offline :( help?!? 
,martink123,2010-09-17T23:19Z,"im playing this on lan with my buddy, and monsters dont attack they just follow and we cant kill them either.. and btw is there anyway to save everything u have done on multiplayer like on SP?"
,NanoEntity,2010-09-18T02:25Z,"it should auto save, you can also do save-all on server console

About monsters, there not completely added into the game, blame creator of minecraft.

,UnknownLife,2010-09-19T16:10Z,"I keep getting this error, ""Failed to Launch. Fatal Error occured (5): null. Extracting: lwjgl.jar.lzma to lwjgl.jar"".

I had it working before but It just stopped working for me."
,martink123,2010-09-19T19:03Z,if you have the failed to launch error you need to download the new exe from the site
,NanoEntity,2010-09-20T06:54Z,"Just delete /BIN/ Folder in .minecraft, and game will update.

Then you will be able to use minecraft_name.jar.

alternatively you can download the official EXE.
http://www.minecraft.net/download/Minecraft.exe
or
http://www.minecraft.net/download/Minecraft.exe?v=445"
,NanoEntity,2010-09-20T07:11Z,"@random1283 
The skin is included

.minecraft/bin/skins

you just need to install it into minecraft.jar in bin folder."
,phantom0s,2010-09-20T13:47Z,Can you also have freebuild mode with this version?
,just-khalid,2010-09-20T21:28Z,"nice ( Help i can't play the game evry time it open i get Failed to launch )
nice ( a error said : Fatal error occured (5): null Extracting: lwjgl.jar.lzma to lwjgl.jar )"
,xsexyxian,2010-09-22T06:28Z,"Okay, so I downloaded it an everything, but when I run it and click login and go offline thingy, the bar goes all the way and then a black screen...and nothing happens o.o anyone know why?"
,CrackaJackAttack,2010-09-26T04:14Z,"Hi, I downloaded your 35.71 MiB minecraft file and cant post a comment on that page and i wanted to ask how i could play offline? because when i try and play offline it says i needed to play online once beforehand."
