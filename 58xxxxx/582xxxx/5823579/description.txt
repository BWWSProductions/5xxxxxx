Directed by Edoardo Winspeare, Il Miracolo (The Miracle) centers on Tonio (Claudio D'Agostino), a deeply introspective 12-year-old whose parents are growing apart from one another. While riding his bicycle, Tonio is hit by Cinzia (Stefania Casciaro), a troubled young woman who Tonio glimpses just before falling unconscious. The boy lives through the incident, and though his father encourages him to pursue legal action, Tonio refuses to identify her as the woman who hit him. Instead, he probes her feelings concerning her mother, who had left her to be raised by a contact and tried to re-establish their relationship late in life. Meanwhile, an elderly patient is convinced that Tonio's brush with death left him with miraculous healing powers.
