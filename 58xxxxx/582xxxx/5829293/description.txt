Ok first off thanks to IMAGINE for original files and audio.Now on to what we did this movie
is pretty dark even in the theaters i went to see lol so i know.We used a different filter
this time to brighten the pic.We have been working with this filter for a while and finally
got it dialed in.The dark spots can be seen better than the rest of the release.Not to knock
anyone off cause all the groups do a good job,But you will be able to tell the difference
After cropping and all we needed to upscale since original files where 352x288 and after
cropping it was even smaller.we decided to go with 576x240 pretty big but not to big so the
pic wouldnt look to horrible.Then we did are usuall with the black levels and contrast
saturation and so forth.Hope you all enjoy from team FLAWL3SS Screens From Encode Greetz To 
To All Those That Have Made Us What We Are Today!
