,jackalope77,2010-09-14T18:44Z,"hey Ctang, im afraid i dont know which episodes you mean.  this series is only 2 volumes, 25 episodes altogether.  20 short episodes on volume 1, and 5 long episodes on volume 2.  i dont know of any other material that is part of this series.  can you post a link to show me what you mean?"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-09-14T20:48Z,my lil bro says thank you very much!  that was really fast man.  you are awesome.
,jackalope77,2010-09-14T21:10Z,You're welcome. Enjoy!
,omegafox84,2010-09-14T23:38Z,i think ctang was talking about the original Star Wars trilogy since the movies are labeled as episodes. he probably saw the title Star Wars: Clone Wars and confused it with Star Wars: Attack of the Clones.
[T],ctang,2010-09-16T18:21Z,omegafox: you are correct...that is my mistake
