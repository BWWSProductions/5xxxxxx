Star Wars: Clone Wars Vol. 2 (2005)

This is Volume 2 of the 2D, hand-drawn clone wars series from 2005. This is not the crappy 3D clone wars cartoon that came out recently. George Lucas had nothing to do with this one except signing off the license. If you are like me and you hate the new movies, you will still like this series. Enjoy, and don't forget to SEED!
