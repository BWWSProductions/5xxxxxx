,azrash,2010-09-12T22:07Z,"@kanha personally i use Media Player Classic Home Cinema with CoreAVC 2.0 as the video decoder.

CoreAVC is a paid program, but you can find the torrent in tpb. Google for guide on using CoreAVC with media player classic home cinema, it'll work great, even on laptops

@SterLuMan

,Came12on,2011-09-08T22:22Z,"Wow you made a perfect quality copy then spoiled it with subtitles, why would you put english subs on an english dub."
,hkwar,2011-12-08T20:54Z,"A/V quality on this one is good (subtitles easily disabled), but there is another blu-ray rip with better quality on TPB.  Link is here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5297958/500.Days.Of.Summer.2009.720p.BluRay.x264-WiKi

This one is less than 1gb, whereas the other one is 4.4gb.  Not sure why the difference."
,azrash,2012-01-01T22:44Z,"@Came12on at 2011-09-08 22:22 CET:
it is soft coded, you can easily disable in your player

@hkwar
this is m720p(micro 720p) focused more to low bandwith user, the 4gb one would be closer to blu ray quality, however, for a small size of 665mb, this is the best i could have done"
,DoctaMike,2012-01-23T09:10Z,Very good job mate!
