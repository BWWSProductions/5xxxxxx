Windows Products & Mac Products Aren't Very Compatible. That May Be Why You're Having Problems."
,Nardark,2010-09-27T15:42Z,"I'm not quite getting this stuff. I've done everything you named in the instructions, I burned the ISO file to a DVD, then burned the activation and "" keys "" to a separate CD. But it still won't boot from the DVD, when I restart the computer nothing happends and when I try to boot it just says it ain't compatible with my version of windows. 

You told me before when I tried to upgrade to your "" Windows 7 Professional "" torrent that the problem was with WIndows Vista not being able to upgrade to WIndows 7. 

I run currently on a Windows Vista Home Edition ( 32 bit ) by the way. But I want 64 bit because I have 4 gb RAM

What am I doing wrong?"
,MJKW2Ab,2010-10-01T08:26Z,"ATTENTION ANYBODY HAVING PROBLEMS INSTALLING Windows 7:

Microsoft has a little tool that saved my ass during my install, I do not know any other way I could of installed the Win-7 ISO without this tool:

Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool
http://store.microsoft.com/help/iso-tool

The tool, when run, will ask for the name and location of the ISO and append a self=boot to the beginning. Once the installation got done with pass 1 and rebooted I had to swap Windows 7 install disc (or USB stick) by removing the install with the MS appended boot with the disc made strictly from the ISO. Just maybe this Microsoft tool could help others to install Win-7, especially handy when having problems formatting in anything BUT Fat32 which will not work, or just can not find a method to kick start the install disc. Just remember you will likely need two Windows DVD, the pure one made from the ISO AND the first DVD which will have this Microsoft tool appended to make it boot-able until it reboots and you can swap out the disc for the pure one made from the iso.

Im not sure Microsoft allows one to download this tool more than once, based on how their agreement is written. So be sure to back it up, it may be needed again if needed for the install.

Sorry if I am difficult to understand, as I am very sleepy.

I'll check back here again. Good luck. "
,MJKW2Ab,2010-10-01T08:29Z,"Update: Post Above- This worked for both the 32 bit AND the 64 bit versions of Win-7 on both DVD and USB thumb drives. The download page explain how it works, and it appears the main purpose of this tool is to aid others to instal Windows 7 (legal ones of course)"

What's The Speed On This Download?"
,ghost0308,2010-11-07T14:56Z,"Hello Computer_User...thanks for the upload first of all and although I have not used it (because I'm keeping it in  my set  of CD's/DVD's OS Instalation carry case because I'm an IT Tech and use it to install OS's to customers and also because I did not want to burn it straight away so I could SHARE and SEED with the rest of the world...like EVERYBODY should do!!), the download went pretty fast without a problem and I completely trust your work!!!! However, I have 2 questions please if you can answer when you can:

1: You provided with the d/load a set of Serials for different brands of systems. With this ISO (OS ISO) does it ask for a Serial upon installation?

2: Is the Activator file the same as for Win Vista Ultimate 32bit or do I need to burn the Activator again on a different CD for the x32 version with the x32 d/load?

3: Same question as for question number 2 but in relation to the Activators for Win 7 Ultimate x32 and x64? Can I use the same Activator for ALL versions here and above or for each version do I need to burn, in this case, the 4 different Activators on seperate CD's?

Well, I suppose i made 3 questions instead of 2 but keep up the EXCELENT work and I'm very grateful there are guys like yourself ready to share with us THE WORLD what otherwise would go and make even richer the pockets of those who already are and don't know what to do with so much money (Microsoft, etc). Thanks a lot mate. "
,ghost0308,2010-11-07T14:58Z,...also can I burn the ISO using IMGBurn but slow like x2 or x4? Cheers!!!!
,ghost0308,2010-11-07T16:49Z,"ATENTION ALL USERS!!!! I have just received a Windows Update ""KB892130"" which calls itself the ""Windows Genuine Advantage"" (I did NOT install) and what it says is that it verifies if your copy of Microsoft Software is genuine or not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It also mentions that it checks the state of the validation of your product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It has a size of 1.1MB!

This Windows Update IS NOT related to the ""KB971033"" and it must be a different one that MS uses to check the originality of all the OS.

ATENTION/DISCLAIMER: This Update IS NOT related to the uploads that Computer_User does because I did not even installed any of his Software on my system...it just showed up on my system which at the moment STILL has the original OS installed (XP PRO).

I DO NOT wish to alarm anyone and I might be wrong, and if I am I apologise BUT my native language is English and I know very well what I read about this Windows Update ""KB892130""!!!!

Computer_User or anyone with even more knowledge than me, PLEASE verify the purpose of this Update!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If I'm correct START PASSING THE MESSAGE TO OTHERS QUICKLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

More than this I cannot do but I will wait for feedback on this very page and if true I will help passing the message around...EVERYBODY MUST DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thank you all,

Nope You Don't Need A Product Key For Any Of My Operating Systems :)

The Activation Crack Is The Same For Every Windows 7 & Every Windows Vista Operating System :)

You Can Either Burn The Activation Crack Onto A Sep CD.

Or You Can Just Leave The DVD That The .ISO Was Burned Onto In The DVD-ROM Drive, Because The Activation Crack Is Also Located INSIDE Every .ISO File That I've Released :) :) :)

Go Into ""My Computer""

Right Click On The DVD,

And Click On ""Open""

You Should See It :)

& You Can Burn It With What Ever Your Fav Program Is, I Use Nero Burning Rom For Everything :) It Seems To Burn The .ISO With-Out Any Problem :)"
