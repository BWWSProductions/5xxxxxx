Renowned photojournalist, Tony Davies-Patrick, is one of the WorldÂ¿s most travelled anglers and has searched for big fish in more than 60 different countries. Carp Adventures USA focuses on the wild rivers and lakes between Massena and Niagara Falls in Upstate New York. TonyÂ¿s aim is to bring back the excitement, mystery and pure atmosphere of carp fishing. Watch as he glides silently across tranquil backwaters in a canoe and finds fish in the dense weed beds, then witness the carp suck down crayfish from the surfaceÂ¿followed by explosive action! Be mesmerised by viewing through crystal clear waters as TonyÂ¿s camera captures carp in incredible detail and plunges beneath the lakes and rivers to delve into the carpÂ¿s own world.
