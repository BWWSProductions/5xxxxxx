I downloaded DVD's of NCIS and ripped H.264 MP4 files of each episode. The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using Handbrake with an Apple TV standard so they can be played on any iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes. They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.

For whatever reason dark areas of the original DVD appear slightly red. I also notice this on broadcast episodes and I think this is induced in the production of the show, but is more noticeable on the DVD's. This is not a rip defect.

There are no subtitles or alternate languages.

NCIS, also known as NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service, is an American police procedural drama television series revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which conducts criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.

Originally broadcast between September 28, 2004 and May 24, 2005, the second season shifts away from the naval setting of the show somewhat, and includes more character development than the first season. Season 2 sees Norfolk Case Agent Timothy McGee promoted to full-time field agent, and transferring to NCIS HQ in Washington to work with the Major Case Response Team. Tony DiNozzo nearly died of the pneumonic plague in SWAK while in the season finale, Twilight, Caitlin Todd was shot and killed by Ari Haswari.
