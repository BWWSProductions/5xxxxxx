,JuicyKraken,2010-09-18T12:27Z,"Excellent, thanks for uploading. :)"
,brent825,2010-09-19T03:47Z,"Love it! Doesn't sound like true 320 but it's much better than other versions out there. Howver, iTunes refuses to add it to the library??"
,oceansoflovewi,2010-09-22T10:06Z,"Good quality but DOESNT i repeat DOES NOT work in itunes...itunes doesnt acknowledge it. VERY ANNOYING. Found a 320 file that does tho, so it was THIS file."
,silencesummer,2010-10-02T21:11Z,"Excellent Quality!! I downloaded another one that had more seeders, but the quality (even though the file was large) wasn't that great at high volumes, caused my speakers to crackle; this one is excellent quality.

I looked into the iTunes thing, and it seems the others are telling the truth, it looks like the tag is somehow corrupt, it just doesn't load into iTunes. After importing into MediaMonkey and downloading new tag info (even though the info showed fine on MediaMonkey), it would then import into iTunes. So if you're an iTunes user, you may have to take a minute to fix this to load your library/ipod."

Thanks!"
