In 2006 Andy Partridge, mastermind of thePunk-, New Wave-, Retro-Pop band XTC released a CD-box set called "The Fuzzy Warbles Collectors Album" including all eight albums (volume 1-8) he already preissued separately a short time before.

The complete "Fuzzy Warbles Collection" consists of unreleased tracks or demos, Partridge recorded at his home studio during the Eighties and Nineties.

This is a compilation of the whole set and due to the time limitations for one cd a matter of personal taste with following selection criteria:
- could have been a highlight on each XTC album
- production quality is not too bad
- did not appear in any form on an XTC or DUKES Of STRATOSPHEAR release
