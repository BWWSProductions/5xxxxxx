,zzcook,2010-10-25T21:05Z,Thanks. Works great.
,ReBeLi0uS1,2010-11-05T05:07Z,Virus free & worked good....EASY AS YOUR MOM LMAO!!! Love that one! LOL
,Squirt76,2010-11-26T00:51Z,Serial didn't work...
,Plato202,2011-01-17T14:06Z,The good reviews make me believe that this really DOES remove the Cinavia DRM garbage. I'm not seeing any explicit instructions on how to do this but will DL anyway and hopefully it's sufficiently self-explanatory.
,mgw6969,2011-01-28T16:29Z,"as of 28Jan, the serial is invalid. got a new serial?"
,mgw6969,2011-01-28T16:41Z,"i couldn't get the serial to work, but when i downloaded the same program from blaze69, the serial he provided was exactly the same, yet it worked on that install.  weird! i retract my previous comment that the license doesn't work. i guess it's hit or miss or i dunno"
,woutershome,2011-02-01T18:35Z,No problems at all! I am testing it now. Will seed for a long time if it works! Thanks
,nillbugwtw,2011-04-26T19:33Z,"Serial worked great for me. Great stuff, Jugz!"
,kizza2010,2011-05-16T12:08Z,"Q:""Why -3 guys? Why rate and run fuckers?""
A: Idiots who couldn't figure out how to use the ""crack"" probably"

,no1bladesfan,2011-06-04T16:08Z,reg code worked here too..thx again
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-06-13T13:49Z,"Perfect! Reg worked no problem.... Although I'd advise against installing updates.

Removed my DRM protection from BBC iplayer downloads! Thank you, and +1   :)"

,hybridtpb,2011-08-04T09:06Z,"Works perfect, very useful dl, thanks Jugz!"

Well...

How come this version is 22.055KB, when the original downloaded from http://www.aimersoft.com/video-converter-ultimate.html is only 18.290KB ??

They are both namned: aimer-video-ultimate_full523.exe

Well ??

Suggestion: only download the key.txt file from here, and then download the acutal program from the URL above!

,loltini,2011-10-05T11:33Z,wooohooo!!! worked just as described! :D but im quite hesitant on doing the recommend software update >.> any of you guys have any luck with that?
,movieboy_5280,2012-06-25T23:27Z,"Works Great!  I accidentally had let the older Daniusoft version update to this one and OOPS!
Rather than clean the registry and put the old one back I decided to hunt for the Aimersoft version and found your upload.  

To make it short, I'm happy.  It does more than the old and best of all has a PAUSE function.

Thanks tons for uploading!"
