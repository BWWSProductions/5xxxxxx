You Don't Need A Product Key For Any Of My Operating Systems That I Have Uploaded. But Yes You Can Enter Your Product Key After Installation Is Complete When You Get To The Desktop, Or You Can Just Use The Activation Crack That Comes With The Download :)"

,ghost0308,2010-11-07T16:48Z,"ATENTION ALL USERS!!!! I have just received a Windows Update ""KB892130"" which calls itself the ""Windows Genuine Advantage"" (I did NOT install) and what it says is that it verifies if your copy of Microsoft Software is genuine or not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It also mentions that it checks the state of the validation of your product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It has a size of 1.1MB!

This Windows Update IS NOT related to the ""KB971033"" and it must be a different one that MS uses to check the originality of all the OS.

ATENTION/DISCLAIMER: This Update IS NOT related to the uploads that Computer_User does because I did not even installed any of his Software on my system...it just showed up on my system which at the moment STILL has the original OS installed (XP PRO).

I DO NOT wish to alarm anyone and I might be wrong, and if I am I apologise BUT my native language is English and I know very well what I read about this Windows Update ""KB892130""!!!!

Computer_User or anyone with even more knowledge than me, PLEASE verify the purpose of this Update!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If I'm correct START PASSING THE MESSAGE TO OTHERS QUICKLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

More than this I cannot do but I will wait for feedback on this very page and if true I will help passing the message around...EVERYBODY MUST DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thank you all,

I'm Sorry You Don't Like Windows Vista, But You Did Say You Have Downloaded A Windows XP Disk Didn't You?

,theunc69,2010-12-07T19:13Z,"Just wondering if this version can take online updates from ms, it seems to want online activation, after being activated by your activator, or should I just isolate it from the net and enjoy it. Thanx for your great works. "
,DIABLODG,2010-12-08T10:51Z,"@ theunc69 
Use ""windows loader"" to activate your vista. Just google it, it is in the first page.
This activator is genuine and it updates."

Windows Updates Are Fine With All Of My Operating Systems Bro, If Windows Didn't Activated When You Used The Activation Program, Something Must Have Went Wrong....

You Did Keep The ""Keys"" .Txt Document In The Same Folder As The Activation Program Didn't You? :)"

,DIABLODG,2010-12-21T09:05Z,"Hi Computer-User. I wanted to ask one question:
Can I dual boot xp and vista with xp installed first?
I have 2 drives in xp. Is there any way to have a 3rd drive and install there vista?
Thank you."
,powderedwater67,2010-12-21T16:26Z,I have one question. Does Microsoft truly detect this OS as Genuine Microsoft Software?
,DIABLODG,2010-12-21T20:44Z,"@powderedwater67
If you use the activation included there it will be genuine. I use that activation in my pc for more than 3 months."
,powderedwater67,2010-12-23T07:48Z,"When is the Windows Activation to be used, must it be burned to a separate disc or can I run it after I log on?"
,powderedwater67,2010-12-23T08:02Z,"@DIABLODG   Do you mean to put a third HDD in you computer and install vista on it so you can boot in vista when you want? If so, then I think what you need to do is select the third drive as your target install location when you install vista to your computer."
,DIABLODG,2010-12-23T12:14Z,Thank you but no problem. I already installed vista on (D:) drive and now i have a dual boot: xp and vista.

You dont need to burn the activation anywhere.Just save it on a flash and after the installation paste it to the desktop.
You must use the activator right after the installation of vista."

Yes, I Reccomend Using ""Easy BCD"" :)

""powderedwater67""

I Don't Believe There Is Any Windows Updates For Vista For That ;)

The Activation Program Is Too Be Used After Windows Installation Is Complete. :)
