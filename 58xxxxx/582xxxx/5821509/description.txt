AMG: Adapted from the short story by author EÃ§a de Queiroz, Manoel de Oliveira's poetic drama tells the tale of a beleaguered man named MacÃ¡rio (Ricardo TrÃªpa) who recounts his romantic woes to a patient neighbor (Leonor Silveira) during a train ride to the Algarve. While working as an accountant in Lisbon, MacÃ¡rio became smitten with the radiant blonde whose window he could spy from his modest office. Her name was Luisa (Catarina Wallenstein), but according to MacÃ¡rio's uncle she was well out of the humble accountant's league. Determined to win her love at all costs, MacÃ¡rio retreats to Cape Verde and attempts to earn enough money to be considered an acceptable suitor.
