,zingo_punkbuzter,2010-09-20T23:00Z,"hmm.. mkv is a container, a file that contais another format of data, but what is the original format of the movie? it can't be VOB, i so hppe not it's AVI, but what i do hope it is, is MP4. but if this shows to be 720p on my screen, the size of the movies scares me alot >.> sence KD-releases is about 1.5gb /movie as a high res.."
,Dr-nidO,2010-09-22T07:33Z,"@ RiddlerA: 

m a huge fan of your torrents...
your dedication is commendable and you taking requests is bloody brilliant :)
and you do tv serials too,

one can usually get a ripped movie after a bit of searching but for tv series with great quality and small size, you are THE ONE and ONLY source

i know that you said that you are not doing any more tv series this year but when you get arround to it again can you do the x files series...
there is not a single good torrent for them...
i searched a lot...

keep up the great work buddy

,mikelfann,2010-09-22T21:10Z,"thanks RiddlerA!  it,s like being in a forum in here though!"
,uber_damage,2010-10-10T03:41Z,very good quality. much better than the other ones ive tried. thanks for the education on mkv. good to see someone is trying to give back to the community.
,yelloo,2010-10-11T11:06Z,Thanks RiddlerA.
,murrambingi,2010-10-12T18:11Z,"I use MKVmerge myself, and seeing the SRT files with the MKV files makes me think that you have subtitles or txt you have added, thx 4 the upload, i am sure it will be of good quality."
,murrambingi,2010-10-14T13:44Z,"umm there were subtitles built into the MKV files as well as having seperate SRT(subtitles) files, I had to actually use MKVmerge to remove them from the MKV files, because when i was watching the movies(MKV files) that i burned to DVD I couldn't turn the subtitles off, anyways the quality of both audio and video are flawless 10/10 thx 4 the upload.  :)"
,rock1377,2010-10-15T09:06Z,"Best prints. cheers Riddler.
Beyond all their size makes them appreciable. "

[T],Oceanhawk,2010-10-26T15:56Z,Noob here. I've finished downloading but i cant see any video. The sound is there but the screen is blank. VCL player only plays the sound and no video. What am i doing wrong guys? please help. Also if i wanted to burn video file that plays with VCL player is that possible?
[T],Oceanhawk,2010-10-26T17:00Z,"Sorry, its been fixed now. I followed your advice you gave on another site about installing Combined Codec Pack and it worked. Thanks. PS: my other questions is still unanswered, How can i burn these movies to a disk? Thanks again RiddlerA. "
,rathspawn,2010-11-04T03:46Z,"Thanks for the upload, but the compression really degrades the HD quality here.

This rip is decent quality, BUT doesn't compare to other 720p bluray rips which are ~4 gigs. 

If you use a small monitor, it's not noticeable, but on a larger screen, this looks fuzzy (think 700 MB .avi)."
,wezaz,2010-11-04T12:36Z,"@Riddlera........

,nyarf13,2010-11-18T13:49Z,excellent quality. small size. it's true you're the best. thanks a lot!

,sole420,2010-12-10T12:45Z,"great quality as usual from RiddlerA.  I just need to figure out how to remove the subtitles, I thought simply deleting the .srt files would do - but no..."
,Phatfish,2010-12-22T23:06Z,Three hi-res movies in just 1.56gb ?! How the fuck is that possible. Well downloading now I we will see...

,BrokenEmpires,2011-01-15T03:17Z,"LMAO at this whole torrent. I commend you for sharing. For that you are in honor.
But, The Matrix squeezed into 550MB file should be against the law.
Come on, at least if 480p is all you need, at least get the 1.3GB version. smh. Man honestly just download the 720p version, think of it as a high quality dvd version almost. smh 550MB? smh."

,yopepoy,2011-03-23T18:58Z,the quality is good specially it's size. but this is not truly HD. a true HD is higher than 2mbps depends on encoding.

,thedeadserv,2011-07-04T03:26Z,"I'm sorry but this is terrible.
I mean you DO have the image size of the video on 720p, but what's the use if the image quality itself is worse than shit...?

This came out worse than an upscale from a DVDrip would.

I do appreciate the sharing of course, and thank you for that!"
,yoashmo,2011-07-04T06:39Z,"im very appreciative of your effort, but this seriously gives me a headache. its too fuzzy"
