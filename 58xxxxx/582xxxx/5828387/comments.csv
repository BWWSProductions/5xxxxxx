[V],VLiS,2010-09-14T14:01Z,"1. The English subtitles i have included are OPTIONAL. You can disable them in your player or just delete the .srt file.

2. The entire movie dialogue is in English. 
IMDB lists Italian, Yiddish and whatever else as secondary languages because of some words used in the movie and not entire dialogue."
,supz,2010-09-15T02:13Z,Excellent.  That's good to know.  I'm often angered by subs when there are about 3 or 4 lines in a movie that are not english with english subs the entire way through.  Cheers for the upload.  Will seed for a while.
