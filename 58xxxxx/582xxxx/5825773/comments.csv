let me give you one free advice. if you ever faced a misunderstanding be polite, you will never be able to solve anything this way instead ruined it.

You have rated a -1 to show your anger.
I never expected this from you.


If that is your problem,

Ask 3Li to write a comment that you will be uploading in his behalf, Then i will quit uploading his release.


I am not doing any thing against TPB rules, All i am doing is sharing."
