Hong Kong's top comedy filmmaker Lee Lik Chi is back in the director's chair, helming the long-awaited follow-up to his classic laughfest Flirting Scholar, the 1993 Stephen Chow blockbuster that grossed over HK$40 million at the box office. Since Chow was not available for a second outing, the over-the-top action comedy cast popular actor Huang Xiaoming as a younger and perhaps, in a way, more comical Tong Bak Fu. Huang leads a stellar cast that includes acclaimed actress Zhang Jingchu, Taiwan star Richie Jen, Mainland comedian Zhou Libo, as well as returning cast members Nat Chan, Kingdom Yuen, Joey Leung, Mimi Chu, and Stephen Chow regulars Lam Tze Chung and Tin Kai Man.

In the prequel to Flirting Scholar, Tong Bak Fu (Huang Xiaoming) and his poetically vulgar buddies Tsui Ching Hing (Richie Jen), Chuk Chi Shan (Nat Chan), and Man Ching Ming (Zhou Libo) - known collectively as the "Four Bad Boys" - get into troubles wherever they go. Tong's mother decides to send him to a famous boarding school to study, and makes him swear never to use his extraordinary kung fu skills again. Thinking that it means freedom for him, Tong happily obliges. Once there, he falls instantly for the gorgeous Cin Cin (Zhang Jingchu), unaware of the mysterious events that await him...
