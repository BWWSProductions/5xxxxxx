                    Acclaimed filmmaker Shane Meadows makes his  
                    televisual debut with the much-anticipated  
                    follow-up to his BAFTA award-winning film, This  
                    Is England - set in 1983 and in which    
                    13-year-old Shaun found escape from bullying at  
                    school when a gang of skinheads, led by the  
                    affable Woody, made him part of their 'family'.  
                    But now it's 1986: Maradona's hand ruins  
                    England's world cup dreams in Mexico; Top Gun  
                    is the highest grossing film; and over 3.4  
                    million Brits are unemployed. It's also the  
                    year Shaun leaves school. On his own again  
                    after the gang's disintegration, following  
                    Combo's terrifying acts of violence, Shaun  
                    celebrates his last day of school, and the  
                    first of an uncertain future, by sharing an egg  
                    sandwich with his Mum.
