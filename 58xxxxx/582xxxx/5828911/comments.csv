Very good copy Thanks A LOT!!
Movie was great!"
,qbiggums,2010-09-17T04:05Z,kind of wish they let the guys who made justice league do the animation
,snapshot88,2010-09-17T04:30Z,"very gay, time to grow up folks."
,sentient1,2010-09-17T04:49Z,"Cant thank you enough Sir.

But Thanks non the less."
,AOWSTYLE,2010-09-18T14:44Z,"This was great, I loved it thanks .BONE. audio 10 - video 10. Perfect DVD rip."
,imakewebs,2010-09-18T15:40Z,"Awesome movie. Batman wasn't really on the radar, but the scenes he had were good. This is more for Superman fans. But if you have an HD television, the rating of this video is as follows:
A= 9
V= 7

It's a little less than DVD quality.
I wish Superman would actually KILL someone. But, again, he wouldn't be Superman would he?"
,Archangeldawn,2010-09-18T18:10Z,"thanks for uploading this, it was awesome!!
A: 10
V: 10

  Batman is such a badass, I was impressed the extents he will go to make up for his lack of super-powers. 
qbiggums , I'm glad they didn't do the JLA animation, I think this style was of animation was superb! "
,RA3EALMSHAKL,2010-09-18T23:42Z,"A - 10
V - 10

Thanks =D"
,Humvee H2,2010-09-19T07:52Z,"Thanks really enjoyed this movie. I like watchin batman and superman in animation, really enjoyed the story line too. Whoever comes up with this kind of shit is rhe best.  The grahics is mean or awesome, sends me on a trip.  Thanks for the upload man"
,ramkvp,2010-09-19T14:19Z,"great audio and video quality.thanks for the torrent buddy.

,linxangel,2010-09-20T18:51Z,THANKS :D ! THIS looks awesome and I can't wait to watch it.
,Luzzu,2010-09-22T22:28Z,"How can adults watch this? I mean ok, I understand how this could be entertaining for 10 year olds, but seriously. As Snapshot said, time to grow up folks."
,Smackerz,2010-09-23T12:01Z,"@Luzzu 

This movie isn't really aimed at 10 year olds. It's a pretty good family movie TBH."
,EpicFaze,2010-09-24T20:40Z,"Really good seeding, 1Â˝ Mb/s (1500 Kb/s) currently"

,seirios7,2010-09-29T22:32Z,very good!!1
,imakewebs,2010-09-30T05:54Z,"@Luzzu, it's funny how people always criticize older ones for watching animated movies or even playing video games.  However, all such critics fail to realize that the individuals actually making these movies and video games are OUR GENERATION-- the 30 and 40 year olds."

,word304,2010-10-04T01:25Z,"Everyone is entitled to choose whatever the hell they watch (as long as it's not harmful to others) -> it's called free will.

Everyone also has the ability to claim they know what people should / shouldn't watch but only show they're arrogant as hell by doing so.

I'm 29 years old. I have always liked watching cartoons and still enjoy them now. Fuck anyone and everyone whose bold enough to judge me and got a problem with that.

Snapshot and Luzzu - Is that ""grown up"" enough for you?"
,ADaemonIsBorn,2010-10-04T18:14Z,Lame movie.
,HOAXER84,2010-10-05T22:50Z,"zero seeder n leechers why??????

others facing this problem to or its something wrong on my side

almost a week now i m facing the same problem i have never faced this problem before

can someone help me out"
,superleech,2010-10-06T03:32Z,"Fuck u snapshot88 and Luzzu, your both a couple of retards. In my opinion this movie was better than Superman Returns and both Batman Begins and Dark Knight. I usually ignore wankers like you, but after watching this movie, I had to come back and say this is a definite must see. No way in hell you can get this much action in a non animated movie. Thnx .BONE. Btw if this came out in theaters, I'd pre-order tickets, especially if it was in 3D."
,physixmaster,2010-10-07T04:23Z,Who cares what generation its aimed at. Save your sanctimonious crap for youtube.
,mccoy77,2010-10-09T02:55Z,"Napintas daytuy nga cartoon. Much better fight scenes than the usual superman power punches. I believe the animators had some influence from japanese anime fight scenes from dragonball. To those who think adults watching cartoons are childish, try making one."
,somedude.1001,2010-10-11T15:57Z,Good animation but holy fsm the storyline and some action scenes are dumb. And this is coming from a fan of cartoon.
,d.v,2010-10-13T20:20Z,"I'm 33 and I watch animated movies all the time. Especially Japanese ones. All those girls and tentacles...
:D"
,Schizoman,2010-10-15T20:59Z,Amazing movie... sometimes DC does better with their animation than their live action.
,DuUkE,2010-10-21T22:45Z,"Cartoons and games use to be for kids long time ago, 20+ years ago.  Nowdays there is no such thing.  I know ALOT of gamers that are 30+ year olds, we live in different day and age, if you think cartoons and games are for kids then maybe you need to stop living in the past and look around, WE'RE IN THE 21st CENTURY!"
,rssekhon,2010-11-15T14:26Z,add some screen shots
,mikejnr,2011-01-30T22:23Z,"snapshot88 and luzzu, who the fuck do you think you guys are? You're saying that this is for youngers, after you're on this torrent yourselves. you guys need to fucking get a grip becuse you guys are acting like kidz. us people get to choose whatever the fuck we want to watch, don't you do that when you got to the cinema? especially you Snapshot88, FUCK OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND THAT INCLUDES YOU, LUZZU!!!!!"
,vipernickle99,2011-09-18T18:55Z,"thanks bone keep up the good work....
to all those ""adults"" maybe you should watch more cartoons because i think if more people did we wouldnt have so many problems lol "
,Pirat34Life,2011-12-01T12:12Z,"This is my first ever comment and after years here on tpb i just wanted to say a huge Mahalo from my Ohana to .Bone for such a wonderful job you've done for all us pirates and mostly for my family!
