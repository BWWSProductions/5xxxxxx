,thewoodishard,2010-09-19T16:35Z,"I had trouble playing this on standalone bluray player in mkv, would not load in tsmuxer, played ok on pc. I fixed it by loading it into mkv merge and deleting the subs and chapter file and it played ok on my Sony bdps370, i think the problem was the chapter file but not sure as i deleted the subs as well, I play them in mkv on disc as my player will do this. hope this helps other downloaders. the quality and sound are perfect. thanks for the upload NLUBBER002.
