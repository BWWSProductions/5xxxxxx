The big difference between this version and the others,

This is AVCHD others are MKV.
This version is 1920-1080 others are 1920-816.
Because the mode 1920-1080 this version is a bit better, but its AVCHD, so be sure u can play that."

,TheChosen1_,2010-09-10T21:14Z,"Thx for the information NLUPPER.But there is something I want to ask you too.Whats the difference between AVCHD and mkv?Just size or what else?

And btw I have downloaded 3 posts of urs.2 of them were pretty good.But 1 of them (was a .rar file) was empty.I search inside of the rar file again and again but there was nothing there and I deleted that cuz I had to.

Still, thx for this upload..."
,pomapoma,2010-09-12T05:24Z,its an iso. file how do i get it to play with vlc? 
,blinddope,2010-09-15T17:23Z,@pomapoma you need something like powerISO to mount it on to a virtual drive then you play it off the virtual drive
,garbagedrew,2011-05-01T19:34Z,"This is NOT a better version than the (1920x816) version.  It is the same, if not inferior.  This version has the black bars for letterbox hard encoded into the video which is actually really annoying and that is why it says it is the full 1920x1080.  Also, it isn't often, but the texted language on the screen isn't English, like when they are showing the name of a location.  The quality of the video is okay, but it could be better since there are wasted bits being used to encode the black bars instead of using that data to encode that actual picture portion of the film. I'm going to have to download a different version now."
