I don't usually doubt green skulls but anyway...is it HIGH QUALITY or SHIT?"
,rabid0,2010-09-10T22:40Z,"usually it's 23,976f , something to think about.
Quality is another thing.."
,sgnukie,2010-09-11T00:06Z,"The quality for this sucks. It's not even DVD quality.

Go for this instead: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5823244/_The_Expendables_2010_720p_Bluray_x264-TDM_

Should be much better. "

I can't testify to the quality of this release but I can confidently say that the TDM release that you point to is terrible!"
,benqs41,2010-09-16T16:17Z,some screenshots should be fine...
