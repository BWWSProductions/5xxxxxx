How is this? Didn't it air as it should have?"
,Double_O7,2010-09-14T02:04Z,"amazing quality for rip this size. in fact it's just as good as the 350Mb rips. atleast in video quality. perhaps i'm not the right person to rate audio since i have only 2.1 system on my desktop, but the audio was clear and good in this setup. thank you 2040!"

@windmark: You DO realize that torrent was upped at early morning (7 AM LA time)?
And I am sure that my torrent never would be the first one up.

@Double_O7: Thanks. For years it is simple Love-Hate thing. It looks pretty ugly on big-ass screen with face in front of it... However, it looks spectacular on 17-19"" CRT monitors or TV sets, not to mention ipods and clones, PS and Xbox and so on.

People who need small fast download (I can serve one full episode in 1.2 seconds) and especially ones on tight budget - are delighted. BTW, requirements for best playback are mentioned in descriptions of my torrents at least once per day."
