,paltost,2010-09-11T00:57Z,Hello Jykaman and sorry for this irrelevant with Scary Movie 1 comment. We are a lot of folks stucked on 97.3% almost 2 months now on Death Wish (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4651210/Death_Wish_(1974)) that you have uploaded. Can you seed a little until one of us reaches 100%? Thanks a lot!

And this is the point for everybody: don't run away when you get these movies (or any other torrents), but SEEEEEEEEEEEED!!!!!!!!!"
