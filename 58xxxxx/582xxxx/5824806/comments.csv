Extract all files to a single folder and then try installing from the extracted files which will still be rar files

,Kalypso88,2010-11-06T18:37Z,Is this working with win7x64?
,kujirasan,2011-05-28T06:00Z,"Kalypso88.
I installed it on Windows 7, ultimate, as Administrator , and it works.
To Install:
1.Copy and paste the license file into license folder, in the mapl14 directory, 
2.Copy and past   maple.dll, in the folder bin.X86_64_WINDOWS
I extracted the rar files on Linux, then extract the ISO files on Windows7, this person seems to do duel compression, ISO followed by rar."
,Nadeem77,2012-05-31T19:25Z,"Hi,
I am doing this for the first time and dont get much about these file types. So, I downloaded torrent. Then there is this folder which has many compressed folders. I extracted files from them to a new folder which gives me like just tbe.rar,tbe.r77 and tbe.rO3. When I click them, it says windows need to know wat program u want to use to open it. What do I do?"
