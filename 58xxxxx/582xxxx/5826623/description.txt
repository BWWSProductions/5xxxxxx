Recorded in 1970-71 at the same time that The Move was also laying down tracks for 
the first Electric Light Orchestra  album [and even during some of the same sessions] 
there are inevitably some similarities in style between the two albums, especially 
the heavy use of "tracking up" (overdubbing) to capture all of the instruments being 
played by Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne. Nevertheless, Wood and Lynne were determined to 
maintain some differentiation between the sound of their two groups 
[for example, by confining Wood's saxes to Message and Wood's cellos to the ELO debut]

The Move was also responsible for the cover, as the painting 
was done by Roy Wood, based on an idea by Jeff Lynne.


The Move, from Birmingham, England, were one of the leading British rock bands of the
1960s. They scored nine Top 20 UK singles in five years, but were among the most
popular British bands not to find any success in the United States.

Although bassist-vocalist Chris "Ace" Kefford was the original leader, for most of their
career The Move was led by guitarist, singer and songwriter Roy Wood. He composed
all the group's UK singles and, from 1968, also sang lead vocals on many songs,
although Carl Wayne was the main lead singer up to 1970.

The group evolved from several mid 1960s Birmingham based groups, including Carl
Wayne and the Vikings, the Nightriders and the Mayfair Set. The group's name referred
to the move various members of these bands made to form the group. Beside Wood,
the original five-piece line-up of The Move in 1965 was drummer Bev Bevan, bassist
Kefford, vocalist Carl Wayne and guitarist Trevor Burton. The final line-up of 1972 was
the trio of Wood, Bevan and Jeff Lynne, who transitioned the group into the Electric
Light Orchestra.



Digitally remastered expanded edition of the final Move album that included Bev Bevan,
Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne, who would eventually disband the group to form Electric

later in the decade. This edition is released in celebration of the 35th Anniversary of the
group's signing to EMI Records. Includes the hidden track "My Marge" [Alt Version] at
the end of the 17th chapter.
