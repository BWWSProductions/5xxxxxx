    Doctor Who returns to the Proms with a new show hosted     
    by the stars of the series - Karen Gillan (aka the        
    Doctor's companion Amy Pond), Arthur Darvill (aka Rory   
    Williams) and featuring a special guest appearance by     
    Matt Smith (aka the Doctor).

    television series, including his latest re-imagining of   
    Ron Grainier's classic theme tune performed by the BBC     
    National Orchestra of Wales, the London Philharmonic      
    Choir, soloists Yamit Mamo and Mark Chambers, and        
    conducted by Ben Foster.                                  
                                                               
    With exclusive behind-the-scenes access, and some
