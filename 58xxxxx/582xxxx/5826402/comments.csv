Good quality.

What a terrible movie though!  Seriously, if you're DLing and hoping for a decent Jackie Chan movie, or even a poor one, think again.  He hardly appears in this film which, far from being action-packed, is the story of a young Chinese kid living in Indonesia, who sets out to find his life-long idol (JC).  It's cheesey, non-eventful and boring.  But if you're open to watching just about any old trash, or want this movie to sell on, fair enough."
