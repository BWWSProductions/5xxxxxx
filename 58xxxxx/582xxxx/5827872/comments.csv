There is indeed a large folder with a bunch of other torrents, but most importantly the mkv files are there.

However if people could seed a bit more that would be perfect. There is a lot of seeders & leechers, but still the speed is very irregular and really slow, and since I can't wait to watch that season, I'd be glad if you could seed a little bit more !"

Please consider keeping the full name of the files I mean the release groups, which make it easier to search for their subtitles."

can you suggest the link of subs that match your episode files?"
