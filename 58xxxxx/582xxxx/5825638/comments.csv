also seed dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets you upload eg a 50mb download service probably has a 1.5mb upload speed, the faster you upload the faster you download thats how bittorent works.

""the faster you upload the faster you download thats how bittorent works"" THAT IS BULLOCKS if you seed at the max upstream your connection allows for you get NO downstream thats the way broadband works.
