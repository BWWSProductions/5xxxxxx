Summary:
Tony Stark is the complete playboy who also happens to be an engineering genius.
While in Afghanistan demonstrating a new missile he's captured and wounded.
His captors want him to assemble a missile for them but instead he creates
an armored suit and a means to prevent his death from the shrapnel left in
his chest by the attack. He uses the armored suit to escape. Back in the U.S.
he announces his company will cease making weapons and he begins work on an
updated armored suit only to find that Obadiah Stane, his second in command
at Stark industries has been selling Stark weapons to the insurgents. He uses
his new suit to return to Afghanistan to destroy the arms and then to stop
Stane from misusing his research.
