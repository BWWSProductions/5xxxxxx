Visit: http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/resources.aspx and pick your version to suit your operating system. ITS LIGHT AND FAST.

ITS UP TO YOU, YOU MAY STILL PREFER OTHER SOURCES!"

,Angus42,2011-10-30T19:25Z,"When I run the NTR on this, after restarting the computer you can't open the program the icon just kind of sits there and you get a warning that you have no virus program installed. If you don't run the NTR it works fine but you get these very annoying popups all the time :/"
