"It's 2010 and Drum & Bass has officially broken out from its Underground routes and exploded into the mainstream, this Album serves as an introduction for those who have recently got into the scene, and a collectable item for those who've been in to it from the beginning. "Anthology" is a definitive history covering the period from 1993 right up to the cutting edge of 2010."
