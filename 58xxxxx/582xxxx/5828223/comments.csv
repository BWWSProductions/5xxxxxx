,zlennyk,2010-09-15T03:57Z,can't unzip this file
,ddd222,2010-09-15T06:09Z,"Well, ziennyk, it is a pdf file... so you need a pdf ""reader"" (adobe reader)...  I hope it is not another reason..."
,Tribsaint,2010-09-16T21:06Z,"Hey not trying to rain on your parade, but these arenâ€™t the greatest thing. First off find a artist, the drawing were sub par on every level. The ones in French where not bad and easily the best in the PDF. If you can't have all the pages up to this level your simply not ready to present your work. Robert Kirkmen and other big comic book artists and writers (and yes I know the big 3 are not the publishers your looking for) have said numerous times that companies donâ€™t but ideas, scripts or sketches from unknowns, they buy comics. That means well written, drawn, and ready to publish.  The writing was ok, kinda what I would expect in a porno comic, as porn movie are usual a lesser imitation of regular movies, I thought this was a lesser imitation of a mainstream comic. What was the last well written porn comic?  Convent of hell, some of Jabs stuff (other things of his not so much) Rebeccaâ€™s hot momsâ€¦all of these are good porn comics that have some story but are also sexually over whelming. First and foremost it got to make me want to beat off to it, then after I dropped a load, Iâ€™ll read it, that is what all the above comic did and your presentation did not do. Porn even comic is for arousal frist reading second. Now that said as a writer you understand itâ€™s a process, and these works can be refined, so donâ€™t give up, just keep working. The blundery character is an interesting ideal, but it felt like your first try, keep the stuff that works (and expand it) and cut the stuff thatâ€™s filler, remember what Hemmingway said â€œyou have to kill your darlingsâ€  "

If I may say one thing or two...

My objective is absolutely not to realize myself the drawings of these series.  What I propose is SUBJECTS and STORIES.  If I did sketches in my presentation, it is only to be understandable and ""descriptive""...  I need to form team(s) with artist(s) and I am in search of good ones : I expect from ""them"" to realize all aspects of the art-work, creating something attractive, and not necessarily a copy of my scripts...

I see this kind of team this way :
1- the artist doesn't have to care about stories, ideas, etc., and he has a lot of hints for page settings and content.
2- the writer (me) has to provide stories over and over (I have a ""vision"" of what I want to do and believe me I am ready to produce).

So I hope to find a way to reach good artists...  I don't really know how to join them - and nearly impossible for me to go to a comics convention...

If someone have ideas about that... just tell me.  Example : websites to show my project, etc...

Anyway, tribsaint, many thanks!"
,Tribsaint,2010-09-17T02:21Z,"Well my suggestion, is this:  My writing partner and I wrote a script for a horror movie, the ideal of having the script made into a comic was suggested (it would make it easier to present and comics can be very cinematic). We didnâ€™t go through with it but the artist we had lined up and talked to for the job came from two places, craigslist (try the artist section) and a local college. Now approaching some one to work on erotic material can be tricky, and you are going to have to either pay them or make a contract to cut them in on the profit (meaning partial rights to the intellectual properties or something of that order) when and if the comic is bought for publishing. The paying for a â€œmaybeâ€ is a hard choice but ultimately one asks how much you believe in the material. The same way you want to break into writing, is the same way artists want to break into comics, convincing them shouldnâ€™t be to hard as many main steam comic writers (alan moore) and artist have done erotica, and many artist who started out doing erotic and are now mainstream (crumb). The right artist brings a lot to the table and makes a writer better. Good luck â€¦.but the way I personal think convention would be the worst place to find and artist and a publisher. "
,ddd222,2010-09-21T22:37Z,"Many thanks, Tribsaint.  And I pretend that a writer can make an artist better...  That's the meaning of the word ""team""...  Erotic comics are not always something fun to read... characters and attitudes are, more or less, always the same from series to series...  I pretend to do something different.....-)"
