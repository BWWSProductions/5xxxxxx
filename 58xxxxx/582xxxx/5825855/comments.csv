,NanoEntity,2010-09-12T06:40Z,Virus dont download!
,ReaperOne1Two2,2010-09-12T06:47Z,Pretty sure it's not a virus he just removed the custom textures you had in your torrent NanoEntity. As he posted.
,ReaperOne1Two2,2010-09-12T06:48Z,"@NanoEntity
Pretty sure it's not a virus he just removed the custom textures and server seeing as you leeched your torrent directly from 4chan that has them."
,Renegade78,2010-09-12T06:54Z,"lol, ^ he's just saying that because he decided to impose his own custom textures on the torrent he uploaded to force his tastes on other people and I tweaked it back to the defaults.

There's no virus, scan it if you want."
,Renegade78,2010-09-12T07:11Z,Why are the comments not loading? TPB is really buggy today.
,ReaperOne1Two2,2010-09-12T08:21Z,No clue. It does it for me all the time. Also multiplayer still works for this game. I may make a new tutorial with how to do minecraft multiplayer on this version with better instructions/pics also. Also in order to play online now you have to use my old steps but on the server folder use an singleplayer map on multiplayer in order to get it to work now.
,aaronfoo,2010-09-12T10:35Z,"please post the steps to tweak everything back to default, thanks in advance!"
,joostwie,2010-09-12T11:16Z,"Seeding, thanks for the upload"
,lauriraudla,2010-09-12T14:28Z,tyvm works perfectly and nonaEntity was wrong. this is virus free!
,lauriraudla,2010-09-12T14:29Z,Nano
,Renegade78,2010-09-12T16:04Z,"@aaronfoo
Everything in this torrent is default. It's the other one (Nano's) with custom textures."
,Bealo,2010-09-12T16:45Z,What account do you use?
,Bealo,2010-09-12T16:53Z,How do i have a premium account?
,krtshv,2010-09-12T17:43Z,Seed please :(. It got to 40.7% and all the trackers just died.
,emeegee,2010-09-12T20:00Z,"how do you get multiplayer to work I couldn't get it to work in the last one so if you would make a tutorial reaper12 it would be very helpful

minecraft is a great game!!!"
,NanoEntity,2010-09-13T00:08Z,"As I have posted here.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5825766

You cant play on retail servers, because you need real account.

You can only play on cracked servers that are especially configured for LAN.

I posted the server in my torrent, if you set everything right it should work."
,Dr.rofl,2010-09-13T06:44Z,"If i download this version will i still be able to play in my save from the previous version? 

Thanks"
,Arthonis,2010-09-13T09:00Z,"Hello, im sorry if this might be stupid but I've put the folder in my Add. Data Folder and opened it and tried to click the Minecraft icon and nothing happens... then I try to open the Minecraft.jar thats inside the Bin folder thinking that might be it but nothing goes -_o... if anyone has any idea what my problem might be it would be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance."
,The_Pastmaster,2010-09-13T16:20Z,@Arthonis: Put the (Notice the dot) .Minecraft in the App Data folder. That has to be directly in the App Data. App Data/.Minecraft. Not App Data/X/.Minecraft but App Data/.Minecraft
,The_Pastmaster,2010-09-13T16:22Z,DAMMIT! I meant App Data/Roaming/.Minecraft
,lauriraudla,2010-09-13T16:42Z,"@Dr.rolf

@krtshv

,Arthonis,2010-09-13T20:58Z,@The_Pastmaster Thanks for the help but im using Windows XP and I dont have a roaming folder in the AppData one... and I did have the dot before Minecraft I pretty much just put the torrent file in there... anyway Thank you. : P
[T],FatFreddy756,2010-09-13T23:35Z,It works for me 100%. Thanks a lot buddy! This game is ridiculously addicting. Who needs anything else when you have MineCraft. haha
,Dr.rofl,2010-09-14T00:45Z,Thanks Lauri :)
,Tristen323,2010-09-14T05:38Z,Hey I just downloaded it and put it in the application directory. Then I started it up but it said that i couldnt play offline because i need to play online at least once before. Anybody know how to get past this?
,Tristen323,2010-09-14T06:08Z,Ok ignore my last comment i found out a way to press the play offline button. turns out i was missing some files. But now i have a new problem. Everytime i start it it closes and gives me a java error message. Its called hs_err_pid140.log in case anybody has come across this before. In it it says that a fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment: Can anybody help?
,Renegade78,2010-09-14T08:00Z,"@Tristen
Upgrading to the latest Java release will probably fix your problem."
,lolzzznub,2010-09-14T11:04Z,Ok i have the same problem as tristen Could somebody please help???
,lolzzznub,2010-09-15T10:29Z,@tristen
,lolzzznub,2010-09-15T10:30Z,@tristen how did you fix the login failed problem?
,The_Pastmaster,2010-09-16T15:48Z,"*Sigh* Kay, the installation is REALLY easy so here goes. 
1. Move the .Minecraft folder to the proper folder (See above)
2. Start with the Minecraft.exe
3. Click Log In with NO DETAILS WHAT SO EVER
4. At the error message click the Play Off-Line.
5. Select a World Slot and voilÄ‚ !
Happy mining"
,The_Pastmaster,2010-09-16T15:53Z,"@Arthonis: Kay. But my point still stands.
On XP, if it is anything other then Application Data/.Minecraft the game will fail. Even if you put it in another folder inside Application Data. And I gather from what you said that you put it like Application Data/Minecraft Alpha 1.1.0/.Minecraft
That WILL fail. I had a fried who did the same mistake. "
,thegreatcerebral,2010-09-17T18:28Z,"Ok to those XP users who say they don't have an application data folder...   the folder may be hidden.  Change your settings to view hidden folders and files.

I am having a problem with the game (on vista here) where it is not ""dropping stone""????

Anyone have that issue?"

,Sora7639,2010-09-19T00:34Z,"Ok, so this might be a bad comment, but I'm still having problems. I've done all that you said, put it in AppData, but every time it try running it, it says ""Could not create the Java Virtual Machine."" Any help here?"
,bakkerboy465,2010-09-19T02:22Z,"ok so i dl'ed the torrent, moved .minecraft to appdata/roaming, then open the game, press login with no details... and then it says ""fatal error occured (5): Null Extracting lwjgl.jar.lzma to lwjgl.jar"" what do?"
