We the ""internet people"" have the knowledge, and therefore the power. Ideological ranting aside, I'm an IT dude and know a thing about IP addresses and networks - the only way the Trackers can track us is from our IP address. If you run PeerBlock, PeerBlock will drop packets/connections from all the dodgy ""tracker"" dudes out there. I'm guessing its 99% effective.

And on a personal note, does anyone feel bad for ""stealing"" this shit? I mean, my sister would probably PAY 20k to have a leading actress role on a TV show, she would probably suck but thats not the point haha. These hard up actors and artists are doing what they love and complaining they don't get paid for it. I'll start a shitty band and you all need to pay me my dues ..! Fuck the media cartels.

Thats my two cents for what its worth biaches, I just hate seeing poeple like l4690 getting scared into submission by some folks with money."
