NOTES! Thanks to Relizlab for video source and many thx to REViVE for the audio source
wich i work a little bit on the sound & volume. I make the files much smaller without damaging the quality of the movie, and smaller files means faster downloading.
Works with all DVD Players and Compatible > PS3 & XBOX 360.
