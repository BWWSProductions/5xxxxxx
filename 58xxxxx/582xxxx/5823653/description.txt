It's Friday, ya bastids!

Well, if youâ€™re planning on attending tomorrowâ€™s big Quran burning, you better check before you load up the car with Qurans and kerosene. Nobody seems to know exactly whatâ€™s going on. The best guess now is that Pastor Jones will spend 9/11 standing over a pile of Qurans with a Zippo lighter in his hand. What happened? I think Pastor Terry Jones is a guy who is used to having followers who believe him, even if he says the sky is green. Now heâ€™s standing in front of cameras saying the sky is green, and the real world isnâ€™t buying it. Well Pastor, thatâ€™s what happens when you try to expand your sphere of influence beyond 40 or 50 lunatics. There were a lot of twists in the story yesterday, which is what you expect dealing with someone as twisted as Terry Jones. He said they had a deal to cancel the Quran burning if the so-called Ground Zero mosque was moved. That boils down to â€œwe wonâ€™t attack you if you do as we say.â€ I think the technical term for that is â€œextortion.â€ Defense Secretary Robert Gates called Pastor Terry yesterday. I donâ€™t know exactly what Robert Gates said to him, and I suspect that Pastor Terry doesnâ€™t either. Pastor Terry probably thinks Robert Gates offered to move the Pentagon to another location because it has a mosque inside of it. Now Pastor Terry says he is â€œrethinkingâ€ the Quran burning. Re-thinking? This episode shows precious little evidence of any thinking in the first place. This is the most drawn out, agonized, absurd decision since Brett Favreâ€™s last retirement.

By the way, what is up with Pastor Terryâ€™s absurd facial hair? I know you live in the 19th century, Pastor, but you donâ€™t have to look like it. At least get a monocle and a walking stick to complete the look. Pastor Terry looks like Chester A. Arthur. Not a lot of people know who that is. And if the world was rational, we could say the same thing about Pastor Terry.

On a lighter note, check out this comically impassioned speech from a guy named Phil Davison trying to be selected (he wasnâ€™t) as the GOP nominee for Treasurer of Stark County, Ohio (video below). Phil looks like heâ€™s at wrestling smack down. Iâ€™m glad his opponent wasnâ€™t thereâ€”Phil might have hit him with a folding chair. I would wish Phil success in his future career, but Iâ€™m afraid of how worked up he would get if he ever ran for something beyond Stark County Treasurer.
