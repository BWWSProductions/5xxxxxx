,RedReved,2011-04-09T04:30Z,"finally got them downloaded.. it took me forever since my download speeds were extremely sporadic...
anyways, they all look really good so far, but for some strange reason xmen1 won't show any visuals on the ps3 but plays fine on laptop, the rest are perfect though... trying to see whats going on"
,RedReved,2011-04-11T04:32Z,"ok, it turns out that just the very first part where they show the '20th century fox' logo doesn't show, the rest is perfect. I'm a happy camper"
,spiritdragon11,2011-05-03T01:41Z,spent DAYS downloading this thing and it sucks. the audio DOES NOT match up with the video and at some points the video skips like a scratched CD. ugh pointless waste of time to dl this.
,ak47killa14,2011-05-07T05:25Z,"AWESOME! I can't wait to finish downloading this awesome torrent. All the comments are good and it's all extremly HD and only 8 Gbs. Wow! That's amazing! Download and seed this everyone, Thank you!! "
,bloitz,2011-05-15T12:16Z,"Comparing the quality of these with other torrents is like comparing a horse with a car. A car's power is expressed in Horse Power but they just aren't even remotely comparable. These rock, keep it up :)

A: 9 (should watch them on my desktop to know if the sounds really good, but was amazing on my laptop)

V: 9.5 (A - fucking -MAZING, unseen size-quality ratio afaik) 

M: Personal opinion is personal"
,CrazyJB,2011-05-21T04:35Z,"3 doesn't play sound and looks to have other video problems. All others work fine and great quality.

Too bad. Woulda been perfect."

First of all I think that your encoding method is amazing and that it should become a new standard. MAybe you should share it for everyone who would like to try it. 

Still although you have some amazing encodes  (Inception and Thor were almost pixel perfect). The quality is not consistent between your different uploads. The fist two X-men movies in this here may be very good considering the size but do not match the quality of your other Rips. The same goes for some of the starwars films that you encoded. 
These are movies that everybody has seen so most would like to keep them in near perfect quality. I think you should stay more above 2500 kbit/sec (close to 3GB) for your movies to be BLuray-like. You ve done it before and you can do it again.!!! :D"
,Lightben,2012-02-14T19:08Z,and A HUGE THANK YOU for the time to encode and share all this stuff!!!
,DrFeelGood82,2012-03-25T00:13Z,Im having trouble with all of the movies.  Ive DL 2 times. The sound is fine but the video is choppy and dgitized. I might be  doing something wrong.  Im using vlc media player.
,Hudokid,2012-05-27T08:52Z,"Could someone please seed this last bit, im at 96.1% with a couple of days more of downloading? Already watched the second one, with only a few bits missing, but its soooo annoying. Thanks for the torrent. Great video and audio quality."
,Zanteater,2012-06-28T04:58Z,"Alright, not sure whats going on here, but these just arent really playing on anything!

Quicktime - failed - Media Player Classic - failed - Windows Media Player - failed - VLC - failed - iTunes - failed.

I want to guess that because everything im trying to do fails that its probably ME lol

Anyone got any helpful tips for me on getting these to run?

(Oh, on windows media player it starts and about 14 seconds in the video stops and the timer skips really fast, in about 30 seconds the video is over )"
,Zanteater,2012-06-28T05:05Z,"My old comment got deleted 'somehow' so im just going to delete this torrent and download one that actually works, i really want these on my mobile and if i can't even get them to play on my PC, it just wont work on my mobile for sure.

I suggest all the other peolpe with this problem do the same."
