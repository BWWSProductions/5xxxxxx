Can you please write which manufacturer is it from? (Acer, Dell, Toshiba, etc. ??) Don't know if they are all the same."
,amihaita,2010-09-11T16:49Z,It is not branded for any computer manufacturer. This is clean version from Microsoft.
,rippoff,2010-09-11T19:48Z,"Just what Doc. orderd.
Nice!"
,DragFire,2010-09-12T01:24Z,Thanks for the clarification. (+1 rating though I didn't try it yet... some rated it -1 and there were still no downloads)
,amihaita,2010-09-12T05:27Z,"About the rating, some probably didn't like the ""no serial"" part. And of course we must don't forget the ones who vote with ""+"" their own torrents and with ""-"" others. And yes, as you have noticed those who vote didn't downloaded the torrent."

,raygan777,2010-09-13T02:17Z,can we activate it with window activater7 lenovo thanks 
,amihaita,2010-09-14T16:29Z,"@raygan777: I don't see any problem to activate it on any system with OEM Windows 7 Home Premium x64. The only problem that can appear is that Microsoft has limited the number of online activation for a serial number (and of course this have to be genuine), and in that case you should ask for phone activation."
,Sprocketman67,2010-10-22T10:34Z,"THANK YOU! Bought a new display laptop and when I attempted to transfer from the old laptop I somehow locked myself out of the new laptop. It asked for the display password from the store which of course I didn't know. And the laptop did not come with a Disc. Used this copy to repair and it worked like a charm, I was able to bypass the password screen and get in to the New laptop."

,alexdeonly,2010-11-26T04:42Z,"@floydrose6:

Use a program like MagicISO or Nero burning ROM or any other program that accepts the image file format ISO. Google that format to find a program you would like to use to burn the image file with."

[V],.Dude.,2011-08-31T19:02Z,"Can sumbody help me out please.I dunno what exactly has got corruptd in my system.As i turn it on i get windows failed to start,tried every thing bt didnt work,evn da recovry discs.I had win 7 home premium x64 pre installd original.Now can i install from this dvd and activate it by entering the product key written on the slip below the laptop??"
,DxZen,2011-09-03T01:06Z,"This is not Retail. It's not even OEM. Itâ€™s something elseâ€“ kind a gray area: â€œMicrosoft Full Packaged Product (FPP) Media.â€ 

Aside from this, Installation goes perfectly. This gets into licensing.  

Still legitimate from Microsoft, assumed & fully believed to be unaltered, unmodified & the installation goes very well so reason to doubt the original torrenter on this -- but the operating system disc falls into a 3rd category which is: ""Microsoft Full Packaged Product (FPP) Media."" Google it.

After doing a clean install, I wondered why it didnâ€™t auto-activate with a Toshiba L635 â€“ Core i3 Laptop that comes with Windows 7 Home Premium â€“ 64 Bit â€“ so the known Toshiba Windows 7 Home Premium â€“ 64 Bit OEM SLP key code :  RHPQ2-RMFJH-74XYM-BH4JX-XM76F shouldnâ€™t have to be entered at all with a straight un-branded Windows 7 Home Premium â€“  64 Bit OEM disc & wouldâ€™ve activated fine automatically feeding off the Toshibaâ€™s Insyde BIOS & Windows 7 BIOS markers that work to slipstream the Toshiba Windows 7 Home Premium OEM SLP keyâ€¦but it didnâ€™t auto-activate, so I ran a small program known as Magic Jelly Bean Keyfinder to see what the mediaâ€™s source truly was -- ouput below:

Windows 7 Home Premium 
Product Part No.: X15-39665
Installed from 'Full Packaged Product' media.
Product ID: 00359-112-0000007-85000  --  match to CD Key data
CD Key: RHPQ2-RMFJH-74XYM-BH4JX-XM76F  --   Toshiba OEM SLP key

After installation, loading drivers, gives 30 days to activate. With a straight, non-branded OEM Windows 7 Home Premium - 64 Bit disc, it would have already been activated via Windows 7 OEM SLP Activation. 

Now what about the Toshiba OEM digital license product certificate as a marker that's embedded into C: Windows --- should be there right? 

To find it easily, go from: Computer: > C: (primary HDD) > Windows >  System32 >  OEM.

Youâ€™ll come to a folder named OEM. Inside the OEM folder, there should be 3kb Digital Product License Certificate [XrML Digital License (.xrm-ms) file] there from the PC's manufacturer (in my case from Toshiba) for automatic Windows 7 OEM SLP activation, but after installation, there's no OEM folder and obviously no digital product certificate either.  

If you wanted to download and run the SLIC BIOS Dump Toolkit V3.2 (really nice program) by DavidXXW after doing a clean install of Windows 7 Home Premium â€“ 64 using this disc, youâ€™ll see exactly the same result on the 2nd Advanced tab that I found â€“ thereâ€™s no digital product certificate â€“ no OEM cert â€“ no certificate in red. 
Copy->pasting the OEM folder with certificate inside is usually an easy fix to get it to go through. Restart PC. Wouldn't work. No big deal. This is simple: youâ€™ll need a unique, valid key.

Disc does what it's supposed to, but it's definitely not OEM. Not sure how the licensing works with Microsoft Windows Full Packaged Product Media & MS FPP Media Licensing, but if youâ€™re thinking this is OEM, well no --- you will need the OEM/COA off of the bottom of the laptop or on the side access panel of a desktop PC to activate Windows 7 Home Premium - 64 Bit â€“ or youâ€™ll simply need a unique product key or retail key."
,Dana85,2011-11-02T03:15Z,Hey all. I have a PC with Windows 7 Home Premium x64. has llic under PC. so my question is? can i  use the same key to this
