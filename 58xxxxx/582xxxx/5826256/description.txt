    The movie takes place on Oslo's east side sometime during the            
    twenties. It depicts the workers' environment by traditional elements    
    like unemployment, strike, poverty, alcoholism, absent fathers, wise     
    and tired mothers, the dream of a better life and the friendship         
    between the boys in the street.                                          
                                                                             
    Note: Since this movie is kinda old, the borders is varying a lot.       
          We've tried cropping out the worst parts, without ruining          
          the whole movie. Sheeps: fo.
