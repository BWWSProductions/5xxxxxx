I then opened convertxtodvd 3 and selected to add video files, and opened the disc that I just burned and opened the folder BDMW, opened the folder STREAM and added the file 00000..The process took about an hour, extremely great A/V quality. Thank you, hope this helps!"
,blooddogg757,2011-05-23T20:35Z,"Just to clarify, burning it to a disc first and converting it from the disc makes an AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS folder of the movie in your ConvertX folder, usually found in your documents folder. You can then burn copies of the movie at will with your favorite dvd burning program, I use MagicDVD."

Last time I watched Turtles 1 was in the early 90's on VHS on a small CRT-TV. Can't wait to see this in HD and with a much better sound system than back then."
