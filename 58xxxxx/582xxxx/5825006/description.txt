Nine Inch Nails presents Ghosts I - IV, a brand new 36 track 

instrumental collection available right now. Almost two hours of new 

music composed and recorded over an intense ten week period last 

fall, Ghosts I - IV sprawls Nine Inch Nails across a variety of new 

terrain.

Trent Reznor explains, "I've been considering and wanting to make 

this kind of record for years, but by its very nature it wouldn't 

have made sense until this point. This collection of music is the 

result of working from a very visual perspective - dressing imagined 

locations and scenarios with sound and texture; a soundtrack for 

daydreams. I'm very pleased with the result and the ability to 

present it directly to you without interference. I hope you enjoy the 

first four volumes of Ghosts."
