,throwing_wheel,2010-09-14T15:43Z,It's scheduled for release Sept. 28.  Can this be what it claims to be? 
,DarthBubba,2010-09-15T05:32Z,"More importantly, did they get the subtitles right this time: English subs for non-English dialogue only.  I was getting tired of German SRT subs overlaid on Russian hard coded subs for a guy speaking French.

At least I was able to read the German subs. :-)"
,fungifu,2010-09-15T20:40Z,"This is a top-quality torrent. Subs are in English (where needed) not German like half the others. Format is Widescreen, AR is 1280x544, exceptional quality. Download this one and you're good! "
