Dear Boss,


*************


This is only my fourth torrent.  I hope I am getting better at this!

This is for sampling purposes only.  It is out of print as is Mortal's
stuff, so if you like this I advise you to try to support the artist
in any way including but not limited to buying Fold Zandura albums
that are not out of print.

Dinner is ready so I have to go eat so I must make this short and sweet.

Mortal was a Christian industrial band that showed up in the early 90's.
Their sound was very similar to Ministry's early albums.  They began to
change their sound on the album "Wake" to a more melodic (but still heavy)
alternative sound.  They went on to release another album or two but then
they created Fold Zandura.  Same band members, different persona.  Very
melodic, atmospheric, dreamy whispery vocals etc.  Really good stuff to
make out with your girlfriend to.  This is the original 1995 release
(Windows Media Player wants to call it 1996 but I am holding the original
copy that I acquired years ago dated 1995; trust me, it's 1995).

Anyone got Mortal's Nu-En-Jin?  I need it badly!

I also highly recommend the bands Mortal and Starflyer59 if you like Fold Zandura.

Enjoy & please seed!
