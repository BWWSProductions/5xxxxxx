,Frazlo,2010-09-12T22:32Z,"I like the resident evil films... but this one sucked... The quality of video and sound is pretty good concidering it just came out, i expected to have to wait a week. Good upload, movie.. not so much. Still worth a watch if you like the movies though i suppose. And obviously another one to come. lets hope it's better"

,lilkiss,2010-09-13T10:56Z,thanks raymondhome always apprecited and always good
,Mayuri,2010-09-13T12:36Z,"Whoa I'm glad I didn't pay to see this crap! I was so close of doing it too. Thanks to the
uploader,raymondhome, he saved me money from seeing a terrible movie. I'm a huge Resident evil fan and I am strongly disappointed in this newest movie! how fucking lame can it be? 

Now I must wait for another couple of years before Resident evil 5 comes out. What a drag!"
,revdfowl,2010-09-13T14:54Z,"ok watched movie, only none eglish speaking is in first 5 minutes of the movie.. I already posted but here is my take on a: 6 v: 7.... it is dark in lots of places but for a cam vid its very watchable.. But beware the movie is a 2 at best.. im sure in 3D its a bigger disappointment.. There is less action in this movie then Forest Gump, every battle less then epic I mean really if they made a smurfs movie it would probably have better fights. Its a hideous who ever gave the gp ahead to make, shoot, print and ship that movie out needs to be shot put in a wood chipper and burned to ash then his ashes need to be pulverized on an atomic lvl so we can get the action the movie promised.. this movie is a bigger disappointment then when i learned santa was not real... the first Jaws movie was 300 times more violent.. this movie sucked so bad that Roger Ebert should cut his thumb off and have it burried 100,000 feet down just to make the point of how bad the movie was.. every copy of the movie should be destroyed, in 30 years if they decide to make a remake of this movie i will   destroy the world I promise i will.. My grandma had fights with stand mixers making cookies that were more epic.. if you can not tell by now what i am saying is this movie sucked, it sucked it sucked.."

,co30op,2010-09-13T22:35Z,"Thanks for the upload.  Save your bandwidth though.  Movie quality is good, but the movie itself is crap.  If your going to watch a crap movie at least wait till the DVD or R5."
,sporkelton,2010-09-13T22:37Z,"we should all remember to that this is the dumbed down version for theaters, lets wait for the unrated version before we all commit suicide over a movie now."

,revdfowl,2010-09-14T00:19Z,"no the movie sucks balls, i mean it suckrd so bad i thought about going to the theater buying a ticket and 5 minuts before show time get my money back, the movie sucked so bad that it makes me wanna rip out the eyes of any one going to see it so i can save them the pain..,, it was like resident evil care bear edition.. its suckes so bad i showed it to the Pope in rome and he said fuck this shit put on train spotting. this movie is so shitty that jeepers creapers became the 2nd shities movie ever made.. this movie sucked more balls in 2 hours then a amsterdam prostitute in 2 life times.. no end to the suckiness"

,TM245,2010-09-14T07:22Z,"@kkakayka I can't believe I actually went to that website and expected to view the movie absolutely free, only to find out that I have to sign up to 1 of 3 mobile alerts that will soak my cellphone bill with expensive txt msgs until I shut the txt subscription off.

Oh well at least I tried it and filled out survey up until it asked for my Cellphone number.... Not gonna happen.

And oh ya, great movie, thanks for the up.  My roommate love Resident Evil but I know he won't watch a cam of it, but I will.  Thanks."

,codycook,2010-09-20T08:42Z,"I saw the movie in theater tonight. Loved it. 

This version is kind of weird because it was released from Russia... plus when the subtitles are needed (like they are played in the theater) you have no idea what the guys are saying at the beginning because of the way the camera is angled. You can randomly see Russian subtitles too."
,MacMan7,2010-09-21T16:18Z,"Poor quality, video is very grainy and the audio gets on my nerves. Anyone who hopes to see a decent copy of this film like myself, wait for the DVDRip.
