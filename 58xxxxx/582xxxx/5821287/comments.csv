Dont want to sound cheeky.. But.. Any chance of 40s, 50s, 60s?
If not, it doesnt matter, (wipes tear from cheek), I am sure I can live with 3324 of the best songs from the past 40 years.

Respect Kitlope.. You are Great. .x.x.

,akbarhash,2011-02-09T20:10Z,"This is a great torrent, now if only someone could rip it to lame 3.98 then it would be even better..."
,czolgista,2011-03-05T02:18Z,"Hey, i've checked the files with Audiochecker and found out that:

Eminem - Crack a Bottle is MPEG (95%)
Evanescence - Bring me to life is MPEG (95%)
Fergie - Clumsy is MPEG (95%)
Katy Perry - I kissed a girl is MPEG (95%)
Madonna - 4 Minutes is MPEG (95%)
Nelly Furtado - Maneater is MPEG (95%)
Soulja boy - Crank That is MPEG (95%)

So, are those just MPEG's or Audiochecker's fault? The rest is fine, thanx for a good torrent."

,coo4632,2011-11-20T07:30Z,"I have a really nice collection of mp3s and I love them, but the quality on some is so bad that the pain of listening to them is almost visceral.

I have just listened to a couple of your files and it is pure bliss, it almost brings a tear to my eye.

Thank you very much!!

I try to seed all my torrents to 1.5, but am falling behind as I download too much.

Will try to seed your torrent as much as I can, I wish my connection was faster.

I know allot of seeders are necessary for large files.

Props to all those out there keeping files alive."
