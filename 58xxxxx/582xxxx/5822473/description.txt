Like quite a few classic rock outfits that built their career on a 

signature live album in the grand old '70s, every subsequent live 

release issued will be compared to their signature live set from the 

decade that brought us Afros, bell bottoms, and Star Wars. And while 

the Outlaws' 1978 release, Bring It Back Alive, is one of the decade's 

most underrated live efforts (but did manage to introduce the group to 

a whole new set of fans), their 1993 in-concert offering, Hittin' the 

Road, is surprisingly not too shabby in its own right. The playing 

remains inspired throughout (as does the energy level) -- which can 

often prove problematic at times with live releases by certain veteran 

rockers, who seem appear to stay set on cruise control. But the 

Outlaws dodge the "blah bullet" throughout, especially on the album-

opening title track, "(Ghost) Riders in the Sky," and the set-closing 

jamfest, "Green Grass & High Tides." While most fans will deem Bring 

It Back Alive to be the Outlaws' definitive concert statement, 

'Hittin' the Road' proved that there was still plenty left in the tank 

from these old codgers.
