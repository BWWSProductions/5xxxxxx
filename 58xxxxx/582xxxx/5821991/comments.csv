Armageddon. It is a universal theme that has spanned centuries and cultures...and has, as some say, become increasingly more relevant today. 

Surprisingly, however, a final chapter of this apocalyptic end has received little examination: the actual final battle between God and Satan, good and evil. The Bible points to a battlefield at Meggido in present day Israel, with each side taking a series of steps that will lead up to, and unfold, during this actual battle. What will this battle look like? Where do the stories come from, and how have they differed throughout history, between religions?

God vs. Satan: The Final Battle will take viewers on a tour of the final days, and moments, as envisioned by believers of the three Abrahamic religions."

,hammerheadieaglethrust,2011-02-07T14:45Z,thanks a lot. i was wondering if you could put a description of the torrent on this page. like it is in the nfo file. that would be easier to find out exactly what it's about. well obviously not this one but your other uploads. your uploads are great by the way. just wish there were more seeders!
