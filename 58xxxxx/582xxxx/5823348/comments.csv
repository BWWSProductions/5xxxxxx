,diyarsonist,2010-11-29T11:37Z,"Another ""Renderer #0 could not be initialized. please make sure your graphics card drivers are up to date. check log file for more information."" error code here. No wonder this gaming studio is about to fold. This game refuses to play on ANY LAPTOP with on-board video. Get fucking real. I can play Starcraft II but not this?"

,Shuriken-Jutsu,2011-09-18T20:25Z,"When you launch it, the far bottom scroll option thing lets you change the language.  The top option is English.

However, this product needs a license key.  Can't play it without one."

,Herpidy,2012-04-08T22:35Z,"To activate the game, find the Trivium activator program, it has a redish blackish icon, can't remember where (Already deleted the files I dont need). Copy the Trivium activator, right click Amensia, the actual installed game, and click open file location. Paste trivium anywhere on there and run the program. Then click Activate, and that will activate the game :D
I think this program works to activate any game that doesnt have a CD key... Ill test it out in the future :o"
