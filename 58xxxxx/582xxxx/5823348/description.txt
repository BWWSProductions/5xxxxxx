            The hero of the game, Daniel wakes up in an old castle, not  
            knowing who he was, how I got here and what happened. The    
            only thing he feels - chilling feeling of anxiety, as if     
            something was following him and the time given him away.     
            And just found out the note, signed his own name, he learns  
            that he preferred to forget the past and thereby get rid of  
            the heavy emotional wounds.                                  
                                                                         
            In an attempt to understand what is happening to Daniel will 
            explore the darkest corners of the castle and see the        
            horrific inhabitants of this place, every encounter that     
            threatens his imminent death. Faced face to face with the    
            ghost of his past, Daniel will find salvation or die.
