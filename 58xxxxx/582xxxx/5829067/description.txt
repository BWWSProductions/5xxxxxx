Plot.............: They were fellow travelers...Yusuf was working for a company that
brought out sunken ship wrecks and sold them. His beautiful wife, Meryem, is a modest
teacher giving private lessons and she is pregnant for two months now. They were yet
not aware that this short trip they started for the wreck ship project at opens of
Bozcaada island was about to turn into a nightmare because of a letter left by a woman
whom they did not know at all. Around the same hours, poor Adem, who is an old soldier
and just learned that his wife ran away and was hopelessly calling to ask for help
from his old diver friend Niko, the only person he knew on that island, is at the edge
of insanity. The sun goes down, the sky is thorn apart and when that time arrives
destiny makes its sharers gather up. That night death was considered for one of these
whose lives intercepted. And a hell like glow for those left behind.
