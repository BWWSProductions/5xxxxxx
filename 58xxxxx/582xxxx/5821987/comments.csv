Strangely, the volume for both recordings came out considerably lower than usual. I did not change any program settings or adjust volume. I don't know why this happened. I tried normalizing the sound, but it just made recordings sound shittier (background noise, hiss, etc.). Anyway, It's not too bad, just turn up the volume a bit. Peace."

Probably mouse clicks...sorry. This is an issue when one must record directly from pc's hardware. Too bad ReplayAV doesn't work with Randi or Hartmann anymore. But the volume wasn't as bad as I thought."
