Back in 2003, Walt Disney went against the general perception that the Pirate Genre was a thing of the past. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, released in 2003, shattered this perception by not only becoming a critical and commercial success but also generated a huge cult following.

The performance of this movie sparked off the sequels for the movie. The Dead Manâ€™s Chest and At Worldâ€™s End have taken the Pirates series to a new level.

The fans cannot get enough of the series and especially of â€˜Captainâ€™ Jack Sparrow who will return in another Pirates series movie called â€œOn Stranger Tidesâ€.
