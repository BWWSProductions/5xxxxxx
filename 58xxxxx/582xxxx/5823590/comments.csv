,iceblade1007,2010-09-11T23:36Z,"unfortunately the end is missing only 1 hour long, but the real movie is 97 min :("
,keith23uk,2010-09-12T01:19Z,This is 1hr 25mins 47 seconds long NOT 1 hr long. Only thing missing is the 20 second part after the credits start rolling.
,keith23uk,2010-09-12T01:25Z,You are wrong Iceblade its all there. Just the bit after credits isnt. One hour twenty five minutes long.

,dillball,2010-09-12T03:47Z,"Why on EARTH do they DUB movies stil... in 20-freaking-10...... There is SUBTITLES to have made, wich obviously is easier to have done, then to have ppl record audio translation upon the original audio! Just unbelievable.... cant get over the stone age or what? its like the easiest language to LEARN in the world - Im from norway, and our country have NEVER dub`ed any foreign movie, any language - EVER!
