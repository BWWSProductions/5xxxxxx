If your iPhoto library contains thousands of photos and movies organized in hundreds of events, retrieving your media files may be a challenging experience. This is where iPhoto To Disk can help.

Whether you need to backup your photos or movies to an external hard drive (in a non-proprietary format and possibly including iPhoto metadata) or just want to export your photos or movies for use in other applications, iPhoto To Disk makes it easy.
