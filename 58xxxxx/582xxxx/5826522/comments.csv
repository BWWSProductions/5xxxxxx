Let wel : je moet alle sims 3 uitbreidingen hebben geinstalleerd die deze voorgaan d.w.z.
De sims 3 + Wereldavonturen + Ambities anders werkt het hoogst waarschijnlijk niet.
Je moet gewoon de rar. file uitpakken daarna klikken op SIMS3SP02SETUP installatie begint automatisch.
Hij zal eerst je bestaande game updaten en daarna installeren.
Na de installatie vervang je in de gamebin folder de dll. en de exe. file door deze die je terugvind in de CRACK 2 folder.

Dat klopt, de ""Crack 1"" is voor personen die over een originele kopie van The Sims 3 beschikken, maar het kan geen kwaad om de Crack alsnog toe te passen.

Since this is an Expansions, you'll first need to Install the The Sims 3 base game, which can be Downloaded from www.games4theworld.org .

When it comes to the ""stuff"" packs, you don't load the games with the crack for those. It runs off of the actual expansion packs, not ""stuff"" packs (i.e. Ambitions, Generations, etc).  So, you'll see it load ""Late Night"" if that is the latest expansion you have, but you will have your stuff from ""Fast Lane Stuff"".

Make sure you have DAEMON TOOLS!
This is what you mount to, you can download Daemon Tools Lite for FREE at the download website.


Unrar/unzip everything and mount into your daemon tools when instructed.
Some DO NOT NEED DAEMON TOOLS!  In this case, just open the SETUP application and run it.


Install in THIS order.


!!!!!!!DO NOT CRACK ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

THIS IS KEY! 

If you crack ANYTHING during your installs you will make it so NONE of them work and you might even have problems REMOVING them as they won't even UNINSTALL correctly


UPDATE WHEN ASKED
it won't hurt and you cannot move on unless you allow the update in EACH install!
