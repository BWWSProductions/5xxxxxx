I have tried installing both and when opening 'LEGO Star Wars.dmg' It tells me to insert the original disk, and with 'LEGO.SW.1.0.NoDVD.Cracked.dmg' it tells me ' LEGO Star Wars cannot be run off of the DVD. Please install the game.'

please help! :D"
,Lupidus,2010-11-18T19:51Z,"When I opened it, it seems like if its going to work, but then it exits and says it unexpectedly closed down and gives me the options of retrying or ignoring. Whats wrong?"
,KosciakPL,2010-12-06T18:21Z,You must update your Mac system. I had the same problem I run Software Update and it's working.
,iTzAweshom,2010-12-16T11:34Z,How can we update our mac systems?

,Mothar,2011-02-04T08:14Z,"Worked fine for me. I have newest version of mac (10.6.6).
Drag the crack into the same folder as the game and the double click it to start. 5/5"
,Lupidus,2011-03-04T22:00Z,"How would that be, Mothar? 
Can someone explain, please?"
,Lupidus,2011-03-04T23:45Z,"Oh, by the way, done!!
Alright... That was easy! hah

for future problems:
1. Have your original 'LEGO Star Wars' (R2D2's image) in a folder together with another folder called 'LEGO Star Wars Data'.
2. Submit it into the Applications folder.
3. Once it is copied, grab the cracked the other R2D2's image 'LEGO Star Wars' and put it into the folder you submitted earlier.
4. It will ask to replace or ignore.
5. REPLACE.
6. Double click.
7. PLAY."
