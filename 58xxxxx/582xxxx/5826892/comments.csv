,hakuna_matata,2010-09-12T22:44Z,Thanks from Delhi! .. you rock 
,maazze,2010-09-12T23:04Z,It drives my brain off the Fcking wall when ppl shut down computers as soon as they are done downloading. Seed FFS !! You get this sh*t free cant u seed at least ? 
,mode3sour,2010-09-12T23:12Z,Thank you from Canada!  BBC rules
,GTP_Raven,2010-09-13T00:04Z,"Guys cheer up, seed/peer now 24/1873 and the 24 are offline!!! I should have been awake to see live instead of this :sigh:"
,mode3sour,2010-09-13T00:51Z,Ugh I'm 45% done with availability of only 46% and average peer completion of 38%.  So we're all moving up very very slowly and someone somewhere is connected to one of 3 seeds I hope
,GTP_Raven,2010-09-13T00:57Z,"LOL, I saw your comment =) I might know someone who do....I'll let you know, check here again..."
,MikeR56,2010-09-13T01:18Z,"Appreciate your work. Only wish people would keep seeding! I've been waiting waiting to finish over 4 hours now. @50% 50k per sec. C'mon you fuckers, seed the damn thing."
,Misterkriskooper,2010-09-13T02:58Z,I've never complained about seeders but this is ridiculous. 7 hours and barely halfway through a gig.
,MikeR56,2010-09-13T03:48Z,Don't feel bad. I've been downloading since it was posted. 8 fking hours ago. 80%. I always have decent results from OP. Maybe seeders are bailing or just giving up. What a pisser.
,mode3sour,2010-09-13T03:50Z,Same here!!  I just want to watch the race before I go to work and have to avoid spoilers all day.  Ugh only 2 seeders and 80% after 7 hrs
,thischris,2010-09-13T04:13Z,"As of this moment, there seem to be a few seeders active, but not many. The torrent availability is at 86%, and another 1% is added every 5 to 10 minutes. At this rate, it will not be fully available from a new round of seeders until about an hour and a half from now.

For many with good connections, that is enough time to download and start watching the qualifying session. And if you do that, you can more easily skip the pre-race discussion."
,mode3sour,2010-09-13T05:10Z,"Well I was hoping I could watch this before midnight but as I feared, with only a few seeds, we are all stuck at 98%.  I'm only connected to 1/2 seeds with 100%"
,MikeR56,2010-09-13T06:56Z,"Maybe next time you should rar this. Torrents don't ""seed"" very well while they are being viewed.  "
,digimike50,2010-09-13T08:10Z,As Always - MANY thanks!
,mrjlr93,2010-09-13T11:47Z,Thankyou TDMK1 excellent quality 10/10 and love the BBC commentary. Thanks from Australia and seeding all week.

Guys Keep Seeding the torrents till atleast 1.1 .. you are not bewing charged for uploads

Sharing is Caring.. I always leave it on seed after i finish

@Fetal19
Dont s\post spoilers you stupid ass, many people work and not able to watch the race and download it and then watch it. and I told you earlier too be paitent or Just upload ur own if you cant wait a few hours atleast. SOB."
,hakuna_matata,2010-09-13T14:57Z,"@Fetal19

You made me laugh my boy. Dont use this type of languge boy on our The Pirate Bay is scared Place."
,hakuna_matata,2010-09-13T16:07Z,"And FORGODS SAKE Donâ€™t post spoilers again who is on pole or who won.. people who have missed the races also watch it after downloading and it kills the price. what it would be like if I posted the result in the first post on this torrent.  Fernando is cry baby noone likes him except spaniards. I do like him he is quick but vettel, webber, schumi all are good guys. Massa deserved the win but he got it. Fernando is faster than you..bloody hell .. now all news teams are on this.. Vettel will be champion some way  and so it can be Button this year you never know. More likely Webber he deserves it like button did last year. I again say.. Be a polite ass.. means not in bad way but a good way. Be poilte to others on torrents .. they record, encode for hours and then upload it for you, then you are able to watch it. so dude.. just be paitent. "
,hakuna_matata,2010-09-13T18:41Z,"@mode3sour
dude sometimes the torrents hangs a bit but that was not for a long time it was just a small period. there can be many reasons either its the ISP or sometimes tracker reboots so it takes a bit time but i assure you that was a smal glitch

And More importantly .. you can watch the race prety well at 98%. both Media Player Classic and VLC Player are fine to play the file after 90% its just fine to see it. I am not saying you should but at 98% i just start watching .. myself. and in few minutes the remaining downloaded as well.

Regards



@all
Keep Seeding till next weekend .. lol"
,YiNG_YaNG_6o4,2010-09-14T04:19Z,"i request that TDMK stops uploading the F1 torrents on here.  That way dumb shits like Feces can't spoil the race for anyone.  I will get all those who need it an invite to Demonoid so they can get the race.  But thats only if TDMK stops uploading here.  Just a suggestion so pricks can't watch the race =)

let me guess... Feces's highly educated mind is going to tell me to ""shut the fuck up"".   Then he is going to misspell ""wheeny"" lol! 

I'm gonna help you out so you can have some intelligent come backs and not always just say ""shut the fuck up"".  This will help you alot since english is not your first language.

study hard now ok?  I want to at least feel like i am arguing with someone that has a brain."
,hakuna_matata,2010-09-15T01:15Z,"People come on torrents to share.. sharing is caring.. you have not been around that long to see what we have gone through in years. and the aggressive language you write what that states.. It shows how you have grown up and your family background. Do you talk to your parents like that? I guess the answer would be NO.. So, think that there are elder people here and you need to respect them You don’t know who is the other person man.

@tdmk1
i will try not to reply to such again again. sorry"
,meetch,2010-09-15T12:28Z,"Hi guys, I have VLC but can't play [preview] this video. Why is that? Tells me 'codec not supported... and unfortunately this cannot be fixed'. Any help?"
