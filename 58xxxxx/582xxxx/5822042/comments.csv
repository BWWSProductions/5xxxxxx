,No_Bullshit,2010-09-20T22:54Z,"A have a other way to remux,it is a bit more
complicated.
1.Use DVDFab 7 to Re-author and save the main
movie to a folder.

2.Use tsMuxer to remux to one m2ts file.
You open the main movie folder search after playlist folder.You see one m2ts file in the playlist folder.now drag and drop file in tsMuxer
choose to mux to m2ts.Now you hade one file 
whit the main movie."
,IDominus,2010-09-29T00:07Z,"You shouldn't have to do anything if you only want one M2TS file.  I'm guessing the uploader did a direct rip to the hard-drive using AnyDVD or something similar.  

1. Open BDMV folder
2. Open STREAM folder
3. Sort files by size
4. Largest file should be the movie.  Check runtime and play in VLC media player to make sure.

If you want to compress the movie to a smaller size (fit on a DVD5, DVD9, BD25, etc), follow this tutorial,

,IDominus,2010-09-29T00:18Z,"Actually, after checking the file sizes in my torrent, the movie may be split onto multiple M2TS files.  In which case the tut I posted should still work.  "
