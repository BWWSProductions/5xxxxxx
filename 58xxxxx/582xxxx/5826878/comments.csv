Video is very fuzzy, but it's definitely watchable for this sort of gritty flick.  Bad dark scenes, but it's not too hard to deal with.

Has a line of Russian hardsubs.  The Japanese spoken language in the beginning scenes is normal.

Audio is dull, but that's to be expected.

I have no comparison to other TS torrents that are out there, so I can neither thumbs up or thumbs down."

If you can put your brain on hold, then this is a great C movie.  But imo don't watch this unless you fapped to the the previous movies in the series."
