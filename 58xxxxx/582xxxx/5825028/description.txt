The Montreal Screwjob was a real life incident in which WWE (then WWF) owner Vince McMahon double-crossed WWF Champion Bret Hart. The incident occurred at the Survivor Series in 1997 during a match between WWF Champion Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels. During the match, McMahon came to the ring as Michaels was putting Hart in the Sharpshooter submission hold. McMahon ordered referee Earl Hebner  to ring the bell and end the match, even though Hart had not submitted. Michaels was awarded the victory and the WWF Championship. Hart proceeded to show his anger by spitting in the face of McMahon and destroying several television monitors.
