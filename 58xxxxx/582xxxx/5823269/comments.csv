Download only the files you want!"
,Screamokid,2010-09-26T01:22Z,"Hm... I just clicked ""Download"" and I'm very satisfied with what you've done, giving people the video track and then many audio tracks, 2 in english, one 6 channel and one 2 channel, I downloaded the 6 channel track because I use surround sound but surely that wouldn't matter if you have 2 channel or not, it would be better if you download 6 channel because then you're prepared for surround sound.

Well anyway, I'm now going to download and hope for the best. I should probably start putting stuff onto an external harddrive to plug into my Blu-Ray. HD videos are very laggy from my laptop into my TV :( especially MP4 videos! I'll see how this is though as it's MKV

Again, thank you! :)"
,Screamokid,2010-09-27T22:49Z,"Downloaded, happy with video quality, many sub tracks, that's cool, now I'm stuck with how I'm supposed to play both the tracks at the same time. :("
,MaximilianKohler,2010-10-19T18:29Z,"To play with VLC, go to Media -> Advanced Open File -> Click 'Add' and add the .mkv file -> check Play another media file synchronously -> add the audio file you want -> hit select -> hit play."
,Screamokid,2010-10-29T03:23Z,"MaximilianKohler, Thanks for that. Now I just want to learn to join them together. This way I don't have to do some fiddling about :)"

MPC is much better then VLC for playing back 1080p...and will automatically play the external audios without fiddling around like with VLC."

,turdler,2011-07-11T03:21Z,"My peak has been 650kbps average 300kbps.

Pathetic for 30 seeds.

I'll seed 10x. Hopefully the other downloaders do the same."
