Vibraphonist Cal Tjader expertly balances between cool jazz and Latin music on this fine live concert, reissued as an LP (but not yet a CD) in the Original Jazz Classics series. Utilizing two soon-to-be-famous percussionists (Willie Bobo and Mongo Santamaria) plus pianist Lonnie Hewitt and bassist Eddie Coleman, Tjader is in top form throughout the spirited set. Highlights include "Cuban Fantasy" (which has an exciting Bobo timbale solo), "Love for Sale" and "S.S. Groove." ~ Scott Yanow
