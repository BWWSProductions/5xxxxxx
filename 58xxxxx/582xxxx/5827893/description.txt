This documentary, created in the early 1990's provides, with shocking accuracy, the blueprint for the New World Order's agenda. The Agenda was created in an underground bunker, Iron Mountain, way back in the sixties under request of John F. Kennedy, and serves to this day as the cookbook for global enslavement.

The Iron Mountain report was leaked by one brave soul and was published as a book. it was vehemently dismissed as a fraud, but time has proven that it is THE doceument that the U.N. has used to bring us toward a one-world government It is still available today - check Amazon.com

Please note while watching the movie, exactly how many of this document's suggestions are being implemented right now as we speak. One very important one is GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE - It was tried under Clinton, but failed...but we know what happened last year under Obama, Don't we?
