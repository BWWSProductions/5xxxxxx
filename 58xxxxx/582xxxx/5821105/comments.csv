,lyracid,2011-08-07T01:42Z,IT'S FUCKING CENSORED.
[H],politux,2011-08-08T00:09Z,"Uh yeah.. of course it is censored.  These are TV rips, thus they reflect the state the show was in when it first aired on FX.  

You'll have to lodge a complaint with the tv network.

,chipset77,2011-08-25T00:32Z,I just got off the phone with FX. They said they cant do any thing about the censorship of your bootleg download. They did say if you e-mail them some of your info and howlong you have ben downloading they will get back to you.
,TheMightyTHOR,2011-08-25T08:05Z,Every time i try to watch this it skips pretty much constantly. The rest of you seem to have gotten it fine. What am i doing wrong?

,stevemonk,2011-09-24T10:55Z,"I know this is kind of ridiculous, but anyone out there watching these episodes, feel free to critique the show.  I've seen a few episodes and am still on the fence- the show moves pretty slow but some of it is pretty funny, and poignant.  TPBers suprisingly have a pretty good sense of what's good and what's shit- I'd love to hear any replies, even if it's to go fuck myself."
,bebop31,2011-11-05T11:16Z,Fantastic download. Fantastic show. Thanks.  
,PragmaR,2012-01-24T08:10Z,"@politux  Dude, thank you so much for letting us know about the VLC player. You're amazing. Thanks for the upload. Will continue to seed!"
,Fritz.,2012-05-14T03:37Z,"my opinion of the show is its depressing garbage and a perfect example of how you do not want to be when you are 42 years old.

i mean the guy acts like his life is over at 42 and hes falling apart and woe is him..

then there are guys like randy couture who are still cage fighting at nearly 50 years old and in excellent condition still living life to its fullest.

i mean seriously, its just a bunch of self pity and whining. i dont understand how people think this is good."
,Fritz.,2012-05-14T03:43Z,"i mean in episode 2 the guy is like im fat and out of shape because im old and falling apart...

its like no you stupid self loathing piece of shit, you are fat and out of shape because you eat too much and dont bother to exercise , herp derp.

bleh."
,crimson85067,2012-05-27T13:01Z,politux u are a god
,NateDeezy,2012-06-14T21:53Z,"@Fritz. And someone completely misses the point. He doesn't expect people to feel sorry for him, he's putting himself in weird and hilarious situations to make for good comedy. What the fuck would be funny about a guy who is in great shape and whose life rules? You're fucking stupid. Besides, he's stated multiple times that the show is nothing like his real life. He's not miserable at all, he's one of the most successful comedians in the world right now. 

I have a question for you smart folks, is there any way to upload the commentary for the first season DVD set? There's a torrent here that claims to have it but I DLed it and I don't hear any commentary. Someone care to help me out?"
