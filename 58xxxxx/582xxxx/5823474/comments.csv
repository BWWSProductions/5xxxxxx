,dsgjsd2,2010-09-11T23:27Z,I have heard christian metal and this ordeal is probably the christian version of a horror flicks. If your hearts stops in horror  if somebody says the word santa or are exponsing pentagrams in public this is your kind of movie. But most of all the massive failure of IMDB. A 6!!? 2111 of space monkeys or mother on crack?  Thanks for the share though!
