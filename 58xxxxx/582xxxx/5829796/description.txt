These are some books that you may find helpful in studying Mongolian language or culture.
I apologize that these are not in better shape. Some may be missing covers, lack detailed Bookmarking, and none are searchable (not that that's possible for the script books but...).
They are optomized pdfs with Acrobat 9.


File list:
There are 2 versions of the primary Chinese-Mongolian (Script) Dictionary used in Inner Mongolia. One High res, one low.

English Chinese Mongolian (Script) Dictionary

Mongolian (Script) Chinese Dictionary

A Colloqual Mongolian Course (I and II) (Cyrillic) - it moves fast. University style.

The End of Nomadism? - An account of an anthropological/social study of the current state of Mongolian people spanning Russia, Mongolia, and 2 Chinese provinces.

Headless State - a historical Anthropology study of Pastoral Nomadism in Central Asia that debunks some traditional notions of "the Nomad."

Tserenpil's Mongolian Grammar - 4th Edition - an somewhat clunky, awkward grammar of Mongolian. Compare to the (absent from this torrent) grammar of Classical Mongolian. I haven't gotten my hands on it but someone whose knowledge I very much respect considers it superior to this outter Mongolia style grammar of the complex Mongolian Language. In some ways outer Mongolia has lost it's traditional understanding of it's own language, which in a few senses is more "clean" and easy than this grammar.

Mongolian (Script) Children's Book

The Secret History of Mongolia (Mongolian Script) - sorta  crappy modernized rendition - sorry.

Mongolian Culture book in Mongolian Script.
