However, I have a new one that's being seeded now and it's got more in it:)  (More fancy dictionaries:)
Check my profile - the Linguistics and Anthropology. Pick out what you want. I'll only be able to seed it for the next month though, then it'll be seeded only off and on my me though (and hopefully whoever else can:)"
