From Wikipedia:

Pyongyang (published in English as Pyongyang: A Journey in North Korea) is a black and white graphic novel by the Canadian QuÃ©bÃ©cois author Guy Delisle, published in 2004.


Pyongyang documents Delisle's experiences in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, where he stayed for two months. Acting as the liaison between a French animation producing company (Protecrea working for TF1) and the SEK Studio (Scientific Educational Korea) company, he struggles with the difficulties of outsourcing and the bureaucracy of the totalitarian closed state.

The book has 176 pages, two of them drawn by a French colleague ("Fabrice").

It was drawn in Ethiopia, where Delisle's wife was working for MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res.

Delisle does not expect to return to North Korea, writing, "I don't think I would be welcome there anymore."
