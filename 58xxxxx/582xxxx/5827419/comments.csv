People! About winamp... If who uses him. We disconnect his superfluous lotions that the sound was more natural:
1) Service-> Parmetry-> Reproduction: we remove all daws in groupbox ""Sound""
2) In the same window on a tab ""Equalizer"". We put constant good quality and frequency range ISO.
3) Restart of winamp. On TBM there are more than details beautiful it is audible"

Thank you for the FLAC Files.  I just seem to suck at ripping music and tend to always have something go wrong when I do the rip.  Course I used ITunes. Before I got wise and used exact Audio Copy.  

Again, thank you for spending you time to make great quality digital files.  A few of us understand just what a chore it is to get it right.  "
