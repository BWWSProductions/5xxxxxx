,NanoEntity,2010-09-10T14:45Z,"Great game, i recommend getting it.

However the starting tutorial is very long, but after you get done with it.

You get to kill monsters and stuff."
,xilzo,2010-09-10T21:36Z,hey uhm i have like 40 files can someone tell me how to install them? that would be great thanks in advance :)
,crazazn,2010-09-10T23:05Z,"just figured it out. open the very last .rar and you'll find the .cue and .bin. extract both to the same folder, then you can mount the image of the .cue."
,Scroobles,2010-09-10T23:30Z,"Normally when i get games from thepiratebay its just unrar and install, so what do you mean you have to mount the image of the .cue"
,Scroobles,2010-09-11T00:07Z,"nvm figured it out, had to get alcohol 120%"
,NanoEntity,2010-09-11T03:10Z,"WoW the game is amazing, but very hard, when you die in dungeon you only keep 1 item.

Need to be really careful, cant go afk, and wow the mobs hit hard.

Had to buy tons of food for the next mission, its like Dungeon 1-5. very hard.

And its only beginning of the game..."
,jpuff,2010-09-11T04:06Z,"thank you, I was looking foward to the game."
,oSONICo,2010-09-11T13:48Z,Fucking Assholes buy the game a small group made it and u asshole just steal it -.- get some job
,kamioni,2010-09-11T15:11Z,"Buy the game, guys. This developer is small time, and they need your support. If you like the game, please buy it."
,toenob,2010-09-11T18:09Z,Everyone who can buy this game should I'm using this torrent until I have some money to spare for this game. 
,Brozinski,2010-09-11T18:45Z,"Are you guys completely daft? I don't give a shit if a small group made it, guess what? my $20 isn't worth a shit even in a small group's pocket. It sold 100,000 copies on Steam already. I don't give a flying shit if they're a small group, they don't have small money anymore."
,HippieMan,2010-09-11T18:59Z,"@oSONICo
You're on ThePirateBay. We don't buy things. Considering the fact that you're on this website, you're a huge hyopcrite. You're saying you never ONCE pirated anything? You, my friend, are the ""fucking ass-hole""."
,Lonemav22,2010-09-11T20:43Z,How do I get the game to run? mounted the cue and installed but it force closes every time I try to run it. thanks in advance
,Lonemav22,2010-09-11T21:04Z,"Still having issues opening the game, mounted the .cue and Installed but the exe errors every time I try to run it. what am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance :)"
[V],harry711,2010-09-12T09:08Z,"Capitalism, ho!

I bought this and suggest you do the same if you enjoy to it. Decently fun game.

Thanks for the up."
,Jeff1244,2010-09-12T12:59Z,Can anyone upload a half completed or completed save file?
,JARX,2010-09-12T17:23Z,"argh... it installs fine and all, but when I start it and get into the game, it crashes whenever a text box is supposed to appear, I can press ""skip event"", but it's kinda pointless to play it if I have to skip the story...."
,moodude,2010-09-12T19:28Z,"Get this game just to try it. It's definitely worth the $20.00 on Steam.

SUPPORT THESE GUYS"
,Lonemav22,2010-09-12T19:29Z,"@Jarx 
Have you restarted your computer? I was having an error box pop up at certain events during convos and restarted and now its fine! try that"
,moodude,2010-09-14T01:55Z,Is this the demo or the full game? The .exe in the installation folder says Demo
,Father_Meshenski,2010-09-15T04:54Z,"Can't seem to get the game to start. Mounted the cue and installed the game. Some error about the bmpdata.bin. Here's the image I get when I try to start the game.

http://img40.imagefra.me/img/img40/7/9/14/mitsuhide/f_16s7upj32ftm_445e8e5.png

Can't decipher it, lol. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
,petter-Ã¸es,2010-09-15T07:43Z,"Everyone ho says by the game!
I allways download the game first, is it good
i will buy it.
I have been burned before when I buy games before trying them.

BTW. thx for the upload"
,Retooler,2010-09-17T00:32Z,"Hello, today I just downloaded the torrent. Great upload speed and all, but I couldn't see the iso? I unpacked everything on the map as usual torrents but the only things I could see is a .bin and a .cue data. Anyone that can help me?"
,Retooler,2010-09-17T13:17Z,"@Diztar, after I installed it gives a error message that this demo (This can't be a demo right?) can't launch."
,Retooler,2010-09-17T13:55Z,"Hm, fixed it. Somehow there was a ""demo"" in my registery keys and I deleted it. After that you can just install and play the game."
,Vyce,2010-09-18T16:11Z,"@Brozinski:

If everyone thought like that, then nobody would buy anything. The fact of the matter is, every single sale counts. Whether you admit to this fact or not is your problem, you're just making excuses not to buy the game.

I'm buying this as soon as the money's available. If people don't buy games, sequels and other games don't come out as quick or as good. this is common sense. I just come to TPB to download TV shows anyway. They get deleted long before DVDs come out."
,TiTaNsFaN690,2010-09-19T10:49Z,"I'm having the strangest error with my other (vista) computer.

This installs perfectly fine on my windows 7 laptop but it keeps crashing during dialogue on the other. Something like 1.01 recettear demo etc. error.

I tried uninstalling it, deleting all the registery keys associated with it, restarting and reinstalling but I keep getting the same error. 

Any suggestions? Anyone getting this working on a vista computer? Thanks in advance!"
,dothackjhe,2010-09-21T04:41Z,I'm having trouble starting a new game. None of the keys on the keyboard seem to work on mine. Clicking the new game with the mouse pointer doesn't do anything as well. anyone having the same problem as I do??  
,dothackjhe,2010-09-21T04:47Z,Anyone having trouble starting a new game with this one just like I did? None of the keys on the keyboard seem to work on this one. I can't start a new game. Clicking with the mouse doesn't do anything either. 
,ajwX,2010-09-27T03:26Z,"When I install, it says the parameter for the .exe is wrong, so it won't put it in the folder, so I can't run the game. Way to fix this/what's wrong?"
,snyp3r5,2010-10-02T04:57Z,"Hey guys, I'm gonna be seeding this 1:50 ratio. :]"
,snyp3r5,2010-10-03T07:18Z,"guys, if the menu isnt working for you, try pressing Z, as Z is the Primary button in the game, X is Secondary/No/Back"
,tragedyrushh,2010-11-07T00:00Z,Thanks a lot. This game works perfectly ! :D I'm so addicted to this game 
,aensland,2010-11-08T07:00Z,"Great game. Confirmed to work on win7 x64. Worth every dollar I paid to get the legit and patched version.

The big publishers who push out $60 bug-ridden pieces of crap riddled with intrusive DRM should be given the finger. Don't buy their games, don't pirate them.

Indie devs like the ones who produced Recettear, however, deserve all our support."
,kludge420,2010-11-13T11:28Z,"@oSONICo

Hey, stupid cunt, you're on The PIRATEbay fucking retard. Get a clue and fuck off dick licker. I love stupid fucking cunts like this faggot that has the fucking balls to say, ""Buy it you assholes"" but you know this cunt downloads other shit without buying. I hope you die of cunt cancer you stupid whore."
,kludge420,2010-11-13T11:29Z,In fact I WAS going to buy it but now because of you I'm not going to. So your asshole rant just cost the company a sale. Next time you want to open your mouth stick a dick in it instead of talking faggot.
,Dinosars,2010-11-23T06:28Z,"
Seed please?"
,ItsFallen,2010-11-28T07:43Z,How do you mount the image of the .cue?
,megafilipe,2010-11-28T15:23Z,"Amazing game!
Can somebody tellme more games like this one? That has the action/rpg part"
,r3l1,2010-12-23T22:18Z,"stupid question, but what program do i need to install to open this thing?"
,MrQuackers,2011-01-04T12:58Z,"Glad to have gotten this. Tried it as a unlimited demo to see if I'd like to buy it. And... yeah. Its pretty dang worth the money.

Capitalism, Ho!"
,CastorOil,2011-02-09T04:30Z,"Great game, Plan to buy it next time it goes on sale but until then this will tide me over ^^"

,Yenrock7,2011-05-08T12:45Z,I miss PS RPGames which looks like this one. This kind of game is rare in PC.
,MrKn4rz,2011-07-06T01:14Z,"From the Developers HP: 

Does Recettear feature any form of copy protection?

Recettear does not feature copy protection (or ""DRM"") of any kind. Neither Carpe Fulgur nor EasyGameStation believe in compromising the user's privacy and freedom to use their computers as they wish.

Once you purchase the Recettear client, you are free to do with it as you wish (though don't torrent it, thanks) - you may copy it to any location on your hard drive, you may make as many backup copies as you wish, you may even run it from an external hard drive or a USB thumb drive if you so wish (and your thumb drive has the capacity). Recettear is install-agnostic and makes no hooks in your system registry. It has no DRM and no ""restrictions"" on where and when it can be installed.

But doesn't that mean I can just pirate your game?
or
But aren't you afraid of getting pirated into oblivion?

Well, we'll say this: Recettear would be pirated regardless of whether we used copy protection or not. We're adults and we understand that our work will be stolen by someone who doesn't want to pay for it; that's how the Internet works in this day and age. Any prospective pirates who enjoy our work, however, must realize that we can only continue to produce localizations for games - and possibly help foster new projects on our own - if we make enough money to make a living at it.

If you like the game even a little bit, please purchase it. We respect our customers enough to not put any invasive DRM programs into Recettear - we hope the respect will be repaid in kind."
,OmegaDX,2011-08-01T13:56Z,This game works perfectly with my controller!
,doctor_roxo,2012-03-06T18:56Z,"thanks dude, works like a charm."
