I have put this up for on-line gameing only, so all maps are removed to make it smaller,I added the latest video-drivers and with the multicore-exe (works with singlecore to),No install needed just drag out the the folder to were you want it,To start the game open UnrealTournament/System and find the brown/black UnrealTournament.exe and start. See you in game :D
