,Owen_L,2010-09-13T15:56Z,It's the real thing. Great quality and the subtitles are all optional. If you have that strict a no rar policy you're going to miss out on a lot of good stuff. I would rather buy this movie before I was caught complaining on forums on how it was brought to me for free. ;-)
