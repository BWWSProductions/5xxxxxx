,Revalator,2010-09-15T05:18Z,These Videos Are Infected With Trojans or Some Back Door Virus. I wouldn't recommend anybody to download them.

,flow892,2010-10-09T14:18Z,"Revalator, you were right, when I played the last segment (segment 5) of CD 4, a Trojan was executed and installed in my computer.  I couldn't believe it because I had previously scanned it with McAfee and found nothing, anyway I hope I learned my lesson.  I was so eager to watch the videos that I didn't listen to your warning (and trusted solely in McAfee).  Thanks Relavator, I wish I could have your skills to determine when a download like this contains a Trojan.
