Release Notes:
Well....Thanks to both top guys for the video and audio thanks to both!...1st it was to make .avs scripts for the video
files, each file had different angles and contained some slight camera movement...so i used 3 different angle filters
on each file to fix it different ways to get them correct...theirs still some camera movement but really nothing to
worry about...then it was a case of fixing the noise, used a denoise filter a smoothness filter on a really low setting.
After that it was onto the colors, now they changed throughout, from yellow to red vice versa, filtered it all to what i
thought looked pretty good...then added a simple but effective sharpness script just to tighten the edges up a little.
Fixed the resolution to what i thought looked best for the source. The audio had some little noise and a few small problems
Which we fixed. Used a Stereo Filter, Noise Filter, Wave Hammer, Dynamic Processor And some other stuff 
Anyway Subtitles are already Hardcoded English on source for the foreign parts . Theirs still some noise on the audio..
but we filtered it enough not to add any more...but most is gone  Hope you Enjoy alot of work and hours into this one
