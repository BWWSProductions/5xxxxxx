,frodo5555,2011-04-05T00:35Z,"The game works, but when you go to drive Suzuka circuit (Arcade or Events), the game freezes on loading. The biggest problem is that you can't progress in main Events, since Suzuka has to be driven to pass Class: C event, and if you do not pass Class: C event, you can't participate in Class: B & Class: A events. So it is actually Game Over 4 U!

I downloaded this game too (also PAL) and the problem is the same:

Has anyone successfully completed this JB game?  

This game is PAL (BCES00104)

Tnx to Uploader & Seeders"
