,FuzzyBuddy13,2010-12-02T22:01Z,"benny1210 - Same problem.  Works great on my PC but keep getting ""insert disc"" on load on my MacBook Pro.  Looks like it installed fine, but just keeps asking for disk.  I even mounted the iso before launching program, but still asks for disc.  Any suggestions?"
,tkrafi,2010-12-03T11:45Z,"To solve the problem for people running it on Mac

In your ISO, copy the 2 files in the ""Sound Bank"" folder into the Reason folder in your applications

Reason only asks for the DVD to copy these files so if they are already there then it wont check for it :)

1. Drag/Drop Reason 5 > Applications
2. Copy contents of ""Sound Bank"" to Reason Folder
3. Run!

(Incase you need the serial number)
RSN500-0000-465188-WX4B-VTCU-9347"

,Jafar0017,2011-02-10T03:13Z,"Jugz, I am not great with these things. but i believe everything is correct. I have put in a License, but everytime it asks for me to insert the disk. I looked for the Sound Bank but its no where to be found. The file with the extension .EXE does not open correctly. (i am a mac user). I beg of your help!. "
,qcom,2011-02-11T04:13Z,"If someone knows how to get this working on a Mac, if they could post step-by-step instructions from opening the torrent, it would be MUCH appreciated!! :)"
,jimclip,2011-02-17T00:38Z,"OK folks, I'm on a Mac 10.6, here's how to prevent the Please Insert DVD error, as well as the problems I had at first with expanding the ISO.

1. DO NOT USE Stuffit Expander. Instead download ""UnrarX"" (http://www.unrarx.com/]. Under Unrarx's ""File"" pulldown menu choose ""Extract"", then browse to the Reason torrent folder and choose the large RAR file. It took my Mac like 3-4 minutes or more to expand it, but once it does, you should have an ISO image in the torrent FOLDER (not on your desktop!!!). Double click the ISO file and it should mount a Reason 5 disk image on your desktop. If not, use the Disk Utility app that comes with every Mac to manually mount it (use ""File > Open Disk Image"" in Disk Utility).

Once the Reason 5 image is mounted on your desktop, here's step 2, which is how to install the program without getting the ""Insert DVD"" message.

1. Inside the Reason disk image, copy the Reason folder to your Applications folder as the icons and arrows suggest. Once it's finished, look back inside the Reason desktop disk image folder, and find the folder that says ""Sound Banks"". Open it and copy the two files inside it to the Reason folder that's now in your apps folder (they should be copied loose in the Reason folder so that they're now alongside the Reason application).
2. Launch Reason, put in one of the Serial numbers, and it worked for me. Copying those two sound bank files to the main Reason folder in my apps folder is what stopped the Insert DVD message I was getting initially.

To clarify, you DO NOT have to have Toast nor burn the ISO to a DVD (which because of the 8.3GB size would require a blank double sided disk and a burner that supports dual-layer DVDs, which most Macs have now, but it's not necessary unless you want to have a backup copy of the programâ€¦.maybe a good idea if you don't have an external HD to copy the ISO to).

Don't or delete ANYTHING inside the torrent folder until you've helped seed !!!

Hope that helpsâ€¦if it does, SAY SO so other people won't keep asking how to make this torrent work !!!

Thanks to Jugz for this torrent , awesome !!"
,sr148,2011-03-01T22:26Z,"Where do i download the actual Reason application to apply these keygens? I'm very confused, would be grateful if someone could explain all this to me!

,yelofever,2012-04-17T18:04Z,"Hi think this is the same torrent I downloaded in 2009 I got it morning with toast or mount me. But after a few months I tried to open it one day (possibly via rewire) and it asked for the disk and mounting wouldn't work, any way round this withought having to download again. If I want to try reinstall an create the DVD for real what reason files do I delete from the mac and how do I go about burning the disk. Missing all the routing possibilities of reason. Plz help."
