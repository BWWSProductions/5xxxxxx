Amazing doc about Shaolin Temples as well as some wushu performed by a young Jet Li. This movie show some of the forms that the Shaolin temple is so famed for. Even some of the stuff you always heard about but not sure you ever really believed. A must for anyone interested in martial arts.

(this is a serious documentary made by the chinese goverment and not any of these light-infoed discovery/history channel programs)
