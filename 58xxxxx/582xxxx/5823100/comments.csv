Downloaded this torrent, and installed CandyBar by dragging it to Applications folder. Then quit out of CandyBar, and opened up a new finder window and went to nickdavies/Library/Preferences (nickdavies being the name of my user account) and copied the com.panic. file into there, replacing the original. Boot up CandyBar again and Voila! A working CandyBar app, I've had problems with the last few I've tried to download of this application, although this has helped me out a lot. 

Bit disappointed that there are 5 leechers and 15 seeders and nobody has left a comment on this torrent. Thanks for upload axel879! Much appreciated."
,Liena_x,2010-10-17T01:01Z,"Great dl, worked fast. Awesome, actually. There is a warning after you open Candybar though about updating the program or proceeding at your own risk. It's a little unsettling. I assume trying to update will ruin the crack, but still, that warning stays and it's bright yellow which is kind of distracting and makes one a little anxious.

But thanks for the great torrent."
