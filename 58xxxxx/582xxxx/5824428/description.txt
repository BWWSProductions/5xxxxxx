The show was originally scheduled for 13 March 1976 (see Dan's ticket stub).  However, the ticket was printed before the tour was confirmed, and the concert date was then booked for 17 April.  The attached ad for the 17 April show that states that the tickets for 13 March show would be honored.

Then the 17 April date was postponed.  The reason for the show's second postponement was because keyboardist Ken Hensley left the band and flew back to London on 17 April.  Hensley was fed up with singer David Byron's drinking problem, and planned to quit the band. Uriah Heep's manager Gerry Bron convinced Hensley to return to the band and give Byron one last chance to sober up.  Hensley returned to the tour, and the Boston show was re-scheduled for 6 May (see Dan's ad clipping).

The Boston show was the last night of the 1976 US tour, and the last US show with David Byron in the band.  Byron continued with the band for their European tour before he was fired from the band due to his drinking problem.  Byron's last show with Uriah Heep was at Sportspalace, Bilbao, Spain on June 25, which was John Wetton's last show as well.  

Thanks to Dave for his assistance with sorting out the chronology.

Dan Lampinski recorded over 100 concerts in the Providence/Boston area, mostly between 1974 and 1978. His earliest recordings were made with an internal microphone deck, and though they are somewhat lo-fi compared to his later work, some very great moments in rock history were captured for posterity. In late 1974 he bought a Sony TC-152SD tape recorder, a Sony ECM-99 stereo microphone, and began using Maxell cassettes. He was also fortunate enough to have a friend who provided excellent taping seats for many shows, resulting in high quality recordings. In 1977, he switched over to a Nakamichi 550 tape recorder, two Nakamichi CM-300 microphones, and continued using Maxell cassettes.

He recorded many of the major 70's bands: Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Queen, Blue Oyster Cult, Frank Zappa, Jethro Tull, ELP, Kiss, Black Sabbath, The Who, Al Stewart, Alice Cooper, Jeff Beck, Bruce Springsteen, Supertramp, Jean-Luc Ponty, Moody Blues, Neil Young, The Faces, Rush, Rick Wakeman, Kansas, as well as several "under the radar" acts.

Since Dan never traded copies of his recordings, they are all essentially uncirculated. Some copies were made for friends, but these releases are the first time most of these recordings have ever seen the light of day, and are direct from his master cassettes. No EQ'ing has been done to any of the transfers. Feel free to EQ, matrix, patch, etc and re-post if you like, just give Dan credit for the original recording.

Dan was very meticulous about taking good care of his tapes and is very pleased that these recordings will now circulate among the trading community. Please honour his kindness and generosity by sharing these recordings freely.

The transfers are available as 16bit/44.1KHz flac files suitable for CD burning, and also as 24bit/96KHz flac files for those who prefer the higher resolution.

Always remember - the more generous you are with your music, the more it comes back to you.
