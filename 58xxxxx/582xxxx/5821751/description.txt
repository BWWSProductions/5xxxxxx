     "Little Wing" is a song written by Jimi Hendrix. It was first recorded by The Jimi Hendrix Experience on their 1967 album "Axis: Bold as Love". It is ranked #357 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of "the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time". "Little Wing" is played using the unique chord/melody guitar style that Hendrix developed during his early career stints in rhythm and blues bands. In this style, the guitar sounds as though it is playing two parts. This is done by simultaneously playing multiple complementary notes, often parts of chords, and then changing a note within the chord to create a melodic effect, similar to "Wish You Were Here" by Pink Floyd and "Gimme All Your Lovin'" by ZZ Top. The unusual flanging sound of the lead guitar part is a result of the Doppler effect which is created using a rotating speaker cabinet, or Leslie speaker.
