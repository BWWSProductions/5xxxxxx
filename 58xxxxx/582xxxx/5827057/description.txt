File Management for the Paperless Office
One of the highlights of FileCenter paperless office software is its "electronic file cabinet" layout with drawers and folders. The file management is so clean and intuitive, some users buy FileCenter for the file management alone. But combined with scanning, OCR, and PDF features, FileCenter Professional becomes a total paperless office workspace. FileCenter doesn't change anything about your files, it just helps you work better and smarter.

Scanning and OCR for the Paperless Office
When you need to quickly turn paper into searchable PDF, FileCenter paperless office software is there for you. FileCenter will scan to searchable PDF in a single mouse click. FileCenter Professional also adds automatic document separation and saving for scanning-intensive offices. And for the times when you only want the text of a document, it will scan directly to your favorite word processor or pull the text out of an existing file. Lucion's paperless office software makes a perfect assistant for any paperless office or home user

PDF for the Paperless Office
As PDF becomes the standard for sharing files and archival, FileCenter paperless office software is there to make it easy for you. Besides scanning to PDF, you'll be able to open and read PDF files right in the FileCenter interface. FileCenter Professional adds even more PDF convenience: convert files to PDF with one click, email files as PDFs without converting them beforehand, combine PDF files with simple drag-and-drop, split PDF files without opening them, and rearrange PDF files in FileCenter's special PDF workspace. Most of your common PDF tasks are available to you in the same paperless office interface where you manage your files
