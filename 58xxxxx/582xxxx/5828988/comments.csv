Thanks for doing what you do. It's a selfless service that those like you provide, in choosing to give of your time, energy, knowledge, etc......to the needy or/and ignorant masses like myself. It's greatly appreciated!

I have a genuine COA for Windows 7 home Premium. Can I use it to authenticate/legitimize this copy (by the means that the makers intended)?

I ask as it would be a total waste to have it but to never use it (and, by doing so, perhaps have to deal with some combative anti-piracy, etc, issue from Microsoft at X point down the line)?

If it is possible what (if anything) would I need to change to this installed download?

Thanks!"

,Pessa666,2010-11-26T04:15Z,"hi all, first i didn't dl this file but reading the troubles peeps getting i would like  2 comment..

i use ultraiso. if i want 2 install on a machine that has no dvd like a mini laptop or such i use ultra  iso 2 extract the iso too a flash disk, make sure it is big enough for the windows u are installing and check if it is formatted correctly for your machine.. that means some bios do not take ntfs format so 2 be on the ssafe side for older machines use fat. for burning a file like this i use nero and set the burn speed at minimum. any other iso program with build in burn option can handle this task, like i mentioned i use ultra iso and it uses nero 2 burn so i prefer 2 just use nero directly so i can set the brun speed manually.
a minimum burn speed will make the dvd more reliable. I got nero 10 from a amazing torrent site called ""The Pirate Bay"" same for ultra iso. btw ultra iso also replaced my deamon warez cuz of it's virtual drive option, any other iso like a game or microsoft Office 2010.iso can be directly mounted and installed, you can also adjust iso files or make a rip from an existing dvd or such..
hope it works out for all.

You Only Need Too Burn 1 File, That Is The .ISO File :)

You Can Burn The Activation Program & The ""Keys"" .Txt Document Onto A Separate CD :)

But Keep The Activation Program & The ""Keys"" Document In The SAME Folder Or Activation Will Not Work.

The Type Of Windows Installation You're Wanting Too Do Is A Upgrade Type Installation.

After The DVD Is Burned, You Will Need To Start The Installation From The Desktop Not By Restarting Your Computer.

Click On Your ""Start Menu"", And Click On ""My Computer"" Right Click On The DVD & Click On Open.

You Will Need To Start The Installation From There, And After Windows Installation Is Complete....

All Of Your Old Files Will Be In A Folder Named ""Old Windows Files""

You Will Find All Of Your Old Files Inside Your Main Hard Drive In That Folder :) :)"

,Nicksta94,2011-01-17T11:28Z,There are plenty of seeders on this torrent. Shame they are all seeding at 0.1 kb/s. I'm connected to 300 seeders and I'm getting 15-40 kb/s. I'm in for a hell of a wait aye.

What's Going On? :)

""llordmikle""

Yeah If Your Product Key Is For Windows Vista Home Premium (Service Pack 2) Then Yes :)

Because The Serials Change From Service Pack Too Service Pack That's Outa My Hands.

@pampjuice

It sounds as though you're trying to boot from your desktop instead of the DVD drive, go into the bios settings and change to boot from DVD, if you're not sure how, have a quick look at this website: http://www.simplyguides.net/guides/boot_from_cd/boot_from_cd.shtml

Hope that helps."

what i did:
1. downloaded driver solution(transfer it to a usb flash driver)
2. mounted it in deamon tools (i had windows 7)
3. ran a normal setup for os. ( you will get the windows.old, but thats for backup but just delete it later)
4. then i just ran the dirver pack solution and everything works ! thanx dude !!"
,Rech94,2011-12-31T18:29Z,"hi guys! This worsk perfect so tell you how to install this easy
step 1: download driver pack solution and place it on a usb flash drive.
step 2: download deamon tools
step 3 : mount this file in deamon tools
step 4: just run the instalation, but it dosent work to upgrade. but that is kinda good because you get the windows.old folder at your programfiles. if something goes wrong you just start the rollback
step 5: run the driver solution and then you get wireless network and everything ! 

so guys enjoy ! (Y) "
