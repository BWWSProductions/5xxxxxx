Edith Head: The Paramount Years (2002) 
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343621/

Edith Head (October 28, 1897 â€“ October 24, 1981) was an American costume designer who had a long career in Hollywood that garnered eight Academy Awardsâ€”more than any other woman in history.
Head was known for her low-key working style, and unlike many of her male contemporaries usually consulted extensively with the female stars she worked with. As a result she was a favorite designer for many of the leading female stars of the 1940s and 1950s: Ginger Rogers, Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Shirley MacLaine, Anne Baxter, Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor. Head was frequently 'loaned' out by Paramount to other studios at the request of their female stars. She was known for her restrained designs, and during the 1950s was dubbed the "queen of the shirtwaisters" by her detractors. However, it should be noted that this approach to costume design was in line with studio policy which did not want films (especially late release or re-released films) to become instantly dated through the use of short-lived costume fads. Despite this, or even because of this trait, she has been cited as one of Alfred Hitchcock's favorite costume designers and had a long association with Hal Wallis among others. Head had been famous for her work with Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday. She designed the costumes for many of the solo films of Jerry Lewis while he was at Paramount.
