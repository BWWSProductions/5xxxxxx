RBT, a compelling new series that goes behind the lines of the NSW Police force on random breath testing operations. From major roadside drink-driving operations and mobile breath testing to high- speed pursuits and drivers under the influence of drugs, RBT, narrated by Andrew Daddo, captures all the drama and danger that police face every day in their relentless campaign against drink driving.

As well as covering traffic operations RBT heads out to sea with the NSW Water Police who patrol the waterways where the blood alcohol limit is the same as on the road - .05.
