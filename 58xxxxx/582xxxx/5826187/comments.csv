,hauntnut,2010-09-19T02:31Z,"Audio and video quality is solid; a bit dark in a few spots, but for the most part you still decipher what's onscreen. There's a few moments of Japanese dialogue with no English subs, but this is a ""Resident Evil"" movie, so it's all about the action. And as far as the previous post about the runtime, I can confirm that this is the entire movie; the only thing missing is the end credits, which would account for the shortened runtime. Great job!"
