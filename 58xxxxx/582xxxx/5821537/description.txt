Ghost Hunters - S06E12 - America's First Zoo (FIXED)
----------------------------------------------------

I posted this to a.b.p & the nzb to a.b.m... I didn't know it got screwed up when I encoded it. I redid it and it all looks fine now. The part isn't missing anymore. I'm adding a sample so you can see the quality too.

I had to redownload the MP4 files to redo this. I don't know what went wrong before. I'm redownloading part one again now too so i can encode a good sample for you guys too.

If you are a video freak: its not perfect. If you aren't a video freak: you may notice a few issues.
The interlace issue, I tried to resolve it but I couldn't. Its pretty good quality though.
