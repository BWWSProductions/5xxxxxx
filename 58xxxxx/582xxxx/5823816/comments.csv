,KevanGC,2010-09-12T10:16Z,Thanks! This is awesome!
,KevanGC,2010-09-12T11:23Z,"Can you please make the torrent faster?

I had to kep restarting the uTorrent."
,Theminkman,2010-09-12T19:47Z,"@KevanGC - Sorry, the speed of the torrent depends entirely on who seeds after they download. If everyone seeds after downloading, everyone else will have faster downloading speeds. It looks like five people downloaded this torrent and then ""cut-and-ran""."
,KevanGC,2010-09-12T23:16Z,"I got it, it just took a long time. but thanks. I don't really know what seeders or leechers are. But thanks anyway."
,Theminkman,2010-09-13T04:32Z,"KevanGC, 

When you download a torrent, you are downloading separate pieces of the torrent from everyone else that has the torrent on their computer. Those people that are providing the pieces of the torrent are called ""seeders"". Seeders are good, because that means you can download more pieces faster, since more people are providing the pieces. 

When someone downloads the torrent and then stops ""seeding"", either by turning off BitTorrent or uTorrent or whatever, or by moving the file or deleting the torrent, the pieces from their computer can no longer be provided to other people trying to upload the torrent. These people are usually worthless to the torrent world, since BitTorrent would be nowhere if seeders did not exist.

So next time you download a torrent, remember to leave your torrent application on so others can download the torrent faster."
,KevanGC,2010-09-14T00:20Z,Okay I got it. I'll leave torrents open for as long as possible.
,KevanGC,2010-09-14T11:16Z,Rucka's real nuckas are the ones who upload to thepiratebay.
