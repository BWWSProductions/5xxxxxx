FANTASMO by Cornelius

A companion piece to Japanese Avant-garde rock musician Cornelius' classic 1997 album 'Fantasma'. 

I realised there was enough good material released alongside Fantasma to create an entire new album, so that's what I've done. I've included a couple of remixes not on CM, some things he produced for other artists, some B-sides, some tracks that were live-only- it holds together nicely and feels like a cohesive body of work. Enjoy and seed for others.
