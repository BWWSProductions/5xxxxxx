Rica (Judy Ann Santos) and Cecil (Sarah Geronimo) are sisters who grow up with their Lola Amor (Gina PareÃ±o) while their parents work abroad. Rica takes her role as the big sister seriously, more so when Cecil gets hurt in a minor accident. She breaks up with her boyfriend, Bong (JC de Vera), and vows to devote her life taking care of Cecil.

The close relationship of the sisters starts to change when their parents return home tenyears later. Unlike Cecil, Rica does not warm up to their parents easily. She even gets jealous that they are taking over her role as guardian to Cecil. Things get worse when Cecil starts working and meets Edsel (Luis Manzano). Cecil tries to reach out to her, and tracks down Rica's former sweetheart for her. However, the gap between the sisters has become too wide, and a drastic change has to happen to set things right again.
