,Yngwiedis,2010-09-16T20:52Z,"What do you mean ?
PS JB is not a usb stick with files inside.
Its a programmable chip.
You cant do whatever you think you can."

,poeticpyro,2010-09-27T02:32Z,"I cannot seem to get the game to extract.  Keeps saying its ""verifying authenticity"".

I've never seen this happen before.  What's the deal?"
,summerHereKids,2010-09-29T02:20Z,"doesn't work for me,
i can see the intro movie, but after that the screen goes black and nothing responds...

i'm using the ipod nano/rockbox jailbreak, any suggestions?"
,zardoz78,2010-09-29T11:38Z,"It does not work for me (same problem as summerHereKids) when I put it on an external hard drive, but after copying to the internal it works just fine."
,summerHereKids,2010-09-29T21:01Z,"@zardoz78

thx, i'll give it a try"
,summerHereKids,2010-10-01T16:25Z,"to copy to yr internal hd, use the open manager 1"
,coleix,2010-10-08T05:55Z,"@summer use ftp, you should find a GAMEZ folder inside hdd0/games/LUA12345\GAMEZ or something like that."
,azzlips,2010-11-21T14:40Z,"Internet cable plugged in, used off external hard drive and loaded through Gaia Manager 1.03.1, it loads/copy about 3.7GB data, starts the intro video but controller becomes useless, after the video screen goes black and ps3 hangs up. Tried it one more time with network cable unplugged but same result.

2nd time around I copied the data on internal hdd0 using Gaia, launched through ""*/app_home/PS3_GAME/"",  Works fine, tried top spin school for 5 minutes, thank you. 

I have PS-Jailbreak2 I have no idea how to find out what's on it but would highly appreciate if some one could tell me how to find it so next time I can write what payload I am using, thanks. "
