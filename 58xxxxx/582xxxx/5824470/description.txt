A routine investigation quickly turns into a battle for survival against both the freezing elements and the terrifying evil that inhabits the lost ship. Cryostasis takes players on a terrifying trip into the unknown as they explore the dark, frozen, claustrophobic corridors and unlock the shocking secrets of the North Wind.
