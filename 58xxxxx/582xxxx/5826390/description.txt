The short animated flashback of his childhood days and the pranks he played on others as a kid is really funny and nice. Then he meets Nisha (Tamana). Krishna falls in love with her and proposes her and also tells her not accept his proposal very easily as there would be no kick in that. She hates him at first for the kind of freak he is but then slowly understands his good part and tries to discipline him. Things go smoothly for a month. Nisha believes Krishna has changed and is working now in a good company. She wants accept his proposal but only then she is told by her uncle that he has been cheating on her and he has not changed. Nisha feels heart broken and starts hating Krishna and they break up even before getting into a relationship. After a year, nisha is in Malaysia and she gets engaged to Krishnakumar (Shaam) who is a police officer and the actual reason behind him coming to Malaysia is in pursue of a thief whom he has never seen. Nisha and Krishnakumar share their stories with each other. While she never wants to see the protagonist of her story in her life again, Krishnakumar wants to meet the antagonist of his story desperately. Co-incedently both the protagonist and the antagonist of their respective stories is the same person and as you guess that is none other than Krishna (Jeyam ravi). What happens then is for you to watch.
