[T],5150EOD,2010-10-12T03:14Z,I use VLC player and don't have a problem at all with being out of sync...try using it!! It also is able to auto sync audio so....
,bollotoral,2012-06-23T16:41Z,"what I still don't understand is why they keep using avi instead of mkv or mp4?? Instead of ripping 175mb avi files you should rip 175mb mkv or mp4 files! We could have much better quality in video and sound in a reasonable size!
People is already used to the 175mb size for a tv show, so please rip in mkv or mp4 in 175mb!! please!! and thanks!
and subs at least in english would be great!"
