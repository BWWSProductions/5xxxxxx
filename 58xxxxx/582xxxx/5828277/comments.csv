Gives me error pop ups."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-15T01:13Z,"@principlemajor 

Sounds like you didn't took the time to read the install notes, so here's a part of it:

Important notes:
************** 
You'll need to install the latest (already included) Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 
Redistributable Package (x86) in order to use the keygen. 

If Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) is not installed then 
the keygen cannot be used, and there'll be an error message that mfc100u.dll 
cannot be found, or other error messages may appear.

,gavilatius,2010-09-17T21:52Z,"ok, I messed up royally. I need to know how to get rid of the registration file (the one that tells that the code is expired) so I can redo the installation and do it correctly."

,MissRoxy89,2010-09-20T01:09Z,"Thanks RobbingHood :)

@Arfen: I don't think there's any way to turn on automatic updates. I guess we all just have to do it manually."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-20T02:02Z,"@MissRoxy89 

Auto-update can be enabled through the settings of VIPRE. Also read this:

You can update (auto or manually) through VIPRE rightaway. For manually updating you've got to update throught VIPRE's system tray menu, 
or throught one of the menus on top of VIPRE. 

The update option from VIPRE's main screen is meant to update VIPRE if the updates are already downloaded 
straight from the site and stored on your pc. "
,MissRoxy89,2010-09-20T05:50Z,"@RobbingHood: Thank you for the quick reply. :) Just to let you know, the settings for auto update is non existant. It -was- available when I freshly installed the antivirus program; but the option disappeared once I activated the license. If you wish, I will upload an image to prove this. Thanks again. :D"
,aansari443,2010-09-21T17:03Z,"Hey, I just download this, followed your directions, but the active protection isn't being enabled...any help?"
,rayder75,2010-09-23T03:50Z,"Nice upload but I have to let you know RobbingHood that the update tab disappears when the lifetime code is applied. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the software 3 times including cleaning out my registry manually but everytime I reinstall and apply the code, the edit settings option disappears on the main screen and the update tab disappears when you go into settings.  They are both there prior to applying the code. Any suggestions RobbingHood or anyone who can help :-)"
,SirMaxy,2010-09-24T20:15Z,"I had the same problem with the automatic update vanishing, but this is what i had to do: first i installed the Â´sunbelt Counter SpyÂ´software and activated it( uploaded by RH ) and then i installed sunbelt vipre premium and chose to upgrade it. after this i have lifetime licence and automatic updates available and can also set proxy settings."
,robblestunt,2010-09-28T00:14Z,"@ SirMaxy - Nice try & what you suggest does give you the auto updates option back on the main status screen - however, when you then try to update or it tries automatically it says you're subscription has expired. You then use the Vipre keygen to input a new code & hay presto, you're back to square one with not having the auto update feature again! Looks like manual update is the only way with this at present - ARSE!"
,abcasda,2010-10-02T03:19Z,It wont let me paste the password into the box. And when I type it out it says the password doesn't work.. help?

,Tatletz,2010-10-09T22:25Z,"@RobbingHood => Thank you for the nice product, all is good apart from the automatic updates issue. I fully agree with MissRoxy89 on this matter. Never mind, we can still do it manually form the system tray menu."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-10-11T00:04Z,"@Tatletz 

See it from the positive side: using auto update just uses unnecessary and precious RAM all the time. So why using it auto update anyway, if you can run it manually. That goes for all apps."
,blando233,2010-10-15T12:42Z,ugh its doing that one thing again if i hit update now it looks for a file. 
[V],RobbingHood,2010-10-16T00:27Z,"@blando233 

ugh ugh ugh .... Cause that's you didn't read the previous posts which says to update through VIPRRE's system tray (right hand below, where the time is)."
,blando233,2010-10-16T16:30Z,hahahaa oooo ok i see what your saying wow..i give u permission to hit me lol..because it did it last time in vipre like i just clicked on update it did..but all well sweet dude
[V],RobbingHood,2010-10-16T22:37Z,"@blando233 

Too bad I forget to add to the install notes that updating should be done by using the system tray of VIPRE. And now most people are confused, which is kind of logical."

The keygen is clean. Without it you can use the program as limited trial only. 

Do some learnings about false positives, and read comments before posting your own comment."

,uberdoku,2011-02-23T03:55Z,"works amazingly, thank you.

the only inaccurate part in the ReadMe instructions (this may have changed since written--or may have already been stated in other comments I haven't read) was that there's no prompt after initially inputting the 00000... activation code. You have to put in the activation code, then continue forward to start utilizing the program. Then go to Help -> Register and attempt the 00000... Activation code once again. Only then will it initiate the ""Registration Code"" prompt. Also, try a few different codes. It doesn't seem to always work the first time.

Thank you once again. Life saver."

,Blacker.Death.Metal,2011-05-24T15:11Z,"Hahaha... The comments here are both humorous and painful.

Since its now on a new page of comments, thought i'd leave one with info people need.

First of all - This works 100% perfectly - If you didn't get it to work, don't post a comment - read the .nfo file - using notepad - and follow the very simple instructions.

Once done, you cannot use auto-updates. To update Vipre, right click the system tray icon, and choose update.
DO NOT press the big update button on the main screen, this will request a file you have to download first.

There is no virus or trojin in the keygen. And yes, of course it gets detected, thats what keygens do. 
Google - False Positive - review, learn, love.

Thanks Robbinghood,
Been using this from first day of post, no issues.

For some people who might be finding vipre killing your cpu when opening folders with shit loads of files in it, disable the option ""Check Files when they are open or copied"" from the settings.

This does not disable active protection, it basically does a full scan of the item. Many people have issues with this setting.
See the Vipre website for confirmation."

,agentmalder,2011-09-14T13:03Z,"I just want to thank the uploader for taking time and patience to upload this. I found no problems at all with the installation. This is largely du to the fact that: I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY!!

For those that are unable for any reason to read the instructions that came with the program, here is what I did:

1. Install Vipre. If it asks you to remove any other incompatible program, remove those other programs then restart your computer.

2. after installation it will ask you to enter a Product key. Fill all the boxes with 5 zero's in each box. Do not enter any information such as email ,name, etc... Restart your computer after installation. 

3. After restarting, open up keygen and enter preffered year then click generate password then copy to clipboard.

5. open Vipre and click Help then register. Again on the top boxes for product key fill all of them with 5 zero's. Then something should pop up then press ctrl+V to paste the code. Hit enter or accept.

Wala!! You have lifetime warranty.

As for updating, at the bottom right corner of the screen, next to the time are quick launch icons. Right click on the Yellow button with the exclamation mark and click update definitions. Then click OK to update.

I do not know if you can update the actual VIPRE program as I have not crossed such an option. but if i find out how, I will let you know how it goes."
,agentmalder,2011-09-19T09:14Z,"Alright, to update the actual software just download VIPRE Premium from their official website. then just install. No need to uninstall the old one. 

NOTE: You will needed to reactivate. Just use another date using the Keygen provided on this torrent. 

Again, another thanks to RobbingHood for another great upload."
,onyxguapo,2011-10-02T04:31Z,"First of all, thank you for this wonderful piece of software.

Second, to enable AUTOMATIC DAILY DEFINITIONS UPDATE, please try using Windows Task Scheduler and create a daily task that will run the progam ""SBAMCommandLineScanner.exe"" from your VIPRE installation folder with the argument ""/updatedefs"".

Hope it works for y'all."
