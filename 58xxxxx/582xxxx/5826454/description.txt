SOURCES:

VIDEO:Russian mpeg files.......Thanks bro  
AUDIO:Resident.Evil.Afterlife.2010.TS.XviD-REViVE.................Thanks and nice work 

NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Resident.Evil.Afterlife

Right......first off thanks for the mpeg files bro.The source itself was a small file and had a low res just like the expendables cam 
we released.We had this a few days ago but was awaiting audio......which now thanks to REViVE we have 
The source file was very dark,rgb colours were off...very yellow looking and of cause once blown up you could see more faults.

Work done.....well firstly took the revive audio stripped it and then just slightly tweaked it in adobe audition and resaved it.
Then for the video we made a script to crop ,resize,white balance,brightness,contrast,sharpen,smoother......then loaded it into vdub and
then we also used the rgb eq filter on it aswell,to balance the colours a touch more.
Then it was a case of just remuxing the new audio file and then packing it up.

Now the quality looks good for a cam ,however it was and is a dark film so some of the dark scenes are harder to see....but we did make it brighter
but if we did anymore it actually started too look worse so ...
Anyway enjoy,what looks like a top flick
