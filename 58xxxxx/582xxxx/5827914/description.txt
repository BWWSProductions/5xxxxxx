The Legend of 1900" is a movie unlike almost any other I have seen. It takes place entirely on a ship at sea, but the action spans more than 40 years. It is the story of a musical genius who is born and lives out his life on board a grand trans-Atlantic liner in the first half of the 20th century. He watches the world pass him by just a few thousand people at a time, has a fabulous piano-duel with none other than Jelly Roll Morton, is sought after by recording companies, and listens to and learns from the music of all the different cultures who are emigrating from the Old World to the New, but he never once leaves the ship. Indeed, the mere thought of setting foot on land is his ultimate nightmare.


It is like that really good book that you start reading one night when it is already too late but are unable to put down until you have turned the last page.
