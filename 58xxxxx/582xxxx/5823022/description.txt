Released on 21/09/09 The Fun Boy Three were formed by Terry Hall, Lynval Golding and Neville Staples in the Summer 81 after the demise of The Specials. In late 81 they reached no. 20 in the UK charts with their debut single The LunaticsHave Taken Over The Asylum, and in early 82 they reached No. 4 in a joint effort with Bananarama called It Aint What You Do. The final single from the album was The Telephone AlwaysRings which also snuck into the top 20.

This welcome and long out of print reissue of their debut album includes 6 bonus tracks - including the non-album single, a cover of the Gershwin classic Summertime and various b-sides and 12 Remixes, one of which makes its CD debut on this release.

This timely reissue also includes new artwork and newly written sleeve notes by Terry Hall fan and expert Paul Rodgers. Terry, Lynval and Neville have recently reformed with their old band mates for a 30th Anniversary Tour as The Specials. The shows so far have had critical acclaim by both fans and the media.

This, along with a new book about The Specials will generate a knock on interest in FB3 for this release. www.cherryred.co.uk
