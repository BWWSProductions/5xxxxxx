The Porn Identity

This is The Porn Identity Podcast. A Podcast that invites you on a light-hearted A to Z journey through Porn itself.

The Porn Identity is a weekly Podcast that begs the question: is there such a thing as too much Porn?

Each week, hosts Jim, Mike, Jay & Sharyn delve into a different category of Pornography (starting in alphabetical order) until they've covered it all.

With special guests, genre-of-the-week discussion, listener contributions, news and segments such as Inside The Actressesâ€™ Studio, Jimmyâ€™s Top 3 List, Probably Around 10 Minutes and more, will they make it?

...the answer is probably not. Still short of Zoophilia, they seemed to have shut up shop at the end of their first season. Still, what we have is a very funny podcast that looks at the dreadful acting, plotting and characters of pornography along with the ruder stories that made the news over the last year.

Included here are all the main podcasts as well as the TPI Minis that were released intermittently while we waited on the season climax.
