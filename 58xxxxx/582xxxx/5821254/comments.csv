,Mr_Stoned_the_bootlegger,2010-09-15T11:45Z,"Many thanks and in FLAC too. The real collectors really appreciate the lossless FLAC format. :-) 

Many thanks once again! "

,naw-t,2012-01-21T06:52Z,"Spectacular!! I've spent hour after hour re-experiencing songs i've only heard growing up, and most i've only heard on the radio or compressed. As a DJ this takes some standards and gives me a pristine quality copy to play. My only complaint is some need normalizing, but i'd rather have them 'raw' then tampered with anyhow! Thank you again!!"
,naw-t,2012-01-21T19:20Z,"I found some artists that are missing: Paul Davis (I go crazy, cool night), Ambrosia (How much I feel), and LEIF GARRETT lol"
,fakerRyou,2012-03-10T14:09Z,"This maybe is FLAC but is merly converted from lossy mp3, I would not recommend download this when i have these songs in 128kbps mp3 that sounds better"
