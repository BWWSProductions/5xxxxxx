GROUP NOTES:
Well here's our v2 of this.....yet again same video source but tweaked differently.....
Made it brighter and a touch more colour and filtered the rgb colours differently....Theres some screens below
that show the difference between this release and our last one.

Now the audio is our own line and we think it's sounds better,got more life to it and nicer levels......but thats just our
opinion.
