"The Return"

Picking up on the same night as last season's finale, 
Elena (Nina Dobrev) arrives home to a nightmare as 
she discovers Uncle John's and Jeremy's fate. At the 
hospital, Sheriff Forbes (guest star Marguerite 
MacIntyre) is comforted by Matt (Zach Roering), 
Bonnie (Katerina Graham) and Damon (Ian Somerhalder) 
while she waits to hear if Caroline (Candice Accola) 
will survive the car accident. After a confusing 
conversation with Elena about the night's events, 
Damon is the first to realize that Katherine (also 
played by Nina Dobrev) has returned. Katherine's 
arrival sends Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Damon on a 
path to find out what she wants, why she's back, and 
how much of a threat she is to the people they love. 
Meanwhile, still reeling from his father's death, 
Tyler (Michael Trevino) is surprised when his 
charming and mysterious uncle, Mason Lockwood (guest 
star Taylor Kinney, "Trauma"), arrives to console 
the family.

Enjoy :)
