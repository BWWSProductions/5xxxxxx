,fakebest,2011-01-30T09:46Z,"@penandpike your the uploader yet you posted ""Where this SIASONS came from?????????"" then ""these are all 6 seasons of LOST"" why did you ask a question to yourself then answer it? and why is season is french as siason is this a french bluray encode? this is all very confusing"
,penandpike,2011-02-12T00:33Z,"My torrent file was named 
 ""Lost-All.Six.Seasons-720p.BluRay.x264.AC3-5.1-PeN""

But when I uploaded it to Pitrate bay The title has changed to 
Lost-All.Siasons-720p.BluRay.x264.AC3-5.1-PeN
And I have no idea where it came from!
It's just a wrong word  ""sIasons insted of the corect seasons"" That's why I was surprised.
I've been trying to edit the title with no luck."
