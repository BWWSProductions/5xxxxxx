Review - This movie was, at times, utterly repulsive, but we were unable to not watch it through to the end. As a couple who despise gratuitous Sex & Violence in modern film, still, we forgave this movie because we were extremely entertained. Great story, dark and suspenseful.

Casey beats out brother Ben again. Only marginal performance was from Simon...who we don't believe in his series either. Young deputy in the closing scenes was fantastic. The ending is fitting and dramatic.

Excellent opening musical version of "Fever" .Anyone know the artist? 3 "had to turn my head away" s...8 overall.

I am also downloading and encoding stuff for you guys like crazy. I am constantly filling up my hard drives, and I am about have to get another 500 GBs. I am doing my best to fill everyones requests, and in the meantime, I am trying expose everyone to my personal taste in tv-shows, movies, and porn. lol.  I am also trying to widen everyones horizons / preferences and help you consider watching things that you might not have watched without someone insisting. (^_^)
