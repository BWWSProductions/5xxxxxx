,icedcurry,2010-09-16T15:41Z,"works great so far. thanks a million dude

make sure you manually download and install a definitions update from sunbelt after registering or it wont work. (google it)"
,drummer94,2010-09-17T07:07Z,"hey, i downloaded everything, but in the instructions it says ""3. Run VIPRE, and click on Help and Registration."" When i run Vipre, i cant find anything that says help and registration... Help pleaseeee?!!! :("
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-20T01:55Z,"@icedcurry 
You can update through VIPRE rightaway, but you've got to update throught VIPRE's system tray menu, 
or throught one of the menus on top of VIPRE. 

The update option from VIPRE's main screen is meant to update VIPRE if the updates are already downloaded 
straight from the site and stored on your pc. 



@drummer94 
On top of VIPRE there's a Help menu. Click on Help and choose Registration."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-20T01:57Z,"@TheArfen 

Yes, you can use auto-update. Also read this:

You can update through VIPRE rightaway (auto or manual), but you've got to update throught VIPRE's system tray menu, 
or throught one of the menus on top of VIPRE.

All the Sunbelt programs at my account are different. Obviously you can't read or are just plain stupid, which would explain why you can't read.

My recommendation: Stop being stupid as soon as possible."

Can you upload this, or post a link to download it from? Thanks"
,kheady,2010-12-21T09:54Z,"I found mfc100u.dll and then it told me I needed msvcr100.dll, downloaded that. Now I get an error when running the keygen that says

The procedure entry point wmemcpy_s could not be located in the dynamic link library MSVCR100.dll

Any ideas and how to fix this?"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-12-31T04:04Z,"@kheady 

Apparently you've missed some notes in the install notes, so read them once more."
