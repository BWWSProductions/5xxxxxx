,Frontline3920,2010-09-12T02:23Z,"In the torrent title it says ""Norton Internet Security 2011 18.1.0.37"" however in the torrent description area it says Norton Internet Security 2010 18.1.0.37.

Which is it? And is there a NTR designed for NIS'11? I have tried NTR 2.9.6(awhile back when I   tried NIS'11 Beta) and it does NOT work. Thanks."

,gwapsako,2010-09-15T14:07Z,"@Frontline...in the event the 90days runs out and there is still no trial reset, just uninstall NIS 2011 using revo uninstaller and clean it w/ CCleaner. Then reinstall the 90 day trial and update.
and there you go! another 90 days! it worked for me w/ NIS 2010 165 day trial everytime "

,TheOneWhoAskes,2011-05-08T23:38Z,Can someone please put up a working key?
,moha80,2011-05-09T11:11Z,"Why are you thanking the uploader since he is so dumb he forgot to tell you that when you get updates the norton will get version 18.5 which corrupts the whole program and you cannot access the settings button again, why are you thanking this dick? uploader please go get a life and flush your stupid torrents down the toilet."
,WolfPunk,2011-07-10T03:27Z,"Thank you for the fine Up, khaled777, and for the 'tip in', roleman13. I've been using this with Intel i7 64bit processors on Windows 7 machines and extending the 90 days trial with absolutely no problems.  As for you, Moha80, the only thing that is corrupt is your fucking brain, which was flushed along with your worthless life which your mommy should have aborted with a wire coat hanger. The direct download needs no bloody key, TheOneWhoAskes (asks?) ignorant questions."
,momboa,2011-08-23T11:51Z,this is 90 days isthere for 180 or 360 days trail
