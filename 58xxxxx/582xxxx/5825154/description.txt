Eduardo (Leonardo Sbaraglia), manager of an insurance company is under pressure and so goes running. It does, especially when you are about to explode. One day, returning from a business trip has been a failure, known at the airport to a man who is presented as a friend and benefactor, and encouraged him to change his life, to be free. It is not a simple invitation, this guy I besiege to the absolute limits to achieve its purpose. Since then, the life of Edward begins to slide into ambiguous territory where the certainties are fading, and running becomes useless. (FilmAffinity)
