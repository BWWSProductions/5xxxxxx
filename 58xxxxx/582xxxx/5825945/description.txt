2010 release from the British rockers fronted by controversial vocalist Skin. Highlights are opener "God Loves Only You", which sets the precedent for a luscious tuneful weight but at the same time is made delicate by Skin's noticeably more breath-y and deeper vocal stylings. Other favorites include mid-tempo Pop Rock confection "The Sweetest Thing", the dark and sensual "My Love Will Fall" and hook-healthy puncher "Feeling The Itch". But the most important thing to understand about this album as a whole is that it is a recorded representation of a band changing and yet somehow still retaining the relevance it once had, ultimately sweeping them into the world of contemporary Rock of all kinds.
