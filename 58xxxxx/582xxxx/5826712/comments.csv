,polkinson,2010-09-14T22:49Z,fails
[T],grimreaper420,2010-09-14T22:55Z,"fails??
I have done everything right.
I am seeding and have peers connecting no problem and the average peer has downloaded 49.8%.
If you cannot download, there's either a temp problem with TPB site, or on your end.
Some people need to appreciate that loaders like me try our best to make users here happy. "
,polkinson,2010-09-14T23:59Z,"Yes, probably, there is problem with TPB site... but, sorry, i don't understand the phrase: ""or on your end"". What does it mean? Is it joke?)"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-09-15T00:25Z,"""or on your end"" means that you are either experiencing computer problem(s) hardware and/ or software conflicting with one another/ misconfiguration of firewall and or BT Client, or improper port forwarding of wired/wireless router.
No joke, just trying to help my friend. "
[T],grimreaper420,2010-09-15T00:55Z,"On a side note...
Adobe released an update for After Effects CS5 Version 10.0.1 >>bug fixes and RED Features"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-09-15T19:32Z,"I couldn't update the torrent as TPB is still working out a few issues, but once you have downloaded this torrent completely, please seed as much as possible.
Currently, my share ratio is 1.014, and avg peer dl is @ 71% ...awesome.

Thank you in advance :)

,ez2down1,2010-09-16T18:14Z,"still not working,  ""No input file specified. ""  message grimreaper420, can you check your up is ok?"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-09-16T18:48Z,"it's TPB their working on a few issues

[T],grimreaper420,2010-09-17T17:16Z,"uploaded 6.59GB share ratio 1.478 i think after today my computer needs a break please seed when you have completed downloading.
I'm sure I've been a pretty generous seeder.
Enjoy, and good luck:)"
,realgoodone,2010-09-17T22:10Z,"I'm stuck @ 99% and can't connect to a seed. It seems that most of the peers I'm connected to are experiencing the same issue. Any suggestions?

(Oddly enough, my ratio is 8.037, so there is a ton of people waiting for this to finish...)"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-09-18T03:04Z,im seeding it again hope this helps.

Only file I have ever tried that isn't working h ere, so I know it isn't on my end."
,schooner52,2010-09-23T04:45Z,"result says...""No Input File Specified"" whatever that means."
[T],grimreaper420,2010-09-25T02:40Z,"im getting that too :( ...i didn't upload this for nothing, once i figure it out or have an answer I'll post soon... ciao"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-09-25T02:58Z,"it's a database error which means it's not my fault or i didn't upload it properly originally when i first upped it there were a ton of seeders (where are you now) and peers connected no problem 09-12-10 and on for a few days easy, now I see this, even comments I've posted is taking a lot longer to show up.
I have no control over these issue(s).
Obviously, TPB is experiencing some sort of difficulty just be patient for people who don't have any.
I'm sure I've been more than helpful trying to keep my torrent(s) up-to-date.
Bye."

,papapavvv,2010-10-09T04:33Z,"When i install Illustrator, i have to enter a key.  the one i input earlier doesn't work. I patch with the activatior, then Illustrator loads as Adobe Illustrator CS5 Try Out, opens, then crashes almost instantly. I tried to run as administrator, but doesn't work either.
I run on win7 64b, installation language: english us, i aslo installed other adobe Cs5 programs and they all work fine"
,DragonRider65,2010-10-20T05:10Z,"I will make a torrent for the entire CS5 Master Collection with KeyGen and ME Activator, although I'm not so sure the Activator really works? The KEYGEN does, though, I have been running this collection like crazy and I am loving it! I have totally fallen in love with After Effects CS5, fuck guys, you gotta try this program, it's unbelievable! (Thanks to Darkman, Zemog and whomever else I was getting the Video CoPilot shit from, they helped with this After Effects love affair man!)
One more thing; for after effects there is a Plug-In that's a MUST HAVE called ""Optical Flares"". I have it with a working KeyGen and Patch. Spyder put out a KeyGen and Patch but someone's anti-virus zapped it and they are still passing off the .rar all over the torrent scene; so when you download that it won't fucking work! Dowbload my Optical Flares Complete (With Tutorials) and TURN YOUR ANTI-VIRUS OFF!!! Otherwise, I promise you it will not fucking work! I did and I am so thrilled, Optical Flares is BADASS!!!"
,emry63,2010-10-23T16:16Z,"Hi Guys,

I have installed it but the Core Key Gen doen't open to allow me to enter the keys. It says I do not have the permission. I have tried to open as as admin but it still doesn't work. Please advise or post a KeyGen that works.

Thanks."
,leftovas17,2010-11-28T04:50Z,has ANYONE gotten this to successfully install AND run properly?
,G-Money615,2010-12-03T00:53Z,The keygen worked the first time. Now the program is tellim me the code is not working. Do you have a way to block it from looking for the key everytime I try to go into it?
,spicy_puerto_rican,2010-12-05T05:10Z,"People, for simplicity just download the Adobe CS5 Master Collection Setup directly from Adobe as a trial.  Enter 1325-1602-2601-0767-1592-0877 for the serial number (just copy & paste this number) at the Setup screen when it asks you to input the serial or continue install in trial mode.

All the problems you guys are having with installing the CS5 Master Collection from here were the same problems I was having cuz it read something like  ""You are missing a file needed for installation of CS5."" 

I got the serial number from www.serials.ws and the serial works perfectly because when I installed CS5 the Setup screen gave me a huge green check mark.

Enjoy folks!
