GENE SCOTT - SEPTEMBER 2010 - UPDATED TORRENT PAK
********************************************************

Awhile ago, somebody posted a "Gene Scott Torrent Pak" which contained only the actual .torrent files (tiny files used by the BitTorrent program on your computer) for all Gene Scott materials that were available on BitTorrent at the time.   The idea was to eliminate the need for interested people to have to go through the time and hassle of having to hunt down and click on links for each and every Gene Scott torrent individually.

A lot of new material has surfaced since that original "Torrent Pak" was posted, so the present collection contains the .torrent files for ALL Gene Scott torrents released to date that we are aware of -- up to and including the "Sept 2010 Third Collection."

Just follow the included instructions and you'll be downloading ALL of Gene Scott's material in no time.
