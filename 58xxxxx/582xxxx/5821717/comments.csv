The show is here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5821714/Rush_in_Rio_Disc1"
,OldSchoolFart,2010-09-14T06:05Z,"Thanks, but RUSH_IN_RIO.part03 and RUSH_IN_RIO.part10 which I have downloaded twice, report as being corrupt.

Has anyone else had this problem?

And if so, how did they fix it?

Thank you."
,TanisHalfelf,2010-09-15T05:55Z,Sorry for the trouble and the time u spend downloading the file... i saw the problem now... I will put another torrent here at this weekend.
,OldSchoolFart,2010-09-15T08:56Z,"Thank you TanisHalfelf.

I don't mind downloading again, as I need Disc 2 for the set.

Please check your archive before posting.

Thanks again.

,OldSchoolFart,2010-09-21T09:30Z,"Was this torrent replaced?

If so, should I re-download the whole archive or has just RUSH_IN_RIO.part03 and RUSH_IN_RIO.part10 been replaced?

Thank you."
,TanisHalfelf,2010-09-22T05:49Z,Sorry for the trouble but i need to find again a program that can create the image. This dvd is protected so i can't create the image.... mine have expired. When i find i will replace.
