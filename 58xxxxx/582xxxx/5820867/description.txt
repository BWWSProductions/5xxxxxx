Plot

A young female martial-arts champion, Cheng Tai-nun (Kara Hui) marries an elderly landowner so the old man can keep his estate from falling into the greedy and unscrupulous hands of his brother Yu Yung-Sheng (Wang Lung Wei). Tai-nun inherits his estate when he dies, and is soon in Canton, staying with her older nephew by marriage, Yu Cheng-chuan (Lau Kar Leung), and his son Yu Tao (Hsiao Ho). When the traditional and conservative Tai-nun, a woman from the provinces, runs into the modern and Westernized Yu Tao for the first time, the sparks fly and a clash of egos begins. Meanwhile, the evil brother steals the deed to the dead husband's estate. Tai-nun and Yu Tao go to get the deed back and are beaten and held hostage by Yung-Sheng and his experts. Its then up to Yu Cheng-chuan and his brothers to rescue them.
