It was amazing to watch Henry journey through Israel and talk with the local people there. It was truly an inspiring documentary and certainly important as well. The imagery was beautiful and the rhythm of the piece wonderfully gelled the stage performance of Henry and his journey throughout the country. I laughed and had tearful eyes. Perfect.
