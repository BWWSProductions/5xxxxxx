HISTORY OF FOOTBALLER SUPPORT
-----------------------------------------------------

One of the questions I get asked a lot is "How did you get started in all this?"

With 24 million footballers worldwide, there are plenty of phone calls, emails and face-to-face visits 

on a daily basis, plus a website now, and it's a question I spend a lot of time answering.

So here is the History of Footballer Support.

How it started, what it does, why it does it, and how it's still here after 30+ years.

Hopefully an interesting read for all Footballers and Football fans everywhere, or Soccer if you 

prefer.
