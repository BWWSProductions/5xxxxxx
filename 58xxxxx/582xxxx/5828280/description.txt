It's a true battle of the bands as tunefully gifted campers Mitchie (Demi Lovato), Shane (Joe Jonas), Jason (Kevin Jonas) and Nate (Nick Jonas) return to Camp Rock and discover that some of their best talent has been snatched up by rival Camp Star, where some serious musical muscle (Matthew "Mdot" Finley) rules the roost. Meanwhile, a Shakespearean love triangle complicates camp life as campers once again vie for the top spot at Final Jam.
