I mean the whole of BLUS30418 folder.

What`s the update folder in it? 3.41? Will it work without it? I`m still on 3.30? Is that a problem?"

Works Great!!!"
,YoSoyYoda,2010-09-15T00:39Z,"I can't get this to work. I have a 3.41 slim, I have PSFreedom successfully up and running and have seven other backups running without problems....I originally tried it on an external HD (yes I know it says don't), and with Stealth Backup Manager (again yes I saw the instruction not to but thought I'd give it a shot) - however even after FTPing the files accross to the PS3 in /dev_hdd0/game/laun1234/ (or whatever the exact directory was) and using regular Backup Manager instead of Stealth I couldn't get it to work.

With every permutation what happens is:

The game shows up, I select it, it correctly appears as the game in the drive. I launch it. It installs to the internal HD as part of it's setup, then it quits back to XMB....On trying to relaunch it the screen goes blank there's a delay then it quits back to XMB. Deleting the installed data for the game causes it to install again but doesn't allow it to load itself......Anyone know where I've gone wrong? As other people seem to be reporting it is working? I'll try resending it over FTP again and downloading a new copy from the torrent....Can anyone confirm the file is working?? Thanks all! Great to see this number of seeds!"

after transfer with ftp
go back to xmb - internet connection and disable internet
hit the game, and u should be able to play without freezing, or jump back to xmb.

enjoy"
,poeticpyro,2010-09-17T02:21Z,"I keep sending it to the PS3 via FTP.  I originally sent it to /dev_hdd0/game which didn't work.  I then tried /dev_hdd0/LAUN12345/GAMEZ which still didn't work.  It doesn't show up under the backup manager.

I am using a stealth manager, but that should NOT matter (even though it states it does).  It must need to go in to a different folder or something, after /dev_hdd0/game...

Anyone have any idea?"
,poeticpyro,2010-09-17T02:59Z,"NOTE:

IT WILL WORK WITH ANY BACKUP MANAGER!

I just got it to work.

When looking at the ftp (I recommend FileZilla-3.3.4.1) navigate to /dev_hdd0/game folder.  You'll see all the BLUS folders (Games) and if you have a backup manager installed you should see one odd one in there (or two if you have an FTP hack like me) that is NOT listed as BLUS but something similar to FTP049483.  Click that.  You should see  a ""BCKUP"" folder and a ""USBDIR"" folder.  Copy the whole game folder to the ""BCKUP"" folder.

BOOM!

Works.

I'm using a stealth manager and got it to work."
,OFW,2010-09-17T08:01Z,"Thanks to the uploader!

To play the game, you need a jailbroken PS3 on 3.41 firmware plus a backup manager. Extract the files then transfer the folder BLUS30418 to /dev_hdd0/LAUN12345/GAMEZ via FTP."

,michaelkbh,2010-09-23T12:23Z,"Hi ppl. I finally got this s*Â¤@-game working :-) I have tried for so many hours. I have the PSJailBreak USB Dongle and the game was in the right folder on the internal HDD of my PS3. (/dev_hdd0/game/LAUN12345/GAMEZ/BLUS30418/)but it did not work. First I had the same problem as 'YoSoyYoda'. I disabled internet as 'Ganlinia' suggested and that gave me around 1 more sec. with the game startup-text before going to blank screen. I looked for the folder 'BCKUP' as 'Poeticpyro' said, but i do not have this folder. I tried 4 different BackupManagers (2 Stealth and 2 others) and nothing worked. I was getting a little pissed, so i totally formatted my PS3 HDD. Transferred the game by FTP again and installed the first/original BackupManager and disabled internet and pressed the game icon... Yiippieee.. It works. Dont really know why the HDD format did the trick but it did. One last thing is that i have noticed that it is always the games i download packed in ISO files that have problems with my dongle. I found this program : http://teknogods.com/?p=445 that is maybe worth a try, but when i found it i had already deleted the images, so are downloading 35GB images again to test :-D"

,6oxtynin9,2010-09-26T22:54Z,"@hypno777

You can't. The moment you've upgard firmware past 3.41, you've lost the ability to exploit the system. 

And to all the people who downloading this but do not know what to do with it or know how to exploit your PS3, make it easier on yourself, DO YOU DAMN RESEARCH and figure it out yourself. No one is here to spoon feed your ass and you're just taking up room for those who REALLY has to comment about the game or problems. 

If you're not smart enough to use the Google search engine, you should not be tinkering with hacking/exploiting the PS3 as you can brick or seriously damage you console."
,angloaxman,2010-09-28T10:06Z,"Ok people that are having problems, heres a tip on how to make sure it works. If your transfering the game file to your ps3 via ftp you will need the game ID to be the proper BLESXXXXX ID . You can find out ps3 game ids by using the program ""PS3SFOEDIT"" and navigating to the .sfo file in the game folder of your extracted game ISO. Rename the main folder so that it is like this. So if your using ftp to transfer this game should be like this â€˜dev_hdd0/game/LAUN12345/GAMEZ/BLESXXXX/PS3_Disc.SFB , PS3_GAME, and PS3_UPDATE.â€™ 

And Not: dev_hdd0/game/LAUN12345/GAMEZ/Red Dead Redemption/PS3_Disc.SFB , PS3_GAME, and PS3_UPDATE. Once FTP has finsihed then load backup mager and boot the game, depending on what version of backup manager you have you may need to put a retail game disc in the PS3 BR drive for it to work. ANd be very careful not to select yes to any updates whatsoever. My advice is every time you finish an FTP transfer you should disable the internet option on the PS3."

- Using Filezilla(latest) and my PS3 running FTP blackbox (v1.2), I transferred the game folder by folder individually into the /dev_hdd0/game/LAUN12345/GAMEZ directory.

- The backup manager i used was the one that was patched for no-disc support.

- Game plays flawlessly whether internet is on or off

,Marko1994,2010-10-13T23:59Z,"Full Guide to Install Game:

Download: FileZilla (PC Or Mac) and FTPserver
 (Search Google For links)

1) Unzip the files on the torrent
2) Connect your PS3 to a PC with an Ethernet Cable
       -IF you are connected to the internet wirelessly Then connect the Cable
         go on your computer to Start>Network and Sharing Center>(on the Left) Choose
        Manage Network Connection> you will find your local area connection and wireless,
        Drag your mouse on the two then right click and press ""Bridge Connection""
3) On your ps3: Install the FTPserver, Then go to network settings and set the connection to Wired, no open the ftp server and choose start ftp server
4) on your PC install filezilla, then open it up, in the upper bar you will see an IP address field
look on your ps3 and you will find the iP address copy it, then write FTPD12345, leave the password field, then type 21 in the port field and click connect
5) Now you have access to your internal Hard Disk, on the right side navigate to /dev_hdd0/game/LAUN12345/GAMEZ, then on the left side navigate to your downloaded file (name something like ""BLU23o423"" and drag it to the right hand side, it will take a while to finish
6) Finally after finishing copying to your internal HDD go to backup manger and you will find it

,sudeus,2011-04-19T17:06Z,"Hey, please help me I'm dying here :)

I've been trying to get this to work.. and it did!(partly)... :(

The things that I did:

First, I copied the files that were extracted to my external hdd. 

Next was to put my external hdd on my PS3. 

Then, I opened Rogero Manager and copied the
file from my external hdd to the PS3's internal hdd.

After that, The game was installed.. and it worked(kinda).

The game loads, runs, but just until the game select mode, when in you got to choose whether you push sqaure(for online gaming), X(for single), I don't know what the other one was.

Please help me, I'm dying :))"

I GOT IT TO WORK ON MY PS3 KMEAW 3.55.
AND I AM PLAYIN REDEMPTION FROM MY 500 GB FAT32 EXTERNAL DEVICE.
YES!!! U DONOT NEED TO TRANSFER THE GAME 2 INTERNAL HDD.
JUST USE THE NEW MULTIMAN multiMAN ver 2.00.03 BASE (20110529_223000) (with SHOWTIME) WT::
BUT U HAV TO DOWNLOAD BDEMU2-355.PKG (just google it).
launch multiman and connect ur external device it show the game(the game must be split using split4g). CHOOSE GAME SETTINGS BY PRESSING TRIANGLE AND IN THE LOWER LEFT CORNER CHOOSE EXTERNAL AND UNSELECT THE REST. NOW JUST GO BACK TO MULTIMAN MENU AND CHOOSE THE GAME and it would ask u wether 2 save cache files to internal or something...choose yes and proceed,,
at the end u will get to play the game from ps3 xmb by choosing NO to 'whether u want to play game without exiting to xmb'.
just follow my way and get the game to work.

,sarihaddu,2011-08-06T18:55Z,"Thanks friend.  This thing works perfectly on PS3 320 GB slim.  3.55 firmware, i donno how it was hacked but it uses multiman and lv2 patcher.

I copied the game to the internal harddisk by using an ethernet (no need cross over cable) cable in just under 5 minutes.  The settings is as follows.

I configured Manual IP on my PC by going to Network connections, change adapter settings, then right clicking Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)

Then on PS3 install your Blackbox FTP server and enter these settings in your network settings, which is located in system settings

Internet Connection = Enabled
Connection Method = Wired Connection
Speed and Duplex = Auto-Detect
Address Settings = Manual
IP Address = 192.168.1.2
Subnet mask = 255.255.255.0
Default Router = 192.168.1.1
Primary DNS = 192.168.1.1
Secondary DNS (Leave Blank at 0.0.0.0.0)
MTU = Automatic
Proxy Server = Do Not Use
UPnP = Disabled

Save (dont click on test settings now). Launch your FTP on your PS3 and it will give you a IP address to enter into FlashfXP which will be 192.168.1.2. 

And then your in! Thats how i get my fast transfer speed 30 to 40 MB per second. Directly connect your PC to your PS3 it will be better.

This will work for Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.

Hope I helped you."

,mikesoft,2011-10-26T06:27Z,"Can anyone help me? I've helped tons over pc games, but I just got the PS3 and I've been wanting to play this game since it got out like 2 years ago.

I'm not asking ""how"" to get this to work on my ps3. All I want to know is if by making this game run on my console, can I get banned somehow? I'm willing to d/c the ethernet cable if needs be, I just don't want my psn account banned for life, as I love playing online and i'm sure I'll buy original games forever. Just this one, I can't afford for the next month or two, I'll get it used from a friend, but I want to play it know! So, is there a possibility to get banned from psn if I install whatever hack is needed to play this?

Thanks!!!"
