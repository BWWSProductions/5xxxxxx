,rrlbva,2010-09-13T04:04Z,"Video is good for a TS.
Audio has too much hiss.

Im filtering the hiss & bumping the low-end and vocal levels in Adobe Audition for my own use, will probably share the audio track on TPB......"
,rrlbva,2010-09-13T05:36Z,"Here you guys go, thank me later.  Optimal hiss removal & equalizing done via Adobe Audition.
You can use YAMB & MP4Box to put the audio track with this torrents video track together. Enjoy pirates!!"

,ManuelRivero,2010-09-14T00:07Z,Is the audio better than Prism's version?
,ab23shotty,2010-09-14T04:07Z,good copy a/7 v/8
,rrlbva,2010-09-14T08:50Z,"@ManuelRivero 
My audio is better then them all because I don't put up with the crap that the scene releases. Consider yourselves lucky that I even released this as I usually keep it private for myself & friends. I just happened to feel generous this one time."
