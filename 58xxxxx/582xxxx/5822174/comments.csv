,r0ttiem0m,2010-09-22T07:16Z,Thank You so much for this.  Will seed for U while I can.  
,PIRATE-555,2010-10-12T05:56Z,"Hello!  I'm sorry but this MKV file is too broken to watch.  The audio tracks appear to be fine.

I use Windows 7 and Windows Media Player Version 12.0.76.

I also tried to view with VLC Version 0.8.6f, one of my favorite viewers but that didn't work either.

Fellow Pirates, don't let this comment discourage you!  Apparently it plays fine for ""r0ttiem0m"" and it just may be something within my system or perhaps something within Windows 7 itself?

Please try the video for yourself and let us know how it plays for you?

[T],Pongydog,2011-05-16T22:31Z,347MB does seem really small for a 90 minute video file. The quality must be fairly rough.
,robbin505,2011-09-02T15:44Z,x264 is a wonderful high quality HD codec.  It works on the same principle as other codecs like .avi where only moving images get refreshed and unchanging backgrounds do not.  It creates a smaller file without losing image quality.  720x480 with 30fps is really pretty good.
