Thank you for sharing these amazing lectures
but can you compress them and then share? They are huge and takes several weeks to download a course completely..."

Sorry, I share it as I find it on other sites. I agree they are large, but compared to the original dvds it's compressed and I think too much compression would hurt the quality. If you're concerned about the size, I'd suggest downloading the audio rather than the video versions."

Just a heads up - After downloading and seeding this and another TTC vid, I received a warning letter from Comcast (copyright infringement, blah blah blah).  Is this normal or just a formality CYA on part of Comcast?  Do the actually cut services?  Also, what is the best way to hide my ISP address?

Thanks again dohduhdah for the great torrents."

Having said, it would be nice to have a file for just the audio, but I can't find one.
And, thanks very much dohduhdah."
