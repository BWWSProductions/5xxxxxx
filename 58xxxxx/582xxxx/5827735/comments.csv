,SmudgeTheCat,2010-09-14T00:06Z,This is crap.  Even the serial's in Gothic letters.  Get real.
,SmudgeTheCat,2010-09-14T00:40Z,I take that back. Works great.  Apologies to Anon.
,h3m,2010-09-14T01:57Z,"Correct, works excellent and Serial is fine as well. "
,sadcamper,2010-09-14T04:26Z,Will this be upgradable? Many thanks!
,jberry872,2010-09-14T07:20Z,"//For Some reason i got an error with Disk Image Mounter//

Error.text=[""Not Readable File System""];

HAHA C++ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^"
,zogulusnig,2010-09-14T09:44Z,"Works great.  Thanks a ton, Anon.

Also of note, this installer will download the latest version from Parallels and install that.  As of today (9.14.10), that is version 6.0.11820.602974.

Anyone else think these version numbers are getting out of hand? ;)"
,wadkcaj,2010-09-14T13:32Z,Thanks. Works perfectly!
,jberry872,2010-09-15T00:54Z,"yeah i dont understand how you guys say this is great, i have a ""no mountable file system"" in disk image mounter. I even downloaded the original from demonoid and it really just sucks"
,rubengarciajr,2010-09-15T04:29Z,This works great.  I even downloaded the updated version when installing it.  Thanx
,8317810,2010-09-15T05:43Z,the copy of parallels is currently registered to a different account so don't register when the window pops up just close it and choose never 
,nekid,2010-09-15T08:31Z,thanks.
,toneskeee,2010-09-17T04:41Z,"Works like a charm,even the updated version!But does anyone know if creating an act will afect it in any way or not????"
,Gott666,2010-09-17T15:06Z,"""toneskeee
But does anyone know if creating an act will afect it in any way or not????""

Yes, The Original, Registered, Account Holder, will lose use of the Serial Number, because the Serial Number has been Blacklisted, and thus, we ALL LOSE !!!

DON""T DO IT !!!"
,ibrahimz,2010-09-18T07:01Z,Can anyone post the serial please!?
,MIKNIK85,2010-09-18T17:06Z,It's work with serial. Don't forget to block internet access with Little Snitch
,cgl1221,2010-09-22T19:20Z,If i am upgrading from version 4 will it keep all my programs and files that have been installed when i install version 6?

,lanec42,2010-10-03T01:03Z,It says that the license key is no longer valid. Does anybody... have another?
,lanec42,2010-10-03T01:05Z,"But wait, maybe that doesn't matter..."
,lanec42,2010-10-03T09:47Z,"Nope, woops, it doesn't matter! Works fine!

,a4ur,2010-10-04T17:09Z,"Hey guys, 
After downloading and installing this my windows file keeps expanding and even after making it smaller through the tools in parallels, while my mac doesn't regain any of the memory ""recovered"", and therefore I have already ended up with no memory at all on my mac.
I would appreciate it if anyone out there could help find a solution to this."
,ColdNcursed,2010-10-07T13:19Z,"Just wanted to thank you for the download. Normally I'd purchase the software, however I do not feel 800kr is worth it.. Maybe 500, but 800 is very steep if you ask me. "
,hukne001,2010-10-07T19:45Z,"What do I do after the download is complete? Do i choose New Windows Installatoin, Migrate Windows from PC or use your virtual machines?"
,pc_mac,2010-10-30T15:37Z,the torrent works 100%. better than VMWARE FUSION
,pc_mac,2010-10-30T15:40Z,after downloading the torrent install it. choose New windows installation and run windows soft.

,h2ho,2010-12-23T18:26Z,"Does anyone have the serial? The one given  is ""out of date"". Juste updated from parallels 5, now I'm stuck."
,evo8dad,2011-01-01T05:26Z,Bump for a current activation key. This one doesn't work - KRHPFX-CPGPAN-CG13A9-W7VW5S-AS1794
,ppmarin21,2011-01-26T08:53Z,"Guys, anybody has a Serial number, krhpfx-cpgpan-cg13a9-w7vw5s-as1794 doesn't work, thanks"

,bdubz87,2011-02-06T02:28Z,"people asking for a serial are stupid. DON'T update when it says new software is available, use little snitch to block access to the parallels server. And don't register the product. Works a treat. "
,blueanima,2011-02-09T14:42Z,"only 6.0.11822 can worked.So,anybody,don't update."

,8happy8,2011-03-29T02:56Z,Has anyone tried to use this to upgrade a Parallels 4 installation? 
,purfectjodi,2011-07-15T16:23Z,Still works great ty. Looks like when you DL you have to cancel all updates etc (some automatically starts)... The first time i did it i didn't cancel an update in time and it automatically updated thus was asking for activation key etc... I opt for trial (14 days) then after that was up i deleted parallels & reinstall this copy and canceled all updates! TY again!
