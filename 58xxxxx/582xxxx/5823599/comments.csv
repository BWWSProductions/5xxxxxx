Can you plz up more stand-up? All this stuff is hilarious.

Also,

do you think in each torrent, whether in the description, the comments, or as a .txt attached to each torrent, you could list for us which movies/tv series/comedy specials you are currently downloading or converting or just your list of what you see yourself uploading in the future just so that we have an idea of what is coming next?"
