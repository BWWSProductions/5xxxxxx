Review - Russell Peters... Amazing, Extraordinary, Priceless...

Russell Peters is one of the funniest comedians of the new millennium. is this a stupid question or what? Russell Peters played to 15,000 people at the Air Canada Centre and he\'ll play to 15,000 more many more times so is there anyone else in comedy right now who could sell 30,000 tickets? maybe one other person, right? No i don\'t think so. Prove me wrong?

Russell Peters stand up comedy is its own kind, full of laugh after laugh. I never liked stand up but oh my, Russell Peters takes it to another level with his ability to mimic many accents of South Asian, Chinese, Persian, Italian, Portuguese, Greek, American, Jamaican and Canadian accents really have to be heard to be believed. He has the body language and facial expressions of his targets down pat this is a man who can gesture in other languages. We found ourselves pinching one leg to keep from laughing over any of Peters incisive observations about humanity.

His racial jokes are things you have never heard before, they truly are funniest and truest things you will ever hear. He runs through a dozen distinguishing ethnic characteristics, how Italians insult people by calling them vegetable names, how Indian people pose for photos, how Indians and Armenians are hairy, how South Americans pronounce their country names, who can\'t drink, who gets loud, why Arabs look so fierce on TV. He mocks anyone and everyone, and no one is exempt. One of the funniest segments in his show is a send up of the blind, the deaf and the halt and everyone else with any sort of handicap. You laugh in spite of yourself.

This review cant explain how funny Russell Peters is you have too see it to believe it and i guarantee you will agree with me. Russell Peters is one of the few true comedians we have left and he will make you laugh until your stomach begs you to stop. Red White & Brown is a must see!!

I am also downloading and encoding stuff for you guys like crazy. I am constantly filling up my hard drives, and I am about have to get another 500 GBs. I am doing my best to fill everyones requests, and in the meantime, I am trying expose everyone to my personal taste in tv-shows, movies, and porn. lol.  I am also trying to widen everyones horizons / preferences and help you consider watching things that you might not have watched without someone insisting. (^_^)
