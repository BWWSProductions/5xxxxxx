"Red Light" is a song co-written by Jonathan Singleton, Melissa Peirce and Dennis Matkosky, and recorded by country music artist David Nail. It is the second single released from his album I'm About to Come Alive, and the third single of his career. It has become Nail's first Top 10 country hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.

A music video for the song premiered on CMT on July 16, 2009. It was directed by Roman White, who also directed David Nail's previous video "I'm About to Come Alive". The video shows Nail driving through the countryside in a convertible. Flashback scenes of his girlfriend getting out of his car at a gas station and arguing with him. He is then shown driving through the city, as well as scenes of him walking down the middle of the street.

Matt Pfingsten directed an alternate video for the song, released one month later, which uses an acoustic version of the song.

"Red Light" debuted at #58 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in March 2009. The song became his first Top Ten hit in November 2009 and peaked at #7 in December 2009. On the week ending October 10, 2009, the song debuted at #95 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.
