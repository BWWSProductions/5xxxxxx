The Amazing Race is a reality television game show in which teams of two people race around the world in competition with other teams. 
Contestants strive to arrive first at "pit stops" at the end of each leg and try to avoid coming last, which carries the possibility of elimination. 
Contestants travel to multiple countries around the globe. 
The clues in each leg point the teams to the next destination or direct them to perform a task, either together or by a single member. 
These challenges are related in some manner to the country or culture where they are located. 
Teams are progressively eliminated until three are left; at that point, the team that arrives first in the final leg is awarded a grand prize of $1 million.
