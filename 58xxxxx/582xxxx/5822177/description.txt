John C. FrÃ©mont

In 1838 FrÃ©mont assisted the French scientist Jean-Nicolas Nicollet in surveying and mapping the upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers. He also headed an expedition (1841) to survey the Des Moines River for Nicollet, who had given him expert instruction in geology, topography, and astronomy. His growing taste for wilderness exploration was whetted by the expansionist enthusiasm of Missouri senator Thomas Hart Benton, who became his adviser, sponsor, and, in 1841, father-in-law. Benton's influence in government enabled FrÃ©mont to accomplish within the next few years the mapping of much of the territory between the Mississippi valley and the Pacific Ocean. In 1842 the War Department sent him to survey the route west to Wyoming, and in 1843, accompanied by the colourful guide Kit Carson and mountain man Thomas Fitzpatrick, he completed a survey to the mouth of the Columbia River. After thoroughly exploring much of the Northwest, he made a winter crossing of the Sierra Nevada to California, further adding to his fame.
