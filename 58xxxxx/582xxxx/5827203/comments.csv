The crack works 100% you don't even notice it's there. Thank you very much! Used it to move my $MFT and pagefile.sys to the beginning of my RAID0 and it took over ten seconds off my boot time. Just wow. Will seed this as long as I can!"

,TechGeek2,2011-04-25T17:44Z,Nice app works great. I did have one issue. When using the default icon place on the desktop during instlallation two files were placed on the desktop after closing the app. If I deleted the files I would loose my user settings for the app. I remedied this by first running the app from the installation folder allow the two files to be placed there after closing the app then creating a shortcut of the exe file to the desktop. Hope this makes sense.
