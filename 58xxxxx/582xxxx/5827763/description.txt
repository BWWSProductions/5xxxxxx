Alex arrives in a small town to audit the largest employer, Turnbull Chemicals. All the hotel rooms are full with a convention, so he stays at the run-down Michelle Apartments, in the room of a woman who had just died. He is attracted to Madeleine in the apartment above, until he discovers she has a maniacal husband. Written by Will Gilbert
