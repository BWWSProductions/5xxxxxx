The Zephyrs is an Edinburgh, Scotland-based indie band. They have released five albums and two EPs containing their shoegazing folk-rock style.

Brothers Stuart (vocals, guitar) and David Nicol (bass) had been playing music together for many years before forming The Zephyrs. Adopting the band monicker used by their father 25 years before, they released their first album in 1999.

It's OK Not to Say Anything was released on the tiny Edinburgh indie label Evol and just 700 copies were printed. Small as this release was, it garnered the attention of Scottish post-rock band Mogwai who signed The Zephyrs to their own imprint Rock Action, which was then owned by SouthPaw Records.

In 2001 the band released their second album When the Sky Comes Down It Comes Down on Your Head (which included guest vocals from Mojave 3's Rachel Goswell) through SouthPaw Records to excellent reviews. AllMusic.com gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5, exclaiming "[The Zephyrs] manage to combine the epic grandeur of Mogwai with the country-rock of Gram Parsons".
