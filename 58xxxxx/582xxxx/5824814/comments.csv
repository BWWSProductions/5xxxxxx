,Anjalena,2011-03-03T08:52Z,Great quality for such an old movie. Thank you so very much for posting it. I saw this when I was in about 4th grade and I -loved- it! But it's old and kinda obscure so I never thought I'd find it online. But here it is. I was so surprised! I love this little short story. Thank you!  =)
