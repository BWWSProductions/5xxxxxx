Keep up the great work eztv!  =D
I hope they do a season 7."
,Jack_Raiden,2010-09-14T15:12Z,"@Macwilko: The multiple ""eztv versions"" are the exact same release (see: FQM, file size), uploaded at eztv and multiple times at tpb. They are different torrents with different amounts of seeders, though."
,codyhendrix,2010-09-15T01:58Z,"@Macwilko, @Jack_Raiden... the difference is quality/resolution. Generally speaking the more MB's - the better resolution."
