,Padr49904,2010-09-12T06:28Z,Yeah you can watch it after you complete a survey(which you have to pay for something) and download divx from them which usually means there's a virus in it.
,jfk213,2010-09-12T07:32Z,Fuck you amfanvbna your a dick the download is good pay no attention to this cunt

,lestatvvvvvv,2010-09-12T11:45Z,why is it with over 1200 seeders it says I am connected to only 1 or 2
,piratenumber11,2010-09-12T11:47Z,seed please!
,piratenumber11,2010-09-12T11:55Z,I hate when ppl are selfish and delete the torrent right after it's finished downloading - there is like a 1000 of you who have 100 % already... I am on 0.7 % after 2 hours because the download speed is like 0.5 kb/s ..... come on! If every one of you who have 100 % put 1 % uploading.... it would be so fast and it won't slow down you stuff either.... Please!
