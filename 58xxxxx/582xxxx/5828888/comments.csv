Seed if legit. I know hardly anybody is gonna be DLing this thing cause hardly anybody knows about ABiCA..."
,Kyle2011anon,2011-05-17T05:08Z,"Had to do a lot of editing as many of the songs didn't have album names or artist names. Quality is 128KB/S which is good. Not excellent but good nonetheless.

Not a bad torrent. Editing isn't gonna kill anyone LOL been doin that ever since I got frostwire."
,Kyle2011anon,2011-05-17T05:13Z,"Edit:

Prelude is in better quality than Numb actually. My bad lol. I'm seeing 230+KB/s"
