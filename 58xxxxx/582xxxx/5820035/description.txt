Oh yes, it's the one and only DISCO APACHE, thesensation of a bunch of Danish morons dressed like indians dancing around to some rather odd disco cover of "Apache". 

Well, anyway, here it is with proper quality! This was recorded off a MINT vinyl single, using high-end equipment, then processed and saved as M4A lossless audio.


Enjoy!
