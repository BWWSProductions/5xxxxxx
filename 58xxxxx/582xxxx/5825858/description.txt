The source material for this torrent is the "Dark Doctrines of Sat-Tan" torrent. However, each page of each of the documents was uploaded as a several megabyte full color jpeg in that torrent, making the whole torrent about half a gig. What I've done is to take those images and translate them into relatively small black and white PDFs. Because of this, the torrent is about 78 Megs. 

Tani Jantsang, and Philip Marsh, are interesting characters. The information in here is reputedly the product of a "Traditional Satanism" that has been passed down through family traditions, mixed with Jantsang's own researches into occultism, eastern philosophy, biblical issues. Some of it came from participation in a group that looked at H.P. Lovecraft from an esoteric angle. How much of Jantsang's story is accurate and how much of it is the product of her self is for you to judge. 

Be forewarned, though, that Jantsang's writing style leaves much to be desired, with frequent ALL CAPS words inserted for emphasis and questionable linguistic analysis. Despite this, however, there's much of interest in these booklets. 

Caveat Emptor.
