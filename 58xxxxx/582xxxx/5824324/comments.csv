,patchesonhat,2010-09-11T10:37Z,I'd like to know what the fuck your thanking him for? Did the uploader suck you off? Cause this shit is FAKE...
,tatt00,2010-09-11T16:35Z,"@patchesonhat Never had a fake from xxmen or NLT for that matter.
Its not a DVDR but a DVD made from a cam, thats why its called DVDTS.

If you thought it was a retail release its your bad the movie is in the movies as we speak.

xxmen bedankt vanavond weer een bioscoopavond met de kids thuis, hoop dat de beeldkwaliteit een beetje te doen is.

,ebrox,2010-11-19T20:37Z,"> a DVD made from a cam, thats why its called DVDTS.

So, if you burn a TS or Cam to a DVD, and then upload it, you can label it DVD?  Fail logic is fail!"
