Still waiting patiently for a reseed of about 13 S01 torrents with E05, E06 and E07 being the first three.

I am worried that I will miss you actually starting reseeding so could you give some idea when you hope to start with these? If you tell me November, that is fine ;)

con gracias anticipadas"

E12 Performances
E13 Performances (Please Rename & Fresh Upload as this was incorrectly named Results and messes with the actual Results file)

Will you simply refresh the original uploads and let us know which ones via your latest upload please?  (Except E13 Performances as above)

One at a time from this list will be fine.

Thank you"

,asighkick,2010-09-13T04:28Z,"Geez, there are some dicks around!  I don't think those fcukwits realise that torrents are made to share and it takes a lot of time and effort to help others - it's not like any of us get paid for it!

Anyway, my apologies if I confused the situation earlier.  I see that nearly all S01 of X Factor are seeded now except.....

Fresh upload of S01E13 Results (Please).
S01E14 Performances (not showing as seeded yet)
S01E16 Final

Thanks for your time, ignore the fcukwits!"
[V],verovenlo,2010-09-13T14:38Z,everything is seeding now enjoy the episodes and yes fuck the hit and runners

,asighkick,2010-09-14T03:45Z,"Thanks for all your hard work Verovenlo....

Just one more for X Factor Series One please, a fresh Upload of S01E13 Results (when you get a chance).

A neighbour is downloading the files and I help him seed once they are down.  We don't have good speeds, but trying to do our bit."
