So do we have two groups of saved people here? One saved group already rapture and another will come later? This is spurious religion and is NOT biblical. There is ONLY ONE chance for salvation for those on earth when the mark of the beast is implemented. There will only be two groups of people, save and lost. Period. The false doctrine of a secret rapture and a second chance at salvation after Jesus returns is a doctrine of devils. When Jesus returns, that's it. The saved are saved and the lost are lost."
