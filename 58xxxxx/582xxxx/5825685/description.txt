PLOT: The highly skilled Federale Machete is hired by 
some unsavory types to assassinate a senator. But just as 
he's about to take the shot, he notices someone aiming at 
him and realizes he's been set up. He barely survives the 
sniper's bullet, and is soon out for revenge on his former 
employers, with the reluctant assistance of his old friend 
Cheech Marin, who has become a priest and taken a vow of 
nonviolence. If you hire him to take out the bad guys, 
make sure the bad guys aren't you!
