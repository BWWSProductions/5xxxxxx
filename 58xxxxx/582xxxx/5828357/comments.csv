,mattako,2010-09-14T01:44Z,Thank you Bum_Fluff. Am i rude in asking if the file sizes could be reduced somewhat? 
,Bum_Fluff,2010-09-14T04:03Z,"The *.avi file contains both languages, and is about as small as I dare make it before the resolution sucks on a big screen TV.  just 1.2G if you choose to DL that one only (as i'm sure most of the others are!)"
,mattako,2010-09-14T15:25Z,"I see! Well thank you for your hard work.

2 questions though:

a) are you British?
b) is it that you are just a nice,kind person for the reason why you do this for others?

Interested in your response.  "
,Bum_Fluff,2010-09-14T23:23Z,"I am not British, but Canadian. (yeah NHK, come and get me!)

Just doing to be nice, and to try and keep SUMO (true sumo, not that fake US crap) alive!"
,mattako,2010-09-16T17:07Z,One thing i would like to add- add Sumo to the title so peeps searching will find these files more easily. Then more seeders for all!
,vlad_basho,2010-09-24T15:01Z,Thanks a ton for keeping Sumo alive!
