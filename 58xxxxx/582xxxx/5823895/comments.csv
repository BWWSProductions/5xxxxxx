,DFigotin,2010-09-11T19:29Z,"seriously, if you dont like it then eat a dick, no one asked you for your opinion. simply ignore and dont click on this link. i happen to have poppedtart in my bookmarks and click on him every week to get new movies onto my itouch. its fast, easy, and he has great subs as well as the rating and basic plot of each film. so riggsta, eat a dick."

[V],poppedtart,2010-09-17T06:58Z,"its just a setting on your iphone, look in the ipod video settings for it.

its unrelated to the file or itunes.  You can select the subtitle however while its playing in itunes, but this is unrelated to your iphone.  browse your settings ON YOUR IPHONE."

,Kevenpor,2010-09-17T17:31Z,iTunes does NOT show sub too.
[V],poppedtart,2010-09-17T17:58Z,"it only has subs for the foreign parts, it works fine."
,Kevenpor,2010-09-17T21:08Z,"Thanks! 
I do understand now. It ONLY works in foreign parts. Not all conversation in the movie unless you hardcoded in.

Thanks again @poppedtart.
