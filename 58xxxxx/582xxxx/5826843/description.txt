It's a difficult task to pick a favourite album from a band with such a long history and a record of producing such amazing albums. This is probably the one I'd go for (though "Searchlight" and "The Cutter and the Clan" give it a good run for its money). This is the MacDonald brothers at their most moody and atmospheric - the songs are driven by brooding guitars and percussion, with keyboards adding just the right note of broodiness or whimsy according to the song. The opening bars of "Headlights" are like watching a storm roll in over the hills at night, and the scene-painting continues right to the end of the album. Stand-out tracks for me are "This Beautiful Pain" (because it clicked with me, somehow), "I'll Keep Coming Home" (delightfully understated) and the gorgeous "Always the Winner" - which, in sentiment if not necessarily in melody, is perhaps the most uplifting song the band have ever written.
