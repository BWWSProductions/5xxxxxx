,wira020,2010-09-16T22:19Z,"@Yify
Thanks for ur reply, was just wondering is all... And its weird that no else had the same problem hehe.. Well, if anyone have the same problem, just turn off gpu rendering / acceleration and let the cpu do all the work.. maybe it's just problem with having gpu doing the work.. could be problem with gpu drivers or the player itself... "
,rhino_mik,2010-09-16T23:49Z,It doesn't work for me wither.  Tried VLC and mediaplayer :(
