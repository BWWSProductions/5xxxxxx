Got to love that. but when i tried playing the movie there was a section of the movie, like a line through it, that was distorted from the rest of the picture. I don't know if its just because my monitor is really big and the resolution doesn't fit this rip that well or what. Using ArcSoft Media Theater. Any ideas?"
,willebyj,2011-02-02T22:09Z,"garrett for real tho, have you never read any comments on anything before? VLc media player is the best thing to use for videos. It's free and plays almost all codecs, if it doesn't play it then u prob don't need it :) U can google VLC and get it from there"
