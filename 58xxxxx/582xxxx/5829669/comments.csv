,narcronics,2010-09-15T11:23Z,"545gb up and there is only two seeds, lol."
,narcronics,2010-09-15T13:09Z,750gb uploaded and still only 2 seeds...surely we can do better than that...
,narcronics,2010-09-16T22:34Z,1.7tb up and i am now the only seeder.
,narcronics,2010-09-17T11:29Z,2tb up and still the only seeder.
,azervayne,2010-10-09T04:22Z,"Narconics:

TBP's tracker has been down for over a year now and won't be back. The amount of seeders and leechers on here is therefore completely irrelevant.

If you're still in the habit of organizing torrents by most seeds, realize the counts you're getting is likely not being updated either.

DHT shows 21 seeds 119 peers for this torrent as of 8 Oct 2010."
,narcronics,2010-10-10T11:25Z,"It has been some time since my last comment.  I do see there are now some seeds. I have uploaded over 7TB now

,aprice9876,2010-11-08T21:19Z,can someone seed this please. what the fuck. i have comcast with turbobooster and this shit is goin at like 90 kbps and its estimating that its gonna take a fucken week to download.
,Krazyfire,2010-11-10T00:43Z,can someone please tell me the quality of this download.. Thanks
,aprice9876,2010-11-10T01:55Z,"@krazyfire - the first few episodes appear to be in reasonable quality, although it would help if there were some more seeders on here to make this download take less than one week. "
,Krazyfire,2010-11-11T09:01Z,"Come on guys, please seed. be so much quicker for evry1"
,narcronics,2010-11-12T23:13Z,"When i first downloaded this in 2007 it took just over 2 years to finish.

I've been seeding this for the past month at more than 5mb/s constantly and I've uploaded 15 terabytes.

A week to download a 97gb torrent on a public tracker? That's fast.
"
,torrent420,2010-11-13T01:12Z,"Krazyfire and aprice, stop complaining. You're getting the entire COPS series for free. Of course it's gonna take a week to download when you're skimping out on the $1000 that this would normally cost in retail. 

Thanks to all the seeders, especially narcronics, for facilitating such an amazing download!"
,Krazyfire,2010-11-15T08:37Z,"Thanks ""narcronics""and thankyou ""torrent420"" for your honesty.  Cheers guys"
,wheels417,2010-12-11T22:14Z,Plz SEED!
,Cpax,2011-01-02T06:12Z,Hope some more seeders come into play soon. I guess 10 is pretty god for such a large file though. Thanks
,jamallachgar,2011-03-26T13:23Z,when i get this shit i will reorganize and re up them all.One season per torrent
,slippermaker,2011-03-28T04:21Z,"@jamallachgar

 please do that.. this shit is too big (that's what she said)"
,subzero616,2011-04-01T19:09Z,"The resolution is pretty low, too bad since much of these is night time action so blurry image is kind of annoying. Thx anyway"
,schotzky,2011-04-04T08:50Z,jaheez please seed
,NickNLCA,2011-04-29T07:17Z,"I know that this anonymous person isn't the original uploader, but I think whoever made this should have split it up by season...

I can seed a few seasons at a time, but I don't have room for 98GB of files on my computer."
,priscillaflores,2011-05-24T04:30Z,"started on april 30, finished may 23, worth it for all the episodes i got lol thank you so much, i will be a seeder too"
,thw_cokeaddict,2011-06-12T15:57Z,I dnloaded another cops pack that was on TPB it was 108gb in size and took me 18 months to get. This torrent looks the same but missing heaps
,Khorask,2011-06-27T19:31Z,"Wow, had to dig out an old HDD just to make room for the torrent...

will seed for a few years if I ever manage to download it all ;)"
,Doggi1337,2011-07-07T01:09Z,"Please seed this Torrent, the speed is slow :("
,stvescot,2011-07-13T06:16Z,Awesome! Thank you uploader! Much appreciated. 
,narcronics,2011-07-17T10:37Z,"Please add 

http://tracker.publicbt.com/announce

To your tracker list for this torrent.
This will help speed up the download.

Also, make 100% sure you have peer exchange & DHT enabled in your torrent client. All of the trackers in this torrent seem to be down but I'm getting 100's of peers and seeds through DHT and Peer Exchange"
,XelPi,2011-08-18T20:22Z,Downloading at 2MB/s. 
[T],ETC1337,2011-09-01T03:47Z,"yeah this is definitely missing episodes...SE8 EP4 for one...

And i really wish this was categorized by season

But all in all thanks for the upload"
,pcmorrowt,2011-09-05T05:44Z,"I am downloading this and it says it will take 3-12 weeks.

p.s. I thought TPB is a free torrent, for free people...I was wrong."
,WTF777,2011-10-02T04:50Z,I increased my upload speed to 16 mbit\sec at my day and 80 at night. What download speed?
,babybluetits24,2011-10-08T18:55Z,its missing s1ep7 any1 got that anywhere to share ?
,Tjingis,2011-10-08T20:41Z,Love the upload! Thanks man but can't you please organise the files/folders and maybe categorize them by seasons cuz that would make this the best COPS-torrent on the f**king web! ;)
,atndigcrk,2011-12-15T22:45Z,"prob the biggest torrent ever
but well seeded for piratebay

,brimmy11,2011-12-17T10:09Z,I've uploaded 1.5TB on this torrent in the past week...
,WTF777,2011-12-25T08:51Z,10.7TB Who more ? :)
,narcronics,2012-01-22T10:04Z,"I uploaded over 100tb of this when i first put it up.
That probably explains why its still got seeds."
,mushie1,2012-05-19T08:34Z,"I've soon have a ratio of 2.5 on this torrent. I demand everyone to seed too, not ONLY me, ffs. And get your connection straight.."
