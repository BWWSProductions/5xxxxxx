I just don't get it."

,suppurate,2010-10-30T06:52Z,Thanks for the hi-res
,suppurate,2010-10-30T23:05Z,"BTW, this is NOT ""Code Geass - Lelouch of the Rebellion R2"" This is the first series named ""Code Geass - Lelouch of the Rebellion"" (the R2 should be removed from heading). Torrent is mislabeled. Season two is called Code Geass - Lelouch of the Rebellion R2"
,suppurate,2010-10-30T23:48Z,Correction. This IS the R2 version. My mistake. Heading is correct. Sorry thanks [D]
,Mythicos,2010-11-03T00:18Z,"@ puuba:

Its not about it being more like real life.

It's about when I want to watch an anime, I'd love for the picure quality on my 62"" HDTV to not look like my 3-year old daughter's crayon pictures after a rabid panda has eaten them all, and shit them back out, and animated them using a flick-book, and then passed them through every filter of the earliest version of photoshop.

It might just be me... But I like a clear and crisp pic. :)

Many thanks to the uploader, I think this is one of the only code Geass downloads I've had where some prick hasn't dubbed his own voice into the intro songs. :D"
,adonaij,2010-12-20T23:47Z,"Am I the only one noticing that this is really a big size per file for 720p. It is anime and requires less size than IRL movies/series. I've downloaded Code Geass R1 in 1080p in the same size as this. I know what the ""geeks"" are thinking, it is raw 720p hd. But I would answer that back with; If you are a good ripper, you could easily rip it to 250mb per file and not loose anything in quality, as the eye can see."
,adonaij,2010-12-20T23:49Z,Naruto & Bleach and all those popular animes are ripped as 250mb per episode (720p)
,S_Vamp,2011-05-02T17:52Z,broken videos. all i was able to watch was half of the opening theme before the video cut out. 
,cadooron2,2011-10-14T01:58Z,"more seeders!!!!
just finished R1 and i want to see this!!!!"
,Nuclei,2012-05-01T10:48Z,"@Puuba why would you look at Jpgs in 100% quality? It does look a lot better. Sharper, crisper lines, no artifacts from crappy compression. Audio is often less compressed."
