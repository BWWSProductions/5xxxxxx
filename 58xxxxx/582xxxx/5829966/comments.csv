This is redrum4409 from YT, appreciate the up, and once completed I will seed tenfold!"
,BeyondMaster,2010-09-15T00:07Z,"Thank you PeterSteele

the seeding is the only thing I was worried about, mine is kinda slow, so bear with me please!
do you have any other similiar information which would be interesting?"
,PeterSteele,2010-09-15T07:19Z,"Dont worry about the speed, I'm at 33% now.. if it takes a couple more days, no big deal.  Like I said once it's completed I'll seed for quite a while.  I have a fairly fast connection, and have uploaded more than I've dl'd at this point (5.3 ratio)  haha

As far as similar content, I can't think of any at the moment, however as far as in depth documentaries, I would suggest 'Core of Corruption'... it's a film about 9/11, it's a low budget film, but the content itself is great:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4829959/Core_of_Corruption-In_the_Shadows

I would also suggest 'food inc' if you haven't already seen it, very good film, very informative:

,BeyondMaster,2010-09-16T19:50Z,"nice, thank you for the links, I already know ""Food inc"", but ""Core of corruption"" is new to, although 9/11 is one of the biggest jokes ever on this planet.

0.006% to go, and I've uploaded the whole thing oce, yes! Thanks ofr the patience people!

This will change the way you see the world, 
*hmmhahahaha!*"
