When problems come to prey on an otherwise "perfect" crime, hard-boiled gangster Charlie Valentine (Raymond J. Barry) seeks assistance from an unlikely source: his estranged son, Danny (Michael Weatherly), who's been living his own life in Los Angeles. With father and son working together, a series of crimes starts falling into place. But that doesn't reduce the danger in teaching Danny the family business.
