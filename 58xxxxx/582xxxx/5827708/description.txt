The wait is finally over! After the number 1 smash that was Mash Up Mix 90s The Cut Boys have returned for their official 2010 outing. This time around the album not only creates brand new sonic thrills, it represents a massive range of dance music more than previously thought possible!

Weighing in at over 100 tracks the genre boundaries are bust open with House, Trance, Electro, Dubstep and Drum & Bass, soaring from euphoric dance to bass heavy beats blended in a way most DJs could only dream of. As always the tracklist can't do justice to what The Cut Boys have forged from it, but the quality of the ingredients is clear with a glance.

Man of the moment Example features strongly with a fine selection of his previous hits and the hotly tipped upcoming 'Last Ones Standing'. Sidney Samsonâ€™s chart smash is brilliantly mashed with the Azzido Da Bass classic. The blend of Basshunter and 'We Speak No Americano' has to be heard to be believed! Future releases from Afrojack and Alex Gaudino are given the cut up treatment, along with household names David Guetta, Sub Focus, Fedde Le Grand, MJ Cole, Groove Armada, Fatboy Slim and so many more. The scope of the album is clear with Dubstep golden boy Skream sitting happily alongside Trance god Armin Van Burren.

Brilliant, awesome, heaven...a few of the words reviewers used to describe the previous albums. Taking the freshest dancefloor smashes and reinventing them with the skill that only The Cut Boys command, The Mash Up Mix 2010 is set to be the ultimate addition to any of the thousands of loyal followers' collection
