I SEARCHED THE WEB HIGH AND LOW LOOKING FOR A DECENT COPY OF THIS MOVIE..  IT'S A CLASSIC...  IT NEVER GETS OLD NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I WATCH IT :)

I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS A DVD RIP OR A BLU-RAY RIP, BUT EITHER WAY THE QUALITY IS AWESOME...

SEED AND ENJOY...!

ANY ADDITIONAL SEEDERS ARE APPRECIATED
