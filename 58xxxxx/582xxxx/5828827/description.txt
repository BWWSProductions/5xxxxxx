Notez:
Here is the new dc animated original movie, Superman
Batman: Apocalypse! I found a random mkv of it floating
around the web, but the AR was standard 480p 4x3 RES
and not properly encoded to 16x9, and the file
size was definately a bit much, so i reencoded to xvid,
forced to (at least my) preffered AR of 704x396 (1.78:1 
16x9 WS). Wait for a scene rls if u prefer, but heres
something for those who dont want to wait, take it or
leave it, enjoy!
