Recorded on The Beatles Apple label. The first two tracks are Lewis compositions, still the classic MJQ cool jazz but with a bit of an atmospheric vibe.

The Modern Jazz Quartet took a hiatus from Atlantic Records to record two LPs for The Beatles' Apple label. Despite the switch, The MJQ's music remained unchanged; it was too classic to alter. This out-of-print album has among its selections a pair of obscure John Lewis originals ("Visitor from Venus" and "Visitor from Mars"), vibraphonist Milt Jackson's ballad feature on "Here's That Rainy Day" and the lengthy "Adagio from Concierto De Aranjuez." Overall this is an average but worthy outing from a group whose excellence could always be taken for granted. ~ Scott Yanow - AMG
