Thereâ€™s a revolution underway in South America, but most of the world doesnâ€™t know it. Oliver Stone sets out on a road trip across five countries to explore the social and political movements as well as the mainstream mediaâ€™s misperception of South America while interviewing seven of its elected presidents. In casual conversations with Presidents Hugo ChÃ¡vez (Venezuela), Evo Morales (Bolivia), Lula da Silva (Brazil), Cristina Kirchner  (Argentina), as well as her husband and ex-President NÄ—stor Kirchner,  Fernando Lugo  (Paraguay), Rafael Correa (Ecuador), and RaÃºl Castro  (Cuba), Stone gains unprecedented access and sheds new light upon the exciting transformations in the region.
