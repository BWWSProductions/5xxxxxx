Hugo Chavez gave such a glowing recommendation for this film in his recent speech to the U.N. (available on CSPAN) that I just had to check it out."

,bloketree,2011-01-03T00:02Z,"Just d/l ing now so don't know yet if it has english subs. I got the other one which does not. got as far as the first Chavez speech and stopped since I want to see what he's saying obviously. Also this has re-inspired me to learn spanish, it's so important now with what's happening in S America, seems to be where it's at right now politically."
,bloketree,2011-01-03T01:18Z,"OK got the d/l super fast, and it does have english subs. Thanks for the tip m-fox.
One powerful message: the coup failed because the military was behind Chavez. So the military is the key to good government whether we like it or not. 
Most of us have been conned into ""supporting the troops"" in the US, which means supporting them carrying out vicious mass-murder for a tiny minority elite who hold all the power and wealth.
It's very clear that the public should only support the troops WHO RESIST! - and give no sympathy or support to those who continue to kill for money and without principle (except for the bogus ""war on terrorism"" which is really a war OF terrorism!"
