
You fans of the old Twilight Zone series will 
remember an episode from its 5th and final
season called "Steel", in which Lee Marvin
played a crooked boxing promoter in the 
"future" year 1974 in which he breaks the law
by using a human fighter in a time when only
robot fighters are allowed.

This episode of ESPIONAGE is not sci-f but it
does have two things in common with that Twilight Zone:   
(1) It also takes place in 1974, making the story
instantly dated and (2) This was also filmed in 1963!

Several familiar American actors in this one
including Arthur Kennedy, Larry Gates,
toupee-free Alan Hewitt (then on "My Favorite Martian"),
Tim O'Connor, Nancy Wickwire, and 
eventual Cosby Show grandfather Earle Hyman.
