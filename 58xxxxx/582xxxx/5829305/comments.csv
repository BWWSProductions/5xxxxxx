,PhilLesh12,2010-09-14T09:14Z,slowest torrent so far this month!
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-14T09:53Z,"I can't believe this got even slower since I posted my last comment!

I've been downloading for an hour and 45 minutes, and it STILL says 1 hour 6 minutes remaining, just like when I posted my first comment.

TvTeam/Scenebalance just doesn't have their shit together.

OR, they are jerking everyone around."
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-14T09:58Z,"Man, fuck you guys.  You are obviously playing games or have a screwed up seedbox.

I just downloaded the torrentday version of this and have a full speed download.

You guys wasted TWO HOURS of my life, and the torrentday version will be completed in 19 minutes.

Seriously, you guys are a failure of a ""group""."
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-14T10:04Z,"http://www.torrentday.com/download.php/128115/Anthony.Bourdain.No.Reservations.S06E25.Madrid.HDTV.XviD-FQM.torrent

Register with them and download it from there.  

Does anyone know if I can copy the torrentday torrent over scenebalance's, so that everyone can complete this torrent?  I'd be happy to seed this so scenebalance's little game is ruined.

Seriously, nobody has more than 84% on the scenebalance torrent, which is where I quit it (when nobody has more than you after about an hour, you know there's shenanigans).  I've got 25 out of 86 seeders on the torrentday version."
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-14T10:10Z,"Wow, I downloaded this same torrent in the time between my last two comments here.

scenebalance and tvteam keep pulling this bullshit.  

2 hours, versus 11 minutes.  and I'm using a Verizon Wireless broadband EVDO connection!

These jokers really suck."
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-14T11:31Z,"It took more than 4 hours to get the first non-original seeder.

I don't understand their logic, but for whatever reason they seem to enjoy stringing along a couple hundred people, slowly metering down the bandwidth until they have 3 or 4 hundred people waiting several hours to complete a download.  I guess to hope for a sudden surge of seeders when they finally decide to let everyone finish downloading.

Several other sources finished in 10 - 15 minutes.  3 to 4 hours is just fucked up."

Thanks scenebalance for all YOUR uploads to The Pirate Bay ."
[V],big_dad_e,2010-09-15T05:37Z,"BTW, I downloaded this tt in about 10 minutes."
[V],scenebalance,2010-09-15T11:04Z,"They don't know how to say Thanks
Its all free take or leave it"
