Game not playable until 9/28/10.

Download it Seed! And wait for proper crack release!"
,danilo86,2010-09-13T15:03Z,"Lets download and wait for a crack.
Maybe come early."
,Strikefear13,2010-09-13T22:32Z,"Well, not to say it won't be playable until that date.  All it takes is a crack anytime between now and then.  I've got my hopes up ^_^"
,0018007,2010-09-13T23:02Z,maybe a crk like gears of war works!
,harddrivesixtynine,2010-09-14T14:00Z,"Got it yesterday (upload day) very high speed, installed it and seems to be good! no viruses or anything, seeding right now and waiting for crack ;) thanks!!!"
,Torx8,2010-09-15T09:21Z,i wouldn't click on that link
,DoodleBop,2010-09-15T11:18Z,"Torx you're an idiot. A link can't do anything to your computer unless you accept it to install something on your comp.

And i've visited that link numerous times, its legit. So STFU if you're gonna say bull crap."
,DoodleBop,2010-09-15T19:49Z,"After accepting/authorizing something to install on your comp, yeah. And most basic AV stops those scripts.

You really gotta be a retard and surf with IE and a nude Win98 to get infected by a website...

Never happened to me after 10 years of intense surfing."
,Kronical4,2010-09-15T21:52Z,"@DoodleBop

Are you on another torrent flaming comments again? I guess you didn't get all the sand out of your vagina, you might be making a pearl soon."
,Aerionix,2010-09-15T23:47Z,"2 years ago, you'd have been right.  in today's internet however, yes, scripts can kill.  Yes activeX controls can get past real time virus protection, and yes you probably get your ass kicked daily in the school yard.  

By girls.  


Who are amputees.  


and twelve.
"
,DoodleBop,2010-09-16T13:31Z,"ActiveX needs your authorization, noob.

Kronical, poor arguments and same insults coming back over and over again. Your life's gotta be boring and empty.

Since i have pity for guys like you i'm gonna let you get away with this one, run back to your mama."
,jeffdamann,2010-09-16T15:02Z,LMAO ANYONE who downloads a public torrent is a noob :P
,Aerionix,2010-09-16T18:38Z,"boring and empty is when you refer to web surfing as ""intense"".   just sayin."
,SnakeSh1tt1,2010-09-16T19:17Z,"its booring when u refresh three Dead rising torrents sites 500 times per hour, and hope someone tells there CRACK FROM SKIDROW, RELOADED or Maybe RAZOR1911 but no!"
,DoodleBop,2010-09-16T19:26Z,"Aerionix, yeah, i don't need to go to school anymore."
,Aerionix,2010-09-16T21:38Z,"unplanned vacation due to inappropriate handling of the classroom gerbil.  I know, it happens.


Makes the waiting worse having the bloody iso all ready to go, maybe even installed already, just waiting for that one little 5-10 mb file to unlock the fun."
,prodygy,2010-09-17T00:18Z,"Thanks for uploading, i think this game won't be crackeable until release date because it uses Zero Day Piracy Protection, that means that their files are encrypted to avoid people playing prior release date...crap :-( "
,dezontk101,2010-09-17T01:38Z,"@DoodleBop, a lot of today's nastys come in java form, which requires no authorization, the script can deploy secretly. However, after unpacking the payload and compiling the application, most AVs will eventually pick up the objects, alot of the time not by heuristics though, but by the old fashioned definition comparison, aka manual scan. Stopping the actual java script, is a different thing altogether.

Ima MCP & CCNA, and this is based on machines with malwarebytes anti-malware aswell as eset nod32, both with real time enabled.

My two cents."
,Sockerton,2010-09-17T02:49Z,"@ jeffdaman shut the fuck up you think you are the only one with an IPT account?

#1782450 by jeffdamann (User) at 2010-09-15 18:15:42
ATTENTION EVERYONE: You DO NOT need to wait for the release date, simply put 00000-00000-00000-00000-00000-00000 as your key and it installs. Happy playing from a new user, this was my first download!


THAT DOESNT WORK YOU DUMB SHIT.

shut up you dont know anything, you are new to this whole torrent game."
,DoodleBop,2010-09-17T12:39Z,"Of course it doesn't work. You really think developers are retards or what ?

You think you can put 0000 everywhere and just play ? You guys even understand the utility of a crack here ? ....."
,SnakeSh1tt1,2010-09-17T13:08Z,"well, is there cd keys in anyother capcom game? i dont know any, and in Microsoft games most of them (Ship Simulator Extreme) u can still put what ever u want to Serial and it works."
,DoodleBop,2010-09-17T17:09Z,"doon21, you think we're stupid or something ?
If this crack worked it would already be uploaded here by someone.

So STFU and get out of here with your pay link before i kick your sorry ass, capisci ?"
,kimjongwil,2010-09-19T07:30Z,"doodle, you suck as usual.

the key to INSTALL is all zeros.

here is what a zero looks like, just so i don't have to write another comment to show you later:

0

everyone hates you buddy.

here's a hint: even you."
,Darkly47,2010-09-19T08:26Z,"Thanks Stun, given me two good releases now (this & SC II), now ive gotta play the waiting game, btw anyone know if Civilization V is up?"
,kyetan21,2010-09-19T16:42Z,"well for all the nay sayers that talk about how the serial  of all 0's doesnt work i had pulled the log file during my install cause thats the only way to see the progress, but look for yourselves

,Aerionix,2010-09-25T04:16Z,the hell happened?  there was a working crack (can't save but can play) but both torrents for it were removed...  was a great way to see if the game runs good at least.  Ah well.  Real crack soon no doubt.

extract the iso, mount  or burn
to install run Game.msi (not setup.exe)
it will not ask for a cd key or check for gfwl

when installation is complete
browse to your dr2 install folder (right click on the dr2 shortcut on the desktop -> properties -> [find target])
rename the deadrising2.exe to deadrising2.org.exe (you might need it later for the proper crack or patch)

copy the cracked deadrising2.exe to the install folder

and play"

,pyroman6x9x9,2010-09-27T23:56Z,"For those using a xbox usb controller and the option to enable the controller is greyed out, here's a fix that works and i have been using it for the last 3 days once I figured it out.
First you need to download x360ce, you can get it here:
http://code.google.com/p/x360ce/downloads/list
Place it in your dead rising 2 install directory and run it. Once in x360ce load the ""controller (xbox 360 wireless reciever) preset then go to the advanced tab and disable ""native mode"" by unchecking it. Go to the force feedback tab and uncheck ""enable force feedback"". Then go to the options tab and set ""fake mode"" to compatibility. Now click save at the bottom, close x360ce and launch dead rising2, you can now enable it under pc settings in the options menu and all controls are pre mapped. As x360ce was run from the game folder this will not have any affect on the controller for other games.

x360ce basically creates a an xinput dll file to allow the controller to run outside of GFWL. "
,butryk22,2010-09-28T02:51Z,"ive done this with the skidrow crack also got the msvcr100.dll, now it works a treat, saves and everything, you dont have to login to windows live anymore and confirm your key, so its all good!"
,emptyglass,2010-09-28T10:19Z,"This may be a dumb question but some of you have said that you've gotten past the windows live serial check, does this mean you can play coop online? Or do you mean you can only install the game without a legit serial."
