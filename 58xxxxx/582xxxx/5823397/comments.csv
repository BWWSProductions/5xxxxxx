,deodac,2010-09-12T07:11Z,"Sorry, I was mistaken about the audio, is DVD quality.

V/9
A/9
M/? 

(still watching, but looks fun for me, I love this kind of films, like ArsĂ¨ne Lupin)

By the way, THANKS A LOT, been waiting for this one whole months!

A fine work."
,deodac,2010-09-12T08:37Z,"M/7

But there's a sudden mute in audio at the beginning of credits that makes the last scene, which is some 3 minutes long in the middle of credits, inaudible. 
A pity.

Anyway, thx again, Morck22!"
