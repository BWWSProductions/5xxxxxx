This effectively prohibits further progress & is quite a disappointment.  Otherwise, I love the game - deeply immersive & beautifully illustrated.  The animated smoke in the incense scene is so real I can smell sandalwood."

A page-turner ;) 

I had no problems with the game on Vista.

Thanks for upload!"
