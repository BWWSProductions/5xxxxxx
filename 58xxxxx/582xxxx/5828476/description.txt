A high body count is still promised in this tale set in a fictional city inspired by' New York of the 1940s and \'50s, but those casualties will come the hard way â€” through small-scale operations rather than mass firefights.

 Reference to Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven

In the original game the main protagonist Thomas Angelo is shown to be gunned down at the end of the game in front of his house. It is revealed in Chapter 14: Stairway to Heaven in Mafia 2 that Vito and Joe are the two who \"whack\" him. 
This is further proven by the use of the exact same red car in both cases and nearly identical cut scenes, although the dialogue used is the same from the original scene. The cut scene uses the same voice actor for Thomas Angelo as in the original game, Michael Sorvino.
