The Day I Died: The Mind, The Brain, And Near-Death Experiences
Recent studies of cardiac arrest survivors suggest that near-death experiences may occur at times when the brain has actually stopped functioning. Drawing conclusions from that research, The Day I Died dares to suggest that the mind is not dependent on the brainâ€”and that NDEs may confirm it. â€œThat the mind is located in the brain is just a hypothesis. Itâ€™s never been proven,â€ says cardiologist Pim van Lommel. Accounts of NDEs, shared by the people who experienced them, are analyzed by researchers and skeptics alike, providing a balanced look at a theory of mind that, at least in scientific circles, has previously been all but unthinkable.
