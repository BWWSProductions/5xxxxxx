Excellent quality.

Thanks a LOT!"
,Thorneater,2010-09-22T14:44Z,tnx alot
,snake1235,2010-09-23T07:45Z,Why is it not downloading now?
,Baramic,2010-09-23T21:12Z,"Sound quality is very good and the download was finished in a few minutes, ID3 tags a bit incomplete though and no album cover art for all the hc-fans out there.

Excellent upload already weeks before the album hit the shelves!"
,tango89,2010-09-23T21:44Z,"@snake1235, not sure why it isn't downloading. With 280+ seeds it should be done in no time.

@Baramic, thanks for the feedback. The reason there is no album cover is that it was a digital download avalible the day before Reach was released and no cover was offered. Sorry for the tags, too, but this was my second ever torrent and I haven't quite got everything."
,snake1235,2010-09-25T08:31Z,"I'm getting this error:

,omaximov,2010-09-30T02:27Z,"Getting 1.2 MB/s. Thanks. Excellent quality, fast download, remember to seed, everyone!"
,PulseCld,2010-09-30T22:52Z,"Thank you, tango89, but could you please upload this in FLAC instead of mp3?
BTW, in case you've never used FLACs, encoding level 8 is the best.

The software I use to rip FLACs from CDs is dbPoweramp CD Ripper.
It's great and I love it.

Here's a link: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5075275/dBpowerAMP_Music_Converter_-_CD_Ripper___FLAC_to_MP3


Please be the first to upload this fantastic OST in FLAC! :)

Thank you again! :)"

@PulseCld: I recieved this as a digital download and so was not ripped from a CD. I can convert it if wanted though."
,dANGER_boy,2010-10-11T02:39Z,"Uploaded a FLAC version for y'all.  Ripped from the original CD using EAC.
