,Salient1,2010-12-29T22:41Z,"you know what i dont understand?

a while back linkin park had the ""Catalyst"" remix contest....

they said they would include the winning track on this album and it would be distributed to all buyers/listeners.

pretty much, linkin park was going to help promote the winner on their new album by including that remix track.

they said it in video blogs and posted it in the prizes area of the rules.

i still havent found 1 copy of this album with the winning remix track included.

i think linkin park LIED to everybody!!!"

,Zethar,2011-04-08T03:29Z,"You know I have tried to be patient over the years. I really have. I LOVED their first album. LOVED IT!
They had the whole music world by the gonads. They were everywhere. But then album 2 came out and they changed their whole sound completely, and so......

Holy crap on a cracker what a shit album!!! Seriously?!? This the drek we get from Linkin Park now-a-days? If you're going to change everything so drastically, why not just change the name of the band and start over already.

Not even worth the free download. Save your bandwidth!!!"
,bubunapirate,2011-04-20T15:26Z,"I completely agree with 'Zethar' on that point. Meteora, Hybrid Theory and Reanimation all rocked, Minutes to Midnight was also somewhat better .... But this album ... LIKE A PIECE OF CRAP... all songs except the 'The Catalyst' SUCKS...  And what happened to their voice ... they don't sound like LP anymore .... pretty embarrasing ... :("
,PC800,2011-04-21T01:52Z,That is just about the best and most complete album torrent I've ever seen.  Many thanks for the up bro!
,nrgpiratelord,2011-04-21T16:34Z,what? you said the codec used was flac but its mp3!!!! you lied :(
,A7Xfan,2011-05-04T13:11Z,I didn't like it at all until I saw them live and I can appreciate the songs now. just turn it up and it seriously sounds better
,dragonflyy,2011-05-09T13:36Z,"LP is the only band that has the balls to be diverse anymore. Their sound changes and that is what makes them unique. A true artist can change what they want when they want and still sound awesome. It's this ""one sound wonders"" that are starting to suck. Listen to most bands now-a-days ... their songs all sound pretty much the same with few differences."
,nicklouslingor,2011-06-27T08:42Z,@salient1 actually if you apid attention they said the personw oudl be featured on the album and if you buy the CD you woudl see the little video where they actually talk to the winner form the contest and so in a sense they are ON the Cd but it was never ot help promote anyone
,pirataki,2011-10-13T22:21Z,"great torrent thanks :P im smelling a huge turning point for linkin park here and it doesnt look that bad :D:D also, i like most of the songs and i like it cause it has a timeline in the tracks.. i'll give it a go then :D"
,Galadriel379,2012-05-22T14:01Z,Thanks for this ! ;)
