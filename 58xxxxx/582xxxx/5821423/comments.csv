,MongoHL,2011-05-02T02:15Z,WTH?   Download the dang file and found out i had to go to some website for a password..   The link to the site doesnt even work..  Can someone help me out with the password?
,brain3k,2011-06-20T03:39Z,"Appreciate the upload, tested WORKING 100%... but this looks like a repack of SKIDROW release, with some cash code bullshit added to the rars and their name removed from the file name (isos byte for byte the same, crc32 matches). That said, maybe both just ripped from the same CD?"
,octogirl_21,2011-07-14T04:23Z,It seems like this just has black jack for games...is that the case?
