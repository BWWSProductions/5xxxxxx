Ian Xel Lungold presents his and Swedish biochemist Carl Johan Calleman's ( http://www.calleman.com ) findings about the Mayan Calendar on September 6, 2003 at Okanagan University College, Vernon, Canada.

For 525 years, adventurers and archeologists have studied the Mayan civilization for clues about their calendar system. Due to the translation of Mayan writing, discoveries of calendar inscriptions at Mayan ruins and the availability of scientific facts about Earth history, we now have the answer to the Mayan calendar mystery.

Ian Xel Lungold presents scientific evidence that demonstrates that the Maya centered their civilization around the actual schedule of the evolution of consciousness and the unfolding of creation, galaxies, life and history, in a system of repeating, ever accelerating cycles.
