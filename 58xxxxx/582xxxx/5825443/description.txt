I Know Whats Beneath the Snow Fields . . . 

An extremely epic story written by Zahra Ali. 

One of the best fanfics ever, and definitely the best FF7 one.  
 
Zahra had a website called ExnihiloZahra, where the story (among other things) was hosted. Before her site went down, I saved the entire story (from that site) along with official artwork created by Zahra herself. 

There was another site, run by someone named Sharleen, that also hosted the story and had lots of fanart for it as well... but it also is down. 

The story is available at one site though, namely:  
http://nibelheim.rusted-icon.net/snowfields.html

Content: 

The whole story, in HTM files. Opens in your webbrowser. 

Artwork by Zahra, divided into two subfolders: Black & White, and Colored. 



I put zeroes in front of the chapter numbers, to make it all line up correctly. 


 
Enjoy.....
