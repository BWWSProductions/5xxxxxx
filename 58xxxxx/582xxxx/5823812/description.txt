Changelog v1.1
Adobe Creative Suite Master Collection CS4
Middle Eastern (ME) / North African (NA) / Greek (GR) languages

Keygen works for all available languages.

For CS5, only Greek package is available no matter which set
(ME/NA/GR) you pick to get from WinSoft International site.  There
also seems to be some problems with multi-language serials with
WinSoft's installer so keygen will make Greek only serials.  If
you want English or French, use normal set from Adobe's site.  It
seems WinSoft really dropped the ball with CS5.

One final note.  A special thanks goes out to person who helped
out tremendously in getting v2.0 out the door.  Your help was
greatly appreciated

Enjoy

..: iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..

1. Prior to running an installer, press the patch button to patch
hosts file to prevent activation or do it manually (see below).
You only ever need to do this once.
2. Use our keymaker to register the application.

To manually patch hosts file add the following string to hosts
file ("/private/etc/hosts"):
127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com

To reset registration, search for "cache.db" in Finder and make
sure to include system files.  Delete all cache.db files related
to Adobe products.

If for some reason your license becomes expired or corrupted
simply run Adobe's own tool found here:
