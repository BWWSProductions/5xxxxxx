SEASON 1

NOTE: Season 1 also includes the "prequel" JAG episodes (Season 8, Episodes 20 - 21). These have not been ripped from DVD but the original .avi files have been converted to .m4v / .mp4 files using Roxio Popcorn.

I downloaded DVD's of NCIS and ripped H.264 MP4 files of each episode. The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using Handbrake with an Apple TV standard so they can be played on any iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes. They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.
For whatever reason dark areas of the original DVD appear slightly red. I also notice this on broadcast episodes and I think this is induced in the production of the show, but is more noticeable on the DVD's. This is not a rip defect.

There are no subtitles or alternate languages.

NCIS, also known as NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service, is an American police procedural drama television series revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which conducts criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.

The concept and characters were initially introduced in a two-part episode of the CBS series JAG (JAG episodes 8.20 and 8.21). The show, a spin-off from JAG, premiered on September 23, 2003 on CBS. NCIS was originally referred to as Navy NCIS during Season 1; however, "Navy" was later dropped from the title as it was redundant.
