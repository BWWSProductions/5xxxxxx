,Green-Banana,2010-09-20T12:02Z,How come the Stun ones seem to get stuck and never finish?  Also I thought the older one was somehow better?  
,NerdyJustin,2010-10-17T09:41Z,the 99.2% happens when the uploader doesn't bother to seed it enough usually.
,FRDS,2010-10-27T05:57Z,"Downloaded this and I just get a folder with 6 .zip archives, 1 .nfo file, and 1 .diz file. What am I supposed to do?"
,Wisper83,2010-11-08T16:02Z,the second extraction can't be completed due to 1 missing archive
