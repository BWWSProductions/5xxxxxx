I am seeding some of the work as well. Thanks as always dear 20-40. you completes our TPB.

@All New Guys
Please keep the torrents on, do not remove them after you are finished with download. Keep Ratio above 1:1. And dont worry your ISP donot charge you for the uploads. So help Others. sharing is Caring. God Bless "
,lilars26,2010-09-13T17:08Z,"Thank you 20-40.This sounds interesting.
@hakuna_matata Not all plans are the same.Mine charges for uploads but you are right about seeding. 1.1 is a good ratio to seed to."
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-13T17:24Z,"@hakuna_matata: Anyone can, really. Quality of my encodings is - decent - nothing more than that and - what majority does not comprehend - very much limited (by design) due to the widest possible targets (playback systems).

Moreover, look at the quantity - hundredths of people are, indeed, technically capable and they have encodings better than mine - BUT: they make few encodings every week - zero for a month or so, hundred torrents per year - maybe.

That's not my game. I top their numbers in a day or two. Lot of people does not understand that.

If you wanna encode for yourself I can send you a reply to your e-mail with my encoding line (Windows) - and if you have Mac - with HandBrake_cli encoding line.
Be aware that I do not provide help, finished solutions nor I can or want to be some type of encoding guru. I couldn't care less and such stuff is decade behind me... but I can get you encoding lines - and long journey follows - but for you, Hakuna.
