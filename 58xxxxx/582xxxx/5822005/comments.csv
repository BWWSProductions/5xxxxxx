,lydonit13,2010-10-05T15:50Z,"Thanks for the upload - excellent quality.

However, I have to join others in the crowd here in saying I didn't like LP's ""new sound"" on this album either.  It's difficult to continue calling them a rock band after hearing this.  I really don't like the use of auto-tuning to make synthetic vocals.  It makes them sound more like R&B or hip-hop then rock.  Hopefully, they'll return to their roots on future albums.
Just my $0.02."
,spambox123,2010-10-22T02:11Z,"I hate seeing people with closed minds
X.X

unless you hate on every music except your preference, listen to the whole album front to back without checking the song title and see how you like it. As long as your open minded, you will enjoy this album alot.

If its not your cup of tea, don't hate

I appreciate the time you've taken to upload . . . . "
,dickmdown,2010-11-27T07:02Z,lp like cock in their ass and this album is as queer as the pope
,Salient1,2010-12-29T21:56Z,"you know what i dont understand?

a while back linkin park had the ""Catalyst"" remix contest....

they said they would include the winning track on this album and it would be distributed to all buyers/listeners.

pretty much, linkin park was going to help promote the winner on their new album by including that remix track.

they said it in video blogs and posted it in the prizes area of the rules.

i still havent found 1 copy of this album with the winning remix track included.

i think linkin park LIED to everybody!!!"
,nrgpiratelord,2011-04-21T19:50Z,"linkin park guys whats wrong with you what has happened to your music now? youve become a sellout and the album was unpassionately made :(
with the kind of background linkin park has ..this shit is unbearable."
,gonebydawn,2011-05-05T05:56Z,Thanks!
,mrjackspider,2011-05-20T03:53Z,"now they gave the idea of singing slow
it's breaking up the band

good upload"
,DamageIncM,2011-06-14T23:01Z,"Yeah, what's up with this album?
This is not Linkin Park (well, the download is, but...), more like a SIDE-project of Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington.
I know many people already didn't like the 'Minutes To Midnight'-one, which I do love for what it is.
But this album sounds like the ""softer"" songs on that album, but then constantly.
Just what the F?!

I mean, it's like... I don't hear any proper drums or guitars...
It sounds like a drumcomputer with synthersizers and stuff like that...

Well, in about 2 songs you hear this thin guitar and pop-ish drums.
Which makes it sound like some rock-pop-band.

Their first two albums and even the 3rd waltz right over this one... no comparison...
Didn't expect it to be like this, expected more like another ""Minutes To Midnight"", which I wouldn't have mind, but this is just... nothing..."
,DA2k12,2012-01-23T17:59Z,This album is NOT flac!!!
