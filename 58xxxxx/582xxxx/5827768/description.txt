Windows 7 is available in six different editions, but only Home Premium, Professional 

and Ultimate are widely available at retail. The other editions are focused at other 

markets, such as the developing world or enterprise use. Each edition of Windows 7 

includes all of the capabilities and features of the edition below it. All editions 

support the 32-bit (IA-32) processor architecture and all editions except Starter 

support the 64-bit (x86-64) processor architecture (64-bit installation media is not 

included in Home Basic edition, but can be obtained from Microsoft).


According to Microsoft, the features for all editions of Windows 7 are stored on the 

machine, regardless of what edition is in use. Users who wish to upgrade to an edition 

of Windows 7 with more features can then use Windows Anytime Upgrade to purchase the 

upgrade, and unlock the features of those editions. Microsoft announced Windows 7 

pricing information for some editions on June 25, 2009, and Windows Anytime Upgrade 

and Family Pack pricing on July 31, 2009.
