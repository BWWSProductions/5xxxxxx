Instruction updated on 10-Sep-2010 by HexMod

I did better instructions (added more details and pictures), because old
one was not so good and easy to misunderstand.

The procedure is quite long, but working ok and you'll
get 2048 days license.
Follow the instruction carefully.

[KIS 9 / KAV 9 *KNOWN ISSUE*]
Kaspersky is blocked from deleting Exploit which causes an alert: "no rights for 
replace clldr.dll" etc... just ignore it.

[NOT WORKING FOR YOU?]
* Maybe you are using unsupported version of KIS/KAV 
* On Windows Vista/7: try turning off DEP and UAC

[FALSE POSITIVE]
* Kaspersky falsely identifies this exploit as "Hacktool.Kiser"
* This is because it's used for hacking Kaspersky
* Add to "Exclusions" list 
  (wait for Kaspersky alert, then add to "Exclusions")
  (Ensure you set Kaspersky to ask before making decisions)
