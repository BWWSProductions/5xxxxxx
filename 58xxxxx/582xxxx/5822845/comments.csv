,badlands512,2010-09-15T11:02Z,"just like the 2010 version, kaspersky got it fixed as of today.... many files are replaced."
,CowboyDean,2010-09-15T14:08Z,"Darn it they're on to us!
Had Kaspersky 2011 patched for about 2 weeks, switched on this afternoon to be greeted with the message ""License is blocked""

Back to the drawing board... :-("
,Catalynn,2010-09-15T16:54Z,"I had it patched too for 2 weeks or so, and today the license was blocked. I got this patch thinking is newer and probably better, but is no longer working. Back to getting the licences every other day method :-("
[T],FTVDT,2010-09-28T09:17Z,"I'm using 11.0.1.232 version and all working ok (now is 2030 days remaining) and definitions update also working ok.
Now KIS tells that there is 11.0.1.400 version available. (released July 2010), but I don't update it.
I think this might be the problem...if you updated to 11.0.1.400 version, this license trick does not work anymore.

I think this ""license trick"" based on this ""bug""

Can someone confirm that issue? (version update affect this)"
,khfe,2010-10-21T09:36Z,"This patch does work. However, I am having a problem with the definition update. I can update all of the components, except ""Rules for security Analysis."" What should I do now?"
,siliconbrain,2010-12-05T14:56Z,"@FTVDT

I confirm that in 11.0.1.400 and later patch don't work."
