,F1Basic,2010-11-22T20:36Z,"How is the quality on this? Is it DVD? Good downloadspeed, have 150kb/s so far."
,Aciaeiig,2010-11-30T07:08Z,"@F1Basic, this is the best public package out there, I only collected the ones with the best quality."
,irPsymon,2010-12-08T19:12Z,Season 1 Episode 10 is not the right episode. Otherwise good quality.
,AdmiralAwesome,2011-02-04T22:21Z,ugh... ~150kbps untill EXACTLY 50% now its stuck... seeders please u/l the rest please?
,Aciaeiig,2011-02-07T07:38Z,"@AdmiralAwesome:
I have seeded over 200gb on this and my /up sucks. If it stopped at 50% I will come online again."
,Stevie173205,2011-02-27T23:45Z,"For some reason most of season 5 is only showing audio for me, no video. Does anyone know how to solve this?"
,Aciaeiig,2011-02-28T17:17Z,@Stevie173205: Maybe some codecs missing? 
,Stevie173205,2011-03-02T04:14Z,"Aciaeiig
Do you know how id go about fixing it?"
,Aciaeiig,2011-03-02T23:17Z,@Stevie173205: Try to open the file in VLC or MPC.. Google it and download the player :) 
,renegade3552,2011-03-10T17:24Z,I am able to download at 3.0 MBps and also seed at 3.0 MBps.
,zekeco,2011-03-23T11:55Z,Season 7 episode 7 is not the right episode. It's the same as season 7 episode 10 (and it really doesn't make sense when you see the episodes 8 and 9 after).
,weaping_reaper,2011-04-16T02:46Z,"I downloaded the first season only and it's going in the trash..
A/8
V/4"
,Darkfall666,2011-04-22T06:01Z,"Uhm...NONE of these are DVD rips. They all have TV logos in the corner. Don't call something a DVD rip when it's obviously not - it's damn annoying to download everything and find out it's not what it claims to be.

Also, all of these are 4:3. None of them are HD rips."
,mobbdeepreppa,2011-05-30T14:48Z,"How the fuck is this a DVDRip when the logo is on the corner of each vid.

I don't want to call you a brain dead dumb fuck, but man.... 

Your making it hard not to."
,iizmark,2011-08-04T18:17Z,"PLEASE SEEEEEDDD!!!!!!!

,Xobrien123,2011-10-16T09:52Z,SEED PLEASE! really want this series!
,acsmith1972,2012-01-08T20:20Z,"To the guy who reformatted his drive and needed to download this again, I have two words for you: external hard-drive. Every show I think is worth watching again, I have backed up to dvd. My music and video collection is backed up the same way, but I also have two extra externals. "
,Aciaeiig,2012-01-29T17:23Z,@acsmith1972. I have and I am seeding again:) I got new internet too so I hope it will be quicker :)
