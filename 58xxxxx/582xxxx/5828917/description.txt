BETTER SENSUOUS by Cornelius

This is an alternate version of Japanese avant-garde musician Cornelius' 2006 album 'Sensuous'. Like many, I was underwhelmed by Sensuous, but by adding a few b-sides released at the time into the playlist, switching up the running order, and getting rid of some of the tracks that sucked, a mature and conceptually focused album has emerged. 

Playlist:

Better Sensuous
Breezin'
Eyes
Fit Song
Clap&Whistle&Walking
Music (Japanese Version by Petra Haden)
Toner
Omstart
Beep It
Like A Rolling Stone
Music 
Sleep Warm 

I listen to this album a heck of a lot, and I listened to 'Sensuous' almost never, so I think this has been a big success. Enjoy and seed.
