Neonrainbow can you find some decent English Subs please!!

Thanks for all your other excellent Shares!"
,ChetanG,2010-09-14T21:33Z,"After watching this excellent Video (Fine Quality on the Video!!!!!)

KNOW THIS...IF YOU ARE NOT FRENCH DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOVIE. Because the subs are absolutely ridiculous and will make you crazy.
The French Person that did the subs does NOT know English except by what they think from a dictionary."

,ChetanG,2010-09-16T16:33Z,"Hey QborT, 
I did use your subs, they are English acceptable.

Thanks so much, Boy as it turns out all versions of this flick have the horrible FrenchyEnglish subs!

I used a subtitle program to take the correct timings from the horrible subs and change the subs you gave us to be correct timings for the movie."
,QborT,2010-09-16T18:23Z,"The subs I provided were timed properly for the ViSiON release.  Wasn't sure about this one, just figured I'd throw a link up for some actual understandable subs."
,ChetanG,2010-09-17T07:24Z,"So sorry for anyone that downloaded my ""Fixed"" subs as they were off by a second or so timing wise.

New Improved Subs here for this excellent flick.

,ChetanG,2010-09-17T07:42Z,"Hey QborT,
thanks again for your excellent English subs.

It took some work because yours started 7+ seconds before the actors began speaking.

That is the problem for different encodes as they all start at different times from millisecs to seconds. :)"
,QborT,2010-09-17T18:26Z,"They aren't my subs so no need to thank me, I just found better subs for a movie I was interested in and figured it would only be nice to share. :)

I wasn't sure about the timing of them, I do know they are in sync for the ViSiON release (if that helps others then I am not useless like my daddy used to say!!! haha)"
,davidouu,2010-09-18T18:50Z,They were my subs .....and they were created for the single cd FXG version of the movie which is freely available on PB.
,davidouu,2010-09-18T18:52Z,@chetang...............it is usually common courtesy to not claim other peoples work as your own and please...stop posting broken links all over TPB.
