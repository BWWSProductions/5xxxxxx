Really appreciate the effort to get this upped for peeps given the yoyo issues TPB is experiencing of late.

Peace. : )"
,DaugisxXx,2010-09-10T20:08Z,It's real or fake?
,DeltaPan,2010-09-10T20:54Z,"@DaugisxXx


SAFCukO09  is well trusted, look at the prior uploads and the skull icon.

The only way this would be fake is if somebody hacked the account, but don't think that's likely because it's usually uploaders who haven't upped in ages which get accounts hacked because there's less chance of the hacker being noticed at least for a while whereas somebody hacking SAFCukO09 would be sussed almost immediately, this uploader is a regular, i trust this without question.

Peace. : )"

What the hell is parting in 53 parts, then

Divide the video into 2?

Damn."
,rustedhalo,2010-09-11T06:19Z,"nice to burn on VCD but VLC won't play. Just stick to AVI's please. Thanks for putting this up early, but it's unusable to me."
[V],SAFCukO09,2010-09-11T07:04Z,So because this was all that was available i shouldnt have uploaded it because its no good to you ?  lmao@SAFCsuck shut up fool 
,DeltaPan,2010-09-11T12:08Z,"If a downloader can't use VLC properly, it isn't the encoder nor uploaders fault.

I use VLC myself and it played perfectly and consistant with PDTV quality.

Nothing wrong with it, if people want broadcast quality, pay for Sky frackin' sports!!!

Both complainers are just whingeing idiots &  ungrateful curs who can't respect the fact nobody owes them anything, they are getting something for free which others have taken time and effort to get to TPB!!!

Thanks again SAFCukO09. "
