@hhiclumsy- dont use winrar w/ iso, use alchohol 120 or demon tools to either mount it on virtual drive or burn to a dvd."

,Biglite,2012-06-23T03:59Z,"Yes. It seems like the installation failed to make shortcuts. Go to where the game installed itself, and you'll find the other .exe files. There should be 4 altogether; Regular Civ, Warlords, Colonization, and Beyond The Sword. Colonization is in another folder."
