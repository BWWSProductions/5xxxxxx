ON 13th you accepted my request and on the very same day uploaded it!!!!! im totally speechless. All i can say is thank you sooooo much. You rock."
,i_am_sid,2010-09-14T06:20Z,"Only able to download 45% for today as i have only 2 hours to download any stuff per day. But still able to play starting 4 mins of the video. I can say 
A/V  10/10. Excellent rip.
Cheers."
[V],twentyforty,2010-09-14T09:04Z,"@i_am_sid: Actually, I replied you with Yes to both one day before, on your first, detailed request (with imdb links) saying basically yes to 480p - and also the fact that Kikujiro is available (very hard to find) as relatively badly looking DVD (this encode) and Shinobi WAS released as BluRay and would be of much better quality.

I am, however happy with the fact that I found Kikujiro at all, but I am not very proud on AV quality of this encode. I have encoded a 320p version too, just in case. It's smaller file and someone with such limited download capabilities, as yours, should stick with smaller formats, especially when movies are long - as this one.

So - Shinobi follows early as this CET night-time - this time as BluRay rip, hopefully in much better quality, but it would be definitely to soon for you."

I gave it 10 as it is rarely and best available.
I actually have 6 hrs(free dnld from 2 AM to 8AM). You can see its hard to wake up at 2 AM. So my timing is 5 AM to & 7 AM (on college day) and 6 AM to 8 AM (on holiday). And i have maximum 180kbps download and 50 kbps upload speed. All this im saying to you because
1) As I can download 1.2 Gb per day good quality never bothers me. I'm very happy that you uploaded 480p.
2) I feel really sorry that i can not seed a movie. I'm already seeding 25-30 music albums(since 7 months when i got internet connection) and these have low or no seed and uploading each at less than 3 kbps. So you can imagine how much time it will take to seed a movie. 
I hope you understand my problem and wont mind.
Thanks."

If Hollywood followed his example, I'd be WAY more excited about their releases. I already know this will be a good movie, so here's a preemptive thanks!"
