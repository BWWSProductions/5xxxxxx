Kikujiro is an unlikely candidate to take a sensitive 8-year-old boy Masac on a quest to find the mother he's never met. But they're off on a trek through contemporary Japan, where they encounter an odd assortment of of offbeat characters. The wandering duo's adventure take them on a madcap tour of the Japanese counrtyside - from the races to an abandoned high-class hotel, and even to a gangster-infested carnival. Kikujiro is about children's games, and how they make us see exactly what went wrong in our own lives.
