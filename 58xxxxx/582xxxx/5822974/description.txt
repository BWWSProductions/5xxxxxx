          Bad boy Vanilla Ice, leader of a tough           
          motorcycle gang, rides into town and woos          
        the sweet natured Catherine. Trouble soon         
          rears its ugly head when it transpires              
           that her parents, who have been in a long             
             term witness protection programme, have             
            been found by the criminals they put behind         
           bars. Robert Matthew Van Winkle, aka Vanilla      
              Ice, burst on to the nation's conscience           
                in the early nineties with his massive hit    
                ICE ICE BABY, famously sampling Queen and     
                David Bowie's UNDER PRESSURE. It was the      
                first single by a rapper to hit number one    
                in the US making him an international mega    
                star. His 1991 film debut sees him on top     
                form and features cameos from Naomi Campbell  
                and Bobbie Brown.

                  When at all possible we like to bring      
                you the DVDs of films that we've previously  
                released under other sources and Cool As Ice 
                is no exception. We thought this day might   
                never come and although we'd still really    
                love a Blu-Ray copy we'll gladly take this    
                in the mean time. Finally, in glorious        
                widescreen, this amazing convergence of      
                post-80s and early 90s fashion, language     
                and style gets the treatment it has always   
                deserved. If you've never seen this movie,   
                now is the time! Cool as Ice catches the     
                zeitgeist of the unreal period in which      
                Vanilla Ice became the biggest rap star in   
                the world. Despite Vanilla's own short-      
                lived success this film has managed to       
           stand the test of time and is truly                
            deserving of its cult status.                        
                                                                    
                Lastly we'd just like to thank a friend            
             who helped make this happen. It's people            
          like him that keep this fun. Thanks again,          
          and thanks to all our friends who keep it

            Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to pres-          
           erving the neglected titles of an entertainment             
            era long gone. A time of classic kids flicks,                
          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless             
             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             
              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special
              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their
              many tools.

                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better
              days, we seek to relive those times, and share
              those memories. While our belief is that the
              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,
              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or
              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies
              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by
              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece
              just because it is dated.

                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital
              sources, there are still thousands of rare and
              out of print titles, many of which have no
              planned digital release. We've made it our
              mission to dig these out, clean them up using
              the best hardware and techniques available to
              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,
              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here
              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades
           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             
           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never           
         get back.
