When she was a deeply troubled teenager, Nikita
Maggie Q, "Mission Impossible III") was
rescued from death row by a secret U.S. agency
known only as Division, who trained her as a
spy and assassin. Nikita was eventually
betrayed by the only people she thought she
could trust. Now, after three years in hiding,
Nikita is seeking retribution and making it
clear to her former boss, Percy (Xander
Berkeley, "24") and her former friends Michael
Shane West, "E.R.") and Birkhoff (Aaron
Stanford, "X-Men: The Last Stand) that she will
stop at nothing to expose and destroy their
covert operation. Division continues to recruit
and train other young people, among them Jaden
Tiffany Hines, "Bones") and Thom (Ashton
Holmes, "Boston Legal"), erasing all evidence
of their former lives and turning them into cold
and efficient killers. One of these new
recruits, Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca, "Kick-Ass") is a
beautiful girl with a violent past and a story
not so different from Nikita's. The recruits all
spend part of their training with Amanda
Melinda Clarke, "The O.C."), a master

a swan and any bleeding heart into a killer
