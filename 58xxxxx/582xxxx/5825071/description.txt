Hi guys,
If you love Nirvana, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Offspring, Weezer, Ozma, Death Cab for Cutie, Placebo, The Thermals or bands inspired by Classic rock then you will love Death to the Mckenzies.  This is my first torrent created for the awesome Southern, Ca based Rock group, Death to the Mckenzies.  This is their first album entitled Control Theory. I believe they recorded it independently and released it on their own label P.C.P. Records.
Anyway, I've been waiting for this album since I saw them open for Weezer at the Palladium.  They are a kick ass band that actually rock and have an amazing energy on stage. So if you don't already own their cd, check it out, I think they rock and have a promising future.
So if you like them, support the band, you can find them at,, reverbnation.com/deathtothemckenzies or basically anywhere, just google or bing search them.
