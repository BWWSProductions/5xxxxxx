This is not an unknown problem.

Any suggestions are welcome as the my future share/seeds will go MUCH smoother."
,hasaboxi,2010-09-14T10:25Z,"Hi, how about Finnish audio??
Nordic normally offers that."
,DarkWolfDK,2010-09-15T15:27Z,"@hasaboxi.

I'm sorry. I have ripped the original DVD and left nothing out, and there where only Danish and Norwegian. I'm sure that you can find it in shops with Swedish and Finish Audio. I would rekomend to buy this and share!?

I got tired of getting home-made subs and no DVD menu and all the exstra material cut out.
So i have decided to do my own rip from original DVD's in nordic languages. Unfortunately i dont decide what audio tracks are on the DVD's, otherwise i would have included all 4 nordic countries."
