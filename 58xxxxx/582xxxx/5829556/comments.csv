added your WHEN WE LEAVE in my seedbox for a while..."
,fuckerr,2010-09-14T20:25Z,"@ gunnersrock : a few suggestions for u.
--it wud be great if u can add more info from imdb.com in the description area like a link of movie on imdb, ratings and brief plot of the movie..it helps user to know more about movie without going to imdb themselves..
--also if u cud keep a separate subtitle file instead of softcoding them with movie file..the users will find it easy to remove if they want to..
though these r just suggestions from me as a fan of urs...rest as u wish to keep it."

,penisfucker,2010-10-12T07:15Z,Nice upload. Thank you.
,tofushoyu,2010-10-15T16:22Z,"Nice movie, thanks for the upload!
Plz consider using AAC at 96k at least."
,muthineni,2010-11-21T08:52Z,"poor quality guys.avoid.
probably becoz the movie is too long.
but do try his other downloads. they r a lot better than this"
,264,2011-06-04T19:57Z,"A 10
V 8.5
Thanx Uploader"
,toenail88,2011-09-06T16:57Z,"thanks for this

but i have to say its quite poor quality, why not make it bigger? 800mb is way too small for 3 hour movie. i recommend people go for a better dvdrip instead.

,jjjxx,2011-11-02T13:37Z,"
Love this movie, and love small 720p files.. But this is just too small.  480p would look much better. A long movie like this should be 1.5-2.5 gigs."
