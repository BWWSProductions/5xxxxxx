Biography

One of the major Southern rock bands of the '70s, the Marshall Tucker 

Band was formed in Spartanburg, SC, in 1971 by singer Doug Gray, 

guitarist Toy Caldwell (born 1948, died February 25, 1993), his 

brother bassist Tommy Caldwell (born 1950, died April 4, 1980), 

guitarist George McCorkle, drummer Paul Riddle, and reed player Jerry 

Eubanks. The group's style combined rock, country, and jazz and 

featured extended instrumental passages on which lead guitarist Toy 

Caldwell shone. The band was signed to Capricorn Records and released 

their debut album, The Marshall Tucker Band, in March 1973. They 

gained recognition through a tour with the Allman Brothers Band and 

found significant success during the course of the '70s, with most of 

their albums going gold. Their peak came with the million-selling 

album Carolina Dreams and its Top 15 single "Heard It in a Love Song" 

in 1977.
