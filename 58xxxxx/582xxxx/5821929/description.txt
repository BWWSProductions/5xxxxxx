American Dad! is a satirical American cartoon series owned by Underdog Productions and Fuzzy Door Productions and produced in association with 20th Century Fox Television.

It was created by Seth MacFarlane, the creator of Family Guy and The Cleveland Show, as well as two former Family Guy writers, Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman. The pilot episode aired in the United States on Fox on February 6, 2005, thirty minutes after the end of Super Bowl XXXIX; the regular series began May 1, 2005, after the season premiere of Family Guy. American Dad! follows the events of CIA agent Stan Smith and his family. Unlike Family Guy, American Dad! does not contain cutaway gags, instead using situational humour and non sequiturs.

The series has completed its fifth season, which premiered on September 27, 2009 and ended on May 16, 2010. It has been officially renewed for a sixth season. Which I hope to upload too when it\'s shown.
