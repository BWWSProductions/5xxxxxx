,pezizzle,2010-12-22T21:53Z,"Season 2 is fine, but season 3 is the exact same episodes just labeled as the season 3 eps.

So if you download season 2 and 3, you are downloading the same eps, just mislabeled in 3.

Season 1 and 2 are ok, testing 4 after i find another torrent for 3."

,unogazzy,2011-05-24T21:50Z,"season 1 have 7 episodes, Season 2 have 16 episodes, Season 3 have 19 episodes, Season 4 have 16 episodes and Season 5 have 20. why do you upload this many episodes and not check it if it's CORRECT. and it is not just you there is other torrents here that's wrong too."
