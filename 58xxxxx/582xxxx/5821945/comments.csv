,rummy0319,2010-09-25T02:09Z,"Is this real?, like if I download it will Microsoft call it bad when I do something on it and make my system stop working, because I don't want to download it and be bad for my computer... so please tell me what this does to my computer."

,livelifekingsize,2011-08-12T10:00Z,"Dear Computer-User,

This is one of Great torrent I have come across these days. The installer is error less and the activation works like a charm. I thank you for your effort and wish that you will come with nice torrents like this one. 

I have one pc ( celeron 2.4, 1 GB, 80 GB ) which was very slow when I installed Windows 7 ultimate on it. However, after installing this one ( Home Basic) it is working fine. Thanks a lot as it would not have been possible without you.

Keep it up, you are the boss."
