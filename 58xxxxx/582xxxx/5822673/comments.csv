Its author was exposed during the Dover trial as an individual whose conception of science encompasses things like astrology. To top it off, the ""irreducible complexity"" arguments presented in the book have all been thoroughly dismissed in the context of evolution by natural selection. 

It is indeed more important than ever in that it patently reveals what a pathetic bunch of cave dwellers the creationist crowd are."

Please take some time to review them (if you really care) - they contain very little of logic. (Macro) evolution by natural selection is not scientific,  because it cannot be observer nor repeated. 

Thanks for the upload."
