Anything by ""Cats Can Fly""

Thanks again"

Thank you for all the dedication to upload your humongous and phenomenal 80s music collection man!!!

=)"
[V],80zforever,2010-09-15T03:34Z,"teejay, I have the record by Cats Can Fly and I think it's posted already in one of the 4 rare 80s batches. If it's not there I can post it for you but you need to take some time and check them all. sorry. Also I only have Mary Lu Zahalan 1990 CD not the 1982 record. which one are you looking for?

babygeorge, where have you been dude. was getting worried about you that you did not show up after Argentina's disasterous world cup lol
