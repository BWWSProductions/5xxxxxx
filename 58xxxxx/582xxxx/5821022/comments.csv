It looks like this isn't a DVD rip to me, but probably the same source as the one this uploader has gotten less than favorable reviews on here (also apparently mislabeled as a DVDrip)- http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5818207/Toy_Story.3.%5B2010%5D.R1.DVDRIP.XVID.%5BEng%5D-DUQA.avi"
,chefgeek,2010-09-18T07:25Z,"razvanripper, do you even have a clue, or just a fragile ego with the need for attention? People who download on this site aren't stupid and won't download your shit if you keep uploading this kinda crap and trying to look like you have quality stuff by putting DVDRip in the torrent title.  I will make sure to use your name anytime possible as the eample of who not to download from."
