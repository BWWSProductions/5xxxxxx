Drama set in a suburb of Rome, centreing on Giampiero, a thirteen year old boy, who dreams of escaping from the squalid area where he lives and travelling to distant lands. One day Romana, a young girl from the Romany community joins his class and Giampiero finds himself empathising with her. A tender relation- ship develops between the two adolescents and they are able to escape into a fantasy world, in spite of the racism and acrimony that result from the clash between culture and class in the adult world around them.
