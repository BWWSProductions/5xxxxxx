,thesabuser,2010-10-07T16:43Z,"Upon installing it connects to norton to activate my account, which comes along with a key in the key box. Below it says that this is a fake key. 
If i press the try later button it goes away but only for the time being.
Any suggestions boss?"
,abhi6,2010-10-07T21:04Z,"@thesabuser

,thesabuser,2010-10-08T03:27Z,"Mr. abhi6,
the 1st time I installed nav(without ntr) I got 90 days of subscription. But in the middle of full system scan it just shuts off and wont open again without restarting my pc. So i uninstalled it and restarted my pc, I even removed the files from the application data folder. But upon 2nd installation i get 0 days of subscription. I cant even turn off the product tamper protection to install ntr. Please help me."
,abhi6,2010-10-08T10:19Z,"@thesabuser
1. uninstall norton
2. install NTR
3. install norton again"
,blu07,2010-10-21T12:54Z,I downloaded both the anti virus and the ntr and they both working great for me. I'm running xp 32bit. Just follow abhi6 instructions and you wont go wrong. Thanks again abhi6
,iferhat,2010-10-26T04:36Z,"The best light and easy antivirus to use is Microsoft Essential Security. I'm running Windows 7 64bit full and Microsoft's Essential Security Antivirus is running perfect.

Visit: http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/resources.aspx and pick your version to suit your operating system.

ITS UP TO YOU, YOU MAY STILL PREFER OTHER SOURCES!"

Norton IS has all features of AV + some more eg. firewall
For complete protection use IS"

,thrash16er,2011-04-01T01:32Z,any other product keys? all these reached max
,irreponken,2011-05-11T13:18Z,"I had my NIS2011 working perfectly. Suddenly it shut off all protections. Uninstalled, rebooted, installed again, updated and Ran a full system check. It found 19 infections wich it sorted out. Installed NTR again. After a reboot it did the same thing, shut off all protections. So i uninstalled, purged with NTR. Installed everything again, rebooted and same thing again.

Could it be that NIS2011 detects the NTR or do i still have some sort of spyware wich removes my protections?

Sorry if the description is messy but i dont know how to type it better :p"
,irreponken,2011-05-11T16:35Z,I should probably add that i cant open the main window of NIS. Not from the tray icon and nor from my desktop icon.
,boondall,2011-05-15T02:51Z,same as above ^^^^^ . having the same problem on 2 computers. norton has just frozen up.
,mandriy722,2011-05-25T21:21Z,activ for work 90 day !
,XIalig,2011-07-17T11:00Z,"Norton and Kaspersky are the best out there no doubt, but using a unknown crack to get it is weird.  It is letting some underground person set up security at your house.  

It is even worse considering you can get these products for next to nothing through widespread promotions.  If you don't the hassles, then the free antiviruses like Avast are good enough unless you have the worst security habits so why take unnecessary risk.  

Your security software is the one piece of software on your computer that should be 100 percent legit and working.  "

,manicturtle,2012-03-13T01:21Z,"XIalig, If you honestly believe that buying this program is more ""secure"" than downloading this perfectly working version of Norton Antivirus, you don't know a single thing about how broken software works. I've had this program for over a year and its been working great. Once the 90 days are up all you do is uninstall it, re install it, download all updates, and its as good as new."
,jk04k1,2012-03-13T20:55Z,help please. i just need a subscription key. thank you very much
