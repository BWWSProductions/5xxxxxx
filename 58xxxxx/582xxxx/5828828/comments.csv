I don't know who you are, but damn those photos are not SEXY!
Nearly all of them are not professional, they're just taken from a concert or in real life. And she's wearing full clothing on about 100 of them (nope i don't get turned on by those).
And dude wtf, you have included photos when she's laying on the floor with her baybe! Oh so now babies are sexy....

And to make it even worse, everyone where low-res or rly bad quality, can only be used on maybe collages.

This....torrent....sucks."

,kishinevmoldova,2010-09-15T00:28Z,"But you've put ""Sexy"" and they definitely are NOT."
[V],nicobolso1899,2010-09-15T01:11Z,But thatÂ´s your opinion. 
,calvorin,2010-09-15T02:15Z,"The above comments were, I think, far too harsh.  Although there were some pics here that fit those descriptions, you can't expect every pic to be a hit in a collection of 500.  Many of them were, indeed, very sexy, quality was good, and I found some that I had never seen before.  Thank you for sharing this collection."
[V],nicobolso1899,2010-09-15T03:21Z,Thank you for your comment calvorin. I respect everyone opinion. I learn a lot from people comments. ItÂ´s always better a negative comment than a comment than is never made... or something like that...
