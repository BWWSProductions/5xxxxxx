,ioannisarc,2010-09-09T08:47Z,Thank you very much Malestrom. Don’t take too seriously  my last request. It’s only for a hobby that I rediscover last August. If it is difficult to find these books or if you see that there is no interest from other persons’ don’t upload them. Its OK for me. You have already uploaded plenty of useful books for other interests of mine and also for my work

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your generosity and your commitment to share this incredible photo retouch DVD. It is by far the best training material and I really learn a lot from videos. I highly recommend this training DVD for great quality photo retouch. It is amazing!Looking for your next uploads on the subject matter.

 Once again thank you so much! "
