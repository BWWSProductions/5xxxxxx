Made from 2nafish's upload (Thanks!)

I turned the video into a 16:9 NTSC DVD file and applied noise reduction in the video.

For audio, I used the cd audio to replace the original, which is of perfect quality. It is normalized too, to my personal levels.

(The small audio intro from the original video is kept...it's all there.) Audio = 224 kbps .AC3

Overall, quality it greatly increased.
