NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Machete 2010.

Right first off have to say we have not touch or re-encode prisms video on this...we left it as it was,because it 
was pretty nice anyway and didn't want to lose any Q by re-encoding.
Work done.....firstly it was a case of finding the missing scenes,roughly 1min 30 sec of them and then stripped them from the 
russian video.
At this stage we synced doeboy cams audio to these parts and filtered the video and resized it to match up with prisms release.
Once done we then took prism audio and re-encoded it and ran some filters over it and changed the EQ.....thought there was some
noise that could be cleaned up.....also we needed it to match the cam audio stats eg mp3 44100 etc....so we could append it later.
Now we needed to load prisms video into vdub and add the missing scenes.....so it was a case of add,cut,paste.
And then final after that we relayed the new audio file over the top.

Soon now enjoy a full version
