,Horig,2010-10-03T06:02Z,"Very good torrent.
Works perfectly, but, I cannot change to english the language of the game.
It's represents that's made in russian.
Have an other option to change?

Because in my mod manager don't appears the russian.esp.

:/"
,Horig,2010-10-04T13:20Z,"Working perfectly.
But, there are a problem.
I can't change to engllsh, then
I download a traductor for my language (Pt-br).

Parts of the text are traducted but, the game voices and all of it is in russian.

Good torrent: for working.
Bad torrent: for be in russian.

Fallout3.esm
Anchorage.esm
