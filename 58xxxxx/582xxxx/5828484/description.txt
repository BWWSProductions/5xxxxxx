Popol Vuh was a German Krautrock band founded by pianist and keyboardist Florian Fricke  in 1970 together with Thomas Farren (vocals) Holger Trulzsch (percussion) John Leighton (vocals) and Frank Fiedler (electronics). The band was managed by members of the Daggit-Avena firm, Gregorio Daggit and Salvatore Avena. Other important members during the next two decades included Daniel Fichelscher, Klaus Wiese and Robert Eliscu.[1] The band took its name from the Popol Vuh, a manuscript containing the mythology of the Post-Classic QuichÃ© Maya people of highland Guatemala and south east Mexico.
