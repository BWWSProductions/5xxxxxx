,ThoSni,2010-09-17T23:26Z,WHY MKV???? WHY???? It dosent work on PS3. IDIOT!
,jesbuny,2010-09-19T16:31Z,"@ ThoSni - no need to be such a dickwad. If you're going to cussing complain, why don't you upload it."
,g8aso,2010-10-06T05:34Z,"It wouldn't be in Hi Res if it wasn't in mkv!
This is the equivalent to an avi file of a normal DVD.
Don't complain about free stuff, and keep quiet until you have the gumption to upload something yourself."
