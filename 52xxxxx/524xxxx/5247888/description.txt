It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
essential to seek information from a variety of sources,
to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better
understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
mainstream corporate media for news and info is a
prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

Think for yourself!
To paraphrase the late William Cooper:
Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing
until you've researched it yourself.
