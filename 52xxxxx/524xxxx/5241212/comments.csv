,sribop,2009-12-25T19:48Z,Does this include the series John Byrne started in the late 80s/early 90s? I've been looking for that.
,Mercyflush64,2009-12-26T07:58Z,Looks like an awesome collection on a character I was wanting to read more about. I can't get this torrent to even start without the uploader ever seeding it. I started it 9 minutes after it was posted and have completed 160kb so far.
,Deznaj,2009-12-26T11:17Z,"This dude uploaded several Marvel comic torrents, yet he isn't seeding any of them!

Firs law of torrenting: If you can't seed (or don't know what you're doing), DON'T DO IT!!!"
[T],LukeSky3,2009-12-29T13:56Z,"lol, you guys like to complain : )

My computer needs to rest sometimes, give him a break please.

I always upload until at least there are 10 seeders.

I also upload the same torrent to other sites, so if in TPB appears 0 seeders that maybe isn't true."
