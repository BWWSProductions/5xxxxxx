,Xcel432,2009-12-31T08:38Z,"Ciscoman, quit being racisit..dammit...LoL..j/k

I dont know if it hass anything to do with the fact that their black, I think it has more to do with the fact that their hard headed, LoL...there are a few great Black actors... it's more lack of talent than it is anything to do with ...

And no im not Black or Racist but dammit I can have a few bigoted moments once in awhile..LoL..."

,khyfleming,2010-01-12T22:10Z,"To: ciscoman, Just so you know, there is such a thing as racism ""within"" a race. You say you're black, yet you make negative remarks about black people and movies they're in. Well I also happen to be black and I call that a racist remark. "
,yungknowledge,2010-01-13T16:39Z,ciscoman: shut up u a fuck boy
,xspade,2010-01-16T01:00Z,"cisco you're a dumb ass
that is too racist whether you're black or not
and I'm not black :)
also, Tyler Perry's movies are the best, you can suck shit!"
,OGma59,2010-01-17T01:54Z,"can we please cut all the cross talk regarding being racist or not??  i agree that there are many talented black actors and actresses, but Tyler Perry's movies are not generally where they are found.  these movies are just to be funny, not to display Academy award winning performances.  try watching ""Precious"" if you want to see a movie with an all black cast and then tell me black people can't act  by the way, i am white.
now can we please get a rating on the audio and video quality of this upload???
thanx to the upper, bone, for his/her work."

,mtp1178,2010-03-15T17:05Z,"In ciscoman defense, I too am black and I understand and agree with him. The roles that black actors/actresses play in an all black production are always stereotypical and wayyyyy overboard. You always have ""the angry black woman"" who has been hurt and now hates all men, the ""I'm a good guy (sucka) black man"" who all ways takes way more shit than a normal human being, then the infamous ""loud mouth"" this role can be played by some of another race, usually a minority. "
,zhennessy,2010-04-23T17:25Z,"

Well okay, it is true that sometimes (black actors) ESPECIALLY in TYLER PERRY movies act in roles stereotypical to the AFRICAN AMERICAN ... This is in reference to a comment on this page that says something about movies with mostly black actors sucking..well well that's entirely(not true=false=bullshit) because black people and  black actors are some of the most prestigious and creative charismatic  in Hollywood and THE FACE OF THE EARTH...
and i don't believe that the person that wrote this nonsense is really black.... you're probably some little filthy CuCaRaCha and if you are African American you should have some respect for your race..because it's one of the Three Great

Sincerely ,
i'm a WhiteMan "
,cllgegrl,2010-06-25T21:16Z,quality was great. tysm for uploading
,impunchdrunk,2011-08-08T01:40Z,"Ciscoman, shut what they call.... THE FUCK UP!! You only WISH you were black you stupid bitch. Movies with all black actors can be just as good or just as bad as movies with all white actors. For you to even spout off with that dumb statement proves that you're not black. Get off your cat and go rustle up some moutain osters you dumb fuck."
