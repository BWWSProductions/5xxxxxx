Brought to you by TQMP. (The Quality Music Project)

In this project me and my fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewelcase. Well, you all know the drill :)

Please feel free to join the TQMP project! Since all TQMP torrents are tracked by countless other trackers by now, the lifetime of your uploads will increase by a BIG margin ;)

The "rules" are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless FLAC format AND include artwork.

You can find all TQMP uploads at: www.thepiratebay.org/tag/tqmp
