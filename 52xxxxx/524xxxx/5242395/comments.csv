You probably have either corrupted file (it happens, file is playable on computers but cannot be transfered by paranoid iTunes.

It would be stupid to re-encode it again, right? There is a fat chance that your iPod/firmware cannot digest that new (hyphotetical) encode too.

So,you can follow some advice given on doom9.org forum:

Just popping in, you can bypass iTunes quite easily.

1. Create a very small compatible MP4.
2. Sync with iTunes.
3. Open iPod drive in Explorer, look for the very small MP4.
4. Replace it with your own MP4. Make sure the name matches.

Make sure iTunes doesn't try to re-sync!"""
,sassymoon,2009-12-26T18:21Z,"thanks for this one, twenty :) how was your christmas? i hope it was a good one. "
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-26T18:23Z,"BTW, this encode has subtitles muxed-in the mp4 container.
That was The Reason why I have opposed to classifying my encodes as ""Movies-Handhelds"" and moving them there by moderators.

Subs was the exact reason, and I have mentioned that specifically. Dozen of times after first few ""incidents"". Now you see who was right.

Now, you can upgrade your firmware or play subtitled movies on computer..."
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-26T18:27Z,"@sassymoon: Thanks. For the thanks. And above wasn't for you, but for ""addictedtomovies"".

PS: Xmas was warm and - sad and quiet. But thanks for asking."
,nemesis160,2009-12-26T18:44Z,thanks man............ur the god.........thaks once again...dude any chances of how i met ur mother complete seasons............anyways thanks foe the taking woodstock also........great quality man/.........loved it
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-27T09:26Z,"@addictedtomovies:
You may try to remove subtitles tracks from otherwise ipod compliant file:
- Google and download mp4box; it is free program, available for all platforms (operating systems)
- Google and download mediainfo, it's also free tool, to get which tracks are subtitles - usually video is Track 1, audio Track 2 and subtitles are 3, 4 and so forth...
- put mp4 in folder together with mp4box, open CMD box there (or shell window) and issue:
>mp4box -rem 3 *.mp4
and if needed
>mp4box -rem 4 *.mp4 and for any subtitle track you want to remove, by changing respective track number (3,4,5...)

Do it with copy of mp4, not with the ""original"" in case that something goes wrong.

Resulting (new) mp4 would be without removed tracks which may cause troubles for ipods without international/timedtext support in the firmware.
Old and the new file are perfectly compliant with ipod."
