**** INFORMATION FOR THE PIRATE BAY USERS:****


 This is a small torrent on how to access the larger 20.43 GB 1970â€™s FLAC music torrent. As in the past, the original folder is too big due to the cap TPB has on the amount of files allowed within a torrent. In the other folder within this torrent is the .torrent that you can double click on and will open in your client. Also, hereâ€™s some links to a couple other sites where the torrent is posted that, unlike TPB, has no cap.




This is a personal folder I made that I thought I would share.






Please help seed these FLACs!
