Seeding would be muchly appreciated."

,bremster,2010-01-16T20:48Z,thnx. It works!
,Blackbyrd,2010-01-27T23:50Z,"I've already got the game installed, I manually updated it to 1.8.2  but My Sims 3 Characters won't walk? (Only use Taxis even for a foot away)? My characters in the Sims 3 won't walk anywhere, and they can't get into their house. I just started the game and these taxi's keep popping up. How can I stop this and let them just walk inside or around?? Or just play the game? "
,Blackbyrd,2010-01-28T04:10Z,"OK I'm following your instructions, excuse my brain fart here, but I went to HKEY_LOCALMACHINE/SOFTWARE/ and I don't see a folder that says Sims at all. Am I just thick as a plank or is it different in windows 7?"
,linna2010,2010-01-28T18:43Z,"SEED PLEASE!!
I stuck at the 1.8.25 patch... It updated, but now the crack don't works... :C"
,Grusskagg,2010-02-02T21:34Z,Wow i had problem with this a month. Now i got it work becuase of you. Thanks !! Wonderful.
,loumaty,2010-02-11T08:54Z,"does this solve the ""A file can not be found"" problem when i run the patch ??"
,Lenoir333,2010-02-12T13:30Z,"I'm back. Worked like a charm. I've played for a month with absolutely no problems, thank you very much. But now i'm back because a new patch came out and i can't use Awesomemod without patching the game(that's the only reason i'm patching the game) :(. I don't know how to patch it further. Whenever i try it says ""invalid file found"", probably because it's cracked. Conclusion : an update for this torrent would be awesome! Thanks."
