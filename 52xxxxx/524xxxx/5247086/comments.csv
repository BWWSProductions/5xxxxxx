,Sabre_of_Pain,2011-07-09T03:19Z,"video quality is lacking, considering the file size, and there appears to be some minor interference with the audio
its certainly watchable, but I would expect the episodes to be smaller at this level of quality."
,Fez8745,2011-07-25T03:14Z,"I'll Post up the Full Black Lagoon Series then. All in English, Its Duel Audio so if you DO want it in Jap you can get. 
I've Completed Stargate Universe S2, unfortunatly that series is dead now, So thats the end.
FMA Brotherhood has pretty much Paused for now, So it only goes up to episode 52, The Next dvd of it was ment to be released last month.
Any other Wants Tell and i'll see if i can get"

,Fez8745,2011-08-04T13:45Z,"I'll check it out, Now that i look it seems like a good anime, I'll want to watch it :)"
,DarkMario616,2011-08-07T17:37Z,"Absolutely terrible quality for 8 gb. Learn to fucking compress and use the right codecs.

Video: 6
Audio: 8

Audio gets an 8 because episode 7 and 8 so far have some fucked up static sound every few seconds. (R2)

Also, the first few minutes of episode 6 are missing...what the fuck.

Morons put this shit together."
,paz45,2011-08-09T14:23Z,please put it up fez that would be great and thanks for putting code geass up

,Willhelm53,2011-08-27T21:54Z,Weird. I seem to get constant background static throughout the test episode I downloaded (R1 Ep6)
,Captain_Aizen,2012-06-22T03:08Z,"The quality of these episodes are absolutely horrible. If you want DVD or BRay rips, look elsewhere. This upload was truly a waste of time."
