,Vapollo000,2010-03-17T18:00Z,"The only thing that bugs me with this scan is the lighting in which it was done, resulting in very distorted colouring especially on pages with pictures. I have the book in physical form as well and when I compare the two, I don't think I can use this copy even as a portable reference on my laptop to carry around with me since in no way does it portray the work of Jung's hands in the way it deserves. And of course the English translation and editorial notes would have made an excellent adition."
,Vapollo000,2010-03-17T23:44Z,"I downloaded another version and it was of much greater quality, plus it contained the English translations and editorial notes in full! Check it out as an alternative!

I'd love to buy the book, but can't afford $120+ for a used copy.
