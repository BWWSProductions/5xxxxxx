,oxide17,2010-03-15T01:34Z,"jontap missed the step

you have to go to library > CACHES

then look for the folder com.atomix and delete it."

,190919,2010-03-15T08:13Z,what bullshit! doesn't work for Snow Leopard!
,dupspyda,2010-03-17T04:50Z,"Hint, U cant be connected to the internet. Load the virtual dj and go to the configure button. click on the internet tab and uncheck ""use netsearch"" and uncheck ""Use Music Groups"". mine has worked ever since. 

P.S. u can be connected to the internet while running virtual dj after you perform this step."
,elwe2k,2010-03-29T08:03Z,"mine doesn't start anymore, it crashes and then shuts down. got the cache folder removed but it still keeps shutting down... I have this problem since I wanted to get some effects.... please help!"
,dupspyda,2010-04-01T08:21Z,"""mine doesn't start anymore, it crashes and then shuts down. got the cache folder removed but it still keeps shutting down... I have this problem since I wanted to get some effects.... please help!""

The answer to this is that you can not get any effects because this is a pirated version of VDJ. to get effects you have to download them from VDJ's sight and for this you have to connect your virtual dj to the internet. as i said in the above thread, one it connects to the internet and recognizes that it is a pirated copy, VDJ corrupts itself and you have to delete it and reinstall it. You will do best to just be thankfull for this free copy."
,st812998,2010-04-25T22:13Z,what is the serial key to manually enter after deleting the one file
,djquikvic,2010-04-26T06:25Z,"OK I TOO HAD NUMEROUS PROBLEMS INCLUDING THE PROTECTIONS ERROR BUT 


--------HERE IS THE STEP BY STEP----------

1. INSTALL THE VIRTUAL DJ DMG AND RUN THEN CLOSE
2. DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL APPDELETE
LINK: http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/23149/appdelete

OR JUST GOOGLE IT - ITS FREE/NO TRIAL BS

3. RUN APP DELETE AND FIND VIRTUAL DJ THEN HIT SEARCH AND DELETE ALL THE CORRESPONDING DATA 

4. RESTART YOUR COMPUTER (YES IT IS NECESSARY SO DONT SKIP THIS STEP)

5. RUN THE DMG AGAIN AND THIS TIME IT SHOULD ASK YOU FOR A SERIAL. 

6. INSERT SERIAL - PERSONALLY COPIED AND PASTED AND WORKED FOR ME *BIG DEAL* OF THAT DONT WORK THEN WRITE IT IN UR SELF WHICH DIDNT WORK FOR ME.

,TheArchiver,2010-06-17T00:12Z,"Hi everyone,
I can install this nice and easy, works perfectly with my Hercules RMX console, I can make all the changes I want in the config. But when I restart my Mac Book Pro, Virtual DJ crashes on startup.
I've tried this many times. I use AppZapper to uninstall each time, and I delete both the Virtual DJ folder in Documents, and the files in Library/Caches and in Library/Preferences.
Thanks in advance for your help!"

,Joshwins,2010-09-11T22:35Z,"Seems to crash everytime i open it now, used to be fine :S"
,othernash,2010-09-22T05:18Z,"I was getting the crash on open error, and then I realized that not onlye do you have to have auto update off, but ""use netsearch"" and ""use music groups"" must be unchecked as well. If you have installed it already, the easy fix is to disable your internet connection, and the program should start right up. Then go into the menus and change those settings. It should be running like normal now!"
,alestef,2010-10-01T21:56Z,"so...worked out very fine. thx to everyone who posted something that may help. after installing got it started and immediatly unchecked everything whatÂ´s needed for communications with the i-net. VDJ crashed...but after starting the second time everything worked out great, even the serial. "
