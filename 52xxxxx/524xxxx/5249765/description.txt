Infected Mushroom Complete Discography Perfect -iRi5

I Found this release and it has everything done as it should be done!

Everything done right -> folders, file naming, id tags (V2.3)...
There's also seperate Art Work folders and the mp3s have art inside!
The Quality:
Albums - 320kbps (Legend of the Black Shawarma 224kbps vbr)
Singles And EPs - 320 to 192kbps (except Symphonatic 160kbps) 
Unreleased Tracks Promo Samplers - 320 to 128kbps
Live Sets - 320 to 192kbps
Other Tracks and Releases - 320 to 128kbps

What more can you ask for!?
So, get rid of your shitty organized & tagged stuff and replace em with some fresh shrooms!!

ENJOY!

Before anyone comments, that this is missing "a track",
please, do little bit of researching and kindly provide proof, 
that track in question is really made by Infected Mushroom!
Clearly, this is NOT Amit & Erez "collection", 
meaning that this would have everything that they ever touched! 
This is ONLY Infected Mushroom!
Also, Incase you did enjoy this release, 
please leave a nice informative comment for others, 
incase they come a cross this release!

Thanks to iRi5!
