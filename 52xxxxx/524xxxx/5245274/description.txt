Hello people. 
It's been a year since I've made my first playlist. Back then I felt kind of devastated when I faced the fact that Criznittle, a guy who was responsable for our amazing enlargment of music horizon was no longer going to make playlists.
If I recall it now, my first playlist was a way worse than anything that made Criznittle before and it could not be compared at all but I was really keen on the idea of not leaving indie/rock playlists to decay.
I'm also extremly pleased that I was not alone who had the same intention of continuing compiling some selections of new music for all of you. So thanks to Blalock, daKradha and others. You should definetely check this site out /www.blalocksirp.com/ if you haven't done already. 
They're both making a monthly lists contrary to my season lists and have to say that both are doing it very well and it's pretty damn right to say that they fully managed to maintain this playlist happening. 

I'd like to dedicate this playlist to Criznittle and anyone who has been into these playlists and basically to anyone who listens to "good" music

in 2010 you may see some projects coming regarding indie/rock playlist. Together with daKradha we'll planning to come up with something new.
I hope you gonna enjoy it and I also wish you a happy New year!
