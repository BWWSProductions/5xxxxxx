,office_cat,2010-01-07T01:46Z,"doesn't work. It says i'm missing a .dll file... copied the crack after installing, but no luck."
,Pooftah,2010-01-12T21:20Z,"Office cat: Try installing direct x 9c from the autorun menu. Bol_shoy, the crack is in the disc, you just have to browse it and find it in a map called crack! Works for me! Thanks Totenkruez"
,Pooftah,2010-01-12T21:30Z,"One more thing! Start the game with the crack file you copied into the install directory, otherwise it wont work!"
,office_cat,2010-01-12T23:17Z,God Bless you my son.. God bless... :)
,Mr6oodkat,2010-01-18T13:11Z,"I know this may sound stupid, but what and where is the installation directory?"
,Mr6oodkat,2010-01-18T18:11Z,"Scrap that last comment, I've installed it, moved the crack but when I start it up, it says either to insert the correct CD/DVD or that the program had to shut down. I mounted the image using daemon tools, installed direct x. I am using windows vista, if that helps."
,Mr6oodkat,2010-01-18T20:12Z,"Screw it, I've given up. :P"

,Troqe,2010-02-06T22:42Z,"Confused....just finished downloading this, opened up the .rar to find:

31 rld-h5ce files, which are packed...at first glance they look identical to me..are they?

and also there are 22 unpacked rld-h5ce.n files, the n represents random numbers.


What am i meant to do with all these?

Thanks for the help!"
,darbyson,2010-02-13T23:11Z,ok i installed everything i have 31 identical .rar files and 24 other files do i winrar all the 31 .rar files someone help please!!!
,reativica,2010-02-16T01:22Z,I found the crack but where is the directory?
,Warnlorn,2010-02-17T11:55Z,"It works for me.

@ Darbyson - rar the files, start the first rar file and it will unpack all of them automaticaly. Then u need to use a program that can open .iso files like PowerIso and isntall the game

@ reactivica - the directory should be somewhere like - C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Heroes of Might and Magic V Collector Edition\bin

My question - anyone tried instaling the 1.2 patch and found a crack for it??"
,Geehood,2010-02-23T16:04Z,"Iv downloaded it, installed it, installed direct x Put in crack go up to play set up the game...Then when its loading it blacks out back to my desktop and says theirs been an error with the game..Help me fix it please i want this game."

,romanmoga1992,2010-03-21T20:37Z,"@ office_cat
If your missing a file called ""*.dll"" then type the full name of the .dll file into google and download it then copy it into your ""Windows"" folder. Good luck!"
,traislow,2010-03-24T17:48Z,will the crack be found in a foulder called crack directory cous i dont se any....and it should b placed in data folder right?

,kreaper,2011-01-04T07:17Z,works fine after installing all the patches on win 7 64 bit... however it has a tracker and my internet service provider sent me a letter about it. just fyi
,storeslem86,2011-01-07T00:46Z,"Skulle gjerne spilt heroes over nettet, noen som vet av sted jeg kan finne det?

Would like to play heroes through the internet, anyone know where I can find that?"
,Reve,2011-07-12T13:46Z,I don't know what version this is but IT IS NOT THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION. These files contain Heroes 5 version 1.0 from 2006. Crack timestamp is from 2006. Tribes of the east expansion came out 2007.  Maps added in patches are missing. Total filesize is too small to contain all the expansions. AVOID.
