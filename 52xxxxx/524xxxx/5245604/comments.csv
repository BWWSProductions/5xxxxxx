,ReatKay,2010-02-18T15:44Z,"looks ok for me... special installer that directly installs the cracked version. Runs fine... no crashes so far... 

tested with AdAware+ & NOD32: looks malware-free"
,ReatKay,2010-02-19T14:10Z,i just received errors on uage of the bonus scenery objects - causing crash on rtc3. workaround: delete the buggy materials in your themed-directory of rtc3. If u discover this error too: try deleting everything which is not from the game or the addons.
