With the end of a decade comes a few new games. Out of four, here's the fourth and final game: Ape Escape, the first and undoubtedly the best game in the series. As with Heart of Darkness, there used to be a previous upload of the game, but it apparently lacks any seeds now. Consider this a "pseudo-re-seed" of sorts. So, actually, these four games may be nothing new to some people (besides Rescue Shot). Whatever, they're up again, and that's what matters. Ripped with MagicDisc, tested on ePSXe and it worked fine. If you like it, seed it, and if you've got something to say about the torrent, go ahead and leave a comment!

NOTE: If you're using an emulator (such as ePSXe), it is recommended that you use a gamepad.

Happy new year, everyone!
