Just take the .RAR file and drop it into a folder on your C:\ Drive. Make sure that folder is empty. Then Just open the RAR and extract here. Done."

,Stig_gitS,2011-04-20T06:25Z,"If anyone has troubles with the ACMBOOT.exe error after your computer reboots (the first time) simply double-click the ACMBOOT.EXE (Application) file manually. It worked fine for me. 

Ran VB just as a quick test and all is well. No probs No errors.

,moonsky,2011-06-28T15:13Z,"""I found that ONLY MSJAVA.DLL file is required to be in Windows\System32 folder to make the VB6 installer think that Microsoft Virtual Machine for Java is already installed. In fact you don’t even need a real copy of MSJAVA.DLL file. You can simply create an empty file from notepad and save it as MSJAVA.DLL to Windows\system32 folder.""
