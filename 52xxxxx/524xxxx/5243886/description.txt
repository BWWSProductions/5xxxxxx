"I'm Still in Love with You" is song by Jamaican dancehall artist Sean Paul from his second album Dutty Rock. It features Sasha. It reached #6 in the UK, #13 on the U.S. R&B chart, and #14 on the Billboard Hot 100. It became a top ten hit in Italy, Ireland and Switzerland.

The song is an interpolation of "I'm Still in Love with You" by Alton Ellis.

Sean Paul and Sasha (the female counterpart) are discussing a stalled and seemingly unfulfilled relationship. Paul's character is trying to persuade her to keep the relationship going; the girl seems willing to but clearly wants more, though she wants Paul to know she still loves him.

Dutty Rock is the second album by reggae/dancehall toaster Sean Paul. It was released on November 26, 2002. It features two U.S. #1 singles, "Get Busy" and "Baby Boy" with Beyonce. It also features singles "Gimme The Light", "Like Glue" and "I'm Still in Love with You", which all charted in the top 6 on the UK Singles Chart. The album itself reached #2 on the UK Albums Chart, and #9 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Albums Chart. It is also his first and only album so far to have a Parental Advisory sticker. The album sold 65,000 in its first week and went on to become an international phenomenon, selling over 6 million worldwide.

In 2003 the following year, Sean Paul released an edited version of the album intended for international markets. The re-release took off all skits and the single "It's On", also featuring the now accessible hit single "Baby Boy". The single is a duet by BeyoncÃ© and Sean Paul. It became one of the biggest hits in 2003 spending nine weeks at number one. The album sold over 2 million copies in the U.S. and helped him become a Grammy Award winning artist.
