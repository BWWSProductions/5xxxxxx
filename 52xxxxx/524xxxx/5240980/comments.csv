[V],twentyforty,2009-12-26T10:12Z,"@mary: Closer, unfortunately, never had more than dozen downloads. You must know that transport stream (what I tend to use) is 4-8 GB big... Gigabytes... and that for every each one of episodes. Take into count that pure encoding take 4 hours... So, doing any show for few people is - sorry - stupid and a waste not only of time and bandwidth.
Also, recent ""switch"" to TPB have a really bad consequence: people who download something from here acts like ""grab and run"", there is no sense of community, responsibility toward others and no solidarity, not as not at all, but in traces only. My ""ups"" stays without seeders in 24 hours...
I even consider to continue with my work or not, from crumbs I cannot function nor live.
I hope you have understood, especially on my ""broken"" English.
However, I have last four episodes of Closer, and I will up ones you don't have (12, 13, 14) in same time as you post above has, every day one, to ease your traffic a little. This is best I can do, right now."
