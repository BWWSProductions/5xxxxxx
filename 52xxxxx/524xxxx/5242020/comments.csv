[V],Kitlope,2009-12-26T17:23Z,"ok thanks for the reply. Keep up the good work Dick :)

Do you post your torrents on Demonoid? Its a good site too but may need an invite"
[V],dickspic,2009-12-26T18:11Z,"tried to but says registration full.
wait a week got 3 rodney crowell albums coming from amazon,present from my son:)"
[V],Kitlope,2009-12-26T22:05Z,"Ahhh excellent. I have a FLAC Rodney Crowell torrent up with 3 of his first albums so hopefully yours are different. If you haven't grabbed them yet the link is here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4873270/Rodney_Crowell_-_3_Albums_(1978_-_1981)_[FLAC]_-_Kitlope


Also, it sounds like you need a Demonoid invite. I can give you one, just email me. Kitlope04@yahoo.com


Perhaps between all the Rodney Crowell albums that the 2 of us have we can put up a multi-album torrent, maybe even a discography :)"
