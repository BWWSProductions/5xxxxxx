,madgefan,2010-01-25T22:33Z,"Wow! This looks amazing, but instead of those bonus tracks, you could add some 80's performances. Anyway thank you so much :D"
,Fighter02,2010-01-26T11:12Z,I don't think adding many performances to a Music Video collection makes sense... that's for a Performances DVD Collection...the reason why I included Holiday at Solid Gold is because that was used as a music video for the song back then.
,madgefan,2010-02-05T04:25Z,When are you going to upload the second part of this wonderful collection? :D
,Fighter02,2010-02-08T07:43Z,I'm working on it... later this month I think it will be up.
,madgefan,2010-03-25T23:37Z,"I liked the first volumen and I'm very curious about the second one! Will it include all 90's videos or just the first half of that decade, cause they are a lot :)"
,Fighter02,2010-04-05T20:16Z,From This Used To Be My Playground to Nothing Really Matters :)
,mictrmbl,2010-04-13T09:11Z,is it 5.1 or 2.0?
,Fighter02,2010-04-18T11:30Z,There are no mixes available in 5.1 of Madonna's songs. The 5.1 in Celebration is not a real proper mix. This DVD includes stereo PCM audio.
,yurune,2010-06-04T12:41Z,"Wow, thanks for this, I love 80s Madonna!"
