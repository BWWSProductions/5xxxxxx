         The Sierra Nevada, North America's highest mountain range,    
         contains one of the most awe-inspiring geological features    
         on the planet: Yosemite Valley. Walled by sheer 3,000-foot    
         granite cliffs and made from one of the toughest rocks on     
         earth, it is home to the mighty El Capitan and iconic Half    
         Dome. Yet how this extraordinary valley formed has been the   
         subject of controversy for over 100 years. Was it carved      
          by gigantic glaciers or a cataclysmic rifting of the Earth?
