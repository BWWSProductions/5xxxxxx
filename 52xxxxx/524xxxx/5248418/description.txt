This is the best Tetris Game and Arkanoid/break-out game ever made PERIOD. 
I have played a lot of tetris clones, and this one blows the rest out of the universe.

This is Arcade Convoy. It is 6 arcade style games in one game. I came across this a few days ago and I was amazed at how different their Tetris game (Shape Shifter) was. There are over 40 different Tetris Game Types and they are completley different than any other Tetris game I have ever played, and I have downloaded a lot of Tetris Clones because I have loved Tetris since I was a kid.

And they have a game called Brick Buster, which is similar to arkanoid/breakout except it seems a lot more action packed in my opinion. Plus they have a bunch of different card games that you can play.

They have a ton of screen shots on their web site http://www.arcadeconvoy.com

This is just my opinion, the Tetris game play is like nothing you have ever seen I guarantee it. It also has very unique and different type of graphics. You can play on several different levels that include hundreds of different sky and brick animations. Plus a cool particle engine.

If you do not believe me then you can just check it out for yourself. That is why I made the torrent.
