,mr_187,2009-12-31T10:33Z,Still no dice come up as traktor pro on 1.2.0 there was 2 patch files one for traktor pro and one for traktor scratch pro. Guess I have to wait for another release :( back to crappy serato.
,PacroFella,2009-12-31T12:14Z,"Mr 187 , the timecode settings is only on traktor scratch pro.. examine the programe proprly. its very simple "
,PacroFella,2009-12-31T22:08Z,"Yes, it will work with the demo fron NI once its version 1.2.3.. my last torrent consists of the demo


try it and see, but this torrent has the tsp settings in it "
,Berro-1994,2010-01-05T22:46Z,"Am I the only one that gets a warning from my anti-virus program (avira) that the Patch'd Traktor exe. file is a trojan? 
Is this file safe to use?  "
,PacroFella,2010-01-06T02:58Z,"berro, i scanned it  with eset nod 32 and MSE got no probs... i kno a couple ppl who scanend with KIS and got no probs either

but those with AVG and Avira seems to be gettin warnings... do the maths "
,brapster,2010-01-06T11:38Z,"McAfee gives a warning too. And Virustotal show that 13 out of 29 scanners returns with a warning.
I don't trust this."
,PacroFella,2010-01-07T04:59Z,"well, if u dont trust it dont use it !! 

i really not out to concince ppl... i uploaded it here for those who want it "
,brapster,2010-01-07T10:41Z,"You're right, and it's actually a really cool upload. I was very excited about this. But when so many AV programs gives a red alert over an .exe file then it's really not worth it imo. Just letting other ppl know that's all :-)"
,kk_br,2010-01-27T00:27Z,"Sorry pal. Trojan alerts both with AVG and Spyware Doctor.

I believe that your intentions are good too, but it's looking very risky. Especially with a kind of software that cannot fail (playing live)."
,Crail007,2010-03-10T23:58Z,i installed step by step. the patch works great and i can also open it. But it is Traktor Pro - not Traktor SCRATCH pro. I examine the programm carefully but i cant change it to scratch pro. Can you explain how can i change it? i am desperate this programm! please help me :)
,djnickq,2010-03-23T01:24Z,i did everything but when i open up traktor it still says would i like to run the demo. what did i do wrong?
,ambiant01,2010-05-27T14:20Z,"I have the same problem no timecode function after patching, everything else works just fine, except for the most important feature for me. Hope for a solution soon"
