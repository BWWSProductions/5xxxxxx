ok, 

I'm posting this mainly for help with this torrent : 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5245806

For those of you having problems with it being pro and not scratch or what ever etc..

The .rar file contains (2)two executable files namely:

(1) nspn - 16.8mb
(2) traktor - 22.7kb

Once you have traktor installed ( the demo version 1.2.3 ) which could be obtained from my last torrent : 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5245806
 or you can go directly to native instruments site and download it  

All you need to do is copy these two files and replace those in the traktor folder in the $windir% e.g : C:Program FilesNative InstrumentsTraktor ( you will be prompted to replace one of them )

And your all done ! 



I tested it with the files from my latop onto my desktop it works with no problem.

L-town to the world ppl 

ENjoy ...
