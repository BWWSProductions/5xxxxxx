PopCap Plants vs Zombies - v1.0.0.1051



An all-new action-strategy game from PopCap, makers of Bejeweled and
Peggle!

Zombies are invading your home, and the only defense is your arsenal of
plants! Armed with an alien nursery-worth of zombie-zapping plants like
peashooters and cherry bombs, you'll need to think fast and plant faster
to stop dozens of types of zombies dead in their tracks. Obstacles like a
setting sun, creeping fog and a swimming pool add to the challenge, and
with five game modes to dig into, the fun never dies!

* Play five game modes: Adventure, Mini-Games, Puzzle, Survival, plus
the stress-free Zen Garden
* Conquer all 50 levels of Adventure mode â€” through day, night, and
fog, in a swimming pool and on the rooftop
* Battle 26 types of zombies including pole-vaulters, snorkelers and
â€œZomboniâ€ drivers
* Earn 49 powerful perennials and collect coins to buy a pet snail,
power-ups and more!
* Open the Almanac to see all the plants and zombies, plus amusing
â€œfactsâ€ and quotes
* Browse Crazy Daveâ€™s shop for special plants and tools to stem any
zombie assault
* Amazing graphics and soundtrack, plus a bonus music video
* Infinite replayability: the game is never the same experience twice!
