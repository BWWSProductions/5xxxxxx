Robert Ryan plays a boxer on a last pitch to make it big. He has four opponents: a wife who wants him to quit, aging, the other boxer, and gangsters out to rig the match. Some nice locker-room dialog and street photography. Also some well-choreographed fighting for the time, although there are certainly more recent examples that are better.


Additional fight-noirs, both with a love-triangle twist, are Ringside and Bad Blonde. I'll try to upload them later.
