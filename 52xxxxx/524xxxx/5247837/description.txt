Your Brain After Chemo is a groundbreaking guide to post-chemo brain, the cognitive impairment that often follows chemotherapy.

CHEMO AFTER EFFECTS Chemotherapy saves lives, but new studiesâ€”including research led by coauthor Dr. Dan Silvermanâ€”reveal that the agents used to kill cancer cells may also impair normal brain function. Even years after treatment, patients report problems with:

â€¢	Memory, concentration, attention
â€¢	Word retrieval 
â€¢	Multitasking, affecting competence at home and at work
â€¢	Spatial orientation (poor sense of direction)
â€¢	Following the thread of conversations and fear others will notice
â€¢	Compounding depression or fatigue

â€œTask completion is where I am most affected cognitively. Itâ€™s as if the follow-through feature has been removed from my brain.â€ â€”J.

YOU'RE NOT ALONE If youâ€™ve undergone chemotherapy, perhaps youâ€™re among those who feel like youâ€™ve lost your edge or that youâ€™re no longer the person you once were. Until recently, oncologists often discounted or trivialized â€œchemo brain.â€ Now, assert Silverman and Idelle Davidson, there is plenty of evidence to the contrary; thankfully, you can rest assured that youâ€™re not alone in feeling this wayâ€”and that you can do something about it.

â€œI would struggle with spelling words I had known forever. I would forget names, places, and conversations.â€ â€”Carol

TAKE CHARGE!

Perhaps most important, it offers much-needed strategies to improve memory and focus, and an invaluable nine-step program to help keep your brain sharp.
