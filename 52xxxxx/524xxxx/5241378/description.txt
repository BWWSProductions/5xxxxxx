Greetings folkz and a happy new year!

Here is my contribution of remixes and reworks of Coldplay's Clocks and should cover nearly (if not all) tracks made with Clocks included.

If you've seen the Cyberpunk Gnostic Educator and ever wondered (like I did) was song was playing during the Bladerunner sequence, I finally got hold of it after a lot of searching and investigation. It is one of the Gabriel & Dresden remixes, 99% sure it's the bootleg version.

I'll be seeding this for a while, but I'll strongly encourage others to do it as well. As always :)

Enjoy!
