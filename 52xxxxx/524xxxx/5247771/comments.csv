Looks fine to me"
,thesubwayconnection0,2010-01-09T20:42Z,Is there a way to turn off the subtitles? The quality is great.
,Onizuka89,2010-01-10T18:11Z,"thesubwayconnection0: no, it most likely isn't normally it isn't possible to remove subtitles within an avi container, you will need to download by some other torrent if you want without subs."
,GenyrusSeedeR,2010-01-11T21:44Z,"thank you for pointing out the embedded subs. I wouldnt have known, otherwise"

,Snobben69,2010-01-18T17:29Z,Hi...How do i do if i wan't Swedish as spoken language ??
,tribeboybena,2010-01-29T16:48Z,"Snobben69:
then you download this torrent.
if you want if without SWESUB, you download another torrent."
,heisiandiishe,2010-03-01T20:31Z,swesub means swedish subtitles... this one is not with swedish as spoken language. If you want that then you will have to go to the movies. Wait a month or two and IÂ´m sure some creative person has upped a swedish version of this movie...
