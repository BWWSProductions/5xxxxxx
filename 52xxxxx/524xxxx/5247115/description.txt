Each track is connected with a similar melodic tone and key to produce the "blue sound". This interweaving of similar elements creates nine sections of a singular track. Each track is distinctive, yet connected - broken up only by tempo and perception. It's a soft, beautiful, and dizzy array of haunting tunes and charming sounds. Catchy melodies and thought provoking themes ... this is Collection:[Blue].
