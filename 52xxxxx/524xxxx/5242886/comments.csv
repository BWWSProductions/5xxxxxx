,67GTA,2010-01-05T17:03Z,Is it safe to run Windows update after activation?
,digerpaji,2010-01-07T18:41Z,"Yeah is safe to run update after activation...works like a charm and you get ALL the updates...

here are clean instructions for you pussies out there:

1) Burn the provided iso file onto a DVD-R using nero burning rom or magic ISO.
2) Install Windows 7 using the newly burned DVD-R
3) Make sure the windows creates a system partiion during installation (this will be refered to as the hidden system partition in future steps)
4) after windows is installed follow these steps:

1) start RUN from the start menu
2) type diskmgmt.msc and press enter
3) in the new window tht appears right click on the partition with no letter lable and select ""Change Drive letter and paths""
4) CLICK ADD
5) select the letter of your choice, i selected K
6) Click Ok, and ok again and then close disk management
7) Go to my computer and select and the letter drive K will appear and this will let you access the HIDDEN system partition i described earlier
8) Paste the windows activator (exe) provided with this distrubution in the root of that drive (MAKE SURE UR ANTIVIRUS WAS OFF DURING DOWNLOAD CUZ IT MIGHT HAVE DELETED THE WINDOWS ACTIVATION.EXE)
9) right click it after pasting it in K: drive and select RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR
10) follow the on screen instructions on the dos prompt and it will restart your computer FULLY ACTIVATED :D"

Hmmm did you forget to mention the part where they MUST pay you 10 bux to download it you asshole?"
,Xy-BRiGhT-yX,2010-02-17T04:15Z,So does this work long term? I'm no noob to this stuff but I need it to last a few months without bitching about activation whatnot after 30 days.

,SirCutty,2010-06-22T23:59Z,"Downloaded, ran it just fine, everything worked great. Did a scan for virus' and spyware, found a spyrat amongst other things. Deleted all the infections then did another scan. The spyrat was still there. I figured that it must be apart of having a cracked version of win 7 because the spyrat was in winlogin and the login in the registry. A couple of months pass and someone starts talking to me through pop ups. Ran a virus scan and spyrat was the only one. I was actually able to speak with the hacker through popups and me typying stuff into a google search. then for kicks, he pulls up gay porn sites on my web page. I disconnected my internet, rebooted into safe mode and did another scan. That time, spyrat was gone. I haven't had any more communications or gay porn sites come up. This file is infected and the person who made it can not only go through all your saved info and passwords etc., but can also manipulate your computer remotely."
,44awynV6,2010-11-14T04:16Z,"fyi the en_windows_7_ultimate_x64_dvd_x15-65922.iso file has the CORRECT md5 and sha-1.  That makes it perfect in my book.  Don't worry about the other three file as they change with the times, it's the iso file that's perfect.  Google the iso's md5 and sha-1 and this puppy comes up golden :)  Peace"
