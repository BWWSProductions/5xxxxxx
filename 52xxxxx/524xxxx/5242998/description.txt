In terms of rustic, tights-wearing, elf-loving, flute-heavy, British/Celtic folk-tinged '70s prog-rock, SONGS FROM THE WOOD is the most Tull of all Jethro Tull albums. By 1977 the band had ventured far enough from its heavy blues-rock beginnings ... Full Descriptionto create a completely unique, idiosyncratic sound, filled with European folk mythology, rural imagery and an endearing combination of art-rock and British folk-rock. Elaborate synthesizer fanfares mix with delicate acoustic guitar tapestries, complex arrangements and odd time signatures. SONGS FROM THE WOOD strikes the perfect balance between the proggie ambition of THICK AS A BRICK, the storytelling style of AQUALUNG and the courtly, medieval air of MINSTREL IN THE GALLERY. 

This album, which seemed so soft and lyrical in its original CD incarnation, comes to us with some surprisingly sharp edges in its remastered form -- the 24-bit audio allows us to practically hear the action on Ian Anderson's acoustic guitar and puts Barriemore Barlow's drums in the room with us, suddenly giving the whole album the texture of a live recording. Oddly enough, in the case of this album, the result is a roughening of many of the textures to go with closer presence of all of the instruments -- thus, Songs From the Wood ends up sounding a bit more like the Tull albums around it than it previously did. Of the two bonus tracks, "Beltane" is a harder-rocking song than anything on the original LP, while "Velvet Green" keeps to the pastoral mood of the existing album, with a very pleasant melody. ~ Bruce Eder
