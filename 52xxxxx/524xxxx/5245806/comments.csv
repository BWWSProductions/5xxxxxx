,bamboobooty,2010-01-24T16:16Z,"Honestly could not get this to work. installed exactly as instructed, but firstly it said dsound.dll missing and would instantly crash. so i uninstalled and reinstalled then after copying the files the the specified directory & trying to utilize the patch it would instantly say: Patch failed. I'm not hating but i see this as an epic fail, it wasted my time and i also had to listen to some ridiculous music when i opened the patch."
