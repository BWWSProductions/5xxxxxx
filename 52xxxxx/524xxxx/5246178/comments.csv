[T],liluser,2010-01-11T21:56Z,look it up on google....
,keerl,2010-01-15T00:30Z,for the people who don't know what this is 'it's a game'... guess it works but you could give in the future a little bit more information. it's an exe file but it's set to local settings/temp when you doubleclick it. try to mount it tommorow on my other pc with power iso because the output is a bin file...
,Zendra,2011-01-08T17:17Z,"I just renamed .exe into .rar :) and then i extracted it, then you get cue file which you mount with daemon tools and install it. But i dont get it how is this a directX 10 version, because it's the only reason i've downloaded it, in folder of the there is only D3DX9_38.dll ??"
