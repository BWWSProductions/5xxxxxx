,hansen_bg,2009-12-28T11:16Z,"Hello! I Uploaded this here, because I saw there was no original version of it and the first place I tried to find Hiren's 10.1 was TPB as will many others do. (there are 140 leechers on my torrent client at the moment and the torrent is still publushed only here)
I'm triying the best I can to seed, but obviously I will not be able to do it with some kind of a high speed (don't know where the reason is).
Let He Who hath understanding reckon the... ops, who had downloaded Hiren 10.1 (for it is a human number, but it's not 666) seed It Here... Thanks... Bow... Greetings... Honour... Respect... :)))"
