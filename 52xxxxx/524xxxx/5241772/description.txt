.The.Biography.Channel.Sarah.Jessica.Parker.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM

She grew up on Broadway (playing the lead role in Annie at age 
12) and was a familiar face in the '80s (Footloose and Girls 
Just Wanna Have Fun), but it wasn't until Sarah Jessica Parker 
was in her '30s that she became the cultural icon that she is 
today. Her Biography explores how the funny-faced girl from Ohio 
became a producer, a fashion industry muse, and a recipient of 
multiple Golden Globe Awards, Emmys, and SAG Awards... and how 
she picked up Robert Downey Jr., JFK Jr., and Matthew Broderick 
along the way.
