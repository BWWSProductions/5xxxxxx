This is a truly lovely song best done by the Mormon Choirs's beautiful voices
of Christianly beauty.

We bought the karaoke mp3s from the Apple store on-line for just a dollar each (Stingray Productions) and got these great tunes at 192k with and without vocals, so both versions are included for you here, in what are home-made DivX Karaoke productions for you.

No serious takers on the 7.17GB DivX folder as everyone seems happy enough to go for the 5.58GB with separate update folders which provide the same music content. Ok we can accept that, weve put the 7.17GB up at our site as a download instead in four separate folders for those that change their minds and do want this option after all. Als many movies will appear there as single file-download too that are "out of print"


Happy new year 2009!
