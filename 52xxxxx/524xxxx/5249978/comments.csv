I like ZEKTORM's H264 rips better. This one is way more pixelated then the H264 rips he has done.
(for example Terminator.Salvation.2009.DVDRIP.H264-ZEKTORM was much better then this and was also 701 MiB)

Anyway thanks ZEKTORM keep ĂŠm comming!

Rating for this ""Xvid DVDRip"" A/V 8/7.5"
,Rajeev334,2010-01-03T06:16Z,Thanks Zektorm.. But your H264 / Mp4 format was better....
