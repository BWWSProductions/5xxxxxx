,dlarrym,2009-12-29T21:11Z,"@slimtone71, NO, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A GAME????? It is a newer ""Junky"" type movie.... you know what I mean like the most famous is: DRUGSTORE COWBOY w/Matt Dillon or TRAIN SPOTTING, with Ewan McGregor, another example of this type of film is: THE BASKETBALL DARIES w/Leonardo DiCaprio. The thing about this movie, is it shows Heroin use in a way that completely shows how UN- GLORIFIED being addicted is, where DRUGSTORE COWBOY, although at its core, was an ""ANTI-Drug use"" movie, it came off to many People as GLORIFYING drug use. After you see this movie, Even if you are addicted NOW as you watch it, At the end, you'll want to flush your stash down the toilet!!! The characters in this flick really end up in a BAD BAD BAD as hell situation... It in NO WAY makes heroin use seem cool. LASTLY, also to slimtone71: The plots of films posted here HOPEFULLY will never have comments that reveal the PLOT and spoil the movie... Why watch it if some comment box you read spoils the ending for you... so You may as well just be pissed about not having the plot revealed in a comment box. Even my comment tells you little of the plot. I compared it to some other flicks so you could get an idea of the ""jist"" of it, but in the future, ALL people that UPLOAD a MOVIE are supposed to include in there description the IMDB movie id# so you can look that up on your own. You may not care if you know the story of a movie before you see it. MOST people DO NOT want to know, it spoils the movie.... so if you had looked carefully below, you would have seen this URL.....:  So, copy this address and goto the site called: IMDB (Internet Movie Data Base) and you can learn everything you want to know about any movie."
