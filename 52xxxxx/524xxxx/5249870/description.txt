Faint (demo 2002)

Back, before I said goodbye,
Just as the first day turned to night,
Just as the concrete turned to dust,
And the steel turned into rust,
All I could think was I need a way to dig through the damage,
Couldn't think of a way to get through this,
Now I see you takin advantage,
And I found another reason to do this.

I'm diggin us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.
Let go, it's begun,
Close your eyes, I'm not done,
Breathe a word, and waste your breath,
And keep it up till there's nothing left.

Now, that I said goodbye,
Just as the darkness turned to light,
Just as the next light turns to day,
And the world gets underway,
All I can see is the anticipation,
Waiting to take this out on the wind and the raindrops,
And I waited patiently taking it in,
Ready for the first of the face offs.

I'm diggin us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.
Let go, it's begun,
Close your eyes, I'm not done,
Breathe a word, and waste your breath,
And keep it up till there's nothing left.

I'm diggin us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.

I'm diggin us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.

I'm diggin us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.
Let go, it's begun,
Close your eyes, I'm not done,
Breathe a word, and waste your breath,
And keep it up till there's nothing left.

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Fear (Leave Out All The Rest demo 2006)


Looked in the ocean,
Looked in the sea,
Found her laughing,
Watching for me,
Left the door open,
Left the door wide,
(unintelligible),
Kept it inside.

(Nonsense rapping)
Don't trust if you don't then you're fightin' for what?

Fightin' for a place,
We can call home.
Lookin' for a way,
Not be alone.
I'm fightin' for a place,
We can call home.
Lookin' for a way,
Not to be alone,
Not to be alone.

Duh nuh nuh,
Duh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh,
Nuh nuh nuh nuh nuhuhh.

Duh nuh nuh,
Duh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh,
Nuh nuh nuh nuh nuhuhh.

Duh nuh nuh,
Duh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh,
Nuh nuh nuh nuh nuhuhh.

Duh nuh nuh,
Duh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh,
Nuh nuh nuh nuh nuhuhh.

Duh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuhuhh.

Fightin' for a place,
We can call home.
Lookin' for a way,
Not be alone.
I'm fightin' for a place,
We can call home.
Lookin' for a way,
Not to be alone,
Not to be alone.

Figure.09 (demo 2002)


All these things I could not say,
made me so much more afraid.
Just too scared of what I'd find,
to look behind, to look behind.

All these things I could not say,
made me so much more afraid.
Just too scared of what I'd find,
to look behind, to look behind.

If you go, there's no turning back.
If you go, there's no turning back.
If you go, there's no turning back.
there's no turning back!

No, no, no, no, no, no...
NOOOOO!
NO TURNING BACK!
NOOOOO!
NO TURNING BACK!
NOOOOO!
NO TURNING BACK!
NOOOOO!
NO TURNING BACK!

All these things I could not say,
made me so much more afraid.
Just too scared of what I'd find,
to look behind.

All of these things I could not say,
made me so much more afraid.
Just too scared of what I'd find,
to look behind, CAN'T LOOK BEHIND!

Across The Line


In this desert,
In darkness,
Lying with the gun across his chest.
Pretending,
He's heartless,
As the fire flashes in the sky.
He was fragile,
And frozen,
When the bullet took away his friend.
And now he's somehow,
More broken.

He's pulling his weapon to his side,
Loading it full of his goodbyes,
Holding an enemy across the line.
He's pulling his weapon to his side,
Loading it full of his goodbyes,
Holding an enemy across the line.

Sweating,
And shaking,
Lying with her hands across her chest.
She wakes with,
Her cravings,
As the fire flashes in her eye.
She was fragile,
And frozen,
When the needle took away her friend,
But now she's somehow,
More broken.

She's pulling her weapon to her side,
Loading it full of her goodbyes,
Holding an enemy across the line.
She's pulling her weapon to her side,
Loading it full of her goodbyes,
Holding an enemy across the line.

With every battle he's chosing,
With every fight he's losing,
His enemy's not far behind.
With every promise she's broken,
With every lie she's spoken,
Her enemy's not far behind.

It's your time.
It's your time.
It's your time.
It's - your - TIME!

He's pulling his weapon to his side,
Loading it full of his goodbyes,
Holding an enemy across the line.
He's pulling his weapon to his side,
Loading it full of his goodbyes,
Holding an enemy across the line.

She's pulling her weapon to her side,
Loading it full of her goodbyes,
Holding an enemy across the line.
She's pulling her weapon to her side,
Loading it full of her goodbyes,
Holding an enemy across the line.

With every battle he's chosing,
With every fight he's losing,
His enemy's not far behind.
With every promise she's broken,
With every lie she's spoken,
Her enemy's not far behind.
