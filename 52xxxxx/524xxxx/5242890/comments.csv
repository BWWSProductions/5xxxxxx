,ph33rlus,2009-12-27T06:19Z,"@hunterdad.

the digital glasses are useless outside of the cinema. why on earth would you try and steal them when they're no use to you! they even tell you that the glasses wont work!

sigh"

,joyceboxx,2010-01-06T00:07Z,"Ok, I'm new to this torrent thing & this might be a stupid question, but when u say it's in 3-D, does that mean I need the glasses or no(I'm assuming no, but figured I'd ask anyway)??  Thanks for your help.."
,609team,2010-01-07T23:55Z,"This needs Red/Cyan 3D glasses, right?"
,idmountaingirl,2010-01-09T08:04Z,"yes, this is the red/cyan glasses version. I have the glasses i got from avatar and they do not work with this but i can clearly see the red/cyan outlines. should be nice when i can find a pair of the red/cyan glasses. suggestions on where to find some?"
,kfitz9,2010-01-17T12:36Z,"Hey guys, I suggest to actually buy a 3d dvd in a store, you get two pairs of 3d glasses and can reuse them for whatever 3d movies come out in the near future.
(I havn't tried this yet but I will and am sure it will work)

Also, for the cheapskate, try looking through old picture books and stuff, when i was a kid i got loads of 3d glasses in picture encyclopedias. 

Peace MoFo's"
,laxmanpun,2010-01-25T12:49Z,can any one tell me how to find the 3D glasses to watch this movie!
,shaggy71,2010-01-28T02:26Z,if you go to a comcast office they have them for free at all the desks because they are putting this on pay per view. 
,smick714,2010-02-23T17:20Z,You CAN USE polarized 3d outside of a theatre.... as long as you have a CRT monitor.... This red and green shit is from the 50s... When are they gonna release this in polarized..... If I was to pay for it and got home and opened it up to find analgraph glasses I would go get my money back!!!!!
,decebal2003,2010-02-25T04:38Z,"The polarized glasses aren't suitable for home usage. Gotta use the red and blue glasses.
I paid $1 for the Avatar glasses and we've been told to reuse them every time we go to the cinema, to ""save the environment""."
,floufliss,2010-02-25T19:51Z,"nice copy, ty uploader"
,Doomdude,2010-03-07T19:27Z,"For all of the people with polarized glasses: just get a red and blue sharpie, color the LEFT lens in RED, and the RIGHT lens in BLUE. Worked great for me, but its better to color the outside of the lenses because sharpies smell quite strongly :P"
