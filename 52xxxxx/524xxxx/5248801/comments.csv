,penisstain,2009-12-31T17:58Z,"many people have patched the main dol and the only success is on neogamma or usb loaders,why does this one work?"
,nathankeating,2009-12-31T18:50Z,i really dont no why this works.i must have patched the main.dol different.i have a wii 4.1 cios_rev_14 softmod and this is the only one that has worked in the disc chanel for me.every one i have downloaded crashes in the disc channel so i patched this one myself

,drewkrew,2010-01-26T18:02Z,"I assume this is a version that has had an IOS swap-mod performed to the disc image, thus making it load up in IOS249 etc rather than it's default IOS request that's been causing all the disc-loading issues?"

Brilliant, as i got no-where with the untouched .iso disc images of New Super Mario Bros Wii, so if you have had the same problems, try this. I did - and it plays great for hours without any issues at all. 

Thanks for the torrent. Another great Wii game disc image!
