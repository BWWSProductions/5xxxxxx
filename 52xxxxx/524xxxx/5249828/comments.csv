Here are instructions on how to play APE files in Winamp (thanks for Avg Bear from Winamp forums):

Let me clarify for anyone else seeking an answer:
[assuming you have a new/newer version of winamp]
1. Download Monkey's Audio from the Monkey Audio site.
2. Install it on your PC.
3. Go into Windows Explorer (Program Files) and find the Monkey Audio program.
4. There, you will find the ""Winamp Plugin.exe"" file. Double-click and select the WinAmp Program for installation if it asks.
5. If you have a problem (perhaps you tried to install an earlier version of the Monkey plug-in, for example, which won't work with .ape files that were created recently), delete the monkey files from Winamp. [You'll find them under Windows Explorer (Program Files) in WinAmp, then Plug-ins. (These are .dll files.)
6. You also may need to start Winamp, go to the WinAmp menu, Select Options, go into the preferences, find the ""File Types"" section, and highlight ""APE"". Next time Winamp starts, it should associate itself with APE files.
7. This really is pretty easy - and a lot easier than spending hours googling for answers on how to make your .ape files work with WinAmp, believe me. "
