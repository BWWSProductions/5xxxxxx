,PabloMansini,2010-11-27T13:15Z,"some ignorant fools believe everythoing they read in the papers, the reason MJ did not have that many hits was because he was on to something, listen to ""they dont care about us"" and search youtube for some of what was going on.Arseholes, this guy was musical genius."
,mangoa,2010-12-02T12:37Z,thank you
,2know4sure,2010-12-15T07:01Z,"""Blessed are the Merciful, for yhey shall obtain Mercy."" How about a little Mercy for Michael? 
Or do you want to ""throw the first stone?"" 
His monster Reptilian possessed dad made him the mess that he was by denying him a childhood. Michael had issues, but in his Heart of Hearts he was a good person, at least as good as you...
(I'm white, just so you don't think this is a defensive ""race"" thing.)"
,Proudestmikey,2011-01-07T14:58Z,Thank you seeders!!  MJ is the best!
,malleryknox,2011-02-24T09:54Z,The world lost the best entertainer of our generation. I pray that he finds the peace in death that was stolen from him during his life. RIP
,mariaj6,2011-03-03T02:20Z,"Mr J will live always. RIP. God really needed a GOOD singer!
Love U bubanee!"
,nobbythenobbler,2011-03-07T01:50Z,freaks......If MJ was bald fat and wore glasses he'd be in jail for for kiddy fiddling...... I wouldnt let him near my kids.... and i stopped buying his music as I felt it was funding the lawyers to get him off the said charges..... Its not ok for any grown man to have the sort of contact he had with kids (sleeping with them etc) sorry no smoke without fire in my book I'm afraid. as a kid I was raped by someone just like him (butter wouldnt melt in the mouth) I hope he's in hell and rotting  and as much as I once loved MJ's music I wouldnt piss on it now free or not...
,Cocobrown3001,2011-03-09T13:08Z,"Wow. That coming from ""nobbythenobbler"". I am sorry that you went through that whilst you were growing up, but just because you had issues when you were young, doesn't mean that you have to drag other people's names through the mud. MJ stood for all things great and good, even though we'll never know what he did, I believe he has done more good than any other person in the world, just with his music and dance. You can't deny that. He always stood for righteousness and for the good of humanity. I'm not trying to save his name or anything, because, as i said before, no one will really know what happened. What i am saying is, don't throw mud on a name so great for something that no one will really know the truth about. At least recognise that his music and talent actually helped to make a difference in this bleak and already crumbling humanity we live in.  "
,sha4000,2011-03-16T03:09Z,this download is hottttttttt
,gusdy,2011-03-16T13:21Z,Thanks
,poserposer,2011-04-07T03:27Z,"Maybe instead of focusing on his alleged crimes, people should instead focus on his music. Go back and watch the interviews they did with him where he talks about how he wrote Bill Jean. Sure, he may or may not have done some terrible things, but the man has passed, and so should the bad things associated him. Don't think of him anymore as a suspect in a terrible crime, think of him as a musician, and nothing more. His music is what brought him his fame, and for good reason. Focus more on the music and less on the gossip. If more people would do that, this world would be a better place."
,poserposer,2011-04-07T03:30Z,"Oh yeah, one more thing

Nobbythenobbler, if you hate MJ and his music so much, why bother searching for him on this site? Why bother clicking the link to this page? Why bother posting a comment like that? You sure did go through quite a bit of work for someone who ""wouldn't piss on his music."" Jussayin, you sorta made an ass of yourself. "

,Dr_Smurph,2011-07-07T11:58Z,"Quality was decent, not a bad set of his songs. "
,VladimirLem,2011-07-10T13:12Z,"DECENT torrent at best.

70% of the songs are terrible in quality.

50% of the song titles are wrong.  ""smooth crimanal"" for instance.

If you just want the music, download it.  if you want quality version of the music,  look elsewhere.  

On a good note,  it has some of his really old stuff,  more than whats on his greatest hits compilation album."
,blindwitness_90,2011-08-05T10:45Z,"Thank you @bubanee, and thank you MJ :)"

,Stock3rz,2012-07-08T14:52Z,"here is how to edit the album art (image on cover of song) to work in itunes:

1. download mp3tag

2. run mp3tag then go to file>Add directory

3. in the windows that appear click once on the folder that your song(s) is in and then click ""select folder""

4. Download the album art (search firstt of the year album art on images) then right click the image and click save as to download. Without closing mp3tag of course 

5. then go back to mp3tag and select all the songs you want to add art to then rightclick>Extended Tags

6.click the yellow star icon (if you don't know hover over all the icons, it will be the one that says ""add cover"".

7. select the album art you downloaded then click ok. When the files window closes click okay and wait for it to save the mp3s.

8. close and enjoy!"
