REST IN PEACE
MICHAEL JOSEPH JACKSON [August 29, 1958 â€“ June 25, 2009]

AS Much As The World And It's People Hated Him And Or Loved Him,
MICHAEL JACKSON Was Always There,
Somewhere Playing On The Radio,
In The Clubs,
Thrashing It Out In Your Car Or Just Tappin Away At The Kitchen Sink.
I Remember Michael For The Music
"He IS Our "ELVIS" Of This Generation"
Sad As It Is, He Is, He Was, The Greatest Entertainer
So I Will Remember Michael For His Music, 
THANKYOU.. MICHAEL

1 of the few true best singers/artists the world has ever known...
I gotta say, I didn't listen AT ALL what he did for the last 10 years as it wasn't his best anyway!!
But I always LOVED all his 80's & early 90's repertory was purely AMAZING !!! (...was a true fan at that time ...)!
Think about the next generation and their loss as for most of them, it'll just be plain old music, you know !?
SAAAD ! His talent will be greatly missed...

Adeus ou at? sempre Michael,
Foste pioneiro na tua arte, dan?avas como ningu?m e tinha uma voz e uma presen?a fant?stica. Quantos de nos tentamos imitar te com aqueles passos geniais que fazias. Cresci com a tua m?sica e sinto me como se tivesse perdido um familiar, estranho acho que ? a primeira vez que isto me acontece com algu?m que n?o conhecia pessoalmente.
Continuarei com certeza a ouvir as tuas m?sicas com muita saudade.

I love music very much. I love Michael Jackson's music. Most of his songs were huge hits when I was growing up in the 70s and 80s. We danced and sang to these songs during our home, school and club parties. As a FM radio disc-jockey for over 20 years, I played his songs countless times...perhaps a million times. May his soul be blessed and rest in peace.

It hurts knowing that I used to play his albums and even watched the movie.
Who can die next and have an affect like this? No one can. News may fly around the world but Michael Jackson is truly #1.
He has his own clothing, his own voice, his own style, no one can be him, when his on the radio even if u didnt hear a song from him, you'd know who was singing, You just know wo it was without thinking.

CANT GET THIS SONG OUT OF MY HEAD :'(
One day in your life
Youll remember a place
Someone touching your face
Youll come back and youll look around, youll . . .

One day in your life
Youll remember the love you found here
Youll remember me somehow
Though you dont need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
Youll remember one day . . .

One day in your life
When you find that youre always waiting
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and Ill be there

Youll remember me somehow
Though you dont need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
Youll remember one day . . .

One day in your life
When you find that youre always lonely
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and Ill be there

Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by...

If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just...

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just...

Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by...

If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile...

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

As a child i found music boring. but i remember Bad being played on the radio when i was 6 years old and that was it, i was a Michael Jackson fan. all the songs are great. the dancing is out of this world and the imagination in his music videos is outstanding. there truely will never be anyone who will compare to MJ. R.I.P Michael and damn all your accusers!

66.Posted by khaledkh on Jun 27 2009 at 19:26
Michael Jackson left us alone
It is very sad news for me, Michael was great artist. only few can sing, dance & create music like him
for all beuatiful songs & joy he provided to the world I will say bye MJ & you deserve to be in heaven

Lamento muito por isso. Espero que Deus te d? o conforto, a miseric?rdia e a Paz que s? Ele pode dar. Que Deus te receba de bra?os abertos no c?u. Agrade?o, tamb?m, a Deus por eu ser um contempor?neo de sua exist?ncia.
Rest In peace.

The songs in this torrent are working perfectly.
Have anyone ever seen the Movie? i saw this in the 90s at such a young age its even available for Download called "MoonWalker" Speed demon song is nice and the Smooth Criminal part as well. See this man had acting, story telligng and dancing in his creations...THE BEST.
The guy wearing the white in the BEAT IT video looks so bad ass lol.
I think he was the choreographer. Well he did stand out beside Micheal Jackson since in was in all WHITE lol

Michael was the best. He is the other reason why I still live. If it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I would not help any other people.
This selection is excellent but you forgot to put the song "one day in your life." <-- that song really touch my heart... very depressing but its a good way to remember old days (especially if you were depressed. sudden break up with your girlfriend.)



Thankyou Everyone, Cheers Bubanee
