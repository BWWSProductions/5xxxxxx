Most of the MMORPG genre of games immediately put you in the game world, where you have to immediately interact with other characters and unique game mechanics which we all, fans of online multiplayer games like - and hate at the same time. This experience can be quite daunting, especially for those accustomed to the solo game, because here no one can take the handle and did not acquaint with the world. Moreover, the plot in Age of Conan will develop very differently than in traditional games.

Moreover, all players will be constantly connected to our servers and will be able to communicate freely with their colleagues in the game.

Its author did not re-rocking character from scratch, deciding to ""visit"" their old heroes, among whom were both ""eighties"" and the characters are secondary levels.

Final impressions were surprisingly positive - the journalist said engine optimization, bug fixes and a substantial majority of new content as well as finalized the old. As a result, by happy has circulated a Guardian-a from 37 th to 80 th level, and concluded that the AoC deserves a second chance for former subscribers, not to mention attention, still unreached audience. And this even without re-role-playing system, which should further improve the impression of the game, giving new impetus to the pursuit of mining equipment.
