when it debuted in 2004.  Rides travels across the country documenting hot rod
enthusiasts as they build the ultimate racing machines. Rides features some of
the biggest names in the custom car world, such as Chip Foose, Troy Trepanier,
Kevin King, and Mike Lavallee.  Watch the entire process as broken-down and
ordinary automobiles are transformed into totally tricked-out Rides.
