,TheColdTruth,2010-03-21T05:21Z,"Tried downloading this torrent because the new version is a buggy piece of shit, but there's no seeds (says there is but I don't get any download rate at all).  

Anyways, this version works really good, but you can also download it on sourceforge since the seeds on this torrent suck.

Here's the link:
