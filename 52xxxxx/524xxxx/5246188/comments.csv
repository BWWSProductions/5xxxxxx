,ras_yo,2009-12-28T14:17Z,Who cares if it works. Nobody is seeding ... :o(
,alltemplates,2009-12-28T15:18Z,"I'm seeding, be patient... "

"
,alltemplates,2009-12-29T01:13Z,Thanks ras_yo for your support...
,elelamb,2009-12-29T10:10Z,"Could someone tell me how it works. I've got all of the codecs unzipped in their original folder but I'm not sure where to put them or what to do with them. Never done codecs before. Thanks in Advance, Elliot"
,tjosan62,2009-12-30T14:39Z,All I need is Perian and VLC. I doubt the average user needs all these 130 codecs anyway...
,erroneus,2009-12-30T16:41Z,VLC is no longer updated for Mac OS X unless someone else decides to pick up the ball.
,ScifiterX,2009-12-30T18:49Z,"Actually 64-bit and independent PPC development is halted the former due to not enough developers. and the later due to obsolescence. There are rumors that if that the lack of developers,especially interface developers continue there wont be a version 1.1.0 of it for Mac. Version 1.0.x 32-bit for Mac Intel & Universal Binary versions is supposed to continue being developed unless things worsen."
,misanthropic_pony,2009-12-31T20:07Z,"To install:
1. Unzip the file ""130_QuickTime_codecs.zip""
2. Open the resulting folder ""130_QuickTime_codecs""
3. Open the folder ""QuickTime""
4. Copy the contents of this folder to /Library/QuickTime"
