DVDRip of the two part BBC episodes of Sherlock Holmes in 1968. These were both in Season 2, episodes 4 and 5. These are only two of six, I believe, episodes that survived. Once I have enough seeders, I'll upload the others. Cushing played Holmes in this same title in 1959, but this is for the TV series. He also played Holmes in Masks of Death in 1984.

This is a DVDRip, but remember that there were no DVDs then so it was put on DVD from film so the quality won't be the same as a true digital DVD. But then you guys know that.
