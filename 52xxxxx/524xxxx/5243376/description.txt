       Backstage gossip from Larry Lamb's last day on EastEnders, as he     
       as he filmed the scenes in which the twisted Archie Mitchell finally   
       faced the consequences of his actions. Interviews with the actor and    
       fellow cast members examine how the character caused such misery  
       on Albert Square in the months before his demise on Christmas Day.
