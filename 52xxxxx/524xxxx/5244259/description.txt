A collection of 17 different and unique poems written by someone called Daniel.

Oh yeh, thats me....

Well, thought I'd share them, and where best than here.


Example...


---Restrained---

Sheâ€™s tied and bound to the bed,
Her arms and legs restrained,
Mouth taped shut, she cannot scream,
Sheâ€™s suffering such pain.

She struggles to break free,
From the restraints that tie her tight,
Her hopes are low, she canâ€™t get free,
No matter how she fights.

The rope begins to burn her wrists,
The pain begins to grow,
Sheâ€™s giving up the fight,
As the fear starts to show.

Blood is flowing from her neck,
As he pulls away the knife,
How could someone do this,
To his one and only wife?
