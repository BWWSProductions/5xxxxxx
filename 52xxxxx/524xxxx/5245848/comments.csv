,coleix,2010-01-20T22:09Z,lol man i cant believe 50 people are seeding this crap
,MKScorpionbl,2010-01-27T06:57Z,"Ok guys.Try this
Use 7-zip context menu feature = extract on ps3emu.exe 
It's strange, but it is extracting and guess what inside there? - plugins for pcsx2
Sounds like a REAL fake."
,Yixi,2010-02-20T22:18Z,"Lol there is a lot of emails and datas from ""University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit"" inside O_o"
,TLH11,2010-03-30T23:46Z,"It doesent work for mi , it says that i dont got a file :/

,TheGoodVarns,2010-04-30T16:00Z,No PS3 Emu for a long ass time. This shit is fake as hell! Dont even download. research your shit before you download it! Stick to the retro emulation! Wanna play ps2? Buy swap disk and play burnt games.

,aphexes,2011-03-05T02:11Z,It's a pile of shit and is fake.
,Fighter7777,2011-03-14T02:28Z,"hi after searching on web, it's just a fake ... delete data folder and launch ... no problem, it's always the same message ..."
,Kazadur,2011-03-21T01:18Z,"smells fake 2 me :S... always the same message, tried everything... still with missing MSCOMCTL.OCX... i've downloaded... still... so... don't download it... fake"
,Hades85,2011-05-03T21:28Z,this is very useful to gamers like me that love having everything on my computer so I dont have to buy any new systems.but I still contribute to the companies by buying their games and purchasing other items.
,Hades85,2011-05-03T21:30Z,oh almost forgot this will not work at all with any of your ps3 discs without having at least a blue-ray rom in your computer.I have tried it with dvd rom and burner and it doesnt read the ps3 discs.I found a vid on it that says u must have a blue ray player in your computer to play discs.so I have been looking for a cheap one so I can get full use out of this emu.
,Hades85,2011-05-03T21:52Z,I retract all my previous statements.this is completely fake.once I downloaded it I took a good look into it I first deleted the shirtcut and deleted the data folder that comes with it.when I ran the ps3emu.exe file after deleting everything else guess what it still ran lol.I then broke down the exe to find that it is nothing more then some loader from something that wont load cause files are mising so it stops where it says and has been edited to look like its loading ps3 bios files.and the thing loading at the top that u see is nothin more then a small mp4 video file of a ps3 loading up and getting that error.
,SuppositeWar,2011-05-19T18:26Z,"Bonjour,
J'ai téléchargé ce torrent et il marche très bien sous Windows Vista X32 mais par contre sous W7 x64 le fichier MSCOMCTL.OCX manque... donc ce n'est ni un fake ni un virus"
,dilinwe,2011-09-04T05:32Z,"there is 120 people that still believe in santa clauss
how it posible to emu the ps3, we dont have to many people with iqs over 200, and if the ps3 is emulated in a close future, will be a commercial emu."
,thesuperstar,2011-09-05T14:18Z,"i download this
but  how does it works
i setup it
but what next 
please help me"
,DarkWeetus,2011-09-24T09:11Z,"@rawasmhd Why write in capitals like a tard. Nothing you said is credible because it looks like you were having a seizure while you typed. You are a waste of bandwidth, douche."
,10yaseen,2011-10-24T09:45Z,"after you have downloaded this emulator 
than you must download a ps3 game. after that download deamon tools lite and mount the image with deamon tools. than select a drive in which you have mounted it. at last press init boot disc and it will run fine. Thanks"
,Ljusa,2012-01-05T14:57Z,"Ha ha ha. Even emulator exist, with this config you will have 1-2 fps. Very funny. It is imposible to make ps3 emulator, because fictive recommended system requirements are six core 32 ghz cpu, ati radeon 7950 3gb ddr5, 8 gb ram ddr3. As you see pc need teen time powerfull processor then ps3 cell broadband 3,2 ghz x10 32 ghz is reccommended. Conclusion: ps3 emulator will be aviable maybe for 10 years or later."
,apu20,2012-01-14T08:58Z,haha I remember when people doubted ps2 emulators said it was not going to come around for 10-15 years. Guess what? In 2005(Granted with a really good PC) one was up and going.
,vikt555(2),2012-02-26T13:40Z,"i download it and there is ps3 startup screen and it says. The system software cant be run correctly.
Press the PS button to try to restart the system."
,EXILEDEXISTANCE,2012-03-26T15:11Z,Ive ran all the test i can on this and ive found a way to make it work (not very well) but it works 1st you need a hard drive thats come out of a ps3 hook it to your computer install the ps3emu on it and it shouldnt give you any problems except a ton of lag.
,aryanpunk,2012-04-18T18:13Z,some file is missing
,mojko8,2012-05-15T16:09Z,I downloaded and install it and it DELETED MY WINDOWS!!!
,Anewidea3,2012-05-29T00:09Z,@mojko8 If it deleted your windows how were you able to comment on this? :D
,Anewidea3,2012-05-29T05:32Z,"WTF I extracted this and there is a bunch of emails, PDF files, text documents, and a mp3 file. DAFAQ is this shit?"
,PlagueMachine,2012-05-30T04:48Z,@Ljusa Go be stupid somewhere else.

,matija97,2012-07-16T07:57Z,"I downloaded emu... Then I downloaded Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 and converted it to ISO file. Then I mounted it and started emu and selected the drive, but it shows the message ''The system can't be run correctly...'' Any ideas how to solve this?"
