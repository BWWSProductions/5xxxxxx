Here's a PS3 emulator I found on P2P.
It seems to be the real deal but so far I haven't gotten any games to run with it (maybe I need a Blu-Ray player?).  Scans virus-free.  If anyone knows more about this please comment!

Update:
It's definetely real.  There's video demos on- just search for 'ps3emu'.
