Airdate 12/28/09

Julie is living a nightmare. A series of tragedies triggered massive hoarding which in turn led to Julie's son moving in with her ex-husband. Now she must clean up or risk losing the two daughters that still live with her. Shannon, her husband Tim, and their four young children live in a house that is filled with garbage and infested with mice. Her dogs roam freely in the clutter and there's a two foot hole in the bathroom floor. She was devastated when Animal Control removed 20 cats from the home three weeks ago. Now, as cameras are rolling, police arrive at the front door with Child Protective Services to remove her children.
