,gearofwar,2010-01-07T02:49Z,"... And I thought I'd have you beat on the G's, thought I'd have them all. But no, you find me Goliath, Gomorrha, that excellent psychedelic album from Grails, and some Guapo albums I never knew existed... Even the most avid proghead can be surprised by you!
This is not a torrent. It's a way of life.

P.S. Thanks for only uploading the good Grobschnitt albums!"
