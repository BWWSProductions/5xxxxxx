Amazon.com Review By Amy Linden - Most of the free world now knows that Babyface writes the songs the whole world sings, but many may not be aware that he also sings them as well. This "unplugged" performance, which is decidedly anything but, gives a high five to Babyafce's often overlooked vocal skills and triumphantly allows him to reclaim some of the hits he gave to others. It's cool to hear 'face and his stellar group (along with guests Eric Clapton, Milestone and Shanice Wilson) rework "Breathe Again" or "Take a Bow." And the duet with Stevie Wonder, "How Come How Long," may be high drama, but like the rest of this CD, it warms the soul.
