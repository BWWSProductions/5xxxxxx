IMAGE UNITED #2 (of 6)

Written by Robert Kirkman, art and covers by Erik Larsen, Rob Liefeld, Todd McFarlane, Whilce Portacio, Marc Silvestri and Jim Valentino.

The greatest threat the Image Universe has ever faced makes his first move toward world domination! You can't miss this historic event as the original Image Founders draw all the characters they made history with. Each page is an amazing jam piece -- it's a story told in a way never before attempted in comics. 

Also includes Bloodstrike backup story.
