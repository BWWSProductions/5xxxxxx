[T],eyezin,2010-01-07T10:28Z,"Once had a problem with it crashing. I uninstalled it defraged the drive, reinstalled and defraged again and it never crashed after that.  "
,mitchmny,2010-01-17T18:52Z,"Hey, it downloaded fine and everything. I installed it. I tried to switch the file it says in step two of your instructions, but I couldn't do it. Either that or I dont know how. Any help? Also, when I tried to open Medieval_TW.EXE it says bugslayerUtil.dll could not be found."
,Padofski,2010-01-21T12:45Z,"I mounted the file, and setup was launched. However, it said a previous version of M:TW was detected. I tried to uninstall it, but an error came up saying that 'install.dll could not be found'. I don't know what else to do--any assitance would be appreciated."

,Eestikas,2010-04-16T16:52Z,This torrent SUCKS and there`s no instructions to install it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
,ghostlyshadow,2010-06-04T23:58Z,this version and shogun total war i believe just really have a problem with vista. get the Shog_CPP error and game closes so good luck anyone with vista 
,Halfdan87,2010-06-16T07:11Z,In my case this game won't run if I've got XP Codeck Pack installed. Dont know why...
,Halfdan87,2010-06-16T07:27Z,"Hmmm. If someone else have that problem with game crashing at the very begining couse of XP Codec Pack (or rather ffdshow) you should go to FFDShow Video Decoder Configuration->DirectShow control:
Check: ""Don't use ffdshow in:"", add this to the end of line:

Medieval_TW.EXE;

Who knows, maybe it'll fix other problems too... 
You can also install Unofficial 2.01 patch. This fixes ""All kings die at age of 56"" problem."
,psyfer34,2010-07-24T11:25Z,"Crashes.... Won't let me play single player battles or tutorials. Battles just freeze and the mouse repeats itself all over the screen. Tutorials just crash. 

Downloaded really fast though."
,Tam-Linn,2010-08-18T09:13Z,"keeps telling me ""data3.cab is missing"" and to ""insert disc 0"" when i try to install. anythoughts? if anyone has data3.cab in the folder when they mount the .iso let me know, i might just need to redownload it."
,Mirathei,2010-09-16T17:52Z,Hey it downloaded fine but I can't find the .iso to mount on the virtual disc. Where do I find it?
,Maggan123,2010-11-05T19:33Z,is this the full game too?
,Birthdaycakez,2010-11-07T02:35Z,"I honestly can't find the ""Crack"" or the .ISO file. I really need help."
,Salgran,2010-11-09T23:02Z,"yo eyezin, cheers for the upload and all, but u mind explaining what you meen by....

,RTWknight,2010-11-26T04:15Z,Thanx am downloading now
,RTWknight,2010-11-26T04:16Z,Downloading now thanks
,anun,2010-11-26T23:59Z,"PROBABLE SOLUTIONS FOR BOTH ISSUES. 
The first time I installed the game I had the same bugslayerUtil.dll could not be found, message. I opened the application straight from the folder where it is located and it seemed to work but it had the crashing issue. I believe this is because I made a new shortcut after replacing the Medieval_tw.exe, to fix it, don't make a second shortcut, doing this seemed to fix both issues becathe campaign hasn't crashed  after that.
Thanks for the upload and i hope this helps some folk.  "
,anun,2010-11-27T01:14Z,"if it does crash a second time, try opening the game again, it crashed for me once again, so just try and it should work, i know it might be annoying but at least it's playable"
,leviathanzr6,2010-12-26T16:23Z,"It keeps crashing!

""Medieval_TW.EXE""

anyone know how to fix this?"
,elitenoble,2011-02-12T19:40Z,@Salgran you need togo to the place where you installed medieval and drag the app to there it will ask to copy and remplace click yes
,elitenoble,2011-02-12T19:42Z,@Mirathei goto users then downloads it should be there
,elitenoble,2011-02-12T19:44Z,"@kcross12 the folder u downloaded includes an app  copy this to the install folder , it will ask copy and replace click on yes , it should work then."
,spelertje7,2011-04-29T19:25Z,I have mounted the iso file and installed the game and replaced the exe. file but is says put in cd
,spelertje7,2011-04-29T19:43Z,srr it was the correct cd
,Dragonmansd,2011-05-03T00:55Z,"Help! I first tried to use the .exe file included in the folder to start the game - didn't work. Then I went back and replaced it with the one provided. It displays the same error message as before, and the only way I can tell that I actually changed them is that the file size changes. Someone please help fix this problem!"
,DisOrder08,2011-05-27T23:07Z,"First off, thanx much to eyezin for the share!
ok, i'm a self taught noob and this doesn't seem like rocket science here, but it's pretty much self explanatory.
Replace the .exe file and click on the NEW overwritten .exe file to play.
DON'T use the shortcut on desktop.
after install, it didn't even ask me for the key code.
I installed this after Rome:total war, so seeing these primitive graphics just made me decide to delete it after 5 minutes"
,deldr3,2011-06-16T03:23Z,Been looking for a copy of this one for ages. Thanks and nice dl speed of just over 400 k/b
,bff1234,2011-08-15T12:30Z,"thanx for the upload!
I hope this will work! XD"
,CnC-FTW,2011-09-10T08:18Z,"I might have a solution. Please read.

I am running on Vista (service pack 2)

After installing I changed the original Medieval_TW.exe with the crack as you are supposed to. 

Then I checked the [Run this program in compatibility mode for:] box and selected Windows 98 / ME (and also checked Run as Administrator)

I really hope this works for you guys.  I Alt+Tabbed out of the game just to post this for you! Good luck.    =)"
,CnC-FTW,2011-09-10T08:24Z,"EDIT: Step-by-step instructions...

Right click on the cracked Medieval_TW.exe select the bottom: Properties, select the second tab: Compatibility, Check in the Compatibility Mode box: Run this program in compatibility mode for, select Windows 98 / ME, check in the Privilege Level box: Run this program as an administrator, select Apply

Good luck, again! :D"
,CnC-FTW,2011-09-10T09:10Z,Edit Again: ok so it worked for about an hour then it had the usual crash... I don't know man I was having a lot of fun too...
,ewathedank420,2011-09-28T08:34Z,if its crashing its porbably your pc adjust your resolution and graphics accordingly
,gingerjesus,2011-12-09T21:03Z,C:\Source\VikingsPatch\Crusaders_TW\main3d_1.cpp(2713) : DirectX call : E_NOTIMPL (UNSUPPORTED) this is the error i get i think it is one that doesnt have a fix in the comments any help would be greatly appreciated
,cizcorez,2011-12-22T18:23Z,It works fine on my laptop (windows 7) i dont see the problem.
,edwardsb704,2012-02-07T04:51Z,"Dlding, hope it will work will seed :) 
Cheers!!! great upload eyezin. Kudos to you man :D :D (clap) (clap)"
,obyrne,2012-03-10T14:29Z,this torrent is absolutely useless. The fact the the uploader has given some half-arsed rubbish way to try and fix the fact that it crashes whenever you try to play. I'd advise people not to download it
,S1lencer,2012-03-12T16:51Z,"ok, im about to try and play it. ill write if it works. btw i saw someone complaining about how there's no installation guide... umm.... what guide do you need? you mount damn .iso file, install the game and get it cracked by putting cracked .exe into game folder. JOB'S DONE."
,S1lencer,2012-03-12T19:06Z,"k guys it works on my win7 and the crashing problem can be ""kind of evaded""... by saying kind of i dont mean that it works 100%. here's what i did: on installation i unchecked the thing that creates desktop shortcut. never use a shortcut for this game (even after cracking), it might cause crashing. after cracking i set the game to run on windows 98 / ME (right click the .exe, properties, compability and do it there) AND i also set it to run on administrator. When in game i set resolution to max because 800x600 looks shitty enough of a big screen. I dont know if it helps or not but try everything i did and who knows, it might work. Oh and by the way it still crashes for me SOMETIMES. it doesnt crash in middle of the campaign so dont worry about that, if it crashes the first time, try again. my first lucky shot was the third try and then i conquered eastern part of europe :P"
,sp2012m,2012-04-15T09:53Z,IT WONT STOP CRASHING!!!
,Vaisya,2012-04-24T06:52Z,"i am a mac user, lets try"
,pete6181,2012-06-19T20:42Z,The biggest issue I know of for this game is that it is not compatible with new Nvidia video cards.  The new Radeons play it fine.  In a previous build I was using two 8800 GTS and always crashed.  Running a HD 5800 Radeon now and it runs fine.
