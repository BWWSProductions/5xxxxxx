,chungwa,2010-01-19T10:26Z,"This 50-minute video has US photographer Joe McNally show us how to use small Nikon flashes with a number of increasingly silly (and overpriced) gadgets. Personally I would ignore most of these and use an umbrella - especially as Joe's results aren't very encouraging. No essential information here like subject-to-background or subject-to-light distance, or much on light placement really. 
But if you were subscribed to Kelby.com you'd get to watch stuff like this as much as you like for $24 a month, so I think it's value for money. "
