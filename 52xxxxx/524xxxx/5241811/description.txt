Filipino action cinema king Romano Kristoff returns as another hardboiled cop in DOUBLE EDGE. Even from the very first moments you can tell this is a shameless COBRA rip-off with Kristoff stealing the famous "You have the right to remain silent" line and then blowing up a gas station to kill a bunch of drug-crazed, robbing, raping, murderous scumbags! Besides desperately trying to be the new Marion Cobretti, he is also a ninja, using brutal methods to fight crime. An absolute essential for every self-respected trash cinema fan, DOUBLE EDGE is an obscure classic from the golden era of Filipino action! Do not miss our gorgeous-looking, fully uncut Japanese import which includes all the over the top violence!
