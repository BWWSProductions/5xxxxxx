Press Release
Store Wars is the latest outreach effort of OTA to educate consumers about the many benefits of organic products. By spoofing a pop culture phenomenon like Star Wars, OTA hopes to attract a new generation of organic consumers, especially â€œGen Xersâ€ who grew up loving Luke, Leia and Han, and are now increasingly concerned about making healthy food choices for their families.
