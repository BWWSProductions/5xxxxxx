Release Notes:

The Kyuss family tree has grown exponentially since disbanding in 1995. And
though Josh Homme continues to be the highest profile ex-member of the seminal
desert rock group, the best Kyuss-related release of 2009 not only has nothing
to do with that crooked vulture, but doesnâ€™t even include anyone who was
actually a member of the band! House of Broken Promises formed out of the ashes
of John Garciaâ€™s Unida, with Eddie Plascencia doing double duty on bass and lead
vocals. The eleven tracks on Using The Useless are sensational, sleazy, and
familiar. Sure, House of Broken Promises arenâ€™t doing anything all that
innovative, but theyâ€™re doing it a hell of a lot better than Nickelback or
Daughtry or just about any other purported â€œhard rockâ€ band out there right now.
â€œBlisterâ€ is on par with anything off Downâ€™s last album, while â€œHighway Gritâ€
might as well be the unofficial theme song for Sons Of Anarchy. The chorus on
â€œTornâ€ is so damn catchy and anthemic that it almost seems unfair that youâ€™re
unlikely to ever hear it on the radio. Hereâ€™s hoping the band tours in 2010 and
raises their profile a bit more. Using The Useless is a fucking diamond in the
rough.
