Biography
Canadian guitar player/producer Greg Joy was born in Victoria. His love for the folk music of the British Isles led him to the Victoria Music Conservatory in the late '70s to study classical guitar. He has performed with a myriad of both Celtic and worldbeat groups, and has released numerous collections of Christmas and Celtic music of his own. ~ James Christopher Monger, All Music Guide

UPLOADERâ€™S NOTE â€“ A poster to the comments on my various Celtic music uploads brought this torrent to my attention (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5193917/Celtic_guitar), but the entire thing was titled in Russian, had no information, and had no seeders. This is the same torrent, but I have fixed the tags, and hopefully will get more seeds.
