  To Delete the files, open your BitTorrent client and right-click on the Torrent. Choose 'Delete'  > 'Delete .Torrent + Files'.

[T],Games4theworld,2010-02-01T17:51Z,"Hi,


@Sublime420

The lagg may be caused by your Graphic Card. Do you have an old PC? Try to play on lowest details. In the beginning it's very hard on Multiplayer mode, since the people your are fighting to, are far more experienced than you. Just play for a while and you'll find it easier to make a kill.

Anyway, can people please take the upload limiters off their torrents? I'm currently getting about 15kb/s download speed and over 55kb/s upload with no limits on either. Obviously people are trying to be selfish, but we'll all download it a shitload faster if we take off the upload limiters. Download speed is negligibly affected anyway, so just fucking do it."

  @triqvinden

This problem is completely new to us and it's not caused by the Torrent, since you're the first one with this problem. Please check if you're PC can run the Game on: http://cyri.systemrequirementslab.com/srtest/


@Stavrose

Some other people seem to have this problem too. We don't know how to fix this problem at the moment. The only thing I can recommend is to just play the Game like it is or Install it on an other PC. The Campaign is the middle option, co-operate is the left and Multiplayer is the right option from the Main menu. 
Note: You can ONLY go Online if you've Installed the Multiplayer Crack, which can be Downloaded from here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5317858


@xandyxsk8x

Open the '# Crack' file in the .rar file you Downloaded and Drag & Drop the 'iw4mp.exe' ánd the 'iw4sp.exe' to: C:\Program Files\Activision\Modern Warfare 2    You'll get a pop-up saying that the file you're trying to copy already exist. Click 'Replace'. The Game should work now.


@EpicFishFingers

Please read the previous Comment before Commenting. The person had an error saying: 'steam_api.dlll is missing'. When you're missing a .DLL file, you're missing it in the System folder. If you put it in the Game Directory it still won't work. I'm not just saying something, I know what I'm saying.


@ujking 

Same as xandyxsk8x:

[T],Games4theworld,2010-05-09T12:02Z,"Hi,


@pker999

If you applied the Multiplayer Crack, backup your Save files, uninstall the Game, restart your PC and reinstall the Game. You shouldn't get the error any more.



@darkdevil88

No, there's no need to burn anything, just run the 'Setup.exe' and the Game will Install itself."

[T],Games4theworld,2010-10-19T15:46Z,"Hello,

@a7x9952

The error has nothing to do with Steam, you just need to correctly apply the Crack. Open the ""# Crack"" folder in the .rar file you Downloaded and drag & drop áll files in there to: C\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Modern Warfare 2
and choose ""Replace"" on the pop-up that appears.


@lordlycan

Try to Update your Graphic Card's drivers and be sure to check: http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/
If your PC doesn't support the Game, you'll have to buy a new, better Graphic Card, I'm afraid."

[T],Games4theworld,2011-01-09T01:37Z,"Hello,

@KhaosRipper

I recommend you use uTorrent.

@a7x9952

Please copy the crack to: C:\Program Files (x86\Activision\Modern Warfare 2
and choose ""Replace"" on the pop-up that appears, telling you the files already exist.

@wilsons40

I don't know, sorry.

@gangsta12473 & @samwal1990 & @hack_96

Please open the .rar file you downloaded using WINRAR, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org , and then drag & drop all the files in there to a folder on your Desktop.
Open that folder on your Desktop and start the installation again."

Re-try using uTorrent.

Sorry, we do not give support for MP cracks at the moment. You could try to play on cracked servers.
