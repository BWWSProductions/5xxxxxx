The police receive a call from John Burke--his 21-year-old wife Alexis has been missing for three days. She hasn't been seen since she fled in the family car after a fight. Detective Robert Lee isn't certain what kind of a case he is investigating--missing person or murder. Frustrated by the progress of the investigation, Alexis' mother consults local psychic Laurie McQuary.

When Detective Lee's case runs cold, he meets with Laurie. The psychic shares her visions--John strangled Alexis; many people know what happened but aren't talking; water is important; there's an older large car involved; and John's younger brother Kelly is implicated. Intrigued, Detective Lee investigates the clues. It takes a year, but eventually Kelly confesses. All of Laurie's "predictions" proved accurate. A murder case is closed, but a new life for Detective Lee and Laurie begins when the couple later marries.
