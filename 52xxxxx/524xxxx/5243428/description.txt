Organism Academy Award winning film maker Hilary Harriss epic vision of New York City shot over 15 years [1959-74] during which time Mr. Harris pioneered and contemporized time-lapse film making techniques to achieve this unique experiential view of the world we inhabit. 

Hilary Harris is one of the few really interesting filmmakers in the country  a keen and penetrating visual perception  a search for understanding of the complex world about  rare combination of qualities  necessary to making great films 
 Leo Hurwitz, former head of NYU Graduate School of the Arts 

Hilary is unquestionably one of the most original and talented filmmakers of the American independent cinema  he is in a class by himself, a master of his craft.

Why make films at all? To give a richer vision of surrounding reality. My aim is to lift people out of their preconceptions.  Hilary Harris
