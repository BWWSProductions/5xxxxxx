,Cyanide99,2011-06-25T10:21Z,"thanks, downloading both games. FYI, ISO is easier to use in ePSXe, because you don't have to mount in alcohol120 first. it's easy to convert myself, just a tip."
,Kuugen401,2011-12-01T02:18Z,"Downloaded it, played it...well to a point. I seem to crash in a specific point in the game. 
Right when i recuit Sheena and Kasumi in Toran Republic.
I can do anything else before it, i checked it mutiple times but just seem to crash right at that point. Tell me if anyone elsee has this problem"
