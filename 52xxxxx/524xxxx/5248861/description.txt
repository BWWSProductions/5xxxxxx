'Treat Me Like Your Mother' is a single released by the alternative rock band "The Dead Weather." It is the second single released off of the band's debut album "Horehound" (after "Hang You from the Heavens" was released in March 2009.) The single was released on May 25, 2009 and released with the album on Jule 14, 2009.

The song was co-written by every member of the band. Alison Mosshart told Mojo magazine about the writing process of the band: "Everybody just did what they wanted. I wrote most of the lyrics because that's my favorite thing, and everybody wrote different parts to the music- someone would lead with something and I'd be writing furiously, and within an hour we'd have something good enough to record or work on. It was super-easy and super-quick." 

A short film was made in support of the single. It was directed by Jonathan Glazer.

The video features drummer Jack White and lead vocalist Alison Mosshart walking across an open field outside of a suburban neighbourhood carrying automatic weapons and dressed in black leather jackets. They then proceed to fire at each other, hitting each other many times but neither appears to feel any impact. The video ends when Mosshart and White run out of ammunition and White proceeds to leave, walking off into the sunset.

The video was also rated 1st in the top 50 videos of 2009 by NME on NME TV, in the UK.

The single fared decently on the US and UK charts. It peaked at #40 on "Hot Modern Rock Tracks" and at #168 on the "UK Singles Chart."
