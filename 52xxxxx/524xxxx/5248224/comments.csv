,Thelgord,2010-01-08T13:50Z,"And yet your here, and you posted a comment. This means you took the time register with this site. Which means you use the site. I am sure your not here for public domain poetry. 

Hypocrisy is such a sad thing. "

,Hecubus452,2010-04-09T03:27Z,"I can confirm that this breaks if you update to version 1.54.
Stick to 1.53 until a real [k] comes out."
,anarchistsagainstthings,2010-10-10T21:10Z,"I managed to reset the trial period on the latest (I think 1.54) version of scrivener by deleting the application, then looking through the user library under application support for something like com.apple.literatureandlatte... there were two files there I deleted, plus another folder, named scrivener, somewhere in the user library that I deleted. Then I reinstalled and the demo was reset. "
,da_canister,2011-12-06T18:44Z,"Scrivener is not a major corporation making tons of money off a product some guy on a salary designed. Scrivener, until recently, was ONE GUY, and it's still SMALL. Big difference, folks. Have a little respect for the entrepreneur--the little guy--and either pay the 40 bucks or do NaNoWriMo (google it) and get a code for 50% off. You folks would make lousy pirates; pirates show honor among thieves. "
