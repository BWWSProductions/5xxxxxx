This is a tiny app that will reset the time remaining on the trial version of Scrivener 1.53. It was built and tested on 64-bit osX 10.6.2 so I am not sure if it will work for 32, but it should. 

There is no keygen or other "crack" for Scrivener available for Snow Leopard, but this is close enough since everything is made functional in the trial version anyway. 

Good luck and happy writing!

Make sure Scrivener is NOT running when you run this
