,kimbab,2010-01-07T10:44Z,"Picture #4 definitely looks like her, but if you change the last number in the link (from 1 up to 15), the rest do not. I don't think it is her. "
,bialystok,2010-04-22T17:42Z,This girl looks like Sandra's Mom but she is not
,Badinov,2010-07-05T05:50Z,"Definitely not Sandra's mom. I remember this girl (the guy is her photographer named Harry). He had a lot of models working for him in the 90's, including models who went on to bigger things, like Jennifer Stone. This girl was just a pudgy girl with big boobs and puffies."
,Heides666,2011-07-30T14:27Z,Could be. Except her mom doesn't have a beard. On her face or her ass.  This one has both.
