,jadmoalv,2010-01-13T03:20Z,Awsome. Great video quality and audio. Perfect dvd rip.
,PCorMac,2010-01-14T22:37Z,Excellent quality. There is another torrent labeled Zombieland (2009) DVDRip XviD-MAX link: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5182417/Zombieland_(2009)_DVDRip_XviD-MAX that has some glitches in audio and video in certain spots and is a generally lower quality rip than this one that NLX provided. Since there is a problem with that page you can't leave comments on it but don't download that one it blows. This one that NLX made is 100% better. A-10 V-10 Thanks NLX!

,stimulation,2010-01-22T09:41Z,"awesome quality, thanks for the u/l"
,doncast23,2010-01-22T11:00Z,"@bigbadbob73  . what a retard. stop complaining. how the heck was that a ""sincere question"" you moron. Download another torrent then if you don't like this one. stop your stupid bitching.and bugger off. "
,bigbadbob73,2010-01-22T18:44Z,"@ doncast23 : r u another nlx little bitch : what a RETARD SPASTIC  like u does not understand, is that other uploaders when faced with a technical problem if indentified by downloaders, try to post some info on how to rectify or re-encode to get the glitch out of the upload - unless it is intentional??? thats not wat TPB is about, by spiking the codes to ensure one cannot burn the dowload to DVD or such like. When an uploader get thier bones, its a sign of a trusted uploader which will not pack virus or other malware shit into the upload. if It was warned that this could not be burned, it should have been stated, and I would not have wasted my bandwidth DL, and I did DL from another source which burned 100% 1st time. So fuck all u NLX little bitches and coksuckers. I asked a genuine question  and oulined a real problem with respect to the UL, and I have a right to warn other DL of problems associated with these torrents. Pricks like u know fuck all, and never will. I appreciate all the work n time the UL do on this site, and I always try to ensure I seed on a 1:1 ration at all times, but dont think for one moment I will kiss the arse of any uploader especially on with bones, when they try to fuck with the DL on this site without saying a word. U can all now suk my BIGBADBOB cock now. Peace"

,blc628,2010-01-27T13:37Z,"BTW, great quality on this one, even on the 50"".  Thanks nlx."
,Miscreant_Stapler,2010-02-12T04:55Z,"@bigbadbob73

Dude, seriously, did you try using a different program? Do you even know how to use the one you've got? Your shitty converter is probably causing all the problems, since half the point is to be able to burn this to DVD if you so chose. At least go pirate another conversion program, since you obviously didn't pay for this film, before whining about shit you don't understand.

To reiterate, you're a piece of borderline illiterate trailer trash."

Cheers nlx, works fine"
,sassie15,2010-02-24T23:28Z,"i haven't even dl'd it yet...but i'm gonna go out on a limb here and say: bigbadBOOB! what a jerk with too much time on his hands if he can sit around posting a*hole comments about everyone.

,sassie15,2010-02-27T03:35Z,thanks very much. quality is beautiful.
,warren peace,2010-03-10T01:21Z,"Thanks for this nlx_78, a gr8 copy at long last!

bigBENTbob73.......get a life! TPB doesn't need toilet mouths like you, take the hint and move on!"
,missRoxy,2010-04-16T21:48Z,"I actually had the same problem as trash mouth Bob. I've been using this site for years and I know what I'm doing when it comes to converting and burning movies, but when I tried to do so with this torrent, I had the same problem he had. It played fine on my PC. I've never had that problem before, so I'm not sure what the problem was. Had to download another torrent. This played great on my computer anyway, so thanks for the upload :) "
,juju_terror,2010-06-06T16:39Z,Awesome upload and great quality! Thanks!
