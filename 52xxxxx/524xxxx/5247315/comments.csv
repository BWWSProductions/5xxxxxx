Cheese contains MODIFIED WHEY
Most pre-packaged food contains one of the following :

MODIFIED FOOD STARCH, MODIFIED POTATO STARCH, MODIFIED TAPIOCA STARCH, MODIFIED WHEAT STARCH, MODIFIED CORN STARCH,AND MORE....

This is sad. I refuse to intentionally buy anything with those on the label. But, now imagine if the laws of label exposure go away.
That's what many are reading into codex. Please protect yourself. Find a reputable food storage company and set yourself up for w few years. Start now. You won't be sorry."

,Demon_661987,2009-12-31T01:54Z,"ease seed when finished all. most of my torrents are in need of seeders. I seed as much as I can and overnight central time USA. But once I see some seeders, I expect that you will help seed and not just take the info and remove it. Please help me and others to spread this information. Also please see my latest post ""Rima Laibow - Codex Alimentarius Complete."" I forgot about this one and it was left out of this release, so please be sure to download it to at one of my pages:
