Recorded during the US tour for his fourth solo album, 1989's BUT SERIOUSLY, 1990's SERIOUS HITS...LIVE! is Phil Collins' first solo live album. True to its title, the album functions neatly as a live greatest hits summation; indeed, Collins' ... Full Descriptionband, featuring longtime guitar sideman Darryl Steurmer, is so impeccably rehearsed that at times it's difficult to tell the difference between these recordings and the original studio versions. 

Highlights include a solo piano rendition of "In the Air Tonight" that's nearly as thick with dread and atmosphere as the original, and a hypnotic, extended version of the Peter Gabriel-like "Take Me Home." If you're a Phil Collins fan, SERIOUS HITS...LIVE! is a pleasant diversion. 

Recorded at various locations during Phil Collins' Serious Tour 1990
