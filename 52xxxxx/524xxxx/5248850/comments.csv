Movie hasnt been released.Check imdb."
,TuffGong81,2009-12-31T19:26Z,"Yeah, but if you check IMDB there is a user comment about the movie, so obviously it has been released, maybe limited. Also the uploader has a green skull."
[V],matimike,2010-01-03T10:42Z,"NOT fake
a/v 10 thanks cgaurav007

@Pranjallamba  dont cry fake when your clueless, noob"
,odin1904,2010-01-03T17:27Z,"Is a real torrent, And is not fake as Pranjallamba said, Just cause isnt released in say usa yet, doesnt mean it isnt real. Net flix doesnt even have this available yet. But yet I downloaded it and it does work. Thanks"

,starblazer007,2010-01-21T11:42Z,someone tell that moron pranjallamba that russia or UK or europe has or usually has a movie released first and that it iiis possible that anyone can copy it or use a cam to send it on the piartebay.org.Check it out on IMDB .com it released here in the us.
,decebal2003,2010-01-26T05:09Z,"tanilfa,

,johndoe48,2010-02-09T13:32Z,"1: It's not fake, it's the real deal, plays well, and a damn good dvd rip. 2: Yes, it's Steven Seagal, says so on the freakin cover, that's why I downloaded it. 3: If you don't like Seagal's movies, them don't download them, duh! 4: Without analyzing the piss out of it, it's a pretty good movie. 5: Thanks so much cgaurav007 for the download, I enjoyed it."
