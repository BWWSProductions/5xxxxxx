,12scrappydappydo,2010-03-14T17:07Z,dont complain 2 days is ultra fast for me my line only supports 2meg and takes about 3 days+ for any game. will comment on perfomance sometime next week dl started 16:02 14/3/10
,mjhorton,2010-10-31T20:19Z,"Why do people come back screaming to seed on every single torrent? The ones that DL and move on will not come back to read it anyway. And why is it so hard to understand that ""leachers"" are people that are seeding but haven't gotten 100% yet? I know the word also means those who DL then don't seed, but come on.
Also people are so spoiled whining that its taking 2 days to get a game for free. If you are that impatient go buy it. It takes me 2-3 week to DL a torrent of this size on my 512k DSL."
,mjhorton,2010-10-31T20:20Z,At least he didn't also whine that the description wasn't in english...
