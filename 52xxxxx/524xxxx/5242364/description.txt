ALL english subs that are for navi parts are incorrect or fake unless they are these subs, these are the exact subs as they are in american theaters.

These are the actual PROPER english subtitles you would see.
If you went and watched this in an american theater, word for word.
Yay!
I went through hell making this (2.5 hours) so enjoy it :p.

Obviously for camelot release..
camelot-avatar1
camelot-avatar2

For IMAGiNE/MAXSPEED Releases
Avatar.TS.XviD - IMAGiNE


Since all the TS's are usually the same sources...
These subs should work good on any release.
Just name them the same as the video file/s,
And they should load in whatever player you use.
