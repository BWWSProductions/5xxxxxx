Good on yer for uploading these excellent Aussie albums. Hope you had a fair dinkum Xmas and downed a few tinnies."
[V],nightissuchproximity,2010-01-02T12:10Z,"fendermental!!!   Had you pegged as an American.   Did not know you're Australian.
And I did have a dinkum one along with a few tinnies...
   ...and I even found myself a young sheila to 
amuse me Boxing Day.
   Hope your festivities are going as well as mine."
,fendermental,2010-01-02T16:35Z,"I'm not an Aussie, I'm a Pom from North London but now living in Norfolk (no comments...please!!) My musical tastes on go in only 3 directions, Blues, Reggae and Australian Rock from the 80's. Had a good Xmas but actually drank less booze than I normally do. Is your Sheila for life or just Xmas?"
[V],nightissuchproximity,2010-01-03T07:47Z,"I'm not an Aussie either.   I'm a twat now living in Manchester, Lancashire; but originally from South Queensferry, Scotland.   
   And the Sheila is not for life.   Just for amusement.   Only Jane Fonda would be for life.   I've never been right since I first saw her in Barbarella.   Have had weird fantasies ever since.   
   And there is nothing wrong with Norfolk...apart from the fact it borders Lincolnshire.

Cheers, bro.
