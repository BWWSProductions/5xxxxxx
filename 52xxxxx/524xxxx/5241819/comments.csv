,dougbug,2011-08-05T05:32Z,Only a piece of shit would upload an english language movie with english subtitles -- and not state what language the audio is.  Fuck your mother's smelly cunt.
,nosing_glass,2012-01-07T00:40Z,"thx for uploading but the download is way too slow.
btw: the language is clearly stated as english but dougbug is a obviously a ""piece of shit"" too dumb to read."
,nosing_glass,2012-01-07T13:08Z,"thx again, m8. fine quality and the download speed increased after a short while. "
