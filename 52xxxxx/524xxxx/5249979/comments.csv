,Impulse202,2010-01-06T19:44Z,"@Dereck91984 ;
No, movies on PSP's isn't going into the movie folder... They should be added to your picture-folders, and then crosslinked to your music-folders trough a systemcable inserted in the back of your PSP. Good luck!"
,Killer_l3ee,2010-01-20T00:05Z,"Good work as usual!, HR! I must say, I have DL almost all of your PSP movies because the quality is always so good...  My PSP finally has a use thanks to you (because the games are pretty lame really).

PS. The Wire is worth a decent PSP version, nudge nudge. "

,jiggysiggy,2011-03-09T14:12Z,"warnung an alle deutschen nutzer!!! dieser torrent wird von der kriminellen abzocker-kanzlei ""waldorf und frommer"" ueberwacht. mit dem download dieses films riskiert ihr eine abmahnung von 1000 euro. ehrlich gesagt ist dieser film eh ziemlich kacke, er ist es jedenfalls nicht wert dafuer geld auszugeben. wenn ihr den film unbedingt haben wollt dann holt ihn euch bei einem one-klick-hoster, dann koennen euch zumindest die waldorf-frommer-hurensoehne nichts anhaben."
