,user087,2009-12-31T09:50Z,"Is this the 2009.Q3 service pack1 that they released Dec 11? I understand that the sp1 works with Visual studio 2010 Beta2
Here's the release date history link:

THE INSTALLER IS CORRUPT!

Besides this in order to use it for VS 2010 you need sp1;
RadControls for ASP.NET AJAX 2009 Q3 SP1"
,rcmacdon,2010-01-05T15:20Z,"The files are all Zipped, than rar'd.  The RAR won't extract properly, so this is a useless torrent.  I am very interested in trying this before buying - so please re-upload!"
,rcmacdon,2010-01-05T16:09Z,"CORRECTION: i solved the rar problem, my mistake, sorry :(

Additionally, there was an error on the install, but this was because I had a previous version installed and the installer did not have permissions to access the existing directory.  I simply set the permissions on the install folder (C:\Program Files\Telerik) to everyone full control, and reran the install and it worked perfect.....I then obviously removed those permissions again.....

THANKS, THIS IS GREAT !!!!!  previous problems just needed a little tweaking

IT WORKS!"
