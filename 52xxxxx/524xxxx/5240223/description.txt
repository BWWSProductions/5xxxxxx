I'm in college majoring in Game and Simulation Programming and I have just started learning C++ so I made these and wanted to see what other people thought. Leave me comments or email me(gcarlson53@gmail.com) let me know what you like and what I can do to make these better, and also let me know of other things that you would like me to make and I will make it. A more updated and detailed version will be coming soon. Thank you!
