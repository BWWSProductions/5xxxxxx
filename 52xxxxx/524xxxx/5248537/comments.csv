I have Freeview on my laptop and everything was set up to record so I nipped to the shop for some beer.  There was a large queue and I didn't get back in time to hit record.

I was bloody fuming.  Been waiting for 3 days for a torrent to appear.

So for the 4th time, Thank You

:) Happy New Year!"
,Arrowdodger,2010-01-02T11:00Z,Any subtitles?
,ghoulfiend,2010-01-02T11:08Z,Why would you post this as an MKV? Why? It's too big and that's not a standard file format. This really pisses me off. I am going to look for an smaller AVI.
,flake1965,2010-01-02T17:46Z,"Ghoulfiend,

Why don't you download AVC i.e. Any Video Convertor from Filehippo.  It can convert MKV to AVI

Here's a link

MKV has become the standar container for HD Video (720p in this case) in x264/h264 codec."
,bongowolf,2010-01-19T05:18Z,"THE SOUND IS COMPLETELY OUT OF SYNCH. throughout the entire movie. Any suggestions on a fix?  
I was playing on Total Video Player . . . should I use another?  Or convert to AVI?  With the sound being so out of wack, it's not watchable.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated!"
,bongowolf,2010-01-19T08:47Z,"Cancel my above comment - sorry! When the video is converted to AVI, the sound comes right back into perfect synch.  No problems at all.  Thanks for uploading this. "
