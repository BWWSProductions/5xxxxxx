,hurukhan,2009-12-29T18:13Z,"Hey man, I've been blocked at 99,88% for 2 days now, are you going to seed the game again?"
,fresch3000,2009-12-30T01:17Z,"I am seeding full speed :)
I can see that the game have been downloaded several times by other people.
So have patience :)"
,hurukhan,2009-12-30T15:51Z,Well I have been blocked at 99.88% for 3 days now... Isn't that strange?
,hurukhan,2010-01-01T18:25Z,5 days blocked at 99.88%!!
,delorianalpha,2010-01-04T17:36Z,"Anyone, PLEASE seed, 99.75% since Dec 25th."
,PezDude,2010-01-04T19:05Z,"Oh come on!!! Stuck at 99.7%. It says there should be 2 seeders but it's not connecting to them.
Is this ever going to finish???"
,PezDude,2010-01-04T19:32Z,"Well, that's it. I've just trawled the net downloading this games torrent from almost every known website and they're ALL stuck at the same point. 
Come on uploader. All we need is 5Mb!!!!! Is that really so much to ask for?"
,PezDude,2010-01-05T13:55Z,"Mwahahahah! It finally finished. No idea how! But I'll seed this sucker as long as possible since the original uploader seems to have vanished!
Please seed after you finish downing..."
,PezDude,2010-01-05T14:08Z,"Update:
Oooookay. Bit odd. Game works great. Mounted fine but Vuze just came up with a message that one sector was corrupt and needs to be redownloaded. Once again stuck at 99.8%.
My copy is working fine but it seems I won't be saving the starving masses anytime soon.
If it redownloads the missing sector I'll upload like blazes before anything else goes pear shaped..."
,PezDude,2010-01-05T21:51Z,"Nope, all good now. Seeding now."
,Londork,2010-01-09T10:16Z,"The Game almost works for me! 
Followed the following instructions and everything seemed to work fine until a popup says that ""hd2.exe has encoutered a serious problem and must be terminated""...

It says something about a program named ""Wine"".
Since I'm an IDIOT, I have no idea what to do... 

Is it because i run it on a MacBook? HELP please!"
,coughlm,2010-05-26T19:44Z,"Requesting seed.  Almost finished downloading, I will keep the seed up upon completion.

Thanks."
