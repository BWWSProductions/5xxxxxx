Before starting the game, the screen resolution must be changed in the game to match your screen.

To do that, right click on the game icon and click on "Show Package Content".

Launch "ScreenOptions", select "Fullscreen" and choose your resolution.
DONT choose widescreen resolutions, as the game doesn't support it. 
This will make the game cherish.

Just choose the 4:3 resolution closest to your resolution.
Example. Are you running a screen resolution of 1920x1200, choose 1600x1200, in "ScreenOptions".

Close "ScreenOptions", and navigate to "Contents".
Open "Info.plist", in Property List Editor (Xcode Dev. Tools), or in your favorite Text Editor.

Find the Line: "/Program Files/Illusion Softworks/HiddenDangerous 2/hd2.exe"
and change it to: "/Program Files/Illusion Softworks/HiddenDangerous 2/setup.exe"

Run the game, and a configuration too will launch.
Choose the same resolution here, as in ScreenOptions (Example. 1600x1200); and setup your graphics options.

Click "Save and Exit"

Now you need to change the "info.plist" back to how it was before.
To do that, right click on the game icon and click on "Show Package Content".
Navigate to "Contents", and open info.plist, like above.

Change the line: "/Program Files/Illusion Softworks/HiddenDangerous 2/setup.exe"
back into: "/Program Files/Illusion Softworks/HiddenDangerous 2/hd2.exe"

Save the file, and Launch the game.
Hopefully everything should work :)
