This is a DTS 5.1 conversion created using the SPEC method (ArcTan mode) as found on www.surroundbyus.com.

Only playable on stereo equipment and PC software capable of decoding a DTS signal. Otherwise, you will hear static.

Enjoy my 5.1 of one of the best albums of the past couple of years, created using a 180 gram vinyl source for improved source sound quality.
