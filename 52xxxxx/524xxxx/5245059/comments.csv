Please help out if you like this app. It's been a while we've been waiting for a cracked one!!

The Pirate Bay tracker doesn't seem to work, but I added several others so it's out there even if it says 0 seeders. (sorry am a bit of a torrent noob)"
,mrpras,2009-12-27T22:03Z,"Also worth mentioning - For me it installed no Desktop Icon or start menu items. It can be accessed through the Computer Management interface or by starting the default windows defragment program. (Which it replaces).

Enjoy"
,Zensch,2009-12-28T21:21Z,"Works out of the box for me. Hope it keeps working after a while, this application tends to expire even when cracked.

Thanks mrpras!"
,kungavsill,2009-12-29T13:23Z,This is very nice. No cracking or fake activation like with previous versions. This seems to be an msi-file or something that just configures everything for you. You don't need to do anything but run the program. I love this. Thank you so much.
,dcrago,2010-01-16T08:19Z,"out of all the diskeeper 2010 files on PB this is the only one that works. however...if you update this it doesn't work.

will seed when I can."
,mrpras,2010-04-30T13:36Z,"Thanks for the feedback, yes I was happy when I found it :) It's cracked (not using a serial) so in most cases yes, updating it will break it because it replaces the cracked files with newer uncracked versions.

Some apps using serials can be updated but some will realise that you are using a bad key.

Basic rule, if you want the updates - wait for a crack or buy the software (if you think you deserve the latest version that much, they probably deserve some of your money for making the softs in the first place)."
