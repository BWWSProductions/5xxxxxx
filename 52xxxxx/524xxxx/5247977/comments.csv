,sululu,2010-01-04T00:56Z,and while am at it. anyone have a cracked version of a good hospital/church/law firm management software?
,Beast_iND,2010-01-04T02:50Z,"@ekac: Well, since I don't work for Quickbooks, I can't really answer that question.

They could:
- just ask you to activate again, at which point you will have to buy the software.
- encrypt your data and only give you access to it once you buy the software from them via an operator.
- trash your data and force you to start from scratch.
- (imagine other evil plots and put here)...

As you can see, the  possibilities are endless. My point is: using software without paying can have any sorts of side-effects and you have no leg to stand on legally. So if you worry about that sort of thing, I recommend you shell out the money and buy the product. That way, if something does happen to your data, you have a certain amount of legal recourse.

That is why I was not going to help people who requested POS9 at first because: what can the customer do if their credit card data is compromised due to a cracked copy of QuickBooks Point of Sale? They can sue you, the business owner. What can you, the business owner, do? Nothing, because you were using a pirate copy..."

,Beast_iND,2010-01-05T02:59Z,"@sululu: Yeah, I would recommend disabling auto-updates anyway. You can always download the newest update manually. That way, you can set a restore point before installing it and if it disables something, go back to the previous version.

I would also block Quickbooks in the firewall, that way it can't call home all the time."

,Beast_iND,2010-02-09T02:30Z,"@DaGotti: That's weird! When I tested it, I used a different serial on both machines and the first time I connected to the server, it told me it had to ""merge"" the license and that I had to call support. But then it let me click next and made me ""swear"" that the licenses had been merged by support. After that, it worked like a charm.

If you use the same serial on both machines, I believe you have to increase the amount of licenses on the server by using the 99999930 trick again. Read the patcher instructions, it explains it."

so having POS8 on both pc's with the same license codes, when i goto make one of the pc's a remote host, it asks for the license key of the HQ pc, and when i put that in, it says the key is already in use on this computer...

i have updated now to pos9, which is working also without issues, but i have kept 1 pc as pos8 and i was able to do this task since they are both using different key information. but if i want to upgrade the other to pos9 i will have the same issue unless i have a seperate registration key for it im assuming.

so with all that being said, how can i make the 2 computers work as remote and HQ while using the same key if possible?"

I have confirmed that this activator works with the Quickbooks 2008 UK Version, Quickbooks Premier 2010 CA Version, POS9 US Version and Cash Register Plus 2010 US Version as well.

With the About window open press CTRL+R then CTRL+P and it will open  the telephone activation screen that will allow to input the code.
I'm also planning to put up a torrent with a link to this torrent or using your activator provided and instructions for direct downloads of the latest versions (as of May 1st, 2010) of the CA/UK/US versions of Quickbooks which were all tested with your activator, using the License Number and Product Numbers you and others have provided (for which each one will be given due credit for).

To finish the torrent I'm looking for Product Numbers for the following only:
Quickbooks Enterprise 9 CA Version
Quickbooks Pro 2010 CA Version
Quickbooks Enterprise 10 US Version
QuickBooks Credit Card Processing Kit 2010 US Version

The sooner anyone can provide them, the faster I can put up the torrent which will include the direct download links from Intuit's websites, License and Product Numbers that have been tested and are functioning, along with Beast_iND's activator for the above products, as well as the following that have already been tested and are functioning:

it first downloads just over 500kb downloader and then starts to dwoonload the quickboosk pos v10... but why its file size is so small... as compared to previsous versions? previous versions are over 550 MB?

and what is the disference between posv10free and posv10 simple???

please tell mee..."
,aewfasdf,2010-10-02T11:14Z,They got rid of the cash register plus and a couple of other versions like multi store (every pro version has multi store included) I saw the free version when I downloaded it too.  Nowhere on google does it mention it's existence. So I assume that is the new cash register plus (it was free too I think)  http://quickbooks.intuit.com/point-of-sale-upgrade/?scid=qbkm_POS talks about new to v10 and http://quickbooks.intuit.com/product/accounting_software/retail_pos_solutions/compare.jsp talks about 7.0 to 10.0.
,aewfasdf,2010-10-02T11:20Z,"@ebudget

The new version is about 110 mb and it appears they broke up the database and the gui and simplified the entire program.  (Notice how the search box searches work orders, sales orders, items and customers.)

@beast

QB POS 10 appears to work differently from previous versions there is a qbpos.exe and a qbposgui (don't remember the name of the other exe) separate from each other.  After running the crack I got a comm error when closing the POS GUi and the program would refuse to open the company file.  Repairing the install is the only thing that would fix it."
,ebudget,2010-10-02T12:03Z,"@aewfasdf couple of questions?

what is the difference between the quickbooksposv10free.exe & quickbooksposv10.exe???

are they both the same?

and you said that you tried to patch it, right? but how if you dont have the key to install the qucikbooksposv10.exe???"

It might not be a big deal... it looks like the entitlement service is the same because it does identify the file and patch it.  It looks like the handshake may be a little different.

I hope you can crack it because the new interface looks sweet.  I love the idea of one global search instead of the v9 click on sales order and search click on inventory and search click on work orders ...

where's the key?
the key which came by installing the v10free version, only gives limited functionality, because i didn't found any CASH DRAWER PAYOUT link, didn't got any vendor menu... etc... if you have some different key to enable the qbposv10.exe, please share with me...

(what i did to install, i downloaded both the files, and then tried to install qbposv10.exe, but it ask for the key, so i canceled it and then installed the qbposv10free.exe, installed properly and then gave me the 5 day trial, i registered it with qb and then gave me i think 90 days to use, i uninstalled it becoz didn't found full functionality in it, and tried to install the qbposv10.exe, but this time there was a key pre written in the fields, i installed it and it was same as free, with no payouts and vendors, etc...)///

READ THE FOLLOWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
After install, disable network or POS will try to activate that way and it will hang. Then run, create or import your company and close down POS. Now run activator and let it patch the file, then once it shows instructions, re-start ""Intuit Entitlement Service v6.0"" before starting POS or it will not load the company file. Either go to services.msc to start the service or open an elevated cmd window and type

net start ""Intuit Entitlement Service v6.0""

POS should now bring up a dialog that tells you that you have x days left to activate. It also shows a ""Activate now by phone"" link. Click it and enter 99999930 as the confirmation code, as usual. It should activate (it did for me). You can also add more licenses while you're at it. Once done, close POS and let the activator restore the files.

You're done!

I will update the activator to restart the service automatically when time allows, but for now, the above will have to do. Have not tested client/server connection with POS yet, will do later."

Thank you very much for you time. Hope you can handle AccuPos.
Also I've got another nice peace of software for you to activate. Simply Accounting is competitor to QB and actually is stronger system than QB. It's already acivated, but recently Sage added reporting solutions called SA Intelligence it gives you unlimited possibilities of Excel base reporting from SA. But they chard for it too not cheap there are to version standard and advance.  Shortly SAI also needs activation. But it's not like QBs activation when serial and product number are checked over internet. SA activation is 14 digit alphanumeric serial which is activated by 24 alphanumeric activation code. So their combination make it, no checking over server is involved. I think in this regard it's easier than QB activation. But I don't have serial that's the 1st problem and second of course generation of activation code. Maybe you got interested. It's very capable solution for small business. Thanks again Beast."

,Beast_iND,2010-10-30T02:22Z,@jonshonK: Can you provide a direct link for Simply Accounting installer? Because I really don't want to fill out the evaluation form on the Simply Accounting website!
,jonshonK,2010-10-30T06:55Z,"@Beast_iND

here's the link http://dlm.sagenorthamerica.com/dlnow.aspx?id=1208"

I don't have serial for AccuPos, Beast_iND is working on it.

is Candela any better than Intuit's POS 10?"
,Beast_iND,2010-10-30T20:05Z,"@jonshonK: Thanks for the link. It is downloading ""Sage Simply Accounting First Step 2011 (Express Version) (Canada)"", is that what you want me to work on?"
,jonshonK,2010-10-30T21:06Z,"@Beast_iND

Installer package is the same for all versions, it's serial number that turns installation to first step, pro, premium or enterprise, so you can confidently use the link I provided just make sure you follow steps while installing. "

I mean the steps I provided in my post above. You're welcome and thanks!"

Thank you so much for QB POS activator, i need activator or licence for Quickpractice pro. Kindly get it from http://www.quickpractice.com/QP-Install.exe."
,choujijj,2010-11-02T01:35Z,"Hey Beast_iND, how goes the update to the activator?"
,jonshonK,2010-11-02T05:55Z,"@choujijj

what product you need new activator for?"
,Beast_iND,2010-11-02T14:44Z,"@choujijj: I'm working on it in my spare time, just about ready for release. I've had to add Terminal Services support, restarting of the Entitlement Service for POS10 and killing of the QBW32 process after activation so I can restore the files.

No telling how well this will work :)"
,jonshonK,2010-11-02T16:12Z,"@Beast_iND

Do you have any progress with Simply Accounting Intelligence? Just update us please."
,choujijj,2010-11-03T00:13Z,"@Beast_iND

If you want me to give it a shot, I don't mind being the guinea pig. Worst case scenario is that it doesn't work. ^_^"
,expertweb,2010-11-03T03:33Z,"@ Beast_iND

Any hope for Quickpractice pro activator ?. Thank you."
,ramacan,2010-11-07T19:20Z,AccuPOS appears to be a very hard nut to crack!!!
,Beast_iND,2010-11-08T02:29Z,"@ramacan: Yeah, when the person cracking it has no time to do it :)

I have exactly one day/week for leisurely activities such as cracking protections and the past 3 weeks, that day had to be used for things outside of the computer environment."
,jonshonK,2010-11-08T08:00Z,"@Beast_iND

Could you post license & product numbers for QB Enterprise 10 Canadian or Premium 2011 Canadian? Thanks!"
,freshwater1433,2010-11-09T07:27Z,"@Beeast_iND,

I think that Cash Register Express may be a good substitute for Intuit POS. I have cracked ASPROTECT protection on files before, but I have no idea where to start with CRE. Could you please take a look and help me crack it? (If it's easy for you, could you do it? If not, could you point me in the right direction, so that I can try?)

Than you so much!!

,Beast_iND,2010-11-12T15:48Z,@ramacan: I would guess this is a heuristic flag triggered either by the compression on the file or by the fact that the activator temporarily patches (modifies) files to achieve its goal.
,choujijj,2010-11-17T15:08Z,That PC threat website is rated dangerous from WOT. Don't trust it.

,Beast_iND,2010-11-18T15:54Z,Just about ready to release the updated activator. Just need to test a few things. Then all the other projects will come next.

,think_ng,2010-12-27T11:27Z,"I got Payroll on QuickBooks to work for some days using another crack/patch, but I lost it...There is already Payroll inside the Canadian edition...It asks for code when I access Payroll, so I put 999993 (don't remember the number your activator gives on top of my head) it accepts for Payroll, but then when I click Payroll again it closes all the sub windows in QuickBooks, and then when I go back to Payroll it again asks for Code....I don't need to file payroll stuff online...just the basic stuff (like Employment Insurance calculations etc. or ROE (record of employment) and keep them stored in QuickBooks)...also if you open a sample file you will see Payroll works fine on that....

http://intuitglobal.intuit.com/downloads/CA/QuickBooks/2010/dls/R3/QuickBooksCA2010.exe

BTW I left QuickBooks open one time, and I clicked OK in your activator, so then I think it did not restore a file (the licensing hole file?) for updates, after putting code inside quickbooks and then I clicked OK in the activator then activator said Hash not found, and asked me to close activator."

Sales Data from AccuPOS 2010 to Quickbooks does not sync. Quickbooks is able to send Inventory information to AccuPOS but the reverse never works. It comes with the message No Sales Data to Export. This is after running the Z Report and Resetting Cash Till. Any fix? "
