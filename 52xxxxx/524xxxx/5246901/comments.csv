,Ofifo,2010-07-17T02:05Z,Thanx for this upload. One thing is that I don\'t think it works with iPhone 3Gs with latest iOS4.01 is it? If anyone can confirm that would help a lot! nnThanx again
,TQ442,2010-08-03T19:31Z,"Doesn't work here. I extracted the rar; installed the program using the windows installer. 

After that was done I could start the program in demo mode (100 files max..)

I then switched the .exe for the .exe in the extraced lz0 folder, but get an error when I try to open it :(

I did as albator7 said and replaced the .exe file in the programs directory with the .exe file that was downloaded with the torrent.

Didn't evne ask for a serial- I'm doing a full back up now as we speak!"

,Shadysmurff,2011-05-23T15:49Z,"@aoloffline

Hey, am i suposed to copy & paste the file_id.diz too along with the TouchCopy.exe or just the TouchCopy.exe only in the Wide Angle (folder) directory??"
,Shadysmurff,2011-05-23T17:13Z,"@TQ442 or to anyother who's having probs with getting error after you re-installed or overwriten the software:

Remember when doing your first/fresh install, DO NOT RUN THE PROGRAM YET AFTER INSTALLED, remember to first Copy the TouchCopy.exe inside the Lz0 folder and overwrite the one on whereever directory you installed for ex usually in : C:/Program Files/WideAngleSoftware Folder/

Now if you have accidentaly run the program after it installed without applying/copying the patch of TouchCopy.exe above then its already considered you need to uninstall the whole thing again, you must first start a clean-install & wipe out all traces of WideAngelSoftware.

Goto

Start>ControlPanel>AddRemovePrograms>Uninstall the TouchCopy or the one named WideAngelSoftware, we are not done yet as there are still traces of WideAngelSoftware inside your computer's regedit that records when you installed it previously before and records your trial period if it has passed, or even remember youve previously installed this onto your computer and your trial has already been used up.

Goto

Start>Run(for windows xp)>or just type in the search box (for windows vista/7)>then type Regedit>then look for WideAngelSoftware Folders related inside regedits (basically search for all Software Folders that has one inside either of these):

HKEY_CURRENT_USER>Software
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE>SOFTWARE
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG>Software

delete all folders named, or any thing regarding this name, ""WideAngelSoftware"" , then after all the traces have been deleted, you can start a real clean install."

,jdub666,2011-08-01T02:51Z,"This is what I did:

Open file with 7-zip,
Install Touchcopy (Didn't restart),
Extract file in ""Lz0"" folder to C:\Program Files(x86)[Only on 64bit]\Wide Angel Software

Copy and Replace. 
Restart and Wah-Lah 
Great upload much appreciated "
