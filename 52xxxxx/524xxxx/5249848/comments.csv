,Eumi,2010-03-05T16:24Z,"Hi Superpirate420 

yo...single files
go to your installation folder, in the Patches folder
anything like:
C:\Program Files\Image-Line\Fl Studio\Data\Patches

Just put it in!!!!.....make a own folder for it, do what you want, its in it at the next start of Fl Studio

Plugins and VstÂ´s...
yeah have a look i think youÂ´ll find the folder by your own where do install it =))"
