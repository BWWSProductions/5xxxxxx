[V],HMVinyl,2009-12-29T13:13Z,"sorry its early, anyway google is the best place to look, just add torrent to the end of the title that way you can search all the trackers at once, hope you find your cds :)"

[T],Juan.Too,2009-12-30T07:02Z,"@ notenough
I'll admit - your thought made me laugh.

I love how this torrent's comment section has been taken over."
[T],keka_umans,2009-12-30T10:04Z,Still broke huh.... too bad i got some new stuff waiting...

[V],albiondean,2009-12-30T14:53Z,"@ XeroxAlto, i'm trusted"
[T],XeroxAlto,2009-12-30T15:17Z,"@ albiondean

That makes one of us. I'm not sure what it takes. Curious.  "
[V],albiondean,2009-12-30T16:09Z,"@ XeroxAlto, take a look in the forum"
[V],albiondean,2009-12-30T16:22Z,http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=8535&highlight=trusted+members
[V],albiondean,2009-12-30T16:47Z,How come nobody's complained that there's nobody seeding this ?
[T],XeroxAlto,2009-12-30T16:49Z,"Thanks for that info. I don't like that some people are denied because their torrents aren't seeded. I up some items that aren't mainstream. TPB may show no seeds but many times there are. (Some have done really well though.) 

When you up stuff that won't be too popular many people DL and run. It stopped me from creating new stuff for a while. I suppose it's the nature of the beast. Now I can't upload new torrents. Who broke it?! (Ha!) 

Thanks for that link. It is interesting!

[T],XeroxAlto,2009-12-30T17:28Z,I imagine it will start when it is fixed. 8-|

,slywrp,2009-12-30T20:30Z,I hope this has nothing to do with the biggest IT personnel strike that's currently happening. I think it was dated to be from 28th December to 2nd January.
