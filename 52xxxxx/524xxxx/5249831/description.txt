Descripcion:

Japanese adventure game that uses hand-drawn graphics for both locations and characters. Taking place from the second semester of one school year, as summer begins, and continuing to March of the following year, you must study, take part in sports and work with your group of all-male schoolmates to search for a character called Sakura. You have to schedule your activities in order to increase your characters various parameters, with new events appearing and the affection felt by others towards you increasing as you grow stronger. The game uses the "reverse character coupling system," whereby stats changes not only occur on the side of the player character, but also on the NPCs . Features 80 CG scenes, the full voice treatment, and bonus discs with music. Released only in Japan.
