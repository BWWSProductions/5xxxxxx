[T],MelloYello,2010-01-01T20:36Z,I am having trouble getting the proper driver installed. I'm using Vista not XP.  Does that matter.  I keep doing all the steps correctly and when I try to install the right driver it says there is a problem code 10. So when I go to device manager the driver I want is there but it has the !sign next to it. I am using Atheros AE5007
[T],MelloYello,2010-01-01T20:39Z,I don't know anyone who has XP on their laptops.  I have it on my desktop but kind of pointless if I can't use my laptop.

,farty_breath,2010-03-22T13:23Z,"Nice one Yify. 
The chap giving the instruction's seems to know what he is talking about, shame he can't operate a camera!! Worth a mention at this stage that he is not using the same program that you have supplied.
However it does work, with many replay's and plenty of pause button use I have cracked my own WEP key. I now want to crack next doors WPA and am wondering if anyone has had the patience to write down the command string's that he is talking about, he's a bit fast for me and picture quality is to poor to freeze frame and print screen.

If you have, be so kind as to put it on here then we can all have a go.

Stick with the WEP program as it does work even though half of the right hand part of the screen is missing you have enough to do the trick."
,farty_breath,2010-03-22T13:35Z,"Yify, sorry just read your instruction's again it is the same program as the video, I never shoved the wizard button.

If you use the modern flavour as I did you have a lot less typing to do and the main buttons are the same as video, or appear to be through the haze.

Just goes to show you can't read instruction's to many times !"
,sasash,2010-04-02T20:09Z,hey having problem with comm view in tp link usb and dell half mini wirless card in inspiron 1545 any ideas???? 
,Demosthenes_Akira,2010-04-08T08:28Z,"Ok, my laptop has an integrated Intel(R) WiFi Link 5100 AGN card. My driver for that card is the most recent one issued. 

The commview website claims to support this card type, but when I install the commview program and order it to install the driver, nothing happens. 

It says that the driver has been installed, but I check the device manager and nothing has changed. Ive done this more than 8 times now, so I know it is not a fluke. 

Can anyone help me out? Maybe give me location to download the commview driver for my card by itself? Or perhaps instructions on how to isolate the driver from the commview files (I tried to do this but had no luck finding it)"

,tennisboy1222,2010-05-22T21:29Z,"hi yify,

i have an atheros ar5007 adapter, after updating it using the atheros folder in the airowizard folder, the yellow warning symbol shows up next to the adapter in device manager and my internet goes off.

My only choice was to rollback the adapter

Any help would be appreciated."
,tennisboy1222,2010-05-22T21:57Z,"nvm my first comment yify, i got past that and updated my adapter. 

However, once I open airowizard as per the second part of the tutorial, and start airserv -ng, the command prompt window opens and then goes away quickly.

Could you help me with this?"
,tennisboy1222,2010-05-23T17:07Z,"lol, nvm the second comment too. I got past that also, just had to run as admin cause im on vista.

Anyways, my new problem is after i start airserv, i cant start airodump as you can see in the picture:

,Diondi,2010-09-30T05:25Z,"I started looking into this a few days ago. I have tried several different programs and all that, I get most of this. I do have a few problems I would LOVE to get some type of answer to, any of them.

First, I have the Atheros AR5007 (although no matter where I download the new driver, I get the ""AR5006""). my first problem is what ive already read in the comments, they seemed to have fixed the problem but i'm not sure how. It's the fact when I install the driver in the pack sent, it does not work. All I get is my internet cut off, well... my damn computer crashes almost instantaniously too. So I have grabbed the updated version of the AR5006 from a new version of Commview. With it, my computer does not crash, but I am not sure if it's effecting anything.

Another problem is when I turn on AiroWizard, it gives me an error telling me an unhandled exception occured, and that I need to download ""Microsoft Data Access"", I have already downloaded this, and it still does not work.

Lastly, I also cant seem to get airserv-ng to work either, it just pops open for a second and goes away.

Also, I am running vista."
