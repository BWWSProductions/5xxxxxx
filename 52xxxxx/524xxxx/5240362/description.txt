Somebody needs to sign these guys! They 
are by far the best metal band in Hawaii. 
I am stationed in Hawaii in the military
now. But when I leave here I still want to
be able to see them back in New York.

Best drum chops ever, guitar shreds, and
powerful vox. I would compare them to a
mix between Lamb of God and The Faceless.

They can do Black Dahlia Murder and other 
great covers and sound flawless.  I was
very impressed and grabbed this demo at
one their shows in Honolulu.

Best melodic death metal I ever heard.
Best live performance I seen in years.
Record labels need to swarm in on these
guys.

Anyone out there that can help them out? 
Please re-seed and re-upload this torrent
so BEFORE FIRE gets the exposure they 
deserve.
