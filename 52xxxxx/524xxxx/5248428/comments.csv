,blackestsheep,2012-04-27T20:48Z,"great torrent  totally legit
game installs and  works
IT IS  IN JAPANESE  ALL OF IT
game comes w arc file folder
use freearc  app  whiich is a free small file  similiar to winrar etc  to  extract that freearc file then make sure to keep  all those files together and install game to that same folder..the game installed fine for me
its all in japanese     so just about impossible  to understand but does work..does have  some english subtitles for the title screens though...it  has patches available as well i will comment later if they work

thanks for torrent "

,blackestsheep,2012-04-29T19:42Z,"patches  work  just  be careful  to follow instructions
menus  will be in english but some in game messages are still in foreign language but overall a great job  and very playable game                     "
,Sporakos,2012-05-26T20:37Z,"game runs fine but the sound is kinda strange.when i hit enemies with normal/charge attack i don't listen any sound effect.also i don't hear voice of peons or enemy officers when you hit them.its kinda boring like that.but the amazing graphics keep me on playing
do you know if there's any other english patch?he did a great job,but there are some Japanese that i don't understand a thing and i can't do some things that i want to"
