The CD file is packed with WinRAR, you should use one of the latest versions of WR to unpack it, as an older version can give problems. Here it opens properly and works fine after burning it. At least, try to recheck the download as maybe you got it corrupted in any way."

Extracted BootCare_CD then spotmau2010_onlybootCD and burned the Boot, EFI, EZBOOT, and SOURCES folders and BOOTMGR onto CD using Vista.

On my XP Machine, which keeps rebooting, it does not boot from this CD.

Any suggestions..like use another xp machine to do this?

Thx"

Watch out I'm sure there are more virus from within the whole folder..

,sawilson005,2011-01-06T11:23Z,"Ok, so I downloaded it and that went pretty quick. Some of the stuff works, some doesn't! THIS WILL NOT find any passwords for yahoo or gmail or hotmail that's been use on your computer. That was the main reason I needed it. Trying to find some lost passwords once used on my computer and this will not find any at all let alone any older ones. "
,T4,2011-01-15T17:55Z,"Best tool ever, i forgot my password in windows vista so i just unzip the bootcare_cd and inside the folder is a program called burncdcc.exe which it automatically burn the iso in a cd and then just boot it from cd."
