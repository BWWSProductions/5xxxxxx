Friday November 27th over 1,2 million Norwegians watched parts of â€œBergensbanenâ€ on NRK2. The longest documentary ever? At least the longest we have made, almost 7 1/2 hours, showing every minute of the scenic train ride between Bergen on the Norwegian west coast, crossing the mountains to the capital of Oslo.

Bergensbanen is 100 years in 2009, and the documentary was a wild idea from NRK staff that came through, and was a surprisingly big success.

This is the entire 7 hr and 14 minute train journey from Bergen to Oslo.
This film was created by NRK in conjunction with the BergensBanen centennial in 2009.

The original 22 GB HD MP4 version can be downloaded here:  http://nrkbeta.no/2009/12/18/bergensbanen-eng/

This 6.75 GB ISO file is a NTSC (720x480 @ 29.97 frames/sec) DVD version of the 7 hours and 14 minute long train ride movie. It can be burned to a dual layer DVD and watched on a standard NTSC North American TV set.
