Wikipedia - Jennifer Rush is the debut album by American singer Jennifer Rush. Based In Germany, Rush teamed up with producers Candy DeRouge and Gunther Mende and released the first two singles from this album; "Into My Dreams" and "Come Give Me Your Hand" in 1983. It was in 1984 however that she found her first success with the hit "25 Lovers". This was followed by "Ring of Ice" and then with the song she would become famous the world over for - "The Power of Love". In 1985 the song became a massive success and reached No.1 in the UK for five weeks, selling well over a million copies. It was at the time the biggest selling single ever by a female artist and is still one of the biggest selling singles ever. Success in her native US proved elusive however as the single was just a minor hit.
With this album having been released in Germany in 1984, it was repackaged and released internationally in late 1985. The album became a big seller, reaching No.7 in the UK and No.2 in Germany, remaining on the charts there for 99 weeks. "Ring of Ice" was chosen as the follow-up single, which also became a top 20 hit in the UK. Further hits proved harder to come by however as another UK release, "Madonna's Eyes" failed to reach the top 75.
