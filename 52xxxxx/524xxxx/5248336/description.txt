The subs in SecretMyths release are a bad/attempted fix of translated foreign subs and alot of it is not correct at all.

ALL english subs that are for navi parts are incorrect or fake unless they are these subs, these are the exact subs as they are in american theaters.

These are the actual PROPER english subtitles you would see.
If you went and watched this in an american theater, word for word.
Yay!
I went through hell making this (2.5 hours) so enjoy it :p.

These subs are sync'd for the SecretMyth/ViSiON releases.

1. the subs file has to be the same name as the video file
if your video is Avatar.avi Avatar.mp4 it would need to be Avatar.srt

2. just play your video in vlc or any other player and they should load automatically.
   
But you do need to have subtitles on in your player..

3. Turning subs on in VLC if their not automatically on..

3a. play your movie in VLC.
3b. right click screen, mouse over video>subtitles track>click track 1.


There is also a zip archive with the subs for Camelot/IMAGiNE ETC releases.
