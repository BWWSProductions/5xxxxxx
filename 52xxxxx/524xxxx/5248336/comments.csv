He used fake subs, at least if the used the ones according to his description, if he used ones with italics those were not mine and they weren't correct subs."

,bteljuice,2010-01-19T14:57Z,"Hello,

After I have downloaded the subtitles, Do I delete the SecretMyth subtitles and replace it with this?

There also a zipped folder with .SRT files. Do I move those as well to the subtitles folder?"
