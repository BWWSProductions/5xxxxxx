,Neuro_Belmont,2009-12-31T05:46Z,"Just don't ever connect your Xbox 360 to the internet again. That way you can never be banned. Besides, free games >>>> online."

,helpfuld,2010-01-04T16:07Z,"@fowlofthor

Try doing the update manualy. Download it from http://download.microsoft.com/download/D/1/8/D181EE58-DE70-4484-936B-0E9161CCD6B2/$SystemUpdate_Fall09_8955.zip

Extract it to a usb flash drive or CD/DVD. Insert into console. Turn console off, then back on again. Update should complete, then try game again."
,Shadow_Jedi,2010-01-04T16:20Z,"@ michan123: It seems that you have made it your self appointed job to run your yap to 'noobs' on a couple of torrent uploads... Your ""FUCK OFF FUCKIN NOOB..."" comment is also on the MW2 torrent. So,  is this your catch phrase that you use and plan on using on other torrent uploads? How bout you take a shit, cover it in chocolate, let it chill in the fridge, and suck on it you Fing douche! ;) 

@christian_sese: Not very Christian-like or you spreading hate around. The questions may not be the most thought out and researched but if it bothers you than just 'don't comment!' Constructive criticism will go a lot farther in helping the pirate community than just slamming people. Also, your comment about running XBox games on a PC... Actually you would be 'very' smart if you could get a 360 game to play on your PC. Reread your reply and smack yourself in the face for me please.

Everyone was a 'noob' once and the only way to exit this state is through education and 'positive criticism."" This isn't an instructional forum, however, possibly direct a 'noob' to a site that will educate them... Google is a great place to start and http://www.360mods.net will also teach you some nice tricks. All you haters should be ashamed! Now go for a walk, cool off, take in some deep breaths and some woo sa fa bas, and try to be civil. Good stuff. "
,goona4life,2010-01-04T17:00Z,"@shadow jedi. lmao! that told them... respect!!

No one came from the womb rocking a joystick or keyboard. It would be nice if the community could just get along and play nice... "

,Shadow_Jedi,2010-01-04T23:28Z,"@ raza78: I don't believe I was condoning this as a forum or help site at all; perhaps you should have read my earlier post dip shit. I was simply stating that intolerant pricks like yourself who only want to beat down new pirates are a disgrace to this site. Sure, if you don't do the research and ask uneducated questions than it can get quite aggravating. However, instead of being pricks how about just serve the community and direct 'noobs' to a site where they can look it up for themselves. I guess a lot of you just don't get it and your kind are just as bad for bashing the noobs and they are for asking ill-educated questions. Is it so much to answer a fucking question and if so than just shut your yaps and don't leave a wise remark. I'm tired of dealing with your dumb ass remarks and quite frankly its a waste of my time trying to defend 'new users.' Perhaps all you spreaders of hate were just not cradled enough as babies and never showed any love growing up. Now you have to seek revenge on these boards to make yourselves feel good about your repressed horrific upbringings. I spit on you and anyone else who is intolerant and doesn't want to extend an olive branch. You can all suck on shit flavored lolly pops cause I'm done."

,Powerfool,2010-04-06T04:28Z,"This is a good download. Been playing for days now. If having trouble with the wave, simply Google search ""360 waves patcher"" or watch the videos on you-tube for it. It allows you to convert the wave file of the ISO image to any wave you need regardless of your firm-ware. All this considering you do have a modded 360 lol. Also, if your still having issues, make sure to put in (rent a game) a later game (wave 4 etc.) that will also install the needed updates for your 360 in order to play those wave files... Good luck!"
