I'm not missing any chapters and had no trouble with the files, which I converted to read on an Ipod Touch."
,scottielass,2010-02-17T19:21Z,"For some odd reason, The Girl Who Played With Fire is missing the final chapter (31) -- only realised when I finished chapter 30 and it obviously wasn't the end of the book."
