Description : The Blu-Ray was recorded and filmed at the State Theatre in Minneapolis, MN before a sold-out audience as part of Vaiâ€™s successful â€œSound Theoriesâ€ world tour.
		Vai is widely known for both his unprecedented guitar playing techniques and the unique design of his signature series Ibanez Jem guitar. But his fans have become inextricably drawn to his melodic depth, and dynamic stage performance. The continued evolution of his craft is made apparent in the astonishing musicianship presented in Live In Minneapolis - Where The Wild Things Are. The 2 hour and 40 minute set contains several new tracks and re-orchestrated pieces culled from his rich catalog. Check out the trailer at: vai.com
		The addition of virtuoso violinists Alex DePue and Ann Marie Calhoun add a dazzling dimension to Vaiâ€™s compositions and stage show, delivering fans the unexpected edge they always expect. Other world-class musicians chosen for Vaiâ€™s band are: Bryan Beller (bass), Jeremy Colson (drums), Dave Weiner (guitar and sitar) and Zack Wiesinger (lap steel).
