When Tony Robinson first started presenting Time Team, he wouldn't have dreamed of doing something like this.

After a while he sold out to academics who enforce history as to academic convention whatever archeological proof exists to the contrary, that's obfuscated so the history books aren't proved wrong.

When he started he told things as they were, told truths then he changed and i can see the BS to what was really happening in the past in time team, it gets very close to truths and so is controlled.

Now this utter detritus!

Well Tony, i am disgusted.

As far as Knowism, or Knowetics as you called it....

Go develop some meditative ability, build sphers of knowledge in your minds eye and see where you can devine a path, you'd likely learn a lot even from that simple method.

The mind is a very powerful tool, but one must develop these things, culture spiritual energies as well as thought energy.

Plenty throughout history practice these things and still do today, all over the world.

Simply because others go around with minds closed doesn't mean those who can see farther than their own noses can't do so because they do.

I've nothing against Masons and i know a lot about these sorts of things because i'm a pagan mystic apart from anything else.

That programme was complete and utter trot!

How anybody could watch it and think Tony Robinson is correct is beyond me, among the facts is closed minded bollocks, that's all it is!

Shame on you Tony, you've lost my respect COMPLETELY with this trot!

WAKE UP MAN!!!"
,DeltaPan,2009-12-30T12:37Z,"I do realise he was presenting from written script draughted by others, so not his words or thoughts exactly.

But i am well disgusted with the man for helping to create a disinformation programme to try and keep people ignorant.

Haven't read/seen Dan Browns Lost Symbol yet and will likely laugh at some of that content, he is an author and uses artistic licence but this 'debunking' of mysticism etc is so closed minded and wrong it's profoundly annoying it's been created for mainstream TV when myself and so many like me are extremely pleased more and more people every year are 'waking up' after centuries of being dumbed down and turned away from nature by theocracy which compels them to worship an impotent deity, channel energies away from nature, this programme attemps to close peoples minds and spirits, the opposite.

Tony should try to argue that lot on WitchVox, see how far he gets, talk to pagans in England during his archeological digs, ask the druidics on his travels what they think of the content of this programme, don't think they will see it how that 'show' explains it, not at all!

I feel even the Dalai Lama would groan in disbelief at what's said in this rubbish 'entertainment' show, how closed minded it is.

,kludge420,2009-12-30T19:32Z,Dan Brown is a mediocre writer at best and this show is one among many that tries to make money off his shitty writing.
,ptv83,2009-12-31T00:09Z,"deltapan you're as looney as they come man... wtf.  i've seen people close to me get into third eye and budist crap.. they waist their lives and end up as bums with nowhere to live.

i tell you all religion is bullshit, and you're part of it.  you aint got no 3rd eye, there aint no ""energy"", there's just worms in the ground waiting for you in death so make the most of the time you got now, go get drunk, fuck all the chicks you can until your dick falls off, and most of all lose your whack-a-doo energy crap."
,blacklionlane,2009-12-31T11:06Z,"DeltaPan, that's better, short sweet and to the point. See how easy being grown up can be if you try."

I suppose you also think we don't even have a bio-electric field the same as every form of life.

With your spelling, obviously not just typo's, you're quite dim aren't you, i doubt you have that basic level of understanding.

But bio-electric fields are scientific Fact, not something to be debated, a loony idea, it's a fact, we all have energy which animates us.

Yet a century ago people suggesting such were laughed out of the scientific communities, as loonies,, now advancements have proved it to be there around everything living no matter how small.

Just the same as quantum particles, once it was thought the base material was the atom, now we know those atoms have quantum particles, the energies which animate us are just as complex and science is getting there, just as it did with the atom, once considered basic, now understood to be very complex with extradimensional facets in quantum association etc.

All proved in the last decade or so from theories built over nearly a century and more being learned and proven every year about atoms and sub atomic behaviours

Same as higher dimensions and phased dimensionality, now a known facts, but i doubt you'd even know where to find such facts, which universities, what departments, what to look for.

And i'm spiritual, not religious, distinct differences.

There's more to our existence than can simply be seen with our eyes, it's a shame more people don't realise that, but it's always the way, some are open, many are closed.

The world was once believed to be flat you know have you realised it's a sphere yet, lmao at ya.

I don't get annoyed when ignorami deride what i say, why would i.

I simply feel sad you people are blind to what nature and the universe  really are because your understanding is so limited and that is why you cannot understand what people like me come out with, so it's hardly a deficit in myself nor my problem, it's yours chap and those of similar limited intellects.

,DeltaPan,2009-12-31T12:18Z,"And is why i find such detritus as programmes such as this one as being most contemptible.

Because it's just plain wrong and dumbing people down.

Your reactions prove this to be the case.

Open your minds instead of going aroind with minds tightly shut.

There's a lot more to existence than what can be seen.

Peace. : )"
,blacklionlane,2010-01-01T13:29Z,"Delta, delta! There I was, thinking perhaps you had attained some degree of enlightenment and then - you blew it, man!
Oh, and your references to other peoples' spellings seem rather hypocritical. Look to your own rather odd spelling and disagreeable grammar."
