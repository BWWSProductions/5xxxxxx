Any help would be greatly appreciated."

,thomas930,2009-12-28T12:07Z,"I just got the same error with ""captauction"" after I had converted ""0925JVGB_2"" to ""0913FMFM_2""...

Also when I installed ""0925JVGB_1"", the following statement is added ""Coverages for Serial Number...""

So is that Jeppesen modified the installed programme?"

,captaind,2009-12-31T09:06Z,"It's great to see these show up.  I just wish there were more than just a few days from expiration.  I'd like to be able to use them, and be legal.  "

,aterbest,2009-12-31T20:45Z,You can still use 'em an be legal - just you have to verify the Amdt #s.  Lot more work but possible :)
,captaind,2010-01-01T02:20Z,"Thanks aterbest for the info.  I don't need to use them for a bunch of different airports, but I like them better than the government prints.  I'll have to look into what you said about verifying the amendment numbers."

,Lukaszsz,2010-01-13T18:46Z,Could someone tell me if all these updates overwrite old files and put new in the place? Or they just add new one and leave older versions. Wondering because of the space needed on HDD.
