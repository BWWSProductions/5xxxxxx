thanks!"
,Asehujiko,2009-12-31T18:55Z,Does this work with patch 174?
[V],Colombo-bt,2009-12-31T20:41Z,when there was a crack for the version 174 it works with that version. Now it's stable with 166 and works 100%
,twitchey94,2009-12-31T22:09Z,"I have everything good so far but I am stuck at step 8. 8. Take the content of the folder ""Multiplayer Online"" and paste it in ""C: \Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common"" overwriting the existing files . I am getting confused. copy and paste my multiplayer online to inside the common folder? then their will be 2 folders or will it go inside the zero gear folder?"
,twitchey94,2009-12-31T22:17Z,"WAIT please dont worry about that last comment i figured it out but now i get this error

,twitchey94,2009-12-31T22:58Z,I have looked their is no main folder at all. should i re download?
[V],Colombo-bt,2009-12-31T23:14Z,"no you don't have to re-download this torrent. the ""main"" folder is the call of duty mw2 folder. you have to find the ""main"" folder under ""C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2"" and copy it under the folder ""Server"". If you have a rip version o steam downloaded, it's same you have to find the main folder where you locate the game and copy it in the folder ""Server"""
,zerofive1,2010-01-01T02:49Z,"I am very confused on how we are supposed to launch this from Steam.

what should i do??"
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-01T12:29Z,"@Artak323 & mikulj: you have to copy all the COD MW2 files not only ""main"" folder

@zerofive1: you have to launch COD MW2 from Steam (right click on Zero Gear in steam, and run game, it launch COD MW2 and not Zero Gear)"

[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-02T13:22Z,"@reece988, piinmu, twitchey94, dever898
you have all the same problem, please read the comments above, this issue where solved many times.
1. First you have to install COD MW2 (Razor, SKIDROW), jump this step if you have a rip or steam downloaded version.
2. Follow the instructions in the txt
3. You have to copy all the COD MW2 files in the folder ""Server""
if you have installed the game you can find the COD MW2 files in c:\program files\activision\call of duty moder warfare 2
if you have a ripped version or a steam downloaded you have to go in the folder where you placed the game and copy all the files from there to ""Server"" folder

you have the error ""no iwd files in \main"" because you do not copy the COD MW2 files in the folder ""Server"" or you copy it partially

first copy all the COD MW2 files in ""Server"" folder (C: \Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\zero gear\Server)  than copy the folder ""zero gear"" (that you have downloaded from this torrent, it's under Multiplayer Online"") in the folder ""C: \Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common"" overwriting the existing files

if it give you again the error ""no iwd files in \main"" go in the folder where you have installed COD MW2, copy the folder called ""main"" and paste it in ""C: \Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\zero gear\Server

,Chrilleenn,2010-01-02T14:58Z,"I feel retarded to say that I get same problem as a lot of the people here. ""No IWD files found in /main"". I have gone through the stuff you mentioned, but my problem is the installing of MW2, where do i DO the actual installation.

@Chrilleenn you can do the installation where ever you want, commonly it's c:\program files\

that is not the point because the game run from the folder C: \Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\zero gear\Server because you have to copy all the game files in that folder. read carefully the instructions it's very easy, read many time if you don't understand, or read the comments above"
,Drebin891,2010-01-02T17:43Z,"i can't find the ""server"" folder he says that i should find it in C: \Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\zero gear\Server but when i open zero gear there is no server folder"

,Drebin891,2010-01-02T18:29Z,ok i've unistalled it now i'll try to install it again but before zero gear worked so it's possible that it was badly installed?
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-02T18:41Z,"I have no idea, if it's worked that means the folder ""Server"" exist. Retry all, if again the folder ""Server"" doesn't exist in ""C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\zero gear"" create it manually and copy all the COD MW2 files in that folder"

it's the same if i have a direct gameplay version of cod?"

now you can see the content of the game folder, and this is the folders of the game that you have to see:

you have to copy all this files in the folder ""C: \Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\zero gear\Server"" if it gave you again the error ""no iwd files in \main"" recopy again only the folder main"
,Drebin891,2010-01-02T19:12Z,"ok now i found the server folder and i did everything but when i play zero gear he says

 with the demo game there to be launched??

I got it to work yesterday, and it worked great, but I can't get it to work today for some reason. I think it is because it switches to automatic update everytime I hope the game...

Thanks!"

,Sonolin,2010-01-08T03:08Z,"Damn people have reported this as patched.

I just installed this game today, used this crack, and online WAS WORKING for about 30 minutes. I stopped playing, then came back on 30 minutes later and I just stall at the matchmaking screen.

It was good while it lasted guess I'll either have to buy the game, wait for another crack, or just play dragon age ^.^ (most likely the latter lol)"
