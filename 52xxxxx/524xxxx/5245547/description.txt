Designed for direct playback on Apple TV, PS3, WDTV, Xbox360, Popcorn Hour, VLC.

For WDTV Live change extension from .m4v to .mp4
You may also need to rename to .mp4 if you are playing off a USB drive on the PS3.  Should be fine if you are just streaming.

For Xbox360 use "Make Xbox 360 ok.cmd" batch file to make stereo only.

Popcorn will get stuck on the the DD track I believe.  Basically it won't let you loop through the audio (by pressing the audio button on remote) if it has a DD track.  If it only has AAC 2.0 and AAC 5.1 you can continually press the audio button to loop between the multiple tracks.  If it has a AAC 2.0, AAC 5.1 and DD it will play just the 5.1 AAC I believe, based on the info window.  File plays fine otherwise.  If for some mad reason you want to be able to loop the AAC 2.0 and AAC 5.1 then rebuild MP4 without the DD track.

(You must be on a PC running windows to use the batch files.  Just double click on the one you need and then do nothing until the black box goes away.  You will then have a brand new .MP4 file.  You can throw away the original .M4V or keep it, it doesn't matter.  You must use the newly created .MP4 file for your system.)
