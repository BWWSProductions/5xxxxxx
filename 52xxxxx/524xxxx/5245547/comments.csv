What is the resolution for this one. Kindly appreciated"
,Vossiej,2009-12-29T10:50Z,"Hi HR, I subtitled a iPod movie with your turorial. But I now have a problem I hope you can solve. When I play the movie in iTunes it shows the subs perfectly, but when I play the movie on my iPod I cant get my iPod to show the movie. I dont have a icon to display the subs on my iPod. There isn't this icon in iTunes to... I got both newest iTunes and newest FW. What do you think I did wrong?"
,Vossiej,2009-12-29T16:05Z,"Hi HR, when I watch the info of the movie, at media info it says: Language: ""Dutch"" - Type ""Text:tx3g"" - 1310 samples. In your description you say it should be Type ""sbtl:tx3g""   
Could this be the problem?"
,Vossiej,2009-12-29T16:40Z,"But then how do I get the text file to be sbtl?
I read your entire description of the torrent but I still can't solve my problem"

I've never had to do anything for any movie I've downloaded to get it to work on a Popcorn Hour."

,1COR1313,2010-01-02T01:34Z,"Great upload quality. works great on my Apple TV. 

Unfortunately this movie is ridiculously horrible. not only is it not funny, it's not very smart either. They could have done so much more with the premise. "
