Gabriel Pontello kidnaps Olinka to make her a call-girl. They fall for each other and she replaces his current girlfriend, Diana (XNK0485, but he still puts her to work in parties (orgies) he organises. There is a rival pimp, called Lucifer, however, and he breaks into the house, imprisons Gabriel and forces Olinka to have sex with him and Dominique Aveline. After putting her to work on the streets, he organises a smaller orgy, but when they are all flaked out Olinka knocks them out and rescues Gabriel.

There is a female client (Nicole Segaud) and a crooked cop who arrests street walkers (like Patricia Santos) and turns them over to Lucifer. The orgies/parties are excuses for Olinka's obligatory dances and various other females appear in them, like Cathy Menard and Olivia Flores, XNK0486 and XNK0487 in the first and Marianne Aubert in the second. The brunette in the second orgy may be XNK0460 or may be Olivia Flores.
