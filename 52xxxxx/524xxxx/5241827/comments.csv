,rei17,2010-06-19T23:58Z,"I'm halfway into the second season so far and everything looks perfect. The audio and video quality is really nice. Thanks so much, blaik2k4. 

And really people, would it hurt for you to just leave a god damn comment about the validation and quality of the file? You're getting it for bloody free-- it's the least you could do aside from actually seeding. "
