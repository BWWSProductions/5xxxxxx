,luke_da_painter,2010-01-08T19:38Z,is this suppost to be burned on a double layer? it keeps saying it wont fit on a single layer
,ImAGeek4Life,2010-01-09T00:33Z,"What I did mate is used WinRar now when using this it does open iso's just click the setup.exe, Not only does it saves you disk but it saves you time. I do however buying 8GB memory stick to put the iso on or any other iso on.  You can then later reinstall it with the iso on their. Another thing is that quality computera come with two hard drives. The C and D. C is for whats installed now and D is for backup use. So you really don't have to buy a USB Memory Stick. But if you do however perfer to burn it is recommended that you use ImgBurn. It is strictly made for .iso files. If this however still feels please conact me on the site or at imageek4life@live.com(eMail or IM.) I do have a cell out their but you must contact me on the site and I will give you the number. I do not text but I do have voice convo for better help. And I do have a girlish voice for some reason over the phone but in real life it is very manly ^.~"
