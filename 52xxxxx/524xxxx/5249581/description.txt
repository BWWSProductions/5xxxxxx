This is my ultimate collection of chillout/electronic music.

Since I'm interested in this kind of music, I've probably listened to more than a thousand songs from more than a hundred albums. What you have here are the 32 songs that in my mind are worth keeping.

All songs may not please everyone but I tried to vary the styles and I like them, especially while driving...

Enjoy !
