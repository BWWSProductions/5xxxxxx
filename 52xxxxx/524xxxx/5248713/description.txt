Courage in Red S01E13 - Customs and Excise

This 13 part series goes behind closed doors to reveal many aspects of the RCMP. These aspects include: protecting schools, cadet training, peacekeeping, ERT, remote policing, drug labs, youth policing, frontline policing, VIPs etc.


Episode Info: On any given night, if you are listening, you will hear gun-fire in Cornwall, Ontario. These are warning shots from brazen smugglers, telling the people of the community that they mean business. Everyone is fearful except for the RCMPs Sgt. Michael Harvey and his team. They're ready for these criminals and make a daily job of standing in their way.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion.
