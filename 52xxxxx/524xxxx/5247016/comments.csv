,r512,2009-12-31T11:29Z,"hi Fresch3000,

fullscreen doesn't work although its set in main menu. Game still runs in a window. Is there a fix?

I'm on snow leopard and don't have a widescreen monitor."
,fresch3000,2009-12-31T13:06Z,"Hmm..

It should work on 4:3 monitors.
Remember that the resolution ""1280x1024"", in the game, is infact ""1920x1280"".

The resolution is hacked, but the game still shows the old resolution.

Try applying a lower resolution.
Only the highest in the game is hacked for widescreen.

Try 800x600, apply, quit the game, and the relaunch :)"
