,rudy2011,2011-07-31T03:15Z,some with better download and upload speed start the download with the 'rarest piece first' strategy so that the availability remains 1 or close to 1. I'm downloading from past 1 week but the seeds come only for 3-4 hours a day.
,rudy2011,2011-07-31T03:18Z,someone with better download and upload speed should download the 'rarest piece first' strategy to keep the availability healthy.
