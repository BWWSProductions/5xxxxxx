,ioannisarc,2009-12-31T09:38Z,"Is it possible to try to crack or find a serial for a software called  devFus     versione 1.01a ?
The Homepage Link.. is http://www.devcad.com/ita/download.htm 
Its a FANTASTIC little program 12.9 MB for design fuselages for radiocontrol airplanes. The most amazing thing is that from the design the program can make the various sections and also the 3d fuselage and also the jig that support the fuselage during the construction.
I am sure that many persons out there are interesting regarding programs like this. You can use this program but without the possibility of saving or printing the results.
If you can make a crack it would be wonderfull because there are not free programs like that out there.
Best regards and happy new year.

did you uninstall  old anydvd first ??? and did you enable hidden files and folders ???and check for...anydvd.lic.....as well as......anydvd.chk "
,tonytgman,2010-01-06T19:48Z,I downloaded this torrent and tried to follow the guide but for some reason I still can't get this to work ! I'm running win.7 64 bit build 7600 and I can't seem to find out how to show the hidden folders . PLEASE HELP !!!!! Any help would be appreciated .....
,tonytgman,2010-01-06T21:38Z,"Never mind ! I did some research and got it all figured out . I first had to block the app. in my AVG firewall ( which I believe was my main problem ) and then follow the guide to a tee and behold, it works like a charm ! ! ! 
 Thanks aoloffline for the UL ! ! ! 

 P.S. Will you be coming up with more keys to further the amount of time for updates ? This one only updates until 5/22/2010 ....."
,Copurnicus,2010-01-24T00:03Z,"I Think i can help everyone with this .chk file. I noticed a lot of people keep saying they either
A) don't have or find the anydvd.chk file 
B) don't know how to enable view all files including hidden

if you are B) and have windows 7 this is how to enable it:
http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial151.html

Now, if you are A) and you can't find it this should do it. I noticed being a guy that rushes to get programs like this installed I dont' read the directions clear enough. If you notice what fredpc wrote for locating the file its in PROGRAM DATA. I know that the first million times i kept doing it like an idiot I would go C:Program Files/ and then into the anydvd folder but  you won't find it in there. 

First enable it so that you can see all hidden files and folders (using the link above if you don't know how) then go back to c: and there should be a folder called Program Data. from there go to the anydvd folder like you'd normally do and you SHOULD see the anydvd.chk. 

Now go ahead and rename it anydvd.bak and load anydvd again and it should work fine. 

Let me know if this helps"
,resantu,2010-01-28T20:25Z,"Nice Job Copurnicus! Thank you ;)

Important: If you have any problem just go to 

C \ Program Data \ SlySoft \ AnyDVD

And change the ext of anydvd.chlc to anydvd.bak"
