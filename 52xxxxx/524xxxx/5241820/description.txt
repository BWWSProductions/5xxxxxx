Microthrills: True stories from a life of small highs

Never one for derring-do, comedian and actress Spero is content to inhabit a "small world brimming with tiny thrills." Fittingly, this series of vignettes prompts many pleasant chuckles but few gut-busting guffaws. Sure, she has a quirky family: a petite, sex-therapist mother, who sports nine layers of shoulder pads and with whom Spero long shared a tiny apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side; an adoring grandfather, a dead-ringer for Albert Einstein, insistent upon videotaping her every dramatic inclination. Her habits are odd, too: as a child, she sniffed scented markers and removed her arm hair with Nair; as an adult, she continues a strangely intimate relationship with a sprawling collection of stuffed animals. Spero's juvenile tendencies carry over into her professional life as well: she regularly leaves Tootsie Roll residue on memos and sprinkles pink glitter on her boss' budget reports. This memoir doesn't reach the hilarious heights of David Sedaris, but it possesses a sweetness often lacking in today's comic fare. The book is inspired by a one-woman show of the same name. 

Wendy Spero is an award-winning comedian and actress, and author and performer of the acclaimed one-woman show Who's Your Daddy? She has been featured on NPR, Comedy Central, VH-1, and NBC, and in the New Yorker. She has written for Esquire and the New York Times.
