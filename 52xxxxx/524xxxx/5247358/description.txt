C4eva presents, in association with TeamJungle: LiteOn iXtreme v1.61 - Added support for waves 4 and 5
[/QUOTE]

There's no NFO with the release, but unlike yesterdays 'non-stealth' release I believe this release still has all stealth features but with modified checks to also allow/boot Wave 4 and Wave 5. However that doesn't mean it's safe to use on LIVE, it's NOT.
