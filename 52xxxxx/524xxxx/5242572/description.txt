'..this book has much to commend it and I know of no better book for the technician or graduate to learn about automotive electronics.... I am happy to admit that, despite 24 years in the automotive electronics industry, I have learnt many things from it that I did not know before.'

'The aim of the book is to show how the right diagnostic equipment will provide an accurate solution and repair.'
