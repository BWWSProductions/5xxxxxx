Make It Better is the third studio album by British dance-pop band Dubstar. It was released August 2000 on Food, and spawned two singles: "I (Friday Night)" and "The Self Same Thing". The single "I (Friday Night) was released in the UK on May 1st. 

Amazon.co.uk Review By Lucy O'Brien - Make It Better, Dubstar's third album, Newcastle masters of pop sound refreshed, lacing their sound with a new rhythmic drive. Steve Hillier (programming) and Chris Wilkie (guitar) create Saint Etienne-style beat pop, replete with lush harmonies and gentle electronica, while singer Sarah Blackwood (she of the double false eyelashes) sings pointed, perky lyrics about sex and the single girl. There's the optimistic Kirsty MacColl-ish single "I (Friday Night)", and the punky ode to low self-esteem "I'm Conscious Of Myself". It's not all pithy thoughts on romance, however. Dubstar even tackle communal suicide and mass destruction (phew!) on "Arc Of Fire" and astral travel on the intriguing, percussive track "Mercury". After a few years in the doldrums, this is a return to form.
