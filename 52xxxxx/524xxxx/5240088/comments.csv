""quite sexy for what it is, 18 May 2005
5/10
Author: LeonardPine from East Texas

Basically an updated sex version of 'Picture of Dorian Grey', this isn't bad, and has enough erotica to satisfy male and female viewers. The erotic scenes are imaginatively done which is more that can be said about most films of this type!

My fave scene is the strip club bit where the two female characters are watching a pole dancer and both becoming aroused. One puts her hand between the others legs out of sight under the table, and strokes her to ecstasy! Check it out!

There's also some good stuff involving hot wax, a blindfold, and black stockings that could get the pulse racing! Acting is variable, but no worse than any other film of this kind."""
