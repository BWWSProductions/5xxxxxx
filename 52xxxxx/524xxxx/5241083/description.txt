From Wiki:


Steve Hoffman is an audio engineer from Los Angeles, California, who specializes in remastering sound recordings on compact disc and vinyl record. In the 1980s, he worked at MCA for nine years. He has since done remastering work for companies such as Digital Compact Classics (DCC) and Audio Fidelity, Analogue Productions, Rural Rhythm and, presently, S&P.


In his early years Steve Hoffman worked in radio and earned a degree in mass communications from California State University, Northridge.[1] Later, he went to work for MCA where he would compile running orders for Greatest Hits albums. Disappointed about the quality of many early compilations, he made it a priority to seek out the original master tapes rather than later copies for the releases he was working on.[2]

The first CD Steve Hoffman remastered was "For The First Time Anywhere" by Buddy Holly, which consists of ten early undubbed recordings.

His approach to remastering is a minimalist one, often eschewing many common processing steps in order to present a true representation of the original master tapes. He attains this by avoiding compression, limiting, equalization and noise reduction
