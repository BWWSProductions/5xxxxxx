NOTE: THIS IS NOT A FAKE.
READ BELOW OR DOWNLOAD THE SAMPLE TO VERIFY THIS IS GENUINE.

This is TNA's 'Top ten Pay-Per-View matches of 2009', which will be broadcast as part of Spike TV's 4 hour special on December 31. While there is no episode of TNA in the US this week, this was aired in Australia on Foxtel on the 26th December, 5 days before before it will air in the US.

This is my personal encode, which I have decided to share with the XWT community. Enjoy.

Note: this encode uses the x264 codec (even though its in an avi container). Please make sure to download the sample file first to ensure it will play properly on your PC.
