This is my first torrent, so let me know if it's not working.

Found a working cracked copy of Paint Tool Sai and it works perfectly for me, Saves .sai and .psd files just fine as well as opening them. The trial version doesn't allow that. The first place I looked for this was on TPB of course, but since TPB didn't have it, I had to look harder. Now that I've found it, I'm just going to share the joy. ;) Happy 2010 everyone!
