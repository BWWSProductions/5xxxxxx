,GolemdX,2010-04-12T23:24Z,"Hi, I was wondering if there was originally an installer for this, and if there had to be a file patched? Can any of these files be used as a patch for the trial? Thanks."

My trial period just ended. Apparently I was on a trial period? No one informed me of this."
,Ciellemi,2010-12-27T10:19Z,Someone seed please~
,mossyhairundys,2011-01-07T07:28Z,"isnt there supposed to be a ""shortcut"" button provided? I always have to open up the file itself and click on the ""start-sai.exe"" ""link"". but anyways it works. extremely happy."
,sonoreo,2011-01-11T17:48Z,"WOW! NICE! I'm so satisfied with the result, honestly. I never thought something could download the way this did. I clicked on download, check bit torrent, paused all the other torrents, went back to browsing, looked at it 1 minute later and it was 100% finished. Holy shit man!"
,uking94,2011-02-25T20:08Z,"wow man, thanks for sharing, will seed forever"
,JamIsTasty,2011-02-25T22:45Z,"It downloaded really fast and then I decompressed with winrar, but when I click ""sai"" or ""start-sai"" I get a pop up of a blue window with a ton of gibberish letters, two fields to type in (like a username and password thing), and two buttons.
Did I do something wrong? Please help, I really want this!"
,doodlelover,2011-03-22T10:15Z,"Wonderful torrent, works perfectly! Thank you so much. :D

For anyone that's having trouble, simply click ""sai"" and it starts. You can pin that icon to your taskbar and it'll work the same. Re-download it if there's still problems."
,LouderPinDrop,2011-03-26T21:52Z,"This thing didn't work. Is it Vista? I love the program, but I tried to open it and it ""closed unexpectedly"". "
,itsemmachan,2011-04-21T00:09Z,"So easy, all I did was winrar it, then click start. Works perfectly. Thanks! "
,penguinvalentine,2011-04-22T06:47Z,"It seems to work, but then it doesn't work... I get an Unprotected exception message that reads:

(Someone tell me why ""document"" is misspelled?) Is this a virus?!?! D;"

,Chimbli,2012-04-16T17:31Z,"Scanned with Avast and Malwarebytes, both said it was clean."
,Goldendarkness,2012-05-10T20:54Z,"um, what am I suposed to open the file in? it asked me which programme I sould open it in and I don't know. can someone please tell me?"
,BleuMofo,2012-05-18T00:42Z,so im guessing that i just extract everything into a folder and run it from there? this application is probably the hardest to find.

,ziffel323,2012-07-21T21:13Z,"Agree w/others. MBAM says it's clean. The app is tiny, bullet fast, and pretty cool. "
