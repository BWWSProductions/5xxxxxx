                    Bolivia Special.                         
                    Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May  
                    are dropped deep in the Bolivian rainforest  
                    armed only with three 4x4s which they bought  
                    from the local small ads for a maximum of 3500  
                    pounds each. They attempt to drive from the  
                    heart of Bolivia to the coast of Chile,  
                    encountering drug lords and the debilitating  
                    effects of high altitude. But before that,  
                    they've got to escape from the deep centre of  
                    the rainforest in what is without doubt the  
                    toughest challenge Top Gear has ever faced.
