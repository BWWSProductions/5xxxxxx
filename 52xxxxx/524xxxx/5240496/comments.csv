[V],twentyforty,2009-12-25T20:23Z,"@htctouch: Red signal happens in two cases:
1st: when tracker server stops to work (it happens often) - but - it has nothing to do with me nor torrent and I can do a squat about. Just turn on DHT and DHT service will connect you to other downloaders who have DHT turned on.

2nd: when your provider (your connection) goes off-line. You can do nothing about, but eventually reset/restart your modem/router and/or reboot PC.

BTW... be sure to have enough hard-disk space."
