I personally prefer any works in the language they were originally made in (regardless of what language that is) with PROPER subtitles in one of the languages I can understand better than the original (preferably English)."
,AnimePurist,2010-12-09T00:18Z,"English dubbed Anime is HORRIBLE!!! they should not make it. You are better off taking Japanese for a year instead of having to sit through a dubbed series (that's what i did), either that, or stop being so lazy and just read.

All things aside not a bad torrent...

Please don't beleive that you're speaking for all english people when you say you prefer dubs. English dubs are, in general, terrible. IMO dubs are for kids that are not yet old enough to read, or not yet good enough readers to follow the subs. 


Also, thanks for the upload :)"
,Stinglock,2011-02-25T15:24Z,"@MiseryLovesCompany:
You don't seem to reaslise what you are asking for doesn't exist,  and you also dont seem to understand that non-english speaking countries can create animation and do so in their native language.

Wait another few months until funimation have finished working and re-release the 2nd series in english (sometime 2011).

Until then, stay away from anime unless the titles contains engdub, you will have alot less to watch and complain about."
,boberic,2011-03-27T10:23Z,"@everyone hating on dubs. To be honest. Dubs, in most cases aren't that great. But in other cases(i.e. Baccanno) you realy cant watch it any other way. you just dont get the authenticity from a sub that you would get from the dub of that anime. Also the general reasoning behind people liking dubs is.. ""if i wanted to read id buy the manga...."" and its true. I didnt buy a dvd/download a torrent to read it... and missout on half of whats happening on the screen. Thats like going to the air port just so you can walk a thousand miles to florida(or wherever). defeats the purpose. now ill agree some dubs are pretty bad(i.e. birdy the mighty:decode) i mean srsly...birdys voice was TERRIBLE in the dub, but it just makes life so much easier and lets you put your brain on sleep mode while you watch ^^.

anyway thats my 2 cents"
,ElmoKills22,2011-04-11T14:42Z,This is Subed Not Dubed for those who were confused
,bi0bear,2011-04-14T21:15Z,"well for all you arguing down there, it's not that we are lazy to read, just that some dubbed aren't always correct in translating and it's obvious, they say one word and a whole sentence appears or they say a whole half a minute phrase and only one word appears so atleast when it's dubbed every mouth movement has a word we understand to it. plus books were made for reading and videos were made for watching, just the way things were made if we wanted to read then we would get the manga, so lady, if your done trying to put us people down who are just trying to watch an awesome show i'd like to say greet upload on this awesome anime, if anyone could direct me to a dub that would be great by the way thanks"
