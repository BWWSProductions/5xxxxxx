                    Period drama. Defying his father, William finds  
                    a job with Captain Brown, working on the  
                    railway that is making its way into the heart  
                    of Cranford. Meanwhile, Harry disappears from  
                    school. The ladies have high expectations of  
                    the pending visit of Lady Glenmire, but all  
                    does not go to plan. As Peggy and William are  
                    separated, a surprise wedding causes a fracture  
                    in friendships and, when tragedy strikes, Miss  
                    Matty feels she is to blame and fears that  
                    Cranford will never recover.
