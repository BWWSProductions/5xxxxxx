Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide - While Free Peace Sweet isn't as consistently engaging as Homegrown, it is nevertheless filled with terrific little punk-pop songs, from "In A Room," "Jack the Lad" and "If You're Thinking of Me" to "Ain't No Longer Asking," "Prey for Drinking" and "Homegrown." Dodgy's style is beginning to sound a bit formulaic, but there's no denying that the band has an infectious, exciting sound that makes the similarities between their albums forgivable.
