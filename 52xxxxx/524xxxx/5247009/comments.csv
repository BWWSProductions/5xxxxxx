The windows version works fine, with the hacked Reg for widescreen support, but it doesnt work on Mac.

But Ill find a solution :)"

,Sundn,2009-12-30T14:43Z,"Thanks alot love this game :D Keep up the good work. Would be even more awesome  with widscreen, hop you get it to work ;)"
,mordici,2009-12-31T00:31Z,Okay so exactly what do I do to get the game to work on a mac? It loads on my computer but then goes to a black screen with a mouse arrow.
,mordici,2009-12-31T05:48Z,"I did some tweaking of my display settings and can now see the game intro and the main menu. However, the mouse pointer will not select items below a certain point on the game screens. This makes the game basically unplayable."
,fresch3000,2009-12-31T13:08Z,"mordici.

the mouse is often only a problem in the main menu.

Just move the mouse very fast to the upper corner of the main menu, and then slowly move it back into the menu, without hitting the borders.

then you should be able to select the thing on the menu you want, and start playing the game :)"

,meena,2010-01-09T01:24Z,"I cant even get the game menu on my screen, really want to play DK :("
,Stardestroyer,2010-01-10T16:47Z,"I cant get it to work properly either, at first I got to the menu but the mouse pointer went all weird. Now I only get to the first loading screen after the intro video but I cant see the menu. Tried to re-install but to no avail! Any ideas?"
,LJS88,2010-05-03T13:50Z,"fresch3000,

I was very pleased to see a Dungeon Keeper 2 version for Mac OS X but unfortunately it does not work!

I'm running the game on system Mac OS X 10.6.2. When I try to start up the game my video settings change to a non widescreen format and the mouse-icon changes to a cross and to a regular arrow (presumably arrows used in the game) but then the application quits.

Can you help me? It would be great if it worked!

Thx"
