Dungeon Keeper 2 for Mac - By Fresch 3000.

Dungeon Keeper 2 is a strategy game developed by Bullfrog Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1999.



Important Information.

When first Launched, the game window will seem small, as the game Menu, and the "Real" game, (Campaign, Skirmish), etc, doesnt share the same screen resolution.
So dont worry. The game will go full screen when the Campaign is launched :)

No support for Widescreen... YET!.
But im working on it :)


ENJOY!!
