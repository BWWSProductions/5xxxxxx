but this is a complicated little piece of software
not intuitive at all."
,856yt76,2010-01-14T19:20Z,"i changed my mind
this program is a piece of shit!
i just want to syncronize my files between two folders and not create file system listings with filters that override other filters and delete my files without warning. this is a piece of shit software.
thanks for the upload though..!"

I GoodSync daily and I find it very useful and efficient. It works perfectly to syncronize files between two folders. Thas what I use it for.

Maybe you shoud test and experiment with som test folders first to learn how it works.

It can sync folders in many different ways.
So is not a pice of shit software, maybe you should learn how it works first before you sync important folders. "
,dima-,2010-01-18T10:51Z,This actually works! Keygens for previous GoodSync torrents no longer activate. I can even install the latest update from GoodSync (8.1.2.5) over the supplied 7.6. Thanks a lot for the upload.
,fu_manchu,2010-01-21T19:52Z,Hmmz But will this keygen deal work with goodsync2go? cuz I need the 2go version for the flashdrive. :)
,the_one_one,2010-05-29T01:27Z,Good job.  Now looking forward to version 8.2.7.7 :)
,the_one_one,2010-05-29T02:58Z,It works fine on Win XP but fails to activate in Windows 7. 
,the_one_one,2010-05-29T19:13Z,"Correction.  Yes, it failed in my Windows 7 but...

-Uninstall failed version 7.6 using Revo Uninstall or similar.
-Reboot
-Install version 7.6 again.
-Select ""Activate On Line via Browser""
-Enter new name
-Enter any 10 digits, no spaces nor dashes.
-Run Keygen, copy code.
Done.
-Update to 8.1.0.5 or last version from server.
Say hurraaah!"
,budryerson,2010-07-12T18:06Z,"I know this sounds stupid, but the Keygen results will not \""cut\"" and \""paste\"" into the Activation window. I tried to copy by hand but I think the code is larger than what I see in the Keygen window. Does anyone have this problem or can anyone help me? Running WinXP-SP3. THX"
,Catalynn,2010-07-31T07:57Z,"Activation did not work for me. Just look for version 8.1.1.5 multi lang, and use the ""mesmerize"" keygen. After the activation just upgrade to whatever the latest version is. "
