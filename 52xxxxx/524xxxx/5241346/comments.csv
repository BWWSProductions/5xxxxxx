,Christian777,2009-12-29T16:31Z,"I have now installed the full version of klite codec pack, without result, no video only sound.

This movie is corrupted, do not download."
,Christian777,2009-12-31T11:52Z,No it doesen't. VLC is a player not a codec. If you use uregular codecs (codecs not included in klite codec pack you should warn people about it and tell us witch codec it is your using.
,Christian777,2009-12-31T11:57Z,"Hmm and since you don't know witch codec you have used I have to download the file again, from another source, waisting mine and others bandwidth.

Install klite codec pack, that will remove bad codecs and install all the once that you need."
