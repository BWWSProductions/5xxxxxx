,h.f.r.h,2009-12-29T21:19Z,"I migh be stupid or something, but it didn't work for me.."
,nz_witch,2009-12-30T05:43Z,"Check out the torrent description, I have added a link to the Riverview.world file. My apologies for including the wrong Riverview file."
,Snaitf,2009-12-30T18:02Z,"TYVM, exactly what I was looking for, worked perfectly!

For those interested, this includes ALL store content for base game and WA through December of '09"
,Blitzxo,2009-12-30T20:41Z,"Idk what i'm doing wrong here. I've got my game patched to WA 2.3. EA download manager is not installed. I've placed the DBC files into the appropriate folders, but I don't understand what it means by the 'framework' someone help please?"
,Blitzxo,2009-12-30T20:48Z,"Also, in the launcher, it shows the store content as installed, yet the items do not actually show up in the buy section in game. "
,Unknown_Exile,2009-12-31T03:16Z,"@Blitzxo: The framework is a basic hack that enables the use of hacks and other assorted mods. Its not difficult to install. If your having trouble finding it search google for the ""AWESOMEMOD!"". There should be a link to the Framework mod on the moreawesomethanyou site result."
,Insane_Whiteboy,2010-01-02T09:48Z,Worked flawlessly! Thanks!
,Stea1thy,2010-01-02T09:56Z,works fine thank you for upload :)
,coolestr,2010-01-10T16:45Z,Could you please update the DDCache store content pack? include jetset stuff & etc.
,nz_witch,2010-01-14T00:37Z,"I won't be uploading more torrents with this stuff. Demonoid has a torrent that includes the jetset packs, although neither of the torrents includes the January releases. Follow the links in the comments here to find several methods to add the latest content to your own .dbc files. "
