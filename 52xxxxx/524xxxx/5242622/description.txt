GREAT KING RAT

One of the best hardrock bands ever coming from Sweden (in the same category as Talisman, Shotgun Messiah, Electric Boys and Snakes In Paradise).

Out Of The Can is their second and last cd. Even though it is not as complete as their debut cd, this cd still is a goldmine for headbangers. Pontus Norgren promised, when the band split, to reform this group later (but it hasn't happend yet). And after listening to this group you will understand why he uttered those words. Great King Rat has a unique sound and all the individuals melt together in synergy to produce something outstanding!
