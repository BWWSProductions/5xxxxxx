This is episode #15 from the first season where Diana Rigg played the part of Emma Peel (season 4 - 1965).  It's in glorious, creepy, moody, suspenseful black and white.

This file was encoded from a DVD rip to mp4 using Nero Recode.  The file is in Nero Digital standard AVC, which is an mp4 file that is made with the H.264 codec.  The audio is 2 channel, high efficiency AAC, and 48 kHz.  The fields have been de-interlaced.  I tested the file, and it will definitely play on Nero Showtime, Quicktime, and Media Player Classic (theoretically, any player that supports .mp4).  To learn more, go to:

If you don't have Media Player Classic, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you click on the link below and install the K-Lite codec pack.  It will open up new worlds of video viewing for you.
