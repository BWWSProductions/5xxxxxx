Bon Jovi finally offers CROSS ROAD, a collection of their best songs plus two recent compositions and a new version of a classic. Fans and first-timers alike will delight in and sing along with this choice blend of hard pop and edgy anthems. 

"Someday ... Full DescriptionI'll Be Saturday Night" and "Always" continue the Bon Jovi tradition of gritty love songs and rock poetry. Jon Bon Jovi's coarse yet smoothe vocals reach out and paint images of characters caught in an American scenic painting, "gotta live my life like I ain't got nothin' but this roll of the dice" Jon Bon Jovi claims in one song. With "Prayer '94" the band offers a toned-down version of "Livin' On A Prayer" which through its subdued, semi-acoustic demeanor achieves an intensity not found in the original. 

CROSS ROAD reminds us why Bon Jovi is such a successful band. Solid songwriting, excellent production and a killer sound will keep this band on the charts. 

Producers include: Bruce Fairbairn, Bob Rock, Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, Lance Quinn
