,redhare,2009-12-28T07:46Z,"What a lousy thing to associate with Christmas -- that there is nothing to look forward to after death but black nothingness.

TOTALLY CONTRARY to Christmas and the GLAD TIDINGS that there is plenty to look forward to in the next life.

I guess that's why cgaurav007 titled it MERRY X-MAS to avoid anyone learning that CHRIST-mas is not a holiday for hordes waiting to enter the black nothingness but celebrating the BIRTHDAY of Jesus CHRIST which gives us hope.

As Gardner's character learns in the end, the movie's basic premise is flawed in concluding that speaking the truth means we have to say any hurtful and unloving thing that pops into our head.

At least LOVE triumphs in the end because GOD is LOVE, not THE MAN IN THE SKY."

,TheQw,2009-12-28T14:27Z,"Actually, archeological evidence shows that Jesus was born about half a dozen years before the Year 0, and most historians believe that he was born in summer time. Fact is Christmas was adopted from an already existing pagan holiday in order to facilitate more converts to the New Faith just like most other Christian holidays. You see, the night on the 24th of December was in many places in Europe the shortest day of the year, and carried religious significance for nature worshippers since that date symbolized the days of the year getting longer and longer again, with the promise of spring returning soon.

Besides, they just put it in the title to wish us a happy holiday, so stop bitching :P

,ninjamunk,2010-01-01T15:05Z,"i love ricky gervais. Watch and listen to everything he makes, but this truly sucks...

Really really bad movie. Its not because it mocks christianity (freedom of speech ftw), and its not that there are too few laughs in it; its just ridiculous.. 

Its like reading an essay or something like that, where the author clearly had an agenda from the beginning, and didnt bother adjusting the text when he realised it was bullshit.,

My main problem with this movie is this: Why the fuck do these 100% honest people, have to have an IQ of 60 or less!?
Why is it, that just because you can only speak truth, u have to say anything that springs to mind!?
I try to be an honest guy, but that doesnt mean I tell a date that her hair looks shitty. 

RICKY!!! Why does honesty go hand in hand with rudeness?
I dont know why I watched this movie to the end, cause it made me mad 10 minutes in to it.

I am a far right conservative, but I still got a laugh out of ""an inconvenient truth"". I still thought the beginning of this was funny but I soon realised the the point they were trying to make. No problem, I doubt many Christians that see this will continue to line rickys pockets. I for one will only download the office now(I will still let the guy entertain me- but I will no longer support him). Entertainers should entertain. If they want to be involved in politics and religion, they should do that and stop entertaining- If they are good at what they do(like the douche bag michael  moorer) then they will be successful. It was a good comedy. Ironic that 007 posted this on the day regarded a the birthday of Jesus. The people that say it sucks should say why they don't like the movie and not support the people involved rather than to say that this good comedy sucks. The message sucked, the movie was entertaining and quite funny. When ricky and his buddies are burning in hell, they will better understand.

message of his last romantic comedy, ghost town: look at me women out there, i want to settle down now, i'm funny but i'm not mean all the time, i can be sensitive and cute, sort of. 

message of this romantic comedy: just because you're a 10/10 hottie, it doesn't mean you can't settle down with me? you can love my mind, just look at what the female lead character in this movie did? 

who the fuck keeps making love comedies, produce them, write them, direct them and act in them, as the main protagonist always getting the girl and living happily ever after? this is starting to get pretty sick. someone throw this man a fleshlight.
