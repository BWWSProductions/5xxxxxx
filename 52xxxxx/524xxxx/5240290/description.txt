"The Loco-Motion" is a 1962 popular music song written by American songwriters Gerry Goffin and Carole King. The song is notable for appearing the American Top 5 three times â€“ each time in a different decade: for Little Eva during 1962 (U.S. #1); for Grand Funk Railroad in 1974 (U.S. #1); and for Kylie Minogue in 1988 (U.S. #3).

The song is a popular and enduring example of the dance-song genre: much of the lyrics are devoted to a description of the dance itself, usually done as a type of line dance.

"The Loco-Motion" is ranked #350 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of "the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time".

A cover version of "The Loco-Motion" was the debut single by Australian popular music singer Kylie Minogue.

After an impromptu performance of the song at an Australian rules football charity event with the cast of the Australian soap opera Neighbours, Minogue was signed a record deal by Mushroom Records to release the song as a single. The single was released on July 28, 1987 in Australia, Sweden and Italy under the title "Locomotion". The song was a success in Australia, reaching number one and remaining there for seven weeks. The success of the song in her home country resulted in her signing a record deal with PWL Records in London and to working with the successful team Stock Aitken & Waterman, who had produced the single.

During 1988 a re-recorded and remixed version of the song was released worldwide with the title "The Loco-Motion". This release again was a major success, reaching the top five in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. Minogue's version of the track appeared in the 1988 film Arthur 2: On The Rocks, starring Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli.
