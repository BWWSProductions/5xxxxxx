In 20 years of competing, coaching and working with performers from various fields, Iâ€™ve discovered most amateurs suffer from mild to severe delusion in relation to their efforts and competencies. In other words, most people delude themselves into thinking they are working harder then they are, and that they are more competent than they actually are. Of the five major levels of conscious awareness, (poverty, working, middle, upper, and world) my experience has been that performers at the middle-class levels of consciousness suffer the grandest delusions. The poverty level is barely surviving and living in a very harsh set of circumstances. The working class is punching a mental time clock and counting the days until retirement. Theyâ€™re usually not expecting much, and no one around them expects much, either. They are typically not concerned about climbing any higher.
Itâ€™s the middle class that is most incongruent with reality. They are operating at a high enough level to understand that higher levels exist. Although they donâ€™t expect to get there, the thought crosses their minds from time to time. Because of their low expectations, their actions are incongruent with their desires. In other words, they want to live the life of the world class, but are unwilling to pay the price. Since this reality is too harsh to bear, they delude themselves into thinking they are doing everything in their power to get ahead. Of course, theyâ€™re not. Theyâ€™ll tell you theyâ€™re putting in far more time than they are. Theyâ€™ll swear they are thinking about their vision all the time, but theyâ€™re not. The world class is brutally honest with themselves, and they tend to look reality in the face. They err on the side of over-practicing and over-preparing. Champions know that, to ascend to the top, you must first be operating from a mindset of objective reality. Self-deception and delusion have no place in the professional performerâ€™s consciousness.
