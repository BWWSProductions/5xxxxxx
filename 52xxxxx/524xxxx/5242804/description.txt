Legendary rocknroll Lp from -74 that soldout in no time. Made this rip from my own record and throwed in a bunch of more obscure rockinÂ´ horrortunes to fill out an whole cd.

There are two different frontcovers in this torrent if you only wish to have it the way it came or with the whole lot. Your choice.
Just mark ( in utorrent ) the first 12 tunes which are from the Lp.

And please comment what you think of this one. I will seed until I see that it is going by itself, then itÂ´s up to you. ( If it donÂ´t show that IÂ´m not seeding thatÂ´s just because of mine ip blocker. )
 
Rock on!
