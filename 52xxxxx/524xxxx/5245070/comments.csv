The wiikey 2 update allowed me to play super mario bros wii game but not this game. After softmodding the wii using this tutorial I got it to work. Be careful in following the instructions:

At first I could not get it to install bootmii but after I got another sd card it worked."

,timothycharran,2010-02-25T06:08Z,I have the wiikwy modchip aswell...have burnt this game with imgburn 2x a couple times...even tried using Wiizle Diizle Shiizle to patch it and no luck...has anyone else had similar problems?
,timothycharran,2010-02-25T06:08Z,NTSC console and not working
,boardermiko,2010-04-09T01:47Z,This is PAL
,kayez,2010-05-04T04:25Z,"This game is kick-ass fun.  Anyway, yes it is PAL version but that is no prob.  I extracted ISO used ImgBurn to write to a DVDR and it worked.  All I had to do was force NTSC 480i in neogamma under Region Options.  My screen would only show in black and white and when I changed it to force video NTSC it worked perfectly.  Thanks for this.  A+++  Game 10/10"
,silvoren,2010-12-29T16:27Z,This is not USA NTSC it is PAL
,cristianoy,2011-01-16T13:27Z,Yes. This is PAL.
,vinnylima,2011-03-10T02:32Z,"If it is MULTI5, then it's obviously PAL.
Works perfectly on my NTSC-U console w/ Wiikey 2 (running through Disc Channel)"
,upstreamftw,2011-05-27T00:29Z,When you put USA in the title its understood that its NTSC not fucking PAL format thanks for wasting my time and others u fucking clown.
