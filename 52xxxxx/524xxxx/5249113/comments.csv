,The_BLaCK_ReDNeCK,2009-12-31T12:32Z,wait what?? i just refreshed TPB search and this came up... almost 11 minutes ago and >>all
,The_BLaCK_ReDNeCK,2009-12-31T12:34Z,"you mean all the KIS keys are blacklisted? correct me if i'm wrong please

i also read somewhere that the auto-update is what catches pirated keys. turn off auto-update and update manually every 2 weeks just about. keys shouldnt get caught that way. Pass the word n try it out
