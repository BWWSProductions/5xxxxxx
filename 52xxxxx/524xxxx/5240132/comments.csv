YOU SEED! 

There is only 25.5% of the file actually out there. Just leave your comp seeding until the availability is greater than 1.0

If you don't finish the initial seed, this torrent will die and no one will be able to upload it."

,bluecar5556,2010-07-01T20:20Z,"0 seeders as of 07-01-10, if anyone needs Halo 3 - The Official Guide, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5117787/Halo_3___The_Official_Guide_Hi-Res_214_Pages_pdf"
,GLMC,2010-12-18T11:55Z,@bluecar5556 - do not advertise on my torrent pages that link isnt even to a ODST guide it is to the original Halo 3 Guide
,bluecar5556,2010-12-30T05:05Z,"     @GLMC, the uploader of this torrent, I never stated the link to my torrent (Halo 3 guide) was O.D.S.T. but to the contrary, the title of this torrent is, ""HALO_3_ODST_OFFICIAL GUIDE_HISPEED_GLMC.""
     As far as im concerned, not only are you incorrectly advertising this is HALO_3_ODST but you have the audacity to flame me for helping out the community, such as yourself :sigh, merely making available Halo 3 - The Official Strategy Guide when yours was unavailable on 07-01-10.  Sorry for the inconvenience that I may have caused you sir and in response the Halo 3 guide was removed.

,GLMC,2011-01-31T11:22Z,You didnt have to remove it i just dont like people advertising on my pages
