***The DVD is not the best quality. This is a made for TV movie from 20+ years
ago and it is not as sharp as newer movies. It is totally watchable but the DVD rip reflects the original DVD quality.***

Please comment. I rarely get feedback. :D

Even today, Henry Ford remains undoubtedly one of America's finest ever
entrepreneurs. Much more than just a canny businessman, this movie uncovers 
the true genius of the working class man as he overcomes devastating adversity 
and his many personal demons.

Battling to repair a fragile relationship with his son, Ford found solitude in 
the idea of reincarnation. Becoming more and more egotistical Ford shut out all 
who loved him as he sought inner peace. Only a tragedy of epic proportions 
could save him from spiraling into despair and isolation. This eye-opening 
story will leave you with a new found appreciation and perspective for a man 
who revolutionized transportation forever...
