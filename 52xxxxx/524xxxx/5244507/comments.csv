[M],vicerock,2009-12-28T01:51Z,"WARNING
Do not go to any of these so called free on line movie websites as they ask you to fill out a questionair so they can get as much info about you so they can use you,re identity to get things on you,re name its called identity theft some are virus links when you press them you infect you,re pc and most are like i said after you,re id so they can rip you off they are hopeing that you are so desperate to watch these movies that you will tell them everything like i said there is no survey with them just after identity and sometimes you,re credit card details dont be fooled people do not go to any of these websites none of them are legit they are just there to scam you. better to download these movies of a uploader you know and trust look out for one with a skull by his name click on his name check out his profile or just dl of one you know so you know you are going to get wot you,re downloading"
,neil_diamond ,2009-12-28T04:55Z,"I couldn't agree more with Vicerock. This one clown ^ spams hundreds of these with a thumbs up rating and then turns around and says..However you could have watched it here..with his VENUS FLYTRAP link. If it's so great...WTF is he downloading everybody else stuff??? Answer: He's not, he's just trying to get you to go to his! You fill out the forms and watch your mailbox fill with personalized emails.

Skulls, skulls skulls people! And even some skulls aren't good. Best rule of thumb..sounds too good to be true..IT IS!"
,hoevenj,2009-12-28T18:14Z,bull shit this film is the best there is for downloading good quality good sound and no spam 
,Jester453,2009-12-28T20:27Z,"Thanks TVTeam Keep Up The Good Work
Eng Subtiltles.
German Writing Has Been removed so no hardcored subs.
This is brighter than vision A8/V8 Good Cam"
,koopa2006,2009-12-29T05:20Z,is the sub language in English
,Jester453,2010-01-01T16:35Z,"@koopa 2006 
Yes the subs are in english

The difference between this and visions 720p is
vision 720p has more of a blue finish and
DEVISE has more of a green finish. Devise also has english subs and vision 720p does not.

Thanks again TvTeam"
