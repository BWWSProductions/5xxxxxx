,makyura,2010-04-08T06:06Z,to play this file correctly you need an DTS-HD audio decoder the sample rate is at 192 KHz (amazing!!) for PC i recommend CyberLink PowerDVD 10 for Mac i have no idea which player you can use unless you find a third party app for VLC or QuickTime
,pirate_9,2011-04-18T21:14Z,yes is DTS-HD and you can take simple DTS with tsMuxerGUI
,pirate_9,2011-04-20T01:26Z,sound is 48 KHz not 192
