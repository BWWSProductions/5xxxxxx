I had 6 % and 3.7 Ratio after 6 Hours then I deleted it and went for 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4467224/Cast.Away.2000.720p.BluRay.x264-ESiR

Fast(downloaded it in 4 Hours) and ESIR quality you can always trust.

I think I will avoid in the future to mux in the Italian Audio in my torrents since always those torrents are full of vampires who expect you to seed but download peanuts from them. No offense, just facts."
