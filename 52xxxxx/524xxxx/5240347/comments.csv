You need to unlock the songs in the career mode before they will be available in quickplay"
,tejagamer,2011-05-23T16:47Z,Downloading now... Hope this is in English and it works
,Sinister.,2011-09-17T12:41Z,"Thanks! It works!
The installation was so easy.
All you have to do is mount the "".iso"", and it does everything for you.
No need to move the files and all that crap.
I highly recommend this torrent.

As for nikob's comment: You're probably not ""strumming"". Strum keys are your up and down arrow keys. You have to press those every time you hit a note."

,SchizoWombat,2011-12-01T03:39Z,"when i go to play, the notes don't show up on the fretboard - has anyone else had this problem and know what to do about it?

@rmolin88 - there's a directx folder on the iso, use this to install directx 9 and you shouldn't have that problem anymore"
