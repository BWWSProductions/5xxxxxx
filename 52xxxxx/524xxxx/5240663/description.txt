Original Stylin is a pure gem, and EST is defintely top 5 in Hip Hop's most underated MC of all time category in my opinion. 3 Times Dope inspired so many up and coming artists out of Philly during the late 80's and early 90's. The Hilltop Hustler click was one of hip hop's most underated clicks as well, with guys like Cool C, Steady B, and Schooly D. Schooly D is probably Philly's most influential MC. But when it comes to being slept on EST aka The Greatest Man Alive takes the cake. Listen to EST's wordplay, delievery, and wit throughout the LP. Original Stylin was recorded in 88. EST is a pioneer that never got his due props. My man was way ahead of his time. I'm originaly from Philly,,,but this record inspired cats worldwide....just to be honest and be yourself. They were one of the only groups out of Philly at the time that truly represented the city's style, slang, and overall demeanor. DJ Woody Wood kills it on here too...especially when he cuts up the old MLK and Malcolm X quotes...long before Primo thought about it.This is truly an underated Hip Hop Classic. If you're a true hip-hop afficianado you must own this. If you're a hip hop head from Philly you must have this in your collection. sadly it was never re-released and is out of print. Search thru your local used CD store bin...maybe you'll be lucky. Because The lowest prices that you'll find on line for this gem is about $50.00 or more.
