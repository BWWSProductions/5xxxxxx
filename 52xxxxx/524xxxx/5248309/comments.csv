,dirtyleechingpirate,2009-12-31T19:34Z,"love Secret Myths' work. It'll be great to have english subtitles though. Thanks!
ps. Please Seed!"
,.Leto.,2010-01-01T12:43Z,"not worth the download if you already have the SecretMyth release : 
- despite your tweakings I can't see any difference in quality, picture isn't sharp enough for that
- the subs were correctly shown in italics (it's a problem on your side, nothing's wrong with SecretMyth subs) so nothing had to be corrected"
,XavHalo,2010-01-01T13:16Z,"Subs in SecretMyths release
ARE NOT THE CORRECT SUBS
They are a bad/attempted fix of translated foreign subs and alot of it is not correct at all.

Use my subs they are a word for word exact copy of subs from an AMERICAN theater.

,j1masta,2010-01-02T05:06Z,hey how come itunes is saying it wont play on my 120gb ipod? i thought that mp4 is the right format to play videos on. can anyone help? thanks
,ENCode001,2010-01-02T23:53Z,"You should check the maximum display resolution both audio/video and see if your ipod is capable of playing it. simply being an .mp4 doesn't garauntee it will play. it just means the play has the correct codec to play it. the device itself might not have suitable hardware, or may have ristrictions. 

just a thought. i've had to configure .mp4 down from original to 320x240 to be able to play ony my phone "
