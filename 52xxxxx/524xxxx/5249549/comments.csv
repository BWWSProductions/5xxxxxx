copy/paste from imdb:
The GEEKS VERSION of Avatar !
Author: guestar57 from United States

Starring:Antonio Sabato Jr.,Traci Lords and Matt Lasky. Written and Directed by: Mark Atkins "" First moments reminded me of how I felt when watching 'Star Wars' for first time !"" We liked this movie takes you away from everyday issues and into a wild ride with Creatures,Monsters, Traci Lords(For the male geeks) and Antonio Sabato Jr.(For female fans of reality shows). Great costumes and make-ups thanks to Tom Devlin and Gregory Paul Smith. You know if you squint Mark Atkins kind of resembles James Cameron,LOL ! The evil is present in an almost 'Jabba The Hut' and a guy right out of the 'Indiana Jones' school of villains . Really good piece of adventure and escapist fun brought to film ! "

,ashamael,2010-01-09T02:40Z,"OK, quality is perfect, that's no prob. 

It's just that the movie is total crap. I'd give it a prize for the worst novel adaptation ever achieved!!! I'd really do that!

OMG I'm soooo happy I torrented it! paying for that would make me a total idiot!"
,ashamael,2010-01-09T02:44Z,"Oh yeah, and the ude, who compared it to Avatar most probably was it's producer :DDDDDDDDDDDDD"
,ashamael,2010-01-09T03:02Z,"I just wrote full review for Rotten Tomatoes, so I'll post it her:

I've seen alot of really bad adaptations... I damn really did.. actually my wife hates me for that, since it is quite usual, that she watches the movie, which is an adapation of a book she's never read, and hates me bitchin' about how it is wondering off the plot of a book... well now, that's one thing... Totally another thing is THAT movie!!! It actually has nothing to do with a plot of a book! I mean gimme a break, we all know Asylum makes mockbusters. But that is the beaty of this in a way! I mean who'd restricted them to stay with a damn plot even having a low budget? Who the hell needed all the US marine vs Afghani stuff? Goo lord, how in Barsoom we could even explain that John Carter is the greatest swrordsman in two worlds, if he's trained nowadays? I mean do they train spec. forces in fencing? This is pathetic... Ah well, it's not that there was any sword fight in a mivie anyway... Just two dues who rivaled in how they cannot hold the sword properly (I have been fencing for 4 years, I know what I'm talking about)...

And the the princess... well guess what... She's over 40... I mean the whole movie I was trying to convince myself that she was hot... but I definitely had too few beers!

It's sooooo damn sad! I really hope ""John Carter of Mars"" will heal my wounds in 2012!"

Imagine what they would have done to Carson of Venus....
Where's Doug McClure when you need him? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha "
