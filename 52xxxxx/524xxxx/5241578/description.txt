[*] RE-BROADCAST ALERT [*]


The show broadcast today, December 25th, appears to be an intact repeat of the one that aired Monday, December 21st.


The description on the Infowars web site is as follows:

"In this encore Christmas presentation, Alex talks with James Delingpole, British journalist, commentator and novelist. Delingpole is the author of How to be Right: The Essential Guide to Making Lefty Liberals History, and Welcome to Obamaland: I Have Seen Your Future and It Doesn't Work. He writes for The Times, The Daily Telegraph, and has a blog where he criticizes the man-made global warming theory. 

The remainder of the show is caller content. 

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays from Alex Jones and the Infowars crew."



Prison Planet describes it thusly:

"Alex talks with James Delingpole, a British journalist and novelist. Delingpole has published numerous blogs at The Daily Telegraph questioning climate change and commenting on the Copenhagen summit that concluded last week. . 

Alex also talks with Michael Braverman, the producer of Jesse Ventura's Conspiracy Theory, on the next eposide of the popular show."




The December 21st show torrent is still seeded:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
