,Dexterstjock,2009-12-31T13:18Z,"Two things:
Will you idiots get your naming structure right FFS!  BDRiP means it came from a blue-ray vs TeleSync means it was recorded from a projected video.  

We REALLY don't need the OP to add a comment on the ""quality"" of what he uploaded, especially when a 9.5 / 10 would only be for something that is a DVDRip or something of the like, not a crappy TS.

I'd say don't download this or any other ""BDRIP / DVDRIP - Telesync's"" so uploaders can learn the naming structure and meanings and allow us to sort through uploads properly."
