Indie 69 Jan 2010.

No matter how many times I try it, image tag will not work, so I give up.
(sad, it's a beautiful cover this month)

It took nearly magic to just get this torrent up here just because I mailed it
out to a few people early. As a result, TPB kept rejecting it saying it was already in the system. It probably was, just not anywhere it could be FOUND.

Oh well. Petty complaints, really.

Have a happy new year and enjoy the selection of new music this month.

See you in Feb for the one year anniversary of Indie69 playlist torrents.

A year already. wow.

For the list of files this month, look up a bit to the left. See where it says 
"files:" ? Click on the number "75" directly to the right. That will show you all the files/songs for this month.
