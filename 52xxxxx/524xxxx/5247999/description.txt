A supernatural force brings together 2 lost souls united by their love of literature who after a sinister twist of fate are diagnosed with terminal cancer and the pair are sent to an experimental drug-testing facility run by a creepy Doctor (Flight Of The ConchordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bret McKenzie). When the facility is locked down for the weekend and the drugs begin to take effect, the human guinea pigs begin to experience ominous hallucinations pointing to a horrific murder. Unsure of where reality stops and the drugs have taken hold, the apparitions become more threatening and the only way to leave the facility alive is to discover the truth about the haunting dark secret.
