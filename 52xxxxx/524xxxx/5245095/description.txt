Eric Hutchinson - Sounds Like This  2008 

Hutchinson has been widely acclaimed for his prowess as a pianist, songwriter, and performer.[1] He has been called "one of the most talented singer-songwriters that Boston has to offer," with comparisons to Pete Francis, Jason Mraz, Stevie Wonder, Ben Folds, Cat Stevens, Ryan Montbleau, Billy Joel, Squeeze, Neil Finn, and even The Beatles.[6][7][8][9][10] Journalist James Campion calls Hutchinson "a major talent with nary a trace of pretension" and "a sure thing."[11]

Hutchinson placed second at the 2002 Los Angeles Songwriter's Grand Slam.[12]

[edit] Style
Hutchinson's music walks a line between rock, folk pop, and powerpop. It has been called "intelligent pop" with "painstakingly placed lyrics, brimming with sarcasm and wit",[13] and "sunshine pop" with "feel-good playfulness" and a "plucky demeanor".[14] Hutchinson cites his influences as Stevie Wonder, The Beatles, Michael Jackson, Elvis Costello, Paul Simon, Prince, Billy Joel, Ben Folds Five, and G. Love & Special Sauce.[15]
