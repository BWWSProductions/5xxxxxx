After searching for this patch for a LONG time, I finally found it, and decided to upload it so it will be downloadable for a longer time than 30 days. (Stupid share sites.)
This patch makes it possible to save games on Windows XP again when playing The Neverhood.
Instructions are found within.
Enjoy! ;)

P.S: I won't seed this over night, so If some people could seed it as well, I would be grateful. ;)
Look out for more patches for older games from me!

Another P.S: If you have downloaded this torrent, but there are no seeds, just leave the torrent on, since I'm not seeding 24/7. I try to seed every day, so no worry's. ;)
