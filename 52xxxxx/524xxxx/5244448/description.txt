The Hotel Riviera by Elizabeth Adler (2003)

Lola's dream has come true. She is running a hotel on the French Riviera with her charming French husband, Patrick. When he disappears her life is turned upside down and it becomes clear that several unsavoury characters are chasing him for money and even the hotel isn't hers.
