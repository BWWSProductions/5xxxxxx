Hey, guys!

There was a bit of a problem uploading the updated discography on The Pirate Bay. I made many attempts, changed a bunch of stuff, but it still wouldn't upload. So I had to upload the new albums and the updated ReadMe file separately. We'll see if this issue is temporary, and if it is, I might upload another updated discography in its full form someday (maybe), and if not, I can probably still upload it in separate parts. Until then, the discography can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5062834/Ian_Boddy_-_Discography_%2880__Complete%29

For some reason, it's still there (as of this writing), even though I attempted to remove it. If some mod removed it, don't worry, it still must be on the internet somewhere. Also, as of this writing, it is seems to be without any seeders. Not to worry, though, since I still have the entire thing that I uploaded, I can still seed most of it. I just modified a few things, and I have some other unmodified stuff that I can't seed for some reason. And as I said, expect another update sometime in the future (at least I hope there will be one).
