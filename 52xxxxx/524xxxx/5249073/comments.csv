,lostmachine,2010-01-02T13:00Z,"this dvd copy has some problems... the film pauses every 10 minutes and then skips forward when it begins to play again. VLC opened the dvd but other media players did not work. I do not think this dvd will burn to disc and playback correctly and pretty sure it is not even worth a try considering the missing data (or whatever those pauses are) 

maybe the rippers machine was too slow to rip this properly, instead they seem to be more concerned with someone stealing their name instead of buying or building a good computer...

pfft ! "

,beatbox_89,2010-02-19T23:34Z,"I agree with lostmachine, the movie does not work properly. For me, it was unwatchable, since parts of the plot was simply omitted when the movie skips forward every ten minutes. "
