Fast download (keep seeding guys) and video and audio quality are nice as well. 
All the info you need about the torrent is provided by Ch4cal, no no additional languages and such."

,riotango,2010-03-09T09:10Z,"WARNING!!! I got a DMCA letter from Mark Ishikawa
CEO, BayTSP inc.
c/o NBC Universal Anti-Piracy Technical Operations on this file. I'm on their radar and it wasn't even me. Ruined my whole day. Torrents are too easy-- for them, it seems. Think twice."

The sound was impossible to hear, but the video played great. I even had all of my volume settings turned all the way up!"
