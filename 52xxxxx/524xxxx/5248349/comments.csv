Last 5-10 minutes goes all blocky with NES like pixelation. VLC detects no errors and cannot fix it and the rest of the episode is fine. Hard to see blurry faces and pixel crashed letters. Sound is still unchanged through the bad video quality part."
,Vik6699,2010-03-16T20:16Z,Hope it good quality Please seed otherwise it will be 10 week till i get it :(
