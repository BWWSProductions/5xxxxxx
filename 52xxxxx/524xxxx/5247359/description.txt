The Incident is Porcupine Treeâ€™s tenth studio album and like â€˜Fear Of A Blank Planetâ€™ â€“ which was an elaborate conceptual piece fuelled by a 21st century cocktail of MTV, sex, prescription drugs, video games, the internet, terminal boredom and subsequent escape â€“ it takes the listener on a thrilling audio journey. In turns haunting, desolate, hypnotic and euphoric, its centre-piece is the title track â€“ a stunning 55-minute musical statement that breaks down into 14 separate and often diverse (though interlinked) vignettes. 

The tale begins slowly with â€˜Occamâ€™s Razorâ€™, gaining momentum and intensity with â€˜The Blind House,â€™ â€˜Drawing The Lineâ€™, and â€˜The Incidentâ€™ itself, though the groupâ€™s masterful manipulation of sounds and textures is never overlooked. The mellowness of â€˜The Yellow Windows Of The Evening Train,â€™ for instance, is accompanied by the gentle crackle of a needle on vinyl â€“ for all his skill as a producer and remixer, Wilson is a staunch supporter of the â€˜oldâ€™ ways of listening to music. Incorporating both of these styles, â€˜Octane Twistedâ€™ somehow batters and seduces simultaneously, while â€˜I Drive The Hearse,â€™ further sweetened by an uplifting guitar climax, is an intoxicating slice of melancholy with which to book-end the recordâ€™s 14-piece song cycle. 

The seeds of the idea that led to â€˜The Incidentâ€™ came to Steven Wilson as he became caught up in a motorway traffic jam whilst driving past a road accident. â€œThere was a sign saying â€˜POLICE â€“ INCIDENTâ€™ and everyone was slowing down to rubber neck what had happened,â€ he recalls. â€œAfterwards, it struck me that â€˜incidentâ€™ is a very detached word for something so destructive and traumatic for the people involvedâ€. Additionally, Wilson delved back into incidents in his own life that had profound affected him, including a lost childhood friendship, a sÃ©ance, his first love, and the day that he decided to give up secure employment to follow his dream of making music. The albumâ€™s epic song, an 11-minute Pink Floyd-flavoured masterpiece called â€˜Time Fliesâ€™, for instance, begins with the line: â€œI was born in 1967.â€ â€˜The Incidentâ€™ is completed by four standalone compositions all housed on a separate CD to stress their independence from the recordâ€™s main 14-part suite.


About the limited edition:
"It's a piece of art...not some files or some functional CD in a bland crystal case...For me, the deluxe edition is a way of making music something people will want to cherish, own and treasure like they would a beautiful painting." Steven Wilson.


The BOX and the pictures are really cool. A true collector's item and highly recommended to grab one.
