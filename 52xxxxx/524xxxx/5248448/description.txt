1. Chisato Kawamura (aka Yuka Mihara) - Cosmos Plan Classic - MDM031
      
      Contains remake of two of her original movies including the debut. I believe
      that the first movie is "Naive Idol Mythology" IF95. The second I am not 
      sure about but have included some covers and screen shots that may lead to 
      a conclusion. If you know please let me know by posting a comment. Thanks.

                well lighted.)
