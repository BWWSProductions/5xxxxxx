[T],skJGZV6z,2010-02-21T06:58Z,"Thanks for this. Heard about the show via Ray Maxwell's podshow on the TWiT network. Ray's a kooky renaissance sorta guy living just south of Vancouver, BC. He mentioned Ice Pilots NWT in episode #59 on a recent midair collision in Colorado. If TPB permits it, here's a link to his show's feed:
