Description by Wiggo:

Hope I'm not too late with the presents? 26th is still a second Christmas day so I hope you enjoy my present. As the title says, it's WWE Impact. It's WWE RAw: Ultimate Impact v2.0, I just decided to shorten the name. There has been made many updates for this like new entrances, new tag teams (Legacy, Jerishow), updated menu videos, updated roster. However, there's still remained many things which you will be able to update by yourselves - like roster updates (putting someone over SCSA) or anything else. I haven't enough time to update everything (you'll notice old Henry's or Khali's attires) due to forthcoming events in my life and lack of time. So I hope you'll do it by yourself.

Some filesize (like apron) are increased a bit as I used a proper UW's UltimateSize hack.

I used much stuff from the community, I credited everyone (at least I hope so, if not PM me or post here) I used their stuff.

Guess, it is the last big project by me (I know, I'm saying it third time) but since WWE Online is coming next year, this game gonna be buried.
