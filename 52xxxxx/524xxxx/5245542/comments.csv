,userlolz,2010-01-28T06:03Z,"Sorry, murtazaas. I'm not Wiggo. I'm a user at TWR who made a torrent mirror for wiggo's Impact v2 (with his permission, of course).

Just visit TWR and he has a Steel Cage (or Hell in a Cell, I'm not sure) Match beta.

Also, StarDDragon. There's no such thing right now. RAW for PC is the only wrestling game for the PC and it's from 2002.

However, you can wait until June 2010 for WWE Online that will come out for the PC with very improved graphics and gameplay."
