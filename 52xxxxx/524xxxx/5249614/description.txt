Description: The next film in the series "Living Landscapes".
The majestic serenity of the forest, the slanting rays of the sun makes his way among the trees. Circumferential mystical mood to the sounds of a symphony Erik Satie, arranged by a musician-virtuoso Rafael. Immerse yourself in the outside world, filled with singing birds, croaking frogs and the gurgling of water, where red squirrels scurry about on the soft mosses and lichens. Swollen in the woods. Enjoy the luxurious beauty of the forests of the wet corner of North America. The first precious drops of dew, sliding from the leaves of a fern - a beautiful prelude to the observation of rushing waterfalls.
