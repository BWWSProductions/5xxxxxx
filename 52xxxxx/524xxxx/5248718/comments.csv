You can get the ESR Program that Im using here:
http://host-a.net/CivicScootin/PS2%20ESR%20Patcher%20%28Win%20and%20Linux%29.zip

Just drag and drop the ISO to the program and it will patch the game for you
OR
Hit ""PATCH"" with in the program and search for the ISO you want to patch with ESR..

Once patching is complete just burn and play

Later,

,CivicScootin,2010-05-29T15:43Z,"@liudux123: You need a guitar or drum or mic in order to play this..

You just cant use a PS2 controller only..
