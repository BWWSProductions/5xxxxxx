I forgot to include 2 files in my first upload,sorry.

I was trying a lot to get this game working. I used the Reloaded release but used the German Crack and copied three steam-dll's from my non-steam Counter-Strike Source Folder into the Binaries Folder of my SAW install. And it worked, at least for me (WinXP SP3 Embedded). Install PhysX first. Just copy all files in this Folder into (example) x:/Games/SAW/Binaries. Hope it works for you, too.
