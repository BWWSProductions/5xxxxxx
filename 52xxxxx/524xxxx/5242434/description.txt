Born in Haiti and raised in NY and Miami, Qwote showed his love for music since
an early age. Drawing inspiration from artists like Sam Cooke, The Beatles,
Michael Jackson and Lenny Kravitz, Qwote decided to commit to music and work
hard towards his future goals and success. His first break came when he got a
chance to work with Slip N Slideâ€™s artist Trina and producer Steve Obas, owner
of Final Cut Music Group. His writing skills and charming vocals quickly led him
to a record deal with Slip N Slide. To this date, Qwote has collaborated with
Trina, Wayne Wonder and Shaggy among others.

While his debut album is still in the works, Qwote is looking forward to
collaborating with a stellar roster of producers on his upcoming project. â€œThe
album will be about me and my vocals and my skills as a song writerâ€ says Qwote.
â€œI hope the album will please my fansâ€™ minds, bodies and souls.â€

"Qwote is the kind of pop artist that is going to expand Slip N Slide Records'
roster and show the growth of the label.â€ states Slip N Slideâ€™s CEO Ted Lucas.
â€œHe will also demonstrate the next level that Slip N Slide Records is going to.
This year we are going to have exciting international songs and artists cross
barriers that we have never touched before."

This is the fanclub album preview produced by nothing less than J. R. Rotem.

N-fuckin-Joy!
