,drakeluvr,2010-03-11T06:07Z,"Okay, I'm not sure why I'm getting this, but I run the setup (in the Direct X folder) and then it tells me that I'm missing direct x 9b and it wants to install it. I say okay, then it tells me that Install failed. Check disc space. and that Install can't continue. I have 46GB of space free. What the heck? I have also tried installing direct x 9b separate and it either gives me a false succes, or it overlooks it. Please help."
,sosalmiemer,2010-04-01T09:46Z,drakeluvr: Why are you installing via your directx folder? Are you questioning why your directx is not installing? Or are you talking about trying to install blaze media?
,Dlea,2010-09-26T21:06Z,If it's only 23.71 MB.s why compress it into a RAR.?
,mVlnt,2011-04-24T05:29Z,"Do you have a version for W7.. I was successful in installing, but when copied the cracked, it didnt run. Pls share the crack for W7.."
,mVlnt,2011-04-24T05:35Z,Dis crack of yours didnt run on Windows7...
,zevs1970,2011-05-20T15:36Z,Trojan found
,kritias,2011-06-04T07:14Z,AVG said the dll in the crack folder was a trojan
,drakeluvr,2011-06-16T10:13Z,"Sorry I didn't get back to you before. Finally got it to install, but now it still won't run even though I copied over the crack like directed. I am running Windows 7 and it is telling me that there's an incompatible program, my yellow announcement screen keeps popping up with the BMP file saying that it was compatible with XP service pack 2. I sent the info to Microsoft so hopefully I'll get a fix to run it. I really want to get back to making videos and I miss my old decompiler... they updated the program and it went kaput on my system and never ran at all. Not sure if it was their update, or again, the incompatibility with Windows 7. *shrug*"
,ACE-ECA,2011-08-31T07:49Z,"Needed internet connection to download about 980KB into the folder [Temporary Internet Files] during installation, then later the installation crashed  halfway. Run Process Explorer to have the installer related processes killed. Then run the installer to install it again, this time it won't ask the user to connect online. Hope reading this save a bit of your time."
