,pagokrat,2011-03-31T10:36Z,"I've been trying to make this work 2 days now... I have a wierd bug where the game just exits to desktop when a map is loading OR after its loaded , on the first few seconds. It could also happen even before that, at the game menu. I've tried everything, all different patches and serials etc.
I can't locate the exact source of the problem, but i can say 90% its not my computer. 
However, i have noticed something interesting, there is file called TADDaemon.exe that runs automaticly when you run trainz. I have debugged it and it seems this thing keeps trying to connect at auran site. And on all occasions, few seconds before the crash, the TADDaemon was making an invalid login at their website. 
It's wierd though cause i dont see any other people complaining or have any other problems... 
Suggestions anyone?"

,lj11194,2011-04-24T01:26Z,"When I try to play, it says ""this pre-release version is expired"" and it says I have to patch it, but when I click ""Patch trainz"" it just says my login details for planet auran are wrong. I can't log into the site either, but when I had them email me my account details they precisely match the ones I am putting in."
,lj11194,2011-04-24T04:30Z,"None of these serials work after patching the game up to 44088, but it won't launch if you don't patch it either"
,thebear2009,2011-08-09T16:29Z,When i try to start the game it says that it is a pre release
