              Scooby and his pals arrive in a town where christmas is not celebrated      
              because a headless snowman terrorizes the residents,                        
              so the amateur sleuths set out to solve the mystery.

                 This was capped from the broadcast on bbc 2's TMI on which i had         
                 edit it but there is parts where it repeats for 2 second which           
                 a big deal if and the TMI logo comes in from the left.                   
                                                                                          
                 also ive kept the frame rate at 25fps as it was broadcast                
                 in pal not ntsc cos they went from people to cartoon.
