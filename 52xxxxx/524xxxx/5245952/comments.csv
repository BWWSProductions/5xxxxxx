,Nocturnal2010,2011-03-19T20:52Z,I didn't look into the release date to much and was under the impression it was the disney movie mulan. IT IS NOT THE DISNEY MOVIE for anyone else that just skims quickly at little details like the release date. Otherwise the movie was fine quality and audi just wish it had hard english subs. Great quality though
