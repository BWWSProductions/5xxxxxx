THE ALEX JONES SHOW
2009.12.29 Tuesday

Alex welcomes back to the show Gerald Celente, trend forecaster, publisher of the Trends Journal, business consultant and author who makes predictions about the global financial markets and other events of historical importance. Celente accurately forecasted the 1987 stock market crash, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the 1997 Asian currency crash and the 2007 subprime mortgage scandal. More recent forecasts involve fascism in the United States, food riots and tax revolts. He describes the emerging crisis as "Obamageddon." Kurt Haskell talks with Alex. Haskell overheard a conversation between the "sharp-dressed man" and a ticketing agent in Amsterdam on Christmas day before the botched underwear bombing. Alex also covers the latest on the underwear bomber, the latest news items of importance, and takes your calls.
