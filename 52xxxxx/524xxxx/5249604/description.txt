So I found an awesome live version of "Let The Flames Begin" by Paramore onand decided to download the video then converted it to mp3. After enhancing it with Audacity by adjusting the volume and adding a little more bass I thought.

"Man, I need to track down what other songs they played". 


In this torrent, you have all six songs played during Live @ BBC Radio One's Big Weekend 2008.

Track Listing:

1. Let The Flames Begin
2. Emergency
3. That's What You Get
4. Crushcrushcrush
5. Pressure
6. Misery Business

File Format: .mp3

Hope you enjoy, don't forget to seed after downloading as I will try to as much as I can but can't 24/7.
