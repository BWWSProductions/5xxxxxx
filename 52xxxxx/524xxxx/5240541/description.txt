Amazon.com Review By Jerry McCulley - Hollywood loved this story so much they remade it every 20 years or so for much of the 20th century; Barbra Streisand imbued it with so much forceful persona in 1976 that they haven't touched it since. The romantic/musical pairing of Streisand and Kris Kristofferson (chosen when no less than Elvis Presley turned the role down) may have been one of the era's strangest but, anchored by Streisand's elegant, Oscar-winning hit theme "Evergreen," it nonetheless yielded the biggest-selling album of the singer's career to date. That neither star is particularly convincing as rock icons--particularly Her Divaness--seems beyond the point of this fable. Instead, both stars take the opportunity to stretch outside their usual personas a bit, Streisand with the R&B teaser "Queen Bee" and confessional "Woman of the Moon," Kristofferson on rousing, theatrical fare like "Watch Closely Now" and "Hellacious Acres." --

William Ruhlmann, All Music Guide - Though it is credited to Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, A Star Is Born is in effect the soundtrack album to the motion picture of the same name, a rock-oriented retelling of the story that had been filmed three times before. That it is not billed as a soundtrack only indicates that the album contains the songs featured in the film, but not the score. Of course, the main drawing card here is "Love Theme From 'A Star Is Born' (Evergreen)," the number one hit. But the rest of the album is slight. Streisand isn't much of a rock singer and these aren't much as rock songs (the songwriters include Paul Williams and Rupert Holmes). For his part, Kristofferson sounds even more gravelly than usual, and he isn't even growling his own compositions, which doubtless would have been superior to what he's been given to sing. Nevertheless, spurred by the hit single and the box office success of the film, A Star Is Born was the best-selling album of Barbra Streisand's career up to this point. ["Evergreen," co-written by Streisand and Williams, won Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal.
