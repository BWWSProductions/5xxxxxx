Music by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Choreographed and staged by Rudolf Nureyev after Marius Petipa. Restaged by Patricia Ruanne 
The Sleeping Beauty remains, as Rudolf Nureyev often called it, the â€˜ballet of balletsâ€™. 
It is the most accomplished and the most brilliant, as well as one of the most spectacular of the 19th century, 
and the most representative of the â€˜nobleâ€™ style of classical dancing. 
Rudolf Nureyev's version, which he created for the Opera Ballet in 1989, was recorded at the OpÃ©ra Bastille in 1999, 
in a new production (sets and costumes) created by his faithful collaborators, Ezio Frigerio and Franca Squarciapino, 
who had already produced Swan Lake, Romeo And Juliet And La BayadÃ¨re.
