,PunksAndSkins.com,2009-12-31T07:39Z,"Yeah sorry, i have stopped almost all my torrents during 1-2 hours because i wanted to seed only a couple of torrents that were stuck at around 95%... Now i will have more bandwidth for these torrents

Oh, and i always seed until a couple of peoples have finished to download so they can help to seed for others"
