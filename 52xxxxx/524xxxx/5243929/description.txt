~~~~~~~~~~~ SYNOPSIS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two South Miami cops, Mike Lowrey, a wild bachelor and Marcus Burnett, a family man, must find $100 million in stolen heroin before their department is shut down. In a race against time, detectives Burnett and Lowrey track a master thief into the Miami underworld, dodging bullets and bad guys along the way. A sexy witness can identify the thief, but when she calls the station, she'll only talk to Lowry--and he's not around. Acting quickly, Burnett impersonates his partner to take the call, but there's only one catch: He has to pretend to be Lowrey for the duration of the case or risk losing her trust. Now, between shoot-outs and car chases, married man Burnett has to stick close to their only eye witness while playboy Lowrey goes home to his partner's wife and kids, maintaining the charade until the case is solved
