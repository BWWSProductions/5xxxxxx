,makapa7,2010-02-07T13:33Z,"yesssss

its 15gig or its 337mg

either way not one of the episodes would play with any known player.
kinda nice to waste nearly 3 weeks getting this down and then find out none of it works.
no surprises really coming from the home of the worlds largest virus spreading website.

all in all its total shite , away now to find these episodes singly , never again will download multiple files, truly horrendous"

,tangoed,2010-05-07T00:46Z,what this padding file ? bitcomet is shite.
[T],karl2802,2011-01-21T20:45Z,"Tangoed. I'm not sure. I used to use BitComet and it's something to do with that. just don't d/l them.
On the plus side it is now known that Dave have commisioned season 9 and that is going to be another 6 episode season, back with a live studio audience and is now being written by Grant and Naylor. It's being filmed later this year to air in 2012! :D"
