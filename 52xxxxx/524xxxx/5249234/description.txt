***Red Dwarf - All the shows***


Red Dwarf was created by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, the radio and TV comedy writers behind Son of ClichÃ© and Spitting Image. It was based on a series of radio sketches they had written called 'Dave Hollins - Space Cadet' about a man stranded on a space ship, alone except for his computer.

First broadcast in 1988, Red Dwarf is a half-hour science-fiction sit-com. It has so far run for 8 series, totalling 52 episodes. It stars Chris Barrie (Rimmer), Craig Charles (Lister), Danny John-Jules (Cat), Robert Llewellyn (Kryten), ChloÃ« Annett (as Kochanski), Norman Lovett and Hattie Hayridge (both playing Holly).


This torrent is ripped from the "Just The Shows" dvd box sets, apart from "Back to Earth", which are t.v rips.


Also, these are the ORIGINAL episodes and NOT the re-mastered versions, so you may see slightly lacking quality for that reason. PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT TO SEE H.D. QUALITY OFF A 21YR OLD T.V.SHOW!!!! ;)
