"Alex welcomes back to the show [hour 3] Gerald Celente, trend forecaster, publisher of the Trends Journal, business consultant and author who makes predictions about the global financial markets and other events of historical importance. Celente accurately forecasted the 1987 stock market crash, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the 1997 Asian currency crash and the 2007 subprime mortgage scandal. More recent forecasts involve fascism in the United States, food riots and tax revolts. He describes the emerging crisis as "Obamageddon."

"Alex also covers the latest on the underwear bomber, the latest news items of importance, and takes your calls."




In the 4th hour, Alex talks with Kurt Haskell, a Michigan attorney who was aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253 and says he witnessed Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab [accompanied by a well-dressed man] trying to board the plane in Amsterdam without a passport.

It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
essential to seek information from a variety of sources,
to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better
understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
mainstream corporate media for news and info is a
prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

Think for yourself!
To paraphrase the late William Cooper:
Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing
until you've researched it yourself.
