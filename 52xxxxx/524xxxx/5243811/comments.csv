But this is one film that really does deserve your time and money to be seen in the cinema, in 3d.
You are denying yourself an amazing experience if you don't. 
A Telesync simply isnt going to do this movie justice. Don't get me wrong, i'm very grateful to the uploader, and i will be downloading, but see it in the cinema first is all i can say...you're missing out if you don't!! :)"

Go watch in the movies first!"

,.Leto.,2010-01-01T09:08Z,@ Beccaz : Don't lie! Only the first few words are in german. It switches to english almost immediately and stays in english during the rest of the movie.
,XavHalo,2010-01-01T13:17Z,"Subs in SecretMyths release
ARE NOT THE CORRECT SUBS

I see 8 and 9 and stuff like that i will tell you now this is a ten all the way for a movie that is still in theaters you cant exspect perfection but this is as close as it gets unless someone gets their hands on a dvd release.  so if you are looking to watch the movie see the color and awsome cg that went into this movie download this torrent once again GREAT JOB!!!!

Video 8 / audio 7 / movie 8

Eventually all wankers become short-sighted. That's why I don't want to wear glasses. I don't need them.
Specially not in a cinema. A good thing they didn't give the female tree-smurfs big hooters. Otherwise all the wankers would have left the cinema totally blind.
They say that Avatar was totally composed with an illegal copy of Adobe After Effects from TPB.
Ain't that a bitch !!"
