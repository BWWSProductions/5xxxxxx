,jmugwump,2011-08-04T01:42Z,"To fix this problem you need to load the DVD file when burning, not the iso file. So if you're using imgburn, click the .dvd file.
If this download doesnt have one, then just make on and re-name it. 
I used to get the same problem and constantly re-downloaded torrents, until I saw a pattern....



Ok I downed it, even burned it, but when I put this in my xbox it says Play DVD, I was like hmkay maybe with trying the wave 4 disc first..
