Orly's Draw-A-Story

Stories spring to life as kids write and illustrate stories with the help of Orly.

Welcome to Jamaica where Orly and her best friend Lancelot (the frog) invite you to draw and paint pictures to illustrate her fantastic stories, write your own stories with pictures and sounds to match or just draw and paint in the doodle pad. 

You can paint a sea monster, but don't get paint in its mouth. Then watch the monster you created come to life in the story with full motion and sound. When you are finished with a story you can watch them play like movies in Orly's outdoor theater. 

Kids express themselves best through creative play. Orly is the perfect guide in these activities which teach and enhance listening, storytelling, drawing, painting, and writing. Kids also learn about Jamaican culture.

This is a wonderful CD packed with sound, music and action for hours of creative play.
