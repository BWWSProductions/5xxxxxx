Music : Punk : MP3/192Kbps
This punk / rock band had a lot of promise, signed to Dreamworks and put down 15 tracks.

After a short US tour the band was dropped when all of the members were shown to have serious drug problems.

Only 5 tracks ever surfaced from the album:

Born Again Loser - posted to the bands myspace only after being dropped
Deathtrap - unknown
So Addicted - This was to be the first single
The Comedown - Track 8/15 on the album
Watson 387 - unknown


Darren - Lead Singer
Zack Lopez- Guitar
Sean Stockham- Drums

Including 4 videos that I was able to find, all right before they were dropped. You can tell why after looking at these.

Not great quality but it completes the collection:

Come and Get It
The Art of Trying
So Addicted
Watson 387


Zack and Sean went on to form Middle Class Rut / MC Rut .


I will pay for a copy of the full Leisure album, contact me.
