,mariomol,2009-12-28T21:58Z,"I extracted and appears a screen with a blank space, asking for a key.

Could anybody simplify (post a keycode)?"
,stre10k,2009-12-29T07:17Z,"There is no any key kodes, if get the window asked for a key - please reinstall the game and extract all files to game folder (it ask to replace - say yes), mount rnr.mds and run the game from it`s shortcut on desktop, nothing else. no codes needed. "
,mariomol,2009-12-29T22:41Z,I will try it now.
,mariomol,2009-12-30T02:00Z,"ACTION: 
1) REINSTALLLED DVD. ISO
2) EXTRACTED 
3)REINSTALLED RNR.CRACK
4) EXTRACTED
5) MDS and MDF MOUNTED ON DAEMON TOOLS.
6) APPEARS A SCREEN "" GAMES FOR WINDOWS""
7) APPEARS A SCREEN CLAIMING FOR A KEY CODE.


I think the best way russian friends could help should be posting some keycodes here.


Aspettiamo, carissimi."
,poglyferal3,2010-01-02T20:13Z,"w7 x64. run well, try to save - epic fail. so sad..."
,Zenit33,2010-01-15T11:50Z,"NO NEED FOR SERIAL KEY. That is what the crack is for, it is not key-generator because the RnR system would not verify the key online.

Torrent crack works, but you can try this also: http://www.przeklej.pl/plik/rnr-7z-0006qf29e7tb

Instructions:
Extract the rar, move (select all and drag) files into RnR root folder and click to replace those that have same name. (Just mds & mdf not necessary) . Use virtual drive program such as Daemon Tools Lite to create virtual drive (like E:) and mount the mds/mdf onto there. Then run RunGame.exe in your RnR folder and it should play. If not then I forgot an installation step, while the mds file is still mounted, go to My Computer, go to that virtual drive and run the Ukranian installation. 

Note, when installing for RnR the first time, select lower of 2 options for custom rather than express install. Unselect all 4 options on 1st page of custom install if you dont want junk similar to Xfire. Then select all following options and pick your extraction point
