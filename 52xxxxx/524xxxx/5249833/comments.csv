,BigJoe309,2011-02-08T22:47Z,This is an rar which opens into an exe file?
,makeacircuit,2011-02-25T17:52Z,rar opens to .exe .... scanned with kaspersky and this showed up as a Trojan.. :/
,ballsacks,2011-03-22T07:06Z,"rar contains an .exe,  wouldn't trust it even if the scanner said it was clean."
,Shuffle_,2012-02-29T05:29Z,"yeah, .exe file in the rar, very strange!"
