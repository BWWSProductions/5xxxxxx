,want_movies2,2010-04-01T11:03Z,"This (and other mp4's) play with a distorted aspect ratio, as though they had been compressed from movie screen proportions to TV screen proportions instead of using letterbox format, but only in AVS Media Player: it's fine in VLC.

Is it an adjustable setting in AVS?"
