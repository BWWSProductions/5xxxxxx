In ancient Egypt, one priest had the nerve to fall in love with Pharaoh's mistress. As a penalty, he was cursed to become one of the undead and suffer for all time. Unless someone released him from his prison.Flash forward to the 1920's. A group of treasure hunters and a group of archeologists set out to find the ancient city of Hamunaptra. When they accidentally awaken the ancient evil, they find themselves in a race against time to save their own skin and the world in general. Is there a way to stop someone you can't kill?
