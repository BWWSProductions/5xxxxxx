Dont download - THIS IS CR#P"
,tuffcruiser,2010-01-02T08:19Z,I you get the error in win 7 run as admin
,Anglian,2010-01-02T18:56Z,"This has just installed and run successfully on my Windows 7 64-bit setup with no problem other than taking quite a long time to install.

I hope that encourages those trying with Windows 7 to persevere as this is a terrific application :)

Thanks to the Morck22."
,ImSoJaded,2010-01-03T10:57Z,"If you have crashes, and you see strange, quickly growing trees in the game, you can download and apply the SP1 patch from this thread on the official forums.

http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?t=49580

Fixed the crashes for me.

Also, if you have the 00006 error even though you ran the installer as admin, check the game directory, the game is still installed. When you start the game the first time the train database update will take a long time, be patient."

,Osten86,2010-02-13T16:14Z,"I found a hotfix for the instalation problem in the late end of disc 2.
After the error comes up, click ok ok, bla bla..
Then go to your installation folder, klick trainz.exe enter your serial key you entered in the first place, click add. Then ok. then click content, let it ""patch"" it takes a while, and then after that you can click on start to run the game"

But the SP2 (41615_to_42203) bans all 4 serials in the .nfo and you can't revert back to SP1, you have to reinstall the whole game.
If anyone has a serial that works with SP2... :)"

Keys in this release are banned with SP2 as pewpew7 said.

Anyone got other serials ? Searched everywhere but couldn't find anything"

,Tuddley3,2010-12-28T09:13Z,"I'm wondering if there is a ""backdoor"" way into the Auran DLS. Otherwise you can only use default routes because you need additional dependencies from the Download Station, and if you don't have your own serial # you can't even register at certain download sites."

,pagokrat,2011-03-31T10:36Z,"I've been trying to make this work 2 days now... I have a wierd bug where the game just exits to desktop when a map is loading OR after its loaded , on the first few seconds. It could also happen even before that, at the game menu. I've tried everything, all different patches and serials etc.
I can't locate the exact source of the problem, but i can say 90% its not my computer. 
However, i have noticed something interesting, there is file called TADDaemon.exe that runs automaticly when you run trainz. I have debugged it and it seems this thing keeps trying to connect at auran site. And on all occasions, few seconds before the crash, the TADDaemon was making an invalid login at their website. 
It's wierd though cause i dont see any other people complaining or have any other problems... 
Suggestions anyone?"
,lolex2008,2011-04-02T23:03Z,"@pagokrat I am experiencing exactly the same and like you, I REALLY wondered what it could be and was like ""why doesnt anyone mention this?!"" seems like either Auran has created something to detect wrong keys or something diferent... I hope someone can fix that though... It gets me frustrated that i cant use any of the routes or even wont load the game at times.. Soemtimes it just says ""this pre release version has expired"" or seomthing like that and exits.. wierd!"
,Thomas121,2011-04-04T16:04Z,"@pegokrat & lolex2008: I had this exact same problem, but thanks to pegokrat I now know the cause.

The solution is rather simple: block TADDaemon from having internet access. Blocking it in the firewall of Windows worked for me."
,Thomas121,2011-04-04T16:10Z,"And just another note: I got the C0000006 error too, but everything still worked fine."
,Mr.Extra,2011-04-05T21:20Z,@pagokrat Same here. Seems like i will be buying it now
,pagokrat,2011-04-05T22:40Z,"@Thomas121 Yea, at the momenti was too frustrated to think about that, i m gonna try to block internet access to it. Which program did u use? Netlimiter? and which game version? have you updated the game atll?"
,Thomas121,2011-04-05T23:32Z,"I just used Windows Firewall (you have to manually block it through the firewall rules/settings), but I think any firewall will do. Another (more drastic) possibility is disconnecting your internet for a little while.

I had an updated version of the game, but I'm not sure whether that works with this method. I reinstalled since then and use the unpatched version (build 41491)."
,pagokrat,2011-04-06T04:13Z,asdf
,pagokrat,2011-04-06T04:15Z,"Well, windows firewall didnt work for me for some reason (i m running on windows XP SP3). I used netlimiter and it works like a charm. 
I notice a little lagging on the texture loading when you start a new game but other than that everything walks fine"
,pagokrat,2011-04-06T04:16Z,"So... For anyone else having a problem just like ours here are the steps you have to take:

1. Mount the game and install 
2. Use the provided serial (better use this one, as it works with SP2 as well:
ATRZ-A2FL-84Y3-Z26Y-8QHE-D2WR
)- you can add more later or change the one you have
3. This is optional, you can apply the offical game patches if you like. Don't update further than version 42203 as i dont know any serial that works with SP3. You can find the patches here: auran.com/servicepacks/ (The version you have is 41491 so start by downloading  41491 -> 41615)
4. This is the most important part if you're facing the problem we had. BLOCK with some firewall (windows,netlimiter or any other you have) TADDaemon.exe AND Trainz.exe.
5. Run the game and play properly without game crashing to desktop!"

,carclah,2011-04-20T19:39Z,thomas how i can block the TADDaemon?
,merry19,2011-10-31T14:53Z,"external exception C0000006 solution -> hello...
i detected solution about C0000006,
