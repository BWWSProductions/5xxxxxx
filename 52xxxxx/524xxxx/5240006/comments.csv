I take my time to share - and i get shit comments from ppl like u - don't download from me then - ok -  jog on u ungrateful prick - 

I can't leave my comp on 24/7 - Maybe if ppl like u re-seeded - ( ive seen your ups 2 - u r nothing to scream about ) it is only my 5-6 th attempt at this - and im thinking of saying screw it - why bother just to hear shit like this - from ingreats like u ....... "
,kingt2007,2009-12-26T03:08Z,"Yeah, I agree, but don't give the asshole so much attention he probably thrives on shit like that. Haven't downloaded it but in the process, will seed and say thank you."

V = 10
A = 8

Good job."
