==== Description ====

Experience one of the most dramatic years in the history of the Monte-Carlo Rally with this comprehensive look at the 1986 World Rally Championship season-opener. Packed with incredible action footage from the historic mountain stages, plus interviews with legendary drivers and jaw-dropping slow-motion film, this is the complete story of an unforgettable event.
The '86 Monte-Carlo Rally was the first round of what would prove to be the very last year of the awesomely powerful Group B 'supercars'. Enjoy the sights - and incredible sounds - of the Martini Lancia Delta S4, Audi Quattro S1, Peugeot 206 T16 and Metro 6R4 as they do battle.
Lancia's Henri Toivonen and co-driver Sergio Cresto took advantage of their Pirelli tyres in the opening stages to establish a healthy lead, but reigning World Champion Timo Salonen and Monte-Carlo expert Walter Rohrl were soon piling on the pressure.
Toivonen looked certain for victory, until a bizarre accident involving a spectator's car cost him the lead. However, the Finnish star refused to be beaten and clawed back the lost time to take a dominant victory.
Tragically, this would be the final victory for the popular Toivonen and co-driver Cresto. This look back at the '86 Monte-Carlo Rally is a fitting tribute to the pair, as well as a real feast of classic rallying action
Monte-Carlo Rally 1986 is part of a collectable set of classic Monte-Carlo rally highlights programmes.
