,Kencoldman,2009-12-29T00:02Z,You have got to be one of the best uploaders hands down Excelent Quality and small files. How does he do it! so much for adulation now for a simple request. Invictus Please. Thanks ahead of time.
,lilars26,2009-12-29T02:46Z,"Very,very good movie,pulled at my heartstrings.Thanks again 20/40.I hope you decide to stick around."
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-29T07:48Z,"Thanks, I watch it because I have been waiting for this one, and decided to upload it - immediately - before ""Invictus"" (which has been ""ready"" for three days). So Kencolkidman, beware, Invictus is long movie, 2h 13m and relatively ""big"", 431 MB."
,mrhinter,2009-12-29T13:33Z,"ha! 431mb compared to the 1.36 gig one i got (noir from 1337x upload - another champion) because i just couldnt wait! ill probably grab yours too though 20, just so i can seed ya for a while.... 431 meg HA! "
,mrhinter,2009-12-29T14:14Z,and one last question seeing as its question day..... what you think you could do with one of the new 720p copies of avatar running at about 2.05gig? :P 
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-29T16:34Z,"@mrhinter: I did TWICE, even the newest and biggest PriSM (4.42 GB)... and both times I've got 500 MB big piece of crap. I must repeat that Avatar need 6 hours per pass for re encoding, 2 passes=12 hours. Beside, I've done it four times alltogether; first CAM, than HOMEMADE and 2+ and 4+ GB versions with German video and English audio. Both newest Telesyncs have total async (come and goes) and first four sentences are on German. Day before yesterday I deliberately left that German part and re-encoded to 500 MB. Result was mediocre picture, and sound, as I said, has big problems...
OK, next day I mixed in first 45 secs in English and re-encoded again.
After really long encoding (during which I cannot do anything else - CPU is on 99% all the time), I wasn't satisfied with the quality. I have asked myself Why? and answers I've found haven't get such third Avatar up, mainly because 700 MB new version IS better than mine exactly how bigger it is - percentage-wise... So, there will be no future Avatars anymore, I have other things to encode."
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-29T17:14Z,"BTW, I cannot upload torrent for last 20 h, from friends computer too... either I cannot upload for whatever reason or TPB blocked uploads... I have no clue."
,lilars26,2009-12-29T18:22Z,yes 20/40 something is going on at TPB.I went to recent torrents and nothing has been uploaded today from anyone.Hope it's nothing serious.
,mrhinter,2009-12-30T01:00Z,"shame on me for asking, i knew you took a crack at it before (not too bad a clean up in comparison to what was out at the time) and thanks for the detailed reply! 

glad to hear it wasn't just my paranoia with tpb uploads :P"
,dd123zz,2010-03-12T03:16Z,can someone reseed please?
