Heretic 2 for Mac - By Fresch3000

Heretic II is a fantasy action-adventure game developed by Raven Software and published by Activision in 1998 continuing the story of Corvus, the main character from its predecessor, Heretic. Using a modified id Tech 2 engine, the game features a mix of a third-person camera with a first-person shooter's action, making for a new gaming experience at the time.


This port supports Widescreen Resolutions.
Some Work, and Some dont.

The standard resolution is 1920x1200, but it can be changed via. the Video menu, in the game.

The game only supports 4:3 resolutions from the ingame menu, so if you want to use your widescreen resolution you have to do the following:


The first thing you need to get is an Hex Editor.
For mac,  HexFiend is Great.

Rightclick on the Heretic 2 icon, click Show Package Content.
Navigate to: Contents -> Shared Support -> CrossoverGames -> Support -> Default -> Drive_c -> Program Files -> Heretic
Drag the file "quake2.dll", to your desktop.


 Open HexFiend, and locate the quake2.dll file on your desktop. Open it.

Start by pressing "CMD+F", to find a line. Mark the radiobutton ASCII.
Write:     1920
And press Next.


Find number 00800700, and 00B00400 (Usually next to eachother), to the left, from "1920" in the Hex part of the editor.

The part "8007", and "B004", and the ones that need to be changed.

8007 is the screen width and B004 is the height.
Change the two numbers (When you press delete, or backspace, it removes 2 digits. Remember that!!!) , into the resolution in the table below:

For example, if i want to change my resolution to 1280 x 720, 
ill change 8007 to 0005, and B004 to D002

After you have made your change, save the file, and drag it back into the Heretic 2 folder. Remember to make a backup of the original quake2.dll, if you mess something up.


Resolutions:

_____________
1650  x   1050
90 06    1A 04
_____________
1440  x   900
A0 05     84 03

_____________
1280   x   720
00 05     D0 02

Not every resolution work in full screen, but check it out.
If your resolution is not supported, use the original quake2.dll file, and play the game using a standard ingame resolution.




MUSIC SUPPORT!
The music in Heretic 2, is played from the original Heretic 2 cd, and cant be ripped and used without the Cd. What a shame... BUT, the port does support the original cd. If you have it, pop it in the drive, and mark "CD Music", in the ingame menu, and everything should be fine :)


ENJOY!
