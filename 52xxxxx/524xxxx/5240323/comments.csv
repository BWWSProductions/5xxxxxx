,downloadfreak112,2009-12-26T23:11Z,i think its a good torrent but when i try to open nomosaicWa with winrar it said this file is damaged what do i have to do now??
,Counselor1130,2009-12-26T23:58Z,"@downloadfreak112

You don't need to unrar nomosaicWA. The file is a package file. Just follow the directions in the read me file TO THE LETTER."

,Meggles5,2010-02-13T03:01Z,"Worked great thanks! I was a bit confused with the instructions tho. It said to extract any and all mods including the nomosaicWA into packages folder which made me think I needed to use Winzip to extract it. All i needed to do was copy that file and paste into packages. much less confusing just saying that. But anyway, thanks so much for the upload. LOVE IT!"
,Meggles5,2010-02-13T03:01Z,btw what is super nude patch and what does it do? I'm intrigued..... :P

,Lord_Seele,2010-04-18T10:06Z,"I don't think I installed it correctly. How do I know when it's working? I dl'ed, created the new folders, and then put the resource.cfg in the root directory and the nomosaicWA file in the Mods/Packages folder. Am I meant to do something after that?"
,garbagedrew,2010-12-30T04:22Z,Worked perfectly for me!
,dandelionjoker,2011-07-28T15:33Z,does this work for base game rip
,joblo35,2011-09-22T21:49Z,"does the resource.cfg go in the game\bin folder and if it does then everytime i load the game it crashes 
appears to load then stops loading"
