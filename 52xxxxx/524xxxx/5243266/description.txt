Amazon.co.uk Review - Dubstar operated in the same terrain as The Beautiful South and Morrissey--there's a very flat sense of Northern melancholy about them, all high rises and low self-esteem. This is especially so on "Not So Manic Now" about a girl unable to leave her flat since she was assaulted and "Just A Girl She Said", a cold study of an emotionally abusive sexual relationship delivered in authentically numb tones by Halifax-born vocalist Sarah Blackwood. Whereas The Beautiful South revel in semi-detached greyness, however, and Morrissey is prone to lyrically provocative gestures, Dubstar match the deadpan restraint of their lyrics with a sparkling techno-indie soundtrack, courtesy of Chris Wilkie's janglepop guitar and programmer Steve Wilkie's layers of synthesizer. The sumptuous "Stars" and ska-flecked "Elevator Song" in particular hint at a backdrop of teasing glamour and neon lights against which disappointingly ordinary lives are led.
