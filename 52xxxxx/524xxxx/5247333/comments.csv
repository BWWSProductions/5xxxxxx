,Cherbette,2009-12-29T18:39Z,I would like to request anything by Cher or Sonny and Cher on vinyl :) any 45s or lps by Cher solo or as a duo?
[V],HMVinyl,2009-12-29T19:06Z,"ooo no cher but i'll check the shop, cant be that hard to find"
,Cherbette,2009-12-30T05:45Z,that would be awesome! I like what I've heard of your work so far...I'd love to hear you tackle some Cher/Sonny and Cher. 
[V],HMVinyl,2009-12-30T20:52Z,"i wanna upload so bad, i have so many rips now, still no cher or cat stevens though, still looking"
,bytehd2000,2009-12-30T23:24Z,"sounds terrible compared to recent CD FLAC rips
I mean really bad, not just the typical vinyl needle pops, just the lack of dynamic range is appalling in these....my 2 cents"
[V],HMVinyl,2009-12-31T02:56Z,"i understand alot of people are devoted to digital, or at leased say it sounds just as good as vinyl, i personally feel that vinyl is the true way to listen. obviosly when i record them their not going to be exactly what i hear at home, but i left in the clicks and crackle to give it that old school sound that i'm sure a few people want to hear, my uploads are for the vinly lovers."
[V],HMVinyl,2009-12-31T03:05Z,also HUGE thanks to the 39 other people holdin on to this one! happy new year!
