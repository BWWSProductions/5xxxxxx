,spongs,2010-03-19T01:29Z,"I burnt this to DL Verbatim using Alcohol 120% on a Pioneer DVR-S18L, booktype DVDRom speed 2.4.

When I put it in the RNS-E unit, it upgraded the firmware okay, asked for PIN which I entered, then it said ""Insert Navigation CD"" or something like that. System still works with the old original DVD. 

Obviously I'm not doing something quite right, any advice much appreciated. "

Worked for me!

XP3, Intel based mobo, and the musthave Pioneer Drive (IDE 112D fw 128 with bitsetting), burned on a verbatim DVD+R DL, speed x4, with ImgBurn !

Made 10 coasters before this last try, same file, same Verbatim, but 2 Samsung, 1 Asus and even a Pioneer DVR S18, with an Amd + Windows 7 no succes, and seems at last, like the DVD burner is the only relevant point... You have to go pioneer...
Found a mine for nothing on eBay.
