Does it have to be dual layer DVD or ?  You said 3.5 Gb  but size in info here says 6.75Gb.

,fabio29,2010-02-08T21:38Z,"Hello....

I used the  selfunpack program and got a file..of 6+ GB. it has no extension..no ISO or IMG nothing..just a raw file.  aI forced CloneCD to write to a doublelayer DVD  all ok but after that I tried to see what is the DVD content,,..NOTHING... I tried it in a MK4 unit...it wont recognize it..
Any Ideas? thanks a lot "
,Be1ngEv1L,2010-02-12T12:51Z,"Hey Guys

Here's what to do,
1) download the torrent
2) download an unarchiver 
(mac = The Unarchiver link= ""http://theunarchiver.googlecode.com/files/TheUnarchiver2.3.zip"")
(pc = unsure :S sorry can't test them however there are hundred to try)
3) open BMW-High-2010-1.000 with the chosen unarchiver and wait till it completes.
4) you'll end up with a unknown file called ""BMW-High-2010-1""
5) change the file name to have "".iso"" on the end. (in windows i think you have to enable the ""show file extentions"" in View...)
6) you'll then have a 7.24GB disk image that you can mount and burn.
7) obviously it'll be to a dual layer dvd. I think it's hard luck for those who don't have one. I suggest splitting the files on to 2 normal dvd's before unarchiving them and taking them round a mate's house who was clever and bought a new iMac :P

P.S) i'm yet to test this in my sat nav, waiting for my dl dvd's to arrive. will post when they do.

,unrealgf,2010-02-14T12:08Z,"for pc user:
install UltraIso and open .dvd file.
burn with Ultraiso

the .000 - .dvd are container files, u must not rename it to .iso. just open .dvd file with ultraiso"
,rikardo69,2010-02-17T22:57Z,everything works great thanks!
,SHADOWBMW,2010-02-18T07:56Z,"Couldn't do it on mac the way Be1ngEv1L explained, gave error on 62% of burning process, with Disc Utility and also Toast.
But did it well using virtual machine and ultraiso, works great"
,SHADOWBMW,2010-02-19T16:45Z,"On the second day the mk4 unit doesn't recognize the disc. 
The DL disc is Memorex, maybe I have to try another brand like Verbatim or something like that."
,unrealgf,2010-02-20T20:48Z,"On Verbatim works greate. 

@shadowbmw : u need on your mk4 navi firmware 31 or 32 for Doublelayer compatibility"
,emilc007,2010-02-28T16:24Z,"could someone help me plz. i have downloaded the torrent. but when i try to burn it on a duuble layer it gives me a error, waste now 4 Doublelayer dics. i have followed the guide on how to burn... "
,hanskg,2010-03-04T15:30Z,"For linux users, lust cat the files (000 -006) together into a .iso and burn it"
,cyberthugs,2010-03-08T08:29Z,"Works great in my e46 2004. 
Burned with imgburn on slow speed on dual layer dvd. 
no need for unzipping or renaming. just burn. "
,SHADOWBMW,2010-03-22T17:00Z,"unrealgf: I've got the v32 firmware, it seems to be the problem with the disc.
Right now I'm writing the image on Verbatim disc at 1x speed, I'll let you know if it works."
,cihado25,2010-03-23T15:56Z,just tried this with ultraiso and it dosent work on my bmw e64. used a double layer verbatim 8x. im not sure but i think this is not good. u should use a iso file instead.
,gfx8,2010-06-23T14:23Z,"Can somebody please upload the CD version Europackage - VDO Dayton non C-IQ CD-Pack v.2010/2011.

Thanks."
,Rookie79,2010-06-24T23:33Z,Will it work on a E60/61? Which languages are included?
,Spliffmaster,2010-06-29T14:03Z,"Can anyone besides me confirm that this is a shit torrent!

I have done everything i possibly can to burn this shit.

When the burner starts burning on the second layer, it stops the burning.

I dont know anymore what to do. i have wreced 5 cd:s now.

Is there someone for sure that can confirm how to burn this shit? Or is it a faulty torrent that i suspect!"
,imranafz,2010-07-21T20:14Z,"burnt this with imgburn, no unpacking necassary.
just open the file ""BMW-High-2010-1.dvd""
remember to burn at a slow speed, so the car navi will have an easier time reading this.

i have not tested the dvd yet in the car!!
will post if test is successfull!!"
,Imhso,2011-03-23T23:52Z,"It worked great on my BMW E318D (2,0) 2006.

I did these steps. On my Macbook Pro 2011 version.

1. Download THIS torrent.
2. Use ""The Unarchiver"" to ekstract.
3. Rename the ""BMW-HIGH-2010-1"" file to ""BMW-HIGH-2010-1.ISO""
4. Right click it and select burn. 
5. Name it ""DVD ROAD MAP EUROPE HIGH 2010""
6. Select burn in lowest speed (2,4 if possible)

I got ""not readable"" or something, but i just pushed ""NAVIGATION"" One more time and it worked like a charm.

This is how i did it on MAC."
,Imhso,2011-03-24T19:59Z,EDIT IT DID NOT WORK I PUT THE WRONG CD IN. SHITTY TORRENT!
