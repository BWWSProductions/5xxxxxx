THE AUDIO MAKES IT ABSOLUTELY UNWATCHABLE!

,repeater4u,2010-01-01T14:17Z,"video= 9
Audio= 3
Audio is really bad, way out of sync & tinny. Not worth grabbing but many thanks for the effort 'raymondhome'"
,Pir8Gold,2010-01-01T19:05Z,"Not a DVD screener - it's telesync.
The audio is barely acceptable - tinny and some audience noise - coughing etc.
Aspect ratio is wrong. Can be improved by setting to 2.21:1
Movie looks interesting so far. Gotta love a movie with children roasting in the oven. mmm"
,jlsmetalhead,2010-01-01T19:50Z,I'll Wait Thanks Anyway.
,cigaretteburns,2010-01-03T15:17Z,"To clarify for others; this is a DVDSCR, but it is a Spanish screener. The uploader has painstakingly dubbed English audio from a CAM over the Spanish language - and has done a great job. It is not his fault the source audio was pretty awful.
