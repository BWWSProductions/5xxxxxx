Opens with secretary Valerie Martinâ€™s going down on her boss (GÃ©rard Gregory) behind his desk. He leaves the office and she resumes typing. A visitor (Jack â€“ Jacques Gatteau) arrives to see the boss and sits down to wait, but it isnâ€™t long before he is standing behind her and putting his hands down her blouse. The boss returns and catches them at it on the office couch. She gets fired and takes Jack home with her. The boss is the only person in the film who takes offence at finding his or her sexual partner in the act with another.

So begins a non-stop round of sexual encounters, nearly every one interrupted by a friend who joins in, as the action moves from apartment to apartment and as CÃ©line Gallone, Diane Dubois, Cathy Stewart and others get involved in the action.
