,charleslace23,2010-05-02T15:47Z,bt3 works like margic...its cracks the exact wep key...not WPA. if you want to crack WPA-PSK use BT4

,techneck,2012-03-21T07:11Z,thanks dude.
,dosthanos,2012-05-02T21:55Z,whodathoughtit     doesn't have to do with the wireless card but with the fact that Backtrack or any other program you use to hack recognizes the wireless card
,D255,2012-05-11T16:30Z,"use/runs your backtrack (what ever it is)
& use samba to make it connect with your 
windows. it's done"
,cyankat,2012-07-08T19:16Z,"aite, so i have a compatible card, according to the list from that site, but i can't install any of the drivers. i went to have disk, and i selected each driver individually, receiving a message saying it wasn't compatible for each one."
