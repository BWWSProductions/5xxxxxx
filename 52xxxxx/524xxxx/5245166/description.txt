     These are the videos that started Uncle Crispy Productions... one thursday night we brought 2 cameras to a show, the next day the first Uncle Crispy video was edited, and the rest is history. This was one of the last times the band performed at Java Joes without mics. This was also Jason's second show after having recorded his Elektra Album, so some of the songs were still new. It is a classic Java Joe's show, just Jason, Toca & Ian and a coffee shop full of fans!


Recording Equipment:
Q: What type of video/audio gear do you use
A: We have two cameras, the 3-CCD Sony TRV950 and a 1-CCD Sony TRV27. Both shoot in MiniDV and we use the TRV950 as the main camera when possible. There is a very stark difference between the colors and lighting of the two cameras, I highly recommend a 3CCD MiniDV camera if you are looking to purchase. For audio we generally use a Nomad Jukebox 3 with AT831 Mics and an SP-SPSC-1 batt. box but we've also used the internal mic on the camera in some cases.
