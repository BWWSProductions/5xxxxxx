,dockersfan,2009-12-28T04:00Z,"Thanks Smorgan for the upload.

For me its appears not to be working.  Word and others shows the red title bar as ""product activation failed"", as shown in link; http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/9746/officeword2010.jpg"
,Smorgan,2009-12-28T04:03Z,How very odd never had that happen before try doing a uninstall and then a reinstall.....
,Smorgan,2009-12-28T04:13Z,hmm upon installation of office 2010 plug-in the key but at the buttom un check activating it immediately so as its never been activated then run all the hacks... 
,ppcps,2009-12-28T18:46Z,"what happens if activation already expired? on one of my computers an earlier version of the fix had worked (thank you so much!), but on another, office already expired and the hack doesn't seem to fix the issue. 

thanks again for all your work"
,Smorgan,2009-12-28T19:55Z,"pretty much you don't event try to activate these keys because they've been used so much.  Once you install office you go directly to one of the hacks and you use it.  And you don't click the option to activate immediately after the install.

-Smorgan"
,Smorgan,2009-12-28T23:34Z,ok other than a few activation problems which were easily corrected hows the hack working?  Also hows is the terminator working?  It would be helpful to know thanx...
,ppcps,2009-12-29T00:30Z,"terminator is working very well (thank you!)
after uninstalling/installing etc. neither hazar's nor your hack worked for me (possibly due to the fact that i tried it after it had already expired)

thanks anyway, this is great stuff!"
,Smorgan,2009-12-29T00:32Z,"Sorry it ain't working....
But thanx for the feed back!!!
hmm maybe a complete Uninstall will work."
,Smorgan,2009-12-29T00:34Z,And what I mean is going into all the cracks and just blowing this software away and then reinstalling it.
,dockersfan,2009-12-29T04:03Z,"G'day Smorgan, no go man.  Have uninstalled 2010, ran reg-cleaner, rebooted, re-installed, made sure no 'net connection active and ran both hacks, same error.

I can't see if it has ""dumb"" down the program, will continue to use it until I can't :)"
,Smorgan,2009-12-29T04:13Z,um I have one more trick up my sleeve go into C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared and see if there are any office files thats the last idea from me or u can get a program to get rid of all of it.
,Smorgan,2009-12-29T04:20Z,Another idea run the setup again and plugin a different key hopefully this isn't the 64 bit edition.
,dockersfan,2009-12-29T04:56Z,"I'll uninstall 2010, delete whatever is in C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared directory, run another reg.cleaner, reboot and then install 2010 with no 'net connection and run the hacks.

The 2010.exe file already has the key embedded, unless that is my issue.

Thx heaps Smorgan, I'll try that. "
,Smorgan,2009-12-29T05:19Z,you need to be very careful what u get rid of thou Id recommend getting rid of the things that start with a capital letter those should be the office components.
,dockersfan,2009-12-29T06:12Z,"I only deleted Office14 in that directy, still no go, oh well, thanks for the suggestions.

I used all 3 hacks; http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/3056/hacks.jpg

The smiley's still disappear for that session after running the terminator, tho they do reappear after a reboot."
,Smorgan,2009-12-29T07:45Z,Well this just confuses the hell out of me time to take a look at all this cause it shouldn't be possible to fun a service if the exe files aren't even there lol.
,Smorgan,2009-12-29T07:49Z,"To continue my statement earlier which made no sense at all it should not be possible for a service to run if there is not exe file running it.

How very confusing"
,Smorgan,2009-12-29T07:57Z,"Ok since I need to fix the 32 bit version can someone confirm that the 64 bit version is working other than me the developer?

-Smorgan"
,Smorgan,2009-12-29T17:21Z,Well thats answered in the activation directions either way you should get the same results physically.  So take a look at the Office 2010 Activation there should be a handy picture too.
,ppcps,2009-12-29T22:32Z,"i have discovered an ironic solution:
- when you start a program, it prompted me with a screen. i clicked on get new activation key, and it directed me to microsoft's site.
- copied the key. 
- uninstalled the hack
- started a program, it prompted me to upgrade/customize, chose customize
-entered microsoft's key
-unclicked the activate now option
-exit program and ran hack again.
WORKED!! :) 

now, i don't get the prompt! it still says unlicensed product, but not with the red banner across the top.

cheers smorgan"
,Smorgan,2009-12-30T06:19Z,"Ok thats what its supposed to look like now we all have to wait for a program that won't come out until the fall of 2010.  

And happy New Year btw at least thats the bright side."
,Avatarkg,2009-12-31T20:56Z,Haha Smorgan your hacks are sheet as always. It's not activator and 1.70 is same like 1.80 Hazar Script as old stuff...
,Smorgan,2009-12-31T23:46Z,Well the good news is that I neglected to put activator in there as well as getting rid of annoying crap.... haha but yea i get your thing however It does work to put it all together in one thing and yes the script of 1.80 is almost exactly the same as 1.70 i just wanted to keep my promise on releasing something new...
,Smorgan,2009-12-31T23:49Z,Which is why everyone is skipping 1.70 and going directly to 1.80 and the sad part is that I dont think there is a place you can get hazar's hack anymore I wanted to put it in to make your llife easier hmm i need to fix the terminator sometime x32
,Avatarkg,2010-01-01T02:25Z,Ah i just say the truth...
,Smorgan,2010-01-01T02:39Z,Yes it is...
,Avatarkg,2010-01-01T03:14Z,Smorgan please contact me on avatar_kg@hotmail.com. I have someting to tell you about office 2010 activator...
,Smorgan,2010-01-01T03:40Z,Again its not really an activator it just gets rid of the notifications and disables a count down timer and I really don't want to stay in the hacking business.
,Smorgan,2010-01-12T11:20Z,I'm working on office 2010 V1.90 but I don't think I will release it cause it really doesn't fix all that much in the way of problems with V1.80 so its going to stay in my bag of tricks.
,Smorgan,2010-01-14T09:38Z,I still have yet to confirm that the recent leak of office 2010 version 14.0.4730.1007 will work with this hack but it should it would be nice if someone did as I don't have the best internet connection in the world.
,davem4983,2010-01-16T07:35Z,"This hack just crashes 4730.1014 now. On the bright side, it looks like Office works just fine without a hack - theres just a ton of nag screens and a red bar."
,Smorgan,2010-01-17T01:35Z,I never could get the new thing to input a serial number I don't think this version is very stable its like running Windows Vista with a shit load of Virus software and I can't seem to uninstall it I might advise sticking with the public release to make it all good.
,Smorgan,2010-02-07T08:36Z,Seeing as there are no current Product keys which will work with this copy (that being the RTM ESCRO of office 2010) that was just leaked.  This could pose a hindrance to me so this may be a time for me to come up with a plan (or someone can get a valid key) to get the damn thing to install.... 
,Smorgan,2010-03-21T10:03Z,I'm back in black lol (good song) any how I just stopped supporting all the hacks earlier than office 2010 1.60.  Those were even the originals created to originally hack office 2010 back in October of 2009 cause I can and I thought you guys would find it more beneficial if I focused more up to date things....
,JHdD[NL],2010-03-22T17:58Z,"Ive got something you maybe want to look into. I've got Office 2010 RC (x64) on Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. When I was trying to get rid of that stupid red bar on top I found a process in taskmanager called OSPPSVC.exe located in: ""C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform"". In the same folder there is a file called OSPPREARM.EXE. when I removed OSPPSVC.exe and started OSPPREARM.EXE and then started Office 2010 it starts to repair OSPPSVC.exe and after that the red bar was gone and office was working normal again. This could be the solution to the problem."
,Smorgan,2010-03-23T04:18Z,I can neither confirm this or deny this because it appears for a short amount of time that the red bar accross the top is gone before the Office Protection Service aka OSPPSVC.exe is reset and the protection goes back into effect....
,Smorgan,2010-03-24T21:25Z,I have a solution that works for 6 months from the URL I provided its really easy as all my stuff is lol want me to release it???
,Smorgan,2010-04-09T08:17Z,"This version is hereby out of date cause I released V2.00 which has a RTM crack and Pre-RTM crack in it.  The RTM can probably double as a Pre-RTM too... However one major change Hazar requested I take his stuff out I have done so...
