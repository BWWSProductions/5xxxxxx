,geohru,2009-12-28T15:13Z,i get an error when i try to install this any ideas
,HairyBallsagna,2009-12-28T16:50Z,"u should get an error when installing as it installs no content, however when you  go to your Music store, all the songs will now be available to download for free.

also u must have a Current shop channel and must be NTSC-U   Or have your shop channel region changed to NTSC-U"
