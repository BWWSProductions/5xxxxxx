You ruined the 1080p!,What a waste.

This is a 3 hours movie, the size should be at least 8 GB for a proper 1080p rip, and over 6500 kB/s for video. 

Also deblock=1:-2:-2 surely made the movie awfully pixelated. "
,penandpike,2010-01-30T22:50Z,"You seem to think a lot, without even downloading the torrent.
Seeing what kind of crap you're ""selling"" made me think that I can never understand people like you.
See, i don't follow the rules someone told you. 
I don't care about bitrates.
I want when I play the movie on my 46"" LCD to be satisfied with the picture and sound.
Then if I am, I share it to other people who don't want to spend to much hard drive , and sill get an excellent quality ( surely not the best of course) 
More then few hundred, have downloaded this torrent allready with no complaints.
And yet you, who haven't, decided to share your thoughts with us. 
Thanx.
And if you know so much, then please show me a rip up to 4.37gb with a better quality.
(may be one of your DVD rips) 

;-)
