Does anyone else had the same trouble. Did I mess up things?? I had burned the image to a DVD and installed it in a system before uploading it.."

,hoodiboy,2009-12-31T20:56Z,"Hi manu_atjob,

As MandyFA pointed out there is no SP3 for 64bit edition of Win XP. I don't think it needs one - its a whole lot better than the x86 (32bit) edition.

However if you wish to have a SP3 edition of Windows XP x86, I have created one:

,artdecco,2010-02-01T23:56Z,I'm trying to use this to repair a version already installed.Could someone tell me the administrator password? Thanks
,artdecco,2010-03-05T23:40Z,Burned and installed just fine. Updated fine too. Thanks...Just one thing. I posted before That I didn't know the password when I was trying to repair another system. I've installed this version thinking you may have put the password on the desktop or something but I can't find it. What is the administrator password?
