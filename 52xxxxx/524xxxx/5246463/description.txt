This is a Windows XP x64 Professional version which is updated upto Dec 2009. No Tools like Nlite is used. Our aim was to create a version which is fairly stable with no flashy content like the other modified Windows running around. Normal Nlite based modified Windows might show some problems when updating/repairing a current windows setup. So about RockStable - Though we got the final aim of having a pretty stable edition, it has just one problem - its huge size. But we feel that this will be worth it.

And one more thing guys, this edition is for those people who want a Rock Stable OS and not for those guys looking for a blazing fast OS.  

Please note that there is no SP3 version for Windows XP x64. SP3 is only for x86 version of XP.
