Various pictures, mainly of flowers, some of gadgets/technology and pictures of general interest (lightning, fireworks, eye close-ups).
All (about 390) of them have been collected manually, and the quality differs.
I've included a textfile with urls to the source at flickr.

These are CC images, so they can be used freely (you're even allowed to modify and share them, provided you include a link back to the source).
Consult the creative commons website for the exact conditions and not all images have the same CC license (this is visible at the flickr site).

I've also included some masks (psd files), created in photoshop cs4. These masks can also be opened in the latest version of gimp.
