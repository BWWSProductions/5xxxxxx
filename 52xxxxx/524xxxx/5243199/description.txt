~~~~~~~~~~~ SYNOPSIS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the waning days of the Mayan empire, brave hunter Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) lives a simple, contented life with his pregnant wife and young son in a small jungle village. His father, Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead), warns him against fear, but it turns out Jaguar Paw is right to be afraid--one early morning, the sleepy village is ripped apart by invading Holcane warriors. Jaguar Paw thinks fast and hides his family, but they're left stranded when he's captured and marched off with the other survivors to the warriors' chaotic, hellish city. Marked for sacrifice to the priests' bloodthirsty gods, Jaguar Paw manages to evade that grisly fate, only to wind up fleeing for his life through the forest. What follows is a fast-paced, bloody pursuit as Jaguar Paw races against time to save his loved ones--and himself.
