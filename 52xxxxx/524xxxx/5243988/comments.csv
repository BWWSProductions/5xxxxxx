,aldoah,2009-12-30T02:14Z,"Nice torrent, but video freezes as noted previously."
,ostresas,2009-12-30T21:54Z,Same problem with video stopping ~21 mins...
,Hillwalker,2009-12-31T12:42Z,"Yep, same problem: video freezes at 20:45 mins, although audio is still heard.
Shame, as otherwise it's great quality."

,DSXC,2010-05-10T15:20Z,"I had the same issue as the others on here with this torrent and the other one supplied by TvTeam, the video stops at 20:45... quite annoying when trying to watch it for the first time with my daughter.

I was able to get it from this torrent:
