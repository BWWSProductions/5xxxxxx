Secondly, there are huge black bars taking up bits & quality. The true resolution is only 636x322, not 720x480. Thirdly the aspect is off, but not enough to correct it with pre-adjusted widescreen corrections. Fourtly the pieces seem to have different audio formats so merging them to one file without re-encoding is impossible."
