The greatest auto racing movie ever made. Steve McQueen driving the Porsche 917 at over 200MPH. No car film has ever come close to this one. Filmed at real racing speeds, with the best sports car drivers of the 70's. The great Steve McQueen does over 95% of the driving. You will also see otheer cars like Ferrari, Ford GT40, Corvette, Matra, Porsche 911, Porsche Carrera 6, Porsche 914 and many others.

Ripped from a brand new remastered DVD in XViD. Great quality! (My first torrent, hope it works OK)
