Ask and you shall receive.

The Irredeemable collection is up, issues 001-009, here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5247818

I'll do the Guardians of the Galaxy and Nova collections tomorrow.  I'm going to assume that you only want the current runs."
,lifedra,2009-12-31T08:47Z,"thanks for putting out these collections.

any chance you have Black Panther 10? It was supposed to have come out Nov 11 but all the uploads around have 6 and 7 in them instead of 10"

I'm pretty sure this:
Black Panther v4 010 (2009) (noads) (Team-CPS).cbr
is the file you're looking for.
Just copy/paste that file name into Google search and you'll find it."
