"Aggressivity from Stam1na and harmonies from Dream Theater, mixed with twisted pop-melodies and mindflowing arrangements following the footsteps of the crazy canadian metal-professor Devin Townsend. Those are the ingredients for duckmetal, the unique music that is brought to you by the Board of Aves."
