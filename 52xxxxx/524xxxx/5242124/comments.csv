,somosa,2010-06-20T11:26Z,Thanks - but 2 tracks are missing from the Full House album: 'Poor Will And The Jolly Hangman' and 'Sir B.Mckenzie's Daughter's Lament'. Also the 'Holidays' album appears twice and one version seems to be a mish-mash of stuff. The rest is great - although I reckon their first album is pretty poor.
,somosa,2010-06-20T11:37Z,The two missing tracks are actually extras on the Remastered album version - my mistake!
