Jane Burgermeister talks of the mainstream mediaâ€™s role in shaping the public perception of a flu pandemic that is designed to promote an elitist agenda of mass vaccination and centralisation of power.

Jane Burgermeister was born in Switzerland of an Irish mother and an Austrian father. She is a dual Irish/Austrian national and lives in Vienna, Austria.

With an MA Honours degree from Edinburgh University, Scotland, she has written for Nature, the British Medical Journal, The Scientist, Reuters Health, and The Guardian among other publications.

She was European Correspondent for the website of Renewable Energy World, a position from which she was suddenly dismissed in July 2009 after filing a series of criminal charges against Baxter, WHO and others alleging bioterrorism with the intent to commit mass murder.

The focus of the action is an episode in February 2009 when Baxterâ€™s Austrian subsidiary distributed 72 kilos of vaccine material contaminated with live bird flu virus to sixteen laboratories, a case now being investigated by the Austrian police after criminal charges were filed in April 8th in Vienna.

More charges were filed with the FBI (US embassy, Vienna) in June.

Canadian doctor Ghislaine Lanctot â€” who has written a book, The Medical MafiaÂ´â€“ supported these charges against the WHO, the UN, and several high ranking government and corporate officials.
