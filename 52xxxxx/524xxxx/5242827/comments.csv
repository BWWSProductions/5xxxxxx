,ps1080p,2009-12-26T19:20Z,"HR, I am using your handheld-video script to learn how to do this myself.  I have encoded one movie using the examples in the help file, but I don't know what flag to set to get the video to 480x272 or whatever is best for the psp screen.  I used psp480 on my test encode, but I would like the movie to be specifically for the psp screen (that is, I don't care about video out to a TV).  Can you please tell me the correct flag to set?  Thanks."

HolyRoses IS the definition of badass.
