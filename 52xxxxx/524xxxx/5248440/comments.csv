,Vivid86,2009-12-31T07:57Z,Ok so anything I should know about this?  All fit to play online?  I have crysis already this a patch or a fill version?  Thanks
,Vivid86,2010-01-01T09:38Z,Too bad it all comes up not in english  ???   Whats up with that
,Soondead,2010-01-03T17:00Z,"This is Russian, not english. 

Oh and autorun.exe contains a trojan, but what else did you expect from a FAKE?"
,gamerguy1,2010-01-03T19:12Z,uh...hello the information is according to the real uploader and this is not fake.
,gamerguy1,2010-01-03T19:15Z,and yeah the autorun.That is not a virus.Most of cracked things are picked up by an antivirus as virus so What do you expect from cracked softwares.
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-01-04T14:31Z,"You also need like 30 minutes to unpack the whole game, lol.

The worst part of it, is that the installer shows that the unpack is complete because it has the full green, I was like WTF is this, currently 3.5GB on directory, 1GB to go"
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-01-04T14:47Z,"Well, I have good news and bad ones:

Good:
1) Game installs perfectly 
2) Last version (1.5)
3) No virus
4) Pre-cracked
5) English

Bad:
1) Hard to change language for average computer user
2) No serial
3) No cracked servers
4) Long ass install

This is just the RIP of the game, you need a serial key anyways...

To change to English, go to Localized folder in the directory, there are 3 files for english and 3 for russian, erase russian files, and change the name of the english's ones to russian."
