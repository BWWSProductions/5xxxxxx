,i_am_an_alien,2010-03-03T22:38Z,"My taskbar icon turned orange and said i had 14 more days left. I used this and it gave me 3 more months. It does work for those who say it doesn't. It just doesn't give you much more time, but at least I have enough time now to look for another key that lasts longer. Thanks uploader. "
