,321Rik123,2010-01-14T23:57Z,"jordiadr,
i got a problem, i've been using zero gear since the begining and i'm very pleased with all your support especially after your update to the 1.0.72 but right now i've got the same problem i had when i was using the 1.0.66 only now with the 1.0.72 patch wich i've been using effectively for quite some time now. everything works fine the game starts using steam, but when i try 'find game' it just says looking for 7 more players and does nothing, for ever.
have you got any suggestions? "
,321Rik123,2010-01-15T00:23Z,"found some other guy with the same problem, starting too look like there is a new patch, is this tru or have they busted our asses?
ps. it started about 2 hours ago or something."
,321Rik123,2010-01-15T17:25Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5246007/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_2_MP_Crack_(1.0.166_1.0.172_1.0.174)

i've tried it and it worked all i needed to do was change the zerogear.bat file to start mw2.174.exe.
and i needed to place my iw_17.iw file back in the main folder."
,321Rik123,2010-01-15T22:52Z,"damn they've blocked it again or whatever, at least what i linked dont work no more..."
,PoshRocks,2010-01-18T01:31Z,"rats... doesnt work anymore!! :(

,jordiadr,2010-01-21T11:58Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5296318
