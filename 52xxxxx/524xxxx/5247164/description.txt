Gentle Giant was one of the most important bands in progressive rock history.

As extremely talented multi-instrumentalists they combined blues, rock, jazz,
modern chamber and avantgarde elements, mediaeval sounds, polyrhythms, polyphonic instrumentation and chantings to a unique melange not always easy to digest. 

At the beginning of the eighties GG resigned from music business but their devise is exceptional. Often copied but never reached they're highly requested by progressive rock fans all over the world still today.
