Excellent upload, by the way ;"

Make a spectral analysis or at least listen with your ears.
All files are FLAC's from PCM/Wave files.
Audiochecker?? Fuck it!!"
[T],lonesomecowboy,2009-12-29T19:49Z,"Due to problems with the upload server at Piratebay we'll have to wait a little for the next albums.
Please be patient."
[T],lonesomecowboy,2009-12-30T13:43Z,"Upload server ist still down.
Try following Magnet Link:

magnet:?xt=urn:btih:BE23C5461E26A4AF079EB05D153D1C0A65EC07B0&dn=Gentle+Giant+-+12+Albums+%285-8%29&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%2Fannounce

I don't know, if it works. It's only a try."
,OtaOta,2009-12-30T15:11Z,"It works, it's OK. Thank you."
,canadianice,2009-12-30T20:35Z,"why is the upload server down, this long?"
