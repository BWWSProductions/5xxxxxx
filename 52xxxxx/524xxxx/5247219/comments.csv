do you also have pink floyd?"
,mrvain32,2010-01-21T19:29Z,"This is not about this torrent but the ones I've downloaded.(quite a lot from you)
The quality is amazing. CBR320kbps. Even lots of covers included. The one thing that it lags is track sequencing. The songs are all mixed up as its not numerically aligned.
If its too much then no prob. Anyway thanks for great uploads. Keep it up."

=================================
They are not mixed up mate, they are just lacking the Track numbers. 
I usually set up my folders to display the following tabs,
Name - Artists - Album - #(Number) - Gener - Size - Bit Rate - Year
Just click a tab in what order you want.
When you drop and drag the folder into your music player, i use I-tunes all tracks will be numbered correctly.
This is the way i choose to do it, everyone has their own ideas on the best way, but i prefer to be different.
Besides that inconvience to you thanks for taking the time to comment and hopefully you will continue to enjoy the torrents

[V],only1joe,2010-02-21T20:09Z,"Jeffaits - what exactly is the trouble you are having.

I made the torrent using u-torrent.
All mp3s made using i-tunes

Try re-downloading
Or re-boot your computer
