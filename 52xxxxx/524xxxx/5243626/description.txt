The Original and uncut..
Caprica, Pilot, Extended DVD RiP..

This aired earlier this year, IMO, it actually explains more about BSG than the last BSG movie that was released...

I think this show is going to ROCK... SyFy is planning to release a modified Pilot on 1/22/10, hopefully they wont bastardize it to much. When I read about it I decided to re-up the original so those of you BSG fans that havent gotten a chance to see it can grab it..

Heres a little info..
*****************************************
Set 58 years before Battlestar Galactica, Caprica follows two rival families - the Graystones and the Adamas - as they grow, compete, and thrive in the vibrant world of the peaceful 12 Colonies, living in a society close to our own. Entangled in the burgeoning technology of artificial intelligence and robotics that will eventually lead to the creation of the Cylons, the two houses go toe-to-toe, blending action with corporate conspiracy and sexual politics. Caprica will deliver, intrigue, political backbiting and family conflict in television's first science fiction family saga.

Daniel Graystone, a computer genius, is owner of a large computer corporation that is spearheading the development of artificial intelligence. He and his wife Amanda, who's a brilliant surgeon, are both relentless in their scientific pursuits. The Adama clan is helmed by Joseph Adama, a renowned criminal defense attorney and father of future Battlestar commander William Adama. When tragedy strikes both families, lines are drawn that will determine the fate of the human race.
