That aside, why bother uploading another version of the original - when what we could really use is a decent version of the sequel!!!

There has to be a decent TS somewhere... if not a SCR version I heard rumors about being on IRC - you'd really impress me if you posted a TS without Hardcoded subs, not to menttion how amazed I'd be if you locate a legit SCR or RIP... 


I say this applies to anyone reading this post right now... maybe if enough people start looking for a good version of that movie we can get it available sooner!!!"
[V],raymondhome,2009-12-31T10:52Z,if it was 720p the resolution should be 1280 instead of 720...they probably made a mistake labeling the folder or torrent
,ZenRhino,2009-12-31T19:49Z,"just curious... not that I didn't trust ya! sometimes people try upping a file they got somewhere else while thinking they can pass it off as their own work... most times these people don't think to see how the original user labeled the file/torrent that proves where it really came from. How many times have you seen a group go off on someone doing just that?

I already have a 1080p version... just getting anxious for a decent version of the sequel to keep me going until a high quality one gets out."
[V],raymondhome,2010-01-03T09:51Z,sorry what i mean is they mislabeled it as 720p should be 480p instead...based on the resolution :)
,gettinlit420,2010-01-25T18:43Z,is there a reason why there aint a single upload of the new boondock saints movie all saints day ???

,TheGoodDr,2010-08-06T02:39Z,720p chugs if your using XBMC (Xbox Media Center) and 480p doesn't.  just a thought
