We now bring you a lovely song addition to the Michael Rizzo Chessman
karaoke collection, in DivX excluding vocals. 

640X480 1000k video bitrate 192k audio


We purchased the 192k mp3 for ten bucks on the internet at a German website
as the cost of a single download of this "karaoke backing" offering.

This version is meant for those that are familiar enough with the song so as to do it complete justice as it is. We have used the Berliner font which will be confusing for some who dont know the words and lettering and in addition, there is a spot in the middle of the playback where you have to improvise somewhat as the music seems to linger in accompaniament whithout offering a real guide as it were.

Nevertheless, it is one of the greatest songs ever written, and about the beauty of which we know no equal - Germanic spirited!

To learn the song if you dont already know it, you should downlod our
concert clip version which as lyrics on-screen along with brilliant 
vocals too!
