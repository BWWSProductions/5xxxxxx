Description: Imagine a country where reality exceeds imagination. Imagine a country surrounded by a zone of hostilities, and somehow miraculously preserved the serene world. Imagine a country where the official religion - Islam, but the sale of alcohol and prostitution flourish. Imagine a city that emerged from the desert for one night, like a mirage, thanks to the hard work of hired workers. Imagine a place unlike any other record.
