	When Madea catches sixteen-year-old Jennifer and her two younger brothers
	looting her home, she decides to take matters into her own hands and 
	delivers the young delinquents to the only relative they have: their 
	aunt April. A heavy-drinking nightclub singer who lives off of Raymond, 
	her married boyfriend, April wants nothing to do with the kids. But 
	her attitude begins to change when Sandino, a handsome Mexican immigrant 
	looking for work, moves into April's basement room. Making amends for 
	his own troubled past, Sandino challenges April to open her heart. And 
	April soon realizes she must make the biggest choice of her life: between 
	her old ways with Raymond and the new possibilities of family, faith ... 
	and even true love.
