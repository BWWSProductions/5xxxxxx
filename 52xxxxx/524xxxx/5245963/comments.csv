,xiphos29,2010-01-05T06:49Z,don't waste your bandwidth on this. trust me
,HOT-LIPS,2010-01-05T10:43Z," I WISH TO DOWNLOAD THIS,
WOULD SOME YOU GUY S LEAVE A COMMEMT ON THIS UPLOAD.


                              HELP OTHERS."
,wzx3000,2010-01-06T01:36Z,"The quality is the best soo far. You might want to view it in VLC since the audio might be a bit out of sync at some times. 

And ignore the german audio in the beginning. The original audio is returned after a minute or so. 

You might want to download english subtitles for the Na'vi dialogs.

The audio is not very good in the beginning, but it is better later on.

A great torrent, and as I said, the best avatar-TS so far."
,tikitiki4ladyz,2010-01-06T02:49Z,is this good quality
,PapaDragon,2010-01-06T02:58Z,"OK. A: 9 V: 8    Overall, great quality in my opinion. It starts off kinda iffy in the very beginning but it gets better later. there are small sequences out of sync but it corrects itself after a short time."
,SummerEnd07,2010-01-06T06:05Z,"anyoNe care 4 a subtitles, download it here 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5261717/Avatar_2009_movie_Subtitles_FULL"
,CheeseAndTomato,2010-01-06T14:10Z,"Very happy with the qulity. Sound and picture 9/10. German subtitles in small part, but actions of characters indicates what they are saying anyway. Worth downloading."
,Cameigons,2010-01-06T18:05Z," A: 9 V: 8. As PapaDragon said, about a handful of times it goes out of sync, but it's very short periods, matter of seconds. Other than that great quality in my opinion too... I don't know about the other ones coming out out there, but this is one was good enough for me."
[T],dramacore,2010-01-06T20:21Z,thanks
,torrentpower__94,2010-01-08T14:54Z,thx for the great up...=)
,casino9876,2010-01-09T17:38Z,"best version of avatar out there + with english subtitles lol

had to rename the subtitle file to exact same as the AVI file, dont know why they was named differently

A:8
V:8"
,casino9876,2010-01-09T17:40Z,p.s. better video and audio than either of the Xvids above this with more seeds
,burnok100,2010-01-11T04:56Z,i could not DL the torrent file. Server error. 
,nice_assu,2010-01-12T10:25Z,To ts is pretty pretty good.
,poison-boy-1992,2010-01-13T05:19Z,they didnt speak a word of engish 
,zsxzsxzsx,2010-01-14T04:42Z,"goooood 

A=8

V=9"
,iray8t,2010-01-14T11:55Z,"By far the best version up as of this moment. Still a TS though.
For a TS: A:9 V:9
Overall: A:8 V:7
If this were any other movie that didn't depend so much on CGI and visuals overall I'd say you should watch it. But being so special, even in 2D, I'd suggest to wait for a good DVD rip.
Nice effort though. Thanks!"
,Quickie582,2010-01-14T15:44Z,"A/9

A little bit of German SUBS but it doesn't spoil the movie"

,orwellenator,2010-01-18T18:26Z,Thanx Akhen1 for that upload much appreciated.
,orwellenator,2010-01-18T18:46Z,"I download about 5 fakes before I find this one.
This is the real deal. There is some german audio at the beginning but after 1 minute it is all the original english sound.  The video quality is the best you can get for now I rate it with 8 out of 10 and the audio with 8 as well. Great work this upload and I would recommend to see the 3D version in a cinema as well the pictures in this movie are awesome.  But for a free version this is the best you can get for now I am sure.
I am not a spamer or some arshole who did not see it.  I got this and looked at it from start to end it is great, thanx very much again."
,orwellenator,2010-01-19T05:47Z,LoveGzi stop this SPAM you fuckn moron.

,ThatNYCGuy,2010-02-03T10:48Z,"Why do ppl always comment with retarded shit like little baby bitches??? Just say what the video and audio quality is and a brief description of the two... Thats easier than acting like a bunch of pansy ass hookers with PMS, ffs grow up and start rating shit like you should or go hang yourself."

,Video_Veg,2010-02-14T09:26Z,"This was my first 'CAM' download, because it will likely be a year before DVD comes out, and was curious what quality to expect.
I am very impressed (with this one at least), even the sound is good.
Thanks Akhen1 and all seeders.
ps: Get subtitles from 'knickerbockers' listed above."
