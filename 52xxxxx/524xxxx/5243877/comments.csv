just asking because i dont see how any file manages to reach 300+ seeds in a half hour"
,jeff696969,2009-12-27T22:22Z,I always wondeer that too. The only thing I can figure is that it's had a head start on other torrent sites before getting uploaded here finally.

,Mallion,2010-01-04T01:07Z,"This movie was quite a refreshing take on the norm. Movies so often follow a set of guidelines that viewers can often predict where they're going before they ever even get there. It really is worth watching if you have an open mind. If however you find yourself revolted by the very idea of someone questioning moral fabric, this is just going to piss you off.
I can't comment on the quality as I watched another version that was downloaded from another seeder. That upload though got a LOT of flack from religious nuts so I just wanted to get a post in here early on this one to let you know it's not the greatest movie ever made, but definitely worth seeing."
,lonnieb83,2010-01-05T07:15Z,Thanks for the upload!
,niceworkbuddy,2010-01-05T22:13Z,"The quality is terrible. the movie breaks up and pauses for 5 - 10 seconds at a time. Plus, this movie is just aweful, and i'm the biggest Ricky Gervais fan. I think Ghost Town was better...."

,Costiputza,2010-01-09T13:50Z," Thanks for the upload. Good quality V=8, A=9 and good download rate 1,8-2 Mb/s. And it's a real torrent, no joke, no fake!"
,Lemberg,2010-01-09T17:18Z,"I was going to watch this movie because I haven't seen any new comedies lately that have been good, and Louis C.K. is in this one, but I read a little about the plot and figured he probably said yes to this movie just to appear amongst other famous names. The plot seems retarded. ""Set in a world where no one can lie."" Sound like a typical empty Hollywood bullshit movie, like most they produce over there. But trying to push Christianity on the public through movies isn't considered desperate and shallow in the US, so I guess such movies make millions over there. They may have all the special effects and the planet's greatest equipment stored in that particular space, but all these overproduced mainstream movies with shitty story lines, and big stars who appear in the movies only for their underwear catalog looks need to go... Think I'll watch Monty Python's Life of Brian instead. Now, there's a quality script."

,MattGo74,2010-01-24T03:37Z,The uploaders who have a skull next to their name you can definitely trust. Sometimes they have tens of  thousands of seeders like the next day for certain things.
,xsaintxjames,2010-02-09T02:05Z,"9/9
Decent movie - I was initially thrown off by comments about ""unbelievers loving it.""  I believe in Jesus and God, and still liked this movie - The philosophy behind this movie in fun and interesting - but is fiction, and could only work in its own world.  Its a fun film - and I love R. Gervais."

,JxOx,2010-04-10T03:13Z,raymondhome - I was wondering if you could shoot me an email? I need some help and I think you'd be able to help me. Thanks. Jer.Ortman@gmail.com

,ozric666,2010-11-16T23:48Z,"@xsaintxjames

are you for real ffs you believe in jesus and god lmfao i suggest you go watch religulous http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4683591/Religulous%5B2008%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D-FXG
i mean you realise the the jesus story is just a rip off of horus (2ooo yrs b4 him) and krishna(900 yrs b4 him) ffs i wish ppl would grow up and come to thier senses and work out religion is just a scam 

btw A:9 V:9 M:5"
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2011-02-15T14:50Z,"OMG, ozric666: Religulous was soooo good. For the life of my I can't recall the comedians name that hosted and starred in it, but it was good. Just an account of him going around and asking religious people why they believe the way they do and challenging them with questions that any sane, free thinking person would ask in their search for clarification.

He gets a bit out of hand at times and you do not feel for when he is being thrown out of the various religious arenas, but over all...it was very cohesive.

Before people begin their bitching, The invention of lying is also very good. The subject matter was a great idea for a movie... no matter what you believe in, you have to admit this."
