                      http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1252596                 
                                                                          
                                                    
                          
                             
                                 
                                                                          
           Prem's (Ranbir Kapoor) strategy in life were very simple       
           - be happy...make others happy...keep the town happy...        
           But these supposedly simple strategy usually results in        
           disastrous consequences for Prem, and the members of his       
           Happy Club and the town!                                       
           It may have been a case of mistaken identity that led          
           Prem to kidnap Jenny (Katrina Kaif). And it was sheer          
           greed that made Prem try to pull a fast one over her           
           father. As for sweet and simple Jenny, brought up by           
           indifferent and uncaring parents, all she longed was to        
           love and be loved in return.                                   
                                                                          
           And it was love and only love for Jenny that made Prem         
           turn over a new leaf. From hardly working vagabond Prem        
           began working hard to make money... From a besotted            
           Romeo, he becomes a mature and thoughtful Majnu who put        
           Jenny's happiness above everything else...As for               
           Jenny...she loves Rahul (Upen Patel). That's when she          
           realises that she had made a mistake with realizing who        
           she really loves.
