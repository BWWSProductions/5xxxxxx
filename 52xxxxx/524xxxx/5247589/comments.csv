,TheColdTruth,2010-03-21T05:23Z,"Tried another 5.8.8 torrent, but because of a lack of seeders that went nowhere fast.  Fortunately you can still download the older (working) version of this from the main eraser website, which is hosted off of sourceforge.  Here's a link for those of you who want a WORKING version of eraser:
