Voice & sound good

Converted & burnt with AVS Video Converter 6 which I got off Piratebay using the following torrent:
 ""AVS_Video_Converter_6.3.1.367(latest)-crack_incl"". 

Just paste this into the search, untick ""Audio"", ""Video"", ""Applications"" etc & select ""All"" in the drop-box & it should come up. 

Thanks to everyone for sharing."

Comeon guys you are downloading the releases because of the quality the uploader provides us."

,RoreagaStyles,2010-02-05T21:39Z,"firstly thanx to mkv guy. downloaded many of your films & very happy with size & quality =) -->Nuthinbetr2do - I use vlc & it plays all these mkv's perfectly. You may need to update your version for the right codecs... Only thing left to say is I didn't like this movie at all... Rubbish! I agree with -->meluckee cos I thought district 9 was wicked, most original film in years, but this film doesn't even come close!"
,surajitghosh37,2010-02-06T19:28Z,"wonderful movie,probably among the best 5 of this year"
,quaternio,2010-02-18T05:19Z,"Finally, someone who uses these codecs properly. I wonder why this kind of compression isn't yet the norm. Thanks a lot!"
