,AdmiralJackSparrow,2011-11-23T18:24Z,"Hello, just joined the site (not to mention found) it via Google, been looking for a long time for a place that has these types of pirate/ship games. I do have one question though. Why is it sometimes these torrent downloads refuse to connect? I'm actually new to torrents but I have this thing BitTornado it helps out =D

to djDEVASTATE2009 many thanks for uploading this, sadly I failed to land a solid torrent for Age of Pirates (appearantly lots of them are buggy and or worse)."
