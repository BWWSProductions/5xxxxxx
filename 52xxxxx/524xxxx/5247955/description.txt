NOTE: Only download the .m4a file if you wish to use the AAC 5.1 audio.

From now on Subs will not be embedded unless it is critical to the movie for the english speaking audience.  Subs break front row playback.  Or at least until apps have been updated to handle subs with front row, itunes, quicktime, and apple tv at the same time.

For WDTV Live change extension from .m4v to .mp4
You may also need to rename to .mp4 if you are playing off a USB drive on the PS3.  Should be fine if you are just streaming.

Use batch script "Make AAC 5.1.cmd" to make MP4 have AAC5.1 Audio.
