,iSmell,2010-01-04T03:11Z,"Hey HR Thanks for the upload I am just wondering with the newer Audio you have been doing when I am burning the to a disk I use DVD Flick and it lets me see the that there are 2 audio selections the only difference in them is one is usually 6 channel and the other is 2 channel. I have been using the 6 channel one because I have 5.1 dolby digital surround, does that sound right? And just to let you know how awesome your u/l's are i have an entire file dedicated to you where i keep all the HQ d/l's so thanks again, I love not needing to check comments to know if its good or not.

A very good conversion for this movie yet when it comes to size and quality, for a HD release. The only thing thats missing in the begining is the Quote which is in German and not English, that quote is what sets the mood for the rest of the film to come. So if you have seen this movie before and know the quote then no problem watch this release cause it's one helluva HD to watch on the ps3 and if you have not seen the file and you downloaded this version first then go to wikipedia to read the quote by Chris Hedges and then start viewing it. If some one remembers it add it here so its easier for the person downloading it to read and then view. Thanks HR for a hrad to find release that's in HD and not as large in size and near perfect quality that works on the ps3!"
,Critic_101,2010-01-07T21:07Z,This HD version by HR brings the movie to life but the only thing thats annoying is the german text if that was in English then wow! Must have been ripped from a german source bluray. Still an amazing HD conversion. Audio track is in English.

,Extrememadman88,2010-01-23T06:23Z,"HR thanks for the download v/10 a/10 really good download, movies good too "
,Jack_Raiden,2010-02-06T09:10Z,"Yes indeed, the only thing holding this release back from perfection is THUGLiNE's German BD source;  only 5-6 hard GER titles, though. Audio is absolutely perfect: 5.1 AC3 + 5.1 AAC (with extremely sufficient bitrate)! Thanks HolyRoses, seeders, everyone."

,CrimsonRush,2012-04-07T05:34Z,"@weerab1981 Thats the title of the book its from.

The actual quote is:
""The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug."" - Chris Hedges

The its fades to: ""for war is a drug."""
