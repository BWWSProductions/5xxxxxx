1. Did i need all previous versions, cause i already installed this one?
2. I got kicked out everytime i get in a game, but not like the old problem, i dont get to play at all."
,FTL3,2009-12-29T02:11Z,"this works for 2.0.0.1 all the way to 2.0.0.6, patches to 2.0.0.7"
,macravin,2009-12-30T23:14Z,"http://teamftl.sitesled.com/ ? Is that you, it's in Japanese. It seeded pretty fast!"
,Samvete,2010-01-02T18:01Z,This doesn't contain the patch.
,nokiahaler,2010-01-11T10:33Z,how does this work? i have installed the 2.0.0.5 patch that you uploaded and now what? do we just overwrite everything with the files from this torrent?
,mr357magnum,2011-04-03T14:32Z,"If you get an error saying ""MODE NOT SUPPORTED"" because your monitor or TV does not support the Games Default Resolution, then here is the fix:

All you have to do is, go to your shortcut on the desktop, right click go to properties. There should be text ""Target"" and next to it a line of coding like this ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" 

Change ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" to ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" -w 1024 -h 768 or what ever your Monitor or TV Supports.

That should force it to start up with those dimensions. Also if you wanna skip the video in the beginning, type -novid after -h 768
