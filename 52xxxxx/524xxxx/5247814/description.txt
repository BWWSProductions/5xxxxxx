I watched the R5 release when it came out and i like this movie
(I usually like zombie movies), it was a nice change from the
standard zombie movies that we usually see. As for the quality,
well as you would expect from a 1CD-DvDRip, it's pretty nice.

"The horror comedy Zombieland focuses on two men who have
found a way to survive a world overrun by zombies. Columbus
is a big wuss â€” but when youâ€™re afraid of being eaten by zombies,
fear can keep you alive. Tallahassee is an AK-toting, zombie-slayingâ€™
bad ass whose single determination is to get the last Twinkie on Earth.
As they join forces with Wichita and Little Rock, who have also found
unique ways to survive the zombie mayhem, they will have to determine
which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombies."-IMDB
