UserGate is a complex solution for sharing Internet access among employees in your company, making traffic calculations, and protecting your local network against malicious activity and software, such as hacker attacks, viruses and Trojans. UserGate is a flexible yet very powerful program that can be used in small- and mid-sized companies instead of relying on large and expensive hardware or software alternatives. With UserGate, you can enforce as strict an Internet access policy as you want, to ensure that the Internet is used appropriately in your company. The integrated BrightCloud Service allows you to apply web filters, and helps boost employee productivity by giving you total control over what sites your employees can access.

UserGate incorporates NAT and application-layer proxy capabilities and works as a point of entry to the Internet for a local network. You can share Internet access among employees in your company, use multiple ISPs, and manage traffic to avoid traffic congestion and make effective use of an existing Internet connection. With DHCP server support, you can make UserGate dynamically assign IP-addresses in your local network. The resource publishing feature enables you to provide access to your companys internet resources from the outside. Finally, UserGate is capable of working with multiple ISPs, switching users to the secondary connection when the primary connection is broken, as well as routing different users to different ISPs.
