,bokehjoe,2011-03-23T06:58Z,"maelstrom: Thnks for the upload. Can't wait to look at the fonts. I use fonts extensively and am always looking for ones I don't have. 

dommels: YES- you can get in trouble using copyrighted fonts. You really only need to worry if you are using them in some form or fashion for monetary gain. i.e. making flyers/ business cards from your business. Otherwise you are pretty likely ok. "
,blasteu,2011-07-21T18:55Z,"Warning for mac users: do no download and unrar that file. Even a single click-get info on some fonts will cause trouble in Safari browser . Big trouble. Defaults fonts are change and browser become unreadable. The computer itself become very slow. The problem come from Enigma fonts contained in this file a quick research on google lead to the creator, Brian Kent , internet woker from norwich, NY. He seems to be the owner of www.norwich.net . It seems also that the contact info in the font kentpw@norwich.net leads to a pishing website, according to Safari. Tested on windows antivirus, it gives nothing.
You are warned."
,blasteu,2011-07-21T19:16Z,"Strangely when we right click on ?nigma Scrawl (BRK).ttf to get info , then right click to on kentpw@norwich.net it proposes to open url...http://kentpw@norwich.net/ leads to a pishing site. It is more likely to be a Safari bug than anything else.
But I confirm that font render Safari unreadable by times.
Do not load it anyway."
,nidluv,2012-05-31T08:13Z,arabic font include here?
