           King Odysseus has been away from Ithaca for twenty years.      
           The first ten he spent fighting the Trojan War; the last       
           ten he spent fighting to get home. Among his adventures        
           is the tale Homer felt was too horrible to tell, the           
           missing book of the Odyssey known as "The Isle of the          
           Mists". Here the Warrior King and his men face the             
           Goddess of the Underworld and her winged horrific              
           creatures, intent on bringing death and destruction to         
           humanity.
