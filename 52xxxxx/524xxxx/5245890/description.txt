Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century is a 26-episode animated television series placing Sherlock Holmes in a science fiction setting taking place in the 22nd century. Many episodes are direct rewrites of the original stories by Arthur Conan Doyleâ€”such as "The Empty House", "The Speckled Band", "The Five Orange Pips", "The Red-Headed League", and "The Engineer's Thumb" â€” while others are drastically different from the stories they're supposed to be based on. The series itself seems to be a sciâ€“fi pastiche. (source: Wikipedia)

This torrent has all 26 episodes of the show (fairly good tv rips with a few dvd rips).

Okay, yes, this show sounds stupid, but it's surprisingly fun. If you're a mystery fan, you should check it out.

And please seed! I have a limited amount of bandwidth so I can't seed forever.
