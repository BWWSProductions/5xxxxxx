On the band's highly anticipated 2006 album, THE OPEN DOOR, Evanescence presents the full-length studio debut of its new line-up, after the departure of founding guitarist Ben Moody and the addition of six-stringer Terry Balsamo. While this ... Full Descriptionouting isn't a radical sonic departure for the goth-leaning heavy-rock band, the change clearly allowed vocalist Amy Lee to take the creative reins, and indulge even more in her flair for the ornate and dramatic, as evidenced by DOOR's fairy tale-like artwork and urgent first single, "Call Me When You're Sober," which finds the singer cutting loose with her powerfully expressive voice. Fans worried about major stylistic shifts from Evanescence will be relieved by this confident release, which logically furthers previous album FALLEN's brooding alternative-metal sound.
