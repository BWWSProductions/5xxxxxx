I have used the forum now and then, but i just got into porting, so i really dont know anyone yet.

I just thought it would be a nice challenge :)

And yes, Z Steel Soldiers is a great game.
Loved the first one too :)"

,80sCop,2011-12-04T11:36Z,"Just downloaded this, really excited to play it as I was a big fan of both of the originals.

I don't know much about porting, so any advice people can give about getting this to run would be great.

I'm running OS 10.6.8 (Leopard on an intel mac) and at the moment, the dmg file mounts fine, I've copied the app file over, but when launched it crashes after resizing my screen and flashing a few times. No error message.

Thanks."
