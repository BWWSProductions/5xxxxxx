"Movie starring Dennis Weaver as a blue-collar worker who never learned to read, but has fooled everyone in his life (including his own family) that he could. Things come to a head when he is promoted to foreman at work, but must learn to use a computer, and also when he almost caused the death of someone on a highway because he could not read a sign. Weaver is quite sympathetic and you really feel for his character. The little details of how he bluffs his way through life fill you with anxiety as you hope that no one will notice his fatal flaw."
