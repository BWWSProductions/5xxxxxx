One of Those Malibu Nights (One Night in Malibu) by Elizabeth Adler (2008)

New York Times Bestselling Author of Meet Me in Venice

It was just one of those Malibu nights, dark as a velvet shroud, creamy waves crashing onto the shore, breeze soft as a kitten's breath....

But when Private Investigator to the stars, Mac Reilly, hears the sound of a woman's scream over the crashing waves, his low-key beach-bum lifestyle is changed forever. A beautiful, distraught woman wearing only a black lace negligee stands in the doorway of a fabulous beach house. In her hand, a gun, and it's pointed directly at him.
