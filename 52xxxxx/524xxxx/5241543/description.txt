And i have included for activation:

RemoveWAT 2.1  :
A little tool I put together to remove WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) completely from the OS, while still remaining   status and 

Receiving all updates (optional aswell). You can also pass the Genuine check in things like Windows Defender.

There will be no Windows Activation section in Control Panel (thanks to nononsence)

no slmgr - so there is no risk your Windows will hang on boot time ;

no nags, no prompts, nothing. WAT gone.
