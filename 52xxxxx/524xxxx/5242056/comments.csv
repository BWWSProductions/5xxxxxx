That's too bad, it's useless to me.

[V],phatwarez,2010-02-03T08:21Z,"lol? This plays fine with vlc. If your trying to play this on your hdtv, then you should have figured out the only way mixing internet/hdtv is through a mediacenter pc. I suggest a zotac atom barebones kit."
,rshudson,2010-06-04T22:39Z,"VLC plays MKV fine. You're going to have to accept the format if you want to be downloading any worthwhile HD vids. Probably 49 out of every 50 BD rips on the net are MKV. If you need to stream them to your TV or something and WMP can't do it, use TVersity. It's free."
,willdrumz,2010-06-28T02:32Z,"mkv is the only way to go. Works on Boxee too. Here's the correct setup:
Mac Mini + VLC +HDMI cable + HDTV = Awesome. Anything else is just stupid. Yes especially windows."

A/10 V/10. Must see for all."
,mcordell,2010-10-03T03:59Z,"Great quality seeders! Only 57 and I'm getting 175 kb/s! Expected seeds close to 75 kb/s!  Note: I get around 1.5 MB/s on a torrent with over 100 seeders.

Quality is nice, obviously, because it's 720p.  Great documentary!  Good shows on the History Channel are rare now because they now show shit shows like ""Life After People"" and ""Doomsday"" which have nothing to do about History.
