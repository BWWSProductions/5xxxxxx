No RAR, No Password - just the movie
"One time SCENE group â€˜MerryChristmasâ€ have released the DVDRip of the 2009 drama Dorian Gray. The film revolves around a corrupt young man, who somehow keeps his youthful beauty eternally, but a special painting gradually reveals his inner ugliness to all. Ratings have been quite average for this film, but take a look at the trailer. Oh, and merry Christmas to everyone! Enjoy the release!

Fresh-faced and innocent, Dorian Gray arrives in London to move into the house he has inherited. Almost immediately he falls under the influence of amoral and calculating Lord Henry Wotton, leading to a life of increasing debauchery and even violence. Through many years Gray stays as young-looking as ever, while a portrait painted when he arrived grows old, reflecting his increasing excesses. Eventually the picture, now secreted in his attic, becomes almost hideous to behold. When true love finally enters his life he realises he must guard his secret at all costs.A naÃ¯ve young man. A lovelorn artist. A corruptible Lord. A deal with the Devil." -rlslog.net
