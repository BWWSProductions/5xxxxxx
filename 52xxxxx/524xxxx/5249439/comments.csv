,autumn4ever,2010-01-11T19:56Z,"First time I do not scan a download with an antivirus... And during instalation, I had many problems... Trojans, dropper,...
Maybe it has nothing to do with this file (I was also on the net... But I was on Amazon, so... It's strange to think I got viruses while surfing on this website. :-/ ), but... Be careful.
(oh and my laptop doesn't want to reboot, since tryed to instal this game... Got 7-8 viruses.)

Whatever... Be careful, that's the point. :)"
