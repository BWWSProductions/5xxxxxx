@sunybwaj, currently m downloading it and as its an old one m getting a very slow speed, as soon it gets finishes I will post it..

@itsjennie, MKV/MP4/AVI are containers, XVID/DIVX/x264 are codecs..
MKV accepts almost all the audio and video combination.

[V],MKVGuy,2009-12-31T02:12Z,"@justregged, no just here and earlier on m-ininova, but planning to start on 3-4 more websites to increase the seeders.."
,Rod321,2009-12-31T06:04Z,"For Dreamer1986:
I know very little so lets see if this is of any help.
I copied this out of the AVS Video Converter which I obtained a few days ago:

Friendly interface, a variety of supported formats and features and high performance make AVS Video Converter one of the best available on the market today.

With the help of AVS Video Converter you can:

convert video between almost any formats: HD Video (inc. AVCHD, MPEG-2 HD and WMV HD), TOD, MOD, M2TS, AVI (DivX, Xvid, etc.), MP4 (inc. Sony PSP and Apple iPod), WMV, 3GP, QuickTime (MOV, QT), SWF, DVD, VOB, VRO, MPEG-1, 2, 4, H.263, H.264, Real Video, DVR-MS, MKV, FLV (see a full list of Supported Formats here); 

Below is the address for the torrent to download AVS. Just copy & paste it into Pirate Bay. Be sure to untick Audio, Video, Applications, Games & Other & ensure All is selected in the drop box & the Torrent should come up - I just retested it now. You will find instructions in there by KUTHUMI & then my modified version below his.
This is the address, paste all of it in the search box:
AVS_Video_Converter_6.3.1.367(latest)-crack_incl"

[V],prashant22,2009-12-31T12:31Z,"also plz upload ""The Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans"""
,muk0690,2009-12-31T14:27Z,"Why dont u do it in mp4...?
To my knowledge, it gives more bitrate n quality compared to mkv..."
,muk0690,2009-12-31T14:46Z,Pls upload The Hurt Locker....
,muk0690,2009-12-31T14:50Z,Pls increase the bitrate or decrease the resolution to get more quality.... 
,justregged,2009-12-31T19:01Z,"ok thanks, muk0690 if you dont know what your talkin about best to just keep quiet"
,Rod321,2010-01-01T03:25Z,"I converted & burnt this movie with 'AVS Converter 6' but the voices & lips are not in sync. I then burnt the AVS video files with Nero but that didn't help.
I also downloaded Moon with the same result.
The voices & visuals are okay.

Any suggestions please??

I love the smaller 400MiB downloads."
[V],prashant22,2010-01-01T07:43Z,"plz upload ""The Time Traveler's Wife"""
,vrthenite,2010-01-01T13:14Z,hey Rod321 sound sync is a problem sometimes. if want convert using avs or something like that. Better if you convert to dvd using Convertxtodvd. then if you want you can generate your own avi. any other suggestions guys. sound sync is a problem if you want direct conversion to avi.
,muk0690,2010-01-01T15:15Z,"@justregged : I think better u keep quiet if u know nothing. I know these things quite well. In resolution, i meant the size of the video.
For dumbs: its the width x height.
Packing more bitrate in small size will yield better quality. Thats what i meant. If the bitrate is to be increased the size too will increase. Better google ""bitrate and resolution"" to know more.
And before u advice anyone check whether u r right..."
[V],pluto999,2010-01-01T16:54Z, please upload time travelers wife & whip it.. you rock.. happy new year!!
,justregged,2010-01-01T17:59Z,was talkin about your mp4 comment you clearly have no clue lol
,muk0690,2010-01-02T09:05Z,I can defend that too... Have u ever encoded a movie??? If u do it u might come to kno abt it...
,Rod321,2010-01-03T03:44Z,"vrthenite at 2010-01-01 13:14 CET: 

Hi Vrethenite,
I have used ConvertX2 for ages but it would not convert the 3 MKV movies I downloaded. So I obtaines AVS & it converted the 3 movies but with the voices & lips out of sync & it only created one chapter for each movie. To-day I obtained ConvertX4 & converted one of the 3 movies again & it has created multiple chapters & the voices & lips are in sync. So all is well!!
THANKS A MILLION FOR THE ADVICE"
