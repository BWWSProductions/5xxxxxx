If your looking for some requests/ideas for future releases that us holyroses encode followers would salivate at the chance at having in ipod/psp/zune format here are a few:

Heat (1995), Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995), The Godfather 1 (1972), The Godfather 2 (1974), Scarface (1983), Snatch (2000), Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998),  The Boondock Saints (1999), Reservoir Dogs (2002), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), Blow (2001)

I know quite a list but again just mearly suggestions if your looking for any if your not simply disregard.

Thanks again signalboy and TEAM holyroses!"

Again, Since King Roses has all the new releases covered its nice to have more options for ""older"" movies that people need to check out in the BEST ipod/psp/zune encoding format available."
