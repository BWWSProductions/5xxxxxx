d/l ing ""touch of evil"""
,Zartrauch,2010-05-28T14:46Z,"Very nice quality for it's small size, definitely worth the download. The thing that bothers me though is that the subtitles which are included get a bit out of sync in the second half of the movie.
I looked for fixed/synced ones but no luck there, so if anyone knows where to grab them let us now."
