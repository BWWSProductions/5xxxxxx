The brand new holiday adventure stars everyone's favorite Central Park "zoosters" from Madagascar and Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. Merry Madagascar begins when Santa and his sleigh unexpectedly crash-land on the island, giving the jolly gentleman a case of amnesia. So it falls to Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria -- along with the ever-inventive Penguins -- to deliver the presents and save Christmas. And it doesn't hurt that Santa's Sleigh just might be able to make a little trip to New York City, so they can finally return to their beloved home. But during their appointed rounds, the four re-discover the magic of giving -- and that it is ultimately more important than their own wish to return home. Also included is a long-lasting North Pole/South Pole rivalry between the Penguins and Santa's reindeer, plus magic flying dust and a King Julien-based holiday called "Julienuary."

Kui jÃµuluvana koos oma saaniga saarele prantsatab ja mÃ¤lu kaotab, peavad lÃµvi Alex, sebra Marty, kaelkirjak Melman ja jÃµehobu Gloria jÃµulud pÃ¤Ã¤stma. Nad otsustavad ise kingid laste kÃ¤tte toimetada ja kui hÃ¤sti lÃ¤heb, siis jÃµuluvana saaniga ka tagasi kodusesse New Yorki jÃµuda?
