Zonya's Health Bites season 2 

This is a great show for healthy eating information. Zonya is a registered 
dietitian and presents tips, information and easy to make recipies for eating healthy.
There is also a 5 minutes or so exercise segment with short, easy to do routines, 
also very helpful. Her presentation is a bit annoying, but the information is solid.
Check out a few episodes.

More info about her on her website: www.zonya.com/.

These episodes were captured from from the local PBS station at 640x480.
Only season 2 and 3 were aired.
The original quality was not that good, kind of grainey. For some reason 
the station added black bars on all 4 sides about 60 pixels wide. I cropped out 
the black bars so most videos here are 512x360 or 496x360. 
Somewhere in the 3rd season they started broadcasting full 640x480 shows
but the quality looked just as bad, I think the original source was 496x360
and they resized it up for broadcast. 

I left the tivo info screens on at the beginning which contain the episode
description.
