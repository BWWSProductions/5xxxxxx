Richard Nixon was elected 37th President of the United States of America on November 6, 1968. He could be defined a 'political self-made man', brought to power by the same kind of voters who elected George Bush, father and son. The kind of voters whose fear of communism at the time made them come to accept a witch hunt in the name of their fear, just as they accepted the Vietnam War or repression in the ghettos and universities. It was a profoundly religious America - political choices were accepted in the name of God and Country.

Today, Bush is a Born-Again Evangelist - then, Nixon was a strict Quaker. There have been a number of films on the presidency of Richard Nixon or his fall from grace, but less on his coming to power. And yet, the very history of his presidency - and his resignation - resides entirely in his obsession with power. Power achieved by constant use of manipulation, lies and taste for secrecy. Nixon is not the only one who believes that the end justifies the means in business and politics, but Nixon turned his obsession into a form of art. Until he stumbled and fell ... into a trap of his own making. It was not just the dirty tricks he played on the Democrats that brought down 'Tricky Dick', but all those used against any opponent, from the Vietnam War to American influence in Latin America.

Patrick Jeudy*s new film turns the spot lights onto an 'America in black and white' which is strangely reminiscent of some 'scenes' of the the technicolour America of today. Through the character of Richard Nixon, we will be 'revisiting' those years to his destitution - not necessarily in chronological order, but like someone recalling the past by little chapters. In other words, we*ll look at the life, work and trials of unglamorous 'Tricky Dick'.
