Same as the other 2.0.706 out there on piratebay but i updated toc on cartographer and removed some unecesarry addons on cartographer and added mapster.. made it work 100% with blizzards own "quest helper"

just extract in wow addon folder and use =) dont even need to check load out of date addons =) everything works awsome =) enjoy

I will be seeding as much as possible =)

if you get lua errors... you can disable them under Interface > Help > Display lua Errors < set that to OFF
