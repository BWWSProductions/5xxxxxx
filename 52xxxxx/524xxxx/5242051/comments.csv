You took out the waypoint..."
,Quite15,2009-12-30T16:19Z,"Could you please just upload the FULL zygor guide updated, and not take anything out or add any of your own stuff
I just want the guide, I don't want quest helper or anything really I don't meant to sound ungrateful but it would be a lot more helpful"
