I thought this show was cancelled years ago. But son discovered it and loves it, so thanks a bunch! The files are more than twice the size of the other torrent, so I am hoping quality is much better!"

this looks like a ""to be continued..."" to me, the way it ends and all."

But with the story and cast changing every year, I doubt there will be a continuation. It's still the best of the Disney seasons IMO though. :)"
