Debian 5.03 (Lenny, stable) including all 23000 packages. Downloaded using Jigdo from an official Debian server, but made into a torrent on my own.
People with BD-R(E) hardware can burn this into one single disk, mortals would can use it as a package repository on their HD.
I only used thepiratebay as tracker since I don't have permission from the Debian Project for this.
Enjoy.
