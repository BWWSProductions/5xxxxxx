"There are no hopeless people, only hopeless situations."


"Hadde MÃ¥nen En SÃ¸ster" can be translated into "If the Moon had a Sister". Inside the Album cover, HÃ¥vard Rem (who translated the lyrics into Norwegian,) claims that Leonard Cohen presented his first impression of art. The CD was released on September 21st, 1993, on Leonardâ€™s 59th birthday. The income of the album goes to the Charity Senter Tyrili in Oslo, and happily it has become a great success in Norway.
