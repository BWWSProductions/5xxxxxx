On a musical note, though I loved the music during the movie, I don't feel like it stands alone as a soundtrack too well.  Zimmer (whom I usually LOVE) only created one main Sherlock theme and uses it over and over in virtually every track, which gets tiring.  Still nice to listen to, but 90% of the tracks sound exactly the same.  Also, it's missing some of the nice fiddle music in the movie--I presume those were actual songs and thus not able to be included on the soundtrack, the fiddletune playing during the credits was really why I wanted this album."
,guilty1,2009-12-27T06:15Z,"The traditional fiddle tune at the end of the movie during the credits is an Irish slip jig called ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN.

,Sanguinsanity,2009-12-31T04:06Z,"As I understand, the version of Rocky Road to Dublin was recorded for the movie, so it is most likely different from others. Total bummer, because that is why I was looking at this torrent.

,DinMorsPimp,2010-03-14T19:57Z,"According to the credits the tune you are all looking for; ""The Rocky Road to Dublin"" is performed by The Dubliners. It's a remarstered version of the song found on their 1964 album simply titled ""The Dubliners"". So that's where to find it..
Also Dropkick Murphys has made a great version of this song..."
