Be sure to read the text file full of comments from IMDb. These folks know a lot

I shudder at the thought of writing subtitles for those of us who could benefit.

Someday, perhaps, I or somebody else will use something like Nuance's Naturally 

Speaking (for converting dictation into a text file) to come up with a first guess 

at what stripped closed captions would look like. This could be done here because 

the speech is mostly good and clear. I once dreamed of trying this on Upstairs, 

Downstairs, but the language was too overlapping, fast and full of dialects.



Enjoy all 26 episodes which can be stuffed into two DVDs.


Remember I'm racing against the demise of both Pirate Bay and isoHunt.
