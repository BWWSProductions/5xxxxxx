Jimmy Page talks exclusively about the band's early BBC sessions
----------------------------------------------------------------

They are one of the most successful rock bands ever, but the BBC was unconvinced about Led Zeppelin when they played their first radio session. 

Documents from the BBCâ€™s written archive unearthed by 6 Music and published today (16 Dec) show that producers invited the group to appear on a trial basis only, giving their performance a cautious welcome. A 1969 Audition Panel of BBC producers reviewed them, with future broadcasts depending on their verdicts. 

One wrote: "English blues group longing to sound like Muddy Waters, but failing necessarily through being derivative...for me itâ€™s unconvincing and Iâ€™d rather hear the genuine article." 

Jimmy Page came in to 6 Music to talk to Breakfast Show presenter Shaun Keaveny about those Led Zeppelin sessions, for a Christmas Day special. 

The programme, Jimmy Page and the BBC Sessions, was broadcast in two parts on Christmas Day (25 December) 2009.
