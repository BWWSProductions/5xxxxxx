I went through that slow (maybe because I did it all on an old 0.8 GHz laptop) process of "thumbnailing" [swfdec-thumbnailer] all those swfs, sorting them [Bash shell script , converting to pdfs [imagemagick, program convert], joining it all together [pdftk] and finally publishing the whole book [transmission].

For OCRing and naming pages in some meaningful way (so page numbers in PDF and a book match) is probably necessary to use Adobe Standard or higher. I don't have that, so the book is NOT searchable as well as the page numbers in PDF and book do NOT match. One can see there is still a room for improvement ;-)
