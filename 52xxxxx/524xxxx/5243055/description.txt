SEED WHEN DONE PLEASE!!!

All Albums (except iTTOD) ripped directly from vinyl via my USB Turntable. Exported in MP3 at 320 kb/s


This torrent includes every led Zeppelin studio album, ripped from my personal vinyl
the only one missing is In Through The Out Door, which i don't have and couldn't find anywhere, so I included that album in high quality MP3 from a different file I had.
