,krillert,2009-12-28T02:13Z,"@HolyRoses Regarding the coverart, isnt it embeded in the mp4 file? I belive so. I use a app called MetaX to add coverart and metatags to the movie file (mp4, mov, m4v). Think it should work the same way on the XBOX i belive!?

And btw here is a great source for HiRes coverarts ;) most is original 1500x1000 covers.

No, as it only supports 720p."
,krillert,2009-12-28T07:32Z,@zeromancer There are other ripps that has what you are seeking so why eaven bother? Its for the Apple TV and for us that has one. The uploader prob has one to so try searching again.
,krillert,2009-12-28T07:47Z,"@HolyRoses Ah ok understand. Well from what i know thru a friend that had a Xbox 360 is that when the movie is streamed over a network the coverart wont be displayed (dont know why). But when playing from a external drive (like a usb) it shows up but need to be in a folder where the coverart must have the same name as the movie.

Yes i noticed now that you add coverarts to the movies.. Have a look at that site ^ i posted i think you might like it."
