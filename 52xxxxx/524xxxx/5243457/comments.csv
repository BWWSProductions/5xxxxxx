Many of you have downloaded my mix releases and seeded very well.

Although they were just one large mp3 file and you were not able skipping

between tracks and see the track information, like you can with a CD album,

it appearently didnt hold you back from downloading. I`ve tried so many times

to find a way to seperate the mp3 tracks and make a playlist of them so 

you could use my releases like a normal CD. 

The thing is, that the software doesnt export the mix into seperated mp3 files,

but only in wav. format or just one large mp3 file. Converting the wav files into

mp3 format didnt do the trick, cuz somehow while converting, some data get

lost and because of that I get tiny gaps between tracks.

But not anymore!!!!!

I finaly found a way to seperate the complete mix into several mp3 tracks

without the enoying gaps.

From now on my mix releases are seperated into several mp3 tracks and

they are all retagged like it should be and a m3u.file will be included.

I hope in this way you will have more fun listening to awesome and always the

latest tunes.

Enjoy!!!!
