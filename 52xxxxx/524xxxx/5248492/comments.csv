Thanks for this up! I've been looking for it for a while, but only found it on private torrents I don't have access.

Do you have the Part I on same quality?"

Played with several programs (Media Player Classic, Windowd Media Player,...): all with the same bad result. Worthless download for me, I'm afraid. Any one else experienced the same problem???"
