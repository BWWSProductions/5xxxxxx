,raynre,2010-03-04T07:52Z,"Jebus, why in the world would you need 430+ books on gardening? Wouldn't you start running in to endless copies of the same information after the first 10 or so?

Still, great job on the upload."
,hujev,2010-03-24T03:58Z,"a huge batch for sure, but you can select by title before download. in case anybody wonders, yes there are pot growing books here! also permaculture, greenhouse building, water and soil, and a few oddities, like a hypnosis book... have just started DL, but looks like a lot of cooperative extension-type things and a bunch of books.

,Elias-T,2010-04-21T03:53Z,"Thanks for the upload, it's NIIICCEEE!!!  There is lots of variety, everything from the ""Cannabis Grow Bible"", to ""Basic Butchering of Livestock and Game""!

oh and the plant engineering PDF isn't actually for ""plants"" though... it's a thousand pages about managing a factory... so it should probably be removed..."
