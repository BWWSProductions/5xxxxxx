                    The Golden Egg Cup.                      
                    There's a new buzz in the Royle family   
                    household, as it's a special time for Jim and  
                    Barbara and a celebration is planned. Jim and  
                    Barbara have received the gift of money from  
                    their loving children. Barbara wants to go  
                    abroad for the first time, having only been  
                    away once on their honeymoon to Ormskirk, but  
                    will Jim persuade Barbara that an HD satellite  
                    box is a more appropriate way to spend their  
                    children's generous gift?
