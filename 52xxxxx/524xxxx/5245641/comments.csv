,Xarra,2011-05-11T05:30Z,No Chinese Democracy? D:
,Sn0okk,2011-06-08T18:05Z,"chinese democracy isnt here because thats axl 'n friends.

guns n roses died went slash left"
,lol_davve,2011-06-26T18:03Z,I totally agree with Sn0okk. Chinese Democracy is not Guns n Roses. GnR died when Slash left.
,SodPen,2011-07-22T21:24Z,"Can we not say ""Axl and friends"" and instead be more accurate and say ""Axl and paid temporary musical associates""?  ;-)"

,mckay79,2011-08-07T23:54Z,and I agree with every1 else gnr isnt gnr without slash
,osirisgothra,2011-09-21T18:10Z,"I love how people complain about quality... anyone with half a brain should know better to complain about getting something for free. That's like complaining if a nice old lady on the street handed you a 20$ bill instead of a 100$ bill.... worthless - how about this, if the sound quality isn't good enough for you, try cleaning your ears out using a handgun and do us all a favor :)"
,MaddoxXBanger,2011-09-30T01:30Z,Chinese democracy isn't on the list : \
,IndoctriNation,2011-09-30T23:06Z,"@ aetuis111

Do you really notice the difference of quality of, say, 320 kps vs 128 kpbs on a pc? Unless you download songs to burn them on a cd, of course..."
,IndoctriNation,2011-09-30T23:09Z,"@ osirisgothra

You couldn't be more right. Couple that with the fact that you can't even notice the difference of kbps of, say, 320 vs 128 on a pc(see previous post of mine).

You know, torrenting... of course it's awesome, but I can't help but feel that it's starting to... like, overrise us... Lot of people don't seed after downloading, let alone appreciate the fact that they upload their share..."
,_Necross_,2011-10-23T21:08Z,thanks
,dagda88,2011-11-13T03:07Z,"Thanks, if the quality isn't good enough, your stereo isn't loud enough."
,KiKSumMFHedz,2011-12-21T01:53Z,thank ya much ;)
,DanniiSixx,2012-02-13T14:28Z,"Fuck me, honestly don't know why people are complaining about the sound quality or how slowly this shit is downloading. I must have clicked ""Download torrent"" about.. 10 minutes ago and it's already on 33% calm your tits."
,Malum95,2012-02-24T19:15Z,"Come on guys, that douche cant help it if he uses a computer that is older than a tape recorder."
,SlimT985,2012-03-10T22:06Z,Fast download but sound quality on some of the songs and albums gets pretty crappy. But it's still a good download.
,G0len,2012-04-13T19:00Z,sound quality is important and is make or break for me. bunch of dip shits 
,Kimmyme,2012-05-22T22:47Z,"lmao~guys, all u had to look at is the fact that its like 700 MiB for the entire discography~lmao like duh~obviously its gonna be shit~i cant believe this has over 700 seeders..like wtf? cheap on ur space or wha?? :p bahahaha"
