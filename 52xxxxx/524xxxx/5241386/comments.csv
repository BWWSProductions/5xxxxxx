The English are well-known for making fun of gay people, just watch an episode of the office. Don't be a hypocrite, don't call it hatred and don't pretend to be offended by it because, considering your use of profanity and foul language, I'm sure that you are guilty of doing the same thing yourself.  This form of humor is quite amusing, as were the remarks I made about you and your countrymen, you have to admit.  I got a rise out of you. Mission accomplished. Finkleman-why did you threaten to beat me to a pulp for my earlier remarks? Since you are such a formidable keyboard warrior, I would like to take this opportunity to formally opologize to you and to the British army who,as you so insightfully stated, saved the world from Hitler in WW2.  My only concern is that while those soldiers were alone in the trenches, defending the freedom of the western world , there must have been quite a bit of hanky-panky taking place.  I mean those men spent so much time alone, in those dark muddy places, and they were after all, British, so there must of been at least a little bit of man-love going on. Regarding the threat that you made against me earlier, the only thing that you will be beating to a pulp is your boyfriend's ass as you are speed-bagging his colon.  GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!"

Clearly you are so stupid that you believe a sweeping generalization about the British people.

Clearly they are incapable of fathoming other countries with resorting to them like you retard former president George W Bush (who was complete retard). Even so I'm not aware of any stereo type where the British are regarded as being predeominately gay. There are no more gays in Britain than anywhere else.

You are correct in saying that it is wrong to generalize that all people in England are homosexuals.  If I gave you that impression, then I apologize.  The idea that I meant to get across was not that all English are homosexuals, but that if you are English, born or raised, there is a much greater likelihood that you are a homosexual, than there would be if you born or raised in any other country.    A 2008 study done by representatives of the World Health Organization had some very interesting findings.  Renowned British Social Psychologist and researcher, Dr. James Bernard Hastings found that in other western nations like the US, and Canada for example, there are much lower percentages of homosexuals, at 8.1% and 7.6%  of their populations respectively.  In England, the percentage of homosexuals within the general population is a staggering 14.4%. That is almost twice as much as it is in Canada or America. I didn?t want to cross this bridge but forms of sexual deviance such as pedophilia are also much more common in England. According to a different study done by Dr. Hastings, you are 3.6 times more likely to be accosted by a pedophile in England than you are in The United States.  I could also bring up the sex crimes in the British army that your government has been attempting to conceal from the public for decades, that is, the buggering of subordinate soldiers by their military superiors, but that is an issue that we can explore at a later time.  Let us, for a moment, stop focusing on the problems and try to come up with solutions.  Perhaps, we could create community outreach programs like those used in the nation that you so fervently despise: the United States.  These programs, if instituted with great diligence and foresight, could help bring support to those areas of England where acts perpetrated by these sexual predatures occur so frequently.  Perhaps Finkleman, we can put our differences aside, and try to focus on ways we can both help to build a brighter future for the English people and prevent all of these deplorable acts from occurring within your great nation.  I hope that my ideas today will empower you and give you the necessary resolve to make a difference in your community.

Your suggestion to go to Africa to measure the heads of natives is an interesting one.  If I was to embark on such an undertaking, I would make sure that none of my research team were british males.  Putting british males together with natives and or primates is a recipe for disaster.  It is postulated that the HIV virus first was common in monkeys in Africa, then due to human sexual intervention, a researcher contracted the virus from the monkey and then spread it to humans.  That researcher was Dr. Terence Williams, a very accomplished and revered british Biologist. Does it come to anyone as a surprise that the person who violated the monkey was british? If british researchers were to travel to Africa to study natives and monkeys there would be little or no research getting done.  Instead, the british  would  have cabaret dancing with the monkeys as the entertainers. The british researchers would teach the monkeys to do the foxtrot instead of doing their job of collecting and analyzing scientific data.  They would also teach the monkeys sign language, and the first sentence that the monkeys would learn to sign is: ""after we are finished our tea and biscuits love, lets have male-on-male anal monkey sex""."

The talent pool amongst the American fighters that were chosen for the ultimate fighter that year was slim.

I think if you check your history, you'll find the world owes a lot to this little island. We practically invented every useful thing the world has ever known or began the process for some one else to steal. We also provided America with all the intellectuals it needed during the great brain drain, before which America didn't know the difference between up and down. We colonised 2/3 of the world and educated huge numbers of people (admittedly alot of this was fiction in the way of religion) laying the foundations for a better way of life. We are in essence the most powerful country on the planet. Our numbers are minuscule compared to most other countries, but our drive and determination are second to non. When our hands aren't tied by red tape, we kick arse. America has the weapons but lacks the intellect or ability to use them correctly and require British troops to show them how it's done, and they still manage to kill their own people. As for your offering of statistical data, I think you'll find the number of gays is pretty even the world over, it's just being British, our gays aren't scared to admit to it. They may be gay but they stand up for what they believe, even if it means a kick in. This means British gays have more back bone than you or any other countries straight population. With that said, you can now come out of your closet and join the other brave outed gays. lol "

Normally I wouldn't enter into a debate such as this but I felt compelled to after seeing what you are writing as you are dressing up ignorance and fact.

Firstly as for the aids being caused by someone having gay sex with a monkey, that has been pretty much discredited nowadays (to be fair if a simian can get into a bad mood and rip a womans face and fingers off as recently in the american media can you really think one would let itself be violated).
The most likely explanation (backed up with significant evidence unlike the monkey-bummer theory) is that during the Polio vaccine race one of the two scientific contenders did his research in the african jungle, it is well documented that he kept a large number of simians captive and used certain organs to 'grow' the vaccine on (after being removed from the monkey/chimp), doing it this way often left the vaccine contaminated with simian antigens, antibodies and virus's, it just took one SIV virus to mutate to HIV and then be injected into humans via the vaccine. sound more likely than interspecies sex?

Back to your intolerance to homosexuals, even if the UK had more gays than elsewhere who really cares? A homosexual isn't some sort of strange sexual predator that will arse rape you given the chance, chill out with you hate they are people like you and me who happen to have different bedroom habits.

Lastly if you want to get into sports and athletics you should check out the english rugby team (who is one of the best in the world winning the world cup last decade, I can't remember which year) and compare it to the wussy watered down version you call american football and as for our wealth of talent compared to yours, put it into perspective our population is a fraction of yours but we can still compete and win against you, if you had a smaller sample of people (such as a single state) I bet you wouldn't have a chance against us."
