,notenough,2009-12-27T21:51Z,"Seeding at less than a kb a second?

Best speed I've gotten so far is 0.3kb a second.

,notenough,2009-12-27T23:12Z,"You do know that if you were to seed it at a decent rate for about an hour that the rest of us would then have enough of the file to be able to continue seeding, right?

As of right now it's not seeding at all. When it restarts it's at 0.1kbps or basically pointless. Why put up the torrent in the first place if you're not even going to bother to seed it for the first 24 hours?

,notenough,2009-12-28T17:11Z,"A day later and this torrent is now dead. No seeds at all. If you had just bothered to seed it for an hour at full speed everyone would have gotten this tiny file.

Read up on how it's done before you make us waste our time again.

If you are going to upload content at least seed it until someone, anyone gets 100%!!!!"
