Extract rar file and you will find a folder called SLUS00594 and inside that folder 

is a BIN file a EBOOT.PBP and a DAT file put the SLUS00594 folder in side the GAME 

folder in your (MODED) psp memory card then get ready to play Metal Gear Solid !!!!!!









PLZ TELL ME IF IT DOESN'T WORK AND YOU MUST NEED A MODED PSP I USED 5.00 M33-4 BUT MIGHT WORK ON OTHER SOFTWARES MAYBE PLZ COMMENT
