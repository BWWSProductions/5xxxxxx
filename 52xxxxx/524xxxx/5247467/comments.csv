,blazin1279,2009-12-31T09:27Z,Which one is this portable ops or solid peace walker
,Strikefear13,2009-12-31T18:10Z,"Well, once we take to ""reading"" we can deduce that the torrent is called Metal Gear Solid.  If any further investigation past that is warranted, the file description speaks of SLUS00594..which, being that the code for PS1 games in the US starts with SLUS.  Need I say more?"
,Strikefear13,2009-12-31T18:10Z,Sorry to be a dick.  Just one of those days I  guess..

,sodimizerTYLER,2010-01-06T15:15Z,SO i need a psp to play this? (Im new)
,darin_god,2010-01-23T18:17Z,"lol tyler.

,darin_god,2010-02-25T12:53Z,"This took forever to download, but finally I've got to play it.

Works great, I'm way past where the last psp metal gear I downloaded would freeze up.

Once in a while there's this skipping/delay/echo kind of sound on the talking, but I'm sure pops loader would fix that.

I'm running this on NO pops, 500m33.

Works great.

After opening the rar file there is no bullshit, just a file you put in the psp/game folder.

Thanks for this awesome upload.

Thanks!"
