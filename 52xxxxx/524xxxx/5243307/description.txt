-------------------------------------------

This album can only be described as a metallic, textured, and ridiculous attempt at conveying a message of "nothing". Melodic pieces, accented by experimental jargon, are thrown together into a kaleidoscope of sound. If you listen closely, you'll hear sampled radio frequencies from different planets, pulsars, and moons in our galaxy. That's right, if you listen closely to these tracks you'll be able to actually HEAR Jupiter thumping ... Berdache delivers.
