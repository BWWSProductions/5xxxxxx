The original file lasts 30 mn but if you look carefully, you will notice that the video repeat itself after exactly 26.624 s!!!!!
So I extracted these 26.624 s. so as not to waste disk space.

use VLC with loop on or windows media player with repeat on, to get a constinuous fire.

To use it directly with windows screensaver, you will either need to:
- convert the mkv to wmv format (complicated), and have windows vista ultimate (premium won't do!!!!)
- or find a program which modify the windows screensaver possibilities (I haven't found any trustworthy one)

You can also create a shortcut for instant launch:
"vlc.exe" "Fireplace screensaver HD 1280x720 x264.mkv" --loop --fullscreen
with a shortcut key of your choice (for the shortcut key to work, the shortcut must be in the start menu!)

or
"wmplayer.exe" "Fireplace screensaver HD 1280x720 x264.mkv" /fullscreen
but the repeat button can only be switched manually.

Media Player Classic (MPC) /fullscreen won't do because the only way to put repeat on is complicated:
select View -> Options in MPC; Click on Playback and set to "Repeat forever"
