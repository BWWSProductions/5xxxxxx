Posting as this is fachman's latest- are you still after feedback?

My 2 cents:
Personally, the highest quality file you can get, keeping the file size small enough to burn to a DVD+R (single layer) is ideal. 720p with a higher bitrate would probably suit me better than a 1080p with lower etc."

Ok, you wil have a nice 4.38GB file which will fit on single DVD, but what will you do if you do not have a dvd player, but you have one of the latest lcd and Plasma TV which can play directly such file. You start uploading it on your pendrive and then What?? Error?? Why??? Oh yes damn FAT32 which limits the size to 4GB only... Cest la vie.
As for your question: Does 720p encode at the same small size will look better than 1080p??? I dont think so, but maybe I will do such file to let you decide."

To this moment, I've got 30% but my ratio is above 1200 %. Not the first time !!!
Torrent programs should force people to seed at least 100 %,"
,TheBleed,2010-12-14T02:26Z,Are there anymore seeds available for this awesome torrent guys? Guys?
