Joan Jett & The Blackhearts - Do You Wanna Touch Me (Live-Beat Club) (2nafish)


"Do You Wanna Touch Me", also referred to as "Do You Wanna Touch Me? (Oh Yeah)" is a glam rock song performed by Gary Glitter. The song reached Number 2 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1973, his third successive UK hit. The song represented something of a departure from the "trademark" of the Glitter sound and it was co-written by Glitter and his record producer. It was later covered by rock singer Joan Jett in 1982, reaching number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.

A cover of the song by Joan Jett from her 1981 album Bad Reputation appears in a 2008 TV commercial for Hewlett-Packard's TouchSmart computers. The ad was pulled from TV when HP learned that Glitter, now a convicted pedophile, had written the song. On 29th October 2008, it was reported that Glitter will receive Â£100,000 in royalties from Hewlett Packard for this advertisement.

Joan Jett (born Joan Marie Larkin September 22, 1958) is an American rock guitarist, singer, songwriter, producer and actress.

She is best known for her work with Joan Jett & the Blackhearts including their hit cover "I Love Rock N' Roll", which was #1 on the Billboard charts from March 20 to May 1, 1982, as well as for their other popular recordings including "Crimson and Clover", "I Hate Myself for Loving You", "Do You Want to Touch Me", "Light of Day", "Love Is All Around", "Bad Reputation" and "Little Liar."

Her musical and song-writing approach is heavily influenced by the hard-edged, hard beat-driven rhythms common to many rock bands of her native Philadelphia, often featuring lyrics surrounding themes of lost love, criticisms of insincerity, the struggles and resolution of the American working class, and the quest for authenticity.
