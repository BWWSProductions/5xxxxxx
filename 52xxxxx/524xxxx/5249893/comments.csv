Great up! How do we use the ""key""? Is it a double-click to register thing? Or, something else?"
,Pzer0cool,2010-01-01T05:14Z,"didn't work for me. I did it before and after opening DVDfab. Says will be registered after a restart of the program, and when the window pops up with saying what's registered, nothing is enabled."
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-01-01T05:25Z,"@aoloffline

Thanks! What about @Pzer0cool? Should he uninstall and then try again?"
,slpUfuknslly,2010-01-01T09:09Z,Works great! Thanks!
,chuckallstarz,2010-01-01T12:31Z,"@Pzer0cool

After installing, untick the box that says 'launch/run dvdfab' THEN click finish. Now run the Key file and it will work.

Just a heads up for people"

Thanks, ended up getting it to work fine, idk what happened, I activated the last version of the program this way also."
,brutnell,2010-01-01T20:12Z,hi i am having some problem done the install but when i double click on key.dvdfab it asks what to run it in? any help welcomed
,brutnell,2010-01-01T20:24Z,all done now quality cheers
,CHAOS1972,2010-01-02T03:21Z,"Atfer using the reg, it goes from saying not used to expires jan. 28, 2010......

that's less then a month registered."
,drumbum4b,2010-01-02T07:46Z,Registry key will not work in windows 7 (64bit) just asks what program to open with. Any one else have this prob?
,chuckallstarz,2010-01-02T07:56Z,"@CHAOS
I had that problem because I didn't untick the ""launch dvdfab"" box after installing. Make sure it never opens before running the key.

@drumbum4b
I have windows 7 64 bit, so I can say it works.
Can't say why yours doesn't work. Because the key file is labelled as a 'DVDFAB6' file that means dvdfab has to be installed so it can recognise the file..

I'm trying :D"
,CHAOS1972,2010-01-02T09:22Z,"@ huckallstarz

Well I did untick the ""launch dvdfab"" box while installing...

So that is not the problem....
And i tried it on a XP 32bit and Vista Ultimate 64bit system witht he same issue....

I am thinking someone just took the key from an older version and thought they would upload it with the newest version thinking it would work without really paying attention to what it did...."
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2010-01-02T14:29Z,"Thanks for the timely torrent. Easy install here. 
For those with a problem suggest go offline and do a complete uninstall with Revo Uninstaller first. Then install and close DVDFab rather than let it start. Doubleclick the key. Let DVDFab start, open settings, and untic the autoupdate. Finally go back online."
,mkbarin,2010-01-02T16:05Z,"I have windows 7 32 bit and it works with no problems 

Great torrent Thanks"
,magsmcb,2010-01-05T01:50Z,thanks x
,byts,2010-01-06T02:54Z,"It may just be me, but I  found the crack to be essentially a text file that I needed to open and copy/paste the registration code found within into the DVDFab application registration prompt."

,Rangers10,2010-01-08T06:45Z,"They Key does not work with the installer DVDFab6218 file from the website. But works with the one installer included.

If you compare both files they have different file sizes. Something must have changed. "
,west54,2010-01-09T00:52Z,works 100% THANKS MATE !
,fastasscrass,2010-01-13T10:56Z,Works great on Windows 7 Pro. I installed the program then used the DVDfab.exe to open the reg file. All systems go. Great torrent!
,sparker781,2010-01-13T17:47Z,Wow...Great Torrent...Works Flawlessly to Copy DVD's...Great Torrent
,Machinapoutine,2010-01-14T01:50Z,The key file had no extension so windows asked to choose a program to open it when i double click. A simple solution is to drag it over your dvdfab.exe file in dvdfab install folder. it automatically register the program.
,Machinapoutine,2010-01-14T01:54Z,"oh and thank you for upload, very good program :P"
