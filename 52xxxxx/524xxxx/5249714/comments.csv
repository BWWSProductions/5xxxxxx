,_wolfie_,2010-08-31T09:52Z,"Probably the best comedy ever, thx Ekolb!

Believe it or not I still have my old original VHS of this movie sitting on my desk atm. Not that it's much more then a decoration since I have nowhere to actually play it :P

a/v both look good. I only glanced quick but I'd say around a 9/9"
