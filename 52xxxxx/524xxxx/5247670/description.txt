Science and Islam (2009)
3of3

Physicist Jameel Al-Khalili takes a personal journey into a largely forgotten era, travelling through Syria, Iran, Tunisia and Spain to tell of the great leap in scientific knowledge that took place in the Islamic world between the 8th and 14th centuries CE.

The Power of Doubt

Jameel Al-Khalili traces how the scientific revolution that took place in the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe had its roots in medieval Islam, and examines why science appears to go into decline after the 16th and 17th centuries in the Islamic world and how today it's once again emerging.
