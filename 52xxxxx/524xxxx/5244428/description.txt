Half-Life: Blue Shift

Play the role of security guard Barney at the Black Mesa Complex.

This also includes the latest update.

It has the built in high definition pack for the original Half-Life, Opposing Force, and Blue Shift.

I do not know if it works well with Vista but I believe it should. Please comment.
