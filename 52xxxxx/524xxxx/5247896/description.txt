"Alex welcomes to the show [hour 3] Godfrey Bloom, a Member of the European Parliament for Yorkshire and the Humber for the United Kingdom Independence Party. Bloom points to independent scientific research that demonstrates that CO2 is not a problem and says 2050 will not see catastrophic and apocalyptic events related to climate. Bloom believes the debate is over.

It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
essential to seek information from a variety of sources,
to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better
understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
mainstream corporate media for news and info is a
prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

Think for yourself!
To paraphrase the late William Cooper:
Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing
until you've researched it yourself.
