,lex.usa,2009-12-26T12:59Z,Thanks...will try
,yosoyusuario,2009-12-26T17:55Z,"Thanks a lot. It's clean, easy to install, compatible with vista 32, but I have a question. Sorry if I'm too ignorant. Whwn I open the program and select ""hide ip now"", I get a message a little confusing. For example, it says: ""your real ip is 95.265.903.190 cr-Costa Rica"" ""Yor ip is protected by 95.265.903.190 cr-Costa Rica"". How do I now it's working and waht is the false ip? Once again, thanks a lot "
,superbink,2009-12-26T21:47Z,Go to this site Whats my ip.
,ckilkelly01,2009-12-26T23:36Z,Thanks brother man!!!
,hannibal0,2009-12-27T00:18Z,"is this meant to work with windows 7 ultimate, cause i cant seem to get it to work at all, well i mean the crack worked but it says that my ip is not detectable???"
,lanceknight007,2009-12-27T08:29Z,I Had Used This Program.It is Fully Functional.And Kaspersky Antivirus Did Not Detect Any Virus Or Trojan Or Worm in the Setup file Or In The Crack.Thank You Kentucky Kid.
,lanceknight007,2009-12-27T08:37Z,"Hi,Kentucky Kid.Need a Small Favor From You.Can You Upload The Program of [Auto Hide IP] Or [Hide Your IP Address] With The Replaceable [Crack] & Not With The [Patch] File Cause If I'm Using the Patch File The Servers Of The Respective Programs Easily Detects It and it gets Blacklisted & it goes to a trial mode or expired mode.So I Once again Request You To Plzz Upload if Possible Either of the two Programs with the Replaceable [Crack] File Instead of a [Patch] File.Thank You Friend For Your Efforts."
[V],kentucky-kid,2009-12-27T09:29Z,"@lanceknight007

hi lanceknight007. this program works just like the program you were talking about.why not just use this? :)"
,lanceknight007,2009-12-27T15:26Z,"Thanks 4 the reply kentucky kid.And Yes The Programs are the same like this one,but it has got nice graphics.thats all. But since the basic purpose of hiding the IP is met.i have no problem in using this program.Once again thanking You.  :)"
,yosoyusuario,2009-12-28T06:21Z,"Could anyone help pleae, i'm getting the same ip as real and hiding"
,CCfever,2009-12-30T13:35Z,"same problem here, un-rarred, installed and befor launch replaced exe.file with crack version which is bigger. After launch and pressing hide IP both IP's are the same. Get new IP action doesn't result in a change of IP. Where did I go wrong.....tnx in advance for your reactions....CCFever"
,jabunk20,2009-12-30T18:02Z,fanks a lot bro it works like a charm 
,DR-NL,2010-01-02T13:49Z,It works (I use Firefox) but it eats a lot of your speed... My advice: don't use this unless you really need it! The slow speed is not worth it.
,old_gregg,2010-01-05T03:53Z,"Guys, the way to tell if it is working is to send yourself an email & check the header from IP address then after you activte the program, send another email & check to see if the IP is the same, simple!"
,soggyorigami,2010-01-09T06:08Z,Thanks K-Tucky
[T],tzanev,2010-01-19T17:23Z,"Clean software and crack works (of course - it's by kentucky kid). Shame the software is completely useless though. After obtaining an US IP, for example, I was unable to use any US-specific online services. Same goes for other countries and their respective services. Or am I completely mistaken in what this program is meant to do?"
,nirgoen,2010-01-21T18:45Z,Thanks
,nirgoen,2010-01-21T18:58Z,"thanks but it gives some probles with win 7.
Program not respnding"
,soldout68,2010-01-22T02:42Z,Stops working after around 3 weeks dont bother :(  
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2010-01-25T14:54Z,"It doesn't work with my XP Home SP3 insofar as I can determine. Clicking get a new IP never produces one and the program hangs (not responding). If there's a trick, I need further instructions. Otherwise I'll not be able to use it."
,naughtyprimate,2010-01-26T17:57Z,Tried this several times with no luck. It hangs and just sits there staring at you. Don't bother.
,Alex0005,2010-01-27T07:53Z,Thanks Will try with win 7 x64
,Alex0005,2010-01-27T08:24Z,"Did not work for me
Installed OK
But when i try to use Program it said ( Not responding ) ON Win XP x32 Pro and Win7x64"
,BakerPWNS,2010-01-30T18:01Z,"Nice upload, downloaded in 3 min. :]"
,McNavdo,2010-01-31T03:32Z,"i think you would need to be stupid to use this, i havnt downloaded this but these programs are usually linked to the police so they can see who is using it and what sites they are on, ive heard of police using these things to catch out pervs and illegal downloaders so a little word of warning"
,pastgames,2010-02-20T18:50Z,"thanks very fast down load works great 
thanks again kid "
,KonFry,2010-03-05T03:59Z,"Thanks McNavdo, a very wise word of warning there, makes alot of sense."
,Blackyhat,2010-03-07T21:59Z,"This shit doesn't work for me dude, just freezez.. unistalled from my puta"
,Mainers,2010-03-14T06:09Z,"Linked to the police,,, get to fuck,, you little kids are smoking better shit than me if you think that,what the fuk are they teaching at school these days.

,coolnsexy19,2010-03-15T11:23Z,doesnt work... programs stops responding
,ocyrus70,2010-03-18T17:04Z,what a shit software all i get is 404 errors 504 errors and microsoft sock errors and a pc that as slow as forrest gump plus hide your ip well if you go to bing and then try to mod the search ops it tells you were you are and i use an internet erase so no cookies or cache so thats that one down the toilet easy hide ip crap..no disrespect kentucky-kid your still the man in my books!!..
,dudew8,2010-03-19T08:41Z,"win7 user here, program did not work."
,Bootleg84,2010-03-20T02:59Z,"Well another flop, I guess we all are gonna have to stick to unplugging our connections from time to time."
,whazzup3929,2010-04-26T00:29Z,ocyrus70 did u even watch the whole movie of forrest gump?cause u'd realize how little sense you just made...slow? he certainly wasn't slow.ty vm to uplder
,GAZZA2008,2010-05-08T15:38Z,i think this only works on dial up and changes your isp?
,knucklepunt,2010-06-11T21:11Z,"Yup.  The file unzipped and installed perfectly. I shut down all instances of the program in Task Manager before copying the crack to the Program Folder. And it all cranked up fine.

However, after following the instructions for enabling in Firefox it completely froze. Tried to tweak it a bit but no dice. Couple of reboots with the same effect.

So the crack worked great but I think the program itself is flawed, unfortunately.  I've tried them all and I had high hopes for this one."
,Shadysmurff,2010-09-23T05:44Z,"Hello, K-K (kentucky-kid)

I was just wondering why i cant find any cracked program or with keygen in the PirateBay for Arrovax SmartHide (http://www.smarthide.com/) alot of people would appreciate a cracked w/ keygen for a program like Arrovax SmartHide, could you somehow crack the program and release it here in the PirateBay? Thanks A Lot, and alot of people will seed it."

,dannowrw,2011-09-02T13:54Z,"Guys
IP BLOCKING"" software only 'blocks' other machines from connecting to you. It 
does NOTHING to obscure your IP address, either internal or external in ANY 
WAY.
IP Blocking software simply has a big list of ""known bad"" IP's. IP's 
used by the **AA, government, spyware companies, etc, It keeps those IP's 
from making a connection to your machine.
Your ISP, on the other hand, could in theory (but doesn't bother to in 
practice) see every packet that leaves your machine. There is NO way around 
that.
If you use a secure proxy you can encrypt packets... FOR HTML WEB 
SURFING ONLY and your ISP will only see that you are requesting data from a 
proxy. However, this does NOTHING to hide your P2P activity. It ONLY works for 
web pages.
There is NO WAY to ""hide"" your IP address. Any program which 
claims to do so is simply lying to you. Period

Fact.............."
,matttxxx,2011-11-27T15:38Z,"It works, but if you switch to a US I.P your going to be blocked from the sites you downloaded this program to use it on lol, also your speeds will drop drastically, your better off with another piece of software, but thx for the upload anyway."
,jbentley,2012-03-18T02:31Z,dannrow- shut up
,cocoloco0,2012-04-06T13:39Z,"THIS TORRENT INCLUDES ADDWARE!!!! IT INSTALL A TOOLBAR INTO YOUR BROWSER AND CHANGES THE HOMEPAGE WITHOUT ASKING!!!!..... GET THIS PIECE OF SHIT SOFTWARE OFF HERE FFS. 

And to the uploader go fuk your self, you should know better than to upload this shit."
,bigough,2012-06-03T05:47Z,"matttxxx is right, don't know if there is anything better out there but my DL speed went from 7mbps to .68mbps (speedtest.net)."
