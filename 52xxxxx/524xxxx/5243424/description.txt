In his final show of 2009, Webster begins by focusing on espionage around the globe, including the CIA's role in the November Mumbai, India bombings and spy activity in Eastern Europe.  


In the second hour is the weekly update by Phil Berg [obamacrimes.com] on the Obama birth certification issue.


Webster also covers some of the events in Copenhagen, in particular China's blocking of the carbon dictatorship.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
