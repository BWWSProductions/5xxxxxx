,spongypants23,2009-12-25T20:32Z,Thanks!
,Cailieg,2009-12-25T20:38Z,"I would like to thank you for this if it is legit, now we just need to get some seeding going on."
,mzeal,2009-12-25T20:41Z,"Im dling now 0.6 kb/s once its done ill let you know if this is legit. I think it is tho, the author seems legit."
,Cailieg,2009-12-25T20:47Z,"I'm also trying to download. 6 seeds and 197 leechers, not a single seed connection coming up for me on Vuze even with it at highest priority.

Getting terribly slow speeds, hopefully as people start finishing it will pick up, right now the speed is bollocks.


As a Briton stuck in the States for school this is a little piece of home I am hoping to savor today.

,Topunit,2009-12-25T20:47Z,"It is legit, and the exact details and quality is as described in the description. I'm really sorry about the upload speed, I'm trying to do something about it, it's not usually this slow."
,mzeal,2009-12-25T20:47Z,no one is seeding this :(
,Cailieg,2009-12-25T20:53Z,"I will seed it as soon as I am able to even start getting it, right now I am getting 0.0b/s not a very heartening dl rate.


If you can get the speed up mate that would be beast.

,joekavalier,2009-12-25T20:59Z,"If this ever actually downloads, I'll seed it at least 10x.  If it doesn't start downloading, and I find it anywhere else where it is, I'll post here so folks can find it whereever I'll be seeding it from once I get it."
,capnjazz,2009-12-25T21:01Z,"I just watched this shower of shit live, and I'm not surprised nobody is seeding it. It sucked worse than a toothless hooker."
,Cailieg,2009-12-25T21:01Z,"I cannot connect to any of the 14 seeds, and I can't get more than 50 connections to fellow leechers. I'm a sad panda right now.

,stenfrys,2009-12-25T21:03Z,Couldn't you upload this to a ftp?
,fdx180,2009-12-25T21:08Z,Mine finally started downloading. It was at 0% for a half hour. But now it's at 2%. Yippee!
,shampy26,2009-12-25T21:10Z,Still getting 0 out of 19 seeds.. download speed is fluctuating between 1kb/s and 40kb/s but it's not bad. I'm getting it from peers but sooner or later I'll need the parts peers don't have.. please seed.
,Cailieg,2009-12-25T21:12Z,I am downloading this one and the 556meg HDTV versions. The HD version is coming down faster but I intend to seed both for a full 24 hours.
,Richaado-kun,2009-12-25T21:12Z,"I can't wait till it's done downloading!
I'll seed all day and part of the night"
,Cailieg,2009-12-25T21:18Z,"TVTeams 556 meg downloads a bleedin hell of a lot faster than this one mates. For thos einterested in a faster download try grabbing both so we have both high and regular def versions floating, but the 556 mb version will be done for me in 12m, this one will be done in 5h.

,yourm,2009-12-25T21:45Z,Please seed!
,fdx180,2009-12-25T21:46Z,This completely stopped downloading 10 min ago. Ughhh
,xangel0228,2009-12-25T21:50Z,As soon as I get a copy of this I will seed on my server. 
,sou1980,2009-12-25T22:05Z,It seems to me that the end of time will come before this torrent completes downloading.
,Green_Banana,2009-12-25T22:12Z,"Perhaps if someone who had more than 10.4% was seeding?  Such as 100%, for instance.  Try forwarding your ports, sir.  "
,fdx180,2009-12-25T22:13Z,All 3 versions of End of Time aren't really working. Will I ever be able to watch this today!?!?!?!?!
,joekavalier,2009-12-25T22:37Z,"I downloaded the HD version instead, because that was faster, but I'll seed that plenty."
,AnonymousUserK,2009-12-25T23:32Z,"It's frozen just under 11%
Keep seeding!"
,goddreaming,2009-12-27T11:46Z,"I watched this last night, I feel a huge sense of deja-vu when watching this, like I saw it when I was a kid, I know that's kinda weird but that's how I feel.  Maybe I watched it in a past life???"
,Topunit,2009-12-28T13:15Z,"To help seed, simply leave the torrent in the queue in your BitTorrent client even after you've finished downloading it (well, that's what you'd do in ÂľTorrent, not sure about others) and it should seed automatically. The seeding crisis is over now, but please do feel free to seed, it's great to see other people helping.

To avoid the seeding/speed problem this torrent had at the start, my future torrents will be seeded through a virtual private server with no ISP traffic shaping (that was the problem with this torrent). Also, I'm going to increase the quality of the video files to 600mb-ish. I can also upload even higher quality 1.4GB HDTV 720p files, I'm wondering what people would prefer, I guess that would be overdoing it. How did people find the A/V quality of this file anyway?

I will be uploading part 2 10-20 minutes after it airs."
,goddreaming,2010-01-01T13:29Z,"I would prefer a small file size as I'm paying a lot for downloads and uploads, saving all downloads so i can seed them all when I get a better cheaper connection."
