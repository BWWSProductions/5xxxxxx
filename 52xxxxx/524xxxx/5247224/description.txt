The black humor of this timeless book is incredibly powerful.

"What can this work be? Sure, you will say, it must be an allegory; or (as the writer calls it) a religious PARABLE, showing the dreadful danger of selfâˆ’righteousness? I cannot tell. Attend to the sequel: which is a thing so extraordinary, so unprecedented, and so far out of the common course of human events, that if there were not hundreds of living witnesses to attest the truth of it, I would not bid any rational being believe it."

â€œTo the wicked, all things are wicked; but to the just, all things are just and right... How delightful to think that a justified person can do no wrong!â€ â€” from The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner

Scotland, the beginning of the 18th century. A dour young man dressed in black, raised to believe that he is one of Godâ€™s elect and can do no wrong, stalks his brother through the dusky streets of Edinburgh. Filled with hatred and self-righteousness, he feels that his religion justifies any number of crimes, including murder.

The young man is accompanied by a powerful and mysterious companion who seems to change his appearance at will. In The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner, evil at first triumphs over good, but ultimately unravels from the inside, lost in labyrinths of its own madness.
