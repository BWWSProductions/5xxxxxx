A wyvern is a cunning dragon of Nordic mythology. It doesn't breathe fire but is extremely deadly regardless. It loves to swoop down, snatch someone up, and drop what remains of them after its done chowing down. Thanks to rising temperatures, a wyvern has thawed out and taken to making the small hick town of Beaver Mills, Alaska its new feeding ground. You just don't come across too many Alaskan dragon movies. Regardless, Wyvern is easily the best movie ever made about a dragon attacking Alaska.
