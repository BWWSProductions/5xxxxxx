The Big Business of Illegal Gambling (2009)

Across the United States, billions are being made outside the law. Illegal gambling may conjure images of mobsters, bookies, and threats of violenceâ€¦ but while that underground world still exists, technology has made illegal gambling much more accessible. The same computer you use for work or to connect with friends can be used to wager outside the law. Itâ€™s a thriving illegal business hiding in plain sight.

CNBC Investigates takes you inside the high-stakes world of illegal gambling where some people are cashing in while others face prison terms or even death. Join Melissa Francis as she follows the money trail to discover who controls this multi-billion dollar business.
