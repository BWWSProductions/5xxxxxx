The incredible story of the world's highest mountain and the adventurers who tempt fate to reach its deadly summit.

Reaching five and a half miles into the sky, Mount Everest is a massive pyramid of intimidating rock, freezing cold and hurricane force winds. It towers above all other peaks and is the highest point on earth. Known as Chomolungma, Goddess Mother of the World, by the Sherpa people who live in its shadow, this awesome mountain has become the ultimate test of man's strength, endurance and will power. It is also deadly...for every five people who reach the summit, one dies trying. All who attempt its slopes risk their lives. Some survive in triumph, but many others never return from its icy heights.

This extraordinary collection is the definitive documentary of the history and mystery of Mount Everest.

Part I - "EVEREST: THE QUEST" includes the incredible stories of the early climbers, including George Leigh Mallory and Sir Edmund Hillary's legendary summit climb, and much more.

Part II - "EVEREST: TEMPTING FATE" explores the triumphant (and tragic) expeditions of the modern era and takes an in-depth view of the terrible events of 1996, the deadliest year in the history of Mount Everest (and the subject of the current bestselling book).

Part III - "THE CONQUEST OF EVEREST", is the thrilling Academy Award nominated best documentary about the 1953 British expedition that was the first to reach Mount Everest's summit.

EVEREST - Mountain of Dreams...Mountain of Doom takes viewers on the adventure of a lifetime and vividly captures the haunting beauty and constant danger of the most awesome mountain on earth.
