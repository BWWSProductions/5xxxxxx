House of Night (Novel) Series by PC Cast + Kristin Cast. 

Another world beyond ours. Where vampires and humans live together, acknowledge each other. But still fear each others presence. Zoey Redbird is the heroine of this series. She's an ordinary 16 year old trying to get through high school. But once she got marked her life changed forever. "Vampire finishing school" what more could you want from that? The books are phenomenal. And I'm not just saying that. From Marked til Untamed I kept reading till there was nothing left to read! And the very last one chilled my bones. If you're wondering if it's like other books were everything is about silver, and stakes and what not. It's not. This books are nothing like that. But I don't want to reveal too much. Read for yourself! I guarantee you'll love it :3
