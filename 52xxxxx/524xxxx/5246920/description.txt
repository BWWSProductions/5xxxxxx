plot:



The dispicable Ramon Cota (Billy Drago) has murdered an innocent mother and child and is exporting illegal drugs into USA. When Colonel Scot McCoy (Chuck Norris) from the original film, and his sworn partner attempt to bring him to court, their efforts are all in vain, as he is let off virtually scot free. Unable to contain his rage, Scot's buddy furiously lashes out at him in court, to Cota's anger. He exacts the same ritual on his wife and child as he did on the previous mother and kid. Out on a personal mission of vengeance, the buddy finds himself mercilessly killed at Cota's hands. When an arsenal of soldiers attempt to go in and bring Cota and his army down, they are taken hostage, surely to be executed soon. McCoy leads a brigade of skydiving commandoes in, along with himself, to rescue the hostages and exact violent revenge upon Cota.
