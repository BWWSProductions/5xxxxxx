,dilerious,2010-01-11T16:46Z,"For the like 5 people calling this fake, they're also the one's who are TOO RETARDED TO REALIZE THIS WAS AN $1,100 BUDGET FILM MADE IN A WEEK. It's gotten so much praise from the media and public because of how easily/cheaply it was made, completely exposing Hollywood's 'celebrity image' if you will... and you will. It's not tattered with household names or Michael Bay blowing every fucking scene up as if Hiroshima was taking revenge on slices of bread.

At any rate THIS REALLY IS THE MOVIE, YOU JUST NEED TO LOOK IT UP AND SEE WHAT IT'S ALL REALLY ABOUT. My only complaint is this guy (or gal) hasn't let me come over and suck his cock for posting, anonymously or not. Thanks Anonymous.


Also, it's a little hard to get into at first, the opening is kinda dragging and all that, but once the fun starts... boy is it great. Don't turn away too soon from the goofy guy with the camera, this film really does please, from everybody I know, they've loved it.

THANK YOU ANONYMOUS FOR A FANTASTIC POST."
