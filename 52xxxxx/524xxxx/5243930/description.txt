Indiana based Rockers formed from Farty Carbunkle and the New Twisted Riddlers and The Roach Brothers. The music is fresh but carries that Midwest Balls to the Wall drive you hear from a lot of Indie bands. They are starting to make a name considering they come from SMALL TOWNS such as Logansport, Royal Center and Lucerne, In. They are becoming a local Festival Favorite in the land of the Corn.
