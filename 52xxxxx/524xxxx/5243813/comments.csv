the file crd.exe is the ""Team Crude"" way to brag about themselves in their uploads, and to do it they pack their exe using the same programs used for keygens. In you run it in Sandboxie you'll see that it does nothing more than tell what they do with a nice graphics and music. Here is the response of scanning it with Virustotal:

Strangely, none of the 41 AVs at VT detects a ""Win32:JunkPoly [Cryp]"" in this file. Maybe you were already hosting a virus on your PC?
Anyway, crd.exe isn't part of the regular program, and you don't need to run it if you don't want."

AVs are never 100% trustworthy, in one way or another. Even some files seen as clean for the 41 AVs of VirusTotal when runned can do something tricky. That's why it's always better to run unknown files in Sandboxie, and in extreme instance keep a good backup of your PC, as you never know what it can happen..."
