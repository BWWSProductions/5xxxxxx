this is a copy of extremezones avatar but this one has english subtitles.

i use VLC and thats what i got the most success with using these subtitles.

on VLC go to video subtitle track then just search the .srt or keep both the video and the .srt in the same folder and VLC should be able to pick it up.

if this doesn't work please let me know. this is my first upload so any constructive 

criticism is welcome. Enjoy!
