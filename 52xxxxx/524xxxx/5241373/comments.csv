seeders?"
[V],TvTeam,2009-12-25T21:27Z,"There are enough seeders ;)

Enjoy."
,Cailieg,2009-12-25T21:28Z,"A sincere thank you, I am currently trying to download all 3 versions and plan to seed all 3, yours is coming down the fastest, but I am still not connected to a seed. VTV is right behind you and the normal non high def one, is pretty much stalled dead in its tracks.


I will report with a rating for A/V after I watch each!

,Cailieg,2009-12-25T22:24Z,Well I am now at 90% downloaded and still not a connection to a seed. This is going to be an odd tapering off I imagine with me stuck at like 95% forever. I guess VTVs release will end up first down though last started since I have 22 seeds in my connection there. I want my bloody Who!
