    * Camilla Belle as Evolet, D'Leh's love and the only survivor of a different tribe; one which was killed off by the "Four Legged Demons" (fierce warriors on horseback). While kidnapped, her hands were whipped, leaving a scar in the shape of the "hunter" - a foreshadowing of the one who will defeat the Almighty. She is unique in that she has blue eyes.

    * Tim Barlow as the Almighty. The Almighty is a tall, blue eyed man who dresses in long white robes and a face-concealing veil. He is the last of three kings, and the last of the Atlanteans. He also fears the "Hunter", who is foretold to bring about his downfall.

But when a band of mysterious warlords raid his village and kidnap Evolet, Dâ€™Leh leads a small group of hunters to pursue the warlords to the end of the world to save her. As they venture into unknown lands for the first time, the group discovers there are civilizations beyond their own and that mankindâ€™s reach is far greater than they ever knew. At each encounter the group is joined by other tribes who have been attacked by the slave raiders, turning Dâ€™Lehâ€™s once small band into an army.Driven by destiny, the unlikely warriors must battle prehistoric predators while braving the harshest elements. At their heroic journeyâ€™s end, they uncover a lost civilization and learn their ultimate fate lies in an empire beyond imagination, where great pyramids reach into the skies.
