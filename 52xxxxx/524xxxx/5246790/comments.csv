,robin1232,2009-12-29T17:06Z,"if this works it will be really fucking awesome, poorly there are no seeders at the time and it seems everyone is stuck at 25.6% but I hope you'll continue seeding"
,Lojzav,2009-12-29T20:11Z,Mastaachief Actually... I'm running Borderlands pretty good on white macbook 2009 late
,kitkat12,2009-12-29T22:34Z,hey eksilimon13! can you ciderport a Left 4 Dead 2??

,MastaaChief,2009-12-30T15:55Z,"i have an older macbook with gma 950 so borderlands doesnt work. ill probably copy it to my moms newer macbook to play it. and im not stuck at 25.6% robin1232, im actually at 40% right now. i think i the first person to start downloading so.. ye"
,SexyBeazt,2009-12-30T17:54Z,"Does it work? Not that I have any doubts or anythin' but... you know. 
If it does, great :).

Anyways, will this work on my MacBook?
MacBook version 10.5.8
2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
1GB RAM 667 MHz DDR2"
,switchdeath,2009-12-31T03:07Z,"I would like to ask that you make a port of Freelancer. This was my FAVORITE game for years until I went to mac and I couldn't play this gem anymore. It's a space rpg with very fun mechanics, not half bad graphics, and multiplayer for I think 8 people per server, maybe more. They shut down the servers, but there are still some servers up anyhow. If you could do that please do, it's a great game."
,twistquist,2009-12-31T06:29Z,What the difference between this one and other Fallout 3 torrent? This one is almost a gig smaller
,carlo.magno16,2009-12-31T14:02Z,will this run on mac osx 10. 6 leopard?
,MastaaChief,2009-12-31T22:57Z,i see alot of people stuck on 53 lol ;p we need seeders
,twistquist,2010-01-01T01:22Z,"@kitkat12

YEAH I agree, Left4dead2 would be a awesome."
,FluffyBeast,2010-01-02T02:15Z,comon why so less seeders?
,MastaaChief,2010-01-02T03:56Z,"@FluffyBeast

there arent any seeders because people that are just starting the download are douche bags that wont seed for the people who started downloading 5 days ago"
,FluffyBeast,2010-01-02T15:23Z,"@ MastaaChief

i've been downloading for about 4-5 days now, still on like 65% -_-'"
,andrik55,2010-01-06T23:19Z,do you guys even know what seeding is? How is some one that just started downloading supposed to seed? Only those who reached 100% can....

,Gleaneagle,2010-01-09T09:48Z,The reason we are all stuck is that nobody has downloaded to 100percent and that eksilimon13 seems to have stopped seeding... poor show...
,Gleaneagle,2010-01-09T09:57Z,I have posted a plea on  eksilimon13's site to complete the seed... hope there is no issue
,FluffyBeast,2010-01-09T13:15Z,"i really gonna flip out if no one's gonan sed and we all gonna be stuck at 99,9% :("
,Harvester,2010-01-09T14:04Z,"ive been stuck on 99.98 for like a day, then for some strange reason im back to 99.94 pct... whats going on? lol this game looks sweet, i just wanna play."

,ReanimatingTheWicked,2010-01-22T02:33Z,"@FluffyBeast
Im not sure what the problem might be, perhaps it has to do either with the mac you have or the program you used to dload the torrent. I am on a 09 aluminum macbook 2 ghz intel 2gb and dloaded with Vuze using leopard. "
,FluffyBeast,2010-01-23T13:14Z,"@ reanimating
well i have an imac version 10.5.8
and i also downloaded it with Vuze :)
i was sick of it and deleted it from my pc :)"

,brwowsrs,2010-12-25T02:07Z,"This page says there's one seeder. But there isn't one available when I view the details on my favorite bit torrent site. Why? Where did they go? Who can I hold responsible? Where can I find them? Some one's lying to me, and preventing me from playing a khool game for free, and I'm non too happy sir, or maam."

So it's not even really downloading at the moment, it's just idling. And I'm sorry but if it's not going to download, then I'm going to have to stop seeding.

However, if I ever get this downloaded, I will seed for a long time. I'm on break from college so I have a lot of time to do so."
