Courage in Red S01E05 - Remote Policing

This 13 part series goes behind closed doors to reveal many aspects of the RCMP. These aspects include: protecting schools, cadet training, peacekeeping, ERT, remote policing, drug labs, youth policing, frontline policing, VIPs etc.


Episode Info: One of the most unique things about the RCMP is that they serve very remote, northern communities. This sets them apart from any other policing service in Canada. The remote experience is one that is all about commitment and extremes - extremes in temperatures, culture and working conditions. For some it's just a job, but for others, it becomes their way of life.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion. The broadcast was HD but because of my conversion method, it is not as high quality as scene HD releases so I have labeled it as WS instead of HDTV.
