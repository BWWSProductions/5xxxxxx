[T],Akamaru-,2009-12-31T19:16Z,"No worries, like i said everyone else is doing live action, so i'll be working on animation for a bit."
[T],Akamaru-,2010-01-02T04:04Z,"@ taz, huh? i don't get it."
,HD.1080p,2010-01-02T11:41Z,"Hey Akamaru, is 'Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs' out on bluray yet? coz i had seen one bluray-rip by 'secretmyth' a long time ago but nothing after that. 
i m waiting for PS3-TEAM to upload it.

(BTW, u r doing a great job by uploading animation movies which makes u a special PS3-TEAM member for the animation freaks like us. so just dont listen to the fools, who dont even know what they r commentin' about.)"
