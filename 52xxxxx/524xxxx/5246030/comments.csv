[T],InternetNinjacy,2009-12-30T19:03Z,"I concede to your IMDb link, as I though I had done it before. But use VLC player, or any of the other hundreds of players people invariably will tell you to use when you don't want to bother with Codexs. 

And to the rest of your smarm, I don't know. Doesn't matter to me, considering the way I use the files on my end. So sorry. If you don't like it, find another torrent. "
,ReapersD00M,2010-03-28T10:48Z,realy though it isnt that hard to find such information on your own why must others do it
,darko999,2010-03-30T21:36Z,"Seriously, more info is needed. Dontcha see why others have tons more seeds? And trusted? pshhhh. Doesn't help when YOU are no help."
[T],InternetNinjacy,2010-03-31T22:56Z,"Not running a business here. I hope my torrents don't suck, but it doesn't behoove me to do better when there is no profit to be had.

Just go to another torrent if mine doesn't have enough info for you. Tada, problem solved."
