Shaun of the Dead is a 2004 British horror comedy directed by Edgar Wright, starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and written by Pegg and Wright. Pegg plays Shaun, a man attempting to get some kind of focus in his life as he deals with his girlfriend, his mother and stepfather. At the same time he has to cope with an apocalyptic uprising of zombies.

The film, the "first romantic zombie comedy or 'rom-zom-com'", is also the first of what Pegg and Wright call their "Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy" with Hot Fuzz as the second and The World's End as the third.
