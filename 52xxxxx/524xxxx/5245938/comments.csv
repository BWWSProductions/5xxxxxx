Extensive high quality footage and good sound of a concert, with lot's of close up angles. No waste in surroundings, etc, it's all about the Jimmy Smith trio and the music. The movie starts, they start playing, and they play almost 90 minutes, until the end of the movie.

And, finally, if anyone happens to have a question about the performance: Yes, they swing as ever! Jimmy Smith is of course the true virtuos and driving force behind his Hammond B-3, with his impeccable timing, incredible technique, and swing, but Eddie McFadden, the cool guitarist, will make no one disappointed with his Gretch and Fender amp, and the drummer Charlie Crosby lays a solid backdrop (he even seems to be able to tame Smith from rushing the pace! Smith afficionados know what I mean).

Many thanks for sharing!"
