[T],frankie-boy,2009-12-29T22:46Z,"I have seeded 1.38 Gb of this 802.6 Mb file over 4 days, and I am still the only seeder.

Without some more seeding from you people, I will not be able to offer more material. I just don't have the bandwidth to do this by myself."
[T],frankie-boy,2009-12-31T19:03Z,Thanks seeders.

Thank you for all of these. "
