A clever and sensitive script, excellent photography and lots of powerful acting make this a favorite B-noir. A great cast helps too, and a lot of supporting actors appearing in The Scar have significant roles in other noirs.

There's nothing "noir" missing from this movie except perhaps a femme fatale: in contrast to her role in, say, Scarlett Street, Joan Bennett plays here the "good girl", albeit a somewhat cynical one.

The only real weakness that occurs to me about this noir is that the cast frequently overacts, but that is "in style" for noir.
