@ only1joe : man you're torrents are amazing. 

~ Full original scans of covers!
~ Audio @ 320 CBR!
~ CD Rip!
~ Clean tags
~ No watermarks what so ever

I must've downloaded atleast 30 of your torrents. Awesome work...please continue maintaining such standard. I once complaint that you dont name the tracks sequentially but I take it back cos thats one minor thing.

Two thumbs up.... "

When you drag and drop the mp3s into your music player they will also be numbered correctly.

Thanks for the comments.

Thanks for visiting my torrent & leaving comments. Greatly appreciated."
[V],only1joe,2010-03-29T17:36Z,"mrvain32  - No worries...i should have said, thats the way i like to do it becasue i am always making mp3 cds for the kids, and if all the tracks were numbered i would be getting confused trying to find any tracks out of the folders.
But if i upload in FLAC (which i plan to do in the near future) they should be numbered with artist.
