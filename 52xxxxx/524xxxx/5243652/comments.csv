[V],twentyforty,2009-12-27T16:04Z,"@htcouch: If someone asks me which movies I like, my answer probably is: ?SF?. BUT, if I honestly look into my own ?Top 10 movies? I see that most of them are ? dramas, one way or another, even if main genre cold be ?War? or ?Romance? or whatever?
To cut long and messy story short, my ?Top 10? movies in last couple of year are Henry Poole, Lucky ones, Edge of love, Seven pounds, Whristcutters, Hurtlocker, Things we lost in fire and Camille and judging from that, dramas seems to leave impact on me, more than I wish or think.
@sanyam: Glad you make it, 'cause I haven't seen you in swarm."

,htctouch,2009-12-27T19:51Z,"I cant take history/war movies though

about dramas what i feel is either they are absolutely awsm like seven pounds , beautiful mind , forest gump , cast away , lil miss sunshine etc ..
or totaly oppost .. movies bounce through my head
like A.O jesse james , rocket science etc ..
so drama genre is a lil risky
sci-fi mvs r my fav too,although if its an ok story or something,v can get atleast smthing new like adio-video effects n stuff , so it isnt to risky to invest time in sci-fi n action movie.i miss gud action movies these days..gamer was dispnting..surrogates was like i cant judge coz m big fan of bruce w so il always tok gud abt his mvs lolz ..liked gi joe too.."
