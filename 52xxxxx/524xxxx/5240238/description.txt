Microsoft WorldWide Telescope (WWT) - the program is a virtual telescope and allows users to consider the starry sky in several ranges of electromagnetic waves, as well as the surface of planets in the solar system. Sources of photographs is the Hubble SpaceTelescope and about 10 are located on the surface of the Earth's telescopes. Community programs can travel throughout the galaxy, seen planets in the solar system, as well as to observe the sky in X-ray radiation.


In the WorldWide Telescope is implemented fairly well thought-out structure of the data display: it is possible to carry out the selection of information sources, celestial objects (stars, planets, constellations) or just search interesting object using a string with the configuration of the pattern.
