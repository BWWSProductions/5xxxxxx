,GenEmperor,2009-12-30T04:43Z,"Thank you very much for the video tutorial and the files. I to do trial and error with the B files but in the end it all worked great. For some strange reason my NTSC wii with wii key 2 stopped being able to play PAL games so I soft modded the wii with this and all my out of region games work great with neogamma.Thanks again.Great video.

 I was able to get everything to work without having to delete and format the sd card with every step. I just copied and replaced when trying the B files and I deleted everything except the apps and the other files in the end. I was a bit confused how to backup the nand but found another video on utube on how to do it, After installing bootmii you just turn off the wii and turn it back on and the bootmii menu will appear."
