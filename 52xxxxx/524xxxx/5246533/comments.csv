[V],-jonny-,2009-12-28T23:26Z,you are of couse aware that this has already been uploaded. and it has many seeds: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5157966/Ice.Age.Trilogy.720p.BluRay.x264-HiDt
,Closeye,2009-12-29T03:43Z,"Well, i didnt, but can you tell me whats wrong with sharing it again? eitherway, thanks for telling."
[V],-jonny-,2009-12-31T14:34Z,"You see no problem with splitting the seeds on such a big torrent? If an old torrent is dying, a reup is a good idea. But if an old torrent is getting stronger, why not help seed it. Reuploading is ultimately bad for both torrents."
,Closeye,2010-01-02T14:21Z,"Dude, get a grip, i didnt know it was already uploaded and i couldnt stop seeding it neither. It has happend so be happy that the people who downloaded this are seeding it and have the files. Really, are you planning to start a war because of it? Just go on with your life..."
,bobafuka,2010-01-08T10:47Z,"Hey Johny.
FUCK OFF."
[V],-jonny-,2010-01-11T16:18Z,"It was merely a kind request to remove the torrent (which you can do - you see that red X button top right?). ""i couldnt stop seeding it"" makes no sense. and bobafuka, you are a well known a$$hole in this place. grow up, kid."
,Closeye,2010-01-17T14:15Z,"Lol removing a torrent? Go fuck yourself dipshit. Nothing will removed here you fucking moron.
You are starting to piss me off dude and you made it to the TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments thread. http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&highlight=comments"
[V],-jonny-,2010-01-24T18:05Z,Closeye. You're a joke buddy.

[T],rev-x,2010-03-02T07:48Z,there's something wrong with my download....i have 100% percent but some problem when playing the movie...thanx anyway...
,gsawiris,2010-10-11T19:36Z,i downloaded this but the completed download only has one sample file. whats up?
,hotwiredj,2011-01-09T22:43Z,None of the movies or the No Time for Nuts make it past 7 seconds of playing for me.  They all play for 7 seconds and then the screen closes.  Waste of time.
