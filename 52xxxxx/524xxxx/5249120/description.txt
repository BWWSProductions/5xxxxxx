Queen - Live Killers In Paris (FLAC) [tntvillage]

venue: France, Paris, Pavillion de Paris
date: compilation of three night (Feb 27, 28 and March 1st)
quality: EX SBD
Lineage: low gen VHS (Using Sam sung SV-C633) > WAV (Using Sound Forge Ver 7.0) > Track divide up (Using Sound Forge Ver 7.0) > Burn CDR (Using Jet Audio) > CD Rip (Using Jet Audio) > WAV (Lossless Check) > FLAC

some site said this one contains only March 1st.
but it's definitely guess wrong.
I compared audience recording of the Feb 28 and March 1st with this.
at least, without doubt, this is 3 nights compilation.
but track order is just the same that March 1st show (though Typical medley, Love Of My Life, '39, It's Late, Brighton Rock, Keep Yourself Alive and usual 2nd encore is cut)
