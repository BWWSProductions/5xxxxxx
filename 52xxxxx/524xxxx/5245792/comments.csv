,morristhe,2009-12-28T20:50Z,"Don't use the KEYGEN including with this application it contains four viruses, they are listed below:

W32/Heuristic-210!Eldorado 
W32/Heuristic-210!Eldorado 
Medium Risk Malware 
PAK_Generic.001 

I did not check the actual application as they usually lace the viruses into the KEYGEN 

DON'T TRUST THIS UPLOADER"
