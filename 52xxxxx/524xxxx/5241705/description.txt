This is all the songs number one to thirteen from full HD edit of her XMAS special @320kbps. Ripped with AoA audio extractor. I Also have the video in full HD. Hard to seed large files when I only have 35kbs upload speed total. I would be happy to try but would only be able to sustain 5-10 kbs for the video. The songs with another artists name are either them with Carrie or they can be solo. Sorry about not having names, but this is from a TV special, and rather than mislable them I chose not to associate any name with them.Many choices here. Full HD or avi done with Super. I have played these with my WD Media Player and I'll put up my avi done with Super against any MKV file. Enjoy and please share and continue to seed when complete. Comments, complaints and suggestions always welcome.
