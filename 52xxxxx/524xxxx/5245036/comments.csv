,jjeshop32,2009-12-27T22:58Z,"Not sure about the subtitles, but i'm assuming they are in english..."
,Novauk,2009-12-28T00:09Z,"This has the best quality picture ive seen yet , the colour is better and its slightly sharper all round , the only problem is that theres no english subs just the russian ones "
,Novauk,2009-12-28T00:11Z,"When they talk in the Alien language , its russian subtitles that appear on screen , you can still follow the film well enough though to understand most of it."
,Akhen1,2009-12-28T08:39Z,"BEST version I've seen so far!  THANKS SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!  I love this movie, plays great, no lagging, sound matches up with vid speed, and NO BLURRING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You did a great job!  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!

For everyone else, you can easily download an English subtitle online (srt file) and then add it to this downloaded movie file folder; then you right click on the movie itself, hit video, then ""open"" the srt Eng. subtitle.  Easy.  This is honestly the best copy available out there so far, so don't just not download it because there's not built-in English subtitles.  TRUST me please!!!"
,Akhen1,2009-12-28T08:57Z,"you can all download the English Subtitle for when the Na'vi speak right here:

,Attilanz,2009-12-29T05:11Z,"The subtitles for the Na-Vi speech are in german, but other than that the quality is quite a bit higher than the version uploaded by extremezone."
,Attilanz,2009-12-29T05:24Z,"Correction:
The subtitle track posted by Akhen1 (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5245953) solves the german subtitle problem. Just put the .srt file in the same folder as the .avi file of the movie, and if you're using VLC, just add the subtitle track in Video > Subtitles Track > Open File, and find the .srt file.
Sorry for the double post..."
,chewbacca81,2009-12-30T02:31Z,"The ViSiON version is the best I have seen so far, mainly because it has the beginning and the end."
,hizman,2009-12-30T03:20Z,"thanks to jjeshop32 for screenshots

I still prefer natural colours in the films I watch so I'd wait for a regular DVD or HD version"
