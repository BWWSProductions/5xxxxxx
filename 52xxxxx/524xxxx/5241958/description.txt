All 49 songs from the recent NBC singing special "The Sing-Off" in MP3 format with full ID3 tags and art.

Honestly, it's amazing how they take 95 minutes of songs and stretch it out to 8 hours of 'entertainment'.  That, and the hyper-condensed versions of these tunes - very few (usually the lead-in songs) are over 2 minutes in length.  All the 'swan songs' are under 1 minute.  So much for featuring the talent...
