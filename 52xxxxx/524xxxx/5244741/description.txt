Joshua James 

Though heâ€™s signed to a major label, Joshua James is no longer trying to be a mainstream success. Thankfully, the authenticity that appeared in patches throughout his last record, The Sun Is Always Brighter, steers his latest. 
The closest he comes to radio pop is â€œMagazine,â€ which is musically light but lyrically heavy. In fact, all his lyrics are weighty: James fills songs with images of burning boats and burning letters, blood on the floor, deep incisions and cancer. He delivers in a raspy voice that sounds wounded at all the right times (like on the tragic â€œLawn Full Of Marigoldsâ€ when he sings, â€œTo my ma Iâ€™ve failed you / To my pa I blamed you / And to God I have shamed you againâ€). 

Though the sound is bigger than a folk record, the dark lyrics are wrapped in familiar Americana. The instrumentation is meticulousâ€”nothing sounds out-of-place, especially the aching pedal steel, which is used with remarkable restraint. Build Me This is convincing from its opening lineâ€”â€œI ainâ€™t cutting my hair till the good lord comesâ€â€”through its solemn last words: â€œIâ€™ve given up.â€
