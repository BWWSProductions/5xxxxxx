1. Does this have the samples of the instruments included with ? I just converted to .iso and cant find them anywhere, and you DO mention a ""Samples Setup"" in the torrent.
2. Are the .aria files required to play the instruments? and if so, can you upload?
Anyway, great torrent, not even found on music trackers, thx!"
