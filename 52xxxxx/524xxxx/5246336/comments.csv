,suborbit,2010-01-15T00:09Z,this has spanish subtitles all over it.arghhhhh
,kuraitengoku,2010-03-09T06:10Z,"Not Spanish, more like Portuguese. Either way, just run it in VLC and you can turn the subtitles off."
,capri_stylee,2010-05-07T01:16Z,more seeds please :D
,devil-boy,2011-02-04T21:46Z,"The video in the last two episodes isn't just bad, it's Completely Broken.  Which is a *total bummer* when you get to the last episodes ever made and realize that you have to find them elsewhere.  I tried VLC, Media Player Classic, and Windows Media Player - but the same video freeze problem persisted in all of them.  I'm hoping for better luck with the versions that don't have ""PREAiR"" in the file name.

What a shame they cancelled this show in favor of the more expensive Stargate Universe, which tried and failed to emulate the new Battlestar Galactica.  At least Atlantis was good campy fun, with generally likeable characters.  Stargate Universe is just a big downer."

Episode 20 is some kind of preview release - it has ""TEMP VFX"" subtitled over sections of the video where the special effects haven't been done yet. There is a proper version at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4636492/Stargate_Atlantis_S05E20_HDTV_XVID-aAF_[eztv]"
