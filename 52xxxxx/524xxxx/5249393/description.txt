Notes (Phish.net):
- Gone was a debut, and Dixie Cannonball was a Phish debut of the Hank Williams original.
- Back on the Train featured an extended jam including hints of Limb by Limb.
- During Love You, Fishman mentioned Trey's announcement the previous night that it was Fishman's last vacuum solo "of the aughts," so he announced that he needed "someone dressed like me" to do it, brought audience member Rich onstage to do the solo, then gave him the vac!
- Frankenstein included Page on keytar.
- Corrina was last played February 24, 2003 (100 shows ago) and Tela was last played November 24, 1998 (235 shows ago).
- 2009 has now had more unique songs (242) than any other year in Phish's history, beating out 1998 by 2... so far!
