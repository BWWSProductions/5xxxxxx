NOTES:
~~~~~~~
Ok, Havent Made a release in a while due to lack of Video&Audio Supplies to our group..

Our Man did go to get us some of our own audio but the device had a problem, so
thanks for trying bro... After going throught cropping all the diffrent
parts of the video.. i am pleased we got hold of some audio files Thanks TaRzaN
for the audio.

Video is Pritty good for a cam, Thanks ELEKTRI4KA for the Russian source.
Audio is Typical Cam Audio...

Thanks TO kingben666 FOR HIS SYNCING TIPS THEY WHERE VERY USEFUL, AND ALSO GET
WELL SOON.

Goodbye STG, You will be Missed i hope you come back to releasing when you
have more time bro.

WORK DONE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, First it was Fixing the bad Crop, The source was 704x352, but in
many places the actual size was allot lower, 704x260 was one part
once the horrible black bars had been cropped so the actual video was 260, however
the video was sized at 352, so for this particular bit 92 was black bars..
spread between top and bottom.... (see proof of blackbars.png if you do not believe us!!) there was 9 variations, some small some big, to avoid our release having these horrible back bars, or ruening the aspect ratio, after cropping the back bars, each of the 9 parts differently!! we encoded the video to  540x254... yes we know 640x362 is the norm but again that would have caused horrible back bars...

Second it was syncing the english audio with the video, It Synced Up
Very Well i must say

Video was pritty much ok, if you wish Feel Free to Use our Synced Audio,
to save yourselves time, please give us Credit in your nfos for the release.
