It's different from the ""limited screener"" & ""theatrical release"" versions... and a description of what I'm talking about is on wikipedia.
Any help on getting that version is greatly appreciated!!"

You'll want this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5233929/Paranormal_Activity_ALTERNATE_CUT_DVDRip_XviD-NODLABS%28No_Rars%29

It's got the cut that was only aired once."
