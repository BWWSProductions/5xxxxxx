,kwahati,2010-01-20T11:23Z,"Awesome torrent. Not bad download speed (given that there aren't a ton of seeds). Honestly, I think this is my new favorite Cirque show. I am definitely a Cirque du Soleil fan, but the staging (especially the moving tower thing that the band and singer are on), artistry, music (the indian(?) vocalist is fantastic!) and story of this show blows away many of the others. I like dark, spooky and creepy (hey, I'm a big Tim Burton fan, too!) so I'm fine with those elements of this. This show really tells a much more coherent story than most cirque shows. It's not quite as a-to-b as Ka, but it certainly has a more discernible storyline than La Nouba or Saltimbanco or some of the other more abstract shows. I LOVE the interplay between ""the Innocent"" and ""the Trickster"". I found the Innocent to be incredibly believable and felt, on some level, like I was experiencing this strange new world with him. The striped onesie really does it for me. :-P 

Only drawbacks people should know about just so they don't complain about it after the fact:

1) There are some slight skips where it seems that commercials were cut out or something (this was a CBC showing) and so we see a scene clearly reach its end and then, instead of a clean transition into the next scene, there is a bit of a jump where we clearly miss SOMETHING. I'm not sure what and it generally doesn't seem like we're missing anything too important, but it's a touch distracting and I think there are a couple little bits of story we might be missing that would have made the through-lines a little easier to follow. To be fair, this only happens a few times throughout the show and I'm certainly not blaming the ULer - this is probably just a product of how it was broadcast. (Anyway, I still definitely understood the themes of innocence and identity and that's, in my opinion, the important part.)

2) The video and sound aren't exactly crystal clear, but they're certainly good enough (IDK how people usually rate this stuff, but I'd probably say 8/10...?) Anyway, it's digitally recorded from a television broadcast and it's only a 700mb download -- this is probably as good as it can be...

In all, I'm very happy to have seen this (so happy, I'm about to watch it again!) This is a great show and I'm really hoping to see it live now. According to the website, it's on tour basically all year!

BIG THANKS, UPLOADER!"
