,77ariane77,2009-12-27T23:00Z,Nice sales pitch kellyy53 but you miss the point :P This is fle sharing not file selling but you knew that already I guess. Go scam somewhere else.
,Torium,2009-12-29T00:09Z,Has anyone tried this one yet?
,coup_d_epee,2009-12-30T17:36Z,"thank you shigueo, I will test it and post here soon"
,kalknagel,2009-12-31T13:48Z,This one too (like other torrents) says that you need to activate in 3 days. Not sure what it will do after that. The other copy I had turned into a 'not genuine' version after some 30 days. Afraid this one will do the same.
,kalknagel,2009-12-31T15:26Z,"I discovered that there are multiple releases of windows 7 on pb and they all have the same iso image inside. Check with md5sum -b . It gives a value of 60e5a382e6dc932165b1aaa60b991c98 and it's same for:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5243698/Windows_7_Ultimate_x86_x64__Full_Activated_Final_7600 and for http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5201754/Windows_7_Ultimate_(Activated_and_TESTED_)"
,kalknagel,2009-12-31T15:41Z,"I have been using this copy for more than one month. At first it said it wanted to activate in 3 days, but nothing happened. Same with 21 days and still nothing happend, all worked fine. But now it says it's not genuine! Background going black. I think it's over for this install.... 

I have Windows Update set on, but there has not been a recent update that could have caused it to go 'not genuine'.

I'm interested if people have this copy running for more than a month."
,marwin93092,2010-01-01T04:22Z,"what is the build number of this OS?
I have 7232 but i want to install 7600 or above"
,marwin93092,2010-01-01T04:26Z,is it working?
,kalknagel,2010-01-01T17:37Z,"Ok, I will post this in all 3 equal releases (as mentioned earlier)

For this Windows 7 to work, to be updateable, genuine and activated you need relatively new hardware. With old hardware, or as in my case in a virtual machine that emulates old hardware, you need an extra step.

Install the patch at 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5141013/Windows_7_Slic_Loader_v1.5.6_(29-10-2009)

Install the bootloader, restart (now it may still say it's not genuine), restart again and all is OK!

Thanks @slampy for the bios slic insight.

Ofcourse I can't say anything about the long-term effect, but the fact that Windows says it's activated looks promising."

,woodscreeper1,2011-05-09T17:45Z,"This W7 ISO (MD5: 60e5a382e6dc932165b1aaa60b991c98) worked great and I'm now into the 31st day of f'ree activation.  The W7 ISO appears flawless and is described thoroughly by â€œEd (from Brighton), residing in cambridge, UKâ€.  Thanks, shigueo.  

I burnt it slow in my old machine with and my new DVD reader had no problem reading it.  The install with a new M/B and new 1 TB HD, where I had it build a new partition for itself, was very straightforward with the LAN cable off.  That took only about 20 minutes.  Then I installed Avira from a flash drive, and connected the LAN, got I'net access and turned on Manual updates.  In the first batch of updates I blocked (unchecked) and hid (right click) KB971033.  

KB971033 is a patch from M$ which replaces the missing requirements (of this ISO) and thus â€œfixesâ€ windows 7 so that you have to pay for it, or be harassed until you do. Simply choose to ignore downloading or installing or being reminded again of this â€œupgradeâ€ by selecting â€œhideâ€ this upgrade and it will never be an issue.  "
