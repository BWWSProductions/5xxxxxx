,icarus550,2009-12-27T21:49Z,"The link Ghjab19 posted is bogus and just has you fill out a bunch of surveys, don't bother with it."
[M],vicerock,2009-12-28T01:53Z,"WARNING
Do not go to any of these so called free on line movie websites as they ask you to fill out a questionair so they can get as much info about you so they can use you,re identity to get things on you,re name its called identity theft some are virus links when you press them you infect you,re pc and most are like i said after you,re id so they can rip you off they are hopeing that you are so desperate to watch these movies that you will tell them everything like i said there is no survey with them just after identity and sometimes you,re credit card details dont be fooled people do not go to any of these websites none of them are legit they are just there to scam you. better to download these movies of a uploader you know and trust look out for one with a skull by his name click on his name check out his profile or just dl of one you know so you know you are going to get wot you,re downloading"
,acf213,2009-12-28T06:43Z,"Hey, I'm having trouble with the audio on the video.  It looks awesome, but it would be a lot better with sound :P  This is my first torrent so any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks a bunch."
,mrhinter,2009-12-28T08:08Z,"To acf213:

i just use ffdshow (codecs) and vlc media player (console), I've never had dramas playing video files from cgaurav007 or any other uploader here!

,acf213,2009-12-28T16:57Z,"Thanks mrhinter,
Now another question to the general populous, which codec and console would you suggest for mac users?"
,acf213,2009-12-28T19:17Z,"Alright, so I have the .avi files, both the sample and the whole movie but I don't know what to do with them at all.  Again, any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks again."
,Jester453,2009-12-28T20:32Z,"@acf213
Use VLC 4 Mac

This Does Not Have Eng Subs
Blue Filtered Good Quality
Bits of Audio are out of sync but not major
V8/A8 "
,ryuvsakuma,2009-12-29T01:13Z,i got a problem viewing the movie...im using wmp and it says it doesnt support this file...??? 
,mrhinter,2009-12-29T03:18Z,"demonfang: the NFO file on www.rlslog.com showed this as having german hardcoded subs.... better than nothin though eh? im not complaining, and there are english subs you could overlay a little higher on the screen!

,Jester453,2010-01-01T16:42Z,"This and DEVISE are the best out there.
For quality this is best video but audio goes out of sync and no english subs, the video is also blue filtered.
DEVISE has a Green filter instead of blue has full english subs and audio does not go out of sync.
both great but 4 video this 1. If subs are a must have DEVISE is 4 you.

Thanks 4 this cgaurav007 best viseo out there keep up the good work."

Are you fucking retarded? You think it's a fake based on its size. 2.2 GB is pretty standard for NON-DVD rips. Mot DVD rips start out as 1.8-2GB rips before they are compressed. Its a trusted uploader, quit being a fag."
,satecbov,2010-01-22T12:08Z,this camera no 720p very bad
,call_me_nobody,2010-02-22T07:48Z,"serously? this is the...

,call_me_nobody,2010-02-23T09:32Z,"everything is perfect, exept the sound-.-
