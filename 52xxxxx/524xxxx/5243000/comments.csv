,xitroen,2010-01-20T02:54Z,"Hi, I am french and I live in Thailand for almost 2 years now and go to school everyday... My expérience is this : its impossible to learn to speak thaï (and be understood) if you dont learn also to read (and write) in the same time, so remember it... Because the reading is the key of the 5tunes of the thaïe language... Enjoy to learn, I will seed long time too... FAB"
