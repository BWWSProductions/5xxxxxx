[T],zombifuzz,2009-12-31T21:17Z,"so i have a fast question...

Alkaline Trio is my ALL TIME favorite band and i just found out they have a new cd coming out very soon.  do you think you will have an advance on that before the release date.  i'm definately buying it but i just want a preview of it and i won'y download music from anyone but you.

thanks in advance and have a safe and happy new year man!  best wishes."
[V],bubanee,2009-12-31T21:53Z,i just had a quick look for ya... nothing as yet... 23rd feb 2010 kept popping up for release as CD but scene/advance type deals just usually surface from no where.. so you just never know.. 
[T],zombifuzz,2009-12-31T21:58Z,"ok.  thank you for looking already man.  as i always say, you are the best!"
