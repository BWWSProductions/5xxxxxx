Looks fantastic on my 21.5 1920x1080 LCD screen (computer)

And the audio is nice and rich: Cambridge Soundworks 2.1 THX (computer)

Audio: 10/10
Video: 10/10"
,hofo_mofo,2010-02-02T23:37Z,"Regrettably when I was using VLC player to play this file, the subtitles for the non-English parts didn't come up.

However if you use this file http://subscene.com/english/District-9/subtitle-274060.aspx it works/syncs perfectly!"
,hofo_mofo,2010-02-02T23:38Z,Oh damn I should have read your last comment...my bad my bad!!
,amizza,2010-02-06T18:06Z,"Great quality, thanks!"
,bipbip1234,2010-06-12T19:43Z,"Hi, Thank you so much for this perfect rip!! 

Question: from what version has this rip been done? I've just purchased the french DVD but the french soundtrack is very different and much worse than in your version (not the same voice). I'd really like to know where I can find the same version as you.

Many thanks again! The best movie I've seen for a long time!
