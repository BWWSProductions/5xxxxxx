,mahkok,2010-01-02T07:28Z,You can get this downloader directly at MS (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=92c65d2d-0a6b-4507-a4dc-767f4cc6e823&displaylang=en) or just google it around. Why would anyone get it from a torrent? I'm curious.

this is for when microsoft releases the main release so people dont have to PAY for it."
