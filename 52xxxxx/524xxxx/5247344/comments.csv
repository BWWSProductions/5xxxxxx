,lilars26,2009-12-29T18:09Z,Thanks 20/40.Hope all is okay.
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-29T18:35Z,"Thanks lilars, hope you're good too.
Er, for 21 hours (since Closer) I cannot upload torrent and I'm either blocked or TPB server runs amok."
,lilars26,2009-12-29T18:47Z,You are not alone.There have not been any ups today. i'm going on line to see if I can find out what is going on.
,lilars26,2009-12-29T21:06Z,"So sorry,I could find nothing relevent."
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-29T21:14Z,"Yeah, thanks. Well, Godot will come..."
,lilars26,2009-12-29T21:52Z,And so we wait.
,OttoBismark,2009-12-29T22:38Z,"Godot probably will not come.

One of the mods said elsewhere

""Our torrent upload function broke.

Please be patient. It will get fixed."""
,lilars26,2009-12-29T23:00Z,"""It will get fixed.""Godot will come."
,lilars26,2009-12-30T03:46Z,I would hope that everyone here knows that spammers like Ghjab24 are only here to get you to fill out questionaires so that they can steal your identity.Yes they are IDENTITY THIEVES.
,ZetaBeta,2009-12-30T09:06Z,"First I want to say thanks for all your work and that I am happy you have joined the pirate bay! 

Mods let a good h.264 be the awesome compressed format that it is and not confine it to a handheld section. Although I do love that it can be played on ipods and psps, I mostly watch 2040s and holyroses conversions on a 1080p 42"" panasonic plasma! 

I know that the bay is having issues at the moment but can you reseed the bad lieutenant when you get a chance?

Thanks in advance!"
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-30T09:37Z,"@ZetaBeta: I have loaded ""Bad L."" right now and see 8 seeders. I'll stick for a while, but eight is, unfortunately, good number of seeders. Unfortunately - because of this place, where number of Hit and Runs runs at approx. 92% which I never seen before, especially on name-not-to-be-spoken where people have sense of community, belonging, solidarity and - responsibility. They grab and go, but this are the ""skeletons from closet"" I spoke about zillion of times, when we/they bang at some ""dead"" torrent which happens to be just a thing we looking for.
So, yes, I'll have ""Bad L."" loaded for next 24h..."
,ZetaBeta,2009-12-30T10:15Z,"Thx I'm at 4 of 8 seeds, 0 of 6 peers, and 10 -25 kb/sec. It's ok but not awesome but I appriciate it cuz i was o.o in a hr. before i commented. Cheers and have a great new year!

Hey its free, I can't complain!"
,ZetaBeta,2009-12-30T10:17Z,"Keep doing what you do,and what's it take for a uploader to get a sexy skull around hrrrrrrrr? LMAO ;) yes I'm drinking JohnnyWalkerRed!"
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-30T13:35Z,"@ZetaBeta: None can pull more than 10 kB/s... ""Fastest"" peer can peak at 28 kB/s but only for few seconds... Well, time is weird, I guess, and Johnny is not here to blame."
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-30T16:57Z,"@sanyam: LOL - here on TPB - are not so ""popular"" - quite contrary. Most of the people who visit this page are ""refugees"" from name-not-to-be-spoken, most likely three dozen of good men who knows what they need and what they get. And - how to get - and stay honest as much is possible in ""torrenting"". Maybe a dozen newcomers, and that's it...
It constitutes great pressure on such normal people, who are willing to stay as seeders. BUT, look at the one talk show: 274 downloads of the file (not just the torrent). How many people have stayed one second longer than download? EIGHT. Frikkin eight out of 274. Question I asks myself very often is ""Is this a percentage of normal people?""
On the other hand, one cannot walk in the pirate bar and scream: ""Be honest people, please behave!""
I feel stupid. Torrents are not what they have been anymore. "
,lilars26,2009-12-30T18:17Z,"I understand the paradox of the pirate bar,but even a pirate ship cannot sail without all hands pulling together.And ,I guess,that is the problem."
,ZetaBeta,2009-12-30T22:25Z,"Finished downloading The Bad Lieutenant, thanks for seeding it. And Have a HAPPY NEW YEAR!"
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-31T02:29Z,"Happier 2010, abundance of health and stable connections wish to all

P.S. I'll try to catch-up lost day when TPB was ""out""."
