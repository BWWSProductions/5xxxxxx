[M],vicerock,2009-12-28T00:18Z,"Do not go to any of these so called free on line movie websites as they ask you to fill out a questionair so they can get as much info about you so they can use you,re identity to get things on you,re name its called identity theft some are virus links when you press them you infect you,re pc and most are like i said after you,re id so they can rip you off they are hopeing that you are so desperate to watch these movies that you will tell them everything like i said there is no survey with them just after identity and sometimes you,re credit card details dont be fooled people do not go to any of these websites none of them are legit they are just there to scam you. better to download these movies of a uploader you know and trust look out for one with a skull by his name click on his name check out his profile or just dl of one you know so you know you are going to get wot you,re downloading"

The rip was very good as well 9/10 for both audio and video. 

This film is a bit like twlight but think of it as instead of living forever and being gay like edward is you live for ever and are a tottaly arse hole.... which is why dorian gray is soon cool .....and he's not even a vampire lol"

,Eliyago,2010-01-08T00:33Z,Where it's possible to find the soundtrack from this movie? 
,Chevy55,2010-01-24T01:34Z,"Don't waste your time and in this POS Dorian unlike the original takes it in the A s s and that's when I deleted it. 

Today's movie producers with the exception of a couple couldn't hold a candle to those in the past. 

You really have to be sick to screw some guy in the butt hole.
