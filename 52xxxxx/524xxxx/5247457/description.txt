The Latest Garry's Mod (12/23/09)
-----------------------------------------

ABOUT THE GAME...
Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play.

You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you.

If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS...
Minimum: 1.7 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM, DirectXÂ® 8.1 level Graphics Card (Requires support for SSE), WindowsÂ® Vista/XP/2000, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection

Recommended: Pentium 4 processor (3.0GHz, or better), 1GB RAM, DirectXÂ® 9 level Graphics Card, WindowsÂ® Vista/XP/2000, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection

EXTRA GAME CONTENT...
If you would like extra game content (e.g. Counter-Strike, Portal, TF2, etc.) You need to find the GCFs for them. Place these GCFs into the "GarrysModgamecaches" folder of your installation. This will allow you to create objects from the game you got. I WILL NOT provide GCFs for these games. Your best bet is to download them using CFToolbox (Google it) and downloading the "'Game you want' Shared.gcf" In some cases it may be "'Game you want' Content.gcf" if there is no Shared.gcf. Not to mention you can keep yourself updated with games.

OTHER COMMENTS...
Extracted this is ~2.8GB

I have a low upload speed, so please seed at least 2:1, if not more. Thank you.

Make sure if you do not install GMod into the default folder to change the directories in rev.ini

On that note, make sure to change your name in rev.ini, conveniently named PLACEYOURNAMEHERE. As idiot proof as I could make it. Remember, there are two (2) of them. Change them both.
