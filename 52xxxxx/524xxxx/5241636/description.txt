At Zelda Reorchestrated (ZREO) we do not seek profit nor fame. We are committed to creating lush symphonic performances of the greatest songs from the Legend of Zelda(TM). We love Zelda, and wish to share that love and inspiration with you through music. We now present our very first completed album, Ocarina of Time.
