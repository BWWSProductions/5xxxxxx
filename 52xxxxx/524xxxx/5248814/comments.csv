[V],twentyforty,2009-12-31T16:38Z,"""Eastwick"" is one of never-know-what-comes-out; I do not know the reason. Even if source are CTU's 720p, I must re-encode this episode as 360p not as ""normal"" small-sized one of ~133MB, in hope that my output would look better. Well, I have done some better looking 360p encodings... and obviously, something is wrong with some inputs, not with my method of encoding."
