                    Clown.                                   
                    Comedy series set in and around a travelling  
                    circus. Lizzie's ticket sales are at an  
                    all-time low when Geoff, aka Plonky the Clown,  
                    falls ill. Wondering if this could be a  
                    blessing in disguise, Lizzie steps into his  
                    clown shoes to partner Plinky in the clown act.  
                    Perhaps falling flat on your face can sometimes  
                    be a good thing. Meanwhile, the rest of the  
                    troupe are left alone to raise cash by any  
                    dodgy means.
