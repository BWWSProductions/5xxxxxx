,LORDLORD,2010-01-03T13:00Z,"why in this and other torrent when i install, there is no subtitle line --- save as in subtitle editor ?

HElp, is there any good version out with this feature that works ?"
,LORDLORD,2010-01-03T13:13Z,"Instead of the ""save"" button I had on my former version, on the lower right of the subtitles window, it appears only ""Add a new subtitle line"". The ""save"" button is gone and I can't find it nowhere! Is this a bug? "
