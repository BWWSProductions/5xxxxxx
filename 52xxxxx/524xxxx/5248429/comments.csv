,k3nd00d,2009-12-31T23:40Z,"No problem. I am enjoying getting these out. This was one of the best episodes. Only 2 more episodes left, unless they decide to do a 2nd season."
,k3nd00d,2010-01-01T01:45Z,"Does anyone have any further info on the ""Council of Seven"" mentioned near the end of this episode?"
,dadyhacks,2010-01-01T13:15Z,"Thanks for this matey!!! I saw a documentary years ago about this reporter guy who was trying to delve into bilder berger organisation and he was getting followed by merc's with blacked out windows and some heavy guys in umm he filmed them following him to a hotel in switzaland and filmed a bus pull in it had most of the world leaders on it clinton ,blair to name a few into a hotel closed for cleaning and redecoration... cant remember the name of the show .....any one know ?????????"
,enemy2k,2010-01-01T21:58Z,A few of the episodes have had problems playing on my 360 correctly. They glitch and have choppy audio and video. They work on the PC fine though so I assume it has something to do with the encoding.
,k3nd00d,2010-01-01T22:15Z,"They are XViD, I haven't had any or heard any other complaints. Anyone else?"
,enemy2k,2010-01-01T22:28Z,The episode is working fine now. Not sure what happened. Could have been a problem with the streaming.
,enemy2k,2010-01-01T22:30Z,I think it may have been an isolated problem related to my network so no need to worry about it.
