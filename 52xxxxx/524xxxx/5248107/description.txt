Harpreet Singh Bedi (Ranbir Kapoor) has just graduated, and his marks are, well, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s say a little embarrassing. But marks never stopped him from dreaming of an exciting and adventurous career, and they never will.

He takes a deep, positive breath and dives into the world of sales, rumoured to be an ultra cool career for all smart people blocked from entering medical, engineering or business schools by brainless entrance exams.

But soon, his idea of success begins clashing with the strange ways of these Ã¢â‚¬ËœprofessionalsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ he looked up to.
