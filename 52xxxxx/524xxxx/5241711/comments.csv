,GenEmperor,2009-12-29T21:02Z,Thanks alot for the info on the wii key 2 update. I tried to get it at the official website but they did not have it there.The link was not working. I ended up getting it here:
,GenEmperor,2009-12-29T21:06Z," This is where I found the link they I could not post the other website
http://www.wiihacks.com/genuine-wiikey-wiikey2/35826-wiikey-2-1-3-firmware-release-4.html"
,GenEmperor,2009-12-29T21:07Z,"All you need to do is download it then extract the file using winzip or winrar then you will burn the iso image to a DVD-r disk. I burned it at the slowest speed that was compatible with my drive which was at 4x speed. Then I inserted the disk and loaded the disk on the Wii. After starting the disk it will ask you to press and old the reset button after that you will wait till it finishes installing the update. After that you press and hold the power button on the wii then load up the burned Mario bros game and you are ready to go. Be advised that the update link I gave is only for USA NTSC wii with the wii key 2 installed.

 Idk if the other older wii key works as well. It is important to say I did not use this exact Mario Bros iso here but it was another one I got here in TPB. The one I got did run for a few minutes then it would crash. It does not crash after I installed the update.

 I was starting to think that hard modding may start to be a thing of the past but glad the wii key team is taking care of its business. Hope this helps."
,GenEmperor,2009-12-29T21:09Z,I used IMGBURN to burnt the disk.
,carcake,2009-12-29T23:51Z,Hey does this work with wiikeyV1 WITHOUT SOFTMOD OR HOMEBREW?
,sam_bane,2009-12-30T00:02Z,"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!

As a very happy FlatMii user, I have looked everywhere for a full rip. I even looked into ripping it for myself, only to learn the LG drive needed to rip directly within a PC is so rare it's useless to look for it.

I am so damn sick of people on this (and every other torrent site) saying stupid shit like ""just softmod your Wii""... really guys, we know what it takes to softmod a Wii. But we have our own reasons to NOT do that shit, and you should try to understand that instead of just spouting the same tired shit on every single torrent. You enjoy your softmod? GREAT.  I am glad you do. I prefer to run images from my FlatMii and still pay for my DLC and VC titles, and keeping my system configuration unaltered. It's my option, and I enjoy it, the same as you enjoy your softmod. Deal with it.

Anyone wondering if this will work with your _________ modchip, as long as you have an up-datable modchip, the answer is YES. YES mrkuramoto's ISO DOES WORK. It is unmodified, and PERFECT. DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT NOW. And then tell mrkuramoto THANKS.




THANK YOU mrkuramoto!!!!
Please never listen to the lamers that DEMAND we all softmod. Their way may work for them, but it's not ""their way or no way"" with great people like you around!"
,k8lynn87,2009-12-30T00:04Z,works with wiikey2 :)
,lalojamesliz,2009-12-30T08:53Z,anybody get this working with the drivekey?
,Coolinside,2009-12-30T15:15Z,mario is working for me with wiikey2 firmware 1.3
,carcake,2009-12-31T06:15Z,Does it work with wiikey 1 with 1.9s firmware
,Genewitch,2009-12-31T14:03Z,"This game attempts to update to system software v 4.1 or 4.2 (U, for me, at least) - and as far as i know and have seen it's the only wii title to try to update past v 3.4U ; that's why it's such a huge pain in the ass to play, even with softmods.

Multiplayer hangs my CUSBL after about 10 minutes of play, no matter what cios i load, and i know people with hard mods are having similar hangs and crashes.

Works fine single player, and with uloader and updated hardmod firmware, i guess."
,stretch68,2009-12-31T20:02Z,"the Rawdump is what I have been looking for !! I semi bricked my Wii with 3.4 update. I have the wiikey, I should be able to update with this game and get back on track right ??"

,1m41,2010-01-02T03:39Z,"GenEmperor, thanks for your comment.  Thanks to you I was able to pull this game out of the grabage can and finally play it.  This advice works perfect for WiiKey2 hard mod.  Thanks a million."
,Lion0711,2010-01-02T12:07Z,"funtioniert einwandfrei mit wii-key

works with wii-key......  einwandfrei"
,sam_bane,2010-01-02T21:46Z,"red456, it is ignorant scrubs like you that make it hard for everyone to play what they want the way they want to play it.

I have a hardmod called ""FlatMii"". It allows me to store all my ISO images on a hard drive in my computer, and stream them to my WII in real time, as needed. I don't have to screw around with stupid SD cards or thumbdrives, and I have 2 tera of storage space for any Wii or GC ISO I want. All of that is pretty nice...

ADDITIONALLY... for all matters and intents my Wii is *NOT* considered modified. All the FlatMii does is emulate the DVD drive. I can still update normally, use all the online services, and I never have to worry about my Wii being bricked or having anything blocked by an update. As far as anything or anyone can tell, my Wii is totally legit.

Now, I am not going to sit here and tell you how stupid you are for using a softmod, even though you and others like you CONSTANTLY feel it necessary to call mod-users names... but I will tell you that my mod is vastly superior to your softmod in every way... unless you are too broke to afford the $50 price tag, or you have a crappy computer that cannot handle the data streaming. I will tell you though, that softmodding is neither ""Elite"" nor is it ""special""... it's what MOST people do nowadays because it is free. It is not the best way to do this, it is not the simplest way to do this, and softmodding does not make you ""cooler"" than anyone else.

Again, THANK YOU mrkuramoto for uploading a CLEAN and unaltered image of this great game. If you have a modern modchip (WiiKey or FlatMii I know for sure) you will have NO issues with this image at all. Exactly as it should be."
,Johnnyproduce,2010-01-02T23:40Z,Hope this works! Not a fan of softmods. Chip it and play is the only way. Been waiting a while for one that works!
,_timoz_,2010-01-03T04:22Z,"Instructions how I got this NTSC rawdump working with my PAL Wii + WiiKEY2 (no softmodding needed, but you'll still need homebrew channel+gecko loader, there is NO going around this for now and I'm not sure if there will ever be...)

you'll need: (since I can't post links, you'll have to google to find the software needed...)

- wii updated to 4.2E and WiiKEY2 1.3(PAL)
- this release burned to a QUALITY DVD-R
- SD memory card (even a small one will do!)
- bannerbomb software (needed to install homebrew channel)
- homebrew channel software (needed to use gecko loader)
- gecko loader software (needed to run NSMB)
- NSMB-file for gecko (needed for gecko to run NSMB properly)

1. extract and copy bannerbomb+hbc+gecko (HBC FOLDER FROM IT!) on your SD-media (help files on how to do this are included in .zips and in wiibrew[dot]org)
2. extract and copy the NSMB-file under \codes\ folder on your SD
3. install hbc from SD (I didn't install bootmii's or CIOSes, because I was afraid of turning my wii into a brick...)
4. start Homebrew Channel -> Gecko Loader -> NSMB
5. play!

I know all those steps and various programs you have to use may sound complicating, but actually they're not. just read instructions carefully and do this operation with time. 

if you can't make it with these instructions, then I suggest you go buy the retail version ;)

PS:I didn't get any other release to work at all, except this NTSC rawdump. I've been playing this for a couple of hours now and it seems to be working like a charm ;) hope this helps you wiikeyed mates out there, who don't want to install custom IOSES or similar..."
,vexx506,2010-01-03T10:34Z,"@sambane there are benifits to softmodding, so dont consider yourself superior iether. you can use hard drives to stream the data on a softmodded wii as well. 

also just wondering does this flatmii allow you to install channels through wads or get all wiiware or virtual console game for free, how about homebrew games or software, emulators?

 i doubt it considering you said it only emulates the drive. plus its free."
,vexx506,2010-01-03T10:39Z,"@sambane, again

can you use custom menus? and as for the waranty stuff softmodding is undetectable, just wipe it and reinstall the legit firmware and nobody could ever tell. "
,sam_bane,2010-01-03T14:30Z,"Vex506
I say the FlatMii is ""vastly superior"" because... well, it *IS*. Had you taken 5 seconds to Google it, you would know why.

For those that CHOOSE to use it, the FlatMii comes with software that does allow all homebrew channel, etc... AS WELL as allowing you to browse the hard drive with your Wiimote to select what game image you wish to use.

As far as your goddamn high-horse, go re-read exactly what red456 had to say (and other asshats like him in EVERY single ""New Super Mario"" torrent listing, BTW) and you might understand why I have taken this stance about softmod versus hardmod. *NONE* of the hardmodders have ever said one word against softmodders and their need for stripped-down (and useless to hardmodders) rips of NEW Super Mario. But someone (FINALLY) gives us an untouched rip (because we need games that are *NOT* cut up, stripped or otherwise butched to use them with a hardmod, and it has been like pulling teeth to get this one) and people like red456 come with the namecalling and the retarded attitude.

Again, as I said before, if your softmod works for you, fine, I am glad you enjoy it. If you prefer a hardmod, that's fine too. But don't go telling people *NOT* to use hardmods because softmods are free, that's just being an asshole and trying to force your views on others. And in some ways, hardmods can be better than softmods.

As far as ""free DLC"" or ""FREE VC!!!11!one!""... if you want that, the FlatMii is totally friendly with any softmod, GeekoOS, and comes with it's own app launcher too. I, PERSONALLY (and said so before) prefer to actually PAY for my DLC. I love the FlatMii because it gives me the option of having a Wii-Jukebox, without actually altering my system's functionality or disabling any feature in any way. It's my own choice, the mod comes with software if you make other decisions... but I am one of those ""whack jobs"" that downloads almost everything to see if I like it, and then actually does buy most of the music, movies and games I enjoy the most. To me, supporting game-makers by purchasing low-cost DLC is the very LEAST I can do in this economy. But as I KEEP saying, that's a choice for each individual to make, and not something to be heckled, guilted or name-called into not doing/doing.

My whole point was...
leave the hardmodders the fuck alone. If you love your softmod, great, love it. But don't go namecalling and being a goddamn douchebag because ""softmod is FREE!""
There are other factors involved for other people, and your little opinion is not the only one that matters."
,carlin00,2010-01-08T05:11Z,Thank you Mr Kuramoto!  I've downloaded the game and I'm now seeding it.  I have a soft mod and I've corrected the Error #002 problem but now a black screen appears when I try to load the disc that states an error has occurred but doesn't state what kind (or number) of the error and it proceeds to instruct the user to restart the system.  Has anyone encountered this or have suggestions?  Thanks

,chiquita87,2010-01-09T02:33Z,"I was looking for some help in making this iso work. I downloaded the torrent and burnt the iso. My wii is telling me that i need to perform an update before I can use this disc, abut also tells me if my Wii has an unauthorized technical modification (which is does) it could cause inoperability of my console. Does any one know if I can perform this update without turning it into a brick?"

This rawdump recovered my soft-bricked Wii. 
I have a Korean console modified to USA region (very commonly sold in Brazil). 
On the second day I had it I've made the n00b decision to upgrade to a japanese game. Softbricked since then. 
Now I'm on 4.1U, restored from the softbrick, with restored access to the system configuration menus.
Once again, thanks!"
,bzerkkker,2010-02-25T06:57Z,"Hey carlin00 - same thing happening to me:
""An error has occurred. 
Press the Eject Button, remove the Game Disc, and turn off the power to the console. Please read the Wii Operations Manual for further instructions.""
Will try other games that were known to work before the system upgrade."
,JunkyM,2010-03-17T07:30Z,"Thanks for posting this iso!

I can confirm this file works if you have -
- NTSC Wii
- Wiikey 2 v1.3
- No softmods

To start with, I had wii firmware 3.4U and Wiikey 2 v1.2. 
First I updated updated my Wiikey to v1.3.
Tried to play the game, system asked for update, which I was reluctant to do from the disk.
After reading some forums, I decided to update firmware from this disk, which took a few minutes.
Guess what, it worked. No patching was done to the raw iso as posed here.

Wiikey 2 rocks!"

This file works perfectly especially for wii firmware update.

My Wii was 3.4 and this was able to update it to 4.1 no problems. "
,eleventy4,2010-08-03T03:46Z,"I'm not getting into the debate, as both sides have good points, and I'm a softmod guy.  However, I'm confused by everyone thinking Scrubbed images are what is perfect for softmods.  If you have WBFS Manager for a hard drive (the better way to do it, fuck DVDs) you dumo the raw image and it'll scrub it for you perfectly down to anywhere between 1.7GB and 3.5GB depending on game size.  None of the pre-scrubbed ones have worked for me, and most seem to be way too small.  "
,MrSan.,2012-06-05T20:01Z,"I have downloaded this game from the following torrent file and the disc did not worked on my 4.0U Wii, so I suppose that the files of this torrent will not work too:
