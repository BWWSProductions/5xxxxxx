Blue Earth is a 1989 album by The Jayhawks.

After the local release of their debut album The Jayhawks, the band recorded a set of demos in order to attract a major label deal. Singer/guitarist Gary Louris was injured in a car accident and left the band. Their manager was able to interest Twin/Tone Records in releasing the demos. Louris went to the studio to overdub his guitar parts and ended up re-joining the band. The re-mixed demos were released as Blue Earth.[1]

"Martin's Song" and "Two Angels" were later re-recorded on Hollywood Town Hall.
