for those Avatar movies that don't have English subtitles, here is a great English subtitle to download.  Save it into your Avatar movie file, and when when playing the movie: right click, go to "video", go to "subtitles", go to "open" ("open file") and click on this.  It will show up as English subtitles when the Na'vi are speaking their native language.
