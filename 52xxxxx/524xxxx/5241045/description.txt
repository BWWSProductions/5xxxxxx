An ironic short movie inspirated by the old fashion "Romero's style"

Synopse : Something has changed in the air...Diane and Jeremy just survived 
to a car crash... As they walk along the desert road they finally arrive in 
what looks to be an abandonned gas station. Only one thing to notice there : 
The dead birds lying all around.... and the feeling that something is going 
to happen
