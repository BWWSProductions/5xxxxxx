With the end of a decade comes a few new games. Out of four, here's the third one: Heart of Darkness. I know that there's a similar torrent out for the original PlayStation version already, but I thought I'd post my own copy anyway, since it seems to lack in seeders (please correct me if I'm wrong, although this does not mean that I'll remove this one). Think of this as a "pseudo-re-seed" of sorts. Ripped with MagicDisc, tested on ePSXe and it worked fine. If you like it, seed it, and if you've got something to say about the torrent, go ahead and leave a comment!
