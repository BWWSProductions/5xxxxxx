Description: Immerse yourself in deep relaxation, watching as the sun disappears behind the sea coast Mendochino.
You will feel the taste of salt in the air, wandering through the hidden shores and quiet coves of Oregon, allowing the waves to bring appeasement.
Covered with trees, sea cliffs tower over the remote desert and the rocky north-west coast of Washington.
Enjoy the diversity of nature and Pacific coastal landscape of North America: from the shores of capitol Washington to California's Big south coast.
