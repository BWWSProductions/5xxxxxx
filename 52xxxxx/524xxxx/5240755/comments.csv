,love2DL,2009-12-25T18:54Z,Thanks! I've been waiting for this one. Merry Christmas. love2DL
,lilzac26,2009-12-29T00:29Z,yo what the hell! it doesn't work when i try to open it?? i tried streaming to my PS3 n it doesn't work. I don't need some special program to play blu-ray on my Mac right? isn't quicktime good enough?
,lilzac26,2009-12-29T00:33Z,"never mind i was opening the wrong one, but it STILL doesn't work. When I try to extract files it says there are no files to extract"
,bhuffake,2009-12-29T02:02Z,"If you are downloading HD files and you don't know what VLC media player is, you need to do some serious homework. Also if you have a PS3 and wanting to do streaming and you don't know what mkv2vob is, you need to do some serious homework."
,verbose2,2009-12-29T02:31Z,"Mplayer does detect a second audio track: ""English Commentary AC3 @ 192 Kbps"" which can be played with an additional command argument - ""-aid 1"". Other than that, I'm not sure how to switch audio tracks in other players.

Thanks team WiKi and aoloffline for the upload!"

,pystdante,2010-01-14T05:13Z,"this file is corrupted everytime i download it, it just cuts off at towards the end"
,DivotDogg,2010-01-22T14:58Z,"I think someone just recorded this with a really cheap webcam in the movie theater..  the audio is too low, it has poor contrast,  it gets really choppy and out of sync sometimes...and it cut off with aprox 30 minutes left in the movie!!    Will someone please upload the actual bluray rip??"
,TheSourMango,2010-12-14T15:40Z,"Thank you for the rip and the upload!
Great Video quality
Awsome Audio quality!

Great movie too, it's a new concept and works well as a plot.
I'd like a sequel or more movies with a similar concept."
