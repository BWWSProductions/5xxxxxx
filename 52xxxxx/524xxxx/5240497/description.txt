Wikipedia - Guilty is an album released by Barbra Streisand in 1980. After the success of the Bee Gees in 1977/1978 there was some time to perform songwriting for other artists and Barbra Streisand asked Barry Gibb to write an album for her. It became her best-selling album to date with sales (according to Streisand's official website) of over 20 million copies and was produced by the Bee Gees' Barry Gibb and the Bee Gees' regular production team of Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson. The title track, a duet between Streisand and Gibb, won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1981, and was a No.3 Billboard Hot 100 hit. The first single "Woman in Love" became one of the most successful songs of Streisand's music career and spent a total of three weeks at the No.1 position in the Billboard chart. "What Kind of Fool", another duet with Gibb, reached No.10. The fourth single, "Promises", a more disco-oriented track released in May 1981, reached as high as No.48. This song was also released on Streisand's first commercially-released 12" disco single as a solo artist following her 1979 duet with Donna Summer and two "promotional" 12" singles released for "Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over) in 1975, and "The Main Event/Fight" in 1979.

Amazon.com Review By Elisabeth Vincentelli - Guilty may well be Barbra Streisand's best pop album. At the peak of her late-'70s popularity, she hooked up with the Bee Gees' Barry Gibb, who himself was basking in his Saturday Night Fever glow. Gibb wrote and produced most of the material on 1980's Guilty, and he supplied background vocals as well as co-leads on two tracks. The results are still completely bewitching. "Promises," for instance, is a lounge-like dance number and Babs sounds simply fabulous--sexy, lighthearted, passionate, playful--all at once. "Life Story" is a wild epic, and "Make It Like a Memory" keeps soaring up and up into a stratosphere of shag-carpeted luxury. Even Gibb's wavering vocals are great--and not a little like a disco version of Mandy Patinkin. And of course, the hits are out of this world: "Woman in Love" and "What Kind of Fool" are titanium-plated classics the likes of which Streisand has not topped since. A guilty pleasure, sure--just indulge.
