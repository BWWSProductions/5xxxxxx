Tabletop Machining gives the reader not just the "hows" but also the "whys" of machining practices using the lathe and milling machine for metalworking. Included are down-to-earth descriptions as well as detailed photos and drawings. In addition, a large selection of project photos illustrates the amazing work that has been produced by craftsmen using small but capable miniature machine tools. Though the tools used in the examples highlight the small end of the size scale in machining, the theories and practices can be applied to metal working on machines of any size. 
Whether you're a newly graduated engineer or a beginning machinist, this book will help you gather some real, practical knowledge of how machines and machinists actually go about working with metal. This isn't theory, but rather it details "real world" practices and gives a good insight into the challenges faced by machinists. Too often, good craftsmen are stopped from venturing forth because the only information available shows just the technically perfect way to do things rather than the simple, practical methods everyone really uses. For those wishing to design and build their first metal parts, it is a perfect starting point, as it highlights the fun that comes from making small projects of precision and beauty.
