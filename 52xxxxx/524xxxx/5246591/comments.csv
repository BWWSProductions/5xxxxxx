,netfoxx,2010-01-17T23:23Z,PB OPs please ban this idiot for totally destroying a great movie. Amateur editing with a giant logo on top of the screen throughout the movie.. Wrong aspect ratio.. Poor quality etc. Now I really do sympathize with the Movie Companies. If I could help prosecute this asshole I would.
,kodikos,2010-01-19T11:11Z,"hey netfoxx try to download one of the 100 pulp fiction's torrents, if you do not like experiments. Also yo can  go and lick a film company director @ss (once you sympathize them) and prosecute me together (do not forget TPB site) ... that was the point from the begining to do sth interesting about your life. thanx for the comment anyway..."
,steve.torment,2010-02-22T05:13Z,I'm really excited to watch this. I think splicing the film scenes to put it in chronological order is a really cool idea. If it turns out that there is a splash logo throughout the entire movie I'm going to be seriously pi$$ed off. If you want to show off a film experiment then make it watchable. I would never watch through something with a logo splashed over it.
,steve.torment,2010-03-22T06:23Z,"Hey kodikos, cool idea but you're a douche for water marking the entire thing. Why? And if you absolutely absolutely absolutely had to, why wouldn't you just make it popup for 10 seconds every couple of minutes?

This was interesting but the watermark ruined it for me. 3/10"

While you're at it why don't you put arms on the Venus DeMilo."
,kodikos,2010-03-31T10:35Z,thanks for the feedback. An iso with better settings coming up as soon as possible.
