,Tattareee,2009-12-13T01:34Z,Why is it so slow? Last week it went really fast! 
,howkay,2009-12-13T02:14Z,"Can anyone give me some advice, please. For the last few weeks, when I try to download a torrent from TPB I get the message -- Problem connecting to tracker  (date)

This ONLY happens with TPB (I can use, say EZTV just fine). The thing is TPB has my shows first and is really the only place I know now with music.

Any ideas?

(Mac user using tomato)

I would love you forever if you can help!"
