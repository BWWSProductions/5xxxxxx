,steve_swv,2009-12-18T07:53Z,While a bit more graphic than necessary in parts this is definitely one of my favorite from Moore.  Thanks

,JBNyen,2009-12-29T07:45Z,The drawings are very low quality - i.e.  5 years old can draw better.   Not really worth a dime. 
,kludge420,2009-12-30T20:33Z,"I'd have to agree with JB. The ""art"" isn't very good though I would say it's more along the lines of a talented High School or maybe Jr High student but well above a 5 year old. Jackson Pollack is more like what a 5 year old would paint... just better."
[T],brodahisou,2010-01-11T13:05Z,"There's a lot more going on with the art than you think.

The individual sections dealing with the three titular ""girls"" all have distinct visual layouts and themes used for their chapters. Alice's sections feature ovals reminiscent of her looking-glass; Wendy's are shrouded in tall, dark rectangles reminiscent of the shadowy Victorian-architecture of her time, and Dorothy has wide panels in imitation of the flat landscape of Kansas and prominently featured silver shoes.

Each volume has ten chapters, and each chapter contains eight pages. This format initially derived from its original serialized publication in Stephen R. Bissette's anthology Taboo, but it also reflects Lewis Carroll's multi-layered usage of mathematical allusions and links as there are 8 squares in the length of a chess board (a prominent feature of Through The Looking-Glass, and the key to becoming a queen in both game and book) as well as his poem The Hunting Of The Snark being An Agony In Eight Fits.

The regular chapters are interspersed with pornographic pastiches of works by artists and authors of the period, presented as chapters in Monsieur Rougeur's White Book, a collection of illustrated pornographic stories. Each chapter is in the style of different authors and artists of the period: these include presentations in the styles of Colette and Aubrey Beardsley, Guillaume Apollinaire and Alfons Mucha, Oscar Wilde and Egon Schiele, and Pierre LouÊØès and Franz von Bayros."

also I think its hard for people to ""get"" older art without the force of nostalgia or some sort of interest in academic culture.  We are, as a whole, a very image-jaded world... and old-style comic art just doesn't have the rapid accessibility or energy to keep up. "
