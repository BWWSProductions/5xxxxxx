Plot



After "hooking up" with a series of guys at a house party, April is the talk of her high school. Her best friend Michelle, envious of all of April's attention, decides to try and follow in her footsteps and become more sexually forward. At the same time, their mutual friend Caroline has become so infatuated with her older boyfriend Ryan that she doesn't realize he's just using her. All the while, John, spends the week informing his two best friends, Colin (April's repressed and confused brother) and Tyler (the subject of Michelle's crush), about obscure sexual urban legends he reads about online, that just somehow end up managing to come true. Throw in the naive principal Dr. Jordan, who also happens to be Michelle's father, and Mr. Kimbal, a chemistry teacher trying desperately to dodge repeated seduction attempts from his students
