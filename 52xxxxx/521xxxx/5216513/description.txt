Review:

For many raised in bygone eras, Burl Ives must seem like jolly old St. Nick himself. With his deep, polished voice and a Yuletide countenance that speaks volumes of merriment, Ives on record is still the closest thing we have to a real singing Santa Claus. Here, in a fine collection of his holiday work, he interprets 15 standards that range from his trademark "A Holly Jolly Christmas" and "Silver and Gold" (from the still popular Claymation film Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer) to the bigger production numbers of "Silver Bells" and "What Child Is This?" In between, there's that distinctive, finely honed folk voice playfully delivering the goods on "The 12 Days of Christmas" and "The Little Drummer Boy." Got the urge for a feel-good, timeless sing-along? Ives is the one to lead the party.
