These are the first five books of the Vampire Diaries series by L.J. Smith, read by Rebecca Mozo. 

I have split each book up into their chapters.  I've grown tired of audio books and them being broken up in random places.  

These are fixed.  Someone brought it to my attention that something was wrong with chapter 15 of "The Fury", so I fixed it, and now here it is.

Enjoy.

The sixth Vampire diaries book comes out on February 9th of 2010!
