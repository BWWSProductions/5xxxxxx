Chocolate Doom (v1.2.1) ppGame

Chocolate Doom is a Doom source port which aims to behave as closely as possible to the original DOS Doom executables. This includes being compatible with all demos, configuration files, and savegames that works with the original executables. Thus, it provides the same "feel" as DOS Doom (display and input should behave the same), and as far as possible, provides all the same features that are available using the DOS version.
	
The port's name is wordplay with the term vanilla Doom sometimes used by Doom fans (especially those regularly using modified source ports) to refer to unmodified Doom engine behavior or to the out-of-the-box executables. 
	
Like DOSBox and ScummVM, the port is based on SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and will run on many different platforms, processor architectures, and operating systems. This includes Microsoft Windows (NT, 95/98, XP, Vista, 7), Linux, Mac OS X, and BSD.

This release will not create a shortcut ChocolateDoom because this particular emulator does not run by itself without specifying a .WAD first. 

Coming soon: ppGames for Classic Doom!

'Built on LT technology' ... This release will be at its most useful 
if using LastOS Team's SetupS or ssWPI

Please read the included ".app" or ".ppg" file for details about the 
associated application or game, such as description, shortcuts and 
links, and other installation details. For example, look for files 
named "SetupS.app", "ppApp.app", or "ppGame.ppg" and open with your 
favorite text file reader/editor.
