Why not expose the lies surrounding the round earth, the wonderous glories of the Third Reich, the fact that the Holocaust never happened.  What no monkey-man slurs about Obama.  You must be slipping.

Folks, this is nothing more than anti-intellectual, pro-authoritarian garbage brought to you by the KKK, whoops, I mean the Republiocan Party of Amerika.  Sieg Heil!  Nothing to see here, hence the fact that there are only three leechers and the fact that even the seeder can't be bothered to seed his garbage.

The only Pale Horse here is the seeder's desire to wipe liberal democracy and scientific inquiry from the face of the Earth.  I suppose he wants to pick up where Stalin and Hitler left off.  I guess he inhereted more of the monkey genes in his family line.  Ha!"
