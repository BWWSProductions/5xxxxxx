Plot outline:
When a gypsy caravan arrives in Fairview, the conservative judge Phillips forces the gypsies to leave town. Meanwhile the gluttony lawyer Billy Halleck, who has difficulties to reduce his weight, successfully defends the mobster Ritchie Ginelli in court. During the night, he celebrates with his partner and wives at a dinner party. While driving back home, his wife Heidi pleasures Billy during which he accidentally runs over the old gypsy Suzanne Lempke, the daughter of the patriarch Tadzu Lempke. During the trial, Billy omits the reason of the accident; the chief of police Duncan Hopley perjuries; and the bigoted judge declares Billy not-guilty. The next day, Billy, Duncan and Phillips are cursed by Tadzu, who puts a hex on each one of them. Billy gets thinner and thinner and while seeking out Tadzu to ask him to remove the spell, he suspects that his wife is having an affair with his doctor and friend Mike Houston. Billy feels that his life is running out and asks for help to Ritchie to convince Tadzu using his method to call off the jinx.
