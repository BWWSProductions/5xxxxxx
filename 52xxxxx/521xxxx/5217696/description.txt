If you like the scores for western films or TV shows, you will love this collection. They sound just the way you remember them, and the City of Prague Philharmonic do a terrific job. It's a great collection, and you may not necessarily like each of the cuts. Beware, though: There are many great ones, and some of them will get stuck roaming around in your head for a long time!
