Fink was born in Cornwall and grew up in Bristol. Fink's household was a musical one as his father was a folk musician and his mother was a music manager. As a teen and during his career's early years, Fink listened to house, acid jazz, Orbital and The Orb, which he described as a generational thing. He earned his degree in History and English in Leeds and signed with Kikin' Records, as EVA, shortly thereafter. Fink's musical background began with remixes, DJ sets and electronic hip hop. He also worked as a club promoter in London.[1]

Fink's recording career began with Ninja Tune's release of his debut album Fresh Produce in 2001, a well received chill-out set that fitted neatly with the output of the label. However, it was his second release, 2006's Biscuits For Breakfast, that defined his style and began to bring his name to a wider audience. He became the label's first traditional singer/songwriter.

Built around his bluesy voice, finger-picking acoustic guitar and the stripped-back live rhythm section, Biscuits boasted a fledgling pop sensibility while retaining the signature Ninja Tune vibe - a fact not lost on a swelling crowd of industry luminaries, notably Zero 7, who invited Fink to support them on their UK tour, and Nitin Sawhney, with whom Fink guested at the 2006 Electric Proms.

A follow-up, entitled Distance And Time, was released through Ninja Tune on 8 October 2007, and featured the production work of Andy Barlow, formerly of Lamb. Lead track This Is The Thing was featured in one of Mastercard's Priceless series of television adverts, as well as episodes of Friday Night Lights and Lie To Me.    * Fresh Produce (2001)
