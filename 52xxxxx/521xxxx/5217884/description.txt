Whatever your reasons for wanting to take your French further, in this course you will find everything you need to become an accomplished speaker and writer of the French language. 
It is not necessary to have studied Hugo French in Three Months, although we do sometimes refer to it in the grammar explanations in this book, in case you need to revise some elementary grammar. Where such revision is essential, we we will provide it in the Hugo Advanced French course.

The Hugo Advanced French course has been designed for those who already have a sound, basic knowledge of the language and who wish now to continue their studies with a view to becoming more proficient, more fluent and more confident in both the spoken and written language.
