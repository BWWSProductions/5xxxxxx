,Captain_Ron,2009-12-19T16:44Z,Next time give more sub's !!! :>
,DarkSorceror,2009-12-22T00:28Z,"""Subs"" as in ""subtitles"" or as in ""nautical vessels typically used beneath the surface of a body of water""?

In the former case, nothing to do with ME; I'm just seeding it. In the latter, I suggest you watch ""The Phantom Menace"" and orgasm when you see the Gungan city."

,Mikeman2000,2011-08-12T06:20Z,"Actually, yeah. I'd like the purist edition as well. Not that I don't like this, it would just be nice to watch it otherwise."
,Mikeman2000,2011-08-12T18:39Z,"@thejellyjam I found the purist edition. You're welcome.
