Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope - Revisited
Fan edit by Adywan
PAL/DVD9 (Dual-Layer) version

This is a fan created, not-for-profit project for entertainment purposes only. 
You must own the official "Star Wars: A New Hope" DVD before downloading this fan edit.

Adywan spent two years to produce what all agree is the best fan edit of the original Star Wars film. This award-winning feature is complete with fixed and added special effects alternative dialogue, masses of fixed continuity errors, and of course HAN SHOOTS FIRST.
