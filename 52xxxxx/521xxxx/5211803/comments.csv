,LeGra,2009-12-18T01:47Z,"Well...I finished the download.  It's REAL, but it's just the v1.1 incl Retro Drums Version, which has been out for over a year now..  v1.5 is out now......much better."
,rohagymeg,2010-02-13T16:14Z,I upped the 1.5.1 update
,LeGra,2010-02-17T07:26Z,Apparently you must not know.....but the 1.5.1 update does not work with this.  Addictive Drums will not be able to find the Sample Library.
