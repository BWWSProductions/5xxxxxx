                           Fist / Myofist - Rock Ride
*******************************************************************************

OGG Vorbis encode from a cassette rip, nominal bitrate of 320Kbps. Did this rip
years ago with Audacity, it sounds OK for being captured from an old cassette,
but don't grab this expecting CD-quality sound, OK?
This was the bonus track on the cassette release of Fist's 1983 album, "In the
Red", and to my knowledge was never released digitally or on vinyl.
Cover JPG copied from DuchessNukem's torrent of the LP, on TPB.

PS
I forgot to mention, if anybody has a copy of the last episode of "Man Alive" (with the three devils posing as old men), I'd sure appreciate you posting it.
