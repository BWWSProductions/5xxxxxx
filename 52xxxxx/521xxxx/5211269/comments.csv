,sloshy,2009-12-15T03:19Z,Why is this copy slightly larger than the exact same copies right below them???  Smells like tuna.

,kallang,2010-01-09T16:32Z,"I haven't downloaded it yet. I'm little hesitated, TRYHOSTING said this film required 3XPLAYER. As I know, if any film asked for 3XPLAYER, it's FAKE."
,bychance,2010-01-17T16:16Z,"Like Moocheet said, it's out of synch later in
the movie. It is a camvid and should be described so in the title. Video quality is 
only about 6/10, sound 7/10. For a TS XVID
this is not good enough. 3X player?, plays fine with Nero7."
