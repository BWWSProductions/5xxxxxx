,RealBeats,2009-12-15T03:27Z,Please Seed!
,RealBeats,2009-12-15T03:45Z,Add More Tracker to make download faster and seed for us
,DL_King,2009-12-15T17:57Z,"This consistently happens, the only people that ever complain about seed speed are always users that have never uploaded anything to the bay or probably anywhere that just don't seem to understand what initial seeding is or that a seeder to leecher ratio of 3:500 means that until the initial seed is complete the speed is limited. And how many more trackers do you want I have 15.

That being said I will be adding an extra seed source in the next hour to try help deal with the large volume of leechers. Hopefully after downloading people will be good enough to seed and make this a great torrent. I'm guessing that initial seed will complete approx noon friday depending on how many more leechers we get and whether people are limiting their U/L sppeds.

For anyone who wanted to know these are all HDTV rips

Enjoy and please seed"

After you finish downloading just let the file remain active in your torrent agent and continue until your ratio reaches 1.00 or higher"

,mwraper,2010-02-03T00:27Z,"hey there, downloaded the torrent because i still haven't seen the last episode of season 4!?!?!? what player should i use to watch these? Windows media player does not seem to want to play it, nor does quick time. I would love some help on this =)"
,DL_King,2010-02-03T00:53Z,"@mwraper 
Try VLC player, you can find it's site with Google. It comes with a pack of codecs and should allow you to most everything.

@StarMatt 
Sorry for the slow response time. As for subtitles I'll upload a torrent with the english, french and spanish subtitles later today."
