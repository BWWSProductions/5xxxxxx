,the81,2011-03-24T03:53Z,are subs hardcoded??
,hoodaya,2011-06-13T22:54Z,"subs are hardcoded swedish subs, as the title suggests and it is missing translation into english. condsidering that the movie is 1/3 in spanish dialogue i recommend that this shld only be for those that understand swedish only. movie still watchable if you understand english only, but you'll be missing out a quite a large proportion of the movie.

V: 9
A: 9

Great movie"
