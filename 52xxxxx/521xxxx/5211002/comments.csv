,nasim2010,2009-12-14T09:29Z,is it original windows 7? 
,chuckmamuck,2009-12-14T13:24Z,"thankyou lastivka.
works perfectly, no problems, no fuss, burnt to disk and upgraded an acer laptop from vista to this. also did a clean install on a custom built desktop and both work perfect and installed without problems. i used the 1.7.7 loader to activate and all is good and up to date thru microsoft update. 
just so everyone knows, this is the retail version and totally untouched and as it would be if you purchased it.
dl'd in 11hrs which is good for a new torrent of this size.
thanks again uploader, excellent torrent."

,chuckmamuck,2009-12-16T03:36Z,"people enquiring about serial keys and activation.
just use the loaders from 1.6.9 to the latest 1.7.7 by daz. i always used the 1.6.9 and it never let me down and on this install i used the latest 1.7.7 and it works perfectly also. theres plenty of them uploaded on here, just search windows 7 activator, or some call them loader. after install when windows asks you for a product key just click next and you'll go to desktop and will have 30 days to activate. then click on the loader, leave it set to default cus thats the latest and click install, wait a few secs until it tells you to reboot,reboot and ya activated and all genuine. theres advanced settings in the loader for different manufacturers certificates and keys but u dont need to touch them if u dont want to."

,dkzmich,2009-12-18T22:08Z,Can i install it without removing vista?? i really want to try it :)
,chuckmamuck,2009-12-19T06:00Z,"dkzmich..
just do an upgrade from vista to this, i guarantee you wont want to go back to vista after using 7 for a few days. i really liked vista and 7 is basically what vista should of been, it improves on vista in every way in my opinion, and its alot faster too. ive been using 7 since july and i wouldnt want to go back to vista.
if you want to keep vista you can create a partition on ya hd and use it as a dual boot, when you start ya pc instead of just booting it wil ask which os you want to boot with. id just upgrade tho if i was you."
,FearGrump,2009-12-19T20:24Z,Will my apps and files go away is i download windows 7?? really afraid to download cause i need alot of the stuff for school.
,budsterd,2009-12-20T02:55Z,feargrump when you install windows 7 your given the choice of doin an upgrade where your files will be left intact or a custom install where everything will be wiped out but on my install a folder was created called 'old windows' where all the old files were stored. That may or may not happen for you but it will tell you when you do the install. Best make a backup and I always prefer a clean install.
