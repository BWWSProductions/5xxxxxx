@Procrasturbate:
Sure, have fun with your 'genuine' firmware then, missing out all the fun of playing the latest games. ;-)
This firmware is 100% ok! "
,CAMILEON,2009-12-19T03:40Z,"im reluctant in downloading this firmware because I have my previous games/saves, will it have an effect or something to my previous games? "
,magic_phil,2009-12-20T16:59Z,No effect whatsoever!! It will not effect anything other than the firmware!!!  But when altering anything its good advice to make a backup. Hope this helps.
,Devil_Spawn,2010-03-29T15:52Z,what do you do with it??
,fadriz,2012-04-20T13:30Z,"Thank god you still have this copy, downloaded & tested it, works like a charms. Thank you.

Minor issue was when I download this torrent, it became an unknown file: ""DSTT Unoffical Firmware 1.17a12 Fixes many Games"" without any extension, I extract it manually using WinRar. Hope if anyone encounter same issue can use this method to resolve it."
