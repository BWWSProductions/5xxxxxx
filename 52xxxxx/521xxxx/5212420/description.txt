Game Details:

Set in the zombie apocalypse, Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2) is the highly anticipated sequel to the award-winning Left 4 Dead, the #1 co-op game of 2008.

This co-operative action horror FPS takes you and your friends through the cities, swamps and cemeteries of the Deep South, from Savannah to New Orleans across five expansive campaigns.
You'll play as one of four new survivors armed with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons. In addition to firearms, you'll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan.

You'll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. You'll also encounter five new â€œuncommonâ€ common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen.

Helping to take L4D's frantic, action-packed gameplay to the next level is AI Director 2.0. This improved Director has the ability to procedurally change the weather you'll fight through and the pathways you'll take, in addition to tailoring the enemy population, effects, and sounds to match your performance. L4D2 promises a satisfying and uniquely challenging experience every time the game is played, custom-fitted to your style of play.

Here's how to play without Steam mucking everything up, and how to update without the need for Steam:


Prerequisites:
Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 - Download and install: 32-bit or 64-bit
Microsoft's .net Framework 3.5 - Download and install .net 3.5

After installing latest full/incremental update and/or hotfix, Please patch the game with the Loader again..

III. Patch Game and play with Stryder's Loader:
 No reg-fixes needed.  Less CTDs than RevLoader.  Best method to play SP, LAN, and online.

First make a backup of your origianl left4dead.exe before installing. 
Install L4D2_Stryder_Loader_dec8.
Run IniGen.exe in root L4D2 folder to generate a custom stryder.ini file for your system and
set your in-game name.

NOTE: Stryder's Loader will generate a log file [stryder.txt] and an error message after exiting the game.

IV. Add Setti as the MasterServer:
1. Download MasterServers.vdf from here: http://css.setti.info/code/masterserver/
2. Create a folder named 'config' inside the 'bin' folder. [Ex. C:Program FilesLeft 4 Deadbinconfig]
3. Copy MasterServers.vdf to the config folder, right click and set its attribute to read-only.
4- Go to your L4D shortcut [used to launch game]. Right click it and select properties.
5- In the shortcut tab, add -console -serverbrowser to the end of the target line. Click Apply and OK.
