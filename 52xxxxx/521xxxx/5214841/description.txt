Permission To ROCK(mp3 320 kbs)ICM369
_____________________________________

After rocking out to the well compilated Air Guitar 3, 
I was a quite displeased to find "The LAST Air Guitar Album 
in the World...EVER!!" in bold letters. 

Then I found this recently released album in the shops, 
Permission to ROCK. 

The track list was the thing that really got me, It seemed 
that the best songs from the previous Air Guitar albums had 
been compiled into here (a compilation of a compilation if-
you will) plus 2 fantastic songs from rock revival chart 
toppering newcomers The Darkness. 

The album is a great rock collection to listen to, dispite 
the lack of rock monsters like AC/DC, Iron Maiden, 
Guns N' Roses and Def Leppard. Nearly all the best is here 
from Black Sabbath, Rainbow, Judas Priest and Deep Purple 
to Akice Cooper, Motorhead, van Halen and David Lee Roth 
(Oh yes, Diamond Dave as well). 

This album is a must-have for any rockers record collection, 
and if you're new to the wide world of rock music; 
Buy this album and re-educate yourself.
