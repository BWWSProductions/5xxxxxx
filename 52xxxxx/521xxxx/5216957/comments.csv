You must have an ISO image file of W7 to create the DVD or USB. If you have it, it's possible that the file isn't good, maybe corrupted or else. I was using it with different ISO files with no problems, but bear in mind that it works with Windows 7 images only."

The file you then download must be placed in the same folder as the ISO image. Run the application, a quick cmd prompt will flash. Try the windows usb drive maker again and it should work. Worked for me!"
