,w-mute78,2009-12-16T00:58Z,"this childish vermin boab is everywhere.... How is it that he is allowed to post still.  I starting to think the mods here exist just to fan flames (and, occasionally, it seems, spark matches of their own). Because when you need one, they are nowehere to be found.  And they have their little 'contact us' option... Which says wrong code every single time I try it.  I was angry when MN caved. Now I'm starting miss it.  Great job on the bigger file, deuce, looked real nice.  Now, I have called into question the mods ability to police their own backyard, I bet this post gets disappeared while Boab is still off looking for people's days to ruin."
