And another re-up to celebrate :)

After 2 months of hard work, I finally present to you, the great comic Idees Noires, in english. I spend the last 2 months scanning it, translating it, editing it, and so on, just so you can all enjoy yet another great euro comic, since noone appearantly want to release this in english :(.

As the title, Franquins Black Ideas might suggest, these stories explore depressive and horrific fantasies, all drawn with dramatic use of black on white. Suicide, execution, industrial recklessness, ecological disaster and hunting accidents are some of the themes darkly illustrated in this body of work. The series contrasts sharply with Franquins other comic strips such as Gaston Lagaffe, Spirou et Fantasio, and the Marsupilami.
