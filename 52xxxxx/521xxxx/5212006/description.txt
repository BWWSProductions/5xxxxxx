Ok so i was messing around, putting a DVD together for a friend who is stuck in the hospital....  get well soon uz ma maaaan!!

turned out ok. 

Not the best quality but still pretty good. thesource was from dvdrips!! but here you have 5 films on 1 dvd9 disc.   (DVD9 IS DUAL LAYER  !!!)


ANYHOO it occurs to me that there will be a small percentage of ppls who might find this worth the download.  ie.  People who don't want to or don't know how to add to dvd themselves and can also download faster than they can convert to dvd.  This tied my computer up for about 4 hours.

as i have taken sooo so much from the file-SHARE ing comunity i guess it wont hurt to give a bit back.  And if i start a new craze... then fine i will be a hero on wikipedia!!

so here is what you get.


Pandorum[2009]DvDrip[Eng]-FXG

Street-Fighter.The-legend-of-chun-li.2009.DVDrip

Zombieland (2009) DVDRip XviD-MAX

G.I.Joe.The.Rise.Of.Cobra.2009.DvDRip-FxM

on 1 .iso    just open this file with your burning software.  right click>>open with>>dvddecrypter.



All films were downloaded from TPB.  and added to DVD with "VSO ConvertXtodvd"
