,ArcImpulse,2010-01-03T23:58Z,"Okay, I just got done downloading.
I started viewing it and it seems there are black bars in the encoding. I pretty much WTF'd.
Are the black bars from the source material or did something go wrong when ripping?"

,Dogger55,2012-05-29T05:34Z,"You can get Gethyper's subtitle at the link below. My equipment doesn't like the .m2ts format, so I created a single .MKV file with subtitles using MKVMerge. It took about 3 minutes, and works well with VLC.
