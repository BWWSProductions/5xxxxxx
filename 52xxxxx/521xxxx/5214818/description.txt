MOVIE TRIVIA....Denzel Washington was cast in this film because of a trip to a doctor. He ran into director Tony Scott in the waiting room of a medical office and the two men started chatting. Scott had not seen Washington in person since they worked together on Crimson Tide (1995). Scott happened to see Dakota Fanning in I Am Sam (2001) the night before and seeing Washington made Scott think using of the two actors together.. PLEASE SEED it so others can enjoy it to.
