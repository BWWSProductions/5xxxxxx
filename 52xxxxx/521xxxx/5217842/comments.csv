,RatRanger,2009-12-15T17:22Z,"i rather suspect the excuse will be the the same as the one used before dare bear ""A Network Issue"" lets hope that you don't use the same company and the one in your advertisement filled file mrsjs"
,Dare_Bear23,2009-12-15T17:31Z,"Thanks ratranger, but does this mean the movie will not complete downloading then i am assuming that it will stay stuck at 94.9% which is a shame because it usually takes around 2 hours for me to download a movie as my download speed is quite slow.  If the uploader can sort out the problem it will be very much appreciated for the sake of 5.1% as it seems every one is stuck at the same level from the comments i have read :("

First of all let me tell you that you are not the only one who is facing this problem , it is "" may be "" a tracker issue because i am uploading it from last night non stop yeah non stop my computer SMPS is heating up more than a microwave and the most strange thing is that i can only upload at 30/kbps though i am on T1 plan .. i am seeding seeding and seeding ..

First of all it wasn't an excuse , it was a network problem but i call to my ISP they said everything is alright at there end , so it must be tracker issue coz i am only getting 30kbps fucking speed

Acc. to my calculation with 30kbps and total amount of i uploaded this file , then within few min / hours you download will be completed.

plz co-operate with me because i can't do anything to increase the speed and though i don't know what is the problem that i am only able to upload at 30kbps

,manoharpandey,2009-12-15T18:05Z,I feel the feed is being distributed evenly so 1 seeder with 30 kbps upload speed seeding to 1551 odd leechers seems a great odd. If we stop leeching and let the number of seeders increase the problem might be solved. I am going to wait.....................
