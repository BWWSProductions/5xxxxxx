,Elros,2009-12-19T04:09Z,What is the source of this file? As far as I know Ponyo hasn't been released to Blu-Ray yet so where did this version come from? HD-TV perhaps?
,Sheepdude,2009-12-25T08:03Z,"@Elros

Has it been released on BD in Japan? If so, it could be the Japanese BD video with the English audio from the dvd muxed in."
,carrollje,2009-12-26T14:46Z,Audio keeps speeding up past the video
,Garganfunker,2009-12-29T04:42Z,Thank you for upload. Is it possible to get more ghibli movies in HD please ?

[T],[D],2010-03-12T22:53Z,"If audio and video get desynced, your pc is not powerful enough to play the video properly. Use coreavc decoder and a good dualcore (c2d 2.2 ghz should be fine)."
,Pixelmari,2010-05-26T03:17Z,English Sound is WAY OFF
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-06-04T11:59Z,"This movie is absolutely brilliant! One of the best of 2009. Also, the quality in this release is pristine.

V/9
A/10

Don't know anything about English audio being out of sync, I watched it with Japanese audio, of course."
,fillmalei,2011-08-07T12:51Z,"Excellent quality and good movie, thanks!!!!"
,Pedrojkan,2011-12-17T23:55Z,"This is such a great movie, I've seen it a couple of times already in the theaters with the kids and I didn't get bored a single time! If Blu-ray wasn't so out of touch with the modern times, I'd buy it on BR as well. But as things are, that's not happening.
I'd gladly donate ten bucks to Ghibli though. I wonder if they'd accept if I just sent them the money in an envelope... ?
;)"
,chang104,2012-02-10T07:54Z,Is this 3D? Cause it showed 2 split screens on my PC and the colour was out.  But it reverted to 2D when I restarted the media player.
