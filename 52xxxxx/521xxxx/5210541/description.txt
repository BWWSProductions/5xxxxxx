------------------------

One of my favourite albums of all time and the only Mortiis album I like. As far as I'm concerned the early "ambient" synthesizer stuff was cheap and laughable, and the later stuff was nothing more that a weak imitation of Nine Inch Nails.

This is Mortiis at his best.
