Howard 101
Geek Time
December 12, 2009
==================
Jason Kaplan, Jon Hein and Ralph Cirella get a full hour to geek out over topics they hold near and dear to their hearts. The may be major nerds, but they have Howard's blessing to discuss which comic book character is the strongest, which fast food restaurant has the best fries and which movies are the best. Do you care? Tune-in to hear the debates and call-in to join in the dorkfest.
