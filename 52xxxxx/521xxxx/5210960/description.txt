           The Vuillard family gathers: Junon and Abel, a daughter        
           Elizabeth and her son Paul, Henri and a girlfriend, Ivan,      
           his wife Sylvia and their young sons, and cousin Simon.        
           Six years before, Elizabeth paid Henri's debts and             
           demanded he never see her again or visit their parents'        
           home. Paul, at 16, has mental problems and faces a             
           clinical exam. Junon learns she needs a bone marrow            
           transplant if she's to live beyond a few months: thus the      
           dtente bringing all together. Two family members have         
           compatible marrow, but the spats, fights, cruel words,         
           drunken toasts, and somewhat civilized bad behavior            
           threaten all; plus Junon may simply refuse treatment. Do       
           we know ourselves?
