From the special features of the Cirque du Soleil DVD "Corteo".

The 45-minute "Through the Curtain: An In-Depth Look at Corteo" features comments from performers and others involved with the production, which they say is Cirque du Soleil's biggest touring show yet.



!!!Important note!!!

The French & Italian spoken parts have no subtitles because I don't speak French or Italian. So if someone could provide suitable subtitles everyone would be even more happy.
