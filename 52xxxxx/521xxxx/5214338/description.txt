Sending Orbs' third full-length release is the stunning Elaztiq Bourbon 5 by Funckarma,and though this is not new material, this album compiles for the first time on CD tracks from three back-catalogue
Funckarma titles: Elaztiq originally released on Neo Ouija from 2002; Bourbon Sounds on Delikatessen, also from 2002; and Part 5 on Dub from 2003.
Presumably due to the lack of space available on the CD format the title track from "Elaztiq" has been omitted from the compilation, which clocks in at hefty 77 minutes.As a bonus, however, the tracks have been lovingly remastered, the result being a blinding suite of futuristic,mirror-polished transmissions of super-premium quality.
