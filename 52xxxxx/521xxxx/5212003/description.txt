special holiday sneak peek of Season 2 of SPECTACLE: ELVIS COSTELLO WITH... featuring special guests Bono and The Edge. Premiering Friday, December 11 at 10 p.m. ET on CTV, the special episode marks the first time CTV's critically-acclaimed original music/talk series has been taped in Canada. The top-secret performance caught Torontonians by surprise last September, creating a fan frenzy when locals realized Bono and The Edge were appearing at CTV's historic Masonic Temple studio, joining an impressive lineage of rock royalty that have performed in the building. The rest of the seven-part season will be seen in its entirety as part of CTV's mid-season schedule.

Shooting in Canada for the first time, the episode was shot at one of the most renowned musical venues in Canada, the Concert Hall in Torontoâ€™s legendary Masonic Temple. This stage has seen the likes of music icons from David Bowie and The Ramones to Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones, creating a distinct musical culture and aura that sets the mood for the second season of SPECTACLE. A second episode of SPECTACLE was shot at the Masonic Temple earlier this month.
