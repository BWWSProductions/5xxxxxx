trhe 1997 one is a horror movie with a killer who reincarnates into a snowman, should have read the description befor d/l. how stupid.
besides, i downloaded all the leprechaun movies from BLITZKRIEG, so i though this one was the horror movie.

anyways, ont his movie video and audio quality are good, no complains.

im just gonna write this in uppercase so people don't commit my very same mistake::

WARNING, THIS IS NOT THE 1997 JACK FROST YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THIS IS A FAMILIAR MOVIE NOT A HORROR MOVIE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A FAMILY MOVIE THIS IS THE ONE, OTHERWISE YOU WONT FIND JACKFROST ON TEHPIRATEBAY!"
