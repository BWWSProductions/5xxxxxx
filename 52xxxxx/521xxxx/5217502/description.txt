Following an acrimonious split with Wind-Up Records, the Atlanta-based hard-rock act Alter Bridge soldiered on with 2007's BLACKBIRD, a set of post-grunge anthems staunchly in the vein of its debut, ONE DAY REMAINS. The former members of Creed ...    Full Descriptionhave clearly gelled with their new lead vocalist, Myles Kennedy, who often evokes Chris Cornell with his powerhouse singing, as best exemplified by the soaring single, "Rise Today."

Alter Bridge: Myles Kennedy (vocals, guitar); Mark Tremonti (guitar, background vocals); Brian Marshall (bass guitar); Scott Phillips (drums).
