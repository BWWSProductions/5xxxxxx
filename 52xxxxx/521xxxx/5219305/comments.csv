This was possible using the ICU RAR Slayer v1.1, but this one doesn't work anymore with versions after 3.80. Let's hope someone makes again another patcher that works for the newer versions too. I'm waiting too for it..."

,rantaman,2009-12-16T21:31Z,"Sorry not getting something.  I used to use opera to download my torrents and it was easy.  I now am using Windows 7 and the new Opera.  I click on the download this torrent and it shows an Opera download in my downloads tab.  When I try to open the file in my downloads folder, it just takes me back through a loop in an opera tab???  Does anyone know how I actually open the file once it downloads to my desktop?  It just shows as a torrent file, not a program or executable file... sorry for the dumb question.  I know I am missing something easy..."
,rantaman,2009-12-16T21:35Z,"I guess it is saving this as a .torrent file, shouldn't this save as a program file?  When I click on the .torrent file it just takes me through the download system again... help??"
,3reathmint,2010-01-01T17:46Z,ranta try a program like utorrent? you need a torrent client
,r155,2010-01-17T19:35Z,rantaman if you read this after clicking on the link be sure to click open not save.
