,Lliam,2010-04-25T17:17Z,"Why don't you have any info on the spec?

Anyway I'll get it, it's a trusted user, plus many seeds and peers.

I'll comment on the overall quality soon."
,XV087AA,2010-05-12T02:31Z,"Uploader's comment is incredibly vague and slightly misleading.

Anyone who stumbled across this would think it's just another 'Sound of Music'.

It's a heartfelt story of a mothers love and extreme sacrifice for her child. When madness consumes her, she takes refuge in the only joy she knows, music"
,GeneKellyJudyGarland,2010-10-26T14:26Z,"This is a good movie, but it will never be an another ""The Sound of Music"""
,bengi23,2011-04-25T17:38Z,"phenomenal film .. definitely one of my favourite's of all time. incredibly emotive and well made.

,Jazzdancer,2011-05-01T02:34Z,I was caught off guard by how great this movie is. Bjork was amazing and the movie really moved me. made me cry.  I have to watch the other two Lars films now.
,anouksp,2011-05-02T06:10Z,"I was devastated by how honest and raw this movie is. Bjork is nothing less than fantastic. I dare you not to cry.
I'm only downloading this because there are no spanish subtitles on the dvd. 
One of my favorite movies of all times. Thanks you for the upload. "
,salitrov,2011-08-23T06:57Z,"Great movie, audio went out of sync about half way through for me."
,cannyball,2011-09-21T05:51Z,"wonderful movie, brutally real. 
couple spots where the video freezes and the audio keeps going, but after about 5 seconds or so the video catches up"
,The_Abee,2011-11-18T10:41Z,"Well, The Movie Quality is nt 'That' much Awesome. It's just OK or Watchable . 

V- 7/10

A - 8/10.   

But, guys There's no other torrent with healthy seeds & peers , So that's the best option (no doubt)
here I post The Snapshots that uploader didn't post ( After almost 2 years )


Screen is little bit blurred . but Only option.

 Yep .!"
