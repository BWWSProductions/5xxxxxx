,joedashit,2010-04-29T12:17Z,"Ay great torrents man, just wonderin if you could upload the rocket german I.A course transcripts. Keep up the good work!"
,maccamac,2010-10-15T23:22Z,Thanks OP - thanks seeders
,Rebel232,2011-06-10T11:56Z,Generally .rar torrents are a fail because the downloader doesnt know if they are getting x megabytes of ads and viri or the material they want. Thanks anyway.
,Asuka23,2011-07-27T00:05Z,"When I downloaded this, it just gave me a RAR file. When I tried to open it it said ""windows cannot open this file"" Do you know why that is? Can anyone help me please? Merci :)"
,manyfiles,2011-08-23T03:32Z,"rar files fly in the face of the very technology of torrents.  If you have multiple files, no need for cheap compression to save a few KB.  Users can get the files they want and leave the rest.  Also, few are worried about downloading 1GB these days."
,dkstoney,2011-09-21T05:56Z,"So don't download it then you fucking babies! Who gives a fuck what your opinion of what RAR files are and whether they're necessary or not? Get a fucking life!

Good torrent! Scanned...clean! Everything works! Thanks 123D"
,dkstoney,2011-09-21T05:59Z,"BTW, neither manyfiles nor Rebel232 have uploaded a single bit of data to TPB, so shut your fucking traps. I haven't either, but then I'm not criticizing peoples' methods of upload."
,JustAnotherApprentice,2012-05-20T01:48Z,Thanks a lot!
