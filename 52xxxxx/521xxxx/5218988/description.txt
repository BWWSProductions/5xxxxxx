1999 Hell is Here and 2000's Deathrace king, which I consider one of the best albums ever in the history of man (of course besides Lady Gaga's new genius work of art..) On the Metal Blade label. 

Blitzkrieg witchcraft - mass murder megaslaughter!
Madness, terror - the occult power of destruction!
Nuclear warfare - burning storms of radiation!
A-Bomb, Pure deathfuck - yeah, God really loves his children.

That about sums up the album. Seed. More to come.
