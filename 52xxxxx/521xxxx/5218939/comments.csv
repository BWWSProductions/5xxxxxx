No ""Lie to me in 720p"", now they won't be releasing this in 720p either.  It's like we're moving backward technologically.  What's the point of not releasing it in 720p?"
,miloshj,2009-12-15T19:22Z,"Why wouldn't they encode and release this in 720p? Low res only, it's like we're moving technologically backwards."

Thanks"

try finding time warp in regular res and not 720p.

dont get me wrong i love 720p but really slow motion is just fine in regular res.

why cant they just do both versions?"
