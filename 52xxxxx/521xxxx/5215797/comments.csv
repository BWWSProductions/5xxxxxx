I am new to PirateBay and have been downloading many blu ray rips from here. However the file size of your releases (4GB) is just mind boggling since they are all 1080p. I have so many 720p rips with DTS 1.5Mbps sound which are more than 6GB in size.

My main question is, why only Dolby Digital sound in all your 1080p rips ? Is DTS not possible ? If you release your rips as 1080p with DTS, there would be even more takers.

Also, why is your rip file size only 4GB while other 720p releases even, are more than 6GB ? 

Look forward to hearing from you. Thanks for your rips and keep up the good work. They are excellent in audio and video quality."
,VSG12777,2009-12-15T05:00Z,Thanks for your replies guys. I like bricktophd's rips but I really miss the DTS sound. Hence the question.
