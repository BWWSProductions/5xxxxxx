when i download torrents some of them are just 1 file for example a family guy file is 173MB, those i can download and play with VLC player.

But it happens a lot that the torrent is devided in 15 little file of each 19,0MB, and those i can download but I can't ever watch them after.

can someone please help me?
thx"

Your a spoiler cunt, fuck you very much!

@Xenif

No, all episodes are perfect quality and well worth the download. Maybe check your media player settings before bad mouthing a torrent which is the complete opposite to your judgement

@sudokode

Thank you very much for the upload, just finished watching them in time, roll on season 5!"

I'm experiencing some problems while for playing the avi files.

Nothing I use can seem to read them (vlc, divx, wmp, quicktime, ...) and Gspot does not recognise any of the files.

Is anyone else experiencing these problems and is there a solution?"

Thanks for the up, just suggesting that the quality might be better in another torrent.
