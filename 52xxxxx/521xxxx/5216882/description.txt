All three albums. Nazz, Nazz Nazz & Nazz III Mp3 with covers. Todd Rundgren to me never came close to getting the recognition he deserved. Way ahead of his time. A true musical genius!!! These aren't in any way his best albums but lots of good songs on them. If you haven't already, check out his Todd Rundgren albums and his early Utopia band. His music and writing style still today "WOWs" me. I can't believe he's known for Hello It's Me. Great song but he has tons of songs that are better and never made the radio. Go figure. Again, ahead of his time I guess.
