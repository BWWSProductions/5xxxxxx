A great CD of traditional Christmas Music, some familiar but most less-so, with an old-English folksy twist. The Baltimore Consort is a first-rate group with an emphasis on authentic re-enactment instead of mere authentic reproduction, and always offer a wide variety of styles on their CDs.  Not everything on here is good, but sufficient imo to make this CD a worthwhile grab.

Thanks to TPB user BLUDANUBE for uploading the original APE torrents (https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4975341 and https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4953357).  I've noticed both copies are now without seeds, lack a full original to offer as reseed, and cant find my own copy of the CD!  Instead, I have compressed it to OGG q6, jigged tags around a bit to make them compatible with my other uploads, removed the padding files, and have reuploaded.

As often as I listen to Christmas music during the summer, its wider popularity tends to be somewhat more seasonal :)  Therefore I'll cease supporting this torrent after a couple of weeks.

Enjoy!
