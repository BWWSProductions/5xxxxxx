Please note that this is NOT the actual "Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair", which has never been released.

This is a fan edit of Kill Bill volumes 1 and 2 into one long movie to be closer to the way it was originally intended.

The Japanese cuts of the movies aren't available on Blu-ray yet, so I used the American cuts, so there are a few edits in Vol. 1 (most notably the fight scene with the Crazy 88 is in black and white)

Changes made:

"Kill Bill Vol. 1" title screen has been edited to just say "Kill Bill"

Cliffhanger and credits from Vol. 1 removed

Into from Vol. 2 removed


I've also included English subtitles for the foreign-language parts of the movie.

As a final note, the original source I used has some artifacts in parts of the movie, but they're pretty minor and shouldn't affect your viewing.

Enjoy!
