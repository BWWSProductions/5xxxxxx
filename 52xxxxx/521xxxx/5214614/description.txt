And a re-up of Inspector Canardo, a great euro comic from Benoit Sokal.

Inspector Canardo is an anthro comic that star the duck Canardo, an antihero trying to just get through life with enough money for booze and smokes, but who keep ending up in adventures he dont want to be involved in.
The world of Canardo are dark and gritty, and the stories are film noir inspired. Dont expect morality preaching, or happy endings.

This one is my favorite of the series, and the first comic that showed me how comics could be sad and bittersweet.

Only 1-5 have been scanlated so far, and since no more came out in danish, i am unable to continue the series, but i am working with a great group of people who are working on the rest, and hopefully the full series will be out someday...at the moment, 7 and 12 is also translated, but not retexted yet.
