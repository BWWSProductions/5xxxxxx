In 1958, Frank Sinatra recorded Frank Sinatra Sings for...Only the Lonely, one of five collections recorded for Capitol, consisting of saloon songs and bluesy ballads, lamenting lost love and heartache. Recorded over three days in Capitol's famous Studio A, Only the Lonely features sumptuous arrangements by Nelson Riddle who co-conducts here with Sinatra's resident concertmaster Felix Slatkin. The result is arguably his greatest ballads album.
