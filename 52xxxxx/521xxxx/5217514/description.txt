This is an experimental effort due to the coming demise of Pirate Bay. 

I have taught myself how to strip closed captions from a video and display them
in a text file. At my present level of knowledge, what results is the complete set of subtitles displayed one line at a time. In other words, I do not have them in a form as they appear when playing the original disc, two or even three lines at a time. 

I have begun to revise and improve the subtitles resulting from the closed caption text file from The Woman in White. But since I'm old and slow it will take me a long time, probably longer than the time from now to the end of Pirate Bay, particularly if I include similar work to be done on another movie which I have acquired: Middlemarch (1994).

This may all be a waste of my time and yours. But if it's possible to do I will continue seeding these two movies and periodically update and revise the contents
of their respective torrent files, bringing them up-to-date.

I will probably fail. But, at least you will understand what comes out at the end,
while being an on-going effort.

I am using .ssa format for subtitles for now, thinking I may attempt hard-coding them into the video sometime or other.

This may all be a lot of nonsense. But I cannot see that yet.
