But, please, don't hard-sub your rips. It makes it very difficult to watch them with any other subs. I'm not familiar with the .ssa format, but will look into it. The most common format is .srt, which just about all computer-based viewers can use. 
Oh, yes, ""the coming demise of Pirate Bay"" - Do you know something we don't? I though the motto is ""The Bay will Stay!""
Take care, and thanks for your work."
