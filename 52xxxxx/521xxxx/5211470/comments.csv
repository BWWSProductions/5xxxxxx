,Novawire,2009-12-12T10:53Z,Are these a new set of Audio Companions for the Korean product? I have a set I downloaded a few months ago and the narrator is speaking German. Are these the correct ones this time? Let me know either way.

This appears to be missing.  It appears to be missing from every posting of this group and else where on the net.

Since you're not the original poster (plagiarism) would the original poster please post the missing file.

This is amazing, considering that he goes around accusing others of this same thing.

I just saw it on another's recent posting and look what we have here.  I just had to make a comment to vindicate all of the people out there that may have been verbally assaulted by this guy.

Buy the way, You do post some good stuff. Keep it up."
