PLOT

In a remote region of the Sahara Desert, a sandstorm batters a deserted drilling station. Thomas ("Jack") Jackman, a security patrolman, battles through the high winds to find out why all contact with the station has been lost. Originally built for gas exploration, and then abandoned, the site had recently been taken over by a multi-national research team intent on drilling deeper into the earthâ€™s crust than ever before.
 

But now there is not a living soul left in the complex. Jack finds abundant food and resources, and some evidence of violence, including the destruction of all communications equipment. It is eerie, inexplicable and unsettling, but, stranded by the howling sandstorm, Mac is forced to stay the night.
