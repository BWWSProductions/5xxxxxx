,danmanchester,2009-12-12T14:52Z,"Many thanks VasiaZozulia!

So guys is this THE one we've been waiting for? :)

@ Loopmasters, I'm still using v3.2.11 and I notice on that particular version you posted comment that you got level 4 & 5 working. 

I was going to keep on using v3.2.11 for levels 1,2 and 3 of Spanish (Spain) and hope that someone could upload levels 4 & 5 eventually.

I guess what I'm asking is - is it better to use this version 3.4.5 or keep using v3.2.11? Is there any noticeable difference/advantage?

Appreciate any feedback, regards Dan."
,Shaamaan,2009-12-12T17:10Z,"I've had this problem since I started using Rosetta... it doesn't detect my microphone!

I'm using kX drivers and W7. If anyone managed to get the mic detection to work, I'd be grateful to know.

PS. I know there's a workaround; start a lesson with speech recognition disabled, and then turn it back on during the lesson... but it's still damn annoying to do so every time."

,Duffman0,2009-12-14T03:26Z,"Hey,
First of all I'd like to thank you for the torrent.  I have two questions:
1.  How exactly do you add a language?  I understand it has something to do with mounting CD's or something.  What program works best with this(I have win 7)?
2.  Is it safe to run this while my internet is connected?  How do I make sure it doesnt try to update or activate(if thats the main concern)?

Again thank you so much for this.  Cheers"
,Munky42,2009-12-14T03:46Z,"I used PowerISO to mount the ISO to a virtual cd drive, but there are others available for dl on this site, I just can't remember the names of the other programs.

This program is safe to run while connected to the net.  You might want to disable your virus scan program (if you have one.) before you install it.  Rosetta Stone will ask you to register but you can say no and it should not ask you again.  Also, it will look for updates, but again, you can just ignore them.

Now, I'm not an expert.  I remember reading that from another torrent of an older version of Rosetta Stone.  Hopefully the same will work with this version.

Good Luck and have fun."
,vitel,2009-12-14T10:14Z,Thanks a lot. It's really work!
,Shaamaan,2009-12-14T11:45Z,"To all those who gave me suggestions regarding my mic detection problem.

Thank you for all insight, and I will try all suggestions, but I fear the problem might stem directly from the fact that I am using kX drivers, which are pretty non-standard by their nature (albeit it's the only driver that allows me to manipulate and duplicate output as I see fit).

I did let RS access the internet during install however, especially since I did the same on my laptop and mic detection works fine there (please note; on my laptop I have the same OS, firewall and such; the audio drivers are of course different however).

I also read suggestions to try and rename the mic in the Windows sound settings to something that contains the word ""microphone"". No dice. Someone also suggested renaming the default playback device to ""line 1"", but this ended with similar results.

Please remember, that I CAN get RS to detect my voice; if I disable speech recognition before starting a lesson and then re-enabling it when it's already in progress then everything works fine. It's just that the silly app cannot detect the mic when it starts a lesson, and thus causes problems."
,Shaamaan,2009-12-14T12:05Z,"I was also thinking about copying over or manually modifying config files, if they exist, to include the mic information or at least see if they include anything at all... however, I cannot for the love of me figure out where RS keeps the configuration info. I've checked the registry, the Program Files folder, the AppData folder as well as the ProgramData folder. No luck on either of these locations, but perhaps I was looking for the wrong thing (I was mainly looking for ini / cfg files).

If anyone knows where RS might keep the various settings then please share this knowledge."
,grsher,2009-12-14T19:18Z,"Wooo Hooo, I finally solved my speech recognition problem ( error 1117). I had installed RS sucessfully but it turned out to be a Vista related problem for the speech recognition. I found the solution on the RS customer support page under troubleshooting.  Hope this helps anybody who is having a similiar problem."

,danmanchester,2009-12-15T17:51Z,"@380sig

How are you loading the languages? Are they burned to cd or are you using a virtual cd/dvd rom drive like Power ISO or MagicDisc or Daemon Tools. 

When you get to the ""add a language screen"" just fire up your virtual cd rom and browse to where you've saved the language ISO images, mount a language and then click continue in the RS screen and it will detect and install."

,The_crete_reaper,2009-12-19T00:04Z,"Duffman0,

Upon installing the program it will try to connect to the internet to register. If it cannot connect to the internet, it will ask you about registering later. Simply choose not to, and choose ""Don't ask again"". Also do the same when it asks to update it. From there on you can use the internet all you'd like."

Now that you have the RS3 application installed, you need to download the languages that you want to install. The languages come on CDs from Rosetta Stone, on three to five separate CDs, one CD per language level. Here on TBP they are uploaded as .iso files which are images of the CDs and can be mounted on a virtual drive such as is created by Daemon tools: http://www.disc-tools.com/download/daemon.

AFTER you mount a language .iso file, a folder will open with files and other folders visible in it; just close that window and start Rosetta Stone and click on ""Add a Language"" and then click Continue. RS will find the virtual drive with the language on it and will give you the option of installing it. After it installs it, un-mount that .iso file and mount the next language file. Click on ""Add another Language"" click Continue, and so on until you have all the languages or levels of one language installed that you want to learn. Unmount the last language file you used so that you don't get file access conflicts if you try to move or delete the .iso file.

Then click on Continue and follow the directions to start learning your language. Be sure you have a microphone connected and running before you start Rosetta Stone or you will get a fatal error!"

Be sure you have copied ""RosettaStoneVersion3.exe"" to the RS program files folder ""C:\Program Files\Rosetta Stone\Rosetta Stone Version 3"" (Win XP) and that the shortcut you use to start RS points to that folder, not a file within that folder.

If that doesn't allow you to use the application, you may need to uninstall RS completely and install a previous version that you can then use this version to update."

Generally, you should NEVER allow RS to update itself. Install any newer version you may want from whatever is uploaded here. An update may go beyond what is available here and not be cracked as yet. The level we are at now thanks to VasiZozulia should be sufficient for any level of any language you want to learn as long as it isn't Version 2."

1 Clear out any previous failed attempts - uninstall, run Regcure or Auslogics Boostspeed or whatever you like to clear any lingering registry entries. ""Your Uninstaller"" may be useful here. Open ""Action Centre"" then ""User Account Control Settings"", note where the slider is (usually 2), then set the slider to its lowest setting - ""Never Notify"". You will be told to reboot - click the reboot button

2 After the reboot, burn the Rosetta stone programme to CD. Mount the first ISO of your language. I used Ultra Iso, but there are many others just as good. I cannot be sure, but it seemed that RS ""looked"" at CD drives when installed, and could not seem to find them if they were not there when it was installed.

3 Using the CD you just burned, install RS program from it. It will open RS program, but that is not a problem as long as you never agree to activate or update. I found it best to install your languages before overwriting RS3.

4 Follow the prompt to install your language(s). When you are done, close RS

5 Open Windows Explorer as administrator, then open the ""Crack"" folder in either Win or Mac as appropriate, on your program installation CD you made earlier, copy the file ""Rosetta Stone version 3"" application and paste it to the Rosetta stone folder on your C: drive where the setup program has placed it. Windows will check you want to overwrite - the top option - click on that choice and you are done. Close windows

6 You should now be able to run the program - you will still get offers of activation and update. There is an update to data for RS Latin American Spanish, and there may be similar for other languages - don't take that up either unless you have a backup of what you have just done - I have not tried it yet but odds on it will knock your cracked program on the head

7 Return to the action centre and return the slider to its original position. Reboot as requested. I cannot be sure, but I think that after this if you want to install another language or level, you may have to go through this retting (in 1 above) again, before you can do it. I think the extra security in Win 7 blocks RS somehow


Can I say again - this is for windows 7 - I never had to alter security access in Win XP. There may be other ways of getting it to work, but I did have a lot of trouble getting the cracked Rosetta to find program disks or ISO's when none were installed with the genuine program, or when the security ""veil"" was in place

good luck

When I mount the language disk .iso using daemon tools, start 3.4.5 and direct it to detect the language disk it prompts me to try again, then tells me it can't find a language disk.

The language disk was detectable by two previous versions (2.x.x).

Another thing I've got questions about is this:  What happens if I decide NOT to use the cracked .exe?  I notice no difference as I'm able to start the program with/without using the crack.  Both ways it does the same thing - can't detect the language disk."

Anyway after installing the language it says that it has to be activated or I won't have access to all levels. It also states on the list of activated/not activated products that if I don't have internet connection I will be prompted to activate by phone. 
Well I couldn't activate online nor did I got a prompt to activate by phone... 
What do I do? 

Or maybe if I have a working, cracked RS I don't have to activate languages? 

Would be grateful for help.

To be exact days! but anyways, I am able to install the program and everything works great! However, when I try to apply a language it installs only so far then gives me a error. I was lucky with the Korean level 2 but installing the first, Chinese 1,2,3 I receive error 9121 and 9114 in the same error message. Has anyone found out how to fix this? I have searched high and low. This is my last resort. I have tried installing the program from rosetta's website also and still the same thing. Might it be my ISO files? I have tried all of the mounting programs from MagicISO, DAEMON, DTLight, Vurtual (something, it had an angry sheep on it :\).

3. Run Rosetta Stone. Choose to never register.

,moleksajr,2010-07-27T08:39Z,"I don't see why everyone is having so much trouble. It's just like any other crack. Install program, but DO NOT RUN IT! Copy crack into the program install folder. To be safe, I always restart my computer and run CCleaner (cleaner & registry) then restart again. I currently have this running on 4 computers!

As for the language packs. I download them, then burn them to CD using IMGBurn. I then start the Rosetta Stone program and install the language packs as desired. 

Just make sure that you do not update or the crack gets overwritten and the program is then unregistered. I simply made a firewall rule to not allow Rosetta Stone to communicate with the internet, hence not look for updates as well.

Thank you uploader for this flawless program and crack, as well as the MANY language packs that you have made available. The instructions that you have supplied are simple and complete to install this program without any problems."

-I removed all the stuff blocking Rosetta Stone and Flexnet (that thing i noticed that always install with rs) from accessing the internet, like in your Firewall. Don't do that if you haven't tried doing this before of course.
-I removed every file that had rosetta and flexnet in its name I could find on my windows hdd (again don't do that if you haven't tried to install it before) I recommend ""Search Everything"" a great software to find stuff on your comp 10x faster than windows explorer (shameless plug over.)
-Run CCleaner and let it correct errors in your registry.
START READING HERE IF IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME TRYING TO INSTALL.
-Install Rosetta stone from the Rosetta Stone v3.4.5.exe file.
-After it's done RUN THE PROGRAM, don't crack it yet, that's right.
-It should let you install the language pack you've mounted (i used daemon tools lite) Install it.
-After it will ask you to update your language pack, let it proceed and restart when it asks if you want to register, say never.
-Then close Rosetta Stone when all the updates and stuff are over, copy the crack over and run it again.
-If it gives you and error message do this: You'll notice a file called ""service_installer.exe"" in your rosetta stone folder, run it, yeah it does nothing, wait for windows to ask you if you want to try to reinstall the program with recommended settings, do it.
-Try running RS again, it worked for me at this point and every other time I reopened it."

1. Turned off internet, installed rosetta stone.

2. Unchecked ""start rosetta stone"" and closed the app.

3. Copied the crack and pasted it in to the rosetta stone 3 folder, got the usual nonsense about overwriting, and overwrote it. Rebooted computer.

3. Used Daemon tools to mount the image from the tagalog .iso on to my virtual drive. I also burned the .iso on to an actual cd.

4. Restarted rosetta stone, and got the screen asking for me to add a language pack, clicked ok and got the message, ""can't find language cd"" or whatever it said. (the language pack was visible in Windows Explorer on both the virtual and the actual cd drives""

I'm not trying to be mean, but have you never downloaded any kind of program from the internet and installed it? Simply double click the .exe file (or my preferred method is right click then choose run as administrator even if I'm logged in as admin). From there it's just like loading the .iso, especially since an .iso or any install disk simply contains the .exe file and is auto run when the .iso or disk is loaded.
Come on people, this is a great torrent! Don't keep making this harder than it really is. If this doesn't work on your system, it is your system or the user, and definitely not the torrent.

,mingrady,2010-08-19T08:01Z,"I am writing to report I finally got this thing working on my win7-64 bit, but not after endless trying and ample frustration. The key point is, it works. 

after 1st installation, I had numerous ""error 2133 there was an error in the application"". I tried many things I found from google, but nothing worked. I was about to give up, but I decided to give it a final try. Here's what I did: 

System: win 7-64 bit 

Steps: 

0) get one RS language(spanish, chinese, whatever)  cd disk ready, make sure it's a good copy burned from a good ISO file, not corrupted.

1) uninstall the failed RS; clean every RS director including the one under ProgramData.

2) run ""ccleaner"" to make sure all the RS registries are deleted.

3) reboot computer 

4) disconnection all internet connection: pull your eithernet cable, turn off wireless etc 

5) install RS crack:  follow the instruction in the torrent, install RS and its crack. 

6) Grant access: find the installed RS directory under ""program files (x86)"", right lick to access ""property""->""security"", and grant ""Full access"" to everyone: from administrators to everyone/users"". 

7) reboot computer again

8) again make sure no internet. 

9) run the cracked RS program, it will ask you to set up account and add a language. do that, otherwise next time you restart the program, it might have an ""2133 error"" just like what happened to me. 

10) now reboot and bring back internet, run RS as normal. 

I don't know which one of the above steps solved my problem, and that's how I got this RS crack to work on my win7-64bit after initial frustrations. 

thanks ~"

OK, for those of you who have been having trouble loading language levels read on......
I'm running WIN 7 Pro on a Toshiba laptop (not connected to the internet).  I DL'd this torrent.  It is beautifully clean..ignore your AntiVirus if it says otherwise.  I used PowerISO v4.7 to mount the image files.  Rosetta Stone (RS) could not find the language files.  I burned the CD's with IMGBurn and still the same problem.  I tried a different RS torrent with a different crack.  Still the same problem of RS not finding the language files, much less finding the CD Drive.  I kept getting the same result.  I spent 2 days online reading forums and came across comments about the latest version of Daemon Tools Lite(DTLite) being compatible with WIN 7.  I went to their website and DL'd the latest version - DTLite4356-0091 (free).  I crossed my fingers (OK, I PRAYED REAL HARD) after I ran DTLite setup.  And WALLA! It worked. JALAPENO! THANK YOU HESUS!
Here's the play by play...
1. DL'd this RS v3.4.5 
2. DL'd English(American)Level 1-5 (just search for your language packs their everywhere) 
3. Ran RS Setup, unchecked Launch RS. Closed the Program...
4. Goto crack folder and copy the RS in that folder (Don't launch that you'll get a 2122 or some error like that) Open Windows Explorer with RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR Goto C: > Program folder > Rosetta Stone folder > Rosetta Stone 3.4.5 folder and open that.  Paste
the Crack Rosetta Stone in that folder COPY AND REPLACE.  
5. Now Open DTLite and find the folder where your image files are at Click on Level 1 and Open, then highlight and mount it on that drive (most probably E:) Once you see that it's mounted, then minimize.
6.  Goto Start and create shortcut for RS (It's more convenient) 
(** Disable Your Internet connection **)
 Open RS,  once it's opened, choose to ** NEVER UPDATE and/or NEVER ACTIVATE ** then click add language level.  At this point it should recognize the DTLite vitual drive and add the first Level.  
7. After this is done, minimize RS, maximize DTLite unmount the first image and mount the image for Level 2, minimize DTLite and maximize RS and click on Add next language level.  Repeat this process for the rest of your language levels until your done.  After that it's just a matter of creating a user and picking your curriculum and of you go into learning a new language. (I did this for a friend who desperately needs this...I hope he achieves his American Dream) I hope this helps some of you out there who are experiencing the same problems I went through.  Thanks again VasiaZozulia for sharing this with poor people like us.  CHEERS!"
,_Cate_,2010-09-09T13:25Z,"OK... the crack has a different name than the app so when you drop it in the folder, it just adds it and doesn't ask if you want to replace it because it's a file with a different name.  You just change the name of the file to match??"

,geez_o_one,2010-09-21T11:37Z,"ANYONE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE PROGRAM COMPLAINING UNABLE TO FIND LANGUAGE CD (can't find languages from either the virtual drive or real dvd drive).

SOLUTION AS FOLLOWS:

If the program can't find languages (which you've made sure are actually version 3 compatible), then

1) you need to uninstall the RS.

2) get a free program to clean up windows registry and delete adppdata local temp files, as these interfere with the program. Glary utilities works well, ccleaner probably too. You need to clean up to be able to make a clean install of RS, otherwise RS won't find any languages.

3) install RS following the instructions in this torrent. (after installing everything you may want to restart and disconnect removable storage devices, this may not be necessary but recommended as these may cause problems)

4) mount a version 3 compatible language ISO (with alcohol, daemon tools etc) or insert the dvd w/ language ISOs

5) launch RS and voilÃ , RS lets you install languages now. 

In short, if you've tried everything and can't figure out why languages can't be found, the likely culprit is in the registry and temp files."
,Choripan,2010-09-24T00:01Z,"Great torrent. Thanks very much VasiaZozulia!

To solve the microphone detection problem:

1) Right click on the Rosetta Stone icon in the Start menu
2) Click the ""Compatibility"" tab
3) Set it to run in compatibility mode with Windows Vista SP2 (mine was defaulted to run in XP compatibility mode, which seemed to be the problem)
4) Start the program again, if you are lucky all mics will now show up"

,etannoom,2011-02-28T09:10Z,"Thanks a million VasiaZozulia, works great.

For those who can't get it to work, you need to download and install Rosetta Stone and the crack just like in the readme (really simple). You also need to download MagicIso. After you've done that and have the .iso file of whatever language and level you're looking to learn. Then right click the iso and go under the MagicIso options where it'll say mount whatever you have, but chances are you don't have other components to do so and it'll ask if you'd like to download those, so you'll need to do that too. Once it's been downloaded and installed then you can mount it to a drive, install it in rosetta stone (as long as you did the crack correctly) and start learning your language. Really easy process overall, IMHO, and great torrent, thanks again."

To those who are having problems

1. Install the software. (as stated in the readme located in the 'crack' folder) You will want to install the core files (important things) to an easy-to-access location. A new folder on the desktop is a perfect example of this.

2. DO NOT RUN THE SOFTWARE AFTER INSTALLATION (as stated in the readme)

3. Go to the directory that you installed 'Rosetta Stone' to. (If you see nothing more that a shortcut, you have done something incorrectly)

4. Replace the cracked version of Rosetta Stone with the version received from the installation. (win7 users may have to be Admin)

,armchair.53,2011-06-08T05:41Z,"I ran into 2 problems that others might have so I wanted to share the problem and solution. I am using Vista 32 bit

(1) The application would not install saying there was a problem with the windows installation.  This was caused because the Windows Firewall service was not started as I use Zone Alarm for my firewall.  For some reason, the application needs windows firewall to be on.  So I turned it on and then application installed fine.  I then turned it back off with no problem.  That is, the application only needs windows firewall to install not to run.

(2) I was unable to load any languages as the application did not see the .iso files when mounted with virtual clone.  However, I installed an alternate virtual device, Daemon-lite-tools, which is free, and then it worked fine.

Finally, I always do a virus check and found everthing to be clean."
,Alec51895,2011-06-15T09:45Z,"Works fine once it actually starts working.
On windows 7 I end up with a ""error 2123"" message, which goes away after multiple restarts of my computer. Oh well, it'll do until I find a better version."
,xhizors,2011-06-16T14:24Z,"Works so far so good on Windows 7 64-bit.

If you've gotten ""Error 2125: database blah blah blah"" Uninstall it, and reinstall it with YOUR INTERNET OFF. You can reconnect to your internet AFTER it asks you, and you tell it NOT to check for updates and NEVER REGISTER. And then you're done."

Great, fast download. 

However I'm getting 2 errors, first is the 2123 error, which when I restarted my laptop seemed to be fixed. 
Then after installing a language it came up with the update now question. Didn't get the option to never update, only update now or remind me later option. How do I fix this?
Also got asked to register, clicked never register. 
After restarting my laptop again I got the 2125 error saying 'Database is out of date, and could not be updated' how can I fix this as well?
Do I have to be offline when I want to go on Rosetta Stone?

But overall a great, fast download."
,Kututo,2011-06-18T11:43Z,"Hi,

I fixed the error I was given when the program started by running the program in compatibility mode. It can be turned on by the following: 

1. Right click the .exe
2. Go to the ""Compatibility"" tab.
3. Near the top click the box beside ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:""
4. Select the version of Windows below ( I used XP I think but you can try it or Vista)
5. Click apply.

I was struggling with mounting the languages too...I have Windows 7 64 bit and installed and ran the Application in Compatibility Mode for XP and Administrator.

What you have to do is:
Unmount the ISO if its mounted..

1.Go to your Documents

2.Create a folder and name it LANGUAGES

3.Create a folder in LANGUAGES with the name of the language you're using. (For me, it's JAPANESE)

4.Then, copy the disc image/images (the .ISO file) to JAPANESE (or whatever language you're using.

5.After that, have your ISO Mounter (again I use DAEMONToolsLite) mount it from that location.

[For me, the path looks like this:

C:\Users\Lauren\My Documents\LANGUAGES\JAPANESE\Rosetta Stone V3 - JapaneseL1.iso

6.Try running Rosetta Stone again and see if it recognizes it.

This is for all Newbies.

Open the folder in which this torrent is saved
for e.g.
C:\Users\XXXXX\Documents\Downloads\Rosetta Stone 3.4.5
where xxxxx is the name of the user logged in to your windows operating system.

1. There is a folder named crack here and an application ie .exe file there
named Rosetta Stone v3.4.5 (Size around 120 MB)

2. At the end of installation remember to remove tick mark from ""Launch this application"" in the bottom 

left corner

3. Run this application It will install the software in by default the following folder
C:\Program Files\Rosetta Stone\Rosetta Stone Version 3

4. Open the folder where the torrent is placed ie
C:\Users\XXXXX\Documents\Downloads\Rosetta Stone 3.4.5\crack\win

5. Copy the file RosettaStoneVersion3.exe (around 8 mb) from this folder. DO NOT RUN THE FILE PRESENT 

IN CRACK FOLDER

6. Open this folder
C:\Program Files\Rosetta Stone\Rosetta Stone Version 3\

7. Paste the above application from crack in this folder.

8. A prompt will appear asking you if you want to replace the existing file with this file. Click yes.

9. Now your software is ready. Access it from Start menu or the folder in which it is installed or from 

desktop. 

10. You will need Language packs which are not included in this torrent. you can search other torrents 

for these language packs.

11. These language packs come as images of CD Roms (.iso). you need a software to read these images.

12. I used Deamon Lite tool which is free."

â€¢ Go to your applications folder (it's the default folder on most Macs), right click Rosetta Stone App and click ""Show package contents"", go to Resources and REPLACE the ""mdm.dat"" file with the crack one. 
That's it. 

â€¢ Run RS and add any language. (which you can find on pirates bay)

,plumppork,2012-03-13T23:54Z,Does anyone have an Activation Code patch for Rosetta Stone version 3.4.5? This crack works great  but any new language isos I add don't work with my old Activation Code crack and I can't fully access them until I get activation codes for them. Can anyone help??
,DaSqurlyOne,2012-03-14T03:55Z,I had troubles until I restarted the computer after pasting the crack. If it worked for me it might work for u.
,plumppork,2012-03-14T22:25Z,"Thanks for the suggestion, but it didn't work. When I go to activate with all X's it says that I've already used that code to activate other languages and that I need to enter a new code.

Is anyone else having this issue? Is there a patch for this, or is the activation code patch from the earlier version supposed to carry over to this version?"
,DaSqurlyOne,2012-03-17T17:02Z,"Here is a step by step guide to loading Rosetta stone on your computer.

1; Open the folder Rosetta Stone 3.4.5
2; Double click Rosetta Stone v3.4.5.exe
3; Remeber the folder in which Rosetta Stone installed in (will be C:Program FilesRosetta StoneRosetta Stone Version 3 or C:Program Files (x86)Rosetta StoneRosetta Stone Version 3)
4; EXTREMELY!! IMPORTANT!!! Uncheck the box that says ""Launch after Install"" BEFORE you click Finish
5; After Rosetta Stone 3.4.5 has finished installing and BEFORE it launches open the crack folder
6; Open one of the folders named mac or win (if using windows open the win folder and if using mac open the mac folder)
7; Copy the file in the mac or win folder
8; Go to the directory where Rosetta Stone installed to (the place which we remember from step 3)
9; Paste the copied file into folder. Yes you want to replace existing file
10; Close all Windows
11; Restart Computer

This will only give u the program to run the language lessons. U need to get the .iso for the language lessons separately, which can be found here on tpb. Mount image for language lesson then run Rosetta Stone. This is how I got it to work for me. I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit."
,DaSqurlyOne,2012-03-17T17:06Z,"PS 
Great work VasiaZozulia!!
The makers of Rosetta Stone also did a wonderful job. 
This is a program that if I had the money I would pay for."
,Jhard1,2012-03-19T23:46Z,I downloaded the torrent and copy/pasted the crack. Restarted my computer and ran the program but I have no languages. The program asks me for the languages. How can I add the languages ?
,Jhard1,2012-03-20T01:59Z,Works awesome ! Thank you very much. Installed Spanish (Latin America) levels 1-5. Already completed lesson 1 :) 
,Gnosis2012,2012-03-20T06:11Z,What language is this?
,milt654654,2012-03-22T06:53Z,"I want to take the time and thank ""VasiaZozulia"", aplication WORKS, it WORKS!!!!, got the ISO Files for the languages, im glad i followed the instructions because if you forget to ""uncheck"" the ""run application after installation"" , you are fucked,  at least that was my case because i know very little about computers and to go into the registry and fix that?, oh hell no that thing is in chinese for me , im not going there"
,kares.m,2012-03-22T16:44Z,"Please help, i got this torrent and I cant understand how to use it for German language.
it will be kind if anyone can help."
,bowlinwes300,2012-03-23T02:45Z,hey guys I've looked throughout most of the comments and couldn't find much on my issue. I don't know where the file is that I need to mount. I've been looking for a while now and I just can't figure it out. I am missing a language file. any help would be appreciated.
,terribleperson,2012-03-25T06:40Z,Just a quick note: If you are using daemon tools and your language CD is not being recognized you need to add a IDE drive under Actions > Add Virtual IDE Drive and mount the CD on that drive. A restart will be required as well.
,EoinOwnage,2012-03-31T13:37Z,"When I try to install I get this message...

Did i not do something right, or are all you guys just using the 1st lesson and that's it.

Where can I get product keys or is that possible? Should I delete and look for one that won't need a key?

I'd appreciate it if someone gave me some info  "

,bungunners,2012-04-24T23:58Z,"Works great...Thank you.  I followed the instructions to a ""T"" and after install, I went to firewall settings in control panel and unchecked this program for allowing access to the net.  For people having the grey screen issue, it could be that your video card cannot handle the graphics and pictures that appear in front of that grey screen.  Either way I know it works and I am passing along that info.

,wheeledslayer,2012-05-17T23:15Z,"Can you upload Chinese (Mandarin) Levels 4 & 5?? If you could, that would be great!! By the way, awesome RS torrents"
,willytakum,2012-05-18T01:06Z,This works perfectly 100%...If it doesn't work you did NOT follow the instructions...Make sure when you replace the old files with the cracked file a pop-up window will appear asking if you want to replace the files...CHOOSE to REPLACE the OLD FILES...IF THAT WINDOW DOES NOT APPEAR YOU DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT...This torrent is completely virus free and works great...That is All...
,willytakum,2012-05-18T01:13Z,EVERYONE !!!!! If the program ask's for product keys YOU DID NOT REPLACE THE FILES go into the C:Program filesRosetta Stone>open the folder...find the rosetta stone icon and replace that file with the cracked file. a window will appear asking if you want to replace the files...CHOOSE TO REPLACE THE FILES> close the window and do a restart...IT WILL WORK
,jipper,2012-06-04T23:17Z,YES TY SO MUCH FINALLY ONE THAT WORKED!!! Im sorry for caps its just im so happy i can finally learn the only language i really wanted too.
,siphoner,2012-06-08T01:25Z,"Wondering if anyone can help me out with my problem.
Problem: I downloaded a different torrent, along with language packs for the rosetta stone. Everything works fine. I only get a limited amount of lessons unless I activate it, however. Will downloading this torrent fix that problem, or is the problem in the language packs themselves?"
,jin007,2012-06-09T23:13Z,"Works Fine. Only the first time I tried to BLOCK from Internet I did it with antivirus software and it did not work. Thrashed the program and I had to R&R it. So I did not know how to BLOCK it in win 7?

I went into my Firewall settings and Unchecked where it allows programs to connect to the internet but to the right there are two more boxes and I can NOT Uncheck both of them. 

I have a lot of progress I do not want to loose so I am afraid to try to use the program while I am online so I figured Id ask about Win 7 Spacific and these two other Checked Boxes called , ""Home/Work(Privete & Public""


I have one more Question. In moving from one computer to another is there any way to move and save your progress? Say your in the middle of a level and have to use it on another computer, is there a folder we can replace that stores our PROGRESS?""

Thank you man !!! "
,jin007,2012-06-09T23:20Z,"P.S. Id also like to know how many languages RS V3 Has??? I was only able to find One Chinese not both. 

And what is the dif between V3 and V4 Aside from the Obvious did they improve anything dramatic?"
,prophetessjanet30,2012-06-16T23:43Z,"For all those who received the message ""Application error"" ""5118""

this one works great i had trouble in the beginning like im sure plenty of you had so im gone give you a good step by step help
 1.download the torrent
 2.install exe file (next important)
 3.ok here where it got tricky for me
 4.as soon as you start the installation look for when it says extracting files with the blue status bar going across the screen.
 5.the blue bar will go across the screen 2 times ok.
 6.as soon as the first round of blue bar starts press ctrl+alt+delete and choose start task manager as fast as you can you got to be fast with this.
 7.choose the rosseta stone installation process in the applications tab to highlight it and just be ready to click end task but dont.
 8.next this is what your looking for. on the secound round of the blue status bar going across the screen right before the status bar gets right to the end or a blank dos screen keeps popping up then click end task in the task manager.
 9. the reason for this step is because if you click cancel it will rollback and erase all the files and folders that was installed.
 10. next is the same as usual dont start program go to your progam folder on c: drive in rosetta folder replace the application file with the app file in the crack folder
 11. now this is the only rosetta i can find that will load mounted iso files after these steps i tries all the rest and got rosetta to work but would not find the mounted image file
 12.start deamon tools lite mount iso
 13. start rosetta add language 

I did up to instruction 10 and now it is working. I didnt even have to restart. If you need any help just sent me a message"
