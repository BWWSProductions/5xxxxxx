I have no audio whatsoever, also. "

,pegbundy,2009-12-17T02:28Z,There are a couple of comments on the audio. Can someone elaborate before I download?
,oosit,2009-12-17T07:51Z,"The WBZ release is the unrated version (ending with katie die, shot by the police,) but the JUMANJI release is the theatrical ending version (katie sniffing at Micah's lifeless body, then smiles at the camera before lunging toward it and the screen smash cuts to black and the credits roll). check imdb."

,inspiron2004,2010-01-13T08:33Z,"Worst movie ever.  It's like the blair witch project except more boring.  Because of lack of scenery, and less interaction in between people.  I wanted to commit Hari Kari to put myself out of the mental anguish this inflicted upon me. "
,nautica002,2010-02-02T17:48Z,"oosit lol

,clipandgo,2010-02-13T23:36Z,"Thanks ooist. 
Everyone telling that guy to fuck off should shut the fuck up."
,PerOwnage,2010-02-21T23:36Z,The movie begins being scary as the last scene approaches. I got some chills on the last scene.
,PerOwnage,2010-02-22T12:48Z,"Jesus Christ I couldn't sleep afer i saw this. I downloaded 5 parts of saw and had no problems with sleep, but i saw this just before going to sleep.
Now i know i might be categorised like a soft core, but as the intro picture said, it really made me having night mares. Heads up! ='(
Made me cry also. I deeply regret watching this movie."

,AtotehZ,2010-05-10T00:10Z,"If someone could write a post about the spoiling kid it would be neat. Fortunately I stopped reading before I got too much of it. Reason I'm not doing it myself is.. I don't remember my password, (auto-login)"
,AtotehZ,2010-05-10T00:11Z,... post in the forums...
,ThePalindorme,2010-05-12T13:53Z,"now, i know the hype surrounding this film, and so i thought all people who said this film is boring were morons. But no, those who say this is scary are morons.

By the time the most scariest part comes, i.e, the ending, you are so bored that you hardly get scared because you desperately want the film to end.

I am not strictly against this new handheld cam genre, i loved cloverfield. But this is the first time i miss blood in a horror film."
