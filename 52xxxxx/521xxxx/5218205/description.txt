These are three double CD's released in Sweden, by EMI, in 1996 (1962-1969) and 1998 (1970-1978 and 1979-1987) Don't know if they were released in any other countries.
So welcome to stroll down music memory lane. Some of the songs could be described as one hit wonders and others are with artists who have been on the top for decades.

Enjoy! Please seed and don't hesitate to comment. Always nice to know what you think.
