Season 1, Episode 4
The Truth Hurts / Jumping Mad

The Truth Hurts: Riley is excited about her 
new job as a reporter on the school newspaper 
and can't wait to get started. Her excitement 
soon turns to frustration though leading 
her to call Fleemco when the head of 
the newspaper will not let her write 
hard-hitting stories like she wants to. 
But when Riley's stories start to embarrass 
her friends and family, she decides that 
she would rather be a good friend and sister 
than a reporter. 
Jumping Mad: Feeling that her dad's stunts 
are not safe enough because his stunt 
coordinator doesn't take as many precautions 
as he should, Riley replaces the old stunt 
coordinator known as Uncle Phil with 
a physics professor. But what seemed like 
a good idea to keep Dick safe soon starts 
hurting his stunts because they are too safe. 
Can Riley convince Uncle Phil to come back 
to work for her dad and fix the problem 
that she has created?
