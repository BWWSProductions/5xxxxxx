Taking a cue from peers such as Def Leppard and Shaw Blades (Tommy Shaw of Styx and Jack Blades of Night Ranger), Tesla issued a covers album, REAL TO REEL, in 2007. The California hard-rock act's first outing since its '04 studio reunion record, INTO THE NOW finds raspy-voiced frontman Jeff Keith leading the band through a well-selected set of classic-rock gems that includes a faithful rendition of Led Zeppelin's "Thank You" and a stomping take on the James Gang's "Walk Away."
