is nothing there! please tell us how to install the content packs!"

No idea about the modification dates, it shows 2009 at my end."
,majware,2009-12-14T00:17Z,"ok, i will try that, tanks!

about the modification date files, is my fault! i find out that a crack for Daemon Tools change my windows clock/date to 2005 lol"
,majware,2009-12-14T01:01Z,"It Work, tanks!

but please tell me that the original version of this software dont require this work around, becouse its a shame for Magix.

Tanks again
-------------------------------------------------------
for people how dont kow is the steps: first you need to make sure the easy mode is off, then clik on soundpools and add styles... and then you navigate to the ""Basics_16"" folder in the installation folder like trialanderror said."
[T],trialanderror,2009-12-14T06:46Z,"Yes, indeed. As a very first step, turn the easy mode off. It's the big button in the upper left corner.

Not sure if the soundpools not being recognized is a problem with the crack or Magix itself, but at least there's a relatively simple workaround. The software is worth it."

Here's another hint in case the info file is not elaborate enough:

After having replaced the original MusicMaker.exe with the supplied one, the activation window will still appear one more time. Choose ""I would like to continue testing..."", then click ""Continue test phase"". This will complete the crack and the nag screen should never appear again.

You can then proceed to installing the content packs after having closed the program.

Good luck."

First of all: thanks to the uploader.
Installation went well and I can launch the program and it works, but when I try to install the other content packs, in the download folder, my computer says "" No supported software for MAGIX Content Pack 1 found""
Anyone know how to solve this problem?

Thx"
,VastGsm,2010-02-04T23:35Z,"I have the same problem as all of you. The serial provided WORKS but you need to input e-mail address and when you type in ANY email address it does NOT work.

I have created an account and activated the software as a TRIAL. then inside the programme I was able to download the content pack but it would ONLY give me the TRIAL content pack ""trial_content_pack01_int"" from Download URL location ""http://download.magix.net/content/2009/mm16premium/int/trial_content_pack01_int.exe?dwl=1""
I removed this from the URL and uised this download link INSTEAD ""http://download.magix.net/content/2009/mm16premium/int/content_pack01_int.exe?dwl=1"" THEN just simply replace the 01 to 02 to 03 to 04 and you can download ALL the packs. Then I USED the RED RLS of Magic Premium 16 and ALL is working. I just thought I would give you the heads up as this is now working on Windows 7!! Cheers"

Running the content packs says:

""No supported software for MAGIX Content Pack 1 found""

Did anyone find a solution for this?

Installation of the program goes fine, but without being able to run the content packs its not a usefull program.

Thanks for the upload though.

The program without the contentpacks is not very usefull."
,FigonaPetter,2010-02-08T17:14Z,"Hey trialanderror I downloaded the soundpools from mmm15 that you have upped.

It loads perfectly and works fine.

Now I'm really curious about what's in the content packs in this torrent here.. that I can't extract. I thought it was these soundpools but I understand from reading the comments that those are not yet out for this version (16).

Anyway, this is much appreciated. I can finally trix with this program as I intended to.

Thank you so much for everything."
[T],trialanderror,2010-02-08T20:18Z,You can install the content packs only after applying the crack. Read the info file and the comments here for instructions.
,FigonaPetter,2010-02-09T01:33Z,"Yeah I didn't want a trial version, that's why I used the crack exe. The issue with No supported software for MAGIX Content Pack 1 found remains unsolved for a lot of people it seems, including me.

Gonna check if soundpools from version 12 will be accepted too. That's the version I've been working with. I do know what's in the content packs as I've read the info file, but I meant that I'm curious of what the sounds are like."
,harpersneil,2010-02-09T17:21Z,"This worked seemlessly for me, nice work trialanderror; huge kudos to you friend.
If I could make any criticism at all, it would be that there's no mention of the serial number in your instructions. The original Shortcut created on my desktop continues to open to version requiring the serial. Launching the application from the start menu solved this, but it wasn't obvious... at least not to me but maybe I'm just a dumbass!
Thank again"
,speakeasy06,2010-02-10T04:17Z,"First, thanks to trialanderror for this awesome UP!! Second, to those of you who keep getting errors and believe me (I had the same ones everyone else is having) LISTEN TO THE UPLOADER!!! Read the freakn info file! It tells you what to do! I got it to work and here's a thorough explanation for those who are frustrated. Here's what I did: Uninstall Music Maker 16 altogether if it's already installed>>Reboot>>Reinstalled MM 16>>It will automatically run the program just hit ctrl+alt+del, find the music maker process and end it>>Copy the crack to the install folder directory replacing the existing one>>Then I ran the MM program from START MENU location, closed the program>>Ran the MM program from the install directory then closed that>>Afterwards it allowed me to install the content packs>>You must install them in order so Content pack 1, then 2, then 3, etc. In order! Then when all of them are done installing, run the MM program from the install directory (cracked one) You can create a shortcut on desktop, start menu, whatever you want just make sure to run that one. After that's finished, you may only see 3 or 4 styles (soundpools) in Magix Music Maker. To fix this, there's a little icon in the upper left corner to turn EASY MODE OFF make sure that's off. You will then have to manually add the new styles from each of the content packs. To do this you go to File>Settings>Program Settings. Under SOUNDPOOL you'll see a button that says RESET SOUNDPOOL. Below that you'll see USE INSTALLED SOUNDPOOL EVEN AFTER RESET. You need to make sure THAT is unchecked. Then you click RESET SOUNDPOOL. Once you do this, all the styles will be cleared out of MM. Just click ADD STYLES down below and find the Basics_16 folder that will contain each sound style and you will have to manually add each one. Voila. Enjoy!"

,rogamosh,2010-08-01T00:49Z,"No Error At All If U Follow The Instructions....

1. Install MAGIX Music Maker 16 Premium.

3. Install The Crack In  Installation Folder By Right Clicking The Desktop Shortcut & Selecting Properties Then Open File Location.

4. Run The Program, Close The Dialog Box & Restart The Application.

5. Turn Off The ""Easy Mode"".

6. Finally, Goto File > Settings > Program Settings. Change The Tab ""General"" To ""Folders"" & In The ""Soundpool"" Field, Change It To ""C:\Program Files (x86)\MAGIX\MusicMaker16Premium_Download_Version\Basics_16""

(This Will Enable The Automatic Detection Of The Content Packs Which will Be Installed Later To Avoid The Manual Detection).

7. Install The Content Packs (If Any). (Read The MAGIX Music Maker Content Packs Installation Guide)


How To Recognize The Contents Of The ""Content Packs"" If Not Recognized Automatically After The Installation Of The Content Packs

1. Make Sure That The ""Easy Mode"" Is Off.

I too was having the problem of not being able to view or use the soundpools after I installed them. I found this post on the magic forums that explained how to fix that issue easily, I assure it will help those having trouble.


 1. open magix, on the top left side on screen, under the logo, MAGIX, there you can change to easy mode on/off change to easy mode off, that means, under the MAGIX Logo, press the left of two button.

 2. Now you will be able to see the, ADD STYLE BUTTON, down in the middle of the screen, press add styles, and then go to the folder there you placed your styles, dont go into so you can see all styles, go to the main folder and just press, ADD, then all styles will be loaded. Thats it.

There may be conflicts with your previous installation. Try a clean installation; after uninstall, delete all remaining files by hand, then reinstall."

,footin,2010-12-22T08:28Z,"hi.. thanks for MMM16.. i managed to get the main thing working and its running well..

Im pacing a major issue:
 INSTALLATION OF CONTENT PACKS has been UNSUCCESSFUL.. 
When I start installation of content packs, i get ""No supported software for Magix Content Pack (number) found , installation canceled ""... for every content pack

i've read that ALL the content packs shud be present before one can install them and they need to be installed in order 1,2,3 and so on...

im also aware of other stuff like easy mode off, program settings, soundpools reset, BASIC_16..

i tried following all instructions given in the included text file and within the comments but without any positive outcome... i reinstalled MMM16, made sure i got all the instructions right, but THE CONTENT PACK INSTALLATION DOESNT EVEN BEGIN! all i get is the msgbox saying-
| No supported software for Magix Content Pack (number) found , installation canceled |

IM CLUELESS ABOUT what to do next to GET THE CONTENT PACKS INSTALLED.."
,footin,2010-12-24T12:58Z,"I got soundpools from ur other torrent... but what about revolta , vita instruments and other cool stuff that comes with content packs? can i get that elsewhere? the content packs dont install!"
,fly1969,2010-12-25T02:36Z,"Installed as directed. Everything cool...but after 10 minutes or so...crashes...as in hangs...as in...stops working...or more to the point...continuously loops...unresponsive. See the point I'm making here?

I'm running Win 7 Home x64bit

I installed the contents packs...did everything as per instructions.

?"
,footin,2010-12-30T05:06Z,"@fly1969:
MMM16 requires lot of main memory and CPU so close other applications while using it...
Upgrading your RAM may also help...
I run it on XP, 2GB RAM, ATOM 1.6GHz processor and it runs fine..
btw, how cud u install those content packs? do u think any special software/ plug-in/ whatever is reqd for that? coz i got this msg-- 
|No supported software for Magix Content Pack (number) found , installation canceled|"

,rogamosh,2011-01-16T22:08Z,"No Error At All If U Follow The Instructions....

4. Run The Program, Close The Dialog Box & Restart The Application.

How To Recognize The Contents Of The ""Content Packs"" If Not Recognized Automatically After The Installation Of The Content Packs
