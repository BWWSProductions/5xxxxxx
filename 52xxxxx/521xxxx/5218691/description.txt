Discussion show with Brian Kenny and Bert Sugar looking
at Muhammad Ali's first-ever televised fights, including
a featured bout against Doug Jones.
 
Release notes: They used a quite unusual method when they
spliced up this show into episodes, they just end it
without any end-cretis or anything, you think it's time
for another commercial break but nope. Just thought I'd
mention it in case you wonder.
