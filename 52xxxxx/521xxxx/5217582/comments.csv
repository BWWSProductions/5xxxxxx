,TommyBlade2018,2009-12-14T20:28Z,Yeh No Doubt
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-15T02:56Z,"One more thing Tommy,did Predator 1 work on your WD HDTV Media Player?I'm asking because I used other settings and changed them a bit after that for the other movies so they would be compatible for WD HDTV Media Player and consoles.Let me know alright?Peace!"
,TommyBlade2018,2009-12-15T14:30Z,Yeh Predator 1 Worked Perfectly....As For Predator 2 I See A Diffrence in Resolution.....The 2 Is A Little More sharper and crisper than the 1 Didn't Know If You changed it while doing both. But Respecfully Predator 1 Worked Great.
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-15T14:49Z,Thanks for the info Tommy.So Predator 2 looks a bit better you say?
,TommyBlade2018,2009-12-15T15:30Z,Yeh A Bit Better Than The One Definitely
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-15T17:11Z,"Alright,good to know these things so I can figure out which settings to use from now on.Be free to keep me posted with other releases if you test them :)"
,TommyBlade2018,2009-12-15T18:08Z,"Yeh Definitely. NP
Keep Bringing the Heat
Peace
*Appreciate All The Work"
,TommyBlade2018,2009-12-15T19:36Z,"Can't Agree More GopoFan But The Reason why Is Simply Because Instead Of Ps3, XBox Or KMplayer There's also other console out there and he's not sure if its good. So Ask someone who has the console and they'll reply lettin you know If it good thats all, which in my case is a WD.....Cause I know Gopo Brings The top notch to the table."
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-16T16:28Z,I understand.
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-16T17:59Z,"Well the subtitle in romanian works fine,my native language and I did realize that the one in english is out of sync but I didn't find any other one that works.Thanks for the link."
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-16T21:13Z,"A lot of romanian rippers on the internet.I'm quite surprised.SM,me and I think 3Li is romanian too. The romanian invasion!:))"
