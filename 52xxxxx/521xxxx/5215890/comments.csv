,cclloyd,2009-12-15T22:11Z,It does work as long as your proccessor is compatible.  MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE RIGHT DIRVERS THOUGH ON THE CUSTOMIZE SCREEN BEFORE THE INSTALL SCREEN OTHERWISE YOU WILL BREAK BOTH INSTALLATIONS

,cclloyd,2009-12-19T03:33Z,"no because im using windows 7.

Did you erase it using disk utulity during setup to Mac OS X (Journaled).  And did you make sure to customize it before the actuall install starts?  If so try reinstalling it, then when you reboot, try giving it like 10 min.  It took a bit for it to load for me."

,cclloyd,2009-12-20T16:35Z,"@dini931 - 

Download CPU-Z and check if your proccessor has the instruction set SSSE3, SSE3, SSE2.  If it has either of those than it will work.  SSSE3 is the best.


You can only run it from a VM if you are running the VM from it.   

And if you dont want to lose your windows, then dual boot.  Create a 10GB min, partition and install it to that.  Thats what i did.  

Note: do dual boot you will need to also download EasyBCD on your windows."

i really want to install mac on my pc and i have been looking trough ALOT of guides recently..

but i still have some questions :

i got two harddrives, one with Windows 7 64-bit installed on it, and on the other one i want to install Mac OS X Snow Leopard using this torrent

but windows 7 is the system that i use the most, so im wondering wich software i need to dualboot (meaning that i can choose if i wanna boot  snow leopard or windows7)  

and does it affect the preformance of the computer if i have two different systems on different drives? 

i just want a smooth solution that allows me to choose wich system i want to run when i boot my pc (mac osx for work and win7 for games and entertainment)

i hope someone can answear my questions :D

,cclloyd,2009-12-22T21:42Z,"@reakwon-

Just install to the hard drive, then once its completely up and working, you will need a Windows 7 x64 install disk, just boot into it, then choose repair my computer.  Choose repair boot, then open a command prompt.  type

Diskpart
list disk
select disk X (number goes where X is)
list part
select part X (the partition your windows is)
active

That will make it boot into windows when you restart.  

Now download EasyBCD (google is your friend) and just add a boot order for Generic x86 PC under the mac option.  Then when you boot up, it will let you choose which one to boot to (and lets you choose the default)"

* Install Vista on the First Partition of your Hard Disk. I am not going to elaborate into How to install Windows, I hope everyone knows it. If you already have it installed then read on..
    * Right click on My Computer and Click on Manage. Select Disk Management. Now Create a new Volume for OSX by shrinking an existing volume. You need atleast 5GB of space and the new volume should show up as Unallocated.
    * Make sure that the partition shows up as Unallocated, else repeat the previous step.
    * Now restart the machine and boot into the Leopard DVD that you burned using the iATKOS v1.0 DVD Image.
    * Press F8 as the countdown begins and type -v at the prompt and hit enter.
    * You should see scrolling text on the screen now. If it stops anywhere then drop a comment and I?ll try to help you out.
    * After a while you should be looking at the Leopard Installer. Follow the instructions on Screen.
    * Once the Loading Bar vanishes Select Utilities -> Disk Utility .
    * Select the Volume you created previously and format it as MAC OSX Journaled Extended. Once the formatting is done the volume is ready for installation.
    * Now Close Disk Utility and Select Utilities -> Darwin Boot. Type Y at the prompt.
    * At the prompt when it asks for the Disk Number enter 0. For the Partition Number if your Leopard Partition is 2nd on the disk, then enter 2 and so on.
    * Accept the following prompts and you should see a success prompt saying that so many block of data were written successfully.
    * Now get back to the Leopard Install Screen. Choose the partition that you made in the beginning and follow the instructions on screen.

      Please don?t select any patches etc during the installation, this is normally the reason for most failed installations. Just the plain install would do.
    * Once the Install is done, reboot with the DVD in the drive. Press F8 at Darwin Boot Loader and type -s and press enter.
    * Execute the following commands :

      fdisk -e /dev/rdisk0
      flag 1
      quit
      reboot
    * Now before the PC restarts remove the DVD. At this point you should be able to boot into Vista normally.

      Note: If you are unable to log into windows, because there is an error which says ?winload.exe? correupted.! Relax. Just insert the Windows VISTA boot DVD into the drive and restart. Click on ?Repair computer? 
      once you are inside the DVD and it will automatically detect if a problem exists and suggest ?Repair and Restart?. Press the same, and remove the DVD once the PC is about to restart. You should now be able to 
      log in to vista without any problem.
    * Now that we have almost everything running fine, lets proceed with the dual boot setup.
    * Boot into Vista. Copy the chain0 file from the Leopard DVD to C:
    * Open the ?Command prompt? with ?Elevated Admin? privileges from the Start Menu.
    * Type the following into the prompt

      bcdedit /copy {current} /d ?Mac OS X?
      bcdedit /enum active
      bcdedit /set {GUID} PATH \chain0

      In the first command type {current} as it is, literally..nothing else..just {current} with the brackets. In the 3rd command however, replace the {GUID} with the alphanumeric GUID you see in the enumerated 
      list under MAC OS X. You can see this list on your terminal as soon as you type the 2nd command above.
    * Close the Command Prompt and Restart Vista.
    * You Should now be looking at a screen with two options to boot into Mac OSX or Vista.
    * Select Mac OSX to see if you can boot into it. You should see the familiar Darwin boot Loading screen with the timer going down. If you dont do anything, then it counts to zero and again shows the menu screen 
      with Vista and MAC OSX options. Dont panic!

      Again select MAC OS X, and now as the timer counts down, Press F8. You would see a list of partitions on your disk with their names. Select thepartition with MAC OSX installed by using up/down arrows and press ENTER.

,rad2905,2009-12-31T15:21Z,"People,
This OS (and probably all of the mac OS that you can find online) is patched only by means of apple hardware ID (this OS has no serial) so that you can install it at all.
Otherwise, it's pure UNIX system - meaning, setting and installing it is not as easy as 123. 
Furthermore, snow leopard is pure x64 bit system. It doesn't support EIDE devices, even SATA devices has to be set to AHCI. You must know what chipset you have (ICH9, ICH10 etc) as well as the audio chipset (Azalia, Intel) and other, if any (LAN, wireless etc)
If ANY of this stuff I've written makes no sense to you, forget about downloading this.
Regards..."

,tanner1294,2010-01-04T00:58Z,"Ok so I need help. I have tried every option (including the advanced) and the computer will go to the gray screen with the Apple logo and the spinning thing, and then it tells me to restart. That's all it ever does, it never goes any farther. So I used -v and it says a lot of things, and it stops after it says my computer model. Can anyone please help? I would love to have this on my computer.

I have a Sony VAIO vgn-nr120e Notebook. Currently I have it dual-booting Windows Vista and Linux Mint 7. If need be, I will gladly get rid of Linux for Mac.
(p.s. I tried this on my HP desktop and it kept restarting over and over on it's own)"

You don't have to burn to dvd. You could boot from usb. With a help of an usb image tool. Eftersom du har windows 7 så har du säkert stöd i ditt BIOS.

Translating for everybody. It depends on your BIOS wether you could install from usb or not!
