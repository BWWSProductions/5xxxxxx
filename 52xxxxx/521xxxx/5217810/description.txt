Another celebration re-up.

I hope you will all enjoy this little danish gem of a comic, made by Peter Madsen (the maker of the Valhalla comic), and based on a story by Hans Christian Andersen.

This comic was drawn/painted in water colour and gouache, making the look quite different from most comics out there, and I hope you will enjoy this unconventional artstyle.


Although this is a danish comic, it IS in english, released in english for a Hans Christian Andersen celebration week, so most people in here should be able to read it :)
