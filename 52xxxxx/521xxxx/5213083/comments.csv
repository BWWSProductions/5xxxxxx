,inickg,2010-01-09T06:54Z,did not work for me
,lgarcia87,2010-01-10T22:13Z,@ inickg ... what was the problem just follow the instructions IT WORKS.
,sydonis2,2010-01-27T21:05Z,"I don't know about you guys, but those instructions were incoherent.  Here is what I gathered:

Unzip iRip
- easy enough
Drag application into application folder
- uhh..  what?  once its unzipped, there is no application.  What do I do to install this once its unzipped?  There is no setup program, nor is there an application.
Enter serial number
- Can't do that til I find the application or setup."
,lgarcia87,2010-02-04T23:03Z,"@ sydonis2 Ok first this program is for MAC OS X (just to be clear your not trying to install this on Windows) now you got a file named iRip.zip unzip that file using Archive Utility or Stuff it xpander or whatever, after you unzip it you should see a mac application called iRip drag it to Application folder, after that open up that app and enter serial number. piece of cake"

,Taurus2205,2011-10-02T08:51Z,"Hey, do you think this works for the 2.0 version of iRip?? I have a mac. Here is my process, let me know where I am going wrong...so I download ur link, compress the download-it become a ZIP archive. Then w/o doing anything, I drag the (file name).zip to the applications folder (it looks like a blank document w/ a zipper down the middle. I right-click and open it with Archive utility, but that jus gives me a file that looks like a blank document.  that won't open...can you help me out??"
,Taurus2205,2011-10-03T01:10Z,Nevermind!!
,bilmur,2012-02-07T02:20Z,"-TIPS- 

Click on the iRip menu on the menu bar and choose 'registration'.

DO NOT use the little black window open on the right hand side of your screen to register! This won't work."
