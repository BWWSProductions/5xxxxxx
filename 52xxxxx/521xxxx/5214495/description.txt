And here is a re-up of one of my REALLY old torrents. It is the full Asterix colletion (apart from the latest release, "Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book", which have not been scanned yet) + all the scanned extras i have been able to find. It is of course in CBR format, not pesky PDF files :)


Please read the readme file for info on the file name/issue name structure, if the comics dont seem to come in the order you are used to :). This is the chronological order, its just that most countries released them out of order. 
If you see other torrents who have 36 Asterix books, it is because they dont follow the "real" chronology, and have added a few books in the series which are not a real part of the series. The last books are extras, and are in the extras folder of this torrent, along with other goodies :)

So enjoy Asterix.
