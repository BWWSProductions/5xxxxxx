[T],Quazza,2009-12-15T00:46Z,"You disappoint me Trickdaddy...

You actually believe the statements taken out-of-context by progressive media sources were racist. You should do a bit more research into his comments...in fact...you should listen to him say them in context.

I guess it is easy to overlook the ""Black unemployment is terrible"" statement that comes right before the ""The black frame of mind is terrible"".

If he was racist, why would he say that black unemployment is terrible? Would he not have said it's good that they are no longer working?

Oh, and you being racist isn't an irrelevant point. According to how you described it, we are all racist in one way or another. I was just curious to whom you are racist against.

I'm not as cynical as you it seems, so please...tell me.

Where exactly do you get ""every race is racist towards another in one way or another.""?

Help me to understand the way you think."

,trickdaddy0024,2009-12-15T03:00Z,"You actually believe the statements taken out-of-context by progressive media sources were racist. --Qussy  This was a Dumb comment by Limbaugh...But dont ask me Roger Goodell said the same thing...I should listen to Limbaugh? I have his podcasts (Thanks Jho)...Limbaugh doesnt convince me on alot of things...Its not for not trying but Limbaugh forces his opinions on people...And the zombies in their 80's just eat it up...Dick Wolf says Limbaugh is a cancer and if hard to argue that..Help me to understand the way you think.  --Qussy Let's look at the comments..In late September 2003, McNabb was the subject of very controversial comments made by Rush Limbaugh, who worked as a commentator for ESPN at the time, stating that the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback was overrated and that, ""I think what we?ve had here is a little social concern in the NFL. The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well""--http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_McNabb   In Dumbo Limbaugh's mind only ""white"" quarterbacks like Brett Favre can do good  because they have ""superior intelligence""...Limbaugh's opinion comes from stereotypes that white men are smarter ex. Creating a cure for cancer...On the other hand black men are athletic ex. Better in physical sport...Bottom line is when you criticize other races based on stereotypes you end up making dumb Racist comment like Rush did...END"

,gibillnumber12579,2009-12-15T17:01Z,"Quazza, that scumbag has heard it in context.  The piece of shit hosts Rush's podcast on a different site.  He just chooses to twist what he heard with his own two ears."
