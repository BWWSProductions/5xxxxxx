[T],gilgamesh07,2009-12-19T23:15Z,"I don't scan them, I just pass along the ones that have been scanned. If you had any idea what the scanners go through to make that happen for us, you would not reasonably find any reason to complain, even if the book you are looking for doesn't happen to get scanned the exact moment you think it should. These people work very hard at their own expense, with no compensation, to share these books with us. A little patience and respect is a small price to pay for what they do."
