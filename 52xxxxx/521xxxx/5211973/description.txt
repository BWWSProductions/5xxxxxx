Ricky Valance (born 10 April 1939) is a Welsh singer. He is best known for the number one single, "Tell Laura I Love Her", which sold over a million copies in 1960.
Ray Peterson's original version of "Tell Laura I Love Her" was considered for release in the United Kingdom. Thousands of copies were pressed but someone at Decca Records decided that the song was in "bad taste", and the records were ordered destroyed. EMI subsequently arranged for Valence to cover the song, which was co-written by Jeff Barry.Valance thus became the first Welshman to reach the top spot - Shirley Bassey being the first Welsh person.
