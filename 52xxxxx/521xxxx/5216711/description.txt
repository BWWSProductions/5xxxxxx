The Spencer Davis Group - Keep On Running (Live-Beat Club)


"Keep On Running" is a single by The Spencer Davis Group released in 1965. It became a number-one hit on the UK charts.

It was written by Jackie Edwards (Wilfred Gerald Edwards, 1938â€“1992).

The song was included in the 1988 film Buster and was used during the film's opening sequence that saw "Buster Edwards" (Phil Collins) steal a suit from a shop window for a friend's funeral. The song was not included on the CD release of the soundtrack due to legal technicalities; it did, however, appear on the cassette and vinyl formats.

It was also playing on the radio on the soap opera Coronation Street when character Val Barlow was killed by electrocution in 1971.

The song was also included in the 2007 romantic comedy Run Fatboy Run directed by David Schwimmer.

In 2009 the song was in Susan Nickson's "Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps" as the title to the eighth episode of series 8 and the soundtrack when Gaz tries to find the woman he wants (Donna).

The Spencer Davis Group was a mid-1960s British beat group from Birmingham, England. In its heyday the group consisted of Spencer Davis, Steve Winwood, Muff Winwood and Pete York; Jimmy Miller was their producer. The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums states "This big selling Birmingham band scored two number ones in the UK Singles Chart penned by the reggae artist, Jackie Edwards. Teenager Winwood left in 1967, to form Traffic before joining Blind Faith, then forging a career as a soloist".

Although short-lived, the Spencer Davis Group - particularly its incarnation with Steve Winwood - proved to be influential, with many of the band's songs covered by other artists over the years. Notable among these are Chicago's 1969 version of "I'm a Man", same song that later became a Disco Music top ten chart hit (Billboard, october, 1978) performed by Jacques Fred PetrusÂ´s group Macho, The Allman Brothers Band's 1969 take of Davis' instrumental "Don't Want You No More," Three Dog Night's 1970 recording of "Can't Get Enough of It," and The Blues Brothers' 1980 recording of "Gimme Some Loving." The Grateful Dead also covered Spencer Davis Group material in live performance on occasion; in particular, Spencer Davis himself performed "I'm a Man" with the Dead at a 1989 performance at Los Angeles' Great Western Forum.

The band reformed in 2006, although only Davis and Hardin remained from the 1960s group line-ups.
