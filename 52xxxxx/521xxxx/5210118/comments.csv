,gmx,2009-12-12T13:26Z,"hormonat, if you are developing CSP dll, windows will not use it unless it's been digitally signed by Microsoft. Signing process takes sometimes 24 hours, sometimes more. Waiting for it in order to test developed dll is really waist of time. AdvApi32.dll contains crypt API functions. On XP it also checks for the signature, so it was necessary to crack that dll. On Windows 7 things are slightly different. CryptAcquireContext API will load CryptSP.dll which will check the signature. So, we have to crack that one now. Please note that this is for development purposes only on development machine in order to save time."
