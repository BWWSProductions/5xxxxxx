On Windows 7 we don't crack advapi32.dll any more. Now we crack cryptsp.dll.

This is cracked version of cryptsp.dll. Applied crack allows using custom CSP
dll not signed by Microsoft. Also, you will need to replace manifest associated
with cryptsp.dll. If you wish to manually change the original manifest instead
of, copying this one, change only SHA-256 hash in manifest.

The SHA-256 hash of the patched dll is in BASE64 encoding. To create manually
SHA-256:

openssl dgst -sha256 -binary "C:cryptsp.dll.cracked" | openssl enc -base64
-out "C:digest_b64_encoding.txt"

C:digest_b64_encoding.txt will now contain SHA-256 hash for manifest.

If you would like to patch cryptcsp.dll manually:
DLL version must be 6.1.7600.16385 (Tested on Windows 7 Ultimate x86)

At offset 0x3CF4 change 0F 85 -> 90 E9
