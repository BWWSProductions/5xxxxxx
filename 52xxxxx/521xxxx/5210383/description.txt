The adventures of Disney's adorable talking puppies continue as the Buddies make their way to the North Pole for a magical holiday adventure. D-Dawg, Buddha, Budderball, Rosebud, and Mudbud are back, and this time they're on a mission to save Christmas. As Santa Paws prepares to deliver fantastic presents to good little pups all over the world, his son Puppy Paws grows weary of the cold northern winds. Sneaking a peek at dad's naughty and nice list, Puppy Paws notices that Budderball is about to get passed over for a present this year, and ventures out to help him get back into Santa's good graces. But while Puppy Paws is away, the enchanted Christmas Icicle begins to melt. Should it manage to drip away into nothing, the true meaning of Christmas will be forgotten forever. With Christmas fast approaching, Puppy Paws, Budderball, and the gang all race to ensure that the holidays remain joyous for generations to come.
