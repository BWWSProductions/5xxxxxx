ill will upload the x86 version soon with real code use till microsoft black listed"
,BlakeM,2009-12-17T20:03Z,"When I try to install it it says something along the lines of it not being able to find the proper drivers.  It tells me that if I have a DVD or CD that has them to put it into the computer at this time.  What do I need to do, drivers for Windows 7 for my type of PC or is it something else?  im so confused."
,rickvtv6,2009-12-19T07:50Z,"well it looks like this is an UPGRADE ONLY version, not the FULL retail release. which would have been handy to know before d/ling it. especially when the best option when installing a new o/s is to do a format and start fresh, you might have your stuff after doing an upgrade, but any programs you HAD will usually render useless as the system has erased the old system registry and replaced it with a fresh one. stupid how it works really.

i have not bought a copy of windowz since 95, to me they are plain greedy with their prices, but now i think i will have to, to have a reliable full version.
and putting the key on the torrent page is really noob, you never do that, always put it into a readme file IN the d/l, now anyone can d/l any version of Win7 (not just yours) and use your key... hey anyone need a win7 key, go to this torrent page its listed there!"
,thetank77,2009-12-29T04:28Z,plz seeeeeed ppl only downloading at 2kb/s
,GabbyTemple,2010-01-07T08:25Z,"Is this the upgrade edition or the full edition? 
or does it not matter, the key is what matters? 

( i own a legit full key through MSDN, but dont have the disk) 
"
,willi235,2010-01-25T20:05Z,"idk why people dont think and read

i told you guys i installed at as an upgrade why i did was erase my hard drive and then install windows vista basic as a trail and then used this copy and install as an upgrade and is still working for me because after that i install my softwares  is easy and it work..

note: i dont know if the serial code works now because is a real one and it might already be black listed"
,Imtiaz383,2010-01-29T02:10Z,You fucking Son of a Bitch! You uploaded a torrent with a sick error.
,jamezz024,2010-02-07T21:25Z,hey im trying to run this in parallels and it says i need to install device drivers where can these be found plz help me
,InfoWarriorMaverick84,2010-03-05T00:08Z,"This download works, and I'm not sure what's the difference is from the MSDNAA .iso and this one but it did not solve the ""A required CD/DVD device driver is missing"" problem.

If you're having problems with the ""A required CD/DVD device driver is missing"" may to try installing off of a USB drive.

This download was unable to solve the ""A required CD/DVD device driver is missing"" problem for me.

,schroed4,2010-07-04T07:45Z,"THIS TORRENT IS THE UPGRADE ONLY VERSION.

If you try to fresh-install it, you will get unstoppable driver errors that make you unable to install it."
