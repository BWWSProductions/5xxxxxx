,CashewXD,2009-12-15T14:41Z,someone really REALLY needs to seed this.
,bansawbanchee,2009-12-16T02:31Z,I have been seeding for 2 days now. Over 3.5 GB uploaded. I will upload until I get the rest of the episodes then I will make a new set
,wraper,2009-12-26T22:46Z,"How do I disable the French subtitles, when they seem integrated into the actual Video?"
,wraper,2009-12-26T22:50Z,Downloading English subtitles and using them only causes you to have two sets of subtitles instead of the English overwriting the French ones.
,Ycilop,2009-12-28T23:32Z,"Thanks!.. But why would you rar the entire thing like that? Makes it look suspicious, somehow."
,bansawbanchee,2009-12-30T07:37Z,"This is my first torrent. Didn't really know how to do it. Also it takes up less space on my comp Rar.
"
,bansawbanchee,2009-12-30T07:38Z,Also The French subtitles aren't integrated. At least on my end... I watched every episode and no French here.
,DHFDDT,2010-01-07T22:06Z,Can't view w/o french subs...
