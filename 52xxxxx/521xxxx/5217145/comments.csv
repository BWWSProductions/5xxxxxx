,ArtieT,2011-08-27T10:43Z,"One of my fave videos is the documentary 'Meet the Climate sceptics'

Highlights: 

Darling of denialists and transparent charlatan 'Lord' Monckton declaring he's invented 'a machine that cures AIDS'

Monckton + friend pompously showing the scientific establishment a thing or two by conducting a very quantitative experiment using a water bottle marked 'ACID' (underlined).

Monckton smarming his way through a crowd of bitter, contrarian old malcontents, who are there to desperately try to forget their civilization-building  principles so they can think only in terms of increasing their purchase power, just like the selfish offspring who will abandon them.

Oh, and did I mention the ridiculous cherrypicking, self-contradictory illogicality of AGW 'scepticism'? Here you go then:

Save yourself any more humiliation guys. It's an insult to your intelligence.

,truth81,2011-11-15T22:19Z,Artie T - you my friend are an insult to our intelligence with your misinformation and believing in something with no scientific back up. U should watch 'The Great Global Warming Swindle' (not fake) and realise u are just another victim of brainwashing and propaganda by the powers that be. Just because Al Gore has billions invested in Carbon Trading companies (what a jk) he spreads this shit and u dmb cnts just lap it up.
,RTT2,2012-07-06T10:57Z,"Yeah I've seen the 'documentary' and all the other astroturfing nonsense which turned out to be funded by Big Oil PR groups. The one you refer to is a particularly stupid example, since several of the scientists complained very publicly that they were deliberately edited and taken out of context!

Until you give up those conspiracy blogs, everything you say will apply to you...

Good Luck!"
