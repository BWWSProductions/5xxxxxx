Thanks for your patience.

,ohflip,2009-12-22T00:55Z,are the subs hardcoded ?
,dougaldog2002,2009-12-22T13:21Z,"Yes, the subs are hard coded. To use, simply open in DivX, right click the movie and click on ""Subtitle tracks"". #1 = English. #2 = French & #3 = Spanish.

Can be played on DivX Ultra Certified DVD players wuthout converting to DVD."
,dougaldog2002,2010-01-05T21:49Z,"Done seeding @ 20:1. Please continue seeding and keep this one alive!

Cheers

,Shieladog,2011-05-23T21:53Z,"I had problems with the subs not working. Using VLC 1.1.9, the error is: no suitable decoder module for fourcc `DXSA'. VLC probably does not support this sound or video format. 

Not a video expert, so I don't know what this means. The audio and video play OK."

It is true that VLC Player is giving some errors but ignore them as the movie plays fine anyway.
