The Naked Chef - Season 1

Jamie Oliver is the cooking sensation of the decade. His boundless enthusiasm, piercing blue eyes, good looks and charm have taken women by storm. He receives fan mail by the sackload and females of all ages hang outside the fashionable London restaurant where he works, hoping for a glimpse of him. Men too like his free-and-easy style.

Jamieâ€™s trademark is juggling a hectic social life with a passion for entertaining and an undoubted ability to create delicious, unpretentious dishes. His mantra for preparing simple, tasty, gutsy, common-sense food without the fuss remains the same â€“ and he still manages to combine it all with friends, family and an ability to have a good time.
