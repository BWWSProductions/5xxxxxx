Granted, the first AVP was a shitty, terrible movie... but its still someone elses movie. Wanna make a movie? Make your own, quit ripping off other peoples work. Its practically plagiarism."
[T],InternetNinjacy,2009-12-15T20:11Z,Are you serious Captain? This is like plagiarism?! Someone should call the cops! Plagiarism is practically STEALING! I hope Wraith paid the movie company for doing this. Or else they might suffer monetarily. Shame on Wraith for editing a movie into something watchable!
