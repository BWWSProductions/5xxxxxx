ScummVM (v1.0.0) ppGame

ScummVM is a collection of game engine recreations. Originally designed to play LucasArts adventure games that use the SCUMM system (the VM in the name stands for virtual machine), it now also supports a variety of non-SCUMM games by companies like Revolution Software and Adventure Soft. 
  
ScummVM is a reimplementation of the part of the software used to interpret the scripting languages such games used to describe the game world rather than emulating the hardware the games ran on; as such, ScummVM allows the games it supports to be played on platforms other than those for which they were originally released.

ScummVM was originally written by Ludvig Strigeus (creator of ÂµTorrent). Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, ScummVM is free software.
  
Note: In some games, if presented with a copy protection challenge, try entering any answer. Chances are that it will work ;-)  

ScummVM is based on SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and will run on many different platforms, processor architectures, and operating systems including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

'Built on LT technology' ... This release will be at its most useful 
if using LastOS Team's SetupS or ssWPI

Please read the included ".app" or ".ppg" file for details about the 
associated application or game, such as description, shortcuts and 
links, and other installation details. For example, look for files 
named "SetupS.app", "ppApp.app", or "ppGame.ppg" and open with your 
favorite text file reader/editor.
