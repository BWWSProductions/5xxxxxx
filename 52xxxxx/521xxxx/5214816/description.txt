Custom make-up that I got for my sims from thesimsresource community
There were more of them but most of those make-ups were overriding the default ones and I disliked that. I only kept the ones that looked nice and worked properly. 
This pack contains:

5 Eyeshadows
5 Eyeliners
7 Lipsticks
4 Costume Make-ups (Eye-lens in 3 colors, a Geisha Mask, a Lace Mask and a Toddler Thief Mask)

If you want more you can check the community.
How to install them:
1.Unzip 
2.Copy and Paste the unzipped files in C:|Documents and Settings| User |My Documents| Electronic Arts |The Sims 3| Downloads
3.Open the Sims3 Launcher and go on Downloads Tab, select and install them.
This should be it.
