Ripped from a SkyHD box using a Blackmagic Intensity card uncompressed, then compressed to roghly 35-40mbit vbc MPEG 4 AVC. 1920x1080i, frame rate is 25fps (pal) and audio is only Dolby Digital 2.0 448kbps (you may want to mux in your own DD 5.1 or DTS soundtracks via TsMuxer.

it may not be perfect, but i've looked around and compared to all other releases and this one is far superior (image quality) due to my limited video editing knowledge you may want to re-encode to your needs (blu-ray compliance, 1080p/720p mkv, 5.1 tracks, 24fps conversions?) hopefully someone in the scene can make use of this and make a proper release.

burn to a BD-RE DL and stick it in your PS3.

oh and as always, if you dont understand/appreciate what i've done here, please go download a 700mb divx rip of the dvd and leave this for people with 42inch+ HDTVs and those who only settle for the best. Thanks and enjoy
