,FSSR.Keyno,2009-12-12T19:03Z,41+gigs....ouch!
,fuck.you.wanker,2009-12-12T21:32Z,"you think thats bad, the resulting file from my capture card was roughly 800gig before compression! my compressed 40gig file allows you the headroom to compress however you choose (if needed)"
,fuck.you.wanker,2009-12-13T14:36Z,"zax and amsterdom, I suggest you read up on the hardware im using if your that bothered..
http://www.blackmagic-design.com/products/intensity/
is captures from HDMI sources UNCOMPRESSED. You might want to read up on how much data UNCOMPRESSED 1080i takes up. Then you may have a small understanding on how the best possible HD pvr rips are possible. It takes a 4-5disk sata RAID 0 Setup just to capture the uncompressed signal, so alot of hardware time and money goes into this. This is not even explaining how I disable HDCP! Show a little more gratitude, im also using all my bandwidth to seed this. "
,oxycodone,2009-12-14T23:18Z,thanx alot for this. cant wait to watch it. ill take 1080i over 720p any day of the week.
,fuck.you.wanker,2009-12-27T21:33Z,55gig uploaded in 2 weeks. How much more seeding is needed to ensure this torrent stays alive?
,fuck.you.wanker,2010-01-04T04:26Z,80gig up'd
,fuck.you.wanker,2010-01-18T14:29Z,"nearly a month of seeding 100+gigs.
out of all the people that managed to finish the download, 2 are seeding.
Not a single thank you from anyone.
I've stopped seeding as of 18/01."
,matoslav,2010-09-17T23:19Z,Please seed.
,Maverickicex,2011-02-02T09:37Z,"Umm dude, I don't know how good at math you are..

""nearly a month of seeding 100+gigs.
out of all the people that managed to finish the download, 2 are seeding.""

how could anymore than 2 have finished the download if you have only seeded a base of 100 gigs.. and just a month of seeding. lame.

40+40 = 80"
,{me},2011-08-05T06:08Z,"Maverick, you clearly have no understanding of how a torrent swarm functions.
Please fuck off. 
Sorry this died, would have been fun.

Thank you for your efforts anyways."
,dezontk101,2011-08-27T04:27Z,"Lol 41gb for 1080i. 720p would look better on all action scenes. The uploader of this is clearly a lowbob when it comes to encodes. 41gb is jokes... the full BD disk (1080p) will be about the same size rofl. Doesn't that small ""i"" in 1080i tell you it should be atleast half that full BD size.... Lul at you fool. I just finnished download a 15gb 1080p, pisses on this no doubt. Byeeeee"
,SophyBerb,2011-10-01T06:07Z,"This is downright absurd.
I'm downloading this torrent right here seeing as it won't take forever like this one would.
