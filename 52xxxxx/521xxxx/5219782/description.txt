Hi folks we promised you an update folder to our DivX Karaoke DJ folder so that it is equivalent to the 5.11GB CD+G version - our latest.

DivX is really popular, however you should be advised that it would be best if you in fact went for the CD+G version and used the simple DivX converter (included with our zipfile version torrent) that we hve posted here for you, as just a few simple keystrokes will convert the entire CD+G folder to DivX in just a few hours of leaving your computer running while it automatically converts each song in about a minute each.

We will return to our focussed seeding of the 5.11GB CD+G torrent once this launch is complete as many more seeders are needed there too (peers are waiting to join the queue so please help out if you can). Merci

This add-on folder gives a lot more Irish variety and rounds out the collection with more varied tastes within our range of great music offerings that all will enjoy.
