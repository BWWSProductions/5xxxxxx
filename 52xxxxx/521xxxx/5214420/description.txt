2010 will be a great year for Gary Numan fans, with two eagerly awaited albums coming out!


"Now I move into a period of intensive studio work. We have Dead Son Rising to finish, Splinter to get written and recorded, and both albums will be released in 2010, one in Spring, one in late summer is the current plan. Even with all the studio work 2010 will be spent mainly on the road promoting those two new albums, in the UK and elsewhere. The final two days filming of the promo video for The Fall will be done before Christmas although we have yet to decide on a release date for the single. Lot's more going on which I will tell you about as soon as I can remember. Thanks again for coming along to the tour. I genuinely loved it. "
