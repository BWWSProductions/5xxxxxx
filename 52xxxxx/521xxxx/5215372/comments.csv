,mudbubble,2009-12-19T23:08Z,How do I get graphics scaling / interpolation / hq2x / 2xSAI / whatever working with these?
,DocRockIt,2009-12-20T18:20Z,"mind.game made a good suggestion, SimTower would be great! (or YootTower)"
,Musth,2009-12-24T03:08Z,"Awesome! I love all these old DOS packs!

A few suggestions for games would be Monkey Island 3 + 4 (if possible), SimTower, SimCopter, and Skynet."
,kcc039,2009-12-24T15:33Z,"Could you convert MechWarrior 2 (1995) please? Its an old game that I had on my PC long long time ago, I can't play it on my mac.

Thanks in advance."
,PeterSimp,2009-12-26T22:09Z,"If you could do settlers 3 and/or 4 so many people would love you, I personally have tried for hours and short of having to set up boot camp I haven't been able to do it"
,Animal1000000,2009-12-27T18:01Z,"OK, how about:
Wing Commander Privateer 1 & 2

Reach for the Stars (Original DOS)
AD&D Gold Box Games (Pool of Radiance, Journey to Hilsfar, Curse of the Azure Bonds, Secret of the Silver Blades, Pools of Darkness).
AD&D Eye of the Beholder 1, 2 & 3
AD&D oh heck, all the games on this link

,mouzafc,2009-12-27T18:36Z,"Thank you

Suggestions for next volume :
Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis

,mouzafc,2009-12-27T18:39Z,"Ok, I've juste checked. Indiana Jones and the fate of Atlantis is already in Volume 4. Sorry.
Only remains : Zork Nemesis"
,nedgey,2009-12-31T07:06Z,"THNX so much for this collection. 

If still open for recommendations, it would be great to see more sci-fi adventure games, or any other adventure games.

Another one would be 'Bioforge'.

Cheers. 
J."
,etho,2009-12-31T07:38Z,"I would love to see the old Elder Scrolls games in one of these pack. Arena and Daggerfall can even be downloaded free at the Bethsoft site, but I fail at DOSbox and haven't been able to get them working adequately on my mac. That makes me sad-face.

On the other hand, these packs are awesome. I always eagerly await the next one, whatever might be on it."
,mechx,2009-12-31T19:28Z,"This is quite possibly one of the most fantastic things I have ever discovered on TPB. Thank you 1,000 times over. The only suggestion I could possibly make is to add SimTower, otherwise this is an incredible collection. Thanks again!"
,iSimond,2010-01-03T08:09Z,"@jason99KR Mortal Kombat can be found in Classic games collection formatted for Mac OS X (Vol. 5)


Otherwise, Lands of lore could be cool"
,spookbot,2010-01-04T03:20Z,"Cool!!

Suggestions:

Warlords
Warlords II
PGA Tour Golf
Dark Castle
Shufflepuck
Deliverance"
,twistquist,2010-01-14T21:54Z,I dont know much about the DOS business but I would love to see Resident Evil 2 on mac! I cant find it anywhere
,8Nasir,2010-01-17T13:21Z,"Nice torrent. If you could get Heroes of Might and Magic 3 Complete for the next one, it would be highly appreciated. :)"
,unseen-onlyheard,2010-01-25T01:31Z,"If you get Heroes III on here, I would love you forever. I can even get you a copy of heroes III to convert to mac os x, but i'm sure you could find that too. This is great! Thanks!"
,corruptop,2010-01-26T12:14Z,"Thanks man, Try Hugo House of Horror, Crossroads, Body Armour, Bio Menace or Descent"

,cupasoup,2010-02-14T17:42Z,"These torrents are brilliant!! Can't wait for the next one! Any idea when we can expect it?
Someone mentioned warlords which would be awesome and also moonstone, not sure if they were DOS games as I used to play them on an amiga. Here's hoping though!

Cheers Brukerdose"
,cupasoup,2010-02-15T12:47Z,"Thought of a few more games I'd like to see. OK here's a list:

,Jeffas94,2010-02-18T19:41Z,Could you please make Red Alert 2 from Westwood studios? And Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge from EA games please?
,Dutch_Watcher,2010-03-02T02:17Z,My Mac AV-protect said : Joke.Scr in the Bubble Bobble game. I wuz too lazy to look it up any further. I just skipped this game and downloaded the other zips. 
,derpderpderpderpderpderp,2010-03-03T09:12Z,"Why does Raptor start with so much money? Have any of the other games been ""tweaked"" in similar ways?"
,gnarlybro,2010-03-03T22:37Z,"Thank you so much, these games bring back lots of warm fuzzy memories and they work great except wing commander 2. Every time i start the game it lets me play until the end of the first mission then it cuts to the dos screen and it says ILLEGAL COMMAND C:/ GAMEDAT and then it has a bunch of random characters... I'm not sure if that's enough info but does anyone have any ideas?"
,the_yolker,2010-03-16T01:52Z,"THX for all the good classics!

Since you've already been at it with the old classic pinball games, how about converting 'Extreme Pinball' as well?

Keep up the good work"

,JazzyJT08,2010-05-16T20:54Z,"Hello, I am having trouble getting Fullscreen to work, I'm on a dell mini 10v hackintosh, but that shouldn't matter right? Pressing ALT + Enter does nothing and then pressing, well whatever the button next to it is (it's a windows button on the hackintosh keyboard), simply kills dosbox, where is, using the ACTUAL dosbox program using the button net to alt and enter lets fullscreen work. I'm not very savvy so, I'm not sure what to do. Any help would be appreciated it, thank you and this is a wonderful program/job by brukerdose. Thank you!"
,Wheel83,2010-06-14T05:48Z,"I second the X-Com 3-Apocalypse request and I raise one Die By the Sword request.
