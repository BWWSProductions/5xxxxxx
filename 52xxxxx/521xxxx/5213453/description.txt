Courage in Red S01E04 - ERT

This 13 part series goes behind closed doors to reveal many aspects of the RCMP. These aspects include: protecting schools, cadet training, peacekeeping, ERT, remote policing, drug labs, youth policing, frontline policing, VIPs etc.


Episode Info: The Emergency Response Team is a group of highly-trained RCMP members capable of employing specialized weapons, equipment, and tactics to resolve extremely high-risk situations. For the first time cameras have been allowed to record some of these tactical procedures and scenarios. From boarding vessels in the Pacific Ocean at high speeds to rescue operations for a hostage in a remote part of Manitoba, this is a glimpse into what ERT does on a daily basis.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion. The broadcast was HD but because of my conversion method, it is not as high quality as scene HD releases so I have labeled it as WS instead of HDTV.
