I think I have source material for all of the eps but am way behind on conversions/uploading. 

The episode numbers at http://courageinred.ca/ and the order of airing don't match. 

I am using order of airing, so it would be useful to know what the topic of the episode you are missing (or the date it was broadcast) so that I can ensure that I upload the one you want sooner than the rest."
