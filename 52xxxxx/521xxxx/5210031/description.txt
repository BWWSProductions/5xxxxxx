"Daniel is an ordinary young man in SÃ£o Paulo. Since his birth, he is used to see people with cancer being treated and cured through a method developed by his great-grandfather, Estevam Kovacsik. It was something usual until, during a certain period in his life, he observed that this is not something usually seen in the world, where millions of people die from cancer every year. This period is a conflicting moment of truth for him, who begins to search for the truth by reconstructing the history of his great-grandfather and trying to answer two questions: does this treatment really works? And if so, why the world is still unaware of it?"
