,lordzarquon,2009-12-12T05:58Z,I just watched the teaser and the first scene and the audio is completely wrong. It's not out by a few milliseconds like is often the case. It sounds like it's from completely different scenes.
,rodzilla2,2009-12-12T06:37Z,Audio is totally off.  Video is only 15 min long. DO NOT DOWNLOAD

Friday 12/11/09 there were two NEW episodes back to back.  S02E07 AND S02E08
Where is E08 ???"

When something is missing here you can always google it and then upload here. That is if you care a little bit."

Used the magnet link and never read the comments before I downloaded this one.
Audio is out of sync and its not a complete episode."
