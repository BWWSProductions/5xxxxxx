The simply titled LIVE offers a glimpse of AIC's moody, explosive live performances, captured between 1990 and 1996. Pre-dating the band's Columbia recordings is the country-punk track "Queen of the Rodeo," also found on the box set MUSIC BANK. ...    Full DescriptionThis track is a notable inclusion, showing that Alice In Chains have a sense of humor behind the wall of musical gloom they've made for themselves.

Best displayed on "Would?" and "Angry Chair," the tasteful, all-too-often overlooked drumming of Sean Kinney shines brightly here. The included version of "Love Hate Love" has a Doors-like intensity, with Layne Staley's vocal dynamics piloting the track like a vessel. LIVE is short on stage banter and thankfully long in unpolished, raw, powerful live recordings of these seminal Seattle hard rock masters.

Recorded live between 1990 & 1996.
