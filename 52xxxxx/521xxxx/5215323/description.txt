Identity theft and Identity Fraud are growing problems around the World. Although the US shows signs of decrease in the total value of it (to $ 15.6 billion/year) Identity Theft seems to be on a rise in other countries around the world. The more information is available on you  the greater chances  are of you becoming a victim of Identity Fraud. The more privacy you have the safer you are.
Obviously these two subjects are interconnected- itâ€™s not as straightforward as I made it look line above but if you are interested in I present you with a collection of 21 eBooks to deeper explore it.

All of them are PDF with retail covers for thumbnail view, each one separately packed with 7zip.
These are plain archives- no SFX, no viruses- it just saves me a lot of bandwidth in the long run.
