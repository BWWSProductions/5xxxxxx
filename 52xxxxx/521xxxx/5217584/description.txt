From the Back Cover

Events ranging from Hurricane Katrina to the global economic crisis have taught businesspeople an unforgettable lesson: if you donâ€™t plan for â€œextreme risk,â€ you endanger your organizationâ€™s very survival. But how can you plan for events that go far beyond anything that occurs in normal day-to-day business? In Learning from Catastrophes, two renowned experts present the first comprehensive strategic framework for assessing, responding to, and managing extreme risk. Howard Kunreuther and Michael Useem build on their own breakthrough work on mitigating natural disasters, extending it to the challenges faced by real-world enterprises.

Along with the contributions of leading experts in risk management, heuristics, and disaster recovery, they identify the behavioral biases and faulty heuristics that mislead decision makers about the likelihood of catastrophe. They go on to identify the hidden links associated with extreme risks, and present techniques for systematically building greater resilience into the organization. The global best-seller The Black Swan told executives that â€œonce in a lifetimeâ€ events are far more common and dangerous than they ever realized. Learning from Catastrophe shows them exactly what to do about it.
