Another way of looking at it is that this way he and others willing to seed can help others get a full set like you've got instead of just trying to fill some ""collector's set"". :) P2P isn't the type of place for ""What's In It For Me' leechers. ;)

Thanks, Black Moth, always appreciate your posts."
