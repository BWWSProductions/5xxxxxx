This is the audiobook to the Sookie Stackhouse short story collection, A Touch of Dead, by Charlaine Harris.  Read by Johanna Parker.  These short stories only feature Sookie.

The order of the short stories in A Touch of Dead:
1 - Fairy Dust
2 - Dracula Night
3 - One Word Answer
4 - Lucky
5 - Gift Wrap

I have split each book up into their chapters.  I've grown tired of audio books and them being broken up in random places.  In the original torrent, they were split up into at least a hundred smaller pieces, and I joined together those pieces to create a chapter.
