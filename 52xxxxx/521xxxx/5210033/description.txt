Can't manage to download a server? Here is your chance.

This installfile will download the whole server for you, from Steam. After the server is download, it can be launched instantly.

The server will use about 300mb of your harddrive and it's a standalone version, which means you won't need Steam to run it.

If you have any questions please ask.

Here is a guide if you need help installing with the installfile.
