Any chance you could upload the 2009 movie Amelia? Your 2012 and The Box were great. Cheers!"

Cheers
Jon"

@grayscales: when Amelia comes ""out"" (probably as TS) I'll see if quality is good enough for re-encoding. But, judging from the current movements, I rather would wait till some R5 with decent sound pops-up. "
,CAMILEON,2009-12-19T16:26Z,This movie is really cool :)
,lilars26,2009-12-30T21:22Z,Looks good...thank you.
