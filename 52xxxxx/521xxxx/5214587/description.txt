- [ RELEASE INFO ] -

Hi! Started play with a music program in autumn 2008, and I started a MySpace page
just a week after and have been streeming my beats trou them. And got great critics on
my beats from friends and ppl on the net. Which inspires me to make more and newer
beats for me and others to listen too.

I make mostly Electro beats with a mix of Trance/Psytrance/Goa in some. Some beats even
breakbeats. I have done alot of visual videos for my beats, that are availible atandalso.


Best Regards Balubish
Enjoy! Peace!
