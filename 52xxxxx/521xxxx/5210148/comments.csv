,JohnnyAction,2012-04-23T22:36Z,Same problem here.  Crashes after intro videos and a few seconds of menu music.  XP SP3.  Solutions?
,ndimension,2012-06-01T20:03Z,"If your game crashes on startup (WinXP):

1. Install the game.
2. Apply the patch (use browse, and remember where the patch went, notice that it installs to folder/folder/DOWNLOADS).
3. Go to where you installed the patch, inside the DOWNLOAD folder you will have files, COPY them to Cataclysm install folder (overwrite). 
4. Now go to torrented files and copy cataclysm.exe  (overwrite)

The solution is simple,the patch does not APPLY the patch. It only EXTRACTS the files to a folder. You have to manually copy the files to patch the game and then apply the crecked *.exe."
