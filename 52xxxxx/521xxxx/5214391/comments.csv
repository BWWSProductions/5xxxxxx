but nice upload!"

Give me the chance to make them happy. I think you can find the same movie on TPB with englishe subs or other my friends. There are a lot of different nationalities and sometimes you can't make everybody happy so sorry about that."

,russell1nash,2009-12-14T23:46Z,"well, as i said, it is a nice upload! 
as a Herzog fan, i've been looking for this, but no release with EN subs so far. The reason I want EN subs? EN is not my first language, so the subs help when it comes to barely audible dialogue and slang. Just as, I believe, it does for everybody with a different from EN first language.
So, once again, this is a good upload, but, alas, not for me. Sorry if my frustration annoyed u:) "
