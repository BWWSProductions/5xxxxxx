,sciencepilot,2010-03-20T11:57Z,"for not having enough knowledge in realizing AND reading the ""exe"" (setup) ... an the fact that its only 4MB so its a commum sense thing. im gonna try it out, does this work with the other upload ""Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate"" ? I hope so because its easier to download from the website the trial verson and use this setup. anyone tried this?"
