What the hell is wrong with you? I just searched for ""Dexter season 4"" and you posted comments linking to that torrent on all of them? Why does it matter to you which torrent someone chooses to download?"
,hiddeninbooks,2009-12-30T17:50Z,"hey - the picture quality is great, and the background track plays fine, but the speaking track doesnt seem to be there... is there something I did wrong, or is there something wrong with this file? (I use VLC player) thanks!"
,anpe91,2010-01-02T13:30Z,"@hiddeninbooks

Try using K-Lite codec pack with Windows Media Player. I have never had a problem. It can even play .MKV files which are amazing in quality. Don't know what format these will be in, but since it's a pretty large download, I would say it's .MKV or .MP4"
,anpe91,2010-01-03T22:14Z,"Yup, it's .MKV :)"
,bstard13,2010-02-17T01:48Z,"@RealBeats!!
How fucking stupid are you?? Irregal's torrent is Highres: 720p. Hence the size of this download!.
What gives you the right to post your torrent-link here? If you have zero downloaders, the reason is that you're a rude little muthafucka. 
@Irregal: Thanks, i've been looking for Dexter season 4 in highresolution!!!
Gracias!!!"
,Loody_91,2010-02-19T01:30Z,Where can I find appropriate English subs for this one? It doesn't have any release name.
,Grimelark,2010-02-21T22:25Z,"The part I can see looks great however, I can't seem to play this on any player I've tried it on, I've down loaded a MKV specific player and  it still had sever issues with play back, plus no sound.  Anyone have an idea?"
,RipMinyn,2010-04-03T02:13Z,"subs...

,Phorat,2010-04-05T04:23Z,"Thanks!  Please seed, people!"
,Cespur,2010-06-22T22:31Z,"This sucks. I've been downloading this for weeks and it just finisht, but isn't playing. Yes, I got all the codecs and I use VLC and have never experienced any problems what so ever with HD MKV's, so what the heck is wrong with this one?"
,stedenfeldt9,2010-07-06T14:57Z,"sorry I have no solution for your problem, but it works great on my system me and quality is excellent."
,zzyuhh,2010-12-17T05:33Z,"@RealBeats
Yeah, but this one doesn't have a crappy quality."
