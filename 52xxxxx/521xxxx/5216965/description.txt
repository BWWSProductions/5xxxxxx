Alva Noto continues with his brand of error-music that sounds experimental yet surprisingly soothing. We hear more of Ryuichi Sakamoto's piano on this record than on, say, Vrioon or Insen. Whether it's the piano stuttering on Siisx, or its mysterious variation on Mur (Siisx & Mur are really one piece broken into two movements), or the incredibly innovative remix of Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence on Ax Mr.L., Noto & Sakamoto are clearly artistic collaborators of the highest order. I definitely recommend this CD to listeners who are not averse to, for lack of a better phrase, unconventional music.
