[Quote]Account Balances:
Earnings will accumulate in the user's accounts until we arrange to make payouts. New members must wait a 6 month new member verification period to become eligible for such said payments. The new member verification period is necessary to eliminate any and all cheaters. Payouts are subject to the success of ""the service"". Should ""the service"" be unsuccessful the site shall be sold and the members will receive a percentage of such said sale of ""the service"". With the total percentage paid out to members not to exceed 50% of the net of such said sale. ""The Service"" also reserves the right to adjust account balances as necessary to ensure success of ""the service"". PayPal is the preferred option to send payouts to astunn.com members. If you are unable to receive PayPal payments to the email address we have on record, we will contact you at said email address and request a physical address where we may send payment. [/Quote] =P"

IE: LinkBucks type sites."
