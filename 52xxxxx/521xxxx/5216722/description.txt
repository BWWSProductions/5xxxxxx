This is all the songs number one to thirteen from full HD edit of her XMAS special @320kbps. Ripped with AoA audio extractor. I Also have the video in full HD. Hard to seed large files when I only have 35kbs upload speed total. I would be happy to try but would only be able to sustain 5-10 kbs for the video. The songs with another artists name are either them with Carrie or they can be solo. Sorry about not having names, but this is from a TV special, and rather than mislable them I chose not to associate any name with them.
