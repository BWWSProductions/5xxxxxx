South Park Season 13
Episode 10 - W.T.F.

Kids of South Park star their own Wrestling Federation in response to not being allowed on the schol wrestling team because they think that the TV version is the real thing and think that is what real wrestling is.  

Another cute episode from Matt & Trey
