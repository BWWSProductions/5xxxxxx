The video for "Happy" was filmed in Cuba and directed by Jake Nava on 29 September 2009. It premiered on UK music channel The Box on 17 October 2009.

The video shows Lewis flirting and falling in love with a man, giving the watcher a sense that the feelings are reciprocal. However, when it becomes apparent that Lewis is in love with him, he only sees her as a good friend.

The video is interspersed with Lewis preparing herself for the wedding.
