,blaiksapplause,2009-12-22T02:18Z,"You, my friend, are awesome! You said this was your first time? Well then i cant wait to see when you've done it a thousand times, because even the big major groups out there had no chance of beating the quality of your video. Awesome job! It has a pretty darn good download speed too. You should be proud, this is the best quality video i have ever seen coming from a camera. Looks just like the best quality dvd rips out there. You have tons of potential, cause this looks great! Good job! 
=)"

,spikeybadger,2009-12-23T00:43Z,"quality looks to be a telecine rip, these are just below R5 rips because of the colour balance levels. you can hear the sound of either the projector or a telecine machine in the background. 
THIS IS NOT A CAM... unless its a really really decent tesesync which i doubt the picture is too good to make this a cam, best quality by far."

,achshar,2010-01-09T19:15Z,sample is really pretty... the sounds a bit glitchy but it is completely watchable.. infact the best i'v seen so far.. and i have a vary slow connection and the dwnlod graph wont leave the roof in my bittorent so i can predict it would have great download speed... thank so much have been waiting for this... please see if you could have he same print for james cameron's avatar... 
,212hal,2010-01-16T07:17Z,"I agree with achshar about the sound and somewhat the quality. Its not a great cam, but decent enough. 8 for Video and 6-7 for Audio. If this had been a dvd-rip, then the score would be lower of course. However, we all got different screens, software and so on, so not everyone might notice the lack of definition in some scenes. Kudos for uploading this:)"
