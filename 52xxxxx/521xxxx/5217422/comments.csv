,krispgreen,2009-12-15T19:35Z,"Hey I ve been burned a couple of times ""partially cause i am new to this and partially cause i seem to believe that all people are potentially good""  So when I come across someone like you I dont mind seeding everything I download.  Is 1 - 1 seeding a bad thing?"

,malatata,2009-12-16T06:40Z,i kinda get the feeling that your ignoring me. i just need a yes or a no about the episodes of 30rock or the office
,sabian212,2009-12-16T14:48Z,ah right....thanks for the reply:P
,shagznmonoxide,2009-12-17T18:56Z,the subs didn't work and i don't know if it does i am transfering them to my sony walkman first then to ps3 so it is all on file
,]eep,2009-12-20T18:25Z,"quality is very good, but the audio is pretty badly out of sync on my pc (trails >1 sec). "
,latexink,2009-12-22T21:27Z,"PS3/360 subtitles are succesfully encoded (both full subs and only prawnspeak) but these do not work on consoles as they are not hardcoded and not supported (yet?). They are there and work on an appleTV or on a PC/Mac if you have your lappie hooked to your screen and use quicktime/vlc, but the POS consoles must think that supporting subtitles would foster piracy or something.... This is however an excellent copy and looks great though. If you can hardcode the subs without recoding the movie, please post and let me know. Every method i can find involves transcoding multiple times."
,954blade,2009-12-28T22:52Z,Superb! Thanks HR.
,1COR1313,2009-12-31T02:34Z,"Great Upload. 

Looks amazing on my AppleTV and the Subs for Afrikaans and Alien are perfect. thanks again HR."
,MrGerbz,2010-01-02T05:11Z,"What's up with the subs? Why can I only chose either Prawn subs or full subs?

Why would you think we wouldn't want to just see subs under both Prawns and Afrikaans?

And you're talking about getting the .srt file from another torrent, at least provide a link to it then."
,MrGerbz,2010-01-02T05:54Z,"I just found out that the partial subs, miss out a LOT of stuff.

I hate it when people do half-assed work, so I'll be looking for another District 9 release until the Blu-Ray is released in the Netherlands."
,Xanagil,2010-01-06T18:44Z,"WARNING: Subtitles are done very poorly. Track 1 will get let you read (most) subtitles for prawns but not the Nigerians. It also appears with subtitle track 1 when prawns are talking to Nigerians you get no subtitles what so ever on this track. Track 2 will show all those subs but will also display subs for every spoken word, even English.    "

,Xanagil,2010-01-06T18:46Z,^ didnt mean to double post ^ :/
,bcshelds420,2010-01-06T23:24Z,i have combined community codec pack and am playing on windows media player 9. Why is the audio so terribly out of sync?
,Xanagil,2010-01-07T02:23Z,Why should I fix it? It's your torrent. Im just commenting on how the torrent works. 
,loutenant,2010-01-07T07:40Z,"make ur life simple dowloaders, 1. download the movie, 2. convert to dvd (use converxtodvd), 3. play it on powerdvd9, you got HD my friend and it's not out of sync. For me, my pc is wired to my 37"" LCD. i don't know why people use wmp to watch movie....thanks HR for another great upload..."
,bcshelds420,2010-01-07T08:29Z,"loutenant: I have tried wiring my computer to my pc in the past, however my crappy 27"" prima has worse quality than my monitor, and i cant afford a 37""LCD atm.

However, downloading VLC 1.0.3 fixed the sync problem, so thanks HolyRoses, both for the tip and the upload"
,bcshelds420,2010-01-07T08:30Z,that should say tv to pc... i should smoke less
,Maniakis143,2010-01-07T22:46Z,"Hey HR, I'm an addict to diet coke too, I'll freak out if my fridge is out of diet coke or diet pepsi..I'm following this popconrhour on twitter, very interesting ..."
,loutenant,2010-01-09T02:27Z,"@1core1313,  I need to get me one of that Apple TV, $229 at Amazon  huh coz i have no idea how to put a sub on powerdvd9 & i think it's impossible, i'm close to hd like 620p watching this good movie but i don't understand what the prawns & afrikaas are saying so this Apple tv is cool but i'm on windows 7 ultimate, is there a conflict, I haven't google it"
