If you mix a pitbull with a chow chow that dog is forever mixed...How many people call Tiger Woods...Black?...Nuff Said"
[T],Quazza,2009-12-12T04:17Z,"So, you can't respond with anything but that ""tiger woods is not black, he is mixed!""

That's all you got?! LOL!!!

I sure hope you remember that Obama is mixed. It's not like opposition to him hasn't been called racist.

But anyways...following your logic...

Since every race in the world is racist towards another race in one way or another...(and this clearly applies to all of the people of that race since that is your defense for saying Rush is a racist)

which race are you, yourself, racist against?"
,thunderbum,2009-12-12T04:18Z,Thanks for the up!
,obama_sucks,2009-12-12T18:43Z,"Rush is not racist he just tells it like it is.....If everyone was that way this world would be a better place...Barack Ocaca is fallen apart on his own im enjoyin seeing it , everyone thought he was perfect and just like tiger woods it will all come crashing down on him when he is fully exposed for the Liar Marxist Facist Socialist and Muslism he really is..OH and by the way SHOW THE Birth Certificate "
,trickdaddy0024,2009-12-13T19:38Z,"""I sure hope you remember that Obama is mixed. It's not like opposition to him hasn't been called racist."" -- Qussy I've just explained that very point to everyone reading this post including you...And if people call the attacks racist than that their opinion... Opinions only become facts when you have evidence...I have already said that every pure race is racist...So if people say that Limbaugh is racist then you ask for their evidence...We could just go back to the Donovan McNabb comments...The NFL told one of the most wealthiest man in American that your money is no good here...Why...Because then have determined that his comments were in facts racist to 80% of the Players in the League...Bottom line is other NFL owner are racist but they dont have their comments written in Black and White...I wont even get into his New Orleans comments..which race are you, yourself, racist against? --Qussy  How irrelevant!!! Nobody here gets paid 300 millions dollars for their comments...Next ""Rush is not racist he just tells it like it is""...""OH and by the way SHOW THE Birth Certificate"" obama_has_luck...Theres are the people Limbaugh is making millions on...END"
,trickdaddy0024,2009-12-13T19:40Z,These* are the people Limbaugh is making millions on...END--correction
