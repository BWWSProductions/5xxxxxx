The battle of Jericho is one of the most enduring biblical stories. The description of the â€œwalls falling downâ€ is among its most well-known accounts. Yet, the most famous excavation of this ancient site, carried out in the 1950's under the direction of Kathleen Kenyon, claims that there wasnâ€™t even a city at Jerichoâ€”much less city wallsâ€”at the time when Joshua supposedly conquered it.

For more than fifty years scholars have built a wall of doubt against the historical accuracy of the Bible using Jericho as one of its cornerstones. Itâ€™s time to face those challenges head on! Itâ€™s time to determine whether or not the conclusions of modern scholarship stand in light of the evidence or if those arguments donâ€™t in fact collapse like Jerichoâ€™s walls.

Join us, as we return to the site of one of historyâ€™s most important battles in order to explore the crucial question relating to Joshuaâ€™s conquest: Did the walls of Jericho really come tumbling down? Find out here in this episode of Expedition Bible.

â€œBe strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give themâ€ (Joshua 1:6).
