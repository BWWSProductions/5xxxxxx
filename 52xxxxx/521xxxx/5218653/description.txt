Rare 1986 compilation of oral clips from the very hard to find Western Visuals titles. Rumor was that their old warehouse burned down along with all the masters for these films. I hope that is BS. Hosted by Paul Thomas and Careena Collins. Has trailer for part 2 as well.


WANTED: 

OLD WESTERN VISUALS TITLES LIKE THE ONES SHOWN IN THIS FILM. Dig em up guys and share the wealth.
