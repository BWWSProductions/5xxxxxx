,jjsmalls,2010-01-09T04:47Z,"check that.  just downloaded xmbc player, and it plays everything i've downloaded from ""[D]"" wonderfully.  get xmbc; especially if you're on an older mac."

,zaroba,2010-04-24T22:19Z,it seems that only the first 1 min 20 secs of the eps will play in vlc.
[T],[D],2010-07-19T00:39Z,"Indeed, vlc is not supported due to ordered chapters. 
Use media player classic+haali splitter+coreavc 2.0+any ac3 decoder."
,blahblah2,2010-07-28T21:44Z,"you can disable ordered chapters and watch these mkv in VLC.
in the configuration file :
# Ordered chapters (boolean)
mkv-use-ordered-chapters=0"
