If you want consistent volume level, use a player that can calculate and apply ReplayGain.  That will adjust the volume without altering the data."
[V],LosslessDude,2009-12-15T22:56Z,"You are quite wrong, what you are describing is hard limiting...

The Normalize effect amplifies the entire file or selection equally. For example, if the original audio reaches a loud peak of 80% and a quiet low of 20%, normalizing to 100% amplifies the loud peak to 100% and the quiet low to 40%.

So nothing is changed... (btw this is straight from the manuel in adobe audition)

Dont mess with an audiophile.... : P"
