SCE Studios Liverpool brings the future back. This entry in the racing series features 24 new reversible circuits, a load of fresh high-speed vehicles and some deadly new weaponry. There's also a new track feature called the Mag-Strip, which acts like a magnet and temporarily locks ships to the levels, enabling exciting things like loops and vertical drops. Newcomers to the WipEout franchise will likely revel over the introduction of a training mode, taking you through the basics. Most exciting of all is a new online multiplayer feature, where racers can battle each other at amazing speeds.
