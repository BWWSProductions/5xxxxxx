         On Michael McDonald-This Christmas: A Soundstage Special      
         Event, Michael McDonald combines yuletide favorites such      
         as "White Christmas" and the more modern Stevie Wonder        
         Motown classic "What Christmas Means to Me" with a few of     
         his signature hits like "I Keep Forgettin'" for a perfect     
         blend of holiday cheer. On other classics like "Peace" and    
         "Have Yourself a Merry Christmas," McDonald is accompanied    
         by strings, adding an entirely new dynamic to the diverse     
         set. McDonald's soulful, throaty baritone infuses the         
         popular yuletide songs with a unique vocal styling that       
          adds the perfect twist to everyone's holiday season!
