Art makes the Object, and religion lives only in its many ties to
that Object, but philosophy very clearly sets itself apart from both.
It neither stands enmeshed with an Object, as religion, nor makes
one, as art, but rather places its pulverizing hand upon all the business
of making Objects as well as the whole of objectivity itself, and
so breathes the air of freedom. Reason, the spirit of philosophy, concerns
itself only with itself, and troubles itself over no Object. God,
to the philosopher, is as neutral as a stone â€” the philosopher is a
dedicated atheist. If he busies himself with God, there is no reverence
here, only rejection, for he seeks only that reason which has
concealed itself in every form, and that only in the light of reason.
Reason only seeks itself, only troubles itself about itself, loves only
itself â€” or rather, since it is not even an Object to itself â€” does
not love itself but simply is with itself. And so, with a correct instinct,
Neander10 has proclaimed the destruction of the â€˜God of the
philosophers.â€™
But as it lies outside of our theme, we have not undertaken to
speak any further of philosophy as such
