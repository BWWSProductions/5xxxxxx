,oversoul53,2009-12-29T11:27Z,"@maolin that's not true, that's NOT the last episode this season, look here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Guy_(season_8)

and btw, I'm npot sure if u know or not but episode 9 is broken, when I play it it skips. like it literally skips like 3 minutes of video are random moments. just a little fyi for ya.

otherwise GREAT torrent!"

I had no trouble with episode 9, what player are you using? Seems that DivX player is having trouble playing the newer DivX/Xvid coded files so maybe you should try K-Lite which is what I use. 
Great upload, keep em' coming"
