I found a trainer that only did exp, and I was hoping to find something like this so I could change my stats to make it look like everything matched up.  Thanks again!"

how stupid are you 2?  cheats dont use trainers, u cant cheat in single player cus u cant cheat yourself, just cus its called a trainer it dont mean its for people that cant play either. cheating is only cheating when u gain from it over others, cheats are the dick heads online that hide with a sniper rifle permanently and take ppl out with head shots. we use trainers for a bit of FUN, when u cant be bothered to get into the game and play seriously, u just wanna put it on max difficulty and wipe everything out, explore the parts of the map u dont usually see when playing missions and doing things u cant do on default settings like jumping onto buildings and seeing the game from a different viewpoint and having a look round to see what u can find. trainers are used for an UNSERIOUS bit of fun, u cant make yaself better at the game by using a trainer, the only way u can advance ya skills and ability is by playing the game as its meant to be played. u use a trainer and u just stand there shooting continuously, u dont need to find cover so how does that help u when playing the game properly? it dont cus you'd be dead. 
just think about it before u speak cus the only thing on noob level is ya common sense. and why the fuck are u even on this torrent with those opinions. your mentallity is at noob level.
sort yaselves out."
