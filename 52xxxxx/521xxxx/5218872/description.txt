Release Notes:

They're back bitches.

The Mighty Mighty Bosstones have stuck more pins in the map and pulled
more Gin from taps than they care to remember. Over the years theyâ€™ve
earned the reputation as one of the hardest touring bands in rock. Now
they are back with their first full length studio release in seven
years. Featuring 14 new songs â€œPin Points and Gin Jointsâ€ has the band
at their fun, exuberant, chaotic best. The rare band comfortable in
almost any genre they are also patient, passionate songwriters.
Blending ska and soul, punk and metal, and arrow to the heart pop,
these songs are the Bosstones at their best. Lead singer and lyricist
Dicky Barrett is at the top of his game as a brash cynic, a harsh
critic and a crooner with a heart of gold. His voice as both a
storyteller and poet is highlighted in songs about family life,
politics, war, art, biker gangs, baseball, ska music legends and blue
collar stiffs. With Pin Points and Gin Joints the Bosstones have taken
their trademark power chord, driving horns, wicked backbeat sound back
to the barroom for another round of shots.
