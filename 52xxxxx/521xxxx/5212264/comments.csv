,Strykerius,2010-02-09T07:41Z,Thank you sir for this fine torrent.
,DOcteurBuisson,2010-05-29T19:49Z,"I can't install ""sims 2 original.iso"".
I can install additional drives, but not the game.
How do I install it?"
,gamemaster123,2010-05-30T18:40Z,have you tried mounting it i recommend slysoft virtual clone drive its free go to this site:http://www.slysoft.com/download.html and then download the last one
,DOcteurBuisson,2010-06-02T11:30Z,Which software should I install the game ?
,gamemaster123,2010-06-03T22:17Z,if you mean with wich software then virtual clone drive start with original then espansions
,melsyaccord,2010-07-01T07:45Z,"I installed and when I tried to play it said something about compatibility and what not. I got an update off the ea site and then tried to play it again, it keeps saying insert the correct cd/dvd. I put in sims 2 original, it's not working"
,gamemaster123,2010-07-08T19:31Z,@melsyaccordrnrnyou updated it and by doing that the .exe file (the crack) is overwritten and so it asks for an original dvd/cd try reinstalling and then DONT update and press continu when it asks for combactility (if using windows vista or 7 this pops up just ignore it and press contineu)
,lily_hermosa,2010-10-14T09:53Z,"Hey gamemaster, thank you for such a huge upload!
I've followed the steps you've given, I've also downloaded Virtual Clone Drive which you reccomended.

I'd really appreciate some steps in which order i use everything. Are there any maybe youtube videos which display the order? I'm not quite sure what to do,  install the game, or mount it first?

Thank you!!!"
,lily_hermosa,2010-10-14T11:39Z,"Hmm. An even simpler question.


What file do I mount? Thanks

(sorry for being so silly :) )"
,gamemaster123,2010-10-15T18:00Z,you mount the iso/bin files and you can do that with clicking the right mouse button on the iso file then virtual clone drive and then mount and run the autorun
,lily_hermosa,2010-10-16T00:08Z,"Thanks for your reply, glad to see you still actively check these :)

New problem, it still tells me to please insert the CD.

These are the steps we've taken.

1) Downloaded your file from this website and Virtual Clone Drive
2) Unzipped the file
3) Installed the Sims 2 Original, used Keygen and Crack.
4) Right mouse button on the iso file then virtual clone drive and then mounted to a DVD drive.
5) Double clicked on the DVD drive to see if it would work. It still tells us that theres no CD inserted. 

Is it because we installed it THEN mounted it?

Thank you SO MUCH once again for your replies :)"
,lily_hermosa,2010-10-16T00:16Z,"Also, why does it say ""Sims 2 Freetime"", instead of Sims 2, when I know I've only installed Sims 2 Original?

They seem to not be seperate?"
,lily_hermosa,2010-10-16T00:43Z,"Update: 


It still won't work when we mount it first. Still tells us that we need a CD..."
,lily_hermosa,2010-10-16T00:54Z,"I'm sorry about all these comments, I wish there was an edit button so I could put them all under one comment!

Just noticed that the image file is a 
""elby.vcdmount""

It's meant to be an iso file, right? Should I change this using Folder2Iso, or should I leave it?"
,gamemaster123,2010-11-02T22:37Z,you know now i understand what you meant and what went wrong go to gamecopyworld.com and type in the sims 2 than download a new nocd creack. the crack i inserted was for freetime sorry for late reply
,Looseminded768,2010-11-23T00:24Z,"Hello.

I've installed the game along with all of the expansions and cracked it like you've got in your readme files and it works fine. :)

HOWEVER:
When I try and load a family, I get a game-crash error and it terminates.

Any ideas on how to remedy this? :S
Willing to provide a screenshot of the error message if needed."
,gamemaster123,2010-11-27T22:51Z,okay sorry for the late reply i dont check that often but give me the screenshot then i know what message youre getting and then i will see if i know how to fix it.
,Looseminded768,2010-11-29T01:54Z,"http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/4306/sims2o.png

There is the link to the error message.  There was also the same error before I was getting to loading families, but increasing my virtual memory remedied that."
,gamemaster123,2010-12-04T22:17Z,"So the problem is over it could indeed be that your ram memory was too low and that the game could not function well also remind to run as admin and if your not sure your pc can handle the game go to this website and check it youreself

,Looseminded768,2010-12-05T03:54Z,Still have the same error.  System passes minimum requirements. :c
,gamemaster123,2010-12-08T08:14Z,"try reinstalling (run as admin) and maybe you could get another crack at

,FromUtah,2011-03-06T16:49Z,"Gamemaster123, I've downloaded all the files but my virus software removes the fff-ea189.exe from the keygen folder stating it's a trojan file.  I'm not what to do from here.  I don't dare click on it to generate the keys. Can you please advise on what to do for the keys?  Thanks"
,FromUtah,2011-03-06T17:28Z,"Gamemaster123,

Could you please re-upload the keygen folder.  My virus software states there's a trojan attached to this file (fff-ea1889.exe).  Thanks"
,PATR01T,2011-05-13T18:20Z,Yay I love this this here. First time user but I understand it. I will seed after. this is awesome I use Utorrent. Is that the best one?
,gamemaster123,2011-05-30T10:46Z,I use utorrent 2 so yes
,gamemaster123,2011-05-30T10:47Z,@FromUtah remove the torrent file then readd it (or right click the torrent and say force recheck) it should see that there is a file missing it is a false positive so disable your antivirus
,Tonars420,2012-04-02T21:51Z,"READ IMPORTANT!!!

If you do not have a good anti virus software i would not recommend downloading this, i detected and stopped a Trojan Horse virus from entering my computer which was located in the keygen folder, I am still not sure if it works or not, one I am finished downloading and installing it I will leave another comment saying if it worked for me or not. "
,Tonars420,2012-04-02T22:18Z,Hey is the trojan virus threat in the keygen folder for real or is it just my antivirus mucking up?
