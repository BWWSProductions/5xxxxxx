Florence and the Machine (also written as Florence + the Machine), is the recording name of Florence Welch and a collaboration of other artists who provide backing music for her voice. Musically Florence and the Machine's sound is generally referred to as soul-inspired indie rock. Florence and the Machine's music has received praise across the music media, especially from the BBC who played a large part in Florence and the Machine's rise to prominence by promoting her as part of BBC Introducing.[1] This led to the band playing at a number of music festivals in 2008, including Glastonbury as well as Reading and Leeds and T in the Park. The band's debut album, Lungs was released on 6 July 2009, and held the number 2 position for its first five weeks in the charts, behind Michael Jackson.[2] The album has now been in the top 40 UK charts for 22 consecutive weeks.
