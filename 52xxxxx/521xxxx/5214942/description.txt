This torrent contains:

- original Hexen 2 campaign
- the "Portal Of Praevus" expansion
- patch v1.11 (in case you want the game updated, but not install Portal Of Praevus)
- UQE Hexen 2 v1.13
- Hammer Of Thyrion v1.4.3
- Hexen 2 OST

For a full installation, there is a rar file that contains cd images of Hexen 2. After you install Hexen 2, Install the expansion pack, Portal Of Praevus. You can find cd images for that in another rar file. After you've done that you can play the game as it is or you can install either UQE Hexen 2 v1.13 or Hammer Of Thyrion v1.4.3 to enhance the game graphics. Choose only one of those though as they won't work together and then check the instructions for each of them (they are packed in their rars). If you're having trouble loading the cd images, get the latest version of Daemon Tools. It works fine loading the .ccd files.

As a side note, to play as the Demoness the original Hexen 2 campaign, start a new game in Portal Of Praevus, then bring out the console (press ~) and type "map demo1" (without the quotes).

Enjoy the game!



My internet speed isn't that great so uploading will be slow, but I'll keep seeding until more people get it. It would be great if you kept on seeding after you've downloaded, keeping the torrent alive.
