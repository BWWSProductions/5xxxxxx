PLOT:

Harpreet Singh Bedi (Ranbir Kapoor) has just graduated, and his marks are, well, let's say a little embarrassing. 
But marks never stopped him from dreaming of an exciting and adventurous career, and they never will. 'Rocket Singh -
 Salesman of the Year' is the sometimes thoughtless, sometimes thoughtful story of a fresh graduate trying to find a balance
 between the maddening demands of the 'professional' way, and the way of his heart - and stumbling upon a crazy way which 
turned his world upside down, and his career right side up. Welcome to the world of sales, boss!
