It is a texture pack which makes the graphics more realistic, at the expense of system performance."
,on0bi,2010-01-03T21:44Z,so...is taht all you have to do? put that override folder into dragon age/packages/core?
,on0bi,2010-01-03T21:55Z,"cuz nothing changes when i play the game after moving the folder, ""override"" to where it says to in the readme"
,Lavandel,2010-01-03T22:48Z,"Same here - Nothing happens and I can't find any logical place to put the files either.

Any ideas?"
,on0bi,2010-01-04T00:11Z,"@Lavandel

just use these instead. i searched some forums and found these links.

if you want to directly download these files, go here:
http://www.dragonagenexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=15

if you rather prefer a torrent, use this;
http://bitsnoop.com/torrent/4f197df8e620403b51f0e82c8918b1b1c6bd58f0/jbtex21.html

either way, definitely go to this forum:
http://www.eurogamer.net/forum_thread_posts.php?thread_id=167506"
,Lavandel,2010-01-04T17:08Z,"Alright.

After scouring through a few forums I found out that the files shouln't go to the game folder but to the ""My Documents"" folder with the same name.

With other words, a slight misunderstanding.

Thanks for the links, however, they helped me find the solution.
