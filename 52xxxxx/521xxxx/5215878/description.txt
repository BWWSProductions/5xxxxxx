           The story centers on Veronika, a woman in her mid              
           twenties who appears to have everything: good looks, good      
           job and a great life ahead of her. Yet she decides to end      
           her own life. She is unsuccessful and awakens in a mental      
           hospital where she learns that she a short time to live.       
           However in the hospital she meets people who are only          
           'insane' because they don't always follow society's            
           rules. With little left to lose, Veronika embarks on a         
           journey on which she frees herself to experience               
           relationships and emotions and ultimately discovers what       
           it means to live.
