Can't manage to download a server? Here is your chance.

This installfile will download the whole server for you, from Steam. After the server is download, you need to follow this guide to get your server started.

1. Create a shortcut of scrds
2. Take properties. 
3. Find path and write the following after the current line:

-console-game cstrike + map de_dust2 + maxplayers 12-port 27015-tick rate 33 

4. Save and close.

You must now start with the new shortcut.

The server will use about 500mb of your harddrive and it's a standalone version, which means you won't need Steam to run it.
