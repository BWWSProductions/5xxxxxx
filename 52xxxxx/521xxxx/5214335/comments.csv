,michelllehotshot,2009-12-15T14:47Z,"Is this a port of the PS2 game SvR 2006? I can't find anything online about it except a couple of  videos. There's nothing on THQs site about it either.

Also, what's the deal with the gibberish in the installer? It's not in English?"
,gatturamesh,2009-12-15T15:02Z,"yeah brother, of course it is not in english it is not released by THQ may be it is designed by someone i found in unknown website but  it is a nice update by the person. To install the software you have to click the second button that is the next button once the installation is over it will be in english. Try my other update WWE RAW LEGENDS it is also a cool one."
