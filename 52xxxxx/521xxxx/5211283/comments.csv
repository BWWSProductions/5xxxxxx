,XenoSilvano,2009-12-15T18:41Z,I hope this installation won't be a bad trip like 6.6.0.3

A rar file is a compressed file or files......you will need winrar or winzip to extract the files.

You may have to download and install one of these apps........once you have installed one of these apps.......just double click on the rar file and it will ask where to extract the files to......select a location and it will do the rest"
,XenoSilvano,2009-12-16T09:21Z,"Wow, I'm Impressed.  I had absolutely no issue with this download what so ever.

Many gracious thanks."
,leecar83,2009-12-16T09:49Z,Thanks. Works Great!
,Flytrap0,2009-12-20T13:27Z,"This is aweful... It worked once and told me that I have a 21 day trial... as soon as I applied the key, it told me that my trial has expired (so I never even got to use it once).

And oh, yes, my firewall was set to block all internet traffic... and just to make sure, I did unplug my network cable from my router.

This just sucks!"
,fredpc,2009-12-24T20:02Z,"Here is a step by step guide 
Anyone having an issue with..........anydvd ""trial expired"".........error 
1) Uninstalled the old version of anydvd 
2) Make sure your disconnected from the net
3) Install the new anydvd 
4) If it asks to reboot (do it )
5) When the computer restarts anydvd will load (you will get trial version) now close anydvd 
6) Add the key (which is usually a reg key)
7) Open anydvd and you should have a fully registered version 
8) If you get ""trial expired"" don't worry move on 
9) Do a search for anydvd.chk and delete it or rename it to anydvd.bak.......you will have to enable hidden files and folders the locations are as follows 

for xp the location is 
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\SlySoft\AnyDVD\AnyDVD.chk

for vista
C: Drive\Program Data\Slysoft\Anydvd\anydvd.chk or anydvd.key

for windows 7 the location is
C: Drive\Program Data\Slysoft\Anydvd\anydvd.chk or anydvd.key

10) Now open anydvd you should have a fully registered version while your there go to settings and disable updates 
11) You can now reconnect to the net
12) Enjoy

Ps there is another option with the anydvd.chk file 
Open with notepad and delete all text and then save....then right click on the file and select properties and select read only....then apply "
,redraider1959,2009-12-27T16:52Z,Worked great after I changed the chk file. Thanks
,gplayer01,2010-01-01T01:02Z,"THX aoloffline!! 

This was a battle to get working on Windows 7 ONLY because of my wireless connection. 

Actually, the 1st time around it worked perfectly until I rebooted and it connected before I could uncheck in settings ""Automatically check for new version"". So I uninstalled, reinstalled, tried a different version, then came back to this one again but totally unplugged the power of my wireless router.

TIP: Best to unplug your routers, cables, whatever. Then follow fredpc instructions (thx fredpc). 

I think the key is removing all the data in the anydvd.chk file:
--------------SNIP------------
Ps there is another option with the anydvd.chk file
Open with notepad and delete all text and then save....then right click on the file and select properties and select read only....then apply
--------------END SNIP------------

I also added a rule in the firewall for anydvd.exe to not allow any connection.

I reconnected my wireless and AnyDVD still works and all looks good. No Trial Period warning.

Good Luck and Happy New Year!!"
,Copurnicus,2010-01-24T00:02Z,"I Think i can help everyone with this .chk file. I noticed a lot of people keep saying they either
A) don't have or find the anydvd.chk file 
B) don't know how to enable view all files including hidden

if you are B) and have windows 7 this is how to enable it:
http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial151.html

Now, if you are A) and you can't find it this should do it. I noticed being a guy that rushes to get programs like this installed I dont' read the directions clear enough. If you notice what fredpc wrote for locating the file its in PROGRAM DATA. I know that the first million times i kept doing it like an idiot I would go C:Program Files/ and then into the anydvd folder but  you won't find it in there. 

First enable it so that you can see all hidden files and folders (using the link above if you don't know how) then go back to c: and there should be a folder called Program Data. from there go to the anydvd folder like you'd normally do and you SHOULD see the anydvd.chk. 

Now go ahead and rename it anydvd.bak and load anydvd again and it should work fine. 

Let me know if this helps"
