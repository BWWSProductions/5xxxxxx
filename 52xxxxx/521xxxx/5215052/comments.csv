,BasilBrush,2009-12-13T19:46Z,"I got the idea of using 1024x576 MP4 after seeing the torrents on NRK:

http://nrkbeta.no/2008/01/29/norwegian-broadcasting-nrk-makes-popular-series-available-drm-free-via-bittorrent/

They use PDTV 2800Kbps which is ideal for playback at a frame size of 1280x720.

The 1024x576 is much better than those small Xvid files. Xvid is good but x264 is even better.

Eurosport transmit a frame size of 544x576 so the horizontal axis is stretched by 1024/544 or 1.8824 to give the correct aspect ratio."
