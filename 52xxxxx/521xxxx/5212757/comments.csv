Such a shame that the Kamen Rider saga has come to this, it was way better back in the old days when everything was still strictly Japanese, with Japanese actors and the Japanese opening music. Nowadays itÂ´s more like a 20 minute long add for Hasbro and such to make your kids yell the crap outta ya into buying their crap. "
