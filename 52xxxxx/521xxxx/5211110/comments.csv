,millertek,2009-12-19T04:12Z,"Excellent for basic Garmin users.  I SIMPLY renamed this file to gmapprom.img, and overwrote the gmapprom.img on my Garmin device.  When you reboot the device and check the map info - 2010.30 appears as the version and it's already activated and ready to work.  No compiling, no cracking, no updating, no hassles.

Verification?  Well, my original 2010.20 img file was slightly smaller in size (approx 20,000kb) compared to this newer 2010.30 - so as to what was updated - no idea, but something has been added.   

Hav fun!!!!!"

,pond9,2010-07-19T10:07Z,"@Mcnab2002

just rename old file gmapprom.img in your nuvi 1490T at /.system/ directory to gmapprom.img.bak or the other name, and copy this file instead, rename it to gammpprom.img or gmapprom1.img or gmapsupp.img or gmapoem.ing

?best wish !!!"
