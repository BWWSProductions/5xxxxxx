Around the World in Eighty Days is a classic adventure novel by the French writer Jules Verne, first published in 1873. In the story, Phileas Fogg of London and his newly employed French valet Passepartout attempt to circumnavigate the world in 80 days on a Â£20,000 wager set by his friends at the Reform Club.


Narrator - Jim Dale MBE (born 15 August 1935) is an English actor, voice artist, singer and songwriter. He is best known in the United Kingdom for his many appearances in the Carry On series of films and is known in the US for narrating the Harry Potter audiobook series, for which he received two Grammy Awards, and the ABC series Pushing Daisies.

To millions of fans in the United States and Canada, Jim Dale is the "voice" of Harry Potter. (In Britain the audiobooks are produced by Bloomsbury, and Stephen Fry reads them.) He has recorded all seven books in the Harry Potter series, and as a narrator he has won two Grammy Awards, seven Grammy Nominations and a record ten Audie Awards including "Audio Book of the Year 2004," "Best Children's Narrator 2001/2005/2007/2008," "Best Children's Audio Book 2005," two Benjamin Franklin Awards from the Independent Book Publishers Association (one of these was in 2001 for Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban]) and eleven Audio File Earphone Awards. He is also the narrator for the Harry Potter video games, and for many of the interactive "extras" on the Harry Potter DVD releases. He also holds two Guinness World Records: one for having created and recorded 146 different character voices for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and one for occupying the first six places in the Top Ten Audio Books of America and Canada 2005.

Dale also did voice work for the Walgreens "perfect" ads.


UPLOADER'S NOTE - Surprisingly, no quality torrent of an unabridged commercial copy seems to have been uploaded until now. There is, of course, a good quality free version from the splendid folks at http://librivox.org/, but it doesn't measure up to this. Beyond Jim Dale's incomparable voice, there are also sound effects and geographically correct music from around the world, in order to better set the tone and mood. I have chosen to rip at 64 kbps to save space and keep the files small enough to stay seeded. If there is sufficient demand for a higher bit rate, I can also do that.
