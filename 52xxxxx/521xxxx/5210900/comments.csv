Although the download is going very slowly for some reason - it's usually much faster..."
,Spartanus,2009-12-12T13:37Z,"PS Please upload the cross-country races later today - for a lot of people, including me, you are the only source for those (unlike biathlon)."
,BasilBrush,2009-12-12T16:57Z,This one is quite big. I've noticed that my share ratio reaches 200% (which means I'm having to dish out pieces twice) before the first downloader reaches 100%. If people are downloading or uploading other torrents then it just slows down the rate at which I can dish out files. My share ratio is currently 250% and there still only 5 seeders.
,Spartanus,2009-12-12T17:23Z,"Well, I'm slowly downloading the biathlon races and waiting for the cross-country ones. :) I will turn off all my other uploads and downloads when that is out!"
