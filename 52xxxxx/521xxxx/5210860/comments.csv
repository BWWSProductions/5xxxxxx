You should ALWAYS keep it in the original rar's.

I cannot understand the fucktard who unzipped this one and then uploaded it. I feel bad for DEViSE, since the original torrent both came with sample and in rars."
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2009-12-30T01:40Z,"Thanks for the advice....but still is the same release at the same quality...and with some chances to stay some more time on HDD with ...no rar files !!!

It was my choice: with enough seeders it will be fast enough!!! There are so many other trustfull uploaders of no rars-movies and nobody is comenting them negative !!! [It's because of the purple or green or blue skull ??? I hope not !]


And keep your dirty language for your psichyatrist: you could be cured ... some how...sometime !!! [Coprolalia, maybe Tourette syndrome....see Wikipedia]"
