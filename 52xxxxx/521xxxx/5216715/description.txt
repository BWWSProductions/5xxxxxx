
[Christmas] Harry Simeone Chorale - The Little Drummer Boy - [CDRip - flac]


When 20th Century Fox Records contracted Simeone to make a Christmas album in 1958, he assembled the Harry Simeone Chorale and searched for recording material. After being introduced to an obscure song by friend and credited song co-author Henry Onorati titled "Carol of the Drum", Simeone recorded the tune as "The Little Drummer Boy" for his album Sing We Now of Christmas. He received co-writing credit on the album, although he did not actually compose the song. The "Little Drummer Boy" single quickly became enormously popular and stayed on the U.S. music charts from 1958 to 1962. The Simeone Chorale had another Christmas hit in 1962, with their rendition of the then-new song "Do You Hear What I Hear?".
