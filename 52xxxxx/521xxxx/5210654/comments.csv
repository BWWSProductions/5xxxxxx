,Jackc6900,2009-12-12T03:49Z,"Hey Bricktop, been following your movies for awhile now, more heavily on demoniod before it went down. Just wanted to say thanks for all your hard work! Just so I got everyone down is this the current list of PS3 Team members:

You
Akamura
Frenchyd
Suavecito
Zax

Anyone I'm missing? Also, if you have access to the first twilight or the newest Harry Potter those would be awesome. My lady has been bugging me for either of those and haven't seen them upped yet. Thanks again!"
,XAlucarDX454,2009-12-12T06:44Z,"can you do ""1988 - above the law starring steven seagal"" PLZ BT PLZZ!!!!"
,Hackurs,2009-12-12T07:08Z,"Hey Brick, a long time ago, when we were both on Demonoid, you taught me your method for making rips, and I've been using it to make my own personal collection. As a thank you, I'd like to offer you my services, if you need another body to do the grunt work, and if you wish, I can upload a bunch of mine as well or send them to you or whatever. Hit me up if you want a list, I'm at about 150-200 titles converted this way, or if you have some work for me to do."
[T],bricktophd,2009-12-13T00:38Z,hackurus that would be great if wanted to upload the more uploaders the better.
,Hackurs,2009-12-13T02:09Z,"You've got it, sir. I'm assembling my new dedicated media server this next week, and I'll up my internet connection as well. May I use your info slide as well? Don't want to without your permission."
,Hackurs,2009-12-13T02:11Z,"Also, one more quick question. What preset size do you set it for?? I put 4000 MB, and it comes out at 3.90 GB apparent file size."
,john5246,2009-12-13T04:09Z,"Guys I don't understand how you can have 1080p and have it be blu-ray quality at 4GB???

Does this rip have a low bit rate compared to blu-ray rips? "
,Mr.noGay,2009-12-13T07:15Z,"waiting for ""cloudy with a chance of meatballs"". when it comes to animated movies, i always prefer PS3-TEAM. 
thanx n Keep up the good work. "

,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-03-20T11:12Z,why this file is smaller compare with other 1080p of this movie?does the fps change  ? or the quality of fast parts of the movie ?
,drkblz,2010-05-29T19:29Z,"It's probably smaller due to the file type. I had Star Trek in 1080 on a m2ts file, and it was 2.1 or so gigs. Works great on VLC, and I imagine on PS3s."
