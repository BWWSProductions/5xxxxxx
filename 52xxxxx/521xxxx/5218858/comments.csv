,stewman65,2009-12-15T18:40Z,I can't read all the information on these web pages at thepiratebay. The banners on the sides seem to be covering the words on the edges. I can copy and paste the info into a word document to read but is there a setting that I can change to enable me to read all the words such as amount of Seeders/Leechers and also comments and descriptions. Thanks
,yoriver,2009-12-15T20:05Z,Thank you!!!!
