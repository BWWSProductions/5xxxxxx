              database, or synchronize your database model with   
              the database to keep your design up to date.

              of your database?                                   
              ModelRight has more complete and in-depth support

              your database design with ModelRight.               
                                                                  
              Whether you are creating a new database             
              application or need to manage an existing           
              database, you would benefit from ModelRight. It     
              will help you to visualize and manage the           
              complexity of your database and create a solid      
              database design.                                    
                                                                  
              If you have an existing database, ModelRight can    
              Reverse Engineer it to give you a graphical view    
              of it. You can then use our Database Compare        
              feature to display changes that you've made in      
              your model and to push those changes to the         
              database via ALTER scripts.                         
                                                                  
              If you want to create a new database, you can       
              create it graphically with ModelRight - and then    
              automatically generate the necessary SQL DDL.       
                                                                  
              Various User Interface windows work together to     
              provide an intuitive and natural design             
              environment. With a mode-less and hyperlinked       
              user interface, editing and navigating the data     
              model is intuitive and easy.                        
                                                                  
              You wouldn't want to have to endlessly pop up       
              dialogs to edit a document, so why would you want   
              to edit your data model that way? With              
              ModelRight, you don't have to. Simply select the    
              object you want to edit and change its properties   
              in the Property Browser. Its a common               
              User-Interface design that provides better          
              overall ease of use, but only ModelRight makes it   
              available in a data modeling tool.                  
                                                                  
              And with unlimited Undo, you don't need to worry    
              about making a mistake - you can always undo it.    
              Use the Transaction History window to view the      
              full impact of any changes you make.                
              The Diagram drawing capabilities are advanced and   
              full featured - allowing you to make your models    
              look great!
