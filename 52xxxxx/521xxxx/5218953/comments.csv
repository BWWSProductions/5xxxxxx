[T],metalcore.,2009-12-16T20:16Z,"its all good actually, my bad"
,jzenman,2009-12-27T00:31Z,So does anyone know if this is how the original one ended on the History Channel? It doesn't seem complete. Wasn't Springsteen supposed to be on this? 
,jzenman,2009-12-27T00:38Z,"I looked on Wikipedia and there's a page for The People Speak and it's supposed to have Sean Penn and Bruce Springsteen. Come on History buffs we can do better than this... There has to be an intellectual leftist out there who knows how to steal, rip and upload the WHOLE program without the commercials and keep the audio matched with the video. I can do it for fuck sake but I need a goddam copy. I'll see if I can get one. I've looked all over and can't seem to find a good copy of this. "
