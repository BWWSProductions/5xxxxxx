,jaydog912,2009-12-13T21:32Z,We need a seed. TvTeam is usually very good at seeding there torrents. I just wanted to let them know that there are almost 900 leechers and no seeds. 
[V],TvTeam,2009-12-13T22:02Z,"Sorry, there was a small problem. seed coming now =)"
,jaydog912,2009-12-13T23:06Z,"Thanks for all your work(TvTeam), and responding to my inquiry. You guy/girls are doing a good job at getting torrents on here faster than anyone else. Just Wanted say Thanks, and keep it up. Do you have a website?"
[V],TvTeam,2009-12-13T23:15Z,"jaydog912, ur welcome."
[V],TvTeam,2009-12-13T23:49Z,"MrGundIsMyBitch, you are paranoid.

TPB is having a function: ""Files""

For example, this torrent have: Files: 101

Click on 101 Files, you will see all the content of this torrent.

How on earth this torrent doesn't have even rar files when there are 101 rar files inside for CD1 and CD2 ?

Use ""Files"" function all the time before leaving comments like that."
[V],TvTeam,2009-12-14T00:24Z,"MrGundIsMyBitch, okay, i get ur point now.

I thought you were downloading this one. :P"

This is a minor repack that removes commercials from  59m 19s to 61m 42s."
,iMoNsT3r,2009-12-15T13:30Z,"knockx2, shut up, you're an idiot. i don't like downloading torrents that don't work. it takes up my bandwidth that i can use for other shit. have to find a new torrent that works and wait for that to d/l after i figure out the first piece of shit didn't work. it's free, but that doesn't mean we give up all our rights as human beings by downloading it. if it's a shit torrent, i'll complain and bitch as much as i damn well please. thanks for the repack, don't fuck up next time."
,iMoNsT3r,2009-12-15T23:40Z,This torrent blows.
,iMoNsT3r,2009-12-16T08:08Z,"Shut your face, faggot."
