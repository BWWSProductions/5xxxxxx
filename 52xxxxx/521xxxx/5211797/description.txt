Girton College, Cambridge 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girton_College,_Cambridge

A recording of diverse choral and organ music, on a Christmas theme.  The recording quality is not the best (local sound production, I think) but perfectly respectable, and the choir itself is clearly very good.  There are more recent recordings by this choir of better sound quality.  

Blurb from the College site: "Girton College Chapel Choir began recording in 1995 with â€˜All in a Garden Greenâ€™, and since then has added a further five CDs to its name. A seventh, a programme of sacred and profane music from nineteenth-century England, is about to be released. The choir has also broadcast on BBC and on radio and television stations overseas (including Radio Hong Kong, Radio Thailand, Malaysian Television and various Japanese networks)."
