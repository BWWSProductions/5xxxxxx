,jzenman,2009-12-27T00:21Z,Yeah... What he said... This has commercials and it's not even the whole thing... 
,jzenman,2009-12-28T04:38Z,The People Speak DVD is out now but not on the shelf for some reason. (Too radical maybe?) It's supposed to have Springsteen and Sean Penn so this is not the full version. I watched this and it has commercials and it's ends too soon. Someone needs to rip the DVD and upload it for The People.  
,moviemonkez,2010-01-16T16:01Z,Thanks for keeping this up! Venceremos!
