,mcclink,2010-01-31T15:52Z,Please sees. Fair few stuck on 98.8%
,twangling_jack,2010-05-05T21:24Z,"Yeah, it's not quite complete enough to play. "
,twangling_jack,2010-05-06T00:59Z,I don't suppose there's anyway someone is able to rip this from their own collection and finish it off? 98.8% is just too close to being done to simply abandon. I wasted enough bandwidth as it is trying to get it before the single seeder simply disappeared.
