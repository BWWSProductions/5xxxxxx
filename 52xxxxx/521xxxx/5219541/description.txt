Version 3.91

   1. This version can decompress 7-Zip archives created with
      LZMA2 algorithm.

   2. Now a password is requested only once when unpacking 7z archives
      with encrypted file names from context menu. WinRAR 3.90 asked it
      twice.

   3. This version can unpack tar.bz2 archives consisting of several
      smaller bz2 streams merged together. Previous versions unpacked
      only the first nested bz2 stream in such composite archive.

   4. WinRAR displays CRC32 of files inside of usual .gz (not .tar.gz)
      archives. Previous versions left this field blank for GZIP files.

   5. Bugs fixed:

      a) WinRAR 3.90 displayed "Save" button instead of "Open" or "OK"
         in "Find archive" dialog ("Open archive" command in "File" menu
         and "Browse..." command in archiving dialog);

      b) WinRAR could display incorrect file names when browsing malformed
         ZIP archives;

      c) WinRAR 3.90 failed to decompress LZH archives created with
         "-lh7-" algorithm;

      d) WinRAR 3.90 could fail to delete a part of files after archiving
         if delete to Recycle Bin was enabled. This bug was present
         when working in Windows XP, but not in Windows Vista and Windows 7;

      e) when unpacking ISO file using WinRAR "Extract files..." command
         in Explorer context menu, WinRAR could unpack same archived files
         twice during the same operation. It displayed the overwrite prompt
         when unpacking files for the second time;

      f) hexadecimal search in WinRAR 3.90 "Find" command and console RAR
         "ih" command failed to find matches if first byte in search string
         was greater than 127.
