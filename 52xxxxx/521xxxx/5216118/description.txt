This one requires some explanation, so bear with me.

As most die-hard Meat Loaf fans already know, the Jim Steinman album "Bad For Good" was originally titled "Renegade Angel" and was intended to be the follow up to "Bat Out Of Hell". Despite the fact that things didn't end up going as planned, during the following years Meat Loaf ended up recording all but two of the songs from "Bad For Good" on various albums (including the eventual "Bat Out Of Hell II").

So in an attempt to create the feel of the never realised "Renegade Angel", I collected and arranged all of the "Bad For Good" songs that Meat Loaf recorded (as well as the 2 original Jim Steinman ones), created a new album cover (in which I gave Jim Steinman a higher billing) and uploaded it for you.

ATTENTION - THIS DOES NOT CONTAIN NEW RECORDINGS!

Here is a list of the (Meat Loaf performed) songs and the albums on which they appear:

Bad For Good                                 Bat Out Of Hell 3
Out Of The Frying Pan (& Into The Fire)      Bat Out Of Hell 2
Lost Boys & Golden Girls                     Bat Out Of Hell 2
Surf's Up                                    Bad Attitude
Left In The Dark                             Welcome To The Neighborhood
Rock & Roll Dreams Come Through              Bat Out Of Hell 2

I'm keen to know what people think of the cover art, so don't be afraid to leave a comment.
