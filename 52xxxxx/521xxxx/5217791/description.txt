I've created this torrent mainly to increase our membership.

As we've only just started we currently have very few members and obviously we want to expand  

So here's what to do after downloading the torrent:

1. Unpack InstalWoW.rar file.
2. Run InstalWoW.exe.
3. Pick WoW + BC + WotLK
4. Download the game.
5. Download patches from here http://a.wirebrain.de/wow/ our game version is 3.2.2a . Or use the Launcher.exe, be aware if you do use the Launcher that you must stop patching at 3.2.2a .
6. Visit our forums at http://garvey.netai.net/phpBB3/index.php to register a forum account
7. Once you have a forum account, read the rules, then create an introduction topic in the Welcome forum, this will enable you to see the
game account creation link.
8. Replace World of Warcraft/Data/enGB/realmlist.wtf file with the one included.
9. Run game using wow.exe (don`t use launcher.exe!) 

See you in game :)
Have fun.

The only reason we've set things up like they are in Step 7 is that we want our members to become a part of our community, rather than just joining up to play the game and not interacting.

Also if you've already got WoW feel free to sign up to the forums and create a game account. Just be sure to read the rules
