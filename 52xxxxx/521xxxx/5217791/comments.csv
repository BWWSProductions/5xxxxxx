,SmashBro722,2010-06-09T08:58Z,"I guess I'm the only one here having a lot of trouble. I've done everything the way you said, and then I made an account on your website. But, it still won't let me login; it keeps saying my account isn't validated, and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. Please respond, this took me forever and it's starting to piss me off."
,tongurj,2010-08-05T21:21Z,@SmashBro722 that shit happened to me before but now it works i think its because im using my email address to login
,tongurj,2010-08-05T23:21Z,i dont think this is going to work so i wont make a forum account just yet but if it does work ill tell you and make a forum account
,tongurj,2010-08-05T23:47Z,"im not sure if this is going to work or if im able/assed to figure out so im not going to make an account on the forums just yet, when and if it does work i will make an account on the forums"
