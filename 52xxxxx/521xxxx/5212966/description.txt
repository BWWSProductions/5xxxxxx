He's The World's Coolest Dad And He's Gonna Prove It.

Michael Keaton stars as a rock-'n'-roll father who gets a last chance to fine-tune his life - and prove ice guys finish first - in this merry family fable frosted with a blizzard of special effects! 

On the verge of making it big, long-struggling musician Jack Frost realizes he's missing something vital: time with his wife and young son Charlie. But before Jack can make up for lost time, he swerves off an icy mountain road. Then, one cold winter's night, Jack magically returns... as a snowman! He embarks on a riotous, snowball-chucking, snowboard-cruising quest to show Charlie that when it comes to being totally cool, there's no dad... like a snowdad!
