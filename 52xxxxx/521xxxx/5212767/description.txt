Development Books - Pack 1

This is a collection of books about:
- programming languages (C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, Php, Ruby, OpenGL, SDL, HTML, XML)
- games (design, programming and graphic)
- CAD

All the books are in PDF format, and the files have been separately compressed to .tar.gz, so that you can download just the ones you want.

I've collected these books through the net: some are easy to find, some are harder, some I've just downloaded, some I've fixed/added an index and the cover.

I hope you enjoy the books, and if you really like any of them, you could also buy the paper version :)

Note: this is "Pack 1" but I'm not planning to release a 2nd pack unless there are some specific requests or some books need to be fixed.
