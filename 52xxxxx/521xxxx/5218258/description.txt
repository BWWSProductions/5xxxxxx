BBC Alan Whicker's Journey of a Lifetime 2of4 DVDRip x264 576p AC3 MVGroup

Celebrating a remarkable fifty years on television, TV legend and undisputed travel king Alan Whicker sets off round the world on a journey reflecting his incredibly varied life and career.

Episode 2of4: California Dreaming
Whicker looks back at some of his most famous programmes, including the 1967 film that introduced 'hippies' to a bemused Britain and featured controversial sequences of drug-taking for the first time on British TV. He also revisits the openly gay church who invited him to one of their same-sex marriages thirty-five years before they became legally recognised, as well as the San Francisco cops who invited him to join them on patrol back in 1979. Also featured in this episode is the last ever interview with the late Peter Sellers.
