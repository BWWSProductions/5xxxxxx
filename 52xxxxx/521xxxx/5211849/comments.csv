,ReaL_BadMaN,2009-12-13T16:49Z,Early release man. This is not supposed to be released until February '10. Thanks.
,xaris13,2009-12-13T17:37Z,can someone confirm??
,eucanlickthis,2009-12-13T19:20Z,"The game is wave 3, so no wave patching is needed (game has already been released in october in Japan if you were wondering why it's not wave 4). ABGX cannot verify stealth yet, 1 .ini file and 1 .crc file cannot be found in the online database, so the game can probably not be made stealth yet"
,_sinner_,2009-12-14T04:40Z,come on and seed bitches!!
,bjs123,2009-12-14T11:34Z,"it works thx, nice game , no activation disc needed! "
,bjs123,2009-12-14T11:38Z,"now that my xbox is banned i don't have 2 check iso's and wait till release dates, it's actually nice, fuck xbox live and ms. i do all my online play on the pc and ps3. xbox is just for downloading games and play single player."
,modxbox3pro60,2009-12-15T14:38Z,"If anyone needs their xbox 360 professionally modded, let me know. (New stealth firmware coming soon!)"
,ShinoBoy,2009-12-15T19:03Z,Is this in English? And is it region-free?  Please confirm
,bjs123,2009-12-15T20:54Z,yes its region free and yes it's in english
,ShinoBoy,2009-12-16T00:38Z,"Thanks....surprising, as this isn't out until the end of January.  Kinda silly to ask, but can someone confirm that this is real and working?"
,bjs123,2009-12-16T16:24Z,shinoboy ffs can you read? turd
,cimexius,2009-12-16T17:12Z,"I have trouble playing the game, the XBOX can find it and all but when I try to start the game the screen just goes black. Does anyone else have the same problem? I have a modded xbox that has played both 3rd wave games and 4th wave (with activate disc)"
,ErikssonfluM,2009-12-18T00:30Z,Please seed guys! I'm downloading in 10 kb/s :(
,helpfuld,2009-12-18T09:21Z,"I keep getting the dreaded disc read error (please wipe disc) during the game intro,... is anyone else getting this?... or can anyone advise how to resolve?... Im using Imgburn @ 2.4x on Verbs. Never had issues before,.... Strange!!!!"
,helpfuld,2009-12-18T09:35Z,"Also tried installing to hard drive,... Gets to 97% then fails!"
,helpfuld,2009-12-18T10:49Z,For some reason attempt number 3 is working ok. Maybe just some dodgy discs in my pack. All seems ok now. Thanx AiTB!!!!!!!
,agilemurder187,2009-12-23T16:35Z,Game comes out end of january ok might be quicker to just buy it then download it 20 hours and ive got 8% and running at 7 kbs shite!!!!
,ozi1989,2009-12-29T23:48Z,"DAAMNN!! so much wanted to play that and have the same issue (wipe your disc) 
plzz can anyone solve it?"
,pureshadow,2009-12-31T01:29Z,"@agilemurder187

Don't know how fast you're internet is, but mine's supposed to be 10Mb/s and i've downloaded it with 3 other BIG torrents.
It took about 3 to 5 days form me to download it.

haven't played it yet, waiting for the official releasedate and verify on ABGX360"
,goona4life,2010-01-04T14:54Z,"good game, works great, no activation needed! yay! thanks AiTB"
,eelix,2010-01-07T14:19Z,"I am having the same problem as helpfuld and ozi1989. A small gray rectangle appears on the center of a black screen just as the game is starting up and the clean disk error pops up. 

I have tried burning it three times, admittedly all with clonecd 5.3.0.1, twice on 2.4x and once on 1x all three onto 2.4x Verbatim (the same disks I have used many times before). All games previous to this have worked. 

Can anyone give me a hint what might be worth trying? It is definitely Wave 3 isn't it? Maybe trying a different burning program could work? "
,Smuggles,2010-01-09T12:06Z,"This is strange I've tried abgx360 on all three top Bayonetta torrents, they're all region free and seem to be working perfectly. the only drawback is that none of them can be stealth patched, abgx360 doesn't find them in the online database...so i don't know if i would recommend playing this on live or offline if you intend to plug your cable back in afterwards....I'm gonna wait a little myself and see if eventually it stealth patches."
,kontrabida,2010-01-14T20:34Z,"i have the same problem at first ""wipe the disc error"" and blank screen, no success after 2 tries then i used the latest xbox backup creator it will set imgburn option automatically, now it's working great..."
,six12,2010-01-20T16:48Z,"Can confirm this is 100% working. Around half way through the game, no problems for now."
,maj001,2010-01-26T23:46Z,"Please seed, this shits dling at 25kbps and I can easily get 10x that!"
,maj001,2010-01-29T16:47Z,"Confirmed, works 100%, burned with imgburn at 2x speed, using verbatim 2.4x disc. Great rip, thanks AiTB!"
,youness1052,2010-01-30T15:59Z,"i have the same issue like """"cimexius"""" my screen turn black after 3 seconds from booting game.

please if anybody find solution for this issue 

thanks for uploader and for you guys."
,-BeSerK-,2010-02-14T11:26Z,Got the same problem that I have with burning Wolfenstein...somehow it puts a blank circle (in the middle) at the disc during the burning process. (cloneCD)...result: console isnt able to read the dvd....firmware is upto date (Iextreme LT)
,-BeSerK-,2010-02-20T18:48Z,"Re: prev message, seems it was a disc thing (bad Verbatim), anyway...working 100% now - thx"
,xchillin,2010-03-17T18:20Z,I can't find any Torrents for this game that are advertised as Region Free. This is the only torrent I can find available. Will this game play on an ixtreme LT flashed Lite-on drive NTSC Xbox 360? Does anybody know?
,balacaxana,2010-10-24T13:47Z,Works on NTSC?
,remedy2,2010-11-16T03:22Z,"Thanks- can confirm this passes abgx and works perfect on US NTSC ixtreme 1.61
"
,remedy2,2010-11-16T03:37Z,FYI-  everyone having trouble burning these just use imgburn and select the DVD file when burning.  I have always used imgburn and haven't had 1 coaster yet (even when I'm running a million things in the background while burning).  Absolutely the best burning software out there IMO.
,IMonkeyMagicI,2010-12-18T12:35Z,"Downloaded at 300kbs avg

abgx loved it, so im burning it now

cheers seeders and AiTB"
