,damorph,2009-12-17T21:13Z,Does seem a tad small hey? LOL
,Bob_Oblaw,2009-12-21T08:05Z,Hey will this fit on a 3.5 floppy disk?  Because I keep all my flight sim addon's on either a 3.5 or 8-inch disks...and I think this is too large for the 8.
,damorph,2009-12-21T17:35Z,Try punch cards as storage - it's a breeze! LOL
