You add nothing to this site, just insult people with your self important, over inflated, self appreciating mega ego.
Well guess what the only person you are impressing is you. Fine if someone gives you grief, then give it back, but stop spoiling for an intellectual battle, as there is always some bigger boy out there waiting to kick your ass!

You could actually make literature out of this stuff! All the critics of the internet say, ""it is ruining peoples' ability to socially interact.""

You need to install either the CCCP or the K-Lite codec pack (but not both) in order for a Microsoft Windows machine to be able to properly play the AVI format video files you download from the Internet.

Microsoft Windows does not come with the proper codecs installed."

As it is, these codecs are old. The uploader could have gotten even better quality in a file of 600MB or smaller.

Axxo was years ago. That method is OLD now. move on people. 

Quality is decent if you are stuck in 2005."

,Digginit64,2009-12-31T01:44Z,"Good movie.  A=9 V=9

However, after I downloaded this flick, just 3 days ago, I got a call from my isp today.  They had been contacted by someone, apparently from the movie producers, and my isp warned me to remove the flick from my computer immediately, or my account would be suspended tomorrow.  First time thats ever happened to me.  I always figured they would be too busy to bother with some individual like me.  Not as if I am making bootleg copies to sell, and I admit, I only leach until there are enough seeders to make me feel relatively safe among them.  I had not even begun to seed this yet.

Careful peeps.. someone is definitely watching."

,EbilPhish,2010-01-18T18:07Z,"Changing your DNS will have no effect on the legal notices. All DNS does is it converts a domain name into an ip address, such as thepiratebay.org -> 194.71.107.15

This will only have an effect if an ISP is blocking thepiratebay on their DNS (which is the most common way to block a torrent site).

It will NOT stop a monitoring bot from finding your ip in a torrent swarm, nor will it magically somehow stop your ISP from pulling the plug on your internet.

With that said, OpenDNS (which are the servers the above post mentioned) are worth checking out for other reasons (although you need local servers or your browsing speed may suffer).

You might want to look at an IP blocklist that tries to block the monitoring bots (it's not %100 effective but university studies have shown a massive improvement when using them)"
