I replaced each file manually, because I'm stupid and I'm not sure how to overwrite those files directly...also because I wasn't sure if I wanted to completely lose the old ones. Aaanyway, that COULD be the cause of my problem, but might now be...the problem is that about five minutes into arriving at Jakob's Cove, regardless of my activities there, the program and seemingly my whole computer freezes, playing the last half second of audio over and over while the screen goes black (""I am a friend of david-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d,"" like that). It doesn't happen in any other location, even after ten or so minutes of active play, and changing my graphics settings doesn't seem to affect it. HALP?"

This is not accurate - even on the steam store it warns that it comes with SecuRom version five, and Borderlands doesn't run through steam's systems but rather Gamespy's - VAC doesn't come into the equation at any point."

,SubGum,2009-12-24T07:12Z,"Works perfectly.  I really don't understand how so many people struggle to follow simple directions.

Btw, I used iZarc to extract and overwrite the files of my installed Razor1911 release that I'd patched to v1.10.

Tried playing online and I timeout before connecting to any servers, so that's too bad. Anyone had any better luck with this one?"
,Mystech,2009-12-24T22:05Z,"SubGum - timing out whenever you try to connect to a server is pretty much par for the course for this game. Even legal retail versions have that issue.

What you need to do is find the ports the game uses either on the steam forums or gearbox forums and forward those in your router.  After you do that you may still have problems so here's a ridiculous fix that shouldn't work, but somehow does: Just start a singleplayer game, actually get into a map then back all the way out to the main menu and suddenly you should be able to join most games (so long as the host has his ports forwarded as well).

The going into a game and then backing out also fixes some issues where only a few servers will show up on the in game server browser if you happen to experience that as well.

It's a pretty buggy piece of shit when it comes to networking and Gearbox's priorities are all screwed up - releasing addon pacs with DRM before they even patch away these crippling network issues for the retail product."

,g1722,2009-12-27T08:52Z,"Hey guys, just a quick noob question, here. I'm a little new to this.  His instructions are unrar into the installation directory. I don't have anything marked specifically ""installation"" for this game that I can find. 

Would the ""installation directory""  be the My Documents>My Games>Borderlands path? 

Thanks for the help in advance."
,Mystech,2009-12-27T23:27Z,"@g1722
""Would the ""installation directory"" be the My Documents>My Games>Borderlands path?""

No, the game keeps some configuration files there (as many games do) but it's not the install directory (and yes that is needlessly complicated, no idea why game devs do it).  More than likely, so long as you didn't change it before installing, your install Directory is something long the lines of C:\Program Files\Gearbox\Boarderlands  If you got it through steam though it'll be in steam's directory under something like C:\program files\steam\steam apps\common\boarderlands

Have fun exploring your file system! These are some pretty basic computing skills here, they'll come in handy for you again and again."

yes you will be able to play it online, even with a cracked copy of the game you can play it online, this isn't like games such as COD4 where you have to enter a registration key to install or play it online all you do is install the game (legit or not) and patch to the latest version, the only thing that will stop you from playing online is if you dont have a cracked .exe file to run the game and you encounter the insert CD error in which case either get the cracked exe from somewhere or if you bought the game insert your disk.

the game and game spy dont check anything to determine whether or not its a legit copy of the game or whether the DLC""s you have are legit it takes them at face value and passes them as legit. Unless you installed the DLC's incorrectly you can play them online with other people regardless of store-purchased, STEAM bought or cracked."

,imahaxyoo,2010-12-04T09:48Z,"Someone please help me! I have extracted the files and moved the DLC folder into ""willowgame/CookedPC/"" but when I go into a game NOTHING. I have also downloaded the 1.4.1 patch. Please help because my bandwidth its very low so I can't afford to go downloading everything!!!!

P.S. If it counts for anything at all I'm using the mac version and I am told the 'reloaded' DLC's work on the version I have. I can run the game smoothly but no trace of a DLC ingame. Helpeh!"
