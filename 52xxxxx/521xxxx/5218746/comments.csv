,oosit,2009-12-17T07:57Z," The WBZ release is the unrated version (ending with katie die, shot by the police,) but the JUMANJI release is the theatrical ending version (katie sniffing at Micah's lifeless body, then smiles at the camera before lunging toward it and the screen smash cuts to black and the credits roll). check imdb."
