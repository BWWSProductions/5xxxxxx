         PC Security Tweaker is a security  tweaking  utility  you   
         can   use   to tweak   Windows-based  computers.   It  is   
         compatible with all Windows versions and lets you control   
         which users are allowed to  access your PC  and the level   
         of access each user may have.  You can  choose  to  tweak   
         access   to  lots  of Control   Panel  applet  functions,   
         including Display, Network, Passwords, Printers,  System,   
         Add/Remove Programs,  etc.  You  can enforce users to use   
         separate system profile   folders  and provide them  with   
         their own  custom  shell  folders such  as Desktop, Start   
         Menu, Favorites, My Documents. Additionally, by tweaking,   
         you  can: disable selected  Start Menu items,  lock   and   
         protect  disk  drives in My Computer, disable the DOS and   
         command  prompt,  interruption  boot keys, real DOS mode,   
         Registry editing,  taskbar,  task   manager,  and network   
         access, hide  desktop icons,   and  much   more.  You can   
         password-protect  Windows  and restrict users  to running   
         specific   applications  only.   Security  tweaks  can be   
         applied  universally  or  just   to  specific users. This   
         software also lets you tweak Internet Explorer to  secure   
         web browsing.
