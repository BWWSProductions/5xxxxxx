,anonymous007,2009-12-18T22:59Z,good! thanks!
,zobale,2010-01-30T15:00Z,"Thanks very much Andronix1983.  This is a powerful software.  I downloaded BusinessProcessVisualArchitect 3.2 (20100115), and tried to use the key that you had uploaded.  It didn?t work!  It recognizes the key as valid for ?Visual Paradigm Suite 4.1? but still asks for the key.
I tried to download the Suite, but couldn?t.  One can download the individual products, but not the suite.
Any suggestions?
Many thanks,
Zobale"

,ssn637,2010-06-11T08:57Z,"Hi Andronix1983

Would it be possible to provide a lifetime license .zvpl file for Version 4.2?  You're the only one I know who can create a reliable license file for this suite.  "
