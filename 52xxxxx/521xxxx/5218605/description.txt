From Wiki:



Victor is a solo album by Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson under the name "Victor" which was released January 9, 1996 on Atlantic Records outside of Canada and Anthem Records within Canada. The album was recorded at Lerxst Sound (Lifeson's home studio) between October 1994 and July 1995.

The album reached #99 on the Billboard 200 in 1996.

Reportedly, a sequel titled Victor II was in the planning stages when Alex's fellow Rush bandmate, Neil Peart, went through his personal tragedies. The idea of the album was abandoned shortly after.

Victor received a 1997 Juno Award nomination for Best New Group. [/quote]
