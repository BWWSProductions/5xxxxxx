,BJDarter,2010-11-19T02:13Z,"I got every episode from numerous sources, but they ALL (including this post) have the same problem. They stop at episode 17-18 & list it as ""The Last One"". Unfortunately, 17-18 is ""The One With All The Other Ones"". I would love to find 19-20 ""The Last One"". It sucks to have every episode EXCEPT the series finale. To be fair, I didn't even bother downloading 17-18 from here. But prepare to be disappointed when you want to watch the finale & it's not there. "
,BJDarter,2010-11-19T07:39Z," I want to apologize & make a correction to my comment. When I checked the other sources I had used, it turns out with them that this IS episode 19-20 ... ""The Last One"" ... so it's episode 17-18 ""The One With All The Other Ones"" that they are missing. That's probably the case here as well. As I said earlier, I haven't downloaded this from here, so I'm really not sure. All I can say here for sure is there appears to be 2 episodes missing. I am sorry any confusion I caused. I really was trying to be helpful.  "
,JHD1995,2011-08-05T09:53Z,"Just to clarify; The season finale is here and is named ""1017-1018 The Last One"". BJDarter was referring to the montage episode which showed clips from various episodes - Montage episodes are specials, therefore should not be included as part of the series. Wikipedia and various other websites say that ""The Last One"" is episodes 17 and 18."
,JHD1995,2011-08-12T22:55Z,"10/10 for this - these episodes are uncut.
