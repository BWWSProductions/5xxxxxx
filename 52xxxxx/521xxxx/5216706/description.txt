When considering must-own holiday albums, Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" and Nat King Cole's "Christmas Album" are the obvious big-hitters. However, it would be foolish to overlook "A Christmas To Remember" - an album that never disappoints. A beautiful and ecclectic collection of holiday songs, A Christmas To Remember can satisfy, to steal a line from Nat King Cole, "Kids from one to ninety-two." From Pamela's magical renditions of "Up On The Housetop" and "Frosty The Snowman" to Max Kim's contributions on "Dancin' In A Winter Wonderland" and "Rock Around The Christmas Tree", these Christmas recordings truly warm the soul. The Swingin' Organs' whimsical "Christmas Polka" is an instant classic, and Atlanta Rhythm's "Jingle Bell Rock" is a delightful twist on the Bobby Helms classic. For a fitting ending, The Christmas Brass's take on "We Wish You A Merry Christmas" only leaves you wanting more. 

This album is a must-own for anyone who appreciates good holiday music, and the bountiful 25-track songlist makes it a bargain. Our family has this album on constant rotation during the holidays, and I highly recommend that you do the same.
