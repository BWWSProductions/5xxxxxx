This is the "Space Hulk in my pocket" print & play game variant of "Zombie in my pocket".

Games Workshop is on a trademark rampage and it's lawyers are banning everything deemed to infringe on ip/patent/copyright/trademark, including fun little homebrew games like this one. Seeding torent for a while as I want people to be able to play this cool print & play game.
