A down-on-his luck department store Santa (Art Carney) finds
a mysterious bag that gives out presents. With this bag he
sets out to fulfill his one wish - to see the less fortunate
inherit the bounties of Christmas.

Art Carney shows a great dramatic side and depth
which enhances this beyond the ordinary.

This is one of six episodes originally shot
on videotape, then transferred to
sixteen-millimeter film for broadcast.
This was done as a cost-cutting measure.

The fact that this was one of the six episodes
of the "Twilight Zone" that were recorded directly
onto videotape instead of film gives it that `live'
appearance and helps add to its validity as an icon
of the days of `good television.'

NIGHT OF THE MEEK is pure Serling.
