,123dutch,2009-12-13T21:25Z,I am trying to but it is slower than expected... but it WILL be there :)
,jotembi,2009-12-14T03:13Z,"OK, thx, got it!
impressive - both the dictionary and your work!
however, i was disappointed to find out that you skipped some pages for what might be called ideological reasons
as a professional linguist, i not only love dictionaries but also use them
your decision to skip parts of this one renders it pretty useless to people like myself
thanks anyway, though!"
,123dutch,2009-12-14T07:44Z,"Dear Jotembi,

It is true, some pages are missing. It was not my decision... this is how I got it myself of the internet.
I looked thouroughly to find a complete version but I was unsuccesful..."
,jotembi,2009-12-14T08:16Z,"ah well
in this case, sorry for putting the blame on you :)

after all, even without the pages that were removed for some silly reasons, this is a valuable addition to my library

conversion to .pdf took ages but was well worth it, the thing is now manageable ;)"

BUT, NO TABLE OF CONTENTS and ONLY 1 (of maybe 15 or 20) Index page!

Pics are in order & named in such a way so that U know what the contents of the page are...however, U'll have to manually search thru all the pages' names to find what UR looking for. :("

Disappointing quality.  "
