The Rhythm Messiahs' second high-volume mid-tempo trip-hop album: "Melody Method." More accessible than their first album, "American Power Projection," this new album, the second for 2009, features more synth-guitar based productions, and relies less on samples. A semi-conceptual album, paralleling stages on life's way, "Melody Method" jumpstarts with the funky "Super Sly Fly" featuring "musical jack in the box" sounds, and matures in the course of the album, as with the "daydreamy piano" in "Love At First Sigh," and on towards a concluding round of applause in the bass pounding "Dead Air." Although on the verge of "trip-pop" the album remains strange, even when hooking the ear.
