      The screen is divided into two areas.                                
                                                                           
      The left hand side contains a 3D animation to illustrate the         
      principle of the mechanism. The right hand side shows photos and     
      information about the mechanism. You can drag the central            
      dividing bar to change the size of the two areas.                    
                                                                           
      There are links (shown in blue) to reference sections and video      
      clips. You can click on the photos to see an enlarged view.
