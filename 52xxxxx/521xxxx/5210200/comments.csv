You are doing a great job good quality

Most appreciated"
,D3v0,2009-12-11T21:01Z,"1.59 GB is too small for 720p, and the film grain texture suffers because of it.
If it's not 4.37Gb or 8GB, its a waste of our time so please just don't bother posting this shit. "
,TheOriginalCoda,2009-12-11T22:52Z,"D3V0 it might have something to do with the fact that the movie is B+W. No colour info to encode = easier to compress.
I already have this in 1080p (8GB!) so I won't bother with this one."
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-11T23:03Z,"D3v0 can't you read son? It says BRRip !! That means Blu-ray Rip.Like hitman said,you obviously have shit for brains so don't bother posting again if you don't have any idea what you're talkin' about!"
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-12T01:55Z,Predator 2 will be done shortly.

,gunukhan,2009-12-16T18:14Z,dont know bout others but i had requested this one.thanks a lot uh.
,MakeItEasyForMe,2010-01-06T01:25Z,"I have downloaded a few Casablancas but none of them have the scenes from Paris (Dinners, Sam, Train Station Platform, German Guns) etc.  Does this one?  Can anyone point me to a torrent that does include it (in english)"
,MakeItEasyForMe,2010-01-06T20:53Z,"Well it seams that the purchasers of this Blue Ray DVD got ripped off - 1/4 of the movie is missing. The scenes from Paris (Dinners, Sam, Train Station Platform, German Guns) etc. are missing
Kris - It works great though  - Thanks"
,fatalideals,2010-01-26T02:20Z,It was Christmas morning when i saw your movie list. Unreal how many great movies you have already. You most definitely have the movie game in a choke-hold. Thanks for this and all your future releases. Blackman handshake and pat on back to you my friend
,mr.marchegianni,2010-03-17T14:06Z,s e e d  please
,rzainaddin,2011-02-26T23:07Z,"D3v0, Next time, it is better for you to go to somewhere and purchase original movie, better than bothering people here"
,testvcash,2011-03-10T03:39Z,"thank a lot kriss_kringle,

Can you upload Colorized BRRip of Casablanca. "
,Saki33,2012-03-06T15:25Z,"I don't think the comment that 1/4 of the film is missing on this rip is correct. According to IMDb the original length is 1:42 and the cut version is 1:22. I have downloaded this one and the length of this video is 1:42:34. It looks complete to me and while I have not yet watched it, I did find the Paris scenes.

Thanks very much, kriss_kringle."
