Application description
"Gameloft has completely spruced up all the original graphics making for a much more colorful and visually impressive game than the original." (TouchArcade)
"Taken alone, each city is larger than the entirety of the map used in Gangstar: West Coast Hustle; in other words, the game is gigantic." (PocketGamer.co.uk)
"Though Gameloft kept the seventies groove of the original Driver, the upgraded visuals are immediately noticeable. It's not just that car models and building architecture are cleaner. Gameloft gave Driver a fresh paint job" (IGN)
