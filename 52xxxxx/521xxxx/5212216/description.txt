Johannes Brahms (1833 â€“ 1897)

Joseph Joachim (1831 â€“ 1907) 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Joachim

This is a recording of Brahms' famous Hungarian Dances for piano(s), arranged for violin and piano by his friend, Joachim.  To fill the CD there is also included one of Joachim's own compositions.

It's another upload of music of a later date than I'd normally be interested in, however this is lovely stuff.  

Oh, and newsflash!  Hyperion is finally allowing CDs and individual tracks to be purchased (from their entire catalogue) in DRM-free FLAC and MP3 formats for a significant discount on the physical CD retail price.  Support them if you can.  Because of this stance I'll be releasing no other (or, few other, at any rate) Hyperion label CDs as torrents.
