,msdavey,2009-12-27T13:21Z,Thank you. Have been a fan of Skyhooks since the seventies. My cassette of Living in the Seventies has worn out. haven't found a copy to download anywhere so I am grateful.
,lordquilton,2011-01-05T06:49Z,Skyhooks was all but defunct by 1980; very much a seventies band for mine. Thanks uploader!

Thanks mate."
