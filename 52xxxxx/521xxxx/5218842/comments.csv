All 176 episodes, good quality and sound IMO. "
,mistiry,2009-12-20T21:35Z,"Uh oh! So, I was seeding this thing at 200kb+/sec when my computer died.

I am in the process of creating new torrents, broken down by season, to make it a little easier to download.

I'll post here when I have them up. Sorry to everyone who was downloading! I'll have them back up soon."
,LetsRockit01234,2010-01-03T04:15Z,I was wondering why I was stuck at 43.3% with 0.0kbs speed for the last two weeks... I hope you have it back soon...
,Shayden,2010-01-03T14:34Z,"Yeah im stuck aswell, please seed some, i know its a big file but cmon its only a month old or some thing. please peeps!"
,maconga,2010-01-12T03:50Z,"Lets try this, if you need/want more pieces.

This is going to seem 'abit' tricky, if you got a extra 65GB of hard drive space, create a exact copy of this torrent to

C:/torrent/Star Trek TNG 

Now....

Open utorrent, click Options then Preference, now click the Directory tab, now change the new downloads too ""C:/torrent/Star Trek TNG"" 
then add the other star trek torrents by this person. you MUST let it rescan, then just leave them all running (except this 65GB one) and hopefully, you will get more pieces. 

This will work, i do stuff like this to help bad torrents with people at like 60% and no seeds. "
,LetsRockit01234,2010-01-13T07:09Z,"well mistiry, are you going to get this torrent back on-line? we are hitting a wall in getting past 46.5%"
,switchboy,2010-02-11T22:47Z,Are these files the same as the seperate seasons?
,fox196743,2010-03-16T22:10Z,please people seed its for a good cause
,mistiry,2010-03-21T00:43Z,"Hey people I know its been a long time be a little patient with me I moved to a different city and am in the process of getting my network back up.

Sorry it has taken so long but I WILL get these out to everyone as soon as I can. I have not forgotten!"
,dbpvr,2010-05-29T12:39Z,"plese some one seed stuck at 81 %

or on a new tracker might help as well"
,dbpvr,2010-05-29T12:41Z,there only 73 peers no seeds using DHT
,dbpvr,2010-05-29T12:42Z,Everyone is stuck at 81 %
,maq23,2010-06-25T22:17Z,"Common people. I've downloaded 14.2GB over two weeks, and uploaded 11.5GB. "
,rilke,2011-01-16T07:52Z,"I hate to say this, but after ages of downloading these torrents, they're really not worth the blank dvd's. Season 1 was ok, but I'm at the end of season 2 and there have been way too many rip errors to count. It stops for awhile then starts moving again a few seconds later in a lot of places, and quite a few times there's coloured pixels on the screen and sound and everything stops. My dvd player has gotten upset at me a few times now from these rips. 

I own the real copies of seasons 5-7 so until I can afford the first 4 I wanted to have copies. I'll be trying another torrent of these seasons. Not sure if 3 and 4 are ok but 2 is definitely horrible.

Sorry  :("
