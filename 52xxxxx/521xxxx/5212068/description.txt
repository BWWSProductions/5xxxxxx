This is a DVD rip of all 4 Seasons/45 Episodes of the famous show plus the two Episodes made for the german TV (Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus), made to fit on one DVD. Quality is not great but it's near to the source so it should be sufficient for the non-geek fan anyhow.

I made frame dumps so you can see the difference.

I also ripped the English subtitles. I tried really hard to correct every single mistake the OCR software made, but I'm sure you will still find some due to the sheer amount of text (1,7 MB SubRip files).

I also tried to define some chapters so that one can jump directly to a certain sketch without searching (if the player supports chapters), which is not easy given the sketch-merging format of the shows, but maybe you find it useful anyhow.
