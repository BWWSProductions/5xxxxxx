i can understand english in english, who would add english subs to an english show."

Subtitles are useful if you are not fluent in English. Or if you are just plain fucking deaf."

,ClassicsOnly,2011-04-26T11:43Z,Did anyone else hear high-pitched squeaky noises intermittently throughout the episodes? I've watched about half a dozen and they all have this same problem. I'm using VLC player. Please advise. Thanks!
,Pogmog,2011-06-29T10:13Z,@ClassicsOnly The same thing was happening to me. It sounds like it was ripping my speakers. I don't think there is anything to fix it. I'm just going to download this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3977753/Monty_Python_Collection
,bil_gr7,2012-01-15T14:02Z,"@Normalcy 
English subs to english shows are necessary to people who speak other languages and can't figure everything they're listening. Not all of us are born in USA or England. Subtitles are also extremely helpful to people with hearing disabillities. So stop thinking only about yourself and quit bitching about something that is helpful to a lot of people.

Thanks for the upload."
