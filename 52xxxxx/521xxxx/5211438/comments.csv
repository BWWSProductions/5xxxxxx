,cobra666_millenium,2009-12-13T09:11Z,"@aligator5: Due to the fact that this is a DVD-RIP, the video quality is pretty good (i'd say). Anyway, you can download&watch it ...and then tell here your honest opinion about the quality !!!"

Nice download speed, Cobra666; it's 5th in my queue and I'm still getting almost 200k."
