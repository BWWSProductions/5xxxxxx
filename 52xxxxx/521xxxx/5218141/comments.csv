I hope this helped you.

,11241xXeyeXx14211,2009-12-15T02:43Z,"Well zmacdaddy8 I understand your point and I agree that these torrents are available right here. But I don't believe that you have the right to decide if what is a complete waste of time and space. Also I am not uploading single movies I upload packs or sets if you will. And yes as it stands it is a slow download but I am hoping to get people to become steady downloaders and seeders. I would like to be a trusted User and a favorite uploader. I am currently taking any requests on sets, packs, or compilations people would like made. I aslo save people time from having to look up different torrents and find out which ones are reliable and of what quality they are. EYE makes TPB easier and hopefully soon I will have more people looking for these things. I download only from here at TPB and download only trusted, high quality stuff. If the Movie Packs become a hit I will start doing TV Shows and Music. So please keep your hateful, and ignorant comments to yourself as opinion is a variable to every man. Thank you for commenting.

,11241xXeyeXx14211,2009-12-15T06:25Z,"I want to say thank you tonygolla for expressing interest in my torrents as well as my ideas. Now you were correct in that i wasn't seeding and i am sorry that i wasn't. I had made a mistake with my torrent client and now the problem is fixed. I hope you do download my torrents. And thank you for the feedback. I hope you decide to download from me.
