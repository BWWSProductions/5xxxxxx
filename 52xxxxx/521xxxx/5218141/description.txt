Thank you for downloading.

These are in my opinion the top 14 action movies this year.

~ Crank 2: High Voltage - DvDrip

~ District 9 - DvDrip

~ Fast And Furious 4 - DvDrip

~ G.I. Joe: The Rise Of The Cobra - DvDrip 

~ Gamer - DvDrip

~ Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince - DvDrip (I understand that to many people this constitutes as a Fantasy or Family movie but again my opinion is that it is a Action Film)

~ Inglorious Bastards - DvDrip
 
~ Pandorum - DvDrip

~ Push - DvDrip

~ Saw VI - DvDrip (Again many people will say that this is Horror or Thriller which I agree but decided it fit well with the rest of these movies)

~ Star Trek - DvDrip (Yes it is a very Sci-Fi series but I believe that those who have seen this film already, will agree with me that it has an immense amount of Action)

~ Terminator Salvation - DvDrip

~ The Final Destination 4 - DvDrip

~ Transformers 2: Revenge Of The Fallen - DvDrip

I did not create these videos or any of the files I simply put them together in a .torrent file for your download and viewing.

Please seed. I will forever.
