                  After so many years in the scene, both as     
                  individuals   and   as   a  group   we've     
                  definately  become  more  refined,   with     
                  keygens  and retail  supplies and  not to     
                  mention the  latest addition,  ebooks. We     
                  hope  to  bring you  more of  the quality     
                  stuff  we've  brought  so  far  and we're     
                  sure,  unless a  meteorite hits  earth or     
                  something that we'll be  here for  a long     
                       time, on top, as you know us :)          
                  Even  though  we've   grown  quite   big,     
                  there's always room for more  people, and     
                  we're      looking      for      talented     
                  crackers/keygeners  who  can crack/keygen     
                  most protections like  arma/aspr/hasp etc     
                  and  suppliers.  If  you  are interested,
