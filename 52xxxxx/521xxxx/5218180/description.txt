or search for zombie island and get that DLC and the crack is with it.


vv OLD INFO vv

Heres a crap fix for 1.0.1 to connect to gamespy and bypass the 'update required'.
Basically you need version 1.0.1, and this will let you connect to gamespy
and not force you to update, you can have friends make a server and and you can play online, it wont connect to 1.1.0 servers, if anyone else makes a server using this you can join those.

So if you make a server using this start your server name with 101, 
that way people on this crack will know they can join your server.

Alot of people seemed to update to 1.1.0 THIS WILL NOT RUN ON GAME UPDATED TO 1.1.0,
you can try to install the reloaded 1.0.1 patch on a 1.1.0 updated game
to downgrade it back to 1.0.1 and play online with this.
That might work no promises.
If it doesn't you'll need to reinstall and update to 1.0.1.

Soooooo just replace the borderlands.exe with this one
and you can bypass the forced update and play online on 1.0.1.

i made this literally 5 minutes after the damn update came out lol, sorry i didnt put it up sooner i just figured someone would crack 1.1.0 by next day or so.

Ill try and answer any comments.
