Step 5. Click on the audio stream. Now, you must see "Delay Box [ms]" showing on the right side of the window. 

Step 6. Enter audio delay value, for example:-
If you see in the movie that a person speaks, and you can hear the voice only several seconds later (Audio is after Video), then you must choose negative value (in milliseconds), for example:
-5000 = shift audio by 5 seconds before video 

If you can hear the voice in the movie too early, and only after several seconds you can see & determine who has said that (Audio is before Video), then you must enter positive value (in milliseconds):
5000 = shift audio by 5 seconds after video
