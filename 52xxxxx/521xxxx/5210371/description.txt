I hate movies in RAR files (especially those with password) cause you have to use a lot of space on Hard Disk to see the movie and seed the torrent. I don't like .NFO files, so I try not to write any of it. I hate 2 CD's for a movie, it's like watching 2 episodes from TV series. So I took the 2CD's of ARROW's release and put it in a single video file. Didn't touch the quality. Sample provided too.

The film is a sequel to Zombieâ€™s 2007 remake of Halloween (1978), and the tenth film in the Halloween film series. Picking up where Halloween ended, and then jumping ahead one year, Halloween II follows Laurie Strode as she deals with the aftermath of the previous yearâ€™s events, Dr. Loomis who is trying to capitalize on those events by publishing a new book that chronicles everything that happened, and Michael Myers as he continues his search for Laurie so that he can reunite with his sister.

Plot:
Michael Myers is still at large and no less dangerous than ever. After a failed reunion to reach his baby sister at their old home, Laurie Strode is immediately taken to a hospital to be treated by the wounds that had been afflicted by her brother a few hours ago. However, Michael isnâ€™t too far off and will continue his murdering â€˜Halloweenâ€™ rampage until he gets his sister all to himself.
