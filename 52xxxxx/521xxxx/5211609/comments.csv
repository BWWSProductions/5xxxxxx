,andy72184,2009-12-16T09:46Z,Eh could be better IDK I was in the middle of fucking my GF so I didn't get to watch the whole thing correctly.
,Q400,2009-12-16T19:26Z,"Andy, Thanks for info about your ""GF"". I dont know what to do without this important information. Why dont open the window next time - and sell tickets!"
,andy72184,2009-12-17T20:52Z,"I might consider it if my gf is a fucking whore which she's not, so maybe in my next lifetime I'll consider it if I don't give a fuck about myself or anyone else."

,CleanEdge,2010-01-13T07:39Z,"twievalin, I got it working by unpacking
""500dos.cstm.dk.swe.tms.rar""
with 7ZIP, then right clicked the folder I unzipped it to and opened it in VLC. It worked Like a Video TS I assume and ran smoothly. If you opened the original Folder as a Video TS folder then you would have short clips back to back with a small buffer time in between.

Hope this helps someone. Nice quality too
Video 10/10.
Sound 10/10
Subs: Working for Both ""Dansk"" and ""Svenska"" as far as I could tell."
