This is a DTS 5.0 conversion created from a lossless stereo source of Alicia Keys - The Element Of Freedom (Deluxe) (2009). See Amazon.com for more details about the album: http://www.amazon.com/Element-Freedom-Deluxe-Incl-Tracks/dp/B002VPDOFK

-----------------------------------------------------------

The conversion was done using the SPEC method (ArcTan set to "across" with Slice rears) found on http://www.surroundbyus.com.

The files are only playable on home theater equipment or PC's capable of decoding a DTS signal. Otherwise, you will hear static. You have several options, including the following:

a) Foobar2000: Install the foo_input_dts plugin and load the cue file directly into your playlist.

b) Mount the cue file on a virtual drive (with Daemon Tools, for example) and play with a DTS-capable player (Cyberlink PowerDVD, for example).

c) Burn the cue file to a CD as an image (with ImgBurn or Ahead Nero, for example) and play on a DTS-capable Home Theater system.

Enjoy and please give some feedback!
