I downloaded this torrent & when i play it with WMP, PDVD9 & even tried it in Sound Forge 10.0 all i get is a constant hissing sound!!!

Are you sure you ripped it properly???"

Did you read the torrent description above? It gives precise instructions about how to play a DTS .wav with a cue file. This is not a rip as the album was never released in a DTS surround format. "
,shen_long75,2009-12-21T00:46Z,"Yes mate i understand...

I didn't have 2 read the above instructions...

1) I loaded the .cue file using the latest Daemon tools lite.
2) I tried playing the virtual disk using Cyberlink PDVD9 & i also tried WMP11. I also tried to see the actual wave file using Sony Sound Forge 10.0

I had NO luck in all 3 instances.

Any other suggestions???


thx

,shen_long75,2009-12-21T00:52Z,"OK Matey....

My bad :-(

OOPS!!!

I feel like a real NEWB now... He Heee :-S

All is good :-)

Works a treat :-P

It didn't work 1st time round on PDVD9 but then i reloaded it & it works fine.

A little low on the volume side of things but its all good cause like i am only using 2.0 speaker setup.

Will burn to disk & play it inside on my home theatre.

I do apologise for jumping the gun :-)

Thanks for the great torrent :-) :-) :-)"

If you open a DTS .wav with Sound Forge, all you will see is two solid bands, one per channel. This is normal, because the DTS encoding crams six channels into two. It takes a DTS decoder to make any sense of it, which Sound Forge is not. 

Enjoy Alicia in surround!"
