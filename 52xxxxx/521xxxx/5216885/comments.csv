Without you guys IÂ´d be so bored:)"
,BlackandBad,2009-12-15T00:01Z,i'm betting 100$ that the ending is a dream !!!! 
,DeanMachine16,2009-12-15T00:03Z,"'BoabJ' and 'gwie_01' are obviously dickless losers with nothing better going on in their lives than to try and spoil things for others.
I already saw the episode before seeing the spoiler comments made here, but I just knew some useless fucks would be ruining the ending for people.

And holy shit, what a shocker of an ending it was! :-O
Awesome episode dispite the fact that I both loved it and hated it.
When you watch it you'll see why.

Just avoid reading some of the previous comments made here and in a couple of the other torrents the losers spammed in."
,xsmithx12,2009-12-15T02:40Z,Thank YOU!
,Ganddi,2009-12-15T08:47Z,"I believe is gonna be a dream. Dexter's dream.

,miaruehl3,2009-12-15T19:20Z,"wow what an ending... I hated it, and loved it too... I hope that their is some twist.. Dexter is the best series, right up their with The Shield.  I love nip tuck too... but I think Dexter has them beat..."

,Saadi,2009-12-16T12:45Z,:((((( Almost Cried in The End of The Show
,ludedude,2009-12-16T16:08Z,C'mon mods...where are you guys? Commenters who deliberately post spoilers should have their accounts deleted. This means you gwie_01 and Boabj. You two haven't contributed shit and you're ruining the season finale of one of the best shows in production for those who haven't seen it. Someone should have checked your ID's at the door...too many damned poorly behaved kids around here these days...
,iJnf,2009-12-17T17:09Z,"I wasn't expecting that. O.o
Great finale tho.

Well, anyone out there knows when will the fifth season be released?

Kind Regards."

,freeisgreat,2010-03-17T19:43Z,"If you don't like spoilers pls, look away now:

Is there anyone else as happy as am about Rita's death??
Man, that woman has brought balance into Dexter's life i couldn't agree more with that, but she's on the other hand is a total control freak!! 
Only wish writers have got you killed sooner."
,Mindhunter89,2010-07-21T15:29Z,"i really hope that the end is a dream which is supposed to show dexter that it is difficult to do both, protect his family and be a serial killer

it would be a pity if that wasn't a dream..."
,DJFallen,2010-09-18T16:02Z,I was curious about season 5. Anyone have it out yet?
