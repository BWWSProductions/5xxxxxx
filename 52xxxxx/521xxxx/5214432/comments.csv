Each file is a Scan of the open book and thus contains 2 pages of the book (one jpeg appears to be a photo, not a scan).

File Names are Generic Scan #s...so file names give no clue as to page number or contents of the pages themselves!

All Scans show center binding between pages which means slightly blurry and change in lightness/darkness.

Book details say 320 pages.  142 x 2 = 284 pages...so 36 pages are missing!

No Table of Contents
No Index
No Credits

All things mentioned, this is still a good book to DL...but this info should have mentioned in the Details."

,janvincentbeeckman,2012-05-16T18:34Z,This is a file with separate JPEG-files (bad quality).
