R/C (Radio Control) racing has a large following around this country, but it is a fair weather sport. Big Scale Racing allows you to continue to race anytime of year from the comfort of your PC chair.

Sure it isn't Gran Turismo, but it still has its own unique, if slightly geeky flavour and you might enjoy it if you are a scale model racer. It's better than expected, but there are a few handling flaws. Also very occasionally the physics model seems to lose track of what you are doing and the handling becomes weird.
