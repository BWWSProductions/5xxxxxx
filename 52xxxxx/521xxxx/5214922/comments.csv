,tardfingers,2010-02-03T06:21Z,"not familiar with this file type.
what player do you use to play .m4u..?"
,tardfingers,2010-02-03T06:23Z,*m4v.. 
,mrchainsaw,2011-02-12T01:54Z,"I believe iTunes uses .m4v so you may want to try that if VLC doesn't work. Let us know what you find out, please!"
,mrchainsaw,2011-02-12T03:39Z,"I'll answer my own inquiry: this plays in both iTunes and VLC. Thanks for the upload and fast rate, eastspur"
,WithoutDoubt,2011-06-29T20:07Z,Is this torrent skipping for anybody else?
,WithoutDoubt,2011-06-29T20:10Z,sorry. the video is not skipping I was just being stupid and trying to play the movie before it was fully done downloading. Great torrent.
