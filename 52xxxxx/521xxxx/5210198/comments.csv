,jotembi,2009-12-12T08:42Z,"even if it's hard to swallow for today's russians, latvians etc., the soviet scheming and atrocities are historical facts
the movie is propaganda, of course, and the truth (as usual) lies somewhere in between
but the soviet union was indeed very similar to nazi germany, and stalin was quite a match to hitler
there are several examples of this specific political system in history, and all of them are basically the same, the local color removed
the movie is definitely worth watching (btw, where are the multisubs? on dvd, i presume)"

,taunus37,2009-12-13T18:55Z,"jotembi, .mkv (matroska container) can hold multi-subs just like a DVD. Use VLC media player where you can select the language per your preferrence. "
[T],FatFreddy69,2009-12-13T21:42Z,"I personally prefer Media Player Classic (k-lite pack).
After you open the movie with it
click View (second from left in the upper menu)
click Options
click Internal Filters
then check (tick, select) all boxes, done.

Open again the player double clicking on the movie, right click on the screen, scroll down to subtitles et Voila, chose the one you want!

By the way MPC gives a better picture with the default settings. If you play with the advanced settings in vlc you may ruin it and have to reinstall it again if you didn't remember what you did.

MKV is the future (and present for some)."
,buburuzz,2010-01-31T11:32Z,"Thanks for sharing it! There is an obvious resemblance between nazism and communism and the still hidden communist crimes should be remembered the same way as the nazi crimes. 
Unfortunately there was no Nurenberg trial for communists, so they could turn over night in flourishing capitalists and oligarchs in their converted states, doing corporate business. Money still has no stinch."

,popovichh,2012-02-27T23:37Z,"I don't understand why the hell did they put Ratko Mladic in the movie about Communist crimes in Soviet Union. What the fuck?
First of all, Ratko Mladic is NOT convicted of war crimes, he is on trial (a big difference) for Srebrenica where only 3.500 are confirmed killed with another 3.500 missing which comes to total of 7.000 (not 8.300).
Second, even if he was the sole responsible for those killed and missing (which is total bullshit, anyone with a brain can find out how many Serbs were murdered by Muslims and Croats) many of those killed were soldiers led by war criminal Naser Oric who was acquitted in Hague when it's a known fact that he and his men were in big part responsible for 3.500 killed Serbs in villages around Srebrenica PRIOR to Serbian offensive.
Now you tell me, how the fuck can I give any credibility to this documentary now?"
,axelkeylargo,2012-03-01T18:27Z,"Hi, Mr. Popovichh, I don0t live in Europe, don't know any Yugoslav, but can see You are an Serb, so I would ask You something what I heard long time ago - is it true that you Serbs, when your parents are old and can't work any more (be useful in the house etc.), have lead them in the wood and kill them? Thanks for answer."
