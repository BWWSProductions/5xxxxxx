The complete story of Europe's most murderous regime has never been told.

 Until now ...

The film tells the story of the Soviet regime and how the Soviet Union helped 

Nazi Germany instigate the Holocaust. The film shows recently uncovered archive

 documents revealing this.

Interviews with former Soviet Military intelligence officials reveal shocking 

details.

"The Soviet Story" was filmed over 2 years in Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Germany,

 France,UK and Belgium. Material for the documentary was collected by the 

author, Edvins Snore, for more than 10 years. As a result, "The Soviet Story"

 presents a truly unique insight into recent Soviet history, told by people, 

once Soviet citizens, who have first-hand knowledge of it.
