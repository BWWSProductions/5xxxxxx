,Akiraosc,2009-12-31T13:26Z,"Got this and scanned it before and after installing.  Was clean, and worked well for me.  Loaded up as Demo Tutorial, but let me switch to Single Player editing mode.  Will post again if I see anything off about it.  Other than that, its a getting a def + rank.

Thanks, deadeye39.  I will seed as usual."
,snapperhead47,2010-01-01T20:09Z,the toolset will not open for me it just throws up an error saying it can't find the game engine dll and then when you hit ok it closes

,Petsura,2010-03-18T00:27Z,"Doesn't work for me.

All I get is ""Unable to connect to the database"" once I try to start it."
,barbzilla,2010-03-27T16:28Z,"The unable to connect to database is a common error with the toolset, it may not have anything to do with the torrent."
,phatfunk,2010-04-27T13:36Z,any ideas how to get it to work? Im getting can't connect to database and i got no idea how to fix
,Laustis,2010-06-19T00:52Z,This torrent DOES not work with 1.03+ ! So if you got that .. Then don't even bother downloading this torrent :) 
,EdyK9,2011-10-30T08:52Z,"- working great and very nice speed! thx to all seeders! 
 I wanted this to get a 999 inventory :) 
- go to
My Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age\Characters\*your character*\saves\*the save you want*
and open up the .das file in the toolset
go to savegame_partylist
savegame_max_items and change it to 999
save and when you load the save you can now carry 999 items

just don't buy any backpack after that or it will reset to 125

(thx to AsanteRevell from GameSpot for the tip)
  ENJOY THE GAME !"
