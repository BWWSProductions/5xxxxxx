,domin8r2000,2010-03-12T01:54Z,"Hey Cyber_W
Is it possible to pull the key out for install in Virtual Machine. (VMware).
It is always asking for key. Installing with burned disc or from mounted iso... Any way I can get the key out to use in Virtual Machine."

,Maggot101,2010-05-26T02:33Z,Can anyone tell me why I am unable to get all the files onto a dick. Also how to get all the iso files on? I was able to get some (most) files onto a disk and it booted just fine then when it was expanding the files it said it was missing components or something like that. Message me at sin.x3@live.com.
,Maggot101,2010-05-26T10:10Z,"OK after a lot of work I finally got it to work, but much like a lot of comments on here I also lost my drivers for my pci. I went to dell.com re-downloaded all the drives, burned to a disk and still nothing, oh when I tried to download the driver for pci I got an error message. What's going on man?"
