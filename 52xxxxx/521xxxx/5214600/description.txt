And here is a re-up of once of my favorite series, Largo Winch, in case you missed 1-3 :)

It is about Largo Winch, a young and handsome orphan who get secretly adopted by Nero Winch, a wealthy businessman, and trained to take his place when he dies.
Then Nerio Winch get killed, and Largo immediately find himself in trouble, fighting both for his life, and his business empire.

The series are basically unknown in the english speaking countries, but 15 books are out in french, and a TV series exist. They also made a game, which did get released in english.


The following books are in this pack:

He has the same name, but slightly different: â€œWinch.â€ This man, Nerio Winch, wants to find an heir to his empire and adopts Largo, offering him the best education. When his adoptive father disappears under dramatic circumstances, Largo inherits the W Group, the biggest conglomerate of multinational enterprises ever possessed and managed by a single man.
