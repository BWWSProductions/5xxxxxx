,roadside1,2010-01-15T06:25Z,"Nice dl but it is the 7th Edition, not 8th."
,darkshadow666,2010-05-14T11:37Z,7th or 8th ?
,shayanb,2010-08-31T10:27Z,This is NOT Resnick Halliday. This is Physics for scientists and engineers by SERWAY JEWETT.
,indy_tx,2010-09-06T22:57Z,It appears that shayanb is correct. This is not Fundamentals of Physics. But it's still a good book. :-)
,indy_tx,2010-11-03T06:59Z,"Also, chapter 35 is missing."
,indy_tx,2010-12-03T09:37Z,Good quality. Not scanned. Generated from original sources.
,indy_tx,2010-12-28T03:59Z,"This is ""Physics for scientists and engineers (5th edition)"" by Serway and Beichner (not Jewett). It's listed on Amazon."
,indy_tx,2010-12-28T03:59Z,Table of contents is missing.
,indy_tx,2010-12-28T04:02Z,"A newer edition (6th) is available here on the pirate bay:

Serway Jewett Physics for Scientists and Engineers 6E + Solution

That's a good quality torrent. The book includes a table of contents."
