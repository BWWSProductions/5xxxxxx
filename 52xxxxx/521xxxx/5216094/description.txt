         IE Cache Sucker is a files explorer utility witch let you   
         extract files from the internet explorer temporary (cache   
         explorer)   where   Internet  Explorer save  file  during   
         navigation.                                                 
                                                                     
         The  cache  explorer is rich of useful  images (png, gif,   
         bmp, exif, jpg etc), JavaScript (JScript),  VBScrpt, HTML   
         code,  CSS  sources,  Flash Movies, Video Movies  
         file  FLV, MPEG, AVI, MOV etc), downloaded  programs, RAR   
         and ZIP archives etc, that you can use.                     
                                                                     
         But this Internet Explorer Temporary Cache has many files   
         with   duplicated  content   also  even the  filename  is   
         different.                                                  
                                                                     
         These page cache aren't easily accessible,  so how out or   
         how save these files in a easily way? Simple...using this   
         utility!                                                    
                                                                     
         With this utility  you can copy files with unique content   
         eliminating  hundreds of  duplicated files   and  we  can   
         organize these  files in different  folder  for each file   
         type (depending on settings).
