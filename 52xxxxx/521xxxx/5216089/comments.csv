,avogarden,2009-12-14T14:34Z,Unfortunately this gives an error message when installing.  Do not bother until a fix is found.  Tried on Win 7 x64 Ultimate.

I am running Windows 7 x64 so i don't know about any other version of windows but my guess is that it has nothing to do with that. TutboTax Deluxe installed with no problem so I'm sure its just the torrent."
,alterfurz,2009-12-20T10:11Z,Lz0 has issued a fix. Google lz018n01.zip
,JerryTT,2009-12-20T22:55Z,Still doesn't work with crack fix
,alterfurz,2009-12-21T11:06Z,lz018n01.zip extracts to TurboTax 2009 Installer.exe which you should use to replace the faulty existing file. At present this file is accessable only on usenet. It does work.
,JerryTT,2009-12-21T17:07Z,"Thanks for the info, but I think I am stupid about the NZB files.  I get a file named 1261345010.nzb it unzips to a RAR file that is corupted"
,alterfurz,2009-12-21T18:37Z,"@JerryTT, google ""TurboTax.Home.and.Business.2009.CRACKFIX-Lz0""
gets you the file without using usenet."
,JerryTT,2009-12-22T01:49Z,"Thank you, got the file, but now it asks for a password,  I am feeling dumber by the minute."
,donutluver,2009-12-24T01:11Z,Thank you TvTeam. Works great
,velo2,2009-12-26T15:28Z,"Forget this torrent use:

,ecs1,2010-01-10T07:07Z,Can someone please post the Canadian version for filing 2009 taxes in Canada?
,kievrandy,2010-01-15T16:14Z,"THE PROBLEM I WAS HAVING WAS THE PROGRAM WORKS WITHOUT UPDATES. WHEN YOU UPDATE, THE PROGRAM STICKS AND NOTHING HAPPENS.  I GUESS IF YOU DON'T UPDATE, THE PROGRAM WILL WORK???  PLEASE ADVISE."
,Stabgotham,2010-02-14T05:10Z,"For all those that have asked and to correct the responses from a few people, Federal E-file is completely free.  The State e-file is not free.  It is free to download the State forms, but to e-file your state return using TurboTax H&B, it costs 19.95.  So you will be able to fill it out and have it prepared and ready, but when it comes time to submit, you will be charged 19.95 (for the first State return, 39.95 for any additional).  

You can, however, print the State return out and mail it in for free or just take the information from the Turbotax State return and submit it through your State's free e-file service.

This program installed and worked perfectly for me on Windows 7 Ultimate x64.  "
