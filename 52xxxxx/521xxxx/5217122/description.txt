This is the long awaited Wild Volume 11 (2 cds) for all of those WildFM Fans!

Sorry about the shithouse quality (most files are in wma 64kb)

These were my original backup, made in 1999. I've manage to salvage a few mp3's from an original fucked cd (disc 1). The other is lost :(

Please seed and keep it real kids!

LONG LIVE WILD!!!
