,hawk333,2009-12-15T09:02Z,"lol i agree the episode was pretty crap, one for people just to have in their collection for the sake of having all episodes"
,hawk333,2009-12-15T09:18Z,"but as For 'worst episode ever produced' is someone forgetting the live action episode... i think that wins worst episode award lol. Thanks For the Minus 1 on a torrent that is high quality, not archived and correctly named just because YOU didnt like the episode. I suppose it's more interesting watching the torrents you uploaded.......oh wait. . . "
,LordSajo,2009-12-16T01:49Z,Thanks hawk333
,jfill,2009-12-26T05:08Z,"what are you guys talking about? this and the live action episode were on par with the rest. 

not fans of Jon Benjamin?"
,hawk333,2010-01-05T03:41Z,"Yeah I was just playing along with the troll making him feel like a dumbass, i thought it was ok but not as good as most season 3 / 4 episodes"
