AutoMapa is the first satellite navigation system to feature 3D building visualisation in Polish and European towns and cities, making it the world's leading car navigation utility. Owing to its coverage of a  comprehensive road network in Poland and the unique building address option, AutoMapa delivers unprecedented navigation precision on Polish and European roads.

Highly accurate city navigation maps, hundreds of thousands of precisely described Points of Interest (POI), a unique community of registered users of the Miplo.pl service and Krzysztof Holowczyc's voice - those are the distinctive features of AutoMapa.

AutoMapa is a leader on the market of innovative solutions. It is the first Polish system that supports the collection of traffic data, and users will soon be able to avoid traffic jams with the program's help. AutoMapa has been guiding drivers since 2003, and it continues to be the most popular and the most frequently awarded GPs navigation program.


AutoMapa Europe is a detailed navigation map of whole Europe.

It includes full version of Polska XL map, extended by navigation data of  European countries provided by the Navteq company.

Searching for travel destinations and navigation all over Europe does not require switching between maps- they are combined into one homogenous product with advantages of the most detailed maps of Polska XL release and  maps of Europe of the Navteq company. Information on the degree of precision and the area covered in respective countries are presented on page 'Contents'.

Just like Polska XL map, AutoMapa Europe release also offers the option of choosing and installing both a selected part and the whole map. Thus the user depending on his/her needs may have at his/her disposal either a set of maps for navigation or, when needed (i.e. when the map is to be stored on a small memory card) only a selected area.

AutoMapa Europe on the territory of Poland offers all functionalities of AutoMapa Polska XL, including detailed address points, visualisations of building outlines, rich topographic contents and many others. Detailed  address points and building outlines is a unique feature available only in AutoMapa navigation system.

With its latest maps of Polish and European roads, exclusive data with actual impact on travel safety and, above anything else, the abundance of information, AutoMapa proves to be the perfect pocket guidebook to every summer resort.

This year's second update of the system's navigation maps makes AutoMapa the perfect accessory to any vacation plans. If you have a cell phone with Windows Mobile system, AutoMapa can become your pocket guidebook to cultural and entertainment attractions provided by Polish cities. With its detailed navigation plans of over 2,600 cities and towns, complete road network, which covers over 637,000 km of Polish roads in all categories, almost 430,000 Points of Interest with detailed descriptions (located in particular in popular summer resorts),  you can easily and quickly find your favorite local haunt. Clubs, discos, restaurants or museums â€“ any tourist with AutoMapa will have no problem in finding the way to fun!

AutoMapa constitutes an actual and deliberate effort to improve the safety on the Polish roads. In cooperation with the Polish Railways, AutoMapa provides Polish drivers with a particularly accurate and current database of railway crossings in Poland. Over 15,000 such crossings have been specially marked to ensure that AutoMapa users will be aware of any potential danger. Data collected in cooperation with the General Headquarters of Police and Krzysztof Holowczyc's foundation called â€œSafe Driverâ€ indicate and warn of 500 most dangerous road zones in Poland. The biggest database in Poland of fixed and mobile speed cameras, road check points and unmarked cars with cameras shows the spots where you cannot simply put the pedal to the metal and safely reach your destination.

â€œI refuse to leave without my smartphone with AutoMapa in my pocket. Even if I know the route, the navigation system remains very useful by indicating dangerous zones or updating the current distance to my destination. Obviously, I still have to think hard and concentrate on driving but in this way I can better control my progress. I have already tested the most recent version of AutoMapa and I must say that I'm very satisfied. I'm particularly impressed with the railway crossing warning system, which is truly indispensable to anyone traveling ,â€ said Krzysztof Holowczyc, the best Polish rally driver.

Anyone planning to travel Europe in a car will particularly appreciate this version of AutoMapa, which comes with the latest maps (specification: Q2 2009) provided by NAVTEQ, the world's leader in European map drawing. With such new maps, drivers will manage to find their way to any of 44 European countries.

Traffic-unjammed world in AutoMapa 6

2009-12-09

The most awaited program this autumn â€“ AutoMapa 6 â€“ is the formula for Polish citiesâ€™ traffic-jammed streets.

The newest AutoMapa 6 shows the innovative approach to the method of route calculation. No more uncertainty and nervous solving riddles which way to choose to avoid the jams and get to the meeting on time. With AutoMapa Traffic system used for determining the route, the driver will be presented information of the exact arrival time and he/she can be sure the route will be the fastest possible.

AutoMapa Traffic is a smart system. With every day and hour it gets to know more not only about the road traffic statistics, but also about the current situation on the road. Traffic congestion data have been collected for more than a year now, from over a dozen independent sources. Their important part is the information delivered anonymously on-line by the AutoMapa users. Thanks to that, the road situation throughout Poland is available for AutoMapa Traffic. The program knows how the street traffic changes depending on the day and the time of the journey. AutoMapa users will get to their destinations faster than other drivers and even during rush hours in an unknown city they will be driving as quickly and agilely as if they had been living there for several years. The AutoMapa users who have devices with the Internet access (such as Smartphones, Navroad 460 BT or 560 BF) can, owing to AutoMapa Traffic, use the statistical information on road traffic and online-downloaded data as well. A special program facilitating quick data exchange with AutoMapa Traffic server for devices without the Internet access is to be introduced soon.

Janusz M. Kaminski â€“ AutoMapa marketing and PR manager â€“ claims that cooling down the driving experience has turned out to be an unexpectedly valuable benefit of AutoMapa Traffic: â€œWhen we see a traffic jam ahead and we donâ€™t know if we are going to be late 10 minutes or an hour, it is normal we get frustrated and try to find a solution by desperate manoeuvres and detours. As the drivers begin to trust AutoMapa Traffic, they know from the very beginning of the route that the system has selected the fastest route possible at the given moment. So, even if there is a traffic jam indeed, the drivers know there is no faster route than the one AutoMapa has chosen. And if the road situation changes, AutoMapa will automatically recalculate the route. The drivers know the estimated arrival time as well. It cools down the driving and allows the drivers to plan their time better, warn others about possible being late and e.g. listen to the radio and relax. In November, we exceeded the total number of 450,000 AutoMapa users. A significant group turned on the option to send anonymous road data in the program as early as in April. Soon after AutoMapa 6 is released, we expect even more interest as the users become acquainted with AutoMapa Traffic advantages. And the more users the system has, the faster and more accurate traffic jam information can be presented by AutoMapa to them.â€

AutoMapa works based on the most detailed Poland and 44 European countriesâ€™ maps, prepared by Polish and world GPS leaders: Geosystems Polska and NAVTEQ. The maps dated 30 October 2009 for Poland and in the specification of 3Q2009 for European maps, guarantee the most current data. The newest maps for Poland contain the complete road network in the country and, as the only maps in Poland, full database of point addresses assigned to particular buildings. In the newest AutoMapa versions, the number of cities, towns and other localities covered by this sort of numbering increased by another 258 and has exceeded 2228 now. Point addresses have also been made available for the first time for cities and other localities in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia.

AutoMapa 6 is also the largest base of Points of Interest in the market. The number of points (over 470,000) is so big that it required a new way to organize them. The POIs are now presented in the form of a hierarchical POI categories tree, synchronized with http://www.miplo.pl/ service. A noteworthy addition is the new function, Miplo Pics, thanks to which it is possible to display a POI-related photo with its short description.

With AutoMapa, the driving is safe. Information about the most dangerous 500 road zones in Poland, over 15,000 railway crossings, road control and speed radars, which was available earlier, has been extended by the largest speed limit database in Poland. AutoMapa 6 contains nearly 16,000 signs to mark the beginning and end of a built-up area, several dozen thousand of speed limits signs, out of which over 20,000 is located on international, country and regional roads. Limit signs in Warsaw, Gdansk, Torun, Bydgoszcz, Szczecin and Radom are included. With the speed limit signs AutoMapa informs the driver in real time on the allowable speed on a given road section.

AutoMapa 6 is now even more multimedia-enabled than ever. It allows to convert a GPS track to KML format, used to visualize 3D spatial data e.g. in Google Earth. Compatibility with this application is a step towards joining AutoMapa with popular spatial information sources and Internet resources of such services asor Panoramio. This functionality is an extension to the option in Targeo.pl location service, which allows the user to plan the journey and move it to AutoMapa. When planning a trip, even abroad, one can see the destination hotel, how picturesque the route with AutoMapa is and have insight in the destination surroundings.
