,sasafurian,2010-06-21T21:02Z,Guyz please help me out here. I've installed the game..then the patch then the DLC pack..i didnt overwrite the exe files with the crack cuz apparently it works without them.Perhaps the patch comes with a crack.Thx for the torrent.And the question is do i have to go EVERYTIME in the launcher on data files to activate manually the add ons ? cuz they become unchecked everytime i exit the game ?!!!?
,Lordvausgon,2010-07-15T06:16Z,"Downloading now, and the speed is decent, will comment whether its working or not when it is complete."
