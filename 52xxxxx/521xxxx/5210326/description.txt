[Vista] How to Restore Folder Icons to Default

Did you notice any problem or somewhat different in the folders? Recently, I installed a program to customize the current Windows Vista theme and icons. I am so amazed with the program because they gave three themes for free!



Use WinBubble If you need to restore some icons such as

yellowfolder

Users Folder (Username), Desktop Folder, Pictures, Favorites,  Videos, Contacts, Documents, Music, Computer, Control Panel,  Recycle bin, Network Neighborhood, Downloads and Open Folder Icon

In just One Click It can be restored. All of them! Isn't that amazing?
