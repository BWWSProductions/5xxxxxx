,Werm,2009-12-24T23:33Z,"On the surface GaGa appears to write songs with juvenile simplicity. However, this GaGa is very philosophical and deep. A torrent for the mind. For instance, her poetic song 'Brown Eyes' is about her love for anal sex. A true poet!"

Stop uploading lousy audio quality CDs.  No one listens to 192kbps quality anymore except newbs that don't know any better.  That's like converting a blu-ray to vhs.

256kbps at MINIMUM.  Get a clue.  I'm not the only one that will be avoiding your uploads from now on."

[T],SpandauBaby,2010-01-08T01:09Z,"This is Pop music.  Popular music is usually like this, just think of all those Popular music artists there are out there, there's bloody shit loads, I think really Lady Gaga can write and perform good pop stuff, that's what this is supposed to be.  At least she is writing the stuff herself.  If you don't like pop then don't download pop, download something else instead like Heavy grindcore punk death metal lol I can recommend you a few bands if you like? :-D"

[T],SpandauBaby,2010-01-08T16:57Z,"@bubanee: Yeah mate :-)  Maybe not so polite on this thread though http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5091759/PINK_FLOYD_full_discography_%28FLAC%29_%5BZoneTeam%5D a few of these ones have been complaining just because I started to kick off about Pink Floyd saying that I don't like them and I think they're boring and people should download other artists instead like the ones I'm sharing.. well the prog stuff I mean.  Obviously I've upset this guy scott_ehm hehe but I don't care really.  He tried to report me to the mods on the piratebay forum the other day but they just closed the thread and pretty much ignored him as he was trying to say I was going around different torrents spamming crap on them, but I wasn't lol  Anyway he has just posted his last comment after waiting a few days now, it was funny what I said to him last week.  Obviously he has been itching to post something nasty back again.  On that thread he posted on TPB forum he was saying that I think I'm some kind of prog god lol  It's hilarious really, he can say all he wants.  I personally don't like Pink Floyd anyway, I think it's boring and I hate the fact that so many people all download them and not other bands all the time.  I just don't get why people are like that really, there's far far better stuff I think.  I must admit it was funny kicking off on that Pink Floyd one, only person that seems to care is this scott_ehm person who keeps coming back for more! :-) lol"

If you google my name you'll see the thread he has posted where he's trying to report me.  Thankfully those people haven't done anything.  I guess I am the one who's sharing and uploading stuff where he hasn't got anything so probably just either a time waster or he's always snatching torrents all the time.

[T],SpandauBaby,2010-01-14T02:11Z,"She is a bit like a giant ORANGE really, she has a lot of ap-peel lol

I've spent lots of my time now thinking about, is she a bloke, is that really a transexual and stuff like that.  I've seen the picture of her at Glastonbury 2009 but to be honest really I don't think she is, she is just a bit weird really, that's what it is.  Not forgetting she has italian blood which probably explains a lot about what she stands for.  I've listened to her voice for ages now, heard lots of her popular records and I think deep down that she is really a woman.  She has a woman's voice, it doesn't sounds like a man's voice.  I know I have met people already who have said she is transexual but I think that these people who go around saying this want to believe that themselves for some reason which seems odd to me.  I think she is simply a woman, I've seen lots of pictures of real hermaphrodites on the internet and you can tell that they are not real women.  Even some of the real pretty ones like Kimber James the shemale pornstar, you can tell that she is a tranny.  I think probably that Lady Gaga is simply just a woman really, she has a certain strange style I'll give her that but I seriously doubt her being transexual.  That's what I think anyway I'm sure that there's people everywhere who still think she is, seriously where is your REAL proof on this so called accusation?"

and thanks again to everyone else...

p.s... @jleechy.. WTF are you really sexy.. what's that all about.. cheers!"
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-01-15T00:48Z,"Yes Bubs mate ;-)  According to this programme I watched on here once it said that they gave her the name Gaga as a nickname in the studio (probably some place in New York somewhere) and they called her that because she was a big fan of Queen and liked the song 'Radio Gaga' a lot and was obviously playing it over and over inbetween recording sessions that they were working on and this guy said that to her and eventually they called her that all the time.  I guess it's catchy really, calling yourself Radio Gaga because really when you think about it her music has been playing a lot of the radio so it has been like Gaga Radio all over the world (especially in my country!).  I guess they have suceeded in that department.  It's probably they want you to think ""AHHHH!!! transexual... "" to make you think more about the fact you don't know if she is or isn't to make you more interested in her.  Very clever really, these people who work in the music industry are very clever...

But then again not as clever as us lot on here lol... Cos we just send it out all over the place using the mighty bittorent protocol.  We are sending this music out to people so you have this choice of it being free now.  If it wasn't for this site then I'd certainly say it would be much worse for choice, we are lucky this one is still remaining!"

[T],SpandauBaby,2010-03-18T17:26Z,"Hi bubs mate ;-)  I'm having a problem on here and I wondered if you could help?  The problem is with tagging on Pirate Bay, when I put a word as a tag it doesn't seem to search for it when I run a search on here.  Like for example on my very latest torrent which is Part 13 of my rock collection, I've put say for example one of the tags for it as ""King Crimson"" which is a band I'm sharing but when I try and search King Crimson on TPB it doesn't seem to find my torrent???  Why the hell not?  I thought that it would work to be honest mate but I just don't get it, this is why I thought I'd ask you.  I might go on the forum maybe and ask them people.

Surely if you tag on here with a keyword then it should find your torrent when the user types the word that's the same in a search?

I'm hoping you could give me some insight to tagging on Pirate Bay, I just don't get it myself, like why it don't work is beyond me :-("
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-03-18T17:28Z,"Well what I mean is that I tried to tag it with say King Crimson as a tag but it didn't work.  I've put ""Krautrock"" now as a tag but that doesn't find my torrents so what the hell????"
[V],bubanee,2010-03-18T19:40Z,@ Spandaubaby.. hey buddy.. yep it's been a discussion point for awhile.. i think it's a small glitch in the search feature i have had a few probs with it myself but after awhile it does work.. i know it's a pain but it's been looked into.. not much more i can tell ya sorry on that subject..

Not only that but then you actually click the torrent link and then still post a comment.  It just goes to show how little of a life you have.  Grow the fuck up already.  Shhhiiiiitt!
,urjr2,2010-03-29T12:20Z,I hardly ever write comments [my bad] but this one is just too much to leave alone 6319 seeders and the tracks are badly over modulated back off the gain when you rip

Actually, there are occasions when I'm really forced to listen this diarrhea for music. When I'm at the gym and when I'm going out to have a drink. Thankfully there's the Key of Awesome that totally reveals her true nature.

But yes! Oh yes! Keep downloading Lady Gaga! Just don't support her with buying the CD and giving her money. Without money, she will eventually stop making music. ;)"

,delviskar,2010-04-30T01:50Z,"The only reason why Lady Gaga is so popular is because she's half naked on stage for all of her performances. All of her fans want to sleep with her, and most of the women who are into her probably think that since so many guys hate her because she's a slut and it's so empowering for them to believe in someone like that OMG!

Remember Brittney Spears, and Madonna, Lindsay Lohan? Lady Gaga is the same, same old shit, brand new package!! Get it? Package? That's a joke referring to the fact she has a penis! HAHA! Not that I hate trans-sexuals, hell most of the music I listen is from or inspired by them... but they were HONEST trans-sexuals and didn't try to hide it at all.. not like this crap. And no I didn't look this shit up by searching for her name, I found it on the top 100. Wrap your mind around THAT!"

I am in the process of downloading this torrent and whilst doing so, took the opportunity to browse the comments herein. I really was quite astounded at some of the comments which range from simply rude, to naive to unintelligible ramblings.

If folks here are really so anti-GaGa then why do they not go rant in the forum. Forum = Debate!

You are a god amongst Pirate Bay uploaders for the most amazing time that this has been the number 1 torrent for music on TPB.  I salute you sir!  You have achived something quite amazing here.  I take my hat off to you mate, heck you should even be in the Guiness book of records for this.  Gaga is fab, it really does go to show how popular she is.  There is no other music torrent as popular as this one!

All the negative people who have said all this wack shit about how bad she is, really they all need some comfort in their miserable lives.  A woman who has been so successful as Gaga is truly a woman who knows exactly what she is doing and knows just how to maintain a huge success."

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -2 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR Fraunhofer RETARDS!!!"
