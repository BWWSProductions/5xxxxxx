This video is being uploaded in anticipation of Pirate Bay going out of business.

There are two ISO files containing both parts of Middlemarch (1994). After using DVD Decrypter/Mode/ISO/Write to convert each to the original format they can be played displaying the embedded closed captions (subtitles).

My next upload will contain the broken down working copy of Middlemarch which I will (or you will) use to write/compose subtitle files .ssa/.srt using the stripped closed captions in text form.

It's going to take a long time. This movie is six hours compared to two hours for The Woman in White, which I am now trying to write.
