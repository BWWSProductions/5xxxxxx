,CyroKronos,2009-12-12T09:28Z,also.. woot! first commenter ;)
,CyroKronos,2009-12-12T09:47Z,"THIS IS THE CLOSED BETA =)
*CONFIRMED*"
,CyroKronos,2009-12-14T00:47Z,"has anyone else had problems getting this to work on a winxp machine? im gonna get win7 dual boot for christ so i'll try it on that but lots of the features in boxee are not working on winxp, most importantly netflix"

,iDevelop,2009-12-14T21:57Z,OSX version can be found at http://www.boxee.tv/download/mac_osx/boxee-0.9.20.9647.dmg
,yifanlu,2009-12-14T22:23Z,"TYVM iDevelop!

BTW: Windows: http://www.boxee.tv/download/windows/boxee-0.9.20.9647.exe"
,yifanlu,2009-12-14T22:30Z,"Wait nvm, new links now redirect to old alpha. Lame."
,iDevelop,2009-12-14T22:34Z,Yup just noticed that. Lame I'll see if I can find it
,yifanlu,2009-12-14T23:08Z,"If it's any help, the version for OSX beta is different from the Windows version, osx is 0.9.20.9648 (one build greater)"
,ggod130,2009-12-14T23:39Z,"@yifanlu

any chance you want to share the OS X version?"
,yifanlu,2009-12-14T23:49Z,"I don't have it, if I do I would. I know from reading the bug reports and crash logs on boxee's site what the version number is. That's how I got the windows version."
,avneron,2009-12-15T02:44Z,"Hi Guys,

We're cool with the version being on Bittorrent. The only issue is that we're trying to scale the rollout of the Beta, so we could have rock solid release by the time we open it to the public.

This version is already dated. We released a new version earlier today fixing some of the early bugs our users identified.

If you downloaded the Beta would be great if you could report bugs.. ;)

Regards,
Avner"
,yifanlu,2009-12-15T03:08Z,@avneron Thanks for being cool about this. Hope you guys are very successful with Boxee.
,ggod130,2009-12-15T03:13Z,"@avneron

Thanks for such great software and for being straight about this. I am only torrenting this because I am so impatient for my email saying I can download the OS X beta from you guys! Haha, its great stuff. Thanks again!"
,ggod130,2009-12-15T03:19Z,Oh and I also plan on reporting bugs.
,CyroKronos,2009-12-16T12:29Z,"@ Avneron, Wow blows my mind that you don't have a problem with boxee being pirated. Of course, realistically speaking the % of lost revenue on software pirating for companies is less than 1% of total earned /done ranting

Now for some bugs i have found on my machine (windows xp, nvidia 512mb, 2gb ram, 3.4 dc p4)

Bugs: 

Netflix very very often displays audio with a white screen where the video should be, works sometimes though, from my research on this im assuming that my O/S has something to do with the bug b/c it's mostly seen in XP and never in 7

Fox videos do not go full screen and play choppy

ABC videos require a missing plugin (possibly patch this plugin to the release)

Some hulu videos require you to sign in to view them but unlinke the hulu app there's now ay for you to sign in to your hulu account (possibly link hulu accounts to boxee accounts ie netflix)

would love to report more, would love it even more to get my hands on that updated release... anyone have a version number for that?"
,mgdspirit,2009-12-16T20:30Z,"Seems to want a username and password....but wouldnt let me make a new one...

sorry if its another dumb q, but, did I miss something?"
,nomaddna,2009-12-17T00:38Z,"@CyroKronos: Avner has better things to be doing than monitoring TPB for issues.

Report problems to:
1) jira.boxee.tv
2) forums.boxee.tv

All of the problems you've reported have been noted on both Jira and the forums."
,CyroKronos,2009-12-17T02:02Z,"@ nomaddna, well than i guess there's no reason for me to give any more input huh? sounds like everything is under control without the help of the pirate community... everybody can just stop reporting bugs its not that important anyways, right nomaddna?"
,CyroKronos,2009-12-17T02:04Z,"@mgdspirit: goto boxee.tv and make one there, it's free"
,yifanlu,2009-12-17T05:13Z,"Some kind guy posted a link to the newest version of the beta (newer then the Windows version) on twitter. I don't know if I should credit him or not as I don't want him to get in trouble with the boxee guys, but if you're the guy (we both know who you are), comment or send me a twitter reply or something, and I'll credit you in the description.

OSX version 0.9.20.9816: http://www.filesend.net/download.php?f=d53dbcde63e0dd11a8e16088662a17d5

Now for Linux & the updated windows version..."
,CyroKronos,2009-12-17T12:28Z,"@yifanlu, any luck finding the updated windows version? i'd like to try it before switching to windows 7
you probably already know this but according to my research the newest version number is 0.9.20.9816"
,ggod130,2009-12-21T19:31Z,"@yifanlu

Thanks alot dude for the OS X version! It saved me alot of time looking and hoping. Do you plan on putting up the new versions as they are available or was this a one time thing?"
,yifanlu,2009-12-21T22:05Z,"Umm, like I said, I don't have access to the beta. I found the windows version by URL snopping, and the OSX version on Twitter. I personally think leaking betas if you're invited is a douchy thing to do and kills trust."
,CyroKronos,2009-12-22T07:48Z,"oh well thanks then, can't wait for the beta to be open"
,lostfenix,2009-12-22T23:35Z,"There is a new version, the 0.9.20.99xx for Windows, is there enyone with this new version??"
