"Boxee is the best way to enjoy entertainment from the Internet and computer on your TV."

Anyways, this is the beta everyone's looking forward to. I did NOT get an invite and leaked it (that would be a dick move). Here's how I found the download (direct from their server):

1) Looked through the public bug reports
2) Found the version number of the beta
3) Plugged it into the download link for the current version
4) ??????
5) PROFIT!

^ Use this info to secure your downloads!

Hope you enjoy!

(This beta is supposed to be public in January, so for those who can't wait. You're welcome)

Anyone has the Linux or updated Windows version, please post a link. Thanks!
