,Cheezzz,2009-12-13T21:17Z,"I take it back, it's not working for me."
,bah13,2009-12-13T21:27Z,You may need to tweak cartographer a little as it hasn't been working properly and has been causing problems
,Cheezzz,2009-12-13T21:30Z,"Ignore everything I've said previously, it works 100% Thanks so much Lakrits! "
,drarkanex,2009-12-14T01:57Z,"Not exactly the most recent version, it sorta works, but i get a TON of errors.  It does work for the most part.  the .TOC still reflect 30200 (3.2v of WoW) so it's not exactly a 3.3 rated version.  but it's cool, still a good download for right now and it works fine, if you have Buggrabber and bugsack collecting the errors..."
,afroebob,2009-12-15T22:42Z,Thanks for the torrent and everything but i guess i am not doing this right. I am using windows 7 (btw its great go torrent it) but i cant use this addon. I put it into my C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\Addons folder and it says zygor and cartographer are both out of date. Then people say put it in C:\Users\Public\Public Games\World of Warcraft but i don't have that... So what do I need to do to get this working because i want to make a new pally? Thanks guys =)

,Lakrits11,2009-12-21T08:34Z,"@afroebob, i dont know, sience win7 can differ alot from vista. Delete your carthographer and zygor adons, and insert these new ones, load outdated addons,  and it should be working"
,Mauro_Rosati,2009-12-23T13:52Z,It can't be the 3.3 version since it's been released today 23/12/2009. So stop to say bullshit.

,DeSpell,2010-05-13T05:38Z,"Just install the newest TomTom along with the 2 zygor-folders you extract from download. Dont use Cartographer, its not compatible with the new wow 3.3.3 yet. 

Zygor + TomTom works PERFECTLY. This I can confirm. Im enjoying ""easy"" leveling again, and the new & fancy zygor ingame interface ;) Very cool.
Thank."
,DeSpell,2010-05-13T09:03Z,"Btw Zygor, i saw couple wrong info's in zygor. its alliance 20-to 25, Step 153: It says goto 15,40 and kill Gobbler. 
Gobbler is at 18,40.

And, step 155: It says ""accept 'Uncovering the past'
This quest is not accessable, unless you are level 25.

Thanks."

pleas upload the newest version. 3.3.3 ]

Guys: 

You can actually USE outdated addons, just mark ""load outdated addons"" under Addons in the logon-screen. Its not dangerous at all.

Btw, does anyone know where to post errors to Zygor guide? I just found another one.

Level 30-35: Level 30 step 9. It tells you to ride a f**king long journey to Astranaar, to fly to Auberdine... Why the h*ll not just take flightpath in Ratchet, right by the Isle of the Berserker-quest..???! Then fly directly to Auberdine. Saves ALOT of time. 

Thanks"
,phobiaof,2010-08-23T21:49Z,"okay, I've downloaded and am not sure what to do next? can someone do a simple walk through on set up for those of us who do not know what to do with this?
I figured AddOns but it doesn't even show up. maybe I need other add ons or something first?"
