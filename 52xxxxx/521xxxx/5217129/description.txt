The Miracle is a 90-minute TV movie comprised of several episodes of the old Lassie series, originally telecast between 1969 and 1970. The noble female collie befriends a young mute boy (Michael-James Wixted), who runs away with Lassie. As a result of the warm boy-and-dog relationship, the lad breaks his silence (Dr. Lassie, speech therapist: The mind boggles...) In the course of the story, Lassie also has a litter of pups--a neat trick, considering that "she" was portrayed by a male dog.

Note: the DVD quality on these old Lassie films is average but quite watchable
