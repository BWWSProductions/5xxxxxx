No sweat guys, this is basically just our old school TA directory, the way we 
like to play it. It evolved over a good few years of LAN play, and while it may
be unbalanced (no sweat there) if everyone learns the powerful units, it makes for
an incredible game.

NO other strategy game comes close to propper T.A. Everyone knows supreme commander sucks balls.

For the best LAN battle; each player builds up to 500 units without fighting. I.E Hits the unit limit. Then, when each player is ready, set your berthas and vulcans to fire at will. (CNTRL-A + Fire at will) Let the factorys roar and light up a fat one; you will be here for the next 4 - 5 hours fighting off wave after wave.

If you don't end with atleast 5000 kills each, you didn't play Total Annihilation.
