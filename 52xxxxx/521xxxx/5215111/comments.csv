nice clear sharp video 8.5 
audio slightly lets it down at 7

dont believe we will get better until dvd rips are around

excellent quality from NEHALKHALID

many thanks"

bad audio quality
but the movie was awesome"
,mnicholson1618,2010-02-08T19:34Z,"If your a fan of these movies and books, then don't download this one, wait for something better, but if you just wanna watch it just for the hell of it because you have nothing better to do, like me(I hate these movies btw), then go ahead and download. Video is cam quality, but in the higher cam quality range, could be much worse. And audio same thing."

,nandos421,2010-02-09T12:50Z,alright aii its real its not a file windows can just play u need new softwere unless u have it :) but other then that its good
,kissofd3th,2010-02-09T13:38Z,rudolf895: if you are really bitching about seeders then you can go FUCK YOURSELF. It's not this guys fault there are a bunch of little pricks out there who just download and then stop it. I actually download and then seed for up to 2 days. I find that very acceptional seeing as how it only takes about an hour to download.
