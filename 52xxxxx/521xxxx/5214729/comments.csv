[V],twentyforty,2009-12-15T07:54Z,"@kma101:
When I've moved in, I tried to re-upload at least my ""live"" torrents of popular TV shows. Some of them have been rejected by TPB database as ""Torrent already exists in the system"". It usually means that someone has uploaded my torrent from name-not-to-be-spoken to make H264 available to wider audience. It has nothing to do with me, I should say.
So, doing plan search might help, and if file size ""fits"" and file-name is as in my encodings, you will get the file, no matter what.
If you have some troubles with finding or downloading, let me now, and I'll figure something out."
