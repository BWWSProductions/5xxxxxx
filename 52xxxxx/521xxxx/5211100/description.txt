Burning Blue Soul (1981) is an album released under the artist name of Matt Johnson. This album was re-released in 1983 under Matt Johnson's band's name, The The featuring on some tracks, very different mixes from the original 1981 "psychedelic eye" cover release. The original 1981 Matt Johnson credited release is highly sought after by collectors as the mixes on that release are thought to be far superior than the later 1983 re-release. The album is an accomplished debut, with a unique mix of guitar riffs, tape loops, and experimental electronics.
