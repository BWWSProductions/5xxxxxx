,vipemike,2009-12-13T23:36Z,"Once i complete, I'll be able to see full time for a week or so."
,thorax232,2009-12-14T07:18Z,"View the trailer here:
http://www.thorax232.com/2009/12/thorax232-special-feature-ffx.html

I'm also currently upscaling this to 1080p to the best of my ability. But I won't upload that file until this one is well established with seeders. I don't want to go to full time on two files because of low bandwidth."
,darcoolio,2009-12-20T18:17Z,seed please...
,darcoolio,2009-12-21T15:45Z,"Uploaded 2gb, with 256kb/s max upload, but we are all stucked at 52,5%
Where is the problem?
Answer please..."
,charrie-san,2009-12-28T01:22Z,"same as above. Uploaded 3gb and still stuck at 52.5%, what's up?"
,thorax232,2010-01-06T18:09Z,"Seeding again (I was away for the holidays). You'll see pauses in my uploading I'm about to fly back to Germany where I'll go back seeding more often.

I've seen people up to 78%. I wish my internet was this good, I'm on WiFi right now, I can't upload this fast normally.

Anyways, keep the download going, you'll get it eventually, it's worth the wait I've watched this 11hour movie twice through now, it's actually very good."
,thorax232,2010-01-07T04:36Z,"We're at 80%. Huge thanks to 68.147.152.227 and 68.96.74.37. You guys are really helping get this movie out there. Once we get a few 100% seeders I know all the peers on this file will be able to download this without a problem. Hang in there guys, we're almost done."
,austinbru,2010-01-08T00:33Z,"Thorax232,

I want to thank you a million times for this upload, you don't know how long I've been waiting for this. Just started my download today and once I hit 100% I will seed for quite some time. Thanks!"
,thorax232,2010-01-08T18:22Z,"Hey no problem austinbru, look forward to more projects like this in the future. I saw somebody hit about 93% thanks to KCI's ridiculous 300kb/s upload. But unfortunately I'm back home now and fighting for 30kb/s. So hang in there, it's a big file. it'll take some patience."
,austinbru,2010-01-09T21:40Z,"I'm up to 96.8% in just a couple days. I'm traveling today, but when I get home I'll be able to seed for awhile. I was wondering what the quality of this film is, 11 hours is pretty long haha. Any chance of you doing a high res version?"
,thorax232,2010-01-10T20:10Z,"Quality? Well I watched it on a 42"" 1080p TV and it was watchable. It's not technically ""hi-res"" and definitely not HD but it's good. You should see for yourself soon enough.

I might be switching internet services soon for better upload speed and to match my new Qosmio X505-Q850. So I may do a higher quality  version, but honestly I doubt it. However FFXIII is on pre-order...."
,austinbru,2010-01-10T21:49Z,"100% thank you sir! Will seed for the next few weeks at least. Man, I really hope you decide to do a high res version of this. Honestly FFX has such an incredible story and I know there are tons of people like me that have been waiting for someone like you to take it on themselves to make it into a story. "
,thorax232,2010-01-11T08:54Z,"No problem, if you know of any games that would make a good movie (and wouldn't include lots of boring battle scenes...I tried Uncharted 2...thumbs down). I'd like to hear any suggestions.

I'm probably going to try HD with my next one, lets hope I can keep the file size reasonable. But it may be awhile before I start on that next project."
,austinbru,2010-01-12T03:36Z,My only suggestion is this exact video.. in HD ;) heh... please?
,thorax232,2010-01-12T08:52Z,"We'll see how it turns out, may be a couple days, or I may have to re-record the whole game I don't know, but I'll see what I can do. =p

,austinbru,2010-01-15T00:52Z,Keep us posted! That would be freakin' awesome haha
,thorax232,2010-01-16T11:40Z,"Well I'm currently looking into it. Turns out my PS3 isn't backwards compatible (it's a model CECHP) so re-recording is out of the question considering I no longer have a PS2. Plus Adobe CS4 tends to crash  every time I add this video, it's not looking good so far, but I haven't lost all hope. :)"
,austinbru,2010-02-06T17:34Z,I mean I'm sure your raw footage is fine quality. There would be no reason to re-record as far as I can tell. It looks like you need some video software that can compress your footage without crashing haha
,asianluffy,2010-02-27T21:12Z,"oh wow, is this really english version? cause i got final fantasy x dvd some time ago and was in japanese, and the subtitles were so stupidly made and made no sense, i hope this is english then i can burn it to dvd and put it in the nice dvd cover :) that came with the stupid japenese one, i love japanese anime with english subs, but my dvd i got was just arghh. lol please be english."
,thorax232,2010-03-22T22:03Z,It is all english. =)
,Sk8fr3akCro,2010-05-22T23:32Z,I LOVE you! thank you very much i was looking for something like this for AGES
,Christian420,2010-08-04T19:16Z,"As i wasn't expecting an 11 hour film i thought i'd let you all know before you download :)
