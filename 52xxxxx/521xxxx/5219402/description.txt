These are the audiobooks to The Quiet Game, Turning Angel, and The Devil's Punchbowl by Greg Iles.  They are read by Dick Hill.

To the best of my knowledge, the main character in the three books is named Penn Cage, and they can be read alone.

I really wish I knew who it was that thought that having a single file for a 20 hour long book was a good idea.  I would beat some sense into them.
