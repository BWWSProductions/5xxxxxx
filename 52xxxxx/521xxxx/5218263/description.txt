BBC Alan Whicker's Journey of a Lifetime 4of4 DVDRip x264 576p AC3 MVGroup

Celebrating a remarkable fifty years on television, TV legend and undisputed travel king Alan Whicker sets off round the world on a journey reflecting his incredibly varied life and career.

Episode 4of4: Hong Kong and Beyond
Alan completes the final leg of his journey by returning to Hong Kong, the hub of all his many Far Eastern adventures, five decades after his first trip. He looks at the drastically changing face of Hong Kong and the endless struggle that beautiful Bali has had to preserve its unique charms - especially after the 2002 and 2005 bombings. Plus, he meets the Brits who emigrated after watching one of his shows; visits the island full of 'Millionaire Natives' who made, spent and ultimately lost their fortunes; and interviews the British couple who escaped the rat race to live the Robinson Crusoe lifestyle in a remote tropical paradise.
