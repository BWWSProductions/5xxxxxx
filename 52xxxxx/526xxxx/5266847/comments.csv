,mouettus,2010-01-17T06:57Z,any subtitles for this release? can't find any on the net cuz the video is cut a couple secondes at the beginning and available subtitles on the net won't sync.
,vick977,2010-01-17T08:54Z,"This has german (non english) hard subs, kinda annoying."
,Leshy01,2010-01-21T02:30Z,"When you saw tested on a PS3, how does one go about doing that?"
,brazuka331,2010-01-25T00:44Z,"For some reason its not working for me. It doesnt show up on my ps3, yes i know what im doing i have 100+ blurays on it already but im going to try downloading it again maybe it got corrupted."

,Gethyper,2010-02-04T15:22Z,"This movie was great.....don't expect action scenes from it, but more the psychological side of the war in Irak....and what the bombsquad goes through."
,acid16v,2010-02-05T16:41Z,"Aewsome, Thanks!!!"
,camj,2010-02-17T02:29Z,"to confirm there are hard german subs - about 4 times, "

,cleo774,2010-03-08T13:27Z,"thanks for the update roskruge.

why do you think theres 732 leechers downloading it? coz its shit?"
,monotorr,2010-03-08T22:41Z,"Why when I download the file does it show as being 4.29GB ? Using Vuze and I'm on a macbook... is the file size the same for any of you people out there ?

Thx to uploader - no doubt about the quality from PS3 Team - but with FAT32 I can't put this on a USB...."
,monotorr,2010-03-09T01:25Z,ignore above... I realise Vuze is showing 1000kb as 1GB.. hopefully will transfer to USB drive when completed...
,monotorr,2010-03-09T01:54Z,"third comment, I know.... but I've just discovered that it's snow leopard now tells us that a gigabyte = 1,000,000,000 bytes...

What a ridiculous move by Apple... I was wondering why all of my downloaded file sizes were more than the torrent description...

Anyone know if Finder can be amended to show real binary capacity?"
,PM_ENG,2010-03-11T12:24Z,"guys how can i add a right to left subtitle to this? I used to have the AVI file in virtual dub, and burn the subtitle to the movie it self then put it in usb flash memory and run it in home theatere, but I don't want to drop the quality by doing that to High res movie who to do it?"
,dulac1980,2010-03-11T20:30Z,come on people please seed! everyone in my unit saw this 2 weeks ago! i feel left out :(

""so is this 1080p or 1080i? description is stupid. i think this file should have been 720p if it's 4gb. still waiting for someone to do a proper BR5 rip... ""

Check the resolution, dude. 1920*1080. It's obviously progressive, but you wouldn't know of such things, stupid."
,markxus,2010-03-20T01:05Z,hey i know this is 4 gig but my 4 gig flash drive only has 3.78 gig to copy to  can i compress files to make it fit on a flash drive? what do u guys recommend?

,jiggysiggy,2011-03-09T12:37Z,"warnung an alle deutschen nutzer!!! dieser torrent wird von der kriminellen abzocker-kanzlei ""waldorf und frommer"" Ã¼berwacht. mit dem download dieses films riskiert ihr eine abmahnung von 1000 euro. ehrlich gesagt ist dieser film eh ziemlich kacke, er ist es jedenfalls nicht wert dafuer geld auszugeben. wenn ihr den film unbedingt haben wollt dann holt ihn euch bei einem one-klick-hoster, dann kÃ¶nnen euch zumindest die waldorf-frommer-hurensÃ¶hne nichts anhaben."
