Also, if you enjoy this torrent, please let me know. I have invested a lot of time and energy into the creation of this compilation and I am unsure if I will continue these past the March edition since their popularity is on a severe decline. Again thanks. "
,Numskull808,2010-01-14T10:12Z,"I think the number of seeders is always a good indicator of how much people like it.  

Let me be the first to say thank for the up and thanks for the effort.  I'm check out your other torrents.
"
,ProDesignTeam,2010-01-14T15:35Z,"Hey thanks, and I don't currently have any other torrents on this account. I lost the password from my old account and can't remember the login info or even the email account since it was opened like 5 years ago, so I am starting fresh. Will have the January installment up soon though! "
,ProDesignTeam,2010-01-14T15:37Z,"ALSO: if you would like to hear more from a certain artist, please leave a comment and I will try to get more music from them posted, likewise, if you know someone you think is worthy of being on the list, let me know, all suggestions will be seriously considered! "

,tubeamp,2010-12-13T04:47Z,"opps, should have read the comments re: 2010 :)"
