ProDesign Productions Presents: Absolute Best Underground Hip Hop of 2009

Sick of hearing the same 20 songs in rotation over and over until your ears bleed and mind pops?

This 4 disc set includes many fine hip hop/rap/rnb independent artists that are significantly noteworthy for excellent lyricism, banging beats, or overall performance value. Due to the fact that all of these artists are not currently signed to any major record labels, some song's sound quality may not be "peak." The tracks were "briefly" remastered to "somewhat" normalize audio between tracks and remove as much "noise" as possible. However, due to the poor quality of some recordings this was not completely possible.

There you have it, 56 tracks of unsigned excellence. ProDesign would like to appologize for the hiatus and missing installments for November and December 2009, so we went all out for this 2010 opener and have a great line up for the January, February and March releases in advance. 

If you hear something that you like here please find these and other great artists onReverbNation.com, Stereofame.com, TheSixtyOne.com, Soundclick.com, Mixposure.com, and/or various other underground music networking locations.

These are truly struggling artists that really do need our support! Buying their CD's is one great way to do so, but even stopping by their artist pages on social networks and telling them what a great job they are doing will also go a long way. They are all working really hard and doing all they can to entertain you. Most of them at their own expense. So show some love!

As always all files are completely clean and there are no RAR or ZIP files (so there are no surprises). All files are in .WAV format for ease of use and near lossless conversion.
