The four-part series â€œThe Germanic Tribesâ€ shows the rise of the tribes of the North from a primitive culture on the fringe of Europe to becoming the heirs of the Roman Empire. â€œThe Germanic Tribesâ€ portrays the protagonist of an epoch of formative influence for Europe â€“ whose legacy is still with us. Due to new methods and discoveries, research is now able to present a different picture of the Germanic tribes. Many cliches about the â€œbarbariansâ€ of the North have to be discarded as myths!

â€œThrough its forests terrible, through its marshes horribleâ€, thus characterizes the Roman historian Tacitus â€œGermaniaâ€, the area incognita beyond the Rhine. The natives there, the Germanic Tribes, were not in fact primeval barbarians, nor were they heroic Wagnerian figures, and they were certainly not the progenitors of a racist weltanschauung.

How they actually did live, what Gods they worshipped, their combative and collaborative relationship with Rome, what they wrote in their runes and how they became Christians are all topics explored in the Gruppe 5 production â€œThe Germanic Tribes.
