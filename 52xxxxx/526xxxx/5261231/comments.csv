Having torrented The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion before, I can claim the filesize of the .iso to be approximately 6GB when uncompressed, and I have seen compressions  of ~70%. For this to be a valid compressed size, the compression would be ~0.15%.

Thus, my conclusion is either musitek227 has an excellent compression program, or has uploaded something other than The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. (just a warning to everyone)"
