,envypk,2010-01-06T01:26Z,Hey guys this torrent has 171 seeds and about 300 leechers it has 0 seeds here because i just uploaded it 
,Codi69,2010-01-15T02:50Z,What (roughly) is the bit rate for these songs? The file size divided by the number of files leads me to believe it's of poor quality :/
,envypk,2010-01-18T20:51Z,its actually one of the best i could find out there
,thesolcity,2010-02-02T21:28Z,"this is a good upload, but not as great as www.....nah im fucking with you man, but great upload nonetheless, many thanks :)"

,XRedWitchX,2010-04-27T15:26Z,"Hey thanks! Twas a pretty quick download, everything worked well for me. Seeding for sure :D"
,ingodi,2010-05-11T22:34Z,"227 seeders and 53 leechers? freakin' unbelivable... that's awesome, I will also seed when I'm done"
,TruCHoJiN,2010-05-31T04:30Z,"In case anyone actually wants to know....Over half the torrent is 128k, not even listenable. Stop seeding this low-quality garbage. The more you seed, the more this 128k crap gets spread around. (I guess if your listening through a 50 cent plastic speaker...it don't matter...)

Get Beneath The Encasing of Ashes, Frail Words Collapse, Shadows Are Security singly...
