In a Dystopian Mushroom Kingdom, corruption and avarice reign supreme. Even the greatest heroes of the land have buckled beneath the overwhelming will of the amoral elite. When a series of grisly crimes pushes an unlikely champion to seek the truth, a mystery unfolds that could completely destroy everything he holds dear.

There Will be Brawl, the internet sensation, is a darkly humorous mini-series satirizing the classic game heroes you thought you knew and loved.

This is by far one of the best independent series I have ever seen, and I have seen many.

All the episodes are in .mp4 format.

They were downloaded so I could have them on my Nintendo DS :-D

This series deserve alot of respect. And I hope that if this series gets released to DVD, that those of you who like/love the series, buy it. I most certainly will :-D.
