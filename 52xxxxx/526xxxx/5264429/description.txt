Blackalicious is an American hip hop duo made up of rapper Gift of Gab (born Tim Parker) and DJ/producer Chief Xcel (born Xavier Mosley). They are noted for Gift of Gab's often fast-paced, multi-syllabic, complex rhymes and Chef Xcel's diverse range of beats. The pair have released three full-length albums (1999's Nia, 2002's Blazing Arrow and 2005's The Craft).
