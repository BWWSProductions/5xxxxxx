A? V?"
,u2r1u4s3,2010-01-06T03:38Z,"4 seeders could u shed on some light about this post. Am waiting for better quality to DL.
Thanx."
,sdobson,2010-01-06T04:28Z,"Currently downloading will let everyone know the A/V

Hope it is a decent cam copy, now i know cam copy's aren't like dvdrips obviously lol but still i downloaded Avatar a couple weeks ago and the quality was almost like a dvdrip.

I just hope this not a fake."
,haidaboy,2010-01-06T04:49Z,"I have not gotten the full download yet, but this does look real.  It doesn't ask for codecs or have rars.  The initial footage is a cam.

I will update when the download completes."
,vietvet52,2010-01-06T05:35Z,it's real and nit a bad cam 
,vietvet52,2010-01-06T05:36Z,not a bad cam real imi real 
,c-sound,2010-01-06T05:43Z,"dling, will spill it when it finishes."
,sdobson,2010-01-06T05:43Z,"I have checked it out and it is not a fake, no winrar, no avi that leads you to purchase an X3 Player, etc this is a genuine copy.

So i have skipped through bits just to check the A/V and i gotta say 

A=7
V=6

It is watchable and the audio is clear to hear it so this at the moment is probably the best version you will get."
,RIggsta,2010-01-06T05:54Z,"4/10 for both, thanks anyways, ill wait"
,u2r1u4s3,2010-01-06T07:00Z,"Thanx 4 uploading IwannaFan2 and thanx guys for taking ur time yo let us know about the quality of the print.
This is why TPB is great and u guys r wonderful :)"
,bobshade,2010-01-06T08:34Z,"whoever shot this should get a camera that will shoot in widescreen. the aspect ratio is here is 4:3, it's dark and out of focus and the sound is just bad. will i watch it...sure but only because it's here"
,bobshade,2010-01-06T08:46Z,"i was wrong, it's too messed up to watch."
,Remypunk84,2010-01-06T09:54Z,"Don't waste your time, this is a horrible quality. Patience is worth it in this case."
,haidaboy,2010-01-06T10:40Z,"This is real.  Sadly it's not too good quality, but still we should thank the uploader for providing what we have.

At least he is an honest uploader and didn't spam us with useless garbage."
,abius,2010-01-06T13:52Z,"to all of u who say,dont download tis,gimme a break guys..its been 2 long week since the movies release and clearly this is the best we've had..

,zohotar,2010-01-06T14:00Z,"thanks for this! I think that this movie is really good and copy makes a difference, however, I will seed cos some people want to watch this movie badly, I'm one of them
V5/S6

best to all"
,zohotar,2010-01-06T14:01Z,V5/A6 
,Untouchablebrent,2010-01-06T22:46Z,"Best copy so far........video - 6/7 and audio - 8/9. When it begins, it has a someone making some noticeable adjustments, after that, the movie is very loud and clear."
,Tallyortoby,2010-01-06T23:43Z,"sadosex cuz boorek.com is a shit site that wants you to take surveys, register for freelotto and crap like that... know why now."
,pumpedup,2010-01-07T01:02Z,not the best but at least it wasn't pitch black ;-)
,sdobson,2010-01-07T01:10Z,"To all those moaning about the quality, what are you expecting? A dvdrip?!

If you want to see a perfect copy either wait for a dvdrip or go to the cinema to see it and stop moaning and be grateful someone point up a reasonable copy of Sherlock Holmes."
,willdenow,2010-01-07T01:25Z,"To all of those ""dying"" to see this movie, why not support the movie maker and shell out a few bucks to see it in the theater?  Most cams are  crap and certainly don't give you any impression regarding the quality of the movie.  I know swhat it's like to be short on funds, but that doesn't make me a cheap bastard.  Stop your moaning and shell out if you really ""need"" to see the movie.  Otherwise, wait a few months for the inevitable DVD rip to show up.  Sheesh!"
,bonnsn_08,2010-01-07T15:30Z,"This comment is for all uploaders ,please try to include a sample file for the movie which give a clear view than file r format info."
,dabadoo306,2010-01-07T23:08Z,"decent CAM quality, near the end of the film expect rustle noises, zipping up, clothe sounds etc.  A good torrent, with okay sound and video.  better than others that are out there..."
,dardar6t9,2010-01-08T00:50Z,"To Angel40204.....I know what ya mean,,,Dont ya hate those pricks that tell ya crap like that and 1.waste ur bandwidth. 2.waste ur time and 3.Probably infect ur pc.....and not forgetting .4.JUST PISS YA RIGHT OFF.

,piLLz2k,2010-01-08T17:14Z,wtf is x3 player i can tell already this vid going to suck badly so x3player full of worms virus malware backdoors
,sdobson,2010-01-08T18:59Z,"It's funny how people are saying its fake,  and need to enter addresses, etc,  when i downloaded it and watched the final half an hour of it with no trouble or throughout the whole film. 

It's good quality for a cam with good audio."
,robrad,2010-01-08T20:24Z,no comments? xD
,stackz666,2010-01-08T23:32Z,I will say its very watchable and since no one else has done better This is the best copy out there
,mandathewitch,2010-01-09T02:11Z,This is more like a 4/10 at best... and only because of the audio. The video quality is barely watchable.  And the constant adjustments to the camera are really annoying.  The only way you can actually watch this is in small resolution... i guess better this than nothing though.
,coke025,2010-01-09T15:20Z,"Just got it, only took an hour and a half. Watchable.  V/5 A/4  Thanks a lot for your work, don't think I'll burn it just yet."
,anlsh,2010-01-10T07:53Z,"Suggest you not to watch this version

Wait for TS releases or better

This has horrible visual quality but decent audio"
,SuperWurm,2010-01-11T22:38Z,"this is a fake

it shows a compilation of scenes from earlier Sherlock Holmes movies in a terrible CAM alike qualitity"
