Go Further (R. Mann, 2003)-aNaRCHo

Ron Mann (Grass) documents Woody Harrelson and a group of his Hippy friends and Activists on their journey across California, on bikes and in their 60's inspired hemp-oil fueled "spirit bus", to promote environmentalism, biofuel, organic farming, veganism, hemp & marijuana, yoga and showing how a small group of people can make an inspirational difference when it comes to changing minds and countering the destructive habits that humanity has come to develop.

I'll end with one of my favourite quotes, from Jung: 

"Our rationalistic attitude leads us to believe we can work wonders with international organizations, legislation, and other well-meant devices. But in reality only a change in the attitude of the individual can bring about a renewal in the spirit of nations. Everything begins with the individual."

PLEASE SEED AND ENJOY!!!
