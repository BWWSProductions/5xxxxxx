,ThePalindorme,2010-05-08T17:05Z,"Somebody please tell me how to make such small awesome quality avi files!!

This is probably the best torrent of dragon ball available on net.
Dunno if its uncensored or not. If you can tell, please do, but..... Who cares!!
you get the entire series, and in 8 gb, even from storage point of view, its the best. Quality and size, the best.

MY thanks to whoever made it and you to upload it. AWESOME!!!
smallest torrent with maximum quality. If you download any other dragon ball torrent, you are a moron."
