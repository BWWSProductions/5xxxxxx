I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

*** FYI there is a asshole/coward who is leaving a bunch of negative [-] ratings on my torrents, so rate this one the way you see it [I'm sure Mule fans will love it] *** "

Your regular downloaders won't be put off by the negative quality rating, but must be very galling to you?  Why don't they actually write their comments so we can view their beef?  

Spineless gits."
[V],smbdownload,2010-01-09T01:07Z,"thanks 214 - I'm not worry about it anymore - they leave multiple [-] even before I actually complete 1 upload ?? 

I have this in FLAC and might put it up - but if people want it in FLAC they can find it at other sites - 

peace brother"
