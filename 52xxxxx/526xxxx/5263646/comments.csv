[V],Slickinator,2010-01-07T07:12Z,"there is not ,its a false positive trust me its fine its just getting detected because of being what it is a patch= hack tool = make full version  most likely it is shown as a generic or gen trojan which is why they put gen in front its just a name they try to give it as its not a real virus ,trust me its ok most virus scanners are nailing clean files just because of what it is and does"
