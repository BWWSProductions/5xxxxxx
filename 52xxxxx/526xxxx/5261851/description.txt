Lane Meyer is obsessed with his girlfriend Beth and is crushed when she falls for the new captain of the ski team, Roy. 
After several failed suicide attempts, narrow escapes from the relentless paper boy, and nearly unbearable dinners 
at home with his crazy family, Lane finds a new love in French exchange student Monique Junot. Meanwhile, 
he must beat Roy on the slopes to regain his honor.
