,FlashlightTaylor,2010-02-06T02:04Z,"Nice, but all the rudeness in the description really wasn't necessary. People are gonna have questions and if you don't feel like answering them, maybe you shouldn't upload.

Thanks, but grow up."

,rollyshka,2010-03-19T22:46Z,"ok i don't know if the expansion pack of nexus named ""hands up electro bass vol. 1&2"" was trully released, but i must tell you that i have them but they don't work with this vers. of nexus. what's the problem? the nexus or the expansion packs? the error says something like ""Acces violation at adress... bla bla bla"" plz help a little brother who's a producer like all of ya."
,-rens-,2010-04-01T15:18Z,"I cant get it to work. No doubt I am the reason. There just aint a file i can open. No .exe. All i can open is the setup, wich after installing gives you nothing. Except the uninstall.exe. So, don't know what went wrong but I got the idea files are missing."
,kokapelli,2010-04-13T21:58Z,"Får inte min Nexus 2 setup.exe att funka. Då jag startar upp det kommer det upp en ""fel""ruta. Det står bland annat: Cannot import XXXX\XXXX\XXXX\XXXX\XXXX\WaterLib.dll
Har sökt omkring om problemet fast funnit inga svar. Skulle uppskatta svar. Tack"
,generation91,2010-04-17T12:53Z,"I doubt I am the only one to have an impossible series of problems. So if anyone can help it would be nice:

I am using Mixcraft 5(beta) which means I use a folder called VST inside Program Files. 

I have several versions of NEXUS installed.

I have tried uninstalling each and then installing Nexus 2. 

For some weird reason it seems that the software does not install the content the right way. (the content are all NXS files and not NXP, which makes sense (just to point out))

Anyhow it seems that although I take out the expansions (basically I erase the NEXUS 1 content) I am then at the stage of installing nexus 2 with the weird upbeat music :P

At that stage I pick full installation and it leads to a successful installing.

Then I open Mixcraft 5 and I enter my VST. I open Nexus2.

Most of my nexus 1 expansions are there for some reason.  ( incl psytrance; stereo skystarphonics something _> seriously

Anyways if I figure out ill try to help, if not help me (us) out."
,generation91,2010-04-17T12:57Z,"ah my message was too long so it got cut; anyways: in a nutshell my problem is: 

Nexus 1 content seems to still be there / I checked all and erased everything possible but its still annoyingly there.

Nexus2 points out missing NXS files every now and then. 

Would be nice to solve this issue thx.

Last: should there be a NXP expansion that could fix this?"
,enchanted123,2010-04-25T15:27Z,can someone please put this up for the mac version?
,Xris22,2010-05-22T16:30Z,"Heh... thanks for the download, but....

And I agree with FlashlightTaylor completely... no need for the badmouthing just because you're uploading.  Get some perspective and a mouthwash into your life.  Grow up and stop calling ppl you've never met nOObs ('hate that word!)

Most of the nOObs I've ever met that might actually deserve the title, have usually been around the www a long time, think they know it all and have total total contempt for all around them.

Me?  I'm a nOOb too... I've only been using the net since the ARPA days (if you don't know what that is Pro, check it out)

Sigh...."
,Xris22,2010-05-23T11:22Z,"For those who generally have problems with Nexus xp's

1 - Some kind of (presets only) loader, usually an .EXE, e.g  reFX_GUITARS.EXE.  You would normally run this first which loads the scripts into your VSTi folder.

2 - The actual expansion files with in-built license-key. This is always an NXP file.  You import this from INSIDE Nexus, using the SYS/IMPORT feature, then guide the program to where your NXP file is.  e.g. \DESKTOP\reFX.GUITARS.NXP

Then it's available in the Nexus Library section."
,Coolspike,2010-06-11T20:22Z,Can someone upload the mac-version..??!!..it would be great..!! thanx..!!
,james2189,2010-06-17T18:33Z,Theres a Trojan attached to it. AVG caught it. You're a tool.
,DrEaMlEsS,2010-06-24T18:46Z,"sooo you say LEAVE NO BAD COMMENTS ABOUT INFO'S, IF YOU'RE A NOOB, THAT IS NOT MY PROBLEM.

This is originally posted by team air on demonoid, but I felt like the world needs this.

,Phobea,2010-07-16T10:36Z,"Ok. So i\'ve downloaded the torrent in 2 hours. Now, when I go to the Nexus Setup.exe, I get a message saying, Cannot Import C:\\XXXX\\XXXX\\XXXX\\XXXX\\WaterLib.dll.nnHow can I get around this problem? Thanks."
