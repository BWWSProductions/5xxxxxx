Album information

Joel Houston was quoted saying:

"Beyond the sound, the rhythm, the art... beyond the strings, the keys, the melodies... beyond the stage, the set, the lights... are the PEOPLE. Ordinary men, women & children, from all walks of life, in all sorts of circumstances and each one with a unique story to tell. This is the Church... and this is Hillsong's 18th Live praise and worship album 'faith+hope+love'. EveryONE together playing their part and lending their voice to the collective story, OUR story. The prayer is that 'Faith+Hope+Love' will breathe the light, love and freedom of Christ into your life, and continue to give expression to what God is doing in and through PEOPLE all over the Earth."[cite this quote]

The songs "You Hold Me Now" and "No Reason to Hide" are also featured on the latest Hillsong United album Across the Earth: Tear Down the Walls, released May 2009.

This is the first Hillsong Live album that does not feature worship leader Marty Sampson since "Touching Heaven Changing Earth" in 1998.
