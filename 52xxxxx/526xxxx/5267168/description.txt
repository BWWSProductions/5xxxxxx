There is another copy of this in MP4 format circulating, but I wasn't pleased with the quality. I took the existing HQ .mkv copy and converted it to .mp4 using Handbrake. The resulting copy comes in at less than 4gb with very good quality. There are not many noticeable artifacts in this copy. I hope you enjoy this 4 hour program as much as I did.
