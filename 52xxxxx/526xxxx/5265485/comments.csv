,KnightOwl70,2010-02-21T08:44Z,"This is the ""Mole Hunt"" episode.  According to IMDB and TVRage, ""Mole Hunt"" is the first episode."
,S3nd41,2010-06-12T00:28Z,"Yeah, Mole Hunt is the first episode, not the second, this is all wrong."
,Saki33,2010-12-31T17:11Z,"Agreed. Mole Hunt is the first episode, according to tv.com. The ""real"" first episode is the unaired pilot which is available on the dvd. This could be that episode:

,Saki33,2010-12-31T20:31Z,"BUT, there is probably a very good reason the pilot, s01e00, was never aired. It no doubt scored even worse on the suckometer scale than this one. Believe me, if it were even half good Fox would have aired it. I am almost curious enough to see how bad it is by downloading it--not."
