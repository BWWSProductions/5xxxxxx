,mountbiking,2010-01-28T17:49Z,"thanks for doing this work, however i am having trouble switching the city from Newville Iowa. do you have any suggestions?"
,cloves09,2010-02-04T23:02Z,Error on launch.
,Online666,2010-06-11T23:09Z,"The HVAC-Calc Residential 4.0.45 is not successfully cracked.  User CAN NOT modify the ""Design Condition"" setting.  The built in condition is a default ""Newville,"" Iowa.  Therefore, it only works as a trial version.  Anybody get the same problem?"
,socom_1,2010-06-19T02:29Z,"it seem to be only a trial, and the commercial side seem to warn its a trojan ?? i states its registerd but wont do the calc reports"
,StealWill,2010-10-12T23:43Z,"This one doesn't work, it is complete POS. Now if someone can get the latest version, website says there is no copy protection on it, so it should be possible."
,peebee2,2011-07-25T14:29Z,"This is definitely a virus. It replaces several VB runtime libraries and drops an ActiveX control on the machine. Also attempts to disable DCOM, modify Event Logging, etc. Even though the author claims this is clean IT IS NOT."
,piratery,2012-06-09T18:18Z,"If anybody can share a completely clean version of HVAC-Calc Residential / Commercial with the crack - or precracked version, it would be GREATLY appreciated!  Check my uploads for other various HVAC materials."
