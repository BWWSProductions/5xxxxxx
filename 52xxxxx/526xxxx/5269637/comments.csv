I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

*** FYI there is a asshole/coward who is leaving a bunch of negative [-] ratings on my torrents, so rate this one the way you see it [I'm sure Brother fans will love it] *** "

This show, and the other shows on 19th, 27th and 28th of March are terrific."
[V],smbdownload,2010-01-09T03:59Z,"actually I up'd that one back then - I deleted the torrent and it stays as Anonymous on TPB tracker, but that one is from a different source is is the 19, 27 and 28th - they are Moogis transcodes. The one's I'm upping now are Munck - OFFICIAL ABB SBD and a much better quality - enjoy these great shows"
