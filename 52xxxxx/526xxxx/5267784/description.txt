The Pharaoh Who Conquered the Sea

Over three thousand years ago, legend has it that Queen Hatshepsut, 
Egypt's first female pharaoh, sent a fleet of ships to the wonderful, 
distant land of Punt. A bas-relief in the temple where she is entombed 
in Luxor shows them bringing back extraordinary treasures. 
But did this expedition really happen? And if it did, where exactly is the land of Punt?

Drawing upon recent finds, the archaeologist Cheryl Ward sets out to recreate the voyage, in a full-size replica of one of these ancient ships, sailing it in the wake  of Hatshepsut's fleet, in search of the mythical land of Punt. 
A human adventure as well as a scientific challenge, the expedition proves that, contrary to popular belief, the ancient Egyptians had the necessary tools,science and techniques to sail the seas.
