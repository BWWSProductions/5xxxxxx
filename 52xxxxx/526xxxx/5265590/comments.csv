[T],zeromancer,2010-01-07T18:23Z,"Ye, the awesome Apple TV that doesn't allow you to watch 1080p.

Bitrate here is crap, 1900 kbps is too little for a 720p movie."
[T],zeromancer,2010-01-07T18:25Z,"Audio 3 (External):
Channels: AAC 5.1
Bitrate: 448 Kbps
(for Sony PS3, WDTV or Popcorn Hour)
----------------------------------------------

Why would you have this as a extra soundtrack when the ps3, wdtv and popcorn hour all support AC3 ??"

,krillert,2010-01-07T20:49Z,"Apple TV supports 5.1 sound as well.. Dont know what alla this is about. If you have two or three different sound tracks in a m4v container you can choose sound source on you Apple TV.

Just press and hold the Play button on playback and you will be able to choose sound and subtitles.
