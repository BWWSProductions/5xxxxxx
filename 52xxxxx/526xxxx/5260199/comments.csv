Does it support x64, you know x64 needs a special crack for Crysis, there is no 1.2.1 x64 for Crysis right now"
,Fluffytiger,2010-01-11T11:32Z,"Worst edition, ever, at least for me.

Graphics looks weird, all purple and pink. The videos lag horribly. I can't move around, even look around with a mouse - can only look forward. Space button works, and Esc for menus.

Thanks, but no thanks."

,idie970,2010-10-16T05:59Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!!! i got it all downloaded, and right when my antivirus got done scanning it, it said there were 4 viruses in the  .7z file."
,Spartan116,2010-11-09T21:49Z,hey i recently downloaded your torrent and after i am done with the seven steps i double click on crysis 1 in bin but it just won't open the start menu of the game. The screen becomes black the mouse  turns green and the music starts to play but that's all. It happens to all 3 of them. 
,Spartan116,2010-11-09T21:56Z,"the only things that got wrong were : 1. I couldn't install CryEngine(R)2 Sandbox(TM)2 it says ''error 3003?? log on as administrator  '' . Where to log on? 2. Witch is the main folder and 3. When i run the converters it loads it for a while and then nothing happens , is that how it should be??"
,unit56,2011-02-15T16:45Z,"does multiplayer crysis wars work??

thanks"
,superbryan,2011-03-28T21:03Z,"first off, who-ever wrote the instructions obviously does not speak english as their given language. Either that or they dropped out of school in grade 7 or 8. 
 Secondly, after kind of understanding what the instructions wanted, I have to agree with one of the first posters. 
 AVG found 4 trojan viruses, but thats usually the crack itself, so I ignored them and went on with the installation.  
 All I really wanted was Crysis 1, I have a legit copy of Wars and Warhead, but the video was sooooo laggy in the beginning and the opening shots looked like Doom almost they were so bad! 
 I highly recommend that you -don't- download this one, and download a torrent where the instructions are written in understandable english and perhaps where they can make a decent copy of the video or music. 
 Nice try, but lots of work to do in the future.
