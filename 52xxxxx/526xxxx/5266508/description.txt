Iranian Kayhan Kalhor is internationally renowned for his magic with the kamancheh (a Persian spiked fiddle). Brooklyn Rider is a string quartet based in New York City but with an international reputation as well. 

This collaboration has it's roots in musical friendships formed at Tanglewood in 2000, where musicians had gathered for Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Project. A trip to Iran followed in 2004, and then three of the pieces were developed in 2005-2008. Arrangement of the longest piece, "Silent City" (29:10) was commissioned by the Carnegie Hall Corporation.
