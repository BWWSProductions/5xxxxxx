This is my sixth burn.  Trying to find one with a key that works.  If you've got a good key that would help me."
,kithylin,2010-01-17T20:38Z,"Are you getting this problem from my release? Because i've used this ISO in 20 different computers recently, twice on my file server and repeatedly in virtual machines, it's never failed for me yet.

The key for this one is embedded in the installer, i can try and dig it out i suppose...

maybe a little later today."
,radoi,2010-02-15T14:59Z,"install worked flawlessly; no problems with updates.
thanks kithylin !!!"
,markie308509,2010-06-18T11:48Z,Hi - i have just downloaded this torrent and it worked 100% but however its asking me for a password for Administrator. Please can you tell me how i cn either bypass that or can u give me the password.  Thank you
,hitesh005,2010-06-19T23:40Z,"markie308509-  Please read the info above again. It says -
The default Administrator account password is ""atomic"" without quotes.

,kithylin,2010-09-20T17:36Z,"I just used n-lite and removed keyboards and language support for anything not-english, you can still download the language support packages via windows update if you really need them for another language.  Doing this removed about 300mb or so from the installation package, which is now able to fit on a standard CD-R image."

,kjimcws,2011-09-10T03:12Z,"i installed this perfectly no hustle, but i can't access my network files. My network setting is active because i have access on the internet. Can anyone help me please. I'll appreciate it much! Thanks by the way uploader!"
,sasawatc,2011-09-29T05:04Z,"hey kithylin, after I install this OS, I can't access my files via network (ex: \\192.168.1.253) it let me input my User and Pass and after I did it, it keep on say wrong sth like that. Any solution?"
,kithylin,2012-02-19T12:55Z,"@sasawatc: I had an account problem and couldn't get logged into TPB for a long time.  But anyway, No I'm not sure, this torrent works perfectly for me, perhaps you should try the service pack(s) and check your network configuration."
,cowell_theodore,2012-03-16T20:48Z,"Everything works great! What I did was first I completely erased windows by installing Red Hat Linux, then I popped in the CD and rebooted and windows server installed just fine!  When I had windows already installed the disk wouldn't boot. I don't know why this fixed the problem. Anyone care to explain.  And remember the password is atomic."
,ixjzmwn,2012-05-14T00:36Z,the psw atomic is not working
