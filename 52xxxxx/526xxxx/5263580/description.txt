Windows 2003 Server R2 SP2 Enterprise Edition (x86)

Install Notes: 

*This is a "Corporate" version with a legit key. That means no activations after installation, and it passes all current WPA, WGA and Windows Update checks.

However, this operating system NEVER was originally released on DVD, and it is NOT intended to be burned as such, It's supposed to be a 700mb standard CD image.

There fore, i've re-nlite'd his download, and removed all non-english keyboard and language support, and brought it down to 600mb and it now fits on a standard cd image, as the OS is intended to be.

The cd-key is slip-streamed into it, and this package comes with Sp2 pre-loaded.

Nothing else was added to this.

I've mounted the image with MagicISO and run a virus scan through it with AVG set to "Scan all files" and the result is here:

The default Administrator account password is "atomic" without quotes.
