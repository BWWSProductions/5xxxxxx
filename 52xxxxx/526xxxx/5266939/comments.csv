,sdevo,2010-01-08T07:22Z,"Just another plug for FLAC uploads. It is great to see that miona45 has given us the opportunity to hear Joan uncompressed and in full dynamic voice.
It gives downloaders a chance to burn a CD and play this album in all its purity. And, you can easily convert FLAC to mp3, AAC or ALAC for your iPod if you need. 
I know all uploaders don't have the bandwidth or face download limits. But it's nice to see FLAC. Thanks again."
