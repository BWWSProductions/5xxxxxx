**************************************************************

1- Norton Internet Security: Clean.

The  av scan result of Kaspersky is a false positive due to some 
used binaries and cryptors. So just stay cool or don't use this!!!"
,Sven the swede,2010-01-06T14:14Z,"Oh, I did not know that Revo Uninstaller changed from freeware to non-free software. Revo Uninstaller used to be the only uninstaller that was actually well researched, not just a copy of the Windows uninstall feature with a registry cleaner. The problem was that many of these programs were so badly developed that they where dangerous. Revo Uninstaller worked great, but it had two big drawbacks though, it was not 64-bit compatible and not fully compatible with Windows 7. The new version corrects these drawbacks. I'm downloading it right away to give it a try. "

There already were Pro versions of Revo Uninstaller.However, just recently there are cracks 
for the Pro version, so probably that's why only the free versions are/were at TPB.

 n00b question - i know but ive seen how sometimes for some things its suggested ....
"
,tore-up,2010-01-12T01:56Z,"sorry - i forgot ....
thank you - of course for this RobbingHood.
much respect."
,jg4545,2010-01-13T17:11Z,"Thanks for the upload RH.  Your're one of the best uploaders.  So how long does the trial period work for?  You didn't mention this in the readme file.
Also do i need to uninstall the free version?
Thanks again."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-01-14T05:51Z,"@tore-up & @jg4545

Probably the pro version can be installed besides the free version as they have two different installers (and features). The trial reset just resets the trial days. "

,narfdude,2010-01-18T19:11Z,"thanks robbin, works great
