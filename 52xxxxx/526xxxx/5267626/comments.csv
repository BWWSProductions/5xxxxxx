[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-08T18:36Z,"not sure if its clear or not, but i used the quadrophonic mix of Dark Side of the Moon, and not the regular cd or vinyl versions :D please leave comments!"
,Christian777,2010-01-09T15:01Z,"Sounds interesting, you made this yourself from the original master tape?"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-09T17:23Z,"more or less, i used the bluray copy of OZ that was on the pirate bay already, and i ripped the 5.1 mix of dark side, off of a dvd-audio disc (check ciscokid) so it's the best versions of both the video and the audio. and it's syncd properly aswell :D"
,Christian777,2010-01-09T18:35Z,"I will be looking forward to it, then :) By the way its 4.1 not 5.1, the original master tapes where quadraphonic as you said (4.0). The remix filtered the bass out and mixed it into a separate channel.

Haven't finished loading it yet but will get back to you and tell you how I like it :)"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-09T18:53Z,"you're right about the 4.1 and not 5.1, only i actually matched the front left and right channels into a fifth center channel so it's 5.1 in this version :D"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-11T13:20Z,... so what does everybody think? comments are appriciated :)

,chuchunesme,2010-01-22T04:56Z,"Wow, the quality of the video and audio is amazing! I've listened to Dark Side of the Moon at least a million times and I'm hearing things in this recording I've never heard! I'm not knocking your work, it looks like the audio track might run a little later in relation to the movie..... at least the other copy I've seen of this has the songs starting at different times. In the one I saw the song Money started right as she opened the door to the house and you saw color."
[V],HMVinyl,2010-02-06T03:26Z,"yeah small problem with the 2nd half, but who cares really? lol most of the ""sync-ups"" happen with the first half anyways lol. someone uploaded a 1080p wizard of oz, the links for the dark side master tapes are in the discription so if someone wants to 1-up me, go ahead :D"
