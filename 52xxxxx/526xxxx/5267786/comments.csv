,AtineaN,2010-01-08T12:40Z,Thank you so much for this!
,cinderella92,2010-01-08T18:51Z,I can't install the first the second and the third stuff . :(( Please help me .
,simsandwhich,2010-01-08T21:59Z,"@cinderella92 What exactly is your problem? Have you run it through the compressorisor?

If you have the latest patch (1.8/2.3), then you are likely to have some problems with the official installer.  You could use a program to extract the .package and place it in your game like any other mod."
,HugDopey,2010-01-09T10:49Z,@simssandwhich I can't install Old Town Set and Lunar New Year either and I have no update installed (since installing WA)
,simsandwhich,2010-01-09T10:57Z,"Have you tried the compressorizor? If that fails, use Delphy's MultiInstaller to convert the .sims3pack files into .package files which you can chuck in your /mods folder :)

Just google the tools for links"
,HugDopey,2010-01-09T14:17Z,"@simsandwhich I've tried that and it still won't install.

Any ideas on what I can try next (besides buying them :P)"
,NerdyGirl88,2010-01-15T21:52Z,"I'm trying to install the Gothique andFanciful Fashion and hairstyles sets, but it's not working, and I can't figure out the compressor thing. Can anyone help me? Please email me @ Rose_Mary_88@live.ca

Thank you very much :)"
,cenoviA,2010-02-22T13:45Z,"Only the Gothique set seems to show up in my game. I used Delphy's MultiInstaller (thanks to simsandwich) to get the .PACKAGE files from the .PACKs because I was also getting an error about updating when trying to install. I have WA installed patched to the latest v2.3. 

Also, the game loads INCREDIBLY slow now. It's probably all the crap it's trying to load from my hard drive because my processor and graphics card are way better than what's needed for this game. 

TS3 seems to suck balls in this respect because I had modded TS2 to all hell with over 2 gigs of custom content and that didn't load as slow as this game does, especially after installing WA. "
,dribblez,2010-02-28T08:56Z,"So after i fully patched i had the same problems where only certain items would show i used.
http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=364038
extracted the store items to Mod/packages (not my doc)

then used
http://forum.jfade.com/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=468 on mod/packages (not my doc)

My game isn't slow and all Store downloaded items now work =D
Also make sure you delete all content in mydoc/sims/downloads and dcbackup
(just make sure you dont extract riverveiw to the mods package)"
,kakes311,2010-03-03T04:56Z,"I have a mac and when I tried to run my game after installing the most recent updates all of the store content I had downloaded was gone.  I tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling, and then tried to use this download.  The custom content, like patterns, show up in the game totally fine, but anything else from the store won't install.  Because I have a mac I can't seem to figure out a way to just download specific updates rather than them all.  I am also pretty computer illiterate, so I can't figure out how to make this work!  Any advice? Pretty please??"
,Neelg,2010-09-06T16:47Z,ok now where's this Mod folder u ppl are talking about... wait... is this a folder at all?? well if it is i'd like help finding it :)
