Plot: A sharp observation on the perils, pitfalls and wrong turns of romance in the 21st century. Aspiring journalist Dan expected so much more after graduationâ€¦ but with no leads, little motivation and a girlfriend who would rather cosy up to her boss in the office, itâ€™s not exactly as he planned. In a bid to get his life back on track and coerced by his womanizing flatmate, Dan is introduced to the al fresco sex scene that is DOGGING. Encountering an array of weird and wonderful characters looking for their dubious highs, it soon becomes clear that the scene is ripe for an expose. Dropping his inhibitions in the name of research, Dan becomes a reluctant pawn on the car park circuit, where he meets Laura and the totally unexpected happens.
