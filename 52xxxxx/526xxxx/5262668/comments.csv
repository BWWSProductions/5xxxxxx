,nj473,2010-01-06T17:07Z,"Hi HR sorry to bother you with this, (especially as i am commenting on your latest torrent about a different subject, apologies for that), but could if you have the time could you take a look at my comment i have left about the Windows Piz encoding?

Thanks"
,krillert,2010-01-06T17:20Z,Great upload thanks alot.. Been waiting for this :D
,krillert,2010-01-06T20:52Z,"B) Is my vote. Dont have a 5.1 system anyway so doesnt matter to me.

One can always add the 5.1 sound later if you want. Not that hard with mp4."
,Stargazer71,2010-01-06T21:17Z,Happy New Year HR - Hope you had a fab crimbo too. Is there any chance of you uploading some girly flicks (have you got any John Hughes - some kind of wonderful) ..it is January and it IS miserable and snowy!!!. Thanks
,coolove23,2010-01-06T21:20Z,"dude i seriously want in 5.1 coz i have it but will it play on standalone dive player???

i have philips dvp3996"
,krillert,2010-01-06T22:07Z,"@ Trolkan whats in the Torrents doesnt really matter. I think its nice that he has MP4BOX and pics in there.

And HRÂ´s rips are allready pretty exclusive since there arnt any other uploaders with rips with such great quality and sound AND works with Apple products.

There are loads of BRRips and H.264 uploaders out there but not as good as these. Most are pretty unstable and badly put togehter.

Personally i think these are the best rips and best converted BRRips out there. "
,ralphvin,2010-01-06T22:13Z,Hi HolyRoses....can you do a rip for PSP of the same movie (Pandorum). Thx anyways for ur awesome rips.
,Singh-Iz-King,2010-01-06T22:22Z,will u do the rest of the pirates of the Caribbean films
,krillert,2010-01-07T01:53Z,"Dont know about anyone else but this one behaved really odd on my ATV. Couldnt stream it cus it lost connection all the time and when i transfered it to the ATV it lagged many times when watching.

Tested some of the other movies and it all worked fine with stream and on the atv.

Bad framerate? Maybe the sourcefile was badly ripped. 

Just wanted to share my two cents."
,krillert,2010-01-07T03:56Z,"@HolyRoses I did all what you said before i read this post. As i said before none of the other movies (yours and others) behaves like this, only this moive eaven native..

 Its not much but it stutter at some ponits (playing native) in the movie when alot of fast movements are going on. Streaming it was impossible due to the lagging made the connection drop.

No the Apple TV was not hot since i just plogged it in before watching this.

Anyway i got to see this movie and all was great. Maybe my ATV just had a bad day.

Keeop up the good work.
Cheers
"
,krillert,2010-01-07T20:40Z,"Ok sounds like a real pain.. Didnt mean to caus any problem so sorry for that. :P

But where it drops in connection totally and doesnt really come back is around 32 -33 min. 

All worked native tho with some stutter, but i guess its just the apple tv thats abit sensative.

Im on the latest OS. 3 something. But never mind this now :P Its no biggy.

Hope you manage to find the old Star Wars triology XD"
,Internet-Thief,2010-01-08T18:18Z,"i there HolyRoses Many thanks for the upload. I've downloaded both versions for different purposes.

I was wondering if you could kindly tell me in laymans terms how to fix the audio in the other one by running the command mkvmerge -o fix2-pndm.mkv --language 1:eng --sync 2:+250 f-pndm.mkv --track-order 0:2,0:1?

Many Thanks"
,yubious,2010-01-24T20:44Z,"HolyRoses! love your work, but can you tell me why is it when i convert the videos to include the 5.1 sound, playback on my ps3 has no sound?!
the original files are fine as 2.0, but would like to get the 5.1 to work..."
,dzver666,2011-02-19T18:51Z,c'mon guys seed.... tnx...
