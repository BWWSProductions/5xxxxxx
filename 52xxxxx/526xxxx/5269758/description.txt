While itâ€™s easy enough to comprehend the mechanical building blocks of a synthesizer â€“ the filter, envelopes, oscillators and so on â€“ itâ€™s much harder to understand how to successfully combine these ingredients to create a finished sound. All too often, a first attempt at sound design involves a few tentative tweaks to an existing preset or blindly adjusting parameters until something sounds â€˜rightâ€™ â€“ often leading to a sound that lacks both character and definition. By contrast, the skill and experience of a good sound designer enables them to draw on a palette of key sounds and effects, each of which can be fine tuned to match the musical objective in mind.
