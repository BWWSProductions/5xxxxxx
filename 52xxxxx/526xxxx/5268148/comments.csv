,jz28,2010-01-09T03:34Z,yes.. this is not a bootable ISO. 
,quaidbilal,2010-01-09T07:55Z,All windows setup required bootable disk. Would you please explain how to run setup.
,brandonherson,2010-01-09T09:25Z,"thank u for the 32bit, but i needed 64bit and only nice place i found which i downloaded with no problems is from

smartDloDl.com/school.php  just delete the two ""D""s

anwyays just wanted to share maybe someone is looking for 64bit version also. "
,jz28,2010-01-09T10:56Z,"@quaidbilal - if you have an exisiting windows OS (XP or Vista), then just extract the contents of this download to a folder and then run the setup, follow the onscreen instructions and minutes later you will have Windows 7 as your OS.

All your files and data from ur old OS will be saved on to a directory in the C drive as ""windows.old"".

Hope this is clear!!! - Jz"
,jz28,2010-01-09T10:57Z,"@brandonherson - I've got the 64bit version as well, will be out with that torrent in couple of days, thot its better to start with 32bit as many people would download ds ;-)"

thanks"
,jz28,2010-01-09T14:20Z,"@miron1421 - you can use any extracting software (winrar, i would recommend). Extract the files to a folder and run the setup, the rest you will figure out. "
,Garanthil,2010-01-09T16:40Z,Does it really work properly ?
,jz28,2010-01-09T17:31Z,"@garanthil - yes, it does work. It's a genuine torrent :P"

,Haveitall,2010-01-26T07:01Z,Hey I downloaded and extracted this for an upgrade.  But it gives the option of x64 and x86. I chose the lowest. The installation stops giving me a prompt saying that i need a 32 bit version. That is what I thought the version was. Any help?
,bishowraj,2010-01-26T08:34Z,Does it have 32 bit option to activate or not? Moreover what about the activation windows? Does it ask?
,jz28,2010-01-26T09:13Z,"@haveitall 

To install 32bit you should select x86 option and for 64bit - x64. So try with x86 n it will work.

@bishowraj - it doesn't ask for any windows activation and 32bit(x86) is self activated. so dont hav to worry about activating."

,Underwhater,2010-01-29T22:08Z,is this going to require Windows 7 product key? like in a month or maybe year 2011? no?
,Underwhater,2010-01-29T22:14Z,"can I upgrade from Vista Home Basic to 7 Ultimate? I ran the Windows 7 upgrade advisor and it says: You can upgrade to 32-bit Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate.

,kh87,2010-01-31T19:53Z,"hey guys..got a few questions here
first - has anyone figured out if this is a retail or OEM serial? will we have to enter another serial down the road?
second i have windows vista home premium now...should i just go through the setup folder and upgrade or should i burn this to a dvd and boot it from there? or should i do a clean install?
third..will i need to download the win 7 drivers as well?
thanks.."
,Tstyln,2010-02-01T03:37Z,"Well this DID NOT WORK for me, sure it loaded Windows 7 x64, but then it said I still needed to activate, I tried resolving and says I need to change my product key. Unless I am missing something, this Doesn't activate!"
,fpierre76,2010-02-01T03:56Z,I'm having the same issue as Tstyln.   I now have two days before automatic activation.  Will there be an issue with the activation process???
,Cole3G,2010-02-01T03:59Z,"Thanks Jz, works great.
I think mine activated?? 
I haven't had any windows pop-up saying that it isn't activated.

,Tino125,2010-02-01T21:04Z,Hey m8 which1 do I use to install? To get with the latest updates or without the latest updates?
,temhawk,2010-02-02T12:16Z,"Hi jz28. Thank you very much for this torrent. Do you know how I can get sound working? It says that no audio devices are installed :-/

I have VirtualBox 3 on Mac OS X (iMac)."
,temhawk,2010-02-02T13:30Z,"UPDATE to my previous comment:

I found the solution. It seems that the 64 bit version doesn't include the necessary audio drivers for it to work in VirtualBox (and this is not a torrent fault) so I downloaded and installed them and now I have sound working. If you have the same problem, just read this short blog entry: http://blogs.sun.com/fatbloke/entry/audio_in_64_bit_windows

Thanks again for this great torrent!"
,jjjK,2010-02-02T22:08Z,"Hey jz28, thanks for the upload! I have windows xp do I need vista before I can run the setup? Thanks:)x"
,bhood37,2010-02-03T17:51Z,"Just an observation:

I installed this into a VMware image.  Installed perfectly, runs well.  I'm keeping an eye on it for a while to see how it behaves.

I also tried doing an upgrade from 64-bit Windows Vista Ultimate (to this, 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate).  After a lengthy compatibility check, I get a contradictory message that says 1. I cannot upgrade from 32-bit to 64-bit, and 2.  I cannot upgrade from 64-bit to 32-bit.  (wft?!).  I'm going to assume that upgrading is not going to work for me with this.

At any rate, thanks very much jz28 for the upload.  Quality +1."
,Cole3G,2010-02-03T18:16Z,"@ jjjK

No, You don't need to have vista to upgrade.
Though, for it to work with XP (Which is what I did) You have to burn the .ISO file to DVD and then boot from DVD.

~Cheers"
,transformer2008,2010-02-04T23:40Z,"So it is only able to run on top of the previous OS, cant i get rid of vista then install windows 7?"
,Mr-Moose,2010-02-05T06:52Z,How do I get the 64 bit version working?
,abhi_adh,2010-02-05T08:44Z,well...it shows an error for me after 48% completion...i tried it by burning the image in different PC's.....but getting the same result again n again..

,danielkoch503,2010-02-06T23:54Z,so this doesnt say you have 30 days to activate?
,hockey216,2010-02-07T08:16Z,"when i was extracting. it said ""cannot extract ""install.wim""

what do i do?"
,kimddown,2010-02-07T17:32Z,"@hockey216
Then, don't extract the contents.
Just burn the image on to a DVD using imgburn or something.
And boot from the disc."

,xihte,2010-02-14T13:48Z,"Best I can tell this can not be used to ""upgrade"" a 64bit install. As the installer itself is 32 bit so it just gets started and puts out errors.

,CurseUppl,2010-05-04T21:34Z,"@ slymonkey1986

You must either be exceptionally stupid or new to the 21st century.

Have you thought of Googling first? Or, I don't know, if 64 is one option, then MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY THE 82 OPTION? NO?

You have TWO options retard and clearly one of them is 64 bit, so logically the second one must be what you're seeking.

,Eugenome,2010-05-08T00:10Z,"@curseuppl

bro, that was a fair question. How would you know otherwise? If there is 64 bit and then there is 86 bit... How would you propose someone connect the 32 bit and 86 bit as being one in the same? "

,Cheezsteak,2010-05-08T06:40Z,"I need help:
I mounted the iso file and tried to burn the files onto the dvd, but when I did that it said that I had not enough space on 4.7GB dvd for the 3.48GB file.  I know this is wrong because I had idiotically, but successfully, burned the iso file itself to another similar DVD.  I am running OS X leopard if that makes a difference, and before I burn the image it says the file has a 1,000 TB overflow on the dvd which is crazy."

,Passwordz,2010-05-15T18:31Z,So wait...does that mean I should NOT install updates?  Or will the activator activate Windows permanently?
,Passwordz,2010-05-15T19:05Z,Nevermind...I'll just install updates and find an activator if it asks me to activate Windows.

"
,Avengerx64,2010-09-03T18:59Z,Great torrent as for those who have issues with the OS you might consider this hardware is seen by an OS by it's product code just because you meet speed ram and graphics requirements does not mean your machine will run on a x64 based platform . Now the break down of how thing's work the CPU and on board chip set must support x64 communications in order for x64 software to work it has nothing to do with how new your computer is or how much you have paid for it if the manufacture has not equipped the motherboard with the hex code needed to communicate with a x64 capable CPU it 98% of the time will fail on install . check what products are inside your PC before you download any OS and I do not mean what brand it is if your CPU is Intel get the Intel chip set ID tool to find out if your on board chip set and CPU can run a x64 platform . You also should be checking the motherboard manufactures spec charts for max memory support unless your board supports 8GB-32GB you will hardly see any gain by installing an x64 OS another thing to consider is that x46 CPU's in the dual core rage have a hard time dealing with 4GB of ram due to limited L2 cache where as sockets LGA 1156 and LGA 1366 all use L3 cache and for those that do not know L3 or level 3 cache is the level of cache that servers have been putting to use for almost 10 years now . Remember more then 6GB of memory requires more horse power to deal with it you can only add so much ram before the CPU says I can't handle anymore . 
,Avengerx64,2010-09-03T19:04Z,great speed good image PS to those saying they can't run it make sure you have a x64 and x64 compliant motherboard and CPU

,VMTranzcode,2010-09-14T07:44Z,"For you techs out there or those of you new to torrents....ways to test software before installing it on your main operating system:

Go VIRTUAL first:

Install VurtualBox http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Install your OS's of choice 
(Linux, Windows XP, Vista, 7, Win Server etc)  

Take a Snapshot right after the install 
(just in case you screw up with updates etc)  

Install your antivirus and anti-spyware.  

Install Magic ISO or Daemon Tools and your preferred burning software

Install your torrent app 

(uTorrent or whatever you like most)

Once you download your torrents, mount them in Magic ISO or Daemon tools then check them with the antivirus-antispyware.  

Install your torrented app.

If you mess up or the virus-antispyware didn't catch the infection or in case of windows you mess up with the windowsupdates, at least you can roll back to your last Snapshot before you install the program on your main OS.

It's easy to install just use winrar to unpack all files, it takes some times [you can burn also iso using daemon tools], easy.... , and when your files are unpacked just click setup and windows goes!
If you have trouble with activation use kaz loader, and your windows will be activated 100%.
