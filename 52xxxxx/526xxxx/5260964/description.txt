       SKUL are responsible for the crime                                                  
       wave that is sweeping the nation - but not SKUL as we know it. Tired of being an    
       underling, Anita Kane (or The Grandmistress) takes over SKUL with an army of        
       robotic bunnies. Rose and Carrie strike a deal with The Grandmaster that they       
       won't arrest him unless he ends the crime wave after getting rid of the             
       Grandmistress.
