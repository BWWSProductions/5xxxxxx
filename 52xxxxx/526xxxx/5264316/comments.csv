,niki5278,2010-01-14T06:01Z,"Seriously... it would be nice if those who have the complete download would continue seeding AND open up their upload rates for at least a few hours to help everyone else out.  I have been uploading at my highest for 6 days which has been 80-92kb/s.  As of today, right now, I have uploaded a  total of 42.4 Gig.  

There WERE plenty of seeders before... I find it hard to believe they all found it in their hearts to seed for the same few hours and then decided to be done...  Logically most everyone should be starting and finishing at different times which theoretically should have AT LEAST a few good seeders seeding at any given time IF people continue to seed once they have the full download... 

The torrent is good.  There are just alot of people on the torrent with what looks to be only me seeding half the time.  Sorry guys... I can't control who continues to seed.  I myself will continue to seed for awhile.  Best of luck!  Keep the comments coming, good and bad and maybe others will start understanding a little more how important it is to share the wealth!

,usr_nme,2010-01-15T05:12Z,"yeahh already download the game it work and all...
thanks!! XD"
,niki5278,2010-01-16T05:39Z,"Glad to hear the possitive feedback!

I've uploaded 52.7 Gig as of today and plan to keep on giving for at least another week.  My Seeding has priority over any downloads so hopefully that's helpful to everyone.  :o)

If you think about it, I've uploaded 10Gig in 24 hours. That's not bad... And it's nice to see almost as many seeders as there are peers.  Hope it stays that way! LOL

Keep the comments coming.  Would like to hear how long it's actually taking people to complete the download.
