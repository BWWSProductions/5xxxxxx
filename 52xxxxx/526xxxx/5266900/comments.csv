,mikimano,2010-01-08T09:14Z,This is a joke. Do not download. It is only a few pages from the book from the harpercollins site... omg.
,teslatek,2010-01-08T20:33Z,"Yeah babe, there is anoher torrent like this and don't work. Because many users are traying to donwload it (so I), I decide go to the page http://browseinside.harpercollins.com/index.aspx?isbn13=9780061896750, download page by page (jpeg format), and put here to every body. May be this is not the complete book, but this is not a fucking joke."

if you already can acces the data for free there's no point on making a torrent of it 
and add more details next time , remember add trackers too NOOB!"
,teslatek,2010-01-09T01:53Z,"No, I don't forget the whole point of torentz. Nobody can select each pictures in the usual way from the book on http://browseinside.harpercollins.com/index.aspx?isbn13=9780061896750 and paste in any here, so, I make the job copying every picture from temporay internet files (acceding to the data and copying, then deleting accesing copying and so on), number it and putting here in The Pirate Bay. Many users don't want make much work, so I make for they."
