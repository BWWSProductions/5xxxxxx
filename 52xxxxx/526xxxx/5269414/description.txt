I've had a bunch of request for this one from those not lucky enough to have this movie played in theaters in your area, So Here It Is!
If you've never seen the show before you've missed out! 


This is the finale of the series and they go out with a bang!


***Warning Spoiler Alert***

The last time i saw the boys in action, it was November of last year. Ricky, Julian and Bubbles are about to get out of jail, and this time, Julian vows to go straight, even open a legit business. Soon the Boys will all be rich. But when they arrive back at the park, they find it's not the same old Sunnyvaleâ€”and it's not the same old Jim Lahey, Trailer Park Supervisor.

Lahey's a new man, hasn't had a drink for two years. And he has plansâ€”BIG PLANSâ€”for Sunnyvale. Too bad for Lahey that Julian stands in his way. Having the Boys back in the park is too much pressure for Lahey to bear. With his big plans for Sunnyvale going down the toilet, and his relationship with Randy broken down, the countdown to liquor day is on for Jim Lahey.

Meanwhile, Julian's having problems of his own. His business fails and the Boys are forced to resort to doing what they know bestâ€”breaking the law. Soon Lahey's descent into the liquor coupled with the Boys descent into crime puts them all on a collision course to destruction. Trailer Park Boys: Countdown To Liquor Day.



Enjoy and Please Seed!!!
