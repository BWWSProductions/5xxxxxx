Anyways thanx a lot for this awesome compression. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-05T21:11Z,"@ralphvin:
R&Rlla could go (maybe this weekend, be here on Saturday), but regarding Saw, don't get me wrong, Net is full of small-sized Saw collections, really. I have seen that all sites have  different ones, in all imaginable shapes and sizes. My, however good it may be, would be one to many. So. I'll pass this one."

[V],twentyforty,2010-01-06T09:18Z,"@htctouch: ""Bigger than you"" I cannot.
""Amreeka"" I have sitting for three days and nobody have done the subtitles yet. So, it will wait."
,lilars26,2010-01-06T16:23Z,"This movie did not have a great rating so I wasn't expecting much.But I found it to be quite entertaining.There are not a lot of movies made that take place in Antarctica.The only one I can think of is the one with Kurt Russel.Anyway,I thought this was a pretty good who dunnit.Thanks again."
