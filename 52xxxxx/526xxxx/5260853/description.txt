*** Small-sized 2-pass re-encode of DVD rip for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox, portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) . ***

I can recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.
VLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.
One can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.
QuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.
PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.
And please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.

USE TORRENT-SEARCH SITES, TorrentBar extension for FireFox OR EVEN GOOGLE: show-name H264
(for example GOSSIP GIRL H264).

A U.S. marshal (Kate Beckinsale), the only one assigned to Antarctica, 
must investigate a murder there within three days before the Antarctic 
winter begins. She crosses paths with a U.N. operative (Gabriel Macht), 
also investigating the murder.She must chase down suspects and find more 
murders. Early in the story, Steko is attacked by the killer and left for 
dead in a storm. She saves herself but loses two fingers due to severe 
cold-related injuries.
For U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko, things are about to get even more dangerous. 
The only law enforcement in this unforgiving territory, she has just been sent 
to investigate a body on the ice. Antarctica's first homicide. A shocking 
discovery in itself, it will plunge her into an even more bizarre mystery 
and the revelation of secrets long-buried under the endless ice--secrets that 
someone believes are still worth killing for. As Stetko races to find the killer 
before he finds her, winter is already closing in. In the deadly Antarctic 
whiteout, she won't see him till he's a breath away.
