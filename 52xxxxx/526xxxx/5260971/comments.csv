,Mercyflush64,2010-01-06T01:16Z,I really appreciate the weeky uploads on current comics but I am still confused as to why most people include duplicates of the same issue. Even in your description here there are numerous issues that could have shrank this download by half the size.
,3We3,2010-01-06T03:07Z,"c2c means cover to cover, ie. including the ads.  So you can download which you prefer, plus some of these are different scans by different people, so You may prefer one scanner over another, or just want a larger file (Hopefully higher quality) or smaller file version of the same book.  In any event, there is no reason you have to download the whole thing if your torrent client is set up right.  Just pick what you want and leave out what you don't.  "
