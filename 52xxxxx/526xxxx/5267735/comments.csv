,bongowolf,2010-01-12T11:23Z,Holy Shit - DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!  I got a email from the MPAA & studio - they're tracking this!  This isn't a joke.
,geoffp,2010-01-14T07:42Z,"bongowolf, have you nothing better to do than post stupid comments on EVERY torrent? I see you posted an identical one here for the same movie:

So having downloaded it once and supposedly got a warning, you downloaded it again. GET A LIFE!       "
