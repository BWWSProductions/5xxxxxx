,inerel,2010-05-31T03:43Z,Is this a pre-patched rip or an iso? does it have safedisc? This matters because it could mess up my cd burner if it has it.
,savehaloz,2010-06-19T06:41Z,"This is a rip, no ISO. "
,REDEYESWOLF,2010-08-16T14:47Z,"redmega: Go into your C drive and right click it, then use disk clean up and the game should work then. I'm also having problems, for some reason the game stops working when I trying going into the farm where all those people are living underground.. I downloaded the unofficialFO2patch but still nothing?? Any ideas?"
