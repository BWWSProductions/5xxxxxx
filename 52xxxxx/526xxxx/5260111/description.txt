The FPS Creator X10 1.09 Mature Patch. 

After you apply the patch you may get an error while trying to build a game, it'll say something about d3dx10_40.dll and dbprosetup10.dll. You can solve both of the problems by downloading and installing DirectX SDK March09:

The patch makes all X9 model packs work on X10 (I've tried Model Pack 9, it works great). If you still get some errors about not being able to load an image (Runtime Error 506 precisely), simply reboot your computer, that solved the problem for me. Some weapons still don't work (e.g. AK74 from MP10) but that will be fixed in V1.10.
