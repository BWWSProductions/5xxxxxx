PlayStation-Ready HD Movie Trailers
January 7, 2010


This is a collection of movie trailers for next week premieres
and latest interesting trailers in HD 1080p. No great blockbusters
this time, but many interesting plots. Everything is in stereo,
my surround system yawns. If you haven't seen DJ Pogo works
on YouTub, prepare for surprise!
