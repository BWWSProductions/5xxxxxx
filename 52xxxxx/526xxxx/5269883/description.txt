Soundgarden couldn't have picked a better time to issue its best album yet, BADMOTORFINGER, in the fall of 1991. ... Full DescriptionThe Seattle explosion (which also included Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice In Chains) was just about to take off, and along with such other classic albums as NEVERMIND, TEN, and FACELIFT, BADMOTORFINGER benefited greatly from all of the newfound media attention and critical praise. New bassist Ben Shepherd fit in perfectly with the band, evidenced by this incredibly consistent album. Although Soundgarden's breakthrough hit, "Outshined," remains the best-known track, the whole album is a must-hear from beginning to end. 

While BADMOTORFINGER is certainly best experienced listening all the way through, single standouts include the barnstorming album opener, "Rusty Cage," the all-out assault "Jesus Christ Pose," as well as the crawling "Slaves & Bulldozers," and the tranquil "Mind Riot." Add to it the back-to-back epics "Searching With My Good Eye Closed" and "Room a Thousand Years Wide," plus the short punk blasts "Face Pollution" and "Drawing Flies," and you have one of the greatest rock albums to ever come out of the Emerald City. 

Recorded at Studio D, Sausalito, California and Bear Creek Studios, Woodinville, Washington in 1991
