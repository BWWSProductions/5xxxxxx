,Lord_Kongol,2010-02-01T21:18Z,"I'd just like to warn anyone in the USA trying to download this torrent.  It is being monitored by Disney and they will report to your ISP if you choose to download this.  Find a different torrent please.

PS: I was also using PeerBlock when I downloaded this torrent.  It had no effect."
,gnetix,2010-02-03T05:49Z,"Ugh... just want to know if this has happened to anyone else. Downloaded the file and when I checked it, a clip that I had on my computer a coupe of days ago was there instead. The name of the movie was surrogates along with the info file and everything. Even the clip size was the 702mb's that the movie is supposed to be. Anyway, I'll check back in a day or so. I'll say thanks in advance to you too emery. Great uploads!! Thanks for all the great movies!!"
,gnetix,2010-02-03T17:48Z,"Just wanted to come back and give an official thanks! I don't know what was going on. For some reason the movie kept restoring a deleted clip that I had. I just had to save the torrent in a different location and that fixed it. Never had this happen before, but I'm sure it has something to do with VisDUHHHHH!!!!  "
