Plot

U.S. Deputy Marshal Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) has been assigned to a base in Antarctica for two years. During the last three days of her assignment, a body is found encased in ice and Carrie is obliged to take part in the continentâ€™s first-ever murder investigation. With the Antarctic winter drawing close, Carrie must work diligently to complete the investigation before the arrival of an incoming storm. Carrie is unaware that she is involved in a sixty year old murder that the killer would do anything to keep secret. While working on the case, Stetko crosses paths with a UN operative (Gabriel Macht), who has also been assigned to the case as an investigator. As Stetko chases down suspects, she finds evidence of more murders. Stetko is maliciously attacked by the killer and left for dead in the harsh Antarctic storm. Stetko must reveal the killer before he finds her again.
