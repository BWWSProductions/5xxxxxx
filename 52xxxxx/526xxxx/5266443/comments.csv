,JJammin1,2010-01-08T07:32Z,"Yes, the audio track is way, way, way off... by minutes."
,1perhansa,2010-01-08T08:31Z,Agree that the synchronization is off by 2:15 minutes
,JJammin1,2010-01-08T19:55Z,"I tried to correct the audio skew in my player, but unfortunately the synchronization offset doesn't remain constant throughout the entire thing. At between 13 and 14 minutes in, the audio goes even further out of sync. The only option here is to wait for a corrected version to be posted."
