5th anniversary! This was the second of two "farewell" shows. The band came back in 2009 with a new album and two additional members. This past December 25 they played what's probably their best show ever, good things will come!

UPDATE!!!!!!
This torrent has been moved/updated to the hexagon . cc site. My original files got messed up, so now I canâ€™t seed anymore. If you are one of the leechers, and youâ€™re stuck at 99%, please download the new torrent file, set the download location to the folder where you have these files, your torrent client should verify the data and download only the pieces that are missing, that way you donâ€™t have to download the whole show again.
