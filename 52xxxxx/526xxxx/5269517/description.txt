When Joker is yet again released into an unsuspecting world, he hatches perhaps his most damaged plan yet - to frame Batman for murder and for 'victimising' him, with the help of a blackmailed journalist and DA-turned-bad Terry Ammons! But what secrets are they hiding? And what darkest of secrets still haunts Batman?

Written and illustrated by Sam Kieth (Zero Girl, Four Women, The Maxx) and coloured by Alex Sinclair (Superman: For Tomorrow).
