Three of Van Brughâ€™s slaves escape, commandeer a ship loaded with slaves, bound for the Van Brugh plantation, and rob itâ€™s Captain of 1000 pounds. When the shipâ€™s Captain reports the incident, on New Providence, Tempest puts to sea immediately, finds the ship, boards it, takes it over, and confiscates the stolen money. He then sails back to New Providence, where he buys the slaves with the Captainâ€™s own money, and sets them free.
