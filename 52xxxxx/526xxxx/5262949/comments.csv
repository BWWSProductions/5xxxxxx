,dadeohdan,2010-01-07T00:17Z,Sounds like someone needs a nap..........Thanks sailo1 a great job like always.
,justin131,2010-01-08T13:21Z,That was rather entertaining reading that chain of comments. I think I'll download it on that merit alone. Cheers.

,ralphy55,2010-02-27T15:09Z,"Perhaps it's just me but I don't see the point of ripping a BluRay into a format (MKV) that can't be played back on a BluRay player or PS3.  This is in no way a comment on sailo but nearly all of the HD rips are MKV.  Don't tell me that people are watching this on their computers?  If that is the case you may as well download the regular DVD rip since the difference is nominal.  Yes I have a 24"" screen at 1920*1200 resolution but it can't hold a candle to the HD output from my PS3 driving my HD TV; which to me is the whole point of getting a BluRay rip to begin with.  For those of you that are doubters, try the output on a bigscreen tv with a serious surround system and you'll never want to watch a movie or show sitting in front of your computer again.  I guess I'll just tie up my computer for a while and convert this, I was really hoping that of the 7 or 8 versions of this floating around that one of them wouldn't be MKV.  Sorry for the mild rant."
,camj,2010-02-28T11:50Z,"@ralphy55

you shouldn't let sony tie you down to a specific format - some people watch these on computers using a hdtv as a monitor, its called a HT-PC (home theatre) with surround sound as normal connected to the pc. "
[V],sailo,2010-03-10T13:11Z,"camj , well said.

don't you just love noobs who live in thier own little world who doesn't know shit about the world progressing."
,pakicraze,2010-03-21T18:35Z,all programs suck streaming is a shitty way out.....the best and ONLY way to play a 1080p mkv on a PS3 is to use MKV2VOB.... i have over 20 1080p movies in mp4 formats on my portable hard drive all converted using MKV2VOB just do a search on google and trust me you'll never use any other way again... cheers :) oh and it only takes 5 mins to convert a 4GB mkv to a mp4 without even 1% loss of quality
