from wikipedia:

Downfall was a ska and punk band from the Bay Area formed by Tim Armstrong, Matt Freeman, Dave Mello, Pat Mello, and Jason Hammon following the break-up of Operation Ivy in 1989 and pre-dating Armstrong's and Freeman's wider recognition in Rancid.[1] They performed three shows, one at Gilman, over a period of three months.

The only official Downfall releases were the songs "North Berkeley" on the "Can of Pork" compilation on Lookout! Records, "New Regulations" on the "Very Small World" compilation on Very Small Records, and "Long Way to Go" on the "They Don't Get Paid, They Don't Get Laid, But Boy Do They Work Hard!" compilation LP on Maximum RocknRoll. Rumors of a CD release called "Get Ready for Action" have been circulating for years, and it's uncertain whether that will ever happen. Low quality recordings of the songs are available, hard to track down, and extremely well-received by Operation Ivy fans who have heard them.
