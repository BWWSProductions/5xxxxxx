After Israel, Australia is the country with the highest percentage of immigrants in the world. A quarter of the population originates in other countries. Almost half the population is of Asian descent in the big urban centers. Most of them are young and well-educated. They are a new type of immigrant, able to fit in anywhere in Australia and around the world. The Future Express travels between the two largest Australian cities, Melbourne and Sydney, and listens to the stories of young students like Anna, who is of Chinese ancestry and for whom all options are open. She is studying photography in Australia and has many potential opportunities in the future, whether it means going back to China or moving on to Europe or the United States. She calls herself a "new style" of immigrant, one who is globally accepted.
