,Mysterygal,2010-02-09T13:26Z,um .. why WMA files? WMA is the grottiest audio format to hit the music scene. http://www.pcworld.com/article/119016/risk_your_pcs_health_for_a_song.html Not to mention the lack of cross-platform conversion capabilities of the format to play or burn from. I sound strong is because there is so much wma rubbish out there. People who use wma format are usually a touch on the ignorant side.
