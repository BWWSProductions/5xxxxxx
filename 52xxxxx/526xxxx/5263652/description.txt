Jetsgo, Canada's new discount airline, took to the air on June 12th, 2002, with a fleet of 3 Douglas MD80s. During the first year of operation Jetsgo has continually increased the number of destinations, routes and frequencies. By the first anniversary on June 12th, 2003, Jetsgo announced it was increasing its fleet to 12 aircraft.
On this program we follow 4 Jetsgo trips from it's main hub at Toronto's Pearson Airport, 2 on short flights including to Montreal's Dorval Airport, 1 on a transcontinental service to Vancouver and 1 on a charter operation to Cuba.
During these flights we witness the pilots at work, a deicing, a cockpit presentation, aircraft walkaround, in cabin service and much more.....
