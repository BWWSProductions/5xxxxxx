It's been eight years since onetime Sonic Youth member, Wilco producer, and overall indie institution Jim O'Rourke put out a new solo album of original material on Drag City. That's set to change September 8 in the U.S. (August 31 in the UK), when the genre-skipping artist unveils his newest LP, The Visitor. (Via The Wire.)

According to the label, the record is more song-oriented than his excursions into avant-electronics (see: stuff like 2001's I'm Happy, and I'm Singing, and a 1, 2, 3, 4 or 2007's collaboration with Merzbow and Carlos Giffoni, Electric Dress). It's apparently more in line with O'Rourke's somber instrumental LP Bad Timing than his sly pop records, Eureka and Insignificance.
