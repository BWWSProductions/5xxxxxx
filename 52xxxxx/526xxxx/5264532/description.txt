*Cataloging and solving your mystery
MediaMan is an organizer software designed to catalog your entire collection of 
music, books, videos, and games. It's loaded with features such as virtual-shelf 
visual rendering of items, automated content retrieval*, webcam barcode scanning, 
nested categories, tags, and flags for rental management that will really solve 
your problem of cataloging. It's very powerful and a great time saver. 

MediaMan is all-in-one. You don't need separate tools for different types of items.
MediaMan is so powerful that you can use it to organize virtually everything, from 
books to Blu-rays, from sports cards to paintings. 

*MediaMan is capable of retrieving content from Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, 
Amazon.de, Amazon.co.jp, Amazon.fr, Amazon.ca, as well as a selection of other 
websites. Content retrieval from Amazon is enabled using the Amazon web service 
program, and Amazon Associate program. 


*Elegant design is not just about good looking
MediaMan features elegant interface design. MediaMan used some of the most 
advanced technologies to establish its user interface. Every little bit of the 
program is fine-tuned to be visually pleasant, not only on your desktop, but also 
on a large screen TV.

But, there's more. Good looking is not enough.

MediaMan's user interface is also quite easy to operate. The program is designed 
to require minimum user-intervention. It doesn't need you to answer a lot of 
questions or pick a lot of options when accomplishing common tasks. Most jobs can 
be done via a single click or drag & drop. 


*Single-click Import
Can import of items be done via a single mouse click? Of course!

Just press "Import" on the toolbar, and MediaMan will switch to import mode. Your 
webcam shall be started within seconds. Then, you only have to flash the barcode 
part of your items in front of the webcam*. When you hear MediaMan beeps, your job 
is done.

MediaMan will automatically search for the description of your item from Amazon. 
When this process completes, you'll see the item appearing in your collection. 
See how easy that was?

Doesn't have a webcam? No worries, you can still use your keyboard to enter the 
title, or get a USB barcode scanner* to scan-in the data.


*The Blue Hyperlinks
The blue part of the text is not just to distinguish important stuff. They are 
functional links that you can click to access more functions. We designed it to 
replace buttons and save your precious screen space while still offering quick 
access to common features.
 
Take the bottom pane for example. It allows you to change sorting options as well 
as navigate between categories. Even when the category pane is hidden, you still 
get a chance to choose other categories.


*Tagging
When you have a big collection. It can be difficult to locate anything, even 
with keyword searching, and nested categories. That's when tagging comes handy.

Tagging is like putting labels on the items. This allows you to organize based 
on subjects, locations, genre or anything on your mind. You can create tags by 
editing the tag field, or assign tags using drag & drop. MediaMan will display 
related tags if multiple tags are assigned to items.


*Versatile Portal
MediaMan goes beyond cataloging. It's not only a database of your CDs and DVDs. 
You can attach audio and video files on your hard drive to the items inside the 
collection, so that you can play them directly inside MediaMan*.

MediaMan turns into a jukebox when you click "Play Music" or "Play Video" on the 
left. All items that have files attached are playable. You can arrange the 
playlist the way you like.

And powered by Amazon Associate service, MediaMan even has a shopping cart feature 
that you can use to purchase items from Amazon. Simply import the items you like 
or recommendations into the Shopping folder, and you'll have the option on toolbar 
to buy them at any time.


**Playback Feature 
MediaMan relies on Windows Media Player (WMP) to playback music and video files.



On top of these great features, you also get:

- Borrow/rental status management.
- Instant search within collection.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
