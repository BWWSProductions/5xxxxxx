[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-08T17:33Z,"@k2pikachu, aliendydo, wynterbourne: delete all the files in the folder Server and re-do all the process. If not work use the ""Standard Version""

@aliendydo: i think this is fps problem. Decrease your ingame resolution, and reduce textures ecc in the graphics options"
,DonFrans,2010-01-08T17:40Z,"Loses connection after 1,5 minutes..."

[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-08T17:51Z,"@scrooge16: no you not need anything, all files are in the torrent. just overwrite the existing file, or redo all the process from beginning"

,Sonolin,2010-01-08T19:14Z,"Well it works but only for about 1-2 minutes, and then it kicks me saying ""Steam connection failed"" or something like that :(. Any other mode than team deathmatch says ""connection to steam lobby failed"". 

Darn I was really looking forward to this working. Any workarounds? "
,PseudoProphetEx,2010-01-08T19:24Z,This kicked me after less then a minute after applying it over 1.0.166. I'll be doing a fresh install of MW2 to see if that was the problem.
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-08T19:31Z,"@Sonolin: redo all the process from beginning, you missed uo something"
,PseudoProphetEx,2010-01-08T19:37Z,"I did a fresh install of MW2 and applied this crack. I still get kicked after less then a minute, help?"
,Sonolin,2010-01-08T19:40Z,"Nope it was a fresh install, and I did all steps exactly as directed. I'll try it again later today but I'm 99% sure that I did nothing incorrect. I also tried both standard and custom versions, to no avail.

I did not install the newest patch, however.. but my impression was that this was included in the crack, so this wasn't needed.. correct?"
,xboxbr,2010-01-08T19:56Z,"guys, u have to install zero gear demo first

them u replace the crack on zero gear's folder/server (on this folder u need to have the mw2 game) go to activision folder, copy all files and paste on ""zero gears/server"" folder. then u play using zero gear icon"
,PseudoProphetEx,2010-01-08T20:00Z,"They updated to 1.0.174, this might be the problem. Either that or we need a proper crack for iw4mp.exe 1.0.172."

,k2pikachu,2010-01-08T21:48Z,"It worked for a while, but then it started to say ""failed to join steam lobby"" right after the map loads. help?"
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-08T21:55Z,"For all that have connection problems or other, reinstall Steam and re do all from beginning, I play it few minutes ago with no problems. It take 1 second to join a game. Guys you are doing something wrong, do ALL that i have written in the instructions, don't jump any step. If not work delete all and repeat the operation, because it's working, it take 1 second to join the lobby and few seconds for the loading screen.

@Eternalstream: copy the folder called ""main"" from COD MW2 installation directory to C: \Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\zero gear\Server

if it not join the lobby first time try another time, or change the match tipe. it's working man.

you don't need any patch or anything else, just overwrite the existing file with this. and this is the version 1.0.172 not other versione that somebody said. it's 1.0.172

try and let me know, and rate the torrent if you like it"
,Maz7006,2010-01-08T22:15Z,"Torrent Works great, been playing for some time, no issues, simple upgrade from last patch. Great stuff 50c3ent!!!!"

,82malice,2010-01-09T06:22Z,I followed the directions on the torrent but for some reason when i open that little racing game through steam. its actually opening the stuid little racing game??? how can i fix this
,Sonolin,2010-01-09T08:34Z,"It worked!! I reinstalled steam and started over and the crack worked wow thanks man :)

Unfortunately multiplayer kinda sucks right now with all the hackers :'(.. but thanks for the crack and its 20x better than playing COD5"

,coolmoo,2010-01-09T12:30Z,dunno what happens after about 1 min everyone on the server gets the error... steam connection failed
,coolmoo,2010-01-09T12:54Z,"I figured it out..
everytime you start this game up usin zero what not...
steam makes your client auto update the zero demo
way around this
as soon as you start MW2 
Alt+tab
Open steam up
Disable the game from auto updates again...
worked for me at least...
its fun pissin off hackers walkin up to them with a riot shield.. since they can only aim for the head xD
then bash em twice ... call them a noob and walk away xD"
,GabbeNrway,2010-01-09T15:30Z,"When i launch then it comes up:

,niterescue,2010-01-09T17:31Z,I am getting same problem as Eternalsteam....the file contents are the same in both main folders.  Any clues to what I am doing wrong?
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-09T18:02Z,"@ALL that have connection lost or iwd problems:

Have you correctly extracted this torrent files?
Have you correctly copied all COD MW2 files in the folder ""Server""?
Use 7zip to extract the files. Then do this steps:

1. Delete all the files in the folder ""Server""
2. Uninstall Zero Gear, then uninstall Steam
3. Use CCleaner to clean the registry of windows
4. Reinstall Steam, then Zero Gear
5. Follow the instructions in the torrent

@Eternalstream: do what i write above

@niterescue: do what i write above

@82malice: do what i write above

@GabbeNrway: do what i write above or try to copy the folder called ""zone"" in this torrent and paste it in ""C: \Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\zero gear\Server

@psprapper: yes you have to do that"
,bassman0115,2010-01-09T18:09Z,"Have not tried yet, but looking at the instructions, I get confused here.

6. Copy all the file of your Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and...

Does that mean the CODMW2 directory?"
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-09T18:23Z,"no, not the directory but all the content of the directory"
,niterescue,2010-01-09T20:29Z,@50c3nt   i must be a retard...did exactly what you said and still get the same missing iwd files in /main
,Sonolin,2010-01-09T21:46Z,"Well it was working for me fine yesterday, now it simply says ""failed to join steam lobby"" whenever it tries joining a game."
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-09T22:13Z,"@niterescue: are you sure that you have copied and overwrited all the files with the files in this torrent? the no iwd problem happen when you have not properly copied all the files

@Sonolin: try to join other types of matches, I play a TDM few minutes ago without problem. 5 seconds to join the game + loading screen. Retry. If this happen another time, maybe you haven't disable automatic updates, so you have to delete all the files and repeat all the operations."
,niterescue,2010-01-09T22:25Z,@50c3nt   i copied the files from the torrent just as you said...but i think i found the problem...i had a zipped version of mw2..not the one that is recommended by you..i am in the process of downloading that one...not sure if that makes a difference.
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-09T22:49Z,"yes, if you have the ripped version i think is only for SP and not for MP. The whole game size is about 11-12gb. you have to download the whole game ;-)"
,niterescue,2010-01-10T23:42Z,"@50c3nt  the file after uncompressing is about 14 gb...when trying mp through there, it loads steam...still in process of d/l'g the other version"

,alex12metal,2010-01-11T20:11Z,"ciao 50c3nt sono ancora io, ti ringrazio ancora per la patch nuova, se non chiedo troppo potrei sapere se c'è anche un modo per giocare le special ops online?"
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-11T21:09Z,"@niterescue: ok download the other version and try with that

@Eternalstream: I have no idea buddy, as you can see someone had the same error, and they solve it doing all from beginning. As I already said you are doing something wrong. If you can try to another pc, and see if it's works

@alex12metal: per giocare a spec ops devi usare il loader dei teknogods, lo puoi trovare qui con tutte le istruzioni:

@Vladoun: yes it happens some times, i got it 2 times today. just rejoin the lobby and search other match and you will be able to play

@k2pikachu & k2pikachu: i let you know when mine is exipired, what to do. it giving some connection problems today, it's normal. search another match and play"
,dude17645,2010-01-14T00:26Z,@50c3nt ok i haven't tried anything yet but the hard drive i have steam on is out of space so moving mw2 on there isn't possible. Would this still work if i moved steam on to my newer hard drive or would i have to do this on the one steam was originally installed on?
,dude17645,2010-01-14T00:30Z,"Sorry that might've been unclear, pretty much my C drive is full and was wondering if i could move steam to my G drive and then copy the crack into steam when its there and then proceed as normal"
,Lyv,2010-01-14T14:57Z,"I got a small problem, whenever me and a friend try to invite each other, we get ""Can't join friends game"".

Is it cause steam is ""patching"" this way of playing?

What should we do to make it work?"

,Italiano83,2010-01-14T18:07Z,actually you can.. well at least before you could.. i invited my friends with the same cracked version to private matches or we gather in a party and then searched for online games with no problems.. but since yesterday.. it keeps giving that message.. and my friends also.. no one can join anyone´s party

Yes, me and a friend who had the cracked version was able to join and invite each other to parties, but now it dosn't works.

[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-14T21:50Z,"ok, I never tried it before :P so IW patched that thing. ok now IW are coing to update to 1.0.175 so when that happens you can play with 1.0.174. so wait a little and you will be able to join your friends.

the zero gear expire problems is solved. zero gear gived 4 day trial, to play full game, after it expire it returns to demo, so you can play mw2 with no problems"
