    what's so good?
    Why do we like sad music? Itâ€™s a bit masochistic to enjoy feeling miserable. Maybe weâ€™re just drawn to music that can relate to our darkest moments. After all, songs like the Beatlesâ€™ â€œShe Loves You Yeahâ€ canâ€™t describe every day of your life. It can actually make you feel worse in the wrong context. Some times you need a good break-up album to snuggle up with, knowing someone felt as crappy as you did at one point.

    But the Antlersâ€™ Hospice is not your typical â€œWah, my girlfriend dumped meâ€ album. It actually speaks of a pain very few people can relate to. Thereâ€™s a very loose story throughout based on the idea of caring for an abusive terminally ill loved one, investing total emotional strength and doing everything possible to no avail. Itâ€™s a unique sense of hopelessness spoken through singer Peter Silbermanâ€™s tragically beautiful lyrics backed by soft and swelling instrumentation and straining ambient textures that almost perfectly capture the desperate pain behind the words. From the haunting grind of the opening â€œPrologueâ€ to the final notes of Silbermanâ€™s falsetto in â€œEpilogue,â€ this whole album left me absolutely floored. Itâ€™s not music to wallow in your sorrow to; it draws you into its own world with its own pain. And in the end, itâ€™s all about overcoming rather than sulking.

    The Antlers self-released Hospice earlier this year, but it was picked up by French Kiss records within months after receiving praise from the music world and selling out nearly every copy available. Despite its humble beginnings, Hospice easily ranks among the best albums of the year. I picked out the track â€œBearâ€ because itâ€™s one of the best individual songs, but you should really listen to this album front to back to fully appreciate its beauty.



Sometimes you have to put yourself first, no matter how difficult that notion seems; no matter how much time and effort youâ€™ve already put into this one personâ€”the person whoâ€™s reduced your very being to its absolute core. Just ask Peter Silberman, the string-pulling founder of The Antlers, a solo project that suddenly went widescreen on the self-released Hospice LP (now receiving a proper widespread pressing through Frenchkiss). The first Antlers effort to feature two key permanent playersâ€”powerhouse drummer Michael Lerner and the layer-lathering multi-instrumentalist Darby Cicciâ€”itâ€™s an album with a sound thatâ€™s actually as ambitious as its concept.

â€œHospice came from the idea of caring for a terminal patient whoâ€™s mentally abusive to you,â€ says Silberman. â€œYou donâ€™t have the right to argue with them, either, because theyâ€™re the one whoâ€™s dying here; theyâ€™re the one thatâ€™s been dealt a wrong hand. So you take it, but you can only take so much. Eventually, you realize that this person is just destroying you.â€ Appropriately enough, Hospiceâ€™s 10 distinct chapters resonate on debilitating sonic and lyrical levels, from the hypnotic harp and tension-ratcheting build of â€œTwoâ€ to the sing-or-sink choruses of â€œBearâ€ and the speaker-rattling peaks of â€œSylvia,â€ easily one of the yearâ€™s most immediate epics.

Itâ€™s here, amidst contrasting shards of ambient noise, sweeping strings and smoky horns, where The Antlers truly transcend Silbermanâ€™s singer-songwriter beginningsâ€”a striking escalation of expectations first hinted at on 2008â€™s New York Hospitals EP. The progression doesnâ€™t end there, either. In a move that could be taken as the riff-raking extension of his thorough guitar training (from the age of 6 â€˜til right before college), â€œAtrophyâ€ and â€œWakeâ€ delve into sheets of distortion, subtle shades of soul, cicada-like effects and enough movements to fill an entire EP. â€œWe were going for something thatâ€™d be dense but not too complicated,â€ explains Silberman. â€œI hate the word â€˜lush,â€™ but I guess thatâ€™s the best way of describing it.

The structures are like pop songsâ€”verse/chorus, verse/chorusâ€”but the sound is a little more shoegaze-y or post-rocky.â€ Itâ€™s about to get even more complicated, too, as The Antlersâ€™ Technicolor-tinged trio take all of Hospiceâ€™s songsâ€”and three previous releasesâ€”in a completely different direction, jettisoning a note-for-note rendition of the record for â€œa massive soundâ€ doused in delay, reverb and unrehearsed chaos. And to think Cicci was a stage actor with a desire to drop it all for music just a few years ago. â€œHospice was the clear indication that this isnâ€™t a singer-songwriter thing at all,â€ says Silberman. â€œWhatever we record next is going to define the three of us as a â€˜band.â€™ He continues, â€œI always figured Iâ€™d be the â€˜shredderâ€™ in a groupâ€¦But things somehow ended up this way.â€ We wouldnâ€™t have it any other way, either.
