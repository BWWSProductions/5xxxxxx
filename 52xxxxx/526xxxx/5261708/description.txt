Linda's family has been ripped apart by 
hoarding. She wants nothing more than to 
have a relationship with her grown children, 
but they refuse to come near her house 
which is packed waist and neck high with 
piles of belongings. Despite Linda's past 
threat to commit suicide, her children have 
had it. And while her husband doesn't want 
their marriage to end in divorce, he doesn't 
feel he should be forced to live this way 
any longer. 29-year-old Todd has been collecting 
models, kits and various hobby items since
 he was a kid. His girlfriend of five years, 
Robyn, wants to get married and start a family, 
but has threatened to leave him if he doesn't 
clean up his act. Todd wants to create a life 
with her, but is at his wits end not knowing 
where to start.
