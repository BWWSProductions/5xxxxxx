[V],RR-NE,2010-01-08T09:06Z,What converter did you use?
[V],RR-NE,2010-01-08T09:14Z,"You can use this converter to make much smaller files: for instance this is 770.96mb

this converter in the link would allow you to re-convert it to 500mb or less.

or if the .avi file you had was 699mb youd be able to make it 450-500mb.

It works great! Convert any .avi file to smaller file size."
