The 3-4-5 piece tablebases which I already have use the naming format piecesNBW.emd with only one period, which works fine with my Fritz and Shredder GUI's. Some I've seen use two periods pieces.NBW.emd which some other software may require. Which naming format do you provide?

There are 10 permutations of two pieces without pawns: qq qr qb qn rr rb rn bb bn nn. That means there are 10x10=100 possible 3+3 Pawnless EGTB's, but you only provide 33 according to the title of this torrent. Which ones exactly? 

Or is something wrong with my math?"
