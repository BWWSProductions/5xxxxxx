,zaibazu,2010-01-09T03:29Z,So is this release only for use with a USB stick or can it somehow be put on a DVD ?
,cclloyd,2010-01-09T05:39Z,You can use it on a DVD if it has the capacity (at least 6.5 GB)
,a.skiller,2010-01-09T07:59Z,can i use an external hardisk to install it
,meroonberet,2010-01-09T13:23Z,nobody seed
,cclloyd,2010-01-09T18:28Z,"@askiller

You just have to partition it to 32 GB or less, and format it to fat32.

@walictwo

Yes your specs seem capable.  Although i am unsure if they will be fully functional like i was on one computer.  Go to OSx86 to see a full list of fully compatible software."
,Pfyber,2010-01-09T19:06Z,HI. Will it work if I burn it on 2 layer DVD? 
,spyserve,2010-01-09T19:06Z,"Hi cclloyd, you've said this iso is not bootable under vmware, but how could it be under usual way ? I mean vmware simule the same boot process as a real machine ... its strange ! 

And what is the difference with the release : ""Mac Os X Snow Leopard Universal 10.6 v3.5"" 

Because this release dont work for me and im afraid it will the same with your release ...

Boot --> Darwin x86 ""Press any key to boot ..."" --> then reboot and so on (in loop) ....
"
,cclloyd,2010-01-09T20:12Z,"That happened to me when coding.  Thats why if it doesnt work after installing, use the boot flags

amd_kernel -v -x32

no matter what system specs you have it should boot up.

It cant be used under VMWare because when you boot up, it uses areas of your proccessor that are unaccessable and unrecognizable by windows.  You can do it though once you use it from a mac.

And yes you can burn it to a 2 layer DVD as long as it is on 1 side (not double sided DVD) UNLESS you have a dual sided DVD drive where it can read the other side without having to flip it."
,Pfyber,2010-01-10T10:11Z,Ok thanks... do I have to use rebel EFI or something.. or just regular boot?
,spyserve,2010-01-10T16:49Z,"Ok thanks, iam burning it, i have created a new partition (ntfs) ... and now what iam supposed to do ? I reboot on the dvd, and after how can i convert my partition into HFS+ ? Because you cant have disk utility without the USB or is it include in the DVD ? 

THks"
,spyserve,2010-01-10T16:59Z,I have boot on the DVD and i got this message : Operating System not found ... :(((
,spyserve,2010-01-10T17:46Z,"I guess this version (uniFlash) is optimised to boot on a usb flash disk only and not from a dvd ... 

Anyone can tell if that work with usb key ?"
,cclloyd,2010-01-10T18:29Z,"I guess thats why.  When you format your USB with the files inside this, it auto formats to HFSJ.  If you could do that with a CD, then it would work, in theory.

And one last thing, make sure you choose device mode on USB IT when putting this on your USB."

When you say this is x32 compatible, do you mean it can run on a 32 bit processor or that it can run in 32 bit mode on a 64 bit processor?

@spyserve

You state this only works on sata. I originally tried an older version of OS X on an AMD laptop with a sata drive and had trouble since the harddrive was never detected by OS X. From what I had read online it seems there were few if any drivers for the sata drives and it was recommended to stick with IDE. I am now trying this on a different laptop with IDE drive but I haven't tried this version yet. Can this version only be used on sata drives? Is there a workaround?

Thanks in advance."

press the space bar when it?s asking you to press any key?
then type : -v -s
it?ll scroll a bunch of stuff finally you?ll get to a prompt type this:
/sbin/fsck -fy (this checks your HD for fragmentation and some other stuff)
once it?s done type:
/sbin/mount -uw / (don?t forget the -uw I often forget it ;) )
now it?ll mount your system?s volume, so then type:

,aaron1989,2010-02-04T10:44Z,"Firstly, I find that the AMD / INTEL by Hazard version has worked best so far if anybody wants to download it and burn it to dvd and requires any help from their just email or post comment - aarondodd111@hotmail.com and i will help you as have that version currently working on my AM2 Nvidia 8500 version 10.6.0 (currently trying to get the 10.6.2 version working.

Secondly, as for this version, I have had this problem since beginning where none but your flash drive is being recognised when getting to the installation part of things. Now the only thing i've gotten to work so far (quite long winded considering...) requires two hard drives / partitions and a separate USB drive that you can use 8gb minimum. 
I found that when trying to install this version USB drives are the only thing that have been detected, so what i did was installed this version onto the usb drive, then on another hard drive, installed another version of leopard, then after booting into the other version, used the disk utility (as it sees all the hard drives then) to restore the usb hard drive of this version to the second partition / hard drive that has no operating system, allowing you to then boot off the hard drive that has this version installed.

Again i'd suggest you not bother unless there is an easier method then this, and simply install the AMD / INTEL version by hazard.

Sorry about the essay and for newbies, this may seem quite complicated, for people used to tearing the pc apart and messing with jumpers and what not, this just requires effort and time -_-"

,picketf,2010-02-08T11:03Z,"Ok managed to make it boot into OSX86 with my VIA C7 pc. Here's the thing for those who can't get it to work with USBit. 

USE TRANSMAC 7.5

It will wipe any partitions though, there's no way to format to HFS+ without formatting all partitions later you can use Acronis or whatever partition program to create a partition out of the unallocated space left. Transmac will also copy the IMG file to the newly formatted drive

And why was BootHelp.txt removed?? I just enter ""?"" at boot and it says its not there..."
,aaron1989,2010-02-08T12:08Z,"To Farctan - yeah that's cheaper if you have a Dual Layer DVD burner, otherwise no.

To Idannc USBIT does not recognise USB hard drives only USB flash drives e.g them little ones that looks like skinny matchboxes lol.

To Aman369 if you're trying to mount this image on windows - you're an idiot. if not i dont understand what you're trying to mount or what on.

it says clearly in the description use USBIT image tool to restore this image to your USB flash drive and boot from flash drive.

To Delifed - try re-downloading the image. sorry.

To Solcity - blue screen isn't an informational error - google it and see what comes up.

To Wize_Caine - try typing -v rather then just enter when it gives you the option to do so, so you can get information on your error and find out why it doesn't load the OS.

To d0ce it seems like you have the wrong drivers installed for your Network, or the drivers dont work properly maybe because of the Mac OS version. Have you any wireless devices you could try?

Lastly to PicketF, to format a NTFS / FAT32 partition to HFS+ or HFS you can use the linux distro Gparted Live, a live cd that once burned you simply run at boot, and use the application to format your drive or partition without affecting the rest of the drive.

Agreeably I also wondered why the boothelp file was removed.

First of all thanks a lot for the torrent.

I put the image on my 8GB usb stick using USB IT. Then I managed to successfully load it and get past all the writing that comes with the -v option. However, everything stops at the light blue screen right before the installation menu comes up. (the one that says ""welcome to whateverOSthisis"") What can I do to get past it? My USB just becomes inactive at the blue screen.

So here's my problem, i've put the .img on my USB with your USBit ON Device Mode, went to boot it, and at first I was like, ""cool it works"" but then unlike what yours did, my codes started scrolling but it doesn't scroll for even 5 seconds and it goes black, then lights up. I figured at first ""Ok, maybe Ihave to wait"" So I waited, watched the screen for a good 15 minutes, nothing happened. I started regularly, and started with -v, same thing. (Note my USB was in NTFS) So, I tried your ISO, from the tutorial video. This time on the ISO, the mac screen pops up, does the little loading thing at the bottom, THEN it goes black, and lights up. ( same as the .img) So at the moment, i'm formatting my USB again and putting it in FAT32 then putting the .img on it, and i'll try to boot it again.. 

But yeah does anybody know how to fix this issue?

P.S. i'm so psyched, i've always wanted a Mac OS.
