Any ""vintage"" stuff from the late 90s is usually good.  They really stuck to the cute ones back then, and the overglamorized women were still in the magazines.

Some really good ones in here for those of us who have had hard drive crashes and lost pics like these.  You must, like, backup and shit."

I remember some of these girls from my download from the usegroups and news-feeds back in the day. Some I have sets of, others I didn't know had done more than single pictures. 
I will definitely seed at gigabit speeds once I've DL'ed them. Perhaps, as there seems to be a damand, I'll pull my archives from the mid 90's and see what I can put together. 
Again Thanks for the great torrents."
