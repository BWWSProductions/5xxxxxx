Macaulay Culkin lookalike (and soundalike) Mike Weinberg steps into the role of resourceful youngster Kevin McAllister in this made-for-TV sequel to the immensely popular theatrical Home Alone trilogy. On this occasion, young Kevin finds himself stranded in the computerized "safe house" owned by Natalie (Joanna Going), the predatory new girlfriend of Kevin's recently divorced dad Peter (Jason Beghe). Combining the technology of the house with his own improvisational brilliance, Kevin endeavors to save a royal heir from a trio of kidnappers, one of whom is the boy's old burglar nemesis Marv Merchants (French Stewart, replacing the first two films' Daniel Stern). Needless to say, Kevin also finds time to befriend an adult "outcast" and to bring his parents back together. Home Alone 4 originally aired November 3, 2002, as an episode of the ABC anthology The Wonderful World of Disney.
