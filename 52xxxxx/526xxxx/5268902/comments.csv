,BasilBrush,2010-01-09T13:24Z,The FIS Tour-de-Ski Womens Stage7 race wasn't shown on Eurosport 2 as scheduled this morning. There's a repeat at 6pm but as I'm out again tonight I'll upload the IBU Sprint mens race instead followed by the FIS Tour-de-Ski stage7 about 1am.
,BasilBrush,2010-01-09T18:04Z,It's not possible to get the biathlon race up for 6pm so it'll have to wait till 1am. This puts the tour-de-ski stage7 race back until 6am GMT.
,BasilBrush,2010-01-10T16:47Z,Try using the magnet links or search iso-hunt
,BasilBrush,2010-01-10T20:17Z,The Biathlon Mass Start Oberhof (10th Jan 2010) torrent can be downloaded from iso-hunt or demonoid.
,BasilBrush,2010-01-10T21:33Z,"Piratebay still down.

The FIS Tour-de-Ski Stage8 Freestyle Val-di-Fiemme (10th Jan 2010) torrent can also be obtained from iso-hunt and demon-oid.

Or use the magnet."

,BasilBrush,2010-01-11T15:19Z,Piratebay posting still down (11th Jan 2010 1pm GMT). I'll post the remaining torrents once posting is working again. If your BitTorrent client doesn't support magnet URI links then look for the torrents at iso-hunt or change your BT client to one that supports magnet links.
