SEASON 2

Presented by renowned stylist Gok Wan, GOK'S FASHION FIX is the stylish survival guide to looking good during the credit crunch.  Whatever the budget or size, Gok will prove thereâ€™s no need to break the bank to look great.  Heâ€™ll reveal how to shop less and choose key items without wasting what hangs in the wardrobe. This is the season where less is definitely more!

Each week Gok meets people and celebrities of all shapes and sizes who are in need of a fashion fix. He'll clear out their closets and reveal secrets to looking fresh and fantastic every day with just a few key items.

In the high street versus high-end fashion face-off, Gok strives to prove that looking fabulous neednâ€™t cost the earth.  In front of 500 eager shoppers, he goes head to head in a catwalk showdown with buyer and shop owner Brix Smith-Start (co founder of Start Boutique). 

While Gok showcases a collection of clothes sourced entirely from the high street, the skyâ€™s the limit for Brix  as she displays investment pieces to drool over.  The public will decide which collection wins.
