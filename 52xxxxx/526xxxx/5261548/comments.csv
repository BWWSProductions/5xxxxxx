,martinfidalgo,2010-01-12T01:00Z,"@david_182: It's not for psone, this .exe files were adapted for play in the computer. If you want games for psone you would download .iso files."
,martinfidalgo,2010-01-12T01:32Z,"@david_182: you can do somethin, I will try to explain me because my english isn't very good.
-Second mause's button on the game that you want, and go to ""open with winrar"".
-Extract the file ""Game.cdz"".
-Open the file ""psxfin.exe"".
-Into this program in ""File > lingua"" you can change the languague.
- Go to ""File > Convert .bin to/ from .cdz"".
After this you will have a .bin file (an .iso type), you must open this file with you cd recorder (warning: OPEN, not burn this archive directly) and burn it. i don't know if the nero works with .bin files, if nero cant open it you can use ""poweriso"" or ""magiciso"".

After this, it's must work in your psone."
