WARNING! This ToXiC release is missing 24 minutes of content! Do not download unless you want to see an incomplete movie!"
,fullofawesome,2010-01-08T09:37Z,"Yeah, it seems to be missing about 25 minutes, but I am unsure of where it's missing from. The end and the credits are intact, so I don't think its that.

My guess is that this is an early copy, almost like a workprint. That or its from some film festival that got a different version."
