This collaboration between Kathryn Hepburn and Cary Grant is not seen often enough. The two are as at ease with one another as they are in the better known film "Bringing Up Baby". In this film, rather than a tame leopard, they are teamed with a dipsomaniac brother, soured on his future by a father whose parenting skills are either anemic or entirely lacking.

The Potters, Nick and Susan, are the secret treasure in this film. They are so relaxed, and so full of joie d'vivre that even having first seen it as a small boy, I was impressed with just how much fun this college professor and his wife were, that I wanted to be a professor myself, at the ripe old age of 10.

What can you say when the young, dashing, up and coming lawyer,the extraordinarily handsome and highly unconventional Cary Grant, falls in love with one of the richest women in New York, thinking she's a private secretary and he should use the mansion's service entrance? Well, when her sister is Catherine Hepburn you can say there's bound to be a more interesting ending than he-obligingly-goes-to-work-at-daddy's-bank and counts-money-happily-ever-after. The stars are at their peak with great chemistry, and Lew Ayres and Edward Everett Horton give extremely fine supporting performances. This film has always been one of my anthems, and Johnny Case something of an alter ego; showed it last night to my 28-year old daughter, who loved Johnny Case and now has a better impression of her old man. A real treat of a movie, on a par with Grant's and Hepburn's best.
