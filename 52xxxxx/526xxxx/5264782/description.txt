Freddie Mercury is truly one of the legendary entertainers of rock music. The long-limbed, brightly costumed superstar was armed with some hot dance movies and a voice of operatic range. In addition to leading the pioneering glam rock band Queen, Mercury also forged a highly successful solo career for himself. His legendary status in rock history was cemented when he died tragically of AIDS. THE VIDEO COLLECTION features every one of Mercury's solo videos.
