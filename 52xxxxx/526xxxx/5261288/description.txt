> Based on the timeless arcade game, Frogger Returns
  delivers the addictive dodge-and-run gameplay fans
  know and love for a new generation. Players are
  thrown back into the hustle and bustle of city
  life to guide their amphibious friend, Frogger, from
  the city back to his home marsh. Frogger Returns
  stays true to the classic arcade gameplay style, but
  is enhanced with improved graphics, a new camera
  angle, and new levels. Streets, sewers, subways, and
  numerous other obstacles and enemies are in play - all
  for the sake of keeping Frogger away from returning
  home! But Frogger isn't surrounded by just 
  hurdles -- new power-ups including time reverse,
  invincibility and time freeze also aid Frogger in his travels.
