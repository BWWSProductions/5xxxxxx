,Valiant91,2010-03-23T02:46Z,I've been having problems with this.  I installed the game just fine.  Every time I try to start a new game I get an error and cannot continue.
,shaggydaggy,2010-05-02T21:12Z,hey every time i hit play at the main menu it goes to a black screen then it shows a message saying there was an error can anyone help me oh yeah and i have windows 7
,Kiat4,2010-05-12T03:01Z,"Okay, Apparantly for some of us, we are getting a repetitive error or something. Whenever I, and a few others, start a new game, It goes to a black screen then it says our computers had an error. I finally learned that I need Magic ISO from Jloct (Thank you by the way) and it happened to me as well. Could someone help with that, because it shouldn't be a graphics problem if you were allowed to at least start the game."
