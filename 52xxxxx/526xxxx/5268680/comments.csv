""suggest you to use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback""
i'm using BSPlayer, better than?"
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-08T22:38Z,"KmPlayer is much better than Bsplayer.With Bsplayer it might glitch or remain behind with the sound.It depends on what kind of processor and video card you have,if it can handle higher video quality."
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-09T00:26Z,Why wouldn't anyone read the description?It's in your face.Like it's gonna make any difference if I put Hdtvrip or hddvdrip.People will still download it if there is no other high quality rip.
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-12T22:24Z,"I will ask everyone who downloaded any of my movies and liked the quality to give them +1 quality because I saw some movies with a lot of thanks comments and -1-2 quality.That's just retarded if you ask me...so remember,+1 if you like the quality."
,Tintin_26,2010-02-23T05:57Z,Brilliant quality... thanks for this epic upload!!
,muk0690,2010-03-03T17:04Z,Is there any subtitles for this? The duration differs from imdb's.... So can anyone help me....?
,muk0690,2010-03-03T17:07Z,Sorry for my precious comment.... I didnt read the description properly
,muk0690,2010-03-03T17:10Z,sorry for the typo too.... *precious*-*previous*
,ribtin,2010-03-10T01:17Z,"so, from what I gather, this is not the director's cut?"
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-03-13T03:30Z,"Runtime: 216 min | UK:228 min (director's cut) | UK:187 min (1970 re-release) | UK:210 min (original version) | UK:222 min (premiere version) | USA:227 min (restored roadshow version) 

Now check the runtime in the description and you'll see which version it is."
,lionheart_khan,2010-03-19T21:44Z,"well, this is great movie but it's not print well however nice try. Welldon,
keep upload for new..... Ok"
[T],Tanauser,2010-05-22T09:25Z,"Do you have the uncut version of it ? (227 mn) ?
thanks"
,malanzirotti,2010-07-27T15:59Z,"My post addresses the question of this movie's version. 

kriss_kringle posted this:""Runtime: 216 min | UK:228 min (director's cut) | UK:187 min (1970 re-release) | UK:210 min (original version) | UK:222 min (premiere version) | USA:227 min (restored roadshow version) 

Now check the runtime in the description and you'll see which version it is"". 

Now, the file's description says: 3h 27mn. This amounts to 207 min. None of the versions listed in kriss_kringle's post is this particular duration. So the question remains: which version is this seed? I wish kriss_kringle came out and said it outright, without beating around the bush."
,zombikayhan,2010-08-17T17:46Z,"If movie hd tvrip, rape scane etc. was cuted?"
,rippervanwinkle,2010-09-06T14:44Z,"A couple of people have asked which version this HDTV rip is and are curious that its time is different than known versions. I was also curious because occasionally TV rips have been cut or cropped in very stupid and unfortunate ways by the broadcaster.  In this case though the movie is extremely well presented. 

Here is some reassuring info:

I have the PAL UK DVD Director's cut edition so I can compare that:

First of all the quality of this HDTV rip is *excellent*, so much better than the DVD. The improvement is huge.

The DVD is on two discs and just as with the theatrical release there is a musical intermission of *about* 5 minutes (on the DVD set this is mostly at the start of disc 2).  There is no intermission on the TV version.

The DVD release is actually 3 hours 38 minutes and 48 seconds, so lets say 219 minutes, or 214 minutes with the intermission discounted. 

Someone asked if the the so called rape scene was cut.  No, it is identical in both versions, no cut.  But in the TV version it starts a full 10 minutes earlier than the DVD.  5 minutes of this is accounted for by the lack of intermission but somehow approximately another 5 minutes is missing. 

This missing time can be accounted for.  The DVD and theatrical release have an extraordinarily long musical intro, about 4 and a half minutes until you see anything on screen. And now remember that there are some small differences between the director's cut (DVD) and the original version.

So there is approximately 9 or 10 minutes cut from the theatrical release.  Add 9 minutes to this rip's length of 3h 27 min and you have 216 minutes, the length of the original theatrical version.

It seems to be the original theatrical version, as shown in cinemas.  And the video quality is *stunning*.

Nice release.  Wish I'd come across it before I spent ages ripping my DVDs and encoding them to h264 and aac. 

Here are some uncompressed png screenshots so you can compare:

As you can see the HDTV rip is great and the aspect ratio while not absolutely identical is close enough (the DVD is 2.2:1, this HDTV rip is 2.222:1 )"
,rippervanwinkle,2010-09-06T14:48Z,"sorry you can ignore either the first link (bayimg) or the third, they are identical.  Bayimg had a brainfart after I uploaded the first image so I switched over to image bay."
