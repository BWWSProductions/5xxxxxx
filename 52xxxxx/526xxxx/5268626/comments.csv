,amandapants,2011-03-18T17:19Z,So I unzipped the file but now when I try to open the app it keeps saying there is an error and won't open for even a second. Did I miss something? What else do I have to do?!
,amandapants,2011-03-18T17:20Z,"I just realized this says it is for snow leopard, I have leopard (10.5.8). I am guessing that is why it isn't working? Does anyone know of a compatible version on TPB?! Thanks!"
