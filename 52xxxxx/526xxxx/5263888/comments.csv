Screen resolutions range from 512*384 all the way down to 320*240. Most, if not all, episodes are TVRips. The picture quality is grainy and heavily pixelated."
,brunster,2011-05-05T17:40Z,No offence - but is this a p**s take? Benn downloading only S14 for about a month - it's supposed to be just over 8GB but I'm only 93% after downloading 9.26GB????
,evantagonist,2011-12-09T12:31Z,"@ Brunster

Did you ever resolve your issue?  I'm trying to download only season 14 too and utorrent still lists the file size as 87.5gb ... I'm just looking for confirmation that eventually this will work, lol."
