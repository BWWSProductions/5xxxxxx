,ScamWoW,2010-01-18T02:03Z,these games suck so much ass
[T],eyezin,2010-01-19T11:47Z,"ScamWoW, this is not site to advertise your sexual preferences. I suggest Google ScamWoWsuxcock.ass "
,blue_star,2010-02-04T17:40Z,"this game is really stupid, unenterprising, boring, rotten.......!!!"
[T],eyezin,2010-02-10T22:42Z,"Well blue_star each to their own. I'm not sure if you've ever heard of crazy spaced out things called Demo's, but from my point of view it would certainly cut down on moronic comments."
,blue_star,2010-02-17T19:15Z,"eyezin ,do not think i am a stupid guy who does not know what demos are. sorry for my criticism. but these types of games are now out out of tradition. i think you are a crybaby who plays such games"
,King.Of.Pop58,2010-02-23T09:58Z,i can´t play it becuse it will not start 
[T],eyezin,2010-02-24T19:02Z,"LoL blue_star, It did take me some time to get over your comment but with counselling I should make It through this difficult time. I don't pertain to know why whom likes what, only that it differs.      "
,blue_star,2010-02-26T16:56Z,"eyezin, I do not understand what you say."
,blue_star,2010-02-26T17:13Z,"eyezin, it seems you are very sensitive to criticism. you can very well retaliate if some comments prove to be very insulting."
[T],eyezin,2010-03-02T23:09Z,ROFL
[T],eyezin,2010-03-03T00:35Z,There are allot of hummer involved in my comments. I had no involvement in the games engine or in its design. The general rule of thumb with Torrents is one suite does not fit all. 
,blue_star,2010-03-09T15:27Z,"eyezin, you consider yourself to be very brainy.
there is a lot of 'hummer' involved in your comments. and its 'humour' not 'hummer'--give attention to your spellings.
by the way, i know you neither are the publisher or the developer of this game. then why do you so feel   so humiliated when i criticize the game. have i insulted you ? if you think so i am sorry.
one last awkard question-which country you are from ? you seem to be a argentinean(the short-tempered ones) ?"
[T],eyezin,2010-03-17T18:52Z,"LoL no I'm not argentinean oops Argentinian, I just drink allot. When my nephew was 8yrs old he liked this game for nearly a week, so there."
[T],eyezin,2010-03-17T18:54Z,Oh and his Dads car does 10000000000000000000kph
,blue_star,2010-03-18T05:55Z,old eyezin still. the same crappy way of talking.
[T],eyezin,2010-03-18T07:27Z,"Yep, next time I'll type it without talking. D'oH! stupid Flanders!"
,blue_star,2010-03-20T07:05Z,You will remain a muddlehead.
,blue_star,2010-03-20T07:13Z,Your mother seems to have dropped you by your head before you were born and you have lost some of your gray matter. 
,blue_star,2010-03-20T07:56Z,"Now, I know what I have written will again stir you up to hurl accusations at me. But bark as much as you like,I don't care. I keep writing comments because, I like the way you respond. Otherwise who would like to argue with you craps and junks."
,_-dzo-_,2010-03-20T15:24Z,Thanks man :)
[T],eyezin,2010-03-20T17:00Z,blue_star my old buddy what's the most comments you've written on a singe torrent? I hope I'm up there with them.
,blue_star,2010-03-21T10:32Z,So now you consider me as your buddy. Then why not we end the quarrel between us two.
,EatMyCrayonzz,2010-03-22T16:29Z,eyezin; You are my hero aha.
,EatMyCrayonzz,2010-03-24T12:36Z,I put it on a disk but whenever I try to play it it tell me to play the correct disk :S
[T],eyezin,2010-03-24T18:24Z,You don't need the disk once installed. You have to replace the Game.exe in the games directory with the one provided.
,blue_star,2010-03-28T08:24Z,"EatMyCrayonzz, if you consider eyezin as your hero, you are no better than zero(craps like craps). "
,frjoop,2010-04-11T19:07Z,"Right so, apart from teen geeks with little else to do other than scan the site for games they are not keen on and leave irrelevant posts creating debate on further irrelevance so that i and others have to glance over a barrage of comments with little/no information on whether the game is appealing or not and of course in working order, is there anyone with a relative/positive comment on this torrent?"
,blue_star,2010-04-13T19:30Z,"There you are frjoop. I knew a third person will pop in some day. I may use the posts for debating, conferencing anything I wish. How does it matter to you? Just ignore the comments that does not appeal to you. And by the way nobody other fools and craps like you would use the comments to find whether these games are appealing, understand frjoop (you bloody crook)."
,prince88011,2010-04-18T19:25Z,"jesus, there was a pc version? i played the hell out of the ps2 version. soooo getting this."
,Coentje80,2010-04-23T19:03Z,Guys Do u hav to extract this game? and if so is WinRar a good program to do it with?
,xelfez,2010-05-07T23:22Z,"Hey, I keep getting an error saying that the game can't start because Window.dll is missing from my computer. How do I fix this????"
,SatanSmiling,2010-06-12T12:50Z,"if your looking to get this game then dont download this torrent its shit, doesn't work, dont waste your time downloading it!!!

[T],eyezin,2010-06-14T19:07Z,"SatanSmiling, I'm sorry I used my powers to make you download and attempt to install this simple game. I thought you had reached level simple, I was wrong.  "

,jassieboy,2010-08-17T09:57Z,i don't get it how can i start this game?
,XxLanexX,2010-08-18T03:24Z,"Hey eyezin!

,AnAnonymousDownloader,2010-12-12T16:47Z,This does not have the game.ini file. I cannot go into debug mode.
,mathx,2011-01-30T16:14Z,"for those who don't understand how to install. MOST games of today you open in either daemon tools or magic iso. 
then look for G: or D: or F: or whatever it'll say for you there. run setup.exe wherever that one is in it. and then replace the original game.exe ? I think it wuz in this torrent, that comes along. anyways replace the original with that one and play..."
,GTXTREME,2011-03-18T14:27Z,"Thank You.
Works Perfectly !! :)"

,TRMxKNW,2011-08-22T12:57Z,"Works great on Windows 7 64bit.

Installed easily, loaded up easily, and everything works fine. The sound is right on, and the game loads perfect. One little thing I noticed that happens to be off is the in-game map. It tends to not refresh often. I don't know if that's from the torrent, or the game itself.

Thanks a bunch though, this is a part of the collection of I've recently downloaded! I want to beat all of the games. :P"
