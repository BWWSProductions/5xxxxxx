This is a working guide and all the files needed to get Peerguardian 2 working on Windows 7 64 bit.  Plus information how to fix PeerGuardian2 from opening then closing to the background.  Also a fix to the P2P List not updating!


This guide was written by myself as I installed PG2 on Windows 7 64 bit

Hope it helps some people out!
