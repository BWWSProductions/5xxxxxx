Not by coincidence, a mysterious videotape falls into the hands of Jupiter Jones, Pete Crenshaw and Bob Andrews during Jupiterâ€™s birthday party in Rocky Beach. On it is a recording of Jupiterâ€™s long dead parents. In their message they want to communicate to their son the key to an especially tricky riddle. The Three Investigators do not hesitate for a second: immediately, they make their way to the abandoned property of the mad inventor Terrill, located in a lonesome wood in Northern California.
