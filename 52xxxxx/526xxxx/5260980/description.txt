Deborah, a 49-year-old mother of two is 
living in fear that her hoarding will lead 
authorities to take her children away again. 
Her husband Ron is at his wit's end. He says 
her hoarding fueled his depression and 
alcoholism. She says his alcoholism fueled 
her hoarding. It all came crashing down 
around them when Ron attempted suicide in 
2003. Now, Deborah's anxiety has reached 
an all time high. She has to make a major 
change or risk losing her family for good. 
Jim, a well educated Bee Keeper, is living 
a double life. He manages a successful honey 
business, but the inside of his home is a 
nightmare. Heather, Jim's 37-year-old daughter, 
will call Adult Protective Services on him 
if he doesn't clean up his act for the sake 
of himself and his eight-month-old granddaughter.
