It Don't Bother Me is the second album by Scottish folk musician Bert Jansch, released in December 1965. The album was produced by Nathan Joseph and Bill Leader, although Leader was left uncredited.[1]
The album features nine songs composed by Jansch, one by Alex Campbell (â€œSo Long (Been on the Road So Long)â€), and the traditional â€œ900 Milesâ€. For this last Jansch accompanies himself on the banjo rather than the steel-string acoustic guitar which he uses elsewhere. â€œMy Loverâ€ has John Renbourn playing the lead acoustic guitar part, while â€œLucky Thirteenâ€ is a guitar duet with Renbourn, based on a song written by the latter and apparently recorded during the Bert And John session.[2] Finally, â€œTinkers Bluesâ€ and â€œThe Wheelâ€ are guitar instrumentals composed and performed by Jansch.
