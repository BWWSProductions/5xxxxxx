,ZERO_BS,2010-01-07T00:11Z,"Thanks! Still gonna miss Steyn, though; He's the only fill-in I listen to on any show.

Hope you guys are paying some attention to Beck too... his last 3 TV shows (radio and TV) alone utterly destroy the Obama administration and the fed.

I always listen to Rush, but find he rarely breaks free from the political angle. As politically brilliant as he is, he's leaving out a lot. GB just pours information on you, which is what we all really need ATM.

Dittos, Rush... stay well."
,thunderbum,2010-01-07T03:40Z,"@ZERO_BS: I'll second everything you said. Well put!!

Have you noticed Glenn saying now and again that his brakes don't need fixing and he's not suicidal?

One of the guys on his radio asked him about it and Glenn said that with the type of people he's exposing, nothing would surprise him.

Thanks again jwhizz for your efforts! :)

Thank God he didn't have a heart attack..."
,protongeek,2010-01-07T04:22Z,Thanks jwhitt62! Keep it up!
,trickdaddy0024,2010-01-07T04:52Z,"ZERO_IS_BS let me get this str8 Rush sucks dick and Glenn does not...You've just confirm that Rush is a bag of hot air and Glenn is not...Today, Rush suggested the head of the RNC, Michael Steele be fired...ZERO_IS_BS after your comments today you can pickup your pink slip...END     Also Mark Shit still suck...Rush makes headlines on Vacation...Mark Shit makes nothing because nobody(except ZERO_IS_BS and thunderbitch) is listening...END "

,thunderbum,2010-01-07T22:51Z,"*yawn* looks like the troll are active again with nothing better to do than try to raise hackles. It's hilarious, really: they'd prefer to prove the old adage of it's better to keep one's mouth shut (or fingers off the kb), than to open one's mouth (or type and send) and prove they're complete idiots! LOL!

Please don't feed the trolls... it's only makes them think anything they have to say is actually interesting...

LMAO!!

,trickdaddy0024,2010-01-08T04:22Z,"""Please don't feed the trolls"" -- thunderbitch TROLL?!? thunderbitch is that the best you can do? Do all you Rush Zombies think alike...
