First album and pumpkin beer tribute album by JDirty out of Denver Colorado. Long time ICP fan and Juggalo scene junkie, JDirty decided it was time to put out his own album after winning the freestyle competition at the Gathering of the Juggalo's (GOTJ) in 2008. A College Degree Well Wasted tells the story of JDirty's roots, and features Mac Lethal, his homies the Axe Murder Boyz, and fellow Canonize artists PRAY, F.L.O.W.S., and Knox Court. Howling at a Harvest Moon was released for free download on http://www.jdirty.com as a tribute to J Dirty's favorite hobbie...beer drinking, and features homeboy Trox.
