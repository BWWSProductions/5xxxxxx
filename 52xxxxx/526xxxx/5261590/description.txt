This is The Elder Scrolls Construction Set, a tool to create plugins for Morrowind. This is only for Morrowind and is NOT compatible with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

If you were foolish enough to purchase Morrowind from Steam rather than on a plastic disc, you may have noticed that the publisher chose not to include these mod tools in that release for reasons that, I'm sure, made sense in a boardroom somewhere. Unlike for its sequel, Morrowind's Construction Set was never made available on the Bethesda Softworks website for download, either. So here it is.

Installation instructions: 
1) Unzip this to your Morrowind folder. If you bought this from Steam, this is probably something like:
C:Program Files (x86)Steamsteamappscommonmorrowind
2) Run TES Construction Set.exe
3) That's it.

If you need the other files (textures and meshes) from the construction set disc to make your mod, you secretly already have them! Just use a BSA unpacker to extract the contents of Morrowind.bsa (and, if needed the expansion pack files as well, Tribunal.bsa and Bloodmoon.bsa) to your Morrowind/Data Files folder. Read more here:
