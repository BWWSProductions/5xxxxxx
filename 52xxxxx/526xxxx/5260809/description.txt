ALAKAZAM MAGIC IS VERY PROUD TO PRESENT THE MAGICAL ARTISTRY OF MICHAEL VINCENT

Once in every generation is born an individual whose work becomes known worldwide as a touchstone for excellence. With the hands of an artist and the soul of a poet, Michael is just such an individual.

His sleight-of-hand is masterful, his presentations are inventive and his performances are the epitome of class and sophistication.

As the only magician in history to have won the prestigious title of ``Magic Circle Close-up Magician of the Year`` three times, Michael has spent the better part of three decades honing his skills to become one of finest magicians that Great Britain has ever produced.

The material on this collection features some astonishing effects from Michael`s repertoire. ``Rhapsodies in Silver`` focuses on magical effects using coins, while ``Other Mysteries`` features some of Michael`s favorite card effects.

Volume 2 continues where the first volume left off with Michael taking you on an introspective journey into his world of magic. Over four DVDs, you will be privy to his thoughts, beliefs and values about the craft  #   of magic.

While the focus is on magic with coins and cards, you will also be exposed to a way of thinking, which can take your magic to another level. The pathway to excellence is all about having a road map  #   and the terrain on this DVD has been laid for you to follow.

Michael amplifies his teaching  #   and mentoring with the intention to leave you moved and inspired to become even better magicians. As you watch it, you will experience for yourself why Michael`s stunning presentations are regarded by audiences and fellow professionals  #   alike as some of the very best in the world today.
