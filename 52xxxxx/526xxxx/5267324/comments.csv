[V],raymondhome,2010-01-08T08:48Z,Forgot to say thank you very much to ToXiC for the effort and generosity...even with the missing footage we still appreciate it :)
,madtown4,2010-01-09T01:41Z,ok why does imdb show this movies run time is 111mins  check it your self  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898367/
,bigough,2010-01-09T15:49Z,Is this the entire movie?
,dixon817,2010-01-10T09:31Z,"~ watched it twice yesterday and it is missing 24 mins of footage. it skips foward twice within the film at 28:40 and at 35:30 am not too sure if these we're equal cuts ( ie: both 12 mins long ) but the story seemed easy enough to follow. overall audio was 7.5 video the same 7.5 film itself 8. well worth watching.~

,flikfanatik,2010-01-10T20:38Z,"Sounds and smells  as though ""hakinyakin""needs
his diaper changing and a dumbtit stuck in his mouth to pevent him from  issuing any more sewage!
I'm sure that in good time this torrent will be amended by ToXic, as he promised at the outset.
SO LET US ALL CUT THE CACKLE!"
