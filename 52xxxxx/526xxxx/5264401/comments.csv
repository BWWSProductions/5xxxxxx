I downloaded this movie from this torrent, and now I can't delete plan 9 from outer space off my hard drive! What gives!?!
Says ""Access is denied""!"
,tylerdean,2012-06-07T06:06Z,@149872 I think maybe either your movie is open in some program while trying to delete or somehow you don't have the correct administrative privileges any longer to delete the file. Oh wait you posted this months ago... I'm just really high 0.0
