,ZetaBeta,2010-01-09T03:28Z,"Congrats on the Skull 2040! 

I know you are busy and already putting up some requests, but I am hoping you will consider my request for The Cove. I have found one  fairly small encode (700mb) in XVID but would prefer h.264. 

here's a link to the one i mentioned but I'm not sure its the best source for you to encode from.

Thanks for considering The Cove, it scored 8.5 on IMDB.  "
