,BasilBrush,2010-01-06T00:08Z,The live edition is always better but unfortunately Eurosport has been taken over by the Tennis at the moment.
,oskarlin,2010-01-06T17:16Z,what about stage 5? Also tennis? 
,BasilBrush,2010-01-06T20:33Z,"Stage 5 is FIS Tour-de-Ski Freestyle Dobbiaco (6th Jan 2010)
It should be up some time between 8:35pm and 8:45pm GMT."
,oskarlin,2010-01-06T21:08Z,I hate GMT! Thought it was CET all the time.. Now I have to wait another 45 mins..
,BasilBrush,2010-01-07T00:20Z,The BBC World Service Radio still works in GMT all year round. UTC appears to be the new name for GMT but it can be +/- 0.9 seconds different (I think).
