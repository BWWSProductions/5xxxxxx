After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.
So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:
                    
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce	      
              
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce	                   
 
http://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce                   
 
http://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce                   
 
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce                   
 
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce                   
 
http://tracker.torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce                   
 
http://tracker4.finalgear.com:80/announce

Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

I was a little surprised when I didn't find the "Bullet in a Bible" DVD by Green Day on TPB. So I found it elsewhere and now I share it here... Enjoy.

The source had no menu: the movie simply starts with no subtitles.

It should be PAL (else my cheap DVD player on TV would show it in black and white)

Keep in mind that I won't seed it for a long time, so it's up to you, if you like, to keep the torrent alive
