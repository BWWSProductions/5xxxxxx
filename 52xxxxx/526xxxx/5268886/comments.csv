Don't expect Aliens kind of quality, just a good movie, at least you wont get bored. Turn the sound up, and get some beers..."

where are Wiki and Metis rips!"
,master__,2010-01-24T16:56Z,If people could learn that RAR files are mutch better than one big file this tracker would be awsome. Everyone would know that the files are the exakt the same as it was for the one who ripped the release. To bad moste people here are to dumb to relize that. have a good life
,Ritsuki,2010-01-29T07:06Z,"@Master
Not only that, if a part of rar were corrupted (due to sudden power lost or windows crashed), you can download individual corrupted rar.
People are just too lazy to unzip it.

Another note, beside the fact that it wont fit on a single dvd-/+r disc, it would be easier for us to dump it into 2 disc. not having to rar it. Rarring a 10GB file is fucking LONG ass time."
,teohhanhui,2010-02-12T17:47Z,"@master__ @Ritsuki: The way BitTorrent works, in this torrent you have 2034 pieces that are hash checked individually. Your BitTorrent client will take care of re-downloading the corrupted pieces. You can be sure that the file you get is as complete as it can be."

Excellent rip, very good quality. Sure it doesn't have RARs but I try not to complain; someone took the time to upload this film so I could watch it for free, so really why should I bitch?"
,Christian777,2010-02-28T13:11Z,"Thanks for the up. 

To the movie, its boring and disgusting. If your into having a closer look into the intestens of humans this is the movie for you. If you like scifi or action steer clear. The is no action to speak of and for scifi fans, the are no scientific explanations or plots of any value in this movie, the ship just is."

At first I thought this torrent was fake but reading trough comments I think otherwise. Maybe somebody else has encountered this and can provide a possible solution. Also i noticed there are always few seeders with 100% witch is odd and that is why It taken like three weeks to download this. Thanks."
,xylolz,2010-03-10T22:12Z,"thanks
please- wait, try free kodec or mkv players, or vlc"

I don't want to be rude, but you probably don't know how the system (ahum, torrents) works. The RARs are an additional redudant level for checksum which is not needed. Perhaps if the RARs had ""recovery records"" they could be used for recovering some lost data. However the ""system"" already provides something checksum per blocks (the torrent's files are broken in blocks) and the torrent itself stores the checksum for each one of those blocks.

So, why the damm RAR? Forget it, m8."
