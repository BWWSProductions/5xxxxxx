Merge is the visual file comparison (diff), merging and folder

source code, web pages, XML and other text files with native application 
performance. Directly open and compare the text from Microsoft Office 
(Word and Excel), OpenDocument, PDF and RTF files. Compare images and 
binary files. Synchronize folders. Perform code reviews and audits. Work 
with folder hierarchies containing thousands of files.
