,Damien74,2010-08-12T01:24Z,"This release is FAKE. You have to fill in a form etc to get to install. Do NOT do that is my strong recommendation.
Ok this was not only for x64, confused it with another release. It was worse."

,hothotsoup,2011-04-29T04:00Z,"sorry to say but this is FAKE.  It first tries to install a bogus flash player, then it ask for you phone number so it can ""unlock"" the installer. Even when you put in a number it doesn't work."
