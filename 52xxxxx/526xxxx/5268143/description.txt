Tired of boring farming and looking after your patches, while you could anything else?
Well here's a solution: Runescape FarmerBot!

Makes you money while farming and REALLY fast experience in no-time.

Runescape FarmerBot 5.5 is the best Farming bot made in Runescape. It was hidden one, until Ragax wanted to help people with fast experience and best ways to 99.

Some features of FarmerBot:

* VERY fast
* User-friendly, easy-to-use GUI (graphical user interface)
* Easy-to-read on-screen progress report
* Custom walking to/run-away methods from one patch to another
* Any teleport support (only needs the quests and the magic level)
* Working deathwalk to ALL locations
* Equipment buying
* Teleportation random recovery (ex: Sandwich Lady)
* Realistic moving.
* Mis-clicking for anti-ban
* New Autoanswer (If another players says Hi, it answers Hi) - Can be turned off.
* Built-in breaking system (if needed)
* Lots of custom anti-ban procedures
* Solves all random events
* Doesn't use your mouse! - You can run multiple tasks on your computer like play other games or check your e-mail and the bot will not interfere!

AND LOTS OF MORE!

NB! - If the bot doesn't work, you probably haven't installed .NET Framework 2.0.
