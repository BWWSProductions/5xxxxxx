NOTES:
Here is another release from ToXiC. This time we bring you
The Road DVDSCR. Enjoy!

***ALSO THIS IS COMPLETE MOVIE, THE REASON IT'S 1:27 LONG IS BECAUSE IT WAS ENCODED AT 29.97 FPS.***

WORK DONE:
Firstly we took the vobs that were given to us by a friend a.k.a. Mr. Anonymous and ran some filters to brighten the picture as it was really dark, adjusted gamma and sharpened the picture a bit.

Kept source audio.

PLEASE GO OUT & SUPPORT THIS MOVIE AT THE THEATERS IF YOU ENJOY IT :)
