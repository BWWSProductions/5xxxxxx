         Great rendering engine using small system resources while displaying stunning graphic landscapes, dense vegitation, high resolution textures and animals with detailed hair!! Seriously this game boasts graphics near that of an XBOX 360! 

         Through your trophy hunts you'll have to climb cliffs, balance for your life over logs and much more!
personally I give it  4.5 out of 5*

Great game!

I Purchased a legitimate copy of this game, this is a untampered copy! Ripped it straight to an Iso for you guys!
(might as well not even put all that in there but I couldn't find a ligit copy on TPB, and I said I'd post so here is a fresh copy!)
