,lloss,2010-01-16T00:26Z,Is a REPACK version be released? =/
,lloss,2010-01-16T23:39Z,"I was complaining about the soud before a I downloaded it but I watched it anyways and I was unable to notice any problems with the audio nor video. It's all perfect. I watched it on my notebook using a Koss headphone. 
Very good movie! I liked it! 
There is no need for a Repack version. 
Thank you cgaurav007! =)"
