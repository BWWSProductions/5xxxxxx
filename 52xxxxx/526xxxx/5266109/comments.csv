,misterw,2010-01-07T19:10Z,FAKE
,mcmanly,2010-01-07T21:19Z,"Misterw: Please explain.
Like I said, this is my first attempt at doing this, so I can't guarantee I didn't screw up somewhere."
,mcmanly,2010-01-07T23:32Z,"Hmm, my torrent client says I'm seeding. Is there something in particular I have to do to get it to show up on here?"
,mcmanly,2010-01-07T23:56Z,"I double checked the tutorial in the FAQ and apparently I did it all right.

Advice?"
,Juliusthegreat,2010-01-10T19:48Z,"Thanks alot. I have been waiting for this a long time. I hope you find the other parts and you have done everything ok with the upload. I guess one reason that someone sreamed out fake was that it sayÂ´s from: anonymus and many who upload with anonymus is often a fake torrent.

THIS IS NOT A FAKE AND QUALITY VERY NICE.

Thanks again"
,achevanesa,2010-01-19T21:08Z,can someone seed it?
,mcmanly,2010-05-09T12:55Z,"I'm going to be reseeding this again for a while. I managed to get hold of part 2, so I'll upload individual episodes and another containing all 3 parts."
