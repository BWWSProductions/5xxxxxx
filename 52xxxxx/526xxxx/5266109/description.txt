"Fallen is a 2006 ABC Family miniseries based on the novel series The Fallen, broken into three parts. The first part was originally advertised as an "ABC Family Original Movie", but nearly a year later, it was followed up with two other parts of equal length over the course of a weekend. Fallen stars Paul Wesley as Aaron Corbett, a good-natured high school student who discovers he is half-human/half-angel. The series inspired a reality game on abcfamily.com which won an interactive Emmy."


I noticed this was hard to find online, so here's part one. No subtitles, spoken language English. There are 2 parts to follow, but I only have the third part. I'll upload the second when I get hold of it.

Please help seed this when you've downloaded it :)
