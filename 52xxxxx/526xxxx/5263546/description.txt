Misscommunication is the central theme in this film.  The title refers to the tower of Babel in the Bible.  The story starts in Marokko with two boys that just for the fun of it shoot a gun.  This causes a chain reaction that change the lives of people on three coninents forever.  Fantastic acting by Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Gael Garcia Bernal.  2hrs and 9 minutes.
