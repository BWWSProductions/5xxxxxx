,mudvayne1993,2010-01-08T21:20Z,I guess this is totaly Bullshit
,Danceboy_Dutchie,2010-01-08T21:30Z,"Nope it's not bullshit, I use these settings for more then a year now and my download speed increased from 200kbps to 5MB, of course you must have fast internet for this to happen."
,Danceboy_Dutchie,2010-01-08T21:37Z,"@ Gargravar 

It's not infected! It's just a picture guide, not a program or patch or something."
,shathaa,2010-01-08T22:38Z,"there is atorrent for the same subj before

i applied 

and it work great 

even my friend was not able to exeed 30 kb down 

now he is down more than 500 kb"
,Danceboy_Dutchie,2010-01-08T22:47Z,"''there is atorrent for the same subj before''

Yep.. that torrent came from me, but I removed it and uploaded a new one with slight adjustments."
,bossmj,2010-01-08T23:56Z,"@ Gargravar

You will forgive the indignation if i'm wrong.  How the heck do you have a skull when  you make such unsubstantiated comments?

You waste our time (and your time) coz we have to take xtra steps to protect against infection!  You dilute the brand that is TPB."
,luckievdh,2010-01-09T00:25Z,How can a graphic png-file be 'infected' ?
,jfrede,2010-01-09T04:32Z,"maybe i'm retarded, but even though the comment part is always in the same spot on torrents, but i always forget where i'm going.  but gargravar... do you even download?  like for real.  pull your wiener out of the blender.  this is just pictures.  i've also seen it in .pdf form (heads up, that isn't a virus either), and that is the same thing.  I changed my settings provided by the pictures and guess what holmes, yeah, stuff downloads faster, but holla back cause i'm a bt3 boy.  feel free to hate, but it's a recession and my neighbors don't have a clue what wpa is, so hollerlouyeah (hallelujah) !  no biggie smalls, but really, download and say thank you.  "
,mrkid18,2010-01-09T07:09Z,"@jfrede .pdf files can be infected, but pictures... nooo"
,Balthazar7,2010-01-09T08:25Z,"1. this torrent is clean
2. the instructions are in Dutch
3. the settings are very aggressive
4. the explanations of what each setting does ? is poor.
5. If you live in the USA, Canada or Britain your ISP will flag your account as undesirable using these settings.
6. I would only recommend these settings for geeks or those who have excellent knowledge of torrents.
7. A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing."
,Danceboy_Dutchie,2010-01-09T13:13Z,"people are so scared nowadays like adjusting your torrent settings will blow up your computer or something..

just try it out and see for yourself and let me know if you notice higher download speed.."
,ocyrus70,2010-01-09T19:55Z,"5. If you live in the USA, Canada or Britain your ISP will flag your account as undesirable using these settings..

5a. if you live at my house i will say i don't give a shit i pay you for the internet connection if you don't like it i will go elseware!!..

7a. a lot of money is a grate thing!!.."
,bossmj,2010-01-09T20:34Z,"@Danceboy_Dutchie
PNG files can be infected.  If Photoshop is used to open an infected PNG file, malicious code contained in the file can launch a buffer overflow attack.

This means an infected PNG file could be set up to run programs that could compromise a system."
,Kamidora,2010-01-09T21:22Z,"How can a picture generate such heated argument. 

Danceboy_Dutchie, can you up version in .jpg please. Sorry for our lack of appreciation about your efforts, but to shut these pple up, do it in another format.

Tanx"
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-01-10T08:29Z,people like {Gargravar} these are the biggest alarmist we ve on the torrent community. fabricating rumour. get a life mate. how can a picture become a malware or virus? strange world. if your computer is already infested then sort it out. what kind of antivirus software do you use to screen this torrent? i like to know. hehehehe
,Danceboy_Dutchie,2010-01-10T17:03Z,"for all the people that don't trust this torrent because one fool shouts out 'Ă­nfected' out of nothing.. then don't download it. 

if you stick with slow download speed and don't improve it, it's your problem. I don't give a shit"
,GeekHillbilly,2010-01-11T12:59Z,using utorrent 2.1 beta build 17867 on XP x64. I will let you know

,DiSoal,2010-09-13T07:13Z,this is freakin sweet works fantasticly for me +++ literally went from 6.0kb to 30+kb cant beat that
,sfcvaughn,2010-11-04T20:24Z,I went from 20kbs a second to 500kbs-1mbps XD
,tremanrolls679,2010-12-25T07:08Z,hahhhha I was so happy at first to apply these settings. On a horribly slow download it went from 15kb/s to 500kb/s.. However after an hour I had to watch it slowly go back to 15... i wonder why that happened.. oh well.. good for a good hour or half of one at least :D
,MellowStar,2011-02-14T12:09Z,Seems to work well at times. So yes I like it.
,MellowStar,2011-02-14T12:12Z,Works well on and off.I like it.
