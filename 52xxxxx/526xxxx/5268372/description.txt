Storyline: Four kids are driving through the desert on the way to the beach, their faces 
anything but cheery: this isnt Spring Break. Theyre trying to outrun the end of the world and each other. In Ãlex and David 
Pastors CARRIERS, no one is safe from the viral pandemic threatening to wipe out the human race. Determined to elude the deadly 
virus, Danny (LOU TAYLOR PUCCI), his brother Brian (CHRIS PINE), his girlfriend Bobby (PIPER PERABO) and Dannys school friend 
Kate (EMILY VANCAMP) speed across the Southwestern U.S. to reach a place of possible safety. Over the course of four days, the
