,the_devious,2010-01-08T21:26Z,"Whoo-hoo Screwed up the resolution again. FFS, you're supposed to use numbers divisible by 16 that most closely approximate the required AR. Sure, 1280/690 comes to 1.85 but, for ****'* sake, 690 isn't divisible by 16. You're supposed to use 688. Video compression works best with numbers divisible by 16. When RU gonna get this? You're doing a great job, making a lot of people happy, no doubt. All the more reason to get it absolutely right.
So 2.35 AR --> 1280x544 and 1.85 AR --> 1280x688
Jeez!"
,KillaSpiceTSW,2010-01-08T22:22Z,"Why dont you just appreciate the effort, time and work he puts into making this available for all of us for FREE! Its not like hes asking for anything in return!

Ill add this one and Zombieland to my collection for sure. Thanks! :D"

,sxp64,2010-01-30T12:38Z,"@the_devious:
You're right man, it's soo sad they keep messing with quality that way. using old codec-versions too by the way. How hard is it to update a codec? Geez!
Also the audio, when are they going to learn stereo is not mono on two channels (not that this torrent has that, but many R5's have)."

,Frankenstein123,2011-01-11T06:12Z,"**help please**

I received a â€œNotice of Claim of Copyright Infringementâ€ from Comcast for this movie.  I use Easy-Hide-IP with it changing my IP every 5 minutes.  Unsure if it works, but Iâ€™ve been using the site for three months and until now â€“ no warnings.  What can be done to even further disguise my IP?  (please keep it simple, normal person here, not a programmer)"

,unfocused,2011-07-10T19:55Z,"The video quality is great. But I have an echo in the audio. No one seems to be having this problem but me, any idea on how to fix this? I'm using MPC and WMP."
