,neogeo0823,2010-03-13T20:48Z,"I'm getting a wierd problem with the cars and camera. It seems like everything is fine until I enter a car, at which point the camera will go into drunk mode and the car will start smoking badly and won't stop moving forward. Getting out of the car seems to fix this, though sometimes the drunk camera effect remains. 

Any ideas?"
,23joecool,2010-04-09T09:11Z,does 1.0.5.0 fix the infamous STUTTERING effect some computers suffer ?

THANKS!"
[V],Iznogoud9,2010-04-24T14:51Z,"I installed 'Episodes from Liberty City' (the RELOADED version) and it worked fine. Then I tried to launch GTA IV and it stopped responding with a black screen after a few seconds. It was a retail version, I have actually bought GTA IV. I don't know for sure if these things are related, I hadn't played GTA IV for over a year.

Anyways, I dl'ed this torrent, applied the patch and copied the crack to my GTA IV folder. Now it works again. And what they^ said, using LaunchGTAIV.exe to start the game takes care of the drunk cam problem."
,duck4hell,2010-05-07T22:53Z,Said I was missing the binkw32.dll file and it couldn't run - suggestions? I tried downloading & installing the bink file into my system32 folder but then the game just said it couldn't find an 'entry point'....
,Labray,2010-05-09T09:58Z,"When i useL ""LanchGTAIV.exe"" it gives me some crap about 1911.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or contains an error. Then when i close that, it says"" SecuROM Launches has stopped workin"" HELP!
Also: Running GTAIV.exe gives me drunken camera."
