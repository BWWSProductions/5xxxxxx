DVD: 39 minutes

In this video, three people with schizophrenia and one with schizo-affective disorder discuss how they manage their mental illness. The video was produced in consultation with Dr Andy Campbell, consultant psychiatrist, who has a lifetime of experience caring for people with schizophrenia. Dr Campbell also appears in the video.

Medication is a central part of the management of schizophrenia. However it is being increasingly recognised that psychological management, early intervention strategies, recognising and managing cognitive impairment, sensible lifestyle choices, peer support, and the role of family and friends all play a crucial part in staying well. The people who appear in this video discuss all these aspects of the management of their condition. The video provides a realistic yet optimistic view of life with schizophrenia.
