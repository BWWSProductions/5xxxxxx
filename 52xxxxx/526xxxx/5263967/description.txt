                    The Red Dahlia. Part 3.                  
                    Conclusion of a three-part crime drama. DC Anna  
                    Travis is reunited with DCI James Langton to  
                    investigate an ominous re-enactment of the  
                    infamous murder in 1940s Los Angeles dubbed the  
                    Black Dahlia. Langton realises that he and  
                    Travis must pull together to stop this depraved  
                    copycat killer before he strikes again. As they  
                    close in on their suspect and the case reaches  
                    its shocking conclusion, they uncover a world  
                    of sadistic cruelty, a father's evil, and a  
                    family's murderous secret.
