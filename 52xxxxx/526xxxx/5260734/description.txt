Hour 1:

Information overload! 
Even as Dubai seems broke, they open the world's tallest "Superscraper" today, at a cost of 2Bn. The USA could have bought 500 of these this year with the Obama Stimulus alone. 
Whatever happened to the Freedom Tower in NYC? 
Back from the Dead: Former DHS secretary Michael "The devil" Chertoff shills for body scanners for his client Rapiscan. 
US and UK pull embassies in Yemen, while Hitler Clinton saber rattles 
70% of americans polled favor Yemen invasion
More breaking news than you can poke a stick at from http://www.deadlinelive.info



Second Hour: 

We are joined by Investigative Researcher, film maker, activist, and radio host Jonathon Elinoff, who has just released an excellent article: 33 Conspiracy "Theories" That Turned Out to be TRUE...

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
