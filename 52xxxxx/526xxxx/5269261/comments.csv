,Skogswald,2010-08-14T14:28Z,"First episode is encoded with QPel aswell as GMC. Second episode has neither of those. Havn't inspected any further. Point is, there is a chance that some episodes won't play on some stand-alones, whilst others will. Be informed!"

,starfall22,2012-04-24T22:50Z,"Normal Quality... Sound good... few missing episodes tho, 194 and 195... will be seeding till i see all episodes and delete them... Full data on all episodes quality and missing episodes... when ill comment again when i watch them all currently im at 022 episode, so far so good... quality 5/ sound 7
But i guess you cant get japanese cartoons in 10/10 anyway so this is a good torrent by my estimations... except for those 2 episodes that seem to be missing ATM. "
