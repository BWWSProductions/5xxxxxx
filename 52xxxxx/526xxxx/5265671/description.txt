Some years ago, National Swedish TV broadcasted an episode from the Classic Albums series, covering the album 'The Band' by The Band. The episode was broadcasted as a part of the show 'MusikbyrÃ¥n'.

I taped the whole 'MusikbyrÃ¥n' show on VHS, and now I've transferred it to my DVD. The linage is something like National TV -> VHS -> DVD -> XviD.

Introduction is in Swedish, but the documentary is in English (with Swedish subs).

Enjoy!
