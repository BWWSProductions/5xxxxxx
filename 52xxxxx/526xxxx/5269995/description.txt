Eric Clapton
Le Zenith Night
Mid Valley Limited Sampler
unnumbered


Mid Valley Records and Mid Valley Film have put out a number of bonus or sampler CDRs and DVDRs over the years. This is one of them. When Mid Valley puts out a bonus or sampler CDR and DVDR, they are always on either CDRs or DVDRs, never on silver. 

Enjoy!

Lineage: unknown AUD video > ? > Mid Valley DVDR > DVD Decrypter > VIDEO_TS file


NOTE: There are some very minor, barely noticeable, skitters throughout the DVDR, and one lasting 2Â± seconds in Little Queen Of Spades. These are on my Mid Valley original. Whether artifacts of the original source transfer or of the PAL to NTSC conversion, I have no idea, but they are there.
