,buendiatb,2010-01-28T20:33Z,The game is not in English!
,buendiatb,2010-01-31T22:00Z,Delete two text files from the game directory (or its subdirectories): game.? and some other similar file (sorry; can't remember) but they open in notepad by default; the game will be in english then.

bluedeiah is referring that you first remove the non-english wordpad files in the main dictionary then go into the 'Config' subfolder at top and delete the one in there. Once you've done this go to the laguages subfolder next to it and double click on the 'English' driver and away you go!!!

Thanks for the upload bluediath :)!!! "
