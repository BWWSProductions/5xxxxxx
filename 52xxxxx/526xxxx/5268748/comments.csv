,lilars26,2010-01-08T19:45Z,Congratulations 20/40...it's about time.I hope you will call this your new home.
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-08T19:47Z,"Thanks, Blue.Sscreen.Of.Death. I was thinkin' that I have stepped on someone's toe with my ""small-sized"" stuff. I must admit that my number of uploads has been smaller than on name-not-to-be-spoken (I moved-in maybe  two months ago), but it is proportional to number of Thanks, seeders and - oppositely proportional to the number of Hit&Runs, which is enormously high on TPB.
Thanks again. Nice gesture from TPB, my new home."

,jon4fun,2010-01-08T21:01Z,"Congratualtions 20-40. It's about time you got the 'pink skull'.
I hope this means that the issues about TPB moderators & filing your uploads in the wrong area (due to whatever silly reason they had- bitrate?) has been sorted out.

Well done.
Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-01-08T21:04Z,"Hi 20-40,
I have a request for one of your re-encodes.
I came across a file claiming to be an extended edition of Sin City.
Would love to get your version but ONLY do it if it is an actual extended verison, as I have seen the original about 10 times at this stage.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5265292/Sin.City.2005.UNRATED.RECUT.EXTENDED.720p.BluRay.x264-CMCT

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-08T23:17Z,"@Jon: I have what you have asked for, just from trusted source:
Sin.City.2005.Unrated.Recut.Extended.720p.BluRay

But Jon, it is almost 3h long version and I assume re-encoded one will be at least 580 MB.

If you're OK with that, drop me a note."
[T],houruoha,2010-01-09T00:33Z,"Congrats on the ""SKULL""
Keep Up The Good Work

,jon4fun,2010-01-09T02:09Z,"Hi 20-40,
That is a big size (estimate) but it i smuch better than the 2+GB files I have seen.
So the answer is YES. For Sin City with scenes I haven't seen a most definite yes!

Thanks in advance. I'll seed it as long as possible.

Cheers
