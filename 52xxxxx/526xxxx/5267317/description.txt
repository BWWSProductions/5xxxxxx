This program was published in 2009, but IS NOT the latest version (7.2.1). However, it's almost identical to it, and given that it's a real pain-in-the-ass in terms of activation, as there are absolutely NO-NADA-NIC-NIX cracks or serials out there, I guess that's better than nothing  (serial&product key work for every v6 version out there - 6.5.4 was the latest)

The keygen was initially meant for another app from Bluebeam, but apparently works for all. Now if people are able to get the serials and product keys for the other versions, the keygen could be applied and you'd end up with a correct authorization code. So please, if you have access to them, share! (I'd especially appreciate if someone could post a v5 serial and product key, so people with slower computers, for example tablet netbooks, could use this wonderful program in its fifth incarnation - which IMHO is the best in terms of features/speed)

SHARE!!!
