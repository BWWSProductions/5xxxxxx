,SloveniaX,2010-01-08T17:15Z,"you guys are really pathetic. I uploaded this, but wanted to stay anonymous - happy? I have no ambitions of being a high-profile seeder, and I'm on my college network, so I want to stay low. download it and try it, then say if it's fake or not (and it obviously isn't)... idiots"
,SloveniaX,2010-01-08T17:19Z,"and if you need further convincing, take a look at this forum where I posted the RS links more than a month ago: http://forum.esoft.in/office/139354-bluebeam-pdf-revu-6-5-4-working-activation.html"
,black47,2010-01-09T11:02Z,its not fake. its working 100% and its 100% clean great job man. thx alot ive been waiting for this program for ages 
,xxxxxx85,2010-02-13T00:00Z,Hey...I'm looking for version 7/8 keys.. 
,j95215,2010-02-28T09:59Z,"Unfortunately, I don't have a key I can share with anyone.  A friend of mine bought the software, so I can't share that.  What I can do, however, is confirm that if you get a v8 key somehow, then this works perfectly to activate it... which would be useful for someone who buys it and needs it for multiple computers."
,coppert,2010-03-12T02:31Z,"Thank you SloveniaX, you made my day.  Entering the keys was a bit tricky though, as you had to use the text file for the serials, and the keygen for the other security code numbers.  However, the serials provided by the keygen did not work, just the security codes worked.  

....Which I now see is clearly written in your instructions.

Again, thank you."
,westos444,2010-07-21T05:24Z,I downloaded the file twice and both times would not install.  An error message came up.  
,SloveniaX,2010-07-26T13:29Z,"I downloaded the file, extracted it and successfully installed (=cracked) the program. Everything worked flawlessly, so you must have been doing something wrong... (something must be corrupting your downloads)"
,DragonRider65,2010-08-24T19:48Z,"Iwill download this and help you seed it. I don't need the program, I use Acrobat; but I am familiar with Bluebeam, it's a cool program. So if it downloads I will archive and help to seed."
,Slick135,2010-08-25T07:28Z,Has anyone got this to install successfully on 64 bit systems? I run Windows 7 64bit and during install it gave me a notice saying this install doesn't support 64bit however it still continued to install (in the x86 folder). Even though it finished installing it it'll give me a fatal error when trying to start it up.
,SloveniaX,2010-08-28T20:19Z,"Well, give the 64bit version a try: http://www.pdfdesktop.com/downloads/654/BBPDFRevustandard654x64.exe. Let us know if it works.

You could also play with compatibility settings..."
,SloveniaX,2010-08-28T21:06Z,Another link: http://edgecastcdn.net/0000AB/software/downloads/654/BbPDFRevuStandard654x64.exe
,psylock99,2010-09-04T07:31Z,tested the x64 version and the activator doesn't work for it.
,SloveniaX,2010-09-04T10:20Z,"I *believe* the keygen is generic and should work with the 64bit version, but the serial and product key are most likely 32bit-specific - so you'll need a new serial/product key for the 64bit installation. maybe there's another workaround to install the 32bit one though... sorry"
,BluECliQ,2010-09-09T16:03Z,"I cannot get the program registered. Regardless what I do, I get messages the the key I'm using has been used too many times. Any work arounds for this? This is the only bluebeam torrent I could find."
,SloveniaX,2010-09-10T03:06Z,"I just installed the program on a fresh XP machine and the registration process definitely works. Here's how you do it:

1. enter the supplied SN and product key when prompted
2. Revu will tell you you exceeded the # of registrations and that you should uninstall the program from your other computers - ignore :)
3. choose ""authorize manually""
4. run the enclosed keygen program
5. enter security ID (shown in the revu window) in the appropriate field in the keygen
6. click ""Authorize me, bitch!"" and get the authorization code
7. enter the code in the appropriate field in the revu windows (no hyphens required)
8. now click authorize (or OK, i don't remember) and start using the program

hope this helps"
,Slick135,2010-09-11T22:19Z,"I can confirm that the 64-bit version (on Win7) works with the download link you provided above (http://www.pdfdesktop.com/downloads/654/BBPDFRevustandard654x64.exe). I just used that install with the serial number and product key you provided in the torrent, then used the manual activation with the keygen your provided in the torrent as well to acquire an authorization code. Now it works great! THANKS!"
,SloveniaX,2010-09-12T00:16Z,"Great, glad to know. Thanks for your feedback, hope others find it useful!"
,stilsjx,2011-01-20T02:52Z,"ONCE I ACTUALLY READ THE DIRECTIONS, EVERYTHING WORKED LIKE A CHAMP.  THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD."
,md3338,2011-05-18T13:37Z,"Hi, I've downloaded the software, but I get the following error when I launch PDF Revu: Fatal Error Loading Bluebeam PDF Revu. Strangely, this happens only when I use Windows XP Tablet Edition 2005 (the program works flawlessly on Windows XP). The error log is this:

I've tried:
- installing NET Framework 3.5 SP1
- installing NET Framework 2.0

Any ideas?"
,md3338,2011-05-18T16:11Z,"After further investigation this happens as soon as svchost.exe launches tcserver.exe. If you kill tcserver.exe manually, you will get a delay between launching revu.exe and appearing of the error. So this could be a TabletPC only related thing?"
,SloveniaX,2011-05-21T07:45Z,"Well yeah, it could be a ""WinXP Table Ed""-only related thing... I'm on Win7 (as fast as WinXP, even on older hardware) and everything works the way it should... Sorry, but I can't be of more help here (I'm assuming the tcserver.exe process controls the touchscreen capabilities in WinXP? maybe you could disable any related services (run service.msc) and see if this helps - but disabling touchscreen capabilities kinda defeats the purpose, i guess...)"
,astrobuoy,2011-07-26T05:04Z,"Win 7(64) installation went smoothly (see Slick135's post). 
Thanks to up-loader."
,bodhimind,2011-08-06T03:40Z,Thanks for the explanation and ending my wild goose hunt. This version is much faster than 9.2.1 anyway!
,poo4532,2011-09-10T06:23Z,Works great. Thanks for the upload!
,fuzzbang,2011-09-20T20:50Z,Thanks a lot-works on 64 bit download!!! :) great instructions-just make sure to enter the security code for the keygen generation
