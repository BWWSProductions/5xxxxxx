,derelikt,2010-05-15T00:18Z,"You'll need HJSplit to unarchive the .001,.002, etc files.  WinRAR will give you an error if you try and open this directly from within. HJSplit is a free program, google it.  Thanks for the game."
,derelikt,2010-05-15T15:23Z,"And, the instructions included in the folder are incorrect.  The paradise.setup.exe is not used (did not work for me at least on either XP or Win7).  Simply join the split files using HJSplit, unzip the volume, copy the crack into the unzipped folder, and run.  No install required.  Took me awhile of trial and error to figure this out.  Good game for any who liked Syberia I and II.  Will continue seeding for 6 mos.  Long live TPB.  Thanks for this frank_pe!"

Btw, the game is a bit buggy."
