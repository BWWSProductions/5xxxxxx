,Viridel,2010-01-06T18:15Z,"I do appreciate the upload...  But what's with the RAR's?  Really unnecessary on video files.  All they do is add a few extra steps, and don't get seeded as long (since nobody really wants to host the RARs once they've extracted the file they want)...  Plus they cause an absolute mess for media servers - again, requiring user modification before play.  And if a user has to modify the file, chances are that the torrent won't continue to be shared.

NO MORE RARS

Please & Thanx."
