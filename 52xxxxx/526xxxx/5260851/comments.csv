Games all over the world.

IF you EVER have any extraction problems... use a program Called ""universal Extractor""

If you Have virus issues... Use Avast Anti-Virus, and MalwareBytes Anti-Malware

If you Ever have Codec issues ( aka you can't watch something in windows media player) Download and install "" K-lite Codec Pack ""

if you need a free Mounting Software ( aka no ads, no free trial, just free simple program forever) Use "" Clone Drive""  

All these programs are free... and Are the Very basics you need on your computer. If you have more programs to add, please post..  

( reason why to post-) I'm currently compiling a List of programs that will be the basic free soft ware thats a Pleasure to have on one's system. a program like hamachi is a great example, it's Not something you need... but it's Great for gaming. It sets up a virtual LAN, so that you can play Lan games across the world... especially useful for us pirates who don't have access to the OFFICIAL servers."
