.Hoarders.S02E01.Augustine.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM

14 years ago Jason was removed from his mother 
Augustine's home by Child Protective Services 
because of her hoarding. She was never able to 
clean up enough to have him return. Now, as 
an adult living on the other side of the country, 
he is filled with shame and resentment, but 
unable to turn his back on her. Her hoarding 
has become so severe that she has lived without 
water, gas, heat or appliances for the last four 
years--bathing only once a week at her sister's 
house. Complaints from neighbors have instigated 
a court ordered clean-up and she is now facing 
fines and the threat of jail time. We follow 
Jason as he tries one last time to rescue his 
mother from the filth he escaped from years ago.
