,hijodeperro,2010-08-11T06:48Z,how can i open it or what type of codecs do i need
,justjohn9000,2010-08-13T21:45Z,"Hey Ross13, is it possible to see these?

Thank you"
,shankychan,2010-09-06T17:24Z,"I know that this is a HDTV rip but at least u could've edited out the commercials! And this is not 1080i. All the files are 1280Ă1088 (MPEG-2) & DD, 6 channel (384 kbps). All of u who can't playback these files, just rename the extension from .mpg to .m2ts. If this does not help, u might be missing some codecs. Thanks anyway ross13. Appreciate it."
,shankychan,2010-09-06T17:32Z,Oh & use the Combined Community Codec Pack (i.e. if u haven't already installed a codec pack).
,ross13,2010-12-17T09:56Z,"these HD videos can be played with vlc, if you're not able to watch them then click the record button in vlc and leave it till the video completed playing,  after see the target of the video that is saved in your hard disk
cheers:)"
