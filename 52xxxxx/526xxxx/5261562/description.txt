Happy New Year to all you simmers out there. Well I had to reinstall Jeppview on my computer. Pulled out all my various Jeppesen disks only to find out I had way too many downloads burned to disk. I go a little torrent crazy from time to time, anyhoo,
It took forever and after slooowly going insaaane, I finally got it to install and take the stupid site key so it would run. 

I figured some other poor soul out there just might have the same problem so I put together the three disks needed to do a perfect install every time. Now I do not take any credit for these disks, they are all from some genius who knows what they are doing, I just edited the install file so dummies like me could enjoy a great program like Jeppview.

Zip file includes: Jeppview Flitedeck 3.5 program disk, cycle 0901 D1 and D2, install txt and Jeppesen Chart trainer
