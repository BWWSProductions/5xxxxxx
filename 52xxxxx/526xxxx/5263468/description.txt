.:Description:.

Brain Exercise With Dr Kawashima is a game inspired by the research of Dr Ryuta Kawashima, a prominent Japanese neuroscientist. The good doctor's theories revolve around keeping brains stimulated by performing various mental activities.

When players begin a new game, they must participate in a selection of tests that will determine their brain age within the game. This number is called the 'brain age'. As the player uses the software over a series of weeks and months, their ability to perform the exercises will improve and their brain age will (hopefully) decrease. All progress is charted in graph form and sharing a game gives players the option to compare their results with those of family and friends. Progress can also be shared on the official website at www.brainexercise.eu for worldwide ranking.

Brain Exercise with Dr. Kawashima is a series of quick mini exercises divided into three colour-coded categories designed to give your brain a workout, and to train the three main lobes of the brain - frontal, parietal and temporal - through simple arithmetic, memory games and puzzles. The highly intuitive games are played using the mouse to point and click or simple keystrokes.
