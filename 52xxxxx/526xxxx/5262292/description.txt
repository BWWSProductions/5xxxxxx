This high quality rip is thanks to prettykittyjenna from demonoid. 

May all Sinatra lovers praise her for her efforts!


This set was originally assembled by EMI, Capitol's sister company in the United Kingdom. The set contains 21 CDs featuring every song that Sinatra authorized for release between 1953 and 1961, remastered in state-of-the-art 20-bit digital audio. Each CD contains an individual Sinatra Capitol LP (including singles compilations), but the bonus tracks from the American versions appear on a separate CD here as "The Rare Sinatra".

The sound quality on this box is arguably superior to American remasters, also produced in 1998 for eight of Sinatra's key albums in the United States.
