To those of you who started downloading the horrid quality first, I'm sorry! But while I was uploading it, I found this HIGH QUALITY (TV quality) version, that I GUARANTEE you'll want more.

The 24th Sasuke Tournament; also known around the world (aka, outside of Japan) as Ninja Warrior.

The video files are .FLV, and work perfectly in VLC.

This episode was recorded in December 2009, and aired in Japan on New Years Day, 2010.

THIS HAS NOT BEEN AIRED ANYWHERE ELSE YET.
