1.A KIND word towards other encoders and groups, if you do any dealings with SHENTIYO watch your damned back as
this tosser will promise all these files, gain the file from you..then not give you the agreed files.
he will then have the damned cheek and ask you to pay $500 for his cammed source files...bloody idiot.

ok now thats done

video
1.corrected the video first off with adobe so that you get all the visual with some new filters
2.had to seperate many areas of the video becuase many scenes were on and off color.
3.corrected color to normal skin,
4.corrected color for buildings etc.
5.added brightness and others filters
6.cropped the closest I could
7.sadly i couldnt correct the glare on buildings and faces.
8.couldnt fix this anoying blue color on biuldings that were only on a few areas...maybe it was supposed to be like that?

audio.
1.well this is the reason this release has taken so long, apart from the hardware failures and holiday season
2.I had re done this audio more than several times, i guess I was noticing different filters working different when combined
  and then found parts of the audio needed the correction and not other places, so i decided to adjustthe more important areas.
3.this cuasesd me to spend over a few days on the job, and on the "ive got it" job, i pressed save  but it didnt save when i went back to it
  So i had to do the whole bloody thing again.
4.so i corrected many areas where they talk softly as to me i coudl hardly hear them, but i foudn on the first few jobs that when i adjusted volume
  you would get a shit load of noise and artifiacts , so thats why i spent time on it.
5. corrected a few areas for sync issues
6.after this i corrected the volume for the whole stream and then aded soem more near the end of the project after testing on my tv.
