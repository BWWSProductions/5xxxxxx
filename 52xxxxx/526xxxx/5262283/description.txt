Goodnight Vienna is the fourth solo album by Ringo Starr. It was recorded in the summer of 1974 in Los Angeles, and released later that year. It followed the commercially successful predecessor "Ringo", and Starr used many of the same players, including Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, Robbie Robertson, Harry Nilsson, and producer Richard Perry. The title comes from a Liverpudlian slang phrase meaning roughly, "Let's get out of here."
However, while all three other Beatles had contributed to Ringo, only John Lennon contributed to Goodnight Vienna. Like "Ringo", Goodnight Vienna also became a hit, though a slightly less successful one.
