[V],twentyforty,2010-01-08T08:09Z,"@lilars: LOL, intention well ""hidden""... BTW, I usually do Chef's choice as intro to new seasons.

@horouha: Peace brother... peace.

@sanyam: Well said my friend. Here people just grab thing they need and go. I've learned from experience that such things usually ""kill"" small uploaders, and only ones who will stay are private-tracker sites (where either give some bucks or maintain ratio 1:1 or you're out!) and big uploaders as eztv (where whenever I start the download I give-up seeing 16 hours ETA :-().

@thank_u_h264_1guy: I am fan of ""24"". You can bet I will.

@bigbadbob73: I have DVDSCR of ""The Road since yesterday, but this release has over 28 minutes of missing footage (by group called TOXiC... LOL). I have been waiting for this movie as bad as many of us."
