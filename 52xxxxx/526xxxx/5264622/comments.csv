,Saberoph,2010-11-22T22:12Z,"What's up with your files? After I dl it, it tells me I can't do anything with it. It says the action cannot be completed because it's open in windows explorer. Please close it and try again. What's up with that.

Other than that, the torrent is great, love the quality. Good Job."
,NekroFreq,2011-02-12T08:49Z,"Japanese audio is also available in this torrent, but you will need to download subtitles from another source. thanks for the upload!"

,Mr_n_MrsDreadJonny,2011-03-03T00:39Z,"this torrent is ass, at the end of every episode it crashes my pc= no matter wich player i use and the .mkv formated episodes have audio sync problems wich disable audio if you attempt to skip ahead. im sure its fixable, i however dont have the knowhow- if you do its worth the DL because the A/v is 10/10 other than above issues"

If not, then could someone let me know where I can download Subtitles??
Thanks :)"
,TheJudge137,2011-08-06T00:13Z,So here is my review episodes 1-31 work great have good quality sound and are in English. as for the rest of the episodes i cant get em to work. but im not blaming the torrent i may have done something wrong. BUT... i also found a spyware on my computer shortly after called relevant knowledge and some of those registry scanners. this was my last DL before i found those so after downloading take caution and look for em

,The.Real.Zer0,2012-01-10T02:09Z,"Near as I can tell xemnas991 was right, from 35-64 the episodes are shit, they won't play in WMP or DIVX Plus and my WMP has codecs for MKV,AVI, and real media.  do not download that portion, it is in fact SHIT.  Thanks to the UP for the others though"
