And for those on xp  that cant get it to to work update Microsoft .NET Framework Version 2.0 Redistributable Package (x86)
it does not contain any trojans
in the crack folder there is a setup exe this will install sentinel which is a fake dongle 
then in the crack folder  double click ad_inst.exe and the autodata_keygen then with those open go back to mail folder and install from Intsall.exe hope this helps rest is simple"

,chrisgodd,2011-05-07T12:55Z,"OK So I am a newbie at this. So please bear with me?
I have burned the ISO and verified it. I have opened the .exe. And then the programme tells me it is awaiting the dongle to be inserted? I follow the instructions this time and cannot add anything to the file at C: as it is NOT created as the programme is NOT loaded as no dongle is present. It matters NOT if I try the sentinel drivers or not?? So what am I doing which is wrong? Sorry but the writing on the wall (readme) is incorrect?? "
