Nightwish - End of an Era

This is the show only (no extras) taken from the Blu-Ray release.

Decrypted and remuxed using txMuxer.

1280x720p @ 24mbit MPEG2 24fps (terrible isn't it.. how could they?)

Dolby Digital 5.1 @ 640kbps

Either playback on PC/PS3 or remux back to BDMV standard (using txMuxer) and burn to a BD-R using udf 2.5 standard (I recommend nero) to play on any Blu-Ray player worldwide.

Unlike the DVD release, this IS 16:9 WideScreen.

Enjoy this epic finnish evening.
