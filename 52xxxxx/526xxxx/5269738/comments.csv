,awudu,2010-02-08T10:38Z,"Most of the applications in the mini windows XP environment doesn't work. When you try to run HDD Scan for instance, it says it is not a valid win32 application. And that's the same thing with the other applications.

Acronis true Image Enterprise edition cannot create an active zone because it cannot find it on the HDD.

To me, V9.10 is far better than this...."
