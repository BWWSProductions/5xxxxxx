People complained that the other torrent with much more seeders is slow and the video is chopy...

With less seeders it went very fast, and the picture looks ok; I see no jumps sometimes associated with PAL to NTSC conversions, I just scanned it throught to be sure, it looks allright.

Strangely it seems to be the same size as this torrent...

The director of Torque insists that he was aiming to do an action comedy, but the studio wouldnt let him put in the most outlandish bits.
