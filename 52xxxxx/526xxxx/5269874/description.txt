The Princess and the Frog: Original Songs and Score is the official soundtrack of the 2009 Disney animated film The Princess and the Frog. It was released on 23 November, 2009, just a day before the limited release of the film in New York City and Los Angeles. The soundtrack contains ten original songs and seven score pieces, all but one of which were created, arranged and conducted by Academy Award winner composer Randy Newman. "Never Knew I Needed" was written and performed by Ne-Yo. The songs are performed by various artists most of which lend their voices to characters in the film. The score style varies around jazz, zydeco, blues and gospel.

Shaffer Chimere Smith (born October 18, 1979), better known by his stage name Ne-Yo, is an American pop and R&B singerâ€“songwriter, record producer, actor, and occasional rapper. Since his debut, Ne-Yo has had five top ten songs on the Billboard Hot 100 as a lead artist and two number-one albums on the Billboard 200. Ne-Yo has also amassed a catalog of chart-topping songs that he has written for other artists.

Ne-Yo broke into the recording industry as a songwriter, penning the hit "Let Me Love You" for singer Mario. The single's successful release in the United States prompted an informal meeting between Ne-Yo and Def Jam's label head, and signing a recording contract.

In 2006, he released his debut album, In My Own Words, which contained the US number one hit "So Sick". Then in 2007, he released his sophomore album, Because of You which contained the US top 3 hit, "Because of You". In 2008, he released his third album, Year of the Gentleman, which contained the top 10 hits "Closer" and "Miss Independent".
