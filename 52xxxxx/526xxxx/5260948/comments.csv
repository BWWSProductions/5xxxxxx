,antiterrorstyrkan,2010-03-14T02:49Z,"For you two nitpickers of little knowledge, this IS HD. At least last time I checked 720p was. 

What it is not is so called ""Full HD"" and that is all good and well in this case, for a film of this length to fit on DVD 1080p would just bring the artifacts, and that would just look worse even compared to an actual DVD you think this was."
