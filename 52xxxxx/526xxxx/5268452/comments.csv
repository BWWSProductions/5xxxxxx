,Gagy1,2010-01-09T19:12Z,What happen to the 2 seeders? If you are going to download movie's don't close out after you are finished. SHARE!!

,dixie_27,2010-01-10T17:30Z,i'm i the only one stuck at 84%..BULLSHIT

,DontBeALame,2010-01-11T05:11Z,What would 1 have 2 do on order to start seeding?
,BlueNoc,2010-01-11T05:23Z,It's Downloading 4 for me- almost finished I will continue to seed through the night.
,iMac27,2010-01-11T05:36Z,Has anyone downloaded this more than 84%? im @ 84% for 3 days!!!!! good job sword but plz solve this problem.....thx again...
,cleo774,2010-01-11T14:33Z,hmmm seed noddy
,fordizama,2010-01-11T17:48Z,"I'm stuck at 84% as well.

any seeds?"
,iMac27,2010-01-12T00:12Z,There is no problem with seeding... none can download 100%. everyone stucked @84%. so how could they seed?
,cleo774,2010-01-12T13:49Z,"hey swordfish...your lucky that my favourite number is 84... :)

No but seriously get ur shit together"
,iMac27,2010-01-13T04:44Z,This torrent is f***ed. He is not even answering or responding what happens. This is s h i t. Can anyone else plz do this movie again?
,wooks79,2010-01-13T06:22Z,"Akamaru, would there be any chance I could get a hexagon invite please? Thanks :)"
,Vapre,2010-01-13T16:12Z,"Tis true I guess. I'm stuck at 84% as well. There were no seeders to begin with, which I missed somehow, and I still got a almost 1.3mb download speed. Which I found quite weird, but I'd take it... xD
So... I guess something's wrong around here. Don't bother downloading until something gets fixed here."
[T],Akamaru-,2010-01-14T20:31Z,@wooks send me your email and ll see what i can do.
,bobbyc36,2010-01-14T21:41Z,Is anybody else getting a 1 in parantheses next to seeders now. looks like if somebody logs on we can finish this thing
,gagomania,2010-01-15T00:34Z,"I'd be willing to seed this for a month at least 12 hours a day if i could get the file, anyway you can upload the file again swordhd? it says there's 1 seeder but i still dont see anyone with anything above 84% on utorrent"
,madcrazzy,2010-01-15T01:58Z,"^ im with u buddy, ill leave my computer on for 1 week if i have 2"
,dkporn,2010-01-15T20:38Z,Maybe someone else from the PS3 team can do another upload? Someone who doesn't quit seeding before he's done?
,shankdizzle,2010-01-15T22:15Z,swordHD! Please continue seeding Zombieland! Everyone's stuck at 84%!!! THANK YOU MAN!! =)
,straughton,2010-01-16T09:19Z,"If anyone wants 84% of Zombieland and nothing more, this is the torrent for you....if you're like me, and want the full movie cut stop trying and move on-its not going to happen."
,bigturd,2010-01-16T11:12Z,This torrent seems to be dead. Everyone is stuck 0n 84%.  Where's the seeder? Giving it a -1 for not seeding fully.
,iMac27,2010-01-17T11:33Z,"Zombieland is a nice movie and he uploaded at a very nice time... he should rather deserve a lots of +ves. but see, he got -32 (as of now). I've never seen such a irresponsible uploader before. Irresponsible not bcoz i couldnt download it but bcoz he didnt even bother answering any of our complain. ok someone could say its his torrent, so he can do anything, then ok, 2morrow i'm gonna upload a 4gig file and i'm gonna stop seeding @ 98% bcoz its my torrent..ridiculous... sorry but im so pissed..."
,jazzeon,2010-01-17T13:03Z,do you guys even stop and think if he's alright? something might have happened to swordfish. i hope he's okay.
,donaldinoduck,2010-01-17T15:35Z,"I think there is something wrong with the uploader here...may be he is not well :(

He is a known uploader in another torrent site and if he belongs to the PS3 team then there's no reason why he would continue to ignore the numerous complaints here ...will do a wait and watch ...though I must agree the wait has been pretty long this time !!!"
,wooks79,2010-01-17T22:17Z,"Whilst this is a pain, and I'm desperate for this film, I have to say everything I have downloaded by swordfish on another site had been spot on, great films, great seeding, never problems like this before, so maybe cut the guy some slack. 

My fingers are crossed I can get this eventually, unless anyone else does a ps3 team torrent for it."
,irate976,2010-01-17T23:00Z,Everything I'v gotten from Swordfish has been great. I prefer bricktop myself because his stuff seems to have the best seeding but man I hope everything is alright. 84% is 16 less than needed
,Jackc6900,2010-01-18T04:29Z,"Yeah something is wrong with Swordfish, i've been downloading his movies from the start (here and demonoid) and this is uncharacteristic. Well hopefully he is on vacation or something and his connection got messed up... Cheers!"
,kube2,2010-01-19T07:32Z,swordfish has always done quality stuff. I'm sure there is a good reason
,HeWillSeeTheBigBoard,2010-01-22T16:15Z,"it stopped downloading...
:("
,dkporn,2010-01-23T02:55Z,"So is this officially dead? It's been two weeks now.

Anyone else on the PS3 team have this to upload?"
,bigturd,2010-01-23T08:32Z,Still stuck on 84%.  
,BlueNoc,2010-01-23T20:13Z,"@to everyone waiting...

i got a tip that a PS3team member is in the progress of re-upping this as we speak.

This Torrent is D.E.A.D. I deleted my progress and am patiently waiting for the new one to pop up any day now, I'd recommend everyone do the same."
,bobbyc36,2010-01-26T19:50Z,hey guys. im stuck at 84% also but burned the movie anyway and it played fine. glitches a little at the end but nothing to stop watching it
,chickenliver,2010-05-06T05:44Z,first rule to surviving zombieland is seeding! plz I NEEED MY FIX !!!!!!!! I GOT THESE CHEESSE BURGERS MAN!!!!!!!!!!!
,BTHprimo,2010-05-15T21:33Z,"Hey there's still 26 people stuck at 84%.  If somebody could just finish me off(that's what she said), I'll seed 24 hours a day.  Is this a lost cause?"
,necrocortez,2010-06-04T18:41Z,Oh christ! pls seed!
,fuctup.rm,2010-11-24T16:53Z,Torrent is DEAD. Do not waste your time or bandwidth.
