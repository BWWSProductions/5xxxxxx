Bob and Betsey's home is filled with broken furniture, 
appliances, food, piles of clothes, mounds of books 
and toys. An invasion of fleas and bed bugs has forced 
them and their four children into a tent in the backyard 
where they have been sleeping for the last two months. 
But with the dropping temperatures and growing fear 
of being reported to local authorities, they must clean 
out their entire house or risk losing everything. 
Retired veterinarian Richard, "Dr. Dickey," has spent 
more than half a million dollars filling his house, 
two garages and two storage units with dozens of collections, 
including 60,000 beer cans. His compulsions have cost 
him his marriage and his lifestyle. He is deeply in 
debt and stuck working a low paying temp job. He now 
needs to unearth the gold mine he is sitting on, so 
he can sell his collections and get out of debt.
