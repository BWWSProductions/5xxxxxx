,inuit1,2010-01-09T01:42Z,No need to add subs for french or english. the file has a double audio track! read the title French/English Audio inuit  When I can I put up double audio as I do not like subtitles. Enjoy the film.

,Pyrofou,2012-01-08T14:26Z,"Mon antivirus (Symantec Endpoint Protection) a dĂŠtectĂŠ un virus de type ""cheval de Troie"" (exactement Bloodhound.Exploit.324) dans ce fichier... Suis-je le seul?

I found a trjan virus (Bloodhound.Exploit.324) in this file...
Am I the only one?"
,lattari,2012-03-27T11:17Z,"I checked it with it F-secure and there was no virus in it. Now I don't like complaining but for those who are in two minds about downloading this I warn that the video quality is poor at best. I don't like DVDrips in the first place but sometimes with less popular movies you can't help it. This copy is not what you usually get for this file size. If you want badly to see the movie it is watchable from a 32"" but not enjoyable. Thanks for uploading any way, this is the only copy I could find without hardcoded subs."
