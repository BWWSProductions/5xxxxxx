Major Bummer is a humorous comic book produced by DC Comics in the late 1990s. It was created by writer John Arcudi and artist Doug Mahnke.

Two alien college students (named Zinnak and Yoof) are doing their thesis on heroes in Earth culture. To further their study, they send through the mail EEM's or Extreme Enhancement Modules that, when opened, attach themselves to the heart of the recipient endowing them with superpowers.

Lou Martin is a slacker who, due to the incompetence of Yoof receives an EEM instead of Martin Louis, an upwardly mobile young lawyer and philanthropist.  Lou is endowed with a new muscular body that is inhumanly strong and has super-human intelligence.  The great irony being that Lou enjoys being a slacker; and gaining powers is actually an inconvenience to him. 

Major Bummer was cancelled after issue 15 due to poor sales although it had a cult following.
