David Icke - Beyond the Cutting Edge


Since his extraordinary "awakening" in 1990 and 1991, David Icke has been on a journey across the world, and within himself, to find the Big answers to the Big questions: Who are we? Where are we? What are we doing here? Who really controls this world and how and why?

In this seven-hour presentation to 2,500 people at the Brixton Academy in London, David addresses all these questions and connects the dots between them to reveal a picture of life on earth that is truly beyond the cutting edge.

Nowhere in the world will you see a presentation like this one, which connects the apparently unconnected to form the tapestry of knowledge that can set us free from our collective enslavement by the hidden powers behind government, banking, business, media and all the other agencies of manipulation and control.

What is the connection between ancient history, 9/11, the "war on terror", the gathering Orwellian nightmare and the nature of reality itself? It seems a strange question to most people, but in fact all are fundamentally linked, as Icke so compellingly reveals.

As he says: "Without understanding the nature of our experienced reality and how we create it, we cannot truly understand anything else."

Tens of millions around the world have become aware of David Icke and his work as what he has written in a stream of books has become our daily experience.
