The true story of a man who must suddenly raise his two sons alone after the untimely passing of his second wife. The ill-prepared Joe, who is dealing with his own loss, is confronted with the daily challenges of parenthood while coping with his young son Artieâ€™s expressions of grief. They soon are joined by Harry, Joeâ€™s teenage son from his first marriage, who brings his own personal â€œbaggageâ€ into the mix. Without a roadmap for how to move forward, the three boys decide its best to leave the conventional rules and responsibilities of the grown-up world behind and lead a life based on the mantra â€˜just say yes.â€™
