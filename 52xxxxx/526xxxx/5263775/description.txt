A team of hustlers - Alexis Conran, Paul Wilson and Jessica Clement - expose the scams that cheat tourists and travellers out of their holiday money.

This BBC series was originally aired during spring and summer 2009.

There's some confusion over the numbering. Most bittorrent sites number the two seasons after "The Real Hustle does Las Vegas" as series 5 and 6 respecitvely, while BBC uses 6 and 7 for these. BBC intended 'Las Vegas' to be a series of this show, not a separate show. I've labeled this as season 6 for consistency, it should be apparent by looking at the year and title which series i am referring to.
