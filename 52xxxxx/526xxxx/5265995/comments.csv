,kezarone,2010-01-07T18:29Z,this is the true game???
,Sevdali1,2010-01-07T18:30Z,Yup
,saiyanjin,2010-01-07T18:30Z,yeah but russian and not cracked...what a shit:)
,Sevdali1,2010-01-07T18:38Z,"You have to wait for a crack, and maybe they are some russians wants to get this.
"
,Lucretious,2010-01-07T19:17Z,I think this game might be on its way to setting a record for longest period for remaining uncracked.
,saiyanjin,2010-01-07T20:33Z,"You have right, sorry..."
,5_ESS,2010-01-07T21:04Z,"the reason why this game havent been cracked yet is cuz if u make a working crack, the game will only work for a month.

But if u buy the game 3 persons can play it, u get 3 new ""serials"" every mounth if u buy the game and after 1 month the old ones stops work. but iif u share the game on 3 persons on 3 computors and change some hardware in ur computor the game will stop work.

Can u c why it is hard to crack this game?"
,Ordeal,2010-01-07T22:27Z,Even if it's an effective copy protection system it sure is the most retarded one to date :S
,rocco_sifredi,2010-01-08T09:07Z,I agree with Ordeal...it's an idiot idea.By the way...I didn't know the serial stops working after 3 months.Is that true ? Really ?
,ruslan44,2010-01-08T17:57Z,"Thanks alot man i hope this game works Ubisoft is like the best games company XDD , btw does your upload includes English ??  oh and i would be glad if you told me your msn if you got one man :] and thanks again "

,imovier,2010-01-12T04:13Z,"So in short, this is NOT a cracked version and I'm gonna be wasting my bandwidth dling this version. 

BTW this game is far from being the longest no-crack game. The longest was LineRider Unbound, i believe, with the DAC keys and almost a year of crack time. It was later released by JFK or GOW i think."
,ijkmailru,2010-01-13T12:39Z,"Sevdali1, which version of WinRar was used to create this archive? I've downloaded some peaces from this torrent, but stuck at 4,5%. I probably have some files such as DVD1.MDF from this archive and want to try to recover entire archive and to help seeding..."

,ijkmailru,2010-01-18T14:44Z,"Oops... This game has failed competition for longest unckracked time - keygen has appeared. Here is magnet link for keygen (~700 Kb):

,sa2m007,2010-01-20T09:44Z,Hello ijkmailru.....i had downloaded ur keygen and it asks for HARDWARE ID......how can i get the Hardware id....reply soon please
,ijkmailru,2010-01-20T11:07Z,"You should perform offline activation. 

1. Disconnect from the internet.
2. Run avatar.exe (don't use AvatarLauncher.exe) from the avatar\bin folder.
3. When you are offline game will use offline activation mode. It will collect some info about the system and display Hardware ID.
4. Use keygen to transform this Hardware ID into activation key.
Enjoy"
,ijkmailru,2010-01-20T11:45Z,"Seed please! Spent 8 days, got only 56 peaces of 1120 (5%) with ratio 96."
,sa2m007,2010-01-20T19:22Z,thank u ijkmailru for ur reply.........but my problem i not that............i failed to install the game only.........it asks for a serial key during the installation in some russian language.........ur keygen only works after the game is installed.............please reply soon.......so that i can get rid of that serial part during installation......thank u in advance....
,ijkmailru,2010-01-20T23:44Z,"During installation it asks not for a serial number. I've rumored, that russian installer should ask you to solve a riddle. So, if you have a problem with this you should either translate this text and solve, either ask somebody else to solve it. You may try to EMail screenshot of this riddle to i-j-k@mail.ru, I'll try to solve it. Of course, you may download English version... It's already published here.

P.S. Seed please! Can't complete downloading this russin release..."

,sa2m007,2010-01-22T11:51Z,Hello ijkmailru please fulfill my last request given in ur mail.........
,ijkmailru,2010-01-27T10:25Z,"Problem with riddles were solved, now I can upload full riddle list for russian release. But, unfortunally, can't complete downloading this release! Running client 24 hours per day, already have uploaded more than 200 Gb, but downloaded only ~200 Mb!  If you have complete file, please, SEED - stucked at 4,7% for a week :(  You can also upload it to FTP (Email to i-j-k@mail.ru for FTP link) - I'll seed it for a long period of time...  Also downloaded list of files provided by Sevdali1 in previous torrent, so I should have content of this *.rar, but no luck in archive reconstruction... Sevdali1, please, send any information about archive creation to EMail, possible with your compressor."
