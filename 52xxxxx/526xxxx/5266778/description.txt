           Anna and Max are a young creative couple living together.      
           Anna is a journalist and Max is an intriguing and              
           slightly eccentric artist. Their idyllic relationship          
           starts coming apart when Max develops some strange             
           symptoms. He hears voices and sees visions which force         
           him to withdraw from society and to mistrust Anna. When
