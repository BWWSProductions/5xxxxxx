 thumbs up .
MJ is hard to fit in the storyline. ""hated"" the way raimi used MJ on the bridge, instead of gwendoline.
I am a danish spiderman fan, sinse 1976 to 2000 (still a fan). When i was watching your movies, it felt like you was reading my mind. I am realy looking forward  to see, The Kraven saga, Roger King style. I am  seriously  impressed, of what you have done so far. It would be appreciated if you uploaded your movies yourselve on Pirate bay. Besides the high Quality of your low budget movies, i am Astonish most of all, of the low seeding. Best wishes IN THE FUTURE.
