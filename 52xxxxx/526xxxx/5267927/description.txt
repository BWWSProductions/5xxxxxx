Volume 2 of Amazing Fantasy was a feature title used to introduce new characters for a younger audience.  It was published by Marvel between 2004-2006

The first arc ran through issues #1-6 and featured a new teenaged heroine, AraÃ±a. The second arc, in issues #7-12, published after a short hiatus, featured a revamped female Scorpion and a back-up story featuring the character called Vampire by Night (a re-imagining of the Werewolf by Night concept and a lead-up to Nick Fury's Howling Commandos).

In issues #13-14, the main feature was a two-part story featuring a new hero, Vegas, with western themes in a modern setting, while the back-up story re-introduced Captain Universe.

In an attempt to replicate history, Marvel announced that the new issue #15 would introduce a new generation of heroes in a 48-page standalone issue, in the hopes that they would become as popular as Spider-Man. These heroes included Mastermind Excello, Blackjack, the Great Video, Monstro, Heartbreak Kid, Positron and "the guy in Spider-Man's armpit" (who was on the original 1962 cover). 

The final arc, in issues #16-20, introduce Death's Head 3.0, a revamp of the Marvel UK character, written by the original version's creator, Simon Furman. Issues #18-19 contain two Tales of the New Universe stories as back-up features, while #20 featured a Western-themed backup.
