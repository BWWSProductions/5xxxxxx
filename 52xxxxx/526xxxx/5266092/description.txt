The brilliant story of lost love and illusions., 12 November 2004
10/10
Author: avechersky

The excellent scenario by Alexander Adabashyan is composed from an early Chekhov's play 'Platonov' together with some unpublished Chekhov stories and diaries. The story of Platonov (Alexander Kalyagin) disillusionment and loosing the love of his youth is created with a great skill. The perfect selection and performance of cast, subtle camera-work and a beautiful Russian nature as a background make film extremely enjoyable and convincing.

The portrayal of pre-revolutionary 'intelligentsia', the degraded nobility and arising peasants bourgeoisie is full of bitter sarcasm and irony, unfortunately comprehensible only to those familiar with Russian culture and language. The ostensible conflict between old stiff nobility and impotent trendy younger gentry movement - narodniks (populists) is shown with a splendid humor by two brilliant actors: Yury Bogatyryov (Sergei Voynicev) and Oleg Tabakov (Pavel Petrovich Sherbuk). One can easily see how much similar they are in fact.

This one of the best Nikita Mikhalkov's films is full of nostalgia and apprehensions about the role and fate of intelligentsia in the subsequent history of Russia. One can clearly sense the decline and decadence of pre-revolutionary life with the deep filling of oncoming tragedy hanging over the people, still enjoying their life as much as they can.

One of the top-ten masterpieces of all time, 20 March 2008
10/10
Author: Mihnea the Pitbull from Romania

Ask any moviegoer worth his or her bread (and I mean REALLY worth it!): "Unfinished Play for Mechanic Piano" is definitely one of the best ten movies ever made (I knew a very competent and cultured actor, the late Vistrian Roman, who declared it THE BEST of it all - and I could find no arguments to contradict him... Only a matter of personal taste makes me place on the top Tarkovsky's "Stalker"). Fact is that, as a few other admirers stated above, this Tchekhovian masterpiece IS INDEED PERFECT. Every detail is at its place, the structure is admirably built, the pervasive reality of the estate gradually grows to become unbearable, the characters are incredibly complex and deep (and, of course, played by a crew of genius actors!), and the photography is simply an ongoing series of paintworks.

I saw it for the... seventh time? Or maybe was it the eleventh?... a few days ago - and it made me laugh MORE than even, in the beginning, only to make me cry WORSE than ever in the end. It was hard for me, then, to hold the cinematographic culture course, and talk to my pupils, with a dry knot in my throat... This movie's emotional power is simply irresistible, and the philosophic content, abysmal... Once you see it, once you UNDERSTAND IT, your world will never be the same.

A real treasure, 13 July 2005
8/10
Author: Dolly from United Kingdom

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

A truly great film. Without cloying sentimentality, Mikhalkov portrays a village teacher and a doctor undergoing various stages of emotional breakdown, in this adaptation of the works by Anton Chekov. A village teacher believes his life has had no intent. Hence he is driven to despair and in effect to torment both himself and his young wife. The film's another protagonist - a doctor â€“ hates his patients and his work. The guests staying with a general's wife, are talking about the delights of a simple village life, not really convinced by what they are saying. The classical style chosen by Mikhalkov and the masterful cinematography combine to make this film a real treasure for the lovers of Russian classics. Classical music ( by G. Donizetti, F. Liszt, and S. Rachmaninov ) proliferates throughout, adding to the unforgettable qualities of this captivating drama.

Another Amazing Russian Film, 16 August 2007
9/10
Author: ekeby from wisconsin

Constantly this film makes you reflect on your own life, your relationships, your place in the world.

This slice of life depicts a day in the life of Russian gentry in the late 19th century, warts and all. They're silly and pensive, boring and fascinating, shallow and profound--in short a mass of contradictions, like most people really are. If the theme is the path taken, the plot might be said to be a glimpse of the path NOT taken.

The photography is gorgeous, and the direction and editing are flawless. What makes the film, what really puts it over, are the superb, subtle, multi-dimensional performances.

There is a scene toward the end of the movie where a character goes careening down a hillside, descending into a fit of madness. The camera just observes, but the scene is completely and totally surreal wholly because of the actor's performance. I cannot recall seeing anything like it ever, either in content or skill.

And the last shot of the movie is absolutely breathtaking in its simplicity, innocence, and composition. Movies don't get much better than this one.
