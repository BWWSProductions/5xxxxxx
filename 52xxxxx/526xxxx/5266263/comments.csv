,darin_god,2010-03-19T21:40Z,"Great rip, this movie is a perfect download.

,insommia0608,2010-03-22T03:29Z,"Great quality, but this is not directors cut. "
,zdude123,2010-04-09T13:40Z,Uploader plz comment whether this is in fact the Director's Cut or not.
,zdude123,2010-04-19T10:10Z,"Downloaded this. Aspect ratio is incorrect. Has black bars at top & bottom. In short, amateur rip."
,a_of,2010-05-05T09:36Z,"@zdude123:
No, you are the amateur asshole. This film was originally shot in Panavision widescreen 70mm at ratio 2.35:1, so even on a 16:9 widescreen it will have black bars."
,dlectro,2010-05-21T22:03Z,"The resolution is 720x404, but the movie is actually only 720x307, so there ARE unnecessary black bars.
Not only that, but this is NOT the Director's Cut from 2003. It's the theatrical cut from 1979, so the title doesn't make sense either.
Grab the Director's Cut here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5260023/Alien-1979-Directors_Cut"
,dlectro,2010-05-22T02:40Z,Even better quality here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3576282/Alien.Director_s.Cut.1979.DVDRip.XviD.HaLTRoN.avi
,dlectro,2010-05-22T18:50Z,Here's one that's even better http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4388144/Alien%5B1979%5D2003_Directors_Cut_-_Dvdrip_-_H264_-_D-L33T3_-_%5BPilot
,fuzzybrain,2012-02-18T17:12Z,"what's this with the director's cut? Ridley Scott put unnecessary crap in the 2003 version.

it's like what George Lucas did to Star Wars, or Coppola to Apocalypse Now

they should stop directors from screwing up their movies"
