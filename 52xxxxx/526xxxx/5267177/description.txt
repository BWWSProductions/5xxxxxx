SnagIt 9 makes screen shots as glamorous as they'll get, letting you capture any part of your screen, from a partial image to the entire contents of a scrolling window. You can grab images of Web sites and software applications or pictures from scanners and digital cameras. You even can capture video and record screen action in AVI format.

Version 9 completely overhauls the interface to bring the wide range of editing tools and effects to the surface with a simplified, icon-oriented menu structure that makes SnagIt even more flexible and easy to use. Tools to draw, resize, recolor, and annotate the images are there, as is a menu to add rollover hotspots for linking an image to a URL.

SnagIt 9 also adds automatic image-tagging, a library for saving and indexing every capture, and an image tray for getting to the most recent opened captures. Balloon tips, wizards, and an online video tutorial make it simple for beginners, and its sophisticated capabilities will satisfy advanced users.
