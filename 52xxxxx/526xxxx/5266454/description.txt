Storyline: Ryden Malby had a plan. Do well in high school, thereby receiving a great college scholarship. 
Now that she's finally graduated, it's time for her to find a gorgeous loft apartment and land her dream job at the city's best publishing 
house. But when Jessica Bard, Ryden's college nemesis steals her perfect job, Ryden is forced to move back to her childhood home. 
Stuck with her eccentric family - a stubborn do-it-yourself dad, an overly thrifty mom, a politically incorrect grandma, a very odd little 
brother - and a growing stack of rejected job applications, Ryden starts to feel like she's going nowhere. The only upside is spending 
time with her best friend, Adam - and running into her hot next-door neighbor, David. But if Ryden's going to survive life as a post grad, 
it may be time to come up with a new plan...
