,pcaly,2010-01-07T22:47Z,"SouthBay77
You have to update your WDTV from the webpage.
I am pretty sure this is the problem"
,TommyBlade2018,2010-01-07T23:02Z,"Agree With Pcaly SouthBay77
Try Doing that If not Try Recovering It to Its Old Factory Period When It first Came, It Might me Some Faulty Error

Cause My WD HDTV Media Player Works With With King's Releases....No Problems At All"
,Predator_Alpha,2010-01-07T23:13Z,"@ SouthBay77

WD TV HD works perfectly for me. I bought it just to see Secret_MythÂ´s releases anywhere. Maybe you just need to update your device to version 1.03 (link: http://www.wdc.com/global/webtracking/index.asp?id=1077&url=http://support.wdc.com/download/wdtv/WDTV_1_03_01.zip
You may go to Western Digital site (http://www.wdc.com/), register your product and talk with support team, they helped me with an installation trouble.

,iamjustme,2010-01-08T05:06Z,thank you. great rip!!. whats next?
,amoot329,2010-01-08T11:31Z,"Hey i got a problem and i'm not sure if its my pc or these last few rips. Anyone having trouble with the audio being out of sync? I just got this and Whip it and the video is like 1-2 seconds ahead of the audio.

I've noticed that when the movie first starts playing, there is an obvious jump/skip/lag during the logo for 21st Century. Invention of lying and Pandorum are fine."
,amoot329,2010-01-08T11:33Z,"Oops forgot to mention, i did try YAMB to recreate the audio with the 2ch and its exactly the same, right at the start of the movie, there is an obvious jump for Whip It. Audio is still 1-2 seconds out of sync. Same with Post Grad."
,gamerguy1,2010-01-08T12:56Z,hey secret_myth can you upload norbit and american pie all parts in brrip?thanks!
,countryboy78,2010-01-08T15:26Z,"amoot329,

I noticed the same as you Whip It and Post Grade the Video is about 1 to 2 seconds a head of the audio.

I thought it was just my eyes at first but realized it wasn't.

I just had problems with the 2 videos mentioned above, all other BRIP's from Secretmyth are in sync!"
,cs01417,2010-01-08T21:22Z,Thanks
,Otaku1,2010-01-08T22:57Z,Thank you. Quality +1.
,darin_god,2010-01-09T01:24Z,"I watch Secret Myth movies on my ps3.

Just plug in the flash drive and there it is, no converting, no bullshit.

BD quality.

,pcaly,2010-01-09T21:27Z,"SouthBay77
You are probably right about this release.
I just finished to down. and it seems that the audio is out of sync "
,pcaly,2010-01-09T21:29Z,The problem can be fix with mkvmerge GUI
,pcaly,2010-01-09T21:35Z,"In the end the release is fine.
The problem is in codecs.
I just play it with windows media player and works just fine so forget what i sad earlier."
,amoot329,2010-01-11T00:18Z,"I really don't think its to do with the codecs, i have Klite codec 5.6.1 installed and yet all his other releases have been fine. So far the last 4 releases have audio sync issues. I'm gonna wait n' see if SM responds to our plights.

Otherwise great job SM, i've got your username bookmarked so i check it everyday whenever you get something released :D"
