4AD is excited to release the new album by The Mountain Goats, which is John Darnielle, Peter Hughes and Jon Wurster. The Life Of The World To Come was recorded this Spring and features string arrangements by Owen Pallett (Final Fantasy).

Less a profession of religious faith than an immersion in Biblical poetry and imagery, the songs on The Life of the World to Come take their names from verses that informed or inspired them, or which sometimes, came up against them at right angles.

John Darnielle is one of the most imaginative lyracists of his generation. Since he sat down cross-legged with an acoustic guitar infront of a boom box and pressed record for the first time - more than a decade ago - skewed characters, vibrant images and perfectly-framed narratives have flowed in the hundreds. The Life Of The World To Come is the band's sixthe album for 4AD.

Named #82 out of 100 in Paste Magazine's list of the 100 best living songwriters.

"They're eccentric gems he uses to work out his lyrical muscles -- concise tunes with matter-of-fact lines that tell simple but captivating stories, steadfastly proclaimed in his geek who-lived-to-tell wail." - Paste Magazine
