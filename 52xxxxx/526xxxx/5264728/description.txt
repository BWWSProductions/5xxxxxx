In 1974, a misguided 19 year old decided he wanted to make a name for himself and so, armed with a sawn-off shotgun and a head full of dreams, he attempted to rob a post office. Swiftly apprehended and originally sentenced to 7 years in jail, Michael Peterson has subsequently been behind bars for 34 years and transformed into Charles Bronson, Britain's most notorious prisoner.

For this controversial but critically acclaimed film from director Nicolas Winding Refn (the Pusher trilogy), Tom Hardy physically transformed himself for the role and gives a performance described by The Sun as "utterly brilliant".
