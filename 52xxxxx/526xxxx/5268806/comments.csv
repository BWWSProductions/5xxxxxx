,alllala,2010-01-08T19:47Z,again 20 minutes missing?
,RIggsta,2010-01-08T20:21Z,"What shit fuck releasers this time around, get it together you amateur release groups!!!"
,Bombardem,2010-01-08T20:25Z,"this should just be deleted by a mod if its missing 20 minutes, its not a real dvdscr, its not even a movie if one third is fucking missing..."
,Gravedigger76,2010-01-08T21:31Z,"you are all fucking retards, there is nothing missing.... the difference in movie sizes and length is the way it was encoded. Read the nfo in the original release."
[T],artpepper,2010-01-08T22:09Z,"@Gravedigger76-Please explain how a 1 hour and 57 minute theatrical release is 're-encoded' into a 1 hour 27 minute film?

You fucking retard.

This is the same flawed release a TOXIC. Avoid it."
[T],cirip2006,2010-01-08T22:15Z,"""RIggsta"" why don't you make the real releaser, not the ""amateur releaser"" and you won't be called a ""shit fuck releaser this time around"". All free and still complaining... You don't like it, don't download. Wait till the DVD is out and make your own Rip. Oh, i forgot : you don't know how to rip a DVD..."
[T],artpepper,2010-01-08T22:15Z,"And just in case you still don't get it, @Gravedigger, check out the comments on this release over at rlslog:

http://www.rlslog.net/the-road-dvdscr-xvid-ktks/#comments

Savvy? Retard..."
[T],cirip2006,2010-01-08T22:26Z,"""Bombardem"" you really need to learn to talk, you speak dirty about some stuff that you don't pay for. Some mathematical lessons you need too.
The movie's running time is 111 minutes (1h51'). So one third is 34 minutes and not 20, so shut the fuck up and watch the movie."
[T],cirip2006,2010-01-08T22:36Z,"""artpepper"" they all have right in a way. Even on rlslog is 1h27' (87 minutes)
Go and see for yourself the real time running
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898367/
Still missing exactly 24 minutes (witch might be some extra scenes on DvD).
But the fact that iritates me is that poor education of them who speaks like the badly way they do..."
,uploader1970,2010-01-09T01:20Z,all you idiots that complain about movies that you can download for free should just die! If you're going to bitch then download from somewhere ellse!!morons!!!
,B.C.G.,2010-01-09T01:27Z,"lol cirip2006 good comments,thx for the up but i'll wait for the full one, and just one thing if someone who downloads movies actually does not know how to rip a dvd than they r def retards, I don't think the problem is ripping the dvd, the problem is getting it!!!"
,karloflynn,2010-01-09T02:18Z,"what's the point of upping this with 24mins missing??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
now i know were supposed to thank the uploaders for their efforts but WTF is the point in this"
,Chaosxx,2010-01-09T04:53Z,"And all you retarded whining about people complaining need to stop defending the uploading of incomplete torrents, only idiots will want to download and watch this, only to be cut off and not know what happens in the end until the new one is uploaded. And only bigger idiots keep uploading the same damn thing. 

"
,illuvatar87,2010-01-09T11:04Z,"Any idea when the release will come online with the additional footage? Desperately want to see the movie, as it will only be released over here in two months time."
,kingoflight,2010-01-09T11:51Z,Hey Mr green skull do you know if they are still going to release the non corrupted one later on today ?
,rexhonk,2010-01-09T14:31Z,It's not too short. It's has just been encoded at higher speed and has the music from Benny Hill added to it. As well as hilarious sounds when something funny happens. This has been done because the movie company thought that the movie was far too heavy and needed to be a bit more hilarious. Jack Black and Jar-Jar Binks has also been added to the movie. And we all know that a good comedy can't be longer than 1.30. The speaker voice in the beginning is Cameron Diaz. The soundtrack (by Nick Cave) has been removed and is now replaced by various Weird Al songs and a newly written track by Swedish comedy master Markoolio. Viggo Mortensen has been digitally removed and The Road now has Tom Arnold in the lead. 
,william999,2010-01-09T14:45Z,Is the missing part REALLY relavent to the movie . It might be a boring part . Then again it might be the academy award winning scene - Who Know's!!!!!!!!!
,william999,2010-01-09T14:51Z,GET TO WATCH THIS AND OTHER MOVIES WITHOUT DOWNLOADING AT OUR SITE  ------------- I'm a stupid dick head and want my really expensive computer to blow up with load's of trojan's and viruses DOT COM!!!!!!!!!!!!
,bigturd,2010-01-09T17:15Z,"20+ minutes missing? jesus christ they give green skulls to anybody now, don't they? I'll wait for a COMPLETE version of this. "
,jameshunt,2010-01-09T22:03Z,"wheres the full film, this is fucked up, hunting for a full film!!"
,Jonathan.Bacon,2010-01-09T22:28Z,"Why do different people keep uploading the same movie with the missing 20 minutes? Where are the 20 min missing from? Is it the end or the beginning? If so I dont want to watch, if its just some filler in the middle then why is everyone complaining. More details please"
,lie2me,2010-01-09T22:45Z,"
