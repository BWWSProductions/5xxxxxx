As with the others, I'll be seeding as much as I can."
,tamararashi,2010-02-12T03:26Z,"Wow, thanks so much for uploading this one and the other two also!  Is it possible for you to upload some other of the vocaloid 1 voices like leon and lola?  I really love their voices and I can't figure out where to download them TwT"
,DannyWolf,2010-05-15T10:05Z,"Woops, I forgot I had torrents... XD

Um, I think I have those. I think I have the keygens, too. You still want them? I can put them up, if you want.

For the record, Pocaloid is on here too. I haven't tried it myself, but it may work better than the original Vocaloid programs. Just going by what I've heard/read, anyway."
,RiderRengeru,2010-06-15T03:24Z,"I'm having trouble installing this.  The crack included didn't work and I followed the instructions just fine. 
I uninstalled everything with the Luka program and the Database of Miku and reinstalled the whole package with Miku and tried to install just the Databases of Luka and it forced it to install the editor for that too even though I had an editor already on.. 
And the crack that replaced the EXE to get Miku to work didn't work with the editor for Luka. 
So right now I uninstalled everything from Luka and am now with just Miku installed so how can I get Luka to work?
(Also going into the iso and just running the setup didn't work)"

I have no vocaloids installed on my computer so I don't what the problem is"
