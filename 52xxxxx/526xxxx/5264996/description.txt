*Uninstall all the Vocaloids that you have installed, You must also delete the activation key from your registry(make a backup first) if you have installed Miku,Rin/Len.*

1. Run Luka's peace-out installer. Run the Luka installer, do a complete install.
2. Click 'no' for the Activation pop-up. Don't restart. Don't click next in the peace-out installer yet.
3. Install whatever Vocaloids you want in another virtual drive while keeping the Luka peace-out window open. That also means you can't replace the virtual drive that Luka's in with another Vocaloid (you'll get an error message when you try to crack). Only install the voice DB. (Miku, Rin/Len, etc)
4. After you installed the rest of the Vocaloids you wanted, click next in the Luka peace-out installer.
