Josh Nizzi reveals his techniques for designing robots. 
He demonstrates his entire robotic design process, from sketching concepts in PhotoshopÂ® and creating a rough 3D model in 3ds MaxÂ®, to rendering the model in HyperShotâ„¢ and ï¬nishing the design in PhotoshopÂ®, Josh's approach is particularly valuable in a production setting because it enables the artist to deliver high quality concepts very quickly while simultaneously producing a proxy 3D model that could be used in pre-vis or as a starting point for a ï¬nal model.
