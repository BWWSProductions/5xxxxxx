,raindr0ps,2010-01-08T23:15Z,Thanks for what? A torrent that's never seeded? 
,BG174,2010-01-08T23:56Z,Seed plz...
,AJB2011,2010-01-09T00:13Z,"In spite of what the uploader has stated, no one has gotten past 0.0% and this torrent is not being seeded (at this time).  Why do people do this?  I guess we are getting what we are paying for (nothing for nothing).  Too bad, it might have made interesting reading."
,BG174,2010-01-09T06:22Z,"Well, the UL's only other torrent, posted on the same day, has 140 seeders, so maybe there's still hope.  "
,wtcls123,2010-01-09T12:17Z,I guess his bitch found out.
,AJB2011,2010-01-09T19:41Z,Now that the seeder has discovered how to get his torrent going and this has finally downloaded; I have to say that the book is informative and entertaining.  Thanks!
