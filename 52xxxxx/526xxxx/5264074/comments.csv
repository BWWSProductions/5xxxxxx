I was wondering if you might know how to or have tried to encode your PiZ format or PSP with subtitles (but, not hardcoded subs)? 

The reason , why I'm asking is because my mom is really starting to be hard-of-hearing. So when we watch tv we use cc or movies we use subtitles.

If you know or don't know, please either leave a comment hear or email me!

I have them on DVD but would be nice to have them for the ATV."

,krillert,2010-01-08T16:38Z,@HR Have started to play native now. Gonna flash it and use a external HDD instead. Streaming works only under perfect conditions now with the OS 3. Worked much smoother before but been planning to flash it for a while now and extend the features by the ATV Flash stick.
