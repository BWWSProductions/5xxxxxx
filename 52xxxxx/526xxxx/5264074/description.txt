Designed for direct playback on Apple TV, PS3, WDTV, Xbox360, Popcorn Hour, VLC.

For WDTV Live change extension from .m4v to .mp4
You may also need to rename to .mp4 if you are playing off a USB drive on the PS3.  Should be fine if you are just streaming.

NOTE:
Only download the .m4a file if you wish to use the AAC 5.1 audio.
Use batch script "Make AAC 5.1.cmd" to make MP4 have AAC5.1 audio.
(For PS3, WDTV or Popcorn Hour.  Apple TV, Xbox, and VLC do not need this file.)

Here are when you will notice Apple TV slow frame rates:

(montecito logo)
0:0:28 12000 bitrate
0:0:34
(title graphics)
0:3:05 8300 bitrate
(the go cart race) (around 6000-7000 bitrate, with the splash at end at 12000)
1:14:30
1:15:50
1:16:40
1:17:00
1:17:30

My crummy pc has struggles in same spots with VLC.  Videos are encoded with 1920 ABR, with no limits, so it saves bandwidth and spikes when it thinks it needs it, so in order to fix this there will have to be hard caps put on bandwidth at around 5000 bitrate.  You can watch the bitrate in VLC under statistics.
