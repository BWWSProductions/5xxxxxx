Ever Forthright combines insane guitar sweeps with crushing blast beats while still keeping a melodic feel and even an occasional breakdown. They even have an  electronic feel to them as heard in the song â€œJust Onslaughtâ€ off their self-titled debut album, which consists of 8 demo songs from 2008 and 3 from 2009. Many of their songs show off some of the sharpest, tightest technical guitar play Iâ€™ve heard. One of the finest examples of this can be heard in the song â€œSplit the Hollow Apparatus,â€ which is a 2.5 minute tour de force with one of the most insane guitar sweeps Iâ€™ve heard that transitions perfectly to a ridiculously heavy breakdown of bone-crunching proportions.
