,whitephantom,2010-01-06T15:35Z,Thank you SM.
,iamjustme,2010-01-06T15:59Z,thanks again king. greatest ripper ever hands down. 
,the_devious,2010-01-06T20:45Z,"Since when does 1280/528 come to  2.35? The real AR of this rip is 2.42. Once again, the chance has been lost to resize to the correct AR by using 1280 x 544. Net result: this rip is squeezed by 3% in the horizontal. You only have to look at the actors faces... they're stretched lengthways. I got this one... http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5253480/Whip.It.x264.720p-HR... (better audio since it's 448 kbps)... but still had to re-encode the video 'cause the ripper used 536! Jeez!"

,SouthBay77,2010-01-07T07:01Z,"HEY KINGDOM
 YOU RECOMMEND   WDTV  ... BUT IT DOES NOT FAST FORWARD OR REWIND WHEN YOU PLAY..     IT GOES OFF SYNC..
ANY IDEA WHY THANKS SO MUCH
LOVE THE UPLOADS THOUGH"
,reachvarunin,2010-01-07T07:46Z,"im downloading now., im sure SM will not disappoint   me.,"
,oldSMfan,2010-01-07T09:50Z,"Completely agree with @bratandy.

@the_devious I think this is already the 2nd time I've commented on your comments and I think I am still waiting on your REALLY GOOD rips!! I still cannot wait to see them ... I imagine they must be even better than SM's!! They have to be to be making comments such as yours!

If you criticize it is because YOU can do better!

Cheers!

:O)"
,T-Fish,2010-01-07T15:32Z,"theres nothing wrong with constructive criticism.

its not to hard to go to imdb, check the correct AR then do the math and round to the nearest mod16 resolution.

the_devious didn't just post a rant.

@sm..  thx for the up, not my kinda movie though :p"

,Satrick,2010-01-08T21:42Z,Thanks King!!
,dheltem,2010-01-08T22:30Z,Audio out-of-sync for anyone else?
,Otaku1,2010-01-08T22:57Z,Thank you. Quality +1.
,countryboy78,2010-01-08T23:30Z,"dheltem,

Audio is out of sync for me as well and also Secretmyth's BRIP of Post Grad the audio is out of sync as well.

I've been using Secretmyth's BRIP's for quite some time and think he's the best and I've never had any issues at all until his BRIP of Whip It and BRIP of Post Grad as mentioned above.

Thanks however Secretmyth for all your hard work.  I'll just have to download these two movie from another Ripper.

,sinister007,2010-01-08T23:56Z,SecretMyth thankyou this my first comment that i leave. You by far the best.  
,anyeuha_80,2010-01-09T15:26Z,Keep posting! Thanks so much!
,Unbobbed,2010-01-12T05:43Z,"@ people having audio out of sync issues

It seems to have something to do with klcodec pack, and the way secretmyth encodes his/her recent videos (starting from whip it) because I went to http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/ and installed ONLY MPC (without codec) and the audio was in sync. So for people that are having problems, try uninstalling klcodec and install ONLY MPC. "
,Vid89,2010-01-14T02:45Z,"Audio is out of sync if you use BS, but it's good with VLC and Windows Media.
SM, could you please keep your old way of encoding, cause we'd like to keep using our klcodec. Thanks!"
,bychance,2010-01-24T22:19Z,"Thanks a lot for this movie S.M..
No problem with audio synch.
Nero7 showtime plays it with perfect
audio but not the best video quality.
Windows Media plays it with perfect
video, charachters audio has low volume
while background audio is perfect.
KMplayer plays the entire content perfect."
,RickFrenzy,2010-02-01T06:26Z,Can one of you legends set this up in the DVDR section. Been waiting on this one. Thx mate
,travishb2,2010-02-18T09:24Z,"all of his rips are having this sync problem lately. some people say to adjust your media players settings to a delay of -5000ms if u are watching on a computer and your player supports this feature. If u want to really fix it by remuxing, set it for a -200ms delay. This is what I do and it has worked on law abiding citizen and pandorum. "
,ADNC,2011-10-10T20:34Z,"Don't waste your time on other uploads...this one is perfect! 
A:10
V:10 

No syncing issues with Media Player Classic (+codec)"
,ulovecar,2011-10-22T19:17Z,"Just wanna ask, shouldn't the movie ""type"" goes into ""highres - movie""? :)

Thank you very much secret_myth for the up.. 
You're the best! Currently seeding.."
