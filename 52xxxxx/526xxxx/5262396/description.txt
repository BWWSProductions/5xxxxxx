Storyline: Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) has grown unhappy with the apparent small-town Texas life of 
Friday night football and beauty pageant competition, the football championed by her father Earl (Daniel Stern) and the pageants by 
her mother Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden). She commiserates with her best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat) at their waitressing jobs. Pash has 
a plan to get out: she is applying to Ivy League schools. Bliss just wants to get out and needs a plan and a calling. She finds it 
during a shopping trip to Austin, Texas where she picks up a flyer for a Roller Derby event, schemes to attend, gets invited to try 
out and becomes Babe Ruthless, her alter-ego roller derby character. She makes the team, lies about her age, works hard to succeed, 
experiences her first love with the young lead singer of an Indie rock band, gets disappointed in love, bonds with her new family of 
roller derby girls, fights with her mother to escape the beauty pageant and live her new dream as roller derby star. She manages to 
reconcile all of this, impress and win over her parents and friends, and charts an ambiguous goal to move to Austin, continue with 
Roller Derby, and live her new life.
