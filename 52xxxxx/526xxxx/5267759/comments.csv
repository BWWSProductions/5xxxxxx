,gunemalli,2010-02-02T03:40Z,"the patch works fine on xp/2003 but it don't work on server 2008. The patch says successfully patched but when the program starts to load it throws an error and quits.

The only way i was able to get through this is by using ViTYAN's ukaip files to crack the s/w."

Patch error! Maybe you select not Winroute directory!
I'm selecting C:\Program Files\Kerio\WinRoute Firewall

please advise "
