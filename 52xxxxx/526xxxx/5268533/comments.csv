10/10 on Video/Audio. 
I'm a huge history buff and I found this series to be somewhat intriguing. The facts and information were put together pretty well but the animation was somewhat lackluster. They've got some archived footage from the actually battle, but nothing spectacular. Most of the illustrations are done with what appears to be cardboard cutouts which are pitted against one another.

Overall opinion on the download. 8.5 of 10. Would recommend forsure. "
