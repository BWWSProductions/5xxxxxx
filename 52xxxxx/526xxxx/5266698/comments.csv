,Vossiej,2010-01-08T22:38Z,I was wondering if you could upload Saw 5 for the iPod. I would really appreciate that. Thnx in advance.
,iSmell,2010-01-13T04:00Z,"Good quality like always but seriously this movie sucks, terrible acting/story line. Obviously a low budget script pumped out of hollywood to make a quick buck save your space and d/l carries instead. That movie was excellent although i had a little issue with sound quality in VLC due to my inexperience i would say it was probably something I did but seriously this movie sucks, thanks for the hard work though HR no disrespect to you I love the quality of your d/l's."
