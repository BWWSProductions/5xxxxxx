Death Rally (Original full version ported to Windows XP, Vista and 7)

Death in the Fast Lane.

In late 1996 this top-down racing game took all by surprise with it's addictive nature and excellent gameplay. 

In 2009, Remedy is proud to announce the free re-release, Death Rally for Windows. The original game, ported to run on modern PCs. 


The basic idea behind Death Rally: win races, gather more money, buy upgrades to your vehicle. In between wreck your opponents, shoot your way through bystanders and keep the pedal to the metal!


Game requirements:
Any PC that can run Windows XP SP3, Vista or Windows 7 (32-bit or 64-bit). Please read the readme in the installation package for more information.
