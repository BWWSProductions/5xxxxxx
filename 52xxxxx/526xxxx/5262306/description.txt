Shattering of the carnal commandments, a self-ordained messenger of the Lord Reverend Jerry leads a insidious double life. Passionately imploring his followers to donate freely to his cause, the good Reverend misdirects the funds towards his hedonistic pursuit of sexual depravity at Madame Blanche's - a whore house where he preaches to the painted ladies the true word of the Lord. Meanwhile the Reverend's family is forced to seek affection elsewhere. While his wife easily finds sexual solace with her psychiatrist and his older daughter attends a poolside orgy, his younger daughter must disguise herself to go work at the notorious house of ill-repute, Madame Blanches. The Reverend is so attracted to this new girl who refuses his attentions that he is forced to kidnap her setting into motion the soul-searching climax that makes Lust Inferno one of the most unforgettable films you'll ever see!
