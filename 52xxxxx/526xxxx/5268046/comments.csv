,lilars26,2010-01-08T15:31Z,sounds like it should be funny...thanks 20/40.
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-08T16:01Z,"Oh htctouch, since your first request I have downloaded two Bobbies - one was - I don't know what - a joke maybe - even if size was right. Two parts together - 57 minutes. Frakkin joker... Then I have found a second one - but (LOL) this one was encoded with bad aspect ratio... OK, I have found and just download a third one - but (LOL) I always get ""Unreachable files"" for two parts of 14. 12 I have, 2 don't...

I will be patient, and you must too. Bobby will come, for sure.

@lilars: I guess so, but I haven't been able to watch it."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-08T16:57Z,@htctouch: I have it. Be here on Saturday/Sunday.
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-08T18:35Z,@htctouch: Re-encode just finished. ~338 MB.
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-08T18:51Z,"Sorry htctouch, wrong - it is 359 MB.
It is 2h long epic movie, with a lot of documentary footage."
,n3llo,2010-01-08T19:45Z,A/V anyone?? cheers.
,lilars26,2010-01-08T19:52Z,you have to ask? A-10 V-10
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-08T20:02Z,"People, be reasonable. My encodings are really small, in fact this one is exactly 1 GB smaller than M00DY's screener which has popped-out after my re-encoding.
It can't be better, rest assured. A/V rarely are better than 8/8, but as anyone should see, quality is not a primary goal, but I can guarantee to anyone that a ratio of size and quality is hard to beat.

,htctouch,2010-01-08T20:22Z,"thanx dude .. ill b waiting for u to release ..

n bro what i feel is ppl ask for a/v mainly when its dvd screener or r5 .... ""
ur rips are trusted blindly thats 4 sure""
 but the source isnt trusted ..
like r5 prints myt have t.s or bad line audio .. thats y its betr to add a sample when u upload any screener or r5 .. it jst take 1 min to make a sample i guess

dont mind .. its jst my point of view"
,lilars26,2010-01-08T20:34Z,What I should have said was that 20/40  is an honest uploader and that if there is a problem with the quality he will tell you himself before you download.You will find this to be true if you check his past uploads.
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-08T20:41Z,"@htctouch: Don't worry, my friend, I do ""filtering"". Every single day I do twice or more movies and TV shows than I release. I have dozens of re-encodings sitting here which haven't passed through my own ""filtering"".
Aside from that, if I have not been satisfied with quality, I for sure, would make another one, sometimes even three-four - if I sense that something can be improved.
Further - I do not lie - I have no reason for doing so and I will tell, as you have seen in conversations concerning ""Dance like M. Jackson"" show.
If something is bad AND cannot be improved, I tell that in Torrent comment, directly, and if I have f-ud-up, it was honest mistake and I am sorry if I have ever disappointed anyone."
,joemovies,2010-01-08T20:48Z,Thank You !!!!
,madtown4,2010-01-08T21:07Z,"can i convert this to avi , or will it be screwed up"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-08T21:17Z,"@madtown4: For sure, do not do that. Maybe is better to download DVDR screener or two XviD screeners (xSCR or MooDY, unfortunately 1.4 GB) if you have such standalone player. Maybe... big maybe - I will release 700 MB XviD in next 12 hours."
,weedsmoker009,2010-01-08T21:36Z,Nice:) Thanks...
,zohotar,2010-01-08T23:53Z,"20/40 is the best, never wait for any comments cos I know its 10/10 and if not he will say so !!
thanks for this!!!"
,htctouch,2010-01-09T03:02Z,"who knows betr thn me .. whn i was new 2040 helped me evrytime i needed it ..evn today he do ..

but if some one is new how could v 2040 fans expect that he/she wont ask for a/v .. 
all m saying he/she dint comitd a crime or something by asking"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-09T07:00Z,"@Americanredneck: Then you've seen 2.2 score on IMDb... but -  I'll up it tomorrow 'cause it's impossible-to-get on any other way (all present torrents are dead). It will be encoded as mp4, OK?"
,sassymoon,2010-01-09T07:02Z,you got skulls! :)
[T],MelloYello,2010-01-09T07:41Z,Thanks a lot 2040.  These file sizes are great.  Why anyone downloads a 1 gig movie is beyond me.  You and Holy Roses uploads are the best.
[T],MelloYello,2010-01-09T07:45Z,"I don't even have an ipod.  I burn with convertXtodvd and watch on a 42"" LCD and they look great.  I always check for the smallest file sizes available."
,artienemo,2010-01-09T08:03Z,"very quick download, picture not the best if you are watching on a big screen TV... i would say a10, v7"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-09T11:16Z,"@sassymoon: Thanks sassymoon.

@larrybomb420: Thanks... and BTW, best results one can achieve if converts BIGGER files in smaller formats. However, for my parents, I convert XviD movies and TV shows in DVD (MPG2) format and burn with Nero up to 6 movies or 13 episodes on 4483 MB standard DVDR. Quality is A9/V8, good enough for one-time watching.
You know what? Beyond me are reasons for Multi-GB downloads for the movies and shows that have shelf-life as their duration, 90% of the people DELETES the files in 24h... I know 'cause I've done the pools about, before I came here.

@artienemo: It is very hard to value A/V, it  is somehow stupid to value in absolute terms - it should be related to size. And, as I've said, it is impossible to make it better.
You can read from my answers beforehand, that I KNOW everything you've said and I tell pretty straightforward about in my ""Pro&Contra"" text in Comment a month ago, so I'll re-post it here:"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-09T11:18Z,"
PROS & CONTRAS:

1. Quality

720p Matroska (.mkv) has 7 times bigger picture (frame-size), BUT 10 times higher bitrate (3680 compared to 368) and 2 or 5.1 ch. audio.
File of 720p is 8.38 times bigger. XviD is roughly 2.8 larger than my H264. In turn my H264 encodings are bigger than some XviD encodings, especially ones from Polish ""tvyoyo"" which existed and tagged their encodings as ""XviD asd"". XviD asd was (is) totally inconsistent as method, and their encodings vary from ""phantastic"" to ""unbearably low quality"", what is big problem in collections of TV shows people tend to keep.

Judging from that one might say that small-sized H264 sucks, but in trying to relate such data anyone would stumble on objective/subjective valuation principle and probably get wrong conclusion. Subjectively many things could be better or worse for some, but not for others ? we always judge things from ""our perspective"". Such small frame size has disadvantages by nature: In crowded scenes, for example, man's face could occupy/get only 8 square pixels what is same amount for ""characters"" or ""sprites"" in old computer games. However, it wasn't that bad, right? 

Mathematicaly speaking, regarding all these factors, small-sized H264 is de facto 37% lower than 720p in quality, picture-wise. I am very proud of audio quality, where uniqe and proper downmix bring advantages over 128 kbps MP3 tracks in XviD."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-09T11:18Z,"2. Compliance

Sub-format restrictions (literary - 'cause ALL advanced and nice features of libx264 (H264 codec) must be disabled)) brings wide compliance with myriad of devices; from computers to iPods and clones, PS3 or Xbox ? devices which almost all households have.

Matroska (720p .mkv) is playable only on some (fast) computers which graphic card/abilities may provide non-shaky playback and connection to TV via HDMI.
Number of standalone devices which accept unaltered .mkv is ? negligent.

3. Costs

By nature and by design small-sized H264 generally targets totally different crowd/audience, majority (still over 72%) of people with slow Internet connections, bandwidth restrictions or ? traffic limitations.

Download of one 1120 MB large 720p costs around 2.2 $.
Download of one 133 MB ""big"" file I encode costs 24 cents ? or nothing.
For example, most people (as I had in past) have free traffic limit (mine was 10 GB). In such limit one can ""sqeeze-in"" 76 (SEVENTYSIX) episodes of beloved shows every month, but ONLY nine matroskas. XviD is better, but 28 shows per month is not everyone's cup of tea. Especially if one CAN follow almost all episodes ? instead to pick up few which may be good ? or not."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-09T11:21Z,"So, in point 1. (Quality) 720p and XviD are clear winners. It should be, it must be.
However, everything is a matter of balance. Single factors are only a sign of short-sightedness.

In point 2. (Compliance) small-sized H264 is a clear winner. Even the number of XviD capable stand-alones could not be compared to growing number of PS3/Xbox/iPod devices and their clones. Not to mention computers, because any computer is technically capable for both formats (XviD and H264). Not so for Matroskas.

Point 3. or ""Costs"" is so much in favor of small-sized H264, and only objections will come from people with high-income, fast connections and Flat-rate, where traffic isn't the issue. Target audience are pople who need to save on Intrnat traffic or have slow connections which almost surely causes slow upload speeds/abilities from their side. It brings, lets say, some ""disadvantages"". Downloads are slower than they should be, for many reasons. 

Most people follow stupid advice (urban myth mostly) how they should throttle-down their upload speed to gain on download speed. It is a lie ? one which works only on short distances (until inner rating of peers in swarm is stabilized). It is also not true ? here, where I am a tailor of swarm ""policy"", for phase of initial seeding (where individual download speeds means nothing, just upload speeds and EXCHANGE with fellow peers from same swarm; and in general ? when ""skeletons from closet"" visit and bang their heads ? this time coming from others. Anonymity of torrenting draws the worst from most people, they act as in real lives ? as pure consumers, ""get everything and give nothing"" and ""I am the only one that matters"", I see all this stupidities every day, watch how people with Azureuses kick (ban) anyone else except seeders, how ""crippled"" and ""slow"" uTorrents become ""beast"" when I unleash slot speed and so forth. It is ?sad.

One day, as it has already been seen on P2P beginnings, at the same time it marked the end of eDonkey network, the only people who have stayed are obsessed-hungry leechers, crooks and porn-maniacs which would eat their own flesh in absence of others.

Normal people, in this as in many other cases, are the true victims of such carnivalism (life is just a game) and cannibalism.

,froggydawg,2010-01-10T07:15Z,"This file stutters pretty bad streamed over my network.  Other, much larger (720p) files, play fine with no hiccups what so ever.  Don't know what the issue with this one is.  It plays fine locally on my HTPC (Zotac A-U with xbmc) but every five or ten minutes it has to buffer when streamed from a Mac.  The router and computers are all in the same room less than 30 feet away from each other."
[V],pluto999,2010-01-10T19:45Z,why scr?
[V],pluto999,2010-01-10T19:46Z,anyways thanks
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-10T20:17Z,"@froggydawg: Simple answer; it wasn't encoded for streaming. In order to be widely compatible, limitations of libx264 - especially video-buffer - are to big; for streaming one must use files OPTIMIZED FOR streaming, what is an option, but as unneeded, not used in any of my files.
Files you have success with maybe are not optimized, but their encoding-type (I bet they're few times bigger) pose not such limitations.

@pluto999: My re-encodings inherits input (source) tags. It has been tagged as DVDRSCR (what input is) and..."
