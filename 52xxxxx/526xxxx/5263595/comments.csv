,BasilBrush,2010-01-06T22:50Z,"Digiguide gave this race as Dobbianco. The actual race title at the start of the programme says Toblach. Typing ""Toblach"" into Google Maps takes you to Dobbiaco. Toblach appears to be a small area to the south of Dobbiaco next to the lake called ""Lago di Dobbianco."

Maybe I should get a copy first next time so I can seed in full throttle."
,BasilBrush,2010-01-07T00:23Z,I'm uploading at 160Kbytes/sec so you should be getting at least 100Kbytes/sec download but unfortunately not everyone has fast connections.
