      Nightmare On Your Street - Julie Etchingham investigates the
      battle to curb anti-social behaviour in the wake of the inquest
      into the death of Fiona Pilkington. She meets the mother of a
      severely disabled child who is suffering at the hands of yobs on
      her housing estate and whose plight echoes that of the
      Pilkingtons, and looks at victims' efforts to fight back.
