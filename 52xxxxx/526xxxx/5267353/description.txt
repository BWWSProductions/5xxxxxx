With the Custom Games installer and the Games Launcher to categorize, show screen shots, descriptions and a direct link to the homepage, you will be finding out about the games before you even start them. The Launcher makes it simple enough to find and run games that your 4 year old will be happy to use it.

All the games in this pack are Open Sourced or Freeware, this means you can share this disk with anyone legally. All of the games have been tested to work with Windows XP and Windows 7 x64 but should work fine for any Microsoft XP and above Operating System. Many of the games are low end, so any PC from all ages and graphics can run them, the few included that require a higher end system only take up a little amount of disk space so you can install every one of the games and ignore the ones that do not work, without them using any system resources.

All the games are created to be semi portable using LastOS very own Permanent Portable Games (ppGames) system, these will automatically sort shortcuts in to your start menu and if you need to re install they can be installed/stored on a separate drive and by using the Tools folder on the DVD to re integrate the Shortcuts (With ppGamesGen). None of the games require uninstalling, if you no longer want a game on your PC, simply browse your HDD and delete the folder with the game inside.

To set the games to install to a separate drive to Windows, simply press the Options button and change the ppGames Drive letter. Please note that hiding items will un-check them if made visible again. The ssWPI installer has the power to detect games you already have installed and hide them from the installer.

To start the installation insert the DVD and open the DVD drive through My Computer, then open GamesInstaller folder and file. this will allow you to view details about each game before you pick to install them, Some Instructions for using ssWPI are included in the same folder.

If your not using a LastOS based operating system you may need to download and install DirectX 9 and C++ RunTimes for some of the games to function, I have Included most runtimes with the games that are individualized to each. DirectX 9 Aug 2009 is included in the DVD's tools folder, also a high quality DVD Label is included on the DVD/ISO so you can print it off on to the DVD or as a case insert. Autorun is enabled on the DVD so if your using a OS with Autorun support it will start the Games Installer automatically.

If you install the Games Launcher you will be able to use it to view/find your games to pick one to play, the launcher also allows you to add games to a favorites category so you can quickly put all your favorite games into one easy to find place. The Games Launcher also includes new Database Technology that will allow you to instantly start the Games Launcher without needing to scan your PC for new items, there is a "Scan Games" button on the Launcher to preform this task. To add new games you must learn about SetupS Builder from Team LastOS, the GUI creator is still being developed at the time of release, if your comfortable editing ini files then open the ppGame.ppg for an example of the layout used to add a game to the menu systems. We plan on releasing future volumes if the LastOS.net forum receives enough thanks/feedback posts from a large enough audience.

The entire DVD content has been scanned with Avira Antivirus updated till Jan 1st 2010, any suspect files that may be found on the release are coincidental and not included by Team LastOS. Please report any problems or questions so that we can improve this and future releases. If any non free games are found to be included then check the included link for verification of my sources.
