Now how you managed to do that (in a way that the Trojan will be activated), is beyond me.  I didn't think that was possible.

I just know that Kasperski deleted each of the files upon detection.

Which is a real shame, because now I am missing a bunch of tunes.

When are they going to come up with software that just strips the Trojan, and leaves the original file clean.

So shame on you, Anonymous.  May your balls fall of in excruciating pain."
