Music in Latin either written specifically for, or suitable for performance at, Compline, the night office of the Church.  (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compline)

The tone of the choir, "Stile Antico", is superb.  Compared to, say, the Tallis Scholars, the sound is much softer and more balanced with a less pronounced soprano line, without being in any way dynamically boring (a fault, in my opinion, of The Sixteen who have recorded so much music from this period).  

The tempo of most of the tracks is also slower than one may be accustomed to from other recordings, but at no stage does the music "drag", and this assists with the overall effect from this CD: sublime calm.
