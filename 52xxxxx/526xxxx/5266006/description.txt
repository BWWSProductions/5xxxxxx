Drawing on blues, soul, funk, house and electro, Heavy Deviance - aka Nottingham DJ Wayne Roberts - has produced an album simply riven with eclectic cool grooves. And there isn't a duff track on it either.

Take Safe & Warm, which is both an electro bonanza and a soul-ed out classic. Then Make Me Feel It, which only serves to remind one that house music had so much to offer back in the day but can be taken to another level in the right hands. Sweet 'N' Juicy is neo-New Order slowed down and funked up to great effect with a Chic-style backbeat thrown in for good meassure, while Room To Manoeuvre is a lazy, jazzed out tune with the merest hint of Symarips' Skinhead Moonstomp to add a little extra flavour.

Much as St Germain did with Tourist, with this album Roberts takes a wide-ranging look at his influences and serves them up in a distinct and hugely enjoyable way.
