[V],twentyforty,2010-01-06T11:39Z,"@russel2: I am fan of ""24"" and ""Chuck"". I always have followed them with my re-encodings.
I even prepared a Chuck torrent called
Chuck.BluRay.360p.H264.PRELUDE.for.3rd.Season[4ep.Chef's.choice]
with 360p BluRay rips of S01E01. S01E12, S02E21 and S02E22 as kind of intro to the new season. I'll up this torrent today or tomorrow.

But, Numb. and Leverage were disasters on name-not-to-be-spoken and kicked themselves out - for good.

Two of four, this is what I can do."
