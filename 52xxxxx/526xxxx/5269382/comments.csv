,drklevl,2010-01-09T00:58Z,"thnx, but is it open source ?"
,triggerone,2010-01-09T01:35Z,you can do with it what you want as long as you give credits 
,savaden,2010-01-09T02:04Z,"Nice little app. If you continue to improve it, you should eventually provide seed/leech numeric values in the results window. Does it automatically omit results with ""0"" seeds? Keep up the good work."
,triggerone,2010-01-09T02:32Z,It gives you the torrents with the most seeds first. so the first one has the most seeds and so on
,savaden,2010-01-09T03:08Z,Gotcha. I missed that in the description. Thanks.
