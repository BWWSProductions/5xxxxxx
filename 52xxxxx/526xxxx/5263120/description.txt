Search Engines Invasion of Privacy Dangers

Last hour guest, privacy advocate Katherine Albrecht shared concerns that most search engines such as Google are compiling data on their users, correlating their searches to specific IP addresses. She recommended the privacy search engine startpage.com (also known as ixquick.com) which doesn't store users' data. Further, she warned that email programs such as Gmail scan users' emails for keywords on behalf of their advertisers. She suggested a privacy alternative for web-based email-- Hushmail.
