MOTIV

Working at the edge of the contemporary jazz scene MOTIV mix jazz improvisation with a modern big beat sound. Creating angular harmonies over break beats and funky drum & bass, two horn players and a four piece rhythm section produce a sound and vibe recently described as:

"...low slung funk with a top horn section - blowing free and funky with nods to 'Trane, Miles and The Art Ensemble of Chicago - this is way ahead of most sampladelic outings." - TimeOut ***

"Funky jazz for the 21st century - I can't believe how good this is for an indie release - great players... imaginative arrangements... great music." - Etherbeat Radio

"...some of the baddest, funkiest sounds ever." - Detroit Illharmonic Symphony
