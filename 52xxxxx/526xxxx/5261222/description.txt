This is 13 of my best tracks ever, made with FL studio and a hell of a lot of dedication and time. 
I hope that you enjoy listening to them as much as I loved making them. 
I provide them free because paying for stuff is stupid but if you want to, 
you can donate it helps me pay bills and such.

My paypal ID is ********* EMAIL IN README.TXT
Also if you want to do any remixes I can give you the FLP file.
Just email me at ********* EMAIL IN README.TXT2wufg
You can also email me if you just want to tell me if the album was good or not. 
Critisism is HIGHLY welcomed.

And if you want to visit my forum at http://www.landoflowlight.com/
It is a general discussion forum I run in my free time. 

Thanks for downloading. Happy listening :D
