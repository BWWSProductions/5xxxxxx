PLOT: With stolen top-secret technology, terrorists have created a next-generation Universal Soldier â€“ an elite fighter genetically altered into a programmable killing machine. With this â€œUniSolâ€ (Former UFC Heavyweight Champion Andrei â€œThe Pit Bullâ€ Arlovski) leading the way, they seize the crippled Chernobyl nuclear reactor, threatening to unleash a lethal radioactive cloud. The only one who can stop them is Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a UniSol whoâ€™s been decommissioned for years. Reactivated and retrained, Deveraux must make a full-out assault on the heavily armed fortress. But inside, heâ€™ll discover not one but two of these virtually indestructible warriors. Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren), Deverauxâ€™s vicious UniSol enemy from the original Universal Soldier, has been secretly reanimated and upgraded. Now, these elite fighters are locked, loaded and programmed to kill; and the fate of millions hinges on this high-action showdown.
