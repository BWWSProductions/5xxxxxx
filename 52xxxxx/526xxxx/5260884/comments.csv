,BJornxD,2010-01-05T21:33Z,"how do u mean ""press step 1 ""??
in the patching programm do u click autorun?
cus that didn't work for me,
if that's what u did, try opening the map ""files""
and then ""patches"".
so don't open the program , just go to the patches map and install one by one :)"
,Bimbombalie,2010-01-05T22:26Z,i'm sorry i didn't saw that it was actualy in there and thanks :D i still cant play but thanks XD
,kevmeister95,2010-01-06T01:17Z,"bimbo, check your version number.  you might have a pre-release beta.  I did and couldn't patch it.  I had to download a cracked version all over."

///////////////////
When you updated to 1.0.631 open your
             Download from the patches.
             Go to : files --> patches, and install one by
             One.                        
             All the updates. If you get the problem
             That there?s an invalid file, go to this site and
             Download the 2nd file
             Sims 3 Patch Log Viewer (.NET3.5)         http://www.modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=Game_HelTS3_Patching:Invalid_File_Error 
             That  program should say what file is invalid.
             I only know what you could do if
             It?s the file : skuversion
             If that?s the one you need to change the file.
             It shows the game version as 1.0.632.00002
             Change this to 1.0.631.00002.
             Then just install all updates.
////////////////////////////

where's the  files --> patches route..? I went to the folder Final Version Patch and ran the patch .. it started and at the end it said invalid file so I followed your steps but..  I can't see the web site you linked, therefore i can't get the 2nd file 'Sims 3 Patch Log Viewer ' I googled it and couldnt find anything.. hope you can helpme on this one

sorry, should have thanked you before for the work you put on doing this for us.. ;).

thanks BJornxD "
,BJornxD,2010-01-07T11:38Z,"the website is : http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:TS3_Patching:Invalid_File_Error

if you still can't see it you can go to modthesims , then to the help catagory and type in the search bar ""invalid file"" , you'll find it there :)"
,waffleamos,2010-01-09T01:44Z,I have being trying to get the world adventures pack all day....trying all kinds of stuff and when I finally got it all installed and ready to play it says that I need to insert a disk......what do I need to do?
,BJornxD,2010-01-09T11:33Z,"you need to put the .exe file from the crack in the bin map ( Sims 3 WA -> Game -> bin )
it will ask if you want to overwrite it , do that, if you're scared it won't work , make a back-up"
,Jakeydread,2010-01-11T21:17Z,"I copied it from BJornxD because his guild was helpful but didn?t quite get the game working for me but it contained useful info. After working at it for just over a week I finally got The Sims 3 World Adventure to work. I?ll share with you here how I did it.
Let?s begin:
Step 1 : this is a list of stuff you should download:
-	The Sims 3 (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5022393/The_Sims_3_-_Razor1911_Final_MAXSPEED)
-	The Sims 3 World Adventures (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5168507/The_Sims_3_World_Adventures-RELOADED)
-	Patches (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5234196/The_Sims_3_Patch_to_play_World_Adventures_[PC]___[Sevezone]__)
-	Sims3_1.8.25.003002_from_1.7.9.002002(not included in the above link) (http://download2us.softpedia.com/dl/d112512c96e993f0129886de9837bb0f/4b4a185f/200043741/games/patch/Sims3_1.8.25.003002_from_1.7.9.002002.exe)
Step 2 : When the downloads are ready, you install
             The Sims 3 (load .rar file in deamontools or any virtual drive, use
             Keygen for serial , should install just fine).
             When install don?t replace the .exe file with the cracked one.

Step 3 : Updating is the irritating part. You can get so
             Many problems, but I?m gonna solve them for
             You. The first thing you do is install the patch
             That came with the download of The Sims 3.
             A problem with that could be it says you?re in
             The wrong region. What I did is : Go to
             Search, type in regedit, open the program.
             Go to : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -->SOFTWARE
-->Sims --> SKU
             Double click and change the number (1-7)
             Try different numbers until it?s the good one.

             After you got past that problem , update

             When you updated to 1.0.631 open your
             Download from the patches.
             Go to : files --> patches, and install one by
             One up till 1.7.9_from_1.6.6 then install Sims3_1.8.25.003002_from_1.7.9.002002 . Step 4 : install The Sims 3 World Adventures use the keygen for serial
             It should install with no problem then go on to install                         
             rest of the updates 
the file : skuversion It shows the game version as 1.0.632.00002
             Change this to 1.0.631.00002.

            Doubleclick and you?re ready to play the game

Step 5 : Enjoy the game :D

If you have any problems just leave a comment.

,davskies,2010-01-13T08:16Z,"I dunno if this happens to you but I have not been able to play.. the install went just fine, I followed the guide BJornxD uploaded. Everything was ok, the game starts and loads the main screen but when I try to load the City the fills up to about 15% and the game just closes.

Do you have a solution for this? I tried this but didn't work and I couldn't find the Mods folder:

,AuroraLunis,2010-01-30T12:16Z,"my game loads up fine, but after i select pleasantville it loads about 10 sec and then crashes to desktop without any error messages. has anyone got a solution for this? please help.
