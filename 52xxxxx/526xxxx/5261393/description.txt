X-Plane 9 No DVD for Linux

Converted from the mac .dmg "crack" to a linux usable .img file.

I have looked many time for something like this, so I finally decided to share to others, to make it easier.



Usage:

Extract to any location.

Open Mount Image file, replace **** with the path to where the image is.

Run the Mount Image file in terminal.

and start X-Plane



If you want it to mount and the start x-plane at the same time then just add the follow to the end of the Mount Image file:

'####/X-Plane-i686'
or
'####/X-Plane-i386'


#### of course being the path to X-Plane executable.

or use any other application to mount the image, and forget about the script.
I just prefer doing it manually :)



Enjoy!
