Barbara Harper has been researching waterbirth for many years, and her quest has taken her all over the world. In Russia, it seems, she discovered the essence of waterbirthing. This video, the product of collaboration between a group of waterbirth advocates in Moscow and Harper's organization, is an accumulation of intense effort made over a ten year period.

Midwife Tatyana Sargunas and her filmmaker husband Alexei recorded five births, all of them natural and all under water. Footage includes women birthing in the Black Sea where the water is tepid and the women are very comfortable. As one mom commented, "The birth renewed my strength and empowered me." It is an extraordinary affirmation to watch the birthing women's confidence and tranquility and to remark first hand just how focused and relaxed the women are.
