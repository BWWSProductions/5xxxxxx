Gavin and Stacey - The complete Collection

This critically acclaimed BBC3 comedy written by James Corden and Ruth Jones follows the developing romance between a boy from Bilariki and a girl from Barry Island.

29 year old Gavin (Mathew Horne) is a nice, average guy who lives with his parents in Essex and is inseparable from childhood best friend Neil â€œSmithyâ€ Smith (James Corden). Stacey (Joanna Page) is a sweet, funny and pretty Welsh girl who has been engaged six times before. After months of talking on the phone at work, they finally arrange to meet in London, taking respective best friends Smithy and Nessa (Ruth Jones) along for moral support.

Despite their different locations and backgrounds, itâ€™s clear from the start that Gavin and Stacey are made for each other and once they decide to get married, two very different circles of family and friends must learn to get along with surprising and hilarious consequences.  

Gavin and Stacey are surrounded by a brilliant cast of likable, eccentric and very British characters including Bryn (Rob Brydon), Staceyâ€™s over protective uncle with a penchant for Sat Nav systems; Smithy, Gavinâ€™s possessive best friend with ambitions of drinking every beer in the world; and the immitigable â€˜Nessa, the tough, chain smoking original member of All Saints (who didnâ€™t get on with Shaznay) who has a back catalogue of colourful careers and famous ex-lovers.

Gavin and Stacey is warm, genuine and sweet comedy, with the occasional bit of filth, which has won fans on both sides of the Atlantic as well as a whopping 7 awards, including 4 British Comedy Awards and 2 BAFTAS.
