,PiraatBae,2011-11-07T22:01Z,By using the image of the DVD boxset and your copy/paste description you are fooling people into thinking these are DVD rips.  They are not.  They are TV rips complete with BBC logo and the quality is rather poor.
,PiraatBae,2011-11-08T10:38Z,"After reading my previous comment, I think I was a bit too harsh concerning quality.  It's fine for casual viewing, but a bit soft and pixelated when viewed full screen due to a rather low bit rate.

I still think your description should have made it clear they are TV rips from BBC3 and not DVD rips though.

Thanks for the up."
