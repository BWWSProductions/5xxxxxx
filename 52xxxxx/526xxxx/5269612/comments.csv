Cool for starting torrents with AFI but you aint got a few of them.
Firstly theres '
AFI'... their first self titled album and 
'Answer That and Stay Fashionable'.
Usually their 'All hallows E.P' is included in their discographies too.
Ill take the rest though :) 
Except Decemberunderground.
AFI died after Sing the Sorrow for me."
,y0ul053,2010-06-06T20:34Z,you forgot to mention the missing songs and how they're horribly sorted... can't even use the same file naming structure through 20 files
,SeberHusky,2010-12-23T16:30Z,"Where's the  ""The Days Of The Phoenix EP"" ?"
,morphiend,2011-01-07T03:27Z,Should be A.F.I. Collection. . . not sure you understand the dynamics of a discography. . . Good start tho. . . and yes. . . after Sing the Sorrow it was never the same. . . 
,pxndxcarlos,2011-08-09T17:16Z,isn't complete...where the song at ? The Days Of the Days...?
