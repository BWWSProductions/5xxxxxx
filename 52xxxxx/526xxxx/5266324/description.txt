This is a great version of this movie for those that want to view it with the English subtitles easy to read, and always on regardless of which DivX movie player software you use. We have used a nicely outlined large text size font
using avi-recomp, a great program for this purpose and completely free on the net ( we did give them a small donation to start anyways). It works with srt files that are in ssa format (we use subtitles editor for the purpose)

My movie review of Beau Pere appears at moviesbyrizzo.info

It is about a young woman in France, coming of age, in the company of a man
who has a different style of relating to her than what she might eventually want to settle for as she gains in wisdom and maturity and a fuller ability for real emotive engagement.

For those that want only French, (without subtitles) or want the subtitles
on only optionally, we do have a different version previously launched
and in addition we do have it at present as a completely free download
as an out-of-print at our movie reviews website.
