The relationships are a little complex. Ready? Rachel and Monica were high school classmates, while Ross and Chandler have been friends since college.

Chandler's dad is a drag queen, played by Kathleen Turner, and his mom is Morgan Fairchild. He also had a nubbin. Joey's an actor whose greatest roles have been as a doctor with an evil twin on "Days of Our Lives" and Al Pacino's butt. Phoebe sings bad folk music, works as a masseuse and actually has an evil twin. Oh and she was a surrogate for her brother's triplets. Finally, Rachel took forever to get a real job, did not have an affair with Ralph Lauren, fell in and out of love with Ross, and then had his baby.
