                    The Red Dahlia. Part 2.                  
                    Part two of a three-part crime drama. DC Anna  
                    Travis is reunited with DCI James Langton to  
                    investigate an ominous re-enactment of the  
                    infamous murder in 1940s Los Angeles dubbed the  
                    Black Dahlia. With the killer still at large  
                    and now goading the police, Langton comes under  
                    increasing pressure to crack this copycat case.  
                    But Travis's one night stand with a journalist  
                    threatens to derail the investigation and she  
                    is ordered to stay off the case.
