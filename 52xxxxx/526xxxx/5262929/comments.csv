thanks anyway fr the upload"
,ForkDoom,2010-01-06T19:07Z,"you wont get stuck, unless the internet goes into a spasm. I'v installed it myself and it works (winXP x64 without patch). 

I just hate .rar files. Good luck! My upload sucks, please seed whoever commented."
,My_Ex_Stacy,2010-01-06T19:35Z,"I have windows 7 x82. well according to the dwonloadtool i use it could get stuck cuz i'm not conected to seeders who have the complete files. anyway i will seed.

thnx"
,My_Ex_Stacy,2010-01-07T08:43Z,15 hours down... 17 to go... damn seed plz? =(
,ForkDoom,2010-01-07T12:49Z,"I am seeding stacy, my upload as I said is bad. I hope you will seed it when you have it downloaded as well. 

Be patient please! :)"
,ForkDoom,2010-01-07T14:22Z,"Also only 4 of the leechers show here, actually there is about 54 of them at the moment. I hope some download the last parts of the files, some the middle and some the first, that way we can all finish alot faster.. That perhaps is wishfull thinking. "
,My_Ex_Stacy,2010-01-07T19:10Z,I will seed as promised... only I'm already downloading 25 hours and still have to go 20 more hours =s... I don't believe the part of that many seeders sorry =)
,My_Ex_Stacy,2010-01-08T01:37Z,"ok it's in and I put my status on to super-seeder. I will seed during the whole instalationprocess, wich btw seems to be running fine. Up till now, it's a good download people, I will confirm it after I ran the game for the first time!"
,My_Ex_Stacy,2010-01-08T02:16Z,"installed and works like a charm. thanks ForkDoom. 

good download people"
,ForkDoom,2010-01-08T07:17Z,"the credit goes not to me. I didnt rip it or anything, I just unrared a good one and re-seeded as something usefull."
,My_Ex_Stacy,2010-01-08T15:34Z,"game is slowly on good quality video's.. sad. stupid comp xD.
