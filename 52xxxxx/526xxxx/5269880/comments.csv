,Brindleman,2010-02-09T21:06Z,"Thank you for this.  It sounds very interesting.  I've enjoyed John Stossel's ""style"" of reporting ever since he started on 20/20.  I'm glad to see that he's gotten his own show now."

John Kenneth Galbraith:

    â€œThe modern conservative is engaged in one of manâ€™s oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness.â€

Stossel and his ""facts"". Brought to you by Fox News....The only 'news' organization to ever go to court to fight for their right to lie:

Doesn't play in the great white north...Canada's Radio Act which requires that â€œa licenser may not broadcast ... any false or misleading news.â€ On March 1, Canadian regulators rejected the Canadian prime ministers effort's to allow Fox News to broadcast in Canada."
,bmadison,2011-04-13T07:49Z,"oh yes, redactedwv, another liberal fool who purports to know the motives of conservatives.

conservatism has nothing to do with moral justification of greed, in fact, greed can not be justified and is not moral.

Forced redistribution of wealth is not charity and it is not moral. charity comes from the heart and is given of ones own free will, and when charity and wealth are redistributed of ones free will, it is appreciated, rather than taken for granted without gratitude. Further more, a free people can better decide who is in need of charity and who is a leech, the government fails at this every time.

There is no superior morality, something is either moral or it is not.

Regarding your fox news going to court to lie, am I really supposed to believe ""Florida Appeals Court Orders Akre-Wilson Must Pay Trial Costs for $24.3 Billion""

24.3 billion? really? is this the most expensive trial costs in history?"
,PGHammer,2011-04-17T19:07Z,"Stossel is a libertarian, and always has been.  The one thing about Stossel (and now Fox teammate and also ABC News alumnus Geraldo Rivera) is that neither have changed what they have been, or their style of reportage, in changing networks.  Even if you don't agree with Stossel OR Rivera, if you use your brain at all, both do make you think - which is what good journalism (regardless of medium) is supposed to do.  Stossel was snatched from ABC (at the joint behest of Fox News ME Roger Ailes and AME/ME of Fox Business Neil Cavuto) for the same reason Cavuto himself was recruited - to be himself.  I've watched Stossel's shows (both on Fox Business and on FNC) and he's still the same Stossel that ABC News had - a sellout he isn't. (A lot more than, unfortunately, can be said for longtime correspondent (first for NBC O&O WRC-TV, then NBC News, and now MSNBC) Andrea Mitchell; for shame!)"
