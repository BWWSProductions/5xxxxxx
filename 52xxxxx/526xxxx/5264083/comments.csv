,dbd540,2010-03-24T06:27Z,"Hey guys. I have a band and am trying to look for something to record our music with. Im not the best with downloading and then going through the whole process of installing it so i have a couple of questions for anyone that can answer them for me please: 1. can i use my SHURE SM58 MICROPHONE to record with (drums, vocals, guitar etc). 2. is this the product i should be looking at. and 3. are there anythings i should know or any tips you guys could give me because i need all the help i can get. Thanks."
,Marc48,2010-03-25T13:43Z,"Hey dbd540 try using cakewalk's Sonar 8 Producer or Cubase 5 or better, you can find them on here, they both work great. I have this in M-audio version but was looking for something better but this thing sucks and isn't worth the time of downloading. Sorry Murderousome but get your shit together man"
,NorthDaProducer,2010-05-19T01:05Z,"dbd540, Pro tools is the industry standard recording software. If you are planning on working with industry professionals, Pro Tools is the program you want to begin learning. That being said, Cubase is an excellent program for recording physical instruments. Your microphone should work with both of these programs though."

,laurks,2010-08-30T20:30Z,"Can at least 1 or 2 people seed!  Just until it's finished, then I'll leave it up so you don't have to."
,Doggaz,2010-11-23T15:44Z,"@alfie-43 

I'm guessing this isn't the m-powered version need to run with the M-Audio Delta 1010LT. So If you don't have a digi device and are using M-Audio DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING YOU NEED M-POWERED VERSION."
