,sweetpea1821,2010-05-28T12:12Z,"This is great, thanks. Just to let others know, this is the real movie and it's in English. The quality is pretty good for how old the movie is. I give it a 10/10 for quality and the sound is a little quiet but its still good so I give the sound 8/10. Thank you so much for uploading this movie, I watched it a lot when i was a kid and haven't been able to find it on any movie streaming websites."

,yogiwankinobi,2011-09-26T14:08Z,A6\V5   Movie is not even full screen its in a small shitty box in the center of the screen. I wasted my time downloading. Now i need to find another copy and redownload! Thanks Uploader!
,yogiwankinobi,2011-09-27T17:42Z,To get around this irritating problem of the small box press C to crop the movie when using VLC Media Player. This is the only copy i can find on the net so thanks to uploader
