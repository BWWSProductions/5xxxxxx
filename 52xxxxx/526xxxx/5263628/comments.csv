[T],n2kmaster,2010-01-08T10:00Z,"I agree hence the reason why DJ N2K and N2KMaster went to torrent only. Music is meant to be heard not sold. Do you think our ancestors were banging on drums around going ooga booga, and one of them scratched his chin and went, yeah you know what i could get rich off that. And here's the kicker, CDs and DVDs are obsolete (BluRays in my book as well), its all gonna be digital eventually....I wonder if they'd reimburse all the people who got sued, charged, ripped off hardrives,computer,ipods,etc because of so called ""piracy"".  Would half the so called ""abuse sites"" and ""abuse reports"" that were filed before would be finally dropped and apologized for it, i mean we were funding them for long enough do you think they'd ever reimburse us for all the trouble THEY caused?

,Bibi86,2010-01-08T16:04Z,"Just went to the website, for Free you can hear all songs. For 3 euros you can download all their music, not just the new one but the 20+ songs ... 

You can say what you want about this band, they made really great happy pop/dance music, and really great hits, not just Cotton Eye Joe ...

+ They are independent, not on any big Label.

They are doing what we want all artists to do. 

I'll probably get the 3 euros sing. After having listenned to some old songs and the new one, it definitely worth it !"
,promoprint,2010-01-08T16:22Z,"Hey REDNEX, I don't really care to much for the music and have not yet downloaded it...but I sure did donate 1 Euro for the great idea.

Intent: 10. 
Integrity: 10. 
Stylistic/economic/promotional/marketing principles: 10. 
Stylistic/musical merit: 1. 

There are many areas in which you deserve to be applauded. Sadly, listenability isnt one of them. I think I would rather visit a proctologist (and dine upon a vat of jellied eels) then listen to this genre of music. It sort of sucks the life essence right out of you, whilst leaving a filmy fecal taste in your mouth. And I hate that taste! (lately)"

Everyone is missing the point!!

This is the greatest opportunity!!!

If this song goes viral and their popularity explodes, then other bands will follow!!

If this is very successful, then other bands could follow and this could bring down the whole RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) organized crime syndicate.

Bands only make about 5% profit from their record sales.  This band could do poorly in record sales and make a HUGE profit by not going through the RIAA tyranny.

If you don't like the music, don't bitch about it.  No one really gives a damn what you like or don't like.  These guys have taken an incredible step.  SUPPORT THEM!!  Financially or spread their music to those who may like it. "

,samolianpirate,2010-01-11T00:16Z,Like somebody else said ye should promote other bands here too...its a good idea...oh and don't charge them its not as if they are getting any money from sales!!
,serakt,2010-01-11T00:34Z,"As an actual member of the professional music community, I can say with absolute honesty that Rednex is awful.

Complete and total shit, your music would be the laughing stock of the industry if anyone had actually heard of your bullshit anti-establishment band.

PirateBay, I love you. Stop supporting these idiots and return to being a great torrent site (i.e. fix the search engine)."

,rhinohorn,2010-01-11T04:40Z,"I apologize if this suggestion has already been made, I did not read all 200 comments!

I found a way to DL the torrents, most of them at least:

1. Use a BT client that supports decentralized tracking, I use Azureus - make sure you have Distributed DB and Distributed Tracker plugins enabled.
2. Search Google by typing --  yoursearchterm:thepiratebay.org
3. Click on Magnet Link instead of DL This Torent

Good Luck, it's working for me!!"

that artical is old it was from Last Updated: Friday, April 17, 2009 | 5:45 AM ET, they have been working since and updated since, they probably have it shut down b/c they probably had another raid of there house and had things taken by police"

2. Search Google by typing -- yoursearchterm site:thepiratebay.org"

,gabriel1475,2010-01-11T04:55Z,"This is just dreaqful, come on Eileen, stop it! And shaddup both Krobon and jdubs, you are clearly both pole-smokers of the highest order. Get into a pit and settle it like the gentlemen of old...fisticuffs. And to you, Rednex, a golly good thing you are doing.

Intent: 10.
Integrity: 10.
Stylistic/economic/promotional/marketing principles: 10.
Stylistic/musical merit: 1.

There are many areas in which you deserve to be applauded. Sadly, listenability isnt one of them. I think I would rather visit a proctologist (and dine upon a vat of jellied eels) then listen to this genre of music. It sort of sucks the life essence right out of you, whilst leaving a filmy fecal taste in your mouth. And I hate that taste! (lately) "
,erikblazer,2010-01-11T05:38Z,"@ rhinohorn 

i tried to download but it doesnt allow me to add it to utorrent "
,rhinohorn,2010-01-11T06:05Z,"@erikblazer

Try going to Preferences > General and make sure ""Associate with Magnet URIs"" is checked.  Other than that, I don't know.  Try googling utorrent magnet URIs or magnet links.  I use Azureus and am getting great speeds, but none have finished yet.  I just hope they'll finish since TPB's tracker is down."
,jersson,2010-01-11T06:07Z,What the fuck is this. Cannot browse for any torrent at all. Fuck this bullshit

,easton29,2010-01-11T22:42Z,"I appreciate greatly the methods and the band itself. The music is just terrible, however. 

I remember friends having old records of yours and asking them the same thing I would today.. 

""what the hell is this bullshit you are listening to? It sounds like midi techno vs. country and its just about the worst thing ever"" 

Conceptually, its as logical as assuming that if you blend two foods together that you didn't like to begin with, that somehow, you'd end up with something you liked.

Not gonna happen. "
