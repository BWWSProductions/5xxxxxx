,enemy2k,2010-01-14T04:30Z,"New episode is about to come on. It is titled ""Apocalypse 2012"" where Jesse ""investigates rumors of secret bunkers built by the goverment to protect the nation's elite citizens during 2012's predicted disaster."""
,k3nd00d,2010-01-14T07:54Z,"Episode 7 will be out from me a little later than normal, as my recording screwed up so I am going to have to catch the second showing that comes on a couple hours later. Stay tuned. Of course, another version may come out before mine, but if the past has been any indication the other version will be a bunch of rar files (which is stupid) and may even be missing some of the show as 1 past release from the major group had a scene from the show missing."
