,doonboggle,2010-12-23T09:14Z,"In trying to expand the RAR file, it continually gives a fault notice, and error bell.  Have never had this before with other RAR files.  I notice there are several sub-folders.  Any what is happening?  Any suggestions on how to proceed?  At the moment, I am not continuing, due to impression that it is not properly expanding.  Thanks"
