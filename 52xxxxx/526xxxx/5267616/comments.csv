,Xelium,2010-01-22T12:42Z,Sorry guys- been seeding for a week. Need to drop some peers so others with faster connection can seed. Stay tuned - Most have 78% right now- I'll get a few up to 100 and then they can share.
,rolls7s,2010-01-25T23:40Z,Anyone having a problem with extract of file.  I used jzip and winzip and each reports a problem with the compression method.
,Kazehikaru,2010-03-21T17:50Z,"I just unzipped as many as it would let me (still about 25,000 pics). Be warned to anyone thinking of downloading this...there is NO even remnant of organization at all.  I may zip and upload after I'm done...if i ever get done."
,poolsert,2010-04-14T15:18Z,"Like other people have said this about 22,000 files in one dir with about 12 sub dirs with in them about 100 files.

No need to go zip this (manually?!)!

I have the perfect solution for this. I always use this to sort through sets of files jumbled together.

Get this program http://www.limagito.com/ and use it to sort the files according to set name.

You will end up with all the sets sorted in their own subdir!

Thanks for the upload!
