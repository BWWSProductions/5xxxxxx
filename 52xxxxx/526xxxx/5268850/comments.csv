,POVHUSTLA,2010-01-19T04:43Z,this patch key doesn't work 
,possemaste,2010-01-22T10:00Z,"Works fine by me, i am using this program for 5 weeks now.
At first you have to edit your HOST file in c:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC, so the program cannot check for the key on the server.

Then you install the program and the key.

If you do it the other way around, the program will cripple the key and you have to download a fresh one."

,kodi123,2010-06-14T15:45Z,"hi say me how to edit my host file 

kodijs@ymail.com this is my mail id mail me how to edit my host file"
,taskmasta,2010-06-28T04:49Z,"I got it to work. For those of you having trouble with the host file don't worry about it. All you have to do (AFTER you install but BEFORE you actually run the program) is Disable the program's connection to the internet with WINDOWS FIREWALL. For Windows 7 users just go to control panel, windows firewall then click ADVANCED. Click Outbound Rules

Once ur there add a New Rule. From there you can add the photokey program and disable it's internet access. When ur done with that, run the program and add the key and ur done.

Windows XP users can go to control panel then windows firewall and hit the Exceptions tab. From there click Add Program and find the photokey program in ur program files folder. After u add it make sure the box next to it is UNCHECKED. That way it won't be able to connect to the internet. Hope this helps."
,taskmasta,2010-06-28T04:57Z,"ALSO Possemaste you should have gave everyone the information that needs to be put into the host file. Just saying ""edit the host file"" isn't quite enough information."
,MadsSN,2010-06-29T22:37Z,the program key doesn`t work. dont waste your time to download this. 
,Hailey182s,2010-07-03T03:41Z,"Thanks for the upload!

It works perfectly if you follow the instructions by taskmasta.

No problems, thanks =D"
,CMDizzy,2010-07-27T19:20Z,"Could you please give instructions on editing the host file? I use both XP and 7 Ultimate. Taskmasta's instructions were understood but I still get closed out every time I open it telling me that the ""key is invalid"".

,mschori,2010-08-16T00:26Z,"Ok, it works..just follow instructions as per Taskmasta and then copy and paste program key into program file of fxhome in c>programfile>fxhome and when asked click download form file and browse to c>programfile>FXhome>programkey.

Hope this helps...btw..i'm running windows xp parallels on a Mac OSX Snow Leopard."

Just wondering if anyone have the Mac version..thanks a million in advance. Oh yes this works fine. "

in c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc the host file add 127.0.0.1   fxhome.com
        When asked for activation, check ""Select my downloaded key file""
                    and browse for PhotoKey3Pro.programKey


         Disallow internet connection for the program by your firewall"

,jj421,2011-08-26T11:35Z,"The key stopped working for me. So I somehow managed to pull the following serial out of my ass:

H1TLY-54FET-452UY-VH6YU-M4Z0T

That's a combination of PhotoKey 4 serials and just random key presses. :P"
,jj421,2011-08-26T11:36Z,Nevermind. That above serial doesn't work. Sorry.
