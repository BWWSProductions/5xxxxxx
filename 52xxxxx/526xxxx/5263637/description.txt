This is a wonderful collection of computational compositions full of glitched madness intertwined with harmoniously ordered disorder. A gorge of rich, melodious tones engulfs the listener as your mind floats away with the undulation of exquisite waveform variations. This highly enjoyable album is fifty three minutes of pure maddening experimental bliss. Shades of Distortion is Production Unit Xero's finest hour.
