Would prefer half-DVD5 size and some decent audio (FFS, 286kbps over 6 channels? do me a favor)... I reckon whoever has bandwidth for 1.55 can go to 2.18 for a major movie. But WTF, only my opinion... "
,Aarnaegg,2010-01-08T22:02Z,Could you also upload saw VI?

,joemlv,2010-01-09T00:13Z,WHAT HAPPENED TO WWW.KINGDOM-KVCD.NET ITS BEEN DOWN FOR A FEW DAYS NOW. SECRET_MYTH YOU KEEP INCLUDING THIS SITE IN THESE CURRENT TITLES BUT YOUR WEBSITE IS DOWN! AT LEAST GIVE US AN UPDATE AND LET US KNOW WHATS GOING ON????????
,spsthedestroyer,2010-01-09T01:29Z,"hey secret, since the absence of aXXo, you have provided me with alllllllll my movies. But I have a few issues.

1. I downloaded Monsters vs. Aliens (BR) and I actually got a letter in the mail from my internet provider saying I illegally downloaded it... I guess DreamWorks was eyeing me or something so check that or something lol.

2. downloaded your SAW box set and the last 2 didn't work. I'm guessing cause the bitrate was too high to play on my PS3. It was like at 1000 something. Probably should check that just incase...

3. Downloaded Milk (BR). looked like the Audio and Video weren't matching. Might just be mine. I'll double check it.

that should be it. You rock for sure though dude. There is no other person I'd download movies from. Very trust worthy so keep it up man...

I also recommend (in BR):
Afterdark Horrorfest 07-09 :)
Friday the 13th Box Set
Nightmare on Elm St. Box Set
Halloween Box Set
Across the Universe
Indiana Jones Box Set
Resident Evil Box Set....

I better stop cause I'm gonna list things like crazy... anyways, thanks A LOT"
,oldSMfan,2010-01-09T05:36Z,"STILL WAITING FOR the_devious's RIPS? ... ???

WELL???

:O)"
[V],McTav,2010-01-09T10:18Z,"@the_devious
you know for someone who still burns movies on to dvds you sure to alot of nit picking, get a media server cheap. and for someone saying how big a nonissue bandwidth is, why dont you go download a bigger rip. derp derp. SM does not claim his rips are the best quality or anything, but for the size they are extremely suitable for most people, so if you are not happy with the rip go else where.

@spsthedestroyer 
are you playing it from a media server wireless? If so that could explain the lag"
,Otaku1,2010-01-09T10:22Z,Thank you. Quality +1.

,gamerguy1,2010-01-09T17:43Z,"hey secret_myth can you do rip of the godfather trilogy: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4468721/The.Godfather.Trilogy.720p.BluRay.x264-HD ,I know it's there but your rips are always the best so please upload this.thanks!"
,fanel89,2010-01-09T18:43Z,So I guess I'm not the only one that realized the movie is out of sync. I thought there was something wrong on my end but all my other movies play fine. First time this is happening as well.

,Barebonexxx,2010-01-09T22:05Z,"As always, your releases are awesome! My only problem is that I have a WD TV player and a Sony Receiver. None of them are supporting AAC audio. I have to downsample it to stereo, well you see the picture. What about leave the audiotrack to original OR convert it to AC-3? Anyway, keep up the good work!"
,sudhank,2010-01-10T08:19Z,"hey thanx for all ur rips SM can you pls post the bluray rips for

,roi21,2010-01-11T11:24Z,the audio is out of sync how can I fix this? help pls
,roi21,2010-01-11T11:29Z,I played it in WMP with Klite Pack.. and for the first time in Secret_myth's rip this one out of sync.. but I played it in Itunes and it works fine :)
,harlequinnh,2010-01-11T14:54Z,"Thanks!

Anyone else getting corrupt picture at 21:23 (using windows 7, vlc 1.03)?

It's consistently there."
,fanel89,2010-01-11T19:13Z,"It's weird. The video is out of sync in Media Player Classic (with Combined Community Codec Pack), while all other secret_myth rips play fun.

I played the file in Windows Media Player 12 and it plays fine, no out of sync. Either way, I downloaded another version of Zombieland that plays fine regardless"
,Unbobbed,2010-01-12T02:27Z,"@ people having audio out of sync issues

It seems to have something to do with klcodec pack, and the way secretmyth encodes his/her recent videos (starting from whip it) because I went to http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/ and installed ONLY MPC (without codec) and the audio was in sync. So for people that are having problems, try uninstalling klcodec and install ONLY MPC."
,IloveHD,2010-01-14T05:08Z,"Hey secret,
I really love the quality of your stuff, but I have one question: why did you change the profile of your videos from ""Main @L4.1 to High @L4.1""?
this is making them unable to play on Apple TV. how can I change that (I have a mac) and why did you start uploading them differently?"
,adp28,2010-01-14T05:50Z,Thanks for the movie!
,jehoke39,2010-01-16T14:51Z,"Thnx Secret, your the best!"

would it be possible to re-encode and re-upload this movie?

,Treezluv2draw,2010-01-20T03:24Z,"Dependable as always, and I'm appreciative as always.  Thanks for taking the time to upload and I look forward to Ninja Assassins, I know you will get that to the people as well.  There is only one thing, this is not compatible with the Xbox 360, but it does work for the PS3 which is not at all a big deal."
,ultaman1,2010-01-21T21:32Z,"Thanks, but one part in the movie it gets pixelized on my ps3.

By the way, could u upload FinalFantasy movies?.. SpiritsWithin and AdventChildren complete, will be appreciated :)"
,DJPixcell,2010-01-27T12:54Z,"I don't know the differences you have been doing to affect the video quality more recently, but its looking real good! The picture is perfect, before it was great for the size, now its perfect and the size of the file? Tiny!

Thanks for sharing! Good upload, took a while to download though, will seed."
,wrick3000,2010-01-30T12:04Z,There is an error of video getting distorted in the 21st minute lasting 3 seconds. Is it me or anyone else facing it?
,Mokoko34,2010-02-02T00:54Z,"I would KILL to find out what programs/settings you use to get such a relatively small file in HD!  It's a shame that aXXo seems to have dropped from the scene but not I always look forward to SecretMyth releases, especially when it comes to HD! "
,kellman,2010-02-03T20:19Z,"It tells me when I burn to dvd that the audio format might not be compatible in all NTSC players and then when I put it into my PS3, video looks absolutely amazing but audio doesnt work! Whats going onnnnnnnnnn :(!"

,maurdr,2010-02-08T06:08Z,this was a great download only took about an hour to download and i never ran into any sound or video errors.
,herniator,2010-02-16T08:49Z,"Thanks secret_myth! Thank god the encoder decided to switch to high profile H.264.  If AppleTV can't play it, too bad, it makes the quality MUCH better for everyone else.  Apple is pure shit anyways.  If you can afford to waste money on overpriced Apple garbage, then you can afford to buy this movie on iTunes.  For the file size there is no better upload than this."
,Treezluv2draw,2010-02-24T01:46Z,"As always impressive thank you for the great upload, do you have SinCity floating around anywhere?"
