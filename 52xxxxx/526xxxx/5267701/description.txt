Jack Orion is the third album by Scottish folk musician Bert Jansch, released in 1966. It contains a number of traditional songs, including the epic Jack Orion: a ten-minute adaptation of the Child ballad Glasgerion which tells of a court fiddlerâ€™s attempt to seduce a countess and his servant's treachery in successfully impersonating him. A number of songs are performed with friend and fellow guitarist John Renbourn, who would later join him in the group Pentangle. The Waggonerâ€™s Lad has Jansch unusually playing the banjo with Renbourn supplying the guitar part.
