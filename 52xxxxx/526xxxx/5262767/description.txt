Although most of the attention Kenny Chesney garnered in 2005 was for his brief marriage to actress Renee Zellweger, he also managed to release two studio albums during that year--the laid-back, island-hopping BE AS YOU ARE and THE ROAD AND ... Full DescriptionTHE RADIO, a more straightforward country outing. The latter record revisits his earlier style, spending more time on dusty gravel roads than palm-tree-lined beaches. On "Living in Fast Forward," Chesney ponders his busy life dubbing himself a "hillbilly rock star out of control" amidst ZZ Top-like guitar riffs. The amiable singer also offers up the emotional ballad "You Save Me" and two odes to south-of-the-border drinking--the upbeat "Beer in Mexico" and the melancholy "Tequila Loves Me"--making this a release that's sure to appeal to fans of all phases of Chesney's career.
