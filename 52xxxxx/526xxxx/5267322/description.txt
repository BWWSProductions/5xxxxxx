Herbert Jansch (born 3 November 1943[1]), known as Bert Jansch, is a Scottish folk musician and founding member of the band Pentangle. He was born in Glasgow and, in the 1960s, he was heavily influenced by the guitarist Davey Graham and folk singers such as Anne Briggs. He is best known as an innovative and accomplished acoustic guitarist but is also a singer and songwriter.

He has recorded at least 25 albums and has toured extensively starting in the 1960s and continuing into the 21st century. His work has influenced such artists as Johnny Marr, Bernard Butler, Jimmy Page, Ian Anderson, Nick Drake, Donovan, Neil Young, and more recently Don Deere, and it has earned him a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2001 BBC Folk Awards.

Jansch's music, and particularly his acoustic guitar playing, have influenced a range of well-known musicians.

Jimmy Page not only recorded a version of Jansch's "Blackwaterside" but cites him as an influence. He is quoted as saying "At one point, I was absolutely obsessed with Bert Jansch. When I first heard that LP [1965], I couldn't believe it. It was so far ahead of what everyone else was doing. No one in America could touch that."[34] 
Neil Young is quoted as saying, "As much of a great guitar player as Jimi [Hendrix] was, Bert Jansch is the same thing for acoustic guitar...and my favourite."[35] 
Mike Oldfield practised acoustic guitar alone as a child, and was then heavily influenced by Jansch's style. "Angie" (Jansch's version of the Graham tune) was his favourite, and would drive Oldfield to call his first band (with sister Sally) "The Sallyangie".[36] 
Bernard Butler states that Noel Gallagher, Jarvis Cocker, and Johnny Marr (as well as himself) have "paid homage to this quiet, unassuming, but hugely revered master".[37] 
Nick Drake was an admirer of Jansch, and covers of "Courting Blues" and "Strolling down the Highway" were included on the bootleg "Tanworth-in-Arden". 
Donovan wrote two songs dedicated to Jansch; "Bert's Blues" appeared on his "Sunshine Superman" LP, and "House of Jansch" on his fourth album "Mellow Yellow". 
Gordon Giltrap's album "Janschology" (2000) has two tunes by Jansch, plus two others that show his influence. 
Tsuneo Imahori is known to have been heavily influenced by Jansch. 

Bert Jansch is the debut album by Scottish folk musician Bert Jansch. The album was recorded on a reel-to-reel tape recorder at engineer Bill Leader's house and sold to Transatlantic Records for Â£100. Transatlantic released the album, which went on to sell 150,000 copies. It is also mentioned in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The record includes Jansch's best known tune "Needle of Death," which was inspired by the death of a folk singer friend of his, Buck Polly. [1]
