,anonymiss,2010-01-09T08:13Z,"did anyone hear what I heard on 01-07?
lots of coughing, sniffling, a certain gurgling noise, a *loud* gurgling noise, bob kelley apologizing to ant, and ant saying ""Shhh!"". 

I dont care at all, and I'm not gonna say what it sounds like bc I dont wanna be ""that guy"", but if you listen to the whole break around 1h15min, it sounds fishy."
