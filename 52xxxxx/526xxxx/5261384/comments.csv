,murrdogg,2010-01-06T18:23Z,"ok, here's the deal. This is a real copy that I rawdumped, it works for me. But I had to fiqure out why I was having problems with it quiting on me after 10 mins of play. If you are having problems getting it to work, you must visit www.wiihacks.com and sign up with them, then search super mario bros. Read what other people are doing to solve their issues with this game, because this game is giving lots of people issues. 

Also, you do not have to put an actuall mod chip in your Wii to play burnt games, once again, visit www.wiihacks.com and start reading, good luck and please seed."
,carcake,2010-01-07T00:23Z,If you have Wiikey 1.9s will this work via Disc Channel?
,carcake,2010-01-07T00:24Z,If you have Wiikey 1.9s will this work via Disc Channel without the 10min error thans sorry if I posted this twice anyway please respond thanks
,murrdogg,2010-01-07T07:26Z,"im not sure about the 1.9 version if it doesn't see if they put out an update for it, I honestly doubt it will because they put the update out for the wii key 2 just for the New Super Mario Bros. game"
,murrdogg,2010-01-07T07:28Z,"Another Update. This is the original iso and is not scrubbed at all so more than likely will not work for softmod wiis, unless you do the following to the iso file.

Patching/Fixing the ISO:

1) Download WiiScrubber 1.40 from http://filetrip.net/f4399-Wiiscrubber-Kit-with-multiloader-1-40.html the download comes with multiple rar files that you will need to unrar each one. Put all of the files in one folder to keep this simple.

2) Run the ""MakeKeyBin.exe"" Type in the number and hit generate, done.

3) Open WiiScrubber, and select your ISO, the one you are downloading here.

4) Search for the main.dol -> right click -> Extract //// you want to look for the main.dol under the New Super Mario Partition, not the one that says sample partition. Make sure you know where you extracted the file to.

5) Download NSMB Wii PPF Patches.rar and NSMB Wii PPF-O-Matic.rar one is the patches for this NTSC version and the Pal version if that is what we had but it isn't, the other is the program that is going to patch the main.dol file we extracted with the patched one.

6) Open PPF-Patcher, and on the top box you want to select the main.dol file you extracted, you will have to select all files before you will be able to view it in your browse category box. The bottom box you want to select the NTSC patch that you just downloaded and then hit apply. Once you are done it has patched the file that you extracted in the beginning. 

Now go back to the wii scrubber and instead of hitting the extract hit the replace button when you right click on the main.dol file. 

After you replace the file with the patched one hit the scrub button and when it is done you will have the version that will most likely work for your wii. Good luck and hope this helps.


I took these instructions from this link http://www.wiihacks.com/wii-games/28589-guide-new-super-mario-bros.html they are right at the top with links to all the downloads.		"
,mncs360,2010-01-07T11:44Z,y the foook do we always have to use a wii scrubber or other programs to play it.can no one in the world upload a normal copy so we can put it straight to disc
,murrdogg,2010-01-07T19:41Z,"wow, look bro, i just spent the past two days trying to figure this shit out and posted everything I found out here in simple english. This is a real copy that has been rawdumped from the game directly and even if you just burnt this one you still have to download the wii key 2 update and burn that to a disc and put it in your wii and run it, you piece of crap. Things are not always simple in life did your mommy breast feed you too long ass hole."
,carcake,2010-01-08T04:26Z,murrdoog im kinda of new to NSMB not working problem so Im kinda confused I have a wii with 4.2U and Wiikey 1.9S will it work or do I have to purchase a new modchip like wiikey2.  Please respond If you don't mind. Thanks
,murrdogg,2010-01-08T21:08Z,"i would try to just burn the game and play it to start off, if it lets you play it and then kicks you off after 10 mins or so then look for a wiikey update for your style of wiikey. If there isn't any then go to this link

http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/24630-full-hacking-guide-4-2-system-menus.html 

This is a guide to show people who have 4.2u on their wii and shows you how to play burnt games with it, but even if you do this you will have to scrub the game. I just did this to a friends wii 2 days ago and it worked perfectly, so good luck."
,carcake,2010-01-08T23:35Z,Thanks murrdog i am right now downloading it thanks for your help I will ask you if their is any problems thanks
,carcake,2010-01-10T18:03Z,Murrdogg I need some help the game will load up play for 10min then crash what do I need to do please help thanks
,murrdogg,2010-01-10T22:00Z,"have you tried the firmware update for your wiikey

http://www.wiikey.cn/en/legacy/"
,carcake,2010-01-11T23:38Z,I have Wiikey1 its been updated to 1.9s can you please help me thanks
,murrdogg,2010-01-12T06:20Z,"if there is no further update for your wii key you only other option it to scrub the game or download one that says patched NTSC. Use a launcer like NeoGamma to launch the game, really you should just read the forums at www.wiihacks.com Search all your questions there, because any question you have that forum has the answer to. Good Luck"
,carcake,2010-01-14T01:41Z,Thanks murrdog I guess I will have to soft-mod my wii thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,MrSan.,2012-06-05T20:03Z,"I have downloaded this game from the following torrent file and the disc did not worked on my 4.0U Wii, so I suppose that the files of this torrent will not work too:
