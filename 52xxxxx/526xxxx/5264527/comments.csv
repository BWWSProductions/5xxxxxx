,ihan,2010-01-25T00:58Z,"Took me ages to find suprisingly (1080p, english, Complete version)

I wanna watch it on my new ps3 and hdtv :)

However, the speed is very poor, i am uploading without limit, and even in this case, my download is only going between 8-60 kb/s .
can everyone seed this please .  Thank you.

p.s. if i convert the mkv using mkv2vob , will the resulting audio be in english or japanese?
THank you"

,elektronik_supersonik,2010-10-23T05:21Z,"Good stuff! BTW, does anyone know which software is currently the best for MKV->BD5 conversion? TsMuxer or MKV2Vob or MultiAVCHD...?"
,iamabigtorrentfan,2010-11-29T15:22Z,"Awesome upload. I have a question though. If I convert this to some other type like mpeg for PSP/iPod or avi, how could I choose between the two dubs? I want the English one. I'm using AVS4YOU 6"
,swamiolsson,2011-02-11T10:01Z,"Thanx, Mate. 
You're doing a fabulous job, for the benefit of the rest of us, who're too lazy to do all this work ourselves."
,ap0logy_03,2011-03-01T10:11Z,wow!! 7gb? for a movie? how long is this movie?? 6hrs?
,xact44,2011-03-01T23:34Z,"apology it's an HD rip, as in a blu-ray. So it's big, really big. And I'm not sure what the deal is but the speed on this particular torrent is horrific. I'm sure it's something on my end but i have no idea what it could be, this is the only torrent giving me hell. I can see peers with higher speeds : / oooh well, will rate when it gets done... in like a week lol"
,Jaywalker987,2011-03-14T21:44Z,Can anyone please tell me how to switch to English audio?

,Ciahast,2012-01-09T18:44Z,"Amazing quality, thanks!"
,teos9888,2012-01-29T04:58Z,"Thanks a lot. Just to let you know, it's the extended version (director's cut), 206 minutes long. Enjoy!"
,crimsonkinge,2012-03-04T17:06Z,"keeps freezing at 1:40:36
why are so many zip files? which one do i extract?"
,Whyttedragun,2012-03-31T06:18Z,"They aren't ZIPs. they're RARs.  You use 7zip or winRAR, starting on the first one, and it will automatically go to the next and on through them all.
@hey55zeus:  If you're using Norton or McAfee, you fail.  If you're using something else, and it's flagging a virus on that file, it's something that was added in on your end, because I'm not getting a detection on either of my machines that I've used it on."
,RedXyoline,2012-04-12T13:34Z,"to put it on english dubbed first:
u need VLC media player,
then u right click the screen when the movie is running go to audio, then audio track and press english"
