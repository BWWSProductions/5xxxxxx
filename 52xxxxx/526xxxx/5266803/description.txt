This is the complete 7th season of Star Trek: DS9. I downloaded these all offand they were all uploaded by Kanoushdie, so credit should go to him.
This is the only 7th season I could find that I could get to work on my PS3, so if that's what you're looking for then great.

All of these files are in English.

All of these files are dvd quality with a resolution of 576x432(also note it upscaled really well to 1080p as long as it was kept in 4:3 ratio)

All these files are about 345mb with FFDS video compression. And also include the intro and ending credits.



On a final note, this is my first torrent. Just thought I'd share with you guys if you were also having trouble getting it to work over your 360/ps3.

I'll be seeding this for the next 3 months from 12-1am PST with about 200-300 kbps upload depending on network constraints.
