,Fuzzy_Bunny,2010-02-06T11:16Z,"I would just like to thank all of the others who have seeded with me. Thanks for helping give this torrent to others, I commend you. To all the others out there, please at least seed what you took. And please at least comment on the torrent to let others know what they can expect. I am currently at a 10.634 ratio and I don't expect anyone else to be at that but please, keep PirateBay alive and seed. Shit like this is killing torrents across the board."
