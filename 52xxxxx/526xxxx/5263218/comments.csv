,Borg_One_of_Five,2010-01-07T16:04Z,"Seriously, this one is a GOOD torrent, I'd say a9/v9 - and the subs are in English, hard written in.  SEED someone.  There are leechers, no seeders and it's coming in at 5k or nothing!  This IS a good one.  "
,Borg_One_of_Five,2010-01-07T16:30Z,"You are full of shit.  IT IS NOT FAKE, I can freaking SEE part of it even tho I'm at 90%.  "
,Novauk,2010-01-07T16:45Z,"Its not fake it does have the subs etc , its just really poorly being seeded lol
"
,maglarnet,2010-01-07T20:06Z,"Not fake, worth watching if you cant wait for dvdrip."
,pimmelfick,2010-01-08T06:34Z,"Thanks. Saved me some money. I'm glad I didn't spend it to see this pile of bullshit in cinema. Avatar is the most expensive garbage movie I've ever seen. If it would be any good, I'd go and see it in the theatre. But it's only horseshit wrapped in golden paper."
,uploader1970,2010-01-09T01:38Z,all you idiots that have nothing better todo then bitch about all the downloads should just EAT SHIT AND LIVE!!!!
,williambro,2010-01-11T18:09Z,"Hey pimmelfick
 Just remember one thing, Avatar is the second biggest money maker of all time, it is just behind Titanic."
,coolkylling,2010-01-11T23:19Z,What codec do you need to play this?
,serpentine5,2010-01-12T23:45Z,Didnt Cameron do Titanic too? two of the biggest... or three? Isnt T2 the 3rd...?
,mogjog,2010-01-13T02:13Z,"Can someone upload images? also, A/V rating? and SEED SEED
seeding is good for the soul"
,williambro,2010-01-13T08:46Z,"A=8
V=8
ALSO ENGLISH SUBS WHERE NEEDED"
,GROWCH,2010-01-25T14:03Z,i hope the English subs for the Na'vi are correct
,trax100,2010-02-03T21:29Z,"These guys work really hard 2 release these versions ...... V shud be thankful...dvdrip isn't cmn anytime soon.
Regarding the movie, I personally din't enjoy it much as well. It's storyline seemed the same as The Last Samurai. People in the theatres were actually sleeping when i watched it. "
