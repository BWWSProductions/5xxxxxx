I used XLD top rip it in CD-paranoia modus with accurate-rip and C2-error pointers. The CD's were like a maiden, so no errors occured and this is a perfect rip. De .log from accurate-rip is included.
I first ripped in Apple Lossless, and after I imported that to LAME MP3 256 VBR, so for who doesn't understand: VERY GOOD QUALITY.

You also have to know all is perfectly tagged.


SO THIS TORRENT INCLUDES:

 - a scan of the violin scores
 - a scan of the piano accompainment score
 - the music (2 CD's, described above) of each track in - Apple Lossless
                                                        - LAME MP3 256 VBR
 - the accurate-rip .log
 - a .pfd with the tracklisting

These are very good and very beautiful studies. The piano accompainment is also very good! It makes them very good to play on concerts or concours.

You an always mail me for tips or fingerings or something.

Njoy!!
