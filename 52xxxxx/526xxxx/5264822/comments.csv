,Upquark2,2010-01-07T16:09Z,"No, I've indeed got it from Usenet. If you really want it, I guess I can make a torrent for it. :)"
,diyadokeon,2010-01-07T17:34Z,"I just think that the resulting bitrate is a little too low for 720p (I'd prefer 3 episodes per DVD and anamorphic 960x720 if I were to encode such recordings). So, if it's not a problem, yes, I'd like to get the original. It's probably not going to be too popular but I think there will be others who appreciate it."

,manwepr,2010-01-08T17:56Z,"Not sure if the original has it too, but this version has a lot of compression artifacts."
,Upquark2,2010-01-08T18:51Z,Sorry about that. Could you give some time marks with examples?
,manwepr,2010-01-08T19:34Z,Between 10:30 and 10:45 there are some examples. Just downloaded the original one and it's just fine.
,Upquark2,2010-01-09T01:19Z,"?
It's probably me, but I don't see any (using KMPlayer 1.5.1)."
,diyadokeon,2010-01-09T08:17Z,"Haven't seen it, but I know that some severe artifacts can appear on H.264 videos if deblocking is forced off in the decoder. Using ""disable when safe"" option or enabling deblocking (depending on the decoder) might solve the problem."
