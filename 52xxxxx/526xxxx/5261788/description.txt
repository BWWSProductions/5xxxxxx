It was later edited to 162-minute television movie. It was released in home video and was made available in the Philippines in Laser Disc format. The movie, â€œA Dangerous Life,â€ directed by Robert Markowitz, starred a miscast Gary Busey in the role of an American journalist, Tony Oâ€™Neil, covering the last years of the Marcos regime. It starts in August 21, 1983 when Senator Benigno Aquino was assassinated and ends in February 25, 1986 when the Marcoses fled the country and installed Corazon Aquino to power.
