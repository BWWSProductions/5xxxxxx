Album information

All the Wayâ€¦ A Decade of Song is a compilation of Dion's most successful hits coupled with seven new songs, including the leadoff single "That's the Way It Is", written and produced by a team who worked with Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync at that time. CÃ©line Dion performed it live with 'N Sync, during her CBS TV special, presented in late November 1999 to mark the release of the album. The TV special included also guest appearance by Gloria Estefan.

CÃ©line Dion also worked with Robert John "Mutt" Lange, best known for his multi-platinum recordings with Shania Twain. They recorded "If Walls Could Talk", with Twain on background vocals. The song was originally performed by Stevie Vann.

Among new songs recorded for this compilation, there are two other covers: Roberta Flack's "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" and Frank Sinatra's "All the Way" (recorded as a duet with Sinatra's vocals). The latter was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.

"Then You Look at Me" was written by James Horner and Will Jennings ("My Heart Will Go On") and featured in the 1999 movie Bicentennial Man, starring Robin Williams.

"I Want You to Need Me" became the last Diane Warren's song recorded by Dion. Two more tracks written by Warren and produced by David Foster were recorded during the All the Way... a Decade of Song sessions, but they never made the album. One of them, called "Would I Know" leaked into the internet in May 2005 (Charlotte Church recorded her version in 2003), but the second, "Run Like a River" still remains unreleased.

The last track on the album is an English version of the song "Vivre" from the Notre Dame de Paris musical and it's called "Live (for the One I Love)".
