Two brothers and gamers for life choppin' it up about video games and gamer culture.  A non-platform specific podcast, just pure gamer passion.  Hosted by Kevin and Ryan Ballerstein.

2010 is here and we need to talk about games.  Dragon Age Awakening DLC, love/hate with Bioware, Treyarch's next Call of Duty...Vietnam, Infinity Ward's mmo, Alan Wake episodic content, and some Darksiders love.
