,lilome,2011-07-14T02:21Z,"NONE OF THESE WORK! YOU CAN'T RECOVER THE PASSWORD WITH THIS ""TRIAL VERSION "" THATS LISTED HERE.
ALSO THE OTHER ONE IS A WEB PAGE WANTING YOU TO PURCHASE THEIR CRAP & THERE IS NO GUARANTEE ITS NOT MORE JUNK WITH SPYWARE /ADDWARE & TROJANS. 
SEEING IT IS BEING INTRODUCED BY SOMEONE NOT BEING HONEST HERE.
 DONT TRUST IT.
The  only real fix without purchacing some unsure software is to create a new password from the hidden administrator account accessed through safemode.
Reboot/hold f8/ chose safe mode or safe mode with networking /wait a miniute /chose administrator(top) / let windows load / ACKNOWLEDGE  THE LOAD AT WINDOW WITH YES/go into control panel / user accounts. create new password on name(s) with administrator privlages.  goodluck"
