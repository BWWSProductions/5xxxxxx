"Somebody to Love" is a song performed by pop singer Leighton Meester featuring Robin Thicke. It is the lead single from her debut album and was produced by Mike Caren and written by Leighton Meester, Robin Thicke, Mike Caren, Ollie Goldstein, Rico Love and Shahine Ezell. The song was featured in an episode of Gossip Girl, which stars Leighton Meester.

"Somebody to Love" is an uptempo electropop and trance song that harks elements of Blue Monday by New Order. It draws influences of pop music, electronica and R&B with Robin Thicke's vocals. Meester said in an interview that "the song is basically about how I can't get any â€” I can't find anyone to love." "I really wanted to make something that's completely different from anything that's on the radio right now," said Leighton. "I feel like it's really dancy and fun, but it's still laid back and relaxed and moody and sexy." Of the single, songwriter Love stated to MTV that "I was honored when I found out that my record was chosen to be Leighton's first single. It's exciting to be able to show a different side of my work and me."

The music video was directed by Zoe Cassavetes and was released online on 8th November 2009 to Last.FM
