,kelvinpicton,2010-01-08T17:18Z,Is this the full 1 hr 51 min film?
,Dublin.Dude,2010-01-08T17:35Z,Yo yo is this the full version? 
,honeyvera,2010-01-08T17:37Z,Don't think so this is only 1 hr 27 min
,onmitt,2010-01-08T17:38Z,"20 min missing
Same broken file recoded"
,willdenow,2010-01-08T17:45Z,Thanks for nothing.  Why are people continuing to post lame copies?  It's a waste of their bandwidth and our time.
,golfpro,2010-01-08T18:07Z,Full version out tomorrow (apparently)
,mrhinter,2010-01-08T18:41Z,"from my understanding, the original rip was buggered up by the TOXIC group.... they have been informed of this error, and are amending it as we speak. hell, props to them for getting something out so damn quick, i didnt expect to see this movie till next month or later!

but im quiet willing to sift thru the busted ones for a day or two, who in their right mind would complain about uploaders doing their best for us? great work tvteam, i didnt know you guys till i left mininova and came to tpb, but i am VERY glad i did, always right on the mark with your uploads, fastest releaser ive seen away from the direct download scene!"
,mcfly666,2010-01-08T19:15Z,"So this one has the stupid TOXIC watermark in it? and some1 else goes and does a recode... 

LOL

And I think theres a bit more too it than the group ""buggering it up"" ;)"

,mrhinter,2010-01-08T19:52Z,"As I stated previously mcfly, who in hells hot boots would complain about someone arranging FREE copies of UNRELEASED movies, regardless of quality. If you arent happy with the torrent, move along and look for something better. Don't become one of those people who runs around bagging the hard work put in by others, unless of course you can deliver a better copy of the road yourself..... "
,RIggsta,2010-01-08T20:24Z,^dude shut the fuck up
,Chaosxx,2010-01-08T21:21Z,"I can understand about complaining, sure its free, but its a movie, whats the point in watching a movie if the ending or any other part of its missing, and its annoying how it gets reuploaded again and again lol, how many copies of this version are out now? ÂŹ.ÂŹ"
,mrhinter,2010-01-08T21:22Z,wow.... theres a reply ill remember and keep for future reference when I am trying to be witty and look cool..... go you!
,LH-oswald,2010-01-08T22:15Z,"all these guys are right,why upload an incomplete film,you wouldnt get a music uploader putting up 75% of an album would you or half a tv show,9 copys of this are up just now,at least 7 must have knew the movie was incomplete,absolute waste of time   "
,chedderz66,2010-01-08T22:48Z,"stop uploading this incomplete version already! fuck!!!...I dont blame the original uploader for posting an incomplete version by mistake, shit happens, but the rest of you re-uploading this have no excuse...I and others in our ""right mind"" should complain and are..."
,Uncrustable,2010-01-08T23:12Z,"People that complain should die! If you don't like it, go fuk a chicken!"
,polyonymous,2010-01-08T23:12Z,"riggs+1
hinter shut the fuck up"
,blaze22,2010-01-08T23:26Z,"Uncrustable.
Your dad was a dumb ass for impregnating that whore of mother that brought you screaming into this world. You fucking product of a leaking condom. 
I'm not complaining, I'm simply not going to download this because it is incomplete as has been confirmed by multiple people. I don't really give a shit because I can wait, what I do give a shit about is idiotic morons who rip movies for a ""living"" spend their entire lives in front of a grease sodden dirty pc with jizz stains all over the keyboard peeing in pop cans and shitting in buckets because they're too lazy to go to the toilet. Morons like you who reupload broken content submitted by others for ""kudos"" on the ""interwebs"". Sad little bastards the lot of you."

,themotherfucker,2010-01-09T00:11Z,"Its true that people shouldnt upload this incomplete shit, it cant be help when it has been snatch from sombody else then re-up again.....

[T],artpepper,2010-01-09T03:15Z,"@themotherfucker:

As amusing as it is to read rants from a half-wit who can't even spell 'fuck' correctly, try to grasp this simple point:

For some of us, bandwidth is an issue. We really can't afford to waste it downloading crap. 

And that's what this is--crap. 

Have you ever seen an Axxo release with a fucking 'Axxo' watermark on the film? No. 

Have you ever seen an Axxo release that was missing 24 minutes? No.

Everyone appreciate the work of people who upload good stuff and who care enough to ensure that their uploads are good.

People who upload this kind of shit are showing their contempt for the rest of us.

That's what this is about, you illiterate mouth-breathing cretin.

(cute name, by the way, and doubtless factually accurate)"
,bigturd,2010-01-09T03:40Z,Don't download. Missing 20-24 minutes of the film.
,trampus67,2010-01-09T05:24Z,fish sandwiches
,Bum_Fluff,2010-01-09T11:43Z,mmm... fish
,jiveclive,2010-01-09T12:10Z,"Why are all whining about missing 20 mins. A lot of movies improve if you nick 20 mins off. Plus you can get to seeing your next movie 20 mins sooner. In every silver lining, there is a cloud. In every bowl there should be some Moroccan and a light handy. Here's to a more perfect world!"
,doser69,2010-01-09T13:21Z,"NUKED

BAD VERSION

DO NOT DOWNLOAD

NOT DVDSCR"
,doser69,2010-01-09T13:22Z,"Everyone is calling to ban this group from the scene forever........

Don't waste your time, it's just some retard copying the TOXIC release and removing the watermark...

This planet has some fuckin idiots..."
,bigturd,2010-01-09T17:17Z,You can't even trust the colored skulls on this site to upload quality releases anymore. 
,Uncrustable,2010-01-09T18:38Z,"blaze22

,gayflash,2010-01-09T21:25Z,"Probably the most overestimated movie 2009. It sux
