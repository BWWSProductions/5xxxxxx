[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-12T22:43Z,"I will ask everyone who downloaded any of my movies and liked the quality to give them +1 quality because I saw some movies with a lot of thanks comments and -1-2 quality.That's just retarded if you ask me...so remember,+1 if you like the quality. "
,MrCristal,2010-01-21T18:45Z,"VERY +1

Keep up the good work!"
,Leksica,2010-12-12T12:43Z,"Something's wrong with aspect ration... Figures are longer, or picture should be a bit wider... Everzthing else is just perfect."
,dude8888,2011-03-30T21:06Z,"The last poster is correct
Th aspect ratio is wrong
It's 1.25
It should be 1.37
Makes the actors look tall & skinny..."
,SuperInfinity,2011-09-14T21:43Z,"^ Your player isn't adjusting it right, this rip comes from a PAL DVD. Try forcing a change in the aspect ratio as PAL doesn't use perfectly square pixels. If you use a player like VLC it should be easy. This also allows people to watch it on a PAL tv again with the full resolution. "
