The Bothy Band was an Irish traditional band from the 1970s, one of the most prominent from the roots revival of that era. Its members were: Matt Molloy - flute and tin whistle; Paddy Keenan - uillean pipes and tin whistle; Donal Lunny - bouzouki, guitar, and production; TrÃ­ona NÃ­ Dhomhnaill - harpsichord, clavinet and vocals; and MÃ­cheÃ¡l Ã“ Domhnaill - guitar and vocals. The initial lineup had Paddy Glackin on fiddle as well as Tony Mac Mahon on accordion. The band turned professional in November of 1975, with Tommy Peoples replacing Glackin on fiddle, to be replaced in turn by Kevin Burke in May of 1976.
