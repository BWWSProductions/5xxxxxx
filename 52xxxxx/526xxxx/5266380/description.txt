From Wiki:


The Grapes of Wrath are a Canadian folk rock band, who were one of Canada's most successful pop bands in the late 1980s and early 1990s before disbanding in 1992. With the band name tied up in litigation, most of the band continued to record through the 1990s as Ginger. The Grapes of Wrath then reunited for one album in 2000, although not with their full original lineup.


The Grapes of Wrath were formed in Kelowna, British Columbia in 1983 by Chris Hooper, Tom Hooper and Kevin Kane. Keyboardist Vincent Jones joined the band later. They came up with the name for the band after looking at a movie guide--nobody in the band had seen the movie or read the book. In 1984, they signed to Nettwerk, releasing a self-titled EP that year. The following year, their debut album September Bowl of Green was released.

1987's Treehouse, produced by Tom Cochrane, was the band's initial Canadian breakthrough, yielding the minor hit single "Peace of Mind".

Now and Again, released in 1989, was the band's most successful album. The band's tour to support this album was also notable for its opening act, a then-emerging singer/songwriter named Sarah McLachlan.

These Days, released in 1991, found the band experimenting with a harder rock sound, and while it sold well and spawned the hit singles "I Am Here" and "You May Be Right", it was to be the band's last effort for almost a decade. Citing creative differences, Kane left the band in 1992. The band's name and song catalogue were tied up in litigation for several years, forcing the remaining members to record under the name Ginger.

In 1999, Kane and Tom Hooper, the Grapes' main songwriting team, decided to work together again, and released Field Trip under the Grapes of Wrath name in 2000. However, neither Chris Hooper nor Vincent Jones participated in the reunion, and Matt Brain was enlisted as the band's new drummer.








Treehouse 1987


Treehouse was the second CD by The Grapes of Wrath, released in 1987 on Capitol Records. "Peace of Mind" was the band's first single to reach the RPM singles charts in Canada, peaking at #56. "Backward Town" and "O Lucky Man" were also released as singles.

Now And Again 1989


Now and Again was a 1989 album by The Grapes of Wrath. The band's most commercially successful album, it also contained one of their biggest hit singles, "All the Things I Wasn't".

The album was produced by Anton Fier. It was recorded in an old (and supposedly haunted) church in Woodstock, New York. Guest musicians included Chuck Leavell, Sneaky Pete Kleinow and Jane Scarpantoni.

In Chart magazine's 1996 reader poll of the Best Canadian Albums of All Time, Now and Again ranked in 47th place. In the magazine's 2000 poll, the album ranked 27th. It did not rank in the Top 50 in 2005.

For the singles "What Was Going Through My Head" and "Do You Want To Tell Me", the b-sides were songs recorded on CBC Radio program Brave New Waves. One was an acoustic version of the song "Backward Town", and the other was a cover of the Paul McCartney hit, "Let Me Roll It".

These Days 1991



These Days was a 1991 album by The Grapes of Wrath.

Produced by John Leckie, the album found the band attempting to expand their traditional folk rock sound in a more guitar-heavy alternative rock direction.

Although the album sold well, and spawned the hit singles "You May Be Right" and "I Am Here", it was not as popular with audiences or critics as its predecessor, 1989's Now and Again. Guest musicians on the album included Phil Comparelli and members of XTC (credited as the Dukes of Stratosphear.)

To promote the third single "A Fishing Tale", the band held a contest on Canadian music video channel MuchMusic entitled "Fishing with The Grapes Of Wrath". To be eligible to win, viewers had to submit the name of the magazine that Tom Hooper picks up in the video to win a fishing trip with Tom Hooper, Vincent Jones and MuchMusic VJ Terry David Mulligan.

These Days was the band's final album of new material for almost a decade. Following the album, Kevin Kane left the band, citing creative differences. The remaining members carried on under the new name Ginger.

Kane and Tom Hooper reunited in 2000 to record Field Trip under the Grapes of Wrath name, although the other band members did not participate in that project.
