with so many thanks, can you bring up from Rod Stewart, Sting & Bryan Adams ?"
[T],stanky1219,2010-01-08T07:40Z,"hey kitlope, not sure if you do requests but by chance could you get a motley crue partial discography in flac? (Too Fast For Love , Shout At The Devil , Theater Of Pain , Dr.Feelgood)

Or Maybe Point Me In The Direction Of A Good Torrent With These?

TPB Has A Few Albums In Flac But They Arent True Flac's. (My MP3 320 Copies Sound Better Than The So Called Flac Rips I Have Found. LOL)

Thanks For The Help In Advance."
