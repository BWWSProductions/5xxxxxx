DisableVertexBufferObjects=1

to the graphics option section of swkotor.ini file repaired that issue. Still from time to time game crashes, but loading times are pretty fast."

The idea of playing cards to raise money to buy guns is not what I wanna do in a game, or I would have DL'd a solitaire torrent! Other option is to ripoff all your neighbors apartments, who the FUCK wrote this shit?"
