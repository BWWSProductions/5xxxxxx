,tpuck35,2010-01-21T00:38Z,seed please
,pegasus-j,2010-02-03T17:39Z,please seed stuck on 60 %
,EMan856,2010-02-04T20:06Z,"seed please.
it was very fast until about 60% and now its hardly going at all."
,EMan856,2010-02-05T04:17Z,"this would be a great dl if it actually had someone seeding it.
its seriously impossible to move past 59.4%
and 59.4% takes a while to get to, so unless it gets any seeders, its a waste of time."
,saintspriest,2010-02-05T08:18Z,Seeding was't seeding because my computer right now sucks but will be continuing to seed until there is enough seeders for the torrent to live without me :P
