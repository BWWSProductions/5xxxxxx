I would really like to thank the one person who seeded me through this one.  One single seeder stuck with me and for that I say thanks a million.  That is the way I do it as well.  I mean before I delete the files I make sure of two things that I have given back what I have taken and that I don't leave anyone hanging.  Thanks again!!!"
