The title say it all, the original Zork trilogy packaged under DOSBox for OSX. You can still get the original  files over at infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html, as well as the original Mac binaries. That is, if you're looking to play it on an OS9. All three games run under DOSBox 0.72  DOSBOX.com , and I included a custom menu so there's no modifying configuration files to swap games.

I've also included the original Manuals in PDF format  #   for those who are either new to Zork, or too old to remember how to play!

It's a universal  #   binary, and should run on PPC. Tested on 10.6.2, runs great! 

WARNING: When saving games, do not use a filename, the designated zork#.dat file will store your game. If you choose to make a separate save file, place it in its own folder or make the name unique enough that you won't, for example, open a Zork 2 save in Zork 3.
