,valu59er,2010-01-07T01:17Z,"ermm
second series about to start on the 9th of Jan I think so if you dl it great"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-07T06:21Z,"@valu59er: I will follow BOTH ""...Human..."" series. One is a second season of BBC 3 ""Being Human"" (I watched S1, religiously, it's a story 'bout 3 roommates; a vampire, werewolf and a ghost (Premiere: February 18, 2008). Second one is FOX' ""Human Target"", a new US show, with Patricia Helfer (""Six""from Galactica).  So... both will be upped, IF UK ""Being Human"" gets released as 720p. I am sure for ""Human Target"" (Premiere: January 17, 2010)."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-07T09:32Z,"@valu59er: If you can say which one you interested for, I can upload, for instance, a ""Being Human"" S1 - episode-by-episode. So, let me know."
