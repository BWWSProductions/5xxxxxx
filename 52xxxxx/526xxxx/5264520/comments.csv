,deagun,2010-02-24T00:11Z,Thanks for the torrent... but can anybody confirm whether it works or not... Does it allow updating the game so that we can update the game with the update available at planetcricket.com
,deagun,2010-02-24T00:16Z,"Trust me... I have tried all the ashes cricket games here... 

None of them update...and without update, gameplay doesn't feel good at all... so can anybody confirm"
,deagun,2010-02-25T09:48Z,"After downloading the game... it doesn't require installing, just download, double click, and play.

But like all ashes cricket 2009 games on the net, this one doesn't update.

And on my computer, for some reason, all ashes cricket 2009 games that i downloaded from net would give one or two 100% CPU usage on start.... Which means game gets stuck once or twice while starting which is resolved by just pressing ctrl+alt+del and waiting for a while."
