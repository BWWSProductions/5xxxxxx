I have not - repeat NOT uploaded any more than 277MB on this torrent. There cannot possibly be ANY seeds, and any ip reporting over 12% should be regarded suspiciously.

I have aborted the upload, and would suggest you stop downloading immediately, until I can figure out what's going on."
[T],Ch4cal,2010-01-07T14:19Z,"Ok, I've just barred them using [djfred]'s Ip-filter and I'm uploading again.

I would recommend you guys install it and restart the torrent from scratch to stop them connecting to you as they're giving out bad data.

You can get it here:
http://torrentbucket.com

under Ip-Filter menu option."
[T],Ch4cal,2010-01-13T01:45Z,If you have peerguardian or ipfilter installed there's nothing to worry about. You should be running either or both of these anyway to be safe
