,Dermbet,2010-01-18T15:32Z,The Autotune component Fails to open in Logic Pro 8. Fails validation and logic can't open it. Not sure if this is cos it's OSX 10.6 
,thebeast8,2010-01-22T17:37Z,"This is awesome, it's nice to see someone trying to get us Mac users Autotune.

Could you do Autotune for Ableton Live and Snow leopard?

,jinXc,2010-01-28T10:14Z,"doesn't work on 10.5 either, fails validation"
,XMaramena,2010-02-21T18:06Z,"doesn't work on 10.5 - ""failed audio unit - contact author for updated version or assistance""..... thanks for considering us though - I'm sure it works for some people"
,stevejobs42,2010-03-06T10:01Z,"CFMd on Ableton (vst) running 10.6 

The app isn't even necessary just get the latest version of the demo. 

Make sure you use UDR correctly. All it does is track where the hidden footprint files are and delete them for you in a nice GUI. 

Funny, not one cfm, but 24 seeders?  worth a comment"
,c-low,2010-05-28T22:53Z,"SORRY GUYS.

PUT THE FILE IN
your Macintosh disk/ Library/ Audio/ Plug-ins/VST
