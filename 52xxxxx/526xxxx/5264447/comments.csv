,BenTrein,2010-01-07T14:13Z,"@Dudette: Pls don't condemn something you don't know or understand. It's your own lack of knowledge and skill.
Meanwhile, it's a way of wrapping files, to make them smaller so downloading takes less long, and the quality remains high. Some people appreciate it.
If you're using Windows, try installing RarZilla (google it!); that will unpack it. If your using linux, yum install unrar. On the Mac, I wish I knew... :) Macs are cool, but I know nothing about them. :p"

Why have you completely lost your shit? If unpacking a .rar file causes you to become unglued, how are you operating a computer at all?

,RedMatrix,2010-01-08T07:20Z,"OMG, there is always a huge debate on RARs vs full versions. I don't give a shit what format they are, but believe-you-me, I'm not keeping them in RAR format after unpacking.  SO, I won't be seeding this puppy after I unpack it, and THAT, my pirate friends, is why you shouldn't upload RARs. "
,acramerus,2010-01-08T07:27Z,"@ RedMatrix

So, just to be clear, we shouldn't upload RARs because you are a complete fucktard? Got it."
,tiewire,2010-01-08T13:25Z,"Dadutta just sit still and wait... Someone from TPB will be around shortly to wipe your arse for you. Then they'll throw you over their shoulder and berp your whiny arse as well... Here's a brilliant fucking thought if you don't agree with rar files, DON'T download. Crying lil bitch."

,RedMatrix,2010-01-09T20:26Z,"@acramerus  I have limited space on my laptop; don't want a download to occupy twice as much as it should.  And I'm not the only one who does this, btw; just the only one who says it out loud."

Im sick to death of all the ""please seed"" and ""fuck RAR"" comments. Just shut the fuck up!

,iconfig,2010-01-12T02:54Z,"@acramerus raring is a complete waste of time.

@Dudette lets stop the myth. raring will not noticeably compress most encoded video. and in most cases it actually adds 4 - 6mb extra on standard dvd rips. 

if you want to get into the technical explanation its like this, when we rip dvds we use encoding methods such as DIVX, h264, etc.

anyways when you encode your dvd rip from a raw rip the encoder compresses the video with a *lossy* compression.  when you rar it your already compressed video with a lossless format it cant compress it more because the video had already been compressed to its maximum with out using an even more lossy compression. then add 4-6 mb for the rar overhead and you have just increased the file size."
,Phatfish,2010-01-13T08:57Z,"Good rip.

Good movie. 

Maby Im jugemental but I find it very disturbing yet beautiful.
I feel confused now.

Anyway, thnx 4 the upld!"
,al64ne1,2010-01-31T10:18Z,"I'm with RedMatrix on this issue; for the same reason mostly.

Also, a 90% complete rar set is a waste of space, whereas a 90% complete movie file might skip a bit but works (at least for confirming quality...) who knows what's hiding in those packages or if they all work... I wouldn't touch a rar set if I didn't somewhat trust TvTeam's quality.

Just saying."
