                      PLOT                       
                                               
                                                       
     
 
 
        Set  against  the  backdrop   of  isolated  beauty  in   South
        Australia's   majestic   Flinders   Ranges,   Rachel    Ward's
        directorial  debut  is  a  new  landmark  in  Australian  film
        -making... This emotionally raw,  gothic love story reveals  a
        family bound by lies and torn apart by the truth.

        Ned (Ben Mendelsohn) has returned  to the family farm for  the
        first  time  in  decades,  seeking  reconciliation  with   his
        estranged  and  dying  father Bruce  (Bryan  Brown).  But what
        really draws Ned home are memories that have haunted him since
        adolescence - memories of sexual awakening, forbidden passion,
        suffocating guilt and a devastating family secret.

        Featuring  an  ensemble  cast of  some  of  Australia's finest
        actors including Rachel Griffiths, Maeve Dermody and  stunning
        newcomer  Sophie  Lowe  as  'Kate',  and  brought  to  life in
        parallel  strands of  past and  present, Beautiful  Kate is  a
        feast for the senses: bold, evocative and haunting.
