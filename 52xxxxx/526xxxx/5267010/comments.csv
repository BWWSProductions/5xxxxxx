,dungslinger,2010-01-16T00:27Z,"Anonymous or not, this is a real torrent. This package has been taken off all over the net and is very difficult to find now. Even this torrent stops at only 33.5% This really needs seeders that have the full package badly! 

Anyone know another place where this might be found? Any other torrents?"
,rfliffle,2010-01-17T01:31Z,"I don't know where to find any other torrents.
I have a 100% copy of the file, and I'm trying to seed it, but I can only have my computer up during certain times of the day."
,Fartsu,2010-01-18T02:16Z,"I got 45.4% currently and sorta seeding with it, but it's kinda hard when im being leeched 24/7! 135 leechers, only 1 seeder. not a good mix"
,dungslinger,2010-01-21T03:46Z,Its getting better! There are many of us nearing 80% now. I appreciate the seeding! When I get it all I will be seeding this for awhile.
,dungslinger,2010-01-22T23:06Z,Thanks to those who few who seeded. Now there are at least 12 of us who have the complete torrent and it works awesome!!!!

,rfliffle,2010-02-02T01:30Z,"@kaito01234: Also, did you open the POCALOID manager and initialize the voice database?"
,kaito01234,2010-02-06T17:07Z,@rfliffle yes 
,TKaiSo4,2010-02-08T01:50Z,"I'm a little confused. I was uploading everything properly like the Read Me said to, but what does it mean by, ""Mount the iso file""
I don't really understand how to install/load the voices. o-o;"
,TKaiSo4,2010-02-08T02:53Z,"Oh, never mind :3 I got things to work out."
,tamararashi,2010-02-14T17:54Z,How do you add accents to Pocaloid?  A long time ago I tried out Vocaloid2 and it had this icon palette that you used to put articulation into the singing.  I can't find anything like that here TwT
,zarbonno,2010-02-15T21:47Z,"Win32/CryptExe found in POCALOID2.exe through AVG after install, is this a false positive?"
,zarbonno,2010-02-16T15:35Z,"Just checked all the install files and they ALL have it... I need to know, are these false positives? And if not, can the files be cleaned? AVG just wants to vault/delete them all :P"
,zarbonno,2010-02-16T16:11Z,"Correction: setup_english.exe and setup_japanese.exe are the only ones with it, it seems"
,rfliffle,2010-02-21T01:56Z,@zarbonno AVG thinks everything is a virus. Seriously.
,SkyPirate48,2010-04-04T00:48Z,"rfliffle, did you solve your voice initializing problem, I'm having that problem. After mounting the iso, I follow instructions, and click on singereditor2, but then, contradicting the instructions which tell me to click on add voice, I'm just told that no voices datas can be found. My problem is that I haven't been given the chance to add voices, because before I'm given the option, I'm told it can't find any. Grr, HALP!"
,rfliffle,2010-04-05T02:54Z,@SkyPirate48 Did you actually install the voice before adding them?
,tora_neko,2010-04-30T23:52Z,i can't get the english voices to play any sound. i followed the instructions in the readme. what should i do?
,rfliffle,2010-05-13T02:50Z,@tora_neko Make sure you're not making the English voices sing a Japanese vsq file. They're incapable of doing so.
,sol_eternal,2010-05-29T02:43Z,10 stars to the uploader. Thank you.
,sol_eternal,2010-05-29T18:52Z,"also, from what I've searched and found out is that win32/cryptexe is a false positive. should be okay."
,Johnnyjack777,2010-06-25T21:25Z,"UGH...  when it doesn't work,

do you have POCALOID2.exe in the program files somewhere?

If not, or if it cannot access it; The install failed and didn't tell you, or your virus scan blocked it,
must first disable resident shield (or w/e)

And then if it's still giving false positives/access errors,"
,Johnnyjack777,2010-06-25T21:26Z,"You can disable AVG from scanning some folders. To do this:
1. Start AVG UI
2. Tools? ? Advanced settings
3. ?Resident Shield? ? ?Exceptions?
4. Click on ?Add'
5. Browse to the path to be excluded from AVG scanning
6. Click on OK"
,Johnnyjack777,2010-06-25T21:30Z,"Aand now it crashes if I click on the keyboard on the Left, ideas?"
,Johnnyjack777,2010-06-25T21:41Z,"Fuck nevermind :)  Thx for the great install homes, can't imagine how suck it'd be without the manager

cannot open voice synthesizer?  
Fuxxed up the install of the voice, and the path doesn't exist until you ok'd it in the singereditor.

Turn off AVG and reinstall everything"
,Nothing.at.all,2010-10-31T13:54Z,"No seeders? C'mon! Help some of the late comers, please? :/"
,firebirdresistance,2010-11-07T05:40Z,"oh my... I don't have AVG in my computer and it says that there is no audio output device specified and then it says that it can't open the Synthesis Engine!! Please guys, help!! It's been like 3 months that I'm trying to download Pocaloid2!!"
,firebirdresistance,2010-11-07T06:20Z,"Also, I mounted all the iso files I had (voices) and installed them but, I can't get them in my SingerEditor2! It always ask me to overwrite everything and it even seems that all the iso files that I installed earlier doesn't exists. And it also seems that they kind of reset themselves because I have to install them again. I did so but it didn't changed anything. Could you help me with this matter too?"
,stdokuro,2010-11-20T02:00Z,"How come pocaloid voice editor won't let me add a voice? I have installed everything correctly, and I have read the readme, and every time I try to open up voice editor it just says error, same goes for when I just try to upload regular pocaloid. What am I doing wrong? I do have the .iso files."

,taiju,2011-01-03T20:20Z,"Hm installed this about 5 times...doesn't work for me unfortunately. Followed the instructions to the letter. AVG keeps detecting a crypt.exe virus as well, which I suppose may be a false +ve. When i try to check my installation I get an ""POCALOID 2 NOT INSTALLED"" message. The voices install but the program itself just doesn't work."
,taiju,2011-01-03T20:45Z,Okay...disabled AVG and it worked...need to get my old Kaspersky back up. AVG is a bit ridiculous.
,ShredderSan,2011-04-18T14:18Z,"I can't get this to work. I follow the instructions properly and when I'm trying to start Pocaloid, nothing happens. When I check the activity monitor, there's no activity in the computer, aka. nothing is loading. I've tried to re-install the shit like 5 times now. What am I doing wrong?"
,ShiunYean,2011-09-09T06:41Z,This needs seeders!
,argayadi,2011-09-18T11:15Z,"this program work 100% in my PC. but first, i must turn off any anti virus likely AVG or other. 2nd after complete instalation and test the program, i can't input any english liric to singing by program, Just Japanes language will be accepted in program.... any idea friends ^_^? about prog app POCALOID2 International Language...pure ^_^"""

,BWHD,2012-03-27T00:48Z,"I keep getting ""POCALOID2 was not found. Did you install POCALOID2?"" Mcafee is on my computer but i cant access the program at all. as if its gone but left everything about behind. im ready to uninstall it but its not my program. so id like to avoid such a thing. any help? i know it installs because i watch the installer and see that pocaloid2.exe is extracted. but after its dont its gone. i made a dummy file with that name to check all the other files and the checker says they are all good. so i think my exe file is somewhere."
,BWHD,2012-03-27T00:51Z,screw im uninstalling mcafee. its shit anyways.
,skulldragon,2012-04-02T06:14Z,"Works, no viruses, custom, faster installation, so just forget about the original Vocaloid and get this instead!"
,B101,2012-05-28T19:53Z,"Damn this is huge,well prob leave my PC on download when i go fishing this weekend."
,stsmm,2012-06-05T04:33Z,when i try to start pocaloaid nothing happens at all. no process start. what do i do
,sharkyea,2012-06-25T19:37Z,"For those of you having trouble with the voice banks...

Open the readme and install the setups that it tells you to (it's really straightforward).


Then EXTRACT the contents of the .iso's into the same folder and then run the setup from there.

I've found that mounting the .iso's doesn't always make it work.

Then open the singer editor, and click add for each Vocaloid voice you would like to use on your program. The first vocaloid's program change number will be 0, but any ones you add afterward must be one up. (If you have 8 vocaloids in total, the last one's change number would be 7.)

It worked for me, and now I can use Gumi, Gakupo, Yuki, Kiyoteru, Rin, Len, Miku and Luka without any problems.

Good luck :D"
