Note from uploader of torrent:
I went through the hard agonizing work of downloading every .rar file and compiling them into the .iso files.

POCALOID2 is exactly like VOCALOID2 in look and feel, so you can even trick yourself into thinking it's VOCALOID2. I'm not a member of peace-out, but personally I even prefer it to the original VOCALOID2 editor, as it fixed several bugs I hated in the original software. It also installs quickly (downloading is slower than installing).

Please, please, please read the readme. Also, remember to download only the voices you want. If you already have the other VOCALOID2 software, they're two separate programs, so you can have them both on the same computer without worrying about things screwing up.
