Keep Up the Awesome Work!

Say, What programs you using to convert mkv to m4v?

Ive used Handbreak and a took called ""Videotag"" to tag the info. But that process takes me seriously 48+ hrs from start to finish. Im on a pc. Any suggestions?

I like to help out uploading some new content. But seems like its taking way to long for my cpu to be bogged up."
,krillert,2010-01-09T12:54Z,Great upload HR! Playing all native now but gonna try to test the streaming on this. :)

,krillert,2010-01-09T22:26Z,"@HolyRoses Have orderd a new external HDD and have the flash drive ready. I can let you know how it turns out.

Im gonna format it HFS tho. However since Mac can read from both NTFS and HFS i think it doesnt matter. "

,dirtydog9,2010-01-20T05:07Z,hey can you tell me how to burn this ?do i use img burner to play this on ps3 let me know .
,pearljamaussie,2010-01-24T07:20Z,"looks fantastic that quality, thanks."
,WatchALot,2010-06-05T10:03Z,"Pretty good quality for its filesize, has more artefacts than if the source had been a BR directly. Recodes usually do that.

But then, we download this because we don't want to clutter our hard drives with 8Gb movies and waste bandwidth and wait 2 weeks for the download :)

Well done, HolyRoses, and thanks for the effort."
,hellspawn51,2010-07-04T12:45Z,"this torrent rocks!!!!

could you release Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy BRRIP in 720p???? i did find a link once but it had no seeds..."
,GaEbon,2010-09-18T10:09Z,This is a good quality release.  This was originally a French print done in English.  The timing marks are slightly off so that subtitle files (from English versions) do not sync properly. 
,Sammy0710,2012-03-08T22:23Z,Great Upload! Can you please do a 720p Step Brothers rip?
