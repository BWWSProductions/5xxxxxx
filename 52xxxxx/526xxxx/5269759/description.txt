RESET WINDOWS PASSWORDS (LIGHT EDITION)

This is a bootable ISO great for computer techs or anyone needing to log on to a Windows computer locked with a password. This has been tested on a Win XP machine and Vista. Havent tested Win 7 yet but i will update everyone when i do.

This is a great software. U just burn to disk then boot the computer to disk. It takes u to a screen to enter a new password for the account u select. Once this is done U are now able to log on with the new password without knowing the old one.
