If he puts all the movies I want to see in the same place for me to find them and they are good quality then I don't have to scour The Pirate Bay to find those 4 other uploaders and then download until I find a good copy.  This is a service, and I personally don't care who it is that UL's, it's not like the original UL'er gets donations or any form of payment so be an adult.  You're all stealing the movies from the companies that make them."

Aside from that. You're exactly correct. These kiddies need to stop whining."
