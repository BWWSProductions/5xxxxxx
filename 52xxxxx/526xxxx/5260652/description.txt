	A U.S. marshal (Kate Beckinsale), the only one assigned to Antarctica, 
	must investigate a murder there within three days before the Antarctic 
	winter begins. She crosses paths with a U.N. operative (Gabriel Macht), 
	also investigating the murder.She must chase down suspects and find more 
	murders. Early in the story, Steko is attacked by the killer and left for 
	dead in a storm. She saves herself but loses two fingers due to severe 
	cold-related injuries.
	For U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko, things are about to get even more dangerous. 
	The only law enforcement in this unforgiving territory, she has just been sent 
	to investigate a body on the ice. Antarctica's first homicide. A shocking 
	discovery in itself, it will plunge her into an even more bizarre mystery 
	and the revelation of secrets long-buried under the endless ice--secrets that 
	someone believes are still worth killing for. As Stetko races to find the killer 
	before he finds her, winter is already closing in. In the deadly Antarctic 
	whiteout, she won't see him till he's a breath away.
