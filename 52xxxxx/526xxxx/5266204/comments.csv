[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-08T17:28Z,"yeah i'm running everything off 1970's equipment, i'm saving the really gritty records for a usb turntable :)"
,SpikeBit,2010-01-09T01:47Z,Thanks for all the vinyl rips! Do you have any ABBA?
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-09T10:34Z,"i have Super Trouper by Abba, just give me a day or so to finish uploading this 7.22 gig file, and it'll be the next one up :D"
,SpikeBit,2010-01-09T14:26Z,"Thank's mate! You just made my day :)
Btw, if your are looking for a USB turntable check out the Pro-Ject Debut III USB. It's awesome for it's price, quality and features it have."
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-09T17:29Z,"i like the pro ject too, but i've had my eye on this $400 sony, high torque usb turntable :) just waiting for my balls to drop lol"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-11T15:18Z,"ahhh spike, i've had super trouper sitting in my utorrent for days now, if only i could upload :("
,blendeture,2010-10-31T02:22Z,"I tried to only download ""Run To You"". 

(Thanks to GTA Vice City, I like that song.) 

But I was forced to download those other 2 pieces of shit (shitty like the rest of Bryan Adams' discography) because they were each mislabelled. Turns out 1 is 2, 2 is 3, and 3 is 1.

I also feel that the CD in 44 khz FLAC would sound better than this 45rpm in 48 khz FLAC. But I'm still impressed with how well it turned out. 

Still, the Canadian government has apologised for Bryan Adams on several occasions."
