It's simple you take the crack (in this case it's GTA_SA) and put it in in file you installed it in.

ex: c:program files\Rockstar Games\GTA San Andreas

Just paste it to that location (assuming you installed it to the default directory ) 

PS. There's tons of videos of it all over the internet (youtube is a good place to start looking)"
