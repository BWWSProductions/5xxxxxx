,Irda,2010-01-08T08:25Z,"My question is, Why Why this need to zip?"
,digital_elph,2010-01-08T19:55Z,"@irda,  think i read on suprbay that more than 500 files in 1 torrent should be zipped due to technical reasons.  i had multiple torrents with 600+ files that would tpb would not upload until i zipped to 1 file.

but i feel you, i hate zips for jpg sets too."
