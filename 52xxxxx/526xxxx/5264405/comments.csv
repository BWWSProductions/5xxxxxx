,achromicflame,2010-01-24T08:28Z,"I thought i'd leave this comment this for future reference in case someone is wondering the same thing. I downloaded the 720p version, so i don't know if it's is the same in this one. The 720p has the missing scene , but there is no sound. Now i'm sure some of you might immediately think is it possible that it's your computer or media player, etc etc. It's not, because i checked and triple checked to see if it was. I even sat through the whole film TWICE without a problem up that scene at the end of the credits. "
