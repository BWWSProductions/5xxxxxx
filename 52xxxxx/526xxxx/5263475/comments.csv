Seriously, watch this as much as you can, and buy the DVD. It's worth it, since it goes directly to the artist, and he's doing something truly astonishing here."

It looks like it was supposed to be 16:9, but was encoded as 4:3 with the black bars, and then stretched back out to 16:9. So it is wider than it is supposed to be, and still has black bars. To see what I am talking about force the aspect ratio to 4:3, it looks much better and less stretched out.

Wish there was a better version. If I end up fixing it for myself I may re-upload it. It will be annoying because the only way I know how to do it would be to use a converter to force it back to 4:3 then run it again to crop it to 16:9. I would like to just buy the DVD soon and rip it myself."
