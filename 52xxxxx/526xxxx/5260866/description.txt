 
PC-BSD is a complete desktop operating system, which has been designed with the "casual" computer user in mind. It offers the stability and security that only a BSD-based operating system can bring, while at the same time providing a comfortable user experience, allowing you to get the most out of your computing time. With PC-BSD you can spend less time working to fix viruses or spyware  #   and instead have the computer work for you.
Installing the system is simply a matter of a few clicks and a few minutes for the installation process to finish. Hardware  #   such as video, sound, network and other devices will be auto-detected and available at the first system startup. Home  #   users will immediately feel comfortable with PC-BSD's desktop interface  #  , with KDE 4.x running under the hood  #  . Software installation  #   has also been designed to be as painless as possible, simply double-click and software  #   will be installed.
