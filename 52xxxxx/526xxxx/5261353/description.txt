Rock In Rio is a live album recorded in Brazil by Iron Maiden in 2001. Here they faced their second largest ever crowd - 250,000 people - the first being their 1985 Rock In Rio performance to a crowd of 400,000, and with the relatively recent return of lead singer Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith to the band, they recorded their fifth live album.

It features many of their best known tracks, including the eponymous "Iron Maiden" and "Run to the Hills" coupled with some of their "comeback" tracks, such as "The Wicker Man" and "Brave New World." Less popular songs were also performed, such as Bruce Dickinson's versions of the Blaze Bayley-era songs "Sign of the Cross" and "The Clansman".
