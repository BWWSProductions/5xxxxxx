The songwriting on the album was split between Roy Z and Dickinson. During composition, Roy sent recordings of riffs to Dickinson, who was on tour with Iron Maiden. Dickinson subsequently wrote lyrics and melodies. Roy also served as the album's producer and played all guitar parts as well as some supplemental bass guitar and piano parts. Drummer David Moreno featured a double bass for the album, notably using it for a blast beat in "Abduction" and for the opening of "Soul Intruders."

The song Kill Devil Hill is inspired by the successful flight by the Wright brothers in 1903.

The song Navigate the Seas of the Sun is inspired by Erich Von DÃ¤niken's theory about extraterrestrial presence on Earth long ago and about man dealing with that in the future.

The title track A Tyranny of Souls is somewhat based on Shakespeare's tragedy MacBeth, and includes direct quotes and lines from the play throughout the song.
