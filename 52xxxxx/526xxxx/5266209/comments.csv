,diyadokeon,2010-01-07T19:31Z,Thanks for the upload.
,Andy_S,2010-01-08T00:18Z,recode of 1080i - will there be THAT (1080) version sometime? Of any ep? I think i am not the only one that wants the best possible picture quality.
,Upquark2,2010-01-08T00:59Z,"There are many season 7 episodes available in 1080i format on Usenet. As for torrents, I haven't seen those."
,diyadokeon,2010-01-08T05:51Z,"I've actually seen a couple of torrents that seem to contain HD stream dumps (.ts, about 3.5 GB per episode) on isohunt. Haven't tried them, though, and they're quite rare. For this kind of quality to become common we probably need to wait for cheap bluray or external HDD/SSD-s."
,Upquark2,2010-01-08T10:47Z,"Yeah, and personally, I don't think the quality isn't worth the file size. Quite happy with 720p...

But, if you REALLY want them 1080i ones, check this out: http://nzbindex.nl/search/?q=mythbusters&age=&max=25&sort=agedesc&minsize=2000&maxsize=&poster=&nfo=&hidespam=0&hidespam=1&more=1"

And according to TV.com this is s08e01, the 2010 season premiere."
