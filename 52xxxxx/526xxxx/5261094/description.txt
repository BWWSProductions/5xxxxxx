Hello everyone.

This little gem is just a copy of the CD included with the Dilbert 2.0 - 20 Years of Dilbert book, and include all Dilbert strips from its start in 1989 up to the production date in 2008. It is supposed to include every Dilbert strip from that period, though a few seems to be missing from 1993, not sure if only 359 strips came out that year, or if its a mistake.

The CD itself got "Cartoons published after the cut-off date on this DVD can be viewed at www.dilbert.com" printed on it but don't be fooled, its a CD, not a DVD :)

But enjoy all the Dilbert strips, and remember, if you like it, buy the book at amazon.com, amazon.co.uk, or any other bookstore of your choise, its fairly cheap, $35.17/Â£29.63 for the full book.
