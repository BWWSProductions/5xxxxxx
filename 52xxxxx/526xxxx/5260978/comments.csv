,brglnd,2010-02-23T12:29Z,Why are half of the songs not working?
,AScottToney,2010-02-23T19:47Z,"I noticed that, too. iTunes won't add a few of the songs."
,Dark_anth,2010-03-06T18:16Z,"Idk, it works for me. and everybody else. "
,MadKingSoupII,2010-03-07T01:38Z,"Nope, didn't work for me either. Tracks 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11 were okay, but nothing would recognise the rest."
,Fyrous,2010-05-12T00:09Z,doesn't add all tracks for me either...
,Brends2008,2010-08-08T08:57Z,"Only track #6 won't play with me, even though I already converted it to WAV file."

,burningrabbit,2011-02-15T01:58Z,"why don't the songs work? because they're musicians, dumbshit!"
,Montsuyashi,2011-07-23T22:06Z,"Half the songs don't work, some that do aren't labeled right or somesuch and so some songs are missing it seems. One song is even like rap or something..."
,marty-78,2011-12-14T18:46Z,NO THE SONGS DON'T ALL WORK. JACK ASS!
,mrztheory,2012-05-02T06:47Z,"All the songs do not work. If you think they do, try DL on a computer that is not yours, why would several people make something like that up."
