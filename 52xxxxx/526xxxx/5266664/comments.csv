,PHILLE_,2010-01-08T02:54Z,what do you mean? if you press on files all apps will come upp.
,NoGoodNick,2010-01-08T21:15Z,"The ""List Files"" feature has a limit on it of 50 files*. Thus, there's no mention of the remaining 55. Plus, usually there's directory, icons, pictures, etc.

That's why folk usually prefer a simple list of applications instead of simply dumping them into a torrent and saying ""Here they are folks, enjoy!""

*At least, that was/is the limit either here or an some Other torrent site. Hey, I'm human, sometimes I confuse sites since I visit so many! ;D "
,NoGoodNick,2010-01-08T21:17Z,"Opps! My bad. Looks like there ARE 105 files listed. Guess I'm thinking either Demonoid or the OLD Mini.

Sorry bout that."

Sorry I accused you of something you didn't do."
