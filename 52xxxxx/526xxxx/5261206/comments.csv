,duz2600,2010-01-17T02:30Z,"Retired, disabled military have a choice of paying for the medications, or, getting the ARRL handbook, this month.

When ARRL membership is renewed at Hamcation 2010, there will be sme free ARRL books, and deep discounts on other ARRL books, at which time many of us pensioned veterans  can make a  purchase.  

Meanwhile, you save the day for my needs to have this for reference, as I build my own equipment from old TV, Stereo, and Computer salvage!

You perform a great service to many. Thank you!  "
