Spooks Biography

Inspired by the rap/R&B success of the Fugees, Spooks came together in the late '90s with a similar message and group structure, but a much different musical approach. Consisting of vocalist Ming Xia and MCs Mr. Booka-T, Vengeance, Water Water, and Hypno, the group's male-female dynamic brought comparisons to the Fugees almost immediately. The difference lies in the production, which referenced trip-hop and jungle and rarely stuck to a typical hip-hop structure. Boasting this unique approach, the group recorded S.I.O.S.O.S., Vol. 1 in 1999 for Artemis Records. The album was a huge success in Europe, where it turned gold in France, Belgium, Sweden, and Germany, but hardly made a dent in American markets. They re-released the record and put together a live band for their live shows in an attempt to woo U.S. audiences, but the single for "Things I've Seen" did catch on and the group quietly disappeared soon after. ~ Bradley Torreano, All Music Guide

Turns out one of the guys died, which most likely lead to them disbanding, I always loved ming-xia's vocals on the spooks tracks and found any solo work she has been doing to add to this torrent.  Apparently she is working on actually dropping an album quite soon  but in the meantime we have this to listen to, the last track on the website I was unable to rip but you can find it at www.mingmusik.com

enjoy her voice!
