,adp28,2009-12-23T19:41Z,"Hi secret_myth,
I've never really posted any requests as I'm more than grateful for the movies you provide. But, I would like to request you this one time. 
As your ripping techniques have vastly improved, compared to your earlier rips IMHO, could you please re-rip & upload some of the lengthy movies? To give a few examples: Titanic, King Kong 2005, The Shawshank Redemption, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. These movies were ripped in 1.4 GB size each, but because of their lengths, the output quality suffers, in some cases.
Thanks a lot for your efforts to provide us with high quality movies."

,the_devious,2009-12-24T00:21Z,"When you encode, you're supposed to use numbers that are divisible by 16 in order to obtain best video results. So you have ripped to 1280 x 688 (not 690). Really, these are fundamentals of video encoding. I just don't get why you keep transgressing these basics, man. I'll get the REFiNED. Thanks."
,oldSMfan,2009-12-24T00:37Z,"@ the_devious

You go get the REFiNED ... though, since you complain ans correct, I would really love to see one of yr rips?! Haven't seen any around lately?! ... As a matter of fact, you haven't ripped anything!!

In order for someone to complain, correct, or rectify a person, YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO DO BETTER, otherwise what's the point. 

Pshicologically comments such as these tend to be made by those who wish they could do something but are left with nothing but envy.

You go now and have a Merry Xmas, the_devious!!

Cheers SM!

,gonzoeight,2009-12-25T21:02Z,"Does anyone know why I can't watch Secretmyths downloads on my WDTV Live in Dolby Digital? When I convert the movie using convertx it plays on DVD in Dolby Digital, but not through the WDTV live, it plays in Dolby Pro Logic II for some reason. Or any help on how to convert the sound from aac to something the WD will read as 6 channel "
,IIIIIIM6IIIIII,2009-12-25T21:16Z,Thanks. Can also upload the 2009 version.

It's up to you to decide if the risk is worth it or not, my service is in jeopardy of being shut off because i tried to download this (including many other piratebay torrents downloaded in the past)

My current stance is to go only with totally private trackers cuz the large trackers such as piratebay or demonoid are most likely to be those that are attacked by the greedy media producers.

Aside from this, ""secret_myth,"" your movie rips are absolutely amazing, the quality is above all others.  Keep up the great work, if you upload to any private tracker i would love to know about it."

A request though.. could you make DIVX BD rips? I cant watch ur stunning rips on tv (and thats missing something huge) cause I cant afford a PS or an Xbox... all I have is a plain old DVD player which plays DIVX... 

Thanks alot for the grt work!
"
,Incamal,2010-04-04T16:17Z,"Oh God, this is an absolutely stunning movie, and guess what, Our Top notch Ripper, Secret Myth, has uploaded the movie too, which makes it far better!
But there is one thing bothering:
I've watched the original ending (not a secret myth version) and have read about the alternate ending, and I gotta say the original one is far too much better than the alternate, and if secret myth had uploaded the original cut, I would download and watch it again, although I've watched it once!"
