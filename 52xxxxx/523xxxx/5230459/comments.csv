,sacrael,2009-12-20T14:30Z,out of the sync totally. Terrible.
,shaunol,2009-12-20T15:00Z,"Maybe your brain is totally out of sync, I just watched the whole thing and it was perfect."
,priapisme,2009-12-20T15:24Z,"This is SEVERELY out of sync (multiple seconds) in Media player Classic and Windows Media Player. The weird thing is; using VLC, I had no delay.

So be warned: if you're not using VLC, this won't be very enjoyable... (yes I know about the audio shift option in MPC, but I rather not spend 10 minutes fine-tuning it...)"
,pixman69,2009-12-20T16:14Z,Works perfectly on Linux Mint with Totem v2.28.2
,stealthmonkey,2009-12-20T16:38Z,"Ahhhhhhh I LOVE YOU!!! ;]
I did not want to watch the Delta9 release even though i had it. Thanks!"
,Zone15,2009-12-20T16:41Z,"People like to watch shows on their standalone players, that's why it should stay xvid."
,gream01,2009-12-20T19:44Z,"this is out of sync because it has a high resolution for most video cards to play well.
to make it sync you have to decrease the resolution 
to something like 640 by 360 or by 1/2"
,shaunol,2009-12-21T12:56Z,It's also possible that out of sync issues and any other errors could be attributed to out of date codecs.
,priapisme,2009-12-21T18:08Z,"shaunol: ""It's also possible that out of sync issues and any other errors could be attributed to out of date codecs. ""

I thought of that, and that's probably what it is, but I never had any problems with my codecs before, and I've had them for a couple of years.
They play other .mkv files without sync-issues and so on, so I won't go through the hassle to update them just for this one file.

On another note; The video quality was indeed great."
,CaptainMidnight,2009-12-25T18:25Z,"""People like to watch shows on their standalone players, that's why it should stay xvid.""

So go look for an Xvid version. Sheesh. If you like having a lower quality codec, there are still plenty of choices out there. And stop trying to speak for all ""people."" This particular person isn't locked into older technology like you are."
,ravenlord_79,2009-12-27T18:09Z,does someone really use windows mediaplayer? 
,herniator,2009-12-30T05:49Z,"There is a glitch at the beginning of the file that causes it to immediately go out of sync in directshow players.  VLC works.  Or you can re-save the file in a video editor/encoder like Avidemux (free, open-source) without re-encoding the data.  As long as you only choose to copy the audio and video streams this should only take a few seconds to do.  MP4 or MKV containers are suitable.

Better video quality that the xvid versions, but too high resolution for such a low bit-rate.  It would be better to resize it to 960x540 with the same bitrate."
