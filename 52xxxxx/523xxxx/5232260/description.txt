"God Bless the Child" is a song by Canadian singer Shania Twain. It was the eighth and final single released from her 1995 album The Woman in Me. The song was written by Twain and an extended version cowritten by Mutt Lange. The song became Twain's first single off The Woman in Me to not hit the top 40 at country radio. The original album version is more a poem than a song, done completely a cappella. For radio airplay, the song had to be expanded lyrically and musically. It was originally released to radio in October of 1996. "God Bless the Child" was included on Twain's Come on Over Tour usually accompanied by a local choir, but was not included on her 2004 Greatest Hits release. All singles sales from the United States were donated to Second Harvest/Kids Cafe, and from Canada to Breakfast for Learning. Twain performed the song at the 1996 Country Music Awards.

The song spent 9 weeks on the chart and climbed to a peak position of number 48 on January 11, 1997, where it remained for one week.
