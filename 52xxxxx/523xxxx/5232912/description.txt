Always liked Brittany Murphy here (beautiful), and her eat-in chicken. Was just thinking of her for some reason. Note swizzly Angela Bettis in the cast. Yum. Should up something featuring her. Yes. Good idea.

AR: 480x270 (16:9) -- yeah 16:9 is probably the wrong ratio for this movie, but it appears to be the undistorted ratio for the source rip. tried it at 1.85; not good.

Another HR-PiZ team entry. If it doesn't work the same as a HolyRoses (PBUH) PSP-iPod-Zune encode, leave an informative comment.
