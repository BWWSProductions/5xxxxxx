Might notice something cool if you get this and the iPod version and put them both in your iTunes 9 ;-)

Designed for direct playback on Apple TV, PS3, WDTV, Xbox360, Popcorn Hour, VLC.

For WDTV Live change extension from .m4v to .mp4

For Xbox360 use "Make Xbox 360 ok.cmd" batch file to make stereo only.
For Popcorn Hour use "Make Popcorn Hour ok.cmd" batch file to remove subtitle.

(You must be on a PC running windows to use the batch files.  Just double click on the one you need and then do nothing until the black box goes away.  You will then have a brand new .MP4 file.  You can throw away the original .M4V or keep it, it doesn't matter.  You must use the newly created .MP4 file for your system.)
