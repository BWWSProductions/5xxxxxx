OK, HERE IT IS,, if somone could help me along,, 
1. If COD modern warfare isn't in applications already move it there

2. get steam FOR MAC not the windows version that runs through crossover,, here are links for 2 different versions
(this is the one i used but it seems to be down at the moment)
 
http://snow-leopard.ning.com/page/steam-for-mac (havnt tried this one but it should be the same)  
 
3, Download http://www.qurlyq.com/7j3 (u have to fill out survays but just write random stuff)

4, UNRAR all of the files and replace the files in applications-->Modern WarFare 2.app (rightclick show package contents) /Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Programme/Activision/Modern Warfare 2 

5, Then go to applications/modernwarfare2/contents/info.plist (open in text edit) then about 3/4 of the way down change 
<string>c:ProgrammeActivisionModern Warfare 2iw4sp.exe</string>
to
<string>c:ProgrammeActivisionModern Warfare 2iw4mp.exe</string>

change the iw4sp.exe to iw4mp.exe then save

6, Finaly go into your mac version of steam and login to your account, then go to file --> settings --> friends and change your nickname to somthing with a space in it, i was sanjeb and now i am sanjeb 123, so yer,

7, NOW this is very important, go to MY GAMES tab on steam and click on add-non steam game, then click browse, then at the top pull down menu click z: then navagate to applications then to your cod modern warfare 2 folder 
applications-->Modern WarFare 2.app/Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Programme/Activision/Modern Warfare 2/IW4MP.EXE and then add it to the games list, then just open it from in steam and it should be running,, 

There is only one problem this only allows you to play online for a couple of minute because you get kick but i am working on a fix for this,,, MERRY CHRISTMASS (OR FESTIVE CELEBRATION OF YOUR RELIGION :) ) PEACE OUT Y'ALL
