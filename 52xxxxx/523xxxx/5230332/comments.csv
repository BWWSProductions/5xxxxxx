Thanx for the up KLAXXON.

Info: The true story of the beautiful and charismatic Barbara Daly, who married above her class to Brooks Baekeland, heir to the Bakelite plastics fortune. Their only child is a failure in his father's eyes, and as he matures and becomes increasingly close to his lonely mother, the seeds for tragedy are sown.

Hey KLAXXON, can you by any chance upload the movie, The Gatekeeper? I've been searching everywhere for it. Here is the link to it on IMDB - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309622/"
