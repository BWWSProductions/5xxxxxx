,papajackb,2009-12-26T14:33Z,new to this how to tell if the Gib is NTSC format for zone 1?? could use some help.. Thanks
,jurjenb,2009-12-28T02:21Z,"It says: region 0, so it's region free (as pretty much every video dvd you'll find on this website). If you also read the details more closely, you'll see that it's PAL, not NTSC. However, most modern sophisticated dvd players and tvs nowadays support both formats."

,rj28,2010-01-17T19:29Z,How come there are only 6 comments??
[T],FaeGiN,2010-01-18T15:03Z,"Various reasons for the lack of comments.
the first is the most obvious, people are too damn lazy or selfish to even bother to take two seconds to say thanks.
The other is that this is a DVDR and most folk are in such a rush they grab the avi files of movies most of the time....those bloody reencodes etc.
Thirdly I reckon a few people would have opened this page, saw the description in a different language than English and then closed the page again as it seems to me that 70% of people online just do not read passed about 2 or 3 lines of text on a page before deciding to bail out if they are not grabbed by it.
The 'no attention span generation'...what a nightmare.
Heh."
,rj28,2010-01-18T22:01Z,"Thanks for you comment FaeGiN, I'm fairly new at downloading torrents so that's why i asked. When I finish downloading this torrent, I'll comment.    "

Quality DVD! With menu included."
,elmosfire,2011-03-05T00:18Z,Thanks for this wonderful RIP!!! I was just wondering if someone can point me to the right direction so that I may learn how to add my own subtitles to these types of files. Specifically Greek which I think are not included in this. Any help would be appreciated.
,diirkje,2011-04-02T23:20Z,"whats wrong this quality??
