Saying Yes to Life -- Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev

"If you used your discriminatory mind properly to its fullest extent you would become â€˜yes and yes'."
- Sadhguru

In â€˜Saying Yes to Lifeâ€™, Sadhguru lays bare our obsessions with the body and mind, and our limited refrain of â€˜whatâ€™s in it for me.â€™ He provides an exit option from our miserly bondage by offering a path to embracing life in its totality.

Question: Sadhguru when you begin to say yes, and when you experience what that yes does to you, and there is this exuberance, like you are melting then around you there is no, what about, then how to go on with that?
