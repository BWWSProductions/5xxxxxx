This is The black edition made by somebody else, but i have hacked it so you can install on a USB Device."
,xion1992,2009-12-29T16:30Z,"Dunno if this has something to do with this release.
I installed this on a USB-stick. When the installation was done, i couldnt boot it up. I dont know the message, but here comes the wierd. I restarted and tried to boot the computers OS. A message came up. something about a disk hardware configuration problem.

If someone has had the same problem or know what i should do. Please contact me! xion92@gmail.com"
,lightekk,2009-12-30T15:06Z,"thx, hope it will work, and where the hell u are? :D"
,L0ony,2009-12-30T16:43Z,"I downloaded it ... i instaled it in my hard drive.
Beautifull and working perfectly.

Tryed it on my UBM Hard drive... no good.
IT can be installed, but when it restarts to boot from de device it doesn´t. The screen goes black and freezes.

Even changing the priority for boot in BIOS it doesn´t work.

Maybe im doing something wrong, maybe my portable drive insn´t compatible, don´t know.

But for me ... it didnt work in USB device.

Thanks for this Good WXP32."

im in england

@l0ony

try a different USB Device, and try to use a USB HDD not a Flash Drive"
,project-mayhem,2009-12-31T16:50Z,"@l0ony

also, make sure you format your USB harddrive as NTFS but DO NOT do a quick format"
,LuxLOL,2010-01-01T14:38Z,Hacked version O_o What exactly do you have changed ? To install Windows on a USB Harddisk you don't need to change anything only you Motherboard needs to support USB Booting and you need to format you USB Harddisk in NTFS like all Harddisks and Quick Format works also without problems.
,project-mayhem,2010-01-03T02:52Z,"@LuxLOL

Actually no, the normal XP disk dosent allow installs to USB Devices lol"
,LuxLOL,2010-01-03T15:52Z,"MMM i had no problems to install Windows XP on a USB-HD but i see now also that i have a option in me BIOS called Simulate USB as Fixed Harddisk.

So can you say what you cangend so it works also wihtout this BIOS option ?"
,project-mayhem,2010-01-03T23:53Z,"hmm, your BIOS can simulate USB HDD as Internal, im impressed, never heard of it before.

anyway, i modified soom of the boot scripts to recognise and allow an install to USB Devices, thats all"
,LuxLOL,2010-01-04T00:50Z,Could you post the link to the tutorial i have now found 3 methods to do this but i want to find out what the best method is.
,macravin,2010-01-04T23:18Z,"heyy, I have 2 extra legit serials for windows xp home... If you make a v2, it would be great if you could have a home version 2 (having an illegitimate os is sooo annoying, I don't care if it is black edition, just having home on a usb would be great!) works well for me on my external HD. Wonder what you'll fix in v2... Thanks for the upload, glad that you got some more seeders :)"
,macravin,2010-01-06T00:08Z,"nvm, the crack is far too good, i'll stick with this!"
,project-mayhem,2010-01-07T21:07Z,"@LuxLOL

All you have to do, is burn to disk, turn of your computer, plug your usb drive in, put the disk in, turn the computer on, boot the disk, and then install onto your usb harddrive"
,macravin,2010-01-10T07:52Z,"@project-mayhem
Ha Ha, He means how do you HACK THE DISK, not install it, you already have instructions for that! :) 

Anyway, worked great on my WD Passport, only thing was, it coppied the boot.ini and the \ntldr to my main hd, so I couldn't boot off of any computer but my own. If you copy the files, then the mbr still is not there, but you can go into the recov. console and type ""fixmbr \Device\Hardisk1\Partition1"" (assuming that it is the only ext. hd plugged in, and that windows is installed on partition, but now I can boot from anywhere!! "
,ExpDV,2010-01-17T13:07Z,"Dear Project-Mayhem, This is indeed a fine piece of work!  I installed it as instructed and it worked, in that I can now boot from USB into Windows XP.  However, my Windows 7 laptop will not restart and boot into Windows 7 as normal when the USB drive has been unplugged, it only boots up into USB when it is plugged in.  Any ideas on a fix for this?  Regards."
,Slieka,2010-01-17T16:12Z,"Hi friends! Please dont download this shit, because nothing works... and its not alow much programs be instaled... 

P.S I never download your shits bich!
I hope you died very soon!!!"
,ExpDV,2010-01-19T00:31Z,"Hi, my experience is that it partially works, but it only boots into Windows XP from USB and fails to boot as normal into Windows 7 when the USB drive is disconnected.  When I repaired the Windows 7 boot, it disabled the Windows XP boot from USB.  So, I can get normal boot OR USB boot to work but not both.  Any ideas anyone?"
,TREEHORN12,2010-01-20T05:47Z,"@ExpDV

Create a disk partition and try booting out of that. (Same way I run Ubuntu and Windows Vista)"
,scythe8808,2010-02-10T08:48Z,"@ExpDV

I had the same problem, but what was your solution?

I try to boot back onto my Win7 after removing the flash drive but I get this error - ""windows could not start because of a computer disk hardware configuration problem..."""
,comerith,2010-03-07T09:00Z,"Thanks for the torrent. Hope it works for me, as I'm trying to resurrect an old laptop with a dead DVD drive. Looking forward to this little adventure after work today, should be coolly fun. Thanks again. "

,minxkitty8,2010-08-10T00:23Z,"Idk if this wud solve ur problem, but taking the hardrive out helps me when i install an os to a usb."
,computergeek12,2011-05-16T05:17Z,"hacked for usb? i think not. it takes an idiot with a quarter of a brain to do this. its pretty simple: try googling WinToFlash. FlashBoot. PeToUSB. And i'm not trying to put down your work, project-mayhem. i mean this is quite useful. but still, come on now. i wouldn't really call this ""hacking""... Just saying. basically you can make any flash drive bootable with the aforementioned programs, and then choose another flash drive or even that same flash drive (not sure, haven't really tried that before, actually) as the install destination. easy as cake. so for any of you people that this isn't working, i'll upload a bootable version of xp black edition (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6393221/Windows_XP_Professional_32-bit_en-US_-_Black_Edition_v2011.5.14 - credit goes to LuxLOL) or you can just download it yourself and use wintoflash to make the flash drive bootable. 
and no offense inteded, project-mayhem."
