                 Single by Ludacris featuring Shawnna and Lil Fate

                             from the album Chicken-n-Beer


        "P-Poppin'" is a single from Ludacris's fourth album Chicken-n-Beer. It features Shawnna and Lil Fate. The song samples "Danger (Been So Long)" by Mystikal, and is focused around what goes on in a high class strip club and a form of dance that can be done with or without clothes.

  The explicit version of the music video was not shown on MTV or BET because it was so erotic,and there were several scenes of naked women. The word Pussy Poppin' was replaced with Booty Poppin' to make the lyrics less explicit. Some of the women held very sexual poses exposing their vaginal area and Ludacris is seen smacking their backside.

  The Uncut version BET and MTV showed only allowed the word pussy poppin to be said but the women were blurred, however the video was still more explicit than the Tip Drill video. The song received limited airplay due to its lyrics.

                               ***Pussy Poppin.***
