how can i save my file??????"
,Fudge0952,2011-01-16T05:59Z,"@deathdie:
What I did is that I extracted the game out of the exe, the Launch.bat file will run the game for you.
This will be the only way you'll be able to save your game.
Once you've done that, run 'psxfin.exe'
Then from the Menu: File->Configuration
Then open the Memory Cards tab.
After the 'Slot 1' text, press the top '...' button.
Navigate to the 'cards' directory (same folder as psxfin.exe).
Then in the file name, type what the name of the memory card will be.
Then press Open.
Now press ok, and your memory card will be created.
Close 'psxfin.exe' then run 'Launch.bat' (NOTE: you will always have to run this file to play V8 2nd Offence)
When the game is loaded go to (and this is in the game): Options (then menu will fly away).
Then go down to Memory Card, and select it, select Memory Card 1.
Select an Empty Slot and press Save.
Type a name, and then you're done.

Hope this helps.

,rsuerte,2011-06-14T14:29Z,I uploaded the game and was lost during the process of launching the game. Can you be more with the steps of launching this game? Or does it really take one a programmer just to play this one?

,Jacquibim,2012-04-27T20:53Z,"Hey man, thanks for the game, but I've a got an issue.

I extracted the files and placed the .dll in my windows folder but when I launch the game, it just goes to the activism Logo and then nothing happens.

I'm a little confused by what you mean when you say the launch.bat will run the game. I can't actually find said file, was it meant to be included in the torrent, or...?"
