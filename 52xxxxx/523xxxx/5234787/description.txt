SalÃ² o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (SalÃ² or the 120 Days of Sodom), commonly referred to as SalÃ², is a controversial 1975 Italian film written and directed by Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini with uncredited writing contributions by Pupi Avati. It is based on the book The 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade. Because of its scenes depicting intensely graphic violence, sadism, and sexual depravity, the movie was extremely controversial upon its release, and remains banned in several countries to this day. It was Pasolini's last film; he was murdered shortly before SalÃ² was released. 
The film focuses on four wealthy, corrupted fascist libertines in 1944 Mussolini's Italy who kidnap a total of eighteen teenage boys and girls and subject them to four months of extreme violence, sadism, sexual and mental torture before finally executing them one by one. The film is noted for exploring the themes of political corruption, abuse of power, sadism, perversion, sexuality, and fascism. 
Although it remains a controversial film to this day, it has been praised by various film historians and critics, and while not typically considered a horror film, SalÃ² was named the 65th scariest film ever made by the Chicago Film Critics Association in 2006.
