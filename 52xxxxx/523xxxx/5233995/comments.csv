,XxM24Ty,2011-07-15T12:13Z,"The Chronic came out before this, in the early 1990's. A pot leaf does not make this album The Chonic.

Also why not rip in FLAC and allow us to choose to up or down convert? Flac rules, too bad Apple onlu uses Apple lossless which is no better than Flac."
,TheExponentiel,2011-08-18T14:47Z,"the thing is that uploader prefere the mp3 version cause the total size is smaller. You take a shoot to the album and if you like.. you buy.. are you?? anyways dont put those kind of comment its the choice of the uploader. If you want quality thenyou dont purchase on pirate bay ;D

but i agree that flac is bettter then mp3 !!!"
