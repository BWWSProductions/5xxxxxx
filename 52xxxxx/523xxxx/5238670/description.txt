The visionary behind the hit-making British house team M People is Mike
Pickering (b. March 1958; Manchester), a respected DJ who played in
Quando Quango, booked several early shows by the Smiths, and signed
Happy Mondays and James to Factory Records while working A&R
during the mid-'80s. Pickering later moved from Factory to the dance
label Deconstruction, where he signed acts in addition to recording
material with his own band, T-Coy. He formed M People in 1990 with
Heather Small (b. Jan. 20, 1965; London) and former Orange Juice
member Paul Heard (b. Oct. 5, 1960; London).

The group signed to DeConstruction in 1991, and released the single
"Colour My Life" that May. Second single "How Can I Love You More,"
propelled by Small's deep soul vocals, became a U.K. hit and spawned
the 1992 album Northern Soul. Later that year M People issued the remix
work Northern Soul Extended, and then began a blockbuster 1993 with
"Movin' on Up." The album Elegant Slumming was also a hit, earning the
group a BRIT award as Best UK Dance Act. The following year, Bizarre
Fruit continued M People's success, and was followed in 1997 by Fresco.
During the next two years, a pair of collections appeared: Classic M
