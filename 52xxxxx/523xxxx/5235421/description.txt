So 2009 is coming to an end... It's been a lot of fun sharing these with you guys and I'm looking even more forward to 2010. I hope you guys enjoy the Best of Playlist. I know I'll probably get a lot of questions like (Why wasn't [Band] Included?) Well as you guys can imagine narrowing 1000+ songs to 145 was no easy task, and well I probably didn't like that song as much as you. :P All that aside, hope you guys enjoy it and have a happy new year. :)
Also there are new T-shirts and Hoodies up at www.BlalocksIRP.com. Take a look at them and if you like them and feel like supporting the website then please do. Its all very much appreciated!!

Also, as some of you guys know, things got a bit hectic and I wasn't able to send out all the CD's back to some of you guys who sent me a mix. Please send me an email and I'll get to that promptly. (Still have all the envelopes for return address) On that note, I'm still up for trading mixes so if anyone would like to do so, please send me an email at joshblalock@gmail.com and I'll send you my address. Same goes for any bands who'd like to send a demo or album for consideration. Please email me and I'll send my address.

Much thanks goes out to everyone who has helped throughout all this year since criznittle wasn't able to continue them. A lot of things that have happened over the course of the year wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for you guys. (Website for example.)

Much Much Thanks goes out to:
Rene, Ag3mo, Dakradha, Indie69, Samicze, Outroversion, RebJukebox, Whipple, DigitalLove, Hellothere, Prateek, droenn, Kayla Clarke, Fentiger, cami_019, readthefollowing
