Tribal Ink - Refugee

Lyrics:

In fear i'm drowning
As my heart keeps pounding
Striking ones step
To hold on to what's left
Hold on, to the strings of reality
Bouncing on my heel of prosperity
Me and myself with a gleam in my eye
Watching it all wash by, watching me die
So hard to see it all fall through
But it's too late nothing left to do

Refugee, I'm an enemy of your belief
Don't hate me, because i disagree

Release me from a world unkind
A world where the blind is leading the blind
It's so unfair that i can't feel free
That i have to be what you want me to be
Shadows of the past keep stabbing my back
Reminding me of when i slipped out of track
Your wasteing your time, another morning dawning
And time when the restless keeps on joining

Refugee, I'm an enemy of your belief
Don't hate me, because i disagree
Refugee, I'm an enemy of your belief
Don't hate me, because i disagree

(Whaaaaaaaaaa!)
Refugee, I'm an enemy of your belief
Don't hate me, because i disagree
Refugee, I'm an enemy of your belief
Don't hate me, because i disagree
