Quick, take your computer back to the shop for a refund. Anyone who has any faith whatsoever in a Symantec product, obviously doesn't deserve to have a computer in their possession."

,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-02-14T13:19Z,"Thanks for the upload but before downloading I did research on the software and if you read the reviews there's a lot of problems with this. Check it on on TopTenReviews. I'm trying to find something better than what I usually use, DVDFab."

,jv_kenshin416,2010-02-25T21:16Z,My Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 detected a malware. It's the crack file in this torrent. Might be a false positive. 
,dangel12,2010-03-05T06:13Z,Winrar told me that it could not execute when I tried to unpack the crack file. any thoughts?

,MyNipple,2010-08-27T14:33Z,Sorry Its probably my loss but norton said it has a virus. Ive never had it say this about anything from a skull and bones. could be great but sorry kid im a kentucky fry chicken.
,piratriot,2010-09-02T20:51Z,NODE32 threw a warning on the crack. Deleted the file straight away. Possible trojan. I don't get many false positives with NOD32. Someone needs to run this through virus total or something.
,spotopneedslovin,2010-10-02T03:42Z,"@Sheboink
I know it was a while ago. But you just made me laugh. "
,csg0100,2010-10-05T19:44Z,"smh.......to all the noobs out there, most ALL Cracks register as a Trojan if u use Norton! it won't harm your computer!"
,reallybigrocket,2010-10-09T16:55Z,"@buckeyenutt

You simply copy and paste that crack file, you don't try and open it... read the fucking NFO"
