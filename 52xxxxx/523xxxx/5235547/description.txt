On a beautiful California Christmas Day, the Merriman family
celebration is interrupted by massacre and eight-year old son Devin
walks out of the house with a blood-covered knife.

Now, 15 years after little Devin brutally murdered his father and the
family housekeeper, he escapes the sanitarium where he has been
locked away with only one thing on his mind - another bloody
Christmas!

Produced by David Sterling for horror fans that long for the slasher
films of the '80 such as Friday the 13th, Silent Night Deadly Night,
Don't Open Till X-Mas, or Christmas Evil comes the scariest slasher
film of all - Deadly Little Christmas!
