,wtfwtf222,2010-01-02T01:12Z,thanks man. hm do we need to register or whatnot?
,nceylonz,2010-01-02T13:20Z,"There is a key generation included in the installation process. Just click through it and confirm the defaults provided for you (Licensee, Number of seats). Works like a charm. "
,redox1,2011-01-20T09:55Z,"Why would you upload this anonymously and compile it into a single exe that requires complete access to you system to install?
kinda sus"
,hahalolfailmupp,2011-02-07T16:43Z,"I've used this several times.

The exe isn't that hard to reverse/disassemble, just dl another ""safe"" version or OllyDbg then check what the base exe does. Or you can install it on a VM/Sandbox to be sure."
,shdwtrp,2011-05-18T01:32Z,The decompiler doesn't work.
