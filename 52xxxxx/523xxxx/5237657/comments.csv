What a waste of time!

4.36 gigs for a ""1953"" cartoon.

2 Lions Team got pretty dumb here, they've put 2003 which is the live action Peter Pan.

This is 1953 Cartoon everyone. Don't be fooled as I was people.

Can't believe I'm the first to call out such a blunder, Thanks for wasting my time 2 Lions!

Nice and small, only once in the description it says animation.  I missed it as most people would....

Your people rock!"
,Sector7g,2011-02-06T22:25Z,Dude you are pretty dumb. If you read the description is says both at the top and at the bottom that it is animation. The reason it is so large is because it is the 50th anniversary release. Great upload. Works perfect. Thanks

I don't know who is dump here but as a matter of fact 2003 is plain wrong since this should be corrected to 1953 of course!

Complaining about the size (like altern822) of course is a joke too... People should be happy to have some uploaders willing to share instead of complaining. For this I agree that altern822 is dump!  :P You can only dl a little part (as I did) and test to see if it's what you are expecting. That is the professional way with public torrents...

Anyway I stopped the dl after the first main vob because *** THERE IS NO FRENCH AUDIO *** in there so this is the second wrong statement of rocco64 / 2Lions-Team here !! It sucks, sorry to say (my children were really upset this evening).  :/"

Maybe you should just buy shit from the shop.
And give the proper education to your crying kids about downloading.

Everybody knows how to complain about everything, but they never put something online here.

Just read the description, and not only the title!
2lions-team delivers great work! so keep it up you guys!

GREAT MOVIE!!"
