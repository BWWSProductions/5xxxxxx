The Empire of Reason

Physicist Jameel Al-Khalili takes a personal journey into a largely forgotten era, travelling through Syria, Iran, Tunisia and Spain to tell of the great leap in scientific knowledge that took place in the Islamic world between the 8th and 14th centuries CE.

A thousand years ago, the astronomer and mathematician Al-Biruni estimated the size of the earth to within a few hundred miles. Medieval Islamic scholars helped turn the magical and occult practice of alchemy into modern chemistry. And physicist Ibn al-Haytham helped establish the modern science of optics. Jameel Al-Khalili argues that these scholars are among the first to insist that all scientific theories are backed up by careful experimental observation, bringing a rigour to science that didn't exist before.
