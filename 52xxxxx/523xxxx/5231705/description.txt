The Boxer (2009)  All Ben Wilson (Joshua Dallas, The Descent 2) wants is to be a better man. So when he hooks up with Joe Miller (Stacy Keach, TVâ€™s Prison Break), a cantankerous old boxing trainer, he finally gets his chance. Preparing for a title-qualifying bout against The Butcher â€” the sadistic bully who once nearly crippled him â€” Ben hopes to win fame, fortune and the girl he loves. For in todayâ€™s world, thereâ€™s only one way to get what you really want: youâ€™ve got to fight for it!

A boxing ex-con attempts to become a better person by enlisting a cantankerous trainer to prepare him for the fight of a lifetime. Like most people, Ben Wilson (Joshua Dallas) longs to live up to his true potential. That opportunity presents itself in the form of combative old trainer Joe Miller (Stacy Keach). Joe is just the kind of guy who can whip Ben into shape in time for a title-qualifying bout against the dreaded Butcher - a powerful pugilist who nearly crippled him in a previous fight. When the night of the big match arrives, Ben steps into the ring prepared to fight for fame, fortune, and the love of a beautiful woman.
