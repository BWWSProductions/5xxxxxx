,suuunly,2010-01-06T00:09Z,"Sorry if this is a stupid question.... But I need to be 100% sure :D


-is this and original Windows 7 edition?
(like an .ISO rip)

-or is it a mix between Win 7 & Vista?
(like something you guys at ""Win7Vista"" have made/created?)


I would really like to get an answer as fast as possible :D

Thanks you very much for your upcoming response :D "

,Driftingnfsc3,2010-01-25T19:51Z,"Just a little question cause, when ever i download windows 7 ultimate x64 bit, and they say i can update it, my computer starting getting BSOD's. so:

1) is it STABLE with the activation? (had the same problem with vista)

2) will updates make it unstable?"
