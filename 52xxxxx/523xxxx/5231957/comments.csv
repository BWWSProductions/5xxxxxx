I haven't been doing my job uploading weekly like I have in the past, but there are others who are carrying the torch now, and life seems to be encroaching more and more into the uploading of C2C torrents. Well anyway, here are the last twenty broadcasts for you all to download, SEED, and Enjoy! Thanks as always..... Stokeman Out....."
