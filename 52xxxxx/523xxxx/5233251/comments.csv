Thanks for the upload GoodFilms.  Keep up the good work!  All of us need you to stick around, especially since jonny has left us."
[V],GoodFilms,2009-12-21T20:12Z,"As is clearly stated, this is the alternate cut."
,MrVicVega,2009-12-21T22:08Z,"Do you recommend seeing this or the normal movie first?

Thank you for the upload. "
[V],GoodFilms,2009-12-21T22:28Z,Not seen either.
,xXWinchesterXx,2009-12-22T02:15Z,"Thank's man, Im from Brazil...nice"
,bharatrn,2009-12-22T17:42Z,But it says 99 mins for the alternate cut in imdb?
,justin131,2009-12-23T06:37Z,"The REFiNED release has the theatrical ending (3rd cut/spielberg).

This has the original ending (1st cut/directors cut).

The ending everyone saw on the screener (2nd cut) was made because the 1 time the directors cut was shown, audiences didnt like it.

There are 3 cuts total.

The 2nd cut from the screener was not included with the studio dvd/bluray release."

,DivotDogg,2010-02-09T01:16Z,"This rip seems to have file corruption.  The video is very choppy and freezes frequently.  The audio is out of sync and levels are too low.  I tried viewing this with DIVX and also with VLC.  Other movies work fine but this one has big problems.

,LD4WG,2010-11-26T13:39Z,"There are 3 endings, which one is it? Suicide, Micha throw or rocking?"
