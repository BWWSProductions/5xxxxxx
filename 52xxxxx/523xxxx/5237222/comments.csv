,waringin,2010-03-29T22:40Z,"you´re right, only the first four tracks are actually bluegrass pickin´on PF, the rest is loud rock music (I definitely wouldn´t call it Jethro Tull)
Mistake by CanadaJoe I guess"
,HectorQ,2010-04-24T00:15Z,"I confirm a couple of tracks have some rock over it. Not Jethro Tull, but Strutter, Deuce and other songs by KISS."
[V],CanadaJoe,2010-06-25T15:44Z,"All I can do is listen to the tracks to make sure they play properly, I'm not familiar enough with the artists' work to judge whether they are tagged correctly.
You guys have the easy part, if you don't like the music just delete from you HDD. I gotta listen to every track....  =("
