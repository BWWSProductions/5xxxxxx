     Plot Summary
==================================================================================
[http://getfansub.com/wiki/Toradora]

Based on a light novel series by Yuyuko Takemiya, illustrated by Yasu.

Toradora!'s story begins with the male protagonist Ryuuji Takasu who is frustrated at trying to improve his look as he enters his second year of high school. Despite his gentle personality, he has a natural outer-appearance which makes him look like an intimidating delinquent so he is utterly hopeless about his chances of getting a girlfriend anytime soon, and does not have many close friends either. After being greeted by his hungover mother in the morning, Ryuuji goes to school and finds out that he is in the same class as his best friend Yuusaku Kitamura. But what makes him extremely happy is that he gets to be in the same class as his crush Minori Kushieda. However, it is then that he unexpectedly knocks into "the creature ranked most dangerous in the school" â€” Taiga Aisaka â€”, who goes by the nickname "Palmtop Tiger" and who just happens to also be in his class.

Taiga has a negative attitude towards others and will not hesitate to snap at people. After a series of misunderstandings between Ryuuji and Taiga, Ryuuji is taken in by Taiga as her personal servant. Taiga had moved out to live on her own due to family issues and isn't able to do any housechores. After discovering the state of her apartment Ryuuji, who has a real talent at domestic chores, decided to do all of her housechores. Taiga spends a lot of her time over at his house, so much so that she could almost be considered a member of his family. Since Ryuuji spends a lot of time with Taiga, he is opened up to her world and to a side of her that most people do not see. The two also attempt to help each other in order to improve their relationship with their crush (Taiga has a crush on Ryuuji's best friend, Yuusaku, and Ryuuji has a crush on Taiga's best friend, Minori). Unknown to them, however, people they know from school start to become curious about their strange relationship together and rumors begin to spread about them.
