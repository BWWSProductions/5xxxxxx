,mvictorinox,2010-05-02T01:59Z,"Thanks for this great rip.  The quality of the picture and sound are very important for these three movies.

Zen Bud, from what source did you rip this from?  I'm not aware of these movies being released on anything other than DVD."
[V],Zen_Bud,2010-05-04T19:05Z,"@mvictorinox I am glad you like this :). The source is DVD9 , and i use Handbrake[http://handbrake.fr/] for the rip.  "
,jclub,2010-05-16T10:20Z,"Tried watching the movies on WD TV. Be warned; the subs consists of a black outline only, making it impossible to read when on a dark background.

But thanks for the upload!"
[V],Zen_Bud,2010-05-16T19:02Z,@jclub..There is nothing wrong with the sub! And i don´t know what´s wrong with the hardware! Have you tried vlc [http://www.videolan.org/vlc/] . Good luck and i hope you will see this good flick´s :o)
