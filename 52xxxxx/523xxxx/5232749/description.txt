THIS IS A LOW QUALITY RIP OF A FREE CD RECIEVED AT A FESTIVAL FEATURING DJ PULSAR.

I received this rip off a friend, and although it works flawlessly on WMP and iTunes, I cannot guarantee the quality for everyone interested in downloading. The bitrate is VBR, all files are .mp4 (originally .m4a). This CD is a promotional compilation featuring a number of Pulsar's most prominent tracks - aptly named 'Daydreams'.
