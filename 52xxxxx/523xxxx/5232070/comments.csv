,kitkat12,2009-12-28T16:39Z,"hey guys!! Great game and Im going to seed it for week because I dont want to be some fuckin shit, who downloaded it, played it but doesnt seed it!"
,kitkat12,2009-12-28T16:58Z,can anyone tell me how to change a resolution???
,fallenael08,2009-12-29T02:32Z,i'm done downloading.. is there anyway to change the resolution? it's currently unplayable right now because of it. thanks.
,kitkat12,2009-12-29T09:25Z,"yo! now i know how to change a resolution!!! first you klik down from ""new game"" 3 times then klik enter, it will enter to the option menu. At option menu chose the second one, it start by ""V"" like Video option cause someone has widescreen display so you can see only ""V"". Enter that and you can the the option for your resolution but for the esier way, at the ""Aspect Ratio"" klik one time arrows key to the left or to the right, then klik arrow key up then enter and it will change your resolution to widescreen then you can change resolution to 1208x800. Sorry but my english its not very well :D"
,fallenael08,2009-12-29T13:09Z,thank you so much kitkat12. it really helped alot!!!
,kitkat12,2009-12-29T16:48Z,no prob dude! Im happy to help others!
,ras_yo,2009-12-30T21:54Z,"Thanks eksilimon, but it doesnt work correctly. Whenthe game starts it changes resolution and i can see only a part of the game-window, so i cannot see the whole menu. Does anybody else have this problem?  Is there anything i can do to fix this?"
,kitkat12,2009-12-30T22:29Z,ras_yo : just do like what i wrote before and then you can play it in widescreen mode!!
,fallenael08,2009-12-31T11:34Z,"yup, it works, just do what kitkat12 said. anyways, does anyone of you experience the screen going black after a spirit talks to you?mine does. i have to restart the program for it to show."
,kitkat12,2009-12-31T17:23Z,"for the black screen problem, just turn of ""frame buffer effects"" in the video option then your game will work perfect!!! "
,David1125,2010-01-27T17:54Z,"Unable to change resolutions.  Kitkat12 help didn't seem to work since the pointer would not go beyond the ""V"" part (the right side of the screen where the resolutions are).  Anyways I found a better solution.  Just open the jade empire.ini file and change the resolution manually.  By the way, Who on earth used a resolution of 1400x900 that is saved on the image .ini file?  This is a very uncommon resolution I've ever seen."
,Eejay.Jauregg,2010-05-14T04:31Z,"pls seed somebody! i'm only at 6% and get almost no activity.
played this game when it was released on xbox and it rocks! can't wait!"
,Eejay.Jauregg,2010-05-18T13:12Z,"managed to change resolution, you can do that with the keyboard only.
had the black screen problem too (when switching into focus-mode), disabling ""frame buffer effects"" fixed that."
,utron11,2010-06-11T10:03Z,where is seeders? This torrent looks like dead right now
,gregolgratis,2010-08-23T10:48Z,seed please... 96%
,ragdoll777,2010-09-08T22:01Z,"It's supposed to work on a OSX 10.4. but with me, it doesn't. I have the (minimum) specs, but it keeps telling me my version is too old. can anyone help me with this? (Other than upgrading)"
,Tyar_Varoo,2011-03-09T23:07Z,"Great torrent! Will seed as much as I can. I only had one problem with the configuration though, my resolution wasn't able to handle this thing, here's how I fixed it:

Changing the resolution:

Right click the app and choose ""show content"" (not sure what's it called in english, but to me it was the second option from the top) There you go into the folders: Contents - Resources - transgaming - c_drive - Program Files - Jade Empire

There you open JadeEmpire.ini with texteditor, scroll down till you find the resolutions (they are set to 1440x900) and set it to your own resolution.


This worked for me, I'm on 2560x1440"
