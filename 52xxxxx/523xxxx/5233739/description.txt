Extensive protection of sensitive data is important in a home environment, as well as in any other. ESET Smart Security 4 represents a complex security solution for computers, which was improved and optimized to provide superior performance and small footprint simultaneously. ESET Smart Security 4 is created by a symbiosis of previously known and newly added features. These advanced technologies in combination with ESETÂ´s famous Proactive Protection ensure comprehensive protection against viruses, trojans, worms, adware, spyware, phishing, rootkits. In other words, ESET Smart Security 4 is the result of ESETÂ´s continuous quest for perfection in computer protection.

The four main modules (Antivirus, Antispyware, Personal Firewall and Anti-Spam) were optimized to provide even better integrated protection by maintaining a high level of performance and speed simultaneously.

Included is also ESETÂ´s famous Advanced Heuristics to protect from unknown threats and generic signatures for reliable detection of mutations of known viruses. ThreatSenseÂ® and ThreatSenseÂ®.NET technology minimize the vulnerability window after the virus outbreak and make the smart detection concept of ESET complete.

Main modules 

    * Antivirus
    * Antispyware
    * Personal Firewall
    * Antispam

 
Other technologies

 
ThreatSenseÂ®

Traditional, signature-based security solutions only react to known threats. The problem is that signature based solutions can only detect known attacks with identification signatures that need to be available in the usersâ€˜ system at the time of the attack, which often takes a few hours. With the speed the new malware can spread today, the risk that you become a victim of a new, so far unknown infiltration is too real. The solution of ESET is based upon the unique ThreatSenseÂ® technology utilizing a new generation of advanced heuristics. This technology offers proactive protection against newest infiltrations in the early hours of their spreading, while the experts in ESETâ€™s labs work on creating of a new signature which is to be added to the virus signatures database of NOD32.

    * Anti-Stealth technology against rootkits
    * Protection against phishing attacks
    * SysInspector
