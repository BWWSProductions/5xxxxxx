[T],jmb2012,2009-12-24T02:54Z,this is what i use and how i use it
,fuwad84,2009-12-24T06:10Z,"Ditto---> http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5176467

In all fairness however, I do want to thank you for all your hardwork and the other shit you do contribute on TPB. So thanx for that...BUT YOUR STILL WRONG!!! jus this one time."
,awudu,2009-12-24T20:42Z,"fuwad84 is always hunting for jmb2012. fuwad84 why do you keep making such comments under people's torrent.s It's not polite you know. This is not your 1st time commenting like this under jmb2012's torrents.

I have downloaded and used the Nod32 V2.7 of yours and it works alright but the different between this and yours is that this has integrated firewall and that's why it's a smart security and yours is only anti virus."
,fuwad84,2009-12-25T02:28Z,"awudu,

number one. Because some of the best torrents on TPB are not necessarily the ones with the most seeds.

Number two. I'm an asshole

Number three. Thats cool if.  "
,TPBUROCK,2009-12-25T11:21Z,"Hello user i need this software [ dbForge Studio for MySQL Professional ] Please Upload it soon with crack...
Please , Please  Please"
[T],FatFreddy69,2009-12-25T11:56Z,"many many thx jmb2012

I've tried some of your appl-s and they all worked perfectly alright.

Isn't there a way to get rid of those agressive & rude (even insulting sometimes) users from thepiratebay?

I'm sick and tired of them, instead of being thankful and useful they are contra productive and rude. I also hate when they spam other's torrents with their own shit-link."

,damp550,2010-01-08T13:10Z,i downloaded your other torrent with just NOD32 (which works wonderful btw). and i just wonder if i start installing ESET smart security will it just add itself to nod32 or will this act as a program by it self
,d0a,2010-01-15T01:50Z,"The link for the username and password doesn't work it says the site has been moved, and when i click to go to the new site it says it's under maintenence...what should i do"

,meiskam,2010-01-19T05:39Z,"no crack, no keygen -- suggests we visit http://hhuu.net/ to use publicly listed keys that will probably soon be blacklisted

I vote this torrent 2 thumbs down."
[T],jmb2012,2010-01-19T19:02Z,"@meiskam

I use this method!! Works fine for me, no hassles and free eset for as long as I want.
Just as advertised."
,blackhackers,2010-01-21T00:37Z,hhuu.net is not effective anymore.. 
,meiskam,2010-01-27T05:28Z,"@jmb2012:
no hassles? The keys continue to expire, so I have to type in a new user:pass every time I want to update the virus def's."

And for your knowledge there are more trustfull sites with daily new pass and keys up to date [not yet blacklisted]... just google it the  right way..."
,djME27,2010-03-03T08:45Z,"@meiskam: or, you could just move on and pick a new torrent if you are too lazy to download one of the many cracks out there to crack it yourself, rather than bitching at the uploader.  Who didn't lie, and made it pretty clear that it has worked for him.  Not his fault people are too lazy to figure it out themselves."

,Goldenized,2012-03-29T09:28Z,"Thanks buddy for this torrent. Although I have to be looking for the keys everytime I want to update it, it is a nice torrent. 10/10
I love it cuz it includes the 32bit and 64bit version and I can install on any system."
