I found this tutorial onso I decided to upload it here, after days of downloading 21 200MB files from my Free User account. Just Un-Zip it with 7-Zip ( http://www.7-zip.org/ ) and run the Cubase5TutDVDL2. If it ask for a name just type in what you want and start it! 



Level 1 can be found here:

Happy Cubasing! :)
