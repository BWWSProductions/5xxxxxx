,johnnyathm1,2009-12-20T19:40Z,Not for this film...saw it at the IMAX in 3D...outstanding.
[T],despo1ler,2009-12-20T19:53Z,"I can believe it, I saw a TS  and CGI is incredible, to quote the guy in Bones, ""I can no longer see the difference between real life and special effects"". Good on the cinemas for battling piracy by offering something the internet cant and they I wouldn't be surprised if a lot more ppl will spend the money on going to see it in 3D after seeing the pirate copies that are available, not just incredible effects but  incredible story,writing,leverything. Best movie of the year in my book."
,johnnyathm1,2009-12-20T20:00Z,"@despo1ler

Agreed...My wife and I saw it together, she said it was the best movie she has ever seen. Thats a lot coming from her...she is TOUGH on movies. It was truly what I would call an ""experience"". Seeing it in 3D...not just 3D, a new kind of filming process for 3D, made that experience all that better."

,Miki2,2009-12-20T21:31Z,"Simple plot but in the hands of Cameron it becomes a masterpiece. I saw it in 3d yesterday and my, i want such rig at home!  :P
Simply awesome!"

,Bombardem,2009-12-20T23:10Z,"If you cant tell the CGI portions of the film from the real actor portions you are a fucking retard...gimme a break. I see very little difference between this and the films Zemeckis has been doing for 10 years now. Sure they've pushed the technology, but it still looks like a cartoon."
,jcord9194,2009-12-20T23:59Z,Anybody by chance wish to comment on the A/V?
,Toughy7,2009-12-21T02:49Z,"Just downloaded and watched for a couple minutes.

Audio is out of sync after just 5 minutes and the Video looks like COPS is protecting every ones Identity with mosaics.

A - 3
V - 4

Don't waste your time with this Russian piece of Shit. Not A TS. Thanks Uploader, for wasting my time."
,imagines,2009-12-21T06:06Z,"Better in 3-D would be the right term for a stereoscopic film, but whatevvvvva


I have seen it for REAL, and feel sorry for you poor people that has to download this crappy version..."
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2009-12-21T08:54Z,Some people are poor and can't afford to go out and see movies. Like me. But I think I might just waste some money on this one. I watched the version off here and it was decent. I can tell that this movie is worth seeing in the theaters.
,willywonka111111,2009-12-21T15:58Z,"Yeah - I love downloading free movies, but paying $32 for my wife and I to see it was worth it, truly amazing, find a 3d movie theatre near you and pay the money, it's worth it, and still cheaper than a night drinking out."
,Emonem,2009-12-24T22:19Z,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE MOVIETHEATERS IN 3D!!!!! IT'S SO GOOD WHEN I SAW IT IN THE BIO, JUST WATCH IT IN TEH THEATERS!!  NOT WORTH DOWNLOADING ITS TO GOOD!!!!"
,stangkill3r1980,2009-12-25T03:58Z,"you know my only fucking question is if they movie is spoken in english what fucking morron would put russian texted sub titles in the movie what fucking sence does that make i dont mind a free movie but this aint just a shitty cam job with a shitty cam its fucking english spoken with russian texted sub titles fucking morron if your gonna spend all that time uploading and all else thatgoes into post torrent why wouldnt you make the sub titles in the same lanuage that is being spoken i aint coming at 007's neck this goes out to every one wasting their own time to put a movie up on the site and not have it right cus this isnt the first time this has happened 
well its christmas eve and on that note fuck this and fuck you morrons i am going drinking "
,harower,2009-12-26T12:58Z,"Incase people haven't worked it out.  They have hired people to comment on torrent sites about how good this movie is and how it needs to be watched at the cinema first.  Every page of comments if full of there crap.

Considering how much this movie cost too make, I can't blame them."
,JYPD,2009-12-28T15:29Z,"@harower:
Sure.. And those ""hired people"" are also paid to upload movies :D
The movie is really good (and even better in 3d). Thats a fact. You have to live with it ^^"
,Breyvan,2009-12-30T05:25Z,"Find it funny that harower thinks people have been paid to get people to see this at the cinema - seriously they are not that sad :P

Yes ive seen it at the cinema, yes it was in 3D and yes I loved it, best film of the year and i still downloaded it off here (different torrent though) before i saw it at the cinema - i then went to see it at the cinema in 3D and the pirate versions of this film dont do it justice!

If youve seen it on the big screen and dont like it thats fine but if all youve done is watch a pirate version and dont like it - you havent even experienced the full effect this film has"
,dredre27,2009-12-31T06:28Z,"I saw this at the theater in 3d. Not yet watched any downloads. Excellent movie. I can't imagine anything will impress me as much in the next few months or so. Very well done. And I'm not one of the ""hired people"". Am a mod elsewhere, just not here. and this is a movie worth paying to see in 3d. I only wish someone could figure how to rip 3d screeners and put them on tpb - lol"
,Xris22,2009-12-31T17:34Z,"Just went to see it at cinema last night.  I'm English, but living in Sweden so the 'natural' subs were in Swedish - it didn't spoil my viewing in any way as the sub'd dialogs are quite short and if you're following the story (which everyone certainly was... edge of seats/breath held) you get the gist of what's being said anyway.

After having downloading this version (REALLY wanted to see it again! ^^) well...

There was little point telecaming the 3D version, because first you need the special Real3D glasses (not the green/red anamorphic type, this is some kind of offset polarisation version), and second, even with the glasses (brought mine home, of course!) it doesn't work ANYWAY!  So all we have here is polarised (blurred) below-average tele.

But...

GO SEE THE MOVIE!  It is frikkin totally AWESOME!  They've totally changed the way movies can be experienced.  It's NOTHING like the green/red anamorphic types.  I saw a flying plant land on some womans head in front of me, and we were sitting at the far back!

Go see it...."

but I saw this at the theater in 3d and it worth every cent...

,timbadd,2010-01-14T22:14Z,"parthbeyond - You can't, they haven't brought out technology to watch it from home yet, it's done digitally so you'd need to watch it on a special tv. They'll be bringing some out some point in the future.

stangkill3r1980 - hmm good point, i dont know maybe they were written for russian people?? Idiot."
,isisx3,2010-02-15T13:48Z,"Dear stangkill3r1980,

The world does not revolve around you and other English speaking ""morrons"" (as you like to spell it) like your self. I know that in your house in America it may seem like the rest of the world is pretty pointless but regardless of that there ARE other cultures who speak other languages who enjoy seeing movies just as much as you might or might not. You are exactly what is wrong with America and exactly the type of uncultured selfish and ignorant people who give Americans a bad name. Grow up, if you don't like that there are subs then download a different movie and keep your negative comments to your self."
,Umaiz108,2010-02-15T18:15Z,"You got to get those goggles to watch it in 3D.
I watched this movie in cinema in 3D display and they gave us goggles which i still have. It works awesome with that."

,scratch07,2010-02-28T00:43Z,"@ isisx3

You're right, that was an extremely arrogant comment made and there ARE too many people who think the world revolves around them. However, as an American I would like to point out that not everyone here is as ignorant as that guy. There will always be self-centered people like him mouthing off, but I hope you recognize that not all Americans reflect his opinions. Just because there's one idiot here doesn't mean you should hold it against all of us."
,ProphetZarquon,2010-03-02T20:04Z,"1)  This movie is only worth seeing in 3D.  The story is basically Fern Gully in space.  I mean every five minutes you are going ""Oh, they ripped this off from such-and-such.""  But the 3D effect is truly captivating.  There are a few eye-straining short-focus scenes, but it's by far the best 3D effects I've ever seen.

2)  When it releases on DVD/BluRay there should be an anaglyph (red/blue lens) version available.  You can watch that at home with no special equipment but the cardboard glasses.

3)  In the theatre they use polarized light filters, one direction over each eye, and two projectors.  You can spend $7000 buying a 52 inch LCD with polarized 3D built in, or do what I did and use two projectors converged (matching images), and put a $45 filter on each lens.  It works, but so far I have ONE film in that format:  UP.

:P  If anyone can produce an anaglyph OR polarized release, I'd greatly appreciate it.  For my setup, I require seperate Left and Right video tracks for polarized playback.  It's a pain...  Mostly I use it for CAD modeling."
,ProphetZarquon,2010-03-02T20:23Z,"P.S.:  3)  LOW quality video (and not in 3D of any type).  No mistaking a theatre screener here.  I'd say V:3 (expected for most screeners) A:6 (better than most), but basically only download this movie at all if you can't afford the theatre tickets, and you don't want to wait for a DVD rip."
,Naraku77,2010-03-29T02:25Z,"Xris22, I thought a polarized copy would play fine as well, but a friend told me it wouldn't, so I got doing some research.  Normal LCD's very functionality is provided by linear polarization.  I could waste a couple of paragraphs going over the technical details, but, basically, all light coming from conventional LCD is polarized in some linear direction (usually horizontally or vertically).  The effect would be destroyed before it even had a chance.  Needless to say, an LCD projector would do the same.  A DLP projector and a silver screen is most likely the only way you could play a TS of the polarized film and have it look right (and it's still a long shot).

ProhetZarquon, thanks for saving me the trouble of grabbing this by telling me it's not polarized.  Clearly, this isn't the waste of time that I'm looking for.  Minor correction to point 3, RealD actually uses an alternating frames method via a single projector and a liquid crystal filter that reverses it's polarity every frame.  Sadly, instead of copying RealD's method, the $7000 TV uses interlacing, which cuts the vertical resolution in half.  Which makes the method you're using the best that is currently available (but it's hard to find movies in that format, as you've observed).  However, regarding point 2, the only 3D release they're planning is a 3D Blu-Ray for 3D TVs (the thought of anaglyphing this movie probably makes Cameron sick to his stomach, and rightfully so, it would be pure butchery).  Hopefully the glasses-free 3D TVs won't cost too much when they come out.  I'd rather buy an HMD than get one of those active glasses setups (I'd be watching it alone either way, those glasses cost too much, but the HMD is flicker free and you can add a head tracker to it for full VR at least)."

I have the complete 3D setup with shutter glasses. I will test this using stereoscopic player and post back for others. I have been playing PC video games and a rare selected amount of movies in 3D using these glasses on a Samsung HLT6176S using a custom built HTPC using a Q9550 OCed to 4 ghz with two gts250s in SLI. I look forward to 3D content as the only HD3D stuff I can view is video games. I'm sure I'll have this soon and be posting back. 
kris812 at 2010-04-25 06:52 CET: 

I would also like to add for others that a 120hz tv is needed for using shutterglasses effectivly providing 60hz per each eye. Shutter glasses is truely the only economical way to provide 3D at home. Polorized glasses requires dual projecters and circular lenes on a silver plated screen (imax uses this method and causes eye blurring). There are also dual panel IZ3D lcd panels but the effect is only at one viewing point. The glasses I use are ""terminator glasses"" and I got them for about 40 bucks a pair. Nothing cool looking but I first used them 10 years ago on a PC. My new HDTV was bought due to being ""3D ready"" and I decided to try it out and built a monster HTPC that will do 120fps on Crysis on HIGH settings at 1080p. WOW is all I can say, I'm very glad I went DLP.. 
kris812 at 2010-04-25 07:02 CET: 

Profet... I would like to say the realD uses shutterglasses.. Harkins theaters use this method and their red realD 3d glasses are about 100 USD a pair, explaining why they keep real close tabs on them. Shutter glasses alow you to seperate two interlaced images on your screen to each different eye useing LCD's that you look through synced up to your tv.. Yes you can make your own 3D movies or images using dual cameras/dual camcorders but you CANNOT use that setup in the theater to capture the 3D unless the shutter glasses were fitted onto the cameras.. If not the image would be the same on both recorded content (blurred as your seeing both images in both eyes).. Truely the only way to get 3D content at this time 04.10 is pc generated graphics allowing dual perspecives to be rendered (requiring masive power for HD) or to be captured and recorded as left and right images and remixed on your local machine synced to your glasses.. 
kris812 at 2010-04-25 07:08 CET: 

OH and FYI as far as price goes I paid 1.5k for TV 2 years ago, and 1.5k for the (pc parts only I built), 120 bucks for 3 glasses... Anlagraph just straight up sucks, gives me a headache quick.. This setup is 100% Harkins quality along with 7.1 audio.. All in all these 7k esimates are far off as to what is needed for a 5 foot 3D tv.. 1k for a tv (now i would assume for a DLP) and a PS3 which is going to have a software upgrade for 3D sometime soon.. I hate playstations over xboxs but for the 3D ill get both.. sorry xbox lovers I'm with ya.. "
,bashprompt,2010-07-04T19:28Z,"The quality of this is amazingly low, I'd rate visuals 1/10, also there is no 3D aspect to this on the grounds that the image is so low and grainy that you couldn't possibly percieve 3D. A film of this quality at 1:1 ratio would be about 90 megs, but the uploader has left this uncompressed at grainy quality as recorded by their camera, leaving you with a giant file that is of inferior quality."
