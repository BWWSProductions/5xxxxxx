Also, if this is a re-encode of Chotab's release, throw it away and avoid this download.  Chotab's releases has frame drops, and had it been a scene group, would have been nuked.

go for Family.Guy.Something.Something.Dark.Side.720p.BluRay.x264-OEM.  It may not have commentary track, but the video is perfect."
