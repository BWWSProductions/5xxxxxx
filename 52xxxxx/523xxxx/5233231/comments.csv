I did see it in 3d. It was a very singular experience; that of being presbyopic in the jungle for an hour and a half. Then the big guns came along for another hour and I after that was left staring at the credits, wholly disappointed. I'd like to verify whether this actually has worth as a movie because my cinematic experience completely sucked."

,stangkill3r1980,2009-12-25T04:11Z,oh and 007 your description of the movie clearly says it has english subs maybe you should put down the joint and post some fucking facts 
,harower,2009-12-26T12:57Z,"Incase people haven't worked it out.  They have hired people to comment on torrent sites about how good this movie is and how it needs to be watched at the cinema first.  Every page of comments if full of there crap.

Considering how much this movie cost too make, I can't blame them."
,mdw666,2010-01-14T06:52Z,"@stangkill3r1980 in case you never saw it in the theater, the subs on it are actually IN the movie. They aren't ""added"" This is obviously a cam shot from Russia (at least it looks russian) which is why the subs look like they do."
