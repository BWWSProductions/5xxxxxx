,griiid,2009-12-20T23:16Z,thanks dude!
,ektakrome,2009-12-21T19:28Z,So they finally decided to have Button on there. I guess if he hadn't won the championship F1 then they still wouldn't have cared enough to have him on. Being that he's a brit and he's been driving F1 for a good long time now.
,chaz_stutch,2009-12-22T00:44Z,@ektakrome what are you on about? They've had him on before you tit. This is his 2nd time hence why he already had a lap time on the F! drivers board.....again you tit.
,weej2008,2009-12-22T02:23Z,i agree with chaz_stutch that ektakrome you are a big fat tit face ha ha for being such a tit but thx anyway for top gear love the show :D
