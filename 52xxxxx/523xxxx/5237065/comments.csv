Merry Xmas Y'all"

If you could do the same for all that old stuff (70's, 80's, 90's etc) that would safe even more time."

It would save you some time yes, but would create a lot more work for me, so no."
,iycgtptyarvg,2009-12-27T13:49Z,"Yes, true. I was just thinking that if you do it once, it saves the 1000s of us doing it over and over again.

Anyway, your releases are highly appreciated. Thank you."
