Nonetheless, this is the only torrent of Dark City in high res. Keep seeding people. I'll seed when I finish. And thanks to IcySon55. Good work!

PS

If anyone out there has a 1080p rip of Dark City at a higher bitrate, then please upload. Thanks."

,IcySon55,2009-12-30T19:49Z,As I uploaded this mostly on a whim just to be helpful. I will no longer be seeding it. With over 100 seeds I'm sure you guys can keep it going for a long time.
