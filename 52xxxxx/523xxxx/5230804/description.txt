The Tolkien Ensemble (founded in 1995) is a Danish ensemble with the aim to create "the worlds first complete musical interpretation of the poems and songs from The Lord of the Rings". They published four CDs from 1997 to 2005 in which all the poems and songs of The Lord of the Rings are set to music. For the last 2 CDs, they managed to get Christopher Lee on board for some of the songs.
In 2006, they released a "The Lord of the Rings - The Complete Songs & Poems" collection with all the songs in cronological order, instead of spread around like it was on the original CDs. Many of the songs were also re-recorded with improved arrangements.
This collection also have a very nice 112 page booklet, with some background info, all the lyrics to the songs, AND with the famous illustrations made by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.


So this torrent include both my original 4 CD torrent (320kbit rip of the original Rivendell CDs), AND a new rip of the 4 Complete Songs & Poems CDs (also 320kbit).

I have chosen to NOT ruin my own copy of the booklet to scan it, and have instead included a few pictures from an earlier upload of the "Collected Songs & Poems" that i found once, unfortunately only encoded in 160kbit. So thanks to whoever originally ripped it for those 9 pictures :)

So if you wish to see the complete booklet, you should buy the collection, which is still available from Amazon, and other assorted retailers.



Feel free to post comments, i would love to hear what other people think of this. The original torrent had over 1325 completed downloads, and 30 comments, so hope to see at least the same number now :)


Just remember, these CDs are NOT mass produced junk like the latest pop CDs, its a niche product, so if you like it, buy it to support the artists.
