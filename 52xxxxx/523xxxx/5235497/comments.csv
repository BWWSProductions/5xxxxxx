According to demonoid it currently has 4 seeds and 3 leeches.
And even if those would stop seeding, i will always seed this torrent anytime that i am at home at dads place.
So if there are no seeds, just wait and i'll be seeding for you soon again.
I might even update the files on my laptop so that i can seed at moms place, too... sometimes. =)
And when school starts i'll also seed in school from my laptop on 100/100 internet sometimes unless the others in my class starts complaining about internet being slow. Then i might just pause it for a while.

But as i said, this torrent will not die, and i am always going to seed when i'm given the chance.
Silverstein ftw. peace out =)"
