,Dr@g0nz731,2009-12-22T05:40Z,"There is a reason torrents DON'T have RAR parts in them.. Torrents already automatically check for mismatched hash files. So don't part the RAR's for people. It's a waste of time, and effort."
[T],Jesper.sv,2009-12-22T08:09Z,Dr@g0nz731; Say what? The effort and waste of time would have been if i had to unrar before making a torrent.

You do realize it was split into rars by the release group for the non torrent methods of delivery they use to send their releases to each other or whomever. Don't complain just because this nice uploader did the sensible thing and just uploaded what they received without altering it at all. It's rared. Get over it.

Thanks uploader. I'm happy this is out. I'll comment on the quality when it's done."
,knighty92,2009-12-22T13:21Z,"justin is right.
uploaders put the file in several rar files because then they are allowed to send the file to whoever they want without it being illegal."
,justin131,2009-12-23T00:31Z,"Well this one is going pretty slow. But I have 6 other torrents on the go. I'm in no hurry but someone should post about the quality since it will be a while before I can. Also, someone should verify that it is indeed the theatrical ending.

I have no doubts it's legit and great quality though, REFiNED has never let me down. But verifying the contents of a torrent is what the comments are for.."
[V],LosslessDude,2009-12-23T21:52Z,Quality is PERFECT....  (remember a very low budget movie)
,justin131,2009-12-24T10:12Z,"This release has the theatrical ending (3rd cut/spielberg).

Paranormal.Activity.2007.ALTERNATE.CUT.720p.BluRay.x264-BestHD has the original ending (1st cut/directors cut).

The ending everyone saw on the screener (2nd cut) was made because the 1 time the directors cut was shown, the audience didnt like it.

There are 3 cuts total.

The 2nd cut from the screener was not included with the studio dvd/bluray release.

:)"
,Crossfire,2009-12-25T18:02Z,LOL RARS
,tmboyz,2009-12-27T03:22Z,"what a movie!! even if you're watching it with ten people in a darkened room, chances of you freaking out is very high. 

However, paranormal activity is not original, its a blatant, and almost frame by frame copy of Lake Mungo, the Aussie film. This Aussie movie is really really scary. I dare say, even better than Para. And without all the 1st cut, alternate cut, 3rd cut, directors cut, Spielberg cut crap. Clever marketing has done a real favour for PA. 

Para is good but do take a look at Lake mungo.

,caliwillbemine,2009-12-27T21:36Z,any 1080p yet ?
,carrollta2,2009-12-28T19:03Z,"Thanks for the upload!! Im downloading it now. Ok, So I have seen the one in theaters and Ive read this ending is different. What is yalls opinion on which ending is the best?"
,justin131,2009-12-31T04:22Z,"I've seen all the endings and the theatrical ending (this one) is by far the best. The throat ending is very dry and the police ending is kind of.. I don't know.. I guess her dying just makes it seem like it all led up to nothing.

Just my 2 cents."
,VonGroth,2010-01-02T01:22Z,Can't just some one rate the movie ? is it good or is it some shiti ass movie that's boores you out from the start untill the end
,darksniper88,2010-01-02T02:07Z,"As a horror movie i was really impressed,
usually i hate that genre couse it never get to me.


So i give the MOVIE 9/10 

Audio and video are as expected great,
tho i've heard that you should change your audio settings to stereo or something.

=)"
,P0g0,2010-01-03T10:26Z,"quality is perfect, worst movie ive seen this year though, anyone can tell me why all the fuss about it?"
,(o_0),2010-01-04T01:38Z,is this the one with the alternate ending?? cause the one in theaters sucked ass
,superman101,2010-01-04T05:32Z,"Audio: 10
Video: 10

No issues in that department. 

As to those complaining about having RARs involved: get over it. As someone much wiser and older then me once said, never look a gift horse in the mouth. Be glad you're getting this (and tons of other shit) for free. My hat goes off to Jesper.sv and anyone else who makes pirating possible. These people save me an ass-load of money so I keep my mouth shut about RARs or anything else just as minor and pointless...twenty more seconds to unrar doesn't kill anyone.

Thanks again Jesper.sv"

,yoncenator,2010-02-02T23:29Z,This is a fucking MKV file. GODDAMMIT who uses that shit? AND why don't you say that shit in the description! How the hell am I supposed to burn this?
,velkan_valerious,2010-02-20T18:50Z,theatrical ending!!!! Finally!  \o/
,lancid,2010-02-23T17:34Z,"The problem with rars is you need double the space when you want to watch the movie. So people end up deleting the rars and not seeding for very long.

And almost everyone uses mkv. Use mkv2vob: http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=131782"
[V],harry711,2010-07-01T10:04Z,"@yoncenator: you are probably long gone, but MKV is the industry standard container for HD movies. If you don't know how to convert it to work on a DVD, then you're doing it wrong."
,SpartanX002,2010-10-25T22:11Z,I know this is a stupid question because I didnt see anyone else asking but I downloaded this file and got all the RAR files so what do I do next ? Extract all the RAR files ? Please help thanks
,renars132,2010-10-28T19:56Z,"@tmboyz,

it ISNT a remake of Lake Mungo, because PA was orignally made in 2006, Lake Mungo was in 2008. So its could even be the other way round, Lake Mungo copied PA (maybe not)"
,ps3_4_eva,2011-01-25T20:14Z,"good quality, but peerblock kept on blocking this roman marik guy, no idea who he is, hacker/ap2p, idk but he was connecting every 2 or 3 seconds"
