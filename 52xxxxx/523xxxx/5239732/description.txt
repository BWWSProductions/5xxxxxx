Roland Frederick Godfrey (born 27 May 1921) is a distinguished British animator whose career spans more than fifty years. He is probably best known for the children's cartoon series Roobarb (1974), Noah and Nelly in... SkylArk (1977) and Henry's Cat (1983) and for the Trio chocolate biscuit advertisements shown in the UK during the early 1980s. However, he has also produced a BAFTA and Academy award-winning short film Great (1976), a tongue-in-cheek biography of Isambard Kingdom Brunel.
