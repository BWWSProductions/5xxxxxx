I am a great fan of WoW. I'm a wow fan, i love wow and i have played it for 5 years now. For me the game got the best possible gameplay, with the deepest lore. I have tried other game, aion, df, war, lotro but they didnt catch me, and i've ALWAYS returned to wow. Also, I enjoy playing WoW and Getting Free WoW Game Card from the internet using this guide http://www.freewowgamecard.com.
