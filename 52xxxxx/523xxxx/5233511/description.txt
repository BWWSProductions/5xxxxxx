This was actually very hard to find pre-compiled.

Here is the mp4v2 web page 
http://code.google.com/p/mp4v2/

The tools let you do some unique things that AtomicParsley currently cannot.  Basically setup some Apple crap that is needed for multiple audio tracks and subtitle tracks.  Such as alternate groups and modifying trak.udta.name values for each track.  This is the codebase that subler, muxo and isubtitle most likely are using, pretty sure they are.  I believe handbrake is as well.  I sorta went into great detail about this in encode-handheld 5.2 comments.

Binaries were found here:

Actual download link from that forum is
