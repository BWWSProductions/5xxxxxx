Notes:
Another p2p album from me. I've started going through pop, and this was the result. Well actually this wasn't the result, but

encouraged me to make a pop compilation. I just threw this together in like an hour or so, not much thought put into it, but it's a lot of banger pop tracks. Really, it's the really reall commercial version of my commercial trance likes, notice the electro influences and stolen trancey melos, but in all seriousness, they're good productions IMO. THC4life!
