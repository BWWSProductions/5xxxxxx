Microsoft Return of Arcade (1995) ppGame

Microsoft's "Return of Arcade", released in 1995, was the first of two follow-up versions of Microsoft "Arcade" and contained Galaxian, Pac-Man, Pole Position, and Dig-Dug. This follow-up required Windows 95 or later.

This release also includes a launcher for the "Return of Arcade" collection.

'Built on LT technology' ... This release will be at its most useful 
if using LastOS Team's SetupS or ssWPI

Please read the included ".app" or ".ppg" file for details about the 
associated application or game, such as description, shortcuts and 
links, and other installation details. For example, look for files 
named "SetupS.app", "ppApp.app", or "ppGame.ppg" and open with your 
favorite text file reader/editor.
