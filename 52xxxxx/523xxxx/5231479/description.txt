VirtualDub is an open source video capture and processing program. It might not have the editing power of software like Adobe Premiere, but as a quick way to process video it's hard to beat. 

You can use VirtualDub to trim and clean up video before exporting to tape or processing with another program. With the right plug-ins, you can output your video in various encoded formatsâ€”ready to be distributed on CD, DVD, or over the Internet. 

VirtualDub is popular. At the time of writing, visitors to Sourceforge are downloading it over 16,000 times a day.

This book is your step-by-step guide to getting the most out of VirtualDub. As the  title suggests, we'll cover how to capture video, process it with VirtualDub's editing and filtering features, and finally how to encode video in an appropriate format for distribution.
