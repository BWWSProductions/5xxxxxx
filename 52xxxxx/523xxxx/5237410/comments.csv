""Many thanks! Can't believe I had not heard of this guy until a few days ago. He is up there with dubstep masters like Skream, The Bug, Caspa, etc. ""
You comment this on an upload of sjbrand99. Where is THE BUG discography? Cant find it. Please help."
[T],tzanev,2010-09-12T22:31Z,"If you cannot find a discography, then there is no discography. Watch this space though; I will upload another album and some more singles by The Bug. Unfortunately, I do not have enough of his stuff to call it a ""discography""."

Hmm... This clearly has nothing to do with the film - even though it's quite good - so why bother commenting? Believe it or not, most people are not that stupid."
