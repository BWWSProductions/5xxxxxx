,Cespur,2010-01-22T03:03Z,I so hope I get this right: Does this mean I can FINALY convert all those millions of HD .mkv files out there to a nice Apple TV format?
,Cespur,2010-01-22T03:05Z,"Oh, and sorry to bother you twice but do you got any programs (mac) to give HD tags to movies to use in iTunes? I've searched so long, but it's nowhere to be found. Please say you do, haha.

Thanks for the movies btw, I love the HD ones!"
,Cespur,2010-01-22T12:31Z,But is says that the output can be *.mp4? mp4'a and m4a's are Apple TV supported formats?
,Cespur,2010-01-22T13:09Z,"Would you bother creating some kind of tutorial on how to use this? I don't get it I'm affraid. It's just a file with code? I see you recommend using ""ffmpeg"", but I don't get that as well. I'm really sorry to be such a noob on this area."
