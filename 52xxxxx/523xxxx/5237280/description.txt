    On a beautiful California Christmas Day, the Merriman family             
    celebration is interrupted by massacre and eight-year old son Devin      
    walks out of the house with a blood-covered knife.                       
                                                                             
    Now, 15 years after little Devin brutally murdered his father and the    
    family housekeeper, he escapes the sanitarium where he has been          
    locked away with only one thing on his mind - another bloody             
    Christmas!
