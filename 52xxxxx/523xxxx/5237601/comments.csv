,Jim1979,2009-12-27T18:36Z,Thank you very much GoodFilms! This is epic. It shows how Michael Jackson was the best entertainer in the world and the true King of Pop. This focus on Michaels Music that was going to be on the tour and what a show it would have been! We love you Michael. RIP.

,Archangeldawn,2009-12-31T02:33Z,"Greetings GoodFilms,
 This will be my 1st download from you, question though; What is the cb-til720p.nfo file for? I will be burning this to a DVD, is that .nfo necessary for anything?"
,Archangeldawn,2009-12-31T02:37Z,"AyanPrague ,
 Yes you can put it on a DVD but you will need to convert it to (.vob) DVD format. These bluRay rips are still better than any DVDrips and the final product will show that. Then just burn it to a regular DVD-R and it should play wonderfully.
  I use ConvertXtoDvd to convert and burn. If anyone knows of a better way that does not require a bluray burner, feel free to share."
,ahalheru,2010-01-09T01:23Z,anyone getting artifacts or pixelations when playing off a USB drive?

""If anyone knows of a better way that does not require a bluray burner, feel free to share. ""

yeah rip bluray (reader required) and just burn them on a dvd dl like me....i will be upping some serious high res movies very soon.
i see alot of seeders .mkv their files, what i rarely see is what i do maintain 1080p with dts-hd on a dvd dl now thats awesome, but takes alot of time..and you can even watch them on a BD player:)
everyone has their own way of doing HD movies."

skulls means real means we dont upload fake ; you tell em GoodFilms:)"
,DRAKKID,2010-01-22T18:18Z,great quality rip. the movie how ever is suuuuper creepy. it starts with sycophants fellating MJ. then we move on to see just how mental unhealthy the guy was. first that face shows he was not aware of what he actually looked like. then all the scenes of him interacting with the crew shows he did not have healthy boundaries or was able to communicate clearly at times. there's often mumbling words that trail off. the dude also looks kind of gay. it's just kind of sad. he's talented dude who was just all kind of fucked up. and the music was just so so. worth watching just to skip through the performances and watching the interaction.
,krinata,2010-01-26T23:56Z,"Hi. Does this include the special features, like the unfinished rehearsals and vignettes?"
,manpe,2010-01-28T18:00Z,Is it full BluRay with the 1hr+ material in addition to the actual movie?
,FYL_521,2010-04-23T08:30Z,"This is just a rip from a leak before the movie was released onto BD/DVD, so it's just the main film."
,dajavax,2010-06-06T21:15Z,"it gets stuck and pixelated for me on different parts... i thought it was my computer as it has already happened (only with 1080p though) so i tried it in my WDTV... it was the same... i'll be downloading your 1080p version and hope i have a better luck with that one... btw, i did recheck the torrent just to find out it was ok"
