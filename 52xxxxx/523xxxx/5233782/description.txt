I would like to share with all of you this 4 versions of same song - "Erika - I Don't Know".
I do not remember from where or how I got this. But for years it was honey for my soul. Lately I lost all my music (70GB :))))) because my hard drive collapsed (mother .........). Anyway I was recollecting things and I just COULDN"T find this One. Eventually I've found it on my Brother 's Tetra-San :)

Please try this. Only 25 MB but it may be with you to the rest of your lifes ;)
Please start with "Radio Mix". 


Take Care.
