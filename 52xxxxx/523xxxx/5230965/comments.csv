,unicx,2009-12-20T20:00Z,"I'll put it this way, MCCAFFE. 
The Audio isn't great, but it's good yes.

As mentioned, I wouldn't download this for the great quality and then burn it and watch on a 18934"" widescreen superplasma TV, but if I want to see it now, want subs, and am gonna watch on my computer."

Depending on what client you have, you'll probably have to right click the torrent you're downloading and choose what should be the maximum download speed. 

Though, to get 1Mb/s there has to be a LOT of kind seeders!"
