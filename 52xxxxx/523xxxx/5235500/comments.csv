,siborg69,2009-12-24T05:02Z,"think this might have to do with the specific sdhc card you have.....might be the kernel not working.  so try sticking with your original kernel, copy over the TT menu folder and anything to do with YS menu. cos it all works fine on my DS!  there are plenty of different r4 sdhc's out there, so this might work on mine but not yours!"
,siborg69,2009-12-24T05:04Z,"so copy everything except for ds_menu.dat, .INI, .SYS, .NDS and the moonshl _system_ folders.  that should hopefully work for you.  i had a look about the fake message online and it seems other people have this problem when they have the wrong kernel"
