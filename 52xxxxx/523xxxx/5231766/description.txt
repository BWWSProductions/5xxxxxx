Here are songs we have recently added to the DivX Karaoke DJ collection
since we launched the 5.58GB folder and th subsequent 1.38GB update folder

Theres some great songs here, Italian tarantella, and Bella Ciao along with Aldi la in the Italian section. Then theres a great hit from Santana, Phil Collins, Dan Fogelberg, an old Mary Hopkins tune along with other great oldies from the sixties, some country and more!

At some point we may have so many peers wanting to download that we might just put together an 8GB folder with "everything we've got", however it 
wont make anything weve already got out there redundant and we plan to keep it all going since the 5.58GB is a greatly competent collection already and not everyone will want the additions all in one folder neccesarily. So feel free to pick and choose, and thanks all for the great help we are seeing with seeding along the way.
