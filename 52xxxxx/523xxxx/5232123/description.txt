"Killing in the Name" is a song by American rap metal band Rage Against the
Machine, featured on their 1992 self-titled debut album. Released as the lead
single from the album in November 1992, the song reached number 25 on the UK
Singles Chart and in 2009 became the official Christmas Number 1.

Written about revolution against corruption in society, "Killing in the Name" is
widely recognised as the band's signature song, and has been noted for its
distinctive guitar riffs and heavy use of strong language.

In 2009 the song was part of a successful Facebook campaign to prevent The X
Factor winner's song from gaining the Christmas number one in the UK. The
campaign provoked commentary from both groups and other musicians, as well as
gaining coverage in national press. The song became the first single to reach
number one spot on downloads alone...[MP3 @ 320]
