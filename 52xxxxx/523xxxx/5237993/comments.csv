,shirrick,2010-03-24T20:21Z,"Thanks, waited to try Car Wars for a very long time. Great upload."
,zjohn4,2011-01-10T05:56Z,thanks. been looking for this for long time!
,purpleninjas,2011-02-05T01:50Z,The fact that you even have Car Wars is amazing to me.  I used to play this game many years ago.  The mechanics of the game were quite interesting and I remember our group actually redesigning some of the rules to fit our over zealous needs.  Thanks for the torrent.  I will seed it but it looks like it kinda has a lack of interest.

,SteinerKD,2011-10-22T20:14Z,Seed please!
