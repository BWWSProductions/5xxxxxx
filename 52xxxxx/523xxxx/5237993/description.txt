Combined collection of Car Wars PDF's found on this site. Renamed, deleted cloned files, and made them a little more easier to download.

----->There are not enough seeders out there putting up RPG game books. I have about +60GB of files. D&D, Star Wars, Palandium?, Battletech, etc. I am going to try to make these available ASAP. Im just not really Xperienced at uploading torrents, so cut me some slack, people!

Please enjoy and make use of this classic RPG game. Get your kids into it. Get your grandparents into it. Bring back the classic pen&paper/dice games, yo!!
