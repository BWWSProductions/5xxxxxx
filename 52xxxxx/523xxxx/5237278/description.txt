    It's the 1960's. Local programming thrives as TV stations create         
    shows for their viewing public. Suddenly the "horror host" becomes a     
    nationwide presence on the airwaves as old horror and sci-fi movies      
    are released to television. Dr. Dreck and Moaner go on the air in the    
    small town of Fibbia, Mass. They incur the wrath of the station's        
    grand dame, Louise Morgan, when the popularity of their show pushes      
    her show off the air. So Louise gets nasty. But Dr. Dreck and Moaner     
    can get nastier. Because they are what they really seem to be; a mad     
    scientist and a zombie!
