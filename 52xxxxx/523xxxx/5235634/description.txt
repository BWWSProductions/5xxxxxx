Original Air Dateâ€”3 December 2002

It's Thanksgiving, so Kitty invites about everyone, even ingrate, astray daughter Laurie: reason for 

Red to present Eric as an 'adult' example. Eric decides so sign his own failed maths test, but Kelso 

brings his date: the unmarried maths teacher Miss McGee! Red even lets Eric cut the turkey, but when 

he's about to announce his engagement, a misunderstanding makes drunk beaner Fez spill the maths beans:

Original Air Dateâ€”10 December 2002

The news Jackie's dad councilman Burkhart had to resign after embezzlement charges convinces Kelso 

she'll soon be running back to home for a comforting shoulder, as Steven's remains as cold as his 

heart. 'Perfect couple' Eric and Donna finds they disagree whether the way to go is closeness or giving 

space, and asking the equally divided Forman parents only causes another menopause-crisis... Fez enjoys 

bossy boss Nina giving him a stern lesson in fingerprints-taking, but the ink leaves its black mark on 

her and a part of him he normally only touches, a lot... Kelso has dug up his pallet gun from his 

garden, which was buried after he accidentally killed -till now oblivious- Eric's hamster; now Hyde's 

taunting coincides with another involuntary shot, and the fiend -who constantly punches his poor pall's 

arm black and blue- pretends to be hit in the deceptively patched eye till Michael, who fears to have 

shot 'accidentally on purpose', hands it over penitentially for undeserved corporal punishment aimed at 

the beaut-boy's butt...

dinner party, just when Red wanted to see an annual TV challenge special, Battle of the Network Stars. 

Eric and Hyde object to their girls making them come; when Jackie even wants Steven to wear decent 

cloths, he really refuses, so she accepts an invitation from her ex Kelso, who wasn't allowed to come 

alone. All the men soon run off from the horribly boring party. The boys' last hope to hold out against 

a girl is Fez- even Kelso knows better.
