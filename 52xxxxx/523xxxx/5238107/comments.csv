,upload87,2010-05-05T03:29Z,says its registered but wont let me use none of the features. any ideas ?
,hillneerg,2010-05-10T14:01Z,"You need to set the automatic update to never (options, online check) .
If it connects looking for updates, it blocks you (and you can't re-enter the info as that's a one off thing). It still says registered but won't let you use the functions.
Their security precautions against copied keys). Don't know if uninstalling and trying again would work (or even trying a  different torrent) though."
,hillneerg,2010-05-10T20:27Z,"Just to update. Isobuster will ask to go online to see if there is an update. DON'T LET IT.
The new security feature will know it's a pirate registration and stop functionality. Also follow my recommendations to stop the auto update (or unplug from the Internet before running Isobuster).
If it's too  late and you have lost functionality, you'll need a program that will remove all traces of Isobuster from your PC as there are numerous registry entries that will retain the original key and stop any other versions from working. 
Uninstalling won't do that.
I used Revo Uninstaller Pro (available on TPB) but do watch out for virus/trojan problems. My scanner found (and quarantined) rather a lot.
A reinstall of  Isobuster was accepted and the key worked fine.
Hope this helps -  not the fault of  the uploader, of course. Just down to us  dumb users!"
,johnzboy,2010-06-15T12:30Z,"no no no no no ahhhhhhh chrst this is doing my head in! i done it all! unpluged the net befor the install....ckicked on ''no'' to up date.
still no funtions. 
WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING RONG!!!!!!!
i used the last serial on the list....is it bogus? 
how dose isobuster even no it's pirate coppy when im not even on the bloody net? now got to do what hillneerg said n get it of the reg, lot ofd fucking about if you ask me.
might even pay for it just for an easy life hahaha"
,hillneerg,2010-06-17T22:25Z,"Contrary to what I said (and marking the check for updates as never) it's again reverted to saying I need to buy the key whilst showing as registered.
It did work well for a while (at least it told me what my mountain of unreadable DVD RWs contained (recorded on another machine which broke down and the new machine & PC wouldn't touch them) and allowed me to extract the files fine. Tried another couple today - nope.
I can only presume that Isobuster now secretly connects to make sure it's legit.
Bummer.
I can only suggest diconnection from the Internet whilst you run the program and then connect again after you've closed it.
If you forget, it's back to stage one and a deregistered version."
