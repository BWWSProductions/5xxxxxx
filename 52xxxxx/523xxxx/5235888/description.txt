                    Invisible Man.                           
                    First of two parts. DCs Webb and Banks   
                    investigate when the body of a young man is  
                    fished from the Thames. The dead man is  
                    identified as Jake Evans, and the detectives  
                    discover that he had been volunteering at a  
                    homeless shelter. Initially suspicion falls on  
                    the deceased's fiancee, who had argued with  
                    Jake a few days before he died. But after Webb  
                    spends a night on the street befriending some  
                    of the homeless people Jake knew, the officers  
                    realise that the community is living in fear of  
                    someone who may have have had a hand in Jake's  
                    murder - but who?
