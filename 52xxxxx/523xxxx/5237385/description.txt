Portishead have released a brand new track - 'Chase the Tear' for Amnesty International. 

First aired on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on 9 December, the track is out just in time for international human rights day on 10 December.

And if you were wondering -  'Chase the Tear' is a reference to a paper tear-style 'tear', not a tear from an eye!
