A collection of maps/mods for the Half Life series. All mods are freeware/public domain so require no hacks/patches or crack files. The quality of game play varies from Fantastic to Meh.
- These games require the original HalfLife2 game to be installed. 
- Installation methods vary between mods. Some are packaged as auto installers, others are zipfiles that just need to be decompressed to your mods folder. 
- Most come with instructions for installing.
- Feel free to download only the ones you want, or the whole sha-bang.

If you know of other single player Half-Life mods that are worth playing, please let me know.
