,alix1,2009-12-29T17:23Z,:) great update man!
,dilpill,2009-12-30T03:56Z,Has everyone with the 1.8/2.3 patch been able to install these OK using the included instructions?
,Girkish,2010-01-05T23:10Z,"No, I haven't been able to... At least without it causing glitches and slowing everything down."
,Girkish,2010-01-06T22:17Z,"Okay, they work fine. The glitchiness was induced by stupidity on my part. ^_^"" Thanks for the item update."
,Girkish,2010-01-06T23:24Z,"...Okay, it seems like I spoke too soon earlier. I'm probably being a real idiot, but there seems to be some sort of conflict now between the Resource.cfg file from Delphi to let you use these package files, and Awesome mod... I don't know. This is just messed up, and I feel like a nitwit. Can anyone else who downloads this with either of those installed help me out?"
,Nightmeows,2010-01-08T08:09Z,Thank you very much! :)
