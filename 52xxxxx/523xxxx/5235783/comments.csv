Actually, Fig666 is NOT the only one to have probs with this release (you are not the first to up)! 

The keys frequently up'd with the 2.03 release are ALL blacklisted. Need to source a 2.01 release with a REG-KEY, as this will also register the 2.03 release just fine :)"
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-01-31T22:22Z,folks i ve realise some guys download the crack here and download the set up at vendor-site. you must download both here. when you mix and match. you are bound to ve problwem
,Deadly-Knight,2010-03-25T23:35Z,The serial keys are not working because they have been used by too many computers. Resetting them will not work either.
