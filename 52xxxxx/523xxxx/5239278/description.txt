This is a manual for movable type.  It is more advanced and detailed.  I laugh when I read the standard movable type installation guide and they simplify everything in order to not intimidate potential users, but in so doing they leave you empty handed without the knowledge you need making the installation harder.

This guide is something all movable type users should read if they have any knowledge of servers.


About me and my torrents:
  I'm here to start doing torrents smarter.  If you know any torrents that you would like done smarter leave me a comment.  We have 17 of the top trackers in this torrent.  I also have made it so it organizes smarter.  I do have a policy on leechers.  Just seed it to a ratio of 3. Just set the download to do that automatically. If it sits around for a week then stop seeding.  Also if you can learn about port forwarding then do so.
