,Jack_Raiden,2010-06-21T16:06Z,"Video: XviD, 1280x720 (16:9), 1500 Kbps
Audio: MP3, Stereo, 64 Kbps (CBR)
Comments: The quality is tragic. :'( Insanely low video bitrate/quality (esp. for HD 720p), with low quality encoding settings, VERY noticable blocks and artifacts. Very low audio bitrate/quality as well, with wasteful CBR & 48KHz sampling."
