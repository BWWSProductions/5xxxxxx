""Ricky, Jukian, Bubbles, Sam Losco, Cyrus, and Ray all plot revenge against Jim Lahey upon their release from prison...""

Thats complete fucking bullshit, you didnt even watch the movie did you. Sam and Cyrus have NO ROLE in this entire movie. 

The movies about Lahey trying to get Julian to move to hsi new trailer park because the sewer line for the new park runs underneath Julians old Trailer, but Julian wants to go legit and start an auto body business; and about Bubbles neededing tp save his kitties. Ultimately everyones plans go to shit and they end up attempting another big dirty by robbing a bank."

,xebz,2009-12-25T16:02Z,@anonymous4422 Thanks for the spoiler you fucking cock.
,Lucky13s,2009-12-25T23:55Z,"@xebz

Actually this all is decided near the start of the movie and pretty much sums up the actual movie description.

The movie description above is actually the retarded summary that was 'guessed' by idiot fans long before the movie came out in theaters; but thanks for noting your ignorance."
,xebz,2009-12-26T15:51Z,Robbing a bank was in the beginning?? He spoiled the fucking ending. So shut the fuck up cumguzzlin cunt!
