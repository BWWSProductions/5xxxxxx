When his brother is killed in battle, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully decides to take his place in a mission on the distant world of Pandora. There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridgeâ€™s intentions of driving off the native humanoid â€œNaâ€™viâ€ in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland. In exchange for the spinal surgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers intel for the cooperating military unit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while simultaneously attempting to infiltrate the Naâ€™vi people with the use of an â€œavatarâ€ identity. While Jake begins to bond with the native tribe and quickly falls in love with the beautiful alien Neytiri, the restless Colonel moves forward with his ruthless extermination tactics, forcing the soldier to take a stand â€“ and fight back in an epic battle for the fate of Pandora

From NFO:

Our V2 of Avatarâ€¦this time we used the original source files given to us by ELEKTRI4KA. This allowed us for a much better rip and also slightly less cropped by a few pixels than other releases. We found some subs for the non-english parts that were made by birdflu. Worked done â€“ increasing contrast; colours; sharpening; noise reduction; and hardcoding subs. Audio is the same as before supplied by mindfuck but filtered slightly different to last time.
