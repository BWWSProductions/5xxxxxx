Here's how to run Moo2 for DosBox:

-Put the Moo folder in C: (no deeper)

-Get DosBox for free at http://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1

-Install DosBox

-Put the DosBox.conf file into DosBox's folder

-Run DosBox

-Type "orion2" (without "'s)

-Have fun



*Notice*

Due to the joys of ADSL, I have a shitty upload speed. 

You have been warned.
