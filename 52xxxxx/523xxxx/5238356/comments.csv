,MONGDESADE,2009-12-24T12:50Z,Here's a novel idea...when you u/l a torrent...how about seeding it first Chariefucknut51 ?!
,CharlieAllnut51,2009-12-24T21:21Z,"Here's a better idea... in order for it to get seeded at any reasonable speed, people must be made aware of it. People become aware of it when the torrent is uploaded to a site such as Pirate Bay. If you actually were to ever upload anything yourself, you might be aware of this.

Is at 90% as we speak.

At any rate, enjoy..."
