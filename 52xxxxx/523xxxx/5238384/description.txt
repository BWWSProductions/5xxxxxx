A dream is real so long as it lasts. When we awake, 
we  do not  pass  from unreality  to  reality; we  pass 
from a  lower  state of  reality  to a higher one.  Is it 
not possible that there is a state of awareness higher 
still, compared with which the limited satisfactions 
of everyday life are no more lasting than a dream?
