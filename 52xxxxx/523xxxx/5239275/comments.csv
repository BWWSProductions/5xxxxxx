,zdude123,2010-01-12T13:01Z,Warning about Subs. They are translated real bad.
,mufuti9,2010-02-19T20:23Z,"HORRIBLE decoding.

sound is ok but the video is unwatchable, when there is a lot of camera movement because of pixelation. not good at all.

Stay away from this one.

v:3/a:6

subtitle: hilarious."

,zbuf,2012-05-27T08:13Z,Can someone please tell me how to use subtitles? Please! Thank you in advance. 
,bhfv,2012-05-29T23:26Z,"@zbuf... rename your subtitle file that should be in .srt format so that your movie and subtitle file got same name. and place subtitle file in movie folder.you are done :).
