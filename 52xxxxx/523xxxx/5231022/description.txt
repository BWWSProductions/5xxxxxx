By the way we added the French version of Ave Maria in our 5.11GB karaoke folder along with a couple of other French selections too. We have the best German song "Dein ist mein ganzes herz (Ricard Tauber)" coming next week.
We do not use the Kunze rendition of this great song.

We havent yet given you the Italian Tarantella (Napoletana) with lyrics
so here it is (our previous version had vocals only since thats all we could find) - so here it is, along with some other tunes. I added "Count on me" by Jefferson Starship as I was at Toronto's best karaoke bar last night and the DJ sang it well, as his favorite song - oh well! Im always the best, though in any Karaoke contest at all - I have a powerful voice that knocks em dead with real feeling thats unmatched! I sang several irish tunes and a couple of Italian too.

We are suprised to see some many seeders on torrents that offer too many karaoke selections that are based only on publisher or certain artists completely, as think it better to offer a collection thattruly is meant to be a complete DJ selection and well picked in each and every song. We otherwise dont do as much of a service to those in need, and we waste a lot of resources as a result. Please support our karaoke torrents. merci
