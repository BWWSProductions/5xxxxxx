Another strange episode that is entertaining because it's different.

Robert F. Simon plays a man who hires Paladin to find out how people in his zodiac-based pyramid scheme are mysteriously dying.

The victims include Jack Elam as a carnival performer and Lloyd Corrigan as a very religious pet shop owner.  Heavyset Barbara Pepper runs a saloon where one of her girls is murdered.
