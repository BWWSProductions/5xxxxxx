[T],Games4theworld,2010-01-14T17:12Z,"Hi,

  Please just comment once.

You have to Copy + Paste the Crack(CasinoApp.exe) file (Inside the ""# Crack"" file in the .rar file you Downloaded) to the file where you Installed the Game to. Standard this will be: C:\Program Files\Monte Cristo\Casino Tycoon

For more information, feel free to contact our (Live) Support: Games4theworld@hotmail.com"

Is what I get when I try to install. Help?"
[T],Games4theworld,2011-04-02T00:01Z,"Hello,

@Idort77

  Please open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select ĂÂĄll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. Good luck!
