Creed's second album continues in the vein of MY OWN PRISON, combining heavy guitar rock with lyrics that aspire to something beyond standard rock & roll hedonism. There's plenty of head-banging riffs for lead singer Scott Stapp's Vedder-esque ... Full Descriptionwail to ride over (although the band is surprising nimble considering how heavy it plays) and this time out there's also some softer stuff --"Say I," "Wrong Way"--with more than a hint of Led Zeppelin in its Middle-Eastern experimental mode. Even more surprising, there's actually a ballad here--"With Arms Wide Open"--with a wistfully beautiful melody. 

"With Arms Wide Open" won the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Rock Song and was nominated for the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.
