BUGS

1)Title Screen not made

2)The Wally event is not working properly(Ralts he tries to capture faints)

3) Although I have implemented National dex in Ruby still data of starter and some 
       pokemon from other regions not recorded  
 (Although the information about Pokemon seen and captured is shown correctly)

4) Cries of starters and only some Pokemon have been inserted correctly 
    Rest will be done soon

5) Some of the d/p exclusive attacks looks strange like Ominious Wind,Leaf Storm

6) Pokedex is activated after u get Running Shoes
    (NOT quite sure u can consider it a bug or not)
