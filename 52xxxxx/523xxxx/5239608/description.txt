USA? Terror alerts and loss of liberty based on a scam: 
Swindler duped CIA over decoding Al-Qaeda 'secret messages.'

Hour 2: 

We are joined by Jim Purcey. 
In his first book, "Am I The Only American Who Thinks This Way?" Jim introduces his readers to the lies and half-truths government has imposed on the people. His writings are simple, easy to read, thought provoking, informative, refreshing and a voice of a man who truly loves his country.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
