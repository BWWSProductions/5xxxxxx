The Grey Agenda

Unknown-2009

Experimental Indie

I would like to give away this album in hopes it may bring pleasure to someone other than myself. Its basically a collection of 30 or so songs that did not make it on my studio album. The music industry has destroyed independent music, and has removed artistry and replaced it with advertising and sex. This is our response.

If you enjoy this album thank you, we do not want your money.
