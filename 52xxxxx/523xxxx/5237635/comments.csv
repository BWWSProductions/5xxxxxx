Grym uppladdning!"
,thribbone,2010-03-21T18:57Z,Thanks for the download but this version has the very top and bottom of the picture cropped...
[V],GoodFilms,2010-05-20T17:26Z,Nope. The aspect ratio is 100% correct.
,Renegade78,2010-09-19T22:13Z,"So slooooooow, goddammit, seed people."
,mrfoods,2010-11-09T15:31Z,"thanx for the download, this vid is perfect from start to finish! "
,osriccc,2010-11-11T08:04Z,"Please, try to get the files around 3 Gb or less. There is no difference between this version and any of the other 2.5 Gb versions around as I notice...just that this one is obviously better than Secret_Myth's one because of the hardcoded french subtitles it had."
[V],GoodFilms,2010-11-18T13:44Z,The difference in quality is huge. Go elsewhere for your shitty quality tiny bandwidth crap
,chandlerboy,2010-11-19T00:24Z,"Wow, the uploader of this torrent sounds like quite the douchebag! Unfortunate."
[V],GoodFilms,2010-11-27T14:45Z,"You, my son, are the douchebag. A shame you have not yet discovered the beauty of bluray."
,boxerzguy,2010-12-23T00:02Z,seeders for these big files would be nice..  /wrists
,cooperidol,2011-01-01T16:34Z,"first of all a big CHEERS to GoodFilms for this quality download!
im completely new to this and was hoping for a couple of answers...
1) when i play this file there are subtitles, is there anyway to remove these?
2) im looking to convert this film into a file that will play on PS3 and Itunes, will converting to MPEG4 enable this?"
,callaghan173,2011-01-15T13:03Z,"Use MKV2VOB to convert this to ps3, easy.
And thanks for the quality upload, 2.5gb torrent would have so many artefacts and compression. "
,abhikrit,2011-01-30T22:01Z,guys like osricc are assholes... dont know the wonders of bluray or HD.. asshole.. thanks man.. i have this copy in my collection :)
,baretoof,2011-03-16T08:06Z,thanks for this
