Although the subtitle suggests that A HUNDRED MILES OR MORE is just a standard greatest hits set, this anthology is actually something far more useful. The career-spanning 16-track set gathers nearly all of Alison Krauss's soundtrack appearances, ... Full Descriptionguest shots on other folks' albums, tribute songs, and a handful of other rarities. By gathering all this material in one place, it's a hugely useful album for fans, but on its own musical merits, A HUNDRED MILES OR MORE contains some of Alison Krauss's best work. Highlights include "Down to the River to Pray," her haunting a cappella addition to the Grammy winning O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU soundtrack, and her version of Elvis Costello's "The Scarlet Tide" from the soundtrack to the Civil War romance COLD MOUNTAIN.
