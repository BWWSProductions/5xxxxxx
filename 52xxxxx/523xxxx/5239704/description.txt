Ku soo dhawow - compilation nr 7


Power & sensibility with Aniisa Mahdi, Fartuun Birimo's & Qoomaal's great voices, sweet melancholic reggae with Mohamed Deco, Qaaci Yaman Banaadir, Sidi Cali's kinda gypsie-fanfare-pop, Sowtu Raxma's hindi sound, Sulai Antar Naaji, great arabic riffs on Zakaria Sultan's 'Waano', Zienab Labodhagah, strong & important opinions on 'Qeylodhaan' and more...

I tried to fix better sound on some tracks from nr 6. I love 'Igu Labo Ahow' and 'Iga Mudan Xasuus Dadnimee', two of the best songs I've heard this year/2009! And I could name more...

The sound quality isn't the best on some tracks - I know - but if I like a song, I'll add it anyway. Don't hesitate to post links to better versions of these tunes.


66 mp3 songs, nearly 6 hours of Somali music so... ENJOY nr 6... I mean nr 7! ;)
