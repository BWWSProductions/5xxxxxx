,eddy9898,2009-12-22T02:26Z,What is the Quality of the Audio and Video?
,tjack360,2009-12-22T03:31Z,You can look at the screens and judge for yourself. The audio is decent.
,eddy9898,2009-12-22T03:40Z,The screens don't show too much. The file is yours so you have a say.
,tjack360,2009-12-22T03:53Z,Video-5 Audio-8.

,Jookycola,2009-12-23T12:14Z,Really a 1.43GB video file for the PSP or any handheld is over kill.  There is no reason for ANY movie file on a handheld to be over 600 to 700GB tops.  With that said the movie looks great (obviously) but is far to big to keep on an iPhone or PSP for very long since it takes up too much space
,tjack360,2009-12-24T07:51Z,"Jookycola - I like the quality of a 640x480 WS rip instead of 480x272. Besides, I have an 8GB mem card and getting a 16GB soon. Not too big if you have room. Besides, I archive all of my PSP movies on an external HDD. To each his/her own I guess. Glad you liked the rip."
