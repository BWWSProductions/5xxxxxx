Who Can Kill a Child? (also known Â¿QuiÃ©n puede matar a un niÃ±o? and Island of the Damned) is a 1976 Spanish horror film directed by Narciso IbÃ¡Ã±ez Serrador. It is about an English couple who find an island inhabited by maniacal children.

The film was based on a novel by Juan JosÃ© Plans and adapted for cinema by Narciso IbÃ¡Ã±ez Serrador. It had been virtually unavailable officially until it was released on DVD by Dark Sky Films in June 2007.

This rip is from the recent Dark Sky Films release and is the English dub of the movie. The torrent contains English subtitles for certain scenes that are spoken in Spanish.
Unfortunately the source DVD appears to have some subtitling errors. Doktor_Cult was unable to successfully rip English subs without ripping the Spanish subs as well. The Spanish subs are also in English, but apply to the Spanish dub of the film (not included here). This is the English dub, with English subs where necessary.

In VLC player make sure the English subtitles are enabled, unless you speak Spanish. Don't bother with the "Spanish" subtitles.
