,CrissLHB,2009-12-23T20:04Z,You got to be fucking kidding me! Don't download this fucking shit unless your an easily entertained 1 month old child! Getting Rick Rolled 1000 times in more enjoyable than this fucking shit! 50% of these games are Solitaire! Fucking solitaire! START > All Programs > Games > Solitaire fucking done! Who the fucking fuck would make such a fucking horrible fucking thing! Sniffing ass hairs is more fun than this shit!
