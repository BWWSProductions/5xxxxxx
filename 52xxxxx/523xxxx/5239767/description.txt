Description from Wikipedia:
Following the much more mainstream commercial content of their previous two albums, Savage saw Eurythmics "turn sharp left" (as Stewart put it), with a much more experimental sound. Production-wise, the album is mainly based around drum loops using the NED Synclavier digital sampling keyboard, with synth and guitar parts relatively low in the mix. The only other musician working on the recordings with Stewart and Lennox was drummer Olle Romo, who handled much of the Synclavier programming. Lennox brought a feminist focus to her lyrics, with sequence of frustrated female characters in the songs. This was made more evident by the accompanying video album, which featured a video for each song, directed by Sophie Muller.
