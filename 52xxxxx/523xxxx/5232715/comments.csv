So Thank you very much !
When future beta will come out and if you have the time it would be nice to upload them as well :)

Have a nice day !"
,Sematary,2009-12-29T12:09Z,"There's a new beta but introduced many serious problems it seems, when you load a save all casus belli become multiplied, leading to world wars in a few years, also AI keeps breaking treaties within days of signing them..."
,umbral,2010-01-02T15:31Z,Thank you for the update ! :)
,Sematary,2010-01-07T12:26Z,"Still no news of another beta, and is badly needed... Another major bug discovered in the latest: when you spawn patriot rebels, instead of defecting to their culture they conquer provinces for your country. They even attack your vassals. One can conquer whole Europe only spawning patriots."
,firemblem,2010-01-14T09:12Z,"Thanks for the upload, but how do I use it? Do i just move it into my EU3 folder?"
,mucgoo,2010-01-21T19:55Z,Could the uploader upload 4.1b?
,cgijoe123,2010-02-01T22:17Z,"Well i made a new folder for the pirate i got of EU3 Complete and i just extracted the 4.1 into that folder. It looks ok, it ahs replaced all the old files but when i start the game (i have to use EU3's complete autplay in order for it to start) the EXE called eu3 that comes with the 4.1 doesnt work, so when i use the autoplay it stands im playing napoleons ambition, how do i do so it runs HTTT?"
,Villanus,2010-02-05T11:57Z,"cgijoe123: EU3 Complete includes EU3, NA, and IN, but not HttT."
