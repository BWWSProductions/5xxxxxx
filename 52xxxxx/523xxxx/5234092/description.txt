* STORY :

* In AD 2154, a human corporation mines Pandora, the lush moon of Polyphemus, one of three gas giants that orbit Alpha Centauri A, 4.4 light years from Earth. The humans seek to exploit Pandora's reserves of a precious mineral called unobtanium. Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), the head of the mining operation, employs former Marines and soldiers as mercenaries.

Pandora is inhabited by an indigenous paleolithic species of sapient humanoids called the Na'vi. Standing nine feet (2.74 m) tall, with tails, bones reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber, and bioluminescent blue skin, the Na'vi live in harmony with the natural world, and are considered primitive by human standards. They worship a mother goddess called Eywa.

Humans are unable to breathe Pandora's atmosphere, which is rich in carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia, and peaceful interaction with the Na'vi is difficult. Human researchers led by Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) create the Avatar Program, genetically engineering human-Na'vi hybrids. A human who shares genetic material with an avatar is mentally linked to it, allowing them to control it while their own body 'sleeps'. These avatars cost millions to produce and link, so gaining access to one is difficult. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a former Marine who was paralyzed below the waist in combat on Earth. His twin brother, Thomas, was a scientist working in the Avatar Program; when Thomas is killed, Jake takes his brother's place because he is compatible with his brother's avatar. Dr. Augustine is less than happy about Jake being there, as his brother had a doctorate and years of training to participate in the program. In contrast, Jake has no knowledge of Na'vi culture and has never used an avatar. The research team lets him go through with the program, having him act as security detail rather than a scientist.
