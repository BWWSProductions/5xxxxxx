Hereâ€™s a collection of African music from Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly known as Zaire), Republic of South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The genre is Rhumba, Kwaito, Kalindula, Chiunda, Ragga and Reggae. In certain cases the albums are complete while others are just a pick of what was popular at the time the albums were released. The music spans from the 70â€™s to somewhere around 2006.

Hereâ€™s my thought: if we can find this mix of genre popular amongst ourselves, Iâ€™m convinced that our brothers and sisters in the Western world can also appreciate the same interest that we have in our musicâ€¦if only we can market this music enough. For example, if I find Awilo Longomba appealing and danceable and at the same time I find Jay Seanâ€™s song â€˜Down,â€™ appealing and danceable, I see no reason why this canâ€™t work the other way round.

My final thought: if it ainâ€™t on TPB, it probably isnâ€™t good enough for the world!  Please seed and enjoyâ€¦.. The mark of the tooth.
