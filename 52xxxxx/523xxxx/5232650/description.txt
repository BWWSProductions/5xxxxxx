  384 kHz, 32-bit floating point resolution.

  effect plug-ins.

  export (CD mastering as well as DVD-A authoring).
- Extended audio file handling and manipulation system including files sizes > 2 GB.

- Support for all common bit-rates 8-, 16-, 20-, 24-bit at up to 384 kHz). 



New features Steinberg WaveLab:

Version 6 extends the successful WaveLab concept by combining the renowned, 
award-winning WaveLab audio engine with over 120 new features and enhancements. 
The highlights in the new version include the innovative Spectrum Editor, the 
seamless intergration of external effect hardware, support for MIDI remote 
controllers, the new SmartBypass system with automatic loudness compensation, 
DIRAC time-stretching and pitch-shifting, support for Bob Katzâ€™ K-System metering 
and much, much more. 


New ASPI Driver:

If you are experiencing problems (and only in this case) with cd burning or cd 
grabbing, please use the new aspi driver. The patch should always be applied 
*after* any WaveLab 6 patch. If you reapply a WaveLab 6 patch, the existing 
aspi driver will be overwritten. Please find more information about the new aspi 
driver in the aspi.txt document, which is installed in the WaveLab help folder. 



Improvements Steinberg WaveLab:

- Podcast creator. This is a rather large feature, please refer to the addendum 
  documentation.
- Better optimizations for Intel Core 2 Duo processors.
- Batch processor: new Â« Audio Injector Â» plugin. This plugin allows to insert 
  an audio file before or/and after the files to process, with an optional 
  cross-fade process. The file(s) to inject must have the same number of channels 
  and sample rates as the source files, and must not be longer that 60 seconds.
- Batch processor: new Â« Trimmer Â» plugin. This plugin allows to cut a specific 
  time at the head or/and tail of the audio file. It can be useful when combined 
  with the Silence plugins, Fade-in/out plugins, and reverb-like plugins.
- Waves VST plugins are now supported from the Master Section (must be using the 
  latest VST shell).
- Audio Montage: it is now possible to navigate in the zoom/cursor/scroll history 
  using the more standard key shortcuts Alt+Left/Right arrow keys. Some extended 
  keyboards have dedicated keys for this. Same thing for mouse Back/Forward buttons 
  (mouses with 2 additional buttons on the side). In other words, it is possible to 
  navigate in the zoom/cursor/scroll history using the same shortcuts as eg. in 
  Microsoft internet explorer.
- Audio Montage: better display when using Control + left/right arrow 
  (allow to navigate from clip boundary to clip boundary).
- Audio Montage / Wave : Key shortcut added for << Move edit cursor 
  to position.. >> : < ! >
- Key shortcut added for << Live input.. >> : < Control + Shift + I >



Bug fixes Steinberg WaveLab:

- Crytal Resampler: bug fix and slightly improved quality in << Ultra >> mode.
- Burning an Audio Montage using Track effects, and with the option << Render to 
  temporary file before burning >>, had for effect to apply the track effects twice.
- CD-Text issue fixed.
- When moving a Xfade left and right the volume enveloppe points don't move anymore.
- Improved look and installation under Vista.
- Problem fixed with some plugins used with a mono file.
- Audio CD grabbing: the last audio track of a CD-Extra could not be grabbed and 
  its length was wrongly displayed.
- Opening the Live Input window while a meter window was open, caused a crash.
- Recording audio to a mono track of an Audio Montage, was systematically adding 
  a new track to the montage.
- Fixed possible problem when exporting text in Excel format (eg. Clip list).
- Audio Montage: playback can now start even if some audio peak files are being 
  built.
- Improved compatibility when saving << ulaw >> and << alaw >> audio files with a 
  WAV file header.
- In the montage "Files" tab, the file date's day and month were exchanged.
- It was not possible to erase a Montage track name.
- Batch renaming of clips and markers: the initial value of the << counter >>
  procedure was ignored.
- Useless peak files with a null size could sometimes be created for some audio 
  files.
- Auto Split: useless audio files with a null size could be created, in certain 
  cases.
- Master Section slot key commands above 3 where not selectable.
- Auto Split: in mode << Cut Head and Tail >>, the option << Insert silence at 
  start or end >> was ignored.
- Silence plugin: (batch processor). The plugin works nice correctly.
- Loudness distribution: the dB value displayed at the mouse cursor position, 
  did not take into account the AES17 preference.
- Opening a copy of an Audio Montage, would change the date of the original montage.
- Audio file path is now remembered when opening an audio file as a montage.
- Audio Montage: saving a clip will now always set the right file extension. 
- Audio Montage: the colour condition feature was not working.
- Other minor problems.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
