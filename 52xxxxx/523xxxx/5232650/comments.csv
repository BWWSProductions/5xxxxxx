,nunyasochata,2009-12-30T22:29Z,"works great w/ windows 7... 1 problem w/ solution. I have CWSP 8.5 installed. got serious errors on the following VSTi plugins:

Rapture LE
z3ta+ 

all i did was go to the folder containing these plugins and delete them.

since there are so many great plugins i will never use, im sure i will never miss these 2.

after i deleted the plugins it started up with no problems at all.

obviously my Sonar is working perfectly after deleting the 2 plugins as well... they are just plugins right...

SO>>> thank you RobbingHood for the ""UP"", it is squeaky clean and a huge thanks to TEAM AiR for another fine piece of work...

remember to buy after you try and never charge money for work you have done using this software 'til after you pay for it. "

,loooserloooser,2010-12-02T14:55Z,"Than you for the product, TEAM AIR, and thank you for uploading it, RobbingHood, and thanks everyone for sharing.

@ daEiK:

I myselsf started working on audio material with Wavelab a long time ago, so I'm very much used to it's use and can handle it intuively. I also met a couple of people who started working with CoolEdit (what is now Audition), who say the same about Wavelab. I don't know, but might it be, tha you haven't gave yourself enough time to learn the functions of Audition?

Greetings"
