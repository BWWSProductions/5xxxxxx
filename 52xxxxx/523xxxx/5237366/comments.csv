,christmoose,2010-01-01T02:54Z,"Does this (and previous best-of comps of yours) draw solely from the previous year's compilations, or do they have additional songs as well?

I rate all the music myself, so I more or less already have my 'best of' rated, and would like to avoid duplicates.

That said -- you are hands-down the best source of amazing new music on the planet. I salute you!!"
,SLC2009,2010-01-02T13:07Z,"christmoose - Nearly all repeats bar one or two.

ge0rgie86 - Probably not. Only changed it last time because of computer probs.

Dec mixtapes up soon."

,Touchmetal,2010-01-21T19:04Z,"The first song from this collection could possibly be the best instrumental song i have ever heard...

But then the drop off in quality from MONO to 'Lovely Eggs' is so big its not even funny...I mean what the hell kind of song is 'Have You Ever Heard A Digital Accordion'

Anyway on the whole this collection rocks and i highly recommend it..."
