Basically: Think ID4 with crappier everything, replace alien ships with comets, and the noise thing with a generic earthquake making enormous crack in ground scene where someone dies.Complete with diving-from-explosion, 'nooooooo' friend death, incredibly bad use of bluescreen - superhuman speed complete with motion blur, amazingly loud, crappy ""dramatic"" synthesiser soundtrack overlaid with whispers of voice from the cast, frightened civilian frozen in car during impending doom who is safe in two steps but somehow unable to move until shouted at, another nick-of-time dive from danger, generic teenage romance scene and fuck knows what else. I gave up and watched a few repeats of Futurama and Southpark instead, it was far more entertaining."
