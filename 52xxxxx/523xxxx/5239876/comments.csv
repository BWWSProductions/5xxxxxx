Original CD-rip!
But it's only in FLAC - so the worst quality you can get :)"
[T],lonesomecowboy,2009-12-30T23:25Z,"Hey Canadianice,
joking aside - it sounds quiet good for a '72 live recording."
,Nepitaliaan,2010-01-01T03:03Z,"I hope it sounds quite good, rather than quiet good?
;-)
Happy New Year everybody.."
[T],lonesomecowboy,2010-01-01T13:38Z,"Oops...
Pardon me, Mr. Nepitaliaan :-)
Happy New Year everybody!"
