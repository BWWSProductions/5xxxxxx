An important book. If you care about our Government's complicity in these illegal and horrific acts then this book provides the evidence.' Ken Loach"Extraordinary rendition, false imprisonment, inhumane treatment - including torture and death in secretive detention sites - has forever destroyed the lives of hundreds of men, of whom I was one. This book is the first of its kind to collate accounts from the prisoners themselves."Moazzam Begg, former Guantanamo detainee and spokesman for CagePrisoners"Guantanamo Bay is a legal black hole. ... This book is the closest many of the prisoners will come to a fair trial. Andy Worthington [uses] the US government's own documents to prove that innocent people were swept up in the post-9/11 panic. 

This is important work, impressively written." Clive Stafford Smith, Legal Director of Reprieve, and author of Bad Men: Guantanamo Bay and the Secret Prisons"Stunning. ... [Worthington] undermines claims that the prison camp is filled with vicious killers and terrorists."Marc Falkoff, lawyer for 17 Yemeni prisoners and editor of Poems from Guantanamo: The Detainees Speak"A meticulous [book] about torture at the beginning of the twenty-first century. [Written with] poignancy, compassion and outrage."Marty Fisher, Co-Producer of the film, 'Taxi to the Dark Side' "[This book is] an important tool for coming to grips with how we as a nation allowed indefinite detention without charge, extraordinary rendition and torture to become national policies."Candace Gorman, lawyer for two Guantanamo prisoners.
