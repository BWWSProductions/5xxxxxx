V1 #1 is not the original series but the newer batman/superman title. The older issues are not complete comics but the actual batman/superman story lines so they are only about 8-14 pages of the actual comic. The very old ones are reprints, probably from a hardbound collection. All in all if you want to read the stories this is a decent collection worth the download. If you were wanting the complete books for each volume then this is not what you want. I took it for what it is and kept the completes for my collection.

The quality of the scans are good. You can't be too picky with older comics that had the paper that didn't age well."

Sorry but I have thousands of comics and unfortunatelly don't have the time to check all of them.

I think I have a few that are better than these ones, but how can I attach those to this torrent?

Another solution is this site

They have pratically all the Comics and in good shape, but you can't download them, just read (of course taking a screenshot is viable, but time-consuming)."
