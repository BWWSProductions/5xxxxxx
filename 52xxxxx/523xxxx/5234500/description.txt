
A Charlie Brown Christmas
=========================

This is the old standard, perennial favourite Christmas cartoon from the
1960s, still as good today as it ever was, with two shorts featuring the
Peanuts characters, Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, Snoopy and other assorted
sorts, all struggling with their own version of Christmas spirit, or not.

Good quality XviD AVI, MD5 file and an MP3 for audio only usage.
