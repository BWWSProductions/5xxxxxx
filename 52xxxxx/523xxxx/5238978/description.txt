The risk that Phil Collins took in displaying painful lyrics at an obviously harrowing time could have been taken as self-indulgence, but 18 years on this album is still seen as his best and most assured. The Genesis drummer displayed dynamic arrangements ('In The Air Tonight'), melancholy piano ('You Know What I Mean') and Philadelphia soul ('I Missed Again'), and wrapped up with a cover of 'Tomorrow Never Knows' at which even John Lennon would have tipped his hat. After this album Collins embarked on an extraordinarily busy career that included a rejuvenated Genesis, film roles and huge solo success. This will always be the album closest to his heart, with the paint pot on the piano.
