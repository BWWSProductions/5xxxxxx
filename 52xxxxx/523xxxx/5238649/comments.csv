It's a 32bit only version:  Installer does NOT want to install in 64bit.

I guess I could grab the 64bit trial and use the keygen, but the VanDyke site requires registration even for trials, so back to PuTTY it is ^__^"
,D0gmeat,2009-12-25T04:04Z,Thanks for this! The Patch/Keygen worked much better than TBE's release.
