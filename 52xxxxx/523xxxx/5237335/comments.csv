,blacklabel67k,2011-06-16T21:51Z,"They're smart. If your not well known pirating can help you. Asshats like Born of Osiris will do the opposite and upload fake albums and spam torrent sites like douchebags. Closure of moscow is one of my new favorite bands. I'm about to teach myself ""reindeer age"" on the drums. Thanks uploader!"

Thanks for this!"
