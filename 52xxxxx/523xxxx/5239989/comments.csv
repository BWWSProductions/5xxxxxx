,NephilimNexus,2011-02-22T18:33Z,Is this the Gold version?  Because I've been trying to find a copy that is NOT the Gold version and have had no luck so far.
,NephilimNexus,2011-02-23T00:44Z,"Yep, this is the gold version, completely identical to every other JA2 rip here on pirate bay."
,gmb297,2011-03-14T22:09Z,I get the same font error. Is there a way to get around this?
