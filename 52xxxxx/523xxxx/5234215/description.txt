No Exit is the seventh studio album by the US rock/new wave group Blondie. It was released in February 1999 and marked the first time the band recorded or performed together since 1982, when they released their previous studio album The Hunter.

The album reached no.3 in the UK charts, shortly after the first single Maria became Blondie's sixth UK no.1 single. As was customary for a Blondie album, it dabbled in many genres, including Pop, Reggae, and Hip-Hop. Mike Chapman, who had produced all but the first two of Blondie's albums, produced some of the early demos for the album but final production of the album fell to Craig Leon.

A cover version of The Shangri-Las 1965 hit "Out in the Streets" was also included on this album. It was originally recorded by the band in 1975 while they were trying to get a record deal. The demo version was first issued on EMI's 1994 anthology The Platinum Collection and was later included on the 2001 remaster of the album Blondie.

The album spawned two UK singles, the aforementioned no.1 hit "Maria", and "Nothing Is Real But The Girl" which peaked at no.26 in the UK. A third single was released in the US, the title track "No Exit", which was a fusion of Classical, Hip-Hop and Rock, and featured raps by Mobb Deep, Coolio, U-God & Inspectah Deck
