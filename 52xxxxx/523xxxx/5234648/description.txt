Heboris C7V4EX

By far the most complete rendition of Tetris ever. Lots and lots of settings and options, making it possible to play Tetris in many different flavours.

You can select 8 different rotation rules.

HEBORIS     : TGM1 and TGM2 style. Same as original heboris rotation.
TI-ARS      : TGM3 style. T and I piece have special ground kick(It works only once!).
TI-WORLD    : SRS, you can move 10 times, or rotate 8 times.
ACE-SRS     : SRS, you can move 128 times, or rotate 128 times 
              Fast drop is slower than TI-WORLD.
ACE-ARS     : TGM-ACE style rotation rule. Really strange! 
              Fast drop is slower than TI-ARS.
ACE-ARS2    : Same as ACE-ARS, except soft drop and hard drop. 
              Fast drop is slower than TI-ARS.
DS-WORLD    : SRS, you can rotate or move infinity! 
              Fast drop is slower than TI-WORLD.
SRS-X       : Original rotation rule based on SRS. But you can use Zangi-moves!
               You can move 24 times, or rotate 12 times.
               And C-botton is "180 degree rotarion" with original wall kicks. 
D.R.S       : If you have ever played DTET,let's use this!
               Added T and I ground kick(only once!) to it.
