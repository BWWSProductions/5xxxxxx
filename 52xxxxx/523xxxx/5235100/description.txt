Kecksburg UFO Crash - What Really Happened at Kecksburg


Information:
What exactly soared through the late afternoon skies of Canada, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania on December 5, 1965? Eye witnesses described the unknown object as a "fireball," but it seemed to be under some type of intelligent control, as it veered somewhat in Ohio toward the Quaker State and finally crashed in the little Pennsylvanian town of Kecksburg. But was it our own - or was it extraterrestrial?
