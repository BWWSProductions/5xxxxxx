Please report if it works.

You can continue your file from 99,7% :)

For everyone else:

ew Release of Daikatana for Mac! (Reseed)
This release is an updated version of my previously released torrent.

What have changed?

WIDESCREEN SUPPORT!


John RomeoÂ´s (The Co-creator of Doom), biggest ad most hyped First Person Shooter.
Personally i think this game was way ahead of its time, and only got bad reviews for its difficulty.

But as John Romeo said himself: Daikatana is a Hardcore first person shooter!.

 

I have re-coded Daikatana into a Mac Version.
Everything works as it should :)



IF YOU GET THE OPENGL ERROR DO THE FOLLOWING:


1. Download this Zip (daikatanafix.zip), 3mb.

LINK: http://www.meny-graphics.dk/DaikatanaFix.zip

2. Unpack the Zip.
3. copy and overwrite the files from DaikatanaFix.zip, into the Folder Daikatana (Rightclick on the Daikatana icon, click Show Package Content.
Navigate to: Contents -> Resources -> transgaming -> c_drive -> Daikatana)

4. Launch the game! :)



Widescreen Guide!

The Default resolution is 1920x1200.

If you want to change that, you have to do it outside the game.

The first thing you need to get is an Hex Editor.
For mac,  HexFiend is Great.

Rightclick on the Daikatana icon, click Show Package Content.
Navigate to: Contents -> Resources -> transgaming -> c_drive -> Daikatana
Drag the file "daikatana.exe", to your desktop.


 Open HexFiend, and locate the Daikatana.exe file on your desktop. Open it.

Start by pressing "CMD+F", to find a line.
Write:     Mode9: 1920
And press Next.

You will now see line 739440 (The line numbers are shown to the left in the window)
The line above 739440, is line 739424.
Find number 00800700, and 00B00400 (Usually next to eachother)

The part "8007", and "B004", and the ones that need to be changed.

8007 is the screen width and B004 is the height.
Change the two numbers (When you press delete, or backspace, it removes 2 digits. Remember that!!!) , into the resolution in the table below:

For example, if i want to change my resolution to 1280 x 720, 
ill change 8007 to 0005, and B004 to D002

After you have made your change, save the file, and drag it back into the Daikatana folder. Remember to make a backup of the original Daikatana.exe, if you mess something up.


Resolutions:

_____________
1650  x   1050
