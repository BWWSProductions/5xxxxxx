BEFORE THESE CROWDED STREETS was nominated for the 1999 Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. "Crush" was nominated for the 1999 Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal. 

BEFORE THESE CROWDED STREETS is a true groove ... Full Descriptionsalad, as the D.M.B. reports in with even more creative eclecticism than usual. Guest appearances by artists as varied as Alanis Morissette, Bela Fleck and Kronos Quartet are a testament to the collage of sounds present. Occasional ventures into Middle Eastern melodicism feel as natural a part of the band's sound as do its mellow folk grooves and funky rhythm flights. The lyrics are a glad swirl of pop storytelling and trippy mystery, brought to life by the usual confluence of saxophones, violin and precise guitar work that makes this group tick. 

Over a fat backbeat, Matthews carries the clever, sultry lyrics of "Rapunzel" with a whimsical vocal blend of growls and falsetto jumps, culminating in a soprano rhapsody by hornman Leroi Moore. The funk-vamp "Stay" makes you want to do just that, featuring a joyous gospel chorus and peppery, staccato horn lines. Excellent, frenetic bowing by Kronos Quartet couples with Matthews' quick picking to drive "The Stone" to a 6/8 fury, only to be resolved with delicate grace. Morisette's lilt and Fleck's colorful banjo wrap this excellent album up tastefully on "Spoon."
