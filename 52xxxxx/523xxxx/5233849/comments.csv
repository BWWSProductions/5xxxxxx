,PeaTearGryphon,2010-01-26T07:10Z,"Just got to 96.7% done after 5 damn days of downloading. So when the dl finally finishes, I'll be seeding for a minimum of 7 days (February 2nd). Regardless of how some of those who've downloaded this series never stopped to seed for others, I'll be on for at least the next week. Cheers. And props to RealBeats for the upload."
