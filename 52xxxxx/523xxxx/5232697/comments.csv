,werdbooty,2011-02-23T19:57Z,"Dude, not sure what's what here, but none of these files will play in VLC (so I'm pretty sure it's not a codec issue). Tried in WMP and it tells me it can't read (any of) the files. They all appear to have d/l'd correctly, file size seems okay and they load fine. Just won't play. Was curious if there's something I'm missing.

Pity. Was looking forward to some learnin'."
