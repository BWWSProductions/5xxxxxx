           After "hooking up" with a series of guys at a house            
           party, April is the talk of her high school. Her best          
           friend Michelle, envious of all of April's attention,          
           decides to try and follow in her footsteps and become          
           more sexually forward. At the same time, their mutual          
           friend Caroline has become so infatuated with her older        
           boyfriend Ryan that she doesn't realize he's just using        
           her. All the while, John, spends the week informing his        
           two best friends, Colin (April's repressed and confused        
           brother) and Tyler (the subject of Michelle's crush),          
           about obscure sexual urban legends he reads about online,      
           that just somehow end up managing to come true. Throw in       
           the naive principal Dr. Jordan, who also happens to be         
           Michelle's father, and Mr. Kimbal, a chemistry teacher         
           trying desperately to dodge repeated seduction attempts        
           from his students.
