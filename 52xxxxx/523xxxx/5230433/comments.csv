,joshfb,2009-12-20T23:44Z,"yea man its workin this is how i got it too work


1.go to steamapps then click the common folder then zero gear then click the server folder DELETE everything in it

2. now go to your main MW2 folder that you downloaded from skidrow or razor then copy all those files and place them in the server folder go to steamapps/common/zero-gear/server and past them there

3. once you done that place the common folder that you downloaded from THIS torrent and replace it by putting it in steamapps/common just drag and drop it will ask you if you wanna overright it say yes

then BAMM it should work go to your games tap click zero gear and MW2 should launch and it shouldnt give you  no errors or nothing ENJOY!!!"
,alex1907,2009-12-20T23:45Z,thanx its working thx guyss!

,av8er1555,2009-12-21T03:12Z,Just like alex its kicking me after 1 min. I did everything I was supposed to.
,g1g4f3erz,2009-12-21T03:23Z,"somebody needs to make a video of this.  I did it already and it does work!

I did all this.

Installed skidrow Mw2.
installed steam
went to zerogear beta web site
entered my email address.
I got a link with a key.
in steam I activated a steam product , using they key I got.
It downloaded and installed zerogear beta.

Then you go to 
C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\zero gear\Server
and delete everything in there.

THEN you go to 
C:\Program Files\Activision\Modern Warfare 2
and select all the CUT

then you go to 
C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\zero gear\Server

and PASTE THE ENTIRE GAME IN THERE.

THEN YOU GET THE RAR FILE 
YOU EXTRACT IT ! then select it and cut 
and go to 
C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps

and PASTE 

And OVERWRITE THE FILES, or in windows 7 MERGE THE FOLDERS.

then launch steam and click in zero gear to play



"
,av8er1555,2009-12-21T03:26Z,"Sorry to upset you, but I did everything you said so maybe I should re-install mw2 and try again."
,yes13,2009-12-21T03:39Z,guys its work nice from you men thank you
,av8er1555,2009-12-21T03:49Z,"also one more question, even on a fresh install of mw2 when I go to start it and when it gets to the ""play, options, etc."" screen it freezes and only will work after I restart my computer. Why? Thx in advance. "
,av8er1555,2009-12-21T04:09Z,ok I may have figured out why I am getting kicked after 1 min. I was trying to start mw2 from the server folder cause thats the only way I can run it because if I dont choose run as admin. the game will just freeze. So I cant start it from my games on steam. I guess Im just SOL.
,bones8383,2009-12-21T04:27Z,"100% right now follow the directions to the 2 dont copy your whole mw2 folder just all the files in it to 
\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\zero gear\Server

And the extract the crack to  Program Files\Steam\steamapps

insert your drive letters in the appropriate spot
and all is good

get zero gear beta here

myzerogear(dot)com/beta/invite.php

after you get your key in your email then go to steam my games and up at the top activate game via steam then past the key and it will download automatically the zerogear game and create the directories you need."
,joshfb,2009-12-21T04:40Z,"ya this works for me and i do not get kicked ive played over hours so if it dont work for you guys then im sorry you must not being doing something right if you go back in these comments this guy named

Now again go in main folder of ""zero gear"".
Open ""ZeroGear.bat"" in !!!NOTEPAD!!! now there you can see: ""cd Server"" turn that into: ""cd ""
