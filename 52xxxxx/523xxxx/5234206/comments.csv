,mybestisntmuch,2010-06-28T19:07Z,This is most likely an idiotic question. But when you finish the download on many episodes in the title it says 'with optional audio commentary'. How the hell do you turn it off?

,PopsicleSmurf,2010-08-16T03:10Z,"The video is beautiful, and the audio for the episode WITHOUT commentary is beautiful. 
Could you please upload again WITHOUT the commentary, or at least upload it properly so we have the option to turn it off? It's obnoxious!
Thanks"

,Circling,2011-02-16T23:38Z,"When I try to play the commentary-episodes vlc says its an undf and it can't play them...

,zaedon,2012-01-03T13:39Z,"So what's up with the audio commentary? I can't hear it, some people can't turn it off. This is mental.

Neither WMP or VLC gave me the audio commentary."
