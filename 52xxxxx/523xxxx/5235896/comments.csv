This torrent is great, it is small, fast to download and it is totally clean, scanned with Kaspersky AND bitdefender.

Unable to open packed file store.pf
O.O"
,darkhorsemp,2010-01-24T20:57Z,PLEASE INSERT DISK
,immapirateyay,2011-01-29T04:02Z,"chaosbib, you don't open the file, you have to extract it to a folder using winrar or 7zip, or some extracting/unzipping program. Look up WinRar on this site once you have winrar google how to extract a file to a folder using THAT program, then run the .exe folder and play. Don't install. If this doesn't work, and the game crashes, try that link Oreo commented. If it still doesn't work, there might be a problem with the file."
,immapirateyay,2011-01-29T04:13Z,"What is the verdict? Does this work? I saw in another upload (in a comment)  this needs a patch to work. It seems some people are having a 'insert disc' error. Is this just due to noobz not knowing how to mount a .iso? Does this work properly? & most of all, can you play online with others?"
