i know urnt taking ne request till 2010 .
but plz can u make exception for 
MOVE LIKE MICHAEL JACKSON SERIES ..
i just heard about it yesterday and m very exited about it but on net all rips are 700mb per episdo for just40-50 min duration :("
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-23T10:03Z,"@htctouch:  ""Move..."" has 6 parts, each is 700 MB. Even with H264 compression it would be 6 times ~250 MB = 1.5 GB.
Right now (and for sure in foreseeable future) I cannot upload such big packs.
I understand that originals in XviD format have 4.2 GB which makes them too big for majority, but... 1.5 GB doesn't sounds too attractive, even if almost three times smaller...
Sorry."
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-23T10:08Z,"However, I CAN up them one-by-one, when situation arise... that's best I can. (BTW, I have them all six...)"
,htctouch,2009-12-23T21:23Z,that would be great even if u post it 1 by 1 . no problem . i think uploading 250 mb file torrent at a time would be no big deal for u and would b much easier than downloading the whl bunch togthr
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-25T08:33Z,"@htctouch: I just finished re-encoding to H264 first three parts... and here are the news :.)
- 182 MB, 184 MB and 193 MB (differs in durations)
- Input was only one available: watbath's XviDs which were BAD (as always, I must say)
- Output is - shitty (pardon my French), 'cause ""GarbageInGarbageOut"" - that's why I keep repeating that my inputs MUST be 720p or other HQ...

Only thing why someone should download re-encodings is small file-size (six parts under 1.1 GB) and 6 XviDs are 4.2 GB.

So, htctouch, I will wait for your word - should I proceed or not. You may want to look at 1st episode, and then to decide - I'll up that one if you say so...
So - speak to me, I'm reluctant to up some ""problematic"" encodings."
