Discovery.Channel.The.New.Roswell.The.Shag.Harbour.UFO.Incident.PDTV.XviD.SWESUB-APB


Information:
An extraordinary event in 1967 would practically put the small fishing village of Shag Harbor on the map. Located at the southern tip of Nova Scotia, this rural community would be host to one of the best documented UFO events of the past 40 years.


The episode is a PDTV rip so the quality is not at its highest, but its still very watchable.

Please stay patience and SEED after download.

Enjoy!
