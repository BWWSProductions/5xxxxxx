i just cut them off with mkvmerge :P
but i only dl files from him that hare 1.78:1 or 1.85:1, so they have no black boarders. like groundhog day for example. :)"

[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-26T19:44Z,I tried to upload Crimson tide 3 times here and ''Torrent already exist in the system'' appears.What's wrong with the site ??
,T-Fish,2009-12-26T19:52Z,"@kriss..  that message means that the hash value already exists in the database. if you delete a torrent yourself, the hash stays and only a mod can remove it. thats so that virus torrents can't be reuploaded.
you can create a new torrent file so the hash value changes or get a mod to delete it from the database.

atm though, there seems to be a bug. have a read here:

[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-26T20:00Z,How can the hash value remain when this was the first time I tried to upload the torrent? I didn't delete nothing.WTF?
,T-Fish,2009-12-26T20:31Z,"yes, theres a bug atm. check the forum topic i linked.

i only stated what the error means, normally."
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-26T22:18Z,Untill the problem is solved and I can upload it here you can get the movie from a.h.a.s.h.a.r.e and e.x.t.r.a.t.o.r.r.e.n.t.
[T],margelaturau,2010-01-03T19:39Z,Do not download anything??? Active torrent???
