Hope your initiative will save some time... finding a good rs/mu link is not that easy."
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-23T14:14Z,"@afzaldu: However, warez-sites offer .mkv as small-sized files. It is too exclusive, for the people who watch only on PCs. I am not aware of any decent .mkv capable standalone. My encodings are native for PS3 (HDMI cable to WideScreen TV is the best), XBox and Mac. Any PC is capable of mp4 playback... not to mention iPods and clones (without ridiculous 320x240 frame-size offered as ipod standard on most warez-sites). I dare to say - my encodings are better, more consistent, more contemporary and - more compatible."

OK, that's was maybe a little too much. :o

Critique: 25fps, Picture: ~0.5Mps, Audio: ~66kbps.
It works fine here at my 25"" TV. Don't worry, I am happy. :)
h264 are really impressive, and your work have improved since Shrink, the picture is great here, the colour balance are more correct and sharper, and not so washed out. (sorry I forgot to add a comment there)
Of course a DVD is better, but it's 10% smaller with 95% of the quality! Really impressive.


Can I suggest three things?
1: Tell us about the framerate so I (and others) can search for subtitles and get the correct one for the correct framerate? 
2: Omitting the [ ], my computer dont like it. Can I suggest ( ) ?
3: Can the ""HDTV"" as suggested here be wrong as it's only 360p? I don't deny the fact that the source is HDTV, but I have never seen a DVDrip marked as DVD.
It may be better and ""correct"" to mark it as HDTVrip or marking it as 20-40 so we can see that it's quality? You're good enought to use your own name as a tag
for highly compressed films from good sources. :)

Oh yeah, here is danish subtitle, it works fine, it's 25fps
http://www.opensubtitles.org/no/subtitles/200224/clueless-da

As long the  framerate is correct, it doesn't matter which release the subtitle is aimed to use with. ( I don't usually need to adjust the delay as nobody cuts out the beginning in the films. phew!)

I prefer english subtitles, so I found it, I haven't tested it yet. http://subscene.com/clueless/subtitles-1661.aspx -> http://subscene.com/english/clueless/subtitle-153133.aspx ->  it's the same as the HDTV source.

Keep on the good work!  :D :D :D :D "

It works really great and saves a lot of space of my shelves. These boxes are spreading now."
