,afghanballer,2010-01-06T05:14Z,"Great Quality Team_xRG but this was the first repack of yours that I see subtitles come couple seconds late than when they actually talk. I really don't speak Hindi so the subtitles kinda pisses me off since it comes about 2-4 seconds after they say it. Do you have a better subtitle file? Anyways 

V=10
A=10
Subtitle- A bit late"
