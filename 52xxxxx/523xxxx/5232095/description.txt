This is a fantastic boxset that contains all four Magnificent Seven westerns that have been fully restored!!
Packed with action and great actors including Yul Brenner, Charles Bronson, Lee van Cleef, James Coburn and Warren Oates to name just a few!
These brilliant westerns are up with some of the greats like Big Country, Rio Bravo etc.. and were first made in 1960! Now nearly 50 years on they still hugely entertaining for all and will be watched many times!
I picked this boxset up for Â£12.99 which is a steal as it's worth much, much more and was a must have addition to my massive western collection!
If you have never seen these then this boxset is definately worth checking out as i am sure that you will not be at all dissappointed!!
