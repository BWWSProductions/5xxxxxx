,Eddisofbextar,2009-12-20T19:44Z,"seems a lot of ppl with nvidia cards having the same issues on steam.... not sure if its something to do with physx or drivers.

i have had more luck changing the desktop rez to the game rez, as well as turning off autosave - not sure if this will work for long tho."

Not a clean patch. Do not download."
,609team,2009-12-22T15:50Z,"False postive, gave it a scan before uploading."
,RobertBrink,2009-12-22T20:57Z,What did you scan it with?
,609team,2009-12-23T15:43Z,"VirusTotal.com gave it 12,2%, so that is a false positive."
,Nawlsome,2010-02-17T20:33Z,"I extracted and scanned the patch exe with spybot, malwarebytes and bitdefender.

All 3 came up clean.

False positive."
,hal9002,2010-02-26T22:24Z,Blue Screen of Death upon loading... Any solutions?
,jonlooy,2010-06-13T02:28Z,"worked well for me. Cheers.
Installed slightly slowly thats all. No real problems so far, but I've only played for the first 9 seasons.

Any chance you'll release more patches in the future?"
