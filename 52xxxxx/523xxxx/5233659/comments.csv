,at12,2009-12-22T03:42Z,thx!! it works well. gj Ryanz15 : )
,3somme,2009-12-22T05:03Z,why does it says that my base game base       (v1.7.9) is not compatible with this expansion pack after updating??
,Ryanz15,2009-12-22T10:42Z,"@ 3somme,
I think you might need this patch aswell for the original Sims 3 (not the expansion pack)
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5234433
I just uploaded it.
Hope it works!"
,xoniva,2009-12-22T13:17Z,"Thats great, thx dude"
,degtop,2009-12-22T15:23Z,It crashes at loading screen for me :/
,Cajar_Queen,2009-12-22T19:47Z,"The updated game will play now with this patched crack but it's still not worth it to upgrade.
1) No EA custom content will install (game region checks Store Content Now?)
2) Old save files with that content now won't load"
,Sargroth,2009-12-24T23:48Z,"Thanks for uploading.
But I got a huge problem, while running the game!
I have installed this game with latest patch, and when I open the game, it goes to the black loading screen, then I have to select my saved game/or create new. When I have selected one of them, the game starts loading in about 10-15 seconds, but suddenly crash and return to the desktop with no error messages and so on. 
Its very weird, and I wonder what it is, cause I really wanna play the game. Thank you so far :)"
,YLEN,2009-12-25T20:59Z,"did anyone manage to update? i get an invalid file error at 97%. i've installed, reinstalled many times but it doesn't work. "
,skullo,2009-12-26T15:01Z,im getting the same
,Ryanz15,2009-12-27T09:45Z,"Well im not an expert but here goes:
Im geussing that your playing World adventures with a crack yes? Well im not sure but have you removed the crack? If you have, have you tried to install another update to World Adventures before and did it work? Do you mean you reinstalled the GAME? And did you try reinstalling the original 'The Sims 3'?

Because I dont know what the problem is otherwise, works fine for me and others.

Hope I can help you."
,YLEN,2009-12-27T12:08Z,"i have a fresh install, no mods or cracks yet.
sims 3 updates fine to version 1.8.25. 
then i install WA and i have verion 2.0.86, i run the next update and it gives me an error at 97%.
i used the patch log viewer to check for the invalid file and it said everything's o.k. don't know what i'm missing
"
,brody77,2009-12-27T16:24Z,"Tried installing world adventures umpteen times now to no avail.
Keeps giving me an ""invalid file found"" error right at the end of the update.
It's doing my head in now."
,Ryanz15,2009-12-27T17:34Z,"Well what might work is unistalling everything to do with the sims 3 + WA, then install The Sims 3 and then install WA but go into the sims 3 launcher and try updating through there? It should update twice and then put the crack in to WA and play?

Not sure though, give it a go and tell me what happens."
,YLEN,2009-12-28T02:31Z,"still the same. now i'm downloading another WA torrent, in case something's wrong with the one i already have. because during WA installation i get a few  mistakes and have to hit ignore 6 times before it completes. there may be a corrrupt file in the torrent but i won't discover soon since  downloading takes for ever  "
,percocetprincess,2009-12-28T06:29Z,"can someone please tell me where the update file is? i can't even find that and i've been looking for two hours. 

thanks"
,YLEN,2009-12-28T12:44Z,are you looking for the file to change the update version?                     C/electronic arts /world adventures/game/bin/default
,degtop,2009-12-28T14:39Z,Does anyone know how to fix the crashing problem(black loading screen and then selecting new and it crashes after 10-15 seconds of loading time). If soo can they post a fix for it?
,glasswings21,2009-12-29T15:09Z,"Isn't that old original file suppose to have the host.dll file to it otherwise it would be giving invalid file found error i believe as the crack for the WA i used on this _2.0.86.002002 version had it,is there a way you can put the host.dll file on this upload becuase for me it doesn't work just says invalid file found again and again."
,YLEN,2009-12-29T20:56Z,"i've also figured out that the problem is the host.dll file. can someone upload the old original, please?"
,Myersguy,2009-12-31T06:22Z,"You need to replace your TSLhost.dll with the original found on the disk. I am too lazy to upload it, but you should still have your ISO or DVD around, right?

If you do, go into the game folder of the WA disk, and just copy over the TSLHost.dll, and the patch should work."
,cavallo_dorato,2010-01-01T21:42Z,"Hi guys. The game with this patch and crack work for me, but just with the emulation of the WA cd. Did you know why? I think we must to have the .dll cracked also and it isn't in this torrent.
For update the patch I disintalled and reinstalled the sims 3 and wa for make it work."
,cavallo_dorato,2010-01-02T02:36Z,"Me too, like Cajar_Queen, I can't see the costum content of ea store. Please can anyone answer to me?"
,Ryanz15,2010-01-02T14:27Z,"Well we found out that this patch removes all custom content and store content which you havn't purchased with your own points. Dont know how they have don it but they have, so if you want the sims store and stuff dont update to this patch, but if you dont care about the sims store stuff and want a lot of bugs fixed then update."
,Insane_Whiteboy,2010-01-03T03:34Z,"Worked great, thanx"
,2sweet4ya,2010-02-05T21:34Z,please seed :)
