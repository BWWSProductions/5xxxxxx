Cheers,

,droctagonwa,2010-01-18T18:34Z,"I find it strange how people get upset when you point out problems with a torrent, it's actually kind of important imo. 
Not that it's not important to thank people for the upload of course ^_^

Anyways with this torrent having folders inside the zip files stops you reading them as .cbr or .mga (manga reader) format which is a minor nuisance.

Secondly the files arent named in numerical order, e.g. chapter 1 is called ""Naruto 1.zip"" (and contains a folder called ""Naruto 1"") instead of ""Naruto 001"", so the chapters are out of whack which is again a minor nuisance. 

Pointing things like this out doesnt mean im bitching or being ungrateful, it means im giving constructive criticism. Im not that fussed about having to rename 99 folders to get them back in order, but I'd prefer not to you know?

Thanks for the upload tho Dragonlight2, I will be seeding this for a while ^_^"
