                    Dad.                                     
                    Comedy series set in and around a travelling  
                    circus. Lizzie is on cloud nine after learning  
                    that her circus has a chance to perform in the  
                    opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.  
                    But she's quickly brought down to earth when  
                    she hears Erasmus's elaborate plan to get her  
                    dad out of prison to dig up some cash in order  
                    to fund the global event. As Lizzie waits for  
                    her dad to visit, why is she so sure he'll be  
                    the answer to her problem?
