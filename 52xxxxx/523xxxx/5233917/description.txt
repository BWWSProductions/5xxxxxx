Microsoft Security Essentials...this includes the file for XP and Vista.
It also works with Windows 7,  just use the vista version.

I got this during the closed beta and decided to put it online...I have tested it on Windows XP Vista and 7 without any problems whatsoever, It is an okay free alternative to other security suits and works great alongside with the default windows security programs.

ENJOY!
