Wikipedia - 1962â€“1966 (widely known as The Red Album) is a compilation of The Beatles' greatest hits from 1962 to 1966. It was released with 1967â€“1970 (The Blue Album), a compilation of their greatest hits from 1967 to 1970. 1962â€“1966 reached #3 in the UK and managed to reach #1 in the U.S. Cashbox albums chart. However, in the U.S. the official chart was administered by Billboard, where 1962â€“1966 peaked at #3, while 1967â€“1970 managed to meet the summit. This album was re-released in September 1993 charting at #3 in the UK. The album was compiled by Beatles manager Allen Klein, with his selections approved by the Beatles themselves. Even though the group had had success with cover versions of songs, most notably with "Twist and Shout", which made #2 on the Billboard charts, only songs composed by The Beatles themselves were included. It is recognised as the first Beatles compilation since their breakup on 31 December 1970. Both it and 1967â€“1970 were produced by Apple/EMI at least partially in response to a bootleg compilation titled Alpha Omega, which had been sold on television the previous year

Amazon.com Review By Bill Holdship - The closest the Beatles came to a greatest hits package, this document of the early part of their career features hit singles (in chronological order) and selected album tracks, running from "Love Me Do" through the groundbreaking Rubber Soul and Revolver albums. While this may be an excellent intro for beginners, real fans will never be content with only selections, especially when you're dealing with those aforementioned albums. Capitol packages the collection on two discs, copying the original vinyl version--but, of course, CDs hold more music than records did. Still, you do get 26 bona fide classics, so there's no real need to complain. -
