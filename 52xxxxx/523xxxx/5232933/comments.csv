,Andreas_the,2010-01-03T15:49Z,"Hello.
Great torrent.
But I have a problem, when i play this in VLC it works but when i try to ""fast forward"" (dont know the english word) VLC crashes.
Anyone knows a solution?"
,Basssk,2010-01-04T03:36Z,"I have the exact same problem as Andreas above. I use VLC to play these .mkv files and it works perfectly fine with great, really great video and audio. Just untill I want to go forward or backwards, because then it crashes. 

I wish the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame brought this concert out on DVD. I'd be willing to pay 20 euros for this concert. But now I had to download it and it doesn't work completely. Please help. "
,Basssk,2010-01-04T03:39Z,"Oh, and to Infliction91:
Yes it is the full concert. This file with a total length of over 4 hours covers all the sets as described below. It skips some audience applauds and introductions though, but that's just the way the Hall of Fame presented this concert apparently"
,websterguy,2010-01-04T21:20Z,"@infliction

Yes, it's the full concert as broadcast on HBO.  They actually cut out a lot of the songs from the original 2 days to make the broadcast, but, as basssk said, it's still 4 hours of good material.

@Andreas and Bassk

Sorry, I have no problems fast forwarding, rewinding, or skipping around in VLC."
,Andreas_the,2010-01-04T21:40Z,"@Basssk

I solved it :)
Just downloaded the latest version of vlc."
,Basssk,2010-01-09T15:12Z,Thanks for the tip Andreas. Too bad I'm running on Tiger Mac OS and the latest VLC requires new operating sytem. Maybe I should get Leopard first...
,milax1,2010-01-30T16:05Z,"one word..amazing.
Thanks you uploaders, without you we would missed things like this."
,Teddster,2010-05-11T13:59Z,"I watched that on TV and it's amazing!
I'm downloading now with crazy speed (up to 1.2 mb/s) and I will be seeding for a long time after the download is finished.
Thanks for this torrent!"

,tcollacott,2011-03-09T22:41Z,Thank you SOOOOOO much!!!
,hero4all,2011-10-17T20:59Z,does anyone know how you can burn the movie?
[T],thetorrentlord,2012-01-21T19:44Z,@hero4all: I use a free program called BDtoAVCHD which will burn the file to BLU-RAY format on what ever size disc you choose and all you have to do is pop it into your Bluray player and it will start automatically. You can download it for free at (www.videohelp.com).
[T],thetorrentlord,2012-01-21T19:46Z,@spijkkie: See the previous comment.
