,Scam13een,2009-12-30T11:40Z,"Hi Pelicanman, thanks for the upload. Cheers!.

P.S. Do I need to burn this on a CD to run? Or will Daemon tools / PowerISO mounting do? 

Regards & Respect.

,HPH5,2010-03-25T17:06Z,"Anyone else missing the CUE file in the CD2 folder ?

Mounted CD1 one without any problem, game installed. Applied crack and patch, but when starting game it asks for CD2. But only a BIN file in that folder."
,ef1,2010-04-27T16:19Z,"@HPH5 : I'm missing that cue file too.
Does anyone know why?"
,Duke_32,2010-05-07T13:24Z,"Missing .cue file in ""CD 2"" : 
You can use the .cue file in  CD1 to use CD2
1. copy and paste the cue file in ""CD1"" to the folder ""CD2""
2. open the .cue file using 'notepad' (or any text editor)
3. you will see the name of the bin file in CD1. rewrite it with the name of the bin file in CD2 (flt-rt3b.bin)
4. save the .cue file
5. .cue file for CD2 is ready !!"
,Duke_32,2010-05-07T13:27Z,"BTW, CD2 is required only if you wanna play the bonus game named  ""loco Commotion"". Its a 3D puzzle game."
,supafly1,2010-05-13T01:09Z,"When I press ""Install RT3"", nothing happens... HALP!"

,PunkzZz,2010-07-01T17:10Z,"@e166743  

I have the same problem :(

The game shuts down whenever i'm playing :S"
,StevoEntity,2010-07-06T15:56Z,"Okay, if theres anyone who still needs help, I have got this working on Vista 32 bit. I did have the same problem as everyone else, but it now works fine.

1 - Mount CD1 and install the game.

2 - Mount CD2.

3 - Install the Patch to your RT3 directory.

4 - Download and install the 1.03 patch.
http://www.filefront.com/1600226/Railroad-Tycoon-3-v1.03-Patch/

5 - Ignor the crack from this torrent. Download this one, then replace the original .EXE with it.
http://m0003.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_railroad_tycoon_3.shtml#Railroad Tycoon 3 v1.0 [ENGLISH] No-CD/Fixed EXE

6 - Run as Admin AND in compatibility mode for XP SP 2.

This works for me, hope it helps everyone else :)"
,mucgoo,2010-07-14T19:40Z,Stevo method work to avoid an opening crash(on windows 7?).nThanks
,Cubee89,2010-09-06T19:43Z,all i can say is you lot are idiots i have had no problems with this torrent what so ever all i had to do extra is do the compatibility mode for XP SP 2 like stevo said and well duke is a idiot and went the long way about it as you can mount bin files with daemon tools this is a great upload thanks Pelicanman :) i use windows 7 ulti 64 bit 
,chief_petty,2010-10-10T16:33Z,"cubee wrote all i can say is you lot are idiots i have had no problems with this torrent.

well, I don't consider myself an idiot. I have used several games from this site and am well versed in using 'daemon tools lite'
I have read all the comments and tried _each_ _and_ _every_ _suggestion_. 
this game will not work with my (Vista) set up"
,apollo777,2010-10-11T07:35Z,Followed StevoEntity's guide and worked perfectly. 
,Clarkey2012,2010-10-17T13:47Z,"ok...lol

1. I have mounted both discs.
2. It keeps saying wrong disc inserted, so i mount the other and says same thing.
3. I cant download winzip (keeps screwing me over) to unzip the crack+patch
4. What do i do with the crack"
,Werkrat,2010-11-08T15:13Z,"W7 Ultimate 64 bit, tried XP (sp 2 compatibility), ran as administrator, etc etc...

Got the game installed fine, patched, cracked, no matter what I try it crashes. I give up on this one."
,Werkrat,2010-11-08T15:22Z,"Ha! So I assumed I should patch 1.05 (also the 1.0.5 no-cd fix), this assumption was wrong.

Used patch 1.03 and the no-cd fix for 1.0 and it worked just fine, surprisingly.

If only someone had put this info into a step by step format *cough*STEVO*cough* :/

p.s. sorry for assuming those version differences were typos ;)"
,FadedDesign,2010-11-17T09:35Z,"Works great on Win7x64. Thank you.

Opened Power ISO.
Opened Disk 1.
Opened setup folder.
Clicked Setup.exe
Installed.
Opened disk 2.
Extracted cracked exe to railroad tycoon folder.
Stop playing to say thanks.
Will seed."
,MrEncrypted,2011-02-15T20:17Z,Works fine on Win 7 x86 Not 1 single problem.
,fabjnkn33,2011-04-19T19:34Z,Oh yes it works I went with Stevo's advice thanks Pelicanman
,illwrath,2011-04-26T01:55Z,"Tried installing this but I can't speak fuckin Italian.

Tell me what I'm doing wrong and guide me to the English installation.

That or consider this a downvote."
,mrphotography,2011-05-02T06:26Z,"if this works itll be brilliant :)

cheers"
,Daether,2011-05-06T11:38Z,"If someone still has problems with Vista 32 bit or want to add the coast to coast expansion:

1. Mount CD1 and install the game

2. Download and install Coast to Coast (can be found easily)

3. Install patch 1.05

3. Download 1.05 Crack and replace original .exe with it. http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=942 Crack for Version 1.05 ENG

4. Run as admin and in compatibility mode with XP SP2

(The crack and CD2 in this torrent are useless)"
,msernst,2011-06-02T19:14Z,"where the F**K is the setup or install file? I have the contents of each folder (minus the crack folder) on a disc and all i have is a .bin and a .cue on the first disc...neither of which I can do anything with.

I don't really consider myself an idiot like some other jackass on here pointed out that most of us apparently are...but how the hell am I supposed to use this if I can't install it?"
,poo4532,2011-06-02T21:22Z,"Super fast dl of about 15min! Works flawlessly but did require a little work to get running.  Here's what I did (W7 64bit):

1) Mount CD1 and install
2) Unzip patch file into directory (just replaces exe with updated version)
3) Unzip cracked exe in other zip file and replace in install directory
4) Enjoy!

CD2 is unnecessary to install main game. I'll seed until I reach 10x.  Thanks for the upload. Fun game but steep learning curve."
,fight4anarchy,2011-06-26T14:00Z,good torrent and good download follow the instructions and it works like a charm. will seed for a month.
,hagamablabla,2011-06-30T04:32Z,"It didn't tell me that I needed a disc 2, but when I try to run it it just gets an error and goes back to desktop. Tried almost everything here."
,master620,2011-07-12T10:01Z,"Game doesn't work, Tried everything here, and in no way some incompetent idiot. Have gotten hundreds of games, and have done everything possible to get this to work, but just keeps crashing the moment you start up.  NOT WORTH THE TIME AND TROUBLE TO DOWNLOAD."
,master620,2011-07-12T10:08Z,"Oh, and to the people who keep posting ""oh use this crack, it works"", please freaking stop, you are simply just pointing people to the SAME CRACK used in this torrent. 

So far every crack that has been ""linked"" in these comments, are all for the Vengeance Crack, which obviously is not working for practically EVERYONE.

Running as Admin, setting the compatibility mode, writing your own launching file, tinkering with the game's startup files, and various other things, just simple do not work with this game. If you were lucky enough to get it to work, then congratulations, you are some miracle special exception to it all."

,man0cels0,2011-10-09T20:53Z,"[SOLVED] - For people who loved this game and can't play on win 7 or vista. This page solved my problems.

http://hawkdawg.com/rrt/rrt3/rrt3.htm

The solution offered was in 2 steps for me,

First - to install the 1.05 patch, you have to have installed the Coast to Coast Expansion before.

Second - there is a vista fix, they have there, which serves only to disable the h & l hardware acceleration, which in turn solves all compatibility problems apparently.

Now I can finally go play! Hope it helps out!"
,Martarse,2011-12-06T16:48Z,Cheers Man0cels0; Fix works perfectly!
,ihackett,2011-12-26T19:25Z,"Followed man0cels0's steps, and the game works perfectly! Fast download, easy steps, and great game! +1 and seeding"
,Odinspawn,2011-12-29T22:23Z,well the only problem i cannot seem to Get by is the error message When im installing this game I looked at the other comments and did not find anything that helps with that problem welcome to any suggestions that can help with WVista
,russvirus,2012-01-29T18:53Z,Thanks man it works like a champ.
,PrivateGames,2012-03-19T23:02Z,"Rate up from me, It worked after i used the vista fix from http://hawkdawg.com/rrt/rrt3/rrt3.htm Credits to man0cels0 for the link"
,richardmaiden,2012-06-06T05:27Z,thanks man0cels0 you fix my game! works very fine!!
