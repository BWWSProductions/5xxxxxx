The story of a year in the life of six young people, each episode repeating the same period of time but each episode seen from a different character perspective. Like pieces of a puzzle, it is not until everything is put together that we see a complete picture and reveal how each of our characters lives have been intertwined with each other in exciting and unpredictable ways.


After a couple of weeks of searching for, unzipping and sifting through all these Iâ€™ve eventually managed to complete, uncorrupted, the full set and upload them together. So finally you can sit back and watch, laugh, cry, love, hate, pity and scratch your head at each of the characters in turn. With the added bonuses of no need to unzip files and free of viruses both of which have been a consummate pain in the ass with this.

Enjoy and seed. Cheers
