Today we released IsoBuster 2.7 with following new cool features and improvements:

Changes:

    * Support for interleaved files in the ISO9660 / Joliet file-system (rare but it can happen)
    * Support for Right to Left reading languages and their optimized language dlls
    * Proper print functionality from the View/Edit text window (formatting, copies, collate etc.)


Improvements:

    * Hard coded ignore of drive "HUAWEI Mass Storage" which is a USB modem with CDFS and which returns drive type CDROM, but it behaves badly and causes crashes
    * Implemented *.cwk file-type recognition for found files based on their signature
    * Ctrl-p (Print) and Ctrl-s (Save) implemented in the View/Edit text window
    * Implemented ability to read raw on DVD in [Business] mode when the disc is Blank (some rare drives allow this on readable media without TOC, but they return user data, which is then remapped to raw by IsoBuster)
    * Program start-up speed improved by skipping network drives to avoid long delays
    * Create MD5 of image filename dialog improved
    * Various other GUI improvements


Fixes:

    * In rare cases, on Windows OS with particular settings, the program would start with an "Invalid code page" error. This has been fixed
    * Fixed issue that made the online check occur despite the user saying No
    * Fixed it so that the nag screen doesn't show at the first try
    * Fix in CueSheet handling to better deal with image files containing different block sizes per track
