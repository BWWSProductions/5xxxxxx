Is it the biggest hoax?or the most important story in human history?

Now you can decide for yourself!

The long awaited, new, feature length documentary on the Billy Meier case is finally here! Now, for the first time, you?ll see and hear Billy Meier?s life story in his own words!


You?ll see photos and films of:

? Meier handling the infamous laser pistol!

? Multiple UFOs and a UFO hovering?over Meier?s head!

? A demonstration of a recent magnetic levitation invention that proves Meier?s UFOs are the real thing!

? Scientific examination of the UFO sounds and metal samples!

? The apple grown more than 30 years ago?in a Plejaren space ship!

? The secret Nazi UFO?used with devastating results against Allied bombers in WWII!

I am on the same path as you about this eduard meier, all predictions made has already happened, so thetre is no more predicitions out and so nothing can be prooven that way.

The Gulf Oil spill was not mentioned with a single word, and in some old films with meier there is no prediction what so ever of what is about to come, and did come.

So I think he is cheap.

Also the ""craft"" with the marbles around the edge has a bottom that looks precisely as the cover of those 200 litres blue barrels with black caps.

Only thing looking good is the films of the hovering crafts in the landscape of his country taken in 1970's....

I prefer Nation press club and some of Jaime maussan's material, tho the later ones surely has some hoaxes too."
