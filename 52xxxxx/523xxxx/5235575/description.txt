Adam Maxwell's first collection of short stories is inventive, funny, dark, and hugely entertaining. 

Effortlessly fusing pop culture, gunplay, and simians, Dial M For Monkey contains a vibrant mixture of short stories - and short-short stories including 'Happiness is a Warm Gun' which featured in McSweeney's Internet Tendency.
