Arctic Roughnecks (2009)

Get behind the wheel of the CATCO - a rough-and-tough, take-no-prisoners ATV that's more tank than truck - with the premiere of ARCTIC ROUGHNECKS. Hauling fuel, freight and equipment to the farthest reaches of the Alaskan north, these trucks - and the battle-hardened men who drive them - work on the edge of civilization, enduring some of the harshest climates and terrain on Earth. There are no roads in the remote, uninhabitable region 400 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle, so the men of Alaska Interstate Construction build an ice road to transport a massive oil rig. Then the roughnecks of Crowley CATCO use their specialized vehicles to cross terrain so treacherous, it's off-limits to even the ice road truckers. Death is just an icy turn away, as they haul their cargo to the ends of the Alaskan frontier.
