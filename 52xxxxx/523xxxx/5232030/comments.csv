[T],sig_garrett,2009-12-21T18:59Z,"abcd-she: thanks for your interaction, posts and inquiries. Ironically you should ask. Arrangements are being made to resume truthnews.info  --  maybe sometime around the first of the year.

Unfortunately truthnews.info's progenitor, TJ7, has not had the time to dedicate to the site's upkeep and maintanence. Please stay tuned and with a little luck you will see truthnews.info resurrected before too long.  :)

Are you looking for help with that project, sig?

I could probably contribute a little time, if you're interested.  It's a great site and I would like to see it continue.
