,CarlWilfilUranus,2010-02-23T17:27Z,"I think according to most jurisdictions, if the image is intended to portray/represent an underage person involved in any act that could be depicted as ""sexual"" (or sexually inappropriate!) and is in public (or private) domain, it is regarded as ""child porn"". In other words, if Grandma Mabel were to pose half nude in a school uniform or in a skimpy negligee sucking on (say) a lollipop as though she were a preschooler, it could be interpreted as child porn. I could be wrong, but I remember reading this somewhere. I suppose it all depends upon how one interprets what one sees. They've yet to come up with an unambiguous, objective legal definition of ""Obscene"", ""Moral"", ""Prurient Taste"", etc., but convictions are, nevertheless, based upon such factors! Hope this helps."
