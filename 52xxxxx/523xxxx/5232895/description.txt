SYNOPSIS:

Something of a cult item among British war movies, The Dam Busters 
turns a minor World War II incident into a heroic saga in the 
classic British style. A bombing raid is proposed on a strategically 
vital dam, but its position is inaccessible. Enter eccentric 
inventor Dr Barnes Wallis (Michael Redgrave in best daffy 
professor mode) who comes up with a genius idea--a bomb that will 
bounce on water like a skimmed pebble. Naturally the 
top brass dismiss it, but gallant Wing Commander Guy Gibson 
(Richard Todd) is persuaded, and he and Wallis forge ahead.
