                    Period drama. Miss Matty's house is full of  
                    life and bustle. Her dream of having a child in  
                    the house has been realised with the birth of  
                    Tilly, daughter of her maid Martha and   
                    carpenter Jem. Elsewhere, the shadow of the  
                    railway still looms, but the line has been  
                    halted five miles outside of Cranford - a  
                    disaster for the town, in Captain Brown's view.  
                    And as Lady Ludlow waits for her son Septimus  
                    to return from Italy, Harry Gregson is sent  
                    away to school.
