,GRSHOPR,2009-12-20T20:00Z,@Gethyper: Try using tsMuxer. Makes it worlds easier to embed subtitles.
,HeWillSeeTheBigBoard,2009-12-22T14:32Z,thank you. also can only of you do leon the professional? thanx!
,dkporn,2009-12-22T16:46Z,@PS3-TEAM - how would you suggest I convert some of your earlier MP4/AAC releases to M2TS/AC3? I can only get 2.0 sound with my media player and sound system when using AAC.
,tommyVercetti,2009-12-22T20:51Z,"Ok, got a question...

I can't seem to get these files to work on a ps3 anymore. The file sizes for all newer PS3-TEAM torrents seem to be 4.26gb. This means that sometimes I can't get them on a fat32 drive, and all attempts at streaming them to ps3, either to copy or play, fail.

Anyone got any ideas? I'm downloading and streaming with a black Macbook OS 10.6.2, running Elgato EyeConnect or Medialink (tried both). I can *sometimes* copy the files to a 500gb MyBook, or iPod, but the files will not show up when I plug the HDD or iPod into the PS3 (and yes, I hit triangle and ""display all""). I also rename the file extensions as .mp4, otherwise the PS3 completely fails to recognize them.

Any help, please?"

Thanks for the help."
