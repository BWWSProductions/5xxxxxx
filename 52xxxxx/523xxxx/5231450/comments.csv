You're getting a great quality rip of the entire season, for free...the LEAST you could do is share it with others. "
,maconga,2010-01-12T05:08Z,"Lets try this, if you need/want more pieces.

This is going to seem 'abit' tricky, if you got a extra 65GB of hard drive space, create a exact copy of this torrent to

C:/torrent/Star Trek TNG

Now....

Open utorrent, click Options then Preference, now click the Directory tab, now change the new downloads too ""C:/torrent/Star Trek TNG""
then add the other star trek torrents by this person. you MUST let it rescan, then just leave them all running (except this 65GB one) and hopefully, you will get more pieces.

This will work, i do stuff like this to help bad torrents with people at like 60% and no seeds. "

,RedMatrix,2010-12-19T07:53Z,"Nevermind my last comment. It was an incomplete download, and my player picked something from my library to play."
