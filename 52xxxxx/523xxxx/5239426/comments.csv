,Gomaramp,2009-12-25T15:01Z,"Remove Tropic thunder from that wishlist,remembered it had already been done.Thanks;)"
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-25T18:53Z,"Madagascar has been done as well.

@taz: Merry Christmas to you as well! And I believe Brick uploaded The Island, and in that comment thread, there's a list of what I have read to upload."

Hello GRSHOPR.

I Have not Yet Tried Your Rips.
Thanks A Lot For All Your Hard Works.

I Have A Question.
Other PS3 Members Keep 1920X1080 Resolution.
But You Have 1920X800/1920X816.
Can You Please Explain?

[V],HMVinyl,2009-12-26T02:06Z,"i imagine thats the films native resolution, and they didnt crop anything"
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-26T03:07Z,"Sure, Jag. In a 1080p resolution, the dimensions of the screen (in number of lines, vertical X horizontal), is 1920x1080. Every movie that is 1080p/i will always fit the width of the screen (1920), so that's where that measurement comes from. However, dependent on the type of letterboxing and cropping that the producers used, determines the size of the height. If you watch different aspect ratios closely, you'll notice the size of the black bars on top and bottom vary, dependent on the ratio. I happen to use an older version of the program than the rest of the team, just as a personal preference. The newer version has the option of automatically using black filler lines for the bars on top and bottom, increasing the number of lines used to 1,080, or 1080p. I don't add the black lines, so my resolution is only the picture you see, not the black on top and bottom. There's no difference in quality, and the newest version of ripbot has a few features I like, so I too will be updating to that."

Thanks A Lot GRSHOPR, For Explaining.

Actually I Was Thinking The Same.
But I Think There Might Be A Quality Difference.
Your Rips Should Be With Better Video As They Lack Those Black Borders.
Is Not It?

Can I Go For It? I Want English One.

Thanks."
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-28T06:13Z,"It's in Enlgish Jag, go right ahead. And because it's merely solid black lines, it requires mere bytes of data to maintain, so it's no great loss. The practical upshot, is that if you try make burn it with an HD burning program, or onto a Blu-Ray, you don't have to deal with common, yet pesky requirement of having to create a 1920x1080 image, which most, if not all of those programs require."
,XAlucarDX454,2009-12-28T08:51Z,thanks for this!!!

,teabag87,2010-01-03T15:40Z,"hey GRSHOPR,

thanks for the movie.  lost my copy of this one when my ps3 tanked, and havent been able to find a mkv to convert since. 

small tip, if you put 4096mb as the size limit, you'll get a 4.00 or 3.99 gb file size.  I usually put 4094 to be safe so i dont have to concert it all over again"
