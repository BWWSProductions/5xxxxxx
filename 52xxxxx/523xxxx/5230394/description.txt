BODY MELT DVDRIP (1993)
Great cult horror/sci-fi film from Australia similar to Peter Jackson's early work. Pay no attention to the low rating this film got. If you like "Brain Dead" or "Dead Alive," or David Cronenberg's early films, you will enjoy this.

Synopsis: First Stage: Hallucinations Second Stage: Organ Failure Third Stage: Body Melt Itâ€™s a sunny day in suburbia. Suddenly, a hideously deformed, dying man disrupts the peace when he crashes his car into Pebbles Court, the better part of Homesville. Heâ€™s the victim if an experimental drug marketed as the dietary supplement Vimuville, which has apparently malfunctioned. He has arrived too late to warn the population of Homesville not to try the pill dropped in their mailbox by a respectable pharmaceutical company. Unfortunately, the folks of Homesville are suckers for freebies and start deforming, mutating, exploding, and otherwise experiencing sudden and very gruesome deaths. A local health spa becomes the nerve center for this horrific outbreak as the film spirals down a catastrophic path that has been compared to John Carpenterâ€™s 1995 film "In The Mouth of Madness". Full of shocking surprises, imaginative photography, and layered with gore, Body Melt offers horrific entertainment as lustful teenagers. Old ladies, health staff, and respectable families go through the merciless deteriorating torture.
