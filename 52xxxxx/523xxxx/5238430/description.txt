Notes::::::::::::::::::
where do i start....ok well source had bad ivtc and bad
dupe frames, also fixed the funky aspect ratio on this put
it what i thought was good the runtime was built
up to over 2hours due to long black pic of nothing that also
got removed, left the final scene in after the credits also
fixed the colors added video denoise and sharpness anyway
in my opinion it looks much better than the source enjoy!!!
i also suspect this being a wp due to the green lines around
the actors which is greenscreen but i release as scr to go with
flow....i may be mistaken just my mind playing games
