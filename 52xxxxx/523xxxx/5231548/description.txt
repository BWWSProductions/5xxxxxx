       3/4 - The Woolryches
       The Woolryches are an old English family with traditional old 
       English attitudes. In this moving film, four generations of the 
       Woolryches gather for a reunion which they hope can resolve some 
       of their long-standing differences and bring the family closer 
       together.
       
       But being a family is about more than sharing a name, no matter 
       how notable. If the reunion is to succeed, the Woolryches will 
       need to overcome their stiff upper lip and, for the first time, 
       express their true feelings for each other.
       
       Michael, the 83-year-old patriarch of the family, is passionate 
       about the Woolryches' distinguished heritage. He has spent years 
       researching the family tree and can trace his ancestors back 
       hundreds of years to the days when they were wealthy landed gentry. 
       But Michael is less enthusiastic about some of his living relatives 
       - in particular his younger brother Toby.
       
       The two siblings have never been close, boarding school and careers 
       in the military saw to that, but their relationship broke down 
       altogether following the death of their father. As the eldest son, 
       it was Michael who became head of the family and inherited 
       everything, while Toby was left to fend for himself.
       
       The brothers' subsequent disagreement has centred, symbolically, on 
       one single item - a portrait of their mother, which Michael insists 
       was left to him. Toby disagrees and refuses to part with it. It is 
       a feud that has kept the ageing brothers apart for decades and at 
       the reunion the family are hoping they can finally settle their 
       differences before it's too late.
       
       Toby is sceptical about the possibility of reconciliation with his 
       brother. His priority for the weekend is to try and mend the 
       fractured relationship with his long-lost daughter Elizabeth, who 
       he hasn't spoken to for years.
