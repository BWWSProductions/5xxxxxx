Teach Yoursef Swedish is the course for anyone who wants to progress quickly from the basics to understanding, speaking and writing Swedish with confidence. Although aimed at those with no previous knowledge, it is equally suitable for anyone wishing to brush up existing knowledge for a holiday or business trip. Key structures and vocabulary are introduced in 18 thematic units, progressing from basic greetings and introductions and dealing with everyday situations to writing a formal letter and business communications.

The emphasis is on communication throughout, with important language structures introduced through dialogues on the accompanying recording. There are plenty of exercises to practise the language as it is introduced and tips throughout to help with pronunciation and grammar. Cultural information boxes give useful advice and information for anyone planning a trip to Sweden.
