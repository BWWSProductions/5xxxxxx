,alecjw,2010-10-18T13:27Z,"Just a note to anyone downloading: this is the 1995 version of the book, which you can also get here without the watermarking: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3541894
(the book in this torrent has a ""trial version"" watermark on it)

I've uploaded the CD from this torrent myself in speex format myself: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5893437
Speex gives better compression of voice files than MP3

PS. to the uploader: why use RAR? It's a non-free format and isnt as widely compatible than zip. Admittedly, zip does give bigger files, but most people using bittorrent wont be bandwidth metered anyway. If you want a good balance between compatibility and small files, I'd recommend 7zip: http://www.7-zip.org/ which gives smaller files than zip and is a free/open format. Anyone who can open a RAR archive can open a 7zip archive, since winrar supports 7zip. Or even better, if you don't archive files at all, people can choose which ones they want to download."
