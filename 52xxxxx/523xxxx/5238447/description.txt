Storyline: Hellboy isn't your average hero. Hell. He isn't even your average 
superhero. Brought forth by the Nazis during a sacred ritual towards the end of World War II. Our hero was 
summoned by accident when the evil monk of Russian history/folklore, Grigori Rasputin was meddling with forces 
that lead to his undoing. With the twisted and evil monster trapped for another sixty years when things don't 
go as planned (US soldiers heroically intervened). Hellboy is raised by Prof. Trevor "Broom" Bruttenholm, an 
expert in the occult. Our demonic hero is initiated in to the Bureau of paranormal research were he joins the 
amphibious, kind hearted, and clever fellow "Freak", Abe Sapien. When Rasputin returns once again with the aid 
of his minions the maniacal, undead assassin Kroenen and the monk's faithful lover Ilsa. Hellboy must unwillingly 
pair up with John Myers, an idealistic, naive new agent of the Bureau. Not only that but the big hunk of an evil 
basher becomes entangled in a love triangle with the pyro-telekinetic love of his life Liz and his new comrade. 
Fighting evil couldn't prove more difficult or out there.
