,jenotron,2009-12-25T12:13Z,"I don't like the way you neglect the Apple TV, you've took over from newartriot but non of your rips work on this device. It's not a question of quality either, lots of other uploaders did fine making their rips compatible. 

Please consider adjusting your settings."
,d_archangel,2009-12-25T16:04Z,"Vroiai sa zici Hellboy Box Set, nu Hellboy Bot ;)). Anyway, Craciun fericit si La Multi Ani! 

Pe langa astea trebuie sa faci ceva cu sunetul ala, nu se mai poate asa, ma uit la un film cu volumul la maxim atat din calculator cat si din tv si abia se aude. N-am mai vazut nicaieri un release cu un sunet asa de slab, no offense. Cred ca o sa trec la mkv-urile de 4,37 GB, chiar daca ocupa mult mai mult, daca o mai tii tot asa."
,gonzoeight,2009-12-25T21:01Z,"Does anyone know why I can't watch Secretmyths downloads on my WDTV Live in Dolby Digital? When I convert the movie using convertx it plays on DVD in Dolby Digital, but not through the WDTV live, it plays in Dolby Pro Logic II for some reason.  Or any help on how to convert the sound from aac to something the WD will read as 6 channel"
,whitephantom,2009-12-25T23:12Z,"Thank You SM and Merry Christmas , see you in 2010 ."
