BBC Earth: The Power of the Planet

Geologist Iain Stewart embarks on a personal journey to tell the life story of our planet, how it works and what makes it so special.
Dr Iain Stewart tells the story of how Earth works and how, over the course of 4.6 billion years, it came to be the remarkable place it is today.

The first four films look at one of the great forces that shape the Earth (volcanoes, the ocean, the atmosphere, ice) and explore its central role in the Earth's story. We will see how all the planet's forces work together to make Earth a home for life. 
In the final programme we will bring together the themes of the series and argue that Earth is an exceptionally unusual kind of planet. It is likely to be very rare indeed - and this gives us a special responsibility to look after our unique world.
