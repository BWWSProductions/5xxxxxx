Microsoft Arcade (1993) ppGame

Microsoft Arcade is a series of classic arcade game compilations, the first of which was released in 1993 on a single 1.44MB floppy. Available for both Microsoft Windows 3.1 and the Apple Macintosh, it contained versions of Tempest, Battlezone, Asteroids, Centipede, and Missile Command. Although the games were very similar to the original games in both appearance and gameplay, they were newly-written versions, not ports of the original arcade game code. Each game allowed certain customizations not available in the original arcade game, i.e. the number of lives and bonus levels. 

This release also includes a launcher for the "Arcade" collection.
