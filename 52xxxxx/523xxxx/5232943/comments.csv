the following is what my algorithm came up to be the top 20 used passwords... it was a dirty algorithm so I can't say for sure they are the top 20 but still...

  123456
  12345
  123456789
  password
  princess
  iloveyou
  rockyou
  princess14
  1234567
  12345678
  lovely
  abc123
  nicole
  jessica
  daniel
  michael
  qwerty
  iloveu
  babygirl
  ashley

I found it humorous that vanity placed #5 in my chart with ""princess"" and that love placed #6 with ""iloveyou"" as a password

also if your name is nicole,  jessica,  daniel or michael you probably use it as a password

lots of people used the name of the site ""rockyou"" as a password, tsk, tsk, tsk...

the all might ""qwerty"" came up as #17 thats the password I used when I was a kid... I thought that would be #1

I don't remember but ""123456"" was used like 250,000 times which makes up almost 1% of the accounts in this dataset

the 20 passwords above together make up around 2.5% of the accounts in this dataset"
