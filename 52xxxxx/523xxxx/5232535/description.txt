A candidly aimed interview into the thoughts and life of Zionist, Richard Dawkins.

Richard Dawkins is the essence of scientific reason, an evolutionary biologist, a best-selling author, and strident atheist. He's been declared one of the most influential - and provocative - thinkers of our time. 

He's our guest in the last episode of this series of Elders.
