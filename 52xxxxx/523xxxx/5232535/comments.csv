Notice how most of these conspiracy theories tend to lean towards promoting Christianity, promoting the idea that the Earth is 6,000 years old and that Obama is the antichrist, and atheists are blood sucking demons in disguise....

And just because you don't like the fact that evolution occurs, does not mean that you need to emulate the barbarity of what happens in nature. Certain species of females eat the male after they mated with them- does not mean you have to emulate it. It is a fact however, and denying facts, is asinine.

I fart in your general direction."
