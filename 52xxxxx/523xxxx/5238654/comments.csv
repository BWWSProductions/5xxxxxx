,eman188,2010-01-01T19:06Z,how is this only one gig?
,jakyll,2010-01-03T09:45Z,"i would assume its because it only has one audio track and no subs, decent quality though."
,Zokk,2010-01-07T18:18Z,"Great upload- been looking for this for a while now. Good size, decent quality, and a fun series. Thanks. I'll seed when I can."
,Lovejam,2010-03-30T10:35Z,"The quality is great especially for the size.
Each episode is 40mb encoded in h264.
Thank you much."
,XDeZenX,2010-08-07T05:47Z,Nice! and only 1gig :D 
,GilverRedgrave,2010-12-21T02:31Z,"What video program are you guys using?
i am running nero express but that does not seem to work."
,Teddikilla,2011-04-06T13:56Z,"Thanks for this. 1 gig is awesome, the quality should be fine. I've encoded epis at 30-40 mb and they are excellent quality. Don't be hesitant to get this guys :'D
Thanks, But um. I'm on 0.0% >.< 
PLEASE SEED!!! :]"

,kensiko,2012-03-26T13:47Z,"Yes it's true, the quality is amazing for the size!!

I know it's H264 but what is the trick?  I'm sure that if I try to do the same I won't be able."
