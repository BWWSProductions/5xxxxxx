Previously, Chamillionaire had stated that his third studio album would not be titled 'Venom' and that the content for that album had been scrapped and a new project was under way. To decide the title for his newest album, a competition was run on the rapper's website asking fans for their suggestions for album names. As a result of the competition, several names were short-listed and finally they were voted on and Venom was chosen by fans as the title for his third album. Chamillionaire spoke on the reversal of mind stating:
â€œ 	...not wanting to use it anymore was for creative reasons but others seemed to disagree because of marketing reasons. So I figured that I would put it up there so you all could decide and help me prove I'm not crazy. Looks like I am crazy. Venom it is.
