Alaska: Most Extreme (2009)

Everything is extreme in Alaska: the weather and climate that make each day a new and often menacing adventure; the ways in which many Alaskans earn a living; and the basic skills that everyone must learn and know simply to survive in this harsh environment. Alaska is bigger, badder, stronger and more dangerously unpredictable than any other place in the nation. Home to Americaâ€™s highest mountains, most powerful earthquakes, fiercest wildlife, biggest waves and cruelest winters, the last frontier state is a place of raw, unbridled natural forces.
