Gaga originally wrote "Telephone" for Britney Spears to be put in her 2008 studio album Circus. However, after recording the track, Spears' label rejected the song, and Gaga rerecorded the song later as a collaboration with Knowles for The Fame Monster. Gaga said, "I wrote it for her a long time ago and she just didn't use it for her album. It's fine because I love the song and I get to perform it now."Additionally, the guest vocalist was originally going to be Spears, but when Spears wanted to put the song on her own greatest hits album, Gaga made alternative arrangements and made Knowles the featured vocalist instead. The main inspiration behind the song was Gaga's fear of suffocation as she felt that she seldom found time to just letting it go loose and have fun. She further clarified,

    "Fear of suffocation â€” something that I have or fear is never being able to enjoy myself, [...] 'Cause I love my work so much, I find it really hard to go out and have a good time. [...] "I don't go to nightclubs, [...] You don't see pictures of me falling out of a club drunk. I don't go â€” and that's because I usually go and then, you know, a whiskey and a half into it, I got to get back to work."
