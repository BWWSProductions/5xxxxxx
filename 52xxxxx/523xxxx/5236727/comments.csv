,slobinh,2010-01-04T06:37Z,"thanks,

i just read every single one.

I am following Jonah Hex V.2 and that series is awesome.  Some readers may just want to start there and skip the old school ones. "
,shadowpdf,2011-04-25T22:58Z,"I downloaded Jonah Hex from another torrent, one that appears to be smaller than yours.  It had, however, the same files that BluePeter created that you have (about 36 of the Weird Western comics).  When I try to view them in ComicRack, they are ""broken"" ... showing only an X where the cover should be.  Are the files you have from BluePeter any better?  Have you tweaked them to make them viewable?  I'm trying to figure out if their is some sort of incompatability between the files and my version of ComicRack, or if the files are just bad. I noticed in the comments that no one complained about bad files so I'm assuming something is different about your BP files.  And sorry about dropping this into the comment section.  I didn't know how to contact you directly."
