VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
SPECIAL EDITION
SEASON 4 VOLUME 2 DVD 4


We've all waited impatiently while a certain video company, stuck in the last century, put off the release of the final season of Voyage, and we've waited some more for the second half of season four.

Well... THE WAITING IS OVER!

The Seaview first sailed across American TV screens on September 14, 1964.
Now, 45 years later, TooleMan TV presents the final 13 episodes of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.
All episodes have been remastered from excellent broadcast recordings for the best video and audio.
These are FULL RESOLUTION NTSC DVD's.

Included:

- all 13 full-length episodes of the second half of season four
- ABC-TV's "In Color" opener before each episode
- uncut season four opening theme including "brought to you by..."
- previews of the next episode, where available



DVD 4 contains two episodes that are more relevant today than ever: aliens threaten the Earth by creating cataclysmic climate change!

First, aliens bent on changing Earth's atmosphere create a greenhouse aboard the Seaview in...


Episode 21: SAVAGE JUNGLE (Airdate: February 25, 1968)



"Savage Jungle" includes previews for the next episode, "Flaming Ice!"

Then it's a WHITE CHRISTMAS on the Seaview as aliens threaten to melt the polar cap in...

Episode 22: FLAMING ICE (Airdate: March 3, 1968)




And if you think you're watching Star Trek during "Flaming Ice," it could be because its music was composed by none other than
Alexander Courage,
who wrote the theme for Star Trek as well as music heard in several episodes!
