Format:        DVD5 NTSC-USA
Lang.:         English
Discs:         1
Image:         MDS/ISO
Genre.:        Strategy/Board Game
Requirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2 or Swap Magic Disc Method. 


Compressed with 7Zip, Game was tested and works.


Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded 
      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.


You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

And here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.


Game Description:

Culdcept is a hybrid board/card game where the objective is to generate the most mana before making it back to the castle.

Each player starts out with a deck of 50 cards. Card types range from monster cards (e.g. Skeleton), which are used to accumulate territory on the board to increase your mana; Equipment (e.g. Chain Mail), which will boost your monsters' abilities when they battle; and Magic (e.g. Holy Word 0), which can be used to help you or hinder the other players on the board. When a player lands on another player's monster, he/she can challenge it to a battle in an attempt to take over the territory. If the attacker wins, he/she gets the space on the board and additional mana.

There are more than sixteen different game boards, each with different rules and layouts (such as the maximum number on dice rolls, the elements on the board, etc.)

Features:

* Unique gameplay system that combines the strategic factors of collectable card 
  games on top of elements from a table-top board game.

* Easy, yet addictive gameplay that will keep the whole family entertained for
  hours and hours.

* Over 480 exclusive cards to collect. Each card is illustrated by famous Japanese
  artists such as Naoyuki Kato, Hiroaru Kaida, Kasuya Terada and many more.


Game Pics Included.


Burn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  

Burn at 8x or 4x speed.

Use Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't 
working.


If using DVD+R then booktype to DVD-ROM. 
(If your mod-chip, or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R).
