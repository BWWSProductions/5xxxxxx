[V],Big_dude,2009-12-29T09:08Z,"Mr. Bean can be converted to dvd but its in pal and cannot be patched to ntsc.

harvest moon save the homeland I have for download but I couldn't convert it to dvd.

The others might be able to just wait."
[V],Big_dude,2009-12-29T09:17Z,"I can rebuilt mr. bean to dvd but it will be in pal is that okay?

patching to ntsc crashes the game, let me know.

If you don't have a pal tv the screen will just roll."
[V],Big_dude,2009-12-30T04:45Z,"No will just keep contact thru comments.

[V],Big_dude,2009-12-30T06:13Z,"Bomber hardball cannot be converted to dvd at least I couldn't do it the game is hardwired for cd only.

Like I said some cd type ps2 games are more difficult to convert or cannot be this is one of those games.

No biggie just play it on cd."
