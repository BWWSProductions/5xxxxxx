                    Absent Father Christmas.                 
                    Lee's father turns up at the flat unannounced.  
                    This is the man who walked out of the family  
                    home when Lee was four, never paid his   
                    maintenance and ate Lee's goldfish. Lee wants  
                    him out of the flat, but Lucy tells him that  
                    the only way forward is to forgive and forget.  
                    Unfortunately, Lee's dad's behaviour makes this  
                    virtually impossible for Lee to achieve.
