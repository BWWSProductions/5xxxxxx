,eskid,2009-12-25T17:49Z,I apologize to everyone. A snow storm has electricity and internet pretty glitchy in my area right now. I am continuing to seed as long and as much as possible right now. I found this torrent on isohunt. Again I apologize about not seeding. Hopefully it is all up to stay this time. The problem is me be receiving another storm so please bare with me! Thanks everyone!
