You can dbl click on a file and it will bring it up to see what it is if you have a concern. This error is normally related to the scanner not adding in their logo, etc. file correctly. If these files bother you they can easily be deleyed so you have nothing but the comic pages and the 2 covers (or more if mult. are scanned)."
