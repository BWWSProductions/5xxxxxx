FLAC sound is the only way to go nowadays, mp3s just don't cut it anymore. Help spread the word!

There are far too many uninformed, ignoramuses here on pirate bay still ripping their CD uploads using 320kbs MP3 which is pointless unless your computer has like 200 gigs of ram, a number very low by today's standards. You can buy massive amounts of external hard drive memory for chump change.

Here's to seeing all of the music on the PBay available in FLAC! This is the only true way to listen to your music! I have personally generated wave graphs to compare, and each sound was of course greatly clearer both on paper and in practice. Little details comes out that were never there before while they were mp3.

I use Sennheiser HD-555 and HD-800, pricey but worth it if you are seriously into music.

,twistles,2009-12-30T14:32Z,"The main reason for FLAC being better than MP3 or other lossy formats is that lossless allows transcoding to any format of choice without losing quality.  It has absolutely NOTHING to do with actual experienced sound quality.  At high bitrate, lossy codecs are transparent for just about everything (noise genre excluded, as well as rare limitations specific to individual formats).  Take a look at hydrogenaudio forums for the results of extensive ABX testing if you don't believe me *shrug*  

As for uploaders of free content here on TPB being ""uninformed ignoramuses"" for providing tracks in a lossy format, you may like to consider that a FLAC rip may be 300Mb vs a transparent ""lossy"" rip at 70Mb.  For those with limited upload bandwidth, they could upload (or keep alive) four lossy torrents for every uploaded FLAC torrent.  

I'll agree that MP3 format is generally not a good idea (OGG aoTuV is usually better for a whole host of reasons).  But - transcoding aside - there is seldom a reason to want FLAC over a lossy format when we're dealing with a digital source."

actually flac takes up much more space than an mp3 at 320 kbs...not sure where you drew that conclusion from"
,sugdenbra,2010-05-21T23:33Z,"And you use HD555?

Why is that now again? I mean, you had HD800 you said and there shold be absolutely no reason what so ever for you to use HD555 when owning the Sennis HD800!!

IÂ´m sure you are aware of the fact that HD800 cost somewhere around 1400$ witch is moore than 10 times HD555.  

When it comes to mp3, as mentioned before bandwith is only one of the reasons why some people choose do dl it. Not to mention people can choose for them selves. 

Just saying."
,darth1234,2011-02-28T19:45Z,"fourfive a plant for Sennheiser? Maybe, if they hire idiots to do that sort of thing.

Anyhow, was wondering if anyone knew which recording of the Four Seasons this is? Don't want to download one I've already got in FLAC again..."
