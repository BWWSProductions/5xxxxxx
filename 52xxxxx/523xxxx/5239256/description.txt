Neat Image Pro+ 5.9

Noise is a serious problem in digital imaging 
In digital photography, the consumer- and prosumer-level cameras produce images with an easily noticeable noise component, which is especially strong in images taken at high ISO rates. Scanned photos contain a similar film grain component. The noise and grain reduce the visual quality of digital images and resulting printouts. 

The solution to the noise problem: Neat Image 
Neat Image is a digital filter specifically designed to reduce visible noise in digital photographic images produced by modern digital cameras, as well as film and flatbed scanners.
