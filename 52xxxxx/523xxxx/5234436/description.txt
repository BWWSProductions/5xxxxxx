KOLAC (eng. the Stake) was spawned in the summer of 2006 by two good friends with pseudonims Grob (eng. Grave) and Divo-Koza (eng. Wild Goat). The only goal set up for the band is to play the music that the founders like to listen without any inovations. Just pure anti-religious Black Metal dedicated to the darkest Underground. After two years of writing music and lyrics, and intense searching for a drummer who would be willing to play, the band decided to record the first promotional material: â€œ9/11 Last Minute Silenceâ€ promo 2008. The name came from the release date which was on the 9/11/2008, and not because of some political or any other reason. It was recorded in Divo-Kozaâ€™s home studio on 09/09/2008. Music on the promo was written by Divo-Koza, and lyrics by Grob. The lyrics for the last track HelvetesjÃ¤vlakrig (eng. Infernal Fucking War) was translated to Swedish by Valkyra. The second demo was released on January 26th 2009. It is titled â€œâ€¦No Godâ€, and it contains 4 new songs, and 2 covers (Horna, Sabbat (Japan)). Music is still written by Divo-koza, and lyrics by Grob. It costs 300 RSD, or 5 euros (including postage)! Trades are always welcome! Third demo will be released this year through Ugly Cunt Records from Poland, and our debut full-lenght album will be released this summer through Salute Records from Sweden!
