The offspring of the American ambassador to France (the star was then living in Paris with her journalist husband), De Havilland tries to dissuade narrow-minded senator Adolphe Menjou from declaring Paris "off limits" to American servicemen. One such man in uniform is sergeant John Forsythe, who falls in love with De Havilland, whom he mistakes for a model. Eventually Menjou is shown the error of his ways through the combined efforts of De Havilland and his own wife Myrna Loy, while Our Heroine finds true happiness as an Army wife. The Ambassador's Daughter was produced, written and directed by Norman Krasna, a renowned Hollywood wit whose comic gifts were apparently left back in California on this occasion.
