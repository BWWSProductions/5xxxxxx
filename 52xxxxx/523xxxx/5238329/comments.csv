,lizzymorales,2009-12-27T17:13Z,Can someone tell me how to get this working step by step? I'm really bad at this kinda thing. Please help ^_^
,Russian9,2009-12-28T01:16Z,"It works great, except you do need a loader (I used: http://www.filedropper.com/loader161b_1 ).  1. Download the torrent
2. Burn it on a DVD
3. Upgrade you Vista or Custom Install
4. Download the loader
5. Run it and click Install loader (your computer will restart)
6. You are activated  and good to go."
,GameWarden,2009-12-28T03:08Z,if you do clean install you do not need a loader
,jason4amd,2009-12-28T06:45Z,hey thanks to all the seeders keep up the good work thanks and have a merry christmas
,uberpirate123,2009-12-29T19:56Z,"wait, does this work completly with xp?"
,Xbox_ftw_94,2009-12-30T03:14Z,So has any one use this and had it work without a loader?!?
,buckysone,2010-01-02T07:16Z,I have installed this and it works. It is Windows 7 Ultimate Edition 64-Bit Build 7600 which has an activation key slipstreamed into the intallation process.
,js123459,2010-01-07T09:47Z,"So is this the retail version???  because i bought a cd key for vista ultimate, and now i just need an iso"
,drinksbud,2010-01-07T19:00Z,This really works!!! I am using this version now. It even backed up my files to windows.old. It looked for a serial but I just hit enter and it completed the install. All updates completed and it says windows is activated. Thanks to Gamewarden for the upload.
,Himherit,2010-01-18T22:16Z,"I'm sure it would work all fine from a clean install, but what about if you're upgrading from Vista? Anyone do that?"
,biggceaze,2010-01-19T10:20Z,Works great! Thanks GameWarden and I will be seeding to keep it alive.
,Zomby66,2010-01-21T01:53Z,It`s amazing how people that know nothing about computers download this and then ask how to install it !!!!!

,ducksflying,2010-03-01T22:37Z,URGERNT!!  I installed this W7 on my pc and everything seemed to be fine.  BUT now windows keeps asking me to register before the 30 days free expires.  Do I need to a product key for this? I thought it'd activate automaticaly.... plz help
,GameWarden,2010-03-02T16:55Z,Windows came out with a new update that will kill any pirated copy you will have to reinstall and disable one of the updates KB9701033 if you disable this update ypu will be fine all other updates are ok.
,GameWarden,2010-03-02T16:59Z,O and yes this is retail version build 7600
,phageakroma,2010-03-05T12:52Z,GameWarden. i cant boot with this one. i think its not bootable? help?
,GameWarden,2010-03-09T03:51Z,All you have to do is burn it with magic ISO or power ISO and it will boot no problem if you cant get it to boot its your computer check your bios make sure it is set cdrom to number 1 in boot priority
,KingOfDaFallen,2010-03-17T00:32Z,"Am Downloading It Now.So Can I Do & Upgrade.Cause I Have Vista.Will I Need To Get A Activator?.

,Neelg,2010-04-22T19:10Z,plz tell me just 1 thing... even if we complete installation and it shows activated.. it WILL still ask for activation before 30 days otherwise it expires.. otherwise is a rare case... so what to do after that message appears.... and as gamewarden suggested to disable a particular update... i tried to find that update on my updates history i cud not find it(KB9701033) it wasnt there... can you also tell me how to disable a downloaded update without affecting the automatic update process? 
,Neelg,2010-04-22T19:42Z,let me know how to save files and settings and back up the previous stuff... i have company-shipped stuff on my pc that i may not find after a clean install... drinksbud said it backed up to windows.old... how can this be done? 
,Bozo45,2010-04-28T11:17Z,"Works Great, Lag when installing but does the job. have patience. Skip the part that asks for a serial number. Thanks for the upload"
,copesr1,2010-05-02T10:41Z,"Hi,

Just downloaded this torrent, really fast by the way. Installed fine paused at the command prompt screen which said a key was installed  successfully but once windows loaded it says that an OEM key is installed and it gives me a 30 expiry. Please help GameWarden "
,GameWarden,2010-05-04T08:58Z,You must do clean install for this to work when it asks for key skip it.  Also if it takes a long time for it to start loading in the beginning disable your 3.44 floppy drive on some systems it will cause it to hang during install.  When it is finalizing the crack is slipstreamed into it just remember to disable that update enjoy.
,Xenos1252,2010-06-17T07:25Z,"Thanks , im using this now and it runs great "
,Xenos1252,2010-06-17T18:16Z,"""img Burn"" works well people .. "
