Meav Ni Mhaolchatha, Hayley Westenra of "Celtic woman" singing group offer a supreme performance of "The last rose of summer" which we have converted into a karaoke video for you 

The performance you see is filmed at Slane Castle in glorious Ireland. 

This is one of my most favourite songs and is the best testament I could offer of the cultural spirited offerings from the Irish which makes the British supreme in this respect!

Lyrics (from Sir Thomas Moore):

Tis the last rose of summer 
left blooming alone
All her lovely companions 
are faded and gone
No flower of her kindred, 
no rose bud is nigh

To reflect back her blushes 
and give sigh for sigh

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one, 
to pine on the stem

Since the lovely are sleeping, 
go sleep thou with them
Thus kindly I scatter 
thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden 
lie scentless and dead

So soon may I follow 
when friendships decay
And from love's shining circle 
the gems drop away
When true hearts lie withered 
and fond ones are flown
Oh who would inhabit 
this bleak world alone?
