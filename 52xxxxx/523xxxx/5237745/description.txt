       8/12 - In a festive edition of the culinary challenge, Gordon asks 
       chefs from the Pheasant in Cambridgeshire and the Swan in Kent to 
       serve traditional British meals. The competitors prepare Stilton 
       starters, stuffed rabbit and loin of venison, and Christmas 
       pudding souffles. Peter Andre takes part in the recipe challenge, 
       and the chef meets cricketer Andrew `Freddie' Flintoff and 
       burlesque star Dita Von Teese, before heading to Lapland to learn 
       about reindeer meat.
