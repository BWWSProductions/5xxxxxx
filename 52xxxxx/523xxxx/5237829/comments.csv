,lilars26,2009-12-24T17:04Z,Decided that watching the cam would not ruin the movie for me.If (and that's a big if)I get to the theater I will know the storyline but would still be in for the visual treat that everyone says this movie delivers.Thanks again and have a wonderful holiday.
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-25T10:48Z,"@lilars26: ... of course that I'm not satisfied with video, it is crap (and without any reason with technology of 21st. century). But audio is much, much better (first cam has crying baby) and I cannot go to the theaters to watch movies properly, I haven't payed a visit to cinema probably last ten years. So, you know the saying about Mohamed and the hill...

Anyway, I'm glad you like it, I invested so much time in it.

Happy holidays, BTW."
