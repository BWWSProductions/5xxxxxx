,shuggeeman,2009-12-20T17:48Z,"it works perfect for me, dont know how it works for others:)"
,torxy,2009-12-20T18:38Z,"Works for me too, athlon x2, r4850, win7 64"

THANK YOU!"
,darklordbri,2009-12-20T20:50Z,"worked for me on my system.  phenom II x4, radeon 4870, vista x64.  confirmed NO viruses present!"
,shuggeeman,2009-12-20T21:04Z,Hope you enjoy it!
,Hendies,2009-12-20T22:11Z,"This is a fake, this is simply the RELOADED crack which is for the original. Using this crack does not enable the patched content as the .exe is patched by the patcher (and by using the RELOADED crack intended for the 1.0 version of the game) reverts the game back to version 1.0"
,shuggeeman,2009-12-20T22:15Z,ok... have you even tried the this crack before writing your dumb ass comment?
,Loginer,2009-12-20T22:21Z,"The original crack has the MD5 f3512dc10072ffdc0d544632cf7ffaa8. This one has the MD5 170607e08ecf4050e3db4a2759233aed, and it's perfectly clean.

,Hendies,2009-12-20T22:22Z,"Yeah I have, oh, my mistake - nobody had released any release notes after the 1.0 crack so I assumed it was for that one. I've just downloaded off gamecopyworld and it seems as if it's legit and this one is too.

Yeah, sorry about that ^__^"
,Hendies,2009-12-20T22:28Z,"Thanks dude, I've been fed up of this game crashing every half hour, now hopefully this'll be solved. I've been checking whenever I can for this crack so sorry about being a bit unbelieving on this torrent.

EVERYONE IT WORKS !!!"
,shuggeeman,2009-12-20T23:10Z,"No problem mate, hope you all enjoy!"
,Rick78,2009-12-20T23:30Z,Yep this does work thanks m8
,gergsworld,2009-12-20T23:40Z,The first comment is correct. Although I did find no trace of virus or malware so coodos for that :). But Although the patch may be valid the crack is a repacked version and all it did was reset my saboteur game back to 1.0. I still cannot pass the loading screen due to the ATI compatibility problem and If I use your patch and crack then I cannot even start the game because it is asking for the disk which eliminates the point of the crack. If There is something I am missing please help because I would really like to play but as far as Im concerned your crack is a bust and not for the beta patch.
,shuggeeman,2009-12-21T00:46Z,"well to start with, this is not my crack, nor is it my patch, i found it on a site. i did not use the patch from this torrent, i used the patch from the saboteur site, and then used the crack from this torrent, dont know if my answer will help you,but if it does, please do let me know!:)"
,Rick78,2009-12-21T01:57Z,"what i did was run the patch then place the crack..

iv been playing for 2 hours now with no crash or no probs getting past the loading screen "
,shuggeeman,2009-12-21T02:12Z,good for you rick that it works well!:)

that should do it ;)"
