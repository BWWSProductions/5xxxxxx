p.s: are you still dj-ing?"
,momentarydogma,2011-06-05T22:09Z,Apparently it was from your former life as a shitty DJ...
,4sst,2011-08-23T19:20Z,"@momentarydogma - Sometimes gigs you are hired for are shitty. A lot of times, the shitty gigs actually are better paying. If I was just a hobbyist, I wouldn't have half this stuff.  Lot of money in the teeny-bopper events. That's the difference between DJing as a profession and DJing because it's cool.  Anyone that knows anything about music from that time period would recognize a professional collection -- 'N Sync to Mobb Deep..? c'mon friend - open your mind a little bit."
