,rosyjo11,2009-12-25T03:08Z,"Picture and sound look great but none of my conversion programs are allowing me to pick which audio track I want to use when converting and burning.  Just tried the Virtualdubmod program but it wants to save the video file at over 100GB! (not familiar with the program settings)
Can anyone tell me how to pick the English audio when converting it to DVD?  Or even what program you use?  THanks heaps, JO"
,dlarrym,2009-12-25T11:01Z,"Hey, who ever was having an issue with forcing the correct track to play, here is how to make sure that WILL NOT be an issue.  Not knowing your DVD player, wheathar or not you immediately burn you torrents onto DVD's (as many do), or your if your DVD player is .AVI video archieve compatable, or you could be using any of several software -Emulation- of DVD players that play many other formats above and beyond just DVD's the DVD PLAYER that comes in the all MAC OS X and on up is a software player... No hard ware except to retrieve the data to the computer. DELL has the hardware of a component type DVD player, like a SONY or JVC or what ever you would find for sale at SAM's or BEST BUYS. (QUICKTIME IS PROBABLY THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE)
   SO, I suggest using quicktime player. Open the avi movie you want to watch in Quicktime. Wait a few moments for the movie file to load into Quicktimes player, then pull down from the menu bar the menu choice labeled ""WINDOW"". Now you'll see a window that will open and it has a graph similair to EXCELL, 1 lines says VIDEO, another Audio, an another 3rd Audio a 4th and maybe the 1st in the order, doesn't matter... So, There are ""check off boves"" to the left of the 3 lines I just mentioned. 1 of those Audio is the language you want. UN-CHECK the Audio you don't want and the other (make sure it is  CHECKED) track (and language will play) good luck witih that endevor."

,rosyjo11,2009-12-26T10:22Z,"I've been using Nero to convert to DVD and burn but couldnt find any audio options. 

The burning software I have that does have obvious audio options wont load AVI, only wants to load DVD files.

Thanks for the help :) "
