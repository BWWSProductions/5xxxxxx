Being a little above a middle age man, I'm not sold on this series yet. Hits to close to home when I was their age. I like shows that take me away from that, even for a little while. But it may be a good way to understand what getting older can be like and make you live your life more fully. 
For you older viewers, I think you will relate to a lot of this show."
