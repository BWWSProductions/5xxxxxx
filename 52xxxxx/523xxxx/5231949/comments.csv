,the_guttersnipe,2010-08-30T05:03Z,"Thanks for the upload. I was just reading Zizek's latest book, Living in End Times and he references this movie. Sounds intriguing."
,martin0904,2010-10-27T13:43Z,seed please
,sharpsponge,2010-11-29T06:07Z,@martin0904 I've never stopped seeding this. I just turn my laptop off occasionally.
[T],rkimble,2010-12-02T19:51Z,I'd like a full DVD rip of this with John Frankenheimer's commentary. Any chance of that?
,lmorpheme,2012-02-17T05:16Z,"The DVD is out of print. It's selling used on Amazon for obscene prices, and the only copy I was able to get from Netflix had major scratches and was unplayable. If I wanted to buy this film (which I do, badly), how would I do that? Is it even possible?

Once again, the cloud (legitimate or not) comes to my rescue. I expect it will become even more significant as digital filmmaking makes film preservation untenable. The only way to keep a digital file in archive is to keep copying it. Piracy will save rare films from oblivion."
,sharpsponge,2012-04-09T05:30Z,@imorphone ... that's exactly why I uploaded the file -- I only share OOP quality that I've been able to get copies of so that people who want to are able to watch them. Thanks for the comment.
,sharpsponge,2012-04-09T05:33Z,"although I must add, after checking, that to Amazon.com's credit, they are offering this film as one of it's ""instant video"" purchases."
