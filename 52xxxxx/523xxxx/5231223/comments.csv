,Island_Bill,2010-01-01T03:18Z,"Application installed and works better than expected - by that I mean the video capture is smooth and clear out performing all other screen capture software I've tried. The video output once the frames/second is adjusted up to 8 fps from the default 5 fps the output is indistinguishable from the original video file.

Thank you."
