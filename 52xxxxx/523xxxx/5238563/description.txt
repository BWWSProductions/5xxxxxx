December 24, 2009


This is a collection of movie trailers for next week premieres
and latest interesting trailers in HD 1080p. The most cool
premiere is the Russian one this time, but latest trailers
are good too, despite them being in stereo sound. Be careful
while watching "Frozen" trailer, it's scary.

Also, Merry Christmas!
