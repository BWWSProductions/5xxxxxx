,Tricksta005,2009-12-21T02:43Z,"JUST AN FYI: ""The C-17 2D panel and gauges were completed over a year ago but it was decided to bring it more up to date and also try to achieve more similarity with the VC appearance. Release of the v1.1 update for existing owners is aimed the period mid-Jan to mid-Feb 2010.""  - Alphasim.com"

,aarque,2009-12-21T15:53Z,"Trixy STFU. I seed to feel like a big man pirate, not to appease pplz who HAVEN'T UPLOADED A DAYAM THING. Keep your client open and you will get it bit by bit when I am not playing Call of Duty with the hackers.

Or - here's an idea - you could go and hunt it down on the warez sites like I did."
,massive74,2009-12-22T08:45Z,"This is just a ridiculous, itÂ´s over 100 waiting for someone seed this!!"
,Warrior30114,2009-12-22T08:53Z,"Stop being a bitch and seed the fucking torrent. I can't stand ppl who think like you => ""I seed to feel like a big man pirate, not to appease pplz"" Grow up, you put it on here so deal with it."
,salakrestu,2009-12-22T12:55Z,"aarque we really appreciate your efforts, we do. But it would be nice to be able to also download this file. Try to understand that you can't show goodies to people's faces if you don't intend to seed. Thank you."
,massive74,2009-12-22T14:05Z,"In few days someone else is going put this C-17 torrent on the TPB, this stupid game is just a flippin hilarious.
This is like being in kindergarten school.

aarque...GROW UP!"
,aarque,2009-12-22T14:06Z,"I have been seeding for two days now. I seed during the day when I am not home and at night while I sleep. The tracker system is no longer reliable since about the time TPB started using the magnet links.

I have had to re-upload torrents because they just wouldn't seed. Apparently it happens occasionally. I assumed, because of the first three comments, that people were getting the torrent. However, I clearly do check back. If people are willing to verify - reasonably and not in all capital letters - that they have been leeching for more than a few hours and they get no ""bits,"" I will kill this torrent and load another. 

On the other hand warriordude, you can take your shoot from the hip character judgment and shove it. Another comment or two like that and I will kill the dam thing entirely and go back to leeching like you. You got your ""cant stands?"" Have you checked your uploads lately? Whats your seed ratio bitch? YOU fucking deal with it."
,aarque,2009-12-22T14:25Z,"ok, massive, why'ncha you go out and find it? It's right there at the warez sites. Your bitching isn't going to get me to want to find and upload similar. Use ur kindegarten brain and think about it."
,salakrestu,2009-12-22T17:32Z,"Completed and seeding as much as I can, thank you aarque!"
,aarque,2009-12-22T20:21Z,my pleasure salakrestu
,Yxin123,2009-12-23T09:58Z,"Thx for the up aargue :)
Argh. Alphasim is really starting to go down the drain... releasing, and charging money for products thats not even beta :/ I feel sorry for those who actually bought this .. after its release they said it would take 1-2 months to get the vc ready, now they say mid january-february."
,salakrestu,2009-12-23T14:40Z,"If anybody is interested I could upload a fully working VC that I ripped from a C5M Galaxy and adapted to this release. It is not realistic, I know, but still better than NO VC at all. Let me know."
,massive74,2009-12-23T15:08Z,"salakrestu:

Yes please upload the VC from the C-5.that would very nice.

Is thisC-5 good quality? you can maybe upload her to?"
,massive74,2009-12-23T15:12Z,"aarque.

Thanks alot mate and i am sorry for my attitude."
,aarque,2009-12-23T17:36Z,It's all good. Glad everyone has a chance to get at this thing.
,Yxin123,2009-12-24T11:36Z,"salakrestu, that would be awesome if you could be bothered to do that :)
And merry x-mas all pirates!"
,massive74,2009-12-24T22:18Z,"kaiwenYu 

What VC cockpit are you talking about!....it is no VC!....he he"
,salakrestu,2009-12-25T01:34Z,"Here's the temporary VC:

,salakrestu,2009-12-25T12:07Z,"That's why I said it's ""temporary"" dude."
,jfwhit,2010-01-02T20:19Z,"Hello,
First, thank you very much for the airplane. I am fairly new to this.  For some reason the aircraft doesnt show up after I put it in FSX in the simobject folder.  Is there something else I am suppose to do to make it work? Thank you!"
,PinkPuspe,2010-01-16T01:18Z,What a money hungry whores they are. Releasing an aircraft which does not have VC. Lazy ass cunts
,acacapt,2010-04-19T17:23Z,"To anybody tracking this torrent... The VC update is out (v.1.05) still nobody uploaded a torrent!!!

Has anyone seen it?"
,acacapt,2010-05-01T00:30Z,Is anybody tracking this??? Up'd to version 1.05 with VC and 2D panel has been out for a while and no torrent for it!!! PLEASE.... 
,VEIVE,2010-06-13T19:55Z,"wtf.. it just dont show up in the game? i know where to put it and everything, all the others work but this one not.. any help?"
