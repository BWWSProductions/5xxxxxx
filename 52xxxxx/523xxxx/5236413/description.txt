              Release Date....: 2009.12.23
              Genre...........: Comedy

       Caustic comic and writer Charlie Brooker returns in a doomed bid 
       to summarise 2009's TV output without vomiting. From the 
       unpleasant spectacle of Britain's Got Talent to the downright 
       worrying The Execution of Gary Glitter, and everything in-between, 
       this is the only television programme you need watch this year, or 
       indeed ever again. Contains weeping and screaming and words.


                             Big up all scene massive!
