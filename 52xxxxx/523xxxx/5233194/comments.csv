,Vid89,2009-12-22T00:31Z,"Thank you so much for this and all your uploads, they're fantastic. I don't usually make requests, but I'd really like to see your rip of ""Do The Right Thing"". I couldn't thank you enough. And seeing that it's a legendary film, I'm sure many people would be happy to see you rip this one. Any Spike Lee movie would be fantastic, for that matter.
You're the best, thank you! :)"
,diulasing,2009-12-22T07:59Z,Great rips as always~!!
,the_devious,2009-12-22T10:39Z,"Great work! For Paranormal Activity, a really great idea would be to add a separate file with just the alternate ending. It would save having to DL both complete versions. Thanx again for a fantastic service!"
,the_devious,2009-12-22T10:45Z,Should have mentioned... for Paranormal Activity... the REFiNED and BestHD rips are 1280x720... WTF is that? That's a 16/9 TV ratio... must have black bars. Need to strip those and set 1280x688 (1.85 AR). Defining the edges of black bars takes up a lot of video bitrate; so best to crop them out when you re-encode. Unless the Blu-ray image has been adapted for wide-screen TV at the source... ???

,sagartian,2010-02-09T15:45Z,"So hilarious one! Anyone who wants to know how the Xerxes was look like, please book a damn air ticket to the Persepolis in Persia and take a look to what has remained from that empire. The movie is a joke and a snicker to the proved history. I believe this is a good movie for those who don't have any idea about historical facts. So I am so sorry for the audience who believe ancient Persian kings were naked! and the movie is trying to convince people the most ethical empire in the world was corrupted. So please people, buy some books and watch some reality based films."

There are not decent Brips out there right now and the ones that exist have credits, aftercredits cut off and even framedrops!! Save us!!"
,deathfest,2011-01-03T10:31Z,"Thanks secret_myth! Why do you always upload in mp4? Matroska is open source! ;-)

Guys please stop whining. It's a good movie, it's a good rip...period!

Yes the picture is a little dark, so go ahead and learn how to increase brightness and contrast on your screens. If the results dont satisfy you, DONT CRIB! You got this for free! Go look somewhere else!

A 500mb rip vs a 2.22gb?? Really...go learn something about video encoding and bitrates. The resolution is nothing if other parameters are set to reduce quality!! Get a 500mb one if you wanna watch on a 15"" laptop screen...if you want to watch on a 40"" one get this!"
,b_neo,2011-01-07T08:26Z,the video is quite grainy
,b_neo,2011-01-07T08:27Z,"the video is quite grainy, otherwise thnx"
,Verd4,2011-01-11T06:53Z,"Love your rips and uploads SM, but I'm a bit concerned about this one. The movie seems awfully grainy, more so than the film is supposed to be. I've heard a few people say that is natural, even on the disc, but I can not attest for sure. There's not really any other viable samples worth downloading. Anyone know more on this?"
,Verd4,2011-01-21T05:56Z,"To touch on the grain, it is indeed normal for the movie. "
