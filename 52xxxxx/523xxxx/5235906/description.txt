Opie and Anthony XM/Sirius Worst of commercial-free uncensored 128k VBR mp3 
Rip+Edit mg56

Note: the Worst of was pretty F'ed up today. They played an hour of Worst of 
with no intro, then the normal intro came in. It also seemed as if some or 
all of the Sam & Erock descriptions may have been wrong. I took the first 
hour, moved it to the end and added the normal exit audio. I'm grabbing the 
8pm replay to see if anything's different. It's also about 10 minutes short 
as there was a 20+ minute commercial break!
