,Purphexyon,2011-04-19T10:28Z,"WTF!?? I have never had so much trouble watching a video file in my life...after the half-assed first episode in season 7 (the one season I wanted to try out first), nothing else would play. I used Windows media player, Real player, and DivX...nothing would work!! They all tried to download codecs that didn't exist. This is such a great show that so many people love. Why the hell is it encoded in such a damn complicated fashion!?"
