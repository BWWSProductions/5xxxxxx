,Xcel432,2009-12-22T14:41Z,"Hey madtown4 , Have you ever tried using a *search engine??*.. Google really does rock, here are the results, it was easier than asking the same question over & over

http://www.google.com/search?q=The+Lovely+Bones.torrent&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a"
,Xcel432,2009-12-22T15:42Z,"Hey BONE, just a thought..
If you want an invite to Demonoid let me know, I have a few, I can PM you the code at the forum..

You can UP your entire PB library there...Could be cool if any more issues happen with TPB...."
[V],.BONE.,2009-12-22T16:24Z,im already a member watch out who u invite because if they do anything they should not be doin like uploading fakes ect u can get yaself band for inviteing them so do not invite just anyone who asks :)
[V],.BONE.,2009-12-22T16:26Z,and them u getting from google 9/10 fake its not out yet :)
,Xcel432,2009-12-22T16:57Z,"Ok cool on the Demonoid thing.. and I know about the BAN rules..I have been a member there for a few years, I figured you were pretty safe, LoL..

As for Google, Yes and no...Personally, I dont get to many fakes..but then I read comments, look up ULers histories & Libraries.. takes just a little common sense to avoid fakes...

Normally tho I never have to search, I have a TON of bookmarks of ULers that I know are legit and fast, Like you..LoL...
I just make the rounds when im looking for something and one of you have exactly what I want...
"
[V],.BONE.,2009-12-22T18:00Z,skip google and go strait 2 scenereleases or rlspress everything on them are real no fakes
