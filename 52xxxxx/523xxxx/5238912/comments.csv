[V],twentyforty,2009-12-24T17:05Z,"I see 21 peers which are""stuck"" and not connected. I have no idea who they are nor why they sit like ducks. I may suggest to you and all others: please, put UL/DL speed at 1:1 if you do not want to be kept away by new anti-cheating/anti-leeching wrapper on server. Please. And use new and proper torrent-programs. Enable encryption - I seed movie, right?"
