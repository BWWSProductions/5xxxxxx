Easy Actions second album (and last). This one is more pop oriented than the previous album. This is the japanese edition. It has Tommy Nilsson on Vocals and Kee Marcello on guitars and I totally love this line up (except that guy/bandmember that eventually starts working for a swedish bank and wants to forget about his Easy Action days, shame on you man!).

1.  Talk of the town
2.  Teachers do it with class
3.  Code to your heart
4.  Only Love
5.  One in a million
6.  Talk, talk, talk
7.  Partners in crime
8.  Love reaction
9.  Rosie
10. In the middle of nowhere
11. There is a river (bonus track)

Thanks to Shotgun Messiah that stole Zinny Zan and left space in Easy Action for Tommy to step in.
And No thanks to Europe that stole Kee Marcello so Easy Action had to dissapear.

But anyways, Bless you Kee Marcello, you are a true hardrocker!

If anyone has Kee Marcellos Red Fun album then please upload it.

Enjoy!
