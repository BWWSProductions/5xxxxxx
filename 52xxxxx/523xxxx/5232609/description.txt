"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!", also known as "Let It Snow", is a song written by lyricist Sammy Cahn and composer Jule Styne in 1945. It was written in July 1945 in Hollywood, California during one of the hottest days on record.

First recorded by Vaughn Monroe on October 31, 1945, it became a popular hit, reaching number one on the Billboard music chart the following year. One of the best-selling songs of all time, "Let It Snow!" has been covered countless times. Due to its seasonal lyrics, it is commonly regarded as a Christmas song. Yet despite its cheery, holiday feel, it is a love song that never mentions Christmas and both the composer and lyricist were Jewish.

Popular cover versions during the song's original popularity (late 1945-early '46) included the jazz bands of Woody Herman and Bob Crosby. This song was included on Ella Fitzgerald's 1960 Verve Records release: "Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas". Bing Crosby's version was recorded in 1962.

Sinatra's fellow Rat Pack alumni, Dean Martin, recorded a version. The 1945 recording by Monroe was used as the initial end credits song during the first two Die Hard movies, set during Christmas Eve in (assumedly) successive years.

Jessica Simpson's version, recorded for her Rejoyce: The Christmas Album in 2004 (see 2004 in music) and produced by Billy Mann, was the album's first single, and made the top twenty of the Adult Contemporary chart. The Italian singer Irene Grandi recorded in 2008 a personal version, sung in English. Connie Talbot recorded the song on her 2008 Christmas Album.

The song was also covered by Vonda Shepard in 2000 for Ally McBeal, on the album A Very Ally Christmas and Celtic Woman in the 2006 album A Christmas Celebration.

This song can also be found on Martina McBride's White Christmas album which was released in 1999.

Luscious Jackson is an alternative/pop-rock group formed in 1991. They are named after now-retired American basketball player Lucious Jackson.

The original band consisted of Jill Cunniff (vocals, bass), Gabby Glaser (vocals, guitar), Kate Schellenbach (drums) and Vivian Trimble (keyboards, vocals). The band played nearly every instrument heard on their records, and with the exception of a few non-LP cover songs wrote all of their own material, the majority penned by vocalists Jill Cunniff and/or Gabby Glaser.

Between 1993 and 2000 they released one EP, three full length LPs and ten singles on the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal record label. Their biggest hitâ€”and only Billboard Top 100 entryâ€”is "Naked Eye" ( March 22, 1997). Other notable singles include "Here", "CitySong (NY State Of The World)", "Under Your Skin" and "Ladyfingers".

Vivian Trimble left the group in 1998, and in 2000 (after releasing one album as a trio) the group announced their break up. February 2007 saw the release of Luscious Jackson's "greatest hits" compilation.
