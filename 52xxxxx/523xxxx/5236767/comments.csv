Watch and see how the government is tapping your phone calls, reading your emails, and creating databases of everything about you. Companies get paid by the government to collect info on all of us. All the purchases we make. The spouse we might have or what kind of pets we have, or even our favorite color. Here we have an ex CEO of the company talking about all this. Watch as you see how some companies monitor all their employees even while they are away from work! Finally the video shows the infamous NSA and how more than 20,000 people working each day listen to your phone calls. Hear ex employees talking about it. The sources are from MSNBC, Discovery Channel, and History Channel along with others. Not only is this evidence but it comes from high sources and it takes you right to the heart of where this is all happening. "
