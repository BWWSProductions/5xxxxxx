           With the departure of the Bush Administration and the          
           arrival of an era of transparency, opportunities are           
           arising for the disclosure of new information that may         
           shed more light on the events that took place before and       
           after 9/11/2001. Dramatically narrated by Daniel Sunjata       
           of FX s Rescue Me, and an outspoken advocate for the           
           First Responders, Loose Change 9/11: An American Coup          
           first examines mysterious and infamous events that             
           reshaped world history from the Reichstag Fire in 1933         
           that catapulted Hitler to dictatorship - to the Gulf of        
           Tonkin Incident in 1964 that led to the Vietnam War, and       
           then takes viewers on a turbulent journey through several      
           pivotal moments in history before delving into the most        
           significant catastrophe in recent memory, 9/11. Loaded         
           with powerful, new footage and in-depth interviews with        
           the likes of Steven Earl Jones, an American physicist who      
           has discovered undetonated explosive material in multiple      
           samples of dust from the World Trade Center collapses,         
           this documentary presents a wide array of evidence both        
           known and unknown...until now. Eight years later, the          
           American people continue to live in the aftermath of 9/11      
           and deal with its ongoing repercussions. Is this just          
           another machination of power on the timeline of history?       
           If so, the real question is what happens next? Or better       
           yet, what can we do to prevent another 9/11? The film          
           serves as a fundamental call to action which is fueled by      
           hope that those affected by 9/11 will soon receive the         
           answers that they have sought after for nearly a decade.
