Teach Yourself Bulgarian Conversation shows you how easy it can be to pick up a new language. It encourages you to speak out loud from the very start. The audio program features 10 topics that include 15 key words, three useful phrases, and one grammar point. Two sample conversations bring all those elements together correctly. There are plenty of review opportunities, so you can gauge your progress and reinforce what you have learned.

In addition, the third CD provides invaluable guidance on holding two-way conversations, addressing such issues as speaking with people who talk very fast or use words and phrases you do not know.

Includes three 60-minute audio CDs
