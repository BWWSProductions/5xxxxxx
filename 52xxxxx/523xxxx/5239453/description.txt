This is a very simple program.  Depends libglib

usage:

engine used_tags input output

an input file could look like this
        
          Text used 
          Text unused 
        Always used
         unused  still unused  
         Hello  goodbye  

used_tags could look like this
      use this
      and this
      more
      whatever

output would look like this
      Text used
      Always used
      Hello

So it can be used in programming and publishing when you are unsure if an element will be there or if an either or is need but your not sure which and you don't want to erase anything.

Give me suggestions.  I'll be switching input & output to stdin & stdout.

About me and my torrents:
  I'm here to start doing torrents smarter.  If you know any torrents that you would like done smarter leave me a comment.  We have 17 of the top trackers in this torrent.  I also have made it so it organizes smarter.  I do have a policy on leechers.  Just seed it to a ratio of 3. Just set the download to do that automatically. If it sits around for a week then stop seeding.  Also if you can learn about port forwarding then do so.
