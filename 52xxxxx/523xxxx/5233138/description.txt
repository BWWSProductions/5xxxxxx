I found Another Day On Earth a little late in the game. It was kind of a twitter accident
of sorts. Here was a guy recording a song a day, for the entire year of 2009. There's no
way the songs could be good, right? So like a lookie-lou at a car crash, I had to see for
myself. And I was shocked to find that not only were the songs good, some were in fact GREAT.
They were energetic, spontaneous and creative. 

Here, Lawrence has collected the tracks he liked the most and presented it as an album. 
(representing only January through September)
And it works.
As an album AND as a testament to the power of creativity within a framework of specific 
constraints. 

Although the tracks here DO represent some of the best tracks, be sure to check out his site(s).
(listed in the adeotext.nfo in this torrent) There are a LOT of great tracks left out of this
collection that I'm sure you'll enjoy. ( a few have made it to my Indie69 playlists, including
the Jan 2010 playlist )

And if you love the album as much or more than I do, consider paying a bit for it. 
His paypal address is lawrencebonk @  hotmail . com  . 

And with that I proudly present to you, Another Day On Earth, the album, 2009.
