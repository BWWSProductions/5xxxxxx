Amazon.com - There's a lot to be said for the pop Christmas album as cultural artifact. Ever since the days of the crooners, the intersection between pop song and yuletide fare has been the point where art, commerce, and ritual meet. The bigger the popicon, the more this holds true, so its no surprise that teen-pop mega-sensation Christina Aguilera's MY KIND OF CHRISTMAS proves to be a solid addition to the holiday album tradition. She tackles a mixture of the expected Christmas material ("Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", "Angels We HaveHeard on High") and more contemporary material, including asong penned by pop wizard Dianne Warren ("These Are SpecialTimes"). The production approach is a similar mix of convention and modernism, but the unifying thread is the consistently unerring vocal performances this seemingly infallible teen diva delivers throughout.

Bill Crandall, Barnes & Noble - After releasing two albums in 14 months and nabbing the 1999 Grammy for Best New Artist, the reigning teen queen now brings us something to cherish over the holidays, My Kind of Christmas. Released on the heels of her Spanish-language album (Mi Reflejo) and her star-making 1999 self-titled debut, My Kind of Christmas is more proof that this boisterous genie is not about to stay in her bottle. The album features three new tracks (not bad for a Christmas album): the fa-la-la-fueled dance number "Christmastime," the achy love ballad "This Year" ("This year I'm gonna take you home/This year I don't wanna be alone"), and the Diane Warren-penned "These Are Special Times," which covers that pesky goodwill-toward-man aspect of the holiday. Aguilera's kind of Christmas apparently also includes crazy, old bluesmen, as Dr. John shows up on "Merry Christmas, Baby." She more than holds her own with the gravelly voiced voodoo rocker, showing that she can get down and dirtier than the next gal (hear that, Britney?). Other highlights include "Oh Holy Night," which metamorphosizes from an icy church hymn into an emotive gospel sing-along, and a solid reading of tragic soul man Donny Hathway's hopeful "This Christmas." The best news is that the absence of "Feliz Navidad" leaves room for a Christina Aguilera Spanish-language Christmas album! 

Wikipedia - My Kind of Christmas is a Christmas album and the third studio album by American pop singer Christina Aguilera, released in 2000. While "The Christmas Song" was recorded during her debut album sessions, all of the other songs from My Kind of Christmas were recorded while Aguilera was on tour in mid-late 2000. The album was recorded at the same time as Aguilera was recording her Spanish-language album Mi Reflejoâ€”the albums were released one month apart. The album went platinum in the U.S., shipping more than 3.5 million copies worldwide. "Christmas Time" was shipped to radio in mid-November 2000 and served as the first (and only) single to be released off the album, though not receiving any video treatment. Ironically the track "Merry Christmas, Baby" entered the Billboard Hot Ringtones at number thirty-eight in December 2007. In addition, "Climb Every Mountain", originally performed by Julie Andrews in the movie "The Sound of Music, and which can be heard on her "My Reflection" DVD, was recorded for "My Kind of Christmas" but the song remained absent when the physical release became available. The song has yet to be leaked through the internet, or through any other available source. "These Are the Special Times" is a cover of the title track from Celine Dion's 1998 christmas album These Are Special Times.
