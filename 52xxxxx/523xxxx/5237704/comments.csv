It really spoils the download and its size means considerable wait time for me to get a crappy version.  Sorry, just my humble opinion."

,Notanumbnut,2010-08-05T21:57Z,"Yeah, what a plum.. subtitles don't affect the size!! "
,pojkstreck,2010-12-31T02:21Z,"Yes, include .sub files for English, too. Some countries are used with sub-titles in movies! It's useful if actors have english accent other then US english, especially for non-native speakers. And it's only text so it doesn't take up much space. "
