Where are the other 11 episodes?"
,PhilLesh12,2009-12-22T23:00Z,"Is this ""Unkown Episode, Something Something Something Dark Side""?"
,alt-ynb,2009-12-22T23:24Z,"it is labled incorrectly. it is actually the third family guy dvd.  It is uncensored, 4:3 aspect and will air (edited) as episode 20 and 21 (or 19 and 20) on regular TV.

This is the lowest quality out there of this movie.
there is a 700mb avi version that is larger size, by Vision, and is better quality.

There are also two 720p versions.  One is 1.5GB (and has frame drops on video playback) that includes audio commentary.  The other is Family.Guy.Something.Something.Dark.Side.720p.BluRay.x264-OEM

I am still downloading that version, so I do not know if the video playback also has frame drops or if the commentary track is included or not."
,janizuka,2009-12-23T00:55Z,it's the movie Something Something Something Dark Side
,justin131,2009-12-23T05:53Z,"alt-ynb is correct. Although, the 700mb release by Vision is stretched slightly horizontally making it wider than the 4:3 aspect it should be.

I am downloading the OEM release personally. It has the correct 4:3 ratio."
