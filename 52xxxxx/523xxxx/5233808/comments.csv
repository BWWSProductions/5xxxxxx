,Blaze_Of_Glory,2009-12-22T15:42Z,"I have installed and works. But, just so that people are aware, SAS 4.31 scan lists the patch as a ""Trojan.Agent/Gen-HackPatch"", which is more than likely a false positive.  "
[V],Slickinator,2009-12-22T21:13Z,yes it is a false positive because even look at the name a gen=general and hack = what it does so its just one thing they do to try and stop patches being used
,Blaze_Of_Glory,2009-12-23T00:34Z,"Exactly Slick - BTW, thanks!"
[V],Slickinator,2009-12-23T03:16Z,your very welcome have a great christmas

,Wolfbyte696,2009-12-27T05:07Z,"This torrent downloaded quickly and installed, but the patch will not work for me.. It says that paroduct activation is needed. Any suggestions? "
[V],Slickinator,2009-12-27T05:58Z,what i have found is if you restart your computer in too safe mode =  hit f8 right away before you see the windows logo and pic safe mode and login and do the patch it will work if having problems try it and see what happeneds good luck
[V],Slickinator,2009-12-27T05:59Z,and also you can't have sas runnning at the time ether just right click on the bug and exit also 
,ribber88,2009-12-28T15:22Z,"ty slick nice program :) just a fast question meaby stupid but when i scan for threats etc i find this Trojan.Agent/Gen-HackPatch"" should i just let it be and dont remove that when found ? thanks for a nice torrent 100% clean and working "
[V],Slickinator,2009-12-29T02:46Z,yes most of those are just the av getting rid of the patch or keygen and are not bad at all the only time i see that is when theres no real danger just labled that too only give it a name
[T],junoon,2009-12-30T05:55Z,"hey dude.. its asking me also for activation code even after successful patching,.. mayb i shud try in safe mode..."
[T],junoon,2009-12-30T06:57Z,no.. i didnt work for me safe mode either :(
,ribber88,2010-01-01T14:33Z,"Seems i cant update from today  for some reason it says , 

There was an Error trying to retrieve definitions.make sure your firewall is not blocking superantispyware.exe from accessing the internet.
turned of my firewall and antispyware still getting same error :("
,ribber88,2010-01-01T22:22Z,"Works to update for me now , dunno why that error came up but working perfect now again.."
[V],Slickinator,2010-01-02T05:18Z,not sure why people are having problems mine has always worked from first day i installed and tested before uploading if anyone is having problems make sure you uninstall and reinstall again and try running patch inside the install folder enjoy and hope the newyear will bring great apps lol
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-02-27T20:41Z,"Manual Update Question:

1. Download ""SASDEFINITIONS.EXE"" from the web site.
2. Extract the two files, ""PROCESSLIST.DB"" and ""PROCESSLISTRELATED.DB"" and copy them into the Program directory overwriting the existing files.
3. Or, just double click the installer and let it update them automatically?
4. Restart program.

I need to ask because I tried this both ways and the ""Core"" and ""Trace"" version numbers did not change?"
