,Shadow_Jedi,2010-01-03T12:17Z,"@ TvTeam: Thanks a lot for your 'Jersey Shore' uploads, as you seem to hold a monopoly in this show; being the only uploader of it. With that being said, if you could please upload these without raring them unless its out of your hands. This isn't a major concern of mine since it doesn't take long to un-zip them, however, it really doesn't save much space. Also, it has been awhile since the last episode...do you still plan on uploading this show or have the new episodes just not been aired yet? Again, thanks for the great work TvTeam!"
