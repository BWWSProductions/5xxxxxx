,smoketwojoints,2010-01-31T15:48Z,"Does anyone know how to get the patch for this? I have spend hours on end trying to get the patch to work, sometimes it patches some files but it ends up corrupt, other times I reinstall only to be told ""software not found"". I have tried everything I can possibly think of here and am desperate to get this patch working. I heard there was problems with 64 bit as well (which I am using). :("

,Teempla,2010-06-08T22:38Z,"Works fine for the first 30 mins. Then the lagfest starts. Only way to fix it is to restart the game from desktop. Has happend 5 times already and Im about to uninstall the game and removing the torrent from my client.

Waste of time, if you ask me.

By the way, my PC can run the game. The lagg starts excatly after 30 minutes. There is no way Im going to reinstall this ""longest game to install + patch"" crap again. It is a shame. Afterall, the game was epic."

Tried making it a iso file so the autorun worked but nothing, and the bin files witch are the content of the game cant figure out what to do with them. BTW im not a rookie, first time a game beats me. And the reason that the game tells me that is already installed is cus i downloaded the TPTB version first but it had sounds problems, and because it didnt installed and just ran from desktop i just erased the files (big mistake) so now my pc thinks it is installed but dont know the rute to fix it"

,Darkling1,2012-01-10T18:03Z,I've downloaded alot of games and I've had some tough ones I had to hunt down better cracks and patches but I've never been beaten until now.  As fast as my machine downloads it took over 3 hours to do this 1 which is a LONG time imo.  Then the installation took over 2 hours... then the game crashed during the opening sequence.  Then every other crack I tried I couldn't even get to the menu just 3 dots like it was trying to load...
