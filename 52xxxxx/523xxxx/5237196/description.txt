           "Call of the Wild" is a modern-day story incorporating         
           elements of Jack London's classic short novel.                 
           Christopher Lloyd stars as a recently widowed man living       
           in Montana who takes his young granddaughter Ryann (Ariel      
           Gade) in for several weeks while her parents are out of        
           the country. When a wild hybrid wolf/dog shows up injured      
           on the back porch one night, Ryann wants to take him back      
           to Boston as a pet, but her grandfather knows the animal       
           will eventually have to return to the wild. To help his        
           granddaughter understand, he begins to read her Jack           
           London's "Call of the Wild" each night ... but Ryann has       
           ideas of her own, and helps a local boy train the              
           magnificent animal to become a sled dog leader. Timothy        
           Bottoms plays a dark-hearted local bully who tries to          
           claim the dog as his own, and Wes Studi stars as a             
           mysterious mountain man who always seems to appear on the      
           fringe of the action.
