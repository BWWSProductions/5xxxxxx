As you listen to Buckcherry's debut record, a significant sense of deja vu takes hold. The foundation combines early Guns N' Roses riffs with AC/DC's blues ... Full Descriptionfeel and the Black Crowes' attitude. But Buckcherry has its own spirit, using these influences to create a new and unique sound. Co-produced by Terry Date (Deftones, White Zombie) and Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones, the album contains raunchy rockers turned up to 11 and slower, melodic numbers. "Lit Up", the band's hook-laden ode to the coke hobby, is an anthem for Los Angeles nightlife. "For The Movies" has an Oasis feel and is primed for rock radio. Vocalist Joshua Todd swaggers through "Lawless And Lulu", while Keith Nelson's punk metal riffs drive "Related". BUCKCHERRY is a fresh and exciting Saturday night rock & roll album that kicks the door to the new millennium wide open
