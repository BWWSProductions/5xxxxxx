The Feeble Files (1997) ppGame

The game follows Feeble, an alien who creates crop circles on underdeveloped planets for the Ministry of Galactic Uncertainty, as he falls in the middle of a plan to overthrow the vile OmniBrain, ruler of everything. An epic space adventure which sees you getting thrown in the galaxy's toughest prison, dressing up in women's clothes, and being interrogated by rubber clad space vixens - but not in that order. The game is a science fiction comedy, with a similar style of British humor to that of Adventure Softâ€™s previous games, the Simon the Sorcerer series. The Feeble Files was the sixth game to use Adventure Soft's AGOS Engine. 

This release contains the full & uncut 4-CD version, the game manual, a walkthrough, and a utility from ScummVM to reduce the size of some of the game files on the hard-drive. Look for these shortcuts in the game's startmenu.

Requires ScummVM to play. Get it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5217974
