    With India and Pakistan on the brink of war, emergency     
    talks are set up in an exclusive London hotel. Section    
    D faces its biggest challenge yet, as the team tries to  
    avert the first nuclear confrontation since the Second    
    World War.                                                 
    When the Indian delegation abandons the talks, it looks   
    like Nightingale's sinister plan will succeed. Lucas     
    and Ros place themselves in grave danger in a final       
    attempt to defeat Nightingale, but will they make it       
    out of the hotel alive?
