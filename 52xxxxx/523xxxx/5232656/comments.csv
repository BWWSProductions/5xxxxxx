,Munterfabbe,2009-12-23T02:32Z,"I'm a veteran pirate. But I REFUSE to download this out of respect for Cameron and his Masterpiece.
I'm going to BUY the Blueray, and my own 3D theater, and I'm going to watch it over and over again.
There is no way I'm downloading this to see it in some half crappy format.
You are spitting on this beautiful piece of art by downloading it.

Please. Buy the movie instead, and Cameron will surely make a sequal if it's popular enough.

See the movie in 3D, the way it is supposed to be seen. It is the only format that does it justice.
It's beautiful!!"

,Emonem,2009-12-24T22:19Z,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE MOVIETHEATERS IN 3D!!!!! IT'S SO GOOD WHEN I SAW IT IN THE BIO, JUST WATCH IT IN TEH THEATERS!!  NOT WORTH DOWNLOADING ITS TO GOOD!!!!"
,Henaris,2009-12-26T00:09Z,"What you are bichin about, if you wana go and see this movie in your 3D, in near future most of movies will be like Avatar, then all of you will stop useing torrents? Get a life! This movie looks good but story is 100% crap, so all in all I give 7 for movie cuz storyline is more important then graphics.
So suck it up and wait for Rip version or bigger version!"
,harower,2009-12-26T12:57Z,"Incase people haven't worked it out.  They have hired people to comment on torrent sites about how good this movie is and how it needs to be watched at the cinema first.  Every page of comments if full of there crap.

Considering how much this movie cost too make, I can't blame them."
,Henaris,2009-12-26T13:38Z,"Yes it cost 300 000 000,000"
,klaatu1959,2009-12-26T19:57Z,"Saw the movie in a 3D theater, do yourself and your family a VERY big favor and do tthe same.

Believe it's worth it !"
,Piratapr,2009-12-27T17:13Z,"I download it, watch, and ran to the theather for 3d mode. IS JUST AWESOME!"
[M],vicerock,2009-12-28T00:19Z,"WARNING
Do not go to any of these so called free on line movie websites as they ask you to fill out a questionair so they can get as much info about you so they can use you,re identity to get things on you,re name its called identity theft some are virus links when you press them you infect you,re pc and most are like i said after you,re id so they can rip you off they are hopeing that you are so desperate to watch these movies that you will tell them everything like i said there is no survey with them just after identity and sometimes you,re credit card details dont be fooled people do not go to any of these websites none of them are legit they are just there to scam you. better to download these movies of a uploader you know and trust look out for one with a skull by his name click on his name check out his profile or just dl of one you know so you know you are going to get wot you,re downloading"
,wewonit5times,2009-12-30T18:30Z,any descent english copies going around
,catalina79,2009-12-31T15:12Z,"Buena imagen y buen sonido. Los subtítulos de los diálogos en la lengua de los omaticayas están en ruso. 
Vale la pena ver la película en 3D en el cine, los colores no tienen comparación y el 3D, pues ya te diré. Pero este torrent es perfecto para volver a ver la peli sin tener que pagar 9 euros."
,Fordizon,2010-01-10T21:02Z,A TS how can be HQ?

,themate,2010-02-26T18:26Z,"i'm trying but still dont get it. why you ""watch in theater"" guys even bother to type comment here if you already watched the movie in theater and not going to download ? let's see when did i last leave a comment on a torrent which i dont think to download ... NEVER. it's just nonsense."
,AkaPhsyco,2010-03-01T11:56Z,"Hey MPAA you ever heard of innovation? 

Based on the condition of the movie industry over the past half of a decade, it would assuredly seem you haven't! 

Nice lame ass commercial at the beginning of your dvd menu's btw, ""You wouldn't steal a car would you!?"" 

Yea and Refer Madness was a factual depiction of marijuana use. 

The film industry has been separated from legitimate Art and Entertainment for half a century at least!

2tb and counting Dl'ed and believe me more to come!

Let me ask you this, the music industry got decimated by the digital pirate revolution, has music gotten any worse since? Haven't seen a NSYNC or Backstreet Boys in awhile. I wonder why that is?

If you really do it for the art, you should be happy to share your ""product"" and be happy with the theater tickets we buy!!!

Support Net Neutrality! Support the resistance against companies like Comcast trying to monopolize the internet and throttle innovation and connections! Write your congress/parliament, who's members time and again naively fail to understand how important a free and open internet is to this generation and the generations to come!

We all have grown up intimately connected to the internet. We've seen it sprout from a simple conversational tool in its public inception. Watched it grow into and industry must have with e-commerce. Blossom with sophisticated social networks and tools for musicians, amateur film makers and software designers to reach people in ways not even conceivable merely years ago.

 The fate of the internet; actual ""intellectual"" content, entrepreneurial availability and personal and artistic communication, is far too important to be left in the hands of people who have no reverence or little understanding. 

Thanks for your time and enjoy your content.
And thanks to all the up loaders like extremezone w/out people like them, none of this would be possible!"
,haguey2009,2010-03-06T15:53Z,"Go to the Cinema you lazy ass nonces, sat there all your life downloading, go get a job and buy a cinema ticket, or you will miss the best movie of all time. Fucking Hermits.."
