Featuring 240 A-Z entries on Christmas and New Year's Ritual and lore, Gulevich's volume is a worthy addition to the cultural reference shelf. Well researched and appealingly illustrated with black-and-white sketches, the text outlines holiday customs in easy-to-read language.

There are entries for the ancient Roman festival of Saturnalia, the Salvation Army kettles, and Charles Dickens' Christmas writings, to cite a few examples. The entry on Christmas carols offers a succinct overview from the time of the gospels to the present day. Coverage has been expanded from the first edition, Encyclopaedia of Christmas (2000), to encompass New Year celebrations in entries such as Resolutions and Times Square, New Year's Eve in.

There is also more coverage of Christmas around the world. Around 30 national traditions are described in entries such as Iran, Christmas in and Mexico, Christmas in. The text contains reference helps: a sprinkling of cross-references, 70 pages of meticulous indexing, and 5 pages of illuminated lettering with Christmas motifs.
