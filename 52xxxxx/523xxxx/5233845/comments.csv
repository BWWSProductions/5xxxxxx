i was wondering if you could upload 'it might get loud'? my brother wanted it for christmas but we couldn't find any copies in stores. i figured i could put it on his ipod as a consolation.

many thanks, and merry christmas."

I've been having real problems with your films, this one, Fight Club and Bruno. When trying to sync them to my iPod, it doesn't actually recognise them in the videos section. They don't appear, yet the iTunes shows them being on the iPod.

I've tried changing file extensions to mp4, no change. If anyone could give me some tips on how to solve the problem, I'd really be greatful."
