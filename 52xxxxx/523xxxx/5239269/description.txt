The time for the Christmas presents is here, I have today published a present for all the listeners, so enjoy the brand new mix with actual, and older dance, trance hits. Everythin once again spiced up with sampling and finest melodies :)

Merry Mix-X-Mass to all The Pirate Bay! P.S. Great oldschool look on mainpage.


** Once again the rule about "If You like it, support it" is valid. My upload needs a little bit of help, that everybody could listen to this mix. Thank you! **
