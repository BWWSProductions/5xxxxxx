,Blackwisdom,2010-03-23T20:14Z,Thanks great upload.
,johnniebrasco,2010-04-08T01:32Z,"I'm having problems with coreavc running mp4 and wmv in hd. It will play, but will not skip, Can't seem to find a way to use default decoder in mpc either. Anybody experiencing the same? Except from that, it worked great."
,fault_zone,2010-04-10T17:42Z,"Fast D/L, virus free and just plain works like it's supposed too..."
,antonmjor,2010-04-24T20:12Z,"Thanks!
Works great, it decodes fullHD on my 939 x2 4600+ without lag.
I haven't found any other decoder that could do that without an overclock :)"
,Wiltsu-boy,2010-05-20T16:34Z,CoreAVC vs ffdshow?? Which one has better quality in x264 and DivX?
,Groottenn,2010-05-27T07:12Z,"@Wiltsu-boy :
CoreAVC is THE way for x264, believe us.
No. Better than that, test it for yourself.
Go to the CCCP site and see the documentation about it.
And for DivX, i go for ffdshow.
Besides, thanks for the upload, aoloffline."
,Wiltsu-boy,2010-05-28T15:38Z,"@groottenn

Should I use MPC or MPC Home Cinema or what player? Currently im using MPC Home Cinema."
,Wiltsu-boy,2010-05-28T15:40Z,"Oh, and is high bitrate in video good? Like in audio, higher is better."
,Groottenn,2010-05-30T09:56Z,"@Wiltsu-boy :
Yep, stick with MPC Home Cinema. I always use the latest Combined Community Codec Pack (right now  i'm using their very latest beta), and i know MPC HC is stable, reliable and has way more options than regular MPC to deal with video playback.
I suggest you check this two :
Extremely helpful info (even if you're not user of CCCP) : http://www.cccp-project.net/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ and :
The home of MPC HC :
http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/
or MPC HC support : http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mpc-hc/report/9
And the second, of course, higher bitrate in everything is better. The higher the bitrate, the better the quality. Audio, video, pictures, ...
Just keep in mind that with high bitrate videos, you must have a good processor.
Hope this helps.  \m/

,vberg,2010-06-26T06:07Z,"Incredible performance.  I can watch full HD video on my Asus netbook, and the fan doesn't even speed up.
It even goes from windowed to fullscreen instantly.
I think I will buy the legit codec, it's really that good."
,hel1k3rn,2010-07-28T06:25Z,"just a heads up to everyone with win 7!!!
if you already have some version of haali media splitter installed then remove it before installing this release,because there's this slight possibility of all hell breaking loose [explorer crashing in an endless loop] upon you if you fail to do so :/

,arbalest22,2010-07-29T12:18Z,"Is there something special you have to do to get it to install? Every time i try it asks me [open] [save] [cancel] if i push open and internet explorer window opens then it closes and the open, save, cancel window opens agen. :("
,shawni0010,2010-08-13T20:20Z,I Love this program. Thanks a bunch!
,pandachino,2010-08-21T22:53Z,"Incredible speed, tested no virus and works like charm!! Thanks for this great release."
,pandachino,2010-08-21T22:59Z,"@hel1k3rn thanks for the tip, I should read your comment before... I was breaking my nuts with that problem... but thanks to you I solved!! Thanks"
,globalpuffer,2010-11-30T07:37Z,"H.264 :) thank you, thank you!  Works Perfectly.. Installed now on 3 of my laptops.. Win 7.  :) And.. thanks again.  :)"
,enriquejones666,2010-12-24T12:00Z,"Works Great! (Scanned with NOD32 4.2.67.10, and confirmed what everyone else is saying - it's virus-free).
Anyone using the 1.7 or 1.9 version should upgrade to this 2.0 version. I was using 1.9, and some of the recent .mkv movie releases were stuttering and had bad display corruption. Upgraded to 2.0, and playback was beautiful and smooth as butter."
