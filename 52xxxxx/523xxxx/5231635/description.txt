A young Russian band playing pop-rock. 
The band was formed in 2006 and had successful perfomances in Vologda region (North-West of Russia). Then the guys took a break and gathered again in spring 2009 but with the other drummer. Their first recordings appeared in November 2009. Now you have a great chance to download them right here! Enjoy =)
