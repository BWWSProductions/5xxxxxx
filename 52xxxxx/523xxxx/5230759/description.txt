Notes: Would you sign this band? Sounds like this comes from an acetate (there's a pop or two at the start of 'Keep Yourself Alive' but I didn't want to start messing around with the sonics of this) - I got it from the 'In the Beginning' bootleg. There has been some confusion over 'The Night Comes Down' on this demo, with some people claiming that it ended up on 'Queen'. While the same basic take is indeed found on Queen's first LP, it is an entirely different mix, particularly as regards the vocals and drums - the version here has never seen official release.
