[T],Games4theworld,2010-08-05T14:40Z,"Hello,


First try to close all software running on the background, especially downloading software, like uTorrent and Bittorrent clients. If that didn't help, try the following:

1. Uninstall the Game.
2. Restart your PC. (!)
3. Reinstall the Game.
4. See if it works now."
,CrakaJack,2010-08-25T05:52Z,Hey i really need help. I download the game with bittorrent but the EAsetup says i need to insert a CD and Saboteur Application says the program cant be started because bink32.dll is missing from your computer? please help
[T],Games4theworld,2010-09-04T11:29Z,"Hello,

 Download the missing .dll file from www.dll-files.com and the drag & drop it to: C:\Windows\System32."
,paraplegicpanda,2011-05-26T16:40Z,"Seed, please! I was getting almost 1m download overnight, now all of the peers have disconnected. For the record, I'll be leaving it up to seed until the ratio hits 5.0 like usual."
,C0rnH0lio,2011-06-08T21:28Z,"@scarletpimpernel
