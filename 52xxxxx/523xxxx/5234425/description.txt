Yes, I know I've uploaded this before...


but you can now burn this to a blank DVD in minutes.


I trust you know how...


Superb audio and video quality...


And I'm uploading this again in order to annoy some of you...and in order
to satiate the lust of those of you who want to watch a top copy of one the
finest concert performances I have ever seen...


I watched this for the umpteenth time last night...still cannot get over
just how good this is.


Awesome.   So if you like Queen, this is a must!!!


If you don't like Queen...your soul is beyond all redemption.
