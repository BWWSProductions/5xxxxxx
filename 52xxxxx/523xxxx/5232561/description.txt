Release Notes - The Bonus Disc or Soundtrack is a Multi-Media CD-R Disc. Meaning 
                you can play it in your CD-Player and listen to the Audio, and you
                can place it in your computer and access the bonus features 
                (Windows Media Player is best to use for PC). Try Exploring the 
                Contents of the CD you'll see the 2 mpg movie files, pictures, pdf 
                file and wallpapers. The Main Ps2 Game is a Regular DVD5 Disc.


You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.

The game revolves around the young girl's imagination and attempts to get accepted by a social group of other children at the orphanage.

At one point in the game you come across a dog who is essential for the finding of items and progression through the game.

Players must guide Jennifer and her faithful companion Brown the dog through the game while avoiding monsters and other unpleasantness to find precious items for the Aristocracy of the Red Canyon.
