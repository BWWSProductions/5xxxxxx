Britainâ€™s Closest Encounters Season 1


Information:
Beginning this week is a brand new, four-part documentary series that examines the most astonishing and baffling UFO stories from around the UK. The opening instalment looks at an incident dubbed the 'Welsh Roswell'. In 1974, locals near the Berwyn mountain range experienced an earthquake and reported seeing green lights in the sky. Some have claimed that a UFO crashed into the mountain and that the government has tried to cover up the truth.

Having held on to classified information about UFO sightings in Britain for over 30 years, the Ministry of Defence has now made the sensational decision to reveal all. In response to requests made under the Freedom of Information Act, the MoD plans to make available some 200 files detailing mysterious cases across the country since the 1970s. Starting this week, Britain's Closest Encounters reveals the fascinating stories of these British 'X-Files'.
