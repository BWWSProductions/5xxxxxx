Others won't even open. I've tried changing the extensions to .rar and .zip and they just come back ""file does not appear to be compressed."" If the files are indeed bad, then there's no point in spreading them around."
[T],shipjolly,2009-12-25T17:39Z,"You know what I'd really, really wish?
People who don't like my torrents, DON'T download them, it's a simple idea, yet stunningly clever.
Everyone of these files opens with CDisplay, everyone of these files opens with the whatever it ends with, be it CBR or CBZ.

Again I urge you, if you don't like it, don't download it."
,CaptainMidnight,2009-12-25T18:32Z,"My mistake. It was a different torrent that had the errors.

But your defensiveness is unwarranted. If there's an error in a comics torrent, how am I supposed to know that it's bad without downloading it first? There are some older comics torrents still out there where half the files have the wrong extension. If there's a problem, then people SHOULD be letting others know via comments what they need to do to get them to work. Am I wrong?"
,CaptainMidnight,2009-12-25T18:33Z,"By the way, ""use CDisplay"" isn't a perfect answer. Not everybody uses Windows."
[T],brodahisou,2009-12-27T23:48Z,"I beg to differ CaptainMidnight, shipjolly's ""defensiveness"" is completely warranted as there is absolutely nothing wrong with his torrent.

shipjolly never stated that CDisplay was the ""perfect answer"" they just stated that all the files contained in this pack open in CDisplay.  If they open in CDisplay they will most likely open in any image viewer.

Here's some advice.  If you're going to slag off a torrent, get the right torrent for a start, and if you're then shown to be an idiot for slagging off the wrong torrent don't have a go at the uploader for telling you there is nothing wrong with the torrent or make other foolish statements.  It just makes you look even worse.

shipjolly puts a lot of effort into compiling; creating and uploading these weekly packs he doesn't need people like you make his life any more difficult.  

I would like to extend my thanks to shipjolly for all the packs he?s created and uploaded over the last year.  You are a true gentleman, all my best to you in 2010."
,CaptainMidnight,2010-01-02T05:00Z,"If he wasn't defensive, he could have simply said, ""I've checked them and there's nothing wrong with them."" That would have been the end of it. Being defensive is saying, ""If you don't like it, don't download it!""

As for CDisplay, just because it can open a file doesn't mean it's easy to watch them. With some other torrents floating around the Net, up to half of the compressed files had the wrong extensions. So you wouldn't know which ones would decompress and which ones wouldn't, then had to go and change the extensions on the ones that wouldn't, which is a bear unless you have a batch renaming utility. Even with such a utility, you have to play musical folders, shuffling around the cbr files that need to be named cbz while trying not to rename the cbz files that need to be renamed cbr.

I was man enough to admit I was mistaken. Are you, brodahisou?"
[T],brodahisou,2010-01-02T18:07Z,"I am 'man' enough to admit I'm mistaken, when I am, which in this case I'm not.  You had a go at SJ for no reason whatsoever.  Yeah there are some dodgy files out there so go and inform the people who have uploaded them not SJ."
