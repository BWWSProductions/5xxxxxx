,HelicopterBen,2009-12-23T05:24Z,"I cant stand grainy shitty 700 Mb rips...I dont care about bandwidth or diskpace, gimmie quality..thank you Ben"
[T],metalcore.,2009-12-23T15:02Z,why you lie about compression? terminator slavation would without question come on a dual layer dvd (as all new mainstream dvds do)....so therefore you DID COMPRESS IT WITH DVD SHRINK . 
,HelicopterBen,2009-12-24T07:55Z,"@metalcore- You are right- I used DVD Shrink and I'm not trying to be misleading but im not trying to LIE either,  Just trying to attract a certain demographic that doesn't like 700MB rips. What would be a better description for future reference?"
,dragonheart666,2009-12-26T15:10Z,"@metalcore:

most who download with torrents would know what you state. that does not change the fact that 700mb rips are shit, and that a 4 gig DVD shrink rip is much much much better.
so be more polite in the future. we need each other, and bad mouthing is good for nothing.
and thanks  Ben. keep it up."
,lizardomanson,2009-12-27T16:11Z,did you compresses the sound? does this have subtitles?
,HelicopterBen,2010-01-04T06:09Z,"@lizardomanson   No sound compression- or whatever regular DVDshrink rip is, minus subtitles and minus other languages"
,HelicopterBen,2010-01-18T09:46Z,I use IMGburn to burn .iso's
