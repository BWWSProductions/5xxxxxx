Here are some great albums from Sweet Water, one of my favorite bands forever! Their small time band, that I'm sure could of made it big if they really wanted to. They've hung around Seattle for their whole time playing, and I believe they tour sometimes. Check 'em out, if you like their stuff please find a way to support them some how! They're great guys, and a great band! Thanks a lot!!
