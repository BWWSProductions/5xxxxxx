,Mr.noGay,2009-12-22T06:17Z,"well, thats a good decision :D, keep 'em coming."
,HeWillSeeTheBigBoard,2009-12-22T14:37Z,"sweet, what about the classic Disney ones? any plans on doing those?"
[T],Akamaru-,2009-12-22T22:32Z,"@ hewillseethebigboard, yes i have done a few 
Sleeping Beauty ( 16:9 widescreen and also 1080p)
Pinocchio ( is 4:3 aspect ratio on the blu ray i have no idea why)
Snow White ( also 4:3 aspect ratio )

Keep in mind that the were all ripped of a blu ray but 2 of those movies have been made 4:3"
,HeWillSeeTheBigBoard,2009-12-23T19:36Z,"oh i didnt know that you did those 3, that's cool and yes i know that two of them are in a 4:3 aspect ratio but i prefer that rather then having them cropped (see dbz remastered).
and talking about anime, what about them, will you do any of them or are u not into anime. cus if u are, samurai champloo the complete series came out on blu-ray and apparently it's amazing. 
good day to you sir."
