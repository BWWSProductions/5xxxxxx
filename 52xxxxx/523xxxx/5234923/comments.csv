,greenwhite4lyf,2009-12-29T12:10Z,"Password and Product Key work. But midway through the installation of AutoCAD Civil 3D the installer asks to insert ""AutoCAD Civil 3D Disk 1"". I have used winrar to unpack and then mounted the .iso on virtual drive created by PowerISO. 

Someone please help!! "
,hans8765,2009-12-30T17:37Z,Is it multilingual?
,mystery33,2010-01-13T08:21Z,Thanks for this!  I desperately need it for college!  Just wondering if the instruction file (to install) will be in English? as will the program? thanks.
,microsoftee,2010-01-18T16:26Z,Is it English version or Portuguese or multilingual?
,microsoftee,2010-01-20T14:29Z,Is it English?
,microsoftee,2010-01-20T14:30Z,Anybody downloaded and installed? Is it English version?
,drunkenclaus,2010-01-20T22:10Z,"Downloaded and installed on Windows 7 - 64bit.  It's english, and the install instructions in the .rar are in english also.  I ran the setup, and I guess it only installs the x86 version, so the x64 keygen didn't work.  I had to use the x86 keygen, and it worked fine.  Thanks for the upload."
,11western,2010-03-05T15:40Z,"I forget how to get the dll file to change. I went in, erased, pasted and it says wrong path (or whatever). checked the settings and it not read only, went into win32 hosts (like I did with illustrator) but didn't see anything to change.
How do you change the dll file so it'll stick?"
,11western,2010-03-05T15:43Z,"Also I'm assuming that once the dll file is changed it will no longer say ""trail version"" you've got 30 days left? Is that right?
Will check other d/l's of this since it's been a month and 1/2 since anyones been here...lol"
,nirgoen,2010-03-17T17:28Z,"thanks, i hope it will also work for me"

,bisflick,2011-03-11T04:53Z,"Cannot register. Tried Keygen x64 and Keygen x32. Received a ""Registration- Activation Error"" Installing on Windows 7. Any suggestions?"
,analgrin,2011-03-24T21:12Z,"@ bisflick
I had the same prob with a different autocad, dont supposed you use comodo antivirus?
if so make sure sandbox security is disabled, that fixed it for me."
,tpbfmb10,2011-05-16T19:37Z,hey the 64 bit keygen aint working. anyone got it to work?the 32 worked fine but i really want the 64 bit to work
,danilopaiva,2011-08-31T15:19Z,"Matheus esse autocad funciona no windows 7 x64?
Fui instalar e deu ""Error applying transforms. Verify that  the specified transform path are valid.#281"" ou seja, teria q estar em algum lugar especĂ­fico, tipo na raiz?"
,illdecide,2011-10-03T00:46Z,"I downloaded the software fine and carried out the instruction as stated...however, my laptop runs a 32 bit and the download only has a keygen for a 64 bit. the 64 bit still generates me an activation code but this does not work and the software is still unregistered...can anyone suggest how i get around this...do i need a 32 bit keygen? or has the software company caught onto illegal piracy and altered it...lol???"
,seekerofrock,2012-04-10T14:37Z,Awesome.  Just read the install file (it's in English) and you get step by step instructions.  Follow those to a tee and everything works perfectly...nothing tricky.  I'll seed this for a bit.
