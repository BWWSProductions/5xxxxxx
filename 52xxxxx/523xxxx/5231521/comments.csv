,basik77,2010-03-15T10:07Z,nice one! and GOOOOD lil GAME!
,larrwood,2010-03-26T19:02Z,Wicked fun game! Just a hint for u who go mad trying to figure out what to do...in the top right corner of the game there is a box u click on for a cartoon like picture to show what to do...but first u have to play a mini-game with this little key to unlock the book that gives u the hint. Easy to play at first...but man it does get complicated but a very challenging game with hours of fun...Enjoy!
,seebee0509,2010-04-06T13:53Z,thanks!!!
,yoshez,2010-04-09T22:25Z,no viruses no crashes awesome dude thanks
,mrndor,2010-04-11T15:56Z,You can use an exe2swf converter to convert the .exe into a .swf that is playable under other OSes than windows. It should work everwhere where a flash 10 player is available.
,admx,2010-04-16T20:03Z,"BEST GAME EVERRRRRR!!!!!!!! Really fast download, very simple to install, everything works perfectly!!! yaaay! \^o^/ "

,sorcgsdf,2010-06-07T16:17Z,"@Andreo
Its english ^^"
,kolokythis,2010-06-12T20:14Z,The game all the time freezes for me and I have to restart my computer. Any help?
,kolokythis,2010-06-12T22:10Z,Figured out. You must disable the hardware acceleration of the Adobe flash player. To do so right click while the game is playing then click on the first icon on the bottom. Uncheck the hardware acceleration. If this doesen't help then put the full screen option off.
,transitvan,2010-06-26T16:38Z,"Great game thx!
For some reason I save the game and when I play it again it shows no save data. Anyone else have this problem? It means I have to start from the begining again...bummer!"
,raziel07000,2010-06-29T05:36Z,yeah transitvan me too i saved the game but when i tried to load it showed empty slot i dont know how to fixt it but it's strange appearly almost anybody didnt faced that or wrote about it except you
,raziel07000,2010-07-01T00:14Z,"i found the solution , dont apply ccleaner after you save "
,mistameowpie,2010-08-07T15:48Z,"Just wanted to mention that the people who made this are doing a pirate amnesty price of 75% off right now. Works out to $5.
If you did genuinely enjoy the game then help allow them to make another one by at least giving them $5.
The offer is from August 5th to the 12th

,transitvan,2011-05-13T18:19Z,"Found a solution-
www.machinarium.net  Hope this helps, works for me on win7 32bit."
,donDjango,2011-09-19T20:50Z,"How to make it save: 
In the game, Right-click on the screen to get to the Adobe Flash Player Settings Tabs, select the little folder icon and make sure the slider is all the way to the right."
,uhada8,2011-11-29T09:07Z,"I download this only because I already bought the game (on http://amanita-design.net/) and my download link timed out. I recomment all to do the same, as Amanita Design don't make as much money as EA and the other big boys, and also their games are much cheaper and much more creative!"

,FlyinCoco,2012-05-17T16:32Z,Works flawlessly! Thanks! just click on .exe and works!
,dre48,2012-07-12T02:05Z,"PLEASE explain how to save a game properly??

I've read the comments and sliding that bar to the right in the Adobe settings didn't work. I played this game for about 2 hours and am really loving it, now I have to start all over again and I'd hate to give up on it because I can't save! Seems like it should be something so simple to solve..."
,dre48,2012-07-12T02:13Z,"Nevermind, it turns out setting it to unlimited was a problem.. Rather not slide it all the way to the right, just leave it at 1 or 10MB. Thanks for the up!!!"
,CDUKSHN,2012-07-14T11:51Z,"Scanned clean
