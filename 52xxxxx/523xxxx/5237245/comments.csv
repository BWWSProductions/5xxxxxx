By actuating the ?Islamist lever? once more, the United States thus generates a new zone of political instability that renders their presence, then their arbitration, necessary in Eurasia. This will open the ?new Silk Road,? the object of so much covetousness.  Lacking an active national middle class, the countries along this new axis of development have little chance, in the short or the long term, of asserting themselves as emergent ?partners,? future exporters of products with high added value. In short, there is no immediate danger of making them into competitors. In summary, Islamism is soluble in capitalism;  Islamism is an antidote to nationalist temptations; and finally, Islamism 
is a rampart against the ever-present threat of a return of socialism.  In short, Islamism is an essential ally of the neoliberal revival. "
