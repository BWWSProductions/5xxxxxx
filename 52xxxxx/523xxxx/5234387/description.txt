           scientists begin discovering Earth's temperature
           is rising faster in one week than there has been 
           in over 500 years, the President of the USA is   
           out to investigate the scenario. Fast forward to 
           2010, and the President then tells the entire

           state of panic and widespread decay of humanity  
           as the Earth itself begins to fall apart forever.
