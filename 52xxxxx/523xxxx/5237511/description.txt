My upload is about 70-75k max; expect this to take at least a few days. For the love of God, please seed when you finish (you do want me to be free to seed the new eps when the shows start up again, right?). If you have ANY of these from the weekly packs, feel free to help me out with seeding: just dump each of the two shows into directories respectively named "The Daily Show - 2009 [SoS]" and "The Colbert Report 2009 SoS" then drop everything into one called "The Daily Show + The Colbert Report 2009 (complete) [SoS]".  Huge thanks to npoljak who's already volunteered to do this.
