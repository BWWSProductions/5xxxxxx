,dwnunddg,2009-12-23T10:09Z,"Kriss, I see you like asian flicks aswell, may I make a suggestion for a rip? Hard to find.. : Mah Nakorn aka Citizen Dog. Exellent movie, only unavailable.. anything you can do here.. TNX I A"
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-23T12:53Z,"=)) I for example can't stand indian movies and musicals.I can stomach pretty much everything else.Everybody has a genre,language,character that they can't stand.Haven't seen Amadeus yet .I don't know what to say about the fast forward.TommyBlade2018 says that the recent releases work fine on his WD HDTV Media Player."
,TommyBlade2018,2009-12-23T13:14Z,"Yeh So Far so Good everything works for me perfectly But gotta Be Honest I haven't Checked out the amadeus yet So I wouldn't know

I'm gonna check out the amadeus to confirm what FuGGers said and I'll let you know Gopo."
,TommyBlade2018,2009-12-23T13:15Z,By The Way I enjoyed Psycho Love It Thanks Brotha
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-23T16:24Z,Thanks Tommy.
,JAGUAR7,2009-12-23T16:34Z,"Yes kriss_kringle,
As You Said ""Everybody has a genre,language,character that they can't stand.""
Mine Is May Be Musical Drama :(

As An Eg,I Found ""The Shawshank Redemption"" Great And Entertaining. 
So What? 
Another 15,546 People On IMDb Gave It Only 
1 Out Of 10 Rating To Make It #1 Movie On That Site. ;)
Funny Huh?
That's Why The World Is So Beautiful ! 

You Won't Believe, One Of My Friend Is Trying To Learn Mandarin Just To See Those Great Movies.
Dubbing Almost Ruins Great Movies Except Very Very Fews Like Chasseurs de dragons (2008).
English Version Was Great.

And As You Told About Indian Movies, Just Try To Find The Right Ones For You.
You Are Talking About A Huge Country With Multiple Languages Man!
I Don't Think You Can Describe All Of Them By Only Saying ""Indian Movies"".
I Was Wondering Which Indian Movie Made You Standing Against The Whole Country! 
"
,TommyBlade2018,2009-12-23T17:13Z,"Just Confirmed As I'm Typing This I'm Watching It

Works Pefect On My WD HDTV Media Player

No Fast Fowarding After About 28mins...

Frekin Quality Is Brilliant, Thanks G

I Wanted to see That Killin Field But Didn't Get a Chance To Download It, doing So Right Now."
,quenne14,2009-12-23T18:25Z,thank you much!!!!
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-23T18:54Z,"Jaguar in the first place their movies are cheap as hell,extremely cheesy and 99% of them are musicals.I saw a movie once on tv with Salman Khan and the guy was fighting with some other dudes with a rubber sword! I mean c'moon...a rubber sword!! The thing was moving everywhere.And on top of that I think he was trying to dodge arrows with it,I don't remember everything in detail.Bollywood's goal is quantity not quality.Thanks for the info Tommy,good to know that it works.I will upload a bit later The Goonies and tomorrow The Hunt for Red October:D"
,TommyBlade2018,2009-12-23T19:59Z,"NP Gopo, Indeed
Nice... Can't For For Your 2 Upcoming
Appreciated

"
,JAGUAR7,2009-12-23T21:42Z,"
I Agree With You kriss_kringle.
Quantity Over Quality Is Always A Problem.
But Very Good Movies Are There Too.
As You Said About Musical, 
Songs In Indian Movies Are Like Bed-Scene In Hollywood Movies. They Must Be There With Or Without Reason! :) 
Salman Khan Sucks Most Of The Time!
Try Some Aamir Khan.
I Am Giving You An Open Suggestion!
Hope You Like It.

[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-24T13:04Z,I'll have to see Slumdog Millionaire these days and see what all the fuss was about.
,JAGUAR7,2009-12-24T17:56Z,"Slumdog Millionaire (2008) 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/

Is Not An Indian Movie. 
Only Some Indians Worked In This Movie.
Production And Direction Is From UK.

Somehow [Credit Goes To Director, May Be] The Jury Found Real India So Amezing That It Got The Best Picture Including Other Seven.
Music Was Superb Indeed.

The Irony Is 
""It Is Very Hard To See The Things That Are Real Close.""

The EnglishMan Proved That Once Again."
,Xstoner89,2010-01-02T09:10Z,"Just dl'ed it. Audio is in sync and the video is great. For everyone who loves this movie, I suggest you get this version its great. Thanks alot Kriss        =)       A10 V10"

[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-12T22:39Z,"I will ask everyone who downloaded any of my movies and liked the quality to give them +1 quality because I saw some movies with a lot of thanks comments and -1-2 quality.That's just retarded if you ask me...so remember,+1 if you like the quality. "
,Wilddj,2010-01-19T18:51Z,"I dont kno y u people are discussin abt slumdog when u hav got a gr8 movie in this torrent.............bcoz i am Indian and I kno pretty well abt most of Indian films i am giving u a vague idea............Slumdog millionaire is a typical indian film(if u watch satya,company,yeh hai mumbai meri jaan,)..............the only fuzz abt it is that it somehow managed 2 get som oscars and the media hype got worse....................the movie is nt worth to be in the tail of som gr8 films like Lagaan(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169102/),
Rang De Basanti(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405508/),3 idiots(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1187043/),Taare Zameen Par(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0986264/),Dil Chahta Hai,Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge(Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge).Range De Basanti,Lagaan Almost got in2 oscar 4 jus 1 category.Bcoz this was under foreign production and dirctor it got 2 several category. Personally i think above stated movies are GR8 and these movies r the EMPERORS rather than hyped slumdog............."

,zdude123,2010-06-05T04:42Z,The video is not playing for me. This file is MP4 (for God sake!) with some stupid AVC1 codec. VLC fails to recognize the video even after I have installed fddshow.
