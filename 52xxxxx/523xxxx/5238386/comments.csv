,DaNtsu,2009-12-25T12:01Z,"Excuse me, but what does STV stand for? 
And as for the torrent, I know the quality is good and the movie doesn't seem bad either, thanks!"
,lnostdal,2009-12-25T12:54Z,"Thanks for the torrent!

However, I am not pleased seeing .rar-files. I understand the benefit on USENET, but there is no benefit to this on a .torrent-site.

Instead of the author of the .torrent unpacking _once_, at his site, each person (downloader) will now have to unpack on their sites and keep pretty much two copies of the same data around so that he/she can watch while seeding.

This means that fewer people will seed -- and I am amongst those people."
,rens0000,2009-12-25T13:31Z,"Amen to that lnostdal .

Thanks for the up guys!!"
,1argonaught,2009-12-25T19:12Z,Is this movie any good?. And whats it about. SWEET.
,perryl,2009-12-26T05:56Z,"zmacdaddy, just because your incapable of using rar files, does not mean there is anything wrong with them.
its very simple. right click any one of the rar files and click extract here and within a minute or so you can watch your movie. 
it will be in the bottom of the folder and work just as well as any other file you can download. 
so whats wrong with it? 
thanks tvteam for the upload. will post a/v later. "

You missed the whole point of his argument you ass-hat.......

He, and a number of others (me and lnostdal at 2009-12-25 12:54 at least), think that the RARs are annoying.

Not because we can't use them you huge giant dick......it's because using rars means less people seed the torrent at the end of the day.

If you download a lot of stuff then you eventually come to the problem of running out of available space on extarnal HDs and your PC. Why would you keep the RARs when you have the extracted file!!!

And before any dickhead says about the fact that I haven't uploaded any torrents on here.....it's because I upload my torrents through tapedown.com mainly (428.92GB and counting) because I u/l a lot of music."
,Robo88,2010-01-02T20:07Z,Rar files? why???
