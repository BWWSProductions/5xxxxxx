Cycle 2 was produced for NBC's 1981-82 season, kicking off in October of '81. For the new season, the 90 was dropped from the name and the show became SCTV Network, and the show received a facelift - a new generic opening, theme music by Ira Newborn, along with new logos and bumper graphics. Sets were changed as well - Guy now has a large wood-paneled office.

It is a superb set of shows, featuring among the finest wraparound concept episodes in CCCP1, Zontar, The Godfather, and the Staff Christmas Party.

*In January 1982, NBC aired three specials of repeats from previous shows billed as The Best of SCTV. The two last shows in the cycle also feature an SCTV Classics segment of repeats to end the show. (This heavy use of repeats was used as a plot element in the first show of cycle 3.)
