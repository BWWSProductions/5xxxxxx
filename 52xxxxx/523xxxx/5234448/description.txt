Hey guys, I've coded a simple application that launches different MW2 versions (that you can select) 

You can load:
1.0.159 (Automatically injects the console unlocker)
1.0.169
1.0.172
1.0.174



This tool is useful for guys that do a bunch of testing and tweeking. Anyways I use it alot, so i just shared it.
Keep in minds it can have a little bug or two lol  


EDIT 2: The tool now backs up your old game exe and dll before switching; when you close the launcher it restores your old game exe and dll.

EDIT 3: I've added an option to launch the game in full screen or windowed mode, also you can specify resolution.

EDIT 4: Some bugs were fixed (The steam path wasn't saved the first time you launched the program, you had to close the program before it took effect.) And support for version 1.0.174!
