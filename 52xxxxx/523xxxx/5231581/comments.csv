,ShirokuChiBara,2010-05-08T01:53Z,qwertzo .arc is a file compression... you have to download a decompressor and extract it.. then it is vallid

,Telegraphon,2011-02-24T15:10Z,Thanks! Seed!!!!!!!!
,catthou,2011-05-11T00:08Z,"It really works. For super real! They need to start porting this series to PC again, I would so buy. For now, this'll have to do. Thanks for sharing, will seed!"
,khariii,2011-05-17T03:34Z,"Works very well in PCSX2 0.9.8.
Just enable DX10 as opposed to DX9 and go from there. I get 45 frames per second on a really low end graphics built-in Radeon HD4200. It slows down on certain cutscenes to where everyone sounds sort of drunk, but besides that it runs very, very smoothly.  If you don't have a modded PS2, then download PCSX2 on their site. Comes with plugins for it and everything. Kingdom Hearts works, Metal Gear solid 3 works [not as well], GTA works. Most games do, just depends on if it's DX9 or 10 really. You can get BIOS's for it on piratebay as well."
,khariii,2011-05-17T03:35Z,"And if you want to play Gamecube and Wii games, get Dolphin, much more stable than PCSX2. "
,OmegaTaurus,2011-07-03T17:38Z,"Hey thanks for the seed. Uploaded super fast. Game seems to work perfectly on PCSX2 0.9.8 but I'm having a slight problem. When I try to load any saved game, it won't load stating ""Corrupt save data. Unable to load"". Any suggestions to get it working?

Once again thanks for the upload"
,OmegaTaurus,2011-07-03T17:39Z,"Sorry, that should be any FFXII game save, not ANY game save. I'm not having any trouble with any of the other games I've got.

Thanks for the help"
,diamondjoequimby,2011-07-21T20:11Z,"@OmegaTaurus
I've only encountered that problem with cheats enabled. Try disabling cheats and see if it'll work."
,SchismMax,2011-08-20T07:59Z,took about an hour for the eta to go from 2 days to 6 hours :P
