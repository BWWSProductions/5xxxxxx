,therSEME,2009-12-28T01:27Z,"I take my complaints back. Fixed the Max4live problem (to anyone experiencing a similar problem - fix it by renaming Max-related .dlls in the \WINDOWS, \WINDOWS\system and \WINDOWS\system32 folders) and it works like a charm so far. Great release!"
,jimmay,2009-12-28T11:42Z,"thanks for the share man, installed smoothly, and works perfect. I haven't had any errors of any kind, this one is way more stable then my 8.0.1 I've been using.

This one's definitely a keeper.
Great job, as usual, AiR

AiR is keeping this fucking scene alive"

,nebraska79,2010-02-19T10:41Z,"IÂ´ve just downloaded and when I try to open it, thereÂ´s a message from Ahead Nero that says that I have to get the latest version. What to do?"
,jtroudman,2010-03-10T09:07Z,"If you have a library problem at the start, you have to go to preferences/Library, click on change folder and select an existing folder; that way, ableton will have an existing folder for his library and he will rebuild everything based on the pre-installed packages he has."
