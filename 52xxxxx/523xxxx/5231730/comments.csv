[V],verovenlo,2009-12-23T03:09Z,np dont worry about i just hate people who dont seed and give others a change to finish the torrent also
,mrsrob,2009-12-23T17:43Z,I try to seed until my laptop shudders to an halt and screams ...no more..no more.............. It then locks itself and will only come back on if I speak to it nicely for an hour or so lol
