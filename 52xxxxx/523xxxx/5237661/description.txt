Storyline: In rural Texas, welder and hunter Llewelyn Moss discovers the remains 
of several drug runners who have all killed each other in an exchange gone violently wrong. Rather than report 
the discovery to the police, Moss decides to simply take the two million dollars present for himself. This puts 
the psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh, on his trail as he dispassionately murders nearly every rival, bystander
and even employer in his pursuit of his quarry and the money. As Moss desperately attempts to keep one step 
ahead, the blood from this hunt begins to flow behind him with relentlessly growing intensity as Chigurh closes 
in. Meanwhile, the laconic Sherrif Ed Tom Bell blithely oversees the investigation even as he struggles to face 
the sheer enormity of the crimes he is attempting to thwart.
