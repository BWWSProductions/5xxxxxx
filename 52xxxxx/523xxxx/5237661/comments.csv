,ChillyCrossFoot,2009-12-24T01:26Z,"I have never made a request but I can only imagine how good SecretMyth's WaterHorse Legend of the Deep would look. Thanks Myth. I don't know how you do it, but you do great. I've known about you since before you were this popular. I remember your pre-720p h264 rips. You rip like you are the one who invented h264 mp4 format. Just amazing. Also the quality seems to be going up on all your rips. 2 Movies to a DVD is not so bad at all. Thanks again for everything!"

Another Top #250 From Secretmyth.
