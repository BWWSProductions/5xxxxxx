,porterpotty,2010-06-19T07:06Z,"These is a solution to the mouse not reaching the bottom of the screen.

You have to lower or raise the resolution until the mouse can move the bottom of the screen.

I found something else thats buggy. When retraining units, the number of troops in a unit should be replenished to full. So say you have 16 archers left, it should go back up to 40. But even after you retrain the unit, the archers stay at 16. This kinda made it a lot harder for me to play the game since i didnt know units could merge. 

Theres another bug in the battle mode, sometimes when going forward, and i take my hand off the keyboard, i keep going forward. very annoying when cavalry is galloping around my infantry and headed for my archers. The way i fix it is to press the key in what ever direction im going in. So if im going backwards i would press ""s"".

Anyway anyone have a solution for the retain bug?"
,rocksinmysocks,2010-06-19T10:12Z,"for those having the bouncing icon, but failing to start problem.... after you unzip you need to move the unzipped ""Rome Total War"" folder that is inside the ""Rome Total War"" torrent folder to your applications.

,slam999,2010-07-01T07:05Z,"Porterpotty, the retrain ""bug"" probably isn't a bug. If that city cannot recruit a unit of that type, it can't refill those missing troops, but it can retrain that unit for better weapons, armor, experience, or other building-based upgrades. Take those archers back to a town that can build archers.

I am having the file not found error, too. Not sure if it is a bug or a path problem. It only happens when attacking certain cities, and the game seems to play anyway but with some pathfinding errors. "

1) The known mouse issue. Kinda hard to play when you can't bring your mouse to the bottom where all the importtant buttons are (Switch turn, unit advance stances, etc..).
2) With the mouse, rotating to the left works like a charm, but rotating to the right is has more lag and slower than going to the left. But the keyboard button ""e"" rotates right without the lag.
3) The water colour bug in the game, not a huge problem for me, on the battlefield the water is its usual colour.

So besides these 3 problems, the game works perfect. I find that the sound and audio is good despite what people are saying. If anyone has a fix for the mouse situation, please tell me about it.

To clarify: after step 1 in the installation instructions is complete, you'll have a Rome Total War folder in your downloads, and another Rome Total War folder inside that folder.  That latter folder is the one that the instructions refer to, to move to the applications folder.

,matty777,2011-09-19T03:13Z,I had a problem when i recently downloaded this game a while ago with playing Barbarian Invasion Expansion. I could open the game but I couldn't play the game though. 
,matty777,2011-09-19T08:49Z,"to the idiot godwin 99 who posted a link to a pc download of barbarian expansion on a mac download page, I applaud you. You are a seriously gifted problem solver. You really haven't solved any problems here because I use mac os x as my operating system and not windows. "
,JrvUnleashed,2011-10-05T10:25Z,Same problem as everyone else on the 2011 13 inch Pro. Black screen with some colored boxes and music. It gets to the main menu but the display is all screwed up.
,adiutrix,2011-11-10T16:08Z,omg thank's i wasn't sure if this was gonna work while i was extracting the files because a couple of error messages popped up but after it was finished i hopped right into the game
,dreampopscavenger,2011-12-28T15:13Z,"hey i´m on a mac book pro 13 i7 too and I have the same problem, the game starts but you cant see anything besides some purple/red textures  and you can draw as if you were on the Paint program, oh and music´s on but thats it. Probably it doesnt work on the new mac book. If anyone knows whats happening I would appreciate it a lot, thank you! "

,ifly6,2012-01-29T15:01Z,"I think I know why the MacBook Pro can't run this game - it requires a compatible graphics card. The MBP uses Intel HD (or something like that) 3000+. Most older white unibody/polycarbonate MacBooks use a NVIDIA graphics card (mine being a GeForce 9400M). If I'm correct - its not the wrapper, its the EXE which was designed to run on something with a video card, and not is not compatible with the Intel Chipset GPUs."
,ifly6,2012-01-29T15:04Z,Also godwin99 wants you to download a EXE file then replace the one currently in the ~/App./RTW/Data folder - thats called PROBLEM SOLVING. This is why all the Windows people hate Mac people... ...other than that they're just jealous of how good our computers actually run =P
,Vaisya,2012-04-19T01:34Z,"hey, NEED help for 1.6 Patch, .exe , said ""No prior installation was found, for run this game i use crossover, Please HELP !!!!!    nice torrent anyway work fine for me"
,nightraider92,2012-05-01T10:23Z,Has anyone managed to fix the screen problem with the little boxes once you start it up? Running on Lion which seems to be the problem.
,Vaisya,2012-06-13T13:16Z,"hello, this is a great torrent and via crossover its working just perfect, barbarian invasion also / thanks to the patch / so my point is, when a little genius will be able to provide a Mac version for Empire tw and Napoleon tw -    ???  thats it , long lives for Mac users "
