,Keepzitreal,2009-12-29T21:22Z,"For now, I highly recommend sticking to version 1.0.166. It works well. Many people have reported .172 and .174 with many disconnects. .166 is cracked and fully playable. I even have a little clan who we play alot of Ground War and such. Games are put together at a decent rate. Not far off from the latest version.

If you want any help getting set up, go to http://mw2clananti.co.cc/forum/ post under Introduction-->MW2 .166 and I personally will do all I can to get you set playing with the many people on this version. Be warned, you might meet a few hackers, but my clan and I play legit and for fun!! Check it up lil' homies."
,CRimsonEagleX,2010-01-08T00:57Z,idk if this works but the 1.066 or whatever is full of hackers........... every game atleast one. most often 2. without the ded servers these games are crawling with hackers and faggots that cant play without them. making it very frustrating to play... thats y i started looking for further patches in order to stray away from them. does anyone know what i can do because its annoying the fuck out of me...!
,svadilfari,2010-01-13T15:12Z,"currently playing 172 and having alot of disconnects lately, only things that seems to work fine is FFA, enough cheaters on 172 as well
it was fun for as long as it lasted"
[T],liluser,2010-01-14T19:34Z,"mw2 updated now to 1.0.175
