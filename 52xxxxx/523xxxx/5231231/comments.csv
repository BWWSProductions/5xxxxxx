Your opinion is duly noted.... but I am sure that you would not want to be intolerant of someone's opinion... also you would surly not want to encourage people to be narrow minded!!

Lets let the good people read it and decide for themselves if it holds water."

Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.
Is he both able, and willing? Then whence cometh evil?
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God.
- Epicurus, 33 A.D."

And yet you go on the porn downloads and basically tell everyone that are downloading them that they are sinners and that Jehovah should ""touch them in a mighty way.""  How is THAT not intolerant?"
,jotham574,2011-01-14T20:24Z,"You are right...... about one thing!
I am convinced that there is one true God and He is intolerant of sin. He will judge sinners and all who do evil when He comes. I do not hate you because you disagree with me....
I pray for you that you will accept God's great gift of salvation made possible by the judgment He poured out on His Son, Jesus Christ, so that you will not have to suffer eternal damnation."
