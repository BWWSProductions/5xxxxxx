It was never intended for Gaga, whose label released a formal statement that she has no association with the track at all. Gaga writes her own songs and does not accept demos. Kanye West posted Eva's song on his blog claiming it was Gaga & Rihanna. He apologized the next day for being an idiot, but he should also apologize for being deaf."
