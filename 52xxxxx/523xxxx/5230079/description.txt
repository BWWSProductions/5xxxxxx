Mazda3 2004 to 2006 Service Manual. 

You may have to be a bit creative in running the iso but it works.  I used Firefox or Opera to access the html files. IE doesn't work well. 

Sorry, I dont have any other manuals just this one.  Hopefully, people will be able to grab it before tpb deletes it. Feel free to upload this to other sites as you see fit.
