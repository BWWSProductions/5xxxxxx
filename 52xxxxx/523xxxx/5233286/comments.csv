,miaruehl3,2009-12-22T01:16Z,It says release date 12/29/09 today is the 12/21 how can it be a dvd rip and it hasn't been released yet.   I am guessing this was never in the theater- but still I'm confused.  Now maybe I'm a little slow can someone help me to understand.
[V],MKVGuy,2009-12-22T01:50Z,"its a direct-to-dvd feature film, means its not going to be released in theater..
and pirates are everywhere in the world so one would have got it when it was on the way to shops and online websites, haha.."
,alex_1432,2009-12-22T11:06Z,"i beg to disagree.  MKV is great.  this 400 mb size mkv file trounces the usual 700 mb avi in terms of quality in my opinion.  

thanks MKVguy for providing a great alternative over the usual avi file format.  "

,dragonzer0,2009-12-27T04:33Z,"Thanks for the upload, but file can't be converted and needs to be if you wish to burn in DVD format that a DVD  player will recognize.
Before comment is made I am using an MKV to DVD, AVI MPEG or any other file extension. It actually locks the app. due to a file error."
