,klu9,2011-05-02T14:40Z,"Some notes now that I've almost finished watching all the files in this torrent.

Video source: looks like PDTV broadcast.
Video: 6.5/10 (a little less than I'd have liked, but tolerable)
Audio: 9/10, WITH an important caveat.

The sound cuts out before the end of two episodes: s02e18 and s02e20. With e18, it's only the last 10 secs, but with e20 it's almost 1 and half minutes.

And in both cases, they're cliffhangers, so it's a real pain.

(I tried playing in both VLC and MPC-HC, same prob in both.)

In the case of e18, the subtitles also finished early; but only one word was missing and I could guess it from context, repeat playing and lipreading :D

In the case of e20, I turned on the subtitles and read them to find out what they were saying."
,Dingle182,2011-08-08T10:37Z,"@Eugene 
if you by some absolute miracle happen to read this, if your using vlc, youll notice there are what look like double arrows at each end or below the video progress/time bar. you may have clicked one slowing it down, just click the right one to speed it back up"
,malikgcl,2011-08-31T11:05Z,seed please
,debtirtha,2011-09-23T17:41Z,RiddlerA The subtitles are not matching...cannot find any other that sync to your files...pls help...
,emikacic,2012-01-01T16:20Z,Slowest download speed I have EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. Utorrent is on 24/7 and the UpSpeed is 70.00 KB per second and the downspeed 1 KB per second! Driving me crazy! I wouldnt have downloaded this from you if I had anopther choice. 
,Mesohappy,2012-01-16T00:50Z,"Emikacic Dude Chill
The original download was 2009 December but 2009. Where lucky to have it even if its slow.
If you want it fast go to Best Buy:)"
,musabmsd,2012-02-12T20:46Z,Leechers.. Please try to seed for a change!! :((
