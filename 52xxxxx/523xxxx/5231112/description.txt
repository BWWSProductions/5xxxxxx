For Those Who Care:

I am done uploading in the .mp3 format, its encoding algorithm is old and aac far surpasses the quality levels that an mp3 can produce. So if your looking for less quality go somewhere else.  (My files are the closest to the lossless source GUARANTEED)

I Stand Behind My Bitrates and Authenticity... Enjoy and Seed

==============================BITRATE TUTORIAL=================================
Below I will show you how to easily determine if an AAC or MP3 is truly 320 or just a re-encode...

You will need the torrent listed below to start then follow my steps... 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3883065/Adobe.Audition.v3.WinAll.Cracked-NoPE


1. Open adobe audition and click on edit

2. Drag and Drop (or add) the mp3/aac file into adobe audition (aac must be wav)

3. Click on "View" and then Spectral Frequency Display (Shift+F)


A true 320 source will be 20Hz or above..(JOINT STEREO WILL RESULT IN LOWER FREQUENCIES) (Lower Quality)

128 Re-encodes or 192 re-encodes will be stuck @ 16Hz or 18Hz...


NOTE: There is an exception for this rule; oldies,acoustics,piano songs,and low volume music Will have lower frequencies even if encoded with 320!
=================================================================================

What is normalization?

The Normalize effect amplifies the entire file or selection equally. For example, if the original audio reaches a loud peak of 80% and a quiet low of 20%, normalizing to 100% amplifies the loud peak to 100% and the quiet low to 40%.
