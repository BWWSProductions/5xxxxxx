There use to be a quick and simple method where you could get the .ram (real player extension) file off the iplayer source code and then convert it to mp3. But now they have changed the source code using java script or something. 

I love listening to bbc radio 1 - fab & groove, kutski, annie mac, jules, pete etc. I dont like the method of using a audio recording software because it takes too long, if its possible to bypass the new script and download the main file and convert to mp3 that would be wicked. Let me know mate."
