Torrent includes:
- A Wizard of Earthsea (1968)
- The Tombs of Atuan (1971)
- The Farthest Shore (1972)
- Tehanu: The Last Book of Earthsea (1990)
- Tales from Earthsea (2001)
- The Other Wind (2001)

First two books were ripped directly from CDs using iTunes. The last four books were originally uploaded by someone else on Rapid Share. The quality of these files is acceptable at best; I have no idea what media they were originally on, but I'm guessing the person transferred them audio cassettes.
