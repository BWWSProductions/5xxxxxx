SUBS:
====
I found this one on the net:
http://subscene.com/english/No-One-Knows-About-Persian-Cats/subtitle-288145.aspx

If you have NoScripts or any tool blocking scripts it'l ltell you the sub was not found!

I am not sure if the sub is good for this torrent, since the sender/uploader has synced it for this torrent:

Have fun"

,indie69,2010-04-23T19:11Z,Iran is the unquestionable center of the world when it comes to poetry. To see it's expressiveness and potential in related areas like music and lyrics censored and repressed is sad and a huge loss to the world.
