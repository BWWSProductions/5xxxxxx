,Spartan_300,2009-12-24T03:49Z,"Thanks for the upload,..."
,flarngus,2010-03-17T23:04Z,"Doesn't work on Windows 7 64-bit.  It starts downloading some crap called Auto Movie Maker.  Damn shame, edited a lot of videos when I had this on Windows XP."
,ripp1916,2010-04-04T10:30Z,"@flarngus
Win7 x64 working 100%, run installer in compatibility mode for XP."
,dogman514,2010-04-09T22:32Z,"Thanks works great,just remember to copy the files in the crack folder one at a time,have been using it for a couple of days now no problems,again thank."
,Lassik,2010-05-12T10:33Z,"As flarngus said, does not run on Windows 7. Tries to download updated files right at the start prior to installing.

@ripp1916 of course it would run in XP compatibility mode but that not technically running in Windows 7. XP compatibility mode actually starts a Virtual Machine that runs a freely provided copy of Windows XP that takes up a portion of your systems resources. Saying that it runs in XP compatibility mode is like saying it runs on Windows XP. This is known.

Something like WINE in Linux could be considered a ""Compatibility Mode"" but calling a Virtual Machine with a copy of Windows XP running on it is not something I would call a ""Compatibility Mode"". Of course you didn't name it this i know but just so you are clear that running it this way does not mean it's running in Windows 7.

If I install VMWare Workstation in Windows 7 and install Ubuntu Linux in it and then install a Linux program inside of that, it doesn't mean that program is now compatible with Windows 7."
,Lassik,2010-05-12T10:41Z,"Disregard what I said about the compatibility mode. I was confused and referring to something else. It does work with the Windows 7 Compatibility mode.

Just right click on the file and select properties, then go to the compatibility tab and select Windows XP."
,Kiweed,2010-09-24T00:14Z,hmm it says 42 seeders and 0 leechers here but in utorrent it says 0 seeders and 42 leechers... WTF is going on???
,Kiweed,2010-09-24T02:05Z,Ok seeds thingy fixed itself and when i install it the demo works but when i have copied the crack items into the dir. (both at same time and seperatly) and try to start it again it says there are files missing plz reinstall....??? anyone else have this prob? P.S. the other video edit magic torrent by blackcat or wateva works no prob without any need for crack serial or anything.... wierd...
,tauro202,2010-12-02T19:42Z,AWESOME DUDE!!!! Works a charm Thanks!
,ShadowMastr,2011-05-12T20:03Z,"Worked fine on my Win 7 Ultimate. Just like others have said, run the installer in xp compatible mode and it won't download the version that will run on win 7 natively.... (is that a real word??)"
,Stig_gitS,2011-06-01T16:38Z,This one works fine (crack and all) on XP. Thanks mate
,decebal2003,2011-06-19T00:48Z,"READ THIS FIRST FOR WIN 7 USERS:

Just right click on the file and select properties, then go to the compatibility tab and select Windows XP, like Lassik said. "
,sharlynn001,2011-09-07T08:08Z,I just downloaded this and AGV says it has a WIN32 HEUR virus??? so it is now in the trash can. 
,clonies,2011-09-20T21:15Z,"This is not what it says. When I click the installation file, it installs Auto Movie Creator. What a ripoff!"
,sparkyy35,2012-01-16T13:59Z,"Download the install file from here.
http://video-edit-magic.en.softonic.com/download
Copy and paste the crack files over the ones in the install folder. Works fine"
