Obama will be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10th -- yet he is leaning toward sending more troops to Afghanistan, escalating the war!

After 8 years of war, $228 billion have been sunk into Afghanistan, and thousands of U.S. soldiers and Afghan civilians have been killed or permanently disabled.  And for what?
 

    * 80% of Afghanistan is still controlled by religious fundamentalist warlords
      who cut deals with U.S. forces.
    * U.S.-backed President Karzai was just â€œreelectedâ€ using blatantly
      fraudulent, corrupt tactics
    * 2/3 of Afghans still struggle to survive on less than $2/day. (Food and
      Agriculture Org.)
    * 77% of Afghans still lack access to clean water. (UNICEF)
    * Female literacy is still at 14%. (UNESCO)
    * A majority of Americans (57%) are now against the war. (AP-GfK Poll 10/05/09)
