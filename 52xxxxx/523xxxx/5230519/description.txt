"The Legend of Xanadu" is a single by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich that reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in 1968, and was the group's biggest hit. As with many of their singles, it was written by songwriters Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley, and like many of the group's recordings, it features a novelty element - in this case a trumpet section, and the distinctive sound of a whip cracking in the chorus. The musical accompaniment was directed by John Gregory.
