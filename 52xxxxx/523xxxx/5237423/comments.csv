When I tried to see if it would extract at 99.8% (which it was stuck at for 2 days), Microsoft Security Essentials called it harmful. I don't like the thought of hiding an executable. Shouldn't this have been sequential image or at least pdf? Just saying. Nice try though at adding some different things on torrents. Too bad it's crap."
