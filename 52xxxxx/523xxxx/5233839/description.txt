Jerusalem: Center of the World (2009)

Jerusalem is arguably one of the most fascinating and complicated cities in the world. This program draws on religious texts, the science of archaeology and oral traditions passed on through millennia to try to determine why this small city has occupied the minds of so many for so long. Host Ray Suarez of THE NEWSHOUR leads viewers to the holiest sites of Judaism, Christianity and Islam - on the land, from the sky and underground.
