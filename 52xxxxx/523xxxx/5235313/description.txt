Presented by Mark Coles.Island Records Special
As Island Records celebrates its 50th anniversary, 
The Strand talks to founder Chris Blackwell about the label's history. 
He shares his memories of the label's early days in Jamaica 
and how he made the transition from selling records to 
nurturing the talent of some of the biggest names in music.
The label launched the careers of a wide range of musicians from U2, 
Cat Stevens and Grace Jones to reggae artists like Toots and the Maytals, 
Sly & Robbie and of course the reggae superstar Bob Marley.
Chris Blackwell was also an early supporter of African musicians like Baaba Maal, 
Angelique Kidjo and Salif Keita.Music expert Jacqueline Springer
joins Mark Coles in the studio to discuss the rich musical legacy of a label that, 
some say, has changed the music industry forever.
