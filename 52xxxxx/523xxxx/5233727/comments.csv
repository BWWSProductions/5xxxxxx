Whilst listening to a few of the songs which weren't totally downloaded yet, the missing gaps would be filled with music I recognized as being a song by tegan and sara. I don't have any music by them. Weird as all hell, a ghost in the machine?"
,eurtek,2010-06-07T01:58Z,"Dearghoul, It was indeed a ghost in your machine. Basically, what you are hearing is something that was on your drive but you deleted. Deletion actually just marks the space the file occupied as free for overwrite. 

Then your torrent program came along and the OS assigned it that space for the files being saved. So when you tried to listen to the incomplete song, you're hearing what used to be in the space it is going to be saved to. 

It can happen with anything when it comes to viewing partially downloaded files, but it is rare since the formats have to match or it wont be read properly. "
