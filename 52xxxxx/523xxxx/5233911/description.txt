First time recording video. Shot from Sec 104 row M on a monopod. I had a few dancers in front of me who caused some problems: bumping 
the camera, body parts in front of the lens. The movement of the camera is typically me trying to reposition/hold it somewhere they wouldn't
be in the way. So sorry for the bumpy parts. No zoom, only full stage shot. Music synced to video on stage screens.

Video cuts during So Damn Lucky jam, very beginning of Squirm, and Time Bomb jam due to battery changes. Added screencaps for visuals.


Thanks to:
Matt and John for the tech support
Kayla for the picture
The Warehouse for actually giving me seats in the 100s for a change
