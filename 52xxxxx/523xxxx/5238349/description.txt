Beautiful Eyes is an 
EP
 by American 
country
 artist 
Taylor Swift.
It was released on July 15, 2008 exclusively at 
Wal-Mart
 stores.

 A limited number of albums were pressed so that the album would not be misidentified as Swift's 
second studio album,
which was released on November 11, 2008.

 As of November 2009 the album has sold over 500,000 copies.

In its first week of release, the album sold 45,000 copies, debuting at number one on the 
Billboard 
Top Country Albums
 chart and number nine on the 
Billboard 200.

 With her 
self-titled debut album
 at number two the same week, Swift became the first artist to hold the top two positions of the Top Country Albums chart since 
LeAnn Rimes
 did so in 1997.
