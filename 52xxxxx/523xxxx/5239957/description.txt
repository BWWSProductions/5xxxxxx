This is the original, untouched Mac DMG of
Dragon Age Origins Deluxe which I bought from Direct2Drive.

This is not [k]'ed, its doesn't include any kind of serial,
but I'm sure some smart guy will get it working in a few days
and provide a [k] here on TBP. Be patient or try to crack it on your own.

Since this got officially ported by Transgaming, its basically the PC game
in a professional Cider wrapper, a [k] from the Windows version might work.
***EDIT, as of now, no cracks from the Windows version are working***

This release is English only. If you like it, buy it - to support the
developers and publishers and encourage them to release more popular games
for the Mac.

The torrent includes the game, its manual as PDF, wallpapers,
the soundtrack and all of the bonus DLCs.
