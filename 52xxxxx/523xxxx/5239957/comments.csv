,Bustacoal,2009-12-25T08:09Z,I've been having issues downloading from TPB lately. Some files work but others don't. Specifically MW2 and this game. They both show up with a red X in utorrent after a few seconds =( Any insight?
,SMEEEEEEEEEEE,2009-12-25T08:37Z,"@Bustacoal

I think the problem is on your end, it is running fine for me. Check that the app you are using isn't fire walled and that the port you are using is open. Or even try a different app maybe, I'm using Vuze and getting around 400 kb/s"
,Dragonforce79,2009-12-25T10:28Z,"About playability, I can only speak for my systems, and that is for one an early 2009 Mac Pro with the ATi 4870, which runs this game silky smooth with everything maxed out, and a MacBook Pro from 2007 with the 8600MGT, which plays this game decently on mid/high settings. The new iMacs and unibody MBPs should do even better. Hope that helps."

,sparrowhawk13,2009-12-27T13:35Z,"So I checked the crash log file and apparently the crash is tied to d3dgl.dll

I checked the windows directory in the package and d3dgl.dll wasn't there.

So....I downloaded it and put it in with the rest of the .dlls

AND........

The error went away!  No crash!

BUT....

Now I get an error message ""Failed to detect a supported video card""

I am running with a Nvidia 8600GT, which IS supported according to the BioWare site, but still no go.

I checked the config file and apparently the gfx driver field is set to ""macdrv"".  There is an entry further down for ""d3dgl"" with a bunch of settings, so I changed the gfx field to ""d3dgl""....that didn't work either.

Anybody?"
,Zhyro,2009-12-27T16:00Z,"@sparrowhawk13

Were did you find the d3dgl.dll file?

would like to give it a try."

,sparrowhawk13,2009-12-28T00:12Z,"@Zhyro

I just did a google search for d3dgl.dll and downloaded from one of those driver sites.  You can go here and download the file.  It's from 2004, though....not sure if there is a newer version out.

Just drop it in your system 32 folder in the wine build of windows included in the package."
,sparrowhawk13,2009-12-28T00:14Z,Apparently HTML codes don't work in comments?  http://www.nodevice.com/dll/d3dgl_dll/item4981.html is the link for the driver.  Lemmie know what you get.

,sparrowhawk13,2009-12-28T02:50Z,"Yeah, I'm messing with stuff....trying to bypass the graphics card check...no luck so far.  I've looked at other cider games, and they seem to be using the ""sdldrv"" graphics card options rather than ""macdrv"", which is what it is set to by default.  I'm kinda stuck at this point.  I added a [dlloverride] string for the d3dgl.dll in the config file in bin_ship (just copied the one above it and changed name to d3dgl) and that seems to revert back to the original exception error crash, even though the d3dgl.dll is still in the sys32 folder.

Switching the graphics card string to ""dlsdrv"", ""opengl"", or ""d3dgl"" all result in the game starting up, but no window shows (just the Dragon Age Origins menu in the Apple Menu until you force quit)  

Weird.

 I've also been trying to work around the SecuRom with the original .exe, but that isn't going so well either.  I can delete the securom folder from the DA prefs folder, but a new one is created every time the game starts up :\"

,Galaad1,2009-12-28T13:53Z,"Guys, this game is ONLY $49, about ?32, when downloaded.
Such good games are rare, and I think the developers of this one really deserve to get paid. $49 is not much, really. Frankly, just sit a few seconds and ask yourself if u REALLY can't afford this game.
You can buy it and download it here :

,bszaronos,2009-12-28T17:56Z,"Tried going into the show the package contents in the Dragon Age / Contents/ Resources/ transgaming/ c_drive/ program files/ dragon age/ bin_ship and replacing the daorigins.exe with one of the windows no dvd files, but did not work."
,sparrowhawk13,2009-12-28T22:45Z,"@KookyDave

Tried that, but the game hangs at the splash screen.  My guess is, SecuRom can't write into the folder, so the box doesn't pop up, but the game won't start without the go ahead from SecuRom, so the game just waits indefinitely.  Now if there was a program that simulated a call from SecuRom saying everything was good to go, that would be different.  Course, someone would have to port that program to mac first....

@ Galaad

Well, two reasons, mainly.  One is that Transgaming decided to put SecuRom on this release, even though it was shelved for the other versions.  Securom is an invasive bitch of a 3rd party program, and even though it is LESS invasive than the PC version (which can fuck up your registry) I still will not support any release that has Securom with my hard earned cash.

Secondly, how much of the money from these game purchases actually goes to the developers, do you think?  Not as much as you'd imagine.  Most of the cash goes to the PUBLISHER, the asshole corporate suits that think up the ad campaign and front the cash for the production of the game.  Most dev teams are on salary, bro, so I'm not hurting them (they DO get some residuals on sales, but the lion's share goes to 2k, in this instance).  By your logic, you should be just as angry at GameStop for selling games, as NONE of the profits from their used game sales goes to the developer OR the publisher (GameStop keeps it all).

Third, this is Pirate Bay.  Your pleas fall on deaf ears.  Deaf, piraty ears."

,kaskamotz,2009-12-29T15:39Z,Is there any website were we can search for the crack? Or a keygen that works?
,sparrowhawk13,2009-12-30T02:53Z,"There is no ""Keygen"" for SecuRom, as far as I know.  SecuRom connects to an online database with a list of codes, so you either have to hack into the database and insert bogus codes (good luck with that) or write a program that intercepts SecuRom and tricks it into thinking it has the right code. OR write a patched exe that cuts securom out of the mix altogether.  The problem that I see is that all the current cracks out there are made for the PC version, which didn't have SecuRom, so it's not a SecuRom workaround, it's a No-Dvd patch.  THIS file, however, is a copy of a direct download only version of Dragon Age ported in Cider specifically for mac, and Transgaming put SecuRom on ALL Mac releases, so someone will have to specifically make a crack for this exact version.  Messing with wine prefs files is one thing, but a cracker I am not....

Guess we just have to wait."
,Mac-Patte,2009-12-30T15:36Z,"like sparrowhawk13 is saying, its not that easy to crack this, cuz the crack have to be applied on the .exe-file, and the cracks for the winverion isn't working.

,aowin,2010-01-08T17:34Z,"I've bought the game, and beside the fact that its truly a very good game, it also runs very good on my iMac. (iMac does get real hot though).

It would be nice if there would be a demo available, it might be cheap but you don't know what you buy which can make it expensive if you don't like it. But after 4 years of World of Warcraft its really nice to play this one (and cheaper). And I love the pause and save options :)

,AppLeo,2010-01-08T19:37Z,"Guys, there isn't a crack (yet). For to be the first to  play, have a look here sometimes http://www.mac-bb.org/showthread.php?t=44857&highlight=dragon+age+origins&page=20

They are working for a crack!"
,twinzrule,2010-01-08T23:48Z,i already downloaded the game and i was wondering how to get the crack once it comes out?
,Dragonforce79,2010-01-09T10:19Z,"You can be sure that this will get mentioned here. And sorry for the delay with Hacker Evolution Untold, TPB gave me 3 days in a row error messages when trying to upload torrents. Anyway, its available now."
,robin1232,2010-01-09T17:06Z,"@ruyuk
but maybe mainstreamers will finally realize that windows has been the most unstable OS all the time and they will ditch it.
also, mac would be a much better gaming device because you can optimize the game better because there are less hardware setups"

that makes no sense at all. none."
,Tseran,2010-01-13T21:14Z,"Actually, speaking as a long time programmer, this makes perfect sense.  Tighter control over hardware means less need for worrying about compatibility issues, which means more time making a better game."
,luiz77,2010-01-14T21:49Z,so nobody could crack this game?? Bunch of fools ;)
,Srombre,2010-01-15T10:54Z,The crack is ready and is going to be uploaded soon. Go on MacBB for fresh news.

,Bustacoal,2010-01-15T23:19Z,Mac BB's thread is closed tard. You have no idea what's going on.
,Tseran,2010-01-15T23:39Z,"It's closed because impatient fools decided to run their mouth instead of waiting.  There are claims of someone cracking it, but I am not going to believe it until I see it."
,thenetkid,2010-01-16T11:14Z,Someone on the Macbb thread has already cracked it :D but you still might have to wait a bit because he's trying to get his ip removed so that he won't get caught posting the crack... which isn't exactly a good thing.
,mysteryuchiha,2010-01-18T05:27Z,Still no code yet huh?
,rawstrent,2010-01-19T04:33Z,"Bros! Any word on that rg guy comin through with the crack!

Its been like 4 days! I thought he said he was stepping out for the afternoon and he'd upload it later!

sounds like we all got fooled!"
,salfanar,2010-01-19T07:38Z,"no, dude was just pissed he would get caught uploading it and being sued afterwords
do u wanna get in that kind a trouble?
just be happy somebody managed to crack it, you'll play it after some time, just chill a bit"
,rawstrent,2010-01-19T09:33Z,"do you have proof that that kid cracked it? there is 1000 ways to get a crack out! trust me I know! if he was soo worried about that he could ha simply sent it to someone with more experience.

you can't just believe every shmo who comes on a forum.. anyways i've got word that one should be up in the next few days... some guy in canada. "

great thing about the dude cracking it from canada - two thumbs"

This version of SecuRom was already removed for GTA IV when it came out.  The difference with this one is it's on a mac and no one respects our gaming community enough to go line by line through code deleting all traces of the SecuRom : (  "

,FoxUniCha,2010-02-17T01:17Z,"Is there some1 out there wiling to share a key code or even the model behind your key code:
XXXX-XXXX (or whatever it happens to be)?
Maybe try some homemade keygens, it would be nice to know what kind of model to set up to have a reasonable guess."
,PelotasUA,2010-02-17T15:07Z,"@FoxUniCha Alright, keygens won't work because the SecuRom is checking a database through Bioware's website.  Short of hacking the site and inputting your own activation codes, it's not going to work.  They only activate a code after they have confirmation of purchase since the mac version is all online.  Plus, since it's a port, one would probably have to work on both windows and mac osx to crack this baby.  I'd suggest something free like virtualbox. 

@rawstrent Fuck yes! ¡¡Viva la revolución!!  "
