"Video Phone" is a song by American R&B singer BeyoncÃ© from her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). The track was released as the album's eighth single. Before its release as a single, the song charted in late 2008 due to strong digital sales. It was sent to U.S. radio on September 22, 2009. It was going to be released on CD on September 22 as well; however, it was delayed to November 17, 2009. The official remix and music video of the song featuring Lady Gaga will be included on the 2009 deluxe edition of the album.

The song will officially be released as the sixth single in the UK on December 21, 2009.

A music video for the extended remix was directed by Hype Williams. On October 15, 2009, a spokesperson for Williams confirmed to MTV News that reports of Lady Gaga and BeyoncÃ© working on the music video together were true. The video was initially set to premiere on November 5, 2009 but ended up premiering on November 17, 2009 instead.

The video begins with Knowles walking down an alley accompanied by several men in suits, a homage to Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs. As the main section of the song begins, cameras zoom in on Knowles as she dances in a black and white latex leotard while holding sunglasses with hand signals on them. When the first verse begins, Knowles seductively dances for two men who have cameras as heads. She is also seen teasing men with futuristic toy guns while wearing a skin-colored latex top. During Lady Gaga's verse, they both sing to the camera while shooting more toy guns in open fire. Knowles next brandishes a bow and fires arrows at a cameraman who is being rotated on a dart board. She and Gaga, now in white leotards in front of a white backdrop, perform a synchronized dance together. Knowles then appears dressed as an homage to Bettie Page while handling several different firearms. Throughout the video, the two singers fire their guns and arrows at men. The video ends with Knowles shooting a gun while perched upon a stationary motorcycle and surrounded by images from the start of the video.

After the album's release in 2008, the song charted on the Billboard Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart at number fourteen due to strong airplay. After the song was released as a single in 2009, it debuted at number sixty-six on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart solely based on airplay. The single has peaked at number 37 so far. "Video Phone" makes I Am... Sasha Fierce the first album of the 21st century to have seven entries on the U.S. R&B chart ("Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", "If I Were a Boy", "Diva", "Halo", "Ego", "Sweet Dreams", and "Video Phone"). On the week ending December 12, 2009, the original version of "Video Phone" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at #65.
