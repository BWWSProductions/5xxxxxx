[T],suavecito195782,2009-12-23T22:41Z,well its a rip from the actual blu ray disk i have done side by side and it looks around the same the only thing u really lose is audio which blu ray disk movies come with dolby true hd or dts master audio so its scale down to dolby digital unkrets if ur a first time downloader to the ps3 team rips u wont be disspointed with quality 
[T],suavecito195782,2009-12-24T00:49Z,yes janiram it will play fine unless u have a netbook then i wouldn't recommend doesn't have the processing power to play this file but ur fine yes if u aint sure about the video quality download and watch these rips are the best at the size given i actually collect these on a one terabyte hard drive saves me money on buying blu rays

,xgfreon,2009-12-27T22:48Z,taz1234--- All these ps3 rips work fine on the 360 extender with 5.1DD. As long as you are using a windows7 media center.

,Tortolini,2010-01-11T17:25Z,"those M2TS movies are more like 720p, or not even that. just terrible and frustrating if you're looking for REAL 1080p movies"
[T],suavecito195782,2010-01-21T08:20Z,tortolini this is the best quality you will get for the size i even think its better quality then those 15 gigs mkv u can download so if u dont like it dont download it 
,w000ter,2010-03-15T04:47Z,"""dude, how can it be almost the same quality if blu ray uses h264 codec as well but streams at like 25mbits/sec instead of 4mbits/sec. I would think that is a huge difference but ok. will download and see. ""

yup,you don't get something for nothing."
