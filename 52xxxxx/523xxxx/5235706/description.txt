A pretty average limited thriller The Steam Expirement is now available in BluRay quality thanks to this new release from group THUGLiNE. This flick was released in dvdrip almost half a year ago and now you have a chance to watch it in hidef quality.

Kilmer plays a former university professor who overheats his hostages to prove that humans will devolve into chaos under the pressures of global warming. He tells a detective (Assante) that their location will be revealed if his hypothesis is printed as the local paperâ€™s front-page headline. The six potential victims are a former pro football player (Roberts), a former actress (Brown), a nurse (Muldoon), a waitress (Eve Mauro), a restaurateur (Quinn Duffy) and a writer (Cordelia Reynolds). As temperatures rise, the desperate detainees fight for survival.
