,mrdeltoid,2011-02-16T02:10Z,"I listened alot to Oaklandazulasylum, their first LP, in 2003 and throughout 2004. Recently i've started to listen back to that record and started to wonder if they'd released any other albums and became very happy to find out they've released this one and two more LP's. These are kinda hard to come by and so i'd like to give props to Algaris for uploading at least one of them. "
