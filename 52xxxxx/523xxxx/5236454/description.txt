Product Description:
StuffIt Deluxe is the easiest way to share large files online. Stuff, back up, and expand anything. StuffIt Deluxe gives you the power to shrink your photos, music, and other documents without compromising quality. Enjoy early access to StuffIt Connect, a file transfer and storage service. Securely store up to 2GB of files and share them via email invitations. StuffIt SmartSend takes the guesswork out of sending large files via email. SmartSend automatically compresses and emails smaller files, while larger items are uploaded to a secure website via StuffIt Connect, which allows you to download files from anywhere. Say goodbye to email bouncebacks. StuffIt Deluxe creates disk image files (DMG) directly from MagicMenu, and its improved image compressor now compresses high-quality TIFF or PNG files, dramatically reducing the size of your images without compromising their digital quality. In addition, you can now access all the power of StuffIt directly from your favorite photo editing applications with included export plug-ins for iPhoto and Aperture.
