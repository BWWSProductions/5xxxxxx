This is a virtual cockpit for Alphasim's C-17 Globemaster III. It was taken from the C-5M Supergalaxy by Area 51 since these two planes are more or less similar (size apart). I tweaked a few files in order to use this VC on the C-17 Globemaster, that means that the eyepoint is much higher than it should be. Bear with it.



This is a temporary solution while waiting for Alphasim's release of the proper cockpit.
