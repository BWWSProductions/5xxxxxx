Nero Digital Recode 2-CE can fit the entire audio and video contents of a DVD on a regular data CD with no perceivable loss of quality. This compression technology provides you with opportunities to take any video content, whether home movies or your personal DVD and compress it to only 20% of its original file size, making it easier to share online with family and friends or on consumer electronic devices. 

Nero Digital Recode 2-CE makes low quality media a thing of the past. Now you can make backups of unprotected DVDs without any visible loss of quality. This means that a whole film will fit on a normal blank DVD (4.7GB). 

The solution is both clever and simple: with Nero Recode 2 CE you can remove unwanted material (e.g. foreign language sound tracks or bonus material) from the DVD (9 GB), then convert the film and compress it so that it fits onto a regular size blank DVD (4.7 GB). 

All without any noticeable loss in qualit
