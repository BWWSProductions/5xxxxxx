Product Description:
Charles is a web proxy (HTTP Proxy / HTTP Monitor) that 
runs on your own computer. Your web browser (or any 
other Internet application) is then configured to access 
the Internet through Charles, and Charles is then able to 
record and display for you all of the data that is sent and 
received.

In Web and Internet development you are unable to see 
what is being sent and received between your web 
browser / client and the server. Without this visibility it is 
difficult and time-consuming to determine exactly where 
the fault is. Charles makes it easy to see what is 
happening, so you can quickly diagnose and fix 
problems.

Charles makes debugging quick, reliable and advanced; 
saving you time and frustration!
