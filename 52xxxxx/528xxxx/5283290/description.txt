Genre: Animation | Family | Fantasy | Musical | Romance
IMDB rating:  7.9/10   5,342 votes  

A fairy tale set in Jazz Age-era New Orleans and centered on a young girl named Princess Tiana and her fateful kiss with a frog prince who desperately wants to be human again.

Note: This is first decent TS - a second one so far (German CAM paired with English audio).
    	Since was requested, I downloaded three copies of CAMs released so far, they have been terrible. This one ain't extremely good TS, but watchable and enjoyable one for sure. Besides, it's small-sized...
