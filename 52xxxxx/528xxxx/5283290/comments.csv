[V],twentyforty,2010-01-16T09:06Z,"@kayslay: I am sorry but I can't. I have full-house today, really, four shows and god-knows-how-much movies which have been on queue almost a week. TPB upload down-time was ""just"" two days, but since I have Schedule to follow, requests come as in sort of pickle. Besides - I have never done wrestling, reality and fight-show and probably never will. Sorry. "
