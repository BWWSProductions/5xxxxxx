                    Drama about dreams, love, clothes and how we  
                    all use them to run away from who we are and  
                    towards who we should be. It's Paris Fashion  
                    Week and Ali Redcliffe has a huge flare-up with  
                    her boss, leading fashion designer, Davina  
                    Bailey. Back in London, the renowned Marco  
                    Keriliak offers Ali the chance of a lifetime:  
                    to set up her own label. But her friends all  
                    tell her he's a nightmare. Probably not the  
                    ideal time to take a chance on love with new  
                    man Chris.
