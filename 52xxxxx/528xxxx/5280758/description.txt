John Renbourn
1970
The Lady and the Unicorn


Transatlantic TRA224 

A wonderful album mostly made of old traditional tunes arranged by John Renbourn with some gust stars from The Pentangle playing ancient instruments. 
The melodies are catchy, the atmosphere is relaxed and the live bonus tracks with Pentangle are top-notch.

A must have if you like medieval music.
