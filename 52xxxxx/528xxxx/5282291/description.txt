105 years ago, on October 18 1904, Gustav Mahler stepped up to the rostrum of the GÃ¼rzenich-Orchestra of Cologne to conduct the premiere of his Fifth Symphony. In recollection of this historic moment, the GÃ¼rzenich-Orchestra under its principal conductor Marcus Stenz now inaugurates its complete recorded cycle of Mahler symphonies with this work.
