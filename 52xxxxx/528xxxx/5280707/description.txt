Description:
James Cameron has delivered some movies of monstrous proportions. Titanic, Aliens and The Terminator have all come to us courtesy of the Canadian filmmaker. This December sees the release of the long-awaited Avatar, a movie about an alien moon called Pandora and the battle over its riches. Cameronâ€™s last movie, Titanic, set all sorts of box office records. That puts the expectations for Avatar at near impossible levels and naturally paves the way for a videogame adaptation. Itâ€™s a game that I had high hopes for and though it does its best to play to the movieâ€™s strengths â€” featuring a lush jungle world and 3D visuals â€“ Avatar: The Game ultimately suffers from unpolished and thin gameplay elements.
