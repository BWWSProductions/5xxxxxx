,UFOpirate,2010-01-18T20:28Z,Have you the latest version of Daemon Tools? If not you may have to download it. Then it will work fine.
,mark-b82,2010-01-19T02:59Z,same problem as sampiero when i try to open says its corrupt when i mount with daemon tools lite starts to install but freezes almost straight away
,NLRedneck,2010-01-19T11:38Z,Dont let fool you by mr Ufo ... this one is corrupt
,NLRedneck,2010-01-19T12:10Z,"Sorry UFOpirate, seemed I was was wrong. Both Daemon Tools and MagicISO wouldnt work ..... finally succeeded with PowerISO. Thnx alot for the upload !!"
,UFOpirate,2010-01-19T14:22Z,I'm sorry for any problem. I will try to fix the ISO file and reupload it.
,mark-b82,2010-01-20T00:56Z,yeah thanks UFO good to see that some uploaders keep an eye on their torrents and reply to comments thanks again bro
,fersenhalter,2010-01-22T12:56Z,"works just like a charm for me! including an update before the first start
win7"
,doonboggle,2010-01-24T22:57Z,"Absolutely no problems.  As earlier poster says, also have gotten first update.  Use ISO buster rather than daemon tools.

THANKS UFO ! ! ! "
,Shaydee_Lady,2010-02-03T23:27Z,"I must be thick because i have no idea what to do with iso. Can anyone help, please?"
,wanderingeyes,2010-02-06T20:59Z,"Wouldn't work with Alcohol 52% (corrupt). Worked with PowerISO (burned, but failed when verifying). Disc ran and installed the program fine after that.

It's touch and go, but once installed it works fine!"
,tavery80,2010-02-08T08:12Z,"Doesn't work for me...have tried PowerISO, Daemon Tools, comes up as ""file format is invalid or unsupported""."
,Randee15,2010-02-28T02:33Z,"I used DAEMON Tools Lite v4.35.5 (with SPTD 1.62), and it worked fine for me!

Thanks for uploading!"
,lif3isfr33,2010-03-07T10:39Z,all I got was a worthless bins and cues... wtf do I do with these? 
,klink1111,2010-04-30T15:15Z,in your text doc you said contact you if i am looking for things whats the chances of you getting generations family tree (grande suite v8.5) ? thanks
,UFOpirate,2010-05-02T17:36Z,"Sry, that program is not in my possession."
[T],XeroxAlto,2010-05-11T02:09Z,"Very fast download. Mounted with Alcohol 52% and installed without problems. No account or passwords necessary. You can log on using your ancestry.com account if you wish. I have an account and logged on and it has worked great. It ties in searching very nicely. 

Nice up. Thanks for the work. I've pretty much given up torrents as it seems people DON'T SEED. I'm glad you didn't give up before sharing this. :-D"
,bob14148,2010-05-14T18:38Z,cheers ufo!
,lunette,2010-07-11T04:37Z,Thank you so much!  This is great.  :)
,kccode1,2010-08-10T19:03Z,"Uhhh, If you don't know what an ISO is then you shouldn't even be here downloading.  

Anyway.   When I get the whole file I will seed a while, but it looks like there are some good seeders.  I have a full 1Gbs download right now.  My ISP has been jacking with the lines so my bandwidth sucks sometimes.  

Thanks for the file. You need this if you share trees becuase FTM is not backward compatable and I use the old FTM17.  "
,Lasaruz,2010-09-01T18:03Z,Tack!
,Lasaruz,2010-09-01T18:08Z,Thank you!
,namsaray,2010-09-21T23:40Z,"This doen't work, period.
PowerISO, WinISO, Alcohol - same message: invalid archive. Don't waste your time."
,ears90,2010-12-20T03:01Z,Any Chance of getting the 2011 version?
,deathfromrightside,2011-10-02T08:45Z,"works fine for me. at least the first day...
