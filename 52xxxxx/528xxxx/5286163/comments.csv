,Aeon395,2011-09-15T04:22Z,"For the uploader, (as for your last remark), in the past few days I have watched several movies, all Russian classics.

1. Ivan Vasilievich Changes Occupation
    In my opinion, this movie was fucking incredible.  I laughed my ass off at some parts, and the subtitles were fantastic (except for the singing parts, but that's because they felt the need to rhyme in English).  I also believe that the only reason I found this funny is that I am learning Russian, and I understand a lot about the language now; at least enough to understand what was comical about the way in which the characters were speaking.

2. Kidnapping Caucasian Style
    A bit less funny.  Follows the classic fairy-tale style, although I though that Shpak (from above movie) played a great role, and the part about the Georgian toasts was hysterical.

3. Operation ""Y""
    Pretty good, some good comical moments, however I wouldn't say it was anything to rave about.  Favorite part was the first, but that's because I'm a guy and slapstick is just what I'm partial to.

4. The Diamond Arm
    Funny, (I've been in Gadai mode), liked this one more than Operation ""Y"".  I thought that the ""handsome"" bad guy in this one was pretty funny, his face at some points in the movie was absolutely classic.

5. Kin Dza-Dza
   Absolutely incredible movie.  The amount of social commentary one can reap from this movie is outrageous.  Many funny scenes.  Definitely a dark comedy though, as the two poor dudes get fucked around each and every corner.

6. Gentlemen of Fortune
   Wasn't able to finish, despite my wife's pleading.  Simply couldn't find any way of getting into the characters.  There just wasn't enough there for me to give two shits about what happened to any of them. "

,Aeon395,2011-09-17T07:44Z,"7. Beware of the Car
  Great movie; Innokenty was very interesting as he played a childlike man, stealing cars from assholes for the benefit of orphans.  The two criminals from diamond arm were back with more hilarity; the one who played the father-in-law from hell was fucking outstanding, laughed my fucking ass off.  Ending was good."
,Aeon395,2011-09-22T06:57Z,"9. Office Affair:  I'm not really one for romances, but I can say that this movie was definitely better than 90% of the shit that comes out nowadays.  I liked the main character, and there were some funny scenes.

10. The Irony of Fate: Another romance, this one centered around the New Year.  Funny commentary on soviet style of building, some good characters, decent dialogue.  Okay movie."
