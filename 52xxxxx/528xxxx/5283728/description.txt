Pretext-
In a time with such ignorance, in toleration, and prejudice there seems to be something lurking about, what is that, you ask? The answer may be strange and can be different than mine and even somewhat obvious; the answer is music!
Music can teach love, as well as hate. Music can change your mood, your thoughts, your personality and even your life. Who would imagine that a bunch of frequencies could do such a thing? Itâ€™s quite understandable once you bring yourself to do the research. And the reason I have this pretext is to explain to you how to take this album â€œForeshadowing Forestâ€ , if you heard the last album entitled Church Burning then you will notice the colossal difference in not only musical sound, but skill in composition and importance of notes and the direct head on timing. And for new listeners... welcome to what is Profane Ritual.
I, myself, find this Ambient album Foreshadowing Forest to be quite relaxing, mysterious, hypnotic, and even gloomy. It is best to place yourself in a quiet environment and mentally place yourself in a cold, snow covered forest, maybe a forest from Middle Earth would suffice. Let this album be a mood changer.
