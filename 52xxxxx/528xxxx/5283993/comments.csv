,carnagel1,2010-01-16T21:19Z,"It's a fake. Even the IMDB link in the actual description is incorrect, it links to a movie called 'Adventures of Power' which is a terrible movie and obviously not daybreakers. 

AVOID THIS FAKE TORRENT AT ALL COSTS"

,P.Olsen,2010-01-19T01:25Z,"This is utterly cr*p!! You need WMV3 codec, and if you open it with MediaPlayer 12, IE opens to a f**king page telling u to download some crappy media player.
It's the SECOND time they upload this torrent!!!!!"

Thanks again"
,Devils-Knight,2010-01-24T00:53Z,whats the deal on this is it fake or not some say  fake and some say not but no one has a completed download and most of the time the seeder is not on
,Devils-Knight,2010-01-24T00:56Z,and if you have completed the download and are not seeding then you are a looser and should not be making comments anyway
,Orumus,2010-01-25T23:21Z,"This is Fake, it is one of those ""Incorrect codec use Windows media player"" So that it can contact the net without you knowing thank god for VLC! Anyway 
 Burn in hell uploader and all the rest of the scammers."
