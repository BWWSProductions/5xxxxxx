,altemeldo,2010-01-18T06:45Z,"Thanx for your reply MKVGUY. StaxRIP is way too complicated. However, I've looked thru HandBrake and I can't find the option to set output file as MKV. I'll be grateful if you give me your email address so we can communicate more directly. Mine is : altemeldo@yahoo.com

Thanx."
,altemeldo,2010-01-18T07:06Z,"Hi again. I just update my version of HandBrake to the latest version (v0.94). I now can see the options to specify the container type, video codec as well as target file size. Thanx very much man. But I'll still like to have you email address. Mine is: altemeldo@yahoo.com

Thanx and God bless."
