,CaptainJacSparrow,2010-01-18T22:43Z,"Ok got past that bit now i just get black screen...hardware certainly isn't the issue, have you tried this on win 7 x64?"
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2010-01-19T05:14Z,no sorry only tried it on xp not win 7 sorry CaptainJacSparrow that it dont work for you if you like i can upload the image file and you can install the game but im not sure if that will make it work on win 7 also i know it sounds stupid but install direct x 9c on windows 7 i did once for a friend who was having problems with certain games and it worked
,CaptainJacSparrow,2010-01-19T11:17Z,"Thanks for getting back DJ, I got all drivers etc up to date so that cant be problem.  It doesn't matter about the image file, it prolly wont work on 7 due to it age, although need for speed underground etc play.  Nevermind mate I will just have to hope someone one day makes a new GP game, it's the only game I think that we cant get.

thanks anyway......."
