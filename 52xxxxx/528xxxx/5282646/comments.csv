,rdevil13,2010-01-31T07:55Z,"FAKE! Here is the proof. If you go to y-tube you can see that someone has taken the video for Jelena Karleusa - Insomnia and renamed it Lady Gaga ft. J.K. - Insomnia. Gaga's next single is ""Telephone,"" which is currently at #20 on the Hot 100, even though it's physical release isn't until Feb. 22. She films the video on Jan. 28. Some who posted this FAKE claimed that Lady Gaga has a song called ""Insomnia"" on the U.K. pop chart, which is an extreme fabrication."
