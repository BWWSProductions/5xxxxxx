I am curious though, does anyone know what the NoTV in the torrent file name means?"
,slapdatass,2010-01-16T05:32Z,@ Katrina117 - usually it's the group who releases the episode/film.
,MMdubbie,2010-01-16T05:47Z,"The format for the file names usually go:

Series Name - Episode Number - Source - Codec - Encode Group - Distribution Group.

Encoding groups are the ones who physically rip the show from its broadcast and encode it into a compressed format (usually .avi) whereas the distribution group in a network of people with superfast net connections whose job it is to seed the release to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible."

It really is a shame they canceled another good Whedon show. And Eliza Dushku played the part so well."
