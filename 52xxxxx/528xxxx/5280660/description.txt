Nicola is the fifth album by Scottish folk musician Bert Jansch, released in 1967. An orchestrated version of "Train Song" was attempted during the Nicola sessions but, while fondly remembered by arranger David Palmer, did not make the finished product. Neither did two further outtakes "In This Game" and "Dissatisfied Blues" (both of which he performed live during the city hall tour of early 1967) although they later appeared on Box Of Love - The Bert Jansch Sampler Vol. 2 (1972), issued on Transatlantic shortly after Bert had left the label. They have also been resurrected on the new reissue of Nicola.[1]
