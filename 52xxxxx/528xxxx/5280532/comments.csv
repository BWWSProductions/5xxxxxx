,CSuk,2010-01-31T16:24Z,"Thanks for the UL.

Don't think it looked like a Screener though and the viewing quality was none too good either. It was free so i'm not complaining, just stating my view.
For those who are going to D/L and watch it, this is an interesting movie but more of a documentary. Leaves you wondering!
Video - 5/10
Audio - 8/10"
