And if you do happen to know how to find it from a map, do not go after it has rained. The National Park Service has not seen fit to pave access drive at the foot of the hill and the dirt road there is often inches deep in mud. You'll need to park at the road near the sign describing the site and walk in. The site of the massacre of hundreds of Lakota doesn't rate asphalt, but the site of Custer's massacre has not one but two prepared sites, a visitor's center and the 7th Cavalry monument, both of which have improvements planned for the near future. Indians killed Americans? Let us tell you all about it. Americans killed Indians? Who cares, go get your shoes dirty if you can find it."
