TPB RULES
1) do not spam comments with your bullshit. We don't care if you run a site full of trojans and malware with the promise of ~streaming the video online~ your site is not better and is full of adware and viruses. gtfo and quit commenting every goddamn top 100 torrent with your advertisements. 

2) Stop spamming with the OMFG DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS THE PARTYVAN IS WATCHIN U bullshit. Columbia/Paramount/Tristar/FBI does not give a shit. You won't get fucking V& for downloading a torrent. The worst that will happen is you'll get a cease and desist notice or they'll block you at your IP and you can just switch providers. STFU and GTFO. Why are you even here, you noobs.

3) Don't expect to get any A/V quality better than a TS or a CAM if the film's still in theaters. Jesus, are you people retarded? either wait for it to come out on video for a better rip or stfu until you can contribute something better.

4) the main purpose of comments on these sites is to warn other users whether a torrent is legit. If it's spam, if the sound or video quality is so bad it's unwatchable, or if it's got malware. This is not he site for your shitty, pseudo-intellectual review tripe. Save that shit for your emo livejournal. Any other comments are useless here.

THANK YOU"

,cypherchaos,2010-02-08T09:35Z,"Last time I checked this was a torrent site....why must people rate anything other than the quality of the torrents? Do we really care if you think the content is good or bad? No, just rate the damn quality of the video/audio/torrent...thank you!"
,batty007,2010-02-08T21:07Z,Right on Strambona!
,vidmanflys2,2010-02-09T01:20Z,All you have to do is get rid of ALL the trackers for this torrent...I too have gotten a letter from my ISP showing what torrent I illegally downloaded & if they were notified again I would be banned from there service....just delete ALL trackers!!!

Download torrents at your own risk, especially media/software that is fairly new. I've learned the hard way. One more strike and my ISP (Charter) is pulling the chord on my internet access. Good thing they've given me two warnings, though."
,ADR55,2010-02-13T08:09Z,"hey can anyone tell me what program to use or how to watch videos like this on a 24"" monitor without them going pixelated in full screen mode. It was fine on my previous 19"".  or is there a codec ? i keep researching and nothin really works

Help plzzz
thanx"
,SalyrnaDmaw,2010-02-13T10:22Z,"If you don't want the government/other people to track what your downloading, just download PeerGuardian 2 by Pheonix Labs at this website, http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/ . I've used it in the past for every torrent I've downloaded and I've never gotten a warning for anything. It's not that big of a file and it shows you exactly what it's blocking :) Hope this helps anyone :)

BTW, I'm downloading the torrent right now so don't think I'm just a spammer or something. Thank you for the upload btw Raymond, love your other torrents as well :)"

Dear Buckeye Express Customer,

Recently a DMCA complaint alleging copyright violation(s) via a peer-to-peer (P2P) network such as Bit Torrent, Gnutella, AresWarez, etc., was submitted to us which we have subsequently tracked back to the cable modem through which we are providing your Buckeye Express high speed internet service. As your internet service provider, Buckeye takes such complaints very seriously and is required by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to notify you that said complaint has been registered. Continuing to share the material(s) listed below could lead to legal action taken by representatives of the rightful copyright holders. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that you discontinue sharing the file(s) listed below and ensure that the file(s) have been removed from your computer(s) if applicable.
