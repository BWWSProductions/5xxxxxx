Thank you thank you thank you!

This is the first I've heard of a hidden track though... how do we access that?

Ohhh man, gonna be listening to this non-stop tomorrow :)"
,DeanoElectro,2010-01-15T18:01Z,"The track follows on from 'The Light That Burns Twice as Bright' that is why it is 19mins+ long m8.

Sorry for the seeding I had a connection error, but all is sorted now :)

Seeding at full speed!!! "
,The3vo,2010-01-15T18:25Z,"YESSSS! I have this pre-ordered but i wanna listen so i'll download :D

I hope i can split up the hidden track though"
,DeanoElectro,2010-01-15T18:44Z,"Any decent software will allow you to split the hidden track if you wish to The3vo :)

Uploading at 50kbps guys,
Please seed once complete!!!"

,FallontheFeg,2010-01-18T19:08Z,Thank yoooooooooooooooooou! Been waiting so long for this album :D
,anarchiaeth,2010-01-19T20:57Z,"To listen to the Hidden track: Play the first song but go back a song at the start, this should say instead of 13, 14 but you must go back a song from the first to hear it. The hidden songs are known as 'Easter eggs' There's one on Evanescence's 'Bring me to life'."
,Skynet5,2010-01-26T14:39Z,"the whole album sounds like its bitrate was 92kbps, seriously horrible!
is it just this rip or is the retail cd also that bad?"
,DeanoElectro,2010-01-27T23:10Z,don't know what album you are listening to but it sounds fine m8 and i have tested it on many speakers
,Craigrox,2010-01-28T23:42Z,"can't wait to listen to it :)
