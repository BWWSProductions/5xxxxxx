,snper1194,2010-05-15T21:37Z,"if anyone wants to know, yes it works. i have windows 7 so dont ask if it will work with 7.
so what i did was extracted the file and i ran setup. once setup was done i want into the file where the game was installed and deleted the origanal lancher app. then i went into the crack foldder copyed the crack launcher and pasted it into the install folder then  i made a short cut with the crack launch and there u go: )
have fun"
