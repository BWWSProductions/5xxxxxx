This torrent is the Tie95 (for windows 95) collectors item CD version but with a few modifications.


The .VOC files (voices) are replaced for the much better DOS .VOC files.
The music files are replaced for high quality .WAV files (from the original movies)
A patch file is added to make the 3D graphics work (instead of your CPU doing the work although it doesn't matter much).


This game works fine with Windows XP, probably with Windows 2000 and may work with Vista  and Windows 7 although I did not try the last two.


The file is an image file from Nero (NRG). Burn it on DVD or mount it with nero, Deamon or an other virtual DVD drive.

Have fun!!
