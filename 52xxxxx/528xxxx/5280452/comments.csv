[V],twentyforty,2010-01-15T07:41Z,"@ZenRhino: Thanks for help. I woke up at 3:20 AM, upped torrent but - forget to c&p imdb link.

@zzzomked: Yeah, strange  choice, but, in mine defense, Crawling Hand is extremely hard-to-get. americanredneck have asked for help 'cause of that, even I have big troubles to find one which is alive and not removed. Quite contrary to this, as I explained few days back, Saw 6 in all imaginable colors&shapes is on ALL sited back from cam, ts, r5 and now as BDrip   or DVDrip. I felt that I do not need to do Saw 6 and I stand by that.

@sanyam: As you've noticed I use 2.0 from time of exploded star. Yes, 2.0 is the first uTorrent with udp-tracker support, but - torrents with udp trackers are usually made for Azureus, and a pair of TCP/UDP tracker addresses is most likely ""glued"" together, what causes that 2.0  cannot parse such ""glued"" pair, he needs blank lines between ALL tracker-addresses. 

So, one should double-click on such torrent and insert blank (empty) line between http and udp addresses by pressing  at the end of first ""glued"" address. If you have such torrent, you can see for yourself. Tracker servers are proved weak spot today, they can easily go down. Most likely trackers would become obsolete. DHT works fine and people should use DHT more often and without mythical nonsense about DHT vulnerability. It was maybe so in the past, but now doesn't make any difference."
