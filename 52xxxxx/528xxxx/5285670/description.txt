In the heart of Gotham's darkness glows the garish neon of the sex industry. This is where Batman's most personal, and savage, battle begins. He needs all his superhuman strength to fight the most remorseless enemies he has ever faced - those who traffic in the flesh of children.

This two-volume 1995 graphic novel scripted by Neal Barrett, Jr., and art by Denys Cowan and Prentis Rollins is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Andrew Vachss.

The novel was released during the period of the Don't! Buy! Thai! boycott. This grassroots campaign encouraged people to boycott all products of Thailand until the Thai government effectively addressed the rampant prevalence of prostituted children that has been present in that country for years and caters to prosperous foreign tourists.
