I don't want to be a pain in the ass as some guys are on so called private trackers, BUT, come on, you can wait and seed for a couple of hours and there's enough seeders left...Or am I too demanding? Please don't force me to use this wonderful option Azureus has called 'ban IP'...There's no ratio stress, but  a little -reasonable- co-operation won't hurt anybody. It would be a pity to make me do such a thing on the brink of a ........ rather long series."
