I recently created music, copyrighted and released it, however I have very few fans.
So to compensate, I've decided to release a couple for free off of my new album (the other albums are free, not this one, however.)

So here it is, two songs from my album MINDTRIP, a Drum n' Bass song as well as an Industrial song with a bit of a Dubstep breakdown.

If you like these, please become a fan on Facebook, or listen on Last.FM.
This album will be for sale soon.
