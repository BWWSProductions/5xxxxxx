,sistromo,2010-01-19T00:02Z,The Scriptures for the truth? Really?
,MojoBender,2010-01-19T00:57Z,"Precisely which scriptures should I be reading?  By all means, I would be ecstatic to find the truth in something someday.  I mean seriously, sometimes you come across a torrent, and its a cam, but it's for a movie you REALLY want to see, but you don't want to watch a really crappy cam, so you check the ratings in the comments, and you find a comment that says ""Woohoo, a9/v9!"" so you get all excited... You download it, unrar the 8,000 files, download some obscure codec that took an hour to find, and then you sit down to finally watch your movie and BAM! It hits you, this guy lied.  The movie is off center, half under someones jacket, all you hear through half of it is someone munching on popcorn, slurping soda, and releasing gasses in many bodily forms, and on top of it, the picture is dark, frame rate too slow, and grainier than the Christian depiction of the son of God.  I hate when that happens.  The truth is so hard to find."
,Cymrie,2010-01-19T14:30Z,LOL Mojo.....some people can't handle the truth ;-)
,iamadonut,2010-01-20T02:14Z,"mojobender, here is some truth for you :

Only suckers waste their time hunting and obscure downloading codecs.

Quit being a silly bitch and use vlc from videolan.org to watch movies instead of downloading codecs all the time. "

,eldiab13,2010-12-03T18:13Z,The scriptures ? oh you mean the bible - that old incomplete poorly written piece of fiction ? It's quaint but I wouldn't rely on it for truth
