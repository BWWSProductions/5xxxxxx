,DaNtsu,2010-01-18T22:08Z,"plot seems realllly complicated, is its main genre really comedy?"
,Phatfish,2010-01-19T05:05Z,"
A - Good

V - Good

M - The flow of the plot is a little bit flakey at times but so much works anyway that I would say this is a really good movie.

Its def a comedy but on the dark side. If your looking for something easy and some simple entertainment this is not for you.

Thanx!
