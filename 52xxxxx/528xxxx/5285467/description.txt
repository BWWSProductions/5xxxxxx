Paul Giamatti stars as himself, agonizing over his interpretation of â€œUncle Vanya.â€ Paralyzed by anxiety, he stumbles upon a solution via a New Yorker article about a high-tech company promising to alleviate suffering by extracting souls. Giamatti enlists their service â€” only to discover that his soul is the shape and size of a chickpea. His intention is to reinstate it once he survives the performance but complications ensue when a mysterious, soul-trafficking â€œmuleâ€ borrows Giamattiâ€™s stored soul for an ambitious, but unfortunately talentless, Russian soap-opera actress.
