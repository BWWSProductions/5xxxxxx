Texas born guitarist Albert Collins is generally acknowledged as one of the most talented and distinctive blues guitarists of his era. He established his claim to fame by creating a unique sound with his Fender Telecaster guitar; based on uncommon tunings and searing solos.

In this double, Collins plays his fingers raw, coaxing more diversity and tasteful licks out of his guitar than you'll hear on most of his studio recordings. The first disc features a much-recommended live album, recorded at the infamous El Mocambo in Toronto. The second features a 1969 gig Collins recorded at the Fillmore in San Francisco, when he served as an opening act for the Allman Brothers.
