Welcome, or No Trespassing is a clever and very funny movie for children and adults. It's a movie of 1964 that is very famous in Russia even nowadays :-) Everybody cites phrases from the movie and I think you and your kids will enjoy it a lot! :-))))

P.S. It would be really interesting for me to know the opinion on the movie of those people who don't speak Russian :-)
