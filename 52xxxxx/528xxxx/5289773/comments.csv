,jumaestra,2010-01-19T01:46Z,It also works on Windows... (It's a PDF file. Adobe Acrobat Reader can read it).
,mktg2010,2010-01-20T01:52Z,"I *never* said it didn't work on Windows - it's just that most eBooks cannot be read on Macs, and this one can even be read on Amazon Kindle (it's a simple PDF file)."

,macaddy,2010-08-16T18:04Z,This is 400 pages of the same advert directing you to some sight selling a crappy ebook!
