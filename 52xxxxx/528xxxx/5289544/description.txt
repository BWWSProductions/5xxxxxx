Plot: HeartGold and SoulSilver take place in the Johto region as in PokÃ©mon Gold and Silver. After completing the main storyline, players can also go to the Kanto region, similar to the original Gold and Silver.

Gameplay: HeartGold and SoulSilver allows a PokÃ©mon that the player owns to follow him or her in-game on the overworld. The player may talk to the PokÃ©mon, and occasionally it may pick up certain secret items. A new minigame called the PokÃ©thlon has also been introduced. The game utilizes the Nintendo DS touchscreen and allows PokÃ©mon to compete in events such as hurdling.
The games are bundled with a peripheral called the PokÃ©walker, a pedometer that resembles a PokÃ© Ball which can connect to the Nintendo DS game card via infrared signals (in a fashion similar to another Nintendo DS game Personal Trainer: Walking) and can "hold" a PokÃ©mon. Walking with a PokÃ©walker holding a PokÃ©mon increases both its experience and closeness, as well as the player's "watts," an in-game currency that can be used to catch wild PokÃ©mon and shop for items.[6][7] Despite the device being included with every game, Nintendo announced that the games would carry standard pricing (around Â¥4,800 in Japan).
HeartGold and SoulSilver can access the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and are also fully compatible with PokÃ©mon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.
