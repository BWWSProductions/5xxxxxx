"Lookin' for a Good Time" is a single by American country music trio Lady Antebellum. It is the second single from their self-titled debut album, as well as their second Top 20 hit on the Billboard country charts. The song was co-written by the trio's three members (Dave Haywood, Charles Kelley, and Hillary Scott) along with Keith FollesÃ©, and it features lead vocals from both Kelley and Scott.

"Lookin' for a Good Time" received a "thumbs up" review from the country music site The 9513. Although reveiwer Matt C. called the storyline "fairly pedestrian" and said that the producers "[did] their best to ruin" the song, he also made note of Kelley's "distinctive, husky voice" and the alternating lead vocals, adding "Iâ€™m not likely to confuse this group with any other artist on country radio, and when you combine this special quality with two fine vocalists and the trioâ€™s generally smart (if unremarkable) musical sensibilities, I have a hard time imagining the Lady Antebellum single that I will truly dislike."
