Controversial academic and author, Camille Paglia, was part of the ROM's Director's Signature Series entitled The Three New Commandments, coinciding with the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibition. Paglia describes herself as an atheist who defends religion, explaining that an understanding of world religions and their symbols is essential to fully understanding human civilization and our place in the universe. She also devotes part of her lecture to Hollywood and how it has dealt with religious themes throughout its history, culminating with an entertaining critique of Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments.
