You see i'm kinda new here and i really wanna help... but the thing is i'm not bright about seeders or leechers, could you explain me the concept and also let me know how excalty to seed"
,gsa13,2010-01-28T20:47Z,"Hey Sam,

Np! Once we were all knew to torrenting.

When you allow other people to download a file from your computer, you become a seeder for that file. When you are downloading a file from another computer, you become a leecher.

The more seeders, the greater the number of computers that have that file available for download. The more leechers, the greater the number of people trying to download that file.

When your download is finished, you automatically become a seeder, and people can download that file from your computer. In most cases people can also downloads parts of the file when you are still leeching (downloading) yourself.

Hope that helps!"

,[SeriousDesert],2010-05-02T16:29Z,"epic, thanks very much. pretty good quality throughout."
,PorridgeMachine,2010-06-14T15:21Z,"For me, many of the episodes have glitches, usually missing bits of the video (e.g. episode 2x21, 3:00).

This happens every couple episodes, sometimes a few times in an episode.

Still, despite these annoyances, it's watchable and the overall quality is fine. I just don't recommend wrapping these files into any future torrent packages."
,johnnyboy787,2011-01-07T07:52Z,"Good, but it's a minority of the episodes that are in HD, not a majority."
,pne4life,2011-02-17T19:57Z,I dont have any sound for Season 4 Episodes 1-11. Any one else?
