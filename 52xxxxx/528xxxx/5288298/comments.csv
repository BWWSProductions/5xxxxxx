,megole,2010-01-20T04:32Z,Does it just seed automatically? Sorry im new to this stuff so im still trying to figure out how it works.
[T],hjsn1,2010-01-20T22:56Z,You click on download torrent and it will open your torrent program if you have one and ask you to select which files to download then hit ok and it should start downloading.

The other versions on here are the unrated director's cut with the alternate ending, this one HERE is the original ending seen in theaters.

Awesome and thanks for sharing this!!!!"
,megatrends,2010-01-25T20:24Z,PS the video and audio quality is excellent. Looks beautiful!
,LMS89,2012-01-01T01:54Z,"This is the only theatrical version I've been able to find, but there are no seeders. :( Can someone seed? Or tell me where I can find another theatrical version? 

Also, how do I play NTSC files? I don't have VLC player but I do have the Windows Media Classic HomeCinema player. Can I play it on that? "
