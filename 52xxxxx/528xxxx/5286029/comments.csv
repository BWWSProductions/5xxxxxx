[V],twentyforty,2010-01-17T12:30Z,"Out there are three DVD screeners. I downloaded yesterday, as I explained, 2.08 GB piece of crap from FLAWL3SS (LOL) and IMAGINE was deleted/removed from ""authorities"" as fast people posted copies. So, as I told yesterday, I re-encoded 2.08 GB crap twice - just to be sure that isn't me or my eyes... Funny tough, as I looked around, no one posted similar observation ... well... tonight I got one from MENTiON group and that one was the correct one. So , finally my re.encode is here and it saves at least 1 GB on traffic - thing that people needs, but do not think how is related to quality and how much of hard work I  put into (not to mention my money and my time)."

,lilars26,2010-01-17T15:53Z,Thanks for all you put into getting this for us.I would hope that most people appreciate your effort.Don't let one person who knows nothing about posting torrents (i.e.-portospawn)get to you.Thanks again 20/40.
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-17T16:10Z,"Thanks guys and galls. lilars, you probably have seen this, few days back, when I wrote this and now seems as worth to repost it, for people who now nothing about - not only about ""torrenting"" (how they call it):

""What goes around comes around. Give and you?ll be given.

I am a sort of refugee from ?minimalistic-was-a-star?. Many of my friends, my ?Regulars? came on TPB following my torrents. It takes a long time not just to make people to ?recognize? my small-sized stuff, but to adopt specific models of behaviour, when they interact, cooperate one with each other, exchange and, at the end, enjoy shows and movies. 

One thing I have always repeated: Solidarity. We, people from ?Developed countries? seem like have forgotten too easy what was only five-six years back when majority was on dial-up, wrestling with 2-4 kB/s. 

We also forget how hard is to live far away from all cultural, sociological ?cushions? our societies have provided for us, be surrounded with unbearable hardness of life, live surrounded by unimaginable poverty, diseases ? and a feeling of total disconnection from the rest of the ?shiny? world, where obviously, no one cares about anything else but themselves. We, who have ?more? must share with the ones who have less?. Must. Other ?types? of behaviour are not welcomed ? here. People who cannot share could go away, doors are open. Trespassers and punks will be escorted someplace else.

We are the rebels by nature, that?s why we are here on place called ?Pirate bay?? not to eat each other?s hearts out. We are here because world around is a dark place. People who come here are not the enemies, most of us struggle to survive, and taking just that and that much we need not to feel deprived by injustice. We are here to fight unrighteousness, but not amongst us. Never forget that."""
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-17T16:14Z,"Well, bunch of question-marks in place of "" ' "" and "" "" "". But, there is no questions...."
,lilars26,2010-01-17T17:00Z,I had to learn how to share.Now I don't feel so dirty.Thanks for the education.
,lilars26,2010-01-17T17:43Z,"...if I can learn,then I think there is hope that others can too.So keep on preaching 20/40,more people will eventually ""get it""."
,ZetaBeta,2010-01-17T18:12Z,"Just wanted to show my gratitude for the work you put into all the uploads you do. I will support your work as much as I can, but my max is 15-20 kb/s. I put in my 48hrs and am still supporting my request and a few other movies (I let uTorrent decide which gets the most bandwidth.) Keep up the good work Mate and we will tow the line."
,remy007in,2010-01-18T03:09Z,Thanks Man. Really needed this.
,littlebluebox,2010-01-18T07:38Z,Thanks a bunch for this!
,yiscool,2010-01-18T11:16Z,"u r the man 2040... u rock man.. keep up the gud work..

req: plz try tp post encoded episodes of how i met your mother and scrubs asap.. Thnkx alot"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-18T11:53Z,"Thanks.
@yiscool: HIMYM is always the first one up, since he airs as first.
Scrubs are on the ""shaky grounds"" but so far all episodes are up. What will determine their destiny is:
a) interest of the people, BUT not as have been so far, grab and go - as we say Hit&Run than at least few dozen of normal, decent people willing to share during the download and to stay as seeders as long they can/afford. Not a bunch of hard-fisting grabbers who put their upload speeds at 1-3 kB/s and expect from us to serve them for nothin'...
b)Saying Thanks afterward. Be nice cannot hurt, right? Costs nothing, but I know that I've done it for good people."
,vikynair,2010-01-18T13:57Z,great upload man thanks please can you upload daybreakers also its a request.keep up the good work thanx man
,yiscool,2010-01-18T14:50Z,"@2040
yeah i agree with ur two points, After watching ppl like u who work just for helping others, i have actually started seeding more than i dw now. and for b0 i will remember that..
Thankx for all ur work!!"
,madtown4,2010-01-19T08:57Z,"wow that was deep , and thats the way its supossed to be share what you are given so others will fallow the rule of sharing"
,kayslay,2010-01-19T09:58Z,"nice movie,loved it"
,blu-momo,2010-01-24T13:33Z,Thanks for the Great work. Nice print.
,t3rr0x,2010-02-03T14:27Z,"thanks a lot 20-40!
awesome work!!"
,ks85,2010-11-03T01:43Z,"Funny thing... (I've been checking out your huge torrents collection.... for an hour or so... damn i still got about 40 pages to go lol ) where did i read ""bla bla bla i'm gonna burn in hell for-whatever-it-was"" 
You are definitly The mother teresa of pirate bay ;)
I'm completly ignorant so... am i seeding whenever i leave my torrent on? (Trying to give a little ... after your moral lesson i just feel compelled).
You're a funny guy, stay well, best regards.
