Containing more than 175 interviews with lawyers, mental health experts, the families of victims and the survivors themselves, this riveting documentary rips the mask off psychotropic drugging and exposes a brutal but well-entrenched money-making machine.

It's the story of big money - drugs that fuel a $330 billion psychiatric industry, without a single cure.

These drugs now kill an estimated 42,000 people every year.
