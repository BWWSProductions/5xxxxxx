,FosterVS,2010-11-21T16:30Z,"WARNING!
This ""documentary"" is propaganda by THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY!
The ""Citizens Commission on Human Rights"" is a FRONT ORGANIZATION OF SCIENTOLOGY.
A quote from CCHR.ORG: ""CCHR was co-founded in 1969 by the Church of Scientology""
Why is the Church of Scientologu so down on psychiatrists? Because they believe they can cure any mental problems by joining their cult!
Please, research it yourself!"
,theinfm5,2010-12-22T19:05Z,@FosterV: It is sponsored by the nuts over at Scientology but that doesnt make the information less true. Best thing is to watch it and do your own research and come up to your own conclusions 
,bodierock,2011-09-15T17:19Z,This isnt scientology ! its a great documentary. the only people who think this is scientology are probably brainwashed yanks
