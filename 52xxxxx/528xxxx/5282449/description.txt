 a failed suicide attempt leaves a man named Roary (John Savage) partially crippled, he finds himself living in a run-down house in Oakland, California. He spends a lot of time at a neighborhood bar, which is full of other disabled people, and becomes best friends with Jerry (David Morse), the barman with a bad leg.

Jerry's luck turns round when a professional basketball player loans him the money for an operation to fix his leg. Once he is fully healed, Jerry goes on to become a basketball star, fulfilling his lifelong dream. However, he abandons his old friends by pretending they never existed.

Diana Scarwid's performance as Louise, Rory's girlfriend, earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. The movie also marked the return to the screen by disabled veteran Harold Russell, thirty-four years after his Oscar-winning role in The Best Years of Our Lives.
