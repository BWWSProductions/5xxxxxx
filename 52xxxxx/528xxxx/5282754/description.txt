From Wiki:


Wintersleep is a Juno Award-winning[1] Canadian indie rock band from Halifax, Nova Scotia.


Wintersleep formed in 2001[2] and released two albums with Dependent Music, a music label and artists' collective that began in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia in 1994.

In 2006, Wintersleep signed with Labwork Music, a partnership label of Sonic Unyon and EMI Music Canada, and re-released their first two studio albums to the U.S. and Canadian markets. The re-releases include bonus tracks and videos not featured in the originals. Their debut album was remixed and re-mastered by Laurence Currie for the re-release.

On October 2, 2007, Wintersleep released their third full-length album, Welcome to the Night Sky. They won the 2008 Juno Award for New Group of the Year.

The band's members frequently collaborate outside of Wintersleep. Murphy and D'eon played together in the band Kary, now on indefinite hiatus. Drummer Campbell has also performed with Kary, and is a member of a number of other projects, including Contrived, Holy Fuck, Hayden, The Holy Shroud, and The Remains of Brian Borcherdt. Bigelow plays bass in Contrived with Campbell and Jon Samuel, and also plays in Holy Fuck and The Holy Shroud. D'eon played guitar for Contrived before Samuel joined the group, appearing on Contrived's first record, Pursuit of Plots, and the second album, Dead Air Verbatim.

Along with Joel Plaskett, Wintersleep was selected as one of the opening acts for Paul McCartney's concert at Halifax Common on July 11, 2009.[3]

Wintersleep have also begun recording their fourth studio album, taking the month of September this year to write and record. As of yet no release date has been mentioned.
