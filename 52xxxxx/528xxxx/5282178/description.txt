Plot / Spoiler:

As Bill's casino is set to open and his church is inaugurated, the FBI raids Juniper Creek looking for Roman and to investigate a secret bank account in Nicki's name. Nicki helps her daughter enter society as her ex-husband J. J. comes to take her to Kansas. Lois and Frank attempt to reconcile amidst threats of abduction and death. While trying to help her mother with a power outage, Nicki discovers her father's dead body in a meat locker. Alby deposits the corpse at the site of the casino directly prior to its opening and calls in an anonymous tip to the FBI. Scheduled performer Kenny Rogers misses the opening ceremony as do Bill and Nickiâ€”who drive Roman's body out into the desert at the last minute.
