,iamneo33,2010-03-07T18:54Z,"How to tell a fake!!

1 - seeders are more than leachers

2 - A million comments about how great the quality is(screeners are not ever great)

3 - 10 other torrents come out at the exact same time, the exact same size, having the exact same comments

4 - screen shots that seem to be accepted and never disappear on public websites

5 -When these fake torrents are released, for some reason they have +1000 seeds instantly

Is this torrent fake? Tracked? Use these common sense clarifiers. The movie industry obviously does not use common sense...

Take care and Download safe...

Neo.... 

ps. please spread these comments if you can, cause knowledge is everything"
