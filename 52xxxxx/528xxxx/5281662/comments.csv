,bluraykid,2010-01-19T08:56Z,"how the hell did you rip a bluray to dvd dl and still get hd pic/sound?
everyone else have mkv formatt
never seen anyone do this...wow"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-19T09:24Z,"@bluraykid

it's my secret..shhhh

i know, majority of HD movies are mkv x264 then i realized that i wanted to do it differently (and unique it seems), all the while maintaining all 100% bluray HD.

on a side note, if you don't believe me try playing on a dvd player it isn't going to work.
It reads as a real BD :) only plays on bluray or PS3

Take care."

i cant wait till mines all done i really appreciate this dude ive seen a few hd movies on tpb and the quality is ok iguess, but i can tell u put alot of work on this movie 4sure
do u have any more like this?"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-20T00:13Z,"@bluraykid

you can definately say that again ...even with my powerful computer it took awhile to rip full, then another 1.5 hrs to re-encode and make file ready for my good ol Pirates here:)

upping more? depends on the feedback, and tpb interest in the way i do it.
Bye."
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-21T04:58Z,"attention downloaders if you see no seeding from me for 5 mins (backup emerg reboot) dont be alarmed im here.
it seems my area is currently experiencing a blackout, but have no fear my backup power generator will not disrupt seeding this wonderful movie:) brb   "
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-21T22:10Z,"at one point there was 60 seeders, and not one comment for my hard work/seeding ...ohh well."

[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-23T03:32Z,"@bluraykid
anytime bro...enjoy:)"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-31T04:51Z,"yes, you can play this without burning it.
Personally, i use Nero 9 for AVCHD playback
(plug-in required- see Nero)
Other programs also plays this, search Google

I'll be away for a few days...enjoy:)"
,hopeman007,2010-02-01T19:52Z,"Hi, works fine but there seems to be no sound, can you help me or let me know what Iam doing wrong.

Fantastic picture quality, thanks for the upload, one 
of my favourite movies. 
"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-02-02T23:28Z,"@hopeman007  no sound ehh u didnt tell me wat ur playin this off comp, PS3, BD player? pic quality is awesome i know i did it hehe"
,hopeman007,2010-02-03T19:05Z," Hi, grimreaper420

PS3, streaming to PS3 & tried playing on my PC
had picture but no sound.

Thanks for reply. "
[T],grimreaper420,2010-02-03T19:32Z,"@hopeman007 i dont know exactly what ur setup is like but im gonna post here a few ideas...
PS3 has an optical output to AV receiver (configure input setup) 2 output speakers.
PS3 also has stereo connection output to AV receiver or TV input.
from PC either comp speaker output or optical output to AV receiver (configure input).
yeah it can get a lil complex as i don't know  your connecting this.
sometimes, it's just a wrong wire input, or not configured properly....you'd be surprised how many ppl do it incorrectly.
good luck:)"
,hopeman007,2010-02-04T01:50Z,"Hey grimreaper420 

Thanks, turned the True HD Audio into AC3 audio,
kept video the same & now plays great, has something to do with the True HD Audio, at least I can watch this movie now, thanks for the movie,& even more for your help most appreciated.

Good 1,
Hopeman007     "
[T],grimreaper420,2010-02-28T11:57Z,"whatever you played it from didn't decode DDTrueHD audio, that's why you heard no sound.

sorry for late response"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-03-12T03:20Z,"@VuKu_the_GreaT thank u for the compliments:) 
you can watch this from any computer, even if you don't have a blu-ray player, but you definitely need the plug-ins/codecs to decode HD pic/sound, and the MIN hardware requirements, as this is very data intensive.
I use Nero 9, which I also uploaded, plays this flawlessly (using a Quad/Core i7/AMD Phenom)
I don't have a website, but I do belong to the forums, you can find me there.
Take care:)"
