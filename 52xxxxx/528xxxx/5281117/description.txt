SWITCH BITCH 
Roald Dahl
Read by Christian Rodska

With deft skill and great wit four of Roald Dahl's best adult short stories  "The Visitor," "The Great Switcheroo," "The Last Act" and ""Bitch"  reveal the humor, melancholy and terror inherent in marital meddling and the lust and entanglements that ensue when men chase women. Christian Rodska's sophisticated but naughty reading is the perfect complement to these droll and bizarre short stories, transforming the words into stunning visual portraits. Rodska's verbal pacing and renditions of gender, age, regional and international accents are simply delicious.
