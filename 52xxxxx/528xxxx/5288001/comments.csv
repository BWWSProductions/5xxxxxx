,versesopm,2010-02-17T18:57Z,"***DO NOT DL THIS FILE***
This file, although good, is being tracked.  I received an email from my ISP saying that the copyright owner of this movie tracked my IP, timestamped when I DLed it, and that if I DL illegally again, they will press charges. 

Sorry all, find another one!"

,Wheelman5000,2010-05-15T07:36Z,"I Dl'd this for my HD2 and and the a/v are both 10's.  Fits my screen perfectly and the volume is nice and loud.  Thanks HolyRoses! 

BTW, I used wmTorrent and downloaded it directly to my phone.  Dl through 3g is not fast but its kind of cool if only just because I can.
