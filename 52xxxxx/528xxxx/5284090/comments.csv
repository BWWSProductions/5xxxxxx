,reesy,2010-01-20T01:17Z,"This file is a fake.

It is just a 17 second Universal intro with screen captions saying ""Codec Error: Use Windows Media Player"" and ""Aborting Video, Redirecting to Microsoft Codec Download Page"". Which is total crap.

I would advise you don't waste your 1gig download just to find this out: just take my word for it.

The original seeder is no longer around so you'll never even reach 100%."
