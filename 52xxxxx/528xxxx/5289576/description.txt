Bio: 

     Phantogram is an American electronic rock duo from Greenwich, New York, consisting of guitarist Josh Carter and keyboardist Sarah Barthel.

     Barthel and Carter were friends since junior high school, but Phantogram didn't officially form until 2007. That summer, Barthel returned home dissatisfied with pursuing a visual arts degree and Carter returned home after a brief stint in New York City with Grand Habit, an experimental band formed with his older brother, John.[1] The two friends reunited and then worked on finishing some beat ideas Carter made earlier. They then finally formed the band.

     The duo was originally called Charlie Everywhere when performing around the Saratoga Springs area on the local label Sub-Bombin Records. The band was soon dubbed the label's, "first big success" by the Albany Times Union after their energetic live performances and recorded tracks had the band searching for a larger record label to release their first EP [2].

     The band signed with the BBE record label on January 26, 2009 [3]. Upon signing with BBE, the band changed their name to Phantogram to avoid any potential trademark issues [4]. Their self-titled debut EP was released on May 12, 2009[5].

     Phantogram's unique dance-friendly sound has helped them play as opening acts for more established bands such as Zero 7, Ra Ra Riot, Yeasayer, Brazilian Girls and The Slip. They've also performed at the SXSW festival in 2009 and are scheduled to play at Camp Bisco in July 2009. Barthel has said of their sound, "We wanted to incorporate all our own influences and created our own sound that's a combination of Serge Gainsbourg, sampling and Detroit hip-hop. [6] In interviews, the band has described their sound concisely under the genre of "street beat, psych pop." [7] The genre comes from a blog post written by fellow Saratoga Spring musician Matthew Loiacano, who described Phantogram's sound as "street beat, psych pop" after seeing them perform with Yeasayer at Skidmore College [8].

     On October 13, 2009, Phantogram announced via their Twitter account that they had signed with Barsuk Records. Barsuk has been home to bands such as Death Cab for Cutie, Rilo Kiley and Mates of State [9].

     A most pleasing blend of programmed beats, somnolent synthesizers and intelligent pop from this NY duo, tapping into a sound that's alluringly situated somewhere between Beach House and Nite Jewel. "Phantogram sounds like a band from the city. Electronic loops, hip-hop beats, shoegaze, soul, pop - each finds its way into their songs. Unexpectedly, the band doesn't hail from a metropolis, but rather calls the town of Saratoga Springs, NY (population 26,186) home.

    Most people there, other than maybe some students at local Skidmore College (where fellow beat-experimenters Ratatat formed), have never heard of J. Dilla, My Bloody Valentine, or Serge Gainsbourg. But Josh Carter and Sarah Barthel, the duo that make up Phantogram and who grew up in the even smaller nearby municipality of Greenwich, have flourished in Saratoga. In fact, the town itself isn't rural enough for their taste - they drive almost every day another 45 minutes into upstate farmland to a barn they call Harmony Lodge to write and record. Serving as their homemade studio/practice space/think-tank/bat-cave, the barn is equipped with various samplers, tapes, records, synths, drums, and both percussive and stringed instruments, and it's there that Phantogram allows their natural surroundings and urban influences to meld together creating some beautiful, beat-driven dreamlike pop songs."
