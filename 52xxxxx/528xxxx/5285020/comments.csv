,WonderSlug,2010-02-01T07:38Z,Are these the Director's Cut / Unrated Versions or the regular Theatrical versions?
[V],bob5695,2010-02-01T12:19Z,"^^ that's a good question. ^^
i believe they might be the unrated versions but please don't crucify me if it turns out that i'm wrong."
,lovethemovies19,2010-02-10T22:02Z,"I am pretty sure these are All unrated, u can't really watch the saw movies RATED. That would be really retarded, it's HORROR DUH. It's meant to be unrated, y make a HORROR movie and make it rated wtf???? it's the whole point of horror Unrated DUH"
[V],bob5695,2010-02-10T23:17Z,^^ how nervous... ^^
,RobCine,2010-02-22T18:47Z,"It takes forever to download, any idea how to make it faster?"
,HSD.Crow,2010-02-23T00:18Z,Hey need more seeds! Slow download. Hop I can actually finish this one before everyone stops seeding... -_-' Which seems to happen a lottt...
[V],bob5695,2010-03-07T13:30Z,;)
,joethehoe,2010-03-21T14:26Z,how do you keep seeding it when you change the file name/location with out keeping a copy of the original name/location?

,joethehoe,2010-03-31T22:07Z,"This is a great torrent but one minor complaint, in a few of the movies there is an extra scene at the end of the credits and most of those are cut off by a few seconds."
[V],bob5695,2010-04-01T14:58Z,"nope, there is only an extra scene in ONE of the movies (saw vi) and that scene is complete from the very first milisecond to the very last milisecond."
,xosuitehearts,2010-04-24T21:27Z,Great job on this torrent.  Although I'm having some weird experiences with the audio.  I goes really low on some parts and really high on others.  Probably just my PS3.  Good Job though :)
[V],bob5695,2010-04-25T00:38Z,;)
,Arch4ng3l,2010-04-30T14:22Z,Whats difference between rated and unrated?
[V],bob5695,2010-04-30T19:39Z,pretty much the same difference as between censored and uncensored...
,feliks000,2010-05-01T10:24Z,Thank you for uploading this :) .. the best thing is that i can download 4 movies and not download the others :) (non zip file) .. but i will download all of them.. and i will SEED! :)
[V],bob5695,2010-05-01T17:39Z,:)
[V],bob5695,2010-05-21T00:34Z,"no worries, enjoy."
,HabereHabere,2010-05-27T20:09Z,"Thank you for this awesome upload! 
I only have 1 question, I'm from Holland, and I would like to have some subs in the movies, where can I download them?
I tried it a couple of times, but in the beginning of the movies the text is too early, and in the end it is too late.
Which keywords do I have to use?
I mean like ""unrated"" or something

Thanks again and in advance!

-=I think that I don't have many mistakes in this comment, but don't stone me if there are ;) =-"
[V],bob5695,2010-05-28T00:26Z,"use subtitleworkshop to sync your subs - this software is free and does not require installation - all you have to do is press ctrl+b and insert the timings for the first and last line.

alternatively, post the links to the out-of-sync subtitles here and i'll fix them for you."

Can you please try for me?
You don't have to hurry or something :P
Thanks! ;)"
