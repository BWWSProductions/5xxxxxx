The best of the BBC Wallander series - excellent 90 minute episode - I would certainly watch this episode again and I've seen all the swedish versions (twice!) - and read many of Henning Mankell's books.  This episode shows Kenneth Branagh at his best - (as well as others).  Super acting!

PLEASE REMEMBER TO SEED...sharing is what it's all about!
