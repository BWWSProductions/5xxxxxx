This exciting performance by Tina Turner was recorded right before her return to mega stardom. Her voice is at it's prime. The singing, dancing, and "teasing" thats done on "Proud Mary" show's one of the many reasons why we love Tina. Pure, Raw, Rough, Wild and really SEXY!! A must for all Tina fans.
