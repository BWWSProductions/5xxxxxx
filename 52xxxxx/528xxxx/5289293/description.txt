If You Want Blood You've Got It is the first live album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, originally released in the U.S.A. on 21 November 1978. All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott. The album was recorded live during the 1978 Powerage Tour and contains live versions of songs from AC/DC's T.N.T., Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Let There Be Rock, and Powerage albums. It is
the last Bon Scott-era AC/DC album produced by Harry Vanda and George Young, who also produced the band's first five studio releases.

The album was re-released in 1994 on Atco Records and in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters
series. AC/DC's concert at the Apollo Theatre in Glasgow on 30 April 1978, Scotland, was used for the
bulk of the recorded material that appeared on the album. It can be clearly heard during "The Jack" when Bon Scott sang "Any virgins in Glasgow?". This concert will also be remembered for the encore when AC/DC came back on stage dressed in the Scottish Football strip.[1] The songs "Dog Eat Dog" and "Fling Thing" were also performed during the night of the concert but eventually removed from the album. The live rendition of "Dog Eat Dog" was released as the b-side of the single "Whole Lotta Rosie/Dog Eat Dog" in November 1978. The song was also released on the 2007 DVD Plug Me In. A song with the same title, "If You Want Blood (You've Got It)," appeared on AC/DC's next album, Highway to Hell. The version of "Rocker" on the album is slightly edited.
