if you click install and it doesent work, go into the ""install"" folder and get the 390 mb ra2.exe
that is all you need, the other stuff is only needed for the cd-autorun"

..but not so much in fact. there're some troubles here- maybe you can say what is a deal?. 
there are no alliance's power turbine and backwarp, no epsilon's academy and chaos spear and injection, no gates for soviet and epsilone. in addition there is an additional infantry- epsilon's nightmare, there there is no information about at all at the mod site..!"
