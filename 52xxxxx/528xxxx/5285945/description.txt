Notes:
-if you get *** FATAL STRING ERROR *** just try again. it does this sometimes at first run
-if you get "encountered an error and needs to close" try to set win98 compatibility on all game exe's
-if you get black screen try to delete ddraw.dll from your game folder
-the resolution should be set identical to your desktop when you install
but if you have to do it manually look for these 3 lines
in ra2.ini (for red alert 2) or ra2md.ini (for mental omega)
and change the values to what you want
