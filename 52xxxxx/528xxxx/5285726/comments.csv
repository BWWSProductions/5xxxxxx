Video gets a solid 10, with terrific detail and colors.

Audio is also a solid 10, with good surround activity and bass response when played through a surround sound system. 

Until we get a U.S. Blu-Ray release, this is the next best thing, and will certainly please anyone looking for a quality rip."
