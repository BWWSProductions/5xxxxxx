I have 40 episodes of these Top Of The Pops that were aired on the french channel ARTE. These are all direct from the TV (all TV-RIPS)and are all approx 30 minutes long.

I first started to put these up on THEBOX torrent site, but they banned them all because of their rules of it not being 100% British, ... Even though TOTP is!!

Anyway, ... These are all going to be for you lot now ;-)
