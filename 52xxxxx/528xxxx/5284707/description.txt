These are 8 of the first 9 games released by Apple for the iPod.

There is no way to play any of these games without first buying them from the iTunes Music Store. I'm just putting them out there for anyone who wants to try to crack Apple's DRM.

If you do crack these games, please post instructions at http://macserialjunkie.com/ .

The game not included is "Cubis 2 1.0.ipg", I couldn't find it.
