Product Description:
MacCleanse is a small yet powerful application geared 
towards purifying your system. In only seconds, it can 
perform over fifty tasks which would take nearly an hour 
to perform manually. Safely erasing caches, logs, cookies, 
histories, and more... MacCleanse won't miss a thing and 
could reclaim hundreds of megabytes of storage space.

Going above and beyond the call of duty, MacCleanse 
provides detailed information on each item it cleanses, 
and can even securely wipe files if desired. It is definitely 
an ideal solution when shopping for gifts, cleansing the 
system after someone else has used it, or when 
preparing to sell your computer. Ensure your personal 
information is out of reach.

MacCleanse also contains enhanced features for specific 
applications like Acquisition, Adium, AIM, aMSN, 
Azureus, Bit Torrent, Colloquy, FireFox 2 & 3, iCab, 
iChat, ICQ, Internet Explorer, Mozilla, MPlayer, MSN 
Messenger, Netscape, OmniWeb, Opera, Preview, 
QuickTime, Safari, Skype, Transmission, Unison, Xtorrent, 
and Yahoo Messenger. These enhanced features allow 
you to pick and choose what exactly to remove from the 
application - be it only auto-fill values from Safari or the 
recent download history in Xtorrent.
