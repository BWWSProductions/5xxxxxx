[V],twentyforty,2010-01-16T12:20Z,"@zmacdaddy8: There are ""slight"" problems with Jeopardy: I MUST have 720p captures of TV shows regularly, to even think about entering them in my weekly schedule. Many, many popular shows (especially It's always sunny...) have been dropped 'cause of that.
2nd: I do not do reality, quiz and such shows. Besides, shows must not just to enter - they must earn to stay in my schedule.
3rd: I am too slow (connection-wise, LOL) to expand the schedule. Even now, I hardly keep the pace - mainly staying awake 22 hours every day and it cannot last forever.
4th: ""eztv"" is just a group of uploaders - and others too...
I encode (produce) ALL files AND upload them...
Go figure.

However, IF I have something as ""free"" spot, I'll squeeze in some new movie or something people looking for and cannot find. I simply cannot ""expand"" in manner you need. For you to see that I am not a jerk, I will up last nights episode of Jeopardy, also because I know that plain XviD (from 2WIRE) doesn't make good input. It is file-size-wise small show and I am sure that you and your comrades can find some stable, alternative source."
