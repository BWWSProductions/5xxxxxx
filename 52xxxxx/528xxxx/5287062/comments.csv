No, we don't want less quality...we want good quality which means larger files

Welcome to the HD World..."
,Fuckinoob,2010-01-18T23:32Z,This IS a comedy so no reason for a 1.5 DTS track. 720p and 640 ac3 is just fine. Thanks for the upload. Been waiting to see this one.
,justin131,2010-01-19T18:50Z,"I prefer it when comedies are dvd5 because, really, I'm not going to laugh harder with 1 or 2 more mbps video quality. I'd rather see 10gb 720p action films and 4gb comedies. That'd be ideal."
,SpencerMc,2010-02-27T11:02Z,What program do you guys use to watch these types of files?
