A smooth-talking jack-of-all-trades attempts to save a struggling car dealership from certain bankruptcy in this comedy starring Jeremy
 Piven, directed by Chappelle's Show creator Neal Brennan, and produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay's Gary Sanchez Productions. 
Don Ready (Piven) takes sales seriously; he's always up for a challenge, and he parties as hard as he works. 
Approached to help an ailing car dealership from falling into the red, Ready recruits a crew of his best men and descends 
upon the quiet town of Temecula determined to succeed. Before long the dealership is flourishing and Ready's crew are kings 
of the roost, but what happens when the man who made his mint by hustling cars meets the one woman who isn't charmed by his formidable 
skills as a salesman. Realizing this may be his one shot at true love, Ready starts working overtime to convince the woman of his dreams 
that he's the best bargain on the lot. Has the hustler finally found his soul, or is he so locked into his anything-goes lifestyle that 
there's no looking back? Ving Rhames, Ed Helms, James Brolin, and David Koechner co-star.
