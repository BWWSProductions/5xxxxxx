Description of game:
Fast Draw Showdown is a game set in the distant pastÃ¯Â¿Â¢Ã¯Â¾Â€Ã¯Â¾Â¦the year 1994, to be precise. In those days, arcades were lit up with light gun games; even as other genres drifted into console-only territory, there was still a ready supply of them. But where most of these games were frantic on-rails, shoot-everything-that-moves twitch-fests, Fast Draw Showdown was stationary and tasked players with waiting to fire until the time was right. But does this thinking manÃ¯Â¿Â¢Ã¯Â¾Â€Ã¯Â¾Â™s shooter  #   require any actual thought?
