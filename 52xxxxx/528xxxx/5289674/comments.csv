,giolgaudaniel,2010-10-02T15:11Z,Is this the updated edition (+ 2009 magazines)?
,fairy20121,2012-05-14T02:05Z,"Thank you for the upload. This is the only one that works for me. Works for both Windows and Mac operating systems. It's an iso image. 

The issues go up to 2008. Nat Geo sells the updates for 2009-2011 as an update for 10 bucks a pop. 

For disc 2-6, go ahead and download the entire collection from PB, but please note that disc one on that torrent didn't work for me. Perhaps it's corrupted. 

someone please seed the newest ones!"
