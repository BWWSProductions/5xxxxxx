Nice copy clear one..
Thanks!"
,sleigoure,2010-01-16T14:55Z,"Lol you look so pathetic angeal

Try downloading it first before saying anything..
I'm on it and that made me laugh at your lame comments..

Why can't you accept that you were wrong.
It's okey dude..

Nway thanks.. nice video copy"
,flyout,2010-01-16T22:46Z,Sorry folks - it is in dead a fake. This stupid 'codex error... blabla' apears. Had this with other torrents. So ignore all comments about not being a fake. 
,flyout,2010-01-16T22:51Z,forgot to mention - actually not surprising as this movie just came out and a dvdrip would be extremly surprising. Tried it from another site too - with FXG... was fake just the same. So we all have to wait
,nickborg,2010-01-17T03:10Z,"Fake. Directs you to another site for a survey. Usual bull... 
Still too soon for the real movie. 

Can anyone explain why someone wastes their time uploading this? It achieves absolutely nothing except frustration!!! Or is that the point...if so, well done to the uploader...loser!"
,hearaldor,2010-01-17T07:45Z,"Sorry guys I should say thanks for this..


I just checked it myself and had no problem with it.
I think you shud see it yourself before saying anything.

Even lovely bones and Sherlock holmes got Dvdscr copies out now 

So shouldn't wonder coz that's the reality right now..
Piracy is all around."
,abammy,2010-01-17T10:06Z,YOU WERE RIGHT.I COULD NOT SEE IT.
,flyout,2010-01-17T11:09Z,"@hearaldor - nice try
If you're so smart as to be able to have watched it, tell us how you've done that... which media player? I am acctualy down loading sherlock holmes but I guess, this will be another fake. 
I had down loaded this one here and can confirm that it is FAKE."
,judomasters,2010-01-17T14:03Z,"Wow pretty good copy
I'm done downloading. 
Thanks been up for this.

Thought it's Julia Roberts at first 
She looks like Julia.

Nothing Hill was one of my favorites.
Thanks Again reidly!"
,Tallyortoby,2010-01-17T17:45Z,You guys thanks 1337x.org in the message BUT when you go to the site and type in the movie title it doesn't appear SO THIS IS A FAKE no matter how many people say they can watch it and stuff. NOIR will always have all his releases on his site.
,ian420,2010-01-23T23:39Z,"I'm so sick and tired of people bitching about movies they can download for free... I just wanna say ""FUCK YOU & YOUR MOTHERFUCKING MAMA!!!""... You people are either an idoit or you're just full of sh!t..."
,thadream101,2010-01-24T10:40Z,hey tallyortoby just cause it says 1337x doesn't mean its a NOIR release you know other people use that site?...i will download and let you know

,ironup,2010-02-04T22:23Z,"Fake indeed, checked out few other ""similar"" this if fully fake and not adwised to download. I recommend to all new/old user to download newest movies from reliable sources who have TPB Vip,helper,trusted or other titles before their name.

Multiply accounts made comments are easy to spot and easy to counter something what seems too good aint real. Trust the trusted.
