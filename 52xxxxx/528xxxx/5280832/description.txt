This is a full Discography of GOLDFRAPP containing all her 5
Albums produced in her entire career 2000 to 2008.

From the year 2008 there do exist several live CDs of which
I have added the on from Birmingham in June 2008...

I have coded all the track in best possible quality with the
best of the MP3 Coders called 'lame Version 3.98' with VBR
(Variable Bit Rate) and the highest quality setting VBR0
and 'stereo'. Please do not code with the setting 'joint
stereo', this will considerably reduce sound quality, all
the instruments and singers will appear fuzzier in the
stereo sound stage...

Anyway, in terms of sound quality, the MP3.256k.HighEnd VBR
used by me is the same as MP3 at fixed 320k 

Bit for Byte you will not get any better sound files than this.
If you hear any quality loss on a Sound System costing less
than $10.000 please write me a note onto this torrent

:-)

I am a sound addictive (High Fidelity & High End) for years
now... However, enjoy the music !!!

SeeYa,
