,sonews,2010-01-16T00:13Z,It truly is hilarious reading the comments of you Limbaugh lovers out there trying to defend this hate machine because your panties are in a not from his comments as of late...
,sonews,2010-01-16T00:15Z,I better spell ( knot ) correctly or there will be 10 replies saying I hate American because I used the wrong grammar.
,thunderbum,2010-01-16T00:37Z,"Mm. Another sockpuppet! 

Rush isn't the only one who loves to tweak. He tweaks the media, we tweak trolls! SO much fun!

Hint for the left libs here - Rush is not a 'hater', he wants the best for all American and sees us all as God's children. Has said so many times on his show. 

If you actually listened to him with your ears and minds open, you'd hear this for yourself. But that's what you get when you allow the msm to think for you.

It's only the left who insist on him being a 'hater' because it makes them feel good (temporarily) about themselves - but liberalism is a mental disorder and if they had any brains between them, they'd be Republican/Conservatives."
,DeSeguio,2010-01-16T00:48Z,He should be shot.  What a waste of time listening to his biased bullshit.  The rich don't need any more money.  They can go fuck themselves.  WAH WAH WAH
[T],Quazza,2010-01-16T01:08Z,They would be conservative...screw republicans...until they start being conservative they are no better than liberals in my book.
,booboo332,2010-01-16T01:34Z,"Don't cry, DeSegulo, if your wealth envy is bothering you so much, I offer you a suggestion made by Neal Boortz.  ""Quit your job (assuming you have one) and go get one from a poor person?  Let us know how that works out for you.""

You don't have to be a conservative or a Republican to enjoy Rush's show.  He is friends with Camille Paglia, while often reviled by some liberals, is certainly no conservative.  Myself, I have more politically and philosophically in common with Penn Jillette and while I disagree with Rush on a number of things, I always find Rush a highly entertaining and challenging commentator.  He is a champion of free speech and he stirs up political discourse better than anyone.

Instead of sucking down the flavor-aid of any party, try thinking for yourself rather than defaulting to your hateful groupthink.  Just give it a try if you aren't too attached to your bigotry."
,DeSeguio,2010-01-16T01:38Z,"Fuck all Republicans.  The world hates the U.S because of all the corrupt Repulicans because greed is their motive for everything.  Deal with the truth.  Join the rest of the planet.  And yes I have a job.  Do you, or has your rich daddy spoon fed you everything."
,booboo332,2010-01-16T01:46Z,"Bigotry it is then.  If you thing the Dems are any less corrupt, you are the one who is out of touch.

Good doggie, have a biscuit.  Your masters are proud of you."

sonews - Are you TrickDummy's daddy?

Yesterday, he got upset, and said he was going to quit posting.

He is such a whiner... and a troll. It would be just like him to go whining to his parents about us.

And whoa - check out that DeSeguio. De Psycho. He just comes in here with guns blazing. Dude, he's going postal online!

Too bad Bahama wants to take your guns away from you, but I guess it's true when guns are illegal only criminals have guns.

How's that wifi workin' at the penitentiary, DeSeguio? How's the shoe bomber doing, by the way?

,thunderbum,2010-01-16T03:03Z,"@ booboo - if ya want to have a good laugh, go find a koran online and read what their 'paradise' is: then reverse the psychology and look at what muslim men are now and why they think paradise is something to look forward to:

Among other things they'll be able to screw endless boys - they're all around you to pick up like precious pearls.

You have endless females and concubines (which for them paradise must be the true definition of hell)

They'll have plenty of water, fruits, and lard-marinated camel meat

And one of the best: they'll have big long dicks - and be able to last hours. That means right now they've got tiny dicks and they can only last something like 2.4 seconds before ejaculating! LOLOL!!!"

Yo DeSeguio - can you put down the gun so I can ask you a question?

Yeah, right there is fine. *gasp*

Are you so mad because you don't have a job?

,booboo332,2010-01-16T03:44Z,"@thunderbum - I know what you mean.  I have read some of the Qur'an and have studied world religions for about 20 years.  Of course, Muslims will tell us that if we don't read it in Arabic we aren't reading the ""real"" Qur'an but that only goes so far.

With all due respect to peaceful muslims, who I wish no harm and only freedom from their clerical ruling class, one really has to wonder about a religion founded by a man who is said by some sources to have sexually consummated his marriage with his wife Aisha when she was 9 and had a poet who mocked him assassinated.  By contrast, the Buddha's was a dead beat dad that left his wife and son in the care of his royal family and the most troubling thing for some people (theology aside) that Jesus did to another living thing was that he killed a tree and neither promoted violence towards another.

""Islam"" doesn't mean ""peace"" as it is often claimed, it is more accurately translated as submission.  I don't think this is necessarily as ominous as it seems, however.  One could say that the Amish submit to what they see as god's will and law, too, but it is clear that cultural barbarism and clerical rule that has a stranglehold on Islam is based on a lot more than a mere submission to the divine."
,booboo332,2010-01-16T03:54Z,"I almost forgot about the story with the demons that Jesus is said to have driven out of some people and then possessed some pigs that drowned themselves in response.  While this story doesn't really make much sense to a godless heathen like me, one has to admit that the fact that the way many anti-theists bring this story up as a some sort of proof that Jesus' lack of compassion is right in line with those liberal nutjobs that put plants and animals above people.  I guess they would have preferred that the possessed people should have stayed tormented rather than the ""sacred swine""."

Funny you should say that.  Let's see.

Conservatives were against breaking from England to four our own land.  They were wrong there.

Conservatives were against ending slavery.  whoops,  they were wrong again.

Conservatives are what is wrong with the republican party.  Ditch them in both parties and then the USA would be back on the right track..."
,booboo332,2010-01-16T14:54Z,"The fact sonews doesn't know the difference between a conservative and a Tory from the 1700's is a clear sign that he/she isn't playing with a full deck.

C'mon lunatron, dazzle us with some more of your delusions.  It is very entertaining."

sonews - is that short for socialist news?

And don't worry I won't say you hate America because you are challenged by the English language, but I will question if you are American at all.

Obviously, you learn well from your democrat friends to write your own history the way they write their own constitution.

Democrats hate the founding documents, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, because they limit the government. They don't say what the government can do to you.

Using your logic, the founders were against what they wrote. They were against the war they fought that freed this nation from the tyranny of a king. You bonehead.

But you have a king for us, don't you sonews. You have racism, slavery, inequality, bigotry, class warfare, and every broken and failed economic system the world has ever known. You are Hitler. You are Stalin. You are Lenin. You are Mao. You are the same game under a different name.

Socialism is slavery. Steal from the people for the sake of power. Spare the oil and the wine. Let them eat cake!

Yeah, I know what you are even if you don't.
