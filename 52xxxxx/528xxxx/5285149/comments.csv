I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

*** FYI there is a asshole/coward who is leaving a bunch of negative [-] ratings on my torrents, so rate this one and leave comments on the way you see it [I'm sure Allman Brother fans will love it] *** "
,smithjohn57,2010-01-17T03:20Z,Thank You for Rigor Mortis Sets In but i am stuck at 71.6%. Can You please seed a little bit?
[V],smbdownload,2010-01-17T04:14Z,sorry john I haven't seeded that since about 24 hrs since I upload - I will seed myself until about 50 people get it - then it's up to everyone else to keep em going - you cannot continue to seed everything - I've started over 400+ torrents - sorry dude - I do check the status of my torrents weekly - and that one was being seeded at least though last week by at least 1 - try to stay on for a little while longer as I don't make a habit of re-seeding old torrents [but I would if you reallllllly wanted it :-)
