This tour has felt like a revival, so "Revival" was an appropriate opener.  Once again "Rockin' Horse" is a highlight, as this song seems to grow stronger each time it is played lately.  "You Don't Love Me" is some down and dirty blues, with Gregg belting out the vocal as only he can.

Since this was the last ABB/Panic show, this was one more opportunity to play some of the songs that the Panic guys guested on throughout the tour.  "Gilded Splinters" is one song that both bands play, so it was an obvious choice for collaboration, and yielded many great versions on this tour, but none hotter than this one!  Likewise, Jimmy Herring's history with The Dead made "Franklin's Tower" a logical choice, and he tears up the Grateful Dead classic at this show with his inimitable guitar style.

Widespread Panic bassist Dave Schools adds bass to a thunderous "Dreams" that swoops and soars over the audience on wings of pure joy.  Jimmy returns to the stage for another song that was a frequent jamming vehicle on this tour, "In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed."  Jimmy's jazzy style fits this song so well, and this version is a knockout!

How to end such an epic tour?  With all 13 members of both bands on stage jamming to "Southbound," of course!  This is the logical extension of all the interplay between the bands on this tour, and caps off a great night and a great tour with plenty of fireworks.
