Con la preghiera di farlo circolare il piÃ¹ possibile 


This is a reportage about the reactions of the Rome ERs to the request for what in Italian we call "the day after pill". 

The pill acts before fecondation, so there's no genetic code of a new person, so it's not an abortion. It is NOT the RU486 !

Still many medical and paramedical personnel claims some religious believes in order to not perform the treatment.

In a case, they told the guys the treatment could have been done effectively two days later, with a "no problem" reassurance, while it's known that the timing IS an issue.

In some other European countries it's an off the counter product, no need for medical prescription.
