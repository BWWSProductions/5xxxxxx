A group of scientists, led by the brilliant yet eccentric Twinkie-addicted Sebastian Caine, are successfully researching invisibility.

Unfortunately, the serum effects not only the external physical nature of the subject, but morphs the internal personality too. And that's when things start to go horribly wrong...
