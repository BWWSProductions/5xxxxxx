The original post looks the same but you can click on the author and see his/her other posts. The original is made up of 62 files which match the 62 listed files, like most comic posts.

The original post is at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5280316/Superman_-_New_Krypton._%20Beginning_to_1_13_10%20#0992383027349983430"
