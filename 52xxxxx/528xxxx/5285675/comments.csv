I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

*** FYI there is a asshole/coward who is leaving a bunch of negative [-] ratings on my torrents, so rate this one and leave comments on the way you see it [I'm sure Robin Trower fans will love it] ***"

,smithjohn57,2010-01-17T10:33Z,"About Rigor Mortis again.
Thanks for Your reply, I understand Your point. It is just that Rigor Mortis is something my friend had on vinyl, and i used to have it recorded on a mono C-casette ages a go. I Got I think all Your other Entwistle torrents, but this one is the most important to me. It brings back old memories. I realllllllly would like to complete it.  So if You could help, please."
