excerpts from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Feelies
Their name is based on Aldous Huxley's novel "Brave New World" where in the novel their are theaters where all of your senses are incorporated along with sight, called "the feelies."
The Feelies released their first single ï¿½Fa Ce Laï¿½ on Rough Trade Records in 1980. The album that followed on Stiff Records, Crazy Rhythms, was #49 in Rolling Stone's top 100 albums of the 1980s, and #69 on Pitchfork Media's similar list.


Crazy Rhythms review from AMG:
Even the cover is a winner, with a washed-out look that screams new wave via horn-rimmed glasses, even more so than contemporaneous pictures of either Elvis Costello or the Embarrassment. But if it was all look and no brain, Crazy Rhythms would long ago have been dismissed as an early-'80s relic. That's exactly what this album is not, right from the soft, haunting hints of percussion that preface the suddenly energetic jump of the appropriately titled "The Boy With the Perpetual Nervousness." From there the band delivers seven more originals plus a striking cover of the Beatles' "Everybody's Got Something to Hide" that rips along even more quickly than the original. The guitar team of Glenn Mercer and Bill Million smokes throughout, whether it's soft, rhythmic chiming with a mysterious, distanced air or blasting, angular solos. But Anton Fier is the band's secret weapon, able to play straight-up beats but aiming at a rumbling, strange punch that updates Velvet Underground/Krautrock trance into giddier realms. Mercer's obvious Lou Reed vocal inflections make the VU roots even clearer, but even at this stage of the game there's something fresh about the work the quartet does, even 20 years on -- a good blend of past and present, rave-up and reflection. When the group's later label, A&M, finally got around to reissuing the album for the first time stateside, a curious bonus was included: a version of the Rolling Stones' "Paint It, Black," recorded by the later lineup of the band in 1990. Mercer's voice is noticeably different from his decade-old self, but it's an enthusiastic rendition not too far out of place.

when this came out 80/81 some time like that and yeah I actually stole the vinyl record cause I liked the innocent cover shot,I was listening to wire, buzzcocks, stranglers, joy division u.p. , clash, cabaret voltaire, throbbing gristle, and reggae like U-roy, big youth, D.K. and more. and I got into that nerveous sound.o.k.
in the late 80's early 90's I have bought a vinyl (white version) .and played it to my house mates ,whilst big black ,hard-ons and metallica and pixies were the choise of the day.and hey no one in a shared house hold full of punks ever ripped it of the turntable and put a boot to it .there ya go maybe some are wise and some pretend to be full of cigarrette smoke coughing off little headaches. this music this crazy rhytms is joy. good nookie music it was too. take it easy ....but take it
