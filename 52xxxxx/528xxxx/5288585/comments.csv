,loeffel,2010-02-05T23:16Z,"dou5065, could you please be more specific? It works for me under Windows and Linux just fine."
,dou5065,2010-02-09T14:23Z,"I tried your keygen again and this time it worked fine. 
I will wait for 5.1 version to see if the bugs have been ironed out and if it works fine I'll buy the program. Bibble Labs is a small company and these guys need all the help they can get. For now the catalog of version 5.01 is too buggy to be usable so I am not willing to pay for it."

1. your virus scanner blocks it,
2. (just like me) you use a 32-bit system, and you will need a 64-bit...

thanks for the upload, but im not using it ;)"
,loeffel,2010-02-27T12:09Z,"Well, for all you people who whine about the keygen not working, you've just embarrased yourselves. There is a README.txt located in the download, and it includes ready-generated keys for both Bibble and Noise Ninja. The reason for this was to allow OSX and Linux users to get keys (the keygen only works on Windows). So, in the end it's just an RTFM issue"
