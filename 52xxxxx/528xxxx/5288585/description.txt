*** BIBBLE 5.0.3 released: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5451352 ***

*** This torrent is obsolete! ***






Bibble 5.0.0 Pro for the following systems:

Windows
OSX
Fedora/OpenSUSE
Ubuntu/Debian 32-bit
Ubuntu/Debian 64-bit

See http://www.bibblelabs.com/ for info about Bibble.

Also includes a keygen that I've verified for Ubuntu/Debian 64-bit and Windows. Should also work for the other systems, please leave a comment below if it worked/didn't work for you.

The keygen also includes a serial for Noise Ninja and for Bibble 4. Cred to CoRE for the keygen.

Please, buy the program when you've finished evaulating Bibble. It's the best RAW converter around, certainly gives Lightroom a run for its money. Let's keep Bibble Labs alive and make sure that they can release 5.1 soon (there are some minor issuse with 5.0.0)

Enjoy, and please leave a comment if this was helpful.
