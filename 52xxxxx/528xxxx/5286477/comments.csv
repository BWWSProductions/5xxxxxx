if so do us all a favour who are stuck at 96.3% and SEED PLEASE!!"
,Hybrys,2010-02-01T18:34Z,"This thing has 79-110 leechers, and zero seeds.  It's very frustrating, and I'm sure if we had ONE seed for a good 20 minutes, we'd have 5-10 dedicated seeders from then on."
,commentboy123,2010-02-02T00:32Z,"I agree. I'd seed this for a very long time if I actually FINISHED DOWNLOADING!
But the strange thing is that I use utorrent 1.8.5 and for the Peer Exchange server, there are currently 7 seeds, but I can't seem to connect to any of them...neither can any others"
