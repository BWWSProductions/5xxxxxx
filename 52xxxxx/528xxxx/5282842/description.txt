Inspired by the Swedish sculptor Carl Milles' huge bronze statue of a man, head thrown back, singing a salute to the sun, SUN SINGER is a celebration of the sun and the different ways in which we experience it. A lyrical and elegant trio album recorded in New York's Cathedral of St. John the Divine.

Enjoy!
