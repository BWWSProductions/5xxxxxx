Information:
Literally thousands of government employees are sworn to secrecy at the base called Area 51. Why? It is known for a fact that many USA aircraft are designed and tested there, and for national security reasons, these state-of-the-art planes and weapons demand secrecy. But is that the only reason for the veil? Many think not. Many reports have come from this clandestine site of reverse-engineering of UFOs, test flying UFOs from other worlds, and development of our own designs based on craft captured from other galaxies.
