[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-15T16:05Z,"No you can't, the invite system not working yet"
,siil369,2010-01-15T16:24Z,plz seed
,sambaman009,2010-01-15T16:37Z,"it looks like theyve made a patch to stop us playing with legit players, is there any way there will be a crack that will allow us to play with legit players again, coz right now  it takes like 20mins to find a game"
,BheegiBilli,2010-01-15T16:44Z,"50c3nt:

There are no more free beta keys for Zero Gear.

What to do?"
[T],liluser,2010-01-15T16:49Z,"new update for MW2 1.0.175
can this be updated to the new version update ?"
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-15T16:57Z,"@sambaman009: no it working fine, it take the same time 1-2 minutes

@BheegiBilli: no you don't need zero gear key, just install the demo. the instructions are inside

@liluser: yes you can do that when IW update to 1.0.176 
you can do that also now but it's unstable"

It says patch-md.ff different than server....Something like that and it wont work..Im i doing something wrong ?"
,kkBry,2010-01-15T17:10Z,"I installed the 1.0.175 version, i instantly find a server but i get ""Failed to join Steam-lobby"".

Have do i fix it?"
,foffe30,2010-01-15T17:13Z,It says patch_md.ff is different from the server.and sometimes failed to join steam-lobby.
,sambaman009,2010-01-15T17:14Z,hmm after about 10minutes in the lobby it finds one matched player*sigh*
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-15T17:20Z,"@foffe30: yes you do something worng, follow carefully the instructions, copy all COD MW2 files in C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\zero gear\Server

than copy the folder zero gear in this torrent and paste it in C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common

by overwriting the existing files

@kkBry: as I say 1.0.175 it's not working well you have to wait until IW update to 1.0.176"
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-15T17:22Z,"@sambaman009: open your NAT, and follow carefully the guide. I found a DM in 10 seconds"
,sambaman009,2010-01-15T17:35Z,"yep opened nat with port 28960-29000 but still cant find a match. just to make sure, this is paravozs crack right?"
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-15T17:41Z,"yes, it's the parovoz. i think you have to delete all the content of the folder Server and redo all from beginning"
,sambaman009,2010-01-15T17:50Z,"ohkk, i guess i might have screwed somethin up, but i still find a few people, but it takes like 10mins to find 3 people"
,aliendydo,2010-01-15T18:14Z,"50c3nt:

The zero Gear demo only lasts for another 2 days for me, what to do after that?"
,foffe30,2010-01-15T18:19Z,"50c3nt:

It still wont work,it says that patch_md.ff is different than server.It comes up when the DM is about to start.
It worked with the other one 172 before some days ago. any idea what to do ? :)"
,foffe30,2010-01-15T18:23Z,"50c3nt:

Do i have to fix a new steam account again ? it worked with 172."
,sambaman009,2010-01-15T18:51Z,"took all the mw2 files out, reinstalled mw2, put the files back in the server, still says 0/19 good games, and stays that way"
,Koustas,2010-01-15T19:32Z,But i can play with people who's got the cracked version huh ?
,foffe30,2010-01-15T20:53Z,"50c3nt :

,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-01-15T21:22Z,"It looks like IWNET stopped supporting 174, fuck it"
,foffe30,2010-01-15T21:25Z,Same here..now players show up..
,kkBry,2010-01-15T21:26Z,"when using the v1.0.174 patch i cant find any games, but when I use v1.0.175 i found lots of games but get the ""Failed to join steam lobby"".

,k2pikachu,2010-01-16T00:38Z,"Yeah, I tried both .174 and .175. Both of them don't work..."
,Quackstar,2010-01-16T00:46Z,"Guys who downloading this crack for the first time, let me explain: Once in a while there is a update of Modern Warfare 2. People who play MW2 through Zero Gear are playing with a patch which isnt the latest. If MW2 is updated, you cant play on that patch anymore, so there must be made a new crack for a patch. This was the crack, but it seems it just worked for an hour or so."
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-16T00:50Z,"yes, it's not working anymore. I update you tomorrow"
,BlackMoth,2010-01-16T02:14Z,thanks 50 we need you :P

,m0neystax,2010-01-16T06:26Z,"word that link didnt work for me either,
rene1047 are u using cracked 1.0.175 or 1.0.176"
,sambaman009,2010-01-16T09:08Z,"i kept on trying and eventually i did get into a game, then after that game it started sayind steam lobby failed or what ever"
,dangirdas,2010-01-16T11:44Z,yeah the same thing happend with me to :(
,rene1047,2010-01-16T11:57Z,"i use the 175, it worked fine yesterday..
but u need the host to be a user of the crack and even if u get that .. u'll get host migration after 1 min playin and with the host migration u'll get kicked."
,Quackstar,2010-01-16T12:13Z,"The other link for the crack, which was posted as a comment here, worked for an hour or so and then exactly the same came up: Error: Failed to join Steam lobby. 50c3nt please upload a good crack (:"
,rene1047,2010-01-16T12:40Z,another good crack game out.. its hard to find a lobby but when u find it no kicks..
,rene1047,2010-01-16T12:40Z,http://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=54832&start=510
,sambaman009,2010-01-16T12:48Z,does that one work? has anyone tried it?
,Quackstar,2010-01-16T13:26Z,"I tried, and ull get kicked every 2 mins. At least it isnt saying: Error: Failed to join Steam lobby. But I cant play like this either."
,sambaman009,2010-01-16T13:26Z,"with the new crack after a while playing i get 
""disconected form steam"""
,Koustas,2010-01-16T13:31Z,"Dude's, don't be so desperate. Chill a bit and let 50cent fix a new crack. Check again tonight"
,Quackstar,2010-01-16T13:39Z,"@Koustas: You think hes the one who makes the cracks? Nah, hes just uploading them. The cracks were made by Parazov, he already made a crack for 1.0.175 but when ur playing that crack it will disconnect you after 2 minutes of playing. So he cant crack it, at least not today. It could be that we have to wait a little longer. Maybe a week or two."
,rene1047,2010-01-16T13:45Z,rofl
,sambaman009,2010-01-16T13:46Z,"ohh thats why,quackstar, are u also getting the error after 2mins that says ""disconnected from steam""?"
,rene1047,2010-01-16T13:46Z,one other crack works fine lol for some reason cant post the link ^^
,Quackstar,2010-01-16T13:51Z,Yep. All the cracks only works fine when you are host.
,Koustas,2010-01-16T17:44Z,Well let Pavaroz fix it then..
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-16T20:40Z,"ok there is new crack from paravoz but it still not work very well. if you join host that have original game it will kick you after 2 min, if you join a cracked host you can play. there is very very low probability to join a cracked version. the good news is that you can run your personal public host, where  you can invite your friends (the invite work for someone for other one not work).  if you want to be able to invite, you have to buy a game from steam (example a cheap game with online 3?) that give you the friend list so you be able to invite your friends. if you want I can upload the new crack but I tried it 2 times and it kicked me out after 2 minutes, because I joined a host that have original game. my advise is to put a tag before your name (example: [ZeroGear] YOURUSERNAME) that give you the ability to recognize if the host have cracked or original game and exit if it's original.
If you want I can upload the new crack otherwise wait for a new workaround"
,Koustas,2010-01-16T20:55Z,"yea, upload it"
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-17T01:38Z,"https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5285223
new crack 1.0.175"
[T],liluser,2010-01-19T12:37Z,cant this be updated to the new version 1.0.177
