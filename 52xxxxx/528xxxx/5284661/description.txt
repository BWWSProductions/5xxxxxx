GAME DESCRIPTION:
Mattel's Barbie is joined by friends Kira, Christie, and Teresa in a virtual beauty salon filled with styling tools, makeup, and accessories in Barbie Magic Hair Styler CD-ROM. In the Hair Salon, players use a style guide, brush, curler, hair coloring, scissors (straight and angled), and a special comb that magically makes hair grow. Lipsticks, eye shadow, blush, foundation, and tattoos are available in the Makeup Salon, while the Accessory Salon features glasses, jewelry, and costumes with masks for all occasions.

Children four and up can prepare Barbie and her friends for careers or special occasions like dream dates, costume parties, and weddings. A snapshot camera allows users to take up to a dozen pictures during each styling session to create a slideshow chronicling the makeover process. After makeovers are complete, a Grand Finale showcases Barbie or her friends at their special event where one picture can be taken, framed, personalized, and printed.

ROOTS AND INFLUENCES:
The Barbie Doll line is one of the most successful in history, with sales of more than $1.7 billion (U.S.) in 1998 with the average American girl, between the ages of 3 and 11, owning ten Barbie dolls currently sold in more than 150 countries around the world, with 1999 marking Barbie's 40th anniversary, with the franchise expanding. But the world of Barbie today is a great deal more than a doll and accessories, including interactive games and software, as well as licensed products for girls, including books, apparel, food, home furnishings, and home electronics. While software for Barbie has been available for several years, Barbie: Magic Hair Styler CD-ROM continues the long tradition of Barbie PC games.
