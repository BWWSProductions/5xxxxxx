,marijuanaboy000,2010-05-07T20:30Z,"I hope this one doesn't have a problem. The other torrent through installation + crack are good, 
Once loading a campaign, game crashes..."
,marijuanaboy000,2010-05-08T06:24Z,"Sorry for double posting. Best torrent for HMM V. This pack includes HMM5, Tribes of the East, and Hammers of Fate.  Super fast downloading with 260+mbps.. Took me 3 hours using Wifi. 

Very easy, just download the .iso. Mount it on a virtual CD (i.e. Daemon Tools Lite), install the game, and play. No cracks needed or whatever.  Works like a charm unlike other torrents of HMMV

If you don't have a virtual CD, just search for Daemon Tools in google. Thank easy.

Good job! Thanks egovir32!!!"

The installer refuses to work, saying it is not compatible with 64 bit, even when you change it to install under the XP SP2 emulator (which is what Windows comes up with as a recommendation). Anyone manage to get it working under 64bit, and if so, how? Thanx!"

At Campaign 1, Mission 4 (Negotiation) the game freezes after I complete a primari objective (reach a dwarven town). The sound is still going and I can even navigate through the quest menus and switch between the underground/overland looks but I cant control the camera, I cant move the characters, I cant end a turn etc.
