Otep (also written as OTEP or OT3P) is an American heavy metal band formed in 2000 in Los Angeles, California by Otep Shamaya.

The band Otep was signed after only four shows, without a demo, strictly on the power of their live performance. Their live performance proved to be so impressive that Sharon Osbourne offered the unsigned act a spot on the 2001 Ozzfest tour. Since then Otep has appeared at the festival three times. To date, the band has released four full lengths, one EP and toured in support of all four releases.

Otep Shamaya has also published two books of poetry, spoken at the Democratic National Convention in 2008, and has been recognized as a painter. She openly supports Carbon Rally , PETA and the WSPA. In addition to lending her support to numerous groups, Shamaya has started the social networks "All Shapes and Sizes" and "Girls Out Now". On December 21, 2008, Shamaya created a blog entitled "I'm Not a Monster".

On April 6, 2009, it was announced that Otep is now signed to Victory Records. On April 7, 2009 Shamaya announced that the new album will also mark the band reuniting with former members Mark "Moke" Bistany on drums and Rob Patterson on guitar. Otep stated a song titled "Rise, Rebel, Resist" from the new album Smash the Control Machine is slated for release August 18th, 2009. However, "Smash the Control Machine" will be the first song to be heard off the new album, receiving air play in June 2009. Koichi Fukuda is playing piano on the new album, and Emilie Autumn will play violin.The band appeared with 2Cents, Five Finger Death Punch & Shadows Fall on the 'Shock & Raw Tour' of North America in the fall of 2009. An article in the spring 2009 issue of Broken Records Magazine states that Otep delves beyond music to focus on important issues.
