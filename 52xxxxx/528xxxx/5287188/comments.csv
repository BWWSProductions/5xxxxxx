PLEASE HELP!!!"
,speedo1998,2011-07-09T09:41Z,"This is only for PSPs with custom firmware so if you dont have it, google how to.
Or you just drop the file in the ISO folder of your psp once you open it on your computer"
,cxy955,2011-09-20T21:51Z,"I have a psp 2002/3 i think with official version 6.60 and i found it incredibly difficult to get this so here's how u did:
1. download 
2. connect your psp
3. [you need to extract the files] copy the two ""me_installer"" files into 0:PSP/GAME
4. Disconnect psp and launch this.
5. reconnect and add a folder call ISO 
6. put your game into this folder, disconnect and you'll find the game under game, memory stick."
