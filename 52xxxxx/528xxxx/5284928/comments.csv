Then again I will download from people who are recommended to me and miss these mislabeled torrents."
,TheAwesome2012,2010-01-16T23:13Z,And that's another thing you website spammers can fuck off as well.

GET CRACKING KNOCKX2"
,TheAwesome2012,2010-01-17T17:37Z,"It's not about giving credit, LH-oswald. Knocks main beef here is taking credit for other peoples work (Call it 'stealing' but that sounds a bit hypocritical as we are all technically stealing) and trying to pass it off as a DvDrip when it's clearly not. Thing is with most R5's is while they may look like DvDrip's in picture quality they may lack big time in sound quality in some cases. Example. This is a relabeled release with LINE audio meaning you can barely tell the difference between DVD audio and LINE. However XoLWoX dosen't label his torrent correctly to bother telling us that and could be easily uploading a copy with improper audio from a CAM (Which is issue for hearing the audience laughter, hissing noises and have more chance of knocking some scenes out of sync). However as Knock pointed out this is a relabel of a R5 LINE release which is fine BUT to the untrained noob of torrent downloading (Especially those with limited bandwith each month) he is downloading a copy that would be unwatchable due to the sound being bad and out of sync (See one of many releases of 'The Box' when it first came out).

Rant done."
