the pure drop project is 'going real good', following the release of the debut CD 'drive' and the first festival slots in 2007. Jo Long and the pure drop are performing reguarly around the south of England and Jo's reputation as a singer of the highest quality is being taken to a wider audience.  Now the pure drop has the website and the album, there is every reason for the success to continue. 

jo long has been singing and performing in and around Southampton, solo and also with arnie cottrell, the velvet doonicans and neil simpson, amongst others. don has played and recorded with several bands, most recently as guitarist with â€˜tradâ€™ band Broderick (with rick and colm who appear on the album). don has performed  in the USA, in europe and at UK festivals (and in a previous life played with the flatville aces). In between playing gigs, don works as an acoustic consultant, designing the acoustics of buildings and his better-known projects include the Wales Millennium Centre, the Sage Gateshead, The Lighthouse in Poole and Concert Halls at St Swithuns and Millfield Schools.

jo and don met when jo opened for a Broderick CD launch party at the borderline in Soho. It wasnâ€™t too long before they started gigging together on the Southampton gig scene and together decided to make an album, joining forces with rick foot (double bass) and with help from colm murphy and tim payne. colm and tim are two of southampton's brilliant musicians who deserve to be heard by a wider audience

the debut CD album drive has been warmly received, jo long and the pure drop have a burgeoning reputation for a live set which, in the true 'tradition' takes you to places of love, loss, sorrow and redemption.
