Version 0.1 of a few of my power hour projects.  I've edited these so that what I consider to be the best minute of each song is included.  Note that this is a work in progress.  The 00s Power Hour lacks a playlist, and was created early in 2009 so it is missing some new hits.  Also, forthcoming is a power hour playlist for the 90s set.

For the 80s and 90s, the last song on the playlist is full-length.  In both cases there is a drinking game associated with the song, google search for the rules in each case.
