,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:09Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.

,FuckDMCA,2010-05-24T18:29Z,"I didn't get any copyright letter after downloading all TTC courses. Knowledge should be free, who would be foolish enough to sue someone for gaining description that is true for all of us? I bet the ""IgotDMCA""-account is the owner or employee at TTC wanting to sell knowledge so he can buy a ferrarri. Download TTC-material, it's the best teachers teaching description that makes sense of where we are, why we are here and the situation we find ourselves in. Don't let the government remove knowledge, don't fear fools who want to make it available for only the wealthy in capitalism, those born rich for example. I strongly recommend everyone to share TTC-material. If something can be copied with no effort we should do it. It is a rare pleasure to be able to have infinite copies of something, an even greater pleasure when it's high quality courses like these. Also remember: you cannot observe the universe from the outside."

,alexross8,2010-06-05T07:55Z,"I want to study philosophy.
How dare anyone tell me what is right and what is wrong to take.
Knowledge is free.
Books are knowledge .
Documentaries are knowledge .
I thought we lived in the age of information , but I guess not.
Thanks a lot you hypocrites . Now a child in Africa will starve to death because of them government dogs and bitches ."

,oblomist,2010-10-16T21:55Z,DMCA letter received. Stay away from this torrent.
,tbacid5,2010-11-13T02:13Z,"You know what, ""IGotDMCA"", just for your dumb remarks about receiving a letter from DMCA, I have made it a point to spread this to as many people as possible, together with all the other releases where you state the exact same dumb remark. Getting a letter from DMCA, eh? I guess, you should have refrained from giving them your address in the first place!
Btw, dohduhdah... I trust it IS your real name... and address?! :o) Thanks a million for your excellent uploads. You're top notch!"
