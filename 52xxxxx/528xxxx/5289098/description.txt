A fix that makes it possibly to play both Warchiefs and Asian Dynasties at the same time, in the same game.

You put the fix/file into your registry (in the map there you got your game - probably in C:Program FilesMicrosoft GamesAge of Empires III)

When you put the fix into that map, you can play both AOE 3, Warchiefs and Asian Dynasties at the same time. 

I also had this problem and when I found this file I got really happy.

So just download it, put it into your Age of Empires 3 map and then open: 
Age of Empires III - The Asian Dynasties game

And everything will work great !

If you still got some problems, even if you shouldn't have any, then comment that.

But it will work trust me, I worked for me and many others so there wont be any problems.

Thanks and Have Fun !
