,bucket13,2011-01-06T05:04Z,"Ok for those of you using windows 7 x64 I was able to get this working you have to right click and choose edit on the file when it opens change
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires 3 Expansion Pack 2\1.0] to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires 3 Expansion Pack\1.0] basically you are adding Wow6432Node between software and Microsoft apparently windows 7 stores these keys in a different location."
