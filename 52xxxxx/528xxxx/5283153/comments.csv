,shiner-bock-beer,2010-01-22T05:25Z,"Stuck at 53.2%. 

Tried the trial, but it's not the Premium version and I couldn't get the Keygen to work either. Kept saying invalid. chuck90025 please check the upload again."
,chuck90025,2010-01-25T06:48Z,"My apologies to everyone, it looks like this is turning out to be a dud. I'm stuck at 53.2% also. Next time I'll make sure I DL the whole thing before I post it here."
,MoBetta,2010-02-03T22:24Z,"This worked great when installed on MS Windows 2003 Enterprise Server. Keygen Works Perfect IF YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. 

FYI- I could not get this software installed on Windows XP SP3 or WINDOWS 7 32bit or 64bit. "
,Daave311,2010-03-15T16:25Z,As well stuck at 53.2%. MoBetta are you sure you are posting on the correct torrent?
,mmatch85,2010-11-26T21:30Z,"Keygen is not working for the web-based edition of Sage, which is downloadable from the site..."
