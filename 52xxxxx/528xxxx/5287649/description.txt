Show Info.........: How I Met Your Mother - Season 1

Plot: How I Met Your Mother is a comedy about Ted (Josh Radnor) and 
how he fell in love. It all starts when Ted's best friend, Marshall 
(Jason Segal), drops the bombshell that he's going to propose to his 
long-time girlfriend, Lily (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher. 
At that moment, Ted realizes that he had better get a move on if he 
too hopes to find true love. Helping him in his quest is Barney 
(Neil Patrick Harris), a friend with endless, sometimes outrageous 
opinions, a penchant for suits and a foolproof way to meet women. 
When Ted meets Robin (Cobie Smulders), he's sure it's love at first 
sight, but destiny may have something else in store. The series is 
narrated through flashbacks from the future.
