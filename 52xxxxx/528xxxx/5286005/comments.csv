,Snellv,2010-04-14T20:54Z,"Unable to play this game on Vista. 
Set compatibility mode to 98 and also tried download blink32.dll for the soundloop but crashes always at the beginning of the first map. 
Any advices?"
,Snellv,2010-04-14T21:08Z,"Small update. 
Works with 95 compatibility mode but downloaded dll does not work with the game. It fixes the sound loop but messes up the graphics. 
Also noticed that game requires to create new profile everytime you start it. 
Anyone fixed the sound? Also any ideas about the profile problem?"
,Brain1207,2010-09-20T06:53Z,If you have a profile problem - try create folder with name User_Profiles in the game folder.
,roster312,2010-11-29T16:13Z,All i noticed that it has to create a new profile ALL the time. If you download the dll the main menu graphics get messed up. and that i WONT save anygame or let you continue to the next level... any solution?
