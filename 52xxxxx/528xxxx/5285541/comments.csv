,honunet,2010-01-23T04:00Z,"EZ you are the Jean Luc Picard of Torrent Uploaders..  Once again, you have outdone yourself.  Thanks a million million"
,honunet,2010-01-23T04:10Z,"Fabio once again, what the hell are you talking about.  Do you honestly think you will lure ANYbody away from EZ's torrents, much less the commenters you see before you? if you are looking to poach, if you see EZTV, run the other way because nobody will buy what you are selling.  We have sampled his pristine products without fail, perfect in every way, likely far before you were even born.  So run along now with your bullshit and let me enjoy the Sisters of the Light. on side note, I am still pissed they made Lord Raul Richard's brother instead of the Father he is in the book.  The book has lord Raul raping Richards mother then banishing her.  Oh well i wont hate, I will sit back and see what develops.  I hope they bring in the really, really bad man from the south who controls minds from great distances.  Anyway thanks again EZ"
