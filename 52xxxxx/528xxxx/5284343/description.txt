Plot:
In 1897, the â€œPoisoned Knifeâ€ clan broke into the royal palace of Thailand to steal the Royal Antiques which the King intended to give to America as a reward for its help in negotiations that avoided Thai territorial cuts. The clan succeeded in stealing the antiques, but the thieves didnâ€™t escape with their lives. Before their deaths, they hid the antiques somewhere close to the palace. During his interrogation, the last bandit chose to end his life by Master Sawangâ€™s sword and let the place where the Royal Antiques were hidden die with him.

Now, Wisa (Winston Omega), the mafia boss whose ancestor masterminded the theft of the antiques wants to find them so he hires Patrick (Russell Wong â€“ 'Romeo Must Die', 'Mummy 3:Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor'), The Former Director of the U.S. military National Subterranean Exploration Unit, to search for the lost antiques . Using U.S. Army satellite scans, Patrick and Selina (Patharawarin Timkul â€“ 'Bangkok Dangerous', 'Jan Dara'), the beautiful and sexy assassin, retrieve them from beneath the Thai temple where Krit (Mike B â€“ 'Brave'), Master Sawangâ€™s great grandson and a gifted martial artist resides as a temple boy. When they steal the antiques from the temple, itâ€™s down to Krit with the help of Paifah (Intira Jaroenpura â€“ 'Nang Nak', 'King Naresuan trilogy'), an Archaeology student to retrieve them. Together they fight against the powerful greedy group of thugs, will they be able to save Thailandâ€™s national treasures ?
