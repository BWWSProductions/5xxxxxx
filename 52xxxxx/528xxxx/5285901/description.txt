Notes: Continuing the series of European date movies, here's IrrÃ©versible. This was probably the hardest SD source I've encountered so far; the image is often extremely noisy, and the way this movie is shot makes me think that the cameraman was probably attached to a camera with duct-tape and beat up while being told to film the scenes.
The result? A rather excellent encode and an amazing movie. So once again enjoy.
