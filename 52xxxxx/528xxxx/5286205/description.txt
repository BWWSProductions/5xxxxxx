************************************************************************************************

CrimeCraft places players in a surprisingly clean and orderly post-apocalyptic city that's fortified against the chaos and danger of
the outside world. There's something about an ecological disaster and an overall financial collapse, but you'd never guess that from
the pristine Best Buy billboards and reliable elevated trains that are found within the city. The city serves as a central social hub
where players can interact with vendors and trainers in between taking part in repetitive PVE and PVP instances that reveal some fun
shooting mechanics but are lacking in story or purpose.
