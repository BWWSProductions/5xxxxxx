patched exe for WLM 14.0.8089.726

for version number check:

1) start WLM
2) help
3) about messenger
4) version/build

use only with the appropriate version. if your build differs, you may still try to use it, but
that's discouraged, you should modify your exe yourself.

install:

1) go to
  - x86: c:Program FilesWindows LiveMessenger
  - x64: c:Program Files (x86)Windows LiveMessenger
2) rename msnmsgr.exe to msnmsgr.exe.orig
3) unzip msnmsgr.exe to here
4) run WLM. when you drap & drop a picture in a conversation windows it should be sent as a
   regular file, but others will still be able to share photos with you.
