Does PKGBackup work with ROCK applications? Ever since I jailbroke my iTouch I've been unable to access Cydia. Also, pkgbackup, when I last looked, required a Shit load full of apps to be already installed. Were all of these included as well?

Anyway, thanks again for the apps."

I'm not sure about PackageBackup, as I use AptBackup because I think it does a better job backing up my stuff.  The dependencies would not be in that RAR pack, but dpkg *might* download and install them for you.

P.S. You're welcome.     :)"
