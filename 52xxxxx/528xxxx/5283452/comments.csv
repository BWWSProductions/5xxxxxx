I know I'm being tough on the French but they haven't managed to resurrect their film industry since the golden age of Fr. cinema. The films they release rarely leave Europe, let alone France.

Anyway, this one is bad. Maybe one scare throughout. The zombies look more like orcs or vampires in a low budg. Underworld type thing. The most inane and uneducated aspect of the film is: the virus mutates and so do the zombies?!? One of them grows a second set of nostrils??? Though it's either filmed in the Pyrenees or the Alps (in the winter) there's no shortage of naked body-builder zombies screeching for fresh meat in the Alpine mountains. The characters are bland. Some of the scenes are just amateur (i.e. either poorly shot, acted, or directed, or maybe all). Despite the strict anti-gun laws of the E.U. several characters have hand guns and even machine guns. It tries to ask all types of ethical questions about peoples loyalty to one another that seems extremely out of place for the end of the world. In this film it's ""live by the sword, cry by the sword"".

It was a waste. It feels like you've already rented/downloaded this one turned it off then a month later, having completely forgotten about it, re-rented/D.L.ed it and now you feel stupid. Or something like that.

Oh yeah the subtitles are extremely inaccurate. Not that it matters the dialogue is second grade, unimaginative, uninspired, contrived, and so on."
