I was hoping that you would consider putting Sanctuary back in your schedule please?

I know you removed it due to 'grab & runners' and so I would ask EVERYONE to please SEED all files that they download to at least 100%, more if you have the bandwidth and aren't limited by upload caps.

If you don't then the show (any show) may be dropped due to greedy people.

I only have the courage to ask for Sanctuary to be considered as this week people didn't grab & run (for the most part).

To all those who seeded THANK YOU. To any who downloaded and didn't seed, please fuck off and go away.

Jon"
,demonicjack,2010-01-15T20:28Z,Can u please upload A Serious Man???? Thanks for all your uploads :D 
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-15T20:50Z,"@Jon: Yes, tomorrow goes Dollhouse and  - Sanctuary.

@demonicjack: I am still a day behind considering requests and TPB upload downtime. I really cannot. I keep repeating that as parrot all week long. Sorry."
,stev666,2010-01-15T21:20Z,"Hey 20-40 just wanna say thank you, since I found your uploads my life has become so much better, I can't thank you enough for all you do for us with the small file size and the gr8 quality of the uploads. May I ask that you please add metalocalypse to your schedule,if you have open slots, I was thinking as dollhouse is ending metalocalypse could take its place. I would really appreciate it my friend. Keep up the great work. 

Stev your friend in south africa"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-15T21:35Z,"@steve: Ok, let replace and see how it will go (interest+seeders+thanks).

@demonicjack: On second thought, I might squeeze it in since it is a big file (as it is for now - 1.35 GB). Just be patient please, I haven't properly slept for three days trying to catch up."
,ritesmax,2010-01-15T23:15Z,"Thanks twentyforty for starting season 2 upload of being human i really appreciate it.
Can u please upload season 1 as and when its comfortable for u.Thanks in advance."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-16T00:21Z,"@ritesmax: OK, you have read the note, right? Reason for such note is a kind of warning, because I estimate 8 hours for whole Season. I hope and I need more people to speak up and be here when upload begins. 

So, more than single you, I cannot afford 8 hours exclusively for one torrent if one or two peers shows up. Are you fast enough? Minimum is 60-70 kB/s. Can you stay as seeder and how long and how good (not exclusively, but not to seed with 3 kB/s afterward)? So let me now, I'll check it tomorrow."
,jon4fun,2010-01-16T00:53Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for agreeing to encode/upload Sanctuary. I really appreciate it, as I'm sure all of it's fans will.

Cheers
Jon"
,ritesmax,2010-01-16T01:29Z,"Absolutely, i can seed at 256kb/s for 19hours a day.After u upload bh season1 i hope many others will seed as well.
Please do tell when u would upload, thanks."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-16T02:43Z,"@ritesmax: Fantastic! Oh men... you have four times my u/l speed. I wish I can go so fast... but...

OK, watch the time of this comment (anyone has shown comments time as his local time, ok?).
Torrent will be up exactly 19 and half hours from the time of this comment. It's my Saturday 10 PM, when I can go clean&fast as I can. Hope other people will read this and show up. Done.

Cheers guys and galls, time for me to hit the bed."
,nicermog,2010-01-16T14:06Z,thanks... i get pretty much all the shows now airing from 2040.
