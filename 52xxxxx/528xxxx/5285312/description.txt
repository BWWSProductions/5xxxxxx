TREE MEN STALK THE GLOOMY BACK - ALLEYS OF THE CITYÂ´S NOTORIOUS SLUMS.


Spiderman, a 28-year-old drug lord, embarks on a routine patrol through the shadowy streets of CorÃ©ia, the sprawling favela he controls.  

Inspector Leonardo Torres, a muscle-bound cop from Rio's drug squad, inches through the alleys of another shantytown, shots ringing out around him. 

And Pastor Dione, an evangelical preacher intent on ending the cityâ€™s drug conflict, trawls the slums for lost souls while trying to broker peace among all parties.  

With unprecedented access to some of Rio's most wanted men, together with the specialist police units that hunt down and kill them, this gripping film offers an intimate look at one of the bloodiest urban conflicts on earth.
