[T],FatFreddy69,2010-03-10T10:07Z,"Bitrate doesn't necessarily  dictate the quality of the rip but the encoding settings.

A poor 3000 KB/s encoding can be done in 3 hours  on a 2 GB RAM, while
a very good 1800 kB/s (with high encoding settings) in 8 hours on  4 GB RAM.
This is the magic about x264."
