,Sir.Willy,2010-10-04T07:45Z,"where do you type a password in? Once I downloaded this file and put it in to my applications, I started it up an it was all good from there....Just want to make sure I'm not missing something"
,cigburns123,2010-12-26T20:56Z,"i downloaded it on mac, and it doesn't open, do i need a certain program? i'm new to mac, so i'm not sure. thanks"
,5TAR5,2011-01-08T03:22Z,Mine didn't want to open either. Try opening the file with Disk Utility. That worked for me.
,IcyBrandy,2011-01-16T15:56Z,worked perfectly. +1

,micheltichu,2011-02-04T05:04Z,"great games, love it,,,thanks a lot"
,SinShadows,2011-03-12T16:00Z,Its not working. =(
,l.i.s.a,2011-03-27T04:37Z,"Yeah-- it didn't work for me, INITIALLY.
Finally figured out what to do with the Disk Utility thing someone else mentioned... here's what I did:

Right click in the .dmg file / open with ""Disk utility""
In disk utility, right click on the ""plant vs. zombies.dmg"" file listed in the left hand bar (not the sub-set listing) / click ""convert plants vs. zombies.dmg""

Box appears-- all data such as location and file name should be same as original (you're just replacing the original.) Click save, accept whatever prompts.

Once done, double click on the .dmg file where it was originally saved, and it should then actually open and show the app.

Yeah-- weird, I know. Hope it works for you like it did for me."
,l.i.s.a,2011-03-27T04:40Z,"Meh. Doesn't look like it posted my comment-- sorry if this shows up twice.

Didn't work for me either-- here is what I did based on other commenters Disk Utility idea.

Right-click in .dmg / open in ""Disk Utility""
Program opens, in right-side bar, you see the file (not w/the popclick icon) / right click / ""convert plant vs. zombies.dmg / Save (keep all data the same, you're basically replacing it.)

Once done, double click .dmg that you just replaced from wherever it was originally saved (ie- desktop) and it should open a window in finder showing the program, like usual....

hope that helps-- it worked for me."
