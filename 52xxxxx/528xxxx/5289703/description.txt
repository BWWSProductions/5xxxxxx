Heartland S03E12: The Reckoning

It's been two years since Marion's death and this is a tough time for Amy, who was unable to attend the funeral because she was still in the hospital. Visiting the cemetery she finds fresh flowers on her mother's grave - a sign that Victor Whitetail (Ben Cardinal) has made a return visit to Heartland. 

Old scars are revealed however, as Tim begins wondering if Victor was more than just friends with his ex-wife. Jack's surly attitude when Victor's name is brought up doesn't put Tim's mind at ease, but at least the two men don't break into fisticuffs in this week's episode.

Throw in Kit (Tatiana Maslany) having problems with her barrel racing horse, and Ty suggesting that Amy can help, and Amy suddenly has a lot to deal with.

Meanwhile, Lou gets invited to Paris by Peter. She is overjoyed until she learns that the trip is not exactly what she had envisioned.

And there is a surprise at the end of the episode.


The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Jan 17, 2010. According to the CBC website, the next 2 new episodes will air on Jan 24 and Jan 31, 2010.
