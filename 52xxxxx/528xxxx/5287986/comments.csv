,ToneZone,2010-01-19T12:28Z,Looks like everyone has topped out at 33%.  I'll pass on this torrent.  :(
[V],thethingy,2010-01-19T17:13Z,"eta = 21/01/2010 @ 08.00 uk time, big file loads of leachers."
,JingleBob,2010-01-20T02:03Z,"Downloaded just fine. The extract didn't work so goodly, though. Just got a quick flash of a command prompt window then nothing. :("
[V],thethingy,2010-01-20T05:59Z,file is 7.57gb and have uploaded 5.34gb so far so its very unlikly that you will be able to extract it yet.
,hmtester,2010-01-25T01:12Z,Anyone get this working on Windows 7 x64?
[V],thethingy,2010-01-25T01:17Z,"it works on 7 64, when you get to the copying dll step just check each of your adobe folders for additional dll locations, youll understand if you read the readme in the torrent. "
,lukasluk,2010-01-25T15:22Z,"Have installed it and it is working great. Good job!
What I didn't understand - how to follow new updates?
Thethingy, could you give some advice?

Thanks."
,Rigged,2010-01-25T18:59Z,"I got a problem. I turned my internet off and uninstalled any Adobe products I had, but when I try running the Setup, it won't let me. It keeps going Exception: TypeError: defaultProperties is null and won't install. Any way of fixing this?"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-26T02:01Z,"lukasluk, what do u mean?, the updates are in folders numbered 1 to 17, go into 1 and install updates 1 then 2 then 3 then 4, then go into folder 2 then 3 then 4 and so on, then turn off auto apdates and dont update anymore.

Rigged, delete the files you extracted, restart your pc, re extract the files, restart your pc, then you should be ok to install."
,Nightfalcon,2010-01-26T06:06Z,"Ok so far speed is good and if everything goes the way it is so far it will take me about 15 hour to download the whole thing. I let you know if it works.

Thanks thethingy!!!"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-26T06:48Z,increase the number of connected peers per torrent to 300 and this will download at 1.5 to 2 mbs.
,intruderone,2010-01-26T22:53Z,"Hi, had a problem during instal. Started fine, got bridge, media player, etc. Then said it failed to instal premeir, photoshop and alike. I have the firewalls turned off (temp until net plugged back in). Any fix for this? I use win 7 32 bit"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-26T23:01Z,"intruderone, install the cleanup tool in the download, run it as admin and uninstall all adobe entries, restart, reinstall."
,Nightfalcon,2010-01-26T23:26Z,So far everything is ok but I have a problem trying to make the hosts file look alike the one from your example the system said that the filename path is not correct but it is the one from the instructions. What can I do? Should I live the host file the way it is?
,intruderone,2010-01-26T23:31Z,"hi, thanks, did that. same results. Oh well, it was worth a try!"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-26T23:41Z,"Nightfalcon, dont start any of the apps till your hosts is set, use this one;

,Nightfalcon,2010-01-26T23:45Z,"I'll try but for some reason the system would not let me copy the file. I am doing the updates now, so far it looks good we see.

Thanks thethingy I let you know probably its going to take me another hour or so for the updates to install."
,intruderone,2010-01-27T02:23Z,"Hi, all installed but the following:
Fireworks,after effects, illustrator, adobe acrobat, premeir. All the rest did fine (photoshop was the big one I wanted!) I could probably download the others one at a time from this site. But dozen of the rest loaded and worked just fine.
Thanks,
intruder."
,intruderone,2010-01-27T07:36Z,"Ok, I tried on a different machine we have hear, loaded and worked perfectly. So, I will out line the two machines for reference:
Worked all the way thru: Intel I7 920, Asus MB; most worked but not all: AMD 965 Quad, Asus MB. Both are pretty high end, so doubt it was equipment. The big dif, the Intel machine is Win 7 64 bit - Clean instal. The AMD is 32 bit win 7 upgrade from Vista. Ghosts of Vista may be what's up here."
[V],thethingy,2010-01-27T07:42Z,"intruderone, yes its previous and current adobe apps that cause the nstall to fail, you need to remove all adobes with the clean up tool to get it to install fully."

,barkingfish,2010-01-29T20:53Z,"couple of questions: 1 - it says ""vista-win7""; will it work on XP 64bit edition? 2 - I used the windows clean-up tool to remove all my adobe apps, but I notice they're still there apparently it only removes installation log info. Do I need to uninstall the programs as well or will it just install over them?"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-30T04:57Z,"yes it works with xp64, youre best to uninstall everything adobe with the windows cleanup tool then run both adobe tools b4 installing this torrent"

,emcinc,2010-02-02T05:14Z,"that's the message I get when i try to extract maybe it,s my crappy version of winrar which is limiting file length or something because i also was getting errors that said file name length cannot exceed 260 characters what the hell is that?

,chuvak1,2010-02-03T01:28Z,"hey nvm i got it to work and everything works great! thanks a lot thingy. The problem with the installer I had was that for some reason my files were named differently when I download it. U just have to make sure that part 01 exe, really ends with ""...thingy.part01.exe"" and then when it prompted me for something else I changed the name ending of part 2 in to ...thingy.part02.exe.rar"" and same with 3 and 4 and so on. Hope dat helps if u read this emcinc. I think that maybe getting winrar and manually extracting all the parts one by one would also help with the installation error."
,chuvak1,2010-02-03T01:31Z,Another question tho...will running CCleaner or Advanced System Care to clean up registry and junk - will that mess up this installation? Could adobe activex or adobe flash player mess this up?

Second:  I'm not a pirate by nature, but Adobe sucks so much dick at what they do and charge so much for it, bless you people who make it free for us in a Robin Hood fashion.

Third:  This has worked for me on three computers.  If you guys can't get this torrent working, READ THE FUCKING MANUAL which TheThingy spent his time writing.  It works.  The biggest thing you have to remember is modifying your hosts file to defeat Adobe's DRM (which skullfucks your Windows installation but fails to do anything of value for you *or* Adobe), but there's even a batch file to do this, as well.

All in all, a great torrent."

,DanielRich_jp,2010-03-04T03:24Z,"Hi thethingy ,

Thanks for a great upload and an even greater willingness to help people out.

My OS: Windows 7 Ultimate x64. I get the 130.3 error code. The problem is that x64 versions have a mirrored/redirected system32 folder to serve the needs of both 32 bit and 64 bit apps. We have two folders Programs Files [x64] and Program Files (x86) [32-bit]. Root/Windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts leads to said file and has been edited and updated. This is a link to said topic @ http://blogs.sepago.de/helge/2009/06/04/where-is-the-hosts-file-on-windows-x64/

I upgraded vista x64 to win 7 x 64 with both CS3 and CS 4 running and updating, but after reformatting and reinstalling Win 7 CS4 refuses to operate properly.

This has nothing to do with you, because you've truly done a wonderful job, it's just frustrating to uninstall, strip, delete anything related to Adobe, only to end up where I began.

If you've any ideas or suggestions, I'll be for ever in your debt.

Thanks in advance,

Daniel

P.S. It did not install a FLEXnet folder. Installed as per your instructions."
,L_Ginous,2010-03-04T03:58Z,"Thanks for the torrent.

I have begun to install cs4. The installer window (Adobe CS4 Master Collection Installer: Initializing) appears with ""Checking System Profile"" on the bottom of the window. The blue completion bar seems like it's towards the end; however, doesn't look like it's going to finish. I've let it sit for over an hour. Any idea what this might be? Thanks!"
,seoduder,2010-03-04T05:00Z,I used Window Clean Setup utility.  It didn't work.  Now I can't uninstall any Adobe programs.  They're still there.  I have tried EVERYTHING.

This makes me want to kill myself.  I hate life.

,DanielRich_jp,2010-03-04T06:43Z,"L-ginous,

You don't mention your OS, but I assume you're using Windows. These are the minimum requirements to run Adobe Master CS4

Windows

    * 2GB of RAM (more RAM recommended when running multiple components)
    * 24.3GB of available hard-disk space for installation; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on flash-based storage devices)
    * 1,280x900 display with OpenGL 2.0?compatible graphics card
    * Some GPU-accelerated features require graphics support for Shader Model 3.0
    * Dedicated 7200 RPM hard drive for DV and HDV editing; striped disk array storage (RAID 0) for HD; SCSI disk subsystem preferred
    * For SD/HD workflows, an Adobe-certified card for capture and export to tape
    * OHCI-compatible IEEE 1394 port for DV and HDV capture, export to tape, and transmit to DV device
    * DVD-ROM drive (DVD+-R burner required for DVD creation)

""Contact Adobe Systems for support

,AlizeG,2010-04-23T16:59Z,"Incredible torrent. Make sure directions are followed exactly and works fine. 
Cpl questions : Step 9 - ""Go to EDIT,PREFRENCES,GENERAL & UNCHECK AUTO UPDATE BOX"" Didn't see this option in ANY program I opened, was I possibly looking in the wrong place(s) (within each program, right?)?
Also, Photoshop prompts an install for graphics card acceleration drivers and directs to http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/404/kb404898.html. Is this something I can do safely?
Thank you for this magnificent torrent!"

Downloaded and everything seems to be working fine. Thanks a million, dude ! 

However, just got a nagging msg that keeps appearing at the tool bar, i.e.

""Interactive services dialog detection

This problem happens because of partial incompatibility with Windows Vista. Please contact the program of device manufacturer(s) for more information.""

Just wondering if there's anything that I can do to solve this issue ?  Would greatly appreciate if you can spare some time to help me out here.

Thanks again !!

,sabretooth1,2010-04-28T16:49Z,"first of all thank you big time, this was great. however i have a problem which i can't solve:

Every time I load an of the CS4 apps I receive the following error:

Licensing for this product has stopped working. Error: 130:3 
It then asks me to restart computer but that doesn't solve it. Asks me to contact Adobe..obviously not going to do that either. 
Im running Windows 7. My system is very stable.  
This is an odd message what do you suggest? It's been working fine for at least 6 months. Then this out of the blue? any help greatly appreciated. Cheers."

can i ask is this cs4 the full version(ie not downloaded from adobe website) only reason i ask is that the adobe website version doesn't contain some codecs that need liscensing eg MPEG-4. if some1 who has this cs installed coould open up premiere pro and let me know what sequence preset options there are, specifically is there AVCHD and HDV options? thanks"
,DaHakenHacker,2010-05-06T01:05Z,i dont see why you neet to edit the hosts file. I installed Adobe CS4 Master Collection nearly 4 months ago and only used the amtlib.dll and has worked perfectly. so why should one need to edit the Hosts file??
[V],thethingy,2010-05-06T11:31Z,"DaHakenHacker, it blocks the activation service, adobe activation is not that good so your one has stayed activated but its best to edit the hosts"

everything went fine, but After Effects asks for a serial everytime I load it up, which is fine, because I can just enter any serial in the instructions and it'll open.

But, in Photoshop and Premiere I keep getting the 130:3 Error.

I followed all instructions with the tool kit and everything you say to do with this error twice, and I'm still getting this error, except after the second time premiere will work but around 5 - 10 minutes into working with it the 130:3 error will come. Are you sure this works?

Please get back to me asap.

I'm running Vista and installing premiere, After effects and Photoshop. Thanks!!!"

Also, I followed the instructions with regards to unchecking the auto-update box, however, that box is only there in one application, and even after that, the adobe updater still ran!

I'm presuming it's not safe to run the updater, if it isn't, could you be so kind as to tell me how to completely stop the updater running?

Thank you in advance for answering my queries, very good torrent, good DL speed, everything's working fine as far as I can see."

Then a few months ago i got a virus and malware bites detected the crack as a problem, so like an idiot I quarantined it. Then realized my stupidity and restored it. It worked fine for a little while, then gave me licensing issues. So I uninstalled and tried to reinstall and the setup wont finish. So after hours of fiddling with it and trying to remove every possible adobe program multiple ways, i reformatted my computer.

Now, i have tried to install the program with nothing else on the computer and I still cant successfully complete the initial setup. I have no idea why it wont run, especially since there are no adobe programs what so ever. Please help. I will say I used someone elses instructions posted on btjunkie, but I can't seem to find the torrent on btjunkie anymore. I seem to remember something having to be mounted but i dont see that in your instructions anywhere. "
