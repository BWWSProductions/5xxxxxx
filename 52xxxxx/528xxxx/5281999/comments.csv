,wassall,2010-01-16T11:59Z,Is this just a update or the full program?
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-16T12:28Z,"latest update and full program (once you use keygen to remove trial key, and generate more keys to unlock the other features/plug-ins).

If you wanted and knew how to remove the locks from Nero BackItUp and Burn,Move It and Media Home, you can have that too...a lil more work though:)"

u have all those on one system? lol nice
1 is enough for me Win 7x64

@biggod
im assuming ur using Nero Vision right?
you have to block it from checking the net, configure ur firewall. apply, then close.

@wassall
did you read my earlier post regarding the keygen?
"
,kcihtred2,2010-01-16T16:37Z,"ok i cannot seem to get a trial serial from nero... can u post a bunch up... and yes i do have all that one one pc (specs:)

,awolfman,2010-01-16T21:53Z,"Hey guys,

i see a lot of people are having trouble with nero 9.

1. Just download nero 9.4.26 trial version and execute the file.

2. It will come up with a text box and a demo serial key. DELETE the key and paste this
9M03-01A5-0WA4-5TAA-KA2P-8WZ5-CLA7-6122

3. Proceed with the installation, its very slow

4. After installation, go to Start>Nero>Nero Control Center 4

5. On the left side, click on license, there you have it, it shows expiration NONE.

I found this key at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5280328/Nero_9_full_version_license_retail_by_ebookking.

P.S. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN ANTIVIRUS cause most people are getting viruses. Its not uncommon to get a virus from a keygen

Thank you and please pass on this info to others having trouble.

Oh and thanks for uploading "
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-16T23:56Z,"why would you have to delete the trial key?

it wouldn't matter as long as it proceeded till installation finished, after that when you open the keygen its gonna wipe out the trial anyways (if done properly).

it can be very slow if your computer barely meets Nero's system requirements...its only natural(if ur running a Pentium 4 its gonna be rough).

People get virures from opening files which they should have better common sense not too, with keygens, they may show up as a virus;keygens are written in a script language that AV programs dont like hahaha aka false postives

Enjoy:) "

,awolfman,2010-01-17T07:30Z,"@grimreaper420 Sorry buddy, i had downloaded the trial from the nero website and no matter what i could not remove the trial key. But the key in my previous comment worked. I just thought i could help someone out there who might have trouble like i did.

And the installation took me a little over 5 mins on my 2.4 Ghz Compaq desktop (With 2 gb ram). Well my bad. Otherwise my pc is running smoothly 

Thanks anyway for helping people out with your uploads ;-)"

,wassall,2010-01-18T22:33Z,@awolfman cheers for the key. Oh and grimreaper420 ur right P4 is a rough time. I got P4 2.8GHz HT takes ages and sometimes compleatly screws up.
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-18T23:54Z,"@wassall
I know im right lmao P4 cant handle nero 9 as smooth as say compared to a dual core, core 2 dual, but runs amazing on a quad core.
i have (Q9650) on 790i sli ultra ,and it encodes, burns, and plays HD like its nobody's business :P imagine on an i7or AMD quad?
I did however install this on a P4 3.20GHz xfx 750i SLi mobo + 4GB@800Mhz ram its ok but dont expect it to run fast.

@emilr73
awesome :) no problem "

you didnt block Nero Showtime from the firewall

go open your firewall add  (C:)>Program Files>Nero>Nero 9>Nero ShowTime.exe

block it apply, then close it.
walaa no more issues

same thing applies to other .exe programs
i blocked them all literally

let me know how it goes"

download nero 9 removal tool

reboot, and re-install it again offline as i said in my tips, wait till it is completely done.

open keygen, reset white list, start generating for each and every application/plug-in you need.
Go to Windows firewall, or whatever you use.
Make sure Nero 9 and each and every program is BLOCKED.

Apply, and close.

Now...you should have it right, if not, keep on trying, or find someone to do it for you, no pun intended bro.

ohh man you deleted the wrong file...Nero needs that file (AdvrCtr4.dll Module) 2 operate i know i did it before too :)
If you deleted it (permanently), got some bad news for u, re-install Nero again.
If you can find it in the Recycle, restore it.

Works.

Thanks for this!

I downloaded it and didn't know what to do because I misunderstood what I was reading so I managed to stumble across a different torrent with, what sounded like similar instructions, so I decided to try them out and they worked.

All you need to do is install the trial, close Nero, open the Keygen, make sure you have Nero 9.0 selected from the drop down, clear the white list, generate a new key, add it to the white list then re-detect Nero."

Download the Nero General CleanTool, save this file to your desktop. Unzip the ZIP-file with WinZip or WinRAR and save the content to your hard drive. Double-click on the unzipped EXE-file to start the CleanTool. The window ?Nero General CleanTool? will open. The Nero products installed will be displayed.

Check the boxes next to the Nero products you want to remove. Then click the ?Clean? button. A status window will open. The execution of the tool may take several minutes.

Please wait until the progress bar has moved completely to the right. In the window ?Nero General CleanTool? click the ?Exit? button as soon as the erasing procedure is completed.

Reboot your computer. The Nero General CleanTool has removed all selected Nero entries from your computer.

Now.....re-install this torrent (offline)
Use keygen generate #'s, and block Nero via firewall
good luck :)

dude, why are you posting incorrect info under my torrent?
ppl dont bother listening to his ""advice"" he/she is clueless.
Here's your hint- ""Note: Don't delete anything like NeroPatentActivation.exe to avoid corruption of the program.""??
Hello?

You have to DELETE NeroPatentActivation.exe, and DON'T DELETE AdvrCntr4.dll.
Deleting AdvrCntr4.dll renders Nero virtually useless.

use keygen to generate bluray (plugin(s)&activation), also an issue has been raised by me, when opening up keygen(again), it may seem to remove some keys.
If that is the case, no big deal...
Re-generate all keys again:) than close.

My previous post and the answers:

Sidv20: hey i had tried to crack this software back in december but couldnt do so in the process i used up the entire trial period due which i cannot install it again now and use ur method..
plz help!!!

hbk4754 at 2010-01-21 11:46 CET:
@sidv20 You need to completely remove all traces of it. Go to c:\program files and shift+delete the nero folder. Say yes. Now if yor're on XP or earlier, click start>run type regedit and click ok. Vista/7 click start and type in the search bar just below all programs regedit hit enter. Click the + next to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE click the + next to SOFTWARE right click the nero folder and click delete. restart your computer and try again.

 grimreaper420 at 2010-01-21 12:49 CET:
@sidv20 easier way 
http://www.nero.com/enu/tools-utilities.html

Download the Nero General CleanTool, save this file to your desktop. Unzip the ZIP-file with WinZip or WinRAR and save the content to your hard drive. Double-click on the unzipped EXE-file to start the CleanTool. The window ?Nero General CleanTool? will open. The Nero products installed will be displayed.

Check the boxes next to the Nero products you want to remove. Then click the ?Clean? button. A status window will open. The execution of the tool may take several minutes.

Please wait until the progress bar has moved completely to the right. In the window ?Nero General CleanTool? click the ?Exit? button as soon as the erasing procedure is completed.

Reboot your computer. The Nero General CleanTool has removed all selected Nero entries from your computer.

Now.....re-install this torrent (offline)
Use keygen generate #'s, and block Nero via firewall
good luck :)"

,WaRCLouD86,2010-01-28T09:15Z,"Hi, can you help me plz.

I followed your instructions right up until I installed the trial version of Nero 9 and my trial version had expired.  I looked for possible serial numbers for downloading Nero on the internet, found it, I installed it, following your instuctions exactly.  Then I used the keygen to generate new serial numbers but as i hit ""reset white list"" and it said ""nothing changed"" and then i pressed ""generate,"" it gave me a new key, but when i tried to add each one to the ""white list,"" it told me that it ""Couldn't add serial, or serial already exists."" I also made sure that the ""auto register"" box was checked.

Can you please help me.  I have a feeling that this is due to the fact that I didn't use a unused serial key for the trial version.  Can you help me by giving me a ""clean"" serial key or any advice.

Thank you very much, your help is greatly appreciated.

I added ncc.exe to my block list and thats all the programs that showed for Nero 9.

,MagicMagdelene,2010-01-29T05:20Z,"Oh help.  :-( I tried to follow the directions step by step, but I came upon more than one problem:

1st - Shut off my internet.  After installing Nero 9 (which says Trial), I open the keygen.  (I attempted to right click and ""run as"" administrator, but it wouldn't let me because I didn't have the password.  Which to me, doesn't make sense, since I'm the only user on this computer.  I even went into my user accounts, and browsed around a bit - didn't see administrator anywhere.  I tried my personal password, tried ""admin"", tried ""password"".  Tried to fake out my system by creating a new account with the name administrator, but it said that the account already existed.  ????)  I made sure ""Auto register serials"" was checked.  I chose Nero 9, hit ""generate,"" and then ""add to white list.""  Next, I go to ""Activation (Nero 9), hit ""generate"", but there is no option for ""add to white list.""  Instead, that button now reads ""register serial""   ??? (so I continued on to the next step without doing anything - should I do something?)

2nd - Went to (C:) Program Files(x86)>Common Files>Nero>AdvrCntr4, and deleted the three files instructed, but NOT AdvrCtr4.dll (no problems on this step)

3rd - Checked my firewall.  Don't know what I'm looking for or at.  Explain ""configure"" to me? I'm running XP, so there is no ""system and security"" in the control panel.  There is Windows Firewall, and I opened that, but again, I don't know what I'm looking for or to change.  ????

4th - Rebooted.

5th - Checked Control Panel.  Again, ""Programs and Features"" is a Vista thing, so instead I went to ""add/remove programs"" to check my list. I have BOTH Nero 9 and Nero 9 Trial listed there.  I assume that's wrong????

6th - Reconnected to the internet

7th - I go to load Nero, and get the error message about the missing AdvrCtr4.dll.  Which doesn't make sense.  It's still right where it was supposed to be.

Can anyone help me? I'm no noob, but this one just waved a middle finger at me.  :-("
,nicklabonte,2010-01-29T09:07Z,"Ok i did it wrong the 1st time, but i redid it and i had nero 9 and nero 9 trial is this wrong?

Also i have Vista how do you choose what to block? I just clicked block all incoming in the firewall setting.

Lastly when i opened any of the preloaded files it says i dont have permission to do this??? 
Any help?"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-29T15:57Z,"@MagicMagdelene
my .rars and/or keygen does not require a password
""Programs and Features"" is a Vista thing- no it isn't its an XP, Vista, and 7 thing :)
""I have BOTH Nero 9 and Nero 9 Trial listed there. I assume that's wrong????"" yes it is.
remove both using nero removal tool, reboot, run this computer as the admin only> and not as a guest, or as another user.
Firewall needs to block apps, add firewall rule.
if unsure, Google it my friend:)

@nicklabonte dont just block all incoming connections, some legit programs need that connection, such as your BT client.

Shitty, spammy and crappy instructions (which for some reason aren't in a text file WITH the torrent.. but here on the website.. great).

You could've just simply told the people to:


---------------------------------------------

1) Disconnect from net (or, get Comodo Firewall and block the fucker from accessing net at all).

2) Install the Nero Burning Rom (note, it only accesses net when the installation starts).

3) After installation. DELETE > NeroPatentActivation.exe, NOSProductRegistration.dll & NOSUsageStatistics.dll < from ""C:\Program Files(x86)>Common Files>Nero>AdvrCntr4""


4) Star keygen. Reset whitelist and generate a new serial. Register Nero 9 and Nero 9 (Activation) with the same new serial you generated. Exit the keygen.

5) Start Nero


No need to restart PC or anything. You're done.

My Nero products all seem to still be working except for Nero Showtime, which is presenting me with an option to download Patent Activation as the files were deleted after install as per the instructions. Fortunately, I use WMP for DVD viewing so this isn't a deal breaker. If this happens to others, an option that fixed my issues was to use the cleantool, reinstall going the ""Custom"" route and not installing Showtime.

,ioniancat21,2010-02-11T22:33Z,"Thanks GrimReaper, unfortunately I still get Patent Activation for Showtime only. I have Showtime as well as my other apps blocked by Firewall and no dice so I'm unsure how to proceed although I really can't complain being this is a cracked version. I also have the option of backing down to 8.0 if this drives me nuts.

The only other thing I can think is that Nero is calling home through another module that's not one of the base programs so my Firewall blocks are not enough. I'm looking at that batch script made below to see if I can gather any clues. If I figure it out I'll spread the word.

Just to add, I see many out here complaining when Grim's fix doesn't work 100% perfect. Take a page from my book and be thankful that someone is trying to work the bugs out rather than posting virus or a solution that doesn't work at all. Like I said in an earlier post, I can install Nero 8 all day long without issue and it works in Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 so if this type of cat and mouse game is not your style, try my suggestion. Also, not much has changed since 8.0 so you'll get most of 9.0's features."
[T],grimreaper420,2010-02-11T23:17Z,"Differences between Nero 9 over Nero 8 
not much has changed u say?
Windows 7 ready
import your PowerPoint presentations and convert to DVD-Video or BD for TV playback
Easy Auto Backup Functions
In the music and audio area, it has many new features?
*Play AVCHD, AVC h.264, AVCREC, Matroska, Flash Video , MPEG 2, MPEG4, DivX, Xvid, etc
*Limited functionality on nero 8

Advanced bluray, dvd and video creation/editing/authoring over nero 8 

ioniancat21 ?Nero is calling home through another module???

I doubt that very much.

As for the batch script, not too efficient in blocking.

 ?cat and mouse game?? meowwwww lol"
,ioniancat21,2010-02-12T15:10Z,"I just reinstalled Nero again for testing purposes to attempt to get Showtime working. I used the Cleantool to uninstall as I did before and after reboot manually searched for any Nero folders before I restarted the install. As a furthur precaution, I kept the computer disconnected from and network resources physically by unplugging the network line so Firewall settings and connecting to the internet cannot be a concern or factor if it fails.

Sadly, after reinstalling, Showtime still asks for activation. What's funny is that the computer still hasn't been plugged back into the network, therefore we can conclude that the Nero Cleantool doesn't exactly clean all Nero setting from your PC and is therefore useless in some cases. My opinion as to why this is occuring is due to the fact that Showtime in particular uses 3rd-party DVD and BlueRay codecs and it is there that the problem lies whereas Nero Vision does work, along with the other applications because those same codecs are not needed to create media, only to play it."
,ioniancat21,2010-02-12T15:37Z,"I also believe that once Nero gets through and calls home once, it's game over for you forever, unless you can figure out exactly where Nero writes information within the registry that the Cleantool doesn't erase. What I'll do when I get time is to again reinstall Nero using one of those uninstall programs that can log the Nero installation and give me a report of all the areas that Nero writes to, then use the Cleantool and finally compare the logs to the Cleantool's work to see what got missed.

Thanks for pointing out the features of Nero 9 Grim, however, I see it dfferently.....

Windows 7 ready - Nero 8 works flawless in W7

import your PowerPoint presentations and convert to DVD-Video or BD for TV playback-Is BlueRay blowing up like this?? - I don't think so. The technology is too expensive right now. As for Powerpoint, most wouldn't think Nero for this task. The corporate world usually doesn't purchase Nero, if anything they get Burning ROM as part of their OEM software packages as I did at work when my employers purchased 1000 HP PC's.

Easy Auto Backup Functions - disk images are better

In the music and audio area, it has many new features?
*Play AVCHD, AVC h.264, AVCREC, Matroska, Flash Video , MPEG 2, MPEG4, DivX, Xvid, etc - I usually use the Klite Codec pack for this as most do, not Showtime.

Advanced bluray, dvd and video creation/editing/authoring over nero 8 - people turn to Nero for simplicity, if I want advanced DVD creating features I'll turn to Adobe CS4

ioniancat21 ?Nero is calling home through another module??? I doubt that very much-You're right here, my network cable is unplugged
and Showtime still don't work.

As for the batch script, not too efficient in blocking - maybe, but it's the way you want to go. Packaging a .bat script that blocks all relevent Nero apps would be good for newbies.

All things said, thanks again for the help Grim. Since version 7 when Nero started this, their activation has been a thorn in many a filesharer's behind and the work you're doing is positive as I had tested earlier cracks and they either rendered Nero useless or didn't work. To not have Showtime perfect is not a big deal so thumbs up!!!! The most important thing to remember is that it's users like yourself that solve problems through persistance."

I just dont know if it will work for this program in place of the firewall step you add the nero server addresses to your host file would this work for nero 9.4.26.0

@RightNote posting serial numbers is a great way for Nero to blacklist so don't using these now, create new ones."

Yes I had the same problem. I had to turn off Kaspersky (with fingers crossed) to get it to run. But it ran fine.

thanks a lot reaper. followed your instructions and it worked like a charm. i find it funny that ive been using windows and downloading warez and torrents for about 10 years and after about 2 years i stopped using any kind of Anti Virus programs and have since only relied on the KNOWLEDGE i have gained from experience of fucking around on the interwebz for SO long that ive only gotten about 2-3 viruses since then. i mean can you imagine that? in about 2 years i knew that almost ALL keygens and cracks are identified by Anti Virus programs as a back door program...........BECAUSE THATS WHAT THEYRE DESIGNED TO DO? idk ADSPON but it seems MORE likely that you anti virus was the one to fuck up your comp. you know, maybe to justify its ""discovery of this malicious program""? either that or your just a dumbass.... take your pick.

,chemhack,2010-02-28T14:46Z,"Thanks for this great upload grimreaper420. In Nero express 8 there was an option in the last step when burning avi files that said: ?increase compatibility of mpeg-4 video files ('divx') with mpeg-4 compliant dvd players? that I always used. In this version, this option doesn´t appear and I badly need this. Can somebody please tell me what is needed for this option to be shown?"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-02-28T16:52Z,"I hope i can answer this correctly (chemhack), but when i want to burn DivX or .AVI i open up Nero 9, pick data burning, pick speed, and burn away.
It's playable with any DVD player that can read DivX or .AVI format:)
Remember a CD has a max capacity of 700MB, DVD 4.7GB, DVD DL 8.5GB, BD-R 25GB, and BD-R DL 50GB."

My dvd player is divx capable but problems like green clouds showing and random restarting movie were all gone only when Nero implemented (increase compatibility of mpeg-4 video files ('divx') with mpeg-4 compliant dvd players) option. The manual for this new version (like the previous one) says that if you are burning avi files in data mode, this option should appear but it doesn´t. I´m trying not to go back to Nero 8 (version 8.2.3.0) to avoid possible installation problems, since I have this new version."

This even though I blocked each and every .exe file that was requested to block.  I think what happened though was that the first uninstall was not complete.  I did the entire wipe via Nero CleanTool this afternoon.  Will try it once more.

Basic question:  In instructions you give (#4), you say to 
""start with Nero 9 ...generate
Nero 9 activation ...generate
Add each one to (add to white list)""

do you mean that we should generate codes for EVERY subprogram?  All of them would let you do that, but some don't let you add them to white list (like the Nero activation).  Can you clarify this step?  Thanks."

What I did was extract the keygen to a folder, open the folder, then right click on the keygen per the instructions and choose Run as Admin. That's when I get the ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.""

And yes, all of this has been done while completely offline. As soon as the torrent finished I disconnected my ethernet cable and haven't reconnected since.

If you have any tips I'm all ears, but at this point I'm about to uninstall and give up. Thanks."

Are you running the computer as the Admin (which is the proper way)? not as a guest"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-03-02T11:07Z,"@brownstem
go offline, completely disable your anti-virus, make sure you are the Admin of the computer, right-click keygen go to properties go to compatibility tab click below Privilege level (run this program as an administrator) apply, and close...  right-click again on keygen run as Admin, and it should work...

,TimothyLeary,2010-03-02T19:16Z,"GrimReaper,
Thanks very much for posting the updated instructions for step 4 - I do now understand about doing this for each and every app.  The part I am still not quite clear on though:
Do you have to hit ""generate"" each time you move to a different feature or app?  Or is it sufficient just to do ""generate"" once at the very beginning.  Also, some of the apps, Activation (Nero 9) being one, does not have the choice lit up for adding to white list.  Some of the other features you cannot add either.  I would say roughly 2/3 of them can be added."
,borderedcountry,2010-03-02T21:22Z,"Wait I have a few questions.
1.  On step 4, do we check or uncheck the nero HD option?

2.  Do we HAVE to generate the serial for each app then their specific activation or can we just go from top to bottom generating all the serials for the apps THEN all the activation serials for the apps?"
,borderedcountry,2010-03-02T21:34Z,I followed all the directions carefully and when I start Nero it treats it af it is the trial version.  In control panel it shows several Neros installed and one called Nero Trial.  What should I do?

,brownstem,2010-03-03T01:23Z,"@grimreaper420...thanks, but as I said the computer in question has been offline since the download and still hasn't been reconnected to the internet. Windows 7, 64-bit. I am the administrator and logged in as such. As I also said I tried the tip you just gave me about privilege level...it didn't work. I'm completely stumped. Thanks anyway, I guess Nero isn't the answer on this particular machine!"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-03-03T04:30Z,"@TimothyLeary
Once you start with Nero 9.0 (scroll right up) it automatically generates serial (add to white list), scroll next to Nero 9.0 Activation, you will see a different serial is generated (add to white list), and so on....
@borderedcountry leave HD option UN checked+several nero's installed? delete all of them, use Nero uninstall utility, reboot, re-install OFFLINE ONCE

I press OK. The extracted file (in exe format dissapears). Hence, could not proceed with the subsequent steps.. 

Secondly, using Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 and the Firewall is active under KIS2010. How do I block the required files in KIS2010.

,shawn338,2010-03-03T21:45Z,gbaban:  One more thing...you will have to pause protection on Kaspersky 2010 while you run the Keygen because it does not like it at all.  Resume protection as soon as you are done. 
,TimothyLeary,2010-03-04T01:11Z,"Grim Reaper,
Got it and now everything works.  The hangup was that for some of the apps on the keygen, there isn't the ""Add to Whitelist"" option.  Instead, it's ""Register Serial"".  That was what I hit for those apps that didn't give me the ""Add to Whitelist"" option.  Activation (Nero 9) was an example.  Now, everything works.  The problem was that I didn't do ""Register Serial"" for the Activation (Nero 9).  I know you've done this many times, but might want to update instruction 4 to include this.

Many many thanks GrimReaper...

,brownstem,2010-03-04T09:28Z,"@grimreaper420...ok, let me please ask you one more thing. Is there any chance that my problem could be do to not downloading the keygen from the machine I'm trying to install on? I downloaded on my Vista box using uTorrent, then moved the entire download to the share folder of my friend's new Windows 7 machine. The only thing I can imagine is that even though I'm logged in as Admin it won't let me open the .exe because it didn't originate on that box and somehow Windows 7 ""knows"" that? I'm just fishing, but right now I'm totally stumped. Thx."
[T],grimreaper420,2010-03-04T10:19Z,"@brownstem let's say you downloaded it, moved it over via USB, or burned it on a blank CD-R and used it on another machine, it wouldn't matter.
Can I suggest a few things, yeah it may sound strange but did you install the latest Adobe Flash player (10.0.45.2) and Java (6 update 18)?
Just download the keygen again, right click run as admin, and honestly it has to work.
I never had anyone have such difficulty opening up the Nero 9 keygen...
It's like when I see my fellow pirates dl my torrent and install using my instructions, that puts a smile on my face.
I really hope you got it working one day.
Ciao:)"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-03-04T10:22Z,and dis-able your anti-virus in the meantime too while your offline.
,brownstem,2010-03-04T10:25Z,"@grimreaper420...well, something must have gone wrong with my original torrent download or something. Yeah, I tried moving the keygen from the download machine to the new one using a flash drive and got the same problem. So...just downloaded the torrent again (just the keygen) on the new Windows 7 machine and NOW it opens when I right click and Run as Admin!!!

So now my next issue. I start to follow the keygen instrux:

Nero 9.0 ...Add to white list
Activation (Nero 9.0) ...Add to white list 

The first one works fine, but when I highlight ""Activation (Nero 9.0) in the dropdown menu the ""Add to white list"" choice is no longer there. My choices are:

Left column: License Manager, Reset White List, Re-detect Nero

Right column: Generate, Register Serial, Information

No Add to white list

I don't want to screw up, so what should I do? Thanks. (And yes, I'm disconnected from the internet again and did so before starting the keygen)."
,brownstem,2010-03-04T10:29Z,"And BTW, the same thing happens for Activation (GraceNote Plug-in). When I had the problem with Activation (Nero 9.0) I went on to Gracenote Plug-in. I successfully added it to the white list, but now Activation (GraceNote Plug-in) doesn't give me Add to whitelist as an option, the same problem as with Activation (Nero 9.0). Thanks."

Good luck!"
,brownstem,2010-03-04T11:24Z,"@grimreaper420...Got it going, finally. As TimothyLeary pointed out above the only problem with your instructions is that not all the option in the keygen offer the ""Add to white list"" button (at least not in Windows 7). Some (more than half, actually) have ""Register Serial"" instead. The only reason I got held up after getting the keygen open is because of this inaccuracy in the instructions. Thanks for a great torrent and instructions (and the help), but please update the small bit of misinformation in Step 4...if that part had been accurate I wouldn't have posted my last round of questions in the first place.

if though my instructions may seem a bit much for some, it's either that, or a poorly run Nero 9.
I didn't just know this, i practiced until i figured it out, and then some till i saw perfection.
Now it's just way too easy to install&tweak this.

,Quantum12,2010-03-04T19:01Z,"For centuries now, people have been indoctrinated into the notion that competition is BENEFICIAL to the species. It's insane.

People actually believe that working against each other is the best thing for humanity. They are brainwashed into thinking that fighting for the same small portion of resources passed down from the top of the pyramid is the smartest thing to do.

How much longer will people be this stupid? When will they learn that the entire purpose of dividing us is precisely so that we can never rise to facilitate change? There is no trust because everyone wants the same jobs, the same resources and the same small percentage of wealth. Over 95 percent of the world?s wealth is owned by less than 1 percent of the population.

The answer to fighting crime isn?t to put more police on the streets. Crime can only be defeated by removing the inequality that gives people the incentive to commit it in the first place. Politicians know this but are trapped in the system just like everybody else. Political success requires massive amounts of funding to be pumped into campaigns and advertising. I assure you that the poor don?t pay for this.

When will people learn who their enemies are?

Did slavery end, or did it just evolve into something more nefarious and cunning?

I say wake the fuck up. It starts with you, America. Evil happens when good men do nothing. Capitalism must end or the human race will not survive.

P.S. There are three things you can do to help.

1) The system isolates people from one another by giving them conflicting interests from their competition. The way it hides this is by uniting the people in hatred of something else.

Unity is everything provided we face the right enemy. Tell people who the enemy is. They will not believe you, so be patient and persist. Do not let ignorance destroy us.

2) Do not have anything to do with the military.

The military takes orders from the government, but the government takes orders from the banking industry. War is about profit because the system is a business and not a charity. The best way to convince men to fight is to make them want to fight. Think about it. 

Don?t fall for the jingoism bullshit. There are no great pieces of land, just great people.

3) Know your enemy.

The system that lets most people suffer in poverty and a few to wallow in self-indulgence because of bloodline or blind luck is the enemy. This is the same system the Romans used, and will end in the same way. The greed of a few is holding back evolution for the rest.

The heart of the enemy is the banking industry. The banking industry perpetuates debt and most horrifyingly of all, it keeps people static. It weighs them down with car loans, mortgages, personal finance, stock options, credit cards, overdrafts etc..... The point is to keep you in permanent debt, and therefore an employee of the bank until you die. Everybody works for the banks: the only difference lies between those that know it and those that don?t.

Strike the heart."

When you manage to successfully run the keygen whitedevil326, go to license manager, open it up you will see all, or partial serials generated, highlight all serials, DELETE ALL.
Start fresh, follow my instructions, and re-install properly OFFLINE, in no rush, take your time.

,shawn338,2010-03-09T19:36Z,"@neil_2010:  first make sure you have started the Keygen by right clicking and selecting Run As Administrator. Follow the instructions in Step 4...you should see Nero 9 in the Product Box, make sure the only box checked on the Keygen is the top one; Auto Register Serial When I press ""add to white list""
Click on Add to White List - you should see an output below saying something to the effect that the serial was successfully added - if it says couldn't add serial or serial already exists that means you are not running the Keygen with Administrator privileges.
Choose each Product one by one in the dropdown and repeat. For some of the products the Add to White List button is replaced with Register Serial so click on it. 
Clicking on the License Manager button when done will show that you have serials for each product. Just close the Keygen when done. Don't forget blocking all the exe's in your Firewall."
,sandpanda,2010-03-09T22:17Z,"Keygen- I got to this part and it didn't generate a valid #.  I read here that was because I wasn't running as administrator.

Do I have to right click on the Nero 9 folder to run as administrator, anybody? "
,dhaxxx,2010-03-09T23:02Z,"@shawn338 or grimreaper420 or anyone who could help: I'm having problems installing even the trial. I am able to go through the whole process but I dont think that it is the right installation process.. Sounds weird but hopefully by looking at the screenshots, you would probably know what I am talking about...

1. This is when I started installation (did you notice it's blank, i mean, even the space requirement says 0.0kb):
[IMG]http://i926.photobucket.com/albums/ad105/dhaxxx/Untitled-1.jpg[/IMG]

2. This is when, the installation requires something that needs to be installed first before proceeding with the whole installation:
[IMG]http://i926.photobucket.com/albums/ad105/dhaxxx/Untitled2.jpg[/IMG]

3. And then this... and after that's it... I tried doing it again but I keep on going back to do it all over again
[IMG]http://i926.photobucket.com/albums/ad105/dhaxxx/Untitled3.jpg[/IMG]

I tried uninstalling nero components and deleting anything related to nero on my system. I also cleaned my temp folder and unwanted registries.. One thing I havent tried though is to delete the main nero registry if it is located somewhere...Hope you can provide some advice. Thanks a bunch!!!"

,dhaxxx,2010-03-10T07:29Z,"@shawn338: I downloaded the trial version on the nero website and that was the one I installed. After extraction, that is the one that is showing up... "
,bluraykid,2010-03-10T17:52Z,you may have dl from nero but ur doin it wrong man i wish grim was back here
,shawn338,2010-03-11T07:24Z,"@dhaxxx: OK here goes step by step. First I'd recommend using the Nero General Clean Tool just to be sure although it may not find anything to delete from what you've said.
- I downloaded the Trial from Nero and tried it as well but it seems identical to the one in Grim's upload - both say Nero 9 Trial...I am installing on another machine (XP) while I record these steps.
- disconnect from Internet
- run the exe and it will begin extracting files
- window opens that has Nero 9 Trial - Installation at top left as opposed to what your screen shot showed
- choose language and click Next
- uncheck Make Ask my browser...
- uncheck Set my home page...
- then uncheck I accept the terms... then Next
- leave default serial number there and click Next
- check I accept the License Conditions then Next
- then choose Typical or Custom where you can choose not to install some components (I'm going with Typical)
- click on Install on the Prerequisites screen (Nero Product Patcher and maybe more apps show on the list) click Next once all are installed
- get a coffee, have a drink, whatever...
- click Next without checking the Yes, I want to help... box
- should see ""Installation Successful"" click Exit
- now we're at Step 4 - disable anti-virus and extract Nero9Keygen
- once extracted, Right Click on Keygen and select Run as... (in Windows 7 you will have the option Run as Administrator
- Click on Run if that option comes up or if the Run As window opens the click on ""the following user"" radio button then select Administrator and enter the Administrator password and click OK (you may have to set the Administrator password for this to work)
- Keygen opens and you should see Nero 9 , Retail Single, and a serial - only box checked should be ""Auto register serial when...""
- click on Add to White List - you should see output below stating that ""the displayed serial has been successfully added...""
- choose next product from drop down (a new serial is automatically generated) - click on Add to White List
- repeat for every product in the drop down list (NOTE: some products don't have the Add to White List button but rather a Register Serial button...click on whichever one is there)
- when done with the list click on License Manager and you should see all the Products and their serials listed
- close the Keygen
- delete NeroPatentActivation.exe,  NOSProductRegistration.dll,
NOSUsageStatistics.dll, and NOSMyNeroRegistration.dll  as outlined in Step 5.
- now we're at step 6 and it's time to Block Each and Every Nero Application with your Firewall
- I'm using Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 but if you're using Windows Firewall or something else there's all kinds of info earlier in the comments or ""google it""
- I open KIS 2010 and click on My Security Zone, Settings, then Firewall, then Settings again
- on the Filtering Rules tab, for every Application that has Nero in the name or the path, select it then click on Add (bottom left)
- the Network rule box opens, click on Block, then select Web Browsing, then click OK
- again repeat for any apps in the list that have Nero in the name or in the path for the application... in this Windows XP install I only had one Nero App to block; Nero BackItUp (NBSERVICE.EXE)
- when done click OK on the Firewall window, and OK on the Settings window
- once you are done blocking Nero apps in whatever Firewall you are using, reboot and enjoy Nero
- hope this might help any who have been having problems but you really shouldn't be having problems if you follow Grims instructions TO THE LETTER!"
,shawn338,2010-03-11T07:34Z,"Another note regarding blocking Nero apps in Kaspersky firewall. When I installed on Windows 7 machines, all the Nero apps were listed in the firewall. On this XP machine the rest of the apps only show up in the firewall once I have opened them in Nero, for example Nero Vision...I then went back into the firewall and blocked it. Repeated for all Nero apps."

,shawn338,2010-03-11T15:57Z,"@neil_2010: I think the following is what you need to do but my familiarity with Windows Firewall is limited as I don't use it. Maybe someone more knowledgeable can confirm or correct...
- go to Control Panel > Windows Firewall
- go to Exceptions tab
- uncheck any Nero Apps
- all of the Nero Apps that Grim lists in Step 6 need to be on the list and UNCHECKED
- for any that aren't there for example NeroVision.exe click on Add Program
- then Browse and find Program Files > Nero > Nero 9 > NeroVision > NeroVision.exe
- select it, click Open, and it's now on the Exception list
- UNCHECK it!
- repeat for all Nero Apps listed in Step 6
- above was done in Windows XP; looks like some subtle differences in Windows 7, but very similar
Hope this helps. "

When I try to add products to whitelist it says error.. serial doesn't exist.  Don't know what to do at this point? "

,shawn338,2010-03-12T19:03Z,"@sandpanda: I've never used Vista but I found this:
By using the Run as Administrator option you can allow this application to run once without the need for full administrator privileges.

1/ Locate the applications icon or short cut and Right click on it.

2/ From the Drop Down Menu select the Run As Administrator option.

3/ Now click the application icon or short cut and it should run.

4/ When the User Account Control (UAC) message appears enter the appropriate credentials if you are logged on as a standard user, and click the Submit button.

5/ If you are the Administrator and UAC is not configured to always require credentials, just Click the Continue button and the application should start.
........Based on that you should have the option to Run as Administrator when you right click.
The ""serial doesn't exist"" error happens because you are running the Keygen without Admin privileges."

is it ONLY those programs listed which need to be blocked? (ex: I installed Nero StartSmart, do I then need to block NMDllHost.exe as well?) I assumed the only programs which needed to be blocked were the ones listed above.

do I need to create just Inbound rules, or just Outbound rules, or both? I went through every .exe and created Inbound and Outbound rules for them all, which was about as fun as playing World of Warcraft with a Ele Shaman.

Present company included.  i.e. simply clicking on keygen in (winrar) doesn't allow you to run keygen as admin.  You have to extract it to a location and open it as admin there.  Then I found that when I added items to the whitelist, the last 5 items caused the whitelist button to turn into a register serial button.  This might have happened because I have Nero 7 already installed?  Also if you screw up, registry cleaner from Nero is needed.  By the way as I write this I'm listening to The Beatles remastered, which is recorded as a FLAC file that Nero 9 can play but Nero 7 can't, which started my journey here.  It was worth it, peace."

,shawn338,2010-03-20T05:26Z,@sandpanda: I'll jump in here for Grim if I can...you must not have deleted all FOUR files as mentioned in Step 5 and/or you must not have blocked all exe's as outlined in Step 6. Not sure if you can be successful going back and doing so after the fact...I'd recommend a total uninstall with the Nero General Clean Tool and starting over.

Keygens are CRACKs and so show up as viruses.

Since many keygens are infected (layers of security here), create a non-admin account and run the keygen there. When done, delete the account.

Or get a sandbox/vmware or the free Sun Microsystems' virtual machine.

If you follow these instructions AS THEY ARE WRITTEN, you will have a FULL working copy of Nero 9. If this does not install and activate (with add-ins), then YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG.
If you have done something wrong, erase everything you have done, clear your registry of ANY instances of Nero, and start again from  the beginning making sure you follow each step correctly. Do NOT waste valuable posting space with your whining about how it doesn't work properly, or my all-time-fucking-favorite...""There's a Trojan in the keygen!"". Earth to NEWBS...keygens almost ALWAYS throw false positives for trojans and virus-like behavior.

Don't EVEN pay attention to these ""instructions"" as they are completely redundant.

Just install the thing whether you're online still, or not... whether you're running other programs at the same time, or not (with your specific PC's capabilities in mind, off course).

Then run the keygen and choose ""Activation (Nero 9.0)"" to get a correct serial and PRESTO!

You might have to click the ""Register"" button in the keygen to get everyhting working perfectly. I set this up on two separate PC's and I had to do that on one of them, since Nero wouldn't actually start the ""Control Center 4"" app for entry of serial.

Windows said ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have the appropriate permission to access the item"".

So, I got this to work the first time around but I recently had to re-install Nero (due to other problems) and can't get it working again. I've uninstalled, used the CleanTool, cleaned the registry (restarted a million times) but every single time I install, it tells me that my trial period is over and I need to enter a key... so I use Keygen to put in an activation key which works... but after the installation is done... I've got nothing. I can't find nero installed anywhere but I do find a Nero folder in x86. But that's it.

@TheJackof if unsure if serials generated or not click license manager 2 view serials.

I do put effort into what I do and nothing beats that feeling knowing that a complete stranger will pick my torrent(s), and if it works for them â€“ thatâ€™s the best feeling I can get.
I know my instructions are pretty detailed, but would you rather have a (Nero) torrent with very vague info, or follow mine, knowing that is really does work.
As for (some) people who may post that they found a virus â€“ you can go look elsewhere, I do not upload any viruses of any kind, and I certainly will not respond to noob comments.

As for the issue of â€œ""Your Trial period has expired"" you have to install this OFFLINE.

When are people going to read my instructions properly? If you get that even doing this offline just change your computer system date to Feb. 2010 (credit to HerrHara1d) - and re-install Nero.

@ PROTEOUS271158 youâ€™re crappola 
@ teevee you failed for not trying hard enough.
@Newb787  Nero isnâ€™t overkill lol I would def pick this over any other burning solution, I am really happy with Nero version 9.4.26.0 (or 9.4.39.0).I have also tried version 10, and to be honest it has its pros and cons( for example Nero Showtime is no more) it has been replaced by Nero 10 MediaHub now).

@ivorion you tell em bro!! A+ I donâ€™t even bother anymoreâ€¦guess they never heard of Google and/or false-+positives.

@3dsluver  ahh yes, that stupid Nero Third Party Patent Activation crapola = solution you didnâ€™t block Nero completely from accessing the net, or when you installed Nero, you didnâ€™t do it OFFLINE prior to starting the application(s). DO NOT download their Patent Activation softwareâ€¦.and make sure you deleted specific .dll files (re-read my instructions all the files you need to delete is there.)

This was WAY painful!  But I feel like I have a clue now so the next time should be smooth.  "

This is the first comment that I have put on piratebay. Thank you for the excellent download and detailed instructions. It is working perfect. Keep up the great work."
,Bugsy_B,2010-08-19T11:13Z,"Not sure why this doesn't work for me now...I initially had it installed and running months ago. Just did a complete system clean and proceeded to re-install everything I used to have before the clean. When I try to install this, I get this window during installation:

http://bayimg.com/FAoImaaCh
I followed the instructions TO THE LETTER (including setting my clock back to 02/01/2010)...my firewall was off and my internet was disconnected. 
When I closed this window, another one popped up that said ""Nero 9 succesfully installed"" with that comforting green checkmark plainly visible. 
????
I looked in my program files and Nero was NOT installed...ANYWHERE. I cleaned my registry and tried it again with the exact same results.
This is frustrating as I am not a noob and I did have it installed at one point and working swimmingly. 
Unless someone can come up with a workaround that REALLY works, I fear I'm going to be forced to re-download this and try again. Hopefully it won't come to that because I've logged some pretty substantial seeding ratios with this (had it since late Feb). "

Installed smoothly and works great!!
I did have to back-date the system, you might want to add that to the instructions. 
Thanks for what had to be a LOT of time getting this out for us!"

I don't understand the problem because I had this exact d/l running before. Now I have to find another copy that works for me.

the only solution that works is to back date (change the date) to something like Feb 1/2010 or earlier, then re-install.
note: fyi this was never an issue before..."

Works great.... 
I am running Windows 7 Home Premium
I did not have 2 block any of the applications from my firewall. after installing based on instructions and deleting said files i restarted computer, opened control center, unlock it then open the keygen again to generate a key. Copy and pasted in the box...it will come up not a valid key. Close the control center and in the keygen click add to white-list...open control center again the first thing on the list under license should now be nero9... all apps now working...this is how i got it to work...thanks for the sweet upload!!!!"

did u actually reinstall it or did u just copy the nero 9 folder to your new pc?"

,thadream101,2010-09-11T17:36Z,"@duty418

first off there is no  trojan in the installation file ur full of shit there...and second off most antiviruses will detect keygens as viruses just to try and get you to not use it...noob....ur face is duty.... u don't deserve to use this if u don't know the basics.... I just installed yesterday with no problems"
,BrItTaNyBaDaZz,2010-09-11T19:29Z,"for some reason when i download nero, it installs perfectly and then when i open it, it just shuts down my entire computer why is that? and it dos'nt say virus or trojan the shit works great @ the beginning wtf????"
,firechip,2010-09-12T03:17Z,I just copied.
[T],grimreaper420,2010-09-12T17:00Z,"@thadream101 anytime buddy...btw thanx for clarifying to some ppl that this keygen 
is NOT a virus, unfortunately it doesn't matter how many times I'll say it some ppl will
never learn, or listen.

@firechip copying the contents of all or part of a Nero folder will never work on a different
computer or same computer (even same hard drive/different partition)...you need to install Nero for this to work, not copy.

@BrItTaNyBaDaZz shuts down ur entire computer wow ehh? what hardware are you running? possibly recent overheating of cpu?

@duty418 ""Elvis has left the building"" lol byeeee"

no prob thank you for the program

i figured thats what you had done and will tell you the same thing as grim you have to reinstall the program because installing it makes other changes to your computer besides putting a nero 9 folder in your program files"

your heatsink on your processor could be clogged with dust causing it to overheat you may just want 2 clean/dust the inside of your pc...also bcuz you are running xp your computer could have a slow processor...like 2 slow to run this program maybe you should try nero 7...how big is your hard drive? how much actual space and how much free space?"
,TimothyLeary,2010-09-13T01:55Z,"I'm having trouble with Nero Vision (burning DVD's of material I've gotten off of BitTorrent, mostly AVI's).  When the process is near the end and the program starts to write the lead in, it crashes and the disc just stalls for a long time.  Then the disc ejects and the message, Nero Vision has Stopped Working error message comes up.  Any ideas??"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-09-13T18:03Z,"@BrItTaNyBaDaZz - you may as well buy an external 500gb/1tb hard drive cause if your internal hd doesn't have enough space it's going to crash sooner or later or another internal hd assuming you have the space... good luck:)

@TimothyLeary - when i burn .AVI's i just burn it/them as a data file why are you using Nero Vision for?
Remember if you use a DVD-R it's a one time burn, if you have a DVD-RW you can burn them, erase the disc and re-burn your .AVI's/DVD files or what I do is just move them to a USB stick to view.
Hope this helps you...good luck. "
,TimothyLeary,2010-09-14T01:52Z,"But why can't Nero Vision work?  It should, and it did when i first was using it.  Burned many movies.  but gradually, it started acting erratic.
Also, what do you mean by burning .avi's as a data file?  How do you do that?

thanks-"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-09-14T03:34Z,"@TimothyLeary Nero Vision does work...but for AVI files burn them as a data file if you see right at Nero StartSmart look over on your left side you will see data click on it and add your avi files, then pick media type CD or DVD even DVD DL.
Make sure the CD or DVD is finalized if not -RW ok"
,Stildar,2010-09-17T09:40Z,"Ok... Here's the thing... I will list my questions in order so you'll answer them more easily!!
1. Do you have to have a nero edition already installed? I have nero 6 which I can install...
2. When I run nero 9 installation it extracts, open the main installation form and as soon as I press ""next"" it says that this trial version has expired and has no trial key! So... this brings us to No.3
3. Usually at this point I open Keygen... But when I haven't installed anything when at Nero 9 it says at the serial ""nero is not installed!"" and I can't do a damn thing...
4. Even when I do all thos crazy things and, magicaly, install nero and all it's components it opens nero control center and says that it doesn't have authorization to open this, and buy now or insert the product key if I have any....

For the record, I've already installed it 5 times, and I'm 1000% sure I've deleted the right files and blocked every .exe file within my Nero 9 folder.... Do you think it's because first time I installed it I was online?? But after that I was offline each and every time... Anyway, I'll re-download it and see if anything changes... Any tips you could give me?? Thanks in prior...."
[T],grimreaper420,2010-09-17T17:13Z,"@Stildar if you look over step #2 this is why i highly recommended to do this offline the first time.
Use Nero general clean tool to get rid of any traces of Nero, use a registry cleaner, reboot.
Attempt re-install of Nero again (offline), and possibly change the date to an earlier time.
Fyi there's an updated ver 9.4.39.0  
Good luck:)
