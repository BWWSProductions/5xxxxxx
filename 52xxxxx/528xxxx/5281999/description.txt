KEYGEN NOTE(S): 
Check Auto register serial when I press "register" in case it's unchecked

Clicking License manager views serials generated
When finished generating serials, just close keygen

5.)*DELETE THE FOLLOWING* 
LOOK IN: 
(C:) Program Files(x86)>Common Files>Nero>AdvrCntr4 
NeroPatentActivation.exe this is obvious 
NOSProductRegistration.dll this is a Component for Product Registrations Services 
NOSUsageStatistics.dll this is a Component for Usage Statistics
LOOK IN:
(C:) Program Files(x86)>Nero>Nero ControlCenter4>OnlineServices
NOSMyNeroRegistration.dll is a component for Registration Services  

***DO NOT DELETE AdvrCtr4.dll*** 
AdvrCtr4.dll Control Module is an application extension IF DELETED it renders Nero 9 virtually useless.

6.) Manually BLOCK EACH AND EVERY Nero 9 APPLICATION with Windows Firewall, or if you use a third party firewall...for example:

I want to block Nero 9 (Nero Burning ROM) go to the firewall, and manually add, not from the actual (C:) drive, but from your firewall, when done, APPLY, and CLOSE (some firewalls are different when making such add/delete/modify changes)

LOOK IN (C:)>Program Files(x86)>Nero>Nero 9 
 
Nero StartSmart BLOCK .EXE
Nero ShowTime BLOCK .EXE
Nero DiscSpeed BLOCK .EXE
Nero DiscCopy Gadget blocking not required
Nero WaveEditor BLOCK .EXE
Nero SoundTrax BLOCK .EXE
Nero Recode BLOCK .EXE
Nero PhotoSnap BLOCK .EXE
Nero Burning ROM BLOCK .EXE
Nero Express BLOCK .EXE
Nero CoverDesigner BLOCK .EXE
Nero Vision BLOCK .EXE
Nero DriveSpeed BLOCK .EXE
Nero BurnRights BLOCK .EXE
Nero REscueAgent BLOCK .EXE
Nero InfoTool BLOCK .EXE
Nero PhotoSnap Viewer BLOCK BOTH PHOTOSNAP.EXE AND PHOTOSNAP VIEWER.EXE
Nero ControlCenter BLOCK .EXE

LOOK IN (C:)>Program Files(x86)>Nero>Nero ControlCenter4
BLOCK ncc.exe

LOOK IN (C:)>Program Files(x86)>Common Files>Nero>Nero BackItUp4
BLOCK NBCore.exe
BLOCK NBService.exe

If you have add-on(s) such as MoveIt, or BackItUp and Burn, you also need to BLOCK  .exe too...for example:

(C:)Program Files(x86)>Nero>Nero BackItUp & Burn>Nero BackItUp (.exe)

NOTE: Make sure you are only running ONE firewall, if not sure, check: Control Panel>System and Security>Windows Firewall
NOTE: there is a few .exe to block so please pay attention.

I hope this updated step regarding the blocking of .exe will help some people:)
There is also another option to block using the batch File posted on Page11 (courtesy of user trueblu8) 
 
7.) Reboot

8.)When your back on your computer, just double check all your steps, cause really, do you want to do this all over again? naaaa i didn't think so:)

NOTE: Check Control Panel>Programs>Programs and Features>should say Nero 9, not Nero 9 trial, but in case it does, no biggie, honestly.

9.) RE-ENABLE ANTI-VIRUS (AV) PROGRAM, then reconnect to the internet.

10.) Start Nero 9 FULL, and enjoy:) 

I decided to update and add more specific info to better help my fellow PirateBay users, so they enjoy using Nero 9 FULL, instead of scrolling for help in the comment section, but there's nothing wrong with that either:)

Q & A (when I am available Q & A is looked over periodically to add or update any changes) 

Q "How do I burn an .AVI or DivX file?"
A Start Nero 9, move your cursor to data burning, add file(s),name disc and burn. Insert CD/DVD disc in DVD player, and enjoy:)
NOTE: CD 700MB/DVD 4.7GB/DVD DL 8.5GB respectively, and DVD player must be compatible to playback .AVI/DivX format. 

Q "Are these instructions only for Windows 7"?
A No, my instructions works with Windows 7,Vista,and XP x32-bit/x64-bit

Q "How can i extract .rar file"?
A go to http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm pick applicable language, and choose (32bit or 64 bit), then install, or search this wonderful site, there's plenty. 

Q  "How do I know what serial was generated"? 
A Click License manager (shows products+serials)

Q "i got error message " error starting nero control center, can't load advrcntr4.dll "
A Nero needs that file (AdvrCtr4.dll Module) to operate 
If you deleted it (permanently), got some bad news for u, re-install Nero again.
DON'T DELETE AdvrCntr4.dll deleting AdvrCntr4.dll renders Nero virtually useless.
If you can find it in the Recycle, restore it.

Q "is this the full version"?
A YES (provided you honestly followed my instructions)

Q What if I'm still having problems?
A Keep trying, maybe you missed a step, or two, or ask someone who is familiar with Nero 9, but whatever you do, don't call Nero asking them for help....
