A small pack with Nintendo 64 roms and the best Nintendo 64 emulator - Project 64. A one file 7-Zip archive.You can unzip or unrar the files with Winrar or 7-Zip.

Installing :
- Unzip the files from the archive
- Install Project64
- Load a rom
- Play like mad

Note : The emulator needs good hardware to operate at full performance. So atleast a P4 with atleast 2 gigs of Ram and a up to date Vga card. If you have bad sound in game then turn of the sound from within the emulator. THis happends with older rigs.
