,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-01-16T16:56Z,"How do I switch to the console?
The game is always on top, no matter what I do, even Task Manager doesn't work"
,Isti01,2010-01-16T17:23Z,"omg this server hosting thing just sucks...
will there be a ""normal"" crack?"
,Isti01,2010-01-16T17:59Z,then if steam wants to get rid of pirates they only have to stop supporting older patches? Not good... :S
[V],Mbb15,2010-01-16T18:18Z,"@The.Genius.of.the.Hole 

Alt + Esc

or run game in window mode (r_fullscreen 0 in config_mp.cfg)

@lebles 

Youre right if all the legit players move to 1.0.176 we dont find any legit player more and thats good

@Isti01 

thats also true mayby legit people want to stay on older version but they cant because IW wants that all the players move to the most recent version so 'we pirates' cant play it online anymore"
[V],Mbb15,2010-01-16T18:27Z,OR IW will never update the game again :)
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-16T22:07Z,"after this long of cheating, and the fact that they cracked the colsole recently, says that even after they fix this crack for good, there will be another. i'm not buying cod at all, i have faith in the swash buckers :D"
