How to create server on v1.0.175
1. Join 3rd Person DM. 50% you will be selected as game host
2. Join the game and switch to the WinConsole (by Ctrl+Alt+Del) or run game in window mode (r_fullscreen 0 in config_mp.cfg)
Type in console
Code: Select all | Line number On/Off | Expand/Contract
sv_maxclients 18 
party_maxplayers 18
scr_dm_timelimit 1
map_restart

3. Wait 1 minute and you are in lobby with 18 slots. Join the game.
4. Now you are server with 18 slots, you can change
- active playlist: playlist 0 / 1 / ... / 16 // 13 - 3rd person dm, 0 - tdm, ... 
- map: map mp_blablabla; restart map: map_restart
- gametype: g_gametype dm / war / sab / sd / ctf / gtnw / oneflag / vip ...
- hardcore mode: g_hardcore 1 / 0
- kick players: kick Parovoz
- and more =)

Easier guide for getting host:

1. Join 3rd Person Cage Match playlist
2. Once you get into a game (and are host), enter the following commands in your console:
sv_maxclients 18
party_maxplayers 18
map mp_rust
3. Once you've loaded Rust, enter the following:
scr_dm_timelimit 1
4. The game will end in a minute, from there you should have a lobby with 18 available slots. The next step is to type:
playlist dm
5. This will switch the playlist over to Team Deathmatch. The first game will be a FFA, and all games after that will be TDM.

You can use these commands to change the gametype (NOTE: you MUST be in a game to do this, and you MUST replace <gametype> with the gametype, read dan2k5's post above me for them, additionally, you MUST replace <mapname> with the map name, you can find these in /Server/zone/english/. They all have "mp_" before them.):
g_gametype <gametype>
map <mapname>

Also, if you want to get rid of 3rd person, just do:
g_gametype <gametype>
scr_thirdperson 0
map <mapname>
