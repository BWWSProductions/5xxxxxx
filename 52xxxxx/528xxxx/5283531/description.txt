Work Done:

#
well we took the original vob files and encoded it from there.thanks to IMAGINE for the files.
#
this was one of the better screeners i have seen come around in a long time.just needed a
#
few touch ups.i thought it needed a little more saturation as everything looked a little bland.
#
cleaned up the file and sharpened it some more and adjusted luma gama ect.There are
#
occasional watermarks but not for long so we elected to just leave them.hope you all like.
