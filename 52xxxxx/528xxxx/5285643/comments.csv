,Deybacsi,2010-11-14T20:00Z,"If the installer quits, maybe you have HUNGARIAN regional settings. (Like me :))
I found this in install.htm:
""There is a known issue that will affect a small number of users, including those with Hungarian regional options, where the installer fails to start after prepartion of the InstallAware Wizard. To remedy this issue, open the Regional and Language Options in Control Panel and temporarily switch your Regional Options setting to English. After install, you can safely restore your regional setting.""

It worked :) All is OK :)"

Regarding the so-called virus...about a year ago I tracked down the author/company of the suspect file. This was the ""conversation"":

I was about to install my copy of Delphi Rad Sudio 2010 when I decided to do a virus scan. It reported the following file as being a Virus/Worm: > adolph\prodelphi_24_0_profiler_for_delphi\Prodel.zip\ProfNavi13.dll >
This file has a size of 308736 bytes and a file modified date of > 24/7/2009 16:51 > Would you please confirm for me whether this is a valid file. > -- > Regards, > XXXX XXXXXX

Hi XXX, that is a false alert, which I have discocered one week ago. If I compile the file, there is no virus. If I pack the file with ASPack, AVIRA virus scanner alerts. I do the same procedure for all other DLL's and this does not happen. If you download the newest version from my web server, you get the file uncompressed and without alert. By the way, which virus scanner do you use ? Kindest regards -XXXXXX
