	Paul Giamatti stars as himself, agonizing over his interpretation of "Uncle Vanya." 
	Paralyzed by anxiety, he stumbles upon a solution via a New Yorker article about a 
	high-tech company promising to alleviate suffering by extracting souls. Giamatti 
	enlists their service -- only to discover that his soul is the shape and size of a 
	chickpea. His intention is to reinstate it once he survives the performance but 
	complications ensue when a mysterious, soul-trafficking "mule" borrows Giamatti's 
	stored soul for an ambitious, but unfortunately talentless, Russian soap-opera 
	actress.
