The Steve Miller Band of the 90s has made a small impression with this irresistible package. Crammed full of great riffs and licks, tight playing and singing with enthusiasm. The title track together with the wry 'Little Miss Can't Be Wrong' ... Full Descriptionwere both hit singles in the wake of the excellent 'Two Princes', one of the few occasions where the cliche of rhyming 'baby' with 'maybe' was completely acceptable. Unpretentious rock music for the 90s and a memorable debut, that they could never come near again. 

Recorded at the Power Station & RPM Studios, New York; Acme Recording Studios, Mamaroneck, New York in August & December 1990. 

Producers include: Spin Doctors, Peter Denenberg, Frankie LaRocka
