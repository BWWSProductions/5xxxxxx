PEOPLE, DON'T DONWLOAD THIS SHIT!

If you have downloaded just a little (but complete) part of the movie, and you open it in you usual movie player, you will see that part of the movie. In this case, the movie initiate only with 19 seconds of the movie (I have downloaded 75,6% and half of movie is complete) and with the following text:

""Codec Error: Use Windows Media Player

Aborting Video, Redirecting to Microsoft Codec Download Page

Universal""

But I see my movies with BSPlayer...
