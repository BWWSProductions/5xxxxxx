Is it compressed?

Someone Please get back to me on this ASAP, because I don't want to be too late to download this again and end up with a discontinued version."
,slka,2010-01-17T20:30Z,"Alright guys, can't wait any longer, IT'S LEAP OF FAITH TIME!!!!

I'll get back to you guys, if my computer isn't infected

Best of luck to all who risk their computers for free stuff!"

,colt45joe,2010-02-20T04:51Z,"that really doesnt look safe.. its just one .exe file.. also, daemon tools pro definitely needs a crack/hack/loader of some sort, so a torrent would have more than one file..."

Problem is, you won't have a crack to use it after 20-day trial period.
Unless THIS installer also has built-in crack, there's no reason to download it via torrent."
