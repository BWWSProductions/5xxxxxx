The Matches newest album!
"Album 4, Unreleased; Graphics? Title? Or Not Needed?"

A very interesting title for an album! :P

I was SO surprised that I couldn't find a torrent for this album ANYWHERE. I was also very upset. So after about an hour or two, I randomly found it on some upload site. I would like to share it for all the other Matches fans!

The quality is surprisingly good!


/// All songs are above 250kbps ///


But it is (VBR). Im not exactly sure if thats a bad thing, but I've seen some people complain about it for some reason. It sounds great though! I promise! :)

It has all iTunes tags, and album art
