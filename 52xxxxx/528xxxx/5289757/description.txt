The Cars - Candy-O [HDCD] FLAC

In the late 70s and early 80s, The Cars enjoyed a string of US charting albums as they rode the wave of early synth-pop success.

They arrived at their name in 1976 after a few years of experimenting with names and line-ups. Having spent the winter of '76 honing their skills and setlist, they soon scored their first record contract and their debut album, The Cars, was released in 1977. Helped by singles including "My Best Friend's Girl", the album went platinum by the end of the year. They followed this with a Top 5 success, Candy-O, in 1979.
