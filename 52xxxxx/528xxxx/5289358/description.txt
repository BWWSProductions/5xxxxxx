    In the underground world of illegal street fighting, Bobby Delgado is    
    the undefeated champion, until he accidentally kills his opponent and    
    is sent to prison. Infuriated by the financial loss and death of his     
    prize fighter, promoter Jarvis Sweet swears vengeance on Delgado and     
    finds a new hitter in the form of Wade Bull, a vicious cold criminal     
    with fighting skills few men can match. With Delgado released from       
    prison, Sweet concocts a ruthless and backstabbing campaign aimed at     
    forcing the reluctant fighter back into the pit. What follows is a       
    brutal and bloody confrontation for survival.
