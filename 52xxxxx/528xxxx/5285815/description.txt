Product Description:
Tags allows you to manage all your files so that you can 
easily find the files that you need, when you need them.
Tag everything on your Mac: documents, emails, images 
and all other files. Quickly find files irrespective of where 
you saved them. You can bring up the Tag's UI with a 
simple keystroke in most applications, so that you can 
Tag files and search for Tags, wherever you are.

Tags are like keywords for files. Using tags allows you to 
group files which have something in common. You can 
apply many different Tags to a single file as well as apply 
the same Tag to multiple files. This allows you to 
associate files to one another in a way far superior to a 
rigid file / folder structure.
