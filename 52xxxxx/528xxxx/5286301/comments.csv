For anyone wondering, this is NTSC (thankfully). I ran it through PAL -> NTSC YFix Patcher and it didn't find anything to patch so that tells me it's already NTSC

thenoobish:
Could you upload ""NASCAR Dirt to Daytona""? I can't find that game aannnnyywhere..the only one here at TPB is bunk, no seeds (occasionally there is one, but never connects) even using magnet link with DHT, Local Peer Discovery, Peer Exchange and UDP all enabled.

Please, someone..anyone... ""NASCAR Dirt to Daytona""! :)"
