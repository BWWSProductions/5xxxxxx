We have previously thown in the rather rudimentary free player from Karaoke builder studio however it pales in comparison as a free offering to this one from Karafun.

They expect you to pay for a liecnce if you make us of it professionally, however it is freeware as downloaded for you here.

I hope it works well for you, we havent tested it throughly at thispoint, however so far it works better in some respects than expensive software we paid for when pickings were slim.

Includes variable tempo, and song "queue ahead " facility too.

Variable backround image to song lyrics - use your own standard!

By the way, we hope to soon have a modiefied version of bittorrebnt software that will allow us to always pump in idle bandwidth. Sometimes we are only using 2 percent of what we have available as a torrent wont take a seed even if we are the only ones on it - if the darned software says so. Where did you guys learn to program! We are seeding as many torrents as possible trying to use excess capacity at present.
