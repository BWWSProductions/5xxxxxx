Samplitude 11

Introduction
Samplitude is purely native PC software and therefore independent of proprietary audio hardware. Basically, that means the program works just as well on a laptop as on an audio workstation with dozens of inputs and outputs.
 
Even the standard version offers you everything you need for your productions: Up to 128 tracks and 64 busses at a sample rate of up to 384 kHz.
Samplitude provides all of the freedom you need to choose your own system. MME, ASIO*, and WDM support all important driver models.
