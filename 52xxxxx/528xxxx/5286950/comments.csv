,fedge81,2010-01-17T23:05Z,"Unsure if it works with chipped wiis. Tested on softmod and works 100% with USB Loader GX. 

This version has had some compatibility issues with burning I have been told. If someone does get this to work with their chipped wii, please let us know in the comments. Thanks and I hope you enjoy."

,fedge81,2010-01-18T09:35Z,"Not fuckin with you. Its scrubbed using WBFS Manager and rerared which compresses the empty space on the .iso until its unrared. the unrared size is 4,589,824 kb which is a normal Wii disc iso size. No need to download unrared or uncompressed isos again!"
