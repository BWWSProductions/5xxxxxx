Kid Rock's unique blend of Midwestern rock & roll, rap, and R&B gets another airing with COCKY, which features a plethora of road tunes, who's-the-baddest cuts, and straight-ahead drinking songs. The slow, greasy grooves of "You Never Met a ... Full DescriptionMotherf**cker Quite Like Me" contrast violently with the Detroit Rock City raunch of "I'm a Dog," which itself stands in stark contrast to the first half of "Midnight Train to Memphis," an atypical, steel guitar-accompanied ballad. 

You don't come to Kid Rock for subtlety (the last cut, WCSR, featuring Snoop Dogg, is proof of that). He's a Midwestern rapper who wishes he was in Lynyrd Skynrd--and who could probably make a pretty good job of it. The straight-ahead rock tunes swing mightily courtesy of drummer Stefanie Eulinberg, and Rock has his bad-ass rap act down cold here, though how much longer he can keep it up is another question for another time. 

Detroit's favorite son returns with the follow-up to the massive 'Devil Without A Cause' with the usual chicken-fried rock & redneck boogie. Guests include Sheryl Crow & Snoop Dogg. Features bonus track 'WCSR' (feat. Snoop Dogg) Altantic Records. 

Recorded at Clarkston Chophouse Studios, Detroit, Michigan.
