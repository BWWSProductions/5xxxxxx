IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

This time it's a nice quality cam video of the princess and the frog.....the source used was the german video, so thanks to them.

Now we were in the process of syncing this up using the demonz audio,but we noticed there was missing video in their release so we had to make a new audio track up using the german audio track as well as demonz.

Most of the german we used was for no speaking parts eg intro and end credits, but there was a part in the film itself which we have included in the sample so you can see.

Got to be honest and say we were given a dvdr off this guy who was doing the same as us, so to save time we used his synced audio and in our opinion he's done a good job :)

The video is really nice as well on this and just needed a few tweaks here and there........so enjoy.
