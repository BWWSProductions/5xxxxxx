,knockoffnigel2010,2010-01-17T01:47Z,"this does not work.......................... why upload torrent that does not work anymore, 1,0.175 is no longer supported"
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-17T02:08Z,@knockoffnigel2010: -.-' noob read the instructions inside
,k2pikachu,2010-01-17T02:13Z,"how long will it take for a good crack to come out, like the ones you previously uploaded that allows us to play with anyone?"
,knockoffnigel2010,2010-01-17T02:24Z,wont even find any games just like previously used versions
,Koustas,2010-01-17T02:36Z,"yea , im gettin pretty sick of this 3rd person gaming"
,defxtreme,2010-01-17T03:05Z,"Dont whine. If you like it, buy it."
,shinigam1,2010-01-17T03:50Z,"Well,if i understand correctly we must be 19lvl to get into 3rd person ???am so confused !it took me about 3 hours to fix the nat strict thing,and now i cant host cause of this?? i tried from private but noone came. can u explain with SIMPLE words what commands i need just to host a simple game pls ?:)"
,Shadow9111,2010-01-17T04:02Z,"Everything works fine except for changing the gametype. No matter how many times I enter it and no matter where (lobby or game) it won't change. I think the fact that once 18 players come in it's constantly preoccupied rejecting players might have something to do with it. I'll try changing maxplayers first next time.

Does anyone else know how to do it correctly?"
,Shadow9111,2010-01-17T04:03Z,I'll try changing gametype first next time*
,k2pikachu,2010-01-17T05:51Z,"Just curious, if I ever decide to actually buy the game (assuming we never get a crack that fixes the current problem or w.e), can I transfer my xp and all the stuff I earned to the new legit mw2? I have a feeling I can't, but I thought it might be worth the try to ask...

Thanks"
,BlackMoth,2010-01-17T07:10Z,Thanks 50. BIG UP
,pooranimator,2010-01-17T09:12Z,It keeps on getting disconnected from Steam after couple of mins of gameplay. Can anyone please help?
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-17T09:58Z,"@k2pikachu

when you buy the game, just enter the serial in steam, and it should just activate the game, i don't think you'll lose your xp :D i still find it fun to start over, i love callenging myself"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-17T10:08Z,"everybody should do that [ZeroGear] *Nickname* tag thing, 
you cant get kicked just for being recognized, it'll help us find eachother, and it'll be funny when we stumble on a legit server lol"
,OMG_BjA4,2010-01-17T10:43Z,"some points of instruction I dont understand
And some is inposible to do :("
,demson007,2010-01-17T14:29Z,"nice,thx works good,
but how about when the zero gear ööö out of order? we can play forward with this crack? thx"
,chaosjacky,2010-01-17T14:39Z,Putting the tag [ZeroGear]USERNAME would just be telling steam who cracked the game would'nt it ? Seems pretty risky to me
,Isti01,2010-01-17T15:59Z,"idk why I'm telling this cos it's in the instructions (what most of you ppl ignore): You NEED to host you server in order to play (THIS SUCKS), if not then you will be kicked by steam... it's possible to join a pirate-hosted server but it's kinda hard to find one :S waiting for a normal crack"
,Isti01,2010-01-17T16:05Z,oh and btw zero gear will be disabled today so we will be w/o crack and the demo method... steam rly wants to kill us lol
,k2pikachu,2010-01-17T17:30Z,"@HMVinyl

If I buy the game, won't it activate it under ""Modern Warfare 2"" instead of ""Zero Gear""? Do I have my xp and stuff saved under ""Zero Gear"" or ""MW2""?"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-17T17:47Z,"@pikachu

actually yeah your right it may, i dont know for sure, i bet your the first person to buy it after dl it :P "
,k2pikachu,2010-01-17T17:51Z,"@HMVinyl

Haha, maybe. I'll give it a week or two and see if we can crack/patch/fix (not sure of the terminology?) it. If not, I'll just go ahead and buy it.  I can't play third person all the time..."
,Andrath,2010-01-17T18:05Z,"il gioco funziona, solo che steam si disconnette dopo 30 secondi di gioco...suggerimenti?"
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-17T21:01Z,"c'è scritto nelle istruzioni, se ti colleghi a un host con gioco originale quello ti kikka, se ti colleghi a un host con gioco ctakkato quello funziona. fai priam ad avviare un tuo host, ci metti 10 secondi ed è già pieno subito"
,Andrath,2010-01-17T21:09Z,"ok...avevo provato ad avviare un host ma non si era connesso nessuno...riproverò

grz"
,dude17645,2010-01-17T22:28Z,"anyone else get ""disconnected from steam"" frequently?"
,elliot01,2010-01-17T23:30Z,"hy all tested very difficulte to find a game with out to be kicked .. but when you find it very good so thx  very much for 50c3nt  and all the people who help to make the crack !
@dude17645 yes it is because you are kicked , when you find a game wiht out to be kicked stay there and you will abable to play all the day if the host stay ^^
sorry for my bad english :S"
,speedfang,2010-01-17T23:42Z,"well zero gear is down and now there is no way i can connect , it just steam errors all the time"
,speedfang,2010-01-17T23:46Z,accounts with steam that no games paid for cant invite friends but i found a new way to invite friends
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-17T23:47Z,"@speedfang: no you can connect as before, the Zero Gear auto-became a Demo now, so it's same as 1 week ago"
,speedfang,2010-01-17T23:48Z,"you click the community tab then the groups tab the create a group lets say mw2 hack group, make that group public then tell people you trust to join that group(maybe people from a scene that you trust)"
,speedfang,2010-01-17T23:50Z,"because steam could ban even account in that group. 
When you start a game u can invite people to games from the group u are i and every1 who is in that group also"
,tryceo,2010-01-18T01:21Z,"Modern Warfare 2 is not gonna work anymore. As of 1/17/2010. Zero Gear is expired. So ya. If anyone want to change it to another demo that allows you to play just like the Zero Gear Demo, then please do so. None of the hacks for Zero Gear are working right now because you didn't buy Zero Gear and Steam checks you game key everytime you play online, so Steam Delphi Memory hack doesn't work either. Steam is still supporting 175 though, it's just that Zero Gear is expired. 
Hope this explains it. "
,k2pikachu,2010-01-18T02:43Z,"I was playing online in first person just a moment ago. 

After the game loads,

type in 
g_gametype dm/war/sab/sd/ctf/gtnw/oneflag depending on the type of match you want. hit enter.
then, type:
scr_thirdperson 0, hit enter
then type 
mp_mapname  (no caps, as in terminal or highrise)
then type map_restart.

Using this method, I can play first person in whatever mode I want, but I can only play one on ones...haven't figured out how to get more people to join (even after I changed the lobby to 18 people)"
,tryceo,2010-01-18T04:36Z,Everytime I join a game it says Disconnected from Steam.. Huh??? Anyone know how to fix this?
,qariboy,2010-01-18T08:52Z,"well I happened to find a good host. played some cod for 2 hours. 

""Im Number 1"" was the host"
,qariboy,2010-01-18T08:53Z,n I found a host after 4 or 5 kicks
,doradhorror,2010-01-18T09:33Z,Good stuff but it switches to another host and I get kicked ;__;
,qariboy,2010-01-18T10:57Z,there must be a way to join the same host everytime. 50c3nt or anyother might have an idea
,Drebin891,2010-01-18T13:47Z,per creare un host come si fa?
,tsimicx,2010-01-18T16:00Z,"when will new crack came????
please someone answer"
,k2pikachu,2010-01-18T16:08Z,"I can get to the part with 18 lobby slots and I can change the gametype, first/third person, and gamemap, but how do I get other people to join (when I'm hosting)?"
,speedfang,2010-01-18T16:55Z,"Hey guys i need help trying to get a working friends list so we can invite each other manually,
Make a new steam account then click the comunity tab sort your personal info out, log out, log back in and click comunity again. the search for a group called 'mw2 test' join that group, then we can ivite each other to games using the group tab on friends list"
,speedfang,2010-01-18T16:57Z,i wouldnt use ur existing account cos no doubt this page is tracked the all seeing eye :P
,speedfang,2010-01-18T17:09Z,sorry the group is mw2 test tpb go join that steam group and maybe we can connect and play by invites
,k2pikachu,2010-01-18T17:29Z,"Speedfang,

No offense or anything, but that seems like kind of a stupid idea. If we don't use our main accounts, we won't have any of our unlocked weapons/attachments. If we do, we'll most likely get banned by Steam."
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-18T19:35Z,"i'm trying many command to run a stable personal host. i have find it, and it's very easy but the only problem is the invite lol"
,Isti01,2010-01-18T19:45Z,to be honest this whole hosting-inviting thing is shit :S I hope there will be a normal crack for this
,bantu86,2010-01-18T22:38Z,KuriVaiM ??????????
,k2pikachu,2010-01-18T23:46Z,"lol, seriously. That doesn't work..."
,pooranimator,2010-01-19T02:36Z,"I know a better way...press the ""~"" key and type ""cod6plz_wrk.haxify"" and press enter. It will connect you through skynet instead of IWnet, its much better.  "
,speedfang,2010-01-19T04:39Z,"@k2picachu, yes it would be pretty dam shite get our main accounts banned but hey guess what now using that method i have a active friends on my list group by making a group and other none verified acc can join, im sure a working game but starting is ok while 50cent does his amazing work then hey we all play mains again"
[T],liluser,2010-01-19T12:33Z,cant his be updated to the new version 1.0.177
,qariboy,2010-01-19T13:14Z,"i dont know wot just happened 2day. I happened to join everytime. i was on level 38 and i went on some cracked server n I was on level 70 n unlocked everythin. this patch sum how worked for me. 

I m still able to join only on team death match."
,qariboy,2010-01-19T13:15Z,keep tryin u guys wud eventually jump to sum hack host.
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-19T16:31Z,"many players have upgraded to version 1.0.177 so until iw not stop support to 1.0.175, play! if you have connection to steam lost just retry, now you have many many more chance to join a cracked host"
,Isti01,2010-01-19T17:44Z,Seriously... who the fuck cares about the patch number as long as we can play online with cracked free mw2

,_ss_666,2010-01-21T18:00Z,Try applying this particular patch. Then go in ... Zero Gear/Server/ and simply run iw4mp. It sounds stupid but it works for me ... Havent even had to change that friends status to offline... Steam must be running.
