,dlarrym,2010-01-25T21:15Z,"raymondhome, if you got the audio off a screener, it would have had DOLBY DIGITAL and been at least 5 channel surround.... yours is 2 channel stereo.... a REAL screener will have a hard coded message explaining the nature of it being a screener for award evaluation or for critics reviewing purposes. Some even have message warning the person who had it originally that before the screener version was mailed to this person, The message said that that particular DVD had a unseen, digital ""watermark"" identifying who it was sent to and was responsible for the screener and if they let it out of there sight or let anyone copy any portion of it, they can tell from this digital ""watermark"". ANYWAY.... if you have the surround sound audio from a screener, can you post the audio file so I can remove the shitty audio and use the audio file with the surround sound in it... Thanks again."
