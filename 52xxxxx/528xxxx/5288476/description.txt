***NOTES***

Bit of info on previous dvdscr. the source used was an avi therfore had lost some quality  when i used it.

this is going to hopefully be sorted out for better releases. also just becuase a source doesnt look as crisp as a dvdscr could be , doesnt mean you know its a scr.  the overall quality was was like a dvdscr and even mr h didnt know what the source was. so dont bitch . I am always as honest as i can be to what i know the source is.

video
1.added colour
2.adjusted brigtness with a few filters

audio
1.used audio from scr
2.re sync'd to the r5
