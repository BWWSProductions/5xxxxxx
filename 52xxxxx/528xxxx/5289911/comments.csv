Did those iTunes info files help at all?  I've since been using Handbrake and selecting the total bitrate at 4500 kbps.  Been noticing a better quality in picture ever since, even when the source file is lower."

Thanks a bunch"

,weiser880,2010-01-19T14:28Z,"The size of the file should depend, in part, on the length of the movie.  I'm going to experiment with different length movies, and see what happens.

I never used to use Handbrake, as it only worked part of the time, but so far the newest version (released a couple of months ago) has worked with 100% of the source files."
