If you don't like TPB, why are you on it?"
,spaz92693,2010-01-22T07:58Z,"Just entered the serial number from the 1.7.3 torrent, worked great."
,espirates,2010-02-10T20:13Z,"The 1.7.3 serial does not work in 1.7.4, anyone find a current serial ?"
,espirates,2010-02-11T00:52Z,"My bad, it works on 1.7.4, I wasn't aware that for the keygen to work you have to use your computer username."
