,anacondon,2010-01-23T04:36Z,Just gotta ask.  Is this the one floating around with the 5 inch black borders (& resultant tiny actual picture) and annoying embedded clock on top of screen ticking down the minutes?  Saw it in the theater a YEAR ago and it's STUNNINGLY good but desperately want a good DVD quality copy.  No offense to the uploader but i'm utterly mystified a truly good copy not available yet.
