Early-period film noir with jingoist overtones.

I hate Alan Ladd as an actor, but some people certainly enjoy him. I always laugh when he smiles that beaver-grin way he does with his front teeth bucking out. Awful.

I especially like the part where Ladd tells Lake not to run, otherwise "they will know you're not a man." Nice line.  We also see a favorite film-noir setting, the railyard, used to good advantage. For another use of the railyard, see The Setup, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5248666/The_Setup_(1949_film_noir)

And is there something Fritz Lang-ish about the big set for the office?
