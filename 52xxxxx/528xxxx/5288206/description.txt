Additional Info Remastered 
Ted Nugent's self-titled 1975 debut solo release is a bold expression of gonzo guitarist's sound, image, and abundant attitude. Ted had what was essentially ... Full Descriptiona touring band with Amboy Dukes bassist Rob Grange, fellow Michiganite Derek St. Holmes on vocals and guitar, and Cliff Davies on drums. During days off from the mega-road trip that preceded this album, the group recorded its first record. Co-produced by famed hard-rock/metal helmsman Tom Werman, "Stranglehold" has the impromptu jamming feel of a live show. 

Like "Deuce" for Kiss, the first track of a first album can define an act. "Stranglehold" leads straight into the no-holds-barred "Stormtroopin'," where the riffs are non-stop. The boogieish "Hey Baby" shows why St. Holmes was an underrated, soulful hard-rock vocalist. He howls "got me an overdose of rock & roll" on "Just What the Doctor Ordered." A wicked metal lick introduces "Snakeskin Cowboys." Ted picks his mammoth Gibson Birdland to death on "Motor City Madhouse." He switches gears on the bluesy shuffle of "You Make Me Feel Right at Home." The bonus live tracks of "Stormtroopin'," "Just What the Doctor Ordered," and especially "Motor City Madhouse" show why any rock & roll fan should witness a Ted Nugent show. 

Recorded at the Sound Pit, Atlanta, Georgia. Includes liner notes by Gary Graff
