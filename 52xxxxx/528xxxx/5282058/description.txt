Description of game:
Heron: Steam Machine is not one of these remakes, but the basic concept is very similar. You're once again asked to connect a bunch of bending pipe pieces together to make one continuous line across the playing field, and you're once again racing against the clock to complete your work. The difference between Heron and the old Pipe Dream design, though, is that this time around the game area is already pre-filled with pipes. You don't choose where to put them -- they're already there. You just point at them and spin them, rotating them into proper position right where they are.
