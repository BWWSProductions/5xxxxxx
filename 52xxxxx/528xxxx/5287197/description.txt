'74 Jailbreak is an EP by Australian band AC/DC, comprising five hard rock/blues oriented tracks that had previously been released only in Australia. It was released in 1984 in the United States, Canada and Japan. The song "Jailbreak" was also released as a single and a video. The EP was reissued in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.

The first track is from the Australian version of Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (1976), while the rest are from the Australian version of the band's debut album, the Australian version of High Voltage, recorded in 1974 and released early the following year.
