,tgcleader,2010-02-20T07:21Z,im about to post a new torrent for the Megallen RoadMate 2010 version 1.2 which is the newest one. So keep a loom out for thatin a bit.
,tgcleader,2010-02-23T11:48Z,@rayad or who ever else is using a Mac or a PC for that matter. I have found another way you can do the resolution fix directly on your iphone no pc or mac required and its easier and the tutorial is on my new release of Magellan RoadMate 1.2 US & CAN and you guys can go here to get it: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5386880
