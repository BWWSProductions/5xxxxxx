This was the source [the only one available for me]: Jane.Eyre.DVD.{WwW[.]IbizaTorrent[.]Net}.  Blurry as you see !

And ...Yes: this is all I could get out of this .. dvd !!!

When I'll get another and better source you'll have another and better rip !

That's all I can promise!

Until than...enjoy this one ... if you can !!"

The quality is...more than watchable ! In some scenes  there are problems with details when characters are filmed from distance!!

Cheers."
