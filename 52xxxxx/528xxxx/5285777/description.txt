wanted to add in more modules, but all i own is a psp and an ipod 6g. if anyone wants me to add in more send me the specs. again, this was made for ME to use, and am including it here for anyone else who might find it useful. let me know if you have any issues with the torrent, because im not sure what i needed to put in. 

.net framework IS REQUIRED

this program converts videos to either psp, or ipod 6th gen format. it supports batch conversion, and thumbnail is made automatically for psp videos.

steps to use...


1. select video in the first text box
2. select output folder in the second

at this point the info will load up into the program, you can either manually choose how you want it converted or select from the 2 presets.

3. select conversion profile (ipod or psp)
4. select build settings, and if it looks right, 
5. select add to queue
6. repeat for each video (NOTE) ***even if the profile is STILL selected on your next video, youll have to reselect it to refresh the build settings)

once your done click START to begin conversion. 

i think thats it, again, if you have another profile for me let me know, ill add it in.

another note **note all video types work. but i think i got the major ones (AVI, MPEG, DIVX) you know... if you have an issue let me know
