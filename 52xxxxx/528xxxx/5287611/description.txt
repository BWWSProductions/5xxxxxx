From Wiki:


The Shamen were an experimental electronic music band, initially formed in Aberdeen, Scotland, by Colin Angus (born 24 August 1961), Derek McKenzie (born 27 February 1964), Keith McKenzie (born 30 August 1961) and Peter Stephenson (born 1 March 1962) in the 1980s as a psychedelic-influenced indie rock act. They found credibility as pioneers of rock/dance crossover, before moving on to international commercial success with "Ebeneezer Goode" and the Boss Drum 1992 album. [/quote]





Move Any Mountain (single) 1991


"Move Any Mountain" was a single performed by The Shamen. With a new radio remix by The Beatmasters, the song was released in the UK during the summer of 1991 and was their first top-ten single, reaching number three in the UK Singles Chart. It was the band's only top-40 hit in the U.S., where the song peaked at number 38 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[1] The promotional video was filmed on the slopes of Mount Teide, Tenerife island where Will Sinnott drowned and died. This happened on 23 May 1991.

In response to demand for remixes from fans,[2] the band released the entire sample list and a number of remixes on the album Progeny, which at the time meant the single and album release of the track made it the only record to chart on both UK Singles and Album Charts at the same time.[3]

It is held that Japanese video game music producer Yuzo Koshiro made a remixed instrumental rendition of "Move Any Mountain" for the base-ball Stadium stage in Streets Of Rage 2.
