[V],twentyforty,2010-01-18T19:08Z,"LOL, ""good looking"" and... ""replaced"". BTW, have you watched last year's ""Devil's Whore"" and ""Little Dorrit""? BBC and - excellent."
,htctouch,2010-01-18T19:15Z,i also wanna enquire abt the subtitles for ur release of sharlock holmes iv got many subtitles [ imagine ones n even flawless ones ] but none match to ur release .. so any idea frm whr i shud gt a sync for ur release sir ?
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-18T19:17Z,"@htctouch: Nope. I have many things announced to up - beside, TV season just started and I have never upped movies during the full season. Only one every week, and only very rare ones or hit-films.

Dearest htctouch, you already have a big one scheduled for this week - 606MB in Altman's ""Short Cuts"". I cannot keep with your demands."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-18T19:22Z,"@htctoch: Of course they cannot ""fit"". Read torrent description one more time, especially ""Input:"" part."
,htctouch,2010-01-18T19:22Z,"hehe no probs sir .. was just asking if they are in ur plan or not ..
thanx 4 replying ."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-18T19:47Z,"@lilar: I just wanna tell you this: Guy needed three hours for reply AND believe me, Internet is full of lunatics. ""Feeding the trolls"" we say for replying on their provocations. They usually go away, like ""gremlins"". Real Gremlins are different story. They are - cute,"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-18T19:51Z,"@htctouch: In case you wondering about, I referred to one nasty guy on different thread."
,lilars26,2010-01-18T20:10Z,"O.K. ""good looking"" and ""hot"" are not really interchangeable.re: gremlins..cute in the movies but very mischievous.re:trolls...I will no longer feed.Have a good one."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-18T20:19Z,"@lilars: Is Yes more ""precise"" answer? "
,lilars26,2010-01-18T20:48Z,"Thank you and about those BBC shows,I don't think they aired in Canada."
,SamsStar,2010-06-05T13:31Z,"Thank you for your Being Human downloads. I have seen all of series 2 because of you twentyforty, as it has not yet aired in Australia. I have just discovered the pilot episode and thought I would check it out. I appreciate all the work you do. Thankyou so much."
