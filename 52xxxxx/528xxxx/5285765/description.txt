There are 2 videos for this song: the UK version is the original version and was The Killers first video; due to the fact that the band were on an independent record label the video was done with a low budget and was consequently very basic. When they were signed by Island Records in the US the band decided to film a higher budget video: the American video for this song stars Flowers, Izabella Miko, and Eric Roberts in a love triangle, taking place within the context of a burlesque show. Directed by Sophie Muller, it was inspired by the 2001 film Moulin Rouge!.

The American version won a MTV VMA in 2004 for Best Rock Video.

This video is the American version.
