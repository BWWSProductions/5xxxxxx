So is this REAL or FAKE ?

And really the hell puts up a TV show split as RAR files. Do everyone a favor and just leave it as an AVI without breaking it up and repacking it. Get it together up loader."
,robbo19,2010-01-18T11:40Z,"All you have to do is look to see the uploader is a VIP,so that proves his uploads are real.
I dont care if the file is rarred or not it only takes less than a minute to unrar.You must be short on time mate.
Cheers TvTeam always trust your ups."
,lugosi13,2010-01-18T13:24Z,Thanks matey. :)
,indie69,2010-01-18T16:27Z,"It's not a short on time issue, it's sometimes a short on disk space issue for some people. Un-rar and delete the rars? No more SEEDEY. (and MANY people do this) But that's a big argument and I'd just like to focus on saying thanks to the uploader no matter how it's presented. +1"

,Docca,2010-01-19T11:09Z,Many thanks!
,derrique,2010-01-20T02:52Z,"yeah, i guess most folk don't have mega harddiscs so's they can afford to have double copies of everything to watch and reseed at the same time.
i know i don't so if i'm unpacking from rars i rarely seed as well.
in that case..., thanks for the upload anyway.. !
it's a good series... (-:
if anyone wants to download it in real HD and without rars go to....
http://www.uknova.com
