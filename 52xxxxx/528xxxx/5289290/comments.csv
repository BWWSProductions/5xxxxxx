,Franz_von_PPP,2010-01-19T13:34Z,I suppose the spoken language is Mandarin; but are there also subtitles...?
,Franz_von_PPP,2010-01-20T14:15Z,"Could someone please be so kind to tell us if this is in Mandarin, and if there are subtitles? Thank you so much."

I posted the nfo file in the torrent description , hope this helps :) ;)"
,Franz_von_PPP,2010-01-21T18:26Z,"To thenoobish:  thank you for your kind effort by answering me :)  
Too bad the original language has been replaced with English audio; now, I'll have to skip this :("
,robbyrne2,2010-01-22T02:05Z,This is mandarin audio only. Is there english subtitles to be had?? 
,w000ter,2010-01-26T02:56Z,so its english audio? or subs
,robbyrne2,2010-01-26T06:38Z,It's mandarin audio with no subs and can't find subs anywhere for 2 movies joined together. This is the 1 and 2 versions sp[liced together with no subs for either. Disaster - unless some subs get released of them - where are they!!!???
[T],thenoobish,2010-01-27T16:54Z,anybody tested the srt. file that comes with the download then?

,ozc,2010-06-21T01:08Z,"



The subtitles on the second half appear to be noticeably out of sync.

,shinobiung,2012-01-31T17:33Z,"This is the MANDARIN version, the SUBS ARE IN RUSSIAN ! !!"
,Junkee41,2012-05-27T02:59Z,"I downloaded the WiKi release of this movie elsewhere and it is excellent quality but to clear everything up...

The audio is in Mandarin and the English subtitles that jacq222 provided work fine and are in sync from start to finish using VLC.

Thanks =)"
