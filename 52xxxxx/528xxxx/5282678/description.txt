Batman: Gotham Nights
When Batman pursues a criminal into the Robinson Central railway terminal, six assorted people whose lives rarely intersect with his are present in the crowds. A doughnut seller, an elderly couple, two business people and a former convict all carry on their days barely affected by this, but their lives are set to converge in ways they couldn't possibly imagine.


Batman: Gotham Nights II
A ride on the Little Paris amusement park breaks and kills numerous people - when Commissioner Gordon and Batman investigate, the signs point towards sabotage.
