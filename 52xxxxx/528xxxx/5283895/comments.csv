,.Leto.,2010-01-20T12:55Z,"I didn't find it on TPB but Sherlock.Holmes.2009.DVDSCR.XviD.AC3-WHiiZz (2.18GiB) has much better picture quality. Colors of the Flawless release are not natural at all and the picture is more blocky.
So try the WhiiZz version if you can."
,Perspolice,2010-02-06T12:11Z,"i want to know which one has a better picture for download, WHiiZz Release or Flawl3ss Release :-?
please i need this confirmation... "
