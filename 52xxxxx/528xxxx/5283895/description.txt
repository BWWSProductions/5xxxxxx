Work Done:

well we took the original vob files and encoded it from there.thanks to IMAGINE for the files.

this was one of the better screeners i have seen come around in a long time.just needed a few touch ups.i thought it needed a little more saturation as everything looked a little bland.

cleaned up the file and sharpened it some more and adjusted luma gama ect. There are occasional watermarks but not for long so we elected to just leave them.

hope you all like. from team flawl3ss.
