,FragPL,2010-01-16T19:02Z,"Boooooring addon, has some nice items (Cailan's Armor and Armaments and Duncan's Sword + Dagger) and some powerfull enemy (troll),
but overall, it abuses the old maps from the original. Oh, and this is not-infected, 100% wroking."
,weakink,2010-01-16T19:24Z,"its telling me to ""failed to authenticate the disk. Please insert the correct disk and try again.""

help plzzz "
,jsnh,2010-01-22T07:50Z,How you get a DLC that has not been released yet? It's a tester release? cheesy...
,Brian1454,2010-01-23T01:24Z,"amazing 400kb/s!! on dial up!
anyways nice (i think?), where do i get the option to play this DLC?
anyone knows a good torrent for the golem DLC?"
,Convic,2010-01-28T22:07Z,"omg,
i already finished the game and playing my second time now.
i thought lets get the dlc return to ostagar.
well i did every thing right now it says ""failed to authenticate the disk. Please insert the correct disk and try again.""
just like weakink

pleas help me ppl i cant even play the normal game :("
,reefski,2010-02-02T20:52Z,@50c3nt: great job! but could you please update the DCL? If this DCL was uploaded on Jan 15 then it's the version that'd been pulled off by BioWare due to bugs. An updated Ostagar was re-released only now (Jan 31 or Feb 01).
,Neverwinterx,2010-02-03T15:09Z,I would also like to know if the newly re-released return to ostagar is different from the version here? If so i would prefer the new one.
,BlockMe,2010-02-12T21:05Z,"I would assume that up to this date, the newest version of Return to Ostagar hasn't been uploaded to any torrent yet. All these ones flying around are the one with Mage Skill bug. It will add the 2nd Drain Life skill slot to every mage skill tree."
,jangi,2010-02-17T21:45Z,"to all thats say ""failed to authenticate the disk. Please insert the correct disk and try again""

just download another crack ^^"
,M3rr,2010-02-28T06:55Z,"Just gonna say something about this DLC

The purpose of this DLC is to continue the Storyline , it's meant to be played in the middle of the game, in particular in between two separate quests , before the Final Battle. 

This DLC is important when it comes to continuity for The Awakening coming later this March. 

You may think it's boring but if you love this game enough to want to buy and play the second incarnation/expansion. This DLC is pivotal "
,Darktangent10,2010-03-21T00:01Z,"So this requires 1.02a, yet you didn't include it?"
,Jaasonnn,2010-04-28T08:25Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5154694/Dragon_Age_Origins_DLC.ShareReactor

I know that hasn't got Ostagar in it, but who cares!
It's still a kick ass upload.
Hope you find it useful"
,skeepa,2010-05-07T19:41Z,"Works perfectly. I enjoyed it, but it's too bad that it's so short."
