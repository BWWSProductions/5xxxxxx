,210015allan,2010-01-23T03:22Z,Sorry About that twistles. I changed the tags so i hope your happy. You're lucky i even bothered wasting my time doing this. If you have nothing good to say about my torrents don't say anything at all. Thanks Twistles. 
,twistles,2010-01-25T12:24Z,"It was potentially a case of accidental mistagging (I assumed you meant ""Classic"" rather than ""Classical"") : the ""Classical"" tag is widely used to index and find to find music of that genre, and your pair were at odds with most of the other stuff in the listing.  

So indeed, thankyou for bothering - it was far from wasted time.  I'm sure your torrents themselves are very good =)  

My apologies if you understood my comment as being anything other than constructive criticism."
,210015allan,2010-02-19T16:01Z,It's alright Twistles. I understand that your not trying to insult my torrents. It was a mistake and if fixed it. It's no big deal. I'm not mad at you. I still have to seed this more it's on 1 seed.
