[V],twentyforty,2010-01-18T11:03Z,"This specific swarm is infected. I see right now 43 gremlins, but I hope that people use PeerGuardians and 3rd party firewalls as I have advised for years (and know how to block IP ranges). You can recognize the gremlins by their specific, similar names and IP addresses.
It has been like this with ""24"" and ""Lost"".

I'll switch to uTP, forced Encryption and that's best I can, every each of you must clean his own path."
,TrueCaveat,2010-01-18T12:01Z,"@twentyforty: I'm not really sure what do you mean by gremlins! and why we should use PeerGuardians and 3rd party firewalls! Can you please link us to some websites that explain what do you mean.

thank you "
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-18T12:24Z,"@TrueCaveat: OK, let write down exact procedure, way to do it, spice all that with links and few tips. Not just that, but ring our gremlins and tell them what we are going to do.
Are you kidding me?
Google and visit networking forums, this not a right place - or stay away from P2P networking."
,Pothead808,2010-01-18T12:37Z,"Thanks so much man, you rawk!"
,TrueCaveat,2010-01-18T15:35Z,"@twentyforty: Exsqueeze me that I'm not a p2p nerd! I'll just skip yours and download another one, never had a problem, and never will.

btw: LooL at you, like your first post was in the right place."
,lilars26,2010-01-18T15:55Z,"@Truecaveat ... Lighten up,we have all asked dumb questions at one time or another."
,visujulz,2010-01-18T16:40Z,"It works brilliantly, glad it's not a fake."
,TrueCaveat,2010-01-18T19:26Z,"@lilars26: oh, I'm sorry if you find my questions was dumb!

So let me rephrase my questions!

Why the hell we need other programs to download your shit? are you special?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-18T19:30Z,"@TrueCaveat: I am devastated by your decision. By the way, you are not a nerd, for sure. Nerds usually have high IQ and sense for cynicism."
,lilars26,2010-01-19T01:27Z,Thanks 20/40.I wasn't going to do this one this year but changed my mind.I'll watch the 1st one and see how it goes.Thanks to all the seeders...fast download.
,TrueCaveat,2010-01-19T06:49Z,"yeah, I'm just glad I'm not a loser..watching the same tv series for 8 fucking years! don't you feel repetitive? well I guess a loser won't..

but wait, what about a super loser..watching countless tv shows and wasting time uploading them! god I love them.

btw: this is more fun than this 24 crap."
