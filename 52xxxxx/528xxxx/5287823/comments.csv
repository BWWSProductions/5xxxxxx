None of the portable versions available in the wild are developed by the ""manufaturer"" or developer.

Hope that clarifies.

I use it to work on a 3D render project at home, and show off my work without bringing any of the data and scripting algorythms to get stolen at the tradeshows. All I need to bring is a simple laptop with wifi internet access.

it's smaller because all the extra language libraries are stripped."
