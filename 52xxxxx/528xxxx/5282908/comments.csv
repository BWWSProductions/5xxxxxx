The version below has better video quality imho since double the bitrate...

I guess this is for those who prefer files that fit on 1 CD"

because this torrent was already uploaded somewhere else some time ago so it got a head start :)"
[V],Kuthumi,2010-01-16T09:39Z,Thank you! Sample has only mono sound.
,rippx,2010-01-17T02:53Z,"Audio - 10/10
Video - 10/10

Movie - 10/10

I never give any movie 10/10, not even the Godfather. This was one of the most disturbing movies EVER made. It contains actual footage of things you can not explain. It is hard to fight against REAL facts and cold hard evidence....it will make you a believer.

Don't watch it alone or you won't be able to walk around at night. "
,dardar6t9,2010-01-17T09:21Z,"To Raymondbone, Thanx 4 the upload....and I wouldn't even have responded to the Nabibio person who screamed ""fake""....if they dont understand how a torrent works they shouldn't comment. Again Thanx Mate :)"

sacrificed some of the quality by converting to .avi but worth it for the small download size...fairly quick also...plays fine on wmp and ps3"
,Amaximus,2010-01-22T19:22Z,"The movie is totally fictional the ""actual footage"" is shot for the movie - it's a hoax, just Google it - gullible Americans, lol"

,opifex,2010-02-02T17:20Z,"Be careful these torrents are monitored by ""Gold Circle Films"" so if you download you might get a cease and desist."
,random-critic,2010-02-03T10:38Z,"Thanks for the upload!!!!!

Keep in mind this storey is not entirely accurate and the extra footage is just part of the film.

However if you enjoy mystery or abduction movies this is the one for you. 

Watch in the dark with 2 non-skeptical people.
Deserves a 7/10 in the long run.

A/V = 9/9 on huge tv via PS3

Your ignorance is astounding.  Do all foreigners tout around the ""American"" card when someone does something stupid?
There is no way to tell where a user is from just from a comment, so quit with the obnoxious prejudice.."
