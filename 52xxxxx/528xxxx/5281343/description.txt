An enchanted innocent who loves children discovers he cannot be trusted in the modern world in this contemporary fable. Lise (Line Kruse) is a seven-year-old girl whose yuppie parents have little time to spend with her. Lonely and needing a grown-up role model, Lise conjures up an adult as an imaginary friend -- P (Nikolaj Lie Kaas), a big but warm-hearted man who hides behind the walls of her bedroom when grown-ups are around. Lise dies in an auto wreck, and P is forced to enter the real world and fend for himself. Strangers take pity of the guileless P, and he soon has a job and a place to live, and even strikes up a friendship with Lise's parents, who only now realize how much they loved the daughter they lost. But as one might expect, P has a soft spot for children, and when he strikes up friendships with a number of kids in the neighborhood, several people wonder if he's making improper advances towards his young acquaintances. Director Ake Sandgren filmed Et Rigtift Menneske using the strictly acetic boundaries of the Dogma 95 style.
