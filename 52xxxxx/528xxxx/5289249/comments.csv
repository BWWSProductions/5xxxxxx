,Foreveur,2010-01-19T00:46Z,Is this a PAL version?
,Hewlett,2010-01-19T01:01Z,"I sure hope not.
besides it's NTSC/J version patched so that shouldn't have changed: NTSC."
,virtual_boy,2010-01-19T11:35Z,"A dedicated team of homebrewers has done what Nintendo and Tecmo never did: translate Fatal Frame IV. A team at Fatal Frame fansite Beyond the Camera's Lens has released a patch that swaps out the Japanese text in the Tecmo/Nintendo/Grasshopper Manufacture-developed Fatal Frame IV: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse with its own translated English text and allows the Japanese disc to be loaded in other regions' Wiis. The best part? It runs from an SD card on any Wii -- no matter which region, and without the need for modding."
,s13,2010-01-19T11:57Z,"What virtual_boy's comment mentions, ""The best part? It runs from an SD card on any Wii -- no matter which region, and without the need for modding."", is only true for use of the patch used with the original japanese game disc."
,zxkb4s29,2010-01-19T12:20Z,"@virtual_boy: wikipedia says: ""The fan translation was developed to make use of the Wii's SD slot, allowing only the use of original copies of Zero: Tsukihami no Kamen. The patch was released January 17th, 2010, and takes roughly 380MB of space on a SD card.""

so if i'm right you still need some modding to start the original game itself."

,sagandre,2010-01-19T20:25Z,"I has burn the game on DVD and install the patch. I use HBC. When i run the game from the patch, the dvd comes out from wii and it says...please insert the fatal frame 4 games. Must it have a orginal game???"
,Strikefear13,2010-01-20T08:22Z,"Supposedly the English patch does not work with backup copies at ALL, hence the ""insert disc"" message.  Anybody get it to work with the patch and a backup? If so, how?"
,zxkb4s29,2010-01-20T12:16Z,"reading through gbatemp it seems only original (genuine) discs are supported. and i got a hunch patch uses some softmod modification on your wii which i would hate and am against. (even if faq says modification can be fully uninstalled. what if a new system menu will look after it like after hbc and the others?)

but, i think someone who has practice should do this http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=204190&view=findpost&p=2544264"
,Breadbin,2010-01-20T18:10Z,"guys the patch wont work on backups (so im told) but if you goto the link above and follow the instructions COMPLETELY you'll have a working version.
Awesome game

,schm00,2010-01-20T21:30Z,"I've got it working. I patched the ISO manually.

I dunno if it will work in the disc channel though."
,danny_w,2010-01-28T11:11Z,"fantsasic upload m8 
im using this with usb loader ,one of the best games on the wii ,its up there with res 4 ,if you like a game that makes you shite your pants .then this is for you , forget guns and knives ,all you get is a flashlight and a camera ,hardcore lol"
,koko-goal,2010-02-05T05:59Z,"So the patch won't work normally unless you patched it?

DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN

I thought this one is already patched, didn't notice the patch.

Thanks GC for the torrent and thanks to the seeders."
