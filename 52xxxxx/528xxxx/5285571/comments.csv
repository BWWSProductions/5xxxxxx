,primalclaws1974,2010-06-17T22:11Z,It amazes me when people take the time to do these uploads and then make them so hard to watch/burn that a lot of people don't bother! MOST PEOPLE STILL WANT .AVI!
[T],solstars,2010-06-20T17:41Z,"It amazes me when people take the time to do these uploads and then get idiotic complaints about the free stuff they're giving.  I didn't encode it for you; I did it for ME and decided to share it with those who wanted a copy.

You knew it wasn't AVI prior to downloading it, as it says h.264 in the description.  You apparently downloaded it anyway, then still had to bitch about the format. 

As far as MOST people wanting AVI, that's the stupidest statement I have heard is a long time.  I assure you that you are in the vast minority.  

I urge you to go ask the Secretmyth group for an old AVI encode and see what kind of response you get.  Move on to better formats.  Everyone else already has."

So thank you, solstars."
