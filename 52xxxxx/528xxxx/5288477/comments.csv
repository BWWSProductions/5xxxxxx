,Organjic,2010-01-19T21:22Z,"FAKE, Cam version, waste of time IMO.
A5 V3"
,twisted451,2010-01-20T18:28Z,"im sure its not fake and of course its a cam version thats what TS is, CAM video and direct Audio from an outside source before you call something fake make sure you know what your talking about noob"
,riot1059,2010-01-21T08:41Z,"A:2 V:3
Even for a cam this is bad. 

Putting my surround sound at maximum I could barely hear alot of dialogue, but action scenes were pretty loud

However finally hearing what was going on was no relief because the video is so bad that you can not follow any of the action

Metallic echo in sound

Even for a cam, this is unwatchable, I deleted it from my HD after about 20min into it"
,ddamnage,2010-01-24T20:47Z,"ok so this is rar'd with a password...wtf?!?!?

,stopngo,2010-01-28T01:25Z,"@giggedyguy: tell you what, you go and deliver ANY quality and then come back and say that... It is horrible quality, yes, and they usually do pretty bad, yes, but did you pay for this?? Thanks uploader for giving us the OPTION to download something, and thanks IMAGiNE for trying."
