NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....
Right this is our 3rd release of this of this **** film lol,getting better though each time......
This is a new video source we were given (thanks) with the last 32 seconds + taken off our last release as it was
missing on this.Video is much better than previous source but still needed a few tweaks.....also will say there is light
a slight pulse now and again so check the sample.
Audio is one of our worse and was taken with our first toy .......when we were in the testing stages,but it's the only audio
out so
The audio itself seems to have a bit of an echo and on the depth you would normally find on direct audio....also seems to
go quiet in places and loud in others.
Anyway not the best by far but more than watchable....enjoy.
