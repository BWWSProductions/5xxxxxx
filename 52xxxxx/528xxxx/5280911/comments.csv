Had a few laughs tho"
,FormaldehydeFTW,2010-01-16T02:04Z,"For anyone even remotely interested in this movie, for whatever bizarre purpose, do the world a favor and download it.

If you're just curious, that'll soon be taken care of; if you actually think it might be a good movie, you can watch it once this way and be done with it (or not if you actually like it, but at least you'll know, and even so, the download will likely do what you need); if you're a fan, you'll have a decent copy of the movie, free, without hassle; and finally, if you're a hater, you get the satisfaction of helping this douche fail some more.

According to the reviews, the movie redefined failure and according to the creator, it's just doing poorly because he couldn't market it correctly. I'll let the audience be the judges of that statement as I've yet to watch it myself and lord knows, he may be right (Ha... ha ha... yeah, right). Either way, he's adamant that the movie will do well on DVD; let's prove him wrong and send this movie back to where it belongs: the toilet.

But, that's just one man's opinion."

the audio falls badly out of sync during the last 10-15 mintues of the movie. otherwise, it's a perfecly decent rip. thanks for the upload!

,vector1818,2010-01-16T16:33Z,"I'm having trouble unzipping it, is there something I am missing? Did anyone else have trouble?"
,vector1818,2010-01-16T16:51Z,"Nevermind, just unzipped it, but it was giving me trouble."

       You have a pretty strong opinion on something you admittedly haven't seen. So based on other peoples reviews, you felt you had to slag this film. Some would call that a pathetic bandwagon mentality."
,metonic,2010-01-17T10:02Z,"I took a date to see this movie in theaters back in october. The book was so hilarious, I almost never put it down. At first I thought the movie was going to horrible, But I figure Im a fan of the book I might as well pay tribute(plus it wasnt online yet)  Took my date to see it, we had to drive about 45 minutes to get to the theater. When we got to the theater  that claimed to be playing it online, they weren't it was their ""sister theater"" down the street. It was liek a 10 minute walk(didnt want to spend 20 minutes looking for another parking space)  At that point I started having my doubts about it being worth all this walking lol. We made it in, and on tuesday night it was 12 bucks a ticket, not wanting to look cheap I paid, luckily my date didn't want popcorn or pop(16 bucks for a medium popcorn, 5 bucks a peice of a large pop)  What was worse is the theater was understaffed. No it wasn't busy, but  the first floor ofthe theater was empty with a sign pointing upstairs to gettickets, when you get to the ticket counter it had a sign pointing to the  concession stand to get your tickets :( I was annoyed and kept thinking this isnt going to be worth it, and my girl kept saying, this better be good, this better be good.  We go in to the theater its just us for 5 minutes as we watch previews another 8 people join in total in a theater that could easily fit a 100 people. The movie starts, and it hits me... this is awful, in the first 30 seconds it earned atleast my ticket, in the first 10 minutes or so it earned both.. It was one of the funniest movies, It is up there with hangover, but a lot more adult funny.  It is worth the money to see it in theater, it is worth the money to buy on dvd, and I plan on doing that. Its rare I find a movie worth buying, but for this I might even buy the extended pack or special edition, or what ever they release. Some parts are slow, some parts are so quick you almost miss it, but overall EXTREMELY funny. IF your a fan of the book keep your ears peeled, theres alot of stories in the book mentioned or covered(even if its a quickie) Being a fan, when you see tucker actually in the movie it makes the scene hes in 10x funnier. To be honest, if you dont know its him its not funny at all. my girl didnt think it was funny, until mid way through his scene and Im like you know thats the real tucker, and she started cracking up.. It is hilarious. dont take my word for it, check it out"
,oxide17,2010-01-18T19:55Z,"It is a good movie to watch, 8-8.5


FINISH HIM!! had me rolling on the floor"
,jerrycan42,2010-01-18T23:33Z,"This movie got a lot review from people who haven't seen it.  Anyone who has seen has thought well of it, summing it up as one of the better comedies of the year, if not the last few years.  Don't listen to anyone who hasn't seen it.
