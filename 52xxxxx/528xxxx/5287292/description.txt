Yul Brynner was an actor (The King and I, The Ultimate Warrior) but he was also a singer, and a lot of people didnt know that. This is a vinyl LP that was very hard for me to find. I converted this to mp3. However, i got it from an image file that i discovered while i was doing research to find out if copies of this album existed and if there were any for sale. I found the image file on a site called severnij-forum. I was so thrilled to have found this that i had to share it on the Pirate Bay.....and Pirate Bay wont let me post the link on here for some reason..anyway, i want to give the credit where its due to the place i got the image file from ...and they have my congratulations for uploading it. I wanted to hear this album and i saw it for sale on a site and it was expensive because of how rare it is.

Hope you enjoy this
