The world is littered with the bodies of sales people who learned enough about selling to make a career of it, but never learned how to close deals consistently in a way to make a success of it.

Closing the sale is the only assurance of rewards. It is not true that you get paid to sell. You are NOT paid to sell. You are only paid to close. Your ability or inability to bring your buyer to a "yes" decision, to quit looking, thinking and stalling and finally close, alone determines your stability and productivity as a sales person. Those that can close love selling and those who cannot close hate it!

Without this vital step being perfected you can call yourself a salesperson but you will never make it as a successful sales person. All of selling can be reduced to this one thing- Close or Be Closed.

This book is a compilation of the greatest closes ever assembled in one text. You will be introduced to great, time tested closes that have been around for ages, as well as brand new information for the 21st century. It will prove to be the most powerful information you have ever been given on closing a deal. 

In Grantâ€™s new book you will discover why Your Ability & Skills to Close = Your Income!
