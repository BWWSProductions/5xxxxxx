Thanks in advance to all seeders, I will seed as much as possible, as stated above what time I will be able to seed this Torrent.

Max upload speed here is 10mb/sec, so that'll do for alot people, tho I won't seed always (Read: 10:00 till 20:00, UTC +1).




Friday and Saturday the seeding-time is from 10:00 to 23:00 UTC +1 "
