RAR'd or not, there's little chance you can convince me that you can compress a 3-4 GB item by a factor of about 20-1."
,zogulusnig,2011-04-12T01:22Z,"OK, I admit that I jumped the gun here.

I went ahead and DL'd this torrent, and unRAR'd the file.

It DOES unRAR to 4.7GBs, which is a 30-1 compression ratio.  WOW.

No viruses present according to ClamAV.

I am burning it now, and will report back if the game does or does not work as advertised.

Thanks, fedge81, and my apologies for the slander. ;)"

@zogulusnig
It's only 4GB because Wii iso discs have to be a full 4.47GB to be read properly. To do that, the remaining space after the game is filled with 0s. All those 0s compress really well with zip tools."
