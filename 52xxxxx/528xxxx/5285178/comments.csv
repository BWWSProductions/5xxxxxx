,JacksGoneRogue,2010-01-19T00:58Z,Sherlock Holmes is not an action hero he is a Victorian detective who uses his powers of deduction not his fists. This is ridiculous and shows how bankrupt of ideas Hollywood has become. Not only are they remaking remakes but they are mixing up genres to the point of incredulity. I'm not watching any more Hollywood movies. In fact I'm going dark.

oh and yeah, there was clearly no sun in london in the 19th century. GAY ritchie got that right.

Dear lord, please spare me. 

1. Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character. If I were to write a script depicting him as a mid '90s nuclear physicist, it would be just as truthful as any other publication on him.

2. It's Hollywood. Are you really that stupid?

3. This is not a chatboard. If you want to bitch, go to 4chan.

Well, my attempt to buy back the laptop fell through..the man was too damn paranoid about it being a set up. So here I am in my last effort trying to figure out if there is a way to track it down somehow via the apps that I know where open at the time...safari, skype and vuze. Any ideas guys? Does any of these provide some gps tracking perhaps? Or does any clever mind out there have any other idea of how to get it back?

,lb187,2010-02-01T03:17Z,"Just a warning... not spam
So far, every MAX/MAXSPEED torrent I have DLed over the past 2 months has resulted in warning letters from my ISP.  Also, has anyone else been having problems viewing the comments on TPB until very recently?  Just a warning but I will not be DLing or seeding any more from MAX/MAXSPEED.  Seems like an MPAA plant to me or at the very least these torrents are all being monitored by the studios.  Be warned and I am running PEERBLOCKER with the MPAA blocklist.  Does anyone have a better ip blocker that they can reccomend?"

TPB RULES


1) do not spam comments with your bullshit. We don't care if you run a site full of trojans and malware with the promise of ~streaming the video online~ your site is not better and is full of adware and viruses. gtfo and quit commenting every goddamn top 100 torrent with your advertisements. 

2) Stop spamming with the OMFG DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS THE PARTYVAN IS WATCHIN U bullshit. Columbia/Paramount/Tristar/FBI does not give a shit. You won't get fucking V& for downloading a torrent. The worst that will happen is you'll get a cease and desist notice or they'll block you at your IP and you can just switch providers. STFU and GTFO. Why are you even here, you noobs.

3) Don't expect to get any A/V quality better than a TS or a CAM if the film's still in theaters. Jesus, are you people retarded? either wait for it to come out on video for a better rip or stfu until you can contribute something better.

4) the main purpose of comments on these sites is to warn other users whether a torrent is legit. If it's spam, if the sound or video quality is so bad it's unwatchable, or if it's got malware. This is not he site for your shitty, pseudo-intellectual review tripe. Save that shit for your emo livejournal. Any other comments are useless here.

Sherlock Holmes asks St. Peter what seems to be the problem. Apparently, Adam has gone 'walkabout' among all the souls. It will take ages to find him. Holmes tracks down Adam, very quickly.

The Lord asks Holmes how he recognized Adam among the millions of souls, without ever having met him.

""Elementary, my dear God, he has no navel.""

2: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson went on a camping trip. After sharing a good meal and a bottle of Petrie wine, they retire to their tent for the night.

At about 3 AM, Holmes nudges Watson and asks, ""Watson, look up into  the sky and tell me what you see?""

Watson said, ""I see millions of stars.""

Holmes asks, ""And, what does that tell you?"" 

Watson replies, ""Astronomically, it tells me there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, it tells me that Saturn is in Leo. Theologically, it tells me that God is great and we are small and insignificant. Horologically, it tells me that it's about 3 AM. Meteorologically, it tells me that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. What does it tell you, Holmes?""
Holmes retorts, ""Someone stole our tent."""

,AkaPhsyco,2010-03-01T11:47Z,"Hey MPAA you ever heard of innovation? 

Based on the condition of the movie industry over the past half of a decade, it would assuredly seem you haven't! 

Nice lame ass commercial at the beginning of your dvd menu's btw, ""You wouldn't steal a car would you!?"" 

Yea and Refer Madness was a factual depiction of marijuana use. 

The film industry has been separated from legitimate Art and Entertainment for half a century at least!

2tb and counting Dl'ed and believe me more to come!

Let me ask you this, the music industry got decimated by the digital pirate revolution, has music gotten any worse since? Haven't seen a NSYNC or Backstreet Boys in awhile. I wonder why that is?

If you really do it for the art, you should be happy to share your ""product"" and be happy with the theater tickets we buy!!!

Support Net Neutrality! Support the resistance against companies like Comcast trying to monopolize the internet and throttle innovation and connections! Write your congress/parliament, who's members time and again naively fail to understand how important a free and open internet is to this generation and the generations to come!

We all have grown up intimately connected to the internet. We've seen it sprout from a simple conversational tool in its public inception. Watched it grow into and industry must have with e-commerce. Blossom with sophisticated social networks and tools for musicians, amateur film makers and software designers to reach people in ways not even conceivable merely years ago.

 The fate of the internet; actual ""intellectual"" content, entrepreneurial availability and personal and artistic communication, is far too important to be left in the hands of people who have no reverence or little understanding. 

Thanks for your time and enjoy your content.

1 - seeders are more than leachers

2 - A million comments about how great the quality is(screeners are not ever great)

3 - 10 other torrents come out at the exact same time, the exact same size, having the exact same comments

4 - screen shots that seem to be accepted and never disappear on public websites

5 -When these fake torrents are released, for some reason they have +1000 seeds instantly

Is this torrent fake? Tracked? Use these common sense clarifiers. The movie industry obviously does not use common sense...

Take care and Download safe...
