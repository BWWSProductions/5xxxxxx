,BrokenEmpires,2010-03-14T10:25Z,"If any of you have problems watching HD mp4 or mkv files such as this one.
Download and install K-Lite Codec pack (Mega)
http://www.codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_mega.htm
It includes media player classic which is very light on cpu power.
If you have Win 7 make sure you enable the DivX H.264 decoder with Win7DSFilterTweaker after the install.
Since Win 7 has decoder set to 'microsoft' by default. That's the key to playing back HD videos. Thanks for seeding."
