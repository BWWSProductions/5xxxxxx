,stealy,2010-01-18T21:39Z,Just giving the people who don't have much a very nice sounding show. that is all. 
,zato1,2010-01-19T04:10Z,@gattaa---I've got about a terabyte of live dead in flac and .shn files and lossless is how most serious heads roll. Respect for the music dude.
,zato1,2010-01-19T04:12Z,And thanks for sharing Mr. Stealy. '72 shows kick ass!
[T],rjordan21,2010-01-21T04:47Z,"gattaa..... Your comment makes no sense at all.  The source material, regardless of what it is, will sound better in FLAC VS. MP3....and if you can't hear the difference save the space on your HD and reconvert your 12K ""tracks"" of GD music to 128kps....you'll still enjoy it.  
stealy.....thanks for the upload.  torrent sharing breathes new life in continuing to share the music  "
