Thank you sooo much for seeding! I will continue to seed.

Looking for the missing season one episodes (1 & 2, 4-10). Zernicus has season I in a single pack but the comments say it isn't watchable on a TV.  If anyone has them could you consider uploading?

Thank you again for all your great ups!"
