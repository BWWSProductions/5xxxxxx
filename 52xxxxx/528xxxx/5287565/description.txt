A pair of irresponsible energy drink salesmen realize that serving a month of hard time is nothing compared to spending 150 hours in a
community mentorship program after they trash the company truck and find themselves at the mercy of the court in this comedy starring
Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd. Wheeler (Scott) and Danny (Rudd) wouldn't necessarily be the first people a parent would turn to
when seeking out a babysitter, in fact, they probably wouldn't even make the list in the first place. After slamming a few too many
Minotaur energy drinks and crashing the company truck, however, the two loose-living pals narrowly avert jail when the court decides
to let them become mentors to a group of young misfits. But how is the recently dumped Danny supposed to help bashful, role-playing
geek Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) become a man when all he can offer the boy is bitter sarcasm, and is beer-chugging man-child Wheeler
really the best choice to help foul-mouthed fifth-grader Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson) develop more respect for his elders? Probably not,
but they'll have to do their best anyway when the center's ex-con director (Jane Lynch) confronts them with a harsh ultimatum. Now, if
Wheeler and Danny can just make it through the rest of their probation without getting tossed in jail, maybe there's hope for the boys --
and Danny's relationship with his fed-up girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) -- after all.
