,fredfan,2010-01-28T03:11Z,"dadeohdan:  You seem to enjoy a lot of the stuff here that has already been uploaded by djfred.  He's dependable stuff (not that Wilson isn't), so if you want to see all this stuff already on offer without waiting, go to his stuff.  Either search djfred500, or click his link on http://torrentbucket.com/ from the uploaders link, choose DVD-R, and click the piratebay link under his name.  You'll be glad you did, and no waiting for what's already up.  Enjoy!!!"
