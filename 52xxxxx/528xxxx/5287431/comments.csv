,ajones81,2010-01-17T22:35Z,Thanks a lot! :) Was waiting for #2 ever since I read your lovely scanlation of #1. Love the style of illustration in this French comic!
,ajones81,2010-01-17T22:43Z,"Just read the bit about the fixed #1. :( It would have been nice if you could have included the fixed JPGs separately as well in this torrent. Then instead of redownloading an entire 90+ MB file, we could have just got those and fixed it ourselves. Those who don't know how could of course have just got the entire fixed issue and everyone would've been happy.

Oh well. Thanks a lot anyway for the scans, I *really* appreciate it. I'm trying to track this comic down 'cos I want to own a hard copy of it as well..."

#3 is out too, just havent gotten it yet, but will scan that too of course."
