These songs were culled from a series of torrents on BTMon that went by the names: 1920_s_Popular_and_Rare_Music_Part_x_of_X and 1930_s_Popular_and_Rare_Music_Part_x_of_X.  They are hard to find now and i wasn't able to get all of them.  
The quality of these songs varies a lot.
I removed a few that were lesser-quality versions of those found in other torrents:

1. The Joint is Jumpin

2. Sugar Blues (also on BTJ)
