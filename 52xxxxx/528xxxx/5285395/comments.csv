,D0gmeat,2010-01-17T15:35Z,"Heh, liluser was just trying to help, too. Doesn't matter how people are getting the patch, does it?"
,Deuplonic,2010-01-17T16:25Z,"lol yeah i know, but its not exactly fair if its my first torrent on here, i dont mind but they coulda acknowledged the uploader(me) that would of been the fair thing to do :)"
,Deuplonic,2010-01-17T16:38Z,"besides, i wanted to continue the regular updates that get posted here, i needed the update myself for my girlfriend's pc, anyone can find this, or the other version that was posted in the link by liluser by googling for it, i just wanted to help thepiratebay users out a little, this has been put onto demonoid by myself and its actually stopped someone's game from crashing :D"
