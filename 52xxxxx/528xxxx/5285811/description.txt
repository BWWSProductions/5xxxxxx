Product Description:
Mach Desktop brings your desktop to life with Quartz 
Compositions, Quicktime Movies, or Web pages. Mach 
Desktop also comes built-in with over 20 stunning 
Quartz Compositions and over 5 beautiful Quicktime 
movies. You can, of course, choose your own Quartz 
Composition, Quicktime movie, or Web page to put on
