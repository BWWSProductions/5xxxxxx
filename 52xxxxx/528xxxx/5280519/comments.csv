,GiraffeL27,2010-02-02T04:24Z,"Thanks Wendy, your torrents are always great!

Any chance you could get Real Crimes: Jack the Ripper and Real Crimes: The Unicorn Killer?

I played the trials on Big Fish Games, but I can't find them on here.  Seeing as how you're the most trustworthy uploader I know, I'd love to see them from you!  Thanks if you can!"
