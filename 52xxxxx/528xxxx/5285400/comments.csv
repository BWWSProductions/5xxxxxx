,bmxjuh,2010-02-17T12:18Z,"good audio/video quality, no picture/sound problem. i found the sub file online.

good movie all the way up to the point where they found the tunnel, and the ending could have been a better one. the first 100min was awesome, but then the last 15min sort of went downhill...... but still a good movie.

anyways, thank you for sharing."
