Jackie may play cool and aloof, they're obviously still in love, so Michael starts shuttle diplomacy, 

albeit without rendering any sentence correctly, and makes each believe the other apologized first... 

Eric's announcement he defers college at least till Red is recovered delights Kitty as much as it 

depresses Red his 18 years wait isn't about to end after all, and joining Red in the doctor's ruthless 

diet looked doable to Kitty only till she reads he list includes no booze. Meanwhile Eric discovers and 

enjoys that the one thing hotter then make up-sex is going away-sex, so anything with Donna anywhere is

concert, but she doesn't even remember the Adonis, who just can't believe it: other girls pretend they 

did get him. Just admitting he finds Brooke hot too gets Hyde in Jackie's bad books, but he's not about 

to lie for her; Kitty assures her it just takes a few years of picking shrewd shrew-battles till a man 

just gives up 'disobeying'. Donna tells Kelso that Brooke is now a librarian, he keeps insisting -the 

other boys only now discover there is a library in town, and it has many Playboys! Later Brooke comes

Immigration is going to deport Fez if his marriage to Laurie is found fake, so he must sleep in the 

Foreman house, Kitty can't refuse. Red isn't happy to find him naked in the shower, nor bunking with 

Eric, who must imitate his ocean sounds tape to stop his endless candy stories, so Fez ends up in the 

basement, cranky after a sleepless night. Agent Armstrong interrogates everyone separately, but 

apparently considers the bride too attractive to conclude negatively. Hyde, Jackie and especially Donna 

insist till Kelso returns to Brooke, who cruelly tells him she didn't want to spare him but refuses to 

'take care of two babies'.

the boys to attend the school dance they had sworn never to join again. Donna is furious when she 

learns Eric hangs out there and is now popular with a few schoolgirls, so she turns up during her radio 

show. Fez fears the football team will again lock him up in a locker. Hyde only came for Jackie's sake. 

Kelso only wanted to avoid going to the library as Brooke suggested, but changes his mind and is 

starting there to charm his way into his baby's mother's hart... The kids are treated by Santa to 'more 

sensible' toy choices and bloody Vietnam stories, till Bob can't take it anymore...
