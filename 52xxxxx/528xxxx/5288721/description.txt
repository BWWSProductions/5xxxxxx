DIY Solar



This DVD (.iso file) contains all the video instructions you need to learn how to build and install solar systems.

Why pay big bucks to go to college for this or why pay big bucks to a company to do it for you? Just get educated for free by downloading this torrent and then do it yourself saving yourself hundreds if not thousands of dollars.

At a time when we could all use free electricity to keep food fresh in our refrigerators, keep warm during winter months, heat food to eat, and see in the dark, I value human life much more than the money that caused the greed that put us where we are today with billions loosing their jobs, going homeless, and dying in the streets.
