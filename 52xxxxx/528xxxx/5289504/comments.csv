[V],twentyforty,2010-01-18T21:53Z,"@ritesmax: I promised 720p re-encode as soon as I get one. It is the same episode. It should be absolutely the same, content-wise, by common sense, but first one was re-encoded XviD from group NoTV two days prior to actual US airing (last night).

P.S. How is going on Being Human S1?"
