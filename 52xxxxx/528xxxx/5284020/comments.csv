,blue_mist_angel2001,2010-08-09T22:37Z,"Hey Ms Medea, THANKS FOR THIS! I looooove listening to the songs. Takes me back to my fave scenes. Speaking of which, and I'm not sure if you have it, I really like the song from ep 22 when Damon and Elena danced. All I Need by Within Temptation. Just asking, but otherwise AWESOME JOB! Again thanks, and more power to you!"
,thefinnishviaduct,2010-12-12T13:51Z,"Hi 95% fantastic torrent :D Love it. Two points though -  some of the songs arew wrong like the Katy Perry song 'Thinking of You', and you don't have 'The Weight of us' by Sanders Bohlke. I happen to have both of these and they are the ocrrect ones, so for you people I'm going to attempt a torrent of all the songs before the year is out :)"
,thefinnishviaduct,2010-12-12T13:58Z,it will be my first otrrent though so bare with me on it :)
