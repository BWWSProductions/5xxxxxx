,jano001,2010-01-15T06:43Z,"Thanks, i use to download from eztv.it but the site can't be opened now. its more than 3 days now."
,sf_scottfur,2010-01-15T06:43Z,"Don't forget...the episode the other night was a ""lost episode"" from last season (big hint...charlie is alive in the episode).

Tonight's continues the story arc of season 2."

,GregiBoy,2010-01-15T08:16Z,What's happened to the EZTV.IT website???

The word is that eztv is temporarily down due to some hardware problems, but will be back.  No estimate yet as to how soon.

Also, I *think* this episode technically is s02e11, while the one aired earlier in the week actually was s01e21 [a previously unaired episode from season one].
At least those are the designations used in the episode guide that is part of Fox's wiki for the show.

,birken007,2010-01-15T10:56Z,"bullshit!!!!!!!!!! This is ep 11. I was looking forward to see this, but nooo. It's ep 11"
[T],Atilla82,2010-01-15T13:11Z,"I'm downloading now.
I doubt eztv would make such a trivial mistake, birken007.

I'll get back to you all when I download."
[T],Atilla82,2010-01-15T14:57Z,"It is a brand new episode, they are just naming the episodes in order of airing."
,Sweeper789,2010-01-15T22:47Z,thank you eztv
,fourbinator,2010-01-16T00:03Z,"@sebaygo1 i totally agree with you, in the episode aired earlier in the week appear the dunham's fbi's friend who is dead in the actual season...
So no doubt about it :)"
,YEKOOCHEBOY1,2010-01-16T02:26Z,Am willing to bet that this story is taking place on the other side of the Demention. or... what ever the two worlds are called. I am willing... any one think so?
,arildus,2010-01-16T08:11Z,Thanx;)
,raevynlunatique,2010-01-16T14:47Z,"I'm not familiar with how these shows are put on for download, and I've never once had a problem with EZTV (if I can't find it from them, I wait till I can *smile*), but the three episodes (10, 11 and 12 of Season two) I just downloaded are corrupted somehow. The audio sounds like they're talking in a barrel. All my other downloads from them are perfect. Any ideas/suggestions?"
,raevynlunatique,2010-01-16T14:49Z,"Sorry, misspoke...it's only episodes 10 and 11 that are wonky. 12 is just fine."
,drvcan,2010-01-17T00:31Z,thankyou so much eztv.
,Pegasus101,2010-01-17T22:35Z,is anyone else having probs getting of the ez site?
,Sattori,2010-01-18T21:24Z,Thanks. Really appreciated.
,sathanas6,2010-01-20T09:03Z,"YEKOOCHEBOY1, it can't be in the other universe because Peter Bishop wouldn't be there. The Peter from the normal Universe died and was replaced with the Peter from the other Universe, so there can't be a Peter Bishop there."
,bkgirl410,2010-01-21T06:45Z,what would i do without my eztv?  
,av1965,2010-01-21T21:46Z,enks
