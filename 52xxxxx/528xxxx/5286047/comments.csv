,tops.c,2010-01-18T13:55Z,"Just confirmed, you can transport to Jakobs Cove (only), what I did under XP sp3, installed from the original iso RELOADED (did not paste the original crack), just extracted this d/l to the /borderlands/ folder in your install directory, in Arid Badlands there's a transport to "" Firestone Coliseum"" there as soon arive there's a transport station it only let's you got to as I said ""Jakobs Cove "" maybe later on as you progress higher in the game will it allow the 2nd new place. remember don't use the old crack."

,unrealx420,2010-01-29T01:52Z,Shit i just noticed that i have already downloaded this one.. It will only work for version 1.10 download this if you really want to try out Jakobs cove if you have not yet. Its nothing special it really does not take long to beat it.
