Product Description:
Built on a foundation of simplicity, Acorn eschews the 
outmoded "many palettes" design from yesterday's 
editors. Acorn presents a fluid new interface that will be 
familiar to users of Apple's iLife applications. Designed 
for simple editing, Acorn features flood fill, gradients, 
vector shapes, drawing and erasing tools, and more. It 
also brings a few new tricks to the table, including 
chaining filters and easy image and canvas resizing. 
From quickly adding text to an image to creating a new 
graphic with pixel-precise control to just sketching out 
ideas, Acorn is great for all kinds of image editing.

What's New?
--> Fixed a couple of crashers when opening a PSD files.
--> Fixed bug where you couldn't set the height of an 
image via AppleScript.
--> New pref to ignore trackpad gestures (rotate, swipe 
to undo, magnify).
--> Fixed a crasher when using certain core image 
filters.
--> You can now see the bounds when creating a new 
shape.
--> The layer list contextual menu now has the option to 
lock the clicked on layer.
--> Fixed some drawing issues with the grid when 
zoomed in.
--> Fixed a bug where the flipped cursor coordinates 
were off by 1pt in the y direction.
--> Updated selection cursors.
--> Hold down the option key on an anchor point for a 
bezier curve to reset it. Hold down option when using a 
control point, to no longer mirror it with the control 
point opposite it.
--> New menu item to take a layered screenshot under 
the Image menu.
--> The combo slider widgets now fit in with the rest of 
the Acorn UI, and round down it's values when slidering.
--> The layer list thumbnail for shape layers draws a bit 
nicer now.
--> Bezier Shapes, in the shape palette (shortcut key 'p'). 
Not available in Acorn Free.
--> Newer, faster, better, stronger flood fill 
implementation.
--> You can now lock layers (currently using the Layer > 
Lock Layer menu item) A UI is coming eventually for the 
layers list.
--> No longer removing the color profile for PNG web 
exports.
--> The tooltip hint you get when you are inside a 
selection now hides when you have the shift or option 
key down, so you can see what you want to select (or 
deselect) better.
--> New advanced prefs pane, with fancy 'advanced' 
stuff.
--> The custom checkboxes now draw a highlight when 
they have focus.
--> You can now tab between the size and opacity fields 
in the brush palette.
--> Updated UI for the canvas free rotate, and you can 
now use your mouse to rotate the canvas when in this 
mode.
--> Updated UI on the scale transform.
--> Fixed a problem where sometimes clicking on a text 
area would reset it's color to black.
--> You can now save and open files as Microsoft Icons 
(.ico).
--> Double clicking on a rectangle will now open up the 
frame tab in the shape attributes palette.
--> Fixed a bug where paragraph styles were not scaled 
in text boxes along with the rest of the image.
--> Fixed a bug where "New Layer With Selection Via 
Cut" with shape layers didn't work properly.
--> An additional Transform operation "Scale Transform" 
has been added, bringing the total up to 3. They've also 
been moved under a new Layer â–¸ Transform menu, and 
the Scale Transform now uses the cmd-shift-t shortcut, 
since this is the most common type of transform that 
folks are trying to do.
--> Select All now works while you are cropping, and 
sets the crop to the whole canvas.
--> A new "precision mode" button for the brush tool, 
which lets you make your brush strokes in 
slllllooooooowwwwww mooooooootttttttiiiiiooonnnn.
--> Updated to a version of SQLite with better file 
locking behavior, which means you can now save Acorn 
documents on AFP volumes.
--> Acorn does a better job at keeping the cursor 
hidden when drawing in slowmo mode.
--> Fixed a bug where duplicating a shape layer would 
forget corner radiuses on rectangle shapes.
--> You can now change the bounds of a selected shape 
from the tools palette.
--> Fixed a bug where new image from clipboard would 
allow you to undo a change that you didn't make.
--> The Python runtime is no longer loaded into Acorn if 
you don't have any plugins installed which can use it.
This cuts down on memory that Acorn uses.
--> If your bitmap layers have a frame that falls outside 
the canvas bounds, then you'll see a light gray line 
representing those bounds as seen in this movie.
--> Three finger swipes on your macbook's trackpad 
now performs an undo for left swipes, redo for right 
swipes, select next layer for up swipes, and select 
previous layer for down swipes. (This is only for 
macbooks which have support for gestures in the 
trackpad).
--> You can now use pinch motions on the trackpad to 
zoom in and out, or rotate the canvas (for macbooks 
which have support for it).
--> The Canvas Resize command no longer brings up a 
modal window, and instead puts it's UI in a sheet.
--> You are now given an option to resize the canvas or 
not on rotate, as well as showing a grid.
--> You can now use the arrow keys to rotate the 
canvas, when the Image â–¸ Rotate Canvas â–¸ Free Rotate 
command is being used.
--> Shape handles are now drawn outside the canvas 
when the frame of the graphic are outside.
