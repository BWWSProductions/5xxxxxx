[R&B] The Artwoods / Art Gallery, 1966 (26-Track UK Edition)

The Artwoods
Art Gallery, 1966 (2009 UK 26-Track Reissue)

MP3 320kbps

Art Gallery (LP, Decca LK.4830) released in November 1966 in UK â€”
while the Artwoods consistently produced top quality material over a 4
year period (releasing 7 singles, 1 EP and 1 LP between 1964 and '67),
each release failed to click with the public.

Here were missed 4 other bonus tracks: "Big City", "Oh My Love", "I'm
Looking For A Saxophonist...", "Molly Anderson's Cookery" what can be
found on some rare album releases.

Band Info:

The Artwoods were formed in 1963, and over the next two years became
an extremely popular live attraction, rivaling groups such as the
Animals, although, despite releasing a clutch of singles and an album,
their record sales never reflected this popularity.

Singer Arthur Wood, from whom the band took their name, was the eldest
brother of Ronnie Wood (who later found fame with the Faces and
Rolling Stones). Art Wood had been a vocalist with Alexis Korner's
Blues Incorporated for a short period during 1962, simultaneously
fronting his own group, the Art Wood Combo.

When keyboardist Jon Lord and guitarist Derek Griffiths from Red
Bludd's Bluesicians joined the Art Wood Combo, they re-christened
themselves the Artwoods. Keef Hartley, formerly with Rory Storm & The
Hurricanes, joined on drums in December 1964 and the band turned
professional, securing a residency at London's 100 Club and signing a
recording contract with Decca Records.
