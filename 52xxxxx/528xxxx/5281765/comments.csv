,Blaqheart,2012-04-12T19:27Z,This is the shit!!! Thanx uploader.....this is just the perfect combo...Dilla and Jay
,Blaqheart,2012-04-12T19:51Z,I just had to report back to say this is really crazy!! For some reason Dilla's beats display Jay lyricism a whole lot more....its strange it seems like this is what he was meant to sound like...perfect once again
