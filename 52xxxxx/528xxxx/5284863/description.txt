Does God Get Diarrhea?

Flushing 4,000 Years Of Lies, Myths, And Fairy Tales Down The Toilet

by Odin Zeus McGaffer

In a world where religion is traditionally free from ridicule, out comes a book that clearly steps over the line and smashes the protective veil that surrounds all of the lies, myths, and fairy tales.  McGaffer wastes no time in hammering religion with logic, crude humor, and blatant disrespect.  Does God Get Diarrhea demonstrates the extreme absurdity of Christianity by tearing apart the Bible's asinine claims, critiquing the miracles of Christ, and exposing God as a hateful, bloodthirsty, mass murderer.  Not for the faint of heart, this book definitely doesn't beat around the burning bush when it comes to tolerating barbaric ideals and primitive creation theories.  Does God Get Diarrhea delivers what many non-believers have been too fearful to say for thousands of years with a huge twist of robust humor.  The title itself is enough to raise the eyebrows of even the most liberal minded individuals and is guaranteed to offend almost everyone.  Laugh your way through this book as you discover the gruesome reality of religion, the serious damage it has caused to our society, and the grim fate of a superstitious planet.   Warning:  This book contains graphic content, foul language, and reason.  All of which can be hazardous to your health.
