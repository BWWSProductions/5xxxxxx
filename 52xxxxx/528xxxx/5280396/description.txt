The reason I made this torrent, Is because a few months ago, I downloaded the Bloodhound Gang Discography. And I was VERY disappointed...

A lot of their songs were very bad :/
So I ended up deleting about 40 songs!
And kept what I think are their best songs!

All songs include all the ID3 tags. Album art, year, track numbers, ect.
