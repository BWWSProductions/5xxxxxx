Description..

Swedenâ€™s Shout Out Louds will return with their third studio album, 
a 10-track effort titled Work. Recorded at Seattleâ€™s Bear Creek studio with producer Phil Ek (Fleet Foxes, The Shins), 
the albums promises to be another swell collection of indie pop, 
judging by the newly unveiled video for the song titled â€œWallsâ€ (see below). 
Also worth noting is the inclusion of a song titled â€œ1999 if you remember, 
the last time a high-profile indie band dished out a sound about a year in the 20th century, 
it proved to be quite good. So, hereâ€™s hopingâ€¦

Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
Cheers, Bubanee
