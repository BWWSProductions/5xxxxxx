Dahlia Nero is a new character set for V4.

Requirements: Victoria 4 Complete, Victoria 4 Morphs ++ from DAZ Productions.

Dahlia was designed to work in Poser 6 and 7. She has not been tested in DAZ Studio or earlier versions of Poser. Because of her heavy reliance on Poser's material room nodes, it's unlikely she would work in a similar fashion in DAZ Studio. DAZ Studio support is not offered. She has not been tested in DAZ Studio or in versions of Poser below 6 (with all current service releases).


List:

* Dahlia Nero for V4
* Dahlia Nero - Expanded + Bonus
