[V],stepcraft,2010-01-18T01:47Z,"SecretMtyh, you kick ass! Thanks for all your hard work. All your movies look so damn good!

I stream them on my xbox360. The only problem is I have a Mac and we don't have any way to convert the files to 2channel audio if the movie is larger than 2GB. I know for PC everyone uses YAMB. We don't have such a program for Mac. I convert them to 2channel audio in Terminal using MP4Box (Mac), but the file size limit is 2GB. I can't convert your movies that are larger than 2GB. So unfortunately I miss out on your great work if it's larger than 2GB. I wish we (Mac) had a way to convert files larger than 2GB. Anyone know a way?

Thanks again for all your amazing hard work!!!

Keep it up!"
,whitey85,2010-01-18T04:07Z,stepcraft use VUSE it automatically converts them with a new update just released.
,camillez,2010-01-18T07:22Z,"Thank u very much SM!  I'm a big fan!!

,PooterP551,2010-01-18T15:37Z,"@stepcraft,
I use Toast Titanium 10. There is a setting to let use to convert files. I just convert SM files play on my AppleTv. Hope this helps"
,luftnaveen,2010-01-18T20:39Z,hi secret thanks today too. please upload  The Box and Couples retreat as your next pls?
,nicebuds,2010-01-19T12:30Z,"am i tripping or is the sound out of sync on this?  like really out of sync! will keep testing ,but I think I am going to be pretty dissapointed that no one has yet mentioned it! ... unless my copy or media player is screwed.. anyone else got it?"
,jaybl1487,2010-01-20T02:59Z,@nicebuds no u not cause i got the same problem the sound is out of sync great torrent though...damn wat a waste
,sinister007,2010-01-20T23:13Z,Thanks good movie
,charles338,2010-01-21T07:37Z,"Fantastic upload, saw it at the Movies and just had to see it again before its release here on DVD. Thank you!"
,e5frog,2010-01-23T23:45Z,"Very nice video and audio, unfortunately they're horribly out of sync. Same result in both VLC and Media Player Classic."
,e5frog,2010-01-23T23:53Z,About -3600ms audio time shift if you use Media Player Classic.
,charles338,2010-01-25T04:04Z,I actually reprocess the movie with ConvertXtoDVD 4 or 3 to DVD files and then use DVD Shrink 3.2 to re-aurther it (getting rid of the menues) and shrink to SL Disc. Fantastic picture and 5.1 Surround sound! I did not notice any out of sync sound when I watched. Anyway thanks again for the upload!!!
,ratbeast,2010-01-30T20:17Z,Looking forward to see it! :-) Thanks for uploading!

,trichopter,2010-02-07T01:00Z,to the dumbass above - it's even a bigger waste of time visiting your website!
,bbutton1,2010-02-19T18:33Z,"Well, Quick Time works perfectly... But BS.Player has audio out of sync. Something's bad. Maybe codecs :D"
,ourforce,2010-03-05T00:02Z,Awesome man Thanks
,dtkcom72,2010-04-03T20:15Z,tank you so much~~GOD BLESS U~~
,Dendeej,2010-04-07T20:39Z,"A: 9
V: 6

Res: 3
It's great for use on mobile phone or something like that.. But on watching a movie on this resolution on a 1920x1080 is like raping your screen xD

Movie: 7"
,doppio215,2010-04-26T04:20Z,"Thanks for the upload.

It works-looks and sounds fine on my computer, but when trying to stream it from my mac to my xbox360 with connect360 I get error code 69-C00D002F even though my xbox software is up to date.  This error code is allegedly because of constant bitrate audio instead of variable bitrate.  Anyone else run into this issue?

IMO the movie looks like trash unless you are 40+, but I d/led it for my parents...can't wait to get it off my computer after sharing for a while"
,BoonesFerry,2010-04-27T09:43Z,"excellent 
thank you

the complainers can suck it
the video quality when played at the coded resolution is superb!
and when converted to DVD using converxtodvd it also played perfect with great clarity."
,remrats,2010-08-30T02:41Z,Great sound and picture quality.  Thank you x
,audi_gal,2011-01-22T03:28Z,how do you convert the mp4 file to a regular movie file??
,Sn0okk,2011-01-27T18:52Z,"the quality is HORRIBLE, do not download unless you want to watch it on your phone or something..."
,CosmicM,2011-07-12T23:08Z,thx 4 the subtitles !
