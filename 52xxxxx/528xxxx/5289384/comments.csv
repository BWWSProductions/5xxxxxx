,Lizzz89,2010-01-20T23:09Z,"Thanks alot!
Good instructions of how to install it.

If it happens you cannot change the hosts file in Step 5 and Step 7; copy the file to another map, i.e. My Documents, open and change it there and replace the file in its former place.

Worked for me!"
,mousci,2010-01-22T17:10Z,"Thank you Thethingy! Gr8 download and very easy to fallow instructions,used your host file.Thx=)"
,DistortedMonkey,2010-01-23T07:21Z,"Hi, I installed it and I kept the host file open when I first opened the app because I couldn't save it when I wasn't in my admin account. The app worked great, but once I closed the host file, unsaved, it kept giving me an error code about restarting my computer whenever I chose edit on the launch window. I restarted, and edit still didn't work. I uninstalled everything (except for the host file) and installed again with Lizzz89's instructions. Organize works now, but edit still gives me an error message. Anyone know what I should do? Should I uninstall again and delete the host file too? 
Help would be greatly appreciated because this is for a project. Thank you"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-23T07:48Z,"yes uninstall it with the tool in the torrent, before reinstalling sort out your host file if you cant access or save your host file then use this one;

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5296064

once your host is sorted out adobe cant comunicate with the mothership so you can then reinstall and copy the .dll files over and you wont get any more troubles."
,DistortedMonkey,2010-01-23T09:35Z,"thanks for the file thethingy, but i tried to uninstall it several times using your Cleaner and it wouldn't work, then I tried Control Panel and it wouldn't work either. I then deleted the folders in my Program Files but Elements Organizer wouldn't work. So I just moved the hosts file from the link you gave me from your first reply and started back on step 1. When I finished everything, it still gave me the licensing error during the launch window. So is there anything else I could do to make it work?
If not then is there anyway i can delete the folders from my hard drive at all? Whenever I uninstall them through control panel it gives me a message saying ""Cannot work on what is not installed"", so I'm guessing there's something wrong. I'm just trying to be as detailed as possible. Thank you again."
,DistortedMonkey,2010-01-23T09:38Z,Oh and P.S. Should I delete the hosts.ics file too or was that not a part of the whole process? because Idk if that's been there before and I don't want to go deleting stuff that might mess up my comp
[V],thethingy,2010-01-23T18:59Z,"leave your host file if it is the one that you downloaded, youve got this problem as you started the app without the host file being saved so adobe has blocked your app, you need to remove your app and install it again, seems like you have got adminastrator issues on your pc, try installing the cleanup tool as admin, your installation is corupt now try system restore to get you back to the begining or downloading advanced uninstaller to get rid and start again."
,sdenp51d,2010-01-25T01:35Z,thingy..thanks for the download.everything is working fine. in the last step of your instructions you say not to download any updates. does that mean ever ?
[V],thethingy,2010-01-25T03:12Z,"well, updates work for now but sometimes updates remove the patched dll files and deactivate the app, you can always reinstall this version though, ive got access to legit copies of these apps so i can post the new dll files if it becomes an issue."
,sdenp51d,2010-01-25T04:32Z,Understood. thanks.
,mangochik1,2010-01-25T23:59Z,"I'm not fully computer illiterate, but I just can't seem to figure this out.  :O( 

I disconnected from the internet, ran the clean-up as admin just to make sure, and when I was ready to install using the application program, all it kept installing/copying was the files I got in the torrent download (Activation Inst. folder with blocker, *.dll, instructions, read me and clean up and the image to burn). 

I really want this program, but I can't figure it out. Can someone please help me?

,Fenn411,2010-02-02T03:19Z,"Thanks Thingy, I will try that but what about getting rid of the old version first?  Do I have to run the toolkit?  I have CS2 in there as well as reader and don't really want those deleted."
[V],thethingy,2010-02-02T03:22Z,"try it first, i know the comments here make it seem like each install requires a format but 9 times out of 10 itll just work, if you get any errors the toolkit will help or post a comment."
,Fenn411,2010-02-02T04:13Z,"Thanks again Thingy, I have now made it to step 5.  The HOSTS file says it is read only and can't be changed.  How do I get around this?"

,arrirc,2010-02-02T20:38Z,"Thank you very much for sharing thethingy :)
I have two questions: 

1. I have CS3 Production Premium installed which I require from time to time. Can I install this beside CS3 (ie without uninstalling CS3)?

2. Do I need to double click the exe file to extract the ISO? because the file list for this torrent mentions ""Photoshop Elements 8.exe"" as the only file, that is no ISO as you mentioned in the description.

Thanks again for the excellent torrent description too. :-)"

Well, this is my first time downloading something like this.

When I finished DLing the file, it gave me 2 things:
1. An Application called ""Adobe Photoshop Elements exe"" 
2. The Adobe Photoshop Elements Folder Containing activation and instructions.

However, when I click on the Application, it brings me to a popup saying: Extract (Install to Desktop) and makes me select a destination folder. 
I selected my Adobe folder and it saved the Application there.
BUT. When I click it, The SAME screen comes up asking me to extract it somewhere else. ???

Am I doing anything wrong.

ALSO: I converted the exe to iso. and the same thing still happened.

What's happening?! Thanks in advance!"

For some weeks ago, I downloaded the CS4 Master Collection. And now i tried to download this one, but I was wondering;

If I installed Elements 8, would the rest of the Adobe programs stop working?
Because when you shall install it, you get a hosts file in the same place as the other one (the Master Collection hosts). Will the Elements 8 hosts file replace the other one?"

,WhiteA9,2010-04-26T13:17Z,"Hi thethingy,

why it's very obvious that you have some outstanding torrents here, why can you not make them more simple to use like say the torrents of Gordsmash for example?? All this talk of pasting lines into host's and running clean installs with toolkits  if it fails the first time and infects all the other Adobe products. With Gordsmash you simply install as trial, run an activation blocker(which is a one click process no copying and pasting) then replace the DLL files and Voila!!! away you go with no problems.
Again  I know your torrents are good in that they work but couldnt you simplify them a tad.
Just a suggestion."
[V],thethingy,2010-04-26T17:12Z,"WhiteA9, it is really a straight forward process. the ""blocker"" you talk of adds entries to the hosts file but with the updates applied the ""blocker"" is inefective so you have to add additional lines to the hosts manually and in all fairness its a simple task that you could train a monkey to do. If you install as a trial then when you update the activation service closes the app so you need to have a full copy installed first. All my adobe torrents are the latest versions and all of them update so the few extra steps you have to do are well worth the minimal effort"
,WhiteA9,2010-04-26T18:46Z,"thethingy,

Thanks for explaining that to me..it's alot clearer now. So obviously with the torrents you're sharing it's like real deal everything's singing n dancing including the updates..COOL!! I have to confess that mine are all firewalled and am pretty sure they won't up-date going on the info you just given me. That said, I am happy with what I have (for free lol) and was just wondering since you're going to be the one with CS5 package soon if there was any chance of maybe up-loading a watered down down version for us who can live without the updates( I know it's easy and you can train Monkey to do it, it's just with soooo many Adobe apps on comp can do without the necessary risk) and maybe with just en_lang pack installed to bring the size down. I bet these torrents would prove just as popular as the all singing n dancing one.
Again, just a suggestion/request, regardless of what you do I'll happy with what's given.
Many thanks"

,hallasume,2010-05-20T06:36Z,"Thethingy; this is a great download. Just to everyone who is STILL confused about this error 130:3, for VISTA 32 BIT, the second you turn on the internet and try to use the app, Adobe will give you 130: 3 message. This is only natural afterall. There should e nothing wrong with your host to begin with but check anyways. Before you use the LicenseRecover.exe, make sure you open up Task Manager to  see if any Adobe related processes or apllications are open. End them if you find any. The license recovery shouldnt work by itself though; do the License Method 1 stuff. That shouldn't work by itself either. Do the .dll replacments in C:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop Elements 8.0 and C:\Program Files\Adobe\Elements Organizer 8.0, as those are the only folders affiliated with Elements 8 and  which have a amtlib.dll file. That's all that is needed to do to make this great torrent run like a dream. AGAIN THANKS THETHINGY. Note that this final solution has only been proven effective on the Vista 32-bit OS."

,fauxartist,2010-06-06T22:59Z,"I have a question about this article on CNET about an issue with security, and is this an issue with this software too...if so, do you have a patch...

Here's the article:

Adobe has issued a security advisory about a ""critical"" vulnerability in its Flash Player and Adobe Reader and Acrobat products that it says could let attackers take control of people's computers.

The company said late Friday that there had been reports of the hole actually being exploited and that an official patch was not yet available.

Affected software includes:

    * Adobe Flash Player 10.0.45.2, 9.0.262, and earlier 10.0.x and 9.0.x versions for Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Solaris
    * Adobe Reader and Acrobat 9.3.2 and earlier 9.x versions for Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX

The company said the Flash Player 10.1 Release Candidate does not seem to be vulnerable and that Adobe Reader and Acrobat 8.x are confirmed not vulnerable.

Adobe didn't say when an official fix would be released, but according to the company, computer users can mitigate the Flash issue by downloading the release candidate mentioned above. The Acrobat and Reader issue can be addressed by ""deleting, renaming, or removing access to the authplay.dll file"" that ships with those products, Adobe said. This will, however, cause a nonexploitable crash or error message if a user opens a PDF file that contains SWF content. The .dll file is typically located at C:\Program Files\Adobe\Reader 9.0\Reader\authplay.dll for Adobe Reader or C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat 9.0\Acrobat\authplay.dll for Acrobat, Adobe sai"

run the Windows cleanup (run as admin) the one that came with this download. After that go to C:program files/adobe and see if you have a folder that says photoshop elements 8.0 delete that and the elements organizer 8.0. After go to Start-Run-type in ""regedit""push enter. On the top left corner, double click on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Adobe. If you don't see photoshop elements 8.0 and Elements organizer 8.0 then click on HKEY_CURRENT_USER/SOFTWARE/Adobe.

In the instructions you offer to help if posted here. Well, I have a problem as on a comment by greekfirefor at 2010-06-11. You answered on the same day and advised:
â€œerror 130.3 is a common error, you download this;
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5592268â€

The problem is that that torrent is no longer available.

Also, I canâ€™t get to the license place, but it is probably on that part pf the app that error 130:3 doesnâ€™t allow access.

Can you please give me an idea of what to do to solve the issue, please?"
