,insanetwiztidjuggalo,2010-01-20T02:15Z,"Sorry people, me & my step dad got into it, so i had to shut down my computer & leave town for a night, but i'm seeding again:)"
[T],troyBORG,2010-01-27T19:17Z,"You must have a slow connection or not sharing a lot..

1.6gb doesn't take this long to upload...
If I was uploading at my full speed the max would be ~4.5hrs!

Time Elapsed for me:
4d 13hr  Download 774MB,  Upload 2.23GB"
,dodoblaster,2010-01-30T00:23Z,"About 100 people stuck at 43.8%
insanetwiztidjuggalo thank you for uploading this but you have to wait till at least 10 people have complete copies of this torrent in order for the torrent to have any real chance of living...
So... get your ass online.. Please"
,dodoblaster,2010-01-30T07:48Z,Ok.. I downloaded the last discography this guy uploaded and i merged it with this one... The new total % we are stuck at should be more then 53%.. donno how much more though...
,dodoblaster,2010-01-30T07:56Z,55.9 is what I got
,insanetwiztidjuggalo,2010-01-30T16:54Z,"I'm sorry people, i seed when i can...i just moved into a new house, the phone line is in horrible connection & is always fuckin with my internet... i'm seeding as much as i can....and to Dodoblaster, i wouldn't recommend merging the 2 discographies together...i had to stop seeding the last one because iTunes corrupted some of the files i was uploading."
,dodoblaster,2010-01-31T05:57Z,"insanetwiztidjuggalo click right click on the torrent, click properties, and select initial seeding."
,Dijkertje,2010-02-01T12:55Z,When it's done I'll keep seeding as long as possible. My internet is capable of doing 60kb/s of upload.
