Too great of an album not to be on here. Their new disc, "Reality", will be released next month, and will use all organic instruments (like "i"). They are fantastic live too, so if they are coming to your area make sure to go see them!

Ripped at 192kbs. Let me know if there's a problem, as I haven't made a torrent in a while.

Enjoy!
