Synopsis

Focaccia Blues explores the location and protagonists of a real-life event in Puglia. A large, 550m2 McDonald's opened in 2001 in Altamura, arousing peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s curiosity. After some months, Luca Di GesÃƒÂ¹ the baker opened a small shop next to the "American Giant". Clearly, from that moment onwards, fair competition from the baker put the great Fast Food chain in difficulty and it was forced to close. Renzo Arbore and Lino Banfi appear as themselves mocking about each other and the two cities in Puglia they come from, while cooking traditional food.




Pirate critic

This film describes in a way the collision of two worlds as the little village of Asterix which defeated the Roman empire. But it is very different from some Anglosaxon movies such as "Mc Libel" or "Supersize me": critism to fast food industry is implicit and arises simply from documenting its total failure in a small village with strong food tradition. Excellent photography and collaboration of locals from Altamura make this film also a good portrait of rural southern Italy.

The DVD is very rare and will be a trouble buying it even if you live in Italy.
