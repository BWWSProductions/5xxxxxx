Notes 
Tracklist on release given as a story: 
Axefield's Back! 
I believe I'm gonna sky rocket this time. 
Does that make me Crazy? Possibly. 
Was done around 1:22. 
While Hooked On Radiation. 
Negativity Uninvited. 
Confusion? 
I'm a Hustler baby. 
Come Dance Wiv Me! 
Why do people wear Eple&Melk? 
Drifting off... What was I talking again? 
Oh yeah, I'm On The Strength. 
From Memories moving forwards. 
Not building a house out of Bamboo. 
But using my Brains. 
But maybe it's just the E Talking. 
Beware Of The Dog. 
I'm gonna be a Rock Star! 
Will seem Like I Love You. 
While continuing searching for my She Wolf. 
I dedicate this mix to my beloved cat Phelix. 
I'm coming up. Hands To Phone! 
Oh wait. Do I have a message? 
Uhm... Save The World, Kill Yourself?
