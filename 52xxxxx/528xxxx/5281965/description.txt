       1/10 - The team of hustlers - Alexis Conran, Paul Wilson and 
       Jessica Clement - appear as they have never been seen before. 
       After exposing hundreds of scams for the public, the hustlers 
       have come up with new ways of keeping their identity secret by 
       assembling a range of cunning disguises and characters which they 
       use to keep on exposing daring cons and scams.
       
       And that's not the only change - in each episode Alex, Jess and 
       Paul take a well-known personality and put them into the shoes of 
       a hustler. They are given the inside track, learn the harsh 
       realities of just how Britain's shameless confidence tricksters 
       set out to con people, and help to warn the public what to watch 
       out for.
       
       The hustlers go shopping for expensive sports cars and drive away 
       with their biggest pay day yet. Alex, Paul and Jess teach Danny 
       Dyer the ropes as he becomes the first celebrity hustler, and Paul 
       and Jess discover a miracle smoking cure that has punters queueing 
       up to buy.
