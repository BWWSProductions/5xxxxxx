Asia includes: Steve Howe (guitar); Geoff Downes (keyboards); Carl Palmer (drums). If you're assuming that Asia's 1999 release, ANTHOLOGY, is a best-of collection that features the original versions of the band's biggest hits, you're mistaken. Due to a court order obtained by original Asia singer/bassist John Wetton, the vocals for the songs he originally sang on had to be re-recorded (the vocal and bass duties on ANTHOLOGY are handled by John Payne). This isn't to say that these re-recorded versions of such Asia prog-pop favorites as "Heat of the Moment," "The Heat Goes On," "Don't Cry," and "Go" won't be enjoyable for longtime fans. "Anthology" is a an excellent selection from the albums "Aqua", "Aria" and "Arena" plus re-recordings of classic hits like "Only Time Will Tell" and "Heat Of The Moment".
