,zeo2k,2010-05-02T19:37Z,"Please seed folks

thx"
,shantheman,2010-05-14T23:21Z,@lastjedi  I had the same issue with other movies.  What it is there are different direct show plug ins.  I just monkeyed with them till I finally got one to work correctly.  I'm  DL'ing atm and I dout they would post something without audio.
,ubsp,2010-05-20T23:06Z,"C'mon guys, where are the seeders?! 3 out of 60, this is fucking paltry."
,Djin,2010-05-22T18:55Z,"Texted language: English? , but i can't see the text"
,Mercury8215,2010-06-06T06:08Z,"This might help with the audio issue.  

The Combined Community Codec Pack
download it from
www.cccp-project.net

And I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have it already.  I've had very few issues with my video downloads since I installed it.  "
,BluArtistEyes,2010-06-19T09:30Z,"Don't know if its just my download, cuz recheck takes forever so I only use as last resort, but I had to search for other torrent files to watch season 3 episode 17, on this torrent the HDTV rip it's cut complete sections of video out, very choppy work looks like it may be the way it was re-broadcast because there is some visible broadcast issues as well, so I suspect it was not the download messing up at all. Too bad they did not just Rip from the dvds those are always studio quality television even HD is hardly ever near that and it cost 2 cents to rent from netflix or somewhere like that, so why do they extra work of recording and ripping from TV"
,BluArtistEyes,2010-06-19T13:33Z,"no luck finding another torrent for that specific episode, they all take over 4 weeks to download, so if anyone else has issues with it what I did was searched google specified video files on side tab and put in ""enterprise hatchery"" and it came up under tv.com or something like that near the top saying 45mins or so in runtime very annoying they made the adds even worse on streaming version now they make you sit through three and flash block no longer blocks add specific flash videos when encoded the way they have it on that site, so just press mute and glance at time in seconds wait that long don't look at screen or you will be supporting the advertiser by viewing the content they are trying to force on you then get the next time in seconds and count looking away again repeat one last time and you can watch it for a bit then repeat the whole process I think the three adds only came up once more then at the end but then you can simply exit browser."
,BluArtistEyes,2010-06-19T13:37Z,"well flashblock can block it, but it only blocks the entire video field now, which is worthless, you used to be able to see the specific flash urls and only block the ones pertaining to the advertisements, not the video itself oh well guess they marketers got smarter to flashblock technology and changed things"
,DisasterMaster,2010-07-26T18:29Z,"thank u very much for this!!!

,gstaba,2010-08-09T19:20Z,"Folks, I beg you, please,seeeeeeed!!!!!!!!!"

,AncientTPB,2010-11-18T21:51Z,"Thank you so much for uploading this. This is by far my most favorite of all the series' ever made.

So far I have seeded 7 full copies so at least 7 others could enjoy this great mega pack.

I watched all the episodes, in a couple episodes a few seconds of audio are missing and only 1 or 2 episodes had the audio out of sync by 500 milliseconds.
Otherwise this megapack is absolutely fantastic.
Thanks again for uploading. :)"
,5iF3R,2010-12-01T11:53Z,Thanks for this all you SEEDERS out there! :)
,Mythicos,2010-12-12T00:40Z,"A lot of effort has gone into making this torrent. Unlike others, I will not bitch and cry, I will simply thank the uploader, greatly, for their effort in putting this up here with such extensive information supplied.

So: Thank you. :)"
,MP57navy,2010-12-13T14:31Z,"Seed, omg."
,daveydc,2010-12-13T16:41Z,"Most of the episodes are prettty bad quality, even worse than VHS"
,kylevaughan,2011-01-09T20:59Z,"please people for the love of god seed! there are like 30 people with 100% and NONE of them are seeding, at this rate its going to take 2 years! 1.4k/s is ridiculous. please people i beg you."
,Neo_aeoN,2011-01-26T15:08Z,"Normally I wouldn't check on links cos usually spam. However this one from MJK85 about Enterprise - I did. I can say that it's free, no strings attached. Downside is that they are small files. If you need a fix and not worry about small files, then they are quick and painless. Kudos to the uploader for presenting these files in such a comprehensive way. Enterprise rocks."
,cew006,2011-01-30T22:51Z,"s1 & s2 video is 448x256, ~176MB ea.
s3 is 432x240.
s4 624x352 ~358MB.

V 7/10
A 7/10

The files aren't the biggest, but this is a complete series. If you want DVD quality ... go to Best Buy.

Thank you for the upload. Seeding 100%.
