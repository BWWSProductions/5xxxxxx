,newfie905,2010-01-18T06:34Z,i ripped this movie and  burned it  and it played fine right until the middle of the movie then it played the scene over and over again did u watch the copy when u did it and if so what do u use to burn it i use dvd shrink to make it to a iso then i burned it and the movie structure screwed up in the middle
,fredfan,2010-01-18T16:54Z,"newfie905: Why would you make an .iso when you have the files right here?  You just use Nero, or better yet the freeware IMGBurn, to burn files to disc.  Finito.

Pretty rare that Fred Clan downloads fail in that sense.  That's why they use files rather than iso's...not sure why you're creating an extra step that is surely the cause of your complications in the first place.  That, or evil spirits are fucking up your burns...try setting up a camcorder in front of your computer while you're gone.

@hjsn1:  Any information on which endings are included here?  Apparently, that's the big deal with this release, seeing the different theatrical, internet, and director's cut endings.  Any guidance here?"
[T],hjsn1,2010-01-19T02:34Z,"newfie905: The reason I asked was that when you made your first comment the movie wasn't fully uploaded yet. That could be a problem too. It was only 89% uploaded when I replied to your comment.

fredfan: I was reading about the different endings problem as well....the DVD included what it said was the ""theatrical"" and the ""alternate"".....I did watch this movie and saw both endings and they, of course, are both on there. "
