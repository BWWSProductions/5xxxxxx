PlayStation-Ready HD Movie Trailers
January 14, 2010


This is a collection of movie trailers for next week premieres
and latest interesting trailers in HD 1080p. The second
Kick-Ass trailer is super awesome. Other trailers are
just good. No bonus for today.

If you're new to this collection, try searching
for 'HD Movie Trailers' on thepiratebay.org. It's
two months since I've started it and currently
I'm planning to do a website.
