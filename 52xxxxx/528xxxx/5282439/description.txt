VALKYRJA were formed in 2004 and immediately started working on writing their own material. In March of 2005 the first aural offering was crafted under the title â€˜Funeral Voicesâ€™, a vicious 5-track presenting a fierce and relentless preview of what was yet to rise.

â€˜Funeral Voicesâ€™ got re-released under a new title â€“ â€˜Far Beyondâ€™ - on cassette via Deathkrush Productions in September of the same year, including an additional 5-track studio session on the B-side.

In 2006 VALKYRJA went through some line-up changes, as guitarist Joakim and drummer Skall were dismissed from the band. A. Hed stepped in on guitar and J. Wallgren joined on drums.

The debut album â€˜The Invocation Of Demiseâ€™ was recorded at Necromorbus Studio in March and April of 2007 and unleashed upon mankind in September via Northern Silence Productions (CD/LP).

Bass player J. Lindgren left the borders of Sweden, soon being replaced by M.A. In July of 2008. By the end of the year VALKYRJA signed a multiple album deal with Metal Blade Records. The band sees the work with these allies as an opportunity to spread their crafts even further and on a larger scale. The Swedes have thus far already marked both studio and live performances with a brutal and aggressive signet, leaving no-one unaware of what the band can deliver. Territories stand not yet ravished by the plague and famine that is VALKYRJA, a fact this collaboration will change - a seal in Blood, Fire and Death.

In early 2009 the band is busy writing and rehearsing new songs for their second full-length. VALKYRJA plan to record at Necromorbus once again.

A new studio session took place during the summer of 2009 to manifest the second album â€˜Contaminationâ€™. Recorded at Necromorbus Studio, again with Tore Stjerna as producer.
