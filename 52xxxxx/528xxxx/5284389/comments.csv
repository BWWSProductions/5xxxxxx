As 'The Cramps' have so wonderfully sung, ""You've Got Good Taste"".  I would love you even more if you would send me a Demonoid invite to joeinbham @ yahoo dot com.  If you can't, no problem.  If you can, thank you. "

But on a good side, you don't need an invite as they have opened up for everyone to browse around and download.  It's not restricted to members only like before.  But to be honest, TPB Rulezzz..  :)"
