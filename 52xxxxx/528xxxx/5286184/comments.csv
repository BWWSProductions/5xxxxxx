,dsafjaly69,2010-01-18T17:11Z,"""Elven Legacy : Ranger""  archive seems to be incomplete, but everything else works."
,lechampion,2010-02-13T17:48Z,"To install the game: 

Mount the iso. file with Daemon Tool Lite (It's a freeware). You can download it to the official website here: 
http://disk-tools.com/download/daemon+sptd+md5sum

To install the 2 Extentions:
 Elven Legacy-Siege and Elven Legacy-Magic:

1: Create an empty folder on your desktop.

2: Extract the bin. file in that empty folder.

3: Same thing for all the bin. files."
,lechampion,2010-02-13T18:03Z,"To extract bin. files and iso. files you can use Izarc.

Izarc is a FREEWARE (not a trial version) and has the same function than MagicIso, Ultraiso,Poweriso and others Shareware to extract iso. and bin. files.

You can download IZARC here (official website of IZARC) :

http://www.izarc.org/
"
,lechampion,2010-02-13T18:10Z,In the instalation of IZARC don't forget to check the checkbox bin. and the checkbox iso. because they are not checked.

,lechampion,2010-08-28T17:49Z,"I won the principal campain and the 2 extentions. It's THE BETTER PLAY-PER-PLAY VIDEO GAME THAT I PLAYED IN MY LIFE ! ! ! BETTER THAN HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC AND AGE OF WONDERS ! ! ! 97/100 ! Try, you will like it ! "
,Dremin_th,2011-02-20T21:48Z,"As others have already reported, 
ELVEN LEGACY - RANGER archive is incomplete and the binary image does not extract.

The rest are ok.
Thanks for the upload!

However, I would appreciate if the Rangers expansion was complete or not mentioned/included at all"
,wolfblade1989,2011-07-29T02:25Z,"Anyone else getting the d3dx9_30.dll not installed message? I've already reinstalled, no good. Help?"
,Luckmann,2011-10-12T04:18Z,"How the fuck did you get a ""Trusted""-tag you goddamn failure of a man?

As several have reported, ""Ranger"" expansion is non-working; Broken/missing .rar archive.

Broken torrent, ignore and move on."
