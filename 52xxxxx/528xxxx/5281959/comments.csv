,thanksbut,2010-02-18T10:38Z,This is a fake torrent. Probably one as a advertisement by credumed company.
,thanksbut,2010-02-18T23:42Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!  
Check comments at btmon. These files are corrupt on purpose, most probably to advertise their product."

Im Linux user, may be the files have some issues in Windows, but for me they are working ok, even while they are downloading (partial files). The cover and other images files is corresponding to the video.  If someone really want this stuff, tell me and I can code them to mkv more compatible format (H264-ac3)."
