[T],gamerguuy,2010-01-17T15:25Z,"keep on downloading it.Eventually there will be seeders. Currently there is one seeder which is the seeders but by tomorrow there will be enough seeders,and one more thing,my torrents usually have low seeders but good health which means that you can get the file very quickly depending on your bandwidth.I can guarantee you that.:)"
,maybeso,2010-01-17T15:45Z,does this one not have game glitches or bugs i hope not because goty edition and original have them
,fakebest,2010-01-19T01:39Z,"what's the point of this release, isn't this the same thing as game of the year edition from 2009 just repackaged at a cheaper price in stores?"

,Beckygamer,2010-02-10T15:22Z,been downloading for a whole day and only at 30% can't wait to play
,Beckygamer,2010-02-11T15:36Z,"finally got it downloaded but it's just a bunch of winrar files and i have no idea what to do, im pretty new to this and would appreciate a little guidance."
,ismellfunny67,2010-02-16T06:38Z,"You need to get a couple programs becky, all of them are free. Mainly something like WinRAR to extract the RAR files and Daemon Tools if you plan on mounting the Iso image."
,pnelz,2010-02-18T10:49Z,k so my question is (cause im a noob at this(1st time)) how do u burn the image on after? i only have a 4 gb flash drive and i dont even know how i would get it on one big enough anyways. also can you basically put it onto a bunch of seperate disks. confusin the shit out of me.. id really appreciate any help or advice.. thanks!
,eternitychaos,2010-03-05T01:37Z,Where can I get the xbox emulator? 
,jesaug205,2010-03-07T00:03Z,"There are no such emulator, at least not one that would let you play x360 games on your PC"
,given2flye,2010-03-21T16:37Z,Hey guys is this the real thing? some feedback please.
,Nentisys,2010-04-19T15:29Z,"Thanks, working great."
,mark6921,2010-05-18T17:51Z,game is in english. works for NTSC. unzip last file and you will find the .iso and .dvd file
,fckng_noob,2010-06-11T22:11Z,it has only english language?
,gamestoolittle,2010-09-28T23:59Z,"Sorry for being a noob by poasting this but, I see all these .rar files which one do i unpack? any help is appreciated"
,ranur10,2010-10-07T20:37Z,You double click any of them and you will find the .iso file
,stickdick,2010-10-23T03:27Z,Thanks bra. i'd be lost if it weren't for people like you
,slayersexo,2010-10-26T04:22Z,has this been stealthed and does it have .dvd file?
,chickenboi1990,2010-10-30T09:49Z,"You don't need the .dvd file to be included, you just use abgx to create one if one isn't included, as for stealthing. It's safer to stealth patch it yourself, just google it."
,gamestoolittle,2010-11-25T02:07Z,"okay so ive downloaded this done all the torenting, and have put it onto a portable harddrive, and my xbox isnt even showing that this hardrive or my 8 gig flashdrive have it on there, is there a way to compress it ont a small disk and load it onto the xbox from there?"
,widmo666,2011-10-26T17:55Z,"Thanka a lot Dude !!!!!!!!!!!!!! You are brilliant !!!! Game is in my language too (POLISH) .... Works grate, just burn it people using ImgBurn and DVD + R DL Verbatim ... Fabel 2 world is my Yea ;P"
,Arta24,2011-12-13T19:49Z,when i run this in abgx it says that stealth didn't pass the check. Also when i run the game on my 360 it says unrecognised disc. Can someone tell me why the hell it doesn't work?  Maybe this is fake...
