,Yurn2,2010-01-28T20:55Z,People should give this one a miss as the bitrate is far too low for the quality to be good for 720p content. it should be atleast double the size and bitrate for each...

If you want(/care about) the best quality, buy the fkn Bluray. (TIP: get a (good) job)

This is good enough for a great quality."
