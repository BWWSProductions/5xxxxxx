Comedy Central has begun delaying the web broadcast several hours later than they had been doing, And more and more countries are having web streaming disabled entirely. We do unfortunately still need to torrent the Colbert Report and The Daily Show . . ."
,mrt999,2010-01-21T06:28Z,Thankyou so Much! I Live in Australia and there is no web streaming available to view ANY of my beloved shows.  Without Torrents we simply wouldnt have tv worth watching! Thanks Again.
