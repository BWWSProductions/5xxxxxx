Ableton 8.1.0 has a shit load of bugs.  One of which prevents you from opening sets (I'm a victim).  "

Having trouble with the installation. Any chance for a more detailed install instructions?"
,MOB4LIFE,2010-01-25T21:50Z,great torrent man thanx works great peace...
,MOB4LIFE,2010-01-25T21:56Z,everyone i had the same prob. when i first got it the crack (live) file shows up white on mine but then i forgot what i did to make the crack look like an exe  or something like that ill check it out again see what i did redo  everything and ill post another comment showing how to do it
,dimi13beast,2010-01-27T03:15Z,"@MOB4LIFE thnx i have no mac to test it on, so i can't really post good directions. lots of thnx if you can get good instructions"
,kshi,2010-02-04T21:13Z,"You need to remove the file associations from the ""Live"" file in the crack folder. To make it work you need to ""chmod +x Live"" in a Terminal window. Then double click the .auz file with Live already open. 

Thats how I got it to work for me at least. 

Thx Dimi13beast, btw. : )"
,sandypsyc,2010-02-07T18:33Z,"Thanks dimi, thanks kshi.

That worked for me.
For those like myself less familiar with Terminal, this is the Terminal command I used to make it work.

chmod +x /Applications/Live8/Live.app/Contents/MacOS/Live

so just replace ""Live8"" with whatever you named your Live folder. I renamed mine Live8 with no spaces because i didn't know how to write a 'space' in Terminal."
,kevbomb,2010-02-09T16:01Z,"Can someone explain the installation steps a bit clearer. I'm so close. I have chmod +x the live crack file and it changed, but where is Contents/MacOS in Live's Application folder, does the live crack file have to go there or do I just need to do Terminal text correctly. Please comment"
,kshi,2010-02-12T09:06Z,"kevbomb, right click on the Live.app and select ""Show Package Contents"". Procede to Contents/MacOS/ and copy the live file there. "

Appreciate it."
,dimi13beast,2010-02-14T06:03Z,I finally got a mac. Heres some better install instructions
,KissZol,2010-02-15T11:11Z,"This worked:

1. Open dmg and copy to aplication.
2. Unzip crack file.
3. Replace the Live file from the crack folder to the ""real"" Live file. ( Application/Live 8.1 Osx/Live.app right click than show package contants here Contents/MacOS )
4. Copy the Authorize81Mac.auz also here.
5. Run Live from here, it will open in Terminal.
6. IMPORTANT!!! Rename the folder in Applications/Live 8.1 OS X to Live8 (because the Terminal could not handled the ""space"" !!!!!!! 
6. Type in Terminal:  chmod +x /Applications/Live8/Live.app/Contents/MacOS/Live
7. Run Authorize81Mac

I hope To work for u too."

,groovenova,2010-03-25T15:57Z,"KissZol...

Good instructions

I managed to get into the MacOS folder and replace the Live file with the one from the crack 

**it brings up a prompt when you replace it**

However when i either double click the Authorise81Mac.auz file or the new Live file i still get the unable to authorise message?

I have tried several times and i dont know what to do - need some help please..."
,groovenova,2010-03-25T19:50Z,"I dont even know if this works on 10.4.11?

from what i have gathered reading on other forums is that once you have replced the live file with that from the crack as per the instructions posted earlier you then open live, decline the authorisation and then ""drag and drop"" the auz. file onto the live interface

but im buggered if i can get it to work!"
,cancelctrl,2010-03-25T22:46Z,Where do you all get serial numbers? This version hasn't come with one and I need authorization.

i have an important question though... i was running Live 6 before and received the dreaded 'Ableton Copy Protection Violation' message that killed it for me.  can i safely open my old songs from corrupt Live 6 in this version or will the copy protection leach into this one too?  thoughts...

cheers"
,kellen100,2010-05-15T17:27Z,Has anyone come up with a fix for the registration problem many of us are having?  everything goes smoothly until I open the registration file or drag it into ableton.  Either way it doesn't work.

,borisdivider,2010-07-30T14:00Z,"I have heard that Live will crash after a period of time. When this happens, you should try this:

- close Live

- delete the ""Preferences.cfg"" and ""Template.als""  and ""Undo.cfg""  files (if available) from

- delete the content of these two folders:

- restart Live"
,borisdivider,2010-07-30T17:36Z,"So I downloaded it. The crack live file has an empty icon which means it can't open in any program, so not in Terminal also. Normally with cracks, the icon should be the same as the original live icon. Does anyone else had this problem?"

,REDJELLYNINJA,2011-02-16T00:57Z,"The software runs fine..... in demo mode but the authorizing file 100% will not work on a powerpc G5 mac. 
I've tried every single method suggested on this torrent and others and still not working. 
Searched the web for an auth code that works but it seems that it does not exist.
 Its bad enough that the software developers have gave up on powerpc, now the guys that are cracking our fav programs (who do a fantastic job in doing that btw) seem to not bother with us anymore. 
Speaking on behalf of all the ppc ableton users that cannot get this working fully, can someone please sort out an auth that we can use??? You will be hailed a God by us all.
I don't want to go back to 7!!!"
,popiraves,2011-02-25T07:45Z,how do u replace live?
,Tasty90,2011-03-26T21:28Z,"Okay guys, here's how to fix the ""Authorization Invalid"" problem.

1: Close live. 
2: Inside Live/Contents/MacOS/Live, double click on the ""Live"" file. This will open terminal, say a bunch of stuff, then it will open the actual Live program. 
3: Click on the Authorize81Mac file again.
4: It should lag for a bit, then tell you everything has been unlocked!

So the key is closing the application, clicking on the Live file AGAIN (the one INSIDE the application, not the actual application file), and then clicking on the Authorization file AGAIN.


BAM!"

,jimmy3legs,2011-09-04T05:10Z,"Ok, for all of u having trouble with the authorization, here is what I did to fix the issue...
When u open up the ""live"" file following the previous instructions, the terminal should run and open the program, then when you get the message that says ""invalid authorization file"" click authorize later and quit live (leave the terminal open).
Next, open up the .auz file and it will run live and you should get the authorization to work at this point."

,Watto6275,2012-05-04T07:38Z,"Just to clear up for a few people who might have the same problems I did:

If you've already downloaded the free trial of Ableton Live 8 and haven't authorised it, opening ""Authorize81Mac.auz"" will open that, rather than the one you've installed here. You have to delete the previous trial that you downloaded.

Secondly, with the ""The present cannot be loaded. It is pobably broken."" message, I found this was also a problem with the fact that I'd installed the trial before this. If you go into preferences, hit Library and then click Repair Library then it sorts it all out and you're good to go."
,thadisrad,2012-05-09T20:44Z,has anyone gotten this to work with OSX 10.5.8?  I keep getting an invalid authorization message.
,arvtg,2012-07-03T10:23Z,"To anyone else for whom it doesn't work, please note the following. I am a complete newbie to this and I followed DJ_LG's instructions and it worked perfectly for me. I was also initially confused as the live file in the crack folder was a text file and was opening in text editor the first time I tried. But then I realized I replaced the wrong file.

There are two live files, one in 'Live 8.1 Osx/Live.app'. When you right click on this file, show package contents, and follow path 'Contents/MacOS', there is another Live file in this folder. this is the one which needs to be replaced. Once replaced, you can copy over authorize81mac into this same folder, open this live text file (it will automatically open in terminal) and follow DJ_LG's instructions from there. Ableton should work after that. Hope this helps. "
