With Virtual CD you can not only create and use virtual CDs, but also burn virtual CDs and DVDs. Regardless of whether you yourself would like to test a created DVD, to put together an audio CD or just not happen to have a blank disk for a data CD at hand, with Virtual CD you always have a burner with a blank disk that you can use from any program. You can use the CDs or DVDs created in this manner immediately with Virtual CD and burn them on a physical medium, if necessary.


Using the expanded quick start program, you can nearly use any Virtual CD function without having to start the Virtual CD Management or the toolbox. With a simple left click on the Virtual CD symbol you arrive at the program menu where you can utilize all important Virtual CD functions. On the other hand, if you click on the symbol with the right mouse key, the drive menu opens. Here you can e.g. insert and eject images or insert blank CDs in the virtual burner.

Not only does Virtual CD serve you with its well-engineered ergonomy, but it also keeps the security of your data in mind. To protect sensitive data and to keep files confidential, you can use a virtual DVD RAM blank CD as an encrypted fixed disk with up to 17.5 GB. After entering your password, you can read and write your data on it as if you were using a regular fixed disk. In the background, Virtual CD codes the data on-thy-fly with the safe AES 256bit-encryption without your noticing anything.
From now on you can use Virtual CD also under Vista and 64-bit Windows operating system.

Functions

- "Data safe" mode
With the new data safe mode, encrypted drives can be created automatically. This makes it easy to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Encrypted drives do not differ from ordinary drives in operation or handling.

- Sound file mode
Virtual CD 10 enables fast conversion of any audio file type into the flexible and widely used MP3 and OGG Vorbis formats. The user can determine the desired quality for all formats.

- Direct burning functions
The revised Editor in Version 10 has a media-burning function that lets you burn your choice of data directly onto a CD, DVD or Blu-ray Disc. Thus one slender burning program serves all
your needs.

- Expanded ISO support
Virtual CD 10 lets you store descriptions, comments and passwords with your ISO files. This means you have practically the same level of convenience with standardized ISO files that you have with genuine Virtual CD images.

- Flexible allocation of images to drives
Starting now, images can also be "inserted" in any physical drive
- Integrating external programs
You can now integrate external programs in the Virtual CD interface, both in the Quick Launch menu and in CD Management. You can also pass arguments on the command line when a program is called, for easy automation of tasks.

- Extended API
The Virtual CD API for professional and semi-professional use has once again been expanded and improved. Now it is even easier to use external programs to control and operate Virtual CD.
