Proxy finding software i made for my own personal use, not designed for other people however it shouldnt be hard to use and i added in a few things to help out. 

this was put up for the purpose of helping anyone who needs a large list of (mostly) working proxies in a short time. it does not test them, however if i think its worth it i might add that in. also, it does NOT check for duplicates from the sources. the way its designed however, there should only be a max of 2 per proxy per list, if at all. it saves it in RAW format (IP:PORT).


i would LOVE some sort of feedback, anything at all. you love it, you hate it, it works good, it doesnt work, even a thanks. 


****!!!! THIS REQUIRES .NET FRAMEWORK!!! PROBABLY!!!

NOTE: NO CHECKER INCLUDED (again). proxys have about a 25% success rate AT ANY ONE TIME. i use a program that rotates and ive seen that some are up at different times.
