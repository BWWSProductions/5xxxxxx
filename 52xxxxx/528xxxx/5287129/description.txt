In Nancy Drew: Danger By Design, you'll take Nancy undercover in a prestigious fashion design studio in Paris. The lead designer, Minette, hasn't quite been herself lately. She hides behind a white mask and often throws tantrums, even firing several employees. Mysterious threats arrive at the old windmill studio and other troubles lurk in the underbelly of the City of Light. Can you help Minette release her latest clothing line on time? Or will your sleuthing abroad meet an unfashionable end?
