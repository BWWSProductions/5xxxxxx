"The innocence of youth is shattered by the turbulence of war in this poignant tale of a remarkable friendship. Konradin, an ambassador's son and Hans, the son of a Jewish doctor, meet in Germany in 1932. The boys are immediately drawn to each other and share hours of exploring, laughing, talking and dreaming. But political events soon interfere with normal boyhood pursuits as Hitler's rise to power goes unchecked. Konradin is ashamed to find himself growing uneasy about his friendship with the Jewish boy. When Hans is sent from Stuttgart to America for safety by his parents, the boys say reluctant and fearful farewell. Fifty years later, Hans returns to Germany to search for the memories he left behind and his friend Konradin. What he finds will touch your heart." With Jason Robards and Christien Anholt  -  120 Minutes
