A 23-minute hard rock fantasy epic about one young man's battle against goblins, a vampire, and banality...

"Beyond the mists of memory,
and all shores now traveled,
heroes rode at nightfall
in search of High Adventure.

Also, there were princesses and wizards and
things like dwarves
and other things like that.

Prepare thouselves..."

THE MINSTREL CYCLE consists of five brave musical adventurers from Chicago, USA, who conceived of their quest in 2004, and, five short years later, have carried it out. "The Legend of the Book-Looker" is the first side, and first song, of their first LP, "Tales from the Books of Lore". Spearheaded by Steve Kozak and Evan Burrows of the band CAW! CAW! during a break from tour, the album was recorded in basements and attics around Chicago. "The Legend of the Book-Looker" also features guest appearances by fellow CAW! CAW! members Dan Rico and Timothy Tsurutani, and cover artist Liz Born.

This is a 320 kbps mp3 sourced from the original lossless multitrack.

A limited edition cassette edition of the album will be released by the Slanty Shanty Records Tape Club in spring 2010, shipping worldwide!
