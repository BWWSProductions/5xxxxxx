Well this has the exact same description as Armageddon so I am guessing its a waste of time as well. If you want the true specs click on the Armageddon torrent where I pasted the specs of these videos.

If you do want LoTR this is the torrent you should be getting:

Not sure what your problem is, but you dont have to dl anything I upload. Just trying to help those that don't have the movies yet. Here is the screenshot you wanted. By the way I have played these files on Iphone 3g, 3gs, psp and the 3 ipods I have. They all work. You would know that if you had any of those.

,BLiZzZAgA,2010-01-16T08:06Z,Sorry about that. I usually only watch the first 10 minutes of my rips. I'll redo it and post the fellowship in a single torrent.
,BLiZzZAgA,2010-01-17T09:36Z,I tried re-ripping it 3x. Same result. Don't know why. I have to rent a copy and try again.
