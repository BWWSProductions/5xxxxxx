Sods law....we brought you a sweet TS and the bloody DVDSCR comes out lol.

Anyway we thought we'd have ago at doing our own dvdscr rip so here it is.

We used nokias dvdr for this and kept the AC3 audio that was on it.......video didn't need tweaking too much but needed borders cropped,resize and fix AR afterwards.....anyway enjoy a better copy.

Oh yes property of now and again throughout.....
