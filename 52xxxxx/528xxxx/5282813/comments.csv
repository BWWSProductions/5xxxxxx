,victortango,2010-09-26T03:39Z,"it's not a chick flick, retards! it's been actually applauded for some very interesting moments of dialog. 

A secret love affair begins between 23 year-old English poet, John Keats (Ben Whishaw), and the girl next door, Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish), an out-spoken student of high fashion. This unlikely pair begin at odds, he thinking her a stylish minx, while she was unimpressed not only by his poetry but also by literature in general."

,ytsejam420,2011-12-31T18:57Z,"@ Rubyet , they're .srt files which can easily be disabled when viewing the movie. "
,mebfeath,2012-04-10T09:17Z,"@ytsejam420, how do you disable the .srt files?"
