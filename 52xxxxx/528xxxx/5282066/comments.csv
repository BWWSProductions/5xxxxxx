[T],gamerguuy,2010-01-17T15:38Z,sorry secret_myth i think something is wrong with my computer.Sorry to blame you but anyways do you think it's the codecs that is making it happen.
[T],gamerguuy,2010-01-17T15:47Z,nevermind.My k-lite codec pack was corrupted so i uninstalled it and reinstalled it again.:)Cheers bro

,GhostMonster,2010-01-19T02:33Z,"Can anyone tell me how to sync the vid and sound?  I've tried 5 times to install the player, which shouldn't even be necessary, and it's still out of sync by 5 + seconds."
,ChillyCrossFoot,2010-01-20T10:12Z,"Using VLC, Audio Out of Sync 
Using Mplayer Home Cinema, same thing.

Using CoreAVC 2.0 with Haali Media Splitter and FFDShow Audio Decorder for AAC. 

What is the problem? Why is it out of Sync? First time I've had this issue with your releases!"

,Risket,2010-02-10T18:17Z,"@z00t.z00t  I got an email from my ISP about a previous Saw 6 download about a month ago. I use Vidalia and Tor and I use IP Filter Updater often to update blocked IPs, so I was pretty surprised they still tracked me. The worst part was the quality of the video I downloaded was a terrible theater-cam version >< Hopefully this download will be better. I couldn't believe the one time I got caught, was with the shittiest quality download that I didn't even keep. "
,QoMSoL,2010-03-16T15:45Z,"@ lil000
Kid, I believe you confused the donwloading of free stuff here with some holy war. So bite me and f**k off!
I just said that audio is out of sync and some people confirmed that too. Buuuuuuut at the same time there really might be a problem with K-lite pack cuz I encountered the smae problem with different downloads (not from SM too) but they went fine even through WMP. So obviously there are some issues in the last two K-lite pack releases.
P.S. BTW the problem with the other release of SM was not with the sound. It just had picture corrupted in several places."
