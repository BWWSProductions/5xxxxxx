,breaker01,2010-01-19T15:50Z,"CAN ANYONE PUT THE ENGLISH SUBS UP ON PIRATE BAY PLS, BEEN SEARCHING THE NET FOR THEM WITH NO JOY ,THANKS"
,HacKaPeLL,2010-01-19T20:18Z,"Is the movie worth watching with Subs??
Looking at the poster i feel they'll be no Guns in a movie related to 'Bodyguards' and 'Assassins'. Even if they have guns they'll be fake.
Movie looks kinda old, 1900s?? "

Looks like you are not familiar with martial arts movies...

,ToniSoto,2010-01-23T19:54Z,"found a legit torrent site that claims to have the eng subs. unfortunately did not have any luck with peers to actually get it. but it might still be worth a shot, just in case. http://www.asiatorrents.com just check it out."
,ToniSoto,2010-01-23T20:02Z,"just found the eng subs on http://subscene.com/Bodyguards-and-Assassins-Shi-yue-wei-cheng/subtitles-80791.aspx. Tried them already, seem to be fine, although it would be somewhat technically unfeasible for me to validate their authenticity since I happen to know only a couple of words in chinese. Any asian out there to check it out and confirm whether these are good?"
,ToniSoto,2010-01-23T22:08Z,"well i'll be damned. am i the only 1 concerned here? watched the 1st half then as soon as I started watching the 2nd part I realized there were no subs at all. Some1 is either playing some sort of a sick joke or they're simply plain stupid for uploading an incomplete sub file. Some1 please respond. Desperate to c this movie till the end since it is of a very fine quality, and I don't just mean it visually wise."
,breaker01,2010-01-23T23:35Z,"raymondhome a vip has just put the subs up for this movie. time 22.34 date 23rd jan, on recent torrents, go  get em chaps. PLS SUPPORT HAITI  like the man sez were all 1 big family."

,CSuk,2010-01-28T21:14Z,"Oops! Forget what I just said above. I should have read the notes/comments before I dived in with mine :)
Thanks to raymondhome for putting subtitles up."

,adaa24a4,2010-03-12T00:48Z,What is the guys name that played Master Liu in this movie?? Cant find it anwhere
,snowbirds,2011-10-23T08:24Z,"a great up if you grab those subtitles

BUT OF MY FUCKING GOD, what a bloated piece of crap for a movie.  I have never seen a martial arts flick with more slow-motion shots of men crying than this one.  Most of the movie is a bunch of soap opera drama, with some fight scenes thrown in every half hour or so.

Hey China, if you want to make nationalist propaganda drivel, make it a national TV show.  Stop wasting the world's time with these 3 hour long tear-jerkers, trying to convince your people what a wonderful place they live in.

JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!!

okay, i feel a little better now....."
,snowbirds,2011-10-23T08:32Z,"Oh, and while I'm complaining, why the hell won't people make subtitles that translate the notes that appear on the screen at various times???

This movie starts with a long written note, and has a dozen or so notes that appear on the screen at various times to explain something.  I don't know what they said 'cause I don't fucking read Chinese!  No wonder the movie made no fucking sense half the time.

Here's a clue for all you translators:  if I don't understand Chinese when I hear it spoken, then I sure as fuck don't fucking read Chinese either!!  
Does this make any fucking sense to you???

okay...  yeah, feeling much better now...  Peace on earth, y'all..."
