NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

Here we go again with another screener... This time we bring you a very nice screener of Sherlock Holmes 2009

Thanks to our friend ineedmy for the files... Thx bro... ;)

Where to begin... The source is a very nice source to begin with, so we really only needed to touch this up here and there. There are occasional watermarks but not for long so we elected to just leave them.

The normal things where done to this release, the video its self was a little dark so we adjusted the contrast, lum, colors and sharpened it a tad to make it look just that much better... Audio is AC3 to keep that nice crisp sound while watching!!!

You can decide for yourselves as always there is a sample provided.
