[V],twentyforty,2010-01-15T15:25Z,"@htctouch: Google search term is
Joey Season 1,2 DVDRip.x264 (60MB)
On one page you have all episodes of both seasons.
Bookmark this page. Click and download one by one."

,lilars26,2010-01-15T17:38Z,Thanx 20/40.Very good download speed too.
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-15T18:07Z,"@htctouch: My friend, I always forget that you know nothing, and I must use simpler language:

OK, have you learned how to copy some text from one place to another? One can MARK some text going with cursor over it holding the left mouse button pressed. OK? So, go on such way over the first line - address where first episode is stored. This portion of text must change the color - that's called ""marking the text"". Immediately after press the right mouse button and in drop-down list choose ""Copy"". Then move the cursor in ""Address"" window of your browser and press right mouse button. Choose ""Paste"". OK? By doing that our marked line of the text is copied and pasted in address window, and then you press ""Enter"" or click on ""Go"" what transfers you on download page.

Repeat such procedure for every line - one episode in the rar archive. Extract the archive after the download. Play such .mkv audio/video file as you usually do for Matroska files.

When you asked for help, I have found that page and I have checked if the links are OK. And yes, they are OK and good because I've checked them again few moments before I wrote this lines.

@lilars: Thank you. Today is ""busy"" day."
,mdaddio,2010-01-15T19:12Z,"Thanks, i really appreciate the size, and appreciate the work you do."
,htctouch,2010-01-15T19:49Z,"lolz..sir im not tht dumb..i knw copying n stuff
m just new to the torrents.
sory 4 not being specific..the problm a mesg while goin through rshr link i.e
Unfortunately right now our servers are overloaded and we have no more download slots left for non-members. Of course you can also try again later.
[i dont hv a premium acnt on r.share] iv also tried downloadin through rhare downloader tool by majorshrdotcom..but no use"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-15T20:07Z,"@htctouch: Don't get me wrong, my friend, but how should I know who you are and what and how much do you know?
Only thing I can I have done - ""read"" (decipher) what do you trying to say. I do not know other ways and do this even better than I should.

You have said: ""i tried tht but links arent working .""

What else can come across? I have pointed you how to do it - because links are fine.
But - IF you know the matter, you'll know that rshr servers are busy - and one should just - wait. 

I do it everyday. To get free access. And I am patient with RSHR as I am patient over the top with you but:

consider this case closed."
,htctouch,2010-01-15T20:17Z,"yeh thts y sir i said sory 4 not being specific

,blushroom,2010-01-16T09:19Z,"here you go htctouch - http://www.divxturka.net/series-tv-shows/472215-joey-season-12-dvdripx264-60mb.html, as these are rs links get an automatic downloader like jdownloader or cryptload or if you have premium then youre a lucky bastard. and p.s. 2040 your torrents rule, you are like the poor bandwidth mans king, if that makes any sense. im a big fan of your torrents since mininova, seriously man the resolution you get is awesome"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-16T09:33Z,"@blushroom: Thank you for doing that, 'cause I cannot. Day ago I wrote almost exactly the same, but such words and links cannot be posted by uploaders and such comment text was rejected by database three times... 
For other kind words - thank you very much."
