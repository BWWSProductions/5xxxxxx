,LoLong,2010-01-18T16:12Z,"Right ;-), which one of these 2 sound more likely: 
1) John Coleman(retired 75 years old with the journalism degree) is correct in claim thousands scientists are perpetrating a hoax.
2) Thousands of phd scientists, after decades of research, correctly conclude GW IS real, and Coleman is one of the numerous egotistical idiots which infest our planet."

,k3nd00d,2010-02-13T12:04Z,"Note how so much of the supposed settled AGW science has now been proven to not be science but based on WWF propaganda, hiking magazine articles, telephone interview statements known to be spurious, student papers and intentionally fudged math. If you want to know these details, let me know. I know a web radio show that has covered the MSM news coverage about this coming from the top UK online newspapers...or search for yourself.

I suspect new AGW counter propaganda videos on you-tube likely have been covering this too. Not like you can expect our US controlled media to cover it and with honesty. Even the GOP news channel (fox) is not adequately doing so. But then its owner (Rupert Murdoch) also owns AGW theory fraud friendly media in other countries (making fox what is known as ""controlled opposition"")."
,ArtieT,2011-07-20T11:05Z,"Man, I'm so sorry to see you spreading this nonsense. Forget the tangled web of conspiracy that has emerged from the deception for a minute and answer this honestly: 

If you come across a theory which supports your position but completely contradicts theories you previously believed, what do you do? A scientist would discuss, and conclude more research necessary to really decide which is correct. In fact, anyone with any curiosity would do the same, because having inconsistent internal logic is intellectually unsatisfying, isn't it? 

So what do denialist 'blog scientists' do? Why, post a blog immediately and make no reference to the contradiction, claiming this really is THE PROOF!

Denialists on forums do this ALL THE TIME, sometimes even in the same sentence. They repeat the same discredited 'zombie arguments', even when repeatedly corrected, like the most cynical, opportunistic politician. They argue in the most appalling trollish way, evading and lying, volte-facing and desperately saying anything to get the last word and 'win' by whatever means.

I say this all as a warning. You don't want to go down that road, my friends. It's an insult to your intelligence."
