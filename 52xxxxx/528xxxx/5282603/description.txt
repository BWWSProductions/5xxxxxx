Features of The HTML Editor:

    * Website Projects help keep your Website organized, all but eliminating broken links and incorrectly referenced images.
    * The built-in Validate HTML tool opens the W3C markup validation service in your default Web browser.
    * HTML and CSS code completion virtually eliminates unclosed or incorrectly typed tags.
    * The Tags tab is a comprehensive reference for (X)HTML, PHP, and CSS tags.
    * Certain characters have to be formatted as HTML entities in order to render properly. The Characters tab lets you insert these entities with a click of your mouse.
    * Cross-browser compatibility is important, so the HTML Editor gives you the option to add up to 10 different browsers and then open them from inside the program.
    * Split-Screen Preview lets you view your Webpage in a browser right from inside the Code Editor.
    * Looking for something? Use the Search bar, located conveniently in the Toolbar.
    * We improved the Extended Find and Replace function. Would you believe it's about 85% faster than before?
    * Check out the new CSS Menu Builder. It creates awesome CSS navigation menus for your Webpages. These menus look great, work in any browser, and are easily customizable.
    * The HTML Editor comes with 10 new, professionally designed themes. Preview them before you apply them to your pages in the snazzy new Theme Chooser.
    * We completely overhauled the help manual. The new document is packed with tutorials, FAQs, a comprehensive glossary, and easy-to-understand explanations of each and every program feature.
    * Typing the same code over and over again wastes time and, frankly, can be a bit boring. But with the Code Snippets tool, you can save your commonly used code and insert it on your page with a click of your mouse. The program also comes with several built-in code snippets to help get you started.
    * Spelling mistakes and typos are a thing of the past with our spell-check feature. The HTML Editor checks for errors as you type â€” all you have to do is right-click the selection for the correct spelling.
    * Add custom spell-check dictionaries for error-free code in any language.
