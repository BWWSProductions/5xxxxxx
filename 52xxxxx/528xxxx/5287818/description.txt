The entire criminal underworld is pursuing a gun that never misses.  Catwoman considers the firearm to be the score of a lifetime, which will put her at the top of the criminal heirarchy, affirming forever her reputation as Queen of Thieves.  All she needs to do is keep the gun out of the hands of rival criminal factions.  But she has one more competitor: the Batman, who wants the weapon out of circulation permanently!

Written by Ann Nocenti (Daredevil) and illustrated by Ethan Van Sciver (New X-Men).
