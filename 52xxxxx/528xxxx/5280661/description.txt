The original Rush 24/7 Media Center for Windows.  For those who hate iTunes for downloading the daily podcasts.  Unavailable from Rush's website for quite some time.

Just installed into Windows 7, but it required Administrator permission to do so.  Shows up in firewall as Premiere Radio Networks.
