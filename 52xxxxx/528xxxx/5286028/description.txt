Luar na Lubre is a celtic music ensemble from Galicia.

Luar is Galician for moonlight; lubre is a magical forest in which the Celtic druids cast their spells.

This is the record which really took the group to fame. MIKE OLDFIELD's influence together with the fact that the groups was signed up by the multinational label (WARNER) took the group to the heights of its fame with successful tours all over Spain. So far over 50,000 copies of the record have been sold, making it one of the few Galician groups with a gold record. It is worth repeating that thanks to this record the group has not only been very well received by the critics but has also been awarded several important prizes.
