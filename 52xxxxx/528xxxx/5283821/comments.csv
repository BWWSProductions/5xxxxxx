,Compizfoxx,2010-01-31T20:27Z,"It's not cracked, its just the beta. (Or needs the beta also a key?)"
,PhilnLisa,2010-02-01T02:59Z,"Thankyou, but it's asking for a product key for activation....Otherwise you have to put up with a bright red bar accross the top of the screen whinging about how it's not activated...
for some reason if you click the ""learn how to activate"" link it provides you with  3 different keys, but niether work...

Anyone spread any light on this?"
,pappabagge,2010-02-03T14:24Z,"Works perfectly with Win 7 Ultimate 64-bit. No serial prompting or other issues, just great."
,jando19,2010-02-04T00:53Z,"Since ?Blue Edition? is only intended for OEMs and not for retail sale, you can accurately anticipate that it?s also the only version where there is no need for a serial, and do not need an activation. Other than this, the Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Blue Edition resembles all the features of standard Office 2007 Enterprise Edition, the most complete Microsoft toolset provided for people who must collaborate with others and work with information efficiently, regardless of location or network status.

,PoshRocks,2010-02-05T22:05Z,Works perfectlyeebiejeebies! (Perfectly!!)
,lostshadow13,2010-02-06T02:02Z,Works Like a charm thank you
,ubichild,2010-02-06T21:33Z,"This is BULLSHIT.

It is the Beta version (what else could it be), BUT IS NOT ACTIVATED, nor Pre-Cracked...

You can't even use the keys that Microsoft is publishing when you download from their site.

Don't dl this shit. I had to uninstall it and install the legit beta from Microsoft website.

It's far better (faster and safer) to get Office 2010 from Microsoft website. You can use the Beta version for free until OCTOBER 2010.

Fuck these assholes... who are these retards that say ""thanks, this works great""? must be k-kid clones for sure..."

,bryaca,2010-02-08T07:15Z,Great download! I only had one problem. For what ever reason I could get my blackberry calender to sync with outlook. 
,iHacker0325,2010-02-09T02:32Z,"blackberry are shitty, mine wouldn't sync either, but seriously why download this bullshit just grab it from ms and make 100 % it's legit"
,jfhorseman,2010-02-09T18:24Z,"WOW fast download 9.5 minutes @ avg.  1.4MB/s !!!!!!! 
Scanned with three AV applications and found it clean. 
Un-rared it and D&D it to a memory stick and installed it on an old Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop with XP-pro SP3, 32 bit. The installation went flawlessly, except that it does hesitate for a minutes about two thirds of the way through the installation. I think however the 2007 version that I installed a while back did the same thing.  It updates @ Microsoft update with no problems.
I?m not sure why others have had problems but I had none. My thanks to Kentucky- Kid for the up.

I will continue to seed for a while."
,FalconnerF16,2010-02-10T13:20Z,"Upon installation..., after you have chosen the components that you want to install and press install..., it will work for a couple of seconds after which a browser pops up asking you for the installation source folder!

As the browser already locates you to the installation source folder you press OK and it seems to continue to install, but after a couple of seconds it asks you again->where to install it from!(if you try any other folder it won't work), and this seems to repeat forever while the progress bar remains empty...!

If there's anyone that had the same thing, or having a solution for this, please give us an idea!

Thank you!"
,chivafut11,2010-02-10T22:18Z,It didnt Work for me
,yoppix,2010-02-13T07:43Z,could not open anymore the control panel as windows explorer stops working. restored at an earlier time but the same error persist. any solution kk?
,donkeydick121,2010-02-13T21:54Z,"This installed on my XP Pro SP3 without a hitch.

But I do not think it's right that you call it the Blue edition when you know full well it's beta.

You call it pre-cracked but you know this is wrong for the same reason."
,hootsies,2010-02-16T17:14Z,"Yeah,so how do i solve this?
Using it for a month and now i get an error message saying it's X number of days left to activate.
Give me another version of this,please!"

,thunder_god,2010-02-18T14:26Z,THIS IS WORKING GOOD..... YET IT IS NOT OTHER THAN THE BETA VERSION WITH THE SERIAL NUMBER FOR THE BETA ACTIVATION PREINSTALLED!!!!!
,luftwaffa,2010-02-23T14:21Z,"Hey so couple of things happening which I wanted to check if anyone else is seeing. It installed and is working well, so no complaints there, I'm thinking its more of a microsoft thing...

In outlook when I click in the search box above my emails it pops up a little window saying installing for a couple of seconds, then it goes away and works normally. Any ideas or anyone else getting this? Doesn't make sense to install the search algo each time we want to use it!

Also, outlook is heavy on the processor, using about 12% continuous at idle, when it shouldn't be doing anything. Its not send/receiving or processing anything in the background as far as I can tell. I noticed this as it was making the fan on my laptop run... Is this normal?

Cheers!"

,GODZRUS,2010-06-06T04:49Z,"I should of looked further before downloading.  Yes, it is the beta.  I do not know the expiration on it as I am not sure where to look.  I did this as an upgrade to my cracked copy of Office 2007.  I do use Outlook for my main e-mail.  With this expiring at some point I wonder how much trouble I will have backing the Outlook 2010 to Outlook 2007.  I did not do a backup of outlook before installing.....I know, bad rookie mistake.  LOL  Thanks for the upload though."
