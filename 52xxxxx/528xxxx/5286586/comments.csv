,GetTheMusic,2010-01-18T19:37Z,"Wynardtage is very good. I had a few of those songs, but never got around to getting any of that music yet.

I still have about 20 more Best Of collections to upload though. So much more music is still on the way. I just have so much music to go through, it makes my head spin.

I will have new uploads each week. In fact, I'm finishing up another music upload right now that will be ready in a day or two."
