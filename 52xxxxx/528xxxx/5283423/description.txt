This is a re-upload from another Torrent Site(d-addicts.com).

I really liked the Original Manga version of this Video, so I shared this here on Piratebay.

For those who want to read the Original Story of the Manga, visit this page:

This Video is a bit out from the Original Story, but still it remains the same story.

I'll update this torrent if there's some changes.
Thanks, and please SEED this
