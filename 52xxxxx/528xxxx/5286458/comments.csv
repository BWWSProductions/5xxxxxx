,DL3688,2010-01-21T04:37Z,"Horrible quality. Downloaded and its in a foreign language, horrible static squeal and shit sound quality... I'm not a liar, I'm not trying to trick people in to not downloading it, maybe I have done something wrong, all I know this copy is bullshit on my side."
,DL3688,2010-01-21T04:38Z,"correction, its not in a foreign language, but the coded sound is turned up so loud, no matter how low I set my volume it's staticy and ear shattering frequencies."
,haidaboy,2010-01-21T06:46Z,"I found this to be a high quality download.  

It is a screener and says something about the disc being the responsibility of the user at the beginning, but the image and sound quality is 10/10 in my opinion....In other words DVD quality.

,Manly Stump,2010-01-24T14:36Z,"I don't know what JBNyen and DL3688 are talking about, but this is a DVD screener, and a very good quality. Just a notice that pops up on screen every now and then, but you won't find any better than that available for a long time."
,Mr.Brow,2010-01-31T23:51Z,Thanks!
,ammayoga,2010-02-04T15:45Z,"PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT IT MEANS WHEN SAYS ''THAT URL IS ALREADY AN EXTERNAL DOWNLOAD, IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DOWNLOADED'' KEEP GETTING THIS FOR EVERYTHING.....DON'T HAVE A CLUE"
,iamneo33,2010-03-07T18:44Z,"How to tell a fake!!

1 - seeders are more than leachers

2 - A million comments about how great the quality is(screeners are not ever great)

3 - 10 other torrents come out at the exact same time, the exact same size, having the exact same comments

4 - screen shots that seem to be accepted and never disappear on public websites

5 -When these fake torrents are released, for some reason they have +1000 seeds instantly

Is this torrent fake? Tracked? Use these common sense clarifiers. The movie industry obviously does not use common sense...

Take care and Download safe...
