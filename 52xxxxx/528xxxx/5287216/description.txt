The series airs on Showcase Canada.

The resolution is 608x352 and while the quality is not as good as a scene release due to my capture and encoding methods it is quite watchable in my opinion.


Series Info: Described as a cross between The Office and The Sopranos by the show's creator, Malcolm MacRury (ZOS: Zone of Separation, Deadwood), Cra$h & Burn follows Jimmy Burn, a young claims adjuster for a cut-throat, bottom-line insurance corporation.

Casting also features Leela Savasta (Battlestar Galactica, Intelligence) as Lucia Silva, Jimmy's live-in girlfriend; Caroline Cave (The L Word, This Beautiful City) as Catherine Scott, a shrewd yet practical in-house insurance lawyer; Clark Johnson (The Wire, Homicide: Life on the Street, also an Emmy-nominated director on The Shield) as Walker Hearn, a veteran insurance investigator and Steve Bacic (The Guard, Andromeda) as Korkov, a conman and Mafioso hustling to scam the system.
