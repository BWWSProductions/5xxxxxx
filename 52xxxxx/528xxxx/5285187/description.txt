War has come down on Calradia  and war attracts its own bunch of misfits. Mercenaries, cutthroats, knights and adventurers flood into the land looking for adventure, fortune and glory. But war is a harsh master. It gives away death and grief to the lot, fortune to a chosen few, and glory, wise men say, to none. Still, men ride to war, for one or other reason. Some because they are looking for thrill and excitement, some because they are desperate and know no other way. Some because they are so bitter and hateful that they are willing to unleash doom on earth... And yet some, because they are the very heroes who will step forward to stop that...
