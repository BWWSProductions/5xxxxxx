,aioshi1,2010-01-18T11:15Z,subs not working! 
,sharpsponge,2010-01-21T11:14Z,"ditto, subs don't work. They're the wrong format: sfv instead of srt"
,sharpsponge,2010-01-21T11:18Z,this file for English subs is working fine for me: http://www.allsubs.org//subs-download/thirst-2009-bestdivx/1179058/
,eremite,2010-01-22T07:51Z,"sfv is not a sub format, it's for software that checks your download against a record of the original file."
,eremite,2010-01-22T12:31Z,"That said, there is something wrong with the sub files in the archives.  The link sharpsponge posted works, though."
,teladoy,2010-01-22T23:13Z,so do what sharpsponge say
