Developed over a two-month period, Luke Temple's self-titled debut under his new moniker is a remarkable departure from his signature singer-songwriter material. Many of the songs pulse with infectious Afro-beat and Krautrock-influenced grooves, calling to mind classic albums like Remain in the Light and Graceland. In contrast, the instrumental tracks conjure mystical landscapes reminiscent of Popol Vuh's ambience.
