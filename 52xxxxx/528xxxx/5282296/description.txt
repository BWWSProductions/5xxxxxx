Every Thursday at 7:30pm Israel time, our television channel YES â€“ 66 airs a live broadcast of the show â€œAsk the Kabbalist.â€ The show is simultaneously translated to English, Spanish and Russian. I invite everyone to watch it and to ask questions at 1-700-509-209 or at www.kab.tv/eng

"We influence Nature (the Creator) with the power of our thoughts. This is how we intervene in the Plan of our development, and in return we receive the same influence we caused and altered.

If all of us together direct our thoughts toward goodness, we will change our fate. Right now every person thinks in his own favor, against others; therefore, our thoughts donâ€™t converge into one, good thought, but evoke mutually destructive consequences.

In other words, Natureâ€™s (the Creatorâ€™s) Plan for our development is neutral in and of itself. Itâ€™s us who improve and accelerate, or, on the contrary, delay and worsen Its influence on us with our desires, thoughts, and intentions. Our entire choice lies in choosing which path to take: the short and good path, or the lengthy and evil one"

Rav Michael Laitman
