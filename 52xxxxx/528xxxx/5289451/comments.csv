,46664,2010-12-04T08:02Z,"Terrible torrent, only two seeders and they've only downloaded 8%"
,BloodBay,2012-05-12T03:01Z,"well maybe if people woud stop being thieving whores and actually seed, then nobody would have this problem -_- plus i have downloded postal or postal 2 about this size before and it worked fine with a few hundred seeders and about maybe 50 leechers? i dont remember.. BUT, i digress. This torrent would be decent if people could seed :) even if they have to wait 49375 days 16:30:09 (i had that time few years ago and its still not done seeding xD)"
