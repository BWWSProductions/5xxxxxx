Lady Libertine (also known as Frank and I) is a 1983 soft core erotic film by GÃ©rard KikoÃ¯ne. This Playboy production, released theatrically in Europe and on television in the US, is an adaptation of the Victorian novel (1902) Frank and I by Bill Adler. French actress turned famous TV host Sophie Favier unsuccessfully sued to stop its release.

GÃ©rard KikoÃ¯ne had quite a large budget for this film and was assisted by French set designer Jean-Charles Dedieu. Therefore production values are quite good, especially since they involve a lot of period costumes and sets. Jennifer Inch is playing the role of Frank, the orphan boy, and of Frances. Sophie Favier plays the role of the mistress of Charles de Beaumont.
