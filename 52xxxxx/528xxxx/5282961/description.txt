This is a fixed version of my previous torrent of the same name
In this version, I remade the making of and Arc3 multi and they now work.
Tested each eboot under CFW 5.00 M33-6

I do not have a save file of Arc the Lad III at the end of disc 1 to verify the disc switching works. But to do the disc switch, when the game prompts you, hit the home button, go to switch discs and choose the second disc.

I will be putting up another torrent with the programs and files as well as a tutorial on how to take your ps1 memorycard saves and transfer them to the psp in a compatible format.
