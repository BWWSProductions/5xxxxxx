,YeahCain,2010-02-14T03:12Z,"i accidently set my resolution to somthing i cant display, can annoyone help me out with returning it to normal? this torrent worked well for me, nothing wrong, except for a few servers, but im not paying for it so what should i expect? fast load times , glitchy load time ( like 5seconds longer) first server of the day, im running an XP 3.2GHZ dual processor, with a (your going to laugh :P) 64mb buisness graphics card and it worked fine, some big leves like aztec dropped my frame rate though. deffo a 5/5 download with the amount of seeders on for me, cheers"
,varna_81,2010-02-14T22:35Z,I was wondering why my torrent has just one seed :) but now i know ... you just reupload it ... tnx for that :PPP

,thomas003,2010-03-14T19:11Z,"Damn STEAM VALIDATION REJECTED! I have tried i 15 min now, and still dont find any working servers..."
,stxstx,2010-03-24T17:08Z,"STEAM VALIDATION REJECTED! 
omg how can u be so supid, it means that this server can be played only if u buy CSS.. if you dont want to buy it you just have to play in nonsteam servers, just look in the internet for some IP-s."
