Please be aware that someone is anonymously uploading 
torrents to The Pirate Bay that duplicate my torrent
names and copy-paste my descriptions.

An example is here: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5285597/Alex_Jones_Show_-_2010_Jan_15_FR_%5Bsebaygo1%5D

THESE ARE NOT MINE AND I HAVE NO IDEA 
WHAT THEY MAY CONTAIN!!!

If you have any doubt about whether a torrent is 
legitimately one of mine, please go here:

Thank you.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
