                    Costume drama. When a Lark Rise tree starts to  
                    'bleed', the hamlet becomes rife with talk of  
                     witchcraft. Thomas is horrified - this could  
                     ruin the visit of the Bishop who is coming to  
                     consecrate the church font. The witch tree  
                     seems to cast a spell over the whole community  
                     - everyone is behaving strangely. Even Dorcas  
                     loses her composure and makes a blunder with  
                     terrible consequences for Pearl and Ruby.  
                     Laura, too, is thrown off balance when  
                     Daniel returns to try and win back her  
                     affections.
