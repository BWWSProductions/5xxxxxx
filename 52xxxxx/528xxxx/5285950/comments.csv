did i miss something?"

It seems you do not have the previous version of 1.2.7. please install that one. here's my v1.2.7 torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5450330

,oOoLukaoOo,2012-06-12T12:37Z,"hello~~ im new here so uhmmm lemme try to help

@rogugu i think its because its regional so i ended up uninstalling and reinstalling the whole game but anyway i think there's a way to change the region your in so you can patch it without the error code, something like editing the registry, but if you wish to do it my way (i really dont like messing with my registry) uninstall it then reinstall it but if it asks you what region choose united states instead, also remember to have the dll file, which was included in 1.27 crack+patch, replaced, its not only the TS3.exe thats important here.

@everyone else who has the problem about the region thingy, try to search on the web how you guys can edit it, i found one before i just remember what site it was (sorry.)

@Hirya~san thank you very much ^^ i'll be waiting for the 1.33/1.34 patches from you~~~"
