,aliendydo,2010-01-15T14:52Z,"1.074 Works pretty good... But I get ""server connection timed out"" and ""Couldn't join steam lobby"" errors a lot. It took me 6 tries to join a game but it's worth it :P"

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5280120/Zero_Gear_Modern_Warfare_2_174_Crack

NOT COOL, you didn't even give credit to the makers of the crack"
[V],Mbb15,2010-01-15T16:32Z,i dont think so because when i uploaded this it was 1 munite online on the orginal site
[T],liluser,2010-01-15T17:09Z,"new update for MW2 1.0.175

,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-01-15T20:27Z,"Why not check if it has been uploaded?

My torrent has 12 hours of difference from yours..., so the site you're visiting isn't being well updated"
,Isti01,2010-01-15T21:05Z,I think 1.0.174 is disabled now aswell
[V],Mbb15,2010-01-15T21:09Z,its rzking.blogspot and whats wrong with a twice upload? its not the same torrent as you and this is 'the pirate bay' I think youve stole CODMw2 the game as well?
[V],Mbb15,2010-01-15T21:11Z,btw if everyone has downloaded your torrent and mine torrent has still 38 seeders im not the only one whove missed your torrent and mayby people dont trust an uploader with two torrent because there are a lot of fakes the last weeks
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-01-15T21:22Z,"It looks like IWNET stopped supporting 174, fuck it"
