Deacon Blackfire, a charismatic shaman with roots as old as Gotham City itself, seemingly uses the city's homeless to fight crime. But Blackfire has a hidden agenda.  Blackfire and his band of homeless followers kidnap Batman and following a lengthy period of captivity Batman slowly succumbs to brainwashing. 

When this four-issue mini-series was published in 1988 it was highly controversial.

Written by Jim Starlin and illustrated by Bernie Wrightson.
