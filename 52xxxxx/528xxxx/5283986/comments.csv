its clean and its working"
,kraziaznvtboi,2010-01-26T07:38Z,"@Everyone who gets a non-supported device error

Perhaps it's obvious to everyone, but I'm a n00b, so it took me awhile to figure out.

If you previously had SRS installed, make sure you change to a different default sound driver in the sound control panel before updating.

If you don't the installation goes all funny and it won't load up properly.

Anyways, 100% Working and Clean.

You'll get false positives on the keygen, but that's expected."
,kraziaznvtboi,2010-01-26T09:33Z,"Oh and I'm not sure why, but if you have other sound drivers installed from stuff like ""Tunebite"" and ""Total Recorder,"" it confuses SRS or something.

So I had to uninstall them for SRS to work properly."
,Sh4d0,2010-01-30T12:16Z,can ny 1 explain me how 2 use the keygen... it always says invalid code something. plz xplain in detail where to put what code

,tawar22,2010-02-08T05:42Z,"plzzzzzz. giv me reg for this.
76a0-d683-2939-97d1"
,Liquidizer38,2010-02-15T18:25Z,"Aoloffline, thanks for the file man. It works great!!! The application file is authentic from SRS. Reg Key was tested with Bitdefender Internet Security 2010, and came up clean. No problems at all. First, install SRS. Second, go into settings to disable ""automatic updates."" Then, go into your firewall settings to DENY SRS access to the internet. Then, Reboot computer. Next, use reg key to register MANUAL/OFFLINE. Make sure there's no internet connection when applying the reg key information. "
,djsanya23,2010-02-25T21:32Z,invalid code why???
,softsmith,2010-02-26T16:50Z,"Thanks a million. 

Norton Internet Security 2010 did not find anything. Seems clean. 

I had a old version, after installation it did not ask me to register this new version, probably a free update. 

I can't do without this software on my laptop. 

Highly recommended. "
,flexo23,2010-03-01T23:30Z,"thanks for the upload, it works great"
,ninj0e,2010-03-15T03:20Z,"Works like a Charm :D, though it wont automatically load presets, any suggestions?"
,crazysoccerman14,2010-03-26T20:13Z,Still cannot figure out why it is rejecting all of the keygen values.
,skullbone,2010-03-27T16:30Z,"If you are getting an ""Invalid"" try disabling your Internet connection.  You can thank me by buying the next round."
,connor_goodman995,2010-03-30T04:40Z,please tell me the reg for this please????
,SaiyanB,2010-04-27T20:32Z,Working great...thx aoloffline
,mirzasghar,2010-04-28T10:23Z,Its not working with my Creative 7.1 speakers :'(
,bschmitty1992,2010-04-30T06:44Z,THIS DOES WORK ON WINDOWS 7! All you have to do is right click the icon and go to properties then look for compatibility mode and set it two vista
,neetz,2010-05-04T23:06Z,this works without setting the compatibility mode for me :)
,gsp24,2010-05-11T23:10Z,"The codes don't work. I've tried disabling my connection and what not, still gives an error."
,gsp24,2010-05-11T23:29Z,"Nvm I'm a noob, forgot to enter the product id in the keygen."
,JenasiaWolf,2010-07-14T21:17Z,Worked awesome for me... sounds beautiful. Clean and didn\'t give me any issues. Thanks aoloffline
,DraTkcuF,2010-08-02T01:45Z,i can't get it working :S i have Windows xp Service Pack 3.. Does it matter?

,TipTopGeezer,2011-02-02T15:18Z,Thank you so much !!! It works brilliantly
,spicy_puerto_rican,2011-02-19T09:36Z,"Hot damn, you ain't kidding when it read as ""an improved bass and better dialog quality""! This is like a silver screen theater's sound system in my head and I love it! I absolutely love the Extra Bass setting in the Music's audio Preset! This one is sooooo much better and significantly better than the older SRS version I had unlocked which was probably like version 1.4 or something. Highly recommended guys!

When you install this one people, go to the Application 1st and copy the Product ID into the Keygen 1st! Then go back to the Keygen and copy/paste the keys from the keygen to the Application and voila, you're done!

Tons of thanks to you AolOffline, you are the shit!"
,spicy_puerto_rican,2011-02-19T09:41Z,"I forgot to mention....
Update to Activation problems you guys might have:

If you follow my directions and copy the Product ID from the Application into the keygen, click generate, then copy/paste everything else from the keygen back to the Application.... DO NOT need to turn off your internet connection to activate it, there is NO need to do so because it CAN be activated without turning off your internet connection!! It worked for me in less than 10 seconds!"
,rayaraay,2011-03-06T12:03Z,The keygen got a virus !!! fuking retards put more shit on piratibay.
,ericv1984,2011-03-06T23:22Z,"I downloaded this on my HP G42-230us last night. I don't know why but as soon as I downloaded it my speakers stopped working so I just uninstalled it and now my speakers work just fine.

I'm gonna download and install it again, hopefully something went wrong last time but it'll work fine this time."
,ericv1984,2011-03-06T23:46Z,"Just downloaded and installed again and my speakers stopped working. So I uninstalled it.

Thanks anyway."
,vigank,2011-04-20T11:03Z,Same thing happened to me too. When i instaled the srs audio soundbox it worked great but when i shut my pc down and opened it again I couldn't hear any sound so i had to delete it. I'm using win 7 32bit home premium edition
,whitefang_razorblade,2011-04-28T07:55Z,"WOW! fast download and it works great on my Win 7 64.

Now for those of you who encounter sudden lost of audio after running the SRS Audio Sound Box here a suggestion because I also encounter it too.

On the SRS Audio Sound Box window there's a big ass play button top and next to it is Options. Click Options and Select Preferences, once in, under Devices there's a drop down. Mine was defaulted to Realtek HDA Primary output so I change it to Realtek HDA Audio 2nd output because I'm using headphone and works like charm.

Note that when SRS Audio Sound Box is open it overrides the default of Realtek HD Audio Manager. Open your Realtek HD Audio Manager and you can see that Speakers and HD Audio 2nd output is not check. Check one and your audio will be back but not with SRS WOW effect just the original.

HOPE that helps and Thanks  Uploader."

,CinClean,2011-04-29T13:29Z,"Fast download installation worked just fine. Improved music quality a lot from my 2.1 but I couldn't get it configured to utilize my 5.1 surround headphones => sound only got worse on the headphones. Anyone got any idea what might be wrong, I got the ""red 'X' on the 5.1 surround checklist"". thanks for upload. [Win7 64bit]"

,ucalien,2011-12-24T01:36Z,Flawless installation. Running with iTunes 9. Great sound. Just one detail: It doesn't open automatically along with iTunes. I have to open manually and I couldn't find any option to make it open when I open iTunes. Though I set it to start up with Windows and it should do the job.
,ucalien,2011-12-24T01:38Z,"And yes, it runs on Windows 7. I'm running it right now in my Ultimate."
,Zaptac,2011-12-30T00:13Z,"okay I'm trying to install this on win xp... on the activation box it has the area where the registration number as blank, and the box underneath it is grayed out over internet activation and manual. can anyone help me out? thx in advance"

,JMit,2012-01-27T13:56Z,"Fantastic piece of software... Im glad dfx didnt work in my pc, SRS is much much better. A billion thanks!"
,clubkilla,2012-03-12T04:02Z,"I got the built-in soundcard of my laptop (Realtek HD Optical Audio) connected with my Hi-Fi amplifier (using optical cable) so I always get Dolby Digital through the speakers (2 main, 2 rear, 1 center and subwoofer) of my 1st class Hi-Fi. A lustful sound that fills my livingroom... I thought that it could be even better using this tool, but nothing can be further from the truth. Although clean torrent without virus/trojan (great work, uploader!) the problem is that - using this SRS thingy - my Dolby Digital is gone but all sound comes through my tiny hidden laptop speakers. My RT optical HD soundcard is merely disabled. Sounds awful! So I don't use it anymore currently... but has anyone an idea how to solve this, so I can still improve sound quality? My goal: perfection / comfort in sound!"
,yo236,2012-04-01T14:25Z,"PLEASE ....
