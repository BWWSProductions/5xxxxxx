This is a clean rip from the DVD set, all thirteen episodes.

I have trimmed out the previously-ons from all episodes and removed the opener from all but the first episode. I have also included the opener separately, for those who want to view it. Finally I created file names that reflect what each episode is about, since the actual episode titles mostly did not remind me of which episode was which. I have included a word.doc that has the episode list from Wikipedia, for reference to the actual episode titles.

According to the Wikipedia:

"The show centres on Jaye Tyler (Caroline Dhavernas), a recent Brown University graduate with a philosophy degree, who holds a dead-end job as a sales clerk at a Niagara Falls gift shop. Jaye is the reluctant participant in conversations with various animal figurines â€” a wax lion, brass monkey, stuffed bear, and mounted fish, among others â€” which direct her via oblique instructions to help people in need.

Some sources use the two-word spelling, "Wonder Falls", for the title. The title of its theme song, "I Wonder Why the Wonderfalls" by Andy Partridge of XTC fame, lists the single word spelling in its original release on iTunes."
