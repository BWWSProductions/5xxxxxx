,nocurbahead,2010-01-18T18:01Z,"Sorry! Also this program works only 1 hour, after it will be automatically blocked. 
Firewall or not, it doesn't work!"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-19T09:31Z,"did you block it using your firewall?
did you uncheck (check for tuneup updates)?

if not there's your answer, if ur still unconvinced, then buy it"

,samsiteone,2010-01-30T19:29Z,"Guys you must block your software from updating or going online, or your software will be snatched by the owner company."
,garyknowz1,2010-01-31T14:20Z,"Grimreaper, 

Thanks for uping this. Great job! I?m trying to block using Windows Firewall as advised, but not quite sure what domain or url to block. There appears to be a number of ?TuneUp? companies, and not sure which is the right feed. Thanks. GK "
,ThinkCreative,2010-01-31T20:48Z,"Thank you GrimReaper, You have awesome torrents, downloaded in a few minutes."
,ThinkCreative,2010-02-01T19:45Z,"Update: Installed this one and so far it works like a charm. No weird things, didn;t expect so, but there are so many false torrents out there.

Thanks for all the personal support you give to people here as well, so far I haven't needed but it shows some reliability for your torrents. You deserve the skull!"

,BipolarMonkey,2010-03-30T16:38Z,Ok I am apparently a retard but I don't see how to stop this from checking for updates or connecting to the net. Where is the option to stop this from happening?
[T],grimreaper420,2010-04-06T04:19Z,"@bipolar im on a friends system rite now, but it's there take your time and find, when you do disable it, and you'll feel better :)"
,weaponx4701,2010-04-14T19:30Z,"Not sure what happened.

I had the the app working fine for some time and I think l forgot to block the automatic updates or something like that. The counterfeit program warning came up and gave me the option to buy or enter a valid key.

I tried the one that originally came with it and it was rejected.

I uninstalled and downloaded this version with serial key. I get the same rejection to the key.

Any suggestions grimreaper and please don't tell me to buy it, that's why I come here so I don't have to buy it.

Thanks for the upload anyway."
,silvertoes,2010-05-09T22:58Z,"Hiya just a quick question,

I downloaded this from a different uploader and it only came with the key and silly me, i didn't think to block it from updates. So it was working fine until recently when it said it was an illegal version. Tried to uninstall and reinstall and delete all the files in the program file before reinstall and still have the same message and get told the key is invalid. Just wanted to know if there is a was to reverse it and then reinstall or have i cocked it up for good?

Thanks for the upload though, very fast, and if i had got this 1 first wouldn't have had the problem =)"
,silvertoes,2010-05-10T16:18Z,"Nvm i found out how to get it working
Just have to use this serial 4VM3B7-H1NNJN-VMFAA8-4FKQ4K-4941DH-H0BQ57  and then block it on firewall"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-05-17T00:34Z,don't post serials they will blacklist them ...  
,ultimateguy,2012-01-22T15:23Z,never noticed pirating tune up utilities would be very hard
