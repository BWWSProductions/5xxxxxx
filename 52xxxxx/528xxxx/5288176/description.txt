The Infowarrior with Jason Bermas
Sunday, 17 January 2010


[sebaygo1]




Bermas is live again today.  This broadcast's first two hours are to focus primarily on Cass Sunstein, Obama's "Info-Czar" [Director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs] and his ideas about internet regulation and censorship, taxing or outlawing conspiracy theorists, the 2nd Amendment, etc., etc..


I am including in this torrent a .pdf copy of Sunstein's article, "Conspiracy Theories."

Here's a quote from an OpEd piece he wrote some years ago for the Chicago Tribune:

"In what sense in the money in our pockets and bank accounts 
fully â€˜oursâ€™? Did we earn it by our own autonomous efforts? 
Could we have inherited it without the assistance of probate 
courts? Do we save it without the support of bank regulators? 
Could we spend it if there were no public officials to 
coordinate the efforts and pool the resources of the 
community in which we live? [....] Without taxes there would 
be no liberty. Without taxes there would be no property. 
Without taxes, few of us would have any assets worth 
defending. [....] There is no liberty without dependency. 
That is why we should celebrate tax day...."



In the 3rd hour, Jason talks with Cindy Sheehan.

He also takes a number of calls.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
