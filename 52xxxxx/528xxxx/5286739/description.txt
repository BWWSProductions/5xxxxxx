INFO:

Synthpop at its best. Clean and raw early 80's synths. Not too 
much of that "new wave" guitar. Nice catchy melodies to sink in.
This compilation is the far side of industrial but as always 
many of these artist has influenced todays artists or continued
more industrialized way. This sound was the breakthrough of 
electronic music back then. I have to say this is maybe the best 
compilation so far. Maybe because I found so many great artists
and tracks when building it but also because it includes quite 
rare tracks.
