Donna DiForza had big plans for Gotham. DiForza was building a city within the city - a shining metropolis full of high-end retail stores, corporate headquarters, and clean, new housing. It would be free of the troubles that burdened Gotham - no crime, no homelessness, no undesirables.
Of course, DiForza has certain obstacles in her way. To build her dream city, she will have to raze large sections of run-down Gothamâ€™s inner city. And as of late, squatters have taken up residence in the buildings planned for demolition. Perhaps itâ€™s only a coincidence that many of these tenements have taken to catching fire recently.
But maybe her worst problem is her own security chief, the Riddler. Once, it had seemed a brilliant idea to hire a master thief to find any holes in her contractorâ€™s security plans. But when she tires of his eccentricities and turns on him, she finds this prankster can be a terrible enemy.
