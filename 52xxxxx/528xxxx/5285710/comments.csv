,KLofD,2010-02-04T10:45Z,I'm really glad to see that you're still pumping these out. Thanks for all the hard work.
,rhmum,2010-02-15T15:30Z,"still working on it, lost another hard drive... will be doing another few real soon but you know how life kinda sneaks up on you"
,rhmum,2010-02-15T15:40Z,looks like i might have to redesign the ripper though.... site structure changed. still slow as hell though
,deisty,2010-02-16T04:28Z,"That's ok rhmum,

Take your time! Site-ripping Rule34 is going to take a long time for anyone. Appreciate the effort your putting into this.

Any chance you can set up your program for xbooru.com and/or lolibooru.com when you get done with Rule34? Or maybe you could just give a HowTo Readme file.

Either way...Thanks for all you have done already!"
,deisty,2010-02-16T04:32Z,"OH btw...I know those sites (xbooru.com/lolibooru.com) aren't sorted by file name but, I can do that even if it requires going through each file."
,rhmum,2010-02-16T21:16Z,"i can make a ripper soon. turns out the rule34 image server went down, i dont need to redesign, just wait for it to come back up"
,Arrogance,2010-04-30T04:14Z,"I don't suppose the server is back up yet?

I really appreciate the torrents thus far."
,HellboysHell,2010-06-16T19:39Z,Hi rhmum. When comes the next ones? I hope your PC is ok
,RaptorAM2,2010-06-29T01:36Z,"Great job rhmum, can you upload your site-ripper app please."
,hbobby,2012-07-01T19:54Z,"It is my pleasure and honor to announce that I will be picking up where Rhmum left off. I am merely a placeholder, in the event that Rhmum ever comes back I will step aside and let him take over. He has done the world of perverts a great service and we are in his debt. I hope that I can one day be half the image ripper that he is. Be expecting 260,001 - 270,000 by the end of July. Hopefully even sooner. "
,hbobby,2012-07-02T05:56Z,"Heres the link to the next set. I'm seeding, dont know why it says 0 seeds...
