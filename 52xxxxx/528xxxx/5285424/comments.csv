1 - seeders are more than leachers

2 - A million comments about how great the quality is(screeners are not ever great)

3 - 10 other torrents come out at the exact same time, the exact same size, having the exact same comments

4 - screen shots that seem to be accepted and never disappear on public websites

5 -When these fake torrents are released, for some reason they have +1000 seeds instantly

Is this torrent fake? Tracked? Use these common sense clarifiers. The movie industry obviously does not use common sense...

Take care and Download safe...
