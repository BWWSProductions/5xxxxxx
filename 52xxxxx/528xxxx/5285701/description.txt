District B13 Ultimatum, the long anticipated new sequel to the hit 2004 film Banlieue 13, starring:

Cyril Raffaelli as Capt. Damien Tomaso, a tough undercover police officer who believes in law and government.

David Belle as LeÃ¯to, an acrobatic ghetto-dweller who fights the gangs and feels cheated by the system.

An action packed film, this is one you're not gonna want to miss. The government is back tot heir old tricks, but this time, the threat is bigger then some smalltime thug launching a bomb.

Much bigger.

The undercover special ops team D.I.S.S. has hatched a plot to destroy the city Leito holds so dear, and he and his old friend Damien are all that stand in their way.

Ripped by M3nno. As close to axxo quality as i could get it, but only the original is great.

I love you axxo!

Audio a bit loud, 8/10
Video as good quality as I could get it. 9/10

Enjoy! Request files in comments, I'll try and get them!
