This is a Windows XP x86 (32 bit) Professional version with SP3 which is updated upto Jan 2010. No Tools like Nlite is used. Our aim was to create a version which is fairly stable with no flashy content like the other modified Windows running around. Normal Nlite based modified Windows might show some problems when updating/repairing a current windows setup or performing a RIS setup. So about RockStable - Though we got the final aim of having a pretty stable edition, it has just one problem - its huge size. But we feel that this will be worth it.

And one more thing guys, this edition is for those people who want a Rock Stable OS and not for those guys looking for a blazing fast OS. This is not a unattended version. Rather this is a version which is attended and it can be used for repairing an existing Windows XP x86 (32 bit) installation or for RIS (Remote Installation Service).
