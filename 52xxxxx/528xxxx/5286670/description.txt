This is an application used to rip cd's dvd's and game discs to an ISO image so they can be seeded, burned again on to other discs, or used in emulators. I have successfully ripped my entire PSX game collection with this and will be uploading it shortly. I have not tried to rip any other games besides PSX discs so I don't know if it will work with other game types as well.
