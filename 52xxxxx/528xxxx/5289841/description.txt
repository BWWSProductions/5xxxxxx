Gloria Coleman - 4 Albums - Jazz Organ


One of the last surviving jazz organists of the 1960s, Gloria Coleman started her career as a bassist and occasional pianist. In 1960 she switched her focus to organ, working with Sonny Stitt. In 1963 she recorded the gem 'Soul Sisters' with jazz guitar legend Grant Green. Although she has not recorded that extensively in her career, she is a powerful player and has not lost anything through the decades.
