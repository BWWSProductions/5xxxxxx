Based upon the Jon Bon Jovi CD album of the same name, the music tracks inspired the stroyline to this gritty, slightly depressing tale about a couple struggling to get along.

What is surprising is the amount of big-name supporting actors. Kevin Bacon is woefully underused, but fantastic in the screen time he has. Demi Moore doesn't actually play a drunk very well, but is passable in her role as Bon Jovi's other half. And Whoopi Goldberg is sensational as a philosophy-cracking taxi driver - she really lights up the film as soon as she arrives.

But really, this is Jon's film. He's the main character, it is his story, and he holds his own acting chops well in the midst of a more experienced crowd. He brings a real warmth and feeling to the film that is otherwise missing.

Still, half the fun of watching this short film (its only an hour long) is catching references to the songs used. And of course, with Jon's brilliant songs always playing in the background gives it a superb soundtrack.

This DVD is a conversion of the video, but you do get a couple of decent music videos as extras, which are always a pleasure to watch. Essential for any Bon Jovi fan, and an interesting curiosity for a movie buff.
