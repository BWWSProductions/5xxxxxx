Pretty scary stuff!"
,Harry Q Hammer,2010-01-19T01:57Z,"P.S.  James Coburn doesn't ""host"" this show.  It was originally narrated by Don Lafontaine, however the narration was re-recorded by a fellow with an English accent (who sounds familiar but I don't remember his name) to suit a British audience."
