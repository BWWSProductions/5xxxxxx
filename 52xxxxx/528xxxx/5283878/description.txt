Information:
Everyone has heard ghost stories, but what if those stories were true? Hosted by James Coburn, this show investigates some modern ghost tales in which possible evidence of the supernatural has shown up in photographs, audio recordings and on video. Can there be a natural explanation for these phenomena, or are they proof that something is out there?


The documentary is not in such good video quality, therefore the low size, but the content match that up.
