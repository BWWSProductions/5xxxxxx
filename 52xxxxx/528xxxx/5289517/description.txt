Digital Juice Fonts Collection One



Introduction:
Digital Juice Fonts, Collection One is the result of hundreds of hours
of painstaking detail work by our illustrators. This effort, in tandem with
the endless hours put in by our programming team has provided you with
a product more customizable, more powerful, more useful, and more fun than any
product weâ€™ve ever released.
In the simplest terms, DJ Fonts are layered, graphical fonts.
While they can be modified with many of the traditional text manipulation properties
like font size, kerning, etc. in the Juicer application, the end result or
final output is graphical.

35 Font Families:
DJ Fonts - Collection 1 is divided into the 35 basic DJ Font Families.
At the head of each family is a Parent Font that is typically based
on a popular BitStream OpenType font. From this versatile Parent Font,
the artists at Digital Juice go on to create a large family of related fonts,
each one highly unique from the other.

Over 1300 Standard Fonts
Stunning ready-to-use variations created by the artists of Digital Juice.
Though DJ Fonts: Collection 1 comes with 35 DJ Font Families, that number
doesn't tell the whole story. Within each DJ Font Family Digital Juice provides
a multitude of highly modified versions known as Standard DJ Fonts.  

Highly Customizable:
Lots of layers and effects make it easy for you to create new DJ Fonts.
For each DJ Font Family there are practically limitless permutations possible
with all the different layers, textures, gradients and other effects
that are available via the Juicer.  

Features:
* 35 unique DJ Font families
* Over 1300 ready-to-use Standard DJ Fonts
* Over 200 Font Textures

* DJ Fonts can be easily customized with pre-installed textures and gradient presets
   or you can import your own images as textures and
   create and customize your own gradient presets.
* 100% Royalty Free

Digital Juice The Juicer 3:
