Product Description:
Chopper is an action packed side-scrolling helicopter 
game. Complete your mission, and return to base, while 
avoiding enemy fire from tanks, bazooka wielding mad 
men, and jets.

Chopper 1.2 is a major upgrade which includes four new 
missions and 3D surround sound. New desert and cave 
based missions have been added bringing the total 
number up to seventy-two across the three difficulty 
levels.
It also adds ambient sound effects, enables the 'ijkl' keys 
to control the Chopper, and has many other 
improvements.
Four new missions! In 'Beyond The Caves' you fly through 
tight gaps to rescue hostages on the other side. 'The 
Cliffs Have Eyes' plummets you multiple times into 
valleys surrounded by cliffs filled with enemy bazooka 
mad men.

What's New?
