,EmpAtahualpa,2010-01-17T13:51Z,"Yes, audio is in English."
[V],LosslessDude,2010-01-18T04:16Z,"Thank's once again CHD!
I was waiting for the 1080p release!

This is going to look great on my WD TV!  : )"
,jeffat38,2010-01-23T04:49Z,"wow, i had 720p of this one, now it's 1080p, cool, can't wait to see it on my cinematube!"
,master__,2010-01-24T17:26Z,If people could learn that RAR files are mutch better than one big file this tracker would be awsome. Everyone would know that the files are the exakt the same as it was for the one who ripped the release. To bad moste people here are to dumb to relize that. have a good life 
,taz.uk,2010-01-27T07:52Z,i noticed this is in 1080p too bad the resolution is 1920x800 and not 1920x1080...i prefer the latter as there is no black lines. I would rather just download the full 720p version
,jeffat38,2010-01-28T02:05Z,downloaded and it's just great! thanks for sharing!
,Yggdrasil75,2010-03-21T18:14Z,works on ps3?
,Renegade78,2010-08-28T12:04Z,"@taz.uk
Movies are rarely shot in a 16:9 aspect ratio, it may not have 1080 vertical lines but it's still 1920 horizontally. The 720p version would be no different in this respect as they would have to reduce the vertical resolution anyway to maintain the aspect ratio."
,thegr8luiz,2011-02-09T11:21Z,"Thank you so much for sharing this and for uploading it as one big file. Unlike the user called master, I hate rar files. There's usually some kind of problem with them."
,RedPlanetEarth,2012-01-17T09:14Z,"Hey uploader are you sure this is the unrated version? Seems to me it has the same lenght as the original cut. The Director's Cut however is 10 minutes longer (118 min.).....I don't think there is an unrated version at all. Well I'm just saying that your info and title doesn't add up.

Anyway thanks for uploadin."
