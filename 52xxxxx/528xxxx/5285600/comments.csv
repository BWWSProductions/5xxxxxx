,Z.Z.,2010-02-13T05:29Z,"Thanks for the upload. This is an awesome series. Question though, is it just me or does it seem that these episode have a rather low sound quality?"
,soagg1,2010-02-14T03:16Z,ZZ what kind of sound problems are you seeing ?
,Z.Z.,2010-02-15T06:23Z,"It sounds as if the sound was recorded by a microphone from a camera then synced with the video. I checked the audio bit rate and it's the same for all of your Code Geass releases. The last half of R2 and part of the the first half of R1 are the only episodes that seem to be doing this.
Maybe it's just my computer. :P"
,Z.Z.,2010-02-15T06:25Z,Let's just say that the audio sounds more like it's 70 kbps instead of 128 kbps. Maybe I should try redownloading it.
,Rychen,2010-03-09T10:18Z,Guess redownloading fixed it =P
