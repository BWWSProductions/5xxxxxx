No thanks"
,swampmatt,2010-07-01T06:06Z,"Original version of ""Green Grass & High Tides"" is only the first half of the song! It's cut off. Some other tracks are low bit rate, but complete. Thanks anyway."
,dcb10453,2011-08-12T06:40Z,"The Outlaws first toured and opened for the Who in Europe. Frank O'Keefe told me stories of dancing on tables with Keith Moon in Greece. Their second tour they opened for Lynrd Skynrd. When Frank left the band he played with me in The Ohio Band, also original southern rock, circa 1977-1979. Henry Paul asked him to join his band, but Frank declined. Don Beach, drums & vox "
,monkery,2011-08-16T01:26Z,"Thanks! This band is one of my all time favorites. Saw them twice in a really small bar in the late eighties. They played absolutely perfectly each time, as if there were ten thousand fans there, though there were, at most, only fifty.

These tracks are NOT low quality. People need to quit using bitrates, software and meters to tell them whether the music sounds good or not. That what yer freaking EARS are for!

Just two comments:

1) Jones and O'Keefe did not die in '85. I saw them both in 89. They died in '95.

2) I gotta wonder at the weird folder of Joe Meek stuff included with this. Nice for those that know who he his, but I'm sure not many would, and kind of odd to put his stuff in with this."

 I think it was filmed and recorded too would love to grab that album again. "

Amazing and their rendition of Ghost Riders in the Sky was great my late Father loved it too and would always get me to put it on loud in my room   "
