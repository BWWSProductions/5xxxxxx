,aufix,2010-01-18T07:43Z,"Is this the real thing? I'm downloading it now and I trust every VIP member on this site, but I would just assume that if the first episode was released, it would be at the very top of top 100."
,Halo3Pro,2010-01-18T07:46Z,any subs?

,aufix,2010-01-18T11:57Z,"Great quality of both video and audio! No subs though, but Halo3Pro's subtitles worked just fine.

Thanks!"
