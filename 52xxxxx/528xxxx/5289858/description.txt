Powerful Audio/Video Mastering and Burning Kit!
 
There are many fine products that can burn CDs and DVDs. But do they have the 
features you require? FinalBurner is the last burner you will ever need! Burn 
Blu-Ray or HD-DVD media with revolutionary High Definition media support. Author 
your own DVD-Video or re-master an existing one, or save yourself a blank DVD-R 
and design a Video CD if your source video is coming from a compact digital camera 
and is not on par with DVD resolution. Use your MP3 collection to create your own 
audio CD that you can listen to in a car. Protect your favorite songs and movies 
from scratches by creating backup copies of your DVD movies and audio CDs.
Finally, design and print your own disc covers and insert them into a DVD box or 
CD jewel case for a great, professional look! 

With FinalBurner, you can easily create a DVD-Video disc by simply importing 
movies from existing video files in virtually any format, including the popular 
AVI, DivX, MPEG, WMV, ASF, and MOV. If you have a webcam, TV tuner, compact photo 
or DV camera, FinalBurner can easily capture the video stream and master a 
professional-looking DVD. 

Does your car have an MP3 player or are you among the rest of us who can only play 
the good old Audio CDs while driving? FinalBurner will create an AudioCD/MP3CD to 
play back in the car from your digital music files in wav, mp3, ogg, mid, wma, aac,
mp4, m4a, xm, mod, s3m, it, mtm and mo3 formats. Ripping music to WAV or MP3 
formats is also easy with FinalBurner. 

Do your kids watch their favorite cartoons so often that you are buying new copies 
of the same title every now and then? Save money by creating backup copies of the 
most watched discs with FinalBurner! 

Have you just compiled a great collection of songs, and wish you had a cover with 
the tune titles? There is absolutely no need to search for a cover designer as it 
is already there in FinalBurner. Create a great-looking cover for your music or 
video in a matter of minutes! 

A product that includes DVD authoring, media backup, disc burning, music ripping, 
and cover design must be a complex and expensive one, right? Wrong! FinalBurner 
is not only easy to use, but it won't make you break the bank being the least 
expensive product among its competitors! 

Easy, convenient, intuitive disc creation is finally possible with FinalBurner.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
