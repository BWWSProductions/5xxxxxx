After Joe McElderry performed, 'Dont Stop Believin' and 'Open Arms' during the 2009 season of 'X-Factor' Journey are once again riding high in the album charts with their, 'Greatest Hits' collection currently in the iTunes top 20.

This collection focuses on the love songs and ballads that, with the arrival of Steve Perry in 1978, turned Journey from Jazz-Fusion virtuosos to AOR multi-platinum selling stadium gods with rock anthems to pump the air to and love songs to woo loved ones.

The more up-tempo songs are at the beginning and the slower songs toward the end, ideal for a romantic evening so download this for the lady in your life and let Steve Perry, (remember Journey have had 3 lead vocalists) and the band work their magic.

* due to ISP traffic shaping it may not seem that there are a lot of seeders (the Pirate Bay trackers are often blocked) but rest assured ive linked this to a number of other trackers including openbittorrent so you should get it in a reasonable time once its populated to the swarm.

* 20 tracks seemed a good number to represent the ballads from the back catalogue but you will only get 18 on a CD if you are looking to burn it so I would lose the two Arnel Pineda songs if you need to.  Track 12 is my favorite and one of only three not sung by Steve Perry!


* Fans take note, a new Steve Perry album is expected during 2010 and lets pray for a tour
