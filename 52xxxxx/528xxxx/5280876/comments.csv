,pjf222,2010-04-21T23:20Z,Does anyone know where I can find the third movie? Jake's Long Shadow.
,80xing,2010-04-27T06:28Z,i tink youve been misinformed there is no 3rd movie...atleast not with the same actors anyway
,penisfuck,2010-05-01T21:21Z,"Jake's Long Shadow has not been put on screen yet. But you can read the novel from Alan Duff from 2002. Maybe they will make a movie too at some point. We'll see.

,tnesla,2010-10-14T19:48Z,Thanks Ramalan! Would be great if there was a torrent for the epic tv show titled Mataku (2002-2005) known as the Maori version of the Twilight Zone. IMDB info: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352076/
,murrambingi,2011-03-03T22:59Z,"thx for the upload ramalan,

quality is not too bad, it's a little hazy and the resolution is too small for me to watch so i converted it to 720p and it shows that the quality is not the best (less than a DvdRip) good job, thanks for sharing though.
