u should have commented that on SECRETMYTH's Releases its mostly all TS / Telesync but high in quality.


u should download it 1st before saying its fake
please next time, tell something that makes sense."

,unwantedlaw,2010-01-18T06:40Z,"angel, now youre talking! that made sense to my whole new world LOL!

Download it yourself so that you can get over with your obscure mind and PARANOIA

stop Trolling coz you have very Lam accusastions."
,chewbacca81,2010-01-18T12:19Z,"This is a FAKE. The file only has a few seconds of video, and the rest of the file is filled with a repeating garbage string."
,chewbacca81,2010-01-18T12:24Z,"Also, the uploader is a scammer, probably from a poor developing country. He is trying to redirect you to a page claiming to have the right codec, which will most definitely result in identity theft and/or viruses. Download one of the other Avatar versions instead. Do not seed this one."
,orwellenator,2010-01-18T12:51Z,"Can only agree with you comment.
Do NOT download this I did and get only crap.
This is a FAKE. The file only has a few seconds of video, and the rest of the file is filled with a repeating garbage string."

,ltcmdrData,2010-01-19T10:18Z,"Don't download, take it from me, it's bullshit. Just a 19 second clip with ""codec error: use windows media player"" embedded into it. It also says""redirecting to windows download page"" or some bullshit. Thanks a lot, unwantedlaw, you fucked up good and proper. Go fuck yourself kid."
,MajesticMeteor,2010-01-19T22:13Z,"Hey I don't play games on here.
If it's a fake I'll call it one, but until I see that it is I'm fucking pullin' it.
There be a bunch of fucking babies that call ""Fake"" because they're working for a Blog that wants all the action... why, I don't know. The retarded motherfuckers got Spam on their Blogs they want us to see I guess.
I'll be back and call it how it is, but right now I've got a 5 hr 50 min ETA and just 16 seeders.
I wouldn't pay a dime to watch this, but I'm sure the quality is good enough.
I'm just pullin' it down so I can write a Review about how Cameron is the second coming of Satan, lol."
,deepak4piratebay,2010-01-21T19:39Z,"hey majesticmetor,ur ETA must have ended by now & no feedback on this bullshit torrent.
U MOTHERFUCKERS never believe on friends ,this is a crap & this unwantedlaw is bloddy spammer."
