Mention Graham Marsden to any bream angler  #  , and the chances are that they will tell you that he's the man, when it comes to putting bream on the bank  #  .

Filmed at the profile Daventry Reservoir, Graham gives the complete A-Z on this species. He tells what to look for to locate them, how to feed the swim, what tackle and baits to use. Even more important he tells us about the habits and patrol routes of the species itself.

A devotee of the famous Cheshire  #   meres, Graham has landed double-figure bream amongst the thousands of all shapes and sizes he has caught over the years. In this video he passes on all he has learned.
