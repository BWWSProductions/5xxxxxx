Note: I made the special features semi low quality purposely to allow better quality for the movie itself, besides, they're just special features. I added the special features to the torrent because it's worth watching cuz there's deleted scenes that shouldn't of been deleted cuz it explains a lot, plus the story of what really happened back in those years...


Please help seed when done, an older movie like this will need it.
