Plot Synopsis from IMDB:
He always wears a hat
,even in bed after his operations in a mental hospital.

All he wants is a place to live but the huge city of St Petersburg is as cold and unwelcoming as it was to the characters of Gogol and Dostoyevsky. Nobody wants to know him except a blind beggar with a donkey and an aristocratic woman turned prostitute.
