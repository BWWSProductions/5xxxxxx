,DeltaPan,2010-01-16T15:17Z,"It's a scene release, most all scene releases are Rar'd, reups from initial scene releases are unRar'd.

So you want to have a go at those who provide the material you want initially just because it's Rar'd for initials distribution.

When knobs upload crap, it's usually one Rar file not the usual 15Mb whatever used by scene which is to do with packet math in the hash.

Why not go cap these things yourself instead of making a big issue out of what others provide for you just because scene cappers Rar for other primary distribution methods?

Exactly!!!
