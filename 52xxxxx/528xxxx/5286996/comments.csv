ImgBurn gives the following error message to me while preparing to burn: 
""Fix VTS sectors failed! Reason: VTS_02_0.IFO is not a valid IFO file.""
Thanx for answering! "
,cosypowell,2010-01-19T06:59Z,i get the same message
,swenkal,2010-01-19T20:26Z,I get the same error message and unable to burn. Actually something is screwed up in the VOB files as there is no end and credits.

,eleonoro,2010-02-11T01:37Z,I have chek this and of course it doesnt fix ANYTHING. The problem is that VTS_01_5.VOB is the same 5 minutes from VTS_01_1.VOB. The solution will be replace the wrong VTS_01_5.VOB for the correct one.

Did you have any errors when you tried to burn or when you try to play the DVD?"
