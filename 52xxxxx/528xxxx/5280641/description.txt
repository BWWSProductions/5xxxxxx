* GAME PRESENTATION :

* The video game is set on Pandora, an alien planet moon featured in the motion picture. The game includes the Na'vi, Pandora's indigenous people and other life forms. The player controls a marine named Lance Corporal Able Ryder. Soon into the game the player decides to play the RDA or Na'vi. If the player decides to join the Na'vi, the game becomes a third person adventure, and RDA characters are unplayable. If the player chooses to side with the RDA, the game remains a third person shooter, and Navi characters are unplayable. Both types of characters are equipped with their own particular weapons and abilities, with many other weapons and abilities unlockable as the player gains experience (XP) during the game.
