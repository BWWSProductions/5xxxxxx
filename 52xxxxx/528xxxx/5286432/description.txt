difficult to find it. So the easiest way to find it is at the top of the window click changed so that it organizes
the folders by date and if your last app you added was the Magellan app then it will be the top folder.

17. Now that you are in the folder you will see ''Roademate.app''folder click that and go into the folder.

18. Now look for ''Info.plist'' select that and delete it.

19. Now on the left window go to the directory of where you downloaded my torrent file and drag my modified 
''Info.plist'' into the left window in the ''Roadmate/app'' folder/
