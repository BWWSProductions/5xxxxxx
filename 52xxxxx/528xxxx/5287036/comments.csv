,Roco99,2010-01-21T16:22Z,I think that it IS Lady Gaga! Its a very very good song! Dont listen to him/her... 
,BostonR,2010-01-22T02:43Z,"FAKE! Here is the proof.  If you go to y-tube you can see that someone has taken the video for Jelena Karleusa - Insomnia and renamed it Lady Gaga ft. J.K. - Insomnia. Gaga's next single is ""Telephone,"" which is currently at #20 on the Hot 100, even though it's physical release isn't until Feb. 22. She films the video on Jan. 28. Some who posted this FAKE claimed that Lady Gaga has a song called ""Insomnia"" on the U.K. pop chart, which is an extreme fabrication. "

DonÂ´t download this eastern-europe crap disco shit :)"
