[V],twentyforty,2010-01-17T20:44Z,"@madtown4: I hope you've not asking for DVDrip, 'cause just two days ago I wasted my time and bandwidth for newest TS.
BTW, I declined yesterday all requests for Princess as DVDrip."

,madtown4,2010-01-17T21:18Z,"anyways keep up the good work, maybe all the other uploaders can learn something from you "
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-17T21:43Z,"@madtown4: Out there IS DVDrip, since yesterday. That's why I was upset 'cause day before that newest TS arrived and I sucked that one. I should wait for a day, but, I haven't.
So, if you have concerns about A/V DVDrip is better choice, always and no doubt about.
If you need to save on traffic, re-encoded TS is a choice. 400MB smaller and for sure lees than 60% lower in quality."
,keykeeper_d,2010-01-17T23:31Z,"Hi. Thank you for all you uploads. Will you make new episodes of ""24"" in h264? That would be great. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-18T01:50Z,"@keykeeper_d: Absolutely. Click on ""twentyforty"" in upper right page corner then read the schedule in description of Legend of the seeker for example or any of the last TV shows torrents."
,grayscales,2010-01-18T22:33Z,"Hi 20-40.  Thanks for upping this and Sherlock Holmes - both great quality as usual.

I have an earlier version of Sin City (theatrical cut, I think) which I've watched at least a dozen times.  I got a kick out of the extras included in this latest version.  "
,blu-momo,2010-01-24T13:37Z,Thanks for the Great work. Nice print.
