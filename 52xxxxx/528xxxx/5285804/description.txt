Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services is Microsoftâ€™s powerful platform for building enterprise-level data integration and data transformation solutions. Itâ€™s a powerful product, but itâ€™s also complex and can be confusing if you donâ€™t have a clear map for the journey. Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Integration Services Unleashed will be the only book youâ€™ll need to harness the power that Integration Services provides.

 

Through clear, concise explanations and samples, youâ€™ll grasp a clear understanding of working in the Integration Services environment, including how to set up stock components, how to use the various designer features, and how to gain practical knowledge on configuring, deploying, securing, and managing packages. Sample packages are provided to reinforce the discussion and quickly help you gain hands-on experience, and more complex topics such as Data Flow Task internals and tuning, advanced transformations, and writing custom components are all illustrated in easy-to-understand graphics. In addition, there are several custom tasks and transformations and two useful utilities with full source code available for you to use and study, including an ADO.NET destination, a text file encryption task, and a data profiling transform.
