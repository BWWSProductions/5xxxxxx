OJT said: Vegas is about three very different troubled young kids finding each other at a home for youngsters in Bergen, Norway. A girl without parents, a boy who accidentally pushes his mother off a ferry abroad, making the father hating the son, and a boy coming from a home with his mother as a victim of abuse by her boyfriend.

They are all well cared for by foster parents and a loving attendee at the child care center, but still they can't adjust. The story is told in a very realistic tone, but is is a tragic story, with not much hope for a solution.

The kids are doing a great job, though being amateurs. Though they don't manage to steal the screen, any of them. Maybe the girl is close to taking this role, with a childish charm. I'm not usually the gay wanting the happy ending, but maybe this film would be much better off with a less depressing conclusion. Well, it could be much worse, but still it seems like the film is lacking something in the end.

But the plot until this maybe flawed end is quite good, and the professional work with the film is great. Jobs made in the cutting room is great, making a good pace, and filming is solid.

This film comes out on a 7 out of 10, but some more work with the manuscript could have made it better. "

The actors were very good. Karoline Stemre (Marianne)has been acting for 9 years and portrayed her character perfectly. I hated her, but felt her pain. Jørgen Hausberg Nilsen seems to be his debut in films was the most likable character as Thomas, tenderly showing his love for his young brother and in the end also for his mother. I was pulling for him all the way, even when he screwed up. And Jørgen Hausberg Nilsen (also a newcomer to the screen) as an emotionally drained youth couldn't have been better. 

Kinoguiden: Karoline Stemre as an unpredictable, tough energy bomb, Jorgen Nilsen Hausberg with finely tuned qualities, while Kvalvåg Sindre Jacobsen draws a touching picture of an untimely wounded boy.

Worth a view unless you require a Disney ending. It ain't here."
