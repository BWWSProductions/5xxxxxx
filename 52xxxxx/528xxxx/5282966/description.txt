Product Description:
AppZapper allows you to confidently uninstall virtually 
any application as easily as it was installed - just drag 
and drop. Drag one or more unwanted apps onto 
AppZapper and watch as it finds all the extra files and 
let's you delete them with a single click. A slick safety 
system remembers which apps you want to keep safe, 
and the log tracks all the files you've zapped. Put simply, 
AppZapper is the uninstaller Apple forgot.
