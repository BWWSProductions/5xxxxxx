Release Notes:

Still standing strong after 20 years of genre travelling electronica,
Warp records celebrate their anniversary with a double disc of labels
faves chosen by you the fans, and the label's co-founder Steve Beckett.
The first disc was democratically picked by fans on their website,
including a heap of all time classics like AFX's 'Windowlicker', BoC's
'Roygbiv', Squarepusher's 'My Red Hot Car', LFO 'LFO (Leeds Warehouse
Mix)', and Ae's 'Gantz Graf', alongside Clark's 'Herzog'. The second
disc of selections from Steve Beckett is more intriguing, featuring a
ruck of new stuff like Flylo's 'GNG BNG', Battles 'Race:Out' and
Grizzly Bear's 'Colorado', next to classics such as Ae's 'Drane', Mike
Ink's 'Paroles', and AFX's magnificent 'Bucephalus Bouncing Ball' and
Xeper (Black Dog Productions) 'Carceres Ex Novum'. Great tunes - Happy
birthday Warp!
