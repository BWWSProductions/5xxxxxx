,Zzznorch,2010-01-16T16:37Z,The 2010.30 MapSource version that was posted on 2009-11-27 does include Mexico.  The earlier 2010.30 image that was posted DID NOT include Mexico because it was from an upgraded device that did not have Mexico to start with.

[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-17T00:44Z,"ohh yeah i remember those ...

Personally I'll stick with this for now.

Heard a few people been having problems with 2010.30, go figure, but again it's whatever people want.
I upped this cause i know users would like this, as evidenced by the number of leechers:)
Take care bro."
,usafle,2010-01-19T19:49Z,"Ok, I spent the last week seeding this and waiting for it to download.  To say that the instructions on how to install this leaves a bit to be desired is an understatement.   
Anyone care to shed some in-depth-hand-holding-directions for a noob such as myself... and probably any others that are trying to figure this out??  :)"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-19T23:57Z,"@usafle
maybe i could agree just a bit sorry bro:)

1.) go to that folder (garmin_rmu_cnnant2010_20)
double click on it.
2.) you will see 4 folders, 2 RARS, and an tutorial
3.) Extract IMG.rar and Additions.rar
4.) Delete IMG.rar and Additions.rar
5.) Now you have 6 folders.
6.) go to IMG open IMG folder  
7.) Look for CNNANT2010Update_ENU (ENU is English, ESP is Spanish, ITA is Italian, FRA French, DEU is Deutsch)
8.) Assuming most of u is English, click on ENU
9.)Install, (there's 2 check marks click on both and agree)
10.) wait till its completely installed, and if you need an updated program apps, it's in the (Garmin Updates Latest Programs).
11.) Load maps to your Garmin unit with keygen, and MapInstall).

Hope that helps just a bit....."
,usafle,2010-01-21T23:03Z,Thank you Sir!  That clears it up a bit.  I was over whelmed when I opened up the folder and saw 300 programs and stuff. :)
,usafle,2010-01-21T23:17Z,Well I did what you said.  It just put the maps on there.  Never asked for a key or anything.  Strange?!?!?

""Never asked for a key or anything. Strange?!?!? ""

that's hard to believe it didn't ask for key(s).
i bet when you start your gps device it wont load, or it might say need to unlock.
If it still loads 2010.20 you are lucky :)
Ciao."
,usafle,2010-01-22T02:44Z,"Started up the unit, worked fine.  Checked the map and it indeed says 2010.20

2010.20 is 2005, i tested it last night perfect here.

As for space, you can either delete the entire Garmin internal ""hard drive"", or load 2010.20 on a SD memory card.
Note: remember you need to backup POI's if applicable.
Hope this helps... 

@thedemo41 - that read me was not done by me

I already run the keygen and read all information. Unfortunately, I still can not see any option for 2010 maps on the list.

HOWEVER.  I still do not see ANY place to enter in the keygen supplied key.  The only option I see is ""get key online"" there is no place to manually enter a key.

,hermtm2,2010-02-06T17:56Z,"Hello.

I tried to install this map but it doesn't work.
As the instruction you posted, I went to 1 through 6 which is to extract two rar files.

There are the first question: You said that but the *ENU file is in IMG.rar. It is impossible to setup before extracting the rar files right?
Or is there any other setup files? 

"" DO not run setup until both IMG.rar and Additions.rar is extracted.
After both are extracted, then it's ok to run setup (*ENU) English. ""

The second, once the *ENU file was installed, it did not show what the next step is. It simpliy shows ""installed succussfully"" and then done. 

I couldn't follow the instruction 11. How to unlock the maps and load to my unit? 

I found the setup file on Windows folder. it asked me the production ID when it was excuted. The process took me to online registeration which was impossible to unlock the map. 

I understand and appreciate what you did so far but could you explain about the installation process a little more specifically?

Thanks."

You can get me on the suprbay forums under the same user name and I will give you a hand if you are having a problem.  

What you need to do is go through the map installer and when it give you the box with Maps that need to be unlocked you click the ""Unlock Maps"" button; go to Tab #2 ""Unlock Regions""; click ""Add"" then ""Close"".  Now just give it a few seconds and you should be able to go through to the map (clicking next) and then be able to select states/provinces/etc.

,mriddick,2010-02-21T06:02Z,"Hey guys...

I see everyone is having trouble unlocking your maps, I can help! 

1. Open the Garmin Map Installer

2. Open the keygen

3. When you open the Map Installer, you will see the option to ""unlock maps"" click on it. When it takes you to the new window (which ONLY gives option to unlock online) Click ""unlock regions""

4. On your keygen, enter the ID for your GPS, and click ""generate"" then under the map option, click the scroll-down box and press the option at the very bottom of the list. A pop-up will appear, in the ID box, type ""2005""
Then generate that code. (You now have TWO CODES)

5. Back on the Map Installer, while under ""unlock region"" click ""Add"" on the right hand side. Copy and paste the keygen code. (The MAP UNLOCK CODE NOT SOFTWARE UNLOCK CODE) which is the BOTTOM box on the keygen.

6. After you add that code, click ""close"" on the map install window, and now the map is unlocked. NOW you can add the regions, or the entire map if you choose. It's up to you.



It worked for me and I was having the same problems as everybody. That may not have been the most detailed explanation, but if you didn't get it, then send me an email."

,ColinK,2010-03-27T19:54Z,"Just loaded a nuvi 255w via SD card, but it looks like we'll be using a mates satnav for the usa holiday.
Mines preloaded with Europe and there isnt enough room for N. America as well so after instruction 10 has finished I go into the updated MapSource v6.15.6 (was on 6.13) where it asks to unlock the map. so using the instructions here I get my unit id fill in the keygen for the Map Product '2005' and hit the lower Generate button. Back to MapSource's unlock screen, hit the Unlock Regions tab Add button. Paste the key and there you have the unlocked map. Now MapInstall can be used to build the gmapsupp.img file (about 1.2GB) direct to an SD card in a card reader. Switch on nuvi, pop in the SD card and the unit picks it up. It doesn't matter if you already have a gmapsupp.img file in your internal nuvi memory, the two get on happily side by side. Remove the card and the N America map vanishes, it does not alter your nuvi's internal memory.
