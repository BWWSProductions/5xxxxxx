Description..

Zombie's follow-up to Educated Horses was still unnamed as of May, 2008. 
Zombie posted an update on his website stating: 
"Well, we have for the first time ever written more songs than we need for an album. 
Everything isn't 100% finished, but everything is moving along great. 
No release date yet." In August 2008, a new (instrumental) song entitled "Tyrannosaurus Rex" , 
featuring John 5 on guitar, was uploaded onto Zombie's MySpace music page. 
In an interview published in December 2008, 
Zombie spoke about his new band lineup ( John 5, Piggy D, and Tommy C), 
and how happy he was with his new band members, 
saying, "I've never had a band that I could call my good friends until now."

Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
