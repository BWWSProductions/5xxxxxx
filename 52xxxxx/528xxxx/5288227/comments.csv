Many thnx in advance-I know the program and it works like a charm...better than Adobe acrobat!"
,z0rbot,2010-01-30T21:41Z,"The read-me isn't quite clear, so for those that don't understand:

Step 1: Install the program fully.
Step 2: Launch the program and click activate
Step 3: When it asks you to enter an activation key, right under the text box should be a link that says to manually activate through your web browser. Click that. And copy the install ID.
Step 4: Start the keygen and it should be self-explanatory."
,wizeazz,2010-02-09T19:42Z,"keygen works fine!

,MrWeedz,2010-02-12T21:45Z,"I tried as explained by z0rbot, but it gives me an error after putting down ID + generated keygen. Maybe the ID is blacklisted?
Can anyone try and explain what I'm doing wrong...thnks in advance!"
,pyrex101,2010-04-08T02:43Z,"This is the 32bit version, will not install on 64bit Windows 7."
,pyrex101,2010-04-08T03:08Z,..but download the 64bit version from the website and otherwise activate the same way with keygen
,dsf1,2010-05-15T17:34Z,"Works great! Installed on Win 7 64 bits, downloaded the 64-bit version from the official site and followed z0rbot instructions! Thank you! :)"

worked like a charm..

People who have problems with win7 x64 download the setup from nitro site and use the keygen"
,martianka,2010-06-06T20:44Z,"It's 6 June 2010 and I don't think this hack is working any more. 

Or I am doing something wrong (but I can usually manage these installations without problems).

Please can someone confirm whether the crack still works?

I use the pregenerated trial install ID, enter that into the keygen and try to use licence that it generates on the Nitro website. The website does not generate an activation code, it just gives a message about ""general error"".

Am I doing something wrong or are they on to the hack? 
"
,martianka,2010-06-06T20:52Z,"Edit: Don't be distracted by all this talk about going online, it's not necessary: Here is a comment from another thread, this works: 
==============================
A window saying ""continue trial"" and ""activate now"" will appear. Select ""activate now"".

Click on the link which contains something like ""activate without web browser"" or something similar. I dont remember exactly.

Now, a window with an install id will be displayed. Copy and paste this id into the keygen attached with the torrent, and then click generate.

An activation id will be generated. Copy and paste it to the big activation area provided in the software window, and click activate. 
=============================="
,Fogghost,2010-06-13T14:32Z,Works fine. Thanks
,shenemet,2010-07-01T13:30Z,"Cheers for this, and thanks z0rbot for the instructions."
,mr_dee,2010-07-02T11:21Z,"Sorry, but the activation is not working at all for me.
It keeps telling me I did not enter enough digits, and when using a serial which I downloaded from serials.ws, it tells me serial can only be numbers.

I have tried both direct activation and activating through a browser.
Can anybody help, please?"
,m.softwares,2010-08-07T21:40Z,"how do i get the installation id?
