,slipperysleep,2010-01-29T07:53Z,i extracted the iso and installed the game but when i click play game it tells me i need the cd in the drive. What do i do? sorry im new
,Unk1nd,2010-01-30T03:25Z,"I'm no expert, but it sounds like you need a CD emulator. Daemon tools and Alcohol 120% are the most common tools I believe. Download one of those and see if that works."
,CompuTerror,2010-02-12T20:50Z,"With the latest updates (That you can find on http://www.patches-scrolls.de ) you don't need the CD anymore, but you need to copy the files StarCraft.mpq from the StarCraft CD to the installed dir, and the file BroodWar.mpq from the BroodWar CD to the install-dir."
,CompuTerror,2010-02-12T21:03Z,"I'm sorry. I forgot... The files aren't named Starcraft.mpq and BroodWar.mpq on the CD's. They are named INSTALL.EXE, so you have to rename them :-)"
,darbyson,2010-02-15T07:25Z,"I recommend downloading a program to mount or burn the game, IE Dameon tools, its free and easy to use"
,PyroPsychZach,2010-02-26T17:51Z,"Thanks for this- Works fine, no viruses.

Anyways, to anyone who has trouble with the whole ""Insert CD"" thing, just follow these steps..

1) Download an image mounter (PowerISO, Daemon Tools, etc...)
2) Open the mounting program of your choice and select Mount Image.
3) Find where you've saved the ISO file for the game. Remember, it will take less time to do all of this if you don't extract the ISO; simply put it somewhere you won't forget it. (Desktop?)
4) (Remember to have a blank CD in the disc drive!) You should get an uploading menu; find where you've put the ISO, and upload it. The game has now been mounted.
5) Wait a sec, and if nothing happens, remove the disc and put it back in. You should get the regular installation menu for the game.
6) Install & have fun playing!"

,ThalesII,2010-05-21T16:05Z,Will this work over battlenet.com?
,Baron_Von_Bullsh-t,2010-05-24T19:23Z,"""Will this work over battlenet.com? ""

No, however you can play on private servers, for instance, like, gamerangers. All you have to do is download their apps and find a game, and thats it. Amazingly quite a few people still play this online."
