VERY NICE BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER FANS OUTSIDE UK??

I decided to share this CD on FLAC format. The best is to play with Foobar2000 player for excellent sound and to see the cover bundled right inside the FLAC files ;-)

You can also burn the album in an audio cd through the FLAC encoder + Cue file!

Any questions and comments, post me here in the comments section.

Because this CD was FREE and for promotion I guess it is not too bad to share it with other people outside UK as this CD is not available anywhere else!
