[V],jmb2012,2010-01-20T07:22Z,"Excuse me, I was only stating the fact that I had uploaded the exact same thing 2 days prior and that he was parting the swarms. 

I'm not VIP, I'm not uploading here no more. I have no time for these games. 

I apologize if I offended anyone. 

I will not upload until I get my green skull back."

whatever I feel insulted. Until I see a green skull beside my name I will not upload here. This is my favorite site I really don't want to stop but......"
