Give speed please"
,Phillakied,2010-01-21T04:34Z,It works fine. Nothing wrong with it so far. Just for Unrar you suppose to put the thing on the desktop. Apart from that thank you so much! (^_^)
,Phillakied,2010-02-15T16:07Z,you gonna have to undo the steps if you want to install mods cause the launcher goes straight for sims 3 game and not that little menu. 
,jmbelardo,2010-02-17T11:31Z,Thanks a lot. It works great. But you really have to follow the instruction provided in the downloaded file. 
,lollipopp__,2010-02-25T16:58Z,doesn't work for me.. I can't even open the goddamn .rar file. 
,nrenae,2010-05-06T06:13Z,how can this be the entire game when it's only 4mb? this can't be right.

,joshmb,2011-01-14T13:25Z,this works fine on my older version of sims 3 it was version 1.7 or something (not sure as the launcher no longer opens) so this may work with older versions
,DurtySocks,2011-01-15T01:06Z,"What's the latest version this thing is confirmed to work for?
Post your versions if it works"
,keightie,2011-05-01T07:22Z,"Okay so I couldn't open the stuff in the Cracked folder so i put it on a USB and opened with with a PC then got the serial code and typed it into my mac, then I finally got to the sims game menu and pressed play only to get an error message telling me to put the Sims disk in my computer before I can play.......

,superb77,2011-08-30T13:25Z,The launcher won't open when i open the game? 
,Schmetterling2012,2011-12-23T23:23Z,"I did everything exactly as described, but once I changed the .plist file when I try to open the game the screen with the logo come up for a couple of seconds, then disappears along with the icon in my dock.  

The only thing I can think is that I'm using OSX 10.5.8.  Anyone know why or what I can do?  This is about the 10th crack I've attempted to use, so I'm started to get pretty frustrated."
,Getthere1,2012-01-27T14:44Z,"how can i update it to the 1.8.25 v?

i tried it without doing the update and it didnt work.
i have a expansion.... so it asks for the expansion CD and not the the sims3 CD u think that may be one of the problems?"
,Cyanpearl,2012-05-18T00:58Z,"I'm having the same issue Schmetterling was.
""I did everything exactly as described, but once I changed the .plist file when I try to open the game the screen with the logo come up for a couple of seconds, then disappears along with the icon in my dock.""
