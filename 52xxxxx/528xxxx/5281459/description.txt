The National (newspaper) quote: 

"WikiLeaks produced more scoops than the Washington Post in the last 30 years" 


WikiLeaks Release 1.0 



During the last 12 months WikiLeaks representatives have been talking at numerous conferences, from technology via human rights to media focused, in an effort to introduce WikiLeaks to the world. WikiLeaks has had major document releases that have spawned attention in all major newspapers by now, it has triggered important reform and has established itself as part of the accepted media reality. 

Little did we have the chance though to talk about a bigger picture, especially of how we perceive the future and its constraints. 

We therefore would like to talk about our vision of the information society, journalism's role in that society, as well as our role in it. Along this vision we will introduce new features for WikiLeaks Release 1.0, that will be no short of changing the world as we all know it.
