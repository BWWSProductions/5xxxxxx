Product Description:
In the high-stakes world of Midnight Outlaw, the only 
thing that matters is speed. Midnight Outlaw: Illegal 
Street Drag lets you test this belief in races where you 
can win money and respect. A well-run race can earn 
you enough money to upgrade your car with engine 
enhancements, ground effects, a paint job, and stereos. 
The fastest speeds require perfect harmony between 
acceleration, shifting, and nitrous. If you go too fast, the 
cops will surely be on your tail.
