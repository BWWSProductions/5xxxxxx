i decided to rip my cd's in higher quality
(and of course to share).
to keep track of the torrents i made so far, 
i deleted the ones with lower quality-files."
,takeaimnfire,2011-11-09T16:22Z,Thanks for the up man.  My cassette is dead as a doornail from rewinding this thing 10 billion times to figure out the riffs.  lol  I didn't even know they actually even made a cd out of this.
