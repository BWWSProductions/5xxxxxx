From the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team (F.A.R.T.) comes this F.A.R.T.-approved video with the original soundtrack!

(This episode has now been commercially released with its original soundtrack. Since no restoration was necessary, the F.A.R.T. team elected to post this episode from a broadcast by WFMZ-TV, channel 69. Quality is very good.)
