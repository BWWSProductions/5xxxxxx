[::Recensione::]

High Voltage is the first internationally-released album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. Originally released on Atlantic Records, this edition of High Voltage has proven popular, selling 3 million units in the United States alone. However, the album was panned by some critics upon its release, including a review by Rolling Stone magazine that called it an "all-time low" for the hard rock genre. It was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.
Prior to the release of the international version of High Voltage, AC/DC had already released their debut album under the name High Voltage a year before. This album was released in Australia only and had a different track listing than the international release, which only included two tracks from the original album.[1] The international release of High Voltage also had a different album cover than the original, featuring a picture of Angus Young as he appeared on the single for "It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)" released in Australia. A third cover was also used on the international version's original European release.
Most editions of the international album have a version of "It's A Long Way To The Top" that is shorter than the version on the original Australian release. The full length version is 5:15, while the edited version fades out early at 5:01. Vinyl editions of the international album contain the edited version. The 1994 remastered CD on Atco Records restored the track to the full length. The 2003 remastered CD on Epic Records reverts back to the edited version again.
