Please be aware that someone is anonymously uploading 
torrents to The Pirate Bay that duplicate my torrent
names and copy-paste my descriptions.

An example is here: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5285597/Alex_Jones_Show_-_2010_Jan_15_FR_%5Bsebaygo1%5D

THESE ARE NOT MINE AND I HAVE NO IDEA 
WHAT THEY MAY CONTAIN!!!

If you have any doubt about whether a torrent is 
legitimately one of mine, please go here:

Thank you.
