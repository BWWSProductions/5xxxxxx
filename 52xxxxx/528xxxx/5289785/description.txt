Alex talks with Phoenix's most highly decorated lawman, military veteran, former hostage negotiator for the FBI, and author and radio talk show host Jack McLamb about the BATF and Austin, Texas, police effort to chill the Second Amendment by illegally banning gun sales between individuals at gun shows. 


Alex also covers the latest news and takes your calls.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
