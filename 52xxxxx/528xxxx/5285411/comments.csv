Have you found any other gems on the internet recently?"
[V],rambam1776,2010-01-17T09:42Z,"B - 

Well, you may have heard of the GREAT Britcom called 'Black Books.' I just discovered it, and it's already here on TPB and well seeded, but I'm collecting multiple standup by its star, Dylan Moran, and plan to release a collection. The guy is excellent."
,Broderzen,2010-01-17T18:09Z,"I have not heard of either of those, will check them out! You shoould start recommending some of your 'cool well seeded finds' since  you uploaded the 'cool unseeded' torrents :D

Random - I think you should look into Usenet. This sounds like an advertisement, but for $11 a month you get SECURE download speeds at maxed out connections (I usually get 800kb to 1mb). Pretty much all the British TV shows and big releases are on there..... It's cool because you don't have to waste TheBox ratio on things that have come out after 1999. There are also TONS of documentaries.
It really is worth it, better and cheaper than cable xD"

I have only the vaguest notion of USENET. Google searches lead to descriptive pages that are not exactly clear. If you could include a link here, or go to TPB Forum and send me a PM so we can communicate via email, I'd be glad to learn more. I can't post my email here for obvious reasons."
