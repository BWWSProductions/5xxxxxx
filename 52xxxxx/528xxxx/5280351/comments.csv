[V],mothergoose56,2010-01-15T03:21Z,I had it ready to go like 30+ minutes ago but something came up.....
[V],mothergoose56,2010-01-15T03:26Z,"If it isn't up by around 8ish I'll try to at least let everyone know whats going on. If I don't then either some important RLS is going on or I'm dead. O&A by 7, R&F by 8 - those are my new goals. It's no noon 12:30 but it'll have to do. Props to shuazien for continuing to take care of the early crowd....."
