Mad Men is set in the 1960s, initially at the fictional Sterling Cooper advertising agency on Madison Avenue in New York City. The show centers on Don Draper (Jon Hamm), creative director at Sterling Cooper, as well as those in his life in and out of the office. It also depicts the changing social mores of 1960s America.
