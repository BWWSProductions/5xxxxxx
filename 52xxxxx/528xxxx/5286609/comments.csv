,dezertx,2010-01-20T02:13Z,"Audio is out of synchro. 
If you use an AC3 filter go to System and set -5000ms Audio/Video sync Time shift. That can help."
,jerseywizkid,2010-01-20T05:21Z,you have the greatest uploads on the net.....thank you for ur hard work!!!!! lol u made my girlfriend happy that we have a ps3 :)
,ChillyCrossFoot,2010-01-20T12:27Z,"What is up the A/V Sync issues? Got the same problem with your SAW upload too! What is the problem here, and how can I fix it?
Using
MPC-Home Cinema, CoreAVC 2, FFDShow Audio decoders, Haali Splitter."
,AjaxTorbin,2010-01-20T16:15Z,"For those with the CCCP codec pack with the Halli splitter and ffdshow audio decoder, set the audio for -5000ms and your sound should sync fine."
,AjaxTorbin,2010-01-20T16:17Z,"Actually, any decoder that allows for manual setting should take that same setting, but I know it works for ffdshow."
,sinister007,2010-01-20T23:09Z,Thanks for another great rip>..
,jktrigger,2010-01-21T18:35Z,Thanks Myth! Another great release!

,renshaw,2010-01-30T09:38Z,"for the record faffi , for a simple solution use MKVToolnix(http://www.afterdawn.com/software/video_software/video_tools/mkvtoolnix.cfm) with an audio delay of -200 ....its an easy way...no need to demux ....still havin any doubt mate"
,syedasadhn,2010-02-06T22:18Z,Please seed...
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-02-14T14:02Z,Sucks it's out of sync. All I know is I'm afraid to waste burning a DVD if the audio is going to be out of sync. Thanks for the upload though. Until you used your new encoding method you were doing pretty good all around.
,Mokoko34,2010-02-15T06:34Z,"Thanks again Secret, you always come though with the BD releases! 

Guys, to those of your worried about getting busted by your ISP use PeerBlock and run it while downloading/uploading. I have used this for a long time now and the only times I received warnings from my ISP was when I forgot to turn it on."
,Mokoko34,2010-02-15T06:35Z,"@JACK, just do like renshaw said above and fix the delay with megui or YAMB (google). "
,sosasami,2010-02-17T22:46Z,"The sound is off. It's both not in sync with the video (which is an easy fix) but it's also encoded incorrectly. There is something very weird about the 6 channels - only the left is projecting all the main sound. The right speaker is acting as a back. It's all wrong.

(Thanks for the release anyway though ;)"
,killbill1964,2010-03-04T00:08Z,Use Peerblock.....peerguardian is a bit flakey at the mo :)
,BrokenEmpires,2010-03-17T09:48Z,"Nuke the torrent. This shit is straight ass. 
Way too many complaints fool. Just take this shit down.
