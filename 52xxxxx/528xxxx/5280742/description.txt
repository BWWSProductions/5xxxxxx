[ Plot ]
Adventures of Power is an epic comedy about a mine-worker
named Power whose love of drums and lack of musical skill has
turned him into the ridiculed "air drummer" of his small town
But when Power's union-leader father calls a strike at the
mine, Power discovers an underground subculture of air
drummers who just might hold the key to changing the world
Power's journey across America brings him face-to-face with
his town's greatest enemy, and allows him to discover the beat
within his own heart
