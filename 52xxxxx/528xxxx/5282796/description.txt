"John Stossel is a paranoid, insane, lying hypocrite."

â€œCrony Capitalismâ€ re-airs tonight at 10pm EST, so if you missed it you can see what got some people so mad.

I discussed the many examples where Big Business has used the clout of Big Government to get special privileges or protect themselves from competition.

My first example was a little window company, Serious Materials, who got an unusual amount of presidential praise and special favors â€“ including a recent â€˜greenâ€™ tax credit.  Not everyone was happy to see this story.

Mary Madigan: "I watch your show, but frankly I think this story is pathetic. John, you are getting too close to [â€¦] Sensational Journalism. Iâ€™m seeing a story where there is no real story."

Michael: "This is lazy, sound bite journalism of the worst kind. If there is story there, go find the FACTS, and tell us!"

Fortunately, most people liked the show:

Liberty Lover: "John, Great show, just like the other ones. Keep up the good work. I like how you maintain your political independence: criticize lawmakers of both parties when they commit such stupidityâ€¦"

Capt. Karl: "Mr. Stossel, GREAT JOB on this vital subject matter tonight! Thank you"

Some viewers suggested alternative titles for the topic â€“ â€œmercantilism,â€ â€œsocialism,â€ and â€œcorporatismâ€.   My wife wanted me to call it the â€œun-free market.â€   None of those seemed as clear to me as crony capitalism, so I choose that.

The show will also re-air Saturday at 7pm EST, and Sunday at 11pm.
