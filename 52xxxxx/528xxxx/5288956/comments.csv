Does that mean that you own the rights to these songs and are giving us permission to use them?  Because otherwise I don't see how you COULD use them legally.

Just curious."

,mx0xm,2010-04-04T16:50Z,"Sorry for the mix-up guys. I have a paid iTunes library. I cut these ringtones from it. I don't support illegal music downloads, so I paid for them. Then I uploaded the ringtones here that I cut myself, for you guys. I support downloading ringtones since I paid for them. Anyway, Happy Easter and there will be more uploads soon with better ringtones."
