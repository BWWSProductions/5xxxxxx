Night Raven - The Collected Stories (Steve Parkhouse David Lloyd & John Bolton 1990)

Night Raven is a fictional superhero appearing primarily in Marvel UK Comics, a division of Marvel Comics.

Night Raven first appeared in Hulk Comic #1 (Mach 7, 1979).

Originally created by editors Dez Skinn and Richard Burton, the early Night Raven stories were written by Steve Parkhouse with art by David Lloyd. Dez Skinn's immediate superior, Stan Lee, did not like David Lloyd's "blocky" artwork and John Bolton became Lloyd's replacement artist towards the end of the strip's initial run. The original Night Raven strip was greatly influenced by the pulp characters of the 1930s (the time period in which the strip was set), especially The Shadow and The Spider. 

Stan Lee felt the strip would work better in a contemporary setting, and so the time period of the strip was eventually shifted forward to the present through the plot device of putting both Night Raven and his nemesis, the Dragon Lady-like Yi Yang, into suspended animation and reviving them in modern times.

Night Raven was one of the few original characters created for Marvel UK in the 1980s, and quickly became a fan-favorite. During the decade, Night Raven appeared in various Marvel UK titles, including a run of text stories beginning in Marvel Superheroes by Alan McKenzie and continued in The Daredevils by Alan Moore and Jamie Delano.

In the 1990s the character had only a handful of appearances, most prominent of which was a graphic novel, Night Raven: House of Cards. The character's first American appearance was in a supporting role in the graphic novel Fury/Black Widow: Death Duty.
