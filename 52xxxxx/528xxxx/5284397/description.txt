Anywhere but Home is the first live album and DVD by rock band Evanescence, released in 2004. It includes all four of their Fallen music videos, an hour of behind the scenes features, and a recording of a concert at Le ZÃ©nith in Paris. It also includes a previously unreleased song on the CD, titled "Missing" (which also plays during the DVD credits); while placed at the end of the disc, the CD insert shows it as track eight however it is actually track 14 and incorrectly labeled whisper.

A secret performance of "Bring Me to Life" in Las Vegas, Nevada can be found on the DVD's main menu by moving the cursor to the largest thorn on the left-hand side of the screen. The band symbol then becomes visible. When selected, this will take you to the hidden footage.
