The Untold Legend of the Batman is a three-issue Batman comic book mini-series published by DC Comics in 1980. It was written by Len Wein, and drawn by Jim Aparo and on the first issue, also John Byrne.  The primary plot elements of the story are retellings of the origins of several Batman characters.

As a marketing tool, each issue of the series was available in a special "MPI Audio Edition", accompanied by an audio cassette containing a performance of the text of the issue, with musical cues.  These are included in this pack as .mp3 files.
The issues were smaller than standard DC comic books, at nine inches tall and six inches wide.  Inside the front and back covers of each issue were black-and-white reprints of classic Batman covers, with a caption of "Great Moments in Batman's History".
