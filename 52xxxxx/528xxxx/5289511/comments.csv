,suspect99,2011-02-22T18:18Z,"its overdubbed with a language thats not english. I cannot find a way to change the audio track. I don't even know what language its dubbed in.

very poor job uploader!"
,softripper,2011-05-01T07:52Z,The BG means bulgarian. Nice collection. Thanks for the upload @thenoobish!
[T],FatFreddy44,2011-08-05T20:46Z,More cartoons here
,white_arcades,2012-02-17T17:13Z,"This collection contains a few decent rarities but as for the complete TV Series, it comprises mostly poor quality TV rips with only Bulgarian audio. For a 56GB torrent the description by the uploader leaves a lot to be desired. BG Audio? Would typing ""Bulgarian"" have been too much effort to save countless English speakers downloading 56GB of completely useless material? "
