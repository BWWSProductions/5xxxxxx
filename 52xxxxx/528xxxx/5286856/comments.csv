Thank you for wasting my time and people here, DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS!

Yes, I know it's a free shit here, but maybe next time before you upload any torrent, you should check more carefully, what you're uploading..."
,eleventy4,2010-08-01T08:50Z,"There's more things wrong with this torrent than just fucked up files.  Allow me to indulge you.

1. There was no MTV Unplugged session.  There was an MTV live show, and a few acoustic sessions, but this show is very mislabeled.  

2. Rated L?  What the hell is that?  Named bootlegs suck.  But that isn't necessarily the uploaders fault.  Dates and locations are better.

3. The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys isn't Josh Homme's solo album.  It's a movie soundtrack, where Josh Homme performed on 4 tracks.  3 are instrumental, and are performed with Chris Goss and/or Nick Oliveri, former QOTSA members.  

In summation, epic fail.  I try not to be a troll, but look for a QOTSA discography elsewhere.  "
