,Chocolatehonnei,2010-02-24T23:04Z,"@  PackFan4Life I found it located in the downloaded file folder in a sub folder named Crack, hopes this helps ;)
@ wwerko I think the instructions state you run the 32 bit if you opened the 32 bit 3ds max....
. Start the keygen. If you started 32bit 3DS Max, you need to run the 32bit keygen even if you run 64bit OS.
As far as the memory patch part.... I got a successful  patch by starting the 3ds max, selecting activate, then opening the gen as a admin and clicking on patch then I copy and pasted and generated I don't run into a problem until I hit next ....then I get a error :("

I had the same problem when i was starting the 64 version (win7 x64 here). But when i started the 32-bit version and launched the 32 keygen (with admin rights enabled) all worked fine. You must succesfully execute the keygen's mem patch, it will work after that although you miss the 8 characters of the activation key. Hope this helps :)"

,neromax,2011-03-03T04:28Z,"Awesome upload Ubehage very nicely done. I'm using win 7 pro 64bit and its 100% Only mistake I made was to burn it to dvd and then the mempatch couldn't write to a finalised dvd. So I made a folder on desktop and copied all the files over from the dvd and I intalled it from the desktop. Long way round but hey HO, So Just copy the contents of the ISO file to the desktop save wasting a dvd and quicker incase any noobies do what I done:) Happy Days!!!! thanks"
,4trez,2011-03-04T20:17Z,"Hi, Ubehage and thanks for the great upload.  I was having the same trouble activating, but after reading all the comments these are the steps I took.

First off I'm running Win7 64bit cpu
& I already had Maya 2010 Installed

--so it seemed if I was having conflicts between the two programs, but I was feeling too lazy to uninstall maya....

So first I opened up C://Users/YourUserName/Adlm    folder and moved my maya reg email and reg info files onto my desktop.

Ran the install with all the default setup and followed Ubehage's instructions.  When you go to fire up Max for the first time just fire up the 32bit version first following his instructions and use the 32bit keyg** once done both 32bit and 64bit are activated.
Then I went to move my maya files that I moved to the desktop back to their respective folder and fired up maya.  Maya worked but gave a splash.dll error so to fix that error go to your start menu in the search bar type: maya.env

then click on it and it will open in either wordpad or notebook 

then type in :   MAYA_DISABLE_CIP=1

save it and close it fire up maya again and no more splash.dll error.


Hope this helps some1 else too.  Once again thanks for the great torrent :)"
,Jedhouse,2011-03-05T02:06Z,"Hi, when i started the installation everything went fine and suddently it was asking me to insert disk 1, i'm no noob installer but if this was properly done, the instructions would have mentioned this :F"
,Mindhunter89,2011-03-13T18:08Z,"I tried to install (win7 / 32bit) and had a problem with the activation: the generated code wasn't long enough and I wasn't able to activate.

,danxl5,2011-04-30T02:55Z,"So, I had both AutoCad 2010 and 2011 installed. After they were removed, everything worked fine. I suggest RevoUninstaller for the best removal. It found left over stuff that may have clogged progress.

Follow 4trez's instructions, and things should work fine. For AutoCad however, my files were in the install directory, ProgramFiles and such.

I did not want to go searching for files, so I uninstantiated them. I found the left over files were in the location he said, but just not in users.

FYI, I'm on 32bit Win7 Ultimate. Great upload, thanks a ton."

,BrookeAnne,2011-08-04T21:40Z,I have a problem that I cant figure out. I install and everything goes ok. Then when I re run the program and get to the pont I need the keygen I see they are gone. I try to extract them again to the crack directory and they are visible for a few seconds then vanish again. No matter where I extract them to they are only visible for a moment then vanish. I put them on a USB drive and pulled it out as sson as they appeared and they were still there when I accessed the drive again but as soon as I tried to access those files they vanish again. I have to think this is some type of anti P2P scheme that autodesk has come up with. Any suggestions ?
,leozin13,2011-08-05T06:36Z,"BrookeAnne  if you have AVG antivirus running, you have to DISABLE the ""Resident protection"" or if you hava AVAST, Norton, etc. DISABLE or STOP the antivirus!! Because it will recognize the Keygen as a virus but its not! Its a false positive as we say. "

This uploader done the stupidest thing of creating extremely basic instructions assuming everything would go well, they have also made no attempts to address these issues or help people with problems.

Problem senarios:

Q:
i get the ""you need to apply patch when licence screen appears"" error, what shall i do?

A:
Run the file as administrator! (right click --> run as administrator). also, if you installed the 32 bit, run 32 bit crack and if you installed 64 bit version, RUN 64 BIT CRACK!

Q:
I get the ""Make sure you can write to current directory"" error, what am i doing wrong?

A: 
You are running it directly from your ""CD"". Copy it from the ""CD"" to the desctop and run it from there.

Q:
I get the ""Registration - Activation Error (0015.111)"" after i enter the keygene string. what shall i do?

A:
When you enter the ""Request Code"" into the keygene you must erase all spacess between the characters.

hope it helps :)"
