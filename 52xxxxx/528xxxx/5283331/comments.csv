,kratos6631,2010-01-16T09:50Z,whats the quality? a/v
,karan4444,2010-01-16T09:53Z,"the video its self was a little dark so we adjusted the contrast, lum, colors and sharpened it a tad to make it look just that much better... Audio is AC3 to keep that nice crisp sound while watching!!"
,PhilLesh12,2010-01-16T09:54Z,"@karan, 

click on the uploader's name, and see how long they've been uploading.  Fakers don't last more than a few hours on this site.  cgaurav007 has been posting long enough to have 30+ screens full of torrents:

Don't forget, this is awards season.  Any movie that is in theaters now or soon will be, as well as all the movies from the past year will be on a screener sent out to industry people in hopes of getting noticed for some award or another.

THIS IS REAL."

,iamneo33,2010-03-07T18:35Z,"How to tell a fake!!

1 - seeders are more than leachers

2 - A million comments about how great the quality is(screeners are not ever great)

3 - 10 other torrents come out at the exact same time, the exact same size, having the exact same comments

4 - screen shots that seem to be accepted  and never disappear on public websites

5 -When these fake torrents are released, for some reason they have +1000 seeds instantly

Is this torrent fake? Tracked?  Use these common sense clarifiers.  The movie industry obviously does not use common sense...

Take care and Download safe...
