Information:
The terms alien abduction or abduction phenomenon describe "subjectively real memories of being taken secretly and/or against oneâ€™s will by apparently nonhuman entities and subjected to complex physical and psychological procedures." People claiming to have been abducted are usually called "abductees" or "experiencers." Typical claims involve the experiencer being subjected to a forced medical examination which emphasizes their reproductive system. Abductees sometimes claim to have been warned against environmental abuse and the dangers of nuclear weapons. Consequently, while many of these purported encounters are described as terrifying, some have been viewed as pleasurable or transformative.
