,Tamarind777,2010-01-19T00:45Z,"This is NOT a ""popular science book,"" but a religious book. Evolution is not science, but religion. None of it is based on observable science, but faith. Besides, DUH-kins is one of the most nonscientific and ignorant persons there is. Evolution is not even common sense. How can you ever prove that fossils had offsprings (in order to be related to something else, you must have offsprings to pass on your genes). Maybe that fossil was the last of it's kind and went extinct w/o having any kids. Duh-kins is a biologist and he doesn't know this. Evolution is such nonsense. "
,sistromo,2010-01-19T02:13Z,"Tamarind777, do you really think anybody with a minimum of common sense will give a second though to your ignorant, opinionated objections to a topic as complex as evolution by natural selection, when you are unable to do anything as simple as knowing when to use ""its"" or ""it's""? Do yourself a favor and go back to school."

Which religion is the right one though?"
