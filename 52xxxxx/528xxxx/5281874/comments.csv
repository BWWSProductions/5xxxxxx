,matelian,2010-01-15T21:35Z,"is this true HD or fake ??

from my point it is a fake coz of the file space"
,HatsuneMiku,2010-01-16T17:45Z,"Other Fake?
or is upscale 480p for 720p?
And NOT have a ~sample~... FAIL
Surely, it is fake!!!"
,Skurp,2010-01-18T18:33Z,"It's the right movie, but now there are no seeders :(

From what little I've seen the video is ok (there's quite alot of film grain but it could be intentional) and sound seems ok (have only listened through my earphones at this point)

But what is the point of putting this up if you're not gonna seed. "
,RoTaN09,2010-01-19T01:16Z,2.43GB for a 720p movie?  Yeah this is surely a fake - this movie as a 720p would at least be 8-10GB alone for the length of it.
,Skurp,2010-01-19T02:41Z,"2.43Gb for 720p isn't unusual. Check around and you'll see.

Now there are some seeders too. Maybe I'll finally get to 100%

I'm at 88%. It's definitely the right movie. Resolution is 1280x720 video quality is good, not the best 720 I've seen but not the worst. Still haven't run it through the speakers so I can't say anything about sound, more than it's there :)"
,RickStv,2010-01-19T12:55Z,"Confirmed fake, bloated TS"
,wrldgt,2010-01-19T17:27Z,"It looks like a DVD Rip with Cam Audio (sounds muffled at times).

I guess i'll have this one till SecretMyth does a 720p bluray."
,eisenseite,2010-01-19T19:14Z,are people really that stupid?? they do a divx TS and recode it to mkv?? wtf! idiots.... dont download it if you want to see a hd movie
,somedude.1001,2010-01-19T22:27Z,"Wrong section and WRONG DESCRIPTION.

Dont download if youre looking for nHD."
,Skurp,2010-01-19T23:50Z,"well it is 1280x720. If its cam the video is really great quality, if it's bluray is pretty mediocre.

I'd say V:6 A:3 (for a 720)
Audio Is not too good (a bit muffeled) and only stereo.

But to GENERAL19's defense all of that is stated in the description. the only thing not stated is whether it's bluray or not (I suspect not).

Also mkv is not a codec its a container like avi or mp4. H264, mpeg-4 and wmv are codecs.

Conclusion: The description is correct (some interesting info could be added like the source), The section is correct it IS 1280x720. The video is ok (6/10) and the sound is bad (3/10)."
,trntz_man,2010-01-20T05:36Z,"I love how everyone is arguing in here and yet has General answered any of these to confirm the video being HD. I do believe this is not true HD because his file is the only file currently up that claims to be HD. If it was HD there will be hundreds of other users uploading their own files.

Also, by the way, there are plenty of HD mkv files that are small file sizes. It is possible to make a HD movie that small without loosing too much quality."
,somedude.1001,2010-01-20T07:29Z,"The DVD and Blu-ray havent even been released.

Scaled up CAM vid is not HD."
,Skurp,2010-01-20T20:45Z,"HD only means High Definition so scaled up cam could be HD, but scaled up cam can't be a bluray rip.

But then again it doesn't say in the definition that this is bluray (dosen't even say HD) it only states a resolution."
,somedude.1001,2010-01-20T21:33Z,"Uploader conveniently omited the CAM/TS note.

If youre ok with scaling up--lets say 320x200--phone cam videos to 720p/1080p and call it HD then be my guest. Good luck sorting out the fake ones when this kind of mislabeled crap become more common."
