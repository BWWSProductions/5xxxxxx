#STORY#:

Avatar: The Game's only redeeming features are its impressive graphics and the fact that it offers something different to the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions. The latter, though, isn't much of a redeeming feature - it's just something we're not used to with Wii versions of multiplatform games. But, credit where credit's due - the graphics are great. Pandora's jungle environment has been impressively brought to life on the power-starved Wii. It's lush, with ambient sound that does a convincing job of making the environment feel alive. The flying levels look particularly good, and the vistas are genuinely stunning for the Wii. It's just a shame that Avatar: The Game is better watched than played.

Indeed it's a crying shame, because if you were able to map the various actions to button presses the entire game would be vastly improved (why can't I fly with the Nunchuck analogue stick?), while the stealth gameplay occasionally shows glimpses of what could have been. What has been, unfortunately, is yet another disappointing movie tie-in.
