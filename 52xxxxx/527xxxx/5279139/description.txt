Guido and Maurizio de Angelis are Italian musicians.

The brothers were born in Rocca di Papa, near Rome; Guido de Angelis 
in 1944 (22 December), and Maurizio de Angelis in 1947 (22 February). 
Their musical career started in 1963, where, after successfully pub-
lishing an LP, they became arrangers for RCA Italiana. Their success 
led to many more albums in which they composed, arranged, and sang 
the music.

The De Angelis brothers were among the most prolific Italian musi-
cians of the 1970s. In fact, they were forced to use different names 
for many of their projects to avoid over-saturating the market. One 
of these was Oliver Onions, which eventually became the name they 
were mostly identified with.

Although they released many standalone albums, it is for their 
soundtrack work for which the De Angelis brothers are best known. Out 
of their many scores, undoubtedly the most famous and popular are 
those composed for the Terence Hill and Bud Spencer comedies. Their 
song "Dune Buggy" for the film Watch Out, We're Mad reached the top 
of the charts in Europe.

They are also known for their work on animated series, having com-
posed original songs for Italian-dubbed anime (such as Doraemon, 
Ashita no Joe and Galaxy Express 999) and European series (such as 
Around the World with Willy Fog).

They made music also for title song of Sandokan serie, which was 
based on the novel E. Salgari.

They are also famous for writing and composing the themes to Dogta-
nian and the Three Muskehounds and Bobobobs.

In November 2007, they gave their first concert in 25 years at the 
Lucca Comics Festival.

Their theme for Zorro (1974), "Zorro Is Back," was featured in Wes 
Anderson's Bottle Rocket.
