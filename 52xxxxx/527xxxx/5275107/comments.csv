,scruffsshop,2010-01-15T20:30Z,"what bands or artists do you like from the 70's and 80's? I have probably got them, my auntie was one of the first people with a VCR and we taped everything musical that we could find and always have.
Everything is VHS rip but that is better than nothing"
,PL44,2010-01-20T17:10Z,"Great upload. As you've been asking for requests, here's my challenge ;-). A fan of early 80s synth, I'd like to see the Human League - preferably `Being BoiledÂ´ as it's so rare, and Depeche Mode etc.

Can't wait for your next goodie."
