16 Years of The Old Grey Whistle Test

The music is grouped into three blocks. The first features items from the early days of the programme. The second covers artists or band members who had died since the inception of the programme. These two sequences are medleys, not complete performances. The third, much longer sequence is a more general collection of longer items from 1974 to 1985. Included are some items taken from concert footage, not recorded by the BBC. There are also a few of the quirky videos which were made specially for the programme.
