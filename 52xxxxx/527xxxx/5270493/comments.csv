,fuzz2010,2010-02-13T21:59Z,"i installed it then when my computer was restarted, it said that my subscription had ended and it wouldn't let me do anything, and the trial reset wouldn't work because i couldn't turn the settings off."
,yadhu,2010-02-14T13:44Z,Thank you is too small to mention.

,goodfellaLBC,2010-02-17T23:42Z,Would someone or please seed!!  I'm really in a bind w/ an antivirus and paying for school.  I would appreciate the generosity very much.
,unknowndeath,2010-02-21T19:19Z,"When you use the reset, there's a chance Norton will detect it, and next time you turn on your computer, you have no subscription. Other, than that huge negative, the download is fine."
,lamecomputer,2010-02-23T17:58Z,"Did not work for me. Install worked perfect, crack worked fine. After 2nd restart Norton asked me how I want to uninstall their software. closed the dialogue box and now NAV will not start. Maybe it updated but I only got two days."

,enok1976,2010-03-16T21:32Z,why would anyone in there right mind use notons.. i dont want a slow ass computer
,bulentlee,2010-03-17T07:08Z,"Guys don't be darted .i don't know why anybody is bothering with Norton . best stuff is most of the time the best stuff .
Get Avira its free and very reliable , Google to block the annoying pop up when it updates . very simple task .
Or you can get comodo firewall that also comes with free anti-virus , very good too .AND ITS FREE.
Comodo is the best and free firewall out there .why even bother with this shit is beyond me .
you guys are welcome by the way , cheers !"
,utkarsh09,2010-03-20T21:25Z,"Beware, The TRIAL RESETTER sets the subscription period to 366 days but after few days it automatically resets subscription period to 0 days(expired). It is the major bug of trial reset."
,goleafsgo7,2010-03-21T01:55Z,doesn't work! After a day or two it tells me my subscription as expired
,rohan-india2591084,2010-03-21T05:24Z," dear all, i am having norton internet security 2010 full complete version due to my low upload banwith i am not able to host it if some one has high up speed andwishes to seed it then do mail to me at prasad_family4everyone@yahoo.com"
,coolninad,2010-03-24T04:05Z,"Tried on 20-Mar-2010 on WinXP Pro SP3, works very fine, crack has reset trial period to 366 days !"

,Rsslone,2010-04-07T06:18Z,"For those people who have a bad virus that needs help NOW.. this is the download for you, that is also me, will inform how this works out for me"
,mastertospot,2010-04-08T19:26Z,"Worked perfectly for me. Resets to 366 days left every time i log on, assuming i dint run away for a year and leave my PC running, this is the perfect solution. Software is great too, much smoother than previous memory hogging versions of norton. 8/10"
[T],nlx_78,2010-04-12T18:05Z,THanks :)
,01001010110,2010-04-15T02:22Z,"downloaded at over 1mb/s, very nice havent seen speeds like that 4 a while probably because its such a small file, ill test and post results"

Great up - thank you!!"
,IntheVineyard,2010-04-23T05:08Z,"Whenever I click NTR to install it it says 'NTR... has stopped working'  I've tried a couple different ones, dunno what's wrong.  I should add that I'm pretty bad at the computer things so if it's like some totally stupid reason, feel free to think I'm ignorant."
,IntheVineyard,2010-04-23T05:14Z,"Nevermind, I figured it out. I'm stupid."

,warlockwizard,2010-05-14T06:23Z,The programs not really working fully.  It worked for a day and everytime I rebooted the comp. the trial would be reset to 30 days  Then norton stopped working all together and just goes to a one click support page. I cant even get into a main menu.  I might have to use nod32 again.  Too bad.

,jasonkanz,2010-05-19T04:59Z,"As like many of you. I am too, getting the uninstall message everytime my computer reboots. I do not know whether it is the update that causes this, or my computer rebooting.

,Lucky13s,2010-06-30T09:21Z,"Hope this works, I've been running fine without AV for months, then suddenly out of no where I come home and I have a million viruses on my computer and a million popups on the desktop.

I installed my 2007 version which I own, but all it did was remove a few of them and detect a million emails my IP is trying to send out. Hoping 2010 works and kills these things."
,stephie91,2010-06-30T15:44Z,crap. this only worked a day and then it told me me to buy a subscription. 
,Omis_oz,2010-07-03T04:02Z,"Same problem, same as you other guys on reboot a window pops up to uninstall the product. I suspect an automatic update to the product by norton checks for to see if this hack applied in the package. 

Not surprising Noron are quick to get around it really, as the Norton product is all about detecting software modifications which should not be present."
,chriiillee,2010-07-23T15:21Z,hej
,herbalife05,2010-07-25T16:33Z,"Mine works great! Try this,before you install it,run trialset and ""buy"" it first then you install it.Your trial should run a loong time. I had miner problems like this but then it works perfect. And just in case,don?t have internet connecting while install....Good luck!"
,Lucky13s,2010-08-14T23:02Z,"Managed to get a full month subscription, now I need to redownload so I can trail reset.

Got this stupid fricken animalwaredoctor thing on my computer, it auto installed itself when I downloaded a torrent from here, and I cant get rid of it and it keeps fucking popping up its so fucking annoying. Save me norton!"
,vespoukis,2010-08-19T23:19Z,is the best antivirus!!!
,deathtoallorangatans,2010-08-31T16:50Z,"I read all the comments but there doesn't seem to be a solution listed for the uninstall issue. I think our only option may be to use a different antivirus. It looks like the other Norton torrents have ominous comments as well, so popular antiviruses worth trying instead are ESET, Kaspersky, and Avast."
,deathtoallorangatans,2010-08-31T16:57Z,"I just came back from a bit of research, and it seems ""Microsoft Security Essentials"" could be the best free antivirus:

,deathtoallorangatans,2010-08-31T17:03Z,"Sorry about all the comments, but there's no 'edit' function for comments. ""Microsoft Security Essentials"" requires validation of your copy of Windows, so if you can't do that, I can recommend AVG, which has a free version, which you can Google up."
,RottenTaint2010,2010-09-05T06:02Z,It ALWAYS prompts to UNINSTALL!!!!!
