Description:

Stan, Kenny, Kyle and Cartman pay a bum to buy them tickets to get into the movie Asses of Fire, an R-rated movie starring Canadians Terrance and Phillip. The movie turns out to be three hours of non-stop profanity, and so the boys come out with more language in their vocabulary than ever before. They utter many of the profanities in the film to their peers, causing most of the rest of the student body to eventually sneak in to watch the film and subsequently utter similar profanities. When their mothers find out, the enraged members of South Park's PTA, led by Kyle's mother, Sheila Broflovski, try to ban the film. Meanwhile, Wendy Testaburger, Stan's crush, starts hanging out with Gregory of Yardale, a new and better educated transfer student, to whom Stan takes an instant dislike. Stan asks Chef for advice to get Wendy to like him more than any other guy, and he absentmindedly recommends that Stan find the clitoris, although Stan doesn't understand what a clitoris is.

After watching the film again, Cartman and Kenny get into a fight over whether it is possible to light farts on fire like Terrance does in the movie. Kenny tries it and bursts into flames. A truck full of salt is dumped on him to put out the fire. He is immediately rushed to the hospital, where a George Clooney-esque doctor performs an inept surgery (involving an attempt to replace his heart). Kenny subsequently dies when the baked potato used instead of a replacement heart bursts out of his chest. The mothers angrily come in and ground Kyle, Stan, and Cartman (Kyle and Stan for two weeks, and Cartman for three weeks), as Kenny's spirit floats out of his body and he approaches the pearly gates, which in the movie is surrounded by many voluptuous, scantily-clad women; however, as Kenny pushes the entrance button, his access is denied and he falls into Hell.

Mrs. Broflovski leads the parents to form M.A.C. ("Mothers Against Canada") and capture Terrance and Phillip. When the United States refuses to release them at a United Nations meeting to discuss the situation and ridicule the Canadian Ambassador's accent, the Canadians respond by bombing the residence of the Baldwin brothers. The United States issues a televised declaration of war on Canada and orders the execution of "war criminals" Terrance and Phillip. M.A.C. expands its efforts and becomes a violently anti-Canadian group promoting the internment of those with Canadian descent, leading to Kyle being forced to hide his adopted brother Ike in the attic due to his Canadian heritage. When Mrs. Broflovski overhears Cartman singing "Kyle's Mom Is a Bitch", he is forced to have a "V-Chip" placed in his brain, though unlike its namesake, this V-Chip shocks him if he uses profanity.

Meanwhile, in Hell, Kenny discovers that Satan and Saddam Hussein are lovers, with Saddam acting as a dominating influence over Satan. When Satan discovers that a war has started on Earth, he says with delight that it has been prophesied that he can return to earth once Terrance and Phillip are killed and their blood touches American soil. Saddam makes no secret of the fact that he wants to rule the Earth, but Satan cannot stand up to him and is more interested in seeing Earth's beauty and splendor than conquering it. Kenny suggests that Satan leave Saddam, and, Satan agrees with Kenny's suggestion and tells Saddam he is going to Earth alone. However, Saddam apologizes and convinces Satan he can change, so Satan agrees to go to the surface together.

With Terrance and Phillip set to be executed and with the war on Canada, Kyle, Stan and Cartman ask themselves "What Would Brian Boitano Do?", and decide to form "La Resistance" (whose flag uses the classic anarchosyndicalist red-and-black) to save Terrance and Phillip. Gregory comes up with a daring plan to rescue Terrance and Phillip. Stan is convinced that Wendy will like him more than Gregory if he is more "political" and volunteers to go on the mission. Stan, Kyle and Cartman are sent to find a god-hating, cigarette-smoking French boy (a "mercenary for hire") named "The Mole". The Mole agrees to help them rescue Terrance and Phillip, who are to be executed by electric chair during a USO show.

The USO show begins, and the boys start executing the plan. Cartman, tasked with turning off the power shortly before the execution begins, is frightened when the ghost of Kenny warns him that Saddam and Satan are coming. Cartman runs away without turning off the power, causing the Mole to be spotted and killed by guard dogs. Kyle and Stan desperately run to the stage to prevent the execution, but Kyle cannot bring himself to stand up to his mom. Mrs. Broflovski orders the execution to begin.

Suddenly, a Canadian attack begins. Cartman rushes to turn off the electric chairs and receives an electric shock that causes the V-Chip to malfunction. The Americans and Canadians start battling each other. Thrown to the ground by a nearby bomb blast, Stan sees a vision of a giant clitoris which tells him to save Terrance and Phillip. He asks about Wendy, and the clitoris tells him to be confident because "chicks love confidence". Terrance and Phillip try to escape, but the American forces and Mrs. Broflovski corner them. Stan, Kyle and the rest of "La Resistance" confront them and Kyle finally decides to stand up to his mother and says he wants her to stop fighting all these battles and to just be his mom. She refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip in the head.

When their blood touches the ground it cracks open. Satan, Saddam, and a host of demons come up from Hell and begin wreaking havoc, forcing Mrs. Broflovski to realize what her actions had done. Satan is quickly pushed aside by Saddam, who makes everyone bow down to him while Satan watches. Kenny insists that Satan should stand up to Saddam. Cartman discovers that the jolt to the V-Chip gave him the power to shoot electricity when he swears. Cartman launches into a series of vulgar rants, using the electricity to attack Saddam. Saddam calls for Satan to help, insulting him in the process, but Satan has finally had enough and kills Saddam by hurling him back into Hell.

Satan thanks Kenny for his help and grants him one wish. Kenny wishes for everything to return to how it was before the war, even though this means he will go back to Hell. Satan grants his wish and everything returns to normal. Before returning to Hell, Kenny pulls back his hood (revealing his face for the first time in South Park history) to give a proper goodbye to his friends. Mrs. Broflovski apologizes to Kyle for not believing him and kisses him. Wendy kisses Stan and says she never liked Gregory. Everyone sings a song about their happy ending and, in the final scene, Kenny is shown becoming an angel and flying into Heaven. After the credits Kyle's brother Ike is seen eating a rat in the attic.


Enjoy!!!!!!
