These are all songs that Ms. Vera Lynn included in her repertoire
or made famous as the great hits they are forever more!

A kiss to build a dream on wvocals
A kiss to build a dream on
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square
As time goes by
Besame mucho female english vocals
Born free
The Gathering of the clans (excl lyrics)
Harbour lights
Land of hope and glory
Lili Marlene
Now Is The Hour - Vera Lynn
Roll out the barrel
The anniversary waltz  
The old rugged cross
We'll Meet Again (With Choir)
We'll Meet Again (Without Choir)
We'll meet again
When Johnny comes marching home
When The Lights Go On Again
Where have all the flowers gone wvocals
Where have all the flowers gone
White cliffs of Dover
Wish Me Luck As You Wave Me Goodbye
