Rotten Tomatoes states: 'Creation 2010 - Consensus: This Charles Darwin biopic is curiously dispassionate, but Creation contains some of director Jon Amiel's best work, and Paul Bettany's performance is not to be missed.'

The book of eli on the other hand is, according to IMDB, about: 'A post-apocalyptic tale, in which a lone man fights his way across America in order to protect a sacred book that holds the secrets to saving humankind.' - That book, of course, being the Bible.

You, sir, are disingenuous and have an agenda."
,u2r1u4s3,2010-01-30T05:41Z,"This is very touching Movie.
It is a true story and both as a movie and as a story telling this is a great movie.

Some people ( religious fundamentalists) like zmacdaddy8 will have hard time digesting it even though it is a true story.

A must see. "
,matadata,2010-05-21T10:33Z,"nice one guys =)

and btw,  "
,SurferRN,2011-01-15T07:47Z,"I prefer biblical fundamentalist, please.  godswallops is brilliant!  God bless this genius.   As for the movie, prove it.  Macroevolution, prove it.  It takes more work to disprove God than to humble thyself.   Religion?!  NO!  That's for atheist goobers, as atheism is an evangelical religion.  Where's the love?  SNAP!"
