Nightmare Noises

When a mother comes to them for help, TAPS takes on a local case at the Tedeschi's House where strange voices are heard and toys come on by themselves. Then it's on to the MacLean's House to investigate strange noises and shaking that are coming from under the house. Jason and Grant head up to the attic where a whole new investigation begins.
