Joker's Asylum was a special month-long, weekly series of one-shots that ran through September 2008 starring the greatest villains in Batman's rogues gallery.

Each issue tells a special stand-alone story that gives readers an inside look into the insane lives of the Dark Knight's greatest adversaries.  And all the stories are narrated by the Asylum's leading homicidal maniac - The Joker!
