Update part to bibliography of Stephen King

This is the update part to bibliography of Stephen King, the new part contains about 20 stories, some of them have never been published, several poems, which is very interesting and several novels and non-fiction books. I found complete Colorado Kid and Blaze, but also new book from november 2009 Under The Dome. On writing is also there. One more thing: Buy your favourite books from King, cause it is much prettier when you feel paper underneath your hands.
