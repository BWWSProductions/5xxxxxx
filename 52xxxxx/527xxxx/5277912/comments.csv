Just to add a little info for future downloaders, the reason it's of a reduced resolution of 352x240. However, besides the resolution, I find the quality (and audio quality, for that matter) absolutely perfect! Also, if playing on a device with a smaller screen like a cell phone or iPod, not even the reduced resolution matters - it looks just as good as it would of had it been  uploaded in it's full resolution.

Thanks again!"
,themaritimeman,2011-01-09T02:25Z,Correction to my last comment: the reason *it's lower quality is because* it's of a reduced resolution .
