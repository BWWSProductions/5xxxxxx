One of the most under-rated bands of all time. Self produced and Self Managed, this band deserves every bit of support out there. 

Please go to Amazon and buy their CDs just to show support. 

Here are 192kbps AAC Audio for you to jam to. If you like this group, the CDs themselves are worth having on the shelf. 

Extracted with E-CDDA-Extractor Professional 12.0.04 from original CDs. 


Note: If you know anyone who can give these songs some Airplay, i.e. Radio, etc. Then go for it. This band is suffering and it's quite unbelievable specially considering how much substance there is to each and every song. I encourage you guys to listen, and buy the CDs. Believe me, they are worth it, too many good bands never make it because of Record Labels and lack of Radio play.
