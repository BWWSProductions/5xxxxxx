i Will upload a video to tpb & on myaccount on how to install this.

Use a emulator such as Magic disk, which is free(google it)
Install DVD 1,
Install DVD 2,
Copy all content from the Razor 1911 folder(your crack is what it is)
& paste it to

C:Program Files (x86)Rockstar GamesGrand Theft Auto IV

When asked to replace, say yes and paste and replace any files it prompts.

You will need to set up a free profile with Windows Live. I have not yet tested a crack I have for saving the games, as I have not had time, so atm, no crack for saving the games, not in this upload anyway.

Seed & enjoy.

For your gaming Pleasure & convenience, I included a few known cheats below.
