dude, don't you have a life? stop ranting on all my uploads & get an education. Just cause your too hostile to accept the help I offered you does not make it a Trojan. Besides, you look like man ass. 13.86GB Trojan? WOW i am good, that's ONE BIG TITTY of a Trojan. lmao, Now ""this torrent contains a Trojan"" would be one thing, but this is a trojan? lmao, guess you never got your hug?  TPB admins would remove my ""trusted"" status if I was uploading viruses. I would give you a hug, but then, Im do not really like you, so I do not care:P"
,fierguy,2010-04-23T01:44Z,"There are two things that i need clarified.
1) What is the serial?
2) I dont see a crack in the containing folder, where is it?
If you could help me with those two things, that would be great.
Much apprecialted"
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-04-30T05:18Z,"@fierguy

Inside the ISO, look for 1911 i think is the name

2. create an offline Windows Live account, but sadly I did not have a game save crack.

contact me @ GhostWarriorTheGeek on you||tube, I have video tutorials"
