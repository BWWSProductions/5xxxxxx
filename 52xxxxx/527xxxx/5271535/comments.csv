Help!  We're stuck at 99.8%.  Please finish seeding. Nice sound on this vinyl.

[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-14T17:49Z,"sorry about that, had it paused for some reason. it's seeding now. :D"
,BeatleTom,2010-01-15T16:39Z,"Hi HMV,

Sorry, but we're still stuck at 99.8%. I can see you there but nothing is happening.  Elton John downloaded just fine.  Go figure.  Thanks for your help.

[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-15T22:33Z,"yeah i don't know what the problem is, i see you guys, but none of you are getting any speed, even if i single out just that torrent..."
,BeatleTom,2010-01-16T18:33Z,"Hi HMV, The only incomplete file is ""The Winner Takes All.""  Maybe you can reup just that one.  Thanks, Beatle Tom"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-16T19:46Z,"ok so ithink the problem might have been the .torrent file. i saved in in the folder and because of the spelling, it put itself in between the tracks, so i removed it completely, maybe that'll help. if not i will upload just track 2 :D"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-16T20:37Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5284884 there you go :D too bad, i don't know what went wrong"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-16T20:39Z,"after you dl the file, remove the HMV from the title, and put it in the abba folder, that should fix it so you can seed :D"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-16T23:56Z,"ok looks to be working! it was to torrent file, i noticed the same problem with brian adams (brain goes before b1) it messes with utorrent. problem is fixed, enjoy :D"
,BeatleTom,2010-01-18T22:06Z,"Thank you - plays fine now.

Anyone can re-seed?"
,telecandy,2011-08-25T20:19Z,"Thanks. But the audio quality is really really poor, flat, distorted and full of noise. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, unless you have fond memories of dusty records being played on old stereos. That's what it sounds like anyway."
