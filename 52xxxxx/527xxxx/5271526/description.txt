The Reverend Doctor Christopher Syn is the smuggler hero of a series of novels by Russell Thorndike. 
The first book, Doctor Syn: A Tale of the Romney Marsh was published in 1915. 
The story idea came from smuggling in the 18th century Romney Marsh, where brandy and tobacco were brought in at night by boat from France to avoid high tax. 

Minor battles were fought, sometimes at night, between gangs of smugglers, such as the Hawkhurst Gang and the Revenue, supported by the army and local militias in the South, Kent and the West, Sussex.
