So put away your Avatar, Saw VI, or Chuck glasses, all the title is referring to is that this is not an animation episode, it is a ""Making Of"" ""Documentary"" so you get to see 3Dimensional people (in 2D) talking about the first 20 years of The Simpsons. Also there is nothing On Ice either, so I don't know what that is supposed to refer to at all. The nearest I can figure is either the narrator is On Ice, or they recommend the viewer be On Ice to make this watchable. Actually, being On Ice and wearing 3-D glasses may actually make this documentary more interesting..."
