Sunday, 10 January 2010

audio files are divided on half-hour breaks

The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.


Topics for this show:  the impending rollout of the "naked body scanners," mindreading machines for checkpoints, Timothy Geithner's AIG-related legal problems, the health insurance reform bill, etc.


Alex takes a number of calls, particularly soliciting first-time callers.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
