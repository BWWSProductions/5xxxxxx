Goodness Gracious Me is a BBC English language sketch comedy show originally on BBC Radio 4. 


Many of the sketches explored the conflict and integration between traditional Indian culture and modern British life. 
Some reversed the roles to view the British from an Indian perspective while others poked fun at Indian stereotypes.

One of the more famous sketches featured the cast "going out for an English" after a few lhassis. They mispronounce the waiter's name, order the blandest thing from the menu (apart from one of them, who opts for the safer option of a curry)and ask for 24 plates of chips. This parodies the often-drunk English people "going out for an Indian", ordering chicken phall and too many papadums. 

This sketch was recently voted the 6th Greatest Comedy Sketch.

The cast casually drop Punjabi and Hindi/Urdu slang phrases into their speech, in the manner of many British Asians living in the UK.
