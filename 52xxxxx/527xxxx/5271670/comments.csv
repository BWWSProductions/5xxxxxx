[T],frankie-boy,2010-02-06T19:37Z,"Thank you BoyoBoss, for your comments and encouragement. I too feel that the best film noirs, especially of the late forties and early fifties, offer a richness and power that most modern films don't match.

Also thanks to the seeders!"
,ex_pat3,2010-02-08T14:01Z,"I never even knew there were so many film noirs made. Even a search on IMDB didn't turn up a fraction of these. 

Great stuff - thank you so much. I will seed as much as I can."
[T],frankie-boy,2010-02-11T21:48Z,"ex_pat3, that is why I tagged all of my noir uploads with ""film noir"", so people could find them.

Unfortunately, I can't enforce that tagging on others who upload noirs, so I try to reference and link those uploads in my comments.

Thanks for your comments, ex_pat3, and for supporting this by offering to seed AMAP. I really appreciate it!"
