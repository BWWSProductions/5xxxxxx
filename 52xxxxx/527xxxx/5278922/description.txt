In an imaginative comedy about an innocent young man who ends up the owner of a new atomic bomb, this generally silent and effective film by Ion Popesco Gopo lobs it to everyone. Set in an obviously advanced but anonymous country, the young, unemployed man (Darie Lurie) gets the atomic bomb after it is stolen by a group of gangsters. He is not quite sure what to do with it and after meeting and romancing an attractive women, and being chased by the government and the gangsters both, he decides to hand out a bit of the bomb to any citizen who wants it. With these pieces of wondrous radioactivity, people are able to dart around without the need for wheeled conveyances or they can grow crops in quite a miraculous manner. This drollery owes its effectiveness, in large part, to director Gopo's acclaimed successes with animated short films. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guide
