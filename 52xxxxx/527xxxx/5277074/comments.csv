,master__,2010-01-24T17:30Z,If people could learn that RAR files are mutch better than one big file this tracker would be awsome. Everyone would know that the files are the exakt the same as it was for the one who ripped the release. To bad moste people here are to dumb to relize that. have a good life

-------------------------------------------

BINGO!  I NEVER seed RAR'd files once they are finished.  I ALWAYS seed AVI files to at least 1.5x...  Simple math.

Plus I keep my Windows drive at bare minimum, so I usually don't have 4Gb free to extract a file into Temp anyways.

DOWN WITH RAR!!!
(at least for video purposes, RAR is awesome for everything else!)"
