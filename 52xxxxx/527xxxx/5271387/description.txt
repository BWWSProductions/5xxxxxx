Who Fighter with Heart of Darkness is the first presentation of Seiho Takizawa's work in English.  The three bizarre stories in this volume explore the tolls of combat on the human mind and the dark forces that are unleashed by mankindâ€™s recurring spirals into warfare.

The first story in this anthology, "Who Fighter," is a play on the legendary "Foo Fighters," the nickname given to the mysterious, UFO-like fireballs that were sighted by World War II pilots. An ace Japanese pilot manages to shoot one of the fireballs down . . . or does he? As ominous signs and visions begin to follow in his steps, the bewildered pilot wonders if he's lost not only his memory of the incident, but also his very mind! 
The second story, "Heart of Darkness," is Takizawa's unique take on the Joseph Conrad novel that inspired the film Apocalypse Now. A Japanese war hero, Colonel Kurutsu, has gone rogue, setting up his own private kingdom deep upriver in the jungles of Burma. A young captain, sent to execute Kurutsu, finds that the true reasons for the Colonel's "desertion" are very different from what he was told. 
Finally, a short piece, "Tanks," closes out the collection with a surreal voyage through one hundred years of armored vehicle battles!
