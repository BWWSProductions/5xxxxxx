,italianmafia23,2010-01-20T00:54Z,Activation Code isn't working. Tried regenerating it three times as well...
,dimi13beast,2010-01-23T16:30Z,"Make sure you copy the WHOLE activation code
it doesnt fit in the box and overlaps"
,deskrad,2010-01-26T19:23Z,im stuck on the activation code as well. i have tried many times and even hand written it to get it down but no luck
,dimi13beast,2010-01-31T18:05Z,"I reinstalled and tested on 2 pcs. It works!!!!
again, the instructions
1)Install 
2)Patch C:/Program Files/Sony/ACID Pro 7.0c
3)Run acid pro 7 from program files
4) generate/copy Serial (TOP BOX)DON""T GENERATE AGAIN
5)Select Offline Athorization
6)FIll out the crap and save it somewhere
7)Copy Paste the Activation Code
8)It runs over one box, be sure to copy/paste eniter thing, as you can't see half of the code"
,snooork,2010-02-02T00:25Z,"Not working here either, I am on Vista 64bit. Would that have anything to say?"
,snooork,2010-02-02T02:33Z,"Ok! Got it working. Try and run the keygen as administrator. Now... It will patch and still come up with an error message. After that, proceed as directed. Again, I can't distress how important it is to look at the number of sections in the keygen, if there's not... is it 6? Then you haven't got all of the activation code in there. Good luck."
,c0pyr1ght,2010-02-04T07:11Z,"I am running windows 7 32bit, and it wouldn't accept the auth code either, and i had the entire code. I ran the keygen as administrator, and that was the send try and it accepted the patch, then the serial number was good, and it kicks out the auth code. I am totally nuking it and retorrenting it again, and starting fresh. Will windows 7 have anything to do with it?"
,c0pyr1ght,2010-02-04T07:58Z,"UPDATE: I got it... I know what all of you are doing... After you run the .exe to install it, DON'T OPEN ACID AS BADLY AS YOU WANT, LEAVE IT CLOSED! I used BitZipper to extract the KeyGen, then you right-click>run as admin ( I have win7, again) select Acid Pro 7, hit patch, select program files>sony>acid pro 7 folder and OK. Once the patch is complete, THEN open Acid from your shortcut icon, paste the serial number, blah blah blah, then it's best to right-click and select all for the auth code.. Paste, ok... WIN!! ^^"
,Fridgulous,2010-03-05T05:40Z,"Installed, patched (failed, but continued as snooork said), generated, and so on. Worked up until the activation key failed. I'm using windows7 32bit

GAH!
Help?!"
,Fridgulous,2010-03-06T02:20Z,"NVM i got it (windows 7):
Run the setup
DONT OPEN when finished.
**Right click the keygen and run as admin
patch accordingly

,Flake968,2010-03-09T06:18Z,"Works 100%
Patched it right after installing, and blocked internet access."

I know I know, I'm really new at this and don't know what the hell i'm doing, but everyone has to start somewhere.  Anytime I try to patch it, it starts to patch then says there was an error. consequently everything else won't work. Help??"

,jaywhoo,2010-05-16T00:49Z,"thanks, works for me
@mookemaddox, i used the generator"
,DjLuxor,2010-06-08T03:41Z,"First of all...to choppergirl and anyone else who is too stupid to use a hacked software version...stop posting your stupid virus reports. If you have not...or can not...figure out that keygens show up as trojens...than this is way over your head and you need to stick to buying software so the rest of us can enjoy it for free. 

To dimi13beast - great upload...thanks for the great job!"
,pppatwalsh,2010-06-19T04:00Z,I got everything up to the activation code. I'm running windows XP. What's the deal?

,imjoaquinu,2011-04-07T00:10Z,"HAVING TROUBLE:

I had trouble a few times and figured out the schoolboy errors I was doing.
Be sure to read the instructions (right here, in the download description above the comments) - VERY CAREFULLY.

1. You install ACID. Don't run it.
2. Open the keygen. To be safe, right-click and choose ""run as administrator"".
3. The first field in the keygen, make sure it's ""ACID Pro 7"" selected. NOT any similar name.
4. In the keygen, the button at the bottom-left says ""patch"" - hit it and show the thing where you chose to install ACID.
5. Now, without closing the keygen, try and run ACID. 
6. When it prompts you for the serial, get it off the keygen. If the serial isn't beginning with ""1k0"" then go back. You fucked up a step.
7. Select, ""register from another computer"" after you've entered the serial in for approval.
8. Fill in the damn form with garbage info and it will make you save it in a file you will delete later.
8. Enter the verification code from the keygen - NOT the serial. It should be the code on the bottom.
9. That's it. You are free to close the keygen and if you still have problems.... I dunno. Try getting a nerd at your house to find out. Maybe you're an idiot or your computer is possessed with a voodoo demon."
,AnnONM,2011-06-11T01:05Z,"hey mate this looks great but when i get up to the type in the authentication code it comes up saying that the code has been enterd in wrong i have followed instructions down to the T and its not working any help much appreciated.
Cheers "
,blksxmn,2011-06-11T17:57Z,"okay, HERE IS WHAT I FOUND!! I RUN WIN 7.  AFTER INSTALLING THE PROGRAM -- DONT OPEN IT AT ALL.   OPEN KEYGEN BY RIGHT CLICK AND RUN AS ADMIN. 
THEN SELECT ACID PRO 7 SERIES AND THEN CLICK GENERATE.

HERE IS THE KEY TO IT ALL.
ONCE YOU GENERATE, CLICK PATCH AND SELECT PROGRAM FILES THEN SONY THEN ACID PRO 7 FOLDER THEN OK/SAVE

THEN ALSO CLICK PATCH AGAIN
SELECT PROGRAM FLIES (X86) THEN SONY THEN ACID PRO 7 FOLDER THEN OK/SAVE BUTTON.

DOING THIS WILL ENSURE YOU HAVE DONE IT DOUBLY CORRECT.

THEN GO TO THE PROGRAMS (ONLY FOLDER AND THEN SONY THEN acidpro70 AND CLICK IT TO OPEN IT.

IF YOU DONT SEE IT IN THAT FOLDER GO TO THE PROGRAM FILES (X86) FOLDER AND OPEN IT FROM THERE.

THEN GO THE KEY THEN THAT IS STILL OPEN ON COPY THE SERIAL ( not the authorization code) and paste it in.

THEN FILE OUT THE REGISTRATION WITH ANYTHING/ SAVE THE FILE TO DESKTOP/ delete it after you have open acid/ CLICK OKAY/save

WHEN YOU GET TO AUTHORIZATION CODE ENTRY GO TO THE KEYGEN AND COPY IT ( AT THE BOTTOM) IT IS LONG SO MAKE SURE YOU DRAG FROM LEFT TO RIGHT TO GET IT ALL.
PASTE INTO THE ACID SETUP FIELD AND CLICK OK.

THIS SHOULD DO IT.

I TRIED HUNDREDS OF TIMES AND COULD NOT GET IT WORKING UNTIL I SAW THERE WERE 2 PROGRAM FOLDERS AND I WAS ONLY PATCHING ONE. SO I PATCHED BOTH THE VERY LAST TIME AND I WAS SUCCESSFUL."
,PaceyPimps,2011-07-01T21:51Z,Does this Keygen work in trial v7.0e if not pls upload new version thx

,nickcool9999,2011-09-22T02:55Z,"Avg - Virus after open the keygen.

It's a false positive. trust me, if you press allow nothing bad will happen and it will work.

Having problems? *Read step ""4""* (most important) of imjoaquinu's tutorial.
Make sure you've patched both the program file and the setup program file, both in the same folder. :p"
,LserEvil,2011-09-26T16:41Z,If the patch isnt working its because you have windows 7 and you need to (right click) on keygen (run as administrator.)

,metallic.art,2012-05-03T18:04Z,"(Win 7 Ultimate, AMD on ASRock, onboard 5.1 HD sound (yeah, i know... -.-... i'm broke, okay?^^) and so on....)
Hey,
I'm afraid it's just me, but just in case there are people having the same problem:
Does anybody know what to do?:
It all worked perfectly fine, wonderful seeds and good instructions. But when i start the program, it shows the splashscreen and then crashes without error message, during or after ""Initializing Direct X Plug-ins..."".
Can anyone tell me what normally comes after loading the DX plugins? So i can maybe see what's wrong? (My DX is fine - i don't need DX 11, do i? I'm running 10...)
Or did anyone have the same problem but fixed it?

I've tried different versions of Acid Pro, all with the same result. Even with my old system (Asus P5N T-Deluxe and intel core 2 duo) i had the same problem.
I kept my patched and bolted version of Win 7 though. I just don't want to reinstall windows - or a different OS >.<

So yeah, any tips would be great.
Thanks for the UL!!
Greetings from Germany"
,metallic.art,2012-05-03T18:09Z,"@ timmyp1978:

What file seems to be missing?
If it's about the files to be patched, just put it in the installed folder (""%systemdrive%program filessonyacid pro 7.0"" for Win x86 systems), and when you run the keygen from there, select ""Acid Pro 7.0 series"", and when it asks for the location, it should already be there, just confirm."
