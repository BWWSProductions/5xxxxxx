,Bombardem,2010-01-13T08:26Z,"I just finished watching it, and it was fairly good. Maybe a bit boring, and the end isnt exactly a surprise. But I'd recommend it to anyone who feels the slightest interest. I think the screenwriters missed the mark, she obviously had a fascinating life, and there was a lot of intrigue going on out of the public eye. The film could have been far more interesting than it was."
,grayscales,2010-01-13T15:53Z,"Hi twentyforty.

Thank you very much for the upload.  My 89 year old dad (a contemporary of Amelia !) dislikes most modern movies, but he asked me if I could get this one for him which is why I originally requested it of you.  Once I've got it, I'll watch it with him.

Thanks again."
,lilars26,2010-01-13T18:08Z,Thank you 20/40.My 84 year old mother wanted to see this too.But I Like historical movies as well.
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-13T19:23Z,"@grayscales: First, sorry for such big delay. I have promised you back then ""When decent copy comes out"". In wildest dreams I haven't expected three months. And when this screener has appeared, I immediately downloaded file and upped my re-encoding over few other requests I have...
Hope you and your grandpa will enjoy it.

@all: Thanks. This torrent is slow. Please, whoever can should crank your upload speed up and stay as seeder as long as you can. "
,lilars26,2010-01-13T20:43Z,I am using utorrent and have upload and download set at unlimited.My upload speed is usually under 10kb/s.Is there some setting in preferences that I should use to speed it up?
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-13T21:51Z,"@lilars: Your limits are known to you, you know what connection ""type"" you payed for. If you know that your upload speed is indeed 10 kB/s, you probably have payed for 320/120 ""Type"" or ""Class"" to your InternetServiceProvider. You can look in contract you've signed and there are all ""numbers"" and small-letters you need.
Usually 528 is paired with 256 upload, 1024 with 328 and so forth... If you have 320 download speed you probably have lowest category of some DSL connection. Keep in mind that you DIVIDE speeds as 320, 520 or 124 with approx. 10 (they use kbps and we use kB/s - kilobits against kilobytes as units I guess 'cause 320 SOUNDS better than smallish 32, right?). Then lower the numbers for speeds from the contract by some 15% and you'll get your theoretical maximum. You should ask your provider how much will cost a migration to higher category, because Moving is cheaper than starting from scratch. I ""moved"" twice and once was for symbolic price (Xmas discounts) and year after for approx 20% of price in class above. But, FlatRate (fixed price, traffic no limits) was best move I've done two years after that. Such FlatRate costs ""just"" 35% more than ""payed by the traffic"" package I had before. I bought great deal of peace within my family (back then) and within myself...

Hope I've said - something."
,lilars26,2010-01-13T22:06Z,Thank you.Iwill check into that.
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-13T23:18Z,"@lilars: Well, if you have been asking ""is there some silver bullet"" answer is: Nope. There is no magical setting. All ""Connection optimizers"" are either selling something non-existent or selling a fog.
In the past, one could ""optimize"" dial-up connections and gain incredible 1.5 kBs. ""My modem fly at 4.2 kB/s,and before was 3.2 kB/s at max"".
Such times are behind us. Modern, digital connections are limited only by - how much one payed for. Ups and downs of modern world.

However, one can ""optimize"" his/heir behavior: be calm, patient, emphatic and adaptive - all things most people do not have. Anyone has his own recipes ""How to download using torrents"" - and anyone, like in life, thinks that he has best ""moves"". But, at the end, anyone will/would/should practice a method which suits him best, his character, stuff anyone is made of."
,lilars26,2010-01-14T00:44Z,"I have 60gig a month package which includes uploads and downloads.My download speed is ""up to""14 mb/s.Still trying to find upload speed But like I said it's usually under 10 kb/s but I have seen it go as high as 30 for short periods.the reason I was asking was because you requested us to turn it up if we could.Anyway I will keep it at unlimited and seed at 1=1.                                                And we should all keep good wishes for the people of Haiti.     Peace Bro"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-14T09:12Z,"@lilars: It seems like you have ""package"" of 1.24 MB/s download and usually 32 kB/s upload, but it depends on ""strategy"" of your provider. 
But - read what I wrote as answer to htctouch concerning how he should act. In short: during the download one's upload speed should be set on 80-90% on public torrents. On private-tracker torrents upload speed MUST be set on ""unlimited"" because they use ""anti-cheat/leech"" scripts and ""read"" anyone's settings - same as I do. Further, new torrent programs are ""smarter"" then before, and do not give to someone if that someone doesn't give back, they treats such ""comrades"" as hostiles, and some people wonder why they haven't received bytes from others. Well, as I said, ""being adaptive""..."
,lilars26,2010-01-14T14:09Z,"O.K. thanks 20/40,will do."
