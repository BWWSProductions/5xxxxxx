,HamHam,2010-01-31T10:56Z,"Hi,

To Changed The Sku Region For:

*Windows Vista/7 (32-Bit)* -> Start/Regedit/HKEY_LOCALMACHINE/SOFTWARE/SIMS/THESIMS3

*Windows Vista/7 (64-Bit)* -> Start/Regedit/HKEY_LOCALMACHINE/SOFTWARE/WOW6432Node/SIMS/THESIMS3

Thank You."
,icehawk57,2010-01-31T11:12Z,"Sorry about so many but im not really a technical guy. I got everything set but when i launch game it says insert sims disk or something like that. I inserted the discs i made and i tried the no dvd ts3 thing. Any help would be much appreciated,"
,HamHam,2010-01-31T11:46Z,"Hi,

Just Follow The Instructions. Their Are Two No DVD TS3 Crack In This Torrent:
-> (1)NoDVD  v1.8.25 (For The Sims)
-> (2)NoDVD v2.3.33 (For WA)

So, Make Sure Your Version Is Correct For The Crack And Don't Forget To Replace The TS3 From The Sims 3 Directory.

Thank You."
,icehawk57,2010-01-31T12:11Z,I am i replaced the 10.7 mb tse that was already there with the 11.1 mb found in your torrent. It still says i need to insert sims disc. I followed the directions exactly. I am pretty sure that the problem is me and not your torrent but any help would be good.
,jankro,2010-02-01T15:19Z,"Installed it to the letter per instructions and it functioned perfectly. However, the next day after started the computer again, it would not start World Adventures and asked for the original disc. I removed it and re-installed and it was ok until next computer restart when it wanted the original disc again?? Any help?"
,HamHam,2010-02-01T23:16Z,"Hi,

First, Make Sure You Unmount All Drive And Then Use The Correct NoDvd Crack For The Game.

If You Still Got The Problems. Try To Google It And I Hope You Found The Solution For The Problem And I Never Encounter This Error Before.

Thank You."
,tjartiek,2010-02-02T12:18Z,"HI

Thank You."
,minseo,2010-02-03T13:00Z,"i'm using windows xp, how do i change the sku region with this?"
,HamHam,2010-02-04T12:13Z,"Hi,

Sorry For The Late Reply. I Think It The Same. Just Go To -> Start/Regedit/HKEY_LOCALMACHINE/SOFTWARE/SIMS/THESIMS3

Please Search The Web If You Have Any Problems, Ok...?

Thank You."
,Gornax,2010-02-08T01:38Z,"If ur having trouble with the censor, or the game doesnt start up after uve put the resource and mods into bin folder, then u shudd do this:

Open resource wich u downloaded from this torrent, copy the text after uve opened in notepad, go to original resource.cfg, open it and paste.

If u still cant play, mount disk1 and copy paste the original resource there to game bin folder."
,amandae,2010-02-09T18:10Z,So is anyone else having the problem where the torrent stops downloading because of an error?  It says that it can't download when a user has open component parts of the download.
,amandae,2010-02-09T18:11Z,"*edit* ""user-mapped section opened"" is exactly what the error says."
,shazzam87,2010-02-17T21:20Z,"please seed, been stuck on 34% for ages now lol. Thanks for the upload HamHam "

,shazzam87,2010-02-19T13:47Z,Just out of curiosity has anyone tested this on a mac yet? would be good to know if it works. Thanks 
,creampuffy1,2010-02-20T01:59Z,This is going to sound stupid.. but what is a SKU region and how would I go about changeing it?
,mvp1259,2010-02-20T02:04Z,"@ amandae

I'm having the same error message you are.  I'm not even downloading the game files, just the patches, as I have the games already.  I've been downloading all day and only have 20% finished because I have to keep forcing the download to continue.  If anyone has any advice on what could be causing this, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks for the upload.  Been searching for something of the sort for a while."
,mvp1259,2010-02-20T02:06Z,"Quoting HamHam: 

Hi,

Sorry For The Late Reply. I Think It The Same. Just Go To -> Start/Regedit/HKEY_LOCALMACHINE/SOFTWARE/SIMS/THESIMS3

Thank You.



That is how you change the sku number.  I've heard 2 tends to work."
,mvp1259,2010-02-20T20:49Z,"We have Windows 7 64 bit and had a bit of an issue trying to find where the sku is located.  For anyone with Windows 7 having the same issue, it took a bit of searching but try this:

Under start, do a search for Regedit and select the application.  The SKU is found under:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE>SOFTWARE>WOW6432NODE>SIMS>SIMS3

Double click SKU and change it from 7 to 2.  Hope this helps ^_^  

Also, word of warning, picked up a virus or a trojan on one of the patches.  Just removed it."
,mvp1259,2010-02-20T22:54Z,"Last comment, I promise lol

Finally got everything patched and seems to be working great.  Only other problems I came across:

the 1.3 patch wasn't compatible with my computer, probably cause of the 64-bit, just found the 1.3 patch on pb through a search which worked out fine.  

@ jankro,

I also had that problem where it said the disc was not found.  Creating a shortcut from the cracked exe file and not from the launcher solved the problem.  Just bypassed the part where it checked for the cd and went straight to the game.  Hope this helps. 

Thanks again for the upload!"
,shazzam87,2010-02-21T22:25Z,"Hey HamHam, do you buy any chance have a guide for installing it on a mac or is there anyone else that could help me. Would be a great help. Thanks "
,shazzam87,2010-02-21T23:50Z,"can anyone help me find 
game bin code_version.txt "
,iamneo33,2010-03-15T05:04Z,"Big thanks to HamHam for the torrent to such a great game.  However I got a big headach from the enclosed instructions.  I have endeavoured to simply the steps... 

Hope HamHam does not hold this against me... ;)

If anyone has any issues, I will be glad to help

Sims 3 - Complete install guide

(1) Open the ""1.The Sims? 3 Reloaded"" folder

    You can either burn the iso files to discs to complete install 

    Or mount the discs using software such as Power ISO

    a) Mount the iso(or disc) ""TS3 CD 1.iso"", if the autoinstall does not start run ""Autorun.exe"" from the iso
       or disc

    b) when prompted for a serial, run serial.exe from the crack directory and press generate and copy and paste
       the key if necessary

    c) when prompted for the next disc, mount ""TS3 CD 2.iso"" and click to continue

    d) When prompted to download the ""EA Manager"", uncheck it and click next

(2) Open the ""2.The Sims? 3 Patching Guides"" Folder

    a) before patching can be completed the registry must be edited

         - run regedit

         - go to either of these keys according to your windows version 32 bit(x86) or 64 bit(x64)

           x86 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Sims\The Sims 3

           x64 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Sims\The Sims 3

           look for the ""SKU"" and change the value to 2

         - close regedit

    b) Run the patch from Folder ""1.Reload To Retail Version"", make sure it has selected the right directory,
       I had to manually select the right directory.  Directory paths are as follows...

       x86 c:\program files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3

       x64 c:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3

    c) Copy all of the items from folder ""2.Patch Fix v1.2.7"" into the following folder, replacing all

       x86 c:\program files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\bin

       x64 c:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\bin

    d) Open folder ""3.Patches"" and run the patches in order, the only reason the first patch will error, is
       because the patch from step b was not installed to the right directory or the files from step c were not
       copied to the correct directory

          - run Sims3_1.2.7.00002_from_1.0.631.00002.exe

          - run sims3_1.3.24.00002_from_1.2.7.00002.exe

          - run Sims3_1.4.6.00002_from_1.3.24.00002.exe

          - run Sims3_1.6.6.002002_from_1.4.6.00002.exe

          - run Sims3_1.7.9.002002_from_1.6.6.002002.exe

          - run Sims3_1.8.25.003002_from_1.7.9.002002.exe

    e) copy file ""TS3.exe"" from the ""4.NoDVD  v1.8.25"" folder into the following folder replacing the file

       x86 c:\program files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\bin

       x64 c:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\bin

Sims 3 is now playable at this point, if you don't want the World adventures or censor removal files, if not
continue to add the extras

    f) From the folder ""05 Censor Removal"" copy Resource.cfg into the following folder, replacing the file

       x86 c:\program files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\bin

       x64 c:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\bin

    g) copy ""Uncensored Patch.package"" from ""05 Censor Removal"" to the following folder, if it does not 
       exist then create the folder

       x86 c:\program files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\bin\Mods\Packages

       x64 c:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\bin\Mods\Packages

    Patching is now complete...

(3) Open the ""3.The Sims? 3 World Adventures Reloaded"" folder

    a) Mount the image ""TS3 WA.iso"" and run autorun.exe if it does not autostart

    b) Use 5BVD-BSVB-9X7X-Y9XB-2RLD as the registartion code

    c) At the end of the install it will prompt to install the EA Manager, uncheck it and do not install it

    d) unmount the ""TS3 WA.iso"" iso(or disc)

    e) run Sims3_2.2.8.002002_from_2.0.86.002"
