TrickDinkus is back with a brand new attack!

How bout it Dinkus - Is it okay to be a RACIST if you are a SOCIALIST?

And how many of these dried-up old prunes did you apologize for while you were gone?

We really missed you.

Yo Trix - You are such a Troll!

ENDuuuUH!

,tavery80,2010-01-14T11:07Z,"Thnx for the upload.  Much appreciated!

I'm desparately seeking the older Rush 24/7 Media Center app.  My HD is kaput, and Premiere wants me to use iTunes, which I hate.

If anyone has the original Media Center, please upload as torrent.  Or post a link.  Thanks!"
,TedKennedy,2010-01-14T16:58Z,"Trick good sir,
i have not yet listened to this program (i am about to as i do everyday at work) but i assume he talks a bit about the Haiti earthquake. I would say that the liberal party is the master at using death, suffering, and tragedy to politically discredit their enemies look at Katrina, the liberals jumped to blame bush for the natural disaster. looked at how they tried to use the death of Ted Kennedy (hardly a tragedy, but that is another story lol) to pass a health care bill. they will do anything immoral or down right inhuman to get their agenda passed because as far as they are concerned the ends (socialism) justify any means. Rush is no doubt brilliantly satirizing the fact that liberals, had a conservative been in power, would find a way to blame them. Further can i ask why the hell you listen to rush if you don't like him? does george soros pay you to? Your life must be pretty depressing if you sit around all day listening to people you don't like, just so you can post on here to the 75 people who download this torrent about how you disagree with him."
,TedKennedy,2010-01-14T17:17Z,"also i don't know if you know this but the US is the charitable country in the history of the world (we have given more help around the world than any other nation in history, so take the weed our of your pipe and put that in there and smoke it!)"
,thunderbum,2010-01-15T00:30Z,"@tavery80: if you do get the app, could ya send me a message? Need it too. Tx!"
,trickdaddy0024,2010-01-15T07:43Z,"""I would say that the liberal party is the master at using death, suffering, and tragedy to politically discredit their enemies look at Katrina, the liberals jumped to blame bush for the natural disaster."" -- TedKennedy Ok which liberals? Who blamed bush?...TedKennedy, when you begin an arguement please do not state opinions...Just the facts please...Example...Bush was slow to react to New Orleans when he had advance warning of the Hurricane...""Video shows Bush got explicit Katrina warning"" Here is the link  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11627394/from/RSS/ Yes this is from MSNBC! Do not blurt out statement when you havent checked your facts...Or do you indeed have the link from Foxnews or Drudge Report backing up your claim? Next, ""looked at how they tried to use the death of Ted Kennedy"" --TedKennedy, would have voted for Healthcare while Ronald Regan would have voted...Also ""Further can i ask why the hell you listen to rush if you don't like him?"" --TedKennedy I have one word for you...FREEDOM...I live in a country where you are free to do almost anything you want...If its legal...FAST MONEY does george soros pay you to? --NO Your life must be pretty depressing if you sit around all day listening to people you don't like --I WORK WHILE LISTENING TO RUSH  just so you can post on here to the 75 people who download this torrent about how you disagree with him. --WHO CARES...END"
