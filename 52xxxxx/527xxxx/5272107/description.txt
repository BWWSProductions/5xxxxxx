           Al Shines, former king of the US race car track circuit,       
           has a hard time starting his own team, once he's fired by      
           his sponsor Robin Cates. Robin hired Al's immature             
           daughter Kylie Shines instead. She resents Al's                
           inevitable 'absence' as a widowed father, as well as the       
           reigning champion, equally young but professionally            
           vetted Kid Walker. Kylie tries to prove herself against        
           Kid while having an on-off affair with him. Cates's            
           marketing strategy dictates his intentions to manipulate       
           Walker and both Shines racers.
