The style of filming was cool in places, a bit unique. True, it was a bit predictable but that's not a problem. The race scenes were not the best in the world; it looked like an after school special, but other than that, it was very entertaining. Michelle fans will love it, if you like her, you will too! I definitely give it two thumbs up!"
