After building up a cult following with years of non-stop touring, Rush nearly lost their fans with CARESS OF STEEL. Taking their cue from British bands like Yes and Genesis, they began to expand their sound beyond that of a typical power trio. ... Full DescriptionGone were the riff-based songs and extended jams, replaced with more intricate arrangements, multi-part songs and deeper, introspective lyrics. Ironically, it was these elements that would later win them an international audience. 

The album kicks off with "Bastille Day," a tough account of the French revolution, followed with an almost comical song "I Think I'm Going Bald," which finds Geddy Lee lamenting his advancing age (he was all of 21 or 22 at the time). The main reason to own this album is the second half: a song in six parts called "The Fountain of Lamneth" tracing the story of a boy who finds a purpose for his life and can not rest until it is fulfilled. After years of setbacks and dodging obstacles, he finally reaches his goal as an old man and discovers that the purpose is the journey. This theme would surface many times in later songs, the band adopting it as their philosophy.
