(It seems you all liked it ;-)
"" No news, good news""
cheers"
,scottsasse,2011-07-18T05:13Z,"Awesome, so glad this is still seeding strong!! All the other torrents are only 700Mb or dead. I have loved this movie since I was A child. Many, many THANKS to mkvonly and seeders!!"
,scottsasse,2011-07-18T05:20Z,"Oh by the way mkvonly how exactly are those in need of subs to get them as listed when this torrent has only one file (the movie)?? I don't need them but you know how bitchy some ingrates on TPB can be!! Lotta Love, DrScott "
,SON-of-ZORQ,2011-07-18T21:32Z,They are built into the file I expect. Just select them from the menu in your player.

Indeed, unlike .avi where the .srt subs are extra files needed the .mvk-format have the subs integrated.

Great upload again mkvonly, many thanks man!"
