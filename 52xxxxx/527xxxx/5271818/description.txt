
This documentary explores the piracy of online music and movies. 
It traces through the birth of the Napster program and how it was shut off because of lawsuits from the music industry, talks about how some rock bands 
sided with the music industry and were dead against piracy, also cites a couple of others who were happy to share their music online with their fans. 
Interesting part is where the record companies seem to be pushing for piracy control at the hardware level, where they actually want anti-piracy security 
measures to be shipped with the PC hardware itself :)
