           Longtime friendships are put to the ultimate test when a       
           dying woman summons her best friends from college into         
           the wilderness for a four day camping trip, and everyone       
           quickly discovers that they haven't exactly been told the      
           whole truth about her current condition. Lucy (Missi           
           Pyle) has always been obese, and now that her health has       
           taken a turn for the worse, she wants to spend her last        
           days with the estranged college social group who helped        
           her through one of the most difficult periods of her           
           entire life. Upon learning that Lucy is on her deathbed,       
           her loyal friends all rush to Montana in order to be by        
           her side for one last weekend together. Immediately upon       
           arriving, however, it's glaringly obvious to all of            
           Lucy's friends that something isn't right. Her condition       
           is a far cry from what she made it out to be in her            
           desperate messages, and as tensions begin to rise Lucy         
           realizes that the people standing before her today simply      
           aren't the same people whom she remembered so fondly from      
           college. With no modern conveniences to fall back on as        
           the reunited group begins an arduous four-day hike into        
           the wilderness, everyone's deepest fears and demons            
           gradually claw their way to the surface, leaving Lucy to       
           wonder whether her "final wish" was truly the brilliant        
           idea she initially thought it to be.
