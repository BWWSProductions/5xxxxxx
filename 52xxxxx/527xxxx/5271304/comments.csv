,oldSMfan,2010-01-12T00:11Z,"@dheltem
Sorry M8! I apologise! Got carried away, I guess! My honest mistake!

It is just that I use Vista/VLC without any ""extra"" codecs, and do not burn/convert or anything of the like, and have never had any problems with SM's rips!! So it does get to me when PPL use this and that, do this and that, and then say something's no quite right!

Cheers!

:O)"

,sorren-en-ciel,2010-01-15T11:37Z,"Hi, I have some audio sync issue with this release. I never have found issue with the file that uploaded by secretmyth before. The audio is just not sync with the video. The sample is fine. Does anybody have same issue? I though some audio is corrupt, so I download it again the second time, but still the audio issue still there. Any help suggestion?"
,KkkkkkTzs,2010-01-16T05:54Z,Audio sync issue if I use K-Lite codec. But same computer (W7 64bit) with Windows Media Player its OK. I hate original WMP. I think a few more movies uploaded 2010 from SecretMyth also have this issue with my computer.
,sorren-en-ciel,2010-01-16T07:37Z,"I'm using CCCP pack, using mpc, wmp, zp, vlc, all have audio sync problem. Never get that problem usually."
,bobyboy484950,2010-02-16T09:58Z,"thanks secret myth your movies are great,"
