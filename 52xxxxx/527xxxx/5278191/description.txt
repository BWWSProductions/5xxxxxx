This music is from various all-star Concert Bands that
I was in in Jr/Sr High School.  It is a good sampling
of some of the standard band literature, although a
few of the pieces are very 70-ish.

Generally, the performances range from good to excellent.
These MP3 files were made from LP records of the concerts,
after cleaning up the clicks and pops.  Most of the
recordings sound pretty good, although there are a
couple that have pretty bad distortion that I could not
remove.

To the best of my knowledge, none of this material is
copyrighted.
