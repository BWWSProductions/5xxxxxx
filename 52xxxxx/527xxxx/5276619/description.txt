Hi, Guy's Some People Walked With The Question How to Install Mw2 For The Zero Gear Patch? 
Well this is how! Download this! It Will Let You Install Without Steam And Without Entering a Key Or Anything....
I Got a stupid thing in vista i selected where to install and it installed at:
C:/program1    just noticed that you guys wont think that it didn't work or something ;)
It Will Take 30min to install on a fast pc..... so longer if it's a slower one :P
