,Smarter90,2010-01-12T12:02Z,"No, this is the Beta Client, you must have a Beta Key."
,phedboi,2010-01-12T23:56Z,free beta key found here and official torrent is here.
,Nakorentreri,2010-01-13T02:29Z,to Phedboi: Where can you get free beta key ??? PLEASE WHERE???
,sovietsickle,2010-01-13T02:45Z,go to the star trek online offical website follow the links to get a beta key it is easy anyone with a brain can do it.
,Nakorentreri,2010-01-13T06:00Z,to sovietsickle: I was under the impression the beta keys were only randomly given to a few on the official site....ill go recheck and hope your right
,sovietsickle,2010-01-13T14:03Z,there is links to other websites that give out beta keys on the offical i think i got my beta key from fileplanet just waiting to download the game now 
,marxus,2010-01-13T23:21Z,"Most of the free keys are gone now, but I did just find a site that at least as of 10 minutes ago still had some free ones.

Just post in the contest thread with your favorite star trek quote and you get a key. Its how I got mine"
,goo79,2010-02-19T00:50Z,"Now that beta is over, will this beta client allow itself to be patched to full retail if you install it now?

I have my own key to use but the download from the STO site (and their provided torrent link) is going extremely slow. I was wondering if downloading this will work instead of going through Cryptic to get it. The torrent they provided is dloading@ 30k which will take a couple days at least..."
,851995,2010-08-10T00:53Z,how can i get a working key for this cansomeone give me one??
,dragop,2010-11-11T16:51Z,"well obviously this beta isnt going to work anymore, as there is now a official version - if you would like to try- the download the demo from the official site, no crack is at the time possible , as its a mmorpg on a server and there is no access to the source code..."
