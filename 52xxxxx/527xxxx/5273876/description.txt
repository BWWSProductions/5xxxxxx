"Christian Power Electronics". I must admit, I was skeptical myself. 
Although I have yet to find printed lyrics of their works (I doubt 
that they are included in their albums except for their newest, al-
though I could be mistaken), I did manage to find an interview on an 
"unofficial" fan site, in which a doctor tells a strange story in 
which he saw the musical half of the duo, Martin Bladh. Throughout 
the interview, he analyzes the lyrics presented on "Oedipus Dethro-
ned" from a Biblical standpoint. What makes the interview so bizarre 
is that the writer goes one step further, and proclaims Martin Bladh 
to be the resurrected Christ! While the music is obviously obsessed 
with various Christian principles (mainly regarding the crucifixion), 
it is perhaps safer to say that the music approaches the matter with 
a more ambiguous attitude, while outwardly projecting a zealous (al-
most fanatical) image. Proof of this can be found on the lyrics 
printed on the front of the "Four Studies..." EP IRM released in 
early 2000. The graphic lyrics, although presenting the listener 
with an immediate horror, are very symbolic in nature, and thus open 
to multiple interpretation.

But what about this album in particular? It basically consists of 
deep electric bass lines, muted kick drum rhythms, and various higher 
pitched squeals and beeps. Various kinds of static, distortion, and 
feedback also freely float throughout the songs. This is complimented 
by Erik Jarl's highly distorted and watery shouting (ala Will's John 
McRae, although in a much less irritating manner). Industrial ele-
ments also appear from time to time. Finally, a small amount of samp-
les are scattered throughout the songs as well (mainly in the first 
song).

So, how does the album stack up? Well, it is best to ignore the pse-
udo-religious/spiritual overtones and enjoy the album through what 
you probably sought out in it in the first place: the noise. Also, it 
is always refreshing to find a power electronics outfit that manages 
to be effective and menacing without resorting to cartoonish vio-
lence, childish misanthropic stances, or highly charged political in-
correctness. There is also a nice diversity to the sounds as well, 
ranging from alluring hums (some of which border on dark ambient) and 
the highly oscillated and distorted (one of the best songs is "Inside 
The Skull Of A Manniquin", which strangely reminds me of Throbbing 
Gristle's "Hamburger Lady" for some reason, mainly because of the vo-
cals).

Power electronics is of course an acquired taste, but for those with 
a taste of the electronically unusual, "Oedipus Dethroned" is an ex-
cellent place to start. Cold Meat Industries should still be selling 
this album, otherwise you might have to search a little bit. If you 
can listen to their contributions to the "Nihil" compilation on that 
label, they are also quite excellent and rank up their with the best 
of their work.

EDIT: Am eventually going to clean up the bloated labels list; have 
noticed there are a few that can safely be removed (mainly the vari-
ous record label labels I will more than likely not use again). The 
movies are of IRM during a label festival 2007. While the actual vi-
suals do not leave much to write home about, the audio is a bit cle-
aner than usual with these types of recordings.
