Your 7-step prescription for creating a compassionately competitive work culture

For centuries, leaders have been operating within a â€œcontrol and competeâ€ mindset. But times are changing. More and more, at the helm of successful companies, youâ€™ll find a different sort of leader. Collaborators, not controllers, they are â€œsquare apples,â€ bold men and women who dare to create success by reshaping the workplace in unexpected ways.

In Apples Are Square, innovation consultants and celebrated authors Dr. Susan Smith Kuczmarski and Thomas D. Kuczmarski share with you the secrets of how to become a square apple in your organization. To develop their groundbreaking strategy for success, the authors interviewed dozens of leadership pioneers, including Craig Newmark, founder of craigslist; Mary Ellen Weber, former NASA astronaut; and NFL star Chris Zorich, whose personal story inspired the title of this book. With the tools in Apples Are Square, youâ€™ll be able to take any bruised environment and reshape it into a positive force.
