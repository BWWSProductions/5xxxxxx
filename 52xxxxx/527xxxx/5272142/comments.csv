,narmour,2010-01-13T00:26Z,"Hey guys. EZTV. I've been using evtv torrents since forever, never had any trouble at all. I dont know why but for all 3 of the EZTV torrents I want to download (Castle, Big Bang, Being Human) it shows up 'Error: access is denied' I've tried adding a few public trackers I use and erased all data and tried to download again with no luck. Won't get passed 0% sometimes gets to about 0.2%. Please help!"
,mynameisnotjonas,2010-01-14T04:32Z,"@t0m5k1

from what i can tell, moon dookie was merely answering a query, not providing a link to his own torrent. as there doesn't seem to be a forum here i consider this perfectly acceptable!"
