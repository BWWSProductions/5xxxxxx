3 Balloons is Stephen's first new album in over four years, featuring all-new
material, and recorded in a studio: "My last two albums were recorded live in
concert, just guitar and voice, and I wanted to do something different this
time. Whenever I write or perform a new song, in my head I hear pianos and drums
and tubas and string sections and jug bands and children's choirs. I want you to
hear those things too. Except we couldn't find a children's choir whose parents
would let them sing about drug mules and transsexual prostitutes. Maybe next
time.''
