Having returned from the edge of obscurity with the ambitious concept album 2112 and years of almost non-stop touring, Rush decided to buy themselves a little time with a double live album. Recorded in 1976 in front of a hometown Toronto audience, ... Full DescriptionALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE is the first of what would become a Rush tradition: following every fourth studio album with a live one as a way of closing out a chapter in the band's history. 

The set kicks off with a pair of hard rocking numbers, "Bastille Day" and "Anthem," that pack more power than would be expected from a trio. "2112" proves that this still young band was more than just muscle; the abridged version heard here still clocks in at over 15 minutes. From their second album, "By-Tor And The Snow Dog" is the band's first attempt at a multi-part opus, weaving a fanciful story around an extended jam that recalls their earliest days as a bar band banging out Cream tunes. The album closes out with four songs from their debut. Taken as a whole, ALL THE WORLD shows how far Rush had come in the previous three years and hints at what was to come. 

Recorded live at Massey Hall, Toronto, Canada between June 11 & 13, 1976.
