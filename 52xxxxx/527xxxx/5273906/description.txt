For the second show of the new year Jason discusses the top news of the past week and offers his analysis.  

He does a lengthy review of the movie "Collapse," and in the end advises not buying the Peak-Oil propaganda.

Author of "The Dollar Meltdown," and talk show host Charles Goyette is a guest in the second hour.

Jason also takes a number of calls.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
