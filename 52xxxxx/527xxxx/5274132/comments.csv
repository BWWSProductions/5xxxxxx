And even if I used 128kbps aac and the BP for ipods, I'd still beat your encode by half even though I have around twice the resolution."

,tdscr,2010-01-13T03:19Z,"Uh, still my encode of 60-70MiB and I have much higher quality resolution and sound, so yeah, your encodes stink."
,kingoearthworms,2010-01-13T19:16Z,"The higher res won't play on ipods, I can tell you that much... Grabbing one of yours now to see how it compares.  I will definitely have to look into CRF.  Thanks, fellas..."
,kingoearthworms,2010-01-13T20:43Z,"Okay, apparently I'm wrong and ipods do play 264 up to the standard 640x480 now (I don't really keep up with the firmware updates being that I don't actually own one).  The difference between 2pass/crf is pretty negligible at 320x180 but this resolution revelation changes everything.  Damn."
