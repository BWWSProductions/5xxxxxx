           High school dropout and aspiring musician, Mike, spends        
           his days hanging out with his friends and confronting the      
           members of the church next door. Most members have             
           learned to keep their distance, but Sister Thomas is           
           determined to open Mike s mind to GOD and religion.            
           Connecting through a love for music she convinces Mike to      
           pick up the Bible and start reading. He quickly learns         
           that the Bible truly is a book of songs and slowly starts      
           to believe in himself again. With the help of Sister           
           Thomas, Mike stands up to his friends and begins to            
           choose a more righteous path.
