I was hoping someone would put up something similar to what 80z forever is doing for the obscure 80's music. I have most of the popular bands like Camel, Caravan, Genesis, Gentle Giant, etc. But it these singular albums where some true treasures lie. TYVM for these downloads SB!"
,vandergraaf100,2010-01-13T12:20Z,Part 10! You have been busy spandauB!  Many thanks! :)

Amen ! "
,Bioshock1000,2010-01-27T08:27Z,"The best upload on the net by far. Thankyou so much, particularly for the High Tide and Gracious albums. I've had worn out cassette copies of those for years, played so much they are virtually unlistenable. Not only do you upload quality versions, but you upload the versions with the bonus tracks too! Thank you. Any idea when number 11 will arrive? Sorry to be a pain, but this music keeps me going on my cols, dark journeys to work in the mornings. Thank you again"
,gearofwar,2010-01-27T21:19Z,"Yet another masterpiece, SB.
If there's radio in heaven, you'd be DJ."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-01-27T21:59Z,"@Bioshock1000: More on the way soon.  Keep checking back, just working on sorting out I section, lots of Italian Prog coming your way... just need a bit of time to get this next one done.  Was having a short break for a while due to me trying to sort my college stuff out, it's hard to do everything at once!  I hope to bring you the next installment soon.

Thanks for all your great comments, they mean such a lot and I worship you all for downloading these bands, there is some amazing music just waiting to be discovered and that goes for ANYBODY!! :-D"

Keep up the good work! i'll run into you somewhere in comments :)"
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-01-31T20:33Z,"Cheers Bubs... would be cool one day to have one of those next to my name, maybe if I get this collection finished then it would be worth doing that for and also for making a big achievement in making these into MP3s..."
,vandergraaf100,2010-01-31T20:44Z,Dont know about a skull you should get an OBE next to your name for services to prog fans!
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-01-31T20:54Z,"@vandergraaf100: Cheers mate :-)  Just to let you know, I am just finishing off Part 11 now, I'm gonna get it upped tonight soon, just give me a few hours and it should be on here (just as long as pirate bay will allow me to upload the torrent tonight, last time I had to wait a day because the code wasn't coming up for torrent upload).  There's some good italian prog coming your way very soon.  Once I get the letter I done I can get on with J next..."
,throwin_mixer,2010-03-30T20:55Z,"over a decade ago, a local independent radio station was blasting all sorts of bizarre tracks that i have been looking for for years. 

three have eluded me since, sun-ra's ""space is the place"" (which i finally found once i figured out who it was), a song about giant-man (""take me into hand mr. giant-man..."" is all i remember), and high tide's ""...protection racket""--which you have just provided me access to! 

(if anyone knows what in god's good musicalia is the giant-man song, do tell...)"
,00uber,2010-12-03T00:23Z,@throwin_mixer a quick google search turns up Mr. Giant Man by James Last.
