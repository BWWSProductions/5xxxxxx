These are the first 2 songs I ever recorded myself on my laptop at home a few years ago.

The first is a song I wrote on Rottnest Island, Western Australia about a hidden beach I found. I know I wasn't the first person to discover it but at the time, it really felt that way. The strange organ sounds fading in and out is an Ebow on my acoustic Maton, recorded in every note and sampled over the recording. Creepy sound I think.

The other is an unrequited love song called "Waiting for One". The other vocal on this recording is my good friend and co-writer of "13 Minutes". If you get the chance to listen to some of his music, I highly recommend it.

I hope you enjoy my stuff and don't forget to leave a comment.
