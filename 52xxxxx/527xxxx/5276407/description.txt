Tito Puente, Sr., (April 20, 1923Ã¢â‚¬â€œMay 31, 2000), born Ernesto Antonio Puente, Jr., was a Latin Jazz and Mambo musician. The son of native Puerto Ricans Ernest and Ercilia Puente, of Spanish Harlem in New York City, Puente is often credited as "El Rey" (the King) of the timbales and "The King of Latin Music". He is best known for dance-oriented mambo and Latin jazz compositions that helped keep his career going for 50 years. 
He and his music appear in many films such as The Mambo Kings and Fernando Trueba's Calle 54. He guest starred on several television shows including The Cosby Show and The Simpsons.

Additional drums (especially snare and bassdrum,which were not used in the original recordings) were digitally added by Frenz using Goldwave software, making the tracks sound funkier.
