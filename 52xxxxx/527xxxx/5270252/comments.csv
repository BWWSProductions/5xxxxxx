I can't find anything on IMDB that corresponds to the title of this torrent, so would you please, Mr/Mrs/Ms Anonymous, give us some information as to IMDB and/or the names of all episodes if you have them easily available."
,uffesnuffe,2010-01-15T20:49Z,I found the answer myself: The fourth file is a bonus feature with stills from the war. The series is from 2008 and with a running length of 456 minutes.
