a: 8
v: 8
m: 8

audio: 
very audible, not very tinny, dialog is easy to make out, sometimes the audience laughs but can't really blame anyone for that. ha

video: 
great for a cam, easy to make out all the visuals considering there is not a lot of 'action scenes' and ~95% of the movie takes place in bright rooms or during daylight hours.

movie: I enjoyed it and would recommend this cam. 

Gracias .BONE., much appreciated!
