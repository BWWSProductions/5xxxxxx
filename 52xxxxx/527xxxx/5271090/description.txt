Chronicles the tragic life of the Diff'rent Strokes 
star who died of a drug overdose at 35. Born to an 
unwed, teenage mother, Plato was put up for adoption. 
She appeared in her first TV ad when she was just 7, 
and at age 14 she was hired for Diff'rent Strokes. Six 
years later she was forced to leave the show when she 
became pregnant. Plato then languished in the world of 
B-movies and even soft core pornography, all the while 
struggling with an addiction to prescription drugs and 
alcohol. Plato's rise and fall continues to have a haunting 
effect on the culture of child celebrity in Hollywood.
