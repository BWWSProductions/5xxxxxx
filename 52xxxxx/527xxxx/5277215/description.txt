Longtime friendships are put to the ultimate test when a dying woman summons her best friends from college into the wilderness for a four day camping trip, and everyone quickly discovers that they havenâ€™t exactly been told the whole truth about her current condition. Lucy (Missi Pyle) has always been obese, and now that her health has taken a turn for the worse, she wants to spend her last days with the estranged college social group who helped her through one of the most difficult periods of her entire life.
