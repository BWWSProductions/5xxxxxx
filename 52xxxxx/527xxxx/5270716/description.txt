      8 Out of 10 Cats is back for an incredible ninth series. The
      cheeky comedy panel series sets out to predict and analyse what
      the almighty British public thinks about the week's most talked
      about subjects. Presenter and stand up comic Jimmy Carr takes
      the centre chair and is joined by witty team captains Sean Lock
      and Jason Manford. Alongside them are panellists from the world
      of comedy, entertainment and showbiz. This edition's guests
      include Claudia Winkleman and Jamelia. Each team thrashes out
      the topics of the week by examining surveys, opinion polls and
      statistics; discussing all that is silly and serious. Potential
      subjects could include showbiz gossip, world politics and even
      the weather. Can the team captains reach the same conclusions as
      the public... and most importantly, who will give the funniest
      answers?
