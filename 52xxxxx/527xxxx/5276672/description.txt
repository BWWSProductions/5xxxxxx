This is NOT my rip but im seedboxing it with screens
A simple thankyou ensures my seedboxes are given priority on this file!(you will get the file faster)
No thanks=No re-seeds,No help~No worries i can't be arsed either.
Screens are posted for this file,how-ever some sites do not allow all picture hosts(and i do not have time upload pics to a certain host for a specific site).
I will not respond in this thread to any comments from now on(unless you are a member of a private site or are a respected member of a public site).
Thankyou to all the REAL contributors to the sites who keep the faith everyday.
Leechers,Ass-wipes,Zero posters keep on moaning into our deaf ears.
Contact? Old Skool-respected only (you know how);-)
