,Gaastra_NAC,2010-01-12T22:43Z,thanks a lot :)
,pravda605,2010-01-13T22:36Z,don't mention it
,simao20dv,2010-01-14T02:52Z,is this the real game? or just a demo?
,pravda605,2010-01-14T16:00Z,full game
,lj_92,2010-01-14T21:40Z,Is there any way to get it in English?
,jontoupin,2010-01-15T05:12Z,The english version is out to download on germantrucksimulator.com but we need a crack to unlock the demo 
,steve30x,2010-01-16T21:00Z,Just download the demo and put the lang_1033.dll into the folder where the language file is. That will convert it to english
,jontoupin,2010-01-16T21:55Z,aleready try that but doesn't work it only change the language on the first screen where you choose opengl or direct x i guess the game language is built in the game.exe
,osan7,2010-01-17T00:43Z,"#steve30x 

i tried that, didnt work.. Fuck.
Gonna try again.. 
Great game otherwise and i get angry when i dont understand some german words, so if it works this time i wont wait for the fucking English version. "
,osan7,2010-01-17T14:02Z,Where the f... is the English version? Cant wait!
,laporto,2010-01-17T22:04Z,"steve30x is right, here is how you make this game english.

1. Download the english demo,
2. install the english demo somewhere,
3. install the full game,
4. copy copy the lang files from the demo to the german full.

change the file langs.settings to this:

""language_acronymes"" {
	""1033"":		""en_en""
}

""language_names"" {
	""1033"":		""English""
}

""preferred"":	""1033""


DONE!!!!"
,Rbnqss,2010-01-18T00:07Z,"No, it wont work, all it does it produces the ui_new game - shit and game crashes so don't believe this. "
,Rbnqss,2010-01-18T00:49Z,"It wont be this easy cause the language settings are partly written in exe file and you would need to edit it. You wont get this to work without editing exe files, thtat's why they have named the english GTS to 1,01. "
,osan7,2010-01-19T16:01Z,No English yet? 
,meke7,2010-01-20T04:58Z,I'm also looking for the english version with a crack for it. Very lame to play without understading a word. Its already a game that demands some patience from what I could see.
,osan7,2010-01-23T00:03Z,"LoL, no English so fail scs"
,Killazer,2010-01-23T09:21Z,"http://projectw.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=1583965&start=0

Register to that site, and then download the game.

ITS ENGLISH! Installation is german thought, but the game itself is Full english!"
,osan7,2010-01-23T12:37Z,"No its not English, Guys dont download!"
,Killazer,2010-01-23T14:47Z,"Sorry, it isnt english. My bad. I thought it was..."
,osan7,2010-01-24T11:23Z,"#killazer

,osan7,2010-01-25T22:09Z,"Rofl, No English yet.. I know guys i have posted here 3 times but I WANT FUCKING ENGLISH.

,PlayMakern,2010-01-30T14:59Z,Is it so hard to just buy the game?! :P ?30 isn't that much ^^
,NSilva,2010-01-30T17:22Z,"lubkin5, could you please tell the correct link to the english version? Thanks"
,lubkin5,2010-01-30T18:05Z,"English: download.hell+share.sk/anglictina-gts.zip/917925  or  file+factory.com/file/a2g1caa/n/Angli_tina_GTS.zip (you must repair link, there is + in it)"
,osan7,2010-01-30T19:19Z,Why should we buy it when we can do another things with the money such as eating at McDonalds :D 
,osan7,2010-01-30T19:21Z,Fix the link dude! It doesnt work
,NSilva,2010-01-30T22:22Z,"There are 2 links: download hell and file factory.
On both there is a ""+"" sign, just delete it and choose download hell or file factory ;)"
,meke7,2010-01-31T10:13Z,But how to apply it this archive to turn into english? I overwrited the ones in 'Game Files' and then I went to Documents and changed de_de to en_eu but the game sticks with the 'ui' thing at the menu that leads to crash. I don't understand CZ so can someone tell how to do it?
,meke7,2010-01-31T10:18Z,I just needed to add that MOD archieve. I wasnt understanding what I had to do with it and now its working perfectly. Thanks for the link.
,lubkin5,2010-01-31T12:09Z,"For those who donÂ´t know how to apply English to GTS from links above: 

1.) Place the files from folder GAME Files to your game install folder (C:\Program Files\German Truck Simulator)
Overwrite the file langs and add the lang_1033.dll to your bin\win_x86 folder

2.) Place the Locale.scs to your mod directory documents\German Truck Simulator\mod

Now you can select between English / German in the menu of the game!
Maybe You have to edit ""config"" in: documents\German Truck Simulator, change uset g_lang ""de_de""   to   uset g_lang ""en_eu"". 
And play in English."
,murat987,2010-02-23T22:34Z,Does the game work in german or is it a virus
,ivanwoi,2011-01-17T18:56Z,"ENGLISH PATCH!!!

http://www.filefront.com/15468935/english-GTS.rar/

1.) Place the files from folder GAME Files to your game install folder (where base.scs is) (C:\Program Files\German Truck Simulator for example)
    It should overwrite the file langs.settings and add the lang_1033.dll to your bin\win_x86 folder (for now there was only lang_1031.dll)
2.) Place the Locale.scs to your mod directory \German Truck Simulator\mod

there you go!:-) now you can select between english / german in launcher and they both work!"
