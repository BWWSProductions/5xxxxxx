Dead Ringers is a UK radio (and television) comedy impressions show on BBC Radio 4  

Despite its emphasis on British personalities who may not be well known in other countries, Dead Ringers has been shown outside the UK on BBC Prime in Europe and Africa, BBC America in the United States, ABC in Australia, BBC Canada in Canada and UK.TV in New Zealand, but has had to be re-edited considerably; although much of the show can be watched without contextual knowledge.

Dead Ringers transports you to an alternative Radio 4 where deadly continuity announcers rule the roost and Home Truths finally (inevitably?) clashes with John Peel's Radio 1 Show. Where a desperate Time Lord calls directory enquiries in search of his sworn arch-enemy and Alan Bennett and Thora Hird are the kind of thugs you most certainly wouldn't share your buttered scones with.
