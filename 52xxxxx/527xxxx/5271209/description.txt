The Road DVDSCR XVID READNFO V2-ToXiC re-encode to lower the size: as you can see, the movie it's 1,49GB(109min26') and not 1,92GB.
I know that I might not be the only one uploading this movie, but I still doing it. Why ?
Cause my torrent has inside the re-encoded "v2" of ToXiC release (the second one). I got to inform you about the quality :
-a very little sync issue with audio for a minute or two, but no big deal;
-might seem a little dark: colours are fine it's a dark film;
-a very little bit of missing footage, but just for a few seconds during a flashback, skips ahead at 58:06, really no big deal at all.
