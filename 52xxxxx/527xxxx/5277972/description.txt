This is Phoenix Wright for the Wii (Wiiware).
It is blown up to fit your TV. 
It is for NTSC (America) but will work if you have the preloader hack REGION FREE CHANNELS activated.
Install using WAD MANAGER any version, put it in the folder called wad.
Tested on 4.0 NTSC Wii.
This is my first upload! Yay!
