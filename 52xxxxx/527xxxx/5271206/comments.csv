,planetnews,2010-01-29T20:18Z,"The tracks are intended to end prematurely. 

""Their go-to trick for the first half of the album is to include bits of sound that abruptly cut off, usually sung phrases that drop entirely out of the mix mid-syllable. This may be aggravating for some listeners, but this counterintuitive move makes sense in context, indicating distraction and tongue-tied indecision. This is a perfect example of the group's genius as a studio band: They get very cerebral in arranging their material, but every clever move is entirely in the service of maximizing physical impact and gut-level response."" -- Pitchfork review"

,vicvod,2011-08-04T13:53Z,Super fast download. I'm 60 years old and the first time I saw this band I thought WTF was that. But then I saw them again and really listened and they blew my mind. Britt Daniel is a f'n genius! Thanks bubanee!
