***NOTES***
PICTURE QUALITY IS GREAT BUT SOUND QUALITY IS NOT GREAT...

"Unless they're tagged 'STUDIO' which rarely happens, virtually all english language R5 encodes are the russian R5 video synced to whatever was the best line audio available at the time, which is what this is.

If you downloaded any of the TS's for this (IMAGiNE, PRiSM, etc) you've heard this audio before.

This is not that great of audio. It's ok. I wouldn't call it 'bad' and it does sound like line audio not cam audio, but it has a light background hiss and repeated clicking noise that gets louder/quieter at different parts. Not so much to spoil it though imho, but just enough I can't imagine anyone wouldn't notice it."
