Tara Reid in Playboy January/ February 2010

Tara Reid poses for the January/ February 2010 cover of Playboy magazine. The cover photo is typically modest and non-naked. However, it was confirmed some time ago that Reid would be going fully nude for the inside photos.

Now whether this is normal person nude, like when youâ€™re walking around the house naked after having a shower, or what Iâ€™m coming to call Playboy naked where you basically get to see the personâ€™s armpits or back as they struggle to cover themselves up, is unknown. As more of the photos leak, theyâ€™ll probably be posted here for a laugh. For those who are wondering, Reid confessed she posed for the magazine to prove her Franken-nips werenâ€™t that scary. After several botched plastic surgeries, she wanted to show she was still full of the sessies.
