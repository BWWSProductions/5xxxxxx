Hi,

I have attached a video in vob form, as well as samples in other formats. I will be uploading new versions in other formats over the next few days.

That's a sample

I go by the name of theshadefalcon but itâ€™s not my real name. I have been exploring different possible identities on the internet. Consider it a case of identity theft where everyone is a suspect. I got this name from a web artist on sheezy art. It struck me as being reminiscent of shamanism, of the shadow realm where souls go to find their peace, and to the birds of the world that inspired them. This was certainly not a name picked at random. I also go by digital shaman, falcon haney, the balloon boy, for his is a story pulled straight from these pages. I go by the name of leviathan. I go by the name of the phoenix, by the name of Octavia Butler, by the name of Matt Groening, By the name of Scroobius Pip and Dan Le Sac. I go by the name of the minotaur. I go by the name of Rick Roderick, I go by the name of Marcuse, of Foucault, of David Bowie, of Serge Golian, of the idiot, of Samuel Butler, Sam Fuller, Samuel Johnson, Enrico Fermi, Nicola Tesla, Mike Watt, Watts Stax. I am all of these because they are energy. They are ghosts in this world (mike watt still alive, not a ghost) and I have been channeling them so they would have their say, once more, in this: another darkest hour. I would never take a name like that in vain.

Iâ€™m the webmaster at mythofthemachine.org. This torrent is very special to me and I hope that everyone interested in copyright, media ownership, revolution, and the search for a more just and verdant economy will take an hour to watch this movie.

Itâ€™s a presentation about what I want my site to become, how I view the relationship between man and machine at the moment, and some ideas about how we can all platform each other on the internet to accomplish all of the amazing giant ideas that should already be happening. Ideas which are laying stagnant as the world is run by dinosaurs who have literally no idea what theyâ€™re doing. Theyâ€™re running this planet from a perspective of alienation. They know that their time is done mucking about and so they are quite aggressively holding us down with the last sliver of our coattails.

Call me an optimist but I think all of that is going to change very soon. I can name the date even; Iâ€™m so living in the future (in that I have been paying attention to the present) that I can give you a date.

March 4th.


That is a link to info about the UC Strikes in California. I will be taking that day to teach, dance, write, sing, share, protest and relax. I will be spending my valuable time and energy on something that wonâ€™t net me a dime, but it will be worth it because I genuinely believe, in a way my pessimism never has allowed me to before, that after that day the power sway in this country will be radically altered, and every extra voice in the fray will add yet more momentum to the dragonâ€™s swing.

This is a key changing ceremony, itâ€™s not an anarchist boot stomp, I donâ€™t want anyone to burn anything down. People! Smart people! Smart anarchists who understand the corruption, do not burn anything down! We no longer have to resort to those tactics, The power structure has shifted. I know that for centuries it has seemed as if power would never give itself over willingly to love and good ideas, but the internet has changed that. We are finding each other everywhere. Now weâ€™re just going to keep marching, sitting in, teaching, meditating, shouting and sharing, and weâ€™re going to have a key exchange on March 4th. It wonâ€™t be all the keys, but it will be a bunch. So donâ€™t resort to violence, The violence that is implicit in the state will come out that day, its inevitable, and I wouldnâ€™t lie to anyone that I thought differently. Gandhi had some really good ideas. I used to be torn between Malcom and MLK, because they both appeal to different levels of frustration, but their ideas have both been needed at different times in the recent past. Without both of them the civil rights gains of the last half-century would not have happened.

But now we just show them our numbers, they get scared, and we make a fair offer on the buildings vacated by banks and industry gone completely amuck. Obama has done something big, he is holding the massive sheep dogs of indsutry and banking at bay for a split second, by giving them everything the want and leaving the window open for us. We need to sneak through that window, send for help, and take a chance. We need to believe that our belief in what is true and golden will triumph over what is falsely described as gold.

Right now is MLK and Gandhi time. The machine is as weak as it will ever be right now. If we miss this chance we have missed the chance of a lifetime. The machine is turning over to show its soft underbelly and itâ€™s letting us know that this is the time we may eviscerate it if we so choose. Strong word? Violence? No. No violencek, we eviscerate with gay pride parades and shitty hippie jam circles and kisses on the tv screen where bill o reilly sleeps. This is a party. Get ready for the best party youâ€™ve ever been to. I will be djâ€™ing and giving presentations all day that day in Los Angeles and on the internet and to the world. I want to keep sharing information about how the banks have managed to re enslave us for the thousandth time, and how its not going to happen ever again, because the internet has let us know in small chunks that we have the power. Its crumbled like a huge chunk of cheese and like a huge chunk of anything it was hard to see it disappearing until close to the end. But the cheese is almost gone, and its time to party.

The attached torrent was made on Sunday at a friendâ€™s house and was broadcast to one loyal viewer on ustream, but I have a feeling a lot more people will see it today, I do hope you get a chance. This video, like everything I make for this, is creative commons share alike, 

Please: if you like it, remix it, re-edit it, respond, add music, add sounds, add your voice, add your heart. I didnâ€™t put hardly but one song so that it could be stripped down and everyone could season it their own way. I will keep putting up different versions of this as people send them to me and I need the help of some video editors to help me, so please get in touch.

I will be putting out different formats of this all day, get in touch for any element you might need or other format, i'm fully setup.

Never delete. Never Surrender.

Here is a link to the public school in los angeles which has more info on the UC Strikes as well as a lot of info about the attention economy, an idea that captured my imagination and focused this project to white light. Special thanks to all the folks over there who helped me with these ideas.

A full explanation of this video piece as well as my weeks long freak out making it will come later today.

Thanks
