I will seed this for a few more days but after that I'll take the plug out of the wall"

I HOPE EVERYONE SEEDS BECAUSE LOOSING THE TORRENT THAT OUR FRIEND Anonymous MADE WOULD BE REALLY SAD!"
,fredrickhoifodt,2010-03-12T20:25Z,Please seed this!! :D 
,gnr_tb,2010-12-24T12:16Z,"Thanks for the upload!
quality isn't bad at all for this resolution, I can actually watch it with 22"" on full screen and it doesn't look so bad.
S01E03 & S01E04 are missing, I can't find them anywhere :("

,skcin7,2011-05-25T18:30Z,"I downloaded and of course am very grateful to the uploader and have seeded to a 1:1 ratio. One question I have is WHY ARE THE VIDEO FILES BROKEN UP INTO SEPARATE FLVS??? Each episode is broken up into 4 separate .FLV files. Why is it done like this instead of a direct rip? Also, some episodes are missing, such as S01E01-S01E04"
