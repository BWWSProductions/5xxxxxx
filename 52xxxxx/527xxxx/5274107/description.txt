*** note ***

source for this is 25 fps. i (signalboy) normally avoid even watching PAL speedup jobs. WTF. haven't confirmed, but it appears that this is the 115 min version sped up to 96% duration (110 min).

approximately 8 flash frames sprinkled throughout. no big deal. this is also slightly grainy. definitely not suitable for non-handheld viewing. audio's good.

Another HR-PiZ team entry. If it doesn't work the same as a HolyRoses (PBUH) PSP-iPod-Zune encode, leave an informative comment.
