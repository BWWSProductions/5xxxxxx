Had to repack this because of a bad scene cut in the 720p MKV rip that caused the audio to go out of sync after the 33min 37sec mark. If you have already downloaded my previous rip, then you can get the 80MB fixed audio here:

Sorry for any inconvenience.

This is the episode that aired Jan/11/2010 which was wrongly labeled as episode 11 of season 2 by the scenes. Episode 11 airs Jan/14/2010. Fox has this episode labeled as 1.21, an unaired episode from season 1. Although it would actually fall somewhere before episode 20, so who knows its actual correct placement. I would hazard a guess that it falls after episode 15, since it was said to have started filming in early 2009. 

Initial speed will be slow, please help seed if you can, thanks.
