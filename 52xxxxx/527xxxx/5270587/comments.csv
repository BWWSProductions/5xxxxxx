Sorry to be a pain in the ass but wondered if you could help me out with Fifa 10 on pack 4. When I first install it it is fine but when I go and try to reload a 2nd time it just gets stuck on the loading screen. Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks"

Basically, once it is installed on the DS it is ok to play the first time you load it. Then if you want to play it again it freezes just after selecting the game on the main menu page.

I turn the DS on, it loads the R4 menu. I select Fifa and instead of changing to a loading screen with a progress bar moving accross the screen. It changes to a loading screen but with no movement at all and the game doesn't load.

Does that make sense?

Cheers"
