Written about a barmaid who worked at the Peninsular Hotel in Mandurah, whos alcoholic father abandoned her mother and her as a child. She told us her story one night while my mates and I were having a few beers down there. It touched me so much that I felt inspired to write about it.

Recorded at Bleedin' Ear Studio, Mandurah, Western Australia, this song features Trudy on backing vocals and Walter Moroz on Keyboard/String synth.

Please feel free to comment on what you think. Thanks guys.
