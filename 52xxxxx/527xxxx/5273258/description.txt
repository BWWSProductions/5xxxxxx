Feeding Frenzy 1 & 2, PC game. No crack or install required. Simply unRAR and drag entire folder either to Programs directory, or 

other location, and play. Once upon a time, there was another no-install version floating around. Seems to have disappeared, but 

this game is worth maintaining.

As a Win7 user, can fully assure that works in both Win7/Vista with no need to set compatibility options. Just give the UAC promts 

a nod when copying to the Programs folder (if UAC not set into Quiet Mode or otherwise).

Have fun :)
