,weiser880,2010-01-12T19:14Z,"Hey Holy,

Thanks, once again.  I just thought of something you may not have realized... going back to our discussion about some cappers creating .mp4 files that did not play on the Apple TV.  Believe it or not, iTunes can convert most of those files to play on the ATV.  If you can get the file to be added onto your iTunes library, then you're good to go - simply select the file in your library, click the ""Advanced"" tab at the top, and select ""Create Apple TV Version.""  iTunes will then turn it into a file which will play on the ATV.  You can also convert the file to play on an iPod, using the same ""Advanced"" tab.

I've had the Apple TV for over a year now, but only just learned this the other day."
