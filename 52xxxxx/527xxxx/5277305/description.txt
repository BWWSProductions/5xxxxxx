The 1998 4-part series with Depardieu as le Comte de Monte-Cristo by Dumas.

The only version I've seen floating around has hard-coded English subtitles, so when I've finally found this one (French soundtrack, no subtitles) on eMule, I've decided to share. 

Will seed intermittently each day for about 10 hours at a time, so if you are stuck - don't leave, I'll be back :)

Enjoy!
