least alot of people are seeding, guess I can not complain too much."
,ShortyDammit,2010-02-07T05:31Z,"Would be nice if you listed bitrate, framerate, resolution, codecs (especially for audio), etc.  It's a little annoying to download something without knowing these things, only to find, for example, it's got 128 Kbps mp3 audio when you prefer the original 5.1 AC3 from the DVD.  ""Video=9"" and ""Audio=9"" doesn't tell anyone anything.  I like to download and seed known quantities, not random ones.  And I'm sure others are the same way."

sorry I did not know the extact bitrate as i was given it by a friend. my apologies. All I know is I watched it & all the video is there is very good quality."
