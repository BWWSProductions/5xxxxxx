           A team of eight adrenaline junkies, looking for the            
           ultimate in paintball thrills, are blindfolded and taken       
           to a rendezvous point in the middle of a remote forest.        
           The game is on when the group is immediately ambushed and      
           under enemy fire from all directions. But something            
           doesn't feel right. Suddenly, in the midst of bursting         
           paint pellets, one of the players is hit by a real bullet.     
           Confusion reigns until they realise that this is no longer     
           a game, it is a manhunt. One by one they fall into the         
           traps set by an invisible enemy. Their only chance of          
           survival is to fight with whatever means necessary.
