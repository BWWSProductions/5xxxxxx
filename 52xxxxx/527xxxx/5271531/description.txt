[center][color=Maroon][b]Susan Magdalane Boyle (born 1 April 1961) is a Scottish singer who came to
international public attention when she appeared as a contestant on reality TV
programme Britain's Got Talent on 11 April 2009, singing "I Dreamed a Dream" from
Les Miserables. Her first album was released in November 2009 and debuted as the
number one best-selling CD on charts around the globe.

Global interest in Boyle was triggered by the contrast between her powerful voice and
her plain appearance on stage. The juxtaposition of the audience's first impression of
her with the standing ovation she received during and after her performance led to an
international media and Internet response. Within nine days of the audition, videos of
Boyle â€” from the show, various interviews and her 1999 rendition of "Cry Me a
River" â€” had been watched over 100 million times. Despite the sustained media
interest she later finished in second place in the final of the show behind dance troupe
Diversity.

Boyle's first album, I Dreamed a Dream, was released on 23 November 2009 and has
become Amazon's best-selling album in pre-sales. Its first single is a cover of the
Jagger/Richards song "Wild Horses". The album includes "You'll See", "I Dreamed a
Dream" and "Cry Me a River" According to Billboard, "The arrival of I Dreamed a
Dream ... marks the best opening week for a female artist's debut album since
SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991.[/b][/color][/center]
