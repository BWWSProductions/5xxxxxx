In the early days of his crimefighting career, the Dark Knight is making his presence felt in Gotham, slowly gaining the trust of police officer Jim Gordon.  But having stopped the menace of Hugo Strange, a new threat is rising in the city - a dangerous cult which is killing young women, and may be led by...a vampire? 

Matt Wagner's follow-up to Batman and the Monster Men.
