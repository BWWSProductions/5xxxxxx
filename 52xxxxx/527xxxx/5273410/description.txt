This took me about 4 hours to get right! I grabbed 2 versions, one version was good quality video but shit sound, and the other version was good ''Telesync'' sound but shit video quality!! So i've overdubbed the pair together to make a good version out of the 2 ;-)

I have included a sample as well in the torrent.






Enjoy!
