[T],TaurusKJ,2010-01-14T02:50Z,"Well now!  If the rest of the movie looks as good as the sample does, I would say that complements would be deserved!  I'm at 90% right now, I will be back with my thumbs up or down when completed......"

[T],TaurusKJ,2010-01-14T07:10Z,"Coming back to give Dave24v a big thumbs up for his work on this movie.  For a screener it looks great, it sounds great and everything seems to stay in sync through the entire thing. Exellent work, dude! Going to pop my popcorn right now and enjoy this. Thanks! : )"
,Dave24v,2010-01-14T14:00Z,"Glad this has finally got loads of seeders! I scanned the whole movie when editing the audio and everytime it went out of sync (about 9 times) I put it back, so the lips a all in sync thoughout the whole movie ;-) .... Hope you enjoy it ;-)"
