,orhank,2010-01-12T14:47Z,Why do we need to hack the registry for this? The preferences page gives you that option.
,maffiakillen,2010-01-12T16:01Z,"orhank! yes, in preferences, but it works just one time and when you clean your internet traces (cookies) you have to go to the preferences again and over again. The prefernces working on time (one shot). Do you think that I don't now. We don't hack, just config. The registry is i configuratin for windows, And we owns windows. Microsoft offer windows for us. So you don't hack, Orhank, just tweaking, and it don't hurt.
