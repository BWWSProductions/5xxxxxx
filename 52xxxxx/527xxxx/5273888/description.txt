 Live Aux Docks De Lausanne 09.03.2006

Amazing set in a pure Amon Tobin style. Deep hard trip-hop and d&b. I don't have the tracklist, but at least a half of the tracks are Amon Tobin's songs.

This material was released on the official website (http://www.amontobin.com/) for free. (I think)

Very nice session.
