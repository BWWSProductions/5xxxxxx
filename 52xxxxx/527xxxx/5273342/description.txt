This game is made with 3 goals in mind. Great playability, a high level of addictiveness and most of all, great fun. Run through 100 levels of action while using the bonuses and tricks you learn to aid you. Bonuses such as guns, lasers, glue, speedups, bombs, ice, dynamite, score multipliers, presents and extra lives are all available and the list doesn't end there! There are also bonus rounds, secrets to learn, great vocals and pretty graphics with cool effects and plenty of options to play with.

But whats new? Have you wondered what it would be like to actually be the ghost? Well now you can in the new Duel Mode! Up to 4 players can battle it out for supremacy while using all the above bonuses against each other. If you are out of the game, you become a ghost and can run round to get your revenge! Race your Poc to that powerpill, pinch that X from player 2 and drop bombs in their paths to reign supreme. Theres also teamplay too. Team up in a group of up to 3 players and help each other out on the way through the levels. And still theres more... You can also have team duels! 2 versus 2 mode can be great fun for the whole family.
