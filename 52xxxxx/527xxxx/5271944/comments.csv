,didii,2011-04-28T23:16Z,Won't work for me. First time it said: Your version of Windows is not Geniune or something and the next time it just shuts down without any warning..
,didii,2011-04-28T23:16Z,oh forgot: and if I disconnected from the internet it just said it couldn't find any updates and shuts down...
