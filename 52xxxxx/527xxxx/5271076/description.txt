                    Costume drama. A handsome young journalist,  
                    Daniel Parish, arrives in Lark Rise with  
                    exciting news for the Timmins family: Emma is  
                    set to inherit a fortune, enough to move the  
                    family to a big house in Candleford. Will the  
                    Timmins turn their backs on Lark Rise forever?  
                    Daniel plans to write their rags to riches  
                    story for his newspaper, but Dorcas is   
                    suspicious of his motives, and when the article  
                    is published, it sends shockwaves through the  
                    community.
