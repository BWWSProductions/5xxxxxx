The Hunter is the story of a man who hits New York head-on like a shotgun blast to the chest. Betrayed by the woman he loved and double-crossed by his partner in crime, Parker makes his way cross-country with only one thought burning in his mind - to coldly exact his revenge and reclaim what was taken from him! 

Adapted by Darwyn Cooke from the 1962 crime thriller novel.

The Hunter was written by Donald E. Westlake under the pseudonym Richard Stark. It was the basis for two feature films, John Boorman's Point Blank (1967), which starred Lee Marvin, and Payback (1999), starring Mel Gibson.  The novel was written as a stand-alone crime novel, but when Westlake turned it in, his editor told him that if Westlake would rewrite the ending so that Parker escaped, he would be willing to publish up to three books a year about Parker.  Though Westlake wasn't able to keep up that level of productivity, he did go on to write twenty-three more Parker novels over the next forty-six years.
