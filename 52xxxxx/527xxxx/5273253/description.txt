This one was recorded by Phil Tyrell at his house in Mandurah, West Australia. You can also hear his killer drumming on this track to.

The slide bass at the intro and the interlude was played by me as well. It's my favourite part of the whole song.

It's a self pity sort of song about feeling trapped by circumstance and enjoying the suffering that goes with it.

Hope you likes. Let me know what you think.
