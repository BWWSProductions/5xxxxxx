                    Haunted.                                 
                    Sci-fi drama series. Magnus and her team rescue  
                    the passengers and crew of a sinking ship off  
                    the coast of South Africa and teleport them  
                    back to the Sanctuary for medical treatment.  
                    But when one of the peaceful refugees is  
                    brutally murdered, all eyes turn to Druitt.  
                    Magnus is forced to use her stun gun to stop  
                    Druitt in his tracks and have him secured in a  
                    containment cell. But a sudden power surge  
                    locks all the doors in the Sanctuary, trapping  
                    Magnus alone with Druitt and his murderous  
                    instincts.
