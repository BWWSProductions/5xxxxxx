,aldot25,2010-01-14T14:57Z,pls seed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,sterlinglee38,2010-01-21T01:21Z,"I would love to d/l this, but there are no seeders. Atleast the person who uploaded it should be seeding, come on...."
,sterlinglee38,2010-01-30T05:20Z,"Ok, no more mister nice guy.... WTF? 95 leechers, have any of you actually gotten the whole file? Whoever uploaded this is a fuckin moron. Come on, fuckin seed this damn thing. I have a best friend frmo the states that is interviewed on this video. I would like to see it. I would buy the damn thing if I could find it here in small town Saskatchewan, Canada but can't find it anywhere. What's the point of putting up a torrent your not gonna even seed yourself."
,CapSl0w,2010-01-30T22:54Z,Why cant DYZAN59 at least finish 1 full upload? There are no seeders. 
,Ragehead,2010-02-19T07:08Z,seed seed seed
,CapSl0w,2010-02-21T20:06Z,I think we're all stuck at 99.9%
,aldot25,2010-02-23T11:13Z,why did it stop at 99.9%!?!?!?!?!?!?!
,aldot25,2010-02-23T11:15Z,pls seed becuz where i live (in Philippines) they don't have the dvd of the concert yet!!!
,muscle6161,2010-02-23T13:14Z,DYZAN59 where the hell r u man? come back and finish what u have started!!!! is there anyone out who knows this guy?
,CapSl0w,2010-02-23T15:17Z,"I think it is some kind of shitty joke because he originally seeded up until about 50% and then left it for weeks un-seeded. Then he returned and left us stuck here at 99.9%. 

I think I saw a 100% user at some point but they fucked off as soon as they finished and didnt continue to seed. I think once Dyzan completed one or two 100% uploads to be people he stopped seeding too. 

So because he and the others didnt stick around, we are fucked"
,slboo,2010-05-08T15:20Z,"ive managed to play this in vlc player, and there's no audio thru the hole concert! this is a bullshit upload!"
