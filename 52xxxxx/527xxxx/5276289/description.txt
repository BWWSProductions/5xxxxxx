Description:

The hugely popular live American television plays of the 1950s have become the stuff of legend. Combining elements of theater, radio, and filmmaking, they were produced at a moment when TV technology was growing more mobile and art was being made accessible to a newly suburban postwar demographic. These astonishingly choreographed, brilliantly acted, and socially progressive 'teleplays' constituted an artistic high for the medium, bringing Broadway-quality drama to all of America. The award-winning programs included in this box set -- originally curated for PBS in the early 1980s as the series The Golden Age of Television, featuring recollections from key cast and crew members -- were conceived by such up-and-comers as Rod Serling and John Frankenheimer and star the likes of Paul Newman, Mickey Rooney, Rod Steiger, Julie Harris, and Piper Laurie.
