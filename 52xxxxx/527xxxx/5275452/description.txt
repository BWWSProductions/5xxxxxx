A Marine recon sniper must rely on his training to save his wife and the terrified guests of a five star hotel when a group of heavily 
armed rebels besiege the luxury resort. Joe Linwood is a trained warrior, but he never expected he'd be doing battle on vacation. 
But that's just what happens when the hotel Joe and his wife are staying at is violently overtaken. The target: the hotel's billionaire 
owner. But they won't hesitate to kill anyone who threatens to derail their diabolical plan, including Joe's wife. Now, with precious little 
time to lose, Joe prepares to take on a small army of gun-toting thugs and rescue his wife before it's too late. ~ Jason Buchanan,

Rated PG-13 for brief strong language and some sensuality.
