www.comedy.org.uk Review: 
A clever idea for a show. It is rare that a comedy show involves so much participation from members of the public. In a way Genius is a bit like a talent show, but one for people who actually have talent and intelligence!

The series is certainly successful in the eyes of the BBC. They have now ordered a full series of the television version, although the radio version of Genius is continuing.

It should be noted that Genius is not always looked upon favourably by listeners. The last idea of the third series was to improve the Genius voting system. It was indeed changed in the following episode.
