Many software developers are using standard modeling languages with a model-driven development (MDD) process to improve productivity, quality, and communication. IBMÂ® RationalÂ® RhapsodyÂ® is a tool that you can use to communicate through interconnected diagrams that are based on UML and SysML. By using this software, you and your team members can identify design problems early, when they are the less costly to address.

Rational Rhapsody includes an integrated software development environment in which you can create, test, document, and deliver software applications for embedded or real-time applications. Rhapsody Version 7.5 includes these features:
A code-engineering workflow that integrates MDD into a project or code base by providing seamless code visualization, code generation updates to files, and makefile-guided reverse engineering and code visualization to flowcharts
Improved support for high-reliability and safety-critical software development by supporting MISRA-C:2004, Ada Ravenscar, Modeling and Analysis of Real Time Embedded systems (MARTE) profile, and by embedding requirements text directly in the generated code
Enhanced integration with IBMÂ® RationalÂ® Team Concert so that teams can collaborate in real time and support an agile configuration management workflow

You can also use Rhapsody to specify your systems and to extend systems engineering capabilities by using these features:
United Profile for MoDAF and DODAF (UPDM) support to specify DoDAF 1.5 or MODAF 1.2-compliant architectures in the standard format
Enhanced SysML 1.1 support and activity diagrams improvements to define the functional flow of a system
Improved integration with IBMÂ® RationalÂ® DOORSÂ® to ensure a seamless workflow and to automatically synchronize when requirements change in multiple locations
