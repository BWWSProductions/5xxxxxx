In case you consider doing a treatment, please consult the provided Videos and Literature and do extensive research and spend time thinking about this. THERE ARE DANGERS AND RISKS TO IBOGAINE TREATMENT, but they can be minimized if certain things are paid attention to. Do not treat yourself. Do your research. Do know what you are doing!
