This little 'app' is put together using Windows GUID strings to create shortcuts for all Win7 tasks/maintenance. Click on the folder and it contains all 
the shortcuts you need to maintain Windows7, with icons. And it's all in one easy to find place! 
This system is used extensively by computer engineers, as it's fast and easy way to access any of these:

Control Panel Tasks
Action Center
Backup and Restore
Biometric Devices
Credential Manager
Default Location
Devices and Printers
Display
HomeGroup
Location and Other Sensors
Notification Area Icons
Recovery
RemoteApp and Desktop Connections
Speech Recognition
Troubleshooting

For a screenshot, copy and paste this link into your web browser

The file takes seconds to download, is not a potentially dangerous exe file, and will not mess with your registry.
Save it to your desktop if you want to find it quickly, or save it to your documents and drag it onto the windows7 start button - it will integrate 
nicely into your start menu, and you always know where to find it!

You can personalise the file by right clicking on it and renaming it whatever you like.

Enjoy!

NB - this is the original torrent uploaded by myself. The app was put together by myself. Someone on the web known as 'ebookking' seems to be claiming this as there's - I have know way of knowing if they have messed around with the app, therefore, for safety's sake I would advise that you only download my original torrent. Thanks, tripefish.

NB - the use of GUIDs for shortcuts has recently become known as 'God Mode' on the web :O)


NB - the file is RAR'ed because it was the only way I could get the file 'My Personal CP' to upload *Puzzled*
