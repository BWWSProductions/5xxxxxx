Music composed, performed and produced by Johannes Schmoelling
except tracks 10, 11 + 12 (composed by Froese, Franke, Schmoelling, arr. Schmoelling)
between 1979 - 1985

What you will hear on EARLY BEGINNINGS are rough drafts and demo recordings, which were not originally meant for the public. Good friends encouraged me and helped me to publish this material. Except for tracks 4 and 5, the authentic original master- tapes can be heard, chronologically and digitally remastered.
