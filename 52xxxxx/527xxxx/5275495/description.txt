Source: XM

Desc: Zoltar, the Brother from Another Planet, takes you on an interplanetary sonic voyage through the dark recesses of your mind with the help of two hours of trance, progressive, and breaks beats. Zoltar brings the underground to you in Subterranean.

Notes: Bet Y'all having been missing your NFOs? Any, in Live Recorded Events (TV Shows, now Radio Shows), I omit them -- If you really want to read a Desc, you can look it up on imdb like I do; it all adds up to a faster release for you. This, however is a special occasion, 1st XM rip. Please respond with XM Shows you'd want to hear - Talk, DJ Mixes, whatever. At this point I am planning on doing Tiesto's Club Life, State of Trance, and Coast to Coast AM.
