[V],bob5695,2010-02-21T16:06Z,are you familiar with the xvid codec? i've used a quantizer of 2 for i-frames and p-frames and a quantizer of 4 for b-frames so the average quantizer sould be close to 3.25 - add to that the generous window size (720x304) and it becomes legitimate to expect excellent quality from this rip.
