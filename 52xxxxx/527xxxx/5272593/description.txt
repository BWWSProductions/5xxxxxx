GodMode is a Windows 7 feature, who basically is an extended control panel that allows you to control various aspects of the OS that are not typically surfaced via a GUI.

Here's how you enable it:

Create a new folder (right-click and click on "New Folder").
Right-click on the folder and click on rename, copy and paste this:


GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}

What comes up is a Control Panel like window with sections for Action Center, Administrative Tools, Device Manager, AutoPlay, etc.
