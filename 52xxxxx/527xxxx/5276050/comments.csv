,pdbechth,2010-01-23T02:57Z,"Not bad quality. I mean, video was probably 8.5/10  but the audio was subpar. it makes clooneys monotonous voice even more monotonous. 7/10? Not bad if you want to see it right now, but probably not a rip to save"
,g253,2010-02-14T18:22Z,"Audio is a bit muffled, but alright - you just need to turn up the volume. Video is quite good. Well worth the download till the dvd version is released."
