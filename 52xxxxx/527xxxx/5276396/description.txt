Proof #25 (MR)
By: Alex Grecian, Riley Rossmo

'AFTERMATH'
It's a year in the future and The Lodge has burned to the ground. Who's left alive after The Cryptid War? And what prowls the grounds of the habitat? Plus, the original Proof story in color for the first time ever, a huge pinup gallery, and plenty of extras.

Thanks to YZ1 for the scan... are there any scans BETTER than this one?!
