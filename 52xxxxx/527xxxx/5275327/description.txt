"Suscitatio" (PAL) <FINALE>

All A/V mixed by: /=Â®â‚¬<|//4Â§+Î», except for TiÃ«sto & Sneaky Sound System's "I will be here" - NTSC VERSION ONLY

Disc compilation and mastering by: NYP

Working title "r3sync 5.5/What ever happened to MTV?"

r3sync is djing and vjing while remixing. It has become my technique, my passion.

The audio mixing style is MAXIMAL. That's many trax mixed many ways...

This piece tells many stories from my life. The movements will take you through different forms of electronic music: House, Techno, Trance, Progressive, Electro-House, and even an a cappella. Some of the tracks are layered on top of each other (mashup or mixing?), and others stand solo.

Well I have used this video backdrop while I perform for over a year now. This mix is now formally retired, and I hope you enjoy it.- fr3qnast3

The original torrent is still circulating on Mininova and The Pirate bay. It has been over a year and it is still alive. Mininova counts over 12,000 downloads, and I wonder how many were completed on TPB? There were a few bugs in there I wanted to fix, so here we go...

The original version was created using DV for an (intermediate) editing codec. This resulted in color shifts, and a lot of jagged edges, especially with HOT colors. The resolution was 720x480i with a 29.97 frame rate. When I converted the video to pal, it was looking pretty bad.

For this remastered version, I used uncompressed 8bit video at 1280 x 720P, with 29.97 frames per second. Working in a larger intermediate format helps retain as much of the original format as possible, and allows for the creation of a higher quality master.

Most footage was SD, some was HD, and a small fraction was web resolution. It's hard to find good HD footage....

This version of the audio mix was from a gig last year. Most of the trax were from .wav files, except for a few which were not released in wav format, as those were .m4a. The output was 24bit 96khz (I use 24/96 audio when I play out:), but the final output was compressed to 16bit ac3.

This is the *PAL* edition. I preserved the video at a high rate and compressed the sound so that this will look crisp on projectors. There are no menus besides the opening screen. I think VJ's will like this one better because the video is progressive, and there are no menus other than the opening.

Instead of running a quick recode to PAL which involves lopping off frames, I chose a HI-Q render method that blends frames together. It took over 2 days on HI-Q render mode to get rid of the judder.

Finale output for main movie:
4.5mbps VBR (7.7 MAX)
720x576 25 FPS Progressive Video
126 BPM 448 kbps Dolby Digital Professional
French, English, and Mandarin Subtitles are BURNED IN.
An additional subtitle track has been added to the top of the screen to note the chapter names.
