Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns (1835-1921) 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-saens

Noticed some time ago that there is no version available on TPB (or indeed in several torrent indices), therefore I have uploaded this CD.  I did not rip this originally: it is one of the few that I have obtained - many years ago - solely from an online (lossless) source.

It is not the best recording of the work, but is perfectly respectable.
