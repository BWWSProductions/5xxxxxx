Here is the SCENE release for the DVDSCR quality of the movie â€œThe Fantastic Mr.Foxâ€, again released by FOXNEWS. I just saw that it was nuked because it was pred without sfv. Well dot said FOXNEWS might just rip off some P2P release. So you can check out the sample to decide if you want to grab it. Size is 1CD.

PLOT: It is the story of one Mr. Fox and his wild-ways of hen heckling, turkey taking and cider sipping, nocturnal, instinctive adventures. He has to put his wild days behind him and do what fathers do best: be responsible. He is too rebellious. He is too wild. He is going to try â€œjust one more raidâ€ on the three nastiest, meanest farmers that are Boggis, Bunce and Bean. It is a tale of crossing the line of family responsibilities and midnight adventure and the friendships and awakenings of this country life that is inhabited by Fantastic Mr. Fox and his friends.
