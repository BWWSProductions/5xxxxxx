Pure 80's EuroPop

These (101) songs we (me and 2 friends) decided were the best of the best.

(It wasn't an easy job, because of it's (too)easy 'much alike sounding' genre.

Dieter Bohlen was the key; producer, songwriter and frontman...

Genre-wise they were often classified under Europop.

Successful in Europe(espacially Eastern Europe), Asia, South America, Middle East,

particularly in Iran, where all Western pop music was banned after the 1979 Islamic

revolution, and also in several African countries. They were almost unknown in US, UK

& Canada but they did enter in UK the top-5 only once with the song "Brother Louie".

If you're not familiar with them I suggest you only download the songs bellow (and skip the rest),

see how you like them then can download all 101 songs if you liked them.

Born on the Wind ( C. C. Catch )

Every Day, Every Night ( Blue System )

Give Me Peace On Earth ( Modern talking)

I believe you are an Angel ( Blue System )

I can lose my heart tonight( C.C. Catch )

I'm no Rockefeller ( Modern Talking )

In 100 Years ( Modern talking )

Little By Little ( C. C. Catch )

Sorry little Sarah ( Blue System )

Stranded In The Middle Of Nowhere( Modern Talking )

Tears Won't Wash Away My Heartache ( C.C. Catch )


I'm afraid most Americans won't appreciate this music; 
they'd find it too soft & "POPcorn-ish", because of the background 'monotone' electronic beat & because  guitar is almost non-existing.

Nevertheless, to all who love it, enjoy it and make nice parties on it!

Peace & Love !

Those who were youngsters in the 80's will love this stuff ;-)

For best sound I suggest you set your equalizer like this:

and certainly not flat like this:

ps. It's not worth having the whole discography from them (apx 800 songs).

 Trust me, they'd bore you to death..
