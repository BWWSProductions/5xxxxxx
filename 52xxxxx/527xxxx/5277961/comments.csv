plays a segment twice.
not sure if something is missing but based on the total time minus the repeated segment im guessing something is definately missing"
,OldBosun,2010-01-14T12:06Z,"
Definitely screwed up. It repeats a segment of about 6 minutes some 28 minutes into the episode. 
Probably has that amount missing. I think we need a proper or a repack."
,Max Wilder,2010-02-02T09:23Z,"Definitely missing 1 segment in the middle. I compared it against Hulu. Seek this episode elsewhere.

This is the first time I've ever seen this kind of error. Someone must have been in a hurry."
