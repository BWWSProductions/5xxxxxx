Hello all this is my second attempt at uploading a torrent ...so please be patient if all the tech specs aren't available ..however I can assure you that this DVD is one that I personally ripped from my DVR I used a Panasonic dvd recorder  also used DVD decrypter to upload the VOB files ...... this is  YO MTV RAPS which was re ran by VH1 i think back in 04 or 06 I really can't recall the exact year... it is in stereo so the sound is great... if i were to rate the picture quality is an A- ... there are no commercials, no chapter menus...I only stopped after every video so you can skip btwn videos ... this is dedicated to all the old school heads on OSHH forum board ...COBALT 60
