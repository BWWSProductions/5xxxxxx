,WvBrsci,2010-08-15T04:45Z,"Thanks! Backlogged on my TV-slavery, catching up on NCIS, found that EZTV didn't have s07e12 (or s07e13), panicked, calmed down, searched TPB, found VTV, and that's always a good thing to find. I just love a happy ending, at least when I'm the main and only character in the story. So, again: Thanks!"
