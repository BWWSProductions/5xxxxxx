Even in Gotham City, October 31st is a night for trick-or-treating, a night when the ghosts come out to play. But on this Hallowe'en, two people will receive invitations to a very special party, tasked to spend a single night in the most horrifying haunted house imaginable. The guests are the Dark Knight and the Monstrous Midnight...and their host is the Joker!
