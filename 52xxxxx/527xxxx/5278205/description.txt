Just a screensaver from the FF-Models days (sets 311 to 337) made out of boredom. The pics were mostly randomly chosen. I'm including both the .scr file and the source .asw file for those who have ACDSee and don't trust .scr files. Might upload an update including the whole FF-Models period when I get bored again and decide to go through the earlier sets. Enjoy.
