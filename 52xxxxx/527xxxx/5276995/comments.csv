,kdavies9688,2010-01-14T00:47Z,What happened to the Stepfather and The Box?
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-14T02:27Z,a/v???
,knucklepunt,2010-01-14T06:18Z,"Watching now.  For an R5 w/ Line Audio it's actually quite good.  Definitely watchable.

V/9
A/6.5-7"
,knucklepunt,2010-01-14T06:24Z,"Actually, the audio quality does deteriorate somewhat further along.  So I would have to revise the audio rating to somewhere between 5-6.  Watchable for me, maybe not others.

Thanks for the up, SM."

GREAT MOVIE !!!!!"
,dlarrym,2010-01-25T21:06Z,"I like your contribution but I am curious why you re-encoded the audio with DOLBY DIGITAL SURROUND 5.2, but your source is stereo 2 channel sound. Its not going create out of nothing 8 channel surround if the source has only 2 channels. AAC is great for CD's and HI Fi Stereo, but doesn't support multi channel audio sources even if there was one included.... AC3 is what can use a multi channel surround source and keeps its integrity. I have yet to find a copy that is in surround sound of ANY kind. ANY type of surround sound be it DTS, THX, DOLBY DIGITAL 1 or 2, is far better then the best stereo (at least for a movie). If someone was able to rip a DVD or even a screener, it would have had the surround signal embedded in the file. I'll wait for an AC3 copy to come out... I did download this and the video is awesome, the audio... not so much? . Thanks for the effort. ANYONE whos willing to try to contribute is appreciated!"
,bigmoviefreak,2010-02-26T01:15Z,thanks for another perfect download i don't know if you got my other comment but can u get shutter island? thanks for the best movie down loads. keep up the good work and i'll keep coming back. thanks again
,rnsxypapa,2010-02-27T02:48Z,where is english subs? ya always good with this. but I need subs for english thanks
,octopus44,2010-04-16T19:17Z,Video quality is good. The audio is pretty bad (muffled and crackly).
