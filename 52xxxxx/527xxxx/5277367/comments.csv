Do yourself (and others) a favor and get a decent turntable and phono-pre before releasing this shit. "
[V],oneanight,2010-01-14T01:09Z,"So easy to criticize isn't it ]eep, HMVinyl isn't hiding anything everything is there to see..

HMVinyl don't be put off by someone that hasn't even contributed to the site.

And more than likely never will.."
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-14T01:33Z,"don't worry, the downloaders, outweigh the negative comments.

i am aware that my equipment isn't top-notch (theres really nothing wrong with the pre-amp, still sells for $400) and i intend to get another turntable.

thanks to everyone who seeds my rips :D"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-14T01:39Z,and i rip in 16/48 just to make things easy.
,]eep,2010-01-14T16:50Z,"I am sorry if you think I am criticising. It's just I don't see the point in taking all this effort when there is already a much better cd-rip on FLAC. 

I like vinyl better than CD, but then I have been upgrading my turntable for 25 years. I know not everyone has the same quality rig. 
But HMVinyl, bad rips like this aren't going to make a lot of converts for vinyl.  

However much i appreciate the effort, the result is still shit. Try and look for a decent turntable (like Pro-ject makes at a decent price) and once you hear the difference you'll know what I mean.

,]eep,2010-01-14T17:18Z,"Oh and another thing, I am not going to contribute (other than helping with feedback) like vinyl rips. First because I've tried to record vinyl, heard other flac's at 24/96 but they are ALLWAYS worse than the original LP or CD. 

LP is the best copy protection the record industry ever had!"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-14T18:38Z,"i mostly do this because i've got 100's of LPs, and i want to do something with them, i really want to get a pro-ject. the problem is, theres only one dealer in town, and they range from 500-4000 and i'm not all that ready to spend that kinda scratch, just make my torrents sound better :-| but.. when i eventually do get one, i intend to re-rip the most seeded torrents on my list :D so pick a favorite :P"
,pezed,2011-08-15T18:35Z,"I noticed that the channels are switched. You can easily hear it on ""Helpless Dancer"". I have this album but I have not had a turntable for some time now. I checked it against the MFS upload and other Flac uploads. I like your uploads. Thank You."
