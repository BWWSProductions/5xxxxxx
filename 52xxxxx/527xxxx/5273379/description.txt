"From out of the West...Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre!"
                   
                  Another necessary library addition for lovers of vintage TV 
                  Westerns and dramas. VCI Entertainment has released Dick 
                  Powell's Zane Grey Theatre: Complete Season One, a four-disc, 
                  29-episode collection of the first 1956-1957 season of this 
                  well-remembered CBS hit. Jumping right in when the Western 
                  "grew up" on television, Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre 
                  offered a weekly dramatic anthology format set in the Old West 
                  that featured a cornucopia of established stars and promising 
                  up-and-comers enacting these trim, tight little 
                  black-and-white morality tales. VCI has done a great job 
                  restoring this series (as best it could, I would imagine), 
                  while offering a few interesting extras, as well.
                  The format of Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre was not at all 
                  unlike other dramatic anthology series on television at that 
                  time - it only differed in that the settings for the various 
                  stories were set about seventy years back in time. Actor and 
                  producer-powerhouse Dick Powell would introduce each episode, 
                  usually offering up some interesting Western folklore or 
                  demonstrating the uses of various Old West tools and firearms 
                  - along with some marvelously loose jokes and kids about that 
                  era - before the individual episode would begin. Powell would 
                  also show up occasionally as the star of an episode (as did 
                  Four Star Production partner David Niven, as well as frequent 
                  star and director, Ida Lupino), but mainly he served as host 
                  for these speedy, concise little playlettes, featuring at the 
                  very least one name actor (or an actor soon to be a name on 
                  television or the movies) in the episode's lead role.
