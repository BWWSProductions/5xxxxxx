Other notes:

The tools I used to create this video were Fraps, a screen recording software, and Adobe Premiere, a video editing software.

The purpose of this video is to entertain, not brag about pvp prowess.  I do not claim to be the best pvper on na-1.  I hope you enjoy this video, for it took some time to edit and throw together.
