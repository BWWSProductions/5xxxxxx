Hello All! Hey I have the last twenty four broadcasts of C2C for you all. I'm sure you all already have the shows, but I decided to upload this torrent anyway. Life is getting more and more hectic and my computer life has been on the backburner for a while now. I hope you all enjoy the torrents. I believe the days of Stokeman torrents are becoming part of the past. I hope to keep uploading, but I guess I will see what life hands me. We are all on our own path and if it is meant to be then I guess it will be. Download, SEED, and Enjoy! Thanks as always to those who continue to download and Seed these torrents. Long live C2C.... Stokeman Out......
