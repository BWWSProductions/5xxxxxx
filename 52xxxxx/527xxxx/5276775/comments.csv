,fffd,2010-01-14T04:07Z,Any idea where to find english subtitles?
,Equivocator,2010-01-14T11:12Z,"I searched for what seemed like ages (to someone with my attention span at least!) but I failed to find any English Subtitles. Are they out there!?

980 Seeders and almost 2k leeches surely someone among them has found English subtitles?"
[V],DaSoChaShan,2010-01-14T14:10Z,"Most of seeders or leeches, They are all Chinese."
,fffd,2010-01-14T19:30Z,Too bad for us international customers who love your upload.. ;)
,wizayne,2010-01-15T02:02Z,"next thing we know the top 100 list will be taken over by chinese torrents, just like it's been half taken by spanish torrents. in the last few months it's been spanish this and spanish that.. now look, everyone has to watch movies but ugh, it cuts the list that's useful to me in half.
soon ch1na will take 30% of that just like they are taking over manufacturing and the spanish are taking the american jobs!"
,Equivocator,2010-01-15T09:13Z,"They can take all the American jobs they want, wont effect me in Australia! :p

Thanks for the up DaSoChaShan, but I fear I wont enjoy the movie since I wont be able to understand what's going on :(

This is a site for everyone so I think it's a good thing that everyone is getting something they can enjoy, keep up the good work!"
,Aces77,2010-01-15T18:41Z,"yup to bad ... if only you can rip the english subtitle ... that would be awesome .... 
I'm chinese ... but an english subtitle was more fun to enjoy the movie ... cause it can improve my english ... ^  ^ thx DaSoChaShan..."
,CheebaNick,2010-01-16T03:26Z,"I normally dont comment on things im not downloading... 
but why hate and be racist in this comment section? English is not the ONLY language.... Chinese people or whatever people can have movies in there language too.  In fact this site isnt based out of USA so....
Before you go saying im chinese /spanish/ w/e i live in the USA as well and you are making us look bad. Shame on you."
,vector1818,2010-01-16T17:06Z,hee chaw ching chang you love me long time
,Aces77,2010-01-16T22:14Z,"@CheebaNick: wow you got it wrong here mate, this was not about racist thing but i'm talking about language, if someone came to you and speak with a language you didn't understand, you will told that person to speak in english right ? or at least try to speak a language that you understand. So it's not RACIST.
@vector1818: Thanks for the joke ... "
,Equivocator,2010-01-17T13:33Z,Aces: CheebaNick was probably referring to wizayne's comments.
