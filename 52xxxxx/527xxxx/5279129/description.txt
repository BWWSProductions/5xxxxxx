The Feelies are a rock band from Haledon, New Jersey. They formed in 1976 and disbanded in 1992 after having released four albums. The band reunited in 2008.

The Feelies rarely worked with outside producers and created shimmering soundscapes with multiple guitar layers that set them apart from most of the punk/new wave bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s. They frequently played at Maxwell's, a live music venue and bar restaurant in Hoboken during the 1980s, often on national holidays.

Although the Feelies never sold a great number of records, their influence was felt on the indie rock scene. Their first album, Crazy Rhythms (Stiff Records, 1980) was cited by R.E.M. as a major influence.Several bands have in turn influenced the Feelies, including The Velvet Underground and Lou Reed. The novelist Rick Moody has also cited the band as one of his influences.

The band's name is taken from a fictional entertainment device described in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World.

In 1988, the Feelies signed to a major label and released the album Only Life on A&M Records. The lineup was the same as The Good Earth, and Mercer and Million again handled production duties. The disc was a critical favorite, coming in at #27 on the Village Voice's 1988 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, beating out such noteworthy competition as R.E.M.'s major-label debut, Green, as well as the debut efforts by Jane's Addiction and the Sugarcubes. Recently, the album's title track has been used as the introductory music for the Harvard Business Review's HBR Idea Cast.
