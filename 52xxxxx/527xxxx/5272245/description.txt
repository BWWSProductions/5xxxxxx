In this modern update of the classic Steve McQueen western television series, 
Hauer plays Nick Randall, a former CIA man turned bounty hunter who becomes 
the bait in an FBI-CIA conspiracy and finds himself pursued by an international 
terrorist who pushes him to the limit of survival. It seems that Nick and the terrorist, 
Malak Al Rahim, are linked by the past, and the two embark on a deadly cat-and-mouse 
game that only one man can win. Of note, Hauer's character is mentioned as being the 
great-grandson of McQueen's character in the original series. 


The famous ending had Randall bringing out Rahim handcuffed with a grenade 
jammed in his mouth while Randall is holding the pin. Randall explains to his 
bosses that they should send his payment to the family of Danny Quintz and he'll 
just keep the extra bonus for bringing him in alive. As he starts to leave, 
he says, "F**k the bonus" and pulls the grenade pin out 


Tagline: Nick Randall is a loner. A legend. A bounty hunter. 
He's the best there is at a job he hates.
