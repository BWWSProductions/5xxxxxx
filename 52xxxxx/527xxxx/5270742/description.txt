      The Semi-Final. Gordon's nationwide search for The F Word's
      Best Local Restaurant is hotting up. This episode features the
      first semi-final. The Best British restaurant The Pheasant and
      best Thai restaurant Simply Thai, as well as the winner of the
      Rest of the World category, will be giving their all, competing
      for the chance to cook in the grand final at the F Word
      restaurant. Over the course of an action-packed hour of
      mouth-watering entertainment, Gordon puts the restaurants
      through a gruelling series of tests to determine who's really
      got what it takes to hit the big time in the restaurant world.
      The chefs are pushed to breaking point as plate after plate of
      delicious food is ruthlessly scrutinised as Gordon must decide
      which should be the first of the three restaurants to be
      eliminated.
