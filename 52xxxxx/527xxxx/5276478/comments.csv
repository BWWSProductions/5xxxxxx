[V],twentyforty,2010-01-13T15:42Z,"@htctouch: Yes, I have seen Saw 6 as BDrip this morning. But, immediately after many small-sized re-encoding and rips have arrived on www.
Considering that I have managed to watch Saw 6 few months ago, I am quite positive that I'll pass this one. Saw should ended after Two incarnations, that's what I think. I have done TS of ""Goats""  and this wasn't anyone's cup of tea. To me it was a movie understandable only to specific audience and not just a ""magnet"" for  Clooney fans.
I'll pass that too, especially regarding how many things I already have finished and on waiting list.
Sorry."
