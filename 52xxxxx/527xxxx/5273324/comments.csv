[T],GWpirateGW,2010-07-13T03:29Z,"seems the leechers quit seeding, ill check my torrent box and see if I have the file still, and if so ill seed a bit more, greedy fuckers =D"

,Carnage_Rampage,2010-09-12T10:28Z,"Why your installation all personal? lol  Not working for me though.  Clicked the setup for Vista, went through everything, then clicked on the app once it was done: nothing.  Nothing pops up at all.   Not sure what I could've done wrong; or if it isn't me at all and is just the file(s).  I see no one has posted that it's good to go, but then again could just not be that popular.  Inform on what could be the problem?  I'll get back to you with responses as soon as I can.  Until then, gonna have to delete.  :(

Also, your tutorial on installing it isn't on your new tube account."
