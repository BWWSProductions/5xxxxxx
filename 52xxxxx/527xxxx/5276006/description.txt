Luke's Top 60 of 2009

Another year.. another top 60 and this year was a little tougher than the pervious years.. I thought it was going to be easier.. the short list was around 150 songs and was very hard to get it down to 60.

This year there is a tribute to the greatest ever performer. 

Once again it is in reverse order so it will count down.

Happy listening and till next year
