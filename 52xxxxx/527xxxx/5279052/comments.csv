I already wasted 1 dvd and my second download that clearly said RF was still region lock to PAL. I hope this one is NTSC as stated"
,Valmarith,2010-01-17T11:37Z,Is the PC version of the North American release out yet?
,xaris13,2010-01-17T19:06Z,this isn't region free?i've heard that the activation disk cancels the region lock too..would i be able to run it on a PAL console that way?
,venom800tt,2010-01-20T00:08Z,"@ xaris13

No you cant play PAL games on NTSC console even if you use activation disk, i already tried it. Im zipping the file now, will repot back if this game works or not"
