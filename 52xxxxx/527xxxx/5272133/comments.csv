,NeroKillA,2012-06-18T10:42Z,"Works perfectly

Thanks!!!! :)

1.Extract the .rar file, when it asks for the password go to the .txt file and copy the password that starts with 'www.'.
2.install fruity loops.
3. run fruity loops.
4. close fruity loops
5. go to the xxl file and either click on it then click on 'merge' which should be at the top of the windows explorer page or just right click it and go to merge. 
6. Run fruity loops

hope this helps anyone having trouble."
