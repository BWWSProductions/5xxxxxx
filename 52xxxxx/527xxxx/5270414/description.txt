An example of the rather rare Western-noir genre, this movie stars Robert Mitchum and Teresa Wright. Dean Jagger also plays. It is directed by Raoul Walsh, who made many noirs and westerns of the more conventional variety.

Edited by Christian Nyby, who later got the directing credit (probably assisted by producer Howard Hawks) for The Thing from Another World, a great classic horror flick available at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3565785/The_Thing_from_Another_World_[1951]
