This is the 7.0 installer with a crack and update for 7.8. Follow the steps in the readme, fairly simple, can't really get lost. No hidden malware etc with this copy, 100% clean, and its the current version as well only available to the paying members, no serials needed! 

Please help seed, this was a rough to get, let alone a clean version, that could be updated without the viruses etc from the other releases being tied up in it as well. Trust me i saw the other releases, those were pretty nasty from what i see. If you get stuck, ill answer the questions. Verified working on XP Pro 32 Bit, haven't tested on anything higher yet.
