This is for anyone who has already downloaded my Fringe encode of S01E21 (also wrongly known as S02E11)

The original 720p MKV by IMMERSE has a bad cut at the 33min 37sec mark and you lose a second or two of the scene. That bad cut sadly messed up my usual re-encode and the audio is slightly out of sync after that point.

If you keep these rips, have already downloaded the show and want a fixed version, then download this fix.

It includes everything you need to fix it, with instructions and even DDLs (direct download links) for the 80MB audio file!

OTHERWISE: If you haven't already downloaded the show rip, I will be releasing a REPACK (groan...lol) shortly.

Sorry for the inconvenience,
Teslaman
