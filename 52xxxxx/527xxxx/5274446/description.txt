Tom Noonan - What Happened Was ... (1994)

LANGUAGE: English
SUBTITLES: None

SYNOPSIS: The first date is not a coming of age ritual. It is not a step in a relationship. It is not a beginning. It is a period of immense awkwardness and trepidation that, no matter what excuse one makes to work around the first date atmosphere, will still exist. However, in case you decide you wish to volley for the worst first date award (which is tantamount to the Old Woman claiming the worst life in Candide), you should first pick up the film What Happened Wasâ€¦ - James Brundage, filmcritic.com
