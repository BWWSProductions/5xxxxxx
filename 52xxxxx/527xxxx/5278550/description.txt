Kytice is a series of 7 short films thematically linked and based on a series of ballads written 200 years ago by KJ Erbena, regarded by some as the Czech equivalent of William Shakespeare. They are famous folk-stories and fairy tales, well-known to anyone in the Czech Republic. Adapting them to the big screen was therefore always going to be quite a challenge for a film-maker brave enough to take them on.

F. A. Brabec, with a strong background in cinematography and directing, is the director who has chosen to adapt the ballads for the screen and he plays it safe with Kytice. All of the tales are superbly crafted, sumptuously photographed, meticulously lit and almost devoid of any real emotion or meaning â€“ but then we are dealing with fairy tales here. Of the 13 ballads composed by KJ Erbena, 7 have been chosen for adaptation to film. They feature many of the staples of the genre â€“ cautionary tales with witches, wicked step-mothers and princes looking for brides. There is a fair amount of horror in the stories but nothing too terrifying.
