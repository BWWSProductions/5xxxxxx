,Crucio117,2010-01-13T22:32Z,Agreed. Best compilation!
,Tomato9876,2010-02-13T02:43Z,"This torrent is sorted better than the other, but all of the episodes in the other torrent are either the same, or better quality. I just downloaded both, and this one has cheap 452x320 TVRip letterboxed crappy files for some, whereas the other has 624x352 for the SAME EPISODE. 

GET THE OTHER TORRENT INSTEAD!!"
,omidchini,2010-02-20T22:06Z,"agreed on the quality, some are not superb. though the other one does not have enough seeders, or crappy ones!"
,aje14700,2010-06-09T20:34Z,"very good overall. i used handbrake to encode them so i can play them with itunes. the only thing, you forgot over half of episode 6. the half you have in the season 6 is rlly part of season 5. so rlly there r only 6 episode included with the ""season 6"""
,tzhirien,2010-07-07T04:23Z,amazingly good seed.... 10/10
,Pat0540,2010-12-20T06:15Z,I pray to god that you are all seeding for me.

,mnom,2011-01-11T14:26Z,Please seed all who are downloading and have finished downloading. this is a treasure. Dont let it die. plz plz plz....
,heisenberg737,2011-01-27T22:06Z,"hey guys...
for whatever reason vuze shows 0 seeders and leechers, logically with a 0B/s DL-rate and no change is seen after 24 hours. there are no other torrents running atm, and this problem has never ocurred to me with any torrent ever before, however, it does seem to include the individual season torrents from 1-5.
does anyone have an idea how to fix this issue, i'm desperate to see those seasons."
,autoclave,2011-02-04T23:16Z,"Just started downloading this one. Superb upload. Good job, seeders! S:P ratio = 120:660 which is a bit bad. I'm going to seed this for a couple of months at least with 10/10 Mbit."
,heisenberg737,2011-02-17T22:30Z,"by now it's finished, it just took like a week or so ^^
good upload, thx
there are some problems keeping me from calling it great
the most obvious is that a stunning 14 episodes from season 6 are missing, so I DL'ed those from the season 6 720p torrent.
the other thon is in season 4, the first ""crimes an myth-demeanors"" is missing, with a copy of the second one in it's place
anyway thx for the upload, collecting all those episodes from other sources would have been a huge pain in the ass"
,acenoise,2011-06-03T02:09Z,"I am only getting 10k/bs DL ive been waiting days! i know good things come to those who wait but please someone seed im only downloading 3 episodes at a time due to download caps by my provider and i will re-seed those 3 episodes back , then next month get another 3 and repeat till finished :P"
,acenoise,2011-06-03T02:10Z,"I love this show!, and if u like it you may also like scrapheap challenge"
,I-tem,2011-06-08T09:29Z,"Nice torrent, but agreed, quality could have been better. I started downloading yesterday and I have uploaded 160GBs.. I won't stop... "
,voodoo797,2011-08-02T16:58Z,please seed i am at 5 kbs on a fios connection
