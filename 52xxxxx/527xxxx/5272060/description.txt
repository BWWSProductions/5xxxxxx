ENGINEERING VOLCANOES

Volcanoes can kill thousands, destroy entire cities, and change the global climate. But for all our fascination with these monsters of nature, we still can't control them. This daring one-hour special explores the mysterious inner workings of volcanoes to see just how they do their damage. Discover how scientists are learning to predict the timing and severity of eruptions to give residents in close proximity enough time to escape when volcanoes blow.
