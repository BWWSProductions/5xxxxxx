,JordoK,2010-01-12T05:25Z,"Usually when you upload a torrent (especially one that is only 11.59 megs) you should seed it until at least one or two other people have downloaded it, to keep the torrent alive somewhat, without these dead patches."
,mumboy,2010-01-13T03:06Z,Yeah. Seed please.
,labourfix,2010-01-13T04:13Z,still needs seed. there are like 8 people stuck at 8.6 %
,Darklord1990,2010-01-14T10:10Z,Sad that nobody wants to seed. :(
,courtesy,2010-01-17T04:25Z,After searching for awhile I managed to find games and emulator separately and could therefore seed to 100% :)
,tbp097663,2010-01-17T07:36Z,it doesnt work
,Turpitude,2010-01-17T08:59Z,"ya, im havin the same problem......no matter how many times u click anythin nothin happens.....i dont know what im missin...."
,Turpitude,2010-01-17T09:09Z,"figured her out, the emulator was bunk, at least for me....i just typed in kigb in google and one of the first things that came up was a free download, playing as we speak"
,hammy420,2010-01-19T04:18Z,seed plz!!!
,hammy420,2010-01-19T04:56Z,googled and dled kigb like terpitude said and works perfect. 
,phantomshadowxv,2010-01-30T20:21Z,It really works? Being honest I don't think all the information of a GBC game can be only 11.59MB
,zh_boy_1896,2010-03-06T19:17Z,seed pls
,randomoutburst,2010-05-03T18:59Z,"Sorry guys, my laptop crapped out on me and I had to get a new one, so I no longer have this file, hence the lack of seeding.  Will upload again once I can recover my files off the old laptop!"
,qussay86,2011-01-24T11:03Z,"The Emulator is KiGB you can get it from here:
