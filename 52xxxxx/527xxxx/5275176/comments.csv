Not downloading this torrent myself as I already possess the music. But a suggestions, if I may, for your future torrents?

Make the file names in your torrents nice and descriptive.  

So, instead of ""23185457.jpeg"", call it perhaps ""cover.jpg""? 
And instead of ""1-Cliburn-Tchaikovsky1.mp3"", perhaps ""01 Cliburn -Tchaikovsky - Piano Concerto 1 - 1 Allegro non troppo"".

Why? Because aside from making it easier for those who download to find bits in their collection, people are less unlikely to rename files themselves.  If they DO rename themselves, they can no longer (easily) act as a seed for your torrent. 

Good luck ^^"
