Is it also possible that you could ask the PS3 Team if any of them have Blade 3 Trinity (it is out on Blu-Ray)

Cheers mate and its much appreciated the work you and the PS3 Team put in on these 1080p rips"
[T],bricktophd,2010-01-15T00:20Z,i have blade 3 but i still have a few more star trek movies til i start uploading it.

Also, is there anyway you guys can get word out to swordhd that no one is seeding his zombieland file? everyone's stuck at 84%,  I'll seed it for a month at least 12 hours a day if i can get the full file."

Awesome mate that will complete the Blade trilogy, which i think will make a lot of people happy.

I understand you have other commitments regarding what you upload, as you are all part of a team.

Its just good to know that it is available and will be released at some stage.

For me the PS3 Team tag has become a designer label, in regards to the top quality you know you are getting when you download that particular named torrent

Awesome work the PS3 Team is doing. "
