,SnapperNZ,2010-01-23T17:25Z,"Can anyone tell me if the subs are hard-coded in to the video?  It would seem so as there are no srt files, but it would be good to know for sure before downloading."
,SnapperNZ,2010-01-24T17:54Z,I've downloaded a single VOB and it looks like it's English audio and no hard subs - just so y'all know.
,NeXttime2,2010-05-20T13:22Z,thanks! awesome!!!
,honeyman_1989,2010-07-04T19:25Z,"Thanks for this great post ,, For all who don't know , you have to run it as a dvd video disc through re-encoding them in Nero Recode and then burning and playing or playing them in a virtual DVD Prog and Player"
,dielaughing,2011-06-24T23:42Z,"Hello all, I re-encoded these to a WoW size of just 400MB per DVD, so that's 12x400MB=5.45GB & 27:42:40 total running time. And the quality wasn't sacrificed one bit. Resolution is: 640x480 and audio is: mp3@192VBR48KHz .. so for those of you who aren't interested in downloading over 50 gigs, come and download my All English torrent, no subtitles, just a reasonable size for 12 DVD's, a MAJOR space saver!!! I'll up them here in just a second. I included the Dutch DVD Covers and Labels because I couldn't find them in English, but other than that, this is entirely English and no subs like I said. A HUGE Thanks to the uploader.. you donated a fantastic find here.. I just had to make a more economical version for the people who would rather prefer a small XVID version, for hard drive storage only, 'cause even thinking about backing up the 4000+ science episodes within my library just sounds like a mad fairy tale... Blu-Ray maybe, but for now it's Hard Drive after Hard drive, Terabyte for Terabyte on up to God-Storage Capacity, the Petabyte and beyond>a little somethin' like this: Byte Â· Kilobyte Â· Megabyte Â· Gigabyte Â· Terabyte Â· Petabyte Â· Exabyte Â· Zettabyte Â· Yottabyte"
