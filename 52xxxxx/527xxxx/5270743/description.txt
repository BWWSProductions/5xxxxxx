      The Semi-Final. Gordon's nationwide search for The F Word's
      Best Local Restaurant hots up with the second semi-final.
      Tonight the Best British restaurant The Pheasant and best Thai
      restaurant Simply Thai are joined by Greek Retsina. Gordon puts
      the restaurants through a gruelling series of tests to determine
      who's really got what it takes to hit the big time in the
      restaurant world. Then Gordon descends on the two remaining
      restaurants with a coach full of demanding diners. Finally, he
      throws the restaurants into the toughest culinary environment of
      all, inviting them to his flagship three-Michelin-starred
      restaurant, Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea, to cook the dish of
      their lives for a group of specially invited guests. Ego, pride
      and reputation: for the chefs, owners and their friends and
      family, everything is on the line.
