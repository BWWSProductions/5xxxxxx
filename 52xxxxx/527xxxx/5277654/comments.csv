For some reason I can never connect to you while you are the only seeder. Not sure why, I've tried to work it out, no luck.  That aside, I just shoved a monster hard drive into my system, and I'm gonna put it to use.  In the hopes of smoothing your ruffled feathers and not seeing you chased off from your work entirely, I've got me a plan.  I'm gonna start downloading everything you put up, regardless of whether or not I watch it. I'm gonna do it early and seed it all to 5x (or better from a case to case basis if there seems to be a need).  This is more or less what I've always done with what I grab from you, but PirateBay seems to much more populated by bottomfeeders than was our previous rendez-vous point, and as a result I've seen you get angrier and angrier. So now, I'll download it all and seed it all and try and pick some of these other vultures slack in an effort to remind you that some of us have much love."
,w-mute78,2010-01-14T01:38Z,"All that being said, I cannot seed a full 24 hours a day. But i do average about 15-18 hours. So, my bad if you catch the six hours I'm off."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-14T08:39Z,"@w-mute78: Oh my friend, unfortunately, you're not the only one who cannot connect directly to me. Many of the people from name-not-to-be-spoken can't, and only thing that helps is to let me know IP address and I manually find where bottleneck is and, if I can, let one through.

I still have no clue about, but I have noticed the increase of unconnected peers, but cannot see who they are nor know the reason. Only things that ""works"" so far have been; to drop here one's IP (if it's dynamic and CAN be changed afterward), to do the same by dropping here some provisory, secondary mail where I can contact them and to avoid proxies and to use newer uTorrent.
As the newest, one can e-mail me by searching for me on Facebook and doing the same there (D. Twentyforty).
I felt that we (my friends and ""Regulars"") need ""second line of communication"" to eventually resolve some issues in more private manner.
So, your support is welcomed, desperately needed, but, I think that any resurrection of dead and unpopular torrents is a waste (I never succeeded in that) and should be done only on requests... We should concentrate on contemporary torrents, and movies are the bottleneck by nature, and I need help with movie-torrents more than on TV shows.
Thank you."
