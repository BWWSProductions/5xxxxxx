,sami4969,2010-01-16T02:57Z,Wow! Can't wait...Thanks!
,sami4969,2010-01-18T15:55Z,"Hello...I downloaded and watched episode 1, but the audio isn't in sync with the video...how can I fix this? Thanks for any help you can give...btw, the video is crisp..."
[V],rambam1776,2010-01-19T02:51Z,"If you watch this using VLC, it should be fine (it is for me), but VLC also allows you to adjust sync, so try that."
,sami4969,2010-01-19T17:37Z,"I tried VLC but the video is all screwed up...tried tinkering with the tabs and all but nothing worked. Regarding the problem with the audio not being in sync with the video; I had tried WMP, QuickTimePlayer, and CyberlinkPowerDVD, but they all gave the same problem. Thanks for the suggestion just the same...any additional advice would be most helpful."
,reetside,2010-01-28T08:51Z,"i use a program called ""super video converter"" to move all the 720p mkv format crap that has been appearing lately into a reasonable size xvid avi format. it works pretty nicely once you learn how to set the audio & video bitrates and aspect ratio, and width x height and FPS correctly. it works great and its freeware. here is a hint, use VLC to get all the ""codec information page"" then just shrink the width to 640, figure out an appropriate aspect ratio, calculate an approximation of height, then put bitrate at 1000-1200 and 96 kbps audio and you'll end up with something pretty close to a scene release."

Hello...I tried the ""Super Video Converter"" as advised and it did work...to a degree...yes, more or less the audio and video were in sync but the quality of the video was sacrificed...probably the same convert test results as with rambam1776...I'll try more tweaking here and there. Anyway, thanks guys for the advice."
[V],rambam1776,2010-02-02T09:19Z,"I have to admit I'm the last guy to come to with technical questions. I wish that the folks who (for some reason) seem to be in love with hated formats like mkv and flac would knock it off. What really blows is that often the stuff they release is the only torrented version. For example, if there is a version of this AFL series in avi or mpeg, I can't find it. At least FLAC is easy to convert to something people can use."
,sami4969,2010-03-05T15:30Z,"Well...I did a little research and I guess it's my laptop that's causing the screw ups...it seems it's too slow to process big HD videos of a certain format...not a techie myself, but it's something like that...oh well...enjoyed the series nevertheless..."
