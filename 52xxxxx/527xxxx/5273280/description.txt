                    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1020885/

One instance where the title says it all, Lesbian Vampire Killers finds screenwriters Stewart Williams and Paul Hupfield and director Phil Claydon plunging headfirst into guilty pleasure territory with an unrestrained, sex-laden horror comedy. The picture stars Mathew Horne and James Corden of the UK series Gavin and Stacey as (respectively) Jimmy and Fletch, two buddies who wind up in a British village with dozens of women caught up in a Sapphic vampire curse - driven by a lust for each other's bodies and an insatiable craving for human blood.
