But when I started playing I remembered this game is old and doesn't have the option to save state at any time you want, this game is hard in many parts, so it's kind of boring for me. So if you want to play it and save state whenever you want, I recommend emulating its iso on a PSOne emulator, like epsxe 1.70. It's not hard to find these downloads. Good luck!"
