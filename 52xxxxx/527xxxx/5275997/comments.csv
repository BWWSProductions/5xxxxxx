""Sharing is Caring"" bro, so take your insults with you on your way back to the ""shit pit"" you crawled out of !"

,drchohan,2010-02-17T22:51Z,"Excellent Work!

,gudgunnar,2011-03-18T18:04Z,"does anyone got the updated version? 
by the way awesome upload"
,skloon,2011-03-24T01:03Z,"Ok I am a bit of a luddite, but I can't get this to open/work, it tries to burn the files to a CD but they are too big, Nero won't let me change the media type to dvd"
,dielaughing,2011-06-11T05:30Z,"I can't believe nobody has posted any useful helpful information about the contents of this torrent. Whats frustrating me is DVD Shrink won't work, 'cause apparently this isn't a dvd..? And watching one of the Bin or Cue files in VLC won't work, neither will Daemon Tools for some odd reason, but thats my PC having a problem with a debugger or w/e. And then there is the simple fact that I don't have any dual layered DVD's.. and I don't even know (by loking at the sparse instructions left by the uploader, and ZERO helpful comments) that if I actually make a trip to Office Depot to get the 8.5GB dvd's that it'll actually work.. and what will it be anyway? Magazines? This isn't video? Never heard of a ISO, er, Bin & Cue that looks like an ISO that isn't video.. I downloaded this but it's starting to feel like a 50 gigabyte lemon to me. MORE useful comments, please. I'll try Google to figure this out, but I'm not left with much to go on, because everything seems to conflict with everything I know about multimedia on a home PC using Windows 7. (and this is under TV shows.. ?) "
,dielaughing,2011-06-11T08:52Z,"...and when I load this into an app called: 'IMG burn' under one of the identifying details: Imp ID: Apple Computer Inc. ... so I'm left to wonder, how does all of this fit? I have no use for or interest in Macintosh or ANY Apple platform, so, if thats what this is, sooo lame! How can it be used on Windows? Can it be converted for use somehow on Windows? "

That's because those aren't video discs but data discs. Use Daemon Tools or any other virtual disk software, mount DVD 1, install the application (~300 MB) - if you don't have AutoRun enabled just browse first DVD which you must mount and start setup from there - and there just mount needed DVD which cover your desired period of study.

Easy as pie.

P.S.: I know that VLC seems to ""see"" .cue .bin discs as video files but don't trust it. Trust me. :)"
,dielaughing,2011-06-11T09:20Z,"ANYONE needing further explanation follow this link.. (sorry, TPB won't allow it)
...as for me, I'm not interested. these will sadly get the recycle bin. I'm a Video Only collector. And, BTW, there is a REALLY good Nat. Geo. Video collection torrent on Demonoid.. here is that link as well: (sorry, TPB won't allow it)
and the contents of that torrent are spectacular! Will definitely recycle this torrent and replace it with the one which I'm now talking about!!!
National Geographic - 100 Years (list is too long for TPB to accept w/o a database error.. there is over 100 700MB XVID's tho)"
,benbritbaao,2011-07-16T13:10Z,thanks for the share. dl disk 1 to 6. took a while but it was worth it. tried it and it worked. used daemon tools to load and run program. also burned copies using imgburn dvd dl disk. no problems encountered. thanks seeders.
,Natalee Holloway,2011-08-24T05:48Z,"@dielaughing - good grief, you're a twat. A truly historic amount of information resides in this torrent, and you're all ""dooood, tl;dr."""
,ckc21,2011-12-15T20:57Z,"Hello! I've downloaded disc 1 and 6, and nothing happens when I click read article from Disc 6. Any ideas? Thanks!"
,U_Rebel_Scum,2012-03-01T19:33Z,"Can someone post some instructions on how to burn this.  DLed Daemon tools and not working.
I've worked with .iso files but not sure what to do with the .bim files.  Do I need DL DVDs?
Is there a way to install this without actually burning it?

oh and dielaughing, how can you just chuck all of this amazing history after downloading it?

I guess not everyone like to read anymore :("
,DAKTAR2,2012-04-11T17:23Z,These material is all data magazines. How can I convert them to something I can watch and not read?
,fairy20121,2012-05-14T01:55Z,"Disc 1 is corrupted for me. Don't know anyone else had the same problem. I thought all is lost. However, I ended up finding another copy of disc 1 as a torrent by itself. Author is here.

Once the disc one is downloaded, you can install it. In the right disc 1, it's an ISO disc image. 

On this torrent, disc 2-6 are as bin and cue files. Daemon tool (on Windows) will work. Use Toast (on Mac) will first convert the bin and cue files as a toast file. Then the application will mount it normally. 

Thanks for the comments and the upload. I love it"
,fairy20121,2012-05-14T01:57Z,"i should add that disc 2-6 do work. on Mac, I converted it to toast files and the application will treat it like a regular DVD. "
,fairy2012,2012-05-14T16:27Z,"i also found that you can download the installer for the entire set by going to the website for nat geo. go to its faq section and download the latest installer. the latest version is 1.66b1251 (the app is called cng). the website title is cng support hub, known issues, etc. read the thread and you'll be lead to the correct file. before you run the installer, make sure you have the latest adobe air already installed. 

however, the latest update runs very slowly, even though it has more features. "
,ij98,2012-05-14T19:17Z,"Previous posts didn't mention or realize that Adobe Air 3.2, the latest version, doesn't work with the latest free update to the program. Must use Adobe Air 2.6. Otherwise the program crashes/hangs."
,Grobant,2012-05-18T02:33Z,"Ok, I've tried about everything (have a few 8GIG coasters to show for it)
So here is my humble contribution:
BOZX created the .BIN image files with UltraIso

Download & install from http://www.ezbsystems.com/ultraiso/ (they have a trail version)
Choose 'Tools'->'Convert' from main menu
Use one of the .bin files in this torrent
Output Format -> select Standard ISO (.ISO)
Click Convert

Burn CD/DVD Image
Choose 'Tools'->'Burn CD/DVD Image...'
Select an .ISO image file, then click the 'Burn' button to begin.(I've tried the .BIN file but it made a coaster)

Disk 1 will install the NG software from where you can update Adobe & NG"
,ij98,2012-05-19T02:07Z,"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/updates/products/cng120/cng120/badge/index.html

This will let you install everything. But first delete/unstill all copies of Adobe Air and CNG that you may have. 

http://www.nationalgeographic.com/complete-national-geographic/faq/"
,ij98,2012-05-19T02:12Z,"Daemon Tool will read the bin/cue files on PC. You can create a virtual drive, and then add the image to  it. Daemon tool is free to download from its official website. And you can do this with the free version. 

Don't use VLC. These are data discs. Not videos. "
,ij98,2012-05-19T02:30Z,Daemon tool allows you to bypass burning those DVD's. Just add the virtual drives and load the images (bin/cue files here). You're done. Then go to the Nat Geo website (cng support) to DL the installers for your operating system. 
,nemo_2006,2012-07-12T20:14Z,"BOZX, Thanks a ton for the upload. Guys this works like a charm. Use UltraISO like Grobant said 
Choose 'Tools'->'Convert' from main menu
 Use one of the .bin files in this torrent
 Output Format -> select Standard ISO (.ISO)
 Click Convert

-Then you can use UltraISO or DaemonLite to mount the image. 
-Play the DVD image
-The installer will help you through the rest

NO NEED TO GO ANYWHERE TO DOWNLOAD ANYTHING. NO NEED TO EVEN BURN TO A DVD"
