In South Korea, those people that the government considers cultural treasures or "intangible assets" are given numbers. "Intangible Asset No. 82" tells the story of Simon Barker, a respected Australian jazz drummer and his search for the South Korean shaman and grandmaster musician, Kim Seok-Chul, whose music has touched him profoundly. The journey becomes an odyssey, as he is introduced by his guide Kim Dong-Won, to other great traditional artists, and must overcome cultural obstacles and the march of time to eventually meet the master only days before his death.



Barker's respect for the traditional music and his willingness to be taught, opens doors and hearts along the way and the film is a Rosetta Stone of sorts, as through the eyes and ears of Barker, we arrive at our own understanding of a philosophy and music that can seem alien to Western sensibilities. While the inner journey is marked by revelation, the outer journey is visually stunning, with magnificent vistas of South Korea's mountain ranges, verdant fields, waterfalls and small towns.
