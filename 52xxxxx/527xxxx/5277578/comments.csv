,Thinkyle,2010-01-14T22:14Z,Why are there so many .dbc files?  What is in each one?  Are they JUST the store content or is there anything extra.  Is one of them Riverview?  I'd rather not have too many loading in because I don't want it to slow the game down any.  I know package files can really slow the game down if WA is installed.  Thanks!
,tabatha022,2010-01-15T00:52Z,I've downloaded it and am seeding but How do you install this to your game?
,Progboy68,2010-01-17T07:16Z,Doesn't seem to work! do you have more precise instructions for this!
,MitchBurns09,2010-01-19T06:41Z,"I LOVE YOU
Was our family game till last update, which also botched up all our custom content too. I stopped playing for over a month.!

,glasswings21,2010-01-21T18:51Z,i have all the store content of sims 3 except the january can you please upload just the january store update?? please please!!!!!!!! 
,d0000156,2010-02-02T01:22Z,Very good thank you. By the way if you can't work it you first go to the documents find it copy it then go to the EA file in Docts. and copy it in the download file then go to the sims 3 thing see if you can download if no then go back to the file right click on this torrent file and go to properties and change the last part after the   .    to the same thing all the others say after it. hope this helps :)
,DjAndy_P,2010-02-04T15:28Z,"Thank you for uploading! Only hope this includes Riverview, but since torrent name states all custom content, that has to be assumed.

HELP TO INSTALL:
Follow this guide on how to install custom content in DBC format:

,alackey,2010-02-16T21:45Z,which dbc file just has January items? 
,sherryillk,2010-02-21T14:09Z,"Does this have Riverview? I installing it with Riverview but it's a bit messed up... The descriptions of the lots are wrong and the description of the town itself in the beginning has been replaced with only numbers. 

And this is not totally complete. The holiday stuff were missing, as were some of the other free items. I ended up having to manually install myself with the files I had downloaded previously by extracting them to package files and treating them as mods."
,8Gpigs,2010-10-30T10:45Z,"Hi,

does anyone know if ALL the store content comes in sets or is there some stuff that is sold seperately and not in a set. Thanks (:"
,kaligon,2011-02-26T12:52Z,"This if for everyone who's installed the RELOADED version of sims3, none of the store items work for this version, you need a special transition patch from reloaded to razor for the store items to work.Does anyone know further details about this?"
