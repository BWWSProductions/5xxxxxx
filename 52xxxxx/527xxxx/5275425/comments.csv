,k3nd00d,2010-02-13T11:55Z,"Note how so much of the supposed settled AGW science has now been proven to not be science but based on WWF propaganda, hiking magazine articles, telephone interview statements known to be spurious, student papers and intentionally fudged math. If you want to know these details, let me know. I know a web radio show that has covered the MSM news coverage about this coming from the top UK online newspapers...or search for yourself.

I suspect new AGW counter propaganda videos on you-tube likely have been covering this too. Not like you can expect our US controlled media to cover it and with honesty. Even the GOP news channel (fox) is not adequately doing so. But then its owner (Rupert Murdoch) also owns AGW theory fraud friendly media in other countries (making fox what is known as ""controlled opposition"")."
