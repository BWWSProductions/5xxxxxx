,themaicokid,2010-01-22T01:58Z,Thanks Ray!
,train2u,2010-01-22T11:58Z,Thanks Ray!  Good quality.  Close to DVD quality.  
,burningrabbit,2010-01-22T22:57Z,where in the fuck are the seeders?
,clyde4210,2010-01-23T01:43Z,Dark movie = not a DVD rip or a shitty way of ripping it.
,train2u,2010-01-24T11:59Z,"This is decent quality, not extremely crisp and cropped to not have a logo that appears at the bottom of the screen sometimes.

In regards to the movie, this is what apocalyptic movies should be like.  Half of the comments are about how ""boring"" the movie is, but it's not about action, it's about the survival--by a simple man with his son.  It's boring if you're used to brainless explosions and cheesy special effects, but if you want an honest, realistic struggle to survive, it's a pretty good movie.  "
,k.bubba,2010-01-25T15:16Z,"p: 7.5  VHS quality
a: 8

awesome movie!  good release.  Thanks!"
,gez74,2010-01-25T17:01Z,"thanx for all your efforts, this is a GREAT movie"
,Kasinath,2010-01-26T02:56Z,Thanks!
,lefouthanixx,2010-01-28T09:28Z,tnx very much raymondhome u have great uploads
,philbo1,2010-01-29T11:15Z,"A=8
V=8
M=7

Not a bad movie, pretty sad and depressing but cool post-apocalyptic scenes.  That child actor (or at least his character) is the most annoying EVER though.  Mortensen was awesome, as usual.   :)

Oh and I think there is some footage cut in the middle, it didn't interfere with the storyline.  Also some slightly out-of-sync audio late in the movie, nothing to worry about though."
,eater78,2010-01-31T12:01Z,thanks 
,Costiputza,2010-02-04T18:30Z," Thanks for the upload. Unfortunately not very good quality torrent V=6, A=7"
,hail_to_the_king,2010-02-07T04:32Z,"wouldnt waste ur time with this one guys. video is shit even for a 700mb file, audio is even worse. i had to turn it up 3 times what i usually have the volume at. 
wait for a better copy"
,eXeQiEl,2010-02-09T17:50Z,"ok ok, now i realised.

This is a cropped version of

""The Road - DVDSCR - XVID - V2 (COMPLETE) -ToXiC[ExtraTorrent]""

link to original:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5271263/The_Road_-_DVDSCR_-_XVID_-_V2_(COMPLETE)_-ToXiC%5BExtraTorrent%5D

MegaPlay cropped a little bit in the top and in the bottom too, just to quit the shitty ""Property of Dimension Films"" and ""For Screening Purpouses Only"" hardcoded tags that appear from time to time in the movie.

About the lenght, its the same 1:49:26.
About the quality, this, the MegaPlay version, maybe has a couple of filters. It's a little more bright.

Not bad for people who wants the movie as fast ast they can or that have low bandwidth. It's Toxic's 1.89gbs vs MegaPlay 709mbs!

So, it seem the same, but the ratio has changed. And the image is a little stretched up and down.



Thanks for the job. Its an info comment just. No blame or intend to take this torrent down.

sorry about my bad english"
,eXeQiEl,2010-02-09T19:01Z,"another comment... for dumb people like ME that do not read properly the torrent info.

:|   hahahahah



all that i said is said before in the torrent info

sorry."
