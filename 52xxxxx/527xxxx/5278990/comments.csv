,krad21,2010-05-17T10:28Z,"Hey thnx for the Upload Markuf, game works good thru disc loader, I have had about 2 disc read errors in by the 3rd mission, but i just had to re-insert disc and was okay. If anyone has had it work flawlessly please comment on your current settings.

I HAD to use Verbatim DVD-R, and not +R. (I did burn @ x16 though, never had any issues at max speed)
I have wii 4.1u, wiikeyv1."

using Wii ver 4.3e

modchip: Drivekey V1

maybe because its a NTSC version of the game, although i have not had a problem with that in the past :("
