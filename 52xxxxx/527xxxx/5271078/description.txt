                    The drama set on an African nature reserve  
                    returns for a new series. Danny and Alice have  
                    been working hard on a project to rehabilitate  
                    a group of circus elephants, but they need the  
                    help of Vanessa and Rowan to move the herd to a  
                    new home. Rowan is surprisingly co-operative -  
                    but he has an ulterior motive. Meanwhile,  
                    Caroline and Du Plessis are finally getting  
                    married, but an old friend of Caroline's does  
                    his best to come between them. Can Du Plessis  
                    ensure that the wedding goes ahead?
