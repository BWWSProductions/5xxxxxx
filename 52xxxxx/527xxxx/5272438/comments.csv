But,this is actually episode 11 (http://www.fox.com/house/recaps/s6_e11.htm) since the first episode was a 2 hr event and counted as 2. I see that all the contributors have listed this and all others as one E# lower than what it actually is. Hopefully this helps others out whom are wondering the same thing I was."
