This is so close to a vinyl discography that saying it was would be stupid.

im missing 2112 and hold your fire. after hold your fire they went to CD mostly and only rare pressings of vinyl were made of albums after that. I don't have any of those, but i have almost ALL of their studio discography that was publicly sold.

2112 and hold your fire are in the mail now so when I get them I'll upload them separately. so if you wait 2 weeks you'll have a vinyl discography. no worries.


I won't list all the tracks because there are so many, but the albums include:


Rush
Fly By Night
Caress of Steel
All The World's A Stage (2LP Live)
A Farewell to Kings
Hemisphere's
Permanent Waves
Exit...Stage Left
Moving Pictures
Signals
Grace Under Pressure
Power Windows

I recently bought hold your fire and 2112 on eBay (like 20 minutes ago) so when they arrive i'll upload them for you guys. enjoy this and seed
