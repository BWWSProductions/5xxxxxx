Al Shines, former king of the US race car track circuit, Ãž
has a hard time starting his own team, once he's fired by Ãž
his sponsor Robin Cates. Robin hired Al's immature Ãž
daughter Kylie Shines instead. She resents Al's Ãž
inevitable 'absence' as a widowed father, as well as the Ãž
reigning champion, equally young but professionally Ãž
vetted Kid Walker. Kylie tries to prove herself against Ãž
Kid while having an on-off affair with him. Cates's Ãž
marketing strategy dictates his intentions to manipulate Ãž
Walker and both Shines racers.
