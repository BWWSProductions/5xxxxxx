The Third Policeman by Flann O'Brien


From book cover:

"Flann O'Brien learned from Joyce the art of tuning language to a
lyrical pitch, which he could then turn to his purpose, whether it was
to be plain foolery, unconcealed indignation or high comedy.  The best
of his contemporaries and many subsequent Irish writers have much to
thank him for."  Sunday Times

"Flann O'Brien is inventive, his storytelling is swift and sure, making
the eccentric seem natural and the commonplace hilarious."

The Times

"Even with Ulysses and Finnegans Wake behind him, James Joyce might
have been envious."  Observer

---------------

When I first read this book I was completely awestruck and finished it the very same evening unable to put it down. Mindblowingly scary and hilariously absurd at the same time, it points backwards towards masters like Kafka and Orwell, but even more forward to great stylists like Terry Gilliams (and the rest of the pythons) and Phillip K. Dick. A cornerstone in modern literature, and a must read for any fans of the above mentioned.
