Thanks for giving us some choice (or attempting to, 1 seeder to 367 leechers after 5 or more hours can't be good)"
,penisfuck,2010-01-13T11:40Z,"Picture quality is good. But there is a problem with the framerate that is stuttering for some reason, especially when there's more movement in the picture. This is irritating."

,H2Kzero,2010-12-10T07:48Z,"I got a Alienware with 12 terabits of memory and 12 gigs of ram with the newest ati graphics card hitting at 8 gigs. This ran... well... it ran... Pretty amazing to be honest
I rate it over all 10 =P"
,djOATS,2011-02-23T08:50Z,"thanks for the offering  one of the ""Brothers"" seemingly more basic films but still with heavy emphasis on mythos and a nice representation of someone battling to find balance within his family  
I love the fact most actors in this are barely known, always better to get into the character without the 'hollywood' stigmata..thanks again your sharing is always appreciated ~peace! "
,ThePulpo,2011-05-17T21:51Z,"Great Job man! Thanks for the upload
Video quality isn't that good though. The image is kind of blurry. I've seen a lot of recent DVDRips with that ""problem"" lately. It's a little annoying.
Anyway, Thanks!!
