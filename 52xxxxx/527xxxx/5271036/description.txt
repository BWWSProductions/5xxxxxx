
D3M0NZ is back with the REPACK for their previous release of Sherlock Holmes. The reason for the repack is because they had used the wrong audio. The quality is fine for a CAM, a little dark so might affect some parts, however, the audio is pretty nice. I saw this one on Boxing Day and I really enjoyed it, it was great fun. I donâ€™t understand why theyâ€™re bashing the hell out of it though. The film was directed by Guy Ritchie. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law respectively portray Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.

In a dynamic new portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyleâ€™s most famous characters, â€œSherlock Holmesâ€ sends Holmes and his stalwart partner Watson on their latest challenge. Revealing fighting skills as lethal as his legendary intellect, Holmes will battle as never before to bring down a new nemesis and unravel a deadly plot that could destroy the country.
