,GeekHillbilly,2010-01-15T23:11Z,Thanks. Plays Perfect.
,ajaystewart,2010-02-15T22:31Z,"Perfect. Although the info on this is wrong. Its an SD release, English audio (as mentioned in title). Someones tried to hard encode subs in the introductory credits and failed, you'll see what i mean but it wont bother you. Download it! its one the rest rips online."
,amari9,2010-02-27T16:11Z,"This is a bit confusing. It says ""English audio with english subs"" but below it says audio is Japanese DTS-ES 6.1 1.5 mbit and has subtitles. So which one is it?"
,hellowren,2010-03-19T03:51Z,so is this in Japanese with Eng subs? because that's what I'm looking for.
,ambersohal,2010-03-21T19:09Z,can you upload the japanese version?
,JujuBeans2,2010-03-22T20:15Z,This is English only. The other languages are left out. Most releases prior to this one has Japanese without English.
,Iyatot,2012-04-01T14:29Z,"umm, I don;t get it, is it english dub or jap? I'm looking for an english dub.."
,Iyatot,2012-04-01T14:31Z,is this english dub or jap? I really am confused with the details
