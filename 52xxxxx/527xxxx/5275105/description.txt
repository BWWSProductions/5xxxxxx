                    Rudies.                                  
                    Sitcom set in the world of a group of    
                    sixth-form students living in Abingdon as they  
                    enjoy a final romp with adolescence. Ollie  
                    refuses to get a tetanus jab after falling on a  
                    nail. DK causes havoc with a ventriloquist's  
                    doll and Chloe demands Matt makes amends for  
                    blabbing about their sex life. Jas has a visit  
                    from a Russian exchange student. To Ollie's  
                    horror, Staz is good-looking, glamorous and  
                    fun. With Jas developing a crush on Staz, Ollie  
                    has to prove he can be just as exciting a  
                    boyfriend as the Russian.                
                                                             
                    DK reveals he has few friends, but can do  
                    amazing tricks. At Chloe and Jas's suggestion,  
                    he sets out to use his incredible talent to  
                    make new friends, but DK's magic has a tendency  
                    to go disastrously wrong.
