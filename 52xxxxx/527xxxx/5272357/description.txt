The Complete BBC Sessions is a bootleg 9 CD box set from Great Dane Records, Italy. Total running time is approximately 10 hrs. 16 min. It is comprised of all the available recordings (from private collectors) of The Beatles appearences on BBC radio from March '62 to June '65. (All of these recordings couldn't have been recorded off the air because a couple from '64 are clearly the working recording sessions.) There were a total of 52 known appearences (not counting interviews), of which this collection has 44 (complete and partial).
