looking at the directions for install ....
can it be updated ?
i saw that all the options for updating are supposed to UN-checked???
the last two lines of the instructions - threw me off :
* Update only the spyware definition updates (manually)!*
* Do NOT update the program updates!**

the program updates by itself ?
how do i update definition updates ""(manually)""
any help - much appreciated !"

You are one of the best"
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-02-27T20:38Z,"Thanks!
Manual Update Question:

1. Download ""SASDEFINITIONS.EXE"" from the web site.
2. Extract the two files, ""PROCESSLIST.DB"" and ""PROCESSLISTRELATED.DB"" and copy them into the Program directory overwriting the existing files.
3. Or, just double click the installer and let it update them automatically?

I need to ask because I tried this both ways and the ""Core"" and ""Trace"" version numbers did not change?"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-02-28T04:47Z,"@TheEmpathicEar

With manual update is meant to udpdate the program manually by clicking the update button."

,la_cross37,2011-01-18T20:15Z,"I'm sure this is a great torrent and I might have used it myself when this was the latest sas version, but the latest version is now 4.48.1000 and there's a torrent for it here on piratebay."
,kimba007,2011-01-28T10:34Z,just finished installing sas but when i run the scan will it delete all my keygens and cracks and patches and render all my progams useless. i don't see where i can prevent that only exclude folders and files???? I'm a bit leery of running it now. What do you think?
