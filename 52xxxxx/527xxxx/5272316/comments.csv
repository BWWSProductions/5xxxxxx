I remember some of these girls from my download from the usegroups and news-feeds back in the day. Some I have sets of, others I didn't know had done more than single pictures.
I will definitely seed at gigabit speeds once I've DL'ed them. Perhaps, as there seems to be a damand, I'll pull my archives from the mid 90's and see what I can put together.

Again Thanks for the great torrents. "
