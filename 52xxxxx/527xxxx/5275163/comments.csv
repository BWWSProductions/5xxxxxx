I've been looking fo this. I've downloaded it and am now seeding. Gonna help you seed.

Thanks."
,stealthpatch,2010-02-27T08:16Z,"Woah! Just finished reading.

The ending is such a cliffhanger. Are you sure you didn't leave any issues out?

Anyway, when are the next parts coming out?

Still seeding them by the way."
,Dragonlight2,2010-04-21T00:53Z,"I am not sure when I am going to make new series.  I don't really have the time to either seed, nor get new manga, so for now, it will probably be staying as it is now.

Thanks! xx

And to stealth patch. It's the general ending, them rushing off to save Hao. I suggest you read Shaman King Kanzenban, which if i remember correctly, gives you the full ending ^^ xx"
