Starting with the group's early days in the late 1970s, ONCE IN A LIFETIME features frantic, urban-themed tracks such as "Don't Worry about the Government" and "Pulled Up." From the city, the setting shifts to wider spaces on their breakthrough cover of Al Green's "Take Me to the River" and the rural twang of "The Big Country." The second disc sees the Heads hitting the zenith of their fruitful collaborations with Brian Eno, while frontman David Byrne reaches new levels of both lyricism and experimentation on the iconic title track. The third disc cherry-picks from the group's later years, including their most accessible songs ("And She Was," "Road to Nowhere," and "Wild Wild Life"), along with the previous unreleased outtake "In Asking Land." As a summation of the consistently inventive and restlessly energetic ensemble that was the Talking Heads, things don't get any better than ONCE IN A LIFETIME.
