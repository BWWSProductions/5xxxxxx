[V],McTav,2010-01-14T19:48Z,"dear lord someone is impatient.

firstly, all of season 7 of family guy and season 4 of American have not been released yet. more simpsons will come.

and the torrent is less then 6hrs old when you posted about the speeds, i really dont know what you are expecting. "

,ianpark01,2010-01-23T03:47Z,Thanks McTav A/V 10/10 but episodes 1-10 are in a diffrent aspect ratio from 11-21 ???
,darkTanTalUs,2010-01-24T06:35Z,"Hey McTav
What program do you use to rip, every program I've tried either won't make .avi or makes the file way to big and I just wanted to know what a pro uses."
[V],McTav,2010-01-24T09:40Z,"@ianpark01

the simpsons started being produced and broadcasted in HD half way through the season.

@darkTanTalUs

this is just copied from a diff torrent 

""although what I do is no secret and I once like you was stressed not being able to find the best solution, so here is what I do, its very simple.

download
Magic dvdripper - http://www.magicdvdripper.com/
well worth what ever I paid for it. or if you are cheap you know how to get it.

Is is the best ripper ive ever used, rip with the setting of original MPEG2. that will give you a video file of the original video on the dvd. then I compress that to give the best quality.

then download autogk - http://www.autogk.me.uk/

its freeware so no need to look for anything else. Import the original mpeg2 you ripped and compress, this is the best xvid compressor ive used and pretty sure what 99% of the videos you download are from.""

have fun"
,darkTanTalUs,2010-01-24T12:10Z,"@McTav
Thanks a bunch I've used that ripper before and do agree with you that it is pretty good and I've never used a compressor before but I'll give it a try"
,magnanimous4eye,2010-01-31T01:54Z,Are you able to post the simpsons seasons 13-15? there doesn't seem to be a decent torrernt anywhere for those seasons.
,m-k_gangsta,2010-01-31T04:17Z,magnanimous4eye where can i download simpsons season 1-12? or season 16-19?
,OILFAN79,2010-02-04T07:12Z,does anyone know of a ripping software to rip the bluray 1080p of this season
