Based on a true story, a high school teacher decides to give his students a lesson in "mob mentality" and it evolves into a psychological experiment on the evolution of fascism.

The movie was both highly praised for the ground-breaking nature of the subject and widely condemned for glorifying the almost certain devastating emotional distress inflicted upon the unwitting students/subjects.

Either way, the video is still replayed in high school and college sociology classes across the country to this day... and it must be on third and fourth generation video tape by now since (afaik), it is not yet available on tape or DVD.

The most memorable ABC After School Special ever made.
