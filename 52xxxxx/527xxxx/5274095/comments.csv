,Madaz13b,2010-01-17T15:25Z,"hi thanks for this but i thought i woud let you know that ep 44 wont play properly, it wont play in WMP and in vlc player it keeps stopping"
,Madaz13b,2010-01-17T15:51Z,all good media player classic plays it fine
,soagg1,2010-01-17T17:50Z,Hmm......really I would like to know why it is not working on vlc because for me it worked all fine.
,Mavin,2010-01-24T00:39Z,"I also had a problem with Episode 44.  I went to Windows Media Player's online help, but it wasn't helpful.  It didn't even give me a new Codex to download.  I also tried the file with Nero Showtime and QuickTime, but neither played it.

I deleted the file and attempted to download it to see if there had been a problem in the original download.  However, I got the same error.  Here is what the online help says, if it's any use to you.

,kdavies9688,2010-02-13T06:18Z,Sooooo Slooooow :( come on seed 
,bamsen82,2010-02-17T14:22Z,are there more Episodes after this Season
,soagg1,2010-02-17T17:21Z,Nope there are not. BTW I always mention that when ending the series in the description and the series is also moved from Ongoing to Previous End Dubbed Animation :)
,Mavin,2010-02-21T22:07Z,Episode 44 is still not cooperating.  Any chance of getting this fixed?  Thanks!
,Rychen,2010-03-09T09:56Z,"Hey Mavin, you may want to try using something other than WMP since it often gives a lot of folks issues. I usually use GOM player and have absolutely no issues with anything I torrent. Hope this helps ya bud. ^_^"
,Mavin,2010-03-14T23:18Z,"Thanks for pointing me to GOM, Rychen.  That worked.   Now I can finish watching Blood +. LOL"
,Riikachii,2010-03-22T17:22Z,"Episode 44 won't work for me either...
Any way of fixing this..?
Sorry! ;-;"
,Riikachii,2010-03-25T03:48Z,"Let me correct myself;
Anyway of fixing this without using a different media player?"
,stringdog32,2010-08-25T15:27Z,can someone seed this please thx!
,Sleppmegin,2010-11-19T14:01Z,Why the change from soagg suddenly too soagg1 ?
,Sleppmegin,2010-11-25T15:28Z,"Just a thought, maybe the problem ppl mention with ep44 is not a dl error, but rather it got damaged during the upload ?

And....why does soagg have a new account now ?

Also I've noticed that every season of blood keeps getting progressively smaller...are you compressing them more and more ?"
,TheDeadNextDoor,2011-09-02T20:25Z,"Very good, just why, soagg1?""
Regardless, good Torrent, I'll seed this one for a long time. "
