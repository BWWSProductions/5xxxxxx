Rocknrolla.2008.DVDrip.H264.[REQ]
GENRE: Action | Comedy | Crime
DIRECTOR: Guy Ritchie
CAST:  Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson, Thandie Newton.

In London, a real-estate scam puts millions of pounds up for grabs, attracting some of the city's scrappiest tough guys and its more established underworld types, all of whom are looking to get rich quick. While the city's seasoned criminals vie for the cash, an unexpected player -- a drugged out rock 'n' roller presumed to be dead but very much alive -- has a multi-million dollar prize fall into his hands.

I can recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.
VLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.
One can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.
QuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.
PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.
And please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).

Subtitles: English, Finnish, Dutch, Croatian, Portuguese, Greek
**********************************************************************************

What goes around comes around. Give and youâ€™ll be given.

I am a sort of refugee from â€œminimalistic-was-a-starâ€. Many of my friends, my â€œRegularsâ€ came on TPB following my torrents. It takes a long time not just to make people to â€œrecognizeâ€ my small-sized stuff, but to adopt specific models of behaviour, when they interact, cooperate one with each other, exchange and, at the end, enjoy shows and movies. 

One thing I have always repeated: Solidarity. We, people from â€œDeveloped countriesâ€ seem like have forgotten too easy what was only five-six years back when majority was on dial-up, wrestling with 2-4 kB/s. 

We also forget how hard is to live far away from all cultural, sociological â€œcushionsâ€ our societies have provided for us, be surrounded with unbearable hardness of life, live surrounded by unimaginable poverty, diseases â€“ and a feeling of total disconnection from the rest of the â€œshinyâ€ world, where obviously, no one cares about anything else but themselves. We, who have â€œmoreâ€ must share with the ones who have lessâ€. Must. Other â€œtypesâ€ of behaviour are not welcomed â€“ here. People who cannot share could go away, doors are open. Trespassers and punks will be escorted someplace else.

We are the rebels by nature, thatâ€™s why we are here on place called â€œPirate bayâ€â€¦ not to eat each otherâ€™s hearts out. We are here because world around is a dark place. People who come here are not the enemies, most of us struggle to survive, and taking just that and that much we need not to feel deprived by injustice. We are here to fight unrighteousness, but not amongst us. Never forget that.

Read carefully how someoneâ€™s kindess makes him a victim.

@htctouch: I bow to your kindness, but, my brother, this is too much, Your ratio should be 1:1 or slightly above, but that looks really sad, seeing you as victim. OK, LIMIT your upload speed, in ALL similar cases.

During the download your ratio should be max. 0.5-0.6. Rest you make later, when you are at 100% - staying as seeder. If you stay to seed some unpopular torrent, IF no one pops-up for 48h you can stop the seeding and remove the torrent. 

If you find the content valuable (some rare movie or show) you can stay as seeder as long as you can, to give others opportunity to find and download something.

CONCLUSION:
After someone has done this to htctouch (who struggles with 10 kB/s upload AND download speeds â€“ because that is what he has and he gives to others) expect zero tolerance from me. I was awake the whole last night trying to catch up/nullify TPBâ€™s 38h downtimeâ€¦ and didnâ€™t see this. 

If I did, down-time would be much longer, and not caused by TPB. 

Also, in the future, if I spot something like that, kind of gang-banging of innocents, youâ€™ll feel my response, I promise. If you are not satisfied with things Iâ€™ve just said, please â€“ go away. Internet is a Big place for all of us. And donâ€™t come back. Please.
