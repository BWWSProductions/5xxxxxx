[V],pluto999,2010-01-13T21:28Z,@20/40: My upload speed is unlimited always.. & upload speed provided by my ISP is 2mb/s that means people can dowanload file from me atleast @ of 220kb/sec..if not more
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-13T22:26Z,"@pluto999: I did, that's how all this jazz started. Years ago. I must tell you that I have bought my first computer back in 1983., wrote first commercial program in 1085. and I have been programmer from then. Also, I was a developer in some software projects ranging from torrents and networking BUT as the ""one who make programs which make programs"" (it's a joke but my job-description as ""compiler maker"") I was involved in all imaginable projects concerning audio/video ""department"". I encode as a hobby from 1998. 
How, the reason why I telling you all this is in hope that you and all others who have this or similar questions have in mind:
""Twentyforty knows all this things, all I know he already knows, and all questions I have he already have answered - to himself, to thousands of other people, to god, to anybody.
Twentyforty have ""measured"" all this things so many times that I even cannot imagine.""

What I'm trying to say is:
I have said and zillion times elaborated such issues, some of that stuff you can find here, especially in ""reprint"" of my ""Pro&Contra"" text in ""It's complicated"". It is - complicated and not at all - if you know all what I know."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-13T22:30Z,"@pluto999: Concerning your speed, you are 370% FASTER than me. You can help here a lot. We are all ""snails"" here. I need you, we need people like you. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-13T22:32Z,"LOL, 1085 = 1985    
Oh man..."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-13T23:38Z,"@holerat: Can you read? Line above your stupidity?
Have you anythintg smart to say, ass-rat? Get lost."
,kayslay,2010-01-13T23:57Z,"thank God i found u twentyforty,been looking everywhere for u since mininova ''closed down''.Lol
Keep up the good work!!!!!Can u encode Spartacus-blood and sand please?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-14T01:05Z,"@kayslay: Yes, right now as for welcome and your ""please"" people tend to forget. Ep.1 then 2."
,troy1969,2010-01-14T19:01Z,"@2040

I can only bow down for you. As I've said before I just love your encoding with the small size.

And for what you wrote in the info about htctouch:""
Internet is a Big place for all of us. And don?t come back. Please.""

I second that opinion!!

As always, I appreciate the time and effort you put into this.

Greetings from Norway"
