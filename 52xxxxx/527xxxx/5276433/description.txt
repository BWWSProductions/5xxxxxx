â€¢Dual boot with Vista/7 (Can't dual boot with XP or older. Google instructions 
for linux. 
With installing mac first: 
Â»Boot up to the installer (or to your mac if you have another version install-
ed) and open Disk Utility under Utilities. 
Â»Create a new partition if you plan on installing it on the same drive, and 
format it to HFS+ (Mac OS X Extended (Journaled)). (Also do with full drive 
if you plan on installing OS X only on the drive) 
Â»Then if you need to apply the DSDT patch in the installation (you will see 
as you go) 
Â»Install OS X. MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE CUSTOMIZE BEFORE THE INSTALL! 
Â»If you installed the bootloader that is by defualt chosen during the install
then you do not need to do the dual boot steps of Windows. 
Â»Now after you have it installed and everything, boot into Windows, and 
install as normal. (If you cant boot into your mac, then use Windows Disk- 
part to set your mad partition or drive as active. 
With Windows installed first: 
Â»Create a partition in Windows at least 8GB in size and set it to active 
Â»Use USBit to make your USB the installer. 
Â»Boot into your USB and open disk utility. Format your mac partition to HFS+ 
Â»Apply the DSDT patch if neccessary. 
Â»Go through the install REMEMBERING TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR INSTALLATION. 
Â»After installed, and have your OSx86 setup, open disk utulity again and set 
the Windows partition to active (If you Don't want to use the Mac bootloader 
which i suggest you use) 
Â»After booting into Windows, download and install EasyBCD (Google is your 
friend) and add a new entry. 
Â»Choose 'Generic x86 PC' for the mac and DONT CHANGE THE NAME 
Â»Then save changes. Now when you boot up, it will let you choose which to 
boot into. 
If you don't understand anything, google it or ask me. Or go to OSx86.com. 
THEY ALSO HAVE A FULL LIST OF COMPLETELY COMPATIBLE HARDWARE!
â€¢If you cant boot because you have a x32 PC, then use the bootflags 
-v -x32
