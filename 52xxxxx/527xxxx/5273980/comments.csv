,japiapian,2010-08-02T01:47Z,this torrent is crap. right and heres why when downloading the torrent that part went fine. used daemon tools to mount it disk 1 went fine problem when trying to do disk the installer said that it couldnt so if someone could how to fix it i would be greatfull.
,japiapian,2010-08-02T01:48Z,woops i meant to say when mounting disk 2
,Lopesmaio,2010-08-02T16:44Z,"This torrent isn't crap.

It works perfectly, but it gave me some work, that's true, i had to create .iso images and do some stuff, but it is perfect.

iMilk, excuse me, but i think i could create a torrent easier to use. I would upload the 3 .iso files."
