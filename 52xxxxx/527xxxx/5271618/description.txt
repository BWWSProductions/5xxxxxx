BBC James May's Toy Stories 2of6 Plasticine PDTV x264 576p AC3 MVGroup

James May is out to prove why traditional, old-fashioned toys are still relevant by pushing them to the limit in spectacular, supersize challenges.

Episode 2 - Plasticine
James tries to make a garden entirely out of Plasticine and then enter it at the Chelsea Flower Show. He persuades thousands of members of the British public to help make the thousands of Plasticine flowers he needs, but will it be enough to persuade the guardians of the world's most prestigious horticultural event to let him make a garden with no real flowers in it?
