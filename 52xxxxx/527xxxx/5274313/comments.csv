,KracKils,2010-01-13T00:17Z,150 Seeders and no comments? This the real deal or not? I got a strange hit on my resident shield right after starting to download this but I believe it came from one of the many pop ups associated with TPB.

To you assholes looking for comments......why dont you be the first and shut the fuck up. You make me sick."
,inspiron2004,2010-01-14T00:34Z,"Hey don't be such a dick.  This guy doesn't have a skull, there are a shitload of seeders/leechers, and no comments.  Sodidn't want to download a fake torrent.  I did the same thing and chose to wait for some feedback."
,yayayay,2010-01-14T00:59Z,"Relax. Stop trashing eachother and stop going offtopic. No need to argue, the torrent is fine and now you know it.

For everybodys information; after a few more uploads, I will see if I can get a skull."
