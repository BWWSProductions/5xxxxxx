,bhuvank,2010-01-14T21:16Z,hey 20-40 when u plan to upload The Fourth Kind...
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-14T22:20Z,"Thanks.
@bhuvank: If everything goes smoothly, two hours from now."
,htctouch,2010-01-14T22:49Z,"hi 2040 thrs a request iv bn tryin searching on net n at local stores out here
the movie called
Short Cuts
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108122/

i found 1 torrent but its too huge..by any chance can u upload the movie ? sir plz do tell me if u do."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-15T00:59Z,"@htctouch: I found one copy only, but pretty bad. However htctouch you must be aware that Short cuts are long movie - 3h20m I think and they cannot be - small. It is like two normal movies in duration.
Even with my compression ShortCuts cannot be under 600 MB and copy I found has - 705 MB.
It is stupid to compress such file. Gain in size is  minimal and quality loss is always present. 
So, what I can do is to point you on Google, search for ...Short Cuts (1993) [DVDRip|x264|705MB]... and result will point you to one forum where you must follow instructions, become membership then download. 
Is this OK with you?"
,ZetaBeta,2010-01-15T05:18Z,Thanks for this 2040! I know you've been backed up this week because the site was down for a few days. I will seed for awhile but it looks like there are already a good amount so far. Cheers mate and keep up the good work.
,htctouch,2010-01-15T07:45Z,thanx 2040 will try it .. 3hrs 20mins .. ghooshh lolz
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-15T09:38Z,"@ZetaBeta: Your screen-name is even hard-coded on the beginning. Some people consider that as a privilege. So, as requester (requestee) you do have obligation to seed for at least 48h. It has been so from the beginning of time.

@htctouch: I have TWO copies now. I will try it out and see what can be done. So, stay tuned."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-15T15:13Z,"@ZetaBeta: Correction, your screen-name for whatever reason is NOT hard-coded. I have no idea why my program pull such tricks, it happens more often then I expect... Anyhow, I am sorry and requester obligation (to seed 48h) is terminated. "
,lilars26,2010-01-15T15:54Z,This movie is a real life horror story.One way that one can help is to not patronize any place that uses sea life for our amusement.
,lilars26,2010-01-17T02:39Z,? They call him flipper? I can't get that song out of my head.
