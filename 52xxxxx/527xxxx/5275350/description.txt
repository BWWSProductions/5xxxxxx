Second Sight
Alison McAlpine 2008

This cinematic, non-fiction ghost story follows Donald Angus MacLean, one of the last of a generation raised with the Gaelic oral tradition rather than electricity and television. â€œDon Angieâ€ is an old charmer, a man of the church who has listened with an open and curious mind to a lot of â€œterribly strange storiesâ€ throughout his long life. The camera roves with him through the rugged vermillion landscapes of Scotlandâ€™s remote Isle of Skye; from gorgeously shot craggy hillsides to the sites of spine-tingling stories of spectres, ghost cars, death foretold and the â€œsecond sight.â€ This softly painted portrait of a vanishing era spins an irresistible tale that becomes a moving study of life and mortality.

Itâ€™s true Gaelic ghost stories are the best, especially when told by those seasoned Scots from the Isle of Skye. A pure and rare delight.

In an isolated community on the Isle of Skye, filmmaker Alison McAlpine sets out to explore one man's struggle to secure the traditions of a dying way of life that is hanging onto existence through its oral tradition, now reduced to ghost stories. Rich in humour and the moving intimacies of life, the film celebrates the importance of the individual in sustaining cultural continuity. In both Gaelic and English, McAlpine captures the last generation of a Scottish Gaelic oral tradition, a generation that grew up without electricity and TV. The extraordinary characters in the film consider the existence of ghosts as a given and a link between the past and present: the ghosts are their departed loved ones and their stories are an opportunity to confront mortality.
