Sweeney's arrival disturbs plans for a social evening.

Eliot's first significant piece since 'The Wasteland'. Similar
in content but very different in style from his earlier work.
Although unfinished, the published parts were polished to TSE's
usual standard. They stand alone.

The work is now seen as merely the prototype for his later plays.
But it was much more than that - matching solemn themes to jazzy
tempos was a radical idea. TSE did return to this approach, but
never again with such contrast.

Probably best known now through parodies of Eliot's style. It's
too short to merit a full scale stage production. This radio
adaption is an opportunity to hear the play as TSE intended.
