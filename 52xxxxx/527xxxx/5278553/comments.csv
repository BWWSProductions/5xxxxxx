I'm new to torrent files and to The Pirate Bay. And what a treasure I have discovered in the last few days. Of the members who have uploaded the kind of material I am interested in--audios of great works of literature and BBC adaptations of such works--you are one and another is 'sheila' something (I forget the full name). This is to thank both of you.
Also to request you to please seed 'Sweeney Agonistes' so that I am able to partake of this Eliot play. I am sure you are aware there are very few seeders for works such as this, so our tribe of people with like interests stands at a big disadvantage, as against, say, those who look for porn! Keep seeding, please.
Regards"

,spafon7e,2011-06-19T08:15Z,Not sure why you can't get this one - it's still seeding ...
