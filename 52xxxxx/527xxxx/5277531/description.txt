Why? To provide a true high quality experience.
700MB files were great when blank DVDs and bandwidth were expensive. Now neither of these commodities is hard to come by so up goes the file size, and the quality with it. My files are ripped with my own requirements in mind. I don't lie in my descriptions like others though. I'm not doing this to make friends. This file is not 720p! It is not High Def! I call my files HQ for High Quality because they are pretty damn close, but saying anything else would be like calling 128kbps MP3 "CD Quality". Anyway, enough of my rant. Enjoy the movie.
