Overview: A candid look at the sex trade, supposedly by means of hidden cameras and microphones, "Prostitution Pornography USA" is a voyeur's delight. This almost no holds barred "documentary" includes interviews with the participating call girls, streetwalkers, and porno starlets. We're also treated to a montage of real-life photos of the gals from childhood on up before we get to see them in action. 
Joanne ("The Love Garden's" Barbara Mills) is interviewed in her bath. A high-class call girl, she claims to have seventy-five clients a month. Blonde bombshell Marilyn is a streetwalker turning fifteen to twenty tricks a night. 

Donna is a nymphomaniac who works in porno flicks. We see her in action on a yacht during a shoot. Then we see clips from a porno flick called "Bang Bang". 

The finale shows a junkie hooker named Lauren who, in between shooting up, has sex with guys in public Johns to support her habit. From the Sultan of Sexploitation, Harry Novak.
