,altemeldo,2010-01-14T23:56Z,Hi MKVGuy. Pls what software do you use to rip DVDs to the MKV format you use. I've tried many but they are too large. I'm very much interested in making them 400Mb like you do.

,muk0690,2010-01-15T19:47Z,"@zzzonked: He does reply... Check out his other torrents for his comments... He said that he uses megui, staxrip etc randomly... He recommended staxrip"
[V],MKVGuy,2010-01-15T21:07Z,"thanks 'muk0690' for backing me up.. and yes I do respond..

there are different settings in different applications..

for 'altemeldo' and others who are interested try using Handbrake targeted file size with 2-Pass Encoding, audio Vorbis 64kbps, 48KHz and leave the default settings..

I mostly use StaxRip.."
