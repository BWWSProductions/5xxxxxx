[T],Sunblock.,2010-01-13T02:03Z,Works great no problems. I patch it to wave 3 too. To skip the activate disc. Banned console so not matter :).
,red456,2010-01-13T03:04Z,can this be 'down-hacked' for original xbox console?
,VenusLost,2010-01-13T11:13Z,hey guys if i patch to wave 3 wats the difference?? 
[T],Sunblock.,2010-01-13T14:12Z,"red456:

Not sure what you mean. If mean none flashed xbox 360. the no. Or u mean first xbox. Then no.

VenusLost:

The diffrent is to fit the fireware you have on our dvd. Like i have 1.6 IX = wave 3 support only. Or i can use actv iso. But im lazy. I have not flashed my dvd to better fireware  and use actv iso every time is zzZzzZ. There for patching the games to wave 3. But this is only if your console is banned or you dont care about geting banned. 

This is 100% chance geting your console banned!"

Got all files, unrar done, but abgx360 level 2 check failed:
""Stealth status is uncertain, there is no verified rip of Xex CRC BA2B9F7F in the online database. Verification failed. Aborting autofix because there is no Xex ini available.
Now what? anyone know?"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-01-14T13:34Z,"steelbunny:

The game is to new to be in database. You have to wait. But if you have a banned console you dont need to bother with abgx360."

,stroudy,2010-01-14T20:10Z,HI IM HAVING A BIT OF TROUBLE WITH THIS GAME WHEN I TRY TO EXTRACT WITH WINRA IT TELLS ME THAT THE VOLUME IS CORRUPT CAN SOMEONE HELP
,broodwer,2010-01-15T01:20Z,"Hi I get ""update needed"", which I accept. Then the game/xbox restarts and the same ""update needed"" again, and again. The game wont start, just the updater. Can any one help?"
,bmxer4130,2010-01-15T05:03Z,"Holy crap there are a lot of noobs on 360 torrents. I have seen them ask if they can play 360 games on a Wii, computer, DVD player, Xbox, and tons of other things. Oh, and a TON of people ask why their Xbox won't play it/ what to do with the file/ if you need to do anything to your Xbox.

Please, if you have a question, use Google. Srsly. >:3"
,thumperRocks,2010-01-15T06:27Z,"idk whats up with this or if its just me ive  been doin this the same way for over a year and never had a problem till now.. if im doin somthing wrong with this please let me know.... thx
1-unrar
2-run abgx to wave 3
3-burn in img burn at 2.4
4-pop in activate disc
5-play the fuckin game..
  my prob is my xbox wont load it. the game came up once but said  disc dirty and couldnt play it  please help this is my third try i realy dont want to keep waisting me disc    thx..."
,fakebest,2010-01-15T07:42Z,@thumperRocks upgrade your firmware to ixtreme 1.61 using latest jungleflasher http://360mods.net/ this works for everyone else so maybe the wave patching just doesn't work for this game or something but 1.61 should run all games until ixtreme lite comes out it just needs more testing but it has been confirmed that it is done but not fully tested
,thumperRocks,2010-01-15T08:29Z,@fakebest-thx alot.. that may take me a while though as i had someone flash my box for me. do you think its possible that other newer games wiil work ? i just got darksiders and it works like a charm?
,broodwer,2010-01-15T11:06Z,"This is the first time I get this update-problem, so if that makes me a noob I guess I am then, but I can't find anything on google about this problem.

I patched it to wave3 but since it worked for Sunblock it should work for me as well."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-01-15T13:30Z,"broodwer@

You need lates dashboard 2.0.8955.0. My guess ur banned and cant get on on to live. Here how to manual install the dashboard.

http://ixtreme.se/guide-dashboard-en.html"
,six12,2010-01-15T14:24Z,"Same problem as some of the others, with the disc requesting to update in order to play the game, but then restarting again and again....


I thought the problem was, because i patched it to wave3, but than i burned the game and didnt use patch, so the game was wave4. The problem is the same. The xbox keeps restarting when the the update is finished.

Maybe it is the version of firmware, i have version 1.5

I will try to manualy update the dashboard, see what happens...
"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-01-15T14:33Z,"To explain it simple.

The update thing have nothing to do with fm. New games require latest dashboard."
,six12,2010-01-15T14:51Z,"I already have a current nxe dashboard, Ill try to update anyway..."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-01-15T15:11Z,2.0.8955.0 ?
,six12,2010-01-15T15:13Z,"I GOT IT TO WORK!

Here is the solution for the infinite update restart problem (at least it works for me):

1. first off, if you do not have the latest nxe update, than upfate it manualy via USB, like someone before me said:
you get it here:
http://digiex.net/downloads/download-center-2-0/xbox-360-content/dashboard-updates/2747-nxe-update-2-0-8955-0-avatars-download.html

2. I already had the latest NXE (november 17. 09)on my 360, but it kept on restarting after the game disc update anyway...

2.1 ...so I downloaded the latest NXE anyway, extracted the file on USB, and put it into the USB port on the 360. The 360 was on when i put the usb into it...
2.2 ...what happened next was exactly....nothing. No popup messega to update or something similar...as if i did not connect anything to the 360. 
2.3 so I just hit the A button on the controller (the AO2:TFD disc was already in the console) to play the game, and voila!!! It did not ask me to update the game this time! The game booted normaly and is playable.

After my first successful boot, I disconnected the usb, and the game boots fine anyway. I tried this multiple times now,  turning the 360 off and the game boots normal. This goes for wave3(in case you patched so you don have to put activate.iso each time in) and wave 4 discs. I get no update message whatsoever now, and am able to play the game.


hope this helps to some of you.

"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-01-15T15:23Z,Update window only appear if the NXE daskboard is old. It looks like alos that MS make 2 version 1 Beta after that 1 Final verstion. If this have anyhting to do with it im not sure.
,six12,2010-01-15T15:35Z,"Could be..., i dont know, but as i said, nothing happened, except with the usb in the 360 the game disc did not request an update..."
