Amazing jazz from end of 1959, the New Years Eve in fact. Recorded on a three channel tube tape recorder. This rip is made from a 45 rpm vinyl record, excellent sound and excellent music! Mastered by J Tamblin Henderson at Reference recordings.

Ripping equipment Linn LP12 player / Linn Linto MC-amplifier.

Enjoy!
