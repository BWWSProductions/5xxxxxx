[M],SteRipper,2010-01-13T20:23Z,"@MKVGuy This torrent has been moved from Video -> Movies to Video -> Highres - Movies.

Remember that MKV files are high res videos and belong in this category :D "
[V],MKVGuy,2010-01-13T20:44Z,"Yes agreed but my files are not 720p or 1080p rips, for my rips MKV acts like a container which keeps and plays all combination of best codecs which was not possible with AVI and MP4.

Also if you see other files in Highres category, all files are in GBs so I think its better to keep it in normal Video > Movies category.. 

PlayBoyMan any other thought to put it in Highres category? Like I would be very happy if my files can be a part of Highres category but is it really OK for 400mb file,

What you think guys.."
[V],pluto999,2010-01-13T21:19Z,agree to both of you guys but..just video sounds great..ain't it?
[V],pluto999,2010-01-13T21:20Z,@mkvguy: why so late man?

,altemeldo,2010-01-15T00:24Z,Hi MKVGuy. Pls what software do you use to rip DVDs to the MKV format you use. I've tried many but they are too large. I'm very much interested in making them 400Mb like you do.
,altemeldo,2010-01-15T00:29Z,"Very informative and detailed answer. Other answers just gave me any DVD ripper they knew. You can email your answer to: 
altemeldo@yahoo.com

Thanx."
