thx untruparadox for the up!"
,zambone,2010-01-15T06:53Z,"Found a way to get multiple states on Windows.  Slightly long process and needs System Restore so probably only Vista and 7, but here goes.  Install with defaults.  Start TT and let it update.  Then start your return, but don't fill much out, just get to the point where you can select the states you had income in and do that. Then go to the States tab, and the second or third screen shows each state u selected and a ""Start"" button next to it.  Then do a system restore (Start-->Run ""rstrui"") and pick the ""TurboTax wrapper"" install.  When that's done, reinstall Turbotax.  After it restarts it will ask to update again, and this time it will download all of the states you had selected before the system restore and install them.  No idea how or why it works but I came across it by accident (on Windows 7) so figured I'd share with the world."
