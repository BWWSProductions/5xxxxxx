[V],oneanight,2010-01-14T19:32Z,Thanks again !..;)
,VdC,2010-01-30T16:26Z,"Great up, thanks.

To anyone interested, this is the clean version."
,elnu,2010-02-12T18:54Z,"The audio quality is fine (I don't get Mozebi's comment).  However, what happened to the track order (it's different than all other I see of this CD)?  For example, track 4 on CD1 should be track 7.  Also, the structure of the CUE file is weird.  I cannot claim for sure that it's wrong, but my version of Nero surely cannot handle this, and it definitely looks unusual.  "
[V],oneanight,2010-02-14T20:05Z,"I'm not sure why you guys are still using Nero to burn flac.
As it can be so temperamental using the external plug-ins.
I myself like many others use the program below once installed it on the flac cue sheet.
Just so simple.

Burrrn 1.14 beta2...   http://www.burrrn.net/?page_id=4

as for the track listings there are a couple in the wrong position are relied on freedb.
without checking thoroughly just must have had too many beers that night.

So there's nothing wrong with the cue just don't use Nero.. with cues."

Aww man. I was hoping for uncensored RIP. :("
,szabobodani,2010-06-29T21:50Z,"Hallo :D
Thanks a lot!
Some track have been mixed up.
Speechless  So Happy I Could Die
Telephone  Dance In The Dark
That's what I discovered so far :D
Except this, nice job, Oneanight! :)"
[V],oneanight,2010-07-12T17:51Z,This is the clean version so there\'ll be no problems playing it with young children about enjoy.. and you\'re welcome
,seerde_naj,2010-07-17T17:40Z,FUCK Quality !!!!!
,tonyromano777,2011-03-07T00:01Z,"Thanks for the FLAC.
 Track list order is no prob, just run it through Winamps auto-tag"
,zorn1,2011-11-23T10:04Z,Quality of some of the songs here is really no better than that of the 360 kbps versions I already had. This upload gets a TD from me.
,condoleezaRULES,2012-07-09T22:25Z,"I think the target audience (piratebay users) want the explicit version over the clean version. But this if FLAC so I shouldn't complain, thanks!"
