Senator Frank Parsons' campaign is such a busy time consuming endeavor, that he doesn't have time to bring his live-in girlfriend to a climax. When he gets to his office, however, his sex secretary is quick to service his needs indeed. Senator Parsons decides to run on an anti-porn platform to spice up his campaign. 
He is invaded to a campaign party aboard a luxurious 65 foot yacht by a Texas oil millionaire - where the pre-campaign festivities begin! From the stem to the stern, the bunk to the deck - everyone adds to the sexual excitement and political perversity of the moment in this free-wheeling example of deep governmental intervention!
