,lolliesrus,2010-01-19T03:43Z,"Why one huge rar file 13gb a lot to download to find out if they work
a lot of smaller files would be better then we can dl the ones we need"
,tim0NL,2010-01-19T17:02Z,if i unrar it i get to 27 GiG so choose...
,tim0NL,2010-01-19T20:28Z,and thats not good for the swarms and speeds
,zxkb4s29,2010-01-22T11:03Z,just compress one-by-one.
,tim0NL,2010-01-23T15:39Z,"Fool, compress 1 by 1 is not less spacing. If you want to download some just search them all seperately"
,tim0NL,2010-01-27T07:24Z,list? i dont  have time to make a list with 700 names
,mrmaxhimself,2010-01-28T15:37Z,"If you're using Windows: Start - Run - cmd - go to dir with all the games and type: dir >c:\games.txt

Open c:\games.txt and cut and paste to this torrent.

Compressing one by one is pretty much as good as compressing them all together.

Good upload anyway, though."
,tim0NL,2010-01-29T07:11Z,"@mrmaxhimself is this also on vista

@everyone working on speeds now i have 2 pcs uploading here"
,tim0NL,2010-01-29T14:50Z,I have made the list
,elgrantimmy,2010-02-15T10:47Z,please seed!
,bamboni,2010-03-18T07:41Z,You could at least seed until someone has reached 100 %
,tim0NL,2010-03-19T07:17Z,busy with that but i can't upload it all the time but i trie as much as i can
,bamboni,2010-03-22T07:23Z,"No, but now I have uploaded 75 gb, and just got 8 gb, and still standing on 62.78 %
Full speed a day that should be it"
,bamboni,2010-03-27T23:24Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED for christ sake. I have now uploaded 114 gb for you and I still havent got 100 %. If you want to take then give. Now IÂ´m pissed
,bamboni,2010-03-27T23:25Z,68 % now. Thats just not goog enough. Why even bother to upload a torrent then?
,bamboni,2010-04-05T15:40Z,"tim0NL, seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed.
Now I have uploaded 200 gb of your torrent and is still on 76 %. Do you really think that that is fair?"
,tim0NL,2010-04-27T19:52Z,"And finally, it's all uploaded, and it's fast too!"
,mm74615,2010-05-01T14:47Z,Thanks. ;-)
,heyitshaydn,2011-05-25T01:05Z,"thank you very much, works perfectly on my nds emulator, am seeding for long time... any1 need nds emulator for a pc go to coolrom.com   and the emulator i use is called ""desmume"" works very easily and all you have to do is carry over the .rar files to the application (when opened) and choose your game and ka-boom."
