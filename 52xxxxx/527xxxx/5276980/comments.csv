[T],RedHatcc,2010-10-30T04:28Z,"Thanks for the reviews, we are looking for request at the moment please visit the site and post what you would like to see and chances are we will have a rip for it that same week. "
,senshisteph,2011-01-12T08:12Z,"Thanks for a great download! Because each workout is so short it's great for those lazy days - I really can't find an excuse not to do only 20 mins, and then as I'm up and moving anyway, might as well do something else too ;)
And it's challenging enough that on days where that 20 mins is really all I can manage, I've still had a good workout."

,stphsimpson,2011-06-21T12:08Z,"i just downloaded this video and so far it is great quality.  thank you for the video.  and not to sound so new, but i am, i just set up my account and am not quite sure how all this seeding works.  could someone please explain.  thank you"
,cutctrl,2011-06-23T01:20Z,"Just download and keep yout torrent client opened. Usually you'll see the upload rate and the d\u ratio.
This torrent has lot more seeds then leachers so you don't need to seed"
[T],RedHatcc,2011-06-23T02:38Z,"Big thanks goes out to the seeders of this torrent. Thank you for helping keep this alive. That makes high quality work worth while, and motivates some of these uploaders to keep uploading good stuff. Thank You!"
,GothicProphet,2011-07-05T14:43Z,"Thank you for the upload!!  Had to suspend seeding on my end while I streamed it to my TV (BitTorrent and TVersity don't like each other apparently) but will resume.  Best quality version of it I've seen out there.  My only problem is it's all 3 levels in 1 .avi file, should have split those up, but I can figure that part out I suppose.  :D"

,blazerder,2012-04-27T10:22Z,"OK Mr. Toddler Face I want to see you do all the plank jacks.  ha ha ha  This is a kick ass workout but it really gets results!  I've been doing it for 2 weeks and it really works.  But, I also run for 40 minutes after to really burn fat.  Hmmm...
Fantastic video and great download! Thanks!"
