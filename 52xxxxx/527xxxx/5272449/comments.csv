,feuerfrei,2010-01-13T14:21Z,"it is more, than very likely the www.eztv.it site is down :( neither me can download from it anything. they started with banning the ""search"" window, now this.
moreover, there should be strong and cruel limitations even here on Piratebay, since I am downloading movies more, than 1 months !!! they limiting the bandwith of seeders drastically, that s what they do ! "
