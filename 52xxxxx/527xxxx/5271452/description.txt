From Wiki:


Paul Janz (born in 1951 in Three Hills, Alberta, Canada and raised in Basel, Switzerland) is a Canadian theologian, and formerly a prominent singer-songwriter of pop rock music in the mainstream and contemporary Christian markets. He is known for the hits "Every Little Tear," "Close My Eyes," "Stand," "I Won't Cry" and many others.

He began his music career in the 1970s with his brothers in a band called Deliverance, best remembered for the hit "Leaving LA", released in 1979. In 1984, he launched his solo career, which culminated in four projects with a string of chart-topping hits from each album. The success of his projects led to his nomination for the Juno Awards, Canada's most prominent music award. Despite achieving great success in Canada, his record label's restructuring of its roster of artists led to the end of A & R promotion in the American market. Janz's final project, Trust, which was recorded under the Attic Records label, continued the same ground-breaking tradition with Janz's trademark lyrical compositions and driving melodic rhythms. Since that time, Janz hasn't released any new material.

Presently a Lecturer in Systematic Theology and Deputy Head of Theology and Religious Studies at King's College London, he formerly taught philosophy at Trinity Western University in Langley, British Columbia and has recently written a book entitled God, the Mind's Desire: Reference, Reason and Christian Thinking[1] published by Cambridge University Press. In 2004, Paul's first album High Strung was re-released on CD for the first time by Escape Music in the UK.
