Okay, so...  I noticed a lot of people were complaining about the existing versions of this episode being laggy, or other problems.  I decided that I'd make a standard XviD encode of my own which mirrored the rest of the episodes currently available. (624 x 352 resolution, medium quality video and sound.)  This certainly isn't "collection" quality, but it matches the other episodes well enough in size and quality!

Enjoy!
