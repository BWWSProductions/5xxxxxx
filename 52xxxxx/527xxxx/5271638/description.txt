BBC James May's Toy Stories 4of6 Scalextric PDTV x264 576p AC3 MVGroup

James May is out to prove why traditional, old-fashioned toys are still relevant by pushing them to the limit in spectacular, supersize challenges. 

Episode 4 - Scalextric
James May continues his quest to show what is possible with old-fashioned toys by using them on a scale never seen before. James attempts to build the biggest Scalextric track in the world, nearly three miles long, on the site of Britain's oldest grand prix track at Brooklands in Surrey. The track will have to go through people's gardens, over ponds and rivers and even negotiate a business park. Who will win the race of the century, the plucky locals or the team of Scalextric experts?
