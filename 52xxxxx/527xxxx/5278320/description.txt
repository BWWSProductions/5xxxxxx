There was, until recently, a support/erotica site for girls in love with their own sister known as sistersinlove.org. It contained many wondrous stories, true and fictive.

Sometime in early January of 2010, the site's admin, Jan Vincent, went insane, reportedly from religion, and closed the site and removed all its files from the webserver.

Unfortunately, I know of no backup or mirror of the site other than archive.org's Wayback Machine, and that one was incomplete and most unhelpful. Still, it's better than nothing.

This archive contains a compilation of all the files I could salvage, the URLs used as starting points, and the script that compiled the package. Enjoy!
