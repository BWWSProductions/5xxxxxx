,bdaddy4,2010-01-24T21:42Z,Not sure what is going on. i've completed the download but it stopped at 7.87 i guess that is all there is though or should it go to 7.88? also when vuze is checking the download it gets stuck at 12% while checking is there something i should do?

,fishfarm81,2010-01-28T19:47Z,Hey I need help. I downloaded the whole thing but it won't play because it is all these random files with no program attachment. How do I fix this and make the files play.
,schur04,2010-01-29T04:20Z,"I'm having the same trouble, what do I do with .r00?"
,bub-ole,2010-01-30T13:08Z,if your having trouble downloading remove the broken trackers. im dl at a high rate and is only taking about 4 hours for the whole torrent. this is what worked for me.

,Bluecrew27,2010-02-05T02:08Z,"hey i need help, when im using Wrar to extract the files into a specific folder, it extracts all like 15 files for each session, (ie chest and back) but it just puts them all together into 1 file and I can only watch the first one of each series, wtf am I doing wrong? I need help, it wont let me extract each individual, how can i change it from wrar grouping them all together?? thanks"
,cmcnaugh,2010-02-05T02:55Z,"How do I get these files to work? I'm new to torrents so I need some help. There is nothing to extract, and I've tried Windows Media Player and VLC. No luck with either one playing the files. "
,cmcnaugh,2010-02-08T17:30Z,"I downloaded winrar. Winrar told me that one file was missing, and that another was corrupt. None of the files will play after I extracted them. What a waste of time downloading this torrent. "
,38robbie,2010-02-09T11:22Z,"to everyone that says that it doesnt work and that it's broken and wont play= youre fucking dumb. it unrars just fine, all avi's work great, it was well worth the download. if you are an amateur that doesnt know how to use something properly and cant figure out how to work it, dont act like a fuckin expert and comment saying that it doesnt work. i almost didnt download this cuz of the bad comments, i was afraid that it wasnt gonna work, but im glad i gave it a shot cuz those dumbholes were wrong, IT WORKS FINE!"
,SKRiders,2010-02-12T04:58Z,Please seed.. really dont want to wait 3 days for only 7gb.. and if as good as 38robbie says will seed back to 2 ratio but that will probably cap my limit for the month

,drernberg,2010-07-25T06:58Z,"Why is it that I can only watch the first workout of each section? It seems as if everyone are the same. I've extracted to different files, I've extracted to the same file, I've extracted here. What am I doing wrong?"

,gremaa,2010-09-15T04:11Z,"hey guys, downloaded the file, opened it up and found that each folder has many rar files (such as disc01 chest and back has 31 rar files, plus 17 random files). Which file (or files) do I have to extract? Are all the files the same? I saw an earlier post that stated r00, but is that the only one, or all of them? and so far all the files look the same. If someone can help me out, I'd greatly appreciate it."
,mike18xx,2010-09-28T09:17Z,"Same files, un-RAR-ed, and including P90X Plus:

,cryskonig,2010-10-11T20:28Z,plz seed!
,mala123400,2010-10-13T14:42Z,Great. Works awesome . Thanks
,Bummerzz,2010-10-27T05:40Z,"For every dude who is confused and using a mac, like myself, here's what I did.  I suck with computers and can't believe I got this far so if you do this you should be good to go:
1. Download this shit
2. Drag/drop into your torrent program (uTorrent is what I used)
3. Download ""The Unarchiver""
4. Open ""The Unarchiver"" and the preferences will pop up and you'll be in the ""Archive Formats"" section
5. Click ""Select All"" so every format has a check mark in it. (no idea if this step is necessary but it didn't work until I did this)
6. Go to the ""P90x Complete Disk Collection"" you were luckily able to download from the gracious seeders (all hail the seed kings, for they are holier than thou)
7. Open any of the folders within there (i.e. Ab ripper) and double click the first file thingy  ""P90X.DISC.12.Ab.Ripper.r00"" (which should now look like The Unarchiver icon) and The Unarchiver should open up and ask where you want to store the file you're extracting.
8. Make a folder or do whatever the fuck you want.
9. Push ""Extract"" and it should then extract the file to the folder you designated.
10. Thats it!  Now just do that with each folder.  I could be wrong but I think you only need to extract the .r00 files from each of the folders and can just ignore the other files in the folder.

Anyways, that's what worked for me.  Hopefully it works for you.  If not, you're really fucking dumb because I'm stupid as fuck and it worked.  "
,Bummerzz,2010-10-27T05:45Z,"OH and a huge thank you to RedHatcc or whoever is really responsible for this.  I love you.  I'll seed this for eternity with a smile and a boner.  Rock on, stay rad!"

,MarkAWilson,2010-11-27T22:30Z,"Hey, i dowloaded this smoothly, but when i open it up to plat it only the audio plays and no video. What did I do wrong?"
,MarkAWilson,2010-12-01T03:43Z,Ok i have the video working now. But I burned each video to a DVD-RW and it will not read it on a DVD player
,BrOkEn-GlAsS,2010-12-01T14:10Z,"MarkAWilson 

You must be new to pirating, anyway, throw out the dvds you burned them on, most dvd players dont read the rw format. all you need to do is get onto google, search for vlc player, or sm player. Those will play virtually any file type you can think of and some you can't. hope this helped..."
,BrOkEn-GlAsS,2010-12-01T14:12Z,"oh and im downloading, get back to here when It's finished."

,timothyk,2010-12-12T04:02Z,PS. yes I am an idiot when it comes to computer stuff and I am new to torrenting. Please help!
,chiefluke,2010-12-21T18:46Z,"I think that most of the confusion with this download is because the rar files in each folder are not displaying the files extensions (r00, r01, . . .etc.) in file explorer.  So it appears like there are multiple copies of the same file, but their not.  You need all of the r__ files to create the one avi in each folder.  Each folder, and each avi, corresponds to a dvd."

,iamficht,2011-05-27T18:21Z,"OK, I must be an idiot, but I've tried everything everyone has recommended, and I cannot get this to work.  I just get one .avi file that has a single workout on it -- but surely this is just one track of the larger .avi file.  I open it in VLC and I try to skip to other tracks, etc. but nothing works.  All I get is one workout per file, but isn't each of those files supposed to be an entire disk?  Please help a neophyte."
,mb2013,2011-08-08T23:54Z,Ok how do i get this to play on my computer what type of video player do i need. The download was great though
,fern242,2012-01-19T12:34Z,Hi you guys...im new at this... just started download... how exactly to you do seeding?
,lilvergz,2012-02-28T09:18Z,"Seeders!!!!!Please!, no downloading speed:("
,thorkis420,2012-03-11T03:04Z,"   Use WinRar. You need all the rar riles or .r files for each avi such as ""ab.ripper.r00 through .r10"". 

   open it up with winrar. drag and drop the 1 avi file and use vlc to open it up. Rinse and repeat.

   Each avi is split up into a different rar files. you need all of each to view the whole video file. 

Also having the .par2 files for said rar partial files is of great importance in most cases. if the rar partial files get lost or corrupted you can easily recreate them as long as you have most of the rar partials using a program such as quickpar

Also using a program such as GFF Split & Merge you can make these partials into one rar file. Though with Winrar this isn't really needed.

   As a side note you can right click and extract files then click on keep broken files if you dont have all of said rar partial files."
