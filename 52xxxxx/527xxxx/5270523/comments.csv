,Rawrexe,2010-01-09T12:16Z,"Suggestions, Recommendations... Please let all the questions and suggestions come =D

Thanks in advance to all seeders, I will seed as much as possible, as stated above what time I will be able to seed this Torrent.

Max upload speed here is 10mb/sec, so that'll do for alot people, tho I won't seed always (Read: 10:00 till 20:00, UTC +1). 




Friday and Saturday the seeding-time is from 10:00 to 23:00 UTC +1 "
,Rawrexe,2010-01-09T12:21Z,"Alot of these albums are 320Kbps and the others are just like the highest quality availible so far. If you find a higher quality for albums or songs for this torrent, please let me know =)"
,jseiii2,2010-01-10T21:18Z,"I guess I need to go through my stuff better since you are taking this so seriously.  I think I have a few better versions.  Do you want copies of their tour CD's.

When you go to the concert you can buy the rights to download the concert you are at later.  I have about four different ones.  Shoot me an email.  jseiii2 (AT) yahoo.com"
,vteccer666,2010-01-17T04:18Z,awesome torrent thanks for the ul true fans appreciate what you do
,Rawrexe,2010-01-17T11:58Z,"thank you vteccer666, much appreciated!"
,suvomania,2010-01-19T02:38Z,Wow!!! thanks for this great sharing...if u update anything later please let me know..
,Archangeldawn,2010-01-27T02:14Z,"wow, I just want to say that I have seen 3-4 torrents that say they have the Complete Discography. But this seems to be the ultimate collection. Not Only that but it is very well organized. And for that I give you mad Props Rawrexe for taking the time to do this. Thanks !!"
,Rawrexe,2010-01-27T13:32Z,"Happy to hear people like it!



PS.     THANK YOU ALL FOR SEEDING!! "
,Rawrexe,2010-01-27T13:36Z,"1 little mistake: 

Can't Stop what Im hearing within and By Myself @ string quartet tribute are switched names !"
,yadayan,2010-01-27T13:59Z,Thanks!
,oldfaithful,2010-02-05T00:57Z,"Fantastic upload mate, thank you very much."
,romi1208,2010-02-21T11:51Z,"Thanks dude. Love Lp

(splitting the dna 2?)"
,Rawrexe,2010-02-21T18:40Z,"romi1208, I didn't put Splitting the DNA cd 2 in it because it's all grey daze, and while grey daze is already in this discography, I don't think it's neccesary. thanks btw :)"
,Rawrexe,2010-02-21T18:41Z,"It's fanmade, so doesn't really matter that much, if it's already included on another name *to be correct* :P"
,ThePalindorme,2010-02-26T10:02Z,"I dont believe it. Linkin park is my fav band, and now i have every linkin park song, and that too in the highest quality.
Dude, i cant thank you enough. I am listening to these songs as i type. Linkin park is so awesome, i feel bad i am not paying them.
I will buy every album of LP when the music store in my town starts selling them, or when i get my own credit card. Till then, let me memorize these songs.
Thank you, whoever you are. People like you make the world a better place to live.......XDDD"
,Mr-Xero,2010-03-16T00:13Z,"Hey, I was wondering if you could add Frat Party at the Pankake Festival, I don't know if its just videos, but i believe there is music on that album. also there is some ""unreleased/remixes"" that you don't have. just search around and you may find them. Also im very pleased with all this music. most of them are 320kbps, some arent but thats okay. and some skip a bit, but i got replacements. thanks again!

~Mr-Xero :D"
,Mr-Xero,2010-03-16T00:15Z,"Also Please add the DVD version of Live in Texas, Thanks!

~Mr-Xero"
,Rawrexe,2010-03-20T16:07Z,"Thanks MR.Xero for your suggestions, I will update this torrent when I have the time... 

Keep in mind this is the Audo Discography of linkin park. If I would also do Video it would get whole load more (20gb atleast) so maybe in the future I will but for now I don't have the time to make that sort of torrent"
,Mr-Xero,2010-04-03T05:29Z,"Hey, it's me again! Anyways i have been searching and collecting as much Linkin Park Music as i can, I can fill you in on some thing you could possibly get!
Here Are Some:
-Linkin Park LPReseurrection Mixtape
-High Voltage (Rare and Unreleased)
-Hybrid Theory (Japanese Import)
-Fort Minor - The Rising Tide (Bonus Tracks)
-Street Team - Linkin Park Demos (Although this may be the same as Xero Demos but i have no clue.)
-Eminem & Linkin Park
- ""The Wizard Song"" and any other songs from Frat Part At The Pankake Festival, just rip the audio from the video or like have a on screen audio recorder whilst playing the videos.
- ""In The End Rap Remix""
- Both versions of New Divide (Yes there is 2 versions!)
and there is some more but i believe you can find some of it yourself. Thanks Again Mate!
