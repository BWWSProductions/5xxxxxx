 PLOT

This is the story of the original punk band. The Ramones had it all; 
the attitude, the music, the raw sound, the stage act. More than ten 
years after they dispanded, their influence can still be heard on the 
new generation of music makers. This indispensable DVD combines powerful 
rare performance footage of The Ramones in action, poignant archive 
interviews with Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny Ramone and new interviews 
with Tommy Ramone to provide the clearest picture yet of what made the band 
tick. Also featured are the fascinating recollections and memories of tour 
manager Monte A. Melnick and of Hilly Cristal, founder and owner of the 
legendary New York club CBGB's, the scene of the group's unforgettable 
early shows. The Ramones Videobiography is a unique in-depth review of 
the life and work of a truly great band.
