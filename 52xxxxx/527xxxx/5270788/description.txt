On the last day of a golden summer, Christopher Robin doesn't have the heart to tell Pooh he's leaving for school. Instead, he writes a note that Pooh and friends misinterpret. Believing that their dearest friend has gone to "skull", Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, Eeyore and Rabbit embark on the most grand adventure of their lives - the search to find Christopher Robin!

Five delightful new songs enhance the film's charming message that even when friends are apart, they're always together in each other's hearts.
