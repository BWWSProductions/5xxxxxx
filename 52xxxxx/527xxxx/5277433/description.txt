A very interesting game, basically a tower defence with an enemy that spreads slowly over the map.
The game consists of 20 storymode levels, 25 additional levels and 10 unlockable levels. 
Pretty addicting.

To install just run CreeperWorld.exe and replace the main.swf file in the newly installed folder with the cracked one.

contents:
CW/CreeperWorld.exe
CW/Readme.txt
CW/Crack/main.swf

That's it.

Have fun.

MAUW!
