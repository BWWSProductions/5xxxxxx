Synopsis:

Halfway between documentary and fiction, â€™Wesh weshâ€™ is a take on the everyday life of an immigrant family which is struggling to integrate into France or, rather into the â€™Cite des Bosquetsâ€™ a low-income housing project in the Parisian suburbs. Like every district, it is a world of its own, with its rules and values. Mousse, the younger brother has understood how it works there. He has integrated a gang, and deals everyday with small time drug trafficking and protects his territory. On the other hand, his older brother who just came back after 2 years in prison, wants to start a normal life and integrate into society. He understands soon enough that it is hard to succeed behind the walls of â€˜Les Bosquetsâ€™. He tries to find a job, with the help of his family. But without ID papers, and with the police after him, he is stuck in the neighborhood, spending time with the street kids. One day, he finds a fishing rod, and escapes from the city, going fishing in a lake, close to where he livesâ€¦

Moving and touching, this movie does not try to be an impressive fictional tale about the ghettos, but gives an exact testimony of the lives of societyâ€™s left behind who survive through solidarity.

(if you liked Mathieu Kassovitz' movie LA HAINE, you should watch WESH WESH - an "insider" point of view)













Filmmakerâ€™s Biography:

A long-time lover of cinema, Rabah Ameur-ZaÃ¯meche decided in 2001, armed with a small DV camcorder, to direct Wesh, Wesh, quâ€™est-ce qui se passe? with a few friends, a film on a sensitive subject: the difficult re-insertion into the working world of a former delinquent. The young director took as a frame for his story the CitÃ© des Bosquets in Seine-Saint Denis, a place that he has known well since childhood. This first shot took the LÃ©o Sheer prize urging its distribution at the International Festival of Film de Belfort in 2001. In 2005, he signed his second production, Bled number one, in which he plays a former prisoner expelled from his country of origin, Algeria, a country that he reveals through European eyes.
