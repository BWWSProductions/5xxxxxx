This is one of two existing copies of the Spiderman Cartoon Maker left on the internet. Rapid share is hosting the game, however, that version contains some corrupt images and backgrounds. This version isworking perfectly. This is THE ONLY torrent of the Spiderman Cartoon Maker in existence.

To get this to run on windows XP ect, do the following:

Download Virtual PC
Download a bootable ISO of Windows 2000
Install Windows 2000 in Virtual PC
Install Spiderman Cartoon Maker in Windows 2000
Change graphic settings to 32-bit color

This game only seems to run on Windows 2000 under emulation. While it is meant to run in 256-color mode, I find the game runs too fast on that setting. Changing to 32-bit color makes the game run normally.
