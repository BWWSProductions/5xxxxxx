,Krass_Man_85,2011-01-24T03:32Z,"Thanks Bone, It really is too bad Hulu wouldn't post more than one episode. I would have happily watched their advertisments. Oh well, their loss. Production companies will adapt to new media one way or another."

,aarjcas,2012-02-26T16:24Z,lol @ Americans thinking their version is the original. The Office is a remake of a British tv show too fyi
,robnesta4420,2012-02-28T13:34Z,missing episodes 7 8 9 10 11 12 and 13 incomplete -
,fox2nd,2012-03-13T06:52Z,"@robnesta
This is the BBC version not the syfy version. The american version had 13 episodes where as the BBC only had 7 in the first series/season. but yes it is still missing 1 episode unless one of the files is actually 2 episodes but looking at the file size i dont think that is the case."
,fox2nd,2012-03-13T12:59Z,"Now that I have downloaded and checked it out a little it seems that all the episodes are there but the pilot is missing and you can not buy it on dvd (who knew). However, there is a copy of it here on tpb. twentyfourty ULed a good copy of it and the DL was rather quick. here is add for pilot.
