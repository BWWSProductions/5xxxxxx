FLYKEITHFLY


This Disney made-for-TV film has Steve Guttenberg as a tabloid reporter who wants to 

write legitimately again. He investigates an old woman's story behind the famous 

disappearance of five including a beloved child actress that occurred at the 

Hollywood Hotel in the 1930s. Everyone says the Hollywood Hotel is haunted now, and 

when Guttenberg explores it, he finds out why.
