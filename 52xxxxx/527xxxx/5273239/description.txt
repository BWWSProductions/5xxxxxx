This is one of my more popular songs written by myself (lyrics) and my good friend Paul Irvine (music). Recorded at Bleedin' Ear Studio, Mandurah, Western Ausralia.

The string section heard on this track was played by West Australian jazz pianist Walter Moroz, on his keyboard.

I hope you enjoy it. Let me know what you think.
