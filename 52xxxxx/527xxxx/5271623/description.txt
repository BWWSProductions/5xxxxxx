Oracular Spectacular is the first major label studio album by Brooklyn, New York indie rock band MGMT, released digitally October 2, 2007 on Columbia Records, available in CD & LP formats from January 22, 2008. The album features new versions of both "Kids" and "Time to Pretend", songs from their previous release, Time to Pretend EP (2005), the opening track serving as a "mission statement" and theme continued through the proceeding tracks. Pitchfork Media compared MGMT to Muse and Mew, but weaving in an early 90s Britpop sound. Prefix Magazine said the album "sounds like a college-dorm experiment gone horribly right."

It was named the best album of 2008 by NME. Wireless Bollinger ranked the album as #5 in it's top 10 albums of 2008.
