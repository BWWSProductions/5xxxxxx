,Willspirate,2010-01-14T16:20Z,It may just be me ... I've split my signal again and it could be that I'm needing to up my strength.
,djgerbilster,2010-01-14T17:08Z,"i havent been able to load eztv.it for about a week now, is anyone else having issues or is it my ISP?"
,otw_the_ace,2010-01-14T18:14Z,"http://eztv.it/ 
does not work mate "
,ZenRhino,2010-01-14T18:17Z,"I don't understand how they called this season 2 episode 10... shouldn't this be episode 1 of season 3?

I see you have it listed as IMDB does, it just doesn't make sense to me.

Anyway... thanks for the up, as usual!!"
,veloxx,2010-01-14T21:38Z,"@ZenRhino - Season 2 was split into two halves. This is the second half of season two. 

Eztv has been down for me as well for quite a while now. (in the US)"
