For problems in playing of episodes
Install Codec Pack
MKV Format requires it,anyway it is essential nowadays & give you a lot of option to play all the files in any media Player you want
Use K lite Codec or Combined Codec Pack"

Thanks A Lot RiddlerA.

Real Great Work With Such Small File Size.
Subtitles Are Great Too.

Though This Great TV Series Deserve HD, But They Are Really Huge Sized.

LOST Is My Favourite One And Everyone Loving This Genre Should Watch The Series.

,puppyup,2010-11-19T08:30Z,"Seed bitches, seeeed!!! And to the leeching worms: Keep seeding when you finished downloading!!! This torrent has to be kept alive. This is the smallest file size you'll get for reasonable quality. I need 35GiB less on my HDD compared to other torrents!"
,hasman,2010-12-23T13:15Z,Seems like a great torrent :) Thanks a lot RiddlerA
,hasman,2010-12-23T15:15Z,Guys pleaseeeeeee seed I'm downloading now. The dwnld speed varies from 35-40kb/s to 2 kb/s sometimes.So it takes longer to download. If there is a steady dwnld speed it will dwnld much faster. Appreciate your help. Thanks :)
