What do a softcore porn star-turned-armed robber, a rehabilitated 
coke addict, and a bankrupt 4'8" 40-year-old have in common? 
They were the child stars of Diff'rent Strokes, the popular 
NBC/ABC sitcom that aired from the late '70s to the mid '80s. 
From what happened behind the scenes to what went wrong after 
the cameras stopped rolling, we'll find out what the gang was 
really talkin' about when Gary Coleman would ask, "Wha'choo 
talkin' 'bout, Willis?"
