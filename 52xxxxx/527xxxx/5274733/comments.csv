,utternerd,2010-01-12T22:36Z,"Unlike the first posting, this is purely a torrent with all episodes inside. As opposed to the previous, episode-at-a-time method. MSTies around the world enjoy. Enjoy this cult classic comedy, well worthy of it's fame."
,servo1337,2010-01-12T23:04Z,Finally! I missed this show so much.
,crow1967,2010-01-13T00:02Z,"I can almost fit it all on my thumb drive, seed people!"

,g00p993,2010-03-02T04:45Z,"great! I was enjoying some of these and figured i'd work on piecing together, except you did it for me! I'll be sure to seed for a while"
,g00p993,2010-03-02T07:30Z,quality? 444 mb files instead of the 800+? 
,stickymoney,2010-05-09T02:10Z,Thanks to all the seeders. I'm going to seed the shit outta this. Help keep this show alive in all of its complete glory.
,h64,2010-05-15T11:31Z,"hows the quality, relative to the larger torrent"
,tizzleh,2010-06-17T01:36Z,"Crow T. Robot!! Joel H. Tom Servo!! Awesome, this should take me back to my adolescence. Thank you  for this utternerd!"
,brighteyes7,2010-08-19T12:30Z,could someone encode these for a psp/ipod/zune? would be much appreciated :)
,ShadowSoul,2010-11-23T16:29Z,"It does have two episodes I'm missing: 106 - The Crawling Hand and K00 - The Green Slime... But it is still missing three others: K01 - Invaders from the Deep, K02 - Revenge of the Myesterons from Mars, and K03 - Star Force: Fugitive Alien 2 Any idea where to find them?"
,utternerd,2010-12-25T05:27Z,"The quality is fine, remember these were originally ripped from a VHS. As for episodes K01 - K03 are at this point to my knowledge, ""lost"". I'm sure Jim Mallon has them tucked away safely, but that does none of us any good. This is as close to the full collection as we can get. K00 was only recently aired in front of a live audience, which is how this bundle has it."
,captpicard,2011-01-22T23:42Z,"Oh wow, I can't believe it's every damn episode. Need more seeders though. I'm gonna seed this shit non stop till my monkey ass drops though. Thanks for uploading this one, man."
,Iwantsyourcookie,2011-02-11T08:49Z,"Fantastic, will seed as much as I can.
Anyone who has this, please seed more!
Thanks"
,Iwantsyourcookie,2011-02-11T08:50Z,"Please seed more!
Thanks :)"

,jstoner,2011-05-13T06:19Z,"Please seed, will seed when complete, don't feel like waiting the estimated 2 years and 15 months for this to download."
,Kingsize_slim,2011-06-20T16:21Z,"Classic Thnx Utternerd, for those in the UK that only got a taster of the later Seasons on the Sci-Fi it's also a shock as I never knew there were this many films thnx again"
,rabbitr0n,2011-07-06T15:03Z,"Please, for the love of god and all that is holy, SEED THIS! My download is going so slow it feels like it's never going to finish. I've been downloading it for three days already and it says I still have over a week to go. 

My top download speed for this is just over 200kbps [it usually tops off around 45-50kbps], but I have been uploading 400+kbps pretty steadily. SEED PEOPLE!"
,subonad,2011-08-01T00:58Z,I just started downloading the first few shows but still I'm uploading at much more speed. Please seed this amazing torrent. 
,chabosun4,2011-08-20T05:32Z,"Great, great upload. Thanks very much."
,Bigevilworldwide,2011-09-22T11:06Z,"This technically is not all of them for sure, its the closest I have seen to all of them but there are about 3 seasons missing. there were 13 total and this is 9..... The only reason I notices is because season 11 episode 1 Joel came back of a minute. "
,utternerd,2011-10-15T14:52Z,"This is everything, INCLUDING the KTMA Season (which is not part of seasons 1-10) and the previously unaired pilot, K00.

Bigevil, You are incorrect, there is NO Season 11. The show ended with ""Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders"", Season 10, Episode 13 on 9/12/1999

The episode you refer to, where Joel comes back shortly, is in Season 10.

Just to clarify there are 11 Seasons total, Starting with KTMA (local), then 1 through 10 (national)."
,Zoticus,2011-11-04T16:06Z,"For the record, utternerd is right about Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders -- it was the last episode aired -- but numerically it's #1003 -- it was passed over for some reason and actually aired after the ""final episode."""
,Spendorf,2012-05-28T11:03Z,A true MSTie! We all love you! Thank you! 
,Spendorf,2012-05-28T12:47Z,SEED!!!
,christo7,2012-06-09T10:23Z,Are any of these DVD rips or is every episode the TV rip? Cheers!
