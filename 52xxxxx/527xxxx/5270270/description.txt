Gotham City is plagued with crime and corruption in places high and low, but one man has taken a stand against evil in all its forms: the dark avenger known as Batman. A rash of horrific murders committed by apparently ordinary people rocks Gotham City to its core - and when Harvey Dent, the horribly scarred criminal known as Two-Face, escapes from Arkham Asylum, Batman realizes he's involved. But Two-Face has plans for Batman, using him as a live test subject for a terrifying new drug, with a grim purpose: to kill his "good" side, and allow the scarred face to reign supreme.
