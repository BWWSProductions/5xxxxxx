NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....
Well this is our version on Daybreakers......we used the original 6.3gig soucre files for our video,thanks
to ELEKTRI4KA for them.
The audio is our own and as been filtered and synced by us.We've also added a screenshot off the original
video source so you can see what it was like.
Now we've got to say this is far from great for many reasons....but the main two are the colouring and the fact
the black borders change throughout the whole film.
Now what we opted to do so you lose none of the video was to crop the black borders at their lowest point,but
what this does leave you with is black borders through some parts of the film but at least this way it isn't over
cropped compared to the source files.
Yes we could of cut it up and resized all the parts to match up,but that takes time and we didn't think the video
was worth all that time specially when we have other releases we're working on that are better quality.
The other main problem the colouring.....hmmm what can we say it's fooked :lol: we tried to balance it out the best
we could and also ran some other filters over it.
