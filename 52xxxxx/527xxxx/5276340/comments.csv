,Jackk14,2010-05-02T04:12Z,"Where do I copy the crack too?
There's nothing in C:/Program Files"
,Jackk14,2010-05-02T04:22Z,"nothing in ""C:/progam files"" i now know is because I havent installed it, but when I try to run the ""Manager 10"" application it says there is a GfxCore.DLL error?"
,Jackk14,2010-05-02T13:42Z,"fixed the gfxcore.dll issue, now its telling me Total Club Manager 2004 isn't installed correctly?"
