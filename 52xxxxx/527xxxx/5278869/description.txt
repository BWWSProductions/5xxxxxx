Intro: How to build your own Sembrador de Terror.

Sembrador de Terror is a paint monster originally put together by Fumakaka @ Lima, Peru. You can see the actual Sembrador blueprints here.

This instructable shows you how to make a slightly sturdier and easier to fill-up-with-paint version. It also handles pressure better, and gives you several spray options.

This Sembrador will set you back around U$75, if you're in BogotÃ¡, Colombia.
