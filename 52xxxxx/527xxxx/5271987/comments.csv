,zinjero,2010-03-13T16:42Z,"Problem with desinterlace sometimes, no ?
What a pity because most of the movie is in very good quality."
,Gramgreg,2010-03-18T16:00Z,excellent!
,DragonF.C.Porto,2010-03-26T22:32Z,Thanks
,FDNG,2010-04-25T18:13Z,"Downloaded in 20 mins. But yes, there are interlace problems. Quid pro quo, I guess."
,FDNG,2010-04-25T19:55Z,"Downloaded KMPlayer as recommended. Still, video problem unsolved."
,smuglr420,2010-05-16T02:24Z,do any of your uploads have surround or are mkv?????
,M1NDF13LD,2010-07-04T20:19Z,interlace problems
,shiningwiz,2011-01-08T15:24Z,"Ugh I should've read the comments before I downloaded this. Yes, the other people here are right, there are interlace problems. I tried VLC, Media Player Classic and KMPlayer and no luck. I even tried VLC's ""deinterlace"" options (I have no clue what any of them are, by the by) but none of them seem to be working.

Like someone else said, it's a shame really because the visual clarity is EXCELLENT - when I look at a scene, I can actually say ""this is in deep focus"" because I can SEE that it is in deep focus.

Oh well, I'm deleting this one, gonna find another one."
,nehoc,2011-01-31T08:29Z,Interlace errors are so bad that film is unwatchable.
,nehoc,2011-02-07T08:42Z,"Ignore my previous post, it was re: 1.11 GB avi! That one is unwatchable - this GOPO MP4 rip has some problems with interlace (the picture crashes in between change of reels) but the quality itself is, well, MP4 quality:)"

Umm, you put this message on a rip that has problems? You are literally asking everyone to either vote you up even when you screw up or they are ""retarded""? Do the world a favor and if you are not sure what you are doing, maybe realize failure is your thing. The last torrent I saw from you had more negative feedback than positive, if you don't want to see your feedback don't look at it. btw calling people who point out your eff-ups on the Internet... priceless. Keep up the mediocre work."
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-02-20T01:54Z,"Too bad reading carefully isn't one of your strong points,that is if you have a strong point.I said that if people liked the quality then they should add +1 and guess what?If you look at the quality of the movie it has +22 and there are also 255 seeders this being my most downloaded movie.Surely if it had big problems then people wouldn't download it anymore but the 255 seeders are proof that people like the quality so you're nothing but a troll adding stupid comments because you have nothing else to do.Also you said that the last torrent you saw from me had more negative feedback than positive but did you take the time to download the sample and make your own mind about it?Of course you didn't,you just saw the negative feedback and thought it's no good.Start encoding yourself and lets see how good you are,otherwise zip it pal because I'm sick of you wannabe know-it-all's."
,spearmint64,2011-03-11T23:23Z,"70 years old, considered the best film ever made, and 268 seeds? Disappointment... Disappointment."
,negativeions,2011-03-22T09:19Z,"""If you look at the quality of the movie it has +22 and there are also 255 seeders this being my most downloaded movie.""

You're a douche. Who cares how many people rate it and how many seeds you have. If there's interlacing problems then there are interlacing problems. If a lot of people are morons or can't tell the difference or like watching shit then that doesn't change the fact that your video has problems... the question is. Does it really? If it does then you're a moron who can't rip and why even bother posting it? If it doesn't, then just tell those who say it does that it looks fine and to go fuck themselves."
,kprima,2011-03-31T20:16Z,awsome upload- A/V/M -10
,7andy7,2011-04-02T20:01Z,"use decomp and detelecine options when u rip NTSC with 29.97 frame rate.
good quality video with small problems with objects in movement. watchable
thank you"
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-04-23T03:42Z,"@negativeions:Fuck off pal,nobody is forcing you to download the movie.Go download it from somewhere else.I never said the movie doesn't have interlacing problems I just said it has over 100 seeders and it's not like  it's unwatchable.I wasn't good at ripping movies from the beginning,I learned from mistakes.Go and buy the movie if you have a problem with my rip.I'm just sharing my collection of movies.Either you download them or you don't I'm hardly a douche or a moron and just for the record I will upload a better version of the movie in the near future."
,louisp88,2011-06-05T10:10Z,thanks for the Upload. Classic film that I've been dying to see.
,csplinter,2011-06-07T01:18Z,"kriss_kringle: You fucking asshole.

You say on 2011-04-23 03:42 CET that negativeions is full of shit. That the movie has no problems with interlacing at all.

I downloaded the video, and there's blatant interlacing problems! How could you not see them!? I think you were lying.

The video has problems. I'm not saying it's shit. I'm not going to re-download it at this point, but you're full of shit, man. I'm going to avoid your rips."
,csplinter,2011-06-07T01:21Z,"VIDEO HAS INTERLACING PROBLEMS 

despite what kriss_kringle said on 2011-04-23 03:42 CET"
,perrul,2011-06-23T16:30Z,Thanks! Some interlacingÂ´s not a big deal.
,Kara-kan,2011-06-30T15:29Z,"Hello, wait a minute!
Those of you complaining about interlacing problems, whyt don't you insert here a link of another copy that has no such problems? I'd be happy to DL that one."
,elektralicious,2011-07-15T02:19Z,Thank you ;)
,mayhemrules,2011-08-03T07:14Z,Thanks :D Ignore the bitches o/
,ramessesthegreat,2011-08-18T04:54Z,"I agree about the interlacing problems, this file really isn't watchable. There must be a better one out there. "
,wakokonuts,2011-09-15T04:45Z,"Thank you for the upload. My father really wants to watch this. Anyway, regarding the criticisms... just don't mind them. It's either they don't know how to re-encode it to their ideal version AKA fix the FPS or has a poor PC and computer logic that's why they're too bored to configure their players. As they say, beggars can't be choosers. lol I'm just saying this because some of my movies here are interlaced but due to my player settings. TheyI don't even notice them most of the time. Again, thanks. ;)"
,Groverge,2011-10-03T11:17Z,Thanks!! :)
,proteusxy,2011-10-17T15:20Z,This is a good movie.Thanks a million. Please mate can you get killer force (the diamond merceneries) and power play movies
