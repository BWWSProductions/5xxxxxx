From Wikipedia:

"The Forever War (1974), by Joe Haldeman, is an action-laden science fiction novel telling the contemplative story of soldiers fighting an interstellar war between humanity and the enigmatic Tauran species. The pithy, insightful explorations of the inhumanity of war and of bureaucracy, and of the psychological effects resulting from time dilation space travel (a soldier returns home after centuries away), won it the Nebula Award in 1975, and the Hugo and the Locus awards in 1976."
