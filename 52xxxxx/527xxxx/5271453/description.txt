Of note, this is the first scene MKV I have seen to be the almost clone of HR settings other than bitrate.  There is only 1 flag on here that would break straight porting the video to MP4 without re-encode and still have it be Apple TV compliant.  So, SiNNERS, if you are watching, take that flag off and you might make someone happy ;-)

Designed for direct playback on Apple TV, PS3, WDTV, Xbox360, Popcorn Hour, VLC.

WDTV users change extension from .m4v to .mp4
WDTV users please update your firmware!

PS3 user may need to rename to .mp4 also if you are playing from USB device.  Should be fine if you are just streaming with the .m4v extension.

Apple TV user ensure running firmware 3.0.1 (this firmware plays video much better than old firmware).  Use custom movie sync option "Automatically include the 10 most recent movies along with selected movies."  Streaming is possible but for best result always play native.  You may experience slight frame rate loss while streaming under certain conditions.
