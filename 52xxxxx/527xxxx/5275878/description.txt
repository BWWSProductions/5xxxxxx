"These FLACs go to 11."  -jimclip

After making do for several years with shoddy MP3 rips (bad) and even creating my own audio rips from an AVI of the movie (better, but still not great), I finally broke down and located & purchased a copy of this now out-of-print but EXCELLENT concert DVD and ripped it losslessly....and I'm passing along the fruits of my labor to you fellow lossless lovers! I'm not going to bother telling you how great this performance is....chances are if you're reading this, you already know. But if you're a Stripes fan and have yet to hear this, you're most definitely in for a treat. This is their only official concert DVD, and it is one hell of a show. I can't fathom why this DVD is out of print; maybe that will change? Anyway, since it IS out of print I don't feel bad sharing this with the torrent world.

I addition to sound quality & volume issues I encountered with other rips of this DVD, often the songs didn't play gaplessly from one track to the next.....sometimes there was a pause in between tracks, which to say the least is VERY annoying. Not so with my rip. These FLACs are 100 percent gapless (I also converted the FLACs to AAC files to test their gapless playback in iTunes, totally seamless). If you are a Macintosh user, I strongly encourage you to use XLD to convert your FLACs to an iPod/iTunes-friendly format if needed. Why? I used Max for this purpose for years, but for some reason true gapless music (i.e. this concert, Dark Side of The Moon, etc) doesn't fare well when converted to AACs with Max from FLACs. I'm not sure if Max is any better with Mp3, but with AACs Max leaves a little "hiccup" in between each track once the AACs are added to iTunes. I've contacted Max developed Stephen Booth and he's acknowledged the problem. This is only an issue when converting FLAC (and maybe other lossless formats) to AAC (and possibly Mp3 too) â€“ NOT when ripping a CD with Max as far as I know. Since you can never tell what albums will have 2 or more tracks that flow into each other without a gap of silence, I've switched to XLD across the board for converting my FLACs to lossy for iTunes (192k VBR AAC, which is pretty darn close to transparent IMHO :-)

TECHNICAL INFO
Lineage: Original DVD > Mac The Ripper 2-channel16bit/48kHz Lossless PCM Audio > 48kHz AIFFs via AIFF From PCM application > XLD-FLAC v1.2.1 (latest vers of XLD 20091230/115.2).

In my online quest for this DVD, I actually ended up with two copies: a UK region-free version (technically it's all-region) and a US Region 1 version. As you might expect, the audio seems to be the same on both, however the points at which the songs are split vary SLIGHTLY between the US/UK versions. The track split points seemed to be slightly "tighter" on the UK version, so that's the one I used as my source.

While we're on the subject of DVD audio extraction (a sometimes frustrating endeavor in which I have considerable experience), it is worth pointing out that this DVD includes 2 other audio streams in addition to the 2-channel PCM:  a 6-ch/48kHz Dolby 5.1 AC3 stream and a 5-ch/48kHz DTS AC3 stream. Unlike PCM, AC3 is a lossy audio format (albeit one that supports 5.1, unlike MP3), but I purposely chose the 2-ch lossless stream as my audio source, for obvious reasons. It is my understanding that the main differences in the surround vs. 2-ch mixes have to do with how applause is routed through the speakers, but since I don't currently have a surround system setup, I can't test this myself. In any case, 2-ch PCM is almost always going to be the preferred stream to use for extracting audio from DVDs. Granted, not all DVD movies include anything other than AC3 audio, but fortunately most concert DVDs seem to offer both 2-ch PCM and a couple of AC3 surround audio options.
