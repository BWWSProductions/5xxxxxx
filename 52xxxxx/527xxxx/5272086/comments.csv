,littlebluebox,2010-01-12T07:29Z,"Thanks for the brilliant uploads, 20-40. :) 

I was wondering if you were going to upload a version of Shelock Holmes (2009)? I noticed you uploaded one Avatar and other movies... Cheers."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-12T07:40Z,"Hi friends, it looks TPB is back. As you all know, I am late 48h. I promise I catch up - somehow.

First I'll up today's schedule -it is mad-house today: Chuck, HIMYM, Heroes, Fringe, TBBT, AoP, Castle and then (it might be very late today) I'll try to up requested things, some of them have been on queue for few days (Rocknrolla, Bobby, Cove, Crawl. Hand) and then... in short, stuff have order and I never broke any promise...

For that, I NEED YOUR HELP, (not just two of you, I know well that your enthusiasm cannot match connection limitations) but help from ALL downloaders: 

TODAY, please, stay to seed little longer and crank-up your upload speeds as much is possible. I cannot do any of this without support of all my friend who visits this page."
,htctouch,2010-01-12T07:52Z,as i promised u bro . will do tht . will stop all uploads n will upload ur movies [whicheva ull upload recently] :) .. cheers man .
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-12T08:12Z,"littlebluebox: Sherlock is ready from last Friday, but - as anything else - delayed and seriously on brink of dropping out, because in time when I can bring Sherl. up it becomes obsolete and newer versions may arrive.

However, I WILL up the sample torrent, to get your and people's reactions to see if the quality satisfies and is there interest at all. It is TS (CAM) from Jumbo (was 1.51 GB and first decent one) and now is 397 MB. Sample is 8.16 MB, so people should download the sample, then decide - AND post their comments - is it good or not.

Then I will see when..."
