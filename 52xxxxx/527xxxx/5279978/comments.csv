It's like a copy from a compressed copy. "
[V],SAIMOR,2010-01-16T15:34Z,"Het is van de orginele DVD, alleen met DVDShrink naar een grote gebracht om direct te branden op 4.7 Gb.

It is the original DVD, only with DVDShrink placed directly into a large burn just 4.7 GB.

Greetings from SAIMOR/ROMIAS"
,wrgupta,2010-01-18T01:56Z,"SAIMOR, when using DVD Shrink, make sure to scroll down and select the ""No Compression"" from the Compression Setting. That way it will keep the DVD in its original quality form.

Now back to this ""The Abyss"" DVD upload of yours, and I can tell you from it's pictures, it's not original.  It's picture quality are too pixelated with large square pixels. And such results could only come from CHEAP or FREE video conversion softwares. And besides the poor picture quality,  it's screen ratio also has been over stretched into ""Superwide"" mode, too wide and too narrow,  a compression results that can only come from CHEAP or FREE Video Converting softwares.

If you still insist this upload of yours is an original, then you might have gotten it from poor quality copied DVD from the work of a poor DVD novice. 

I have no intension of malice by defaming anyone. I have pointed out the FACTS, and what I have posted about this DVD is TRUE. 

That doesn't mean you stop uploading, I have no malice of intention to discourage you or anyone. But the truth of this DVD has to be pointed out so others will know. You have a great day!"
