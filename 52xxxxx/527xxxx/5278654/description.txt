.:PLOT:.
Ninety-nine per cent of the population are dead, Abby has been kidnapped and Greg lies badly wounded - can things get any worse for the Family?

Greg has been shot, and Abby abducted by masked men from a secret laboratory. Anya realises that they will need medical equipment to save Greg's life and she leads Al and Tom into a hospital, where they face both the threat of disease from long-dead bodies and a raging fire.

During their search the building collapses, burying Al and Anya under the rubble. As Tom mounts a rescue attempt with Sarah and Naj, Greg lies perilously close to death.

Elsewhere, Abby finds herself a prisoner of Whitaker, the obsessive leader of the Laboratory scientists. They have all escaped infection and hope to synthesize a vaccine from her blood, but none are aware Whittaker has secrets of his own.

In the city, the Family realise they will need the help of other Survivors if they are to rescue their friends...
