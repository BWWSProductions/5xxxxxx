,Assarkh,2010-01-18T00:05Z,Why do I need .NFO and .sfv files?
,BDSMers,2010-01-18T18:37Z,"@ Assarkh  if there is a .sfv file then the movie is in compressed format and will need decompressing, the .sfv file contains checksums for the decomrpession program (winzip/winrar/7zip etc). The .nfo gives you information about the file, usually the release groups info plus extra stuff like format, size, quality etc"
