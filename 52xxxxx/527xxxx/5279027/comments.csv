,Adesta,2012-04-30T00:15Z,Seeding what I have of this torrent... Hoping a generous seeder who has the whole thing will make it available so I can finish the download :)
,BostonAl2012,2012-07-19T14:58Z,"Probably would be more seeders if these weren't  M4V files mixed with MP4s.  M4V's are basically a I-Tunes file?  They are very close to MP4's & can be converted to other formats.  I would probably just DL this Torrent instead: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5828070/Cracker_1993_-_1995_Complete_Eng_(__Ger_separate)_[mkvonly]

ALL MKV's and the GERMAN LANG files are separate so just right click and select ""Don't Download"" to skip.

Seed Please this was a great show, been 6 yrs since a update too??????  Robbie Coltrane is perfect for the part of Cracker.    "
