Flood! is a powerful graphic novel by the socially and politically conscious illustrator Eric Drooker, frequent cover artist for the New Yorker and contributor to World War III Illustrated.

Flood! is the story of a city dweller in the last days of the Twentieth Century.  It tells the tale of a post-industrial native, of his hopes, dreams and fears; of his survival in a world of concrete, metal and plastic; of his passionate vision of modern civilization and its effect upon the human soul.
