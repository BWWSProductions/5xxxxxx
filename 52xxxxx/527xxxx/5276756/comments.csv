,giggedyguy,2010-04-06T02:16Z,"Windows 7 x64 owners beware. 4X Version locks up your computer on startup--even in safe mode! Multiple complaint about this. Some have success, but other experience the exact same problem. Their trial software (hdtune_255.exe) does not have this problem. Don't know what they did to fuck up the full version!"
