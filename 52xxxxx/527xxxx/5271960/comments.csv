[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-12T22:37Z,"I will ask everyone who downloaded any of my movies and liked the quality to give them +1 quality because I saw some movies with a lot of thanks comments and -1-2 quality.That's just retarded if you ask me...so remember,+1 if you like the quality. "
,zebbidy,2010-03-04T13:13Z,"Great, thanks!"
,idodo1,2010-04-11T22:42Z,thank you very much
,jhaag831,2010-08-31T20:26Z,How do I get the subtitles?
,Erich505,2011-04-27T05:46Z,"The audio is a bit out of sync but if you're using VLC, use your ""K"" and ""J"" keys to adjust and set audio delay to 100 ms. excellent movie, thanks for the awesome up."
,WSma,2011-08-30T12:08Z,well I tried playing it in VLC and media player classic and there's no english in audio tracks ;(
,Fourthinline,2011-10-31T02:48Z,"@ Yorkman: You are the biggest idiot ever! There isn't supposed to be extra audio tracks for the other languages! In the original film, English, German and Italian are all spoken at various points. Maybe you should actually try to know what you're talking about before you go off on a slanderous tyraid in the future. Dickhead!"
,Woodlike,2011-11-03T23:57Z,"yorkman, you're such a troll. The movie is supposed to be in Italian. And NOT ""waste"" time on this movie? You're such a joker."
,AmishNick,2011-11-27T15:48Z,"lol thing things some idiots say on here are comedy...  My italian teacher in junior high school suggested we go see this, and I did, but I was pretty young back then, so I'm gonna give it another watch now.

thanks @kriss_kringle!"
