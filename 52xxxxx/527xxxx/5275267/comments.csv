,Dadoggy03,2010-02-20T02:39Z,"Yea, I can't get the patcher to work either, it always tells me that AnyDVDtray.exe is running even if it is not. Any solutions?"

You need to close 'AnyDVDtray.exe' if you can't find it running search for it in Task Manager and close it....then try running the patch

Hope this helps"
