        Deploy updates automatically

        If you're a software developer or an IT professional, you know
        how beneficial it is to keep your users updated with the very
        latest versions of your programs. 

        Not only do you get to sell more upgrades, but your support costs
        are dramatically lower when everyone is using the latest versions
        of your application. 


        AutoUpdate+ lets you:

        Â· Have your programs automatically check your server for
          available upgrades to your application. 
        Â· Save yourself time and trouble by not having to inform your
          users by email of new program versions. 
        Â· Configure your updates to work the way you want them to,
          without spending your valuable resources writing an updating
          system. 


        Vista support? Take a look at five reasons why AutoUpdate+ is
        essential for you.

          1) Admin account not required!

                Â· All our competitors offer an update solution that
                  requires users to be logged in with an administrator
                  account. This means that many Windows 2000 and XP users
                  cannot update, as they will not have the appropriate
                  permissions. It's a more serious problem with Vista,
                  which does not allow any users to run by default as
                  admin. AutoUpdate+ is the only tool that can work on
                  Vista, without requiring administrator logon and
                  without excessive security warnings. 

          2) Complete flexibility and control

                Â· All update behaviors are defined remotely. We offer
                  features such as silent updates, messages that are
                  defined per update, ability to update the registry and
                  execute supporting files and a script that is human
                  readable and easy to integrate with your backend server
                  logic. 

          3) Flexible delivery mechanism

                Â· You can use either an http, https, ftp or file server
                  for your updates. Backup servers are also supported. 

          4) No expertise needed

                Â· AutoUpdate+ does not require any user scripting,
                  unusual installation steps or bundling with large
                  framework packages (such as .NET). The product works
                  right out of the box. 

          5) Excellent support services

                Â· We are looking forward to deploying AutoUpdate+ with
                  your product. To assist, we offer a support capability
                  which is second-to-none.


        Updates on Vista

        Below is a list of 5 common Vista problems that update packages
        encounter. Each problem will either generate security warnings or
        force your app to launch only with admin credentials: 


        Access permissions:

        Â· The Program Files directory and HKLM are strictly off-limits
          and require privilege elevation to modify. 

        Detection heuristics:

        Â· Various heuristics, such the import table of your executable,
          are used by Vista to know if to launch your app under admin
          credentials. This can cause problems if the update check is
          built into your app. 

        Keywords in use:

        Â· Files with the words setup, install or update will require
          admin credentials to run. Be careful not to use the word update
          anywhere in the file name or properties, or your app will
          trigger Vista security warnings. 

        File APIs:

        Â· Programmers can still use the standard file manipulation APIs,
          but be careful... permission failures may not be detected due
          to File Virtualization automatically redirecting you to a
          per-user copy of the file. 

        Service interaction:

        Â· The 'allow service to interact with desktop' option is no
          longer acceptable. If you have written an Update Service, it
          must not have any user interaction that requires a GUI.

        Install AutoUpdatePlus.exe.  Launch AutoUpdate Plus once and then
        close application, this will bypass server check on first launch
        and thus remove the need to patch for server check.  Now use our
        keymaker to make yourself a valid serial, its automatically
        imported to registry.

        Thats it!  Enjoy.
