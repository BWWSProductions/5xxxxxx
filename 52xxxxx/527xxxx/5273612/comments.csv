,Zazzzy,2010-01-13T03:40Z,Clean. Works. Thx seederr
,AnasaziMindwalker,2010-01-13T09:57Z,"Works like a charm, wonder why they didn't release it when it was supposed to... a bit short, finished it in about 1h, but worth playing. Nothing to do now but wait for ""Awakening"" in March, I suppose.

Good upload, virus free, good speed. Got it in less than 3 minutes. Thanks!"
,AnasaziMindwalker,2010-01-13T15:07Z,"True enough, I was referring to the Dragon Age universe though. Mass Effect 2 should be good alright."
,weakink,2010-01-16T09:34Z,"its telling me to ""failed to authenticate the disk. Please insert the correct disk and try again.""

help plzzz"
,weakink,2010-01-16T22:34Z,can anyone help?
,onreload,2010-01-19T04:17Z,"the daupdater told me that i needed a new version of dragon age to play this, and it refuses to be checked in the DLC tab in the game - I've patched the game to 1.02, but then I had to put skidrow's daorigins.exe over the original exe - could this be what's causing the game to think I need a new version?"
,reefski,2010-02-02T20:54Z,@Seederr_: great job! but could you please update the DCL? If this DCL was uploaded on Jan 12 then it's the version that'd been pulled off by BioWare due to bugs. An updated Ostagar was re-released only now (Jan 31 or Feb 01).
,pakman001,2010-02-17T04:27Z,how do i make the RequiresAuthorization thing equal 0? i got to the Addins folder but what then? please help
,pakman001,2010-02-17T22:05Z,i got everything done but it still says that its an invalid disk...pleasee help
,jmrsaved,2010-03-02T04:42Z,you say i need patches first  well how do I get the patches?
,Vegasbob,2010-03-09T16:34Z,Wow jmr...you managed to find your way here and find this DLC for the game but you don't know how to find the patches for the game itself? Wow...just....WoW. SUPER FAIL....With Xtra Failsauce. LMAO
,Lliam,2010-03-11T13:32Z,"Works perfectly fine, no viruses, and no problems.
Thanks!"
,iceman5613,2010-03-16T21:26Z,Please answer... I have the patch 1.03 ...or at least thats what shows up when I start the game... when I check the Ostagar patch it says that it requires 1.02 ... Whats up with that ? If I'm mistaking about something please explain. Thx
