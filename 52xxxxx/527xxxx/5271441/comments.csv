This Movie Was Great!! As For Quality

I'm NOT One To Complain

A-8 (A Bit Low, But No Audience Chatter At All)
V-6 (Yes A Bit Grainy, First 6.5 Minutes Poorly Cropped, But VERY Watchable)

,westie420uk,2010-01-19T23:11Z,"Many thanks, but not a very good copy, its in letterbox mode so only a 1/3rd of the screen has anything on & what is on looks to have a lot of the picture missing from the top & bottom. Sound is average for a CAM video."
