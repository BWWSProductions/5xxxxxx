Seu Jorge (born June 8, 1970) is a Brazilian musician, singer/songwriter and actor. He was raised in a favela in the city of Belford Roxo in the Baixada Fluminense region of Rio de Janeiro state. He is considered to be a renewer of Brazilian pop samba. Seu Jorge cites samba school, and American soul singer Stevie Wonder as major musical influences. He has released 4 solo albums and 3 DVDs, but much of his international recognition has come due to his acting in such movies as "City of God" (2002), "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou" (2004), "House of Sand" (2005), "Elipsis" (2006), and "The Escapist" (2008).

"Ana & Jorge" was recorded in 2005 during the "Acoustic Tom" project, a series of events promoted by the Tom Brasil show house (now known as HSBC Brasil). These events brought together artists who came from different backgrounds in regards to their muscial genres. The concert was subsequently released on CD and DVD by Sony. Both releases were well received by listeners and critics alike. "Ã‰ Isso AÃ­", their version of Damien Rice's "The Blower's Daughter", dominated the charts in Brazil.
