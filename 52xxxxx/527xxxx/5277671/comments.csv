Unfortunately, what I assume to be the original sound was replaced with a cheesy song. The song ends about 80% through the video, and the rest is silent.

It would have been much better to leave the original sound. Additionally, the sound replacement wasn't done well. There is something screwy with the file. In BSplayer, it wouldn't play at all. In WMP, it played audio only. In VLC, it played fine though.

I was going to upload screencaps, but Imagegrabber choked on the file, and I didn't want to install MPC (or some other screencap software) just to do it.

Sorry about that."
,revok007,2010-01-14T22:02Z,@timeless314 I'm sorry that the file is screwed up. It seems to work perfectly when viewed with VLC media player. I used Avidemux to mix the song with it because I felt the original sound wasn't that engaging; it was just a bunch of hiss and ambient noise.  I have no idea why it works so well with VLC media player but not on other players.  I'll see what I can do to get some screenshots up.
