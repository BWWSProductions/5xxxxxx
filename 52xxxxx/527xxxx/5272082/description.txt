Double-episodes, requests or Pilot ep. will be issued only as MP4 or 360p.
MP4 is ISO 14496-1(H264 video & AAC LC sound) and playable on PCs, Macs and hopefully (read Comment before download; I check every file for iTunes compliance) on iPod-like portable-mobile devices.
360p is fully compatible with newer iPod, iTouch and Nokia U97. 
Requests should be posted in Comments section of newest torrents.
"Out of schedule" shows or pilot-episodes may get uploaded randomly, if situation arise (free slots).

I recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.
VLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.
One can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.
QuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.
PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.
And please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.
