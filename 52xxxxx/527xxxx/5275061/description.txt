A team of eight adrenaline junkies, looking for the ultimate in paintball thrills, are blindfolded and taken to a rendezvous point in the middle of a remote forest. The game is on when the group is immediately ambushed and under enemy fire from all directions. But something doesnâ€™t feel right. Suddenly, in the midst of bursting paint pellets, one of the players is hit by a real bullet. Confusion reigns until they realise that this is no longer a game, it is a manhunt. One by one they fall into the traps set by an invisible enemy. Their only chance of survival is to fight with whatever means necessary.
