Linda's family has been ripped apart by hoarding. She wants nothing more than to have a relationship with her grown children, but they refuse to come near her house which is packed waist and neck high with piles of belongings. Despite Linda's threat to commit suicide her family has made an ultimatum: clean up or her husband Shelton will divorce her and the kids will completely cut her off. 29-year-old Todd has been collecting models, kits and various hobby items since he was a kid. His girlfriend of five years, Robyn, wants to get married and start a family, but has threatened to leave him if he doesn't clean up his act.
