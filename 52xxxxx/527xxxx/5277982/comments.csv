""

However, this movie comes to theaters this friday, Jan 15, 2010...  So, you will be waiting awhile to buy this.


However, I recommend downloading this movie.  It is a great movie. Powerful, sad, surreal."

,YourMomma,2010-02-27T07:47Z,I always wind up buying the movies.  I've got so many DVDs I'm running out of places to put them.  Got a crapload of CDs too.  I'm planning for my old age.  I intend to be very happy when I'm finally too old to walk easily.
