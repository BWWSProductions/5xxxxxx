it doesn't work on a ps2 ,using the ps1 to ps2 disc swap.which i wanted this for.
emuparadise has this but the annoying voting and 6 part zips and extraction makes it worth your while. It is also 534,653KB bin file, @emu's slightly different than this file here.
Which is most likely WHy it doesnt work on a ps2 disc swap. I digress...
Thanks though for your efforts to keep this alive."
