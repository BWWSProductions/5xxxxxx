Active Member is a Greek hip-hop group, founded in 1992. There music belongs in the low-bap sub-genre of the Greek hip-hop music scene. It's characterized by slower tempo and rapping, combined with lyrics of political content. The words "Low Bap" don't have a specific meaning, they merely represent a perspective on life, society and politics that people in the movement have.
This music is really hard to find outside Greece and this is why I am sharing it. Hope you'll enjoy it.
