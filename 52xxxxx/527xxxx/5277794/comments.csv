[T],cirip2006,2010-01-14T23:06Z,"""angel40204"" before posting a comment like the one you posted, you should really check first. Everyone on Web is saying is the 11th episode from season 2. Even the official site of Fringe, check here :

Beside, this torrent is with italian subtitle and I allready informed my ""italian clients"" that this might be the episode 1x21. So, after all, you made a useless comment, just because you didn't downloaded first the torrent...and because you like to ruin the reputation of the others. You're nothing but...nothing. You're useless.
Sei inutile !"
[T],cirip2006,2010-01-14T23:16Z,"""angel40204"". Can i download some of your torrents ? Perhaps are better than my torrents...
Oooops ! I was wrong...I forgot that you didn't upload any of... Go shoot yorself and give me and to my torrents peace..."
,hatethefake,2010-01-15T03:14Z,Angel is right guys i watched it last night and the FBI agent that was shot dead is in this ep!!
,societymike,2010-01-15T10:43Z,"They can CALL it whatever they want, but this Episode is from Season 1, it never aired, so they played it this season, but it's from the OLD storyline before the male FBI agent is killed."
