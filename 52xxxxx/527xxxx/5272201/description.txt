Ivan Orav, a dedicated anti-communist who fought the bad guys already during the First Republic, and Lennart Meri, who was the first president of the 2nd Republic of Estonia, are facing a serious enemy - a table, that has to be moved from the attic to the living room.

LÃµbus lugu sellest, kuidas kÃµrges eas Ivan Orav ja Lennart Meri pÃ¼Ã¼avad pÃ¶Ã¶ningult kirjutuslauda elutuppa vedada. See fÃ¼Ã¼siline tÃ¶Ã¶ kÃ¤ib aga korÃ¼feedele ilmselt Ã¼le jÃµu ja nii nad sisustavadki aega vaimuka vestlusega.
