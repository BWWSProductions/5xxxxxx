,BorisSGD,2010-01-13T00:02Z,"Rumour has it, that this an unaired episode from season 1. Wich would explain why a certain person is suddenly alive again. And why nobody seems to find it strange.
It should be labeled season 1 episode 12."
,BorisSGD,2010-01-13T00:06Z,"That should be ""Season 1 Episode 21"" not 12. Sorry...."
,Feetback,2010-01-13T03:54Z,"This is Episodes 11 actually, dunno why its says Episodes 12 , something is quiet wrong in here - LOLL!.........."
,ninapuss,2010-01-13T08:27Z,Yep... poor Kirk Acavedo remains sacked.
,CampAnawanna,2010-01-13T12:56Z,@Boris - Thank God someone else noticed that. I was starting to be really confused.
,societymike,2010-01-13T19:31Z,"This is NOT S02E11  OR S02E12.

This is S01E21, an episode that never aired.

I just downloaded this, (and all the others here) and verified, NONE of them are actually S02E11"
,breakercase24,2010-01-14T11:25Z,what is the truth? is this really ep11 or not? i'm confused here... help pls...
,LlamaHack,2010-01-14T18:53Z,"Truth is that ""SocietyMike"" is a moron. This is officially Fringe.S02E11 (Unearthed). As far as S02E12 (Johari Window) which airs tonight. I really don't think that TvTeam has captured this yet. So wait till tonight or tomorrow for the official Fringe.S02E12. You people you really need to do you homework."
,hatethefake,2010-01-15T03:19Z,Hey Hack ur the moron mate.... Mike is right!
