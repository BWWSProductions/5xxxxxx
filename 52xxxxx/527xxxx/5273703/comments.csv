,kevkevnyc,2010-01-19T18:45Z,"It's weird that I'm the only one saying this, but this is the wrong movie. It's Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. I downloaded the whole thing and both the sample and the movie are wrong."
,kevkevnyc,2010-01-19T18:58Z,"I submitted too soon. The sample is correct but the movie is wrong, as far I can tell. It's possible I screwed up and renamed another file; if anyone can verify I'm wrong please do."
[V],GoodFilms,2010-01-24T00:08Z,It's the right movie.
,Robbah187,2010-05-03T12:59Z,sure hope this is hardcoded
,RazorRape,2012-03-06T19:09Z,Thanks for uploading the original. There's nothing worse than an English dub.
,komeka,2012-06-12T03:52Z,The quality is great but the audio is 2 ch.
