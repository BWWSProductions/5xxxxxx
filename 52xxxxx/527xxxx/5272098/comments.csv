,rustedhalo,2010-01-12T08:16Z,"streaming = crap   eztv = the best shows in your choice of HD or not   

hope you get the site back up, until then I'll look here and follow you on Twitter. Thanks for bringing the good stuff"
,daveo76,2010-01-12T08:26Z,I agree with you rustedhalo. I always download tv series from EZTV. Thanks EZTV keep up the good work.
,daveo76,2010-01-12T08:30Z,Why is this download at dialup speed. Keeps going up and down to a max of 3 KB/s
,CyberGRIM,2010-01-12T09:45Z,Thanks again!
,DaxHamel,2010-01-12T10:32Z,"Don't worry about EZTV. It's another hardware issue and they know about it. 

You can still get their stuff here @ /user/eztv
or goto their Twitter where they also load torrents.
