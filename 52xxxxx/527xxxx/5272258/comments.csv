,mcon1964,2010-05-10T09:30Z,"Works great!!! Thanks much,GWpirateGW!
For noobs, you don't need to mount this one.
Just click on the setup. If you have windows xp,
you won't even need the patch. At least, I didn't.
Also, it's laptop friendly!"
,Flawz777,2010-05-11T01:28Z,"THANK YOU 
ok i said it"
,Flawz777,2010-05-11T01:29Z,BTW RATE ONE PLUS
,Sythion,2010-05-20T05:37Z," ""copy patch to game directory"" Is where I think I'm having the issue. Because maybe I'm sending the patch to the wrong location? The game won't start up after install. The icon is on my desktop and everything. Anyone know what I could be doing wrong?"
,Sythion,2010-05-20T07:19Z,"ah, all I had to do was Re-Install and it worked fine. I'm sort of new to this, but if I can figure it out anyone can. THANK YOU SO MUCH GWPirateGW!"
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-05-21T07:16Z,happy everyone is helping and likes it:D
,StoneSatori,2010-05-21T19:33Z,"Yes! Had a little trouble at first but got it figured out. Gotta love human error, Thanks man! By the way, I'm running on win 7 with no problems"

,Kylemacdougall,2010-06-14T00:42Z,"Whenever I install a game from a torrent I follow the instructions and wind up at the last point which consists of me double clicking on the exe and PLAYING THE GAME which incidentally is NOT what happens! Ive done every instruction and when i try going into the game all that happens is the screen goes blank for 2 seconds and nothing happens after that, it just returns to the desktop without explanation. Am I doing something wrong all the time? Or has some1 else out there experienced this aswell? pls help!"

,N1k0Bellic,2010-10-27T19:02Z,"This torrent works folks!

This game is awesome! By far the simplest torrent I've downloaded. Just click on setup and sla-kow! You'll be playing Manhunt in no time! 

Here's a quick review. 

Firstly, this game is creepy as hell. That just means it has it's moments where you will feel your heart jump up to your throat. For example, you can be walking behind a hunter ready to stab a shard of glass in his face when all of a sudden one of his buddies sees you. The music gets louder and the chase is on until you can hide into the shadows again.

It isn't difficult as much as it's suspenseful. I take that back, it can be both really. Just some levels are different from others. Born Again is probably the best level.

The graphics are fine. It's more or less Vice City's graphics just in a darker setting and with different animations and whatnot. The ""Noise FX"" adds to the game's atmosphere by making it look like you're on camera at all time. Which you are! How else does Starkweather film your kills? :)

Play this game at night, all the lights OFF, with some good gaming headphones on to FULLY get the Manhunt experience.

I will seed forever!   "

,DarkHeart69,2010-12-11T00:29Z,"this link should be banned when you beat the game it brings up homo porn so whatever faggot made this needs to get his fucking head chopped off, and he needs to burn in hell."
,DarkHeart69,2010-12-11T00:35Z,"@GWpirateGW
Just because you're gay doesn't mean you can make us watch your faggot porn you sick fuck don't make an auto link at the end of a game with that shit!! You need to die."
,hardcore111,2010-12-23T20:18Z,some people say that this game will scare that you will never play it again but that is not true
