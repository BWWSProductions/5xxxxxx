â€œSteal This Filmâ€ it`s a 2006 documentary movie. The movie is a blistering review of how internet piracy is revolutionizing the film industry â€“ was a word-of-mouth phenomenon attracting over five million downloads. With this official release Jamie King looks again at how Pirate Bay â€“ a peer-to-peer website enabling users to download pirated material â€“ grew from a basement in Mexico to a threat to the entertainment industry, and the catalyst of an international dispute involving the WTO, dawn-raids from the police, and the American and Swedish governments.
