[V],twentyforty,2010-01-09T18:11Z,"Here is new Schedule:

:)"
,sassymoon,2010-01-10T07:51Z,"thanks twenty, for the sked release. i have a big request- season 1 of ""hustle"" if you have it (if i am not mistaken, it's a uk series and it seems interesting). whether you up or not, thanks for reading this ;)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-10T09:03Z,"@sassymoon: Yes. But, do you know that currently running is Season 6? Just sayin'...
I have Season 1 UNCUT.DVDrip (6 episodes) - but the times of  S1 UK groups haven't released 720p yet -so, expect little lower quality.
Further, if all this is OK to you, please let me know exact time when you would be ready for download. Be aware that mad-house starts on Monday and the requests may go just on weekends + Mondays. However, it cannot be immediately or tomorrow because TPB upload is broken (again) for last 24h and I am seriously delayed by that."
,lilars26,2010-01-10T16:41Z,"HI 20/40,miss you...hope everything gets sorted out soon.It seems that there are a lot of problems at the Bay.I wonder if it's because of all the new traffic since the demise of your old home."

JUST CROSIN MY FINGERS N WISHING U TO DO IT A.S.A.P.
n dude dnt wry .. v will [or atleast i] promise to seed only ur torrents if u hv such issues of limited uploading/time"
,sassymoon,2010-01-10T22:09Z,"hi again twenty. yes, i know ""hustle"" is up to season 6(?) already but never watched it so i thought i'd start with s1. anytime you're free, no rush to up. thanks much!!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-10T22:50Z,"OK sassy, files (6 episodes) are 1.16 GB (""originals"" were 4.24 GB). Re-encoding has been finished 2h ago. But we need 8-9 hours to bring them up. Here is what you should do: 
1. Tell me EXACT time -  for instance 9:25 AM Monday (NZDT) - Time in Wellington, New Zealand. Here is now 9.25 PM and you can get the picture. I propose YOUR afternoon (12 AM - 8 PM NZ time) because its night-time by me and - quiet.
2. STOP during that download any other torrents.
3. Put download AND upload speed on ""Unlimited"". I know it may hurt your Internet-allowance but I'll not be able to help if seeding script automatically kick you out because of to low ul/dl ratio in that swarm. I'll be sleeping. right?
So... tell me - not now - but in the next few days."
,valu59er,2010-01-10T23:03Z,"OK Hi 2040
Is the TPB is down?
Here in OZ where I live I love your torrents as you know.
SO we lost you on mini nova are we having probs with TPB now.
I can see I'm about to have a steep learning curve
in the accessing of share ware
All the good shows are about to start it's 6.40 am Mon 11th.(how appropriate lol)
Will you be able to get BH and other shows?is this just a glitch? or a serious shut TPB down bid?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-10T23:30Z,"@valu59er: Basically (as far I can see) TPB works for normal users, according to their saying this morning, site WAS broken, and now they should fix the upload. Funny tough, I can see that some torrents (very few) have been uploaded during this down-time, but now only thing I can is to cross my fingers and wait. I am already in some sort of troubles concerning requests, and I hate to be put in position of ""broken promises"".
""How serious"" it is, I have no clue, I have seen only one-liner about down-time and fixing like any other TPB visitor.
Well... again, as last week, waiting for Godot..."
,valu59er,2010-01-10T23:58Z,"OK thanks sounds like a waiting game 
tried to get on tpb to dl being human and couldn't access couldn't access if you arn't dling a show I want I go to eztv.. noone home there either...
Sad and tragic..no tv access where I live in OZy bush..Well not too tragic.. creeks to swim in grow great food..but love my few shows "
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-11T07:42Z,"Well:

""Right now the captcha is broken. Only VIP and Staff can upload until it is fixed.""

I am none of that. I still get no Captha jpg from upload server. As I can see uploads going, but not for me. Sorry."
,stev666,2010-01-11T14:07Z,Hey 20-40 i found a chucks03e01 H264 on another site and it says its a 20-40 upload it this correct?
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-11T14:51Z,"@stevxxx: Yes, when mini went nova, before I get here I went there. It is not ""healthy"" place for ""untrained"" individuals - but, since I cannot upload on TPB, I released Chuck s03e01 there."
,stev666,2010-01-11T15:00Z,"cool thanks for the quik reply, is there any other places we can find some of your upps while TPB is down?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-11T15:28Z,@sanyam: check your yahoo mail.
,lilars26,2010-01-11T19:26Z,"This isn't fair to you or to us.It seems that the pink skull comes with limitations.Though,you are ""pretty in pink"",I guess green is the goal.Maybe you should take the v.i.p.'s out to tea.Have a great day 20/40 and we miss you."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-11T21:50Z,"Thanks for support. Meanwhile, I was ""forced"" to release first two Chucks and The Road...

Currently I am playin' with black/blue&white TS of Daybreakers, but it is so bad that I guess nothing will come out of it (pretty much as all f-ud up CAMs and TS lately.
 Numbers (req), Legend of the Seeker, Silent Wittnes and Desp. Hw. sources have been downloaded and re-encoded back in early morning, couple of hours after airing, in hope that TPB allows upload to at least trusted uploaders without broken Captcha server/script. 

It hasn't happened so far, and maybe never will, but, I am with you in deprivation, and all my work last night is for nothing - tomorrow starts new day and people will forget what was on Sunday...

Btw lilars, for green one must be long time trusted uploader, it is great privilege here, but I unfortunately, have not enough time left on disposal."
,sassymoon,2010-01-11T22:40Z,just posting to say hi...and hope they fix whatever's wrong with tpb...stay well 2040
,valu59er,2010-01-11T23:32Z,"Good luck 2040
What do you have to do to get a green skull?
and what do the blue skulls mean?"
,lilars26,2010-01-12T00:05Z,"Well,you can only do what you can do,especially when forces are beyond your control.Maybe get a good night's sleep,as tomorrow may bring a busy day.Good luck to all of us."
