,grayscales,2010-01-13T00:06Z,Hi Twenty.  Would you happen to have episodes 9 and 10 as well?  The last I got from you was #8.  Thanks.
,jon4fun,2010-01-13T05:22Z,"To all people downloading this particluar file (& all 20-40 files) - a warning and a PLEA!

20-40 has dropped this show from his schedule becuse of grab & run shitheads.
It is only here now as he had some time in his schedule due to xmas.

IF you DownLoad then SEED; and he MIGHT (if we're lucky) consider putting it back in the schedule IF he sees the proper response and respect.

The choice is OURS!

Share and we MAY be able to get this show from 20-40 again otherwise it will be back too large file sizes.

Jon
P.S. sorry if I stepped on your toes here 20-40. I know I didn't ask you before my statement."
,grayscales,2010-01-13T06:23Z,"Gosh Jon, I'm currently sharing 17 of 2040's files right now.  I go to at least a 1.0 ratio, and more if it looks like I won't exceed my bandwidth limit within a given month.  I got billed an extra $24 for going over my limit in December.

2040 is a gem of an uploader.  I got Sanctuary S02E1-8 from him and just thought I'd ask about E9-10.  I must have missed his comment re dropping the show due to h&r shitheads."
,jon4fun,2010-01-13T06:59Z,"Hi grayscales,
This was NOT directed at you. Sorry, if I came off that way, totally unintentional. As you are the only person who even bothered to leave a comment it may have appeared as if I was attacking you. I wasn't!

This is a general comment to ALL the downloaders of 20-40 files but specifically Hit & Runners!

20-40 dropped this show from his schedule after E8 and the reason was as stated above about hit & runners.

He is a one-man show who works very hard to try to please as many people as possible. When people (H&R DL's) abuse this work he gets upset and rightly so. However, we ALL suffer due to H&R's not seeding. I don't understand your mentality people (you know who you are). If everyone did this then the entire peer network would not/could not exist.

His files are small and high quality, which is what we ALL like, so it should be no issue to seed to at least 100%.

Anway, once again, this is to everyone NOT any individual. PLEASE SEED or fuck off and don't download the files in the first place.

Jon

P.S. Sorry 20-40 & all his fans. If you read this I'm now getting off my soap box and putting away my indignation."
,jon4fun,2010-01-13T07:04Z,"Hi grayscales,
Just one thing I meant to ask. Does your ISP charge you for uploads and downloads or is it a combined cap?

Just wondering, as my ISP, and most that I have come across, only charge for download.
If you are getting charged for uploads and you have a choice of a different ISP you might want to consider changing.

Just a thought. I don't know your country or circumstance etc. so ignore as you please.

Cheers
Jon"
,grayscales,2010-01-13T08:44Z,"Hi Jon.

Sorry, I guess I did take your comment a little personally, coming as it did next after my file request.   Your point is valid, and I hope it gets across to those hit-and-runners out there.  Keep that soapbox handy  : )

Re my Canadian ISP - 10 mbps cable with 60 GB/month total bandwidth (up and down), and $2/GB overage charge.  I recently downgraded from 95 GB/mo to save some bucks, lol.

,lilars26,2010-01-13T23:12Z,Hi Grayscales I'm in southern Ont. and I deal with cogeco.I have the 60 gig upload/download package.My download speed is advertised as up to 14mb/s but I don't think I've ever hit that.I can't find my upload speed.But it rarely gets above 10.Would you have any idea what it should be?
,zangelic,2010-01-14T04:03Z,"So just to clarify, VLC media player has no trouble with this? Cause I've been getting my Sanctuary from EZTV but I want 720p and he keeps changing the names of his torrents and I don't want to mess around with standard def stuff. If 20-40 can get me Shows in the same quality consistently, I have no trouble supporting him. :D"
,jon4fun,2010-01-14T04:52Z,"Hi zangelic,
Main point - qaulity. ALL of 20-40 files are as good as HD as you can get with the file size.
Try it and find a difference, I dare you. The main difference is bitrate but if you want the technical details read back (way back) through his comments in all his uploads.

Secondly, it is an .mp4 file so of course VLC will play it.

Lastly, he will not encode and seed if the file is not shared. Sanctuary is already off the list but it MAY (I  haven't asked and he hasn't said and it is not in schedule) come back if people will share.

Therefore, if you download then please seed.

I PROMISE you will not be disappointed with the quality.

Cheers
Jon"
,grayscales,2010-01-14T08:35Z,"Hi Lilars26.

I'm also in southern Ont., less than 15 km from the CN Tower. I currently have Rogers Hispeed Express, advertised as 10.0 Mbps dl, 512 Kbps ul.

You could try www.speedtest.net.  I typically get 9.7 Mb/s dl, .320 Mb/s ul from a test server less than 50 miles away.  I pause my torrent client when I do the tests.

[V],twentyforty,2010-01-14T13:33Z,"Guys, we are all friends here. Everything is said, and we all agree about. YOU are not the problem. I know all of you by screen-names - because only DOZEN people communicate through comments. Others do not care, do not speak, talk or articulate anything but few screams how my files are fake or have some ridiculous proposals.

Well, they are THE REST, in full meaning of the word. BUT, I am here because and for - them.
Small, anonymous, scared, lying, colorful bunch of few thousand creatures, who crawls-out only to grab some food and crawl back in small worlds they ""live"" so called life.
I get pissed by small majority, but trust me, 98% of ""others"" do not know how humans should act. We are, the humans, by nature grabbers, hustlers and predators.

I do not wont to be one of ""them"". 

I am here because I might show them something, anything, how one guy CAN feed thousands of people (not with 7 fishes) even if he have no income (almost, if I can call my 160 cents per day ""an income""), even if he have ridiculously debilitating slow upload (my peaks are 70 kB/s) IF one knows how and have a heart on the right place."
,lilars26,2010-01-14T14:22Z,Thanks 20/40 and thank you grayscales.I am 9 months new to the computer and 6 months new to file sharing.I appreciate learning the proper protocols.
