Don Quichotte, composed by Ludwig Minkus for the Bolshoi in 1869, was relatively unknown in the West 
until Nureyev's new choreography--which naturally gave him centre stage as Basile--was introduced at the Vienna State Opera in 1966. 
A later production in 1981 forms the basis for this 2002 success by the Paris Opera.
Don Quichotte is in some ways a misnomer for the ballet. Rather than being the dominant character, 
here the beloved hero of Cervantes' original novel and tilter at windmills is a catalyst for the troublesome events 
which beset the love story of Basile and Kitri. 
The dream in which the knight encounters the queen of the dryads becomes a glittering fault in the narrative. 
But there is no doubting the fluid delights of the pas de deux between Basile (Manual Legris) and Kitri (the enchanting AurÃ©lie Dupont), 
always literally several steps ahead of their would-be romance spoilers, 
which rather overshadow the pathos of Jean-Marie DidiÃ¨re's Quichotte. 
Nureyev's triumph, though, remains the teeming ensemble dances that reaffirm the close marriage between Minkus's score and the unfolding drama, 
here immeasurably enhanced by Alexandre Beliaev's Goya-esque designs. 
Ermanno Florio's musical direction keeps the pace light and busy.
