    The italian theatrical was italiano. This is the real English.           
                                                                             
    Horrific violence, filmed as it happened!                                
                                                                             
    Here's a National Geographic style documentary that's alternately        
    exploitive and informative. The film presents a wide variety of ways     
    that humans interact with nature. It depicts the actual footage of a     
    careless man (Pit Dernitz) leaving the safety of his car to film         
    lions close up and ends up being their dinner. Other highlights          
    include natives humping the ground in hopes of bringing life to the      
    land, various big game hunting and last but not least naked hippies.
