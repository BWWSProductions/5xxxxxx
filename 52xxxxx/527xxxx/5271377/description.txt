Release Date: 11 Januray 2010
Release Length: 01:27:15
Storyline: It is the story of one Mr. Fox and his wild-ways of hen heckling, turkey taking and 
cider sipping, nocturnal, instinctive adventures. He has to put his wild days behind him and do what fathers do best: be responsible. 
He is too rebellious. He is too wild. He is going to try "just one more raid" on the three nastiest, meanest farmers that are Boggis, 
Bunce and Bean. It is a tale of crossing the line of family responsibilities and midnight adventure and the friendships and awakenings 
of this country life that is inhabited by Fantastic Mr. Fox and his friends.
