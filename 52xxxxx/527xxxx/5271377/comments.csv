,oldSMfan,2010-01-12T00:08Z,"Excellent rip once again SM!! What can we say, M8! It's been a hell of a new year already!! However, I will give this one a miss!

,oldSMfan,2010-01-12T00:11Z,"@dheltem
Sorry M8! I apologise! Got carried away, I guess! My honest mistake!

It is just that I use Vista/VLC without any ""extra"" codecs, and do not burn/convert or anything of the like, and have never had any problems with SM's rips!! So it does get to me when PPL use this and that, do this and that, and then say something's no quite right!

Cheers!

,McCrusty,2010-01-12T13:56Z,"@.BONE.

Don't use VLC, it's pretty buggy.  Use KMP, it play HD videos much, much smoother and has a higher tolerance than VLC, for errors in encodes. 

Keep in mind that VLC, was never really meant to be a general purpose media player!

Download KMP, here: http://www.filehippo.com/download_kmplayer/

Also, make sure to ""opt-out"" of the Ask toolbar crap. "

Are you retarded or something?

This animation technique  isn't 7 but more than 80 years old. It's called stop motion. Look it up on wikipedia.

This movie is fantastic. 

Cheers for the upload."

Awfull film, kids hated it after 20 mins. So did I."
,micelestium,2010-01-19T20:12Z,"Thanks, was waiting for this one, big fan of stopmotion movies  \(^_^)/"
,FoxNeko,2010-01-24T06:09Z,"@lucky

This movie is a great film. Its not really intended for children. Its more of a relax based movie. Just something to watch. Not to get all excited about. It is really funny is a British way. Well that's exactly what it is British humor.

On a side note, my kids had no problems understanding the humor and they enjoyed it. Its hard keeping a class of 5 year old' still. This movie did it. Better than Sponge Bob that's for sure. That junk will make kids stupid.

GREAT MOVIE!"
