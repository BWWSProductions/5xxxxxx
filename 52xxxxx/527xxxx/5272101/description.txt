One of the greatest plays by Spain's most innovative 20th-century
dramatist, `Divine Words' is set in Valle-Inclan's native Gallecia,
the Celtic corner of north-west Spain. It presents a grotesque,
distorted picture of rural life, a  primitive society where
amorality,avarice, adultery and cowardice flourish.
