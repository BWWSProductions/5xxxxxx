,pjllb1983,2010-01-15T04:42Z,"ok Porkster, once again: 

the files are RealMedia streams, which means they're containers for streaming video content, not actual videos.

also, several files means... several videos!

now, ""streaming"" means you don't actually own the content on your hard drive, it is instead played in real-time over the internet - hence the reduced file size.

if you'd like to download the videos themselves you can google 'rm stream download', which to be honest is the way you should've gone originally.

am i going too fast?

it's not rocket science, you know... if you can't figure this out by yourself, maybe you shouldn't be looking up MIT Physics in the first place."
