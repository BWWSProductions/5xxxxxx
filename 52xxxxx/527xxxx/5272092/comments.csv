,Sweeper789,2010-01-12T17:32Z,thank you
,scatattack,2010-01-12T22:53Z,"Thanks for the up, but after watching this and reading the comments, I can see why this show was unaired. Fringe is sort of shit anyway, but I still watch it (like heroes), but this episode has gone to a new low. This episode will give you a wake up call as to the tripe you're watching. fuck fringe"
,Xander_Dean_Macio,2010-01-13T02:09Z,Yes  this is not s2e11.. this is a previously unaired ep from season 1.. s2e11 will be shown on thursday... i recomend the mods change the title or move it to the season 1 folder to avoid further mix ups...  so yes charlies still dead and he aint coming back.. unless ofcorse the charlie with the scar on his face from the other reality crosses over .. but i doubt thatll happen

So, after 2x10, the right next episode will be 2x12."
,breakercase24,2010-01-17T17:40Z,"i've been confused bec. some say its an unaired s1 ep. but ive waited too long already... wil d/l, seed for i know eztv is the best!thanks in advance!"
,P2P_DownUnder,2010-01-22T12:39Z,Thanks ;)
[V],maestral,2010-04-30T20:09Z,"This episode was aired as S2E11, and it was unaired episode from S1. You can read all about it on wikipedia. So this one is really S2E11, even if its S1 episode"
