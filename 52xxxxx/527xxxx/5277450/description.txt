Batman: Journey Into Knight examines how Batman turned from a semi optimistic crime fighter into the cynical Dark Knight.  When the story begins, Bruce Wayne has been Batman for awhile and now he's starting to feel the pull of a normal life and the attraction of a life of pleasure.  This leads Bruce to start having doubts about his career as a costumed crime fighter. 

Written by Andrew Helfer and illustrated by Tan Eng Huat.
