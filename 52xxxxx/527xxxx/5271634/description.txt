BBC James May's Toy Stories 3of6 Meccano PDTV x264 576p AC3 MVGroup

James May is out to prove why traditional, old-fashioned toys are still relevant by pushing them to the limit in spectacular, supersize challenges.

Episode 3 - Meccano
James joins forces with Edwina Currie to build a full-size bridge from nothing but Meccano. Top engineers pitch incredible designs, but the project soon careers out of control when the Meccano does not arrive and James realises the structure will take longer to build than he imagined. A last-minute accident also means that James's bridge may never see the light of day.
