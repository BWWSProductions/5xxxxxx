,sybilfault,2010-01-14T05:12Z,"like moribito, I, too, wonder if this is any better a copy than all the problematic ones floating about. I will get back w/ a report once it dl--if someone else doesn't do it first. thanks,"
,purplecds,2010-01-14T10:48Z,Thank you
,moribito,2010-01-14T12:06Z,It's TOXIC V2 release with very bad quality a complete failure.
,lucidpaul,2010-01-14T15:08Z,I'd still try my luck and dowload it to see if moribito isn't lying motherfucker
,sybilfault,2010-01-14T17:38Z,"moribito is Not lying. I just dl this and watched it some. usually secret myth is pretty great w/ quality, but if this was a real ""DVDScr"" then the source must have been horrible, b/c this is very low quality. audio is almost incomprehensible and image is very, very grainy. I appreciate the effort--esp. since I don't have the means or sys. to be ripping/uploading stuff--but I will seek for some better quality of this film.

,SERZT42,2010-01-14T17:58Z,slightly better than toxic version 2.still crappy image.but thanks anyway.

,shamannl,2010-01-15T14:18Z,Thanks in advance!
,LouFerrari,2010-01-16T07:01Z,"Secret-myth, thanks for the effort here, because you deserve kudos for getting the ""complete"" Road movie uploaded on this -- especially since there were so many ULs that were ""movie-interrupted"" immitations.

Howevr, I'd have to tell DLs out there that the video quality is only about a 4 due to pixellation and foggy/grainy quality taking out the definition in the film.  Still, I give the audio about a 7 because that does come in wel.

You still deserve a lot o credit for being one of the ULs to present the complete running version of this flick.  Cheers!"
,ptv83,2010-01-16T08:46Z,"v:2 A:2 ... waist of bandwidth, why upload such crappy rips?? i'd rather watch a TS than this ""DVDScreener"" .. .this aint nothing i'd put my name next to. have some pride, or put ""shitty rip"" in the title next time."
,gustavo44,2010-01-16T13:54Z,THANK'S GRAT MOVIE =)
,flatusgass,2011-03-31T09:47Z,"Why are the days of nearly 2GB (and 2+ GB) STANDARD def movies still around? These people who rip, whom get such intense ass-sucking from clueless fanboys, are not really that great at what they do. I just watched two different 720p rips I got off Demonoid, which were an unbelievable 500MB! I figured they'd suck, but I was curious as to how bad they'd blow. Well, not at all, turns out. They were indeed 720p, not fuzzy/soft, and looked miles ahead of these ridiculous 2GB standard-def rips.

Really though, why arent more films being ripped in HD like that? There are people out there who clearly know how.

MORE 500MB HD RIPS!"
