Ramdev Yoga for Diabetes & Health (India, Hindi)

Yoga is an art of healthy living giftetd to this mortal world by ancient Indian Yogees after researches of thousands of years in the forests. 

It is believed that in ancient India the saints and yogees used to live for hundreds of years with complete fitness and die their desired death, only because of exercising Yoga in their daily life. Yoga is equally useful in the treatment of all deseases as well.

In modern era the sole credit goes to respected Baba Ramdev Jee for revival the ancient art of Yoga among common people. He not only popularised Yoga but made it available every where through different modes of communications. We ought to be grateful to the great Baba Ramdev jee.
