This is a really good torrent if you like hunter so... "
,Explicit_Content,2010-08-09T15:01Z,"Okey here is how you make it work.
Download you're own torrent and open it.
When it ask's where to save it. Set that to where you have all these files. You're torrent client will then think the download is done and start seeding.
And this is important. IT has to be exactly like whats in the torrent. It has to be a zip file. Exactly the size in the torrent.
Hope that helps. I really want this"
