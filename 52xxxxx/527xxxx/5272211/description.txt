Repo Man [1984] 

"The life of a repo man is always intense. "

Otto Maddox (Emilio Estevez), an alienated young punk rocker living in mid-1980s Los Angeles, is fired from his menial  supermarket stock clerk job. At a party, he finds his girlfriend having sex with his best friend. He soon finds that his  pot-smoking, ex-hippie parents have donated his college savings account to a televangelist, supposedly to supply Bibles to El  Salvador. Depressed and broke, Otto falls in with Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) a seasoned repossession agent, or "repo man",  working for the disingenuously named "Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation", a small-time automobile repossession agency.  While repelled by the concept at first, Otto's opinion is rapidly changed when he is paid cash for his first "job."
Otto soon learns that "the life of a repo man is always intense." He enjoys the drug use, real-life car chases, the thrill of  hot-wiring cars and good pay. His old punk rock lifestyle seems boring by comparison, and he begins to develop a rapport with  his fellow repo men as well. When he returns to a punk club to see a lounge act (played by real-life hardcore band Circle  Jerks), he is amazed at how terrible they now seem.
Soon, Bud, Otto and competing repo men all over town are searching for a 1964 Chevrolet Malibu from New Mexico, ludicrously  overvalued at $20,000 (about $41,000 in 2007 dollars); this vehicle, unknown to them, contains something mysterious and  dangerously powerful in its trunk, also sought by a strange female FBI agent, Agent Rogersz (Susan Barnes) and her staff.
The film draws on the experiences of director Alex Cox, who worked briefly as a repossession agent in Los Angeles, but soon  deviates into the surreal with aliens, the CIA, punk rocker thieves and other strange characters and situations, all amid a  long string of running gags and almost-impossible coincidences.
