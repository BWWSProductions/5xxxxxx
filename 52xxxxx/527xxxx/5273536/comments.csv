,TheSpenner,2010-03-15T05:30Z,"Uzone - A film will only be 1920x1080 IF it was shot in 16:9 aspect ratio like your TV is. Many widescreen films, are shot in 2.35:1 or 2.4:1 aspect ratios. So unless you want the sides of the film cropped off to fit your 16:9 TV, the picture fills your full 1920 width, and will be only 800-someodd pixels high. It's still ""1080p"" because it uses the full 1920 width."
,Uzone,2010-03-15T06:32Z,"The term 1080P means the film has 1080 lines of vertical resolution and that it's not interlaced. Has nothing to do with the horizontal resolution.

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p

Anyways. I've got a 16:9 plasma TV set, so I can't playback any films with an aspect ration different than this. Due to possible image-retention etc.

Bad luck. :P"
,TheSpenner,2010-03-15T20:05Z,"Well, yes, in the strictest sense of the phrase, 1080p means 1080 lines of vertical resolution. But in the real world any video with either the full 1080 vertical or 1920 width is ""full HD"", and your TV should display it fine with black bars on the top & bottom.

All consumer Plasma & LCD HDTVs are 16:9 (I also have a 50"" plasma). A source doesn't need to be exactly 16:9 for you to play it. If you're choosing not to play films that aren't 16:9 due to fear of image retention, you're going to miss out on a lot. Image retention isn't an issue with Plasmas anymore, unless you're playing the movie on a 24-hour loop. Your TV will be fine letterboxing for a couple of hours for a movie.
"
,Uzone,2010-03-16T15:34Z,"Guess you're right on this.

But still, I wouldn't like to risk the panel for the first few days. It has only played about ~40 hours so far. Its' price was well over my monthly pay, so... I prefer being a little bit overcautious.

,xiIix,2010-04-18T21:57Z,"Image retention, or ""image burn in"", does NOT exist anymore. They fixed this issue using pixel manipulation techniques about 7 years ago, maybe longer.

Unless your plasma TV is OLD; like I mean REALLY REALLY old, then it will not have image retention. There isn't one single solitary television set produced today that has image retention. Period. It's a thing of the past.

You could go buy a plasma right now, open it, and immediately stick in a DVD and leave it on the menu for TWO YEARS STRAIGHT, and it would not retain the image. I've seen plasmas, LCD's, projo's, DLP's and CRT's all sit with DVD menus on for hours and hours day after day when I worked at Best Buy, not one of them retained an image. It's just impossible, the panel simply will not let it happen.

Play whatever you want, but it doesn't matter, you're not doing your plasma any favors by playing specific ratios.

,fraekz,2010-06-11T01:38Z,"reine12,
Something wrong with your d'load.
I believe your d'load is still incomplete.
Some torrent downloader copy the file only after full download, until that it may show 0KB.

Usually the file immediately shows full sizes, say 10.2 GB immediately after you start download (occupying the disk space) but you can see the movie only when it is completed or nearly completed.

The torrent works fine for me.

All having dutch subs, except HBP which has Chinese in addition to English.

I am seeding at my full capacity of 42 Kbps upload speed."
,fraekz,2010-06-11T01:46Z,"Do any one what is the language of the subtitle file .srt file in this torrent.

English + Dutch subs are hardcoded into mkv

,Ibuxx,2010-06-12T12:38Z,1920 x 800 is NOT 1080p it is 800! when are you people going to get that in to your f..... heads???
,fraekz,2010-06-14T20:02Z,"Ibuxx,
If the same movie is viewed in 1920x 1080 wont it look stretched. I mean the the width should be 2590 if a resolution of 1080 should fit in vertical for a 2.4 aspect ratio movie.

We dont have resolutions more than 1920 common. Only special LCD monitors have such high HD resolutions like 2560.

What is the need for warnes bros to release a 2.4 aspect ratio movie in 2560x1080 is the LCD screens are not available in market.

Anyway in fully resized full screen condition, any smaller resolution than 1920 is gonna give good effect."
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-17T07:56Z,"i think the external srt's are chinese, but not 100% certain.  otherwise the subs's are as you stated above."
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-17T07:58Z,"by the way, 1080p or 720p is defined by width in movies, not by height, as height is a variable set by the director and his choice of lens."

,Metroidn1f,2010-06-25T22:20Z,"1080p does not necessarily mean that it is 1920x1080, it just means that the there is 1080 horizontal lines if I am correct, an the p means that it is progressive and now you should also know that the i means interlaced.  1080p is the source including the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen.  Everybody just knows that it is going to be 1920, because that is the highest screen size for for HD.  What you are seeing in these videos is 800p, which means that there was black lines on the top and bottom of the video source, but it was cropped.

If anything that I said was wrong, could someone please correct me?  I think I got the part wrong about the 1080 horizontal lines.  Sorry if I am wrong about that or anything else.

,trikki69,2010-07-11T11:56Z,"The higher number in screen resolution is always the witdh for 16:9 & 4:3 displays. This is the ammount of vertical lines/pixels spanning the width of the display.nA 1080p source would include black bars and everything on screen from the source. Cropping a source is not a good idea, it can lead to all kinds of problems when the modified image is played back. I\'m on the search for an untouched 1080p version of this."
,fraekz,2010-07-14T19:27Z,"@HarzamannIf the disk space is already occupied, I mean if the disk space has reduced by 60 GB then most probably the file resides in your disk. So try removing the torrent file from your bittorrent. Remember you should not click Remove torrent+data. You should click Remove torrent only.nThen reopen this torrent file in your bittorrent and when the save window pops up, just point to the same folder where your 0 Kb files are saved. If the data is already there, then it will start reading and updating the data and will convert into a 100% seed. Now check the data. If there is a small glitch in the data, it might get rectified while updating the data. This is just an idea you could try, I am not sure whether it will work.nnIf your disk space is not all reduced after downloading in both root drive and the drive in which you save the data, (I mean really 0 kb files) then probably you need to update your torrent software and download again."

Old MS-Dos used to do the same thing and it\'s all coming from path names being too long (thanks again M$).  To see your file, jump into the main folder where there are 6 Harry Potter folders, copy a folder, and past it wherever.  You\'re making a copy of the file (plan accordingly, if needed), but shortening the path name.  This may also work by just shortening the folder names, but you may also lose the data (if Windows acts screw like old dos).  Let us know if this works (it worked for me)."

That is happening because of the total length of all the filename's are too long, so you need to rename your filenames to something smaller (and less: . - [!{ ... symbols in it)
At first I couldn't rename the files directly so I used a 30 day freeware program called: XYplorer (http://thepiratebay.org/search/XYplorer/0/7/0)
It's does many things and will also let you rename any file.

,Metroidn1f,2010-12-02T02:52Z,"Okay, this is for everyone that is complaining that this is not 1080p.  Movies these days are usually shot in a 1.85:1 or 2.39:1 Aspect Ratio, so the picture its self can not have a height of 1080 unless you are a dumb ass and you want to stretch the video so everything either looks skinny or fat.  If your that person that is fine, you do it the wrong way, while we do it the right way.  People say that it is a 1080p rip, because the source is 1080p.  If you were to directly just rip the movie off of a blu ray disk, you would see that the picture size is 1920x1080 (If the blu ray is 1080p), but you will most likely see the black bars that are on the top and the bottom.  Most 1080p videos that you download crop off those annoying bars so you don't see them in previews and so it does not take up so much space when encoded.

I need someone to answer this question.
I just had to rewrite this whole thing because I got so confused.  So tell me if this is right, wrong or if it would make more sense.

To me, the 1920 means how many lines are going vertical because it has farther to go on the x axis then it does on the y axis if it was gong horizontal.  And same for the 1080, it is a smaller number, so it should be going horizontal because it does not have to go as far because the height is smaller then the width.

I know I did not word that well, but does anyone know what I mean and can explain that for me?"

i suggest you to have the QUADCORE.
i only have 2.0 dual core but it can handle 1080p, only limited up to 4mbps bitrate. never tried this huge one."

,InstantStarFan7,2011-01-17T21:06Z,THANK you GoodFilms! I really appreciate your hard work on this upload. I have been looking for the higher quality Harry Potter films and here it is! MANY THANKS!!!! I will seed as soon as this finishes! :)
,mj_wilankar,2011-01-23T13:04Z,Superb torrent! Really appreciate the efforts put by GoodFilms. Thank you very much. It took me 3 week and 4 days to finish the download. I only have 1mbps line that too 1:10 i.e. I get transfer rate of only 110 kbps! This torrent has the avg speed of 28.4 kbps in Mumbai. Thanks once again. And I am seeding.
,livenowman,2011-01-26T13:20Z,this is the best torrent ever and i have been downloading and seeding for over a month! its so slow please SEED!!
,Xmastah,2011-01-31T02:11Z,Plz Seed! this is the best HarryPotter movie pack=)
,InstantStarFan7,2011-02-03T15:44Z,"Okay 2 weeks and this finally finished downloading, so I'm excited to get to see these in BluRay quality! Thanks so very much GoodFilms for your hard work and upload!! One question, is anyone else having trouble with The Prisoner of Azkaban? I already remuxed the others to get the subs off (For my ps3) and Azkaban will not even play on the computer. When opened in a remux program it says the file is not valid. Way to fix? Thanks!"
,InstantStarFan7,2011-02-03T15:46Z,"AH! Crap crap! SORRY I did read through all the comments before posting, but I missed the one where my question was answered. Sorry about that. Thanks again! AWESOME QUALITY!!!!!!"
,InstantStarFan7,2011-02-03T16:07Z,"Ok so.. English Subs are removable in VLC, but ""act"" hardcoded in anything else. I transfer these to my PS3, but I can't get the english subs off and that's because I deleted the SRT file and removed the subtitles in mkvmerge.. Anyone else know what I can do to get the subs off? They can't be hardcoded if VLC will play them without."
,Beach_Ape,2011-02-05T22:50Z,mkv files. If you're going to convert them into something to play or burn - the english subtitles hard copy into the video - can't turn them off.
,Beach_Ape,2011-02-06T03:22Z,"YOU NEED LOT OF TIME - OR NOT. Read back through the comments about how long it takes to download - WEEK MINIMUM! There are a lot of dum dopes buying into the claim of 1080p Blue ray with this. Then you find quality is no better than other good rips BUT the subtitles can only be turned off while playing as mkv. Convert to anything else and you get an English speaking movie with English subtitles hardcoded - wtf mofo

A week to download and converting takes a day and night and morning. I deleted it all because of the hardcoded subshit, and then found all six @ http://thepiratebay.org/user/YIFY/

Same quality - downloaded in 3 hours - wtf again mofo!"
,yopepoy,2011-02-08T07:15Z,@Beach_Ape those videos are very low bitrate and obviously a lot less of quality. i prefer poppedtart or kingdom release(secretmyth)
,Rodan.H,2011-02-11T13:02Z,Does anybody know when the deathly hollows in 1080p will be released?
,randomdents0204,2011-02-18T22:30Z,Good DL.  I'll open up my pipes on this until I get a good ratio on this torrent.  Anyone currently downloading should get decent speeds for the next few days.
,leeroyjenkinsv8,2011-03-09T02:04Z,fuckin punks
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-19T21:46Z,you can remove subs with mkvmerge

,fraekz,2011-04-03T17:33Z,"@InstantStarFan7
Azkaban works fine in my computer. I am able to extract (Mkvextract) and mux (MEGUI) as well. Try initiating the torrent again (point to the same save address where your files are present), It will start checking all the downloaded files for completeness, and if few bytes of the file are missing/corrupted, it will try to re-download the same. In this way you can be sure that your download is complete."
,jauser,2011-04-09T22:00Z,"I'm now 10 years older than I was when I first download this, SEED MORE asses

thanks (:"
,melinator95,2011-08-02T22:22Z,"I really must say ""!Job well done!"" You covered everything from 1080p, DTS and DUTCH SUBS (no idea how hard it is to find torrents with NL Sub AND decent seeders) 60GB really is worth it.
(Maybe a thought, but when nr. 7 (pt 1 & 2) arrives on Blu-Ray you could upload that too?)"
,melinator95,2011-08-02T22:24Z,"@zorenzo

This is .mkv, the other one is .mp4
Better for PS3 (or ATV in my case) It depends on what you plan to watch this: computer or something else, the choice is yours."
