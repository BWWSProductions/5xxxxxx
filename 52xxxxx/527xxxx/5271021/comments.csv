CONGRATULATIONS!"
,oldSMfan,2010-01-10T23:30Z,"RE whitephantom & TommyBlade2018

I've NEVER had any sunc problems whatsoever with SM's rips!!!

I believe the only thing out out sync around here sometimes are people's heads and brains that cannot function together!

As alsways C .... just perrrrfect, M8!

Any chance you will be releasing This is it? I only ask this because there is a good version out there but I would prefer yours! 

Cheers!

:O)

PS: Hey mecyanide! Wow, were you off the map?! How's everything, M8?! SM keeps 'em coming ... all's good!"
,SouthBay77,2010-01-11T00:58Z,"Now the past 3 up loads  kindom released wont play on wtv live at all.
anyone on way 
thanks"
,dheltem,2010-01-11T01:09Z,"Seriously? You haven't noticed a 4 1/2 second audio lag on Whip It and about 1 1/2 seconds on Post Grad?

I've tried them on three separate computers, with both the latest ffdshow and the CoreAVC 2.0 codecs... same results.

I think 1) you should learn English a little better before you start slinging insults, and 2) there is something wrong either with SM's recent encode process, or with the source he/she/they used."
[V],McTav,2010-01-11T01:56Z,"@dheltem

I suggest you just go download the latest version of VLC player, stand alone thats all you need. and if there is still something wrong, chances are its on your end. I have not had any audio problems with any of SM's videos.

soooooo everyone with problems chances are you did something wrong"
,whitephantom,2010-01-11T02:20Z,"@dheltem

I probably speek english far better than you , and when I watch SM's rips , I dont use any kind of subtitles or synchronisation , so if there was any kind of audio lag believe me I will notice that , but there is none (Whip It & Post Grad included), and yes I use as always VLC player, maybe you should try that instead of spreading disinformation about SM's releases."
,rudavites,2010-01-11T02:28Z,THANX AGAIN SECRET MYTH ^_^
,dheltem,2010-01-11T02:35Z,"@whitephantom

Did I say _you_ were slinging bad English insults? No. (also, it's ""speak"" and ""English"" not ""speek"" and ""english"").

Also, it's not disinformation...  ""The Invention of Lying"" and all releases prior to that are in sync.  ""Whip It"" and ""Post Grad"" are out of sync.  ""Carriers"" is in sync (just finished download), and I haven't finished downloading ""Zombieland"" yet, but I hope it's in-sync."

,whitephantom,2010-01-11T03:14Z,"@dheltem

Isn't a bit suspicious to you , that everybody else are saying that everything is OK , I'm telling you , I watched ""Whip It"" yesterday and it's fine , I mean if something is broken , is broken for everybody and for good , the fault must be on your side ."
,darin_god,2010-01-11T06:07Z,"Never had a sync issue, had a couple isolated problems. But things like this happen when you download/convert/burn movies.

Myth does everything right.

Thanks man, truly.

,SouthBay77,2010-01-11T06:26Z,"KINGDOM!!!!
 WHAT HAPPENED 
ALL YOUR LATEST BDRIPS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WDTV LIVE ANY MORE 
WHAT TO DO???
ANYONE NO THANKS"

,oldSMfan,2010-01-11T09:24Z,"@dheltem
You should go and tell your mum what to do instead of telling others. Have kids, and then you can boss order them.

Tha same thing that has been said to ""the_devious"", if you complain, I would love to see your rips! ... the problem is when I click on your username I do not get any!? Now that's strange! One would think that you are a master a this from the comments you post!

Also, learn how to use a PC and different software!

Cheers whitephantom!

,ryouka19,2010-01-11T16:36Z,thanks
,countryboy78,2010-01-11T17:04Z,"Everyone,

Dheltem is not imagining things.  Whip It and Post Grade BRIP's from Secretmyth are out of sync for me as well.  The video is a few seconds a head of the audio for me.

Another member stated the same thing and he said ti was a codec issue for him.

I downloaded and installed the latest Klite package and these two movies are still out of sync.

Every other movie from Secretmyth is in sync and I've downloaded a lot of Secretmyth movies, so i'm not sure what happened to these two movies.

I took the advice of a member stating to use ConvertXtoDVD and it fixed the out of sync issue on Whip It!

Beforte people start bashing me for stick up for Dheltem, I'm a loyal follower and fan of Secretmyht and I think he does a lot of great work.

I am just stating i had the same issue as Dheltem wioth regards to Whip It and Post Grad and I know a few other members did as well.

So cut Dheltem some slakc he wasn't dissing Secretmyth from what I gather he is a loyal follower of Secretmyth as well, he was just asking about an out of sync issue which I has as well."
,wardroid,2010-01-11T19:46Z,"King you ROCK. 
Thanks a million."
,westpoint22,2010-01-11T23:31Z,Out of sync problem with Whip It and Post Grade BRIP's is not a Myth. Any day gives more surreal bugs with anything that is not KMPlayer or VLC Player (as honestly promised secret_myth). Been forced to using KMPlayer (VLC sucks - no shaders postprocessing). Sad.
,oldSMfan,2010-01-12T00:11Z,"@dheltem
Sorry M8! I apologise! Got carried away, I guess! My honest mistake!

It is just that I use Vista/VLC without any ""extra"" codecs, and do not burn/convert or anything of the like, and have never had any problems with SM's rips!! So it does get to me when PPL use this and that, do this and that, and then say something's no quite right!

Cheers!

:O)"
,Unbobbed,2010-01-12T02:27Z,"@ people having audio out of sync issues

It seems to have something to do with klcodec pack, and the way secretmyth encodes his/her recent videos (starting from whip it) because I went to http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/ and installed ONLY MPC (without codec) and the audio was in sync. So for people that are having problems, try uninstalling klcodec and install ONLY MPC."
,countryboy78,2010-01-12T03:52Z,"Unbobbed,

Thank you for the advice I have been having issues with Secretmyth's most recent BRIP's and I have Klite codecs installed so I will try your suggestion!

This is the way the community should act, when Dheltem was commenting he was only asking for help.

Aside from Devious I think we are all Secretmyth supporters and appreciate his hard work and excellent quality.

Thanks again 

Unbobbed"
,dheltem,2010-01-16T19:54Z,"I think this was mentioned somewhere, but if you're having sync problems you can also use YAMB to re-mux the video and audio streams.  Just loosely follow SM's already included 2-channel process (use 2 or 6 channel, whichever you want) and in the video stream's properties change ""Media Delay"" by how far off the audio is. (2000 for Zombieland, 4500 for Whip It, etc)."
