Lovely electropop album from Solvent.
with a lovely couple o' remixes from Skanfrom and Lowfish
Recorded from vinyl, which makes it sound better :)

More interesting vinyl on the way.

A lot of this music has been very special to me.
I am uploading because i believe the music industry will change.
but i also believe that the artist deserves to benefit from their talent.

If you like it, BUY IT, send money to the artist, buy some merch, go see them live, etc
