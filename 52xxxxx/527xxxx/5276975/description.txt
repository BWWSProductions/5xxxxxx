A Note from Dr. Robert Anthony:

We have all purchased self-help books, audio programs and taken seminars that were supposed to improve our performance and change our lives. After completing them, we were highly motivated and even made temporary changes, only to find that within a few days or a few weeks we were right back to where we were before!

Why? Because they did not show us how to make permanent and lasting changes. The solutions are often like putting frosting on a spoiled cake. No matter how good the frosting looks, we have to deal with what's underneath the frosting. The frosting is positive thinking, and the cake is our unworkable beliefs that keep us from producing positive results.

This material is about producing positive results. It's about taking our ideas and dreams and turning them into reality.

If you are looking for a no-nonsense methodology that goes beyond positive thinking then this material will be of great value to you.

You have in your hands a proven formula for success that will enable you to go beyond positive thinking to produce the results you desire. 

   	
5.0 out of 5 stars The Real Thing, November 2, 2006
By 	Sally Atman (Redondo Beach, CA United States)
This review is from: Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want (Hardcover)

If you read a lot of self improvement books and find the same information presented again and again, try Robert Anthony's material. All the newer "gurus" like Tony Robbins and Joe Vitale blatantly took Robert Anthony's material and re-wrote it. Badly.
There may be typos in this particular book, but it's straightforward, easy to read, and is well-written (unlike most of the more modern hype).
My daughter is a thirty-eight year old going for her PhD in Psych. She reads everything she can get her hands on regarding self help, self improvement, etc., and she's been complaining that everything is beginning to sound alike. I gave her a copy of Beyond Positive Thinking, and she loved it.
Buy this book. Enough said. 

   	
5.0 out of 5 stars Everyone can benefit from this book, June 27, 2005
By 	Wesley Spear "Political Sports" (Bethany, CT USA)
This review is from: Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want (Paperback)

I truly believe that every person can learn a great deal about themselves by reading and implementing the recommendations in this book. I would reiterate what many of the other reviewers mentioned here. Take more control of your life and put it on a better track to not only achieve your goals but interact with the world.
That said I would like to say to the author that this is absolutely the worst edited book I have ever read. There are so many examples of a "the" that should be "he" or and "of" that is in a sentence that shouldn't be there, or similar grammatical mistakes. Interestingly these are not errors that would be picked up by a spell checker in a word processor.
Despite that, the book can truly change our life. It is all up to you. 

   	
5.0 out of 5 stars Deep but Simple and Real, September 25, 2005
By 	John Hurt (Texas, USA) 
This review is from: Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want (Paperback)

*Post review EDIT* The Title 'Beyond positive thinking' is explained in the book to mean something along these lines: The idea of thinking positive is flawed in a very fundamental way. Many times when we are confronted with a situation in our lives that cause us pain, we are encouraged to think positive about some aspect of that situation so that we can find some peace about it. But finding the positive in a painful situation doesnt help us to solve the underlying problem that caused us the pain, it just gives us a coping mechanism. The concept of going 'Beyond Positive Thinking' teaches you to see the situation for what is really happening and then discovering the root of what is causing the pain so that we can then focus on the solution to that problem that is causing the pain. The way that this book teaches you how to do that is described below in my origional post *End EDIT*
I have been reading and skimming success books for some time now, I am fairly young, but the subject of perceiving reality as it truly is really interests me. One of my goals is to become a master of my thoughts and emotions. This book is really helpful if you are interested in finding the truth in any situation in your life.
Many times in people relationships there are many different perspectives... what this book teaches is how to get to the truth of the situation by seeing around the perspectives we place on situations in our lives. The focus on the book is to get you to understand that we all have our own way of interpreting reality, but our interpretations are filtered through our accumulated experiences and therefore are not processed by the mind as they really are, but as we perceive them to be. If we can become aware of our environment in a present moment awareness and a willingness to not judge positive or negative of any situation, then we are more apt to see things as they truly are and we will then understand the truth of the moment and then have the ability to respond accordingly to it. Basically it replaces the idea of thinking positive or negative with the concept of 'Right thinking' and 'Wrong thinking.
Also this book teaches you not to judge yourself or anyone else for that matter. It teaches you to replace your judgements of yourself with 'observation of yourself'. In other words, if we will just watch how we act in certain situations, we can learn so much about the way we think. If you feel yourself getting anxious in a certain situation, dont panic about it, Calmly watch the situation unfold and do not judge yourself over it. Allow yourself to be anxious and see yourself as you go through it. Then learn from it! That is what it is all about....
Like I said, the book is Deep, but it is written in a very Simple format and the ideas here will strike you with stunning clarity. There is no hype in this book; just plain speech.
If you are looking for a book that teaches the fundamentals of the human mind and how to overcome fear and all other human folly, then I would sincerely recommend you buy this book then read it twice!
