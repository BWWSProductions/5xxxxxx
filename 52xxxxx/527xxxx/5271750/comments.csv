,dougaldog2002,2010-01-12T13:20Z,"You're welcome, Stevearno!

I remember seeing this when I was 11 and being wowed by all the detail. Now it's all CGI, nothing like in camera.

Cheers!

I`m sure you have plenty of them, you need to be more specific.rnrnI have a Masters in English & I\'m pretty sure I have a pretty good idea as to how to talk to others and a far wider vocabulary than you`ll ever have.rnrnAs a `pirate`who never shares or uploads anything, and one that also spams others torrents with negativity, what gives you the right to question the quality of my torrents? Either download or not, it`s your choice. No-one else seems to mind the quality, just you.rnrnNow, about that \""stupid answer\""? I\'d love to hear it!"

[V],rambam1776,2011-06-12T21:44Z,"First, many thanks to dougaldog2002 for a very well crafted technical upload. However, the size of the rip and the nature of the film quality from the 1970s makes this a rather granulated looking visual. I'm afraid that a 1.4 gig container and the ratio selected just make for a bad video quality here.

It's a fine offer, and when so many people are still constrained by bandwidth and so forth, it deserves to stay well seeded. There is also a Blu-ray rip available, but at over 10 gig, that is too large for many. I am going to try a fresh rip on my copy of the DVD, and see if I can offer a companion torrent to this one at higher visual quality.

To be clear, I am NOT griping! This is a great torrent, but the video (in this age of LCDs and Hi Res) is just too painful to watch for long. I encourage the OP to keep ripping films, but to use higher ratios for such long ones."
,loudgraham,2011-07-30T21:02Z,"i have downloaded it and plays very nice but how do i stop the commentary please. i am viewing it on windows media player as a freind is having a war themed day so want to burn it to dvd for him also.
