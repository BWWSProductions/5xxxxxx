In September 1944, flush with the success of the Normandy Invasion, the Allies confidently launched Operation Market Garden, a wild scheme intended to put an early end to World War II by invading Germany and smashing the Reich's war plants. However, a combination of battlefield politics, faulty intelligence, bad luck and worse weather led to disaster. A Bridge Too Far accurately recaptures the monumental scope, excitement and danger behind one of the biggest military gambles in history.
