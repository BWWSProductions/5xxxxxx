INTRODUCTION
*************
Hello everybody,

This is my first mod and a gift to TWC community - M2TW music mod "4winds". So give me a little respect lol
It adds many new music tracks to M2TW game. Imo music of the game is really important
as it immerses you into the atmosphere/era of the game and adds that additional variety.

I feel that I must somehow thank and pay tribute to the modders and members of this awesome TWc site
for their mods, hard work and efforts of improving an amazing M2TW game, thus as a thank I release this mod.

Why did I name it "4winds" you might ask. Well it's because M2TW campaign
and battle music is divided into roughly 4 areas:

*northern european (scotland, england, france, hre, denmark)
This music immerses you into a dark and cruel classical western medieval world
*eastern european (poland, hungary, russia)
similar to western style, but has that eastern and steppe flavour and a bit quicker tempo tracks.
*southern european (spain, portugal, italian factions, byzantium)
hot and fast tracks lets you relive medieval southern temperament
*middle east (moors, egypt, turks)
very adventurous and arabic music surrounds you with truly unique atmosphere

Download 3 parts/files. 
This mod requires M2TW version 1.3 (it should work on v1.1 or 1.2 too i think)

**************************
INSTALATION INSTRUCTIONS:
**************************
Make sure you follow them carefully

1. First backup your events.dat, event.idx, Music.dat, and Music.idx files (in M2TW/data/sound)
in case smth goes wrong.
2. Extract all music folder mp3s to M2TW/data/sounds (so that all downloaded mp3s are in M2TW/data/sounds/music folder)
3. Extract sound txt files (you may wanna backup them first) to M2TW/data
4. Delete events.dat, event.idx, Music.dat, and Music.idx files in M2TW/data/sounds
5. Very important!!!! Before you launch the game if you haven't unpacked the game put
"[io]
 file_first = true"
command (without quotes) in your config file (medieval2.preference.cfg - open with notepad). (I've unpacked so it works without it)
6. Launch vanilla M2TW (Medieval2.exe) and wait a couple of minutes for the game to rebuild its music files
7. Optionally: you can then delete M2TW/sounds/music folder (or backup in case for listening when not playing) if you see that the game has rebuilt music.dat file (which should be approx the same size as music folder) - in case you're runnin low on hdd space.
8. If you use a mod (which doesn't change music) you only need to copy events.dat, event.idx, Music.idx files to yourmodname/data/sound
*If you use Xenophonia mod you only need to copy (from sound txt files) descr_sounds_music.txt into M2TW/data.
*If you play Stainless Steel mod contact me at TWC and I'll tell you how to incorporate this music.
9. Enjoy the epic medieval music
