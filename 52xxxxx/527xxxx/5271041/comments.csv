-Hudson Valley Film & Video Festival 

""Aggressively rough-edged and in-your-face chronicle of disaffected youth in St. Petersburg, a coastal Florida city perhaps best known for being the place where Jack Kerouac died in 1969. Just under three decades later, the area was the site of race riots which made national headlines; Loren Cass is set in the immediate aftermath of these events, pungently evoking a volatile environment where violence is seldom far away. Amid this downbeat moodiness, writer-director Fuller (who also pseudonymously stars) inserts a lightly-sketched, laconic, nocturnal romance which is all the more convincing for being so casual and unforced. Dialogue is sparse and terse, while the 'plot' is a jagged, fragmentary, episodic affair which ""samples"" various 'found' audio and visual material (including a spectacularly messy real-life suicide, captured on live TV). Fuller's stylish technique occasionally gets out of hand, resulting in some moments of affectation here and there - but this is an impressively surly and uncompromised debut from a confident, promising young filmmaker.""
