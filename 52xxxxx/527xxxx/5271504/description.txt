                    Samaritan.                               
                    New episode of the crime drama based on the hit  
                    US series. A tragic communication error between  
                    police officers leads to the death of gay PC  
                    Nick Bentley when he is caught in the crossfire  
                    of armed drug-dealers. DC Ronnie Brooks and DC  
                    Matt Devlin investigate, but one of the dealers  
                    claims that a second police officer, Ray  
                    Griffin, was standing nearby doing nothing  
                    while Bentley bled to death. When Griffin is  
                    linked to an extreme religious group which  
                    discriminates against homosexuals, it appears  
                    the tragic error might not have been a mistake  
                    after all.
