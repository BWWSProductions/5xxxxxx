,klearlycanadian,2010-05-11T07:57Z,"Great movie, 10 mil budget, on location shooting?  Yvonne pulls off another stunning performance.  Her character is believable and she pulls it off.  We believe her to be the loving newly wed wife who follows her husband on this little quest/adventure.  At times she successfully pulls off the pouty, careful, concerned wife who serves as a conscience to the husband.  She doesn't come across as overbearing at all but more of an innocent self assuredness.   Yvonne has often said she cares for roles that has strength and courage.  She portrays those quality here showing us a young woman who has to be brave given her circumstance and setting, to stay alive, to save her husband.  Her bravery doesn't come at the expense of plausibility.  We see the fear and anguish in her while giving way to her inner strength taking charge of the task at hand.  A wife any man would be proud to have."
