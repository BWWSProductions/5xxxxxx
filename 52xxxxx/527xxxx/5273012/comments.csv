,bialystok,2010-01-12T13:09Z,which kind of pro tools is this? From siemens?
,The.Norse.Crown,2010-01-13T05:17Z,"#1. Thanks alot for this U/L been waiting a long time.

#2. It is M-Powered so you need an M-audio interface to use it. Should'nt need a crack for it as it will only work with M-audio interfaces

#3. I could be wrong but the copy of Protools M-powered 7 that came with my interface did'nt ask for a serial.

PLEASE SEED THIS BEAUTY
I will share to a 3/1 ratio
CHEERS!"

,McGlown,2010-01-21T03:17Z,does this work with an ilok?
,doczyaron,2010-06-28T00:52Z,"hi there!
I had a problem during the installation, it stops in the driver installation screen, and doesn't want to go further. I have already installed the Profire 2626 driver. What am I doing wrong? "
,iamcims,2010-07-14T15:58Z,Requires ilok authentication upon loading..
,AllianceZ,2010-07-22T22:37Z,this torrent dosnt work.. do not download!
,jtayl711,2010-07-27T17:11Z,"If I buy one of these...

http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/iLok

will this torrent work?  Please someone who has experience help.  "
,1yesman,2010-08-10T06:19Z,">jtayl711> iLok is just a USB stick, which is worthless if you don't have a software license for Pro Tools - it holds whatever software licenses you may have paid for - $40 is just a blank USB. iLok for PT8 has not been cracked yet - searched all over, got Pro Tools with educational discount instead... p.s. PT8 is quite buggy though with some plugins - DAE error #7401..."
,zeppelinrawks,2011-01-05T09:24Z,"Pro tools 9!! Anybody know of where to get it, or as to why it's not on the bay yet?"
,nafro76,2011-08-09T10:04Z,"Pro tools 7.4 cracked by Air is a much better pro tools than 8. I bought and owned an original copy of 7.4 and used it without any problems but when I upgraded to 8 it completely crashed my system. I used a cracked copy of 7.4 on my home system and it worked very well. If you download this torrent you will need an Ilok and the serial numbers from an original copy otherwise IT WILL NOT WORK, it is uncracked, this is a pointless torrent, mitoufle is an idiot! "
,nafro76,2011-08-09T10:08Z,"Also you will need an M Audio hardware device, for example what I use are Delta 1010's and my home system M audio Firewire 410. Pro tools 9 is supposed to be better but I got ripped off buying 8. I've reverted back to Cubase 5 for all my recording and production, its so stable and easy to use and with the waves plugins the quality is very close to that of pro tools."
