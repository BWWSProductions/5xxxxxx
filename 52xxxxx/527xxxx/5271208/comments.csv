,ggbaird,2010-01-11T11:18Z,This is the Toxic V2 torrent. It even has their pathetic little watermark in the corner.

,n3llo,2010-01-11T14:01Z,"sorry my bad, i just read the info..... doh."
[V],TvTeam,2010-01-11T18:30Z,It's complete movie. Enjoy ;)
,madtown4,2010-01-11T18:41Z,"it's out of sync around the 125 mark till the end , this shit pisses me off cause now i got to wait for a better one, shit happens"
,nma1919,2010-01-11T23:05Z,The audio and video worked fine for me. The movie on the other hand sucked balls. Total letdown after I heard about all the raving reviews. The kid in the movie is a total feeb and it annoyed the hell out of me the whole length of the movie. Glad I downloaded it instead of buying this worthless piece of shit movie.
,dysphunktion,2010-01-12T07:07Z,"This is a bit better than the previous toxic release.
This one has about 1 minute worth of missing content and it is not at crucial plot points.

Worth the download.
A:8
V:7"
