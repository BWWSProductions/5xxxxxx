 This new version is a substantial upgrade from the previous v3.70. It makes important changes to the GUI and core engine. For the core engine, there is improved ProBalance reaction time and other tweaks, amongst many other changes. For the GUI, a new 'Active Processes' tab with horizontal CPU utilization graphs gives you a quick view of what processes are actually active on the system. Further, the GUI now has better child window positioning and a 'hide graph' button for easy toggling of graph visibility.
