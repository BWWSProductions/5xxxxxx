Meet Fat Mamma, a 400-pound madame in a mini-dress, who opens a brothel, employing four fantastic hookers. Visit their training class, where they're taught the proper techniques in dressing and having sex. Then, watch as the gals go to town on their johns, frolicking on beds, in bubble baths and more. Mamma Mia, these gals make Heidi Fleiss look like Marie Osmond! With Dolly Mason
