[V],neon,2010-01-12T18:02Z,"i got v2 from another uploader and its not out of sync

good upload 20/40"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-12T19:56Z,"First of all, it's a good movie. Very good. And different of what I have epected... in every sense. It is post-apocalyptic story, yes, but a drama with two characters - father and  a son, very dark, emotional and doesn't ends well. There is no shred of pretentious approach, by none, and sure as hell, there is no even slightest resemblance on any post-apocalyptic movie - it's not ""2012? - it is a drama, I repeat.
So, let say that a movie; how is he shot, directed and edited depict atmosphere of the movie - it is dark, there is no sun, no colors, no perspective, no hope. Scenes from the past are quite contrary shiny and full of colors and sun.
Get the point?
Because my first contact was ""OMG... it is dark picture"". Yes, I say now - and it should be. That's the point. First encoding (my fist release yesterday, on other site) has been my lame attempt to fix something what is called ""atmosphere"" of the movie, dullness, darkness and - pointlessness. 
Yes, there are some other issues too, and mentioned async was 136 milliseconds, in one part of the Toxic screener (I guess a missing part from V1) and noticeable again just at the end of the movie, maybe last minute or so.
This movie should be watched in darkened room, as in theater, and with proper distance from screen. I very often change my grade concerning A/V quality when after ""previewing"" move to the sofa and finish the watching from there.

As I always say: be reasonable... Toxic is 1940 MB and my re-encoding is - 347 MB...
Is it 5 TIMES lower in quality? Nope.
Anyone concerned about the quality should download the biggest version one can find, 'cause the bigger the better, right?"
