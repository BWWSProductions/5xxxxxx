Due to mechanical issues with his plane, Warren Haynes missed the first Charlotte 
show, but he was back with a vengeance for this one!  Gregg Allman's back also felt better at this show, and Gregg played most of the keyboards, only needing occasional help from Danny Louis and Kofi Burbridge on keys.
