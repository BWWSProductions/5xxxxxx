,ZeroOhm,2011-03-23T22:05Z,"Oh boy , what a useless series this is.
I watched the first episode and  the research and opinions from it are SOOO flawed.
In the concluding comments , Jesse (the know nothing bald headed boob) said ,  'its another to interfere with nature'

No proof was given that showed that Haarp could control the weather.
The cloud in a chamber experiment does not represent what happens in real life.

''We saw how easy it is to move clouds around''

No where did they show directed RF energy moving a cloud around.
A lit candle in the bottom of the chamber would cause the same moisture in the chamber to rise by the same amount,,,are candles now a weapon of mass destruction ?

''trigger storms''

No where did they show that they could trigger a storm.

'''floods''

Again , nowhere did they show the Haarp technology could cause a flood.

''And I learned that radio wave really can get inside your head''

No they didn't , the experiment with the Cd player and transducers does not show what radio wave can do.
A piezo transducer is a mechanical vibrating device , and is not radio waves.
What that  experiment showed was that mechanical vibrations of the skull can be heard as sound.
It has nothing to do with radio waves- OR HAARP. !!

There was bald faced lie in the episode when they said that Haarp was used in Iraq- not true.
It was directed ultrasonic weapons - NOT haarp.
there were no radio waves involved , just inaudible audio. 

''They got inside mine''

Hard to believe that is possible with all that crap in there.

UGG  , what a boob.
Zero credibility , I'me not going to bother with watching the rest of the episodes.

Click - DELETED."
,beezkneez2005,2011-05-30T20:07Z,"@ZeroOhm

You obviously havn't done any research on HAARP, or the test that they have successfully done.  HAARP can control weather.  Read about what it does before you start ranting about shit that wasnt on the video."
,-burra-,2011-08-02T21:14Z,Thanx k3nd00d
,vespine,2011-08-13T05:54Z,"@ZeroOhm I downloaded these for research and you are totally right.  But there's no way you can persuade any of the nutters that doing real research involves a little more critical thought then reading prisonplanet, abovetopsecret and david ike. lol.."
,cormaczoso,2012-05-26T01:26Z,"surprised not to find another review here ;) so i'll give you one ...

this show is so weak and lame it is on the level of the 'professional wrestling' in which this gentleman first made his name in ... i watched several episodes curious to see what it would be like and honestly, this must have been written by several very drunk bar patrons who each recalled once having seen or heard something about the subject ... ridiculously thin and shallow ...

and in one episode ventura meets his 'important source' at an airport because this person is so afraid of coming into the united states since they know so much about well, everything! and the government will snatch him up and stick him in a black hole prison somewhere ... 

ummm ... yeah right ... buddy if you knew that much and the gov't wanted you in prison or dead, you'd already be one or the other ...

secondly, if this person is so afraid of coming into the usa that they flew into an airport so they could jump off the plane and hand ventura a manilla envelope and then run back onto the plane and leave, what kept ventura from going to the country where this person is hiding? you don't have to say the name of the country ya know ... or hey, how about fed ex'ing the manilla envelope thru a third party to ventura ... and don't planes coming into the usa have to submit a flight plan, where they are from, what they are doing, etc, esp after 9/11? 

the conspiracy with this series is how in god's name it ever got made and who does jesse ventura know that set this up so he could make some easy money ...

worthless ... completely and utterly

this is not a commentary on the uploader ... just on the quality of the series ... the uploader is a fine sharing person :)"
