UPDATED VERSION OF THE MOST COMPLETE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN KING

This is the updated version of bibliography of Stephen King, the new bibliography contains about 20 new stories, some of them have never been published, several poems, which is very interesting and several novels and non-fiction books. I found complete Colorado Kid and Blaze, but also new book from november 2009 Under The Dome. On writing is also there. One more thing: Buy your favourite books from King, cause it is much prettier when you feel paper underneath your hands.

I have one dream: To collect all books from Stephen King and buy all original DVD movies and put them on shelves one day. But there is two problem, i have not enough space in my room to do this, and i have not enough money either (Not even close in next several years)
Till that day when Iâ€™ll have enough money and enough space, I would be satisfied with electronic bibliography of Stephen King that I collect in last several days, and of course movies that I already watched and download (and will) from thePiratebay. 
It take a lot of my time to find all this books, and after that convert them from stupid .LITS and Microsoft Word to .PDF. So, all books are in PDF! (Except Roadwork from 1981. I didnâ€™t succeed to convert from LIT to PDF, but still the book is readable with Microsoft Reader, Salemâ€™s Lot from 2004 is in LIT and PDF,format, but LIT is much more readable than other one). Leave a comment if anyone manage to convert properly these books. If those books are not converted good, (I checked each one, and they are good converted) in a case if you still want to make some changes, like formatting the text and make books more tidy, so you can print, read or edit,  I recommend strongly to use Foxit not Adobe, or Solid PDF converter, only for converting.
Collection is divided by years, from 1956, and his first story Jhonathan And The Witches, till 2009, and last book Under The Dome. Collection has 64 Novels, 8 Story Collections and 104 Stories. Well, it is not because I collected it, but this is amazing collection (or bibliography) of Stephen King, as I like to say â€˜â€™A most complete collection of Stephen Kingâ€™s books on internetâ€™â€™. I must admit that I am very jealous on all those people who know English very well, I hope I will improve mine with Stephen King.
