,Arionex,2010-04-14T19:18Z,"THANK YOU, I was about to download the older version of this torrent but lucky me I read the comment section before-hand. This is impressive. I have his ""Stand By Me"", ""Tommy Knockers"" & ""Thinner"" movies. I wish I knew how to upload them. THANKS! "
,ilovebooze420,2010-05-16T07:02Z,"Thanks RancidCo, for the awesome King collection!

Any chance you'll update it again when ""Blockade Billy"" hits e-book status? If so, that would be awesome.

If not, no biggie. I'm sure I'll find it elsewhere."
