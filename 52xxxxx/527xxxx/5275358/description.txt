              Released in March 2008, this memorial DVD to the late, 
     great (yet often misunderstood) Italian director Lucio Fulci features
  nearly 90 on-camera interviews with some of the biggest names in EuroHorror,
                       all answering the same question.

                 "What is your fondest memory of Lucio Fulci?"

 These interviews were originally slated to serve as an accompaniment to a book 
      project of the same name, but in viewing the responses back-to-back,
this DVD gets to the heart of that project and tells the tale of who Lucio Fulci
                      was via those he knew & worked with.
