,jrloader,2010-06-07T23:33Z,So where the hell is episode 11!!! The finale is supposed to be E12&13!! According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sanctuary_episodes
,jrloader,2010-06-07T23:37Z,This must be episode 11 because it is only 350MB. The 2 episode finale would be 700MB. 
,jrloader,2010-06-07T23:47Z,"nepoelif_2...I can't find this episode or the season finale at eztv. It stops at episode 10.

I'm new at posting comments at torrent sights, I do feel obliged to post confirmation about this torrent after I've downloaded it. I'm just trying to make sure that I don't waste my usage by downloading something twice!!"
,DarkRedoSin,2010-11-01T10:33Z,Another good quality episode.Things getting exciting with Sanctuary-Kali 3 part story is excellent.S02E12 and 13 and S03E01 the 3rd part to the Kali story.
