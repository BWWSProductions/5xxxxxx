,Firii,2010-06-06T15:36Z,"So, does anyone know how to update a pro app that is installed through apk (like the ones in this torrent). Because you arn't able to update them through the market. Your phone doesn't register these apps in the 'download' section of the android market. "
,ktubb,2010-06-10T15:41Z,i doubt these can be updated via the market w/o paying for them. you may need to find the new version in a torrent.
,jason1502,2010-06-12T12:02Z,what to do with .apk files? Do I just put them on my memorycard or what? 
,eggdycid,2010-07-03T19:31Z,Put them  on the sd card of your phone then run them from your phone with a file manager (for instance Astro)
,Firii,2010-07-10T20:26Z,"How to install an app with the .apk file extension: 1) Go to settings > applications, and enable the \'unknown sources\' option. 2) put the .apk somewhere on your sd card. 3) Open your file manager on the device (there are a shitload of emm on the market for free). 4) click on the apk file. 5) if you get the \'complete action using\' pop-up, choose \'package installer\'"
,dxcdan,2010-07-17T02:21Z,"Will this work on the Droid X????rnrnLol, i know it runs android, of course, but what about the auto-brick security thing???   I believe the phone only bricks it self if there is a firmware change, but can anybody confirm that these apps won\'t brick the phone????  Thanks in advance!"
,baaambey,2010-08-04T12:38Z,"Thanks a lot! This collection is HUGE!!! I hope to install most of them on my G1. I have Android OS version 1.6 on it and it's kind of old and in now always supported by new apps. Another places to download APK files for Android are http://slideme.org and http://www.freewarelovers.com/android

I hope to get Nexus One soon, my G1 is getting slow sometimes with games."
,baaambey,2010-08-04T12:39Z,"err... please read ""and in now always supported by new apps"" as ""and IS NOT always supported by new apps"""

,CamronM,2010-12-06T07:21Z,"I'm going to be getting an Android soon and I wanna know if there is anything I need to do in order to put these apps on my phone? Do I need to do a Droid version of jailbreaking, or can I just put them on my phone? Thanks :)"
