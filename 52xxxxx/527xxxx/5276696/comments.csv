,LittleMrJ,2011-03-28T08:07Z,"Sorry, but this one doesn't work. It causes a bad hash fault & C++ runtime error during game launch. I had to uninstall/reinstall the game, & all the DLC again, using a Mad Moxxi torrent from another guy... The other three KaOs DLC torrents for Borderlands work perfectly, but not this one. Perhaps it has something to do with the goofy auto-extractor its bundled in. The other packs don't have that, & everything with them works great... Sorry, but I'm giving this one a thumbs down.
Don't download this. I have an excellent system & know what I'm talking about... The other 3 Borderlands expansions from this guy work flawlessly though."
