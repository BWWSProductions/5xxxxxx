,idrone42,2010-01-31T12:58Z,"you retards who don't like this movie don't realize it's just about all true stories, from the most ridiculous chapter in the cold war and, for that matter, human history. reagen was a superstitious nutcase with the iq of a loaf bread, he was the one who ok'ed all these projects. although that might not be enough to know for it to be entertaining if you're a teenager or it's ageless mental equivalent: a complete idiot. in that case you should download peter pan or transformers, if it's ok with your parents.

this movie does have a few minor shortcomings, but they are few and minor. the ending is one of them, but the intelligence, acting, humur and documentary value sends this movie up to 8/10. a/v is good too.

,AkaPhsyco,2010-03-01T11:56Z,"Hey MPAA you ever heard of innovation? 

Based on the condition of the movie industry over the past half of a decade, it would assuredly seem you haven't! 

Nice lame ass commercial at the beginning of your dvd menu's btw, ""You wouldn't steal a car would you!?"" 

Yea and Refer Madness was a factual depiction of marijuana use. 

The film industry has been separated from legitimate Art and Entertainment for half a century at least!

2tb and counting Dl'ed and believe me more to come!

Let me ask you this, the music industry got decimated by the digital pirate revolution, has music gotten any worse since? Haven't seen a NSYNC or Backstreet Boys in awhile. I wonder why that is?

If you really do it for the art, you should be happy to share your ""product"" and be happy with the theater tickets we buy!!!

Support Net Neutrality! Support the resistance against companies like Comcast trying to monopolize the internet and throttle innovation and connections! Write your congress/parliament, who's members time and again naively fail to understand how important a free and open internet is to this generation and the generations to come!

We all have grown up intimately connected to the internet. We've seen it sprout from a simple conversational tool in its public inception. Watched it grow into and industry must have with e-commerce. Blossom with sophisticated social networks and tools for musicians, amateur film makers and software designers to reach people in ways not even conceivable merely years ago.

 The fate of the internet; actual ""intellectual"" content, entrepreneurial availability and personal and artistic communication, is far too important to be left in the hands of people who have no reverence or little understanding.

It works like this, someone like extremezone creates a torrent for a file and makes it available; other users download from this hallowed person and as they do the pieces they have are shared with others who do not have those pieces. Once you've downloaded the .torrent file, you need another program to actually use the .torrent to get the pieces and assemble them into the file in question. Look up on the net what you should use for your system. I have both a Mac and a PC, for Mac I use Transmission, which is better than the Bittorrent I use for PC, but tht one is decent. Lots of them out there, those are the ones I use. After that just follow the directions. Then you'll be able to download (Leech), to rarely seed and to bitch gratuitously about free files generous people like extremezone offer up despite the abuse that the moron-majority on TPB heaps on them.
