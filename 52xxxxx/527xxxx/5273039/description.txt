        Twenty  years  ago,  Jane  Parker  (Cynthia  Preston)  had   a
        wonderful life.  However, that  was short-lived  when she lost
        her  twin  brother  Sean  to  suicide  after  his   girlfriend
        Katherine (Alexandra Paul) broke up with him. Heartbroken over
        the loss of her  son, Jane's mother Florence,  never recovered
        from the tragedy and since then, Jane was stuck at home caring
        for her mother. She never forgot that Katherine was to  blame.

        Jane's opportunity for revenge appears when Katherine  returns
        to town in a bid to save her father's ailing business  empire,
        especially the local  paper mill and  all the people  who have
        spent their  lives working  there. But  for more  than half of
        Jane's life, she's been  harbouring her hatred and  waiting to
        make Katherine pay for what she did to Sean. And now the  time
        has finally come.
