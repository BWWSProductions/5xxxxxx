The Batman Chronicles was a quarterly issues series published by DC Comics from 1995 to 2001, which lasted 23 issues.

With a larger page count than typical comics of the time, most issues contained 3 separate stories, with Batman usually featuring in at least one of these.  Other stories featured Batman's friends and foes.  The additional 4 issues of a quarterly title allowed DC to, along with the 4 existent monthly titles, publish a Batman comic every week of the year.
