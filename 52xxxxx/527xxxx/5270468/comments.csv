Try using the Api.Dll from version 1.66
I got the same error like you, and tried a lot of different shit to get it working. Using that Api file instead of the one in 1.72 got it working :D"
,ReaL_BadMaN,2010-01-09T20:14Z,but where do i find that file? I overwrote it using this crack.
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-11T10:19Z,"i'm soo happy it worked first try, i need my cod fix!!"
,hc_cob,2010-01-11T19:55Z,"it wont work for me. Itried it and zero gear doesnt do anything, it just says error xrogear.exe missing. if u try without zero gear it kicks u in 2min.
So i copied aal the content from mw2 installation folder like the introductions said.
What did I do wrong?"
,hc_cob,2010-01-12T10:36Z,"ok I got it work. 
Its fucking awesome!
hope iw realises players want dedicated."
,l0lfac3,2010-01-12T16:39Z,"this method does work, i didnt use this torrent, but a good friend sent me the crack,

but.. there are quite a lot of hackers, and if you think your so special using hacks, know that your not, and because of people who do use aimbots right now IW is gona patch the game fairly soon
that means another month wait for a crack"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-13T17:41Z,"yeah they got the crack for good, were gonna have to figure something out, not involving zero gear :("
,hc_cob,2010-01-13T20:00Z,"2 minute kick is back :(
so now i have to use .174 crack?"

i've tried it and it worked all i needed to do was change the zerogear.bat file to start mw2.174.exe.
and i needed to place my iw_17.iw file back in the main folder."
,SteveWade,2010-01-15T20:24Z,well anyone that has problem with multiplayer just go buy it!!!! losers
