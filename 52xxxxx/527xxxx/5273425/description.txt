sinopse:

At 21, MichÃ¨le is convinced that she is a failure. A model with a bright future ahead of her, she is thrown into a state of depression when she breaks up with her boyfriend, Bertrand. To combat her growing sense of insecurity, she decides that what she needs is a bit of divine support, so she embarks on a quest for religion. Catholicism has its attractions but MichÃ¨le quickly decides that Buddhism may be a better bet, mainly for the meditating. Whilst MichÃ¨le is busy looking for God, she begins a relationship with a 30-something vet, FranÃ§ois. When the latter lets slip that he is a Jew, MichÃ¨le wastes no time adopting Judaism as her religion of choice...
