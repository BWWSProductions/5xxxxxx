2. burn on cd and all will be ok?"
,scaleblue,2010-11-27T22:24Z,Does this work on the mac pcsx2 and if so then where do i put files and extract what and all that.
,Ai9513,2010-11-30T08:22Z,"Um...I'm kinda new at this, can I ask? How long is it that I have to wait for it to finish downloading in BitTorrent? And after finish downloading, should I just burn it into a disk or I'm supposed to do something first???"
,kindfaith,2011-08-29T05:49Z,"I downloaded it but when I tried to burn it at low speed it showed the messege error then I tried high speed and still the same, just when I was about to give up after 2 wasted CDs I tried to burn it at medium speed and it's working perfectly, thnx for the upload!:)"
