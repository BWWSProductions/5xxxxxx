[V],bubanee,2010-01-14T22:35Z,"been thinking about that one for ages.. i got that many CDs of the 80's it ain't funny... how would i make it if i did... gee it would be a hard one to do.. i could take the top 10 of each year in billboard and make 100 songs that way... but i like the early 80's between 80 and 83 esp.. 1982!... it would deffo be hard to do.. but i did make a 1982 a long time ago before i even started uploading and at an average bitrate..

and another of the 1980s again in an average bitrate before any uploading

but i'm deffo going to do another someday with a good all CDRip with the way i do things today.. but these two will do for now! "
