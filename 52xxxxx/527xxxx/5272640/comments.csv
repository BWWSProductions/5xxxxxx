Why the codes for PC? For someone that reverse engineer the IMG to a MapSource version with gMapTool & cGPSmapper?"
[T],Nincsenex,2010-01-13T12:57Z,"FrasseDaMan:
You are right, MapSource is in the name only to make search for maps easier.

And you are right again, unlock codes for PC, are for the version that people can make with different programs to see the map in MapSource."

[T],Nincsenex,2010-07-03T23:20Z,"This is not a CD/DVD image!

This is an image for Garmin GPS devices!"
,vick977,2010-07-05T21:26Z,"OK, so how would I go about transferring it to a Garmin Nuvi for eg? Thanks in advance for the instructions."

,ravenlost,2011-02-11T08:45Z,"If anyone can help, what do we need to do with theses ""unlock codes""?

I do have Garmin Mapsource software on my pc... but not sure what to do. 

I also tried just copying over the gmapsupp.img into my GPS's GARMIN folder (like I usually do) but I also get the ""CAN'T UNLOCK MAPS"" message turning on my GPS. Ive got a Garmin Daakota 20.

Can anyone clarify how I can get this working?

Cheers! Pat"
,ravenlost,2011-02-24T18:57Z,"Okay, I found how to make this work. Have no clue what thoses listed ""unlock codes"" are for as I did not use them.


Here's what I did to make it work:

Assuming you have your GPS Unit ID at hand and using Jetmouse 1.5 keygen, enter your Unit ID at the top, select ""Custom mapset"" at the bottom and enter FID / MapID: 281. Hit Generate at the bottom.

Copy the generate code into a new file called ""gmapsupp.unl"" NO LINE BREAKS.

Finally, copy the UNL file you've just created, along with the ""gmapsupp.img"" file under your Garmin\ subdirectory of your gps device.

It worked for me. Cheers!
