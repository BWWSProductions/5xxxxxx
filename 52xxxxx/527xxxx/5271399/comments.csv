,Pappegye,2010-03-12T19:31Z,Any viruses or anything we should know of?
,g00p993,2010-03-19T01:16Z,"PERFECT! If you feel uncomfortable about this version, just download from the website and use the serial! I downloaded, and it worked, though of course when I experimented to ""check for updates"" it said problem with serial. YET it didn't block it. Instead it downloaded the newest version with performance improvements... and stayed activated (time will tell I guess, but the text said pro activated)...... so it works, and worked with the newer version to. 

Thanks a lot, perfect for my triple setup!"
,Ptstandard,2010-05-01T11:30Z,where exactly do you put the serial?
,Chilvarez,2010-07-07T14:48Z,"The serial activates Display Fusion however after doing any updates after startup it will display an incorrect serial message, Display Fusion will continue to run however, it's just a minor inconvienence to dismiss the message.
Works great
That being said, after the cost of a multimonitor setup the $25 for a real version is nothing, buy it."
,jorma669,2010-07-19T14:31Z,"Add 
127.0.0.1       www.binaryfortress.com
to hosts file and warning will disappear"
,comet.vermont,2010-09-12T17:43Z,"Works perfect & EXTREMELY fast DL!

As g00p993 said, if you have a prob. using this version DL from home page & activate with included key.  Worked for someone I know...not me though, I don't pirate software."
,bigwrench1,2010-10-15T23:19Z,how do you add to host name to get rid of annoying message?
,Bxbugs123,2010-11-29T18:49Z,"Nice very good didn't even need the installer, the key worked with version 3.2.0 thank you very much."

,xidio,2011-04-09T21:38Z,"What is the point of this torrent? You dont get access to the ""pro"" features and there is nowhere to enter the key or the name."
,Whyttedragun,2011-04-30T22:45Z,"I used the installer that comes in this download, then tried to enter the serial, and I keep getting ""Your serial isn't 64-bit encoded.""  How, exactly, am I supposed to put the serial in?"

,childofstrings,2011-05-29T18:05Z,"This serial used to work maybe a year ago. Not working anymore. Doesn't work with the new version 3.3 at all. I haven't been able to find a single torrent out there with a working serial.

Guess I'm going to cave in and buy the damn thing."
,xenomorph1138,2011-06-06T17:50Z,Thanks for sharing.
,XfizzyX,2011-06-21T18:11Z,"Since people always seem to be a little mentally handicapped when it comes to installing software from this site, here's a quick guide.
1. Add the hosts file exception line:
#    127.0.0.1 www.binaryfortress.com
underneath everything else in there.
2. Install with the included installer (or legacy off the site)
3. Right click the icon in the tray>Pro: enter serial
4. Paste in the Serial code from the included file.
5. Right click tray icon>Settings>options: uncheck automatic updates.
6. Add a block in your firewall as an added precaution
7. Enjoy"
,Kirnath,2011-07-30T06:21Z,"for those who can[t seem to find where to put the key you right click and go to ""enter license key"" and put it in there.

I do however want to use the new version so does anyone have a new key?"
,Darkman802,2012-03-11T13:52Z,"If anyone still needs it, here is a key for v3.4.1

,Darkman802,2012-03-11T13:53Z,and remember to block binaryfortress.com in your host file.
