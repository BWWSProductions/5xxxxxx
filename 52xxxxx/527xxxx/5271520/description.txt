Truly, Madly, Bletchley was a BBC Radio 4 comedy series from 1997 written by and starring comedian and impressionist Julian Dutton and produced by Dirk Maggs. Series 2 was produced by Andy Aliffe.

Truly, Madly, Bletchley follows a group of Councillors who decide to start their own public access cable radio show.

A surreal take on small-town life, the series mixed stream-of-consciousness sketches with a nod to the vivacious world of 1950's variety, including a musical interlude from spoof tea-dance band, Enrico Valdez and his Orchestra, with accordionist Micky Binelli and singer Cleo Rocos, of Kenny Everett Show fame. 


The show attracted praise from reviewers: "The most confident radio sitcom since The Navy Lark," - Independent on Sunday.
