WOW! I just happened to run across your rant by accident and I had to register myself onto piratebay (As I don't use it except occasionally) just so I could comment back. Because..... WOW! Ok - here are the cliff notes:
1. Using multiple exclamation points does not make you seem smarter or get your point across any more efficiently.
2. The first letter of a sentence starts with a CAPITAL letter.
3. Using the word ""fag"" to describe someone who you do not appreciate not only makes you ignorant but also a hateful cunt.
4. Speaking of retarded monkeys and things they can figure out - Leechers don't want to share. Get over it. This is not breaking news and none of them are going to read your piece of shit commentary and think, ""Gee, I never thought of it like that."" You're arguing with no one thus making you the dumb ass tick on the retarded monkey's ass that can't figure shit out.
5. SPELL CHECK BITCH!
6. Choose - either you're going to use the correct word: Leechers or you're going to misspell it every time and put Leachers.
7. Peace: Freedom from disturbance vs. Piece: A portion of an object.

That was pretty much it. If you want to go on long, ignorant rants please at least do the rest of the world a favor and reread your ignorant, hateful, scumbag piece of shit comments so the rest of us can understand what you're saying while thinking you're a total douche."
