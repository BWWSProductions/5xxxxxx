Here it is, the last part of the footage of Kylie live in NY at the Hammerstein Ballroom.

This includes YDNY a cappella, The One, and ISBSL.

Kylie's first and only North American Tour (so far) was never officially filmed so this is the closest thing we have to a concert DVD.

Thanks a million to shiny from Sayhey for the videos.
Please remember to help seed when you're done!  :)
