The Justice League Unlimited is a Second Life-based "anti-griefing" group... the community has known for a long time that the JLU's activities are much more akin to griefing than anti-griefing, and the recent leak of a siterip of thier "secret wiki" offers nothing but confirmation.

Some highlights:
- List of users to gain the trust of for information
- Personal RL contact information of griefers
- Many, many posted chat logs (a violation of the SecondLife terms of service and grounds for account termination)
- Description of tactics, many of which are the same ones used by griefers

Etc, etc.

Oh, did I mention that it's all "copyright" the JLU's leader, and he gets very upset when people share his secret wiki?
