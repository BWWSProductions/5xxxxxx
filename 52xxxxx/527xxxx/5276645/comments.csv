[T],awaken888,2010-01-14T19:16Z,Opinions vary. I will say he does make mistakes like all of us. David Icke has been talking about the NWO take over for 20 or 25 years. After all these years he still tells the same stories he has changed  slightly towards enlightenment. Thanks great comment.
,GoldStandard,2010-01-31T02:26Z,"It is not so important whether Icke himself is 100% right or not. What is important is the parts that are facts that will allow you to question the world and news around you as it is described by the mainstream.  It is the beginning of the apocalypse, which means removal of the veil from our eyes, for if there is one thing that is the mortal enemy of TPTB, it is the truth."
