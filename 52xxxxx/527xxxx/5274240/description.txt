Features recent innovations and traditional roots of this potent music. Cuts from live Vodou ceremonies are juxtaposed with performances by well-known Haitian artists, such as Boukman Experyans, RaRa Machine, Boukan Ginen and RAM. A cascade of soundsâ€”Haitian Kreyol, the blowing of a conch shell, powerful drumming, electric guitar, synthesizers, sounds of clay pots, bells, and gourd rattlesâ€”build compelling rhythmic cross-currents. Enclosed notes examine the musicâ€™s political and spiritual base. Portions of the proceeds from the sale of this recording go to benefit Haitian grassroots community projects. 20 tracks. "The music has an indomitable spirit." â€” New York Times
