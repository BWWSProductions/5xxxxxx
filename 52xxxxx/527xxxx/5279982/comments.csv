,thunderbum,2010-01-15T00:27Z,"@TedKennedy - saw your comments on yesterday's Limbaugh link and have to agree with you - and as we've all watched Obama's Magical Mystery Apology Tour go on the road, Obama gets George Bush and Slick Willy to round up supplies to go to Haiti!

It took 3 days for the obamination to say something about the Fruit of the Kaboom bomber, but The One is johnny on the spot to give out at least 100 million $ and more.

I guess Obama's African roots and his Marxist Church's tenets to tend to black African's children first ('cos according to rev. Wrong 'America's chickens are coming home to roost' so screw them!) 

The Obamanation is such a hypocrite: If Bush is such a fcuk-up then why phone him and ask if he wouldn't mind helping out with Haiti's disaster relief? 

So how's that hoax and chains thing workin' ou for ya, America?

Limbaugh: proving to be right 99.5% of the time!"
,booboo332,2010-01-15T00:54Z,"Thanks to the uploader for reliably bringing the PB community the worlds best tweaker of liberals.  

The more littletrick yaps, the more hilarious he becomes and proves how much Rush drives people like him even crazier.  Sure, other Obamanauts are going to appreciate his comments but these unhinged libs are so deluded that I wouldn't be surprised if they begin finding and worshipping ""the One's"" likeness in water stains and grilled tofu sandwiches.

littletrick whines and rants but he has all of the substance of a fart in a hurricane.  If so many of his ilk weren't so similarly deranged, I'd suspect that he is a conservative pretending to be a liberal nut.

Keep up the good work entertaining us and undermining the progressive agenda, tricky.  The Dems could use more like you."
,sistromo,2010-01-15T02:42Z,"Lest we develop the dangerous habit a of critical, independent thinking."
,BarrySoetoro,2010-01-15T03:29Z,"Lol... ironic coming from someone who wants to be babysat by a massive government, sistromoo.

You are utterly clueless. :)"
,ok_computer,2010-01-15T04:01Z,"
Waitin on Trix, and he sends roboSistromo!

Oh noMo!

D?mo arigat?, Sistromo Roboto!!!

The bot is only as good as the programming.

and 

Where is that TrickDinkus hiding at ?!?

Bout it Dinkus - Is it okay to be a RACIST if you are a SOCIALIST?

Yo Trix - Did you put in a long day at ACORN today?

How many football players did you register to vote?

Go ahead Dinkus tell us about your day.

There's plenty of space to ejaculate below. 

ENDuuuUH!

,thunderbum,2010-01-15T07:58Z,LOL! I wonder how many sock puppets the resident troll has? (Or should it properly be called Multiple Personality Disorder - a real disorder which can be found in the DSM!)
,booboo332,2010-01-15T08:57Z,"The latest version of the DSM now refers to it as Dissociative Identity Disorder but it seems to me that littletrick is afflicted with DFRD - Diassociated From Reality Disorder.


PS - Oh littletrick, you couldn't stay away if you tried.  Go ahead, prove me wrong.  ;)"
,TedKennedy,2010-01-15T16:04Z,"LOL, it is great to be American! i would probably get prosecuted for hate speech in liberal Europe for the statements i made on yesterdays torrents (I lived in England for a while..... thank god i am back!). anyway trick i myself feel that rush is not literally attacking obama, i think he is pointing out how silly politicizing these types of things is. i didn't check your msncb clip maybe another time.  im not going to get into this that and the other nit picking who reacted faster to what, but i will say i obama and george bush are both part of the progressive agenda. i dont really give a shit about sticking up for either of them, im just saying get your head out of the sand and stop letting everyone lie to you about who is ""better"". they are the same, they both lied (though i believe obama has lied more extensively), they both have stolen and are stealing money from me and both of them want to get their dirty fingers in every part of my life(though obama is a lot more interested in the stealing). the only reason i might lean towards bush as better is that he was not a Marxist scum bag. Rush is a great entertainer who stands up for the best of American ideals, say what you will about him. GO FREE MARKETS TIME TO TURN THIS ECONOMY AROUND!"
,TedKennedy,2010-01-15T16:10Z,"P.S. mate one of the reasons no one ever listens to liberal radio or watches their shows is the fact that they inflate their ego by insulting normal peoples intelligence don't make that mistake yourself by calling people ""shrimp brain"" or whatever it was. that is completely ad hominem, if you want to change someones mind (I speak for myself here not others) is to do it with compassion not insults. so funny tho that you live right up to the liberal stereo type of shutting down any debate by writing someone off as stupid.... haha no wonder this country cant stand to watch or listen to any of you."
,TedKennedy,2010-01-15T16:24Z,"Also if any one from mass out there, get out and vote for scott brown. you can still get absentee ballots (most places till 5 today) and the polls open Tuesday!
God Bless you all, and God bless America!"
,TedKennedy,2010-01-15T16:28Z,another good reason bush was better is that he may not be as smart as obama (whatever that means) but at least he knows the the difference between good and evil.
,ok_computer,2010-01-15T18:07Z,"
Check it out!!

TrickDummy says he's givin' up! 

I guess after he's been KO'd 54 times or whatever he's ready to go down for the last time.

Obviously, he suffering from a lot of brain damage, but he's still my favorite Uncle Tom.

Way ta go there, Dummy!

ENDuuuUH!

DuuuhONE!

,thunderbum,2010-01-15T21:58Z,"LOL!! The troll is giving up answering? Pfft~ trolls aren't able to do that, their egos won't permit it!

As for the fruit of the kaboom bomber, troll- not everyone on that flight was black. So saying the Obamination has never had to deal with a white disaster shows how bady out of touch with reality you are: terrorism doesn't differentiate color, race, religion...islam sees muslims as innocent, and Christians and Jews are set aside for special butchery, and everyone else is considered to be unbelievers so it's okay to murder them. And if you kill yourself in the process you're supposed to get 72 virgins. So again you're speaking out your arse.

I've studied the koran in depth since 9/11 and it's a the origional DYI for hate, lies, heavy taxes, slavery and murder. 

Instead of wanking all day, use your comp for something educational and find a koran online and study it. EnnnnnnnndddDUH!"
,booboo332,2010-01-16T00:18Z,"I like how Dennis Miller summed up why we can't reason with Islamic Terrorists like so many deluded dimwits like Obama want to do.  Basically, you cannot reason with someone who sees your death as the skeleton key to paradise.

The whole 72 eternal virgin thing really shows how out of touch these murderous zealots are.  Only a madman would think an eternity with 6 dozen woman who have no idea how to satisfy you would be a good thing."
,thunderbum,2010-01-16T03:01Z,"@ booboo - if ya want to have a good laugh, go find a koran online and read what their 'paradise' is: then reverse the psychology and look at what muslim men are now and why they think paradise is something to look forward to:

Among other things they'll be able to screw endless boys - they're all around you to pick up like precious pearls.

You have endless females and concubines (which for them paradise must be the true definition of hell)

They'll have plenty of water, fruits, and lard-marinated camel meat

And one of the best: they'll have big long dicks - and be able to last hours. That means right now they've got tiny dicks and they can only last something like 2.4 seconds before ejaculating! LOLOL!!!"
