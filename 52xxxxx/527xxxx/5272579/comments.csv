Thank you for this rare gem! It would be interesting to know how you can make an excellent DVDrip of a DVD that has not been published in the U.S.!
Please edit this presentation and add tag 'Patrick Dempsey' so that it can be found at
http://thepiratebay.org/tag/patrick+dempsey
Also noteworthy for Brad Pitt in one of his very first appearances, although in a small part."
[V],Kuthumi,2010-06-19T18:47Z,"Sorry to nag, but the + should not be entered into the Tag(s) field. It is added automatically during search. Several tags should be separated with commas. You should enter:
Helen Slater,Patrick Dempsey,Brad Pitt
You may test them afterwards to see if they work.
There is no use for the tags ""dvdrip"" or ""avi"", as there are thousands of them.
Please click my blue username above if you want to see how I have used tags."
