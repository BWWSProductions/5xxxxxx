       The UK is hit by a massive earthquake, with                                         
       multiple epicentres all over the country. Professor Quakermass, a brilliant         
       seismologist, contacts Frank. He thinks that there is more to these earthquakes     
       than meets the eye and implores the spies to investigate however they can. Rose,    
       Oscar and Carrie soon discover that all is not what it seems. Can they stop         
       another massive earthquake from happening before Britain collides with France?
