It is historically accurate - you don't watch the Apollo 13 Hollywood version B.S. (""Houston, we've got a problem"" - that was actually said from the Apollo 12 mission which was hit by lightening right after launch).

- One great feature is the complete Apollo 11 launch right up to the Saturn V separation. It just doesn't get any better than this.

- And the clips of people from all around the world watching this.

- This was definitely a team effort, from the women hand sewing the space suits, to all of the famous mathematicians and the physicists Newton, etc greats from all around the world made this possible.

This file is quite large since it's in native DVD format - so it's suitable to convert back into a regular DVD.

Seeding:  Starting to seed again. Thanks."
