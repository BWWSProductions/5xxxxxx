[V],twentyforty,2010-01-14T11:12Z,"@htctouch: I honestly cannot do ""Honest Man"". Currently I am so late with requests that another movie cannot be squeezed in. You know I would, if I can. Movies are big files, for me to upload them in reasonable time and manner. I am sorry.
@cairodon: I am fan of Being Human. I have S02E01 on queue from Sunday and Season One all six episodes in 1.35 GB pack from last Thursday (was requested). But, everything was screwed up by two days down-time of TPB uploads this weekend. Rest of your requests cannot fit-in, I don't encode reality and MTV shows.
@yiscool: Look at your question and my answer to you on Cougar T."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-14T11:15Z,"@htctouch: Typo or whatever:
Honest = Serious. LOL.
Oh, not to forget: ""Bobby"" goes in two hours from now. Be here!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-14T11:57Z,"@cairodon: Sorry, something is wrong with my eyes... ""Survivors"" of course goes after ""Bobby"" and after ""Being Human"" and after ""The Cove"" ... sometimes later today (or tonight, regarding TZ).
I've seen ""survivor"" without ""s"" and I am sorry again. I  loved Season One and I will put ""Survivors"" in the Schedule."
