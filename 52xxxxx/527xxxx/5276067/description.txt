Reporter Bob Wilton is in search of his next big story when he encounters Lyn Cassady, a shadowy figure who claims to be part of an experimental U.S. military unit. According to Cassady, the New Earth Army is changing the way wars are fought. A legion of â€œWarrior Monksâ€ with unparalleled psychic powers can read the enemyÃ¢Â€â„¢s thoughts, pass through solid walls, and even kill a goat simply by staring at it. Now, the programÃ¢Â€â„¢s founder, Bill Django, has gone missing and CassadyÃ¢Â€â„¢s mission is to find him.
