BBC James May's Toy Stories 6of6 Hornby PDTV x264 576p AC3 MVGroup

James May is out to prove why traditional, old-fashioned toys are still relevant by pushing them to the limit in spectacular, supersize challenges.

Episode 6 - Hornby
James attempts to build the longest ever model railway track - a whopping ten miles long. He builds it in Devon, linking two towns, Barnstaple and Bideford, which last had a train service over forty years ago. Thousands of people turn out to help, but nature and the odds look to be against the plucky little engine in what is certainly James's most ambitious idea yet.
