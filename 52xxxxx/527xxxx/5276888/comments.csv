[V],twentyforty,2010-01-13T19:55Z,"@addictedtomovies: Yes, I will encode BluRay ""Across..."" but next week (when ""24"" starts with three episodes, ""Human target"" and continuation of ""White collar"" and I am not sure about exact day/date of upping.
I am late concerning few requests because of down-time of TPB (my uploads have been delayed by two or more days).
That's the best I can do."
