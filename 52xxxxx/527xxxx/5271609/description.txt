BBC James May's Toy Stories 1of6 Airfix PDTV x264 576p AC3 MVGroup

James May is out to prove why traditional, old-fashioned toys are still relevant by pushing them to the limit in spectacular, supersize challenges. 

Episode 1 - Airfix
James takes model aeroplanes to a new level when he tries to make a full-size Spitfire out of Airfix. The venture soon hits problems when it becomes clear the giant 36-foot pieces may not be strong enough, and nobody knows how they will fit together.
