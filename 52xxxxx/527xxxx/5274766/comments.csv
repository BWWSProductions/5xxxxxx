Greets, thunderbum. You can't blame TrickDonkey for making us wait.

He's a very busy guy right now. There are a whole bunch of dried-up, worn-out, old RACIST relics out there that he has to apologize for.

It's just not easy to convince everyone to judge people by their color, but Trix is going to tell us that it's okay as long as you're a Socialist. Wow, I mean Achtung, where have we heard this one before?

Still waitin' on the coffee whenever you get the time, Trix.

ENDuuuUH!
