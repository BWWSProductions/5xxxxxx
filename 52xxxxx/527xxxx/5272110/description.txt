Some years ago Bruce Wayne fell for a woman named Silver St. Cloud, a beautiful, intelligent young lady... but their relationship ended when she realised that she couldn't cope with Wayne's dangerous double life as the Batman.  Now the Batman and St. Cloud meet again, at a rally for would-be governor - and St. Cloud's fiancee - Evan Gregory.  But when the Joker announces his own candidacy for the job, on a platform of "Vote for me - or I'll kill you!", the Dark Knight is going to have his work cut out... especially when Two-Face gets involved!

Written and illustrated by the classic 70's creative team of Steve Engelhart and Marshall Rogers.
