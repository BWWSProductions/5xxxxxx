I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

*** PLEASE NOTE - I CAN ONLY SEED OVERNIGHT (USA EASTERN TIME - AFTER MIDNIGHT) - REGARDLESS OF WHAT TIME I UP'D THE TORRENT - PLEASE BE PATIENT - I WILL ALWAYS SEED UNTIL COMPLETED BY 25-50 PEOPLE ***

*** FYI there is a asshole/coward who is leaving a bunch of negative [-] ratings on my torrents, so rate this one the way you see it [I'm sure Brother fans will love it] *** "

,NitLions,2010-01-17T22:11Z,"Thanks again for these AMAZING shows!!! The Clapton stuff is especially ridiculous!! Some people may need to cover their ears cuz this is so good your head might explode!! Any chance you could get the ""Great Woods"" show from Massachusetts?  I guess its called the ""Tweeter Center"" now but itll always be Great Woods to me.  Allmans used to start and end their tours there and Ive seen them like 16 times there, they usually rock that place with some amazing shows.  If you can find it that would be awesome"
