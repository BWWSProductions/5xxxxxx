,Hatshepsut,2010-01-25T00:47Z,S01E08. Old news. Season 2 still inproduction
,BoobyFace,2010-02-07T02:23Z,"I think I know what this doofus's malfunction is:
Because there was this huge gap between the airing of episode 7 and episode 8, this [eztv]-ninny has got it into his cpu that anything after ep. 7 is season 2.
Sorry [eztv], but that just aint the case.
Season 1 runs from ep.1 right through to ep. 13.
Perhaps you might like to update your list? "
,PegasusAR,2010-12-26T13:42Z,"I hate to say this, but if eztv has the seasons wrong, then IMdB Pro (Internet Movie Database Pro) has it wrong as well because IMdB Pro has the seasons listed with 7 episodes in seasons 1 and 3 and 6 episodes in seasons 2 and 4."
