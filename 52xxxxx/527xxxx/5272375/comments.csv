,engieT,2010-02-24T02:23Z,"I can't get this to install. Once I mount the .iso I click the install file and it simply asks ""what program do you want to use to open this file"". The install file isn't a .exe so it takes something else to 'make it work', doesn't it? "

Any solution for that problem?

,cavalao1,2010-03-15T22:52Z,"Hy.
Every time i use this matlab for about 5min on my snow leopard it blocks and in the command windows appears this message:
""Warning:
Connection to the X11 Display Server (/tmp/launch-zkgG80/:0) has been lost.
No more graphics windows can no longer be displayed in this session.
Graphics Objects can still be printed, and all commands should still work.
We recommend that you try to save your current session and exit"".
Before that i view X11 closing.

Can anybody helps me?

Thanks"
