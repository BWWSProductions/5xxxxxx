,kenneth329,2010-01-03T07:59Z,"25gigs, no seeds,,,this will be quick  :/"
,cmenges,2010-01-03T15:37Z,This is a very new torrent.  I think that over time the speed will pick up fast.  For two days I think this is going very well.
,yobatsam,2010-01-06T09:28Z,"Dude, all your torrents show 0 seeds."
,cmenges,2010-01-06T19:51Z,"My bit torrent manager shows 4 seeders and 157 leachers as of 13:43 EST.  I do not know whether Pirate Bays information or my information is wrong.  If anyone knows which numbers I should list I woulod appreciate that.  Any concernes or requests can be emailed me at

I am currently attempting to get the other doctors as well.  I will recompiloe those when I am able.  ALSo for my information what would be the best settings for my uploads?  I thought I had it set for max but with the diffrence in numbers I am truely not sure.

Thank you for being there for me to share even with the time involved for the size of these files."
,dja_ace,2010-01-08T01:26Z,"I think people are just snatching and then not seeding. I've had this on my downloads for four days now and haven't even gotten half a gig downloaded. o Seeders, Seeders, where art thou?!"
,EbilNinjaDuckie,2010-01-26T05:01Z,"I am downloading now.  I don't have enough space for everything, so I've left out the Confidentials.  As it's simply common courtesy, I will attempt to leave it to seed til I'm uploading twice of what I'm downloading.  However, as I am at university, the seeding may be interrupted.


A lot."
,EbilNinjaDuckie,2010-01-26T05:06Z,"That being said, I tend to lose hope when in the first ten minutes the number of connected seeds drops from eight to zero, DL speed to 0.1KB/s and the ETA changes to infinity.

Sod it, I'm just going to BUY the damn series.  I don't have the time or space to waste on this."
,misobe202,2010-02-08T23:22Z,Missing The Christmas Invasion from the 2005 episodes.
,Link_Life,2010-08-27T23:57Z,"Uh, if anyone felt like, say, seeding?, that'd be great... Thanks.

Seriously though. Nearly halfway downloaded and suddenly getting 10-15 kbs, which puts a 25 GB torrent's ETA at about eternity. Will seed at least 1:1 once I have it... but I'd need to get it at all. Y'know?"
,lehro,2012-01-19T22:20Z,please seed :(
,adubs132,2012-02-23T05:53Z,could you seed this again?
,byronr16,2012-02-29T15:19Z,"Getting a steady 400/500k, ETA about 18 hours, really can't complain for a 25 Gig download, thank you everyone still seeding this :)"
,Tarquin93,2012-04-26T16:39Z,"Guys to a certain extent, bad download speed is mostly due to a poor Internet connection. I'm on BTInfinity (second best in UK after fibreoptics), and am running at a constant download speed of just under 1mb/s which is quite good for the middle of the day when Internet activity is near its highest"
,Tarquin93,2012-04-26T16:44Z,"Scratch that, now on 2mb/s"
,fshdude96,2012-05-03T22:19Z,"hey just a question, is this torrent 720p or what?"
