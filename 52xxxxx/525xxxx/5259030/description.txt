This is some of my older work, I guess you could say, from back in the
day when I still had the aspirations of becoming a rock/folk star. As I
grow older, my self serving dreams are slowly being replaced by ideals
much higher - to form a charity that will serve the world's most needy,
to serve God's plan for my life, and to not be held to the false norms
and ideals of our past century.

There is so much governmental corruption out there, so much inequity
and war, and needless hatred and violence. Only by tuning ourselves to
a higher frequency range can we ever combat it. This life isn't about
how many cars we have, our spouse, our worthless material things that
leave us when we die- our life is about serving others, those who need
us. We can never do that if we are all wrapped up in this illusory
world inside of our minds. We must be out there, constantly giving help
and charity to those who need us, both far away, and here within our
own homes to our own families and friends.

We must spread a message of peace and compassion, and only then will we
receive it within our own lives.
