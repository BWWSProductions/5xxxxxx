With Daemon Tools it's very easy. You can download it free from google. You open Daemon and press the button that has a icon that looks like paper with a plus sign. Then you find the Nancy Drew folder with the downloaded game, then you play the icon that looks like a play button on Daemon, then autoplay should show up, and you can install. Hope this helps!"
