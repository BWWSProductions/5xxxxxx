This is the debut album from Regina Spektor, a pianist and songwriter now residing in New York, who originally learnt her piano craft in Russia.

These files we're originally 256K M4A's from iTunes and I converted them to MP3 for better compatibility with people's music collections and MP3 players, at the same bitrate. 

There still super drenched audio and sound fantastic.

If there's anyone out there with a CD of this album, how about a FLAC version. We'd love to have it to complete the collection. Thanks a million.
