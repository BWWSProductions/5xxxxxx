Treasure Chest is a 3 disc box set by the German power metal group Helloween.

Originally seen as quite the collection for fans/collector's worldwide the box consists 2 discs compiling (and remastering) some of their finest works of their 1986-2000 albums as well as a third (bonus disc) featuring many rare b'sides from the band's past singles. However since the 2006 remastering and expansion of most of Helloween's back catalogue featuring all of the tracks here (plus much more) this box is now seen as a piece for mainly collector's.
