NOTES:
IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....
Another oscar screener .....lovely bones.We used the source files for our rip and also needed to tweak it up some.
Video was nice but had bad ivtc and seemed to have a too of glare to it,which you normally fine with cams :hmmm:
Anyway we fixed it all up and we kept the original AC3 audio track,didn't see the point in converting to mp3 or lowering
the quality when the video is this good ;-)
Only watermarks are your normal oscar marking at the very bottom of the screen in white.....their not there for that long,nor
that often so .....enjoy

Also know there is other versions out etc...but we thought some of the others were,well over coloured and looked orange.So
we decided to do our rip of it.
