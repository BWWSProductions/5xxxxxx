,artie85,2010-01-02T18:43Z,"66 GB. :DDD

M8, do us a favour, split that in alphabetical order, and post some previews... cos 66GB IS A LOT to DOWNLOAD!"
,soggyorigami,2010-01-19T14:32Z,"Previews can be found at the site he ripped all the pics from:

http://rule34.paheal.net/post/list"
,Gearbox80,2010-01-19T23:00Z,"A full siterip of paheal is included so that I could add their tag data, but that is not the only place the images came from.  They came from every site I ever visited over the past 20 years that had rule34 type images.  Most images tend to find their way to paheal over time though, either though me uploading it there or by someone else adding it.  This is way more than just a paheal rip."
