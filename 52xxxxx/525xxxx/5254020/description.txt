Hazy Jersey-based indie poppers Real Estate have been setting our RSS feeds on fire all summer with tracks like "Fake Blues" and "Black Lake"-- blurry, innocent evocations of high school beach trips and first tokes. (You can get "Beach Comber" right here.)

But by the time the Rising band's self-titled debut album hits shelves on November 17 via Woodsist, this summer will be a distant memory, and we'll probably need summery tunes even more. That's the weirdly sci-fi cover above, and the tracklist, jammed with blog faves, is below.

Next month, Real Estate will hit the road, playing shows with fellow woozy lo-fi types like Vivian Girls and Neon Indian, as well as Girls and Japandroids. Those dates are below.
