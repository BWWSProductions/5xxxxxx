mp4 format!"
,thelogicalghost,2010-01-01T21:22Z,"Whoever finishes downloading first, please post if this is legit and a/v ratings?"
,FANFANFANRalle,2010-01-01T21:27Z,"FINALLY ITS UP!!! Thanks, downloading at 150 kb/s!"
,romulan5000,2010-01-01T21:29Z,"hmmm .mp4 -_-

but at least its up"
,MDinamit,2010-01-01T21:30Z,Downloading at only 20kbs :( . 
,bi-brit,2010-01-01T21:36Z,Thanks
,folro,2010-01-01T21:37Z,My Kb/s rate is around 20-30Kb as-well
,lykwoah,2010-01-01T21:37Z,"THANK YOU! Please, please, please seed, I need this "
,Mystyk,2010-01-01T21:39Z,oooooh thanx man!!! been sooooo waitin fer this!
,FANFANFANRalle,2010-01-01T21:42Z,"Nevermind, downloading at 300 kb/s."
,folro,2010-01-01T21:45Z,still about 25Kb/s
,oggologgo,2010-01-01T21:47Z,"oh ffs, why would you make it mp4?

been waiting anxiously for this ep, and then the first one that comes is freaking mp4.

LAME"
,MDinamit,2010-01-01T21:51Z,"Why MP4?
Probably because the uploaders TV recorder saves in MP4, and the uploader was aiming for speed, not better format so he uploaded it straight away without converting to avi."
,Topunit,2010-01-01T21:53Z,"There's 50 seeds and 3000 peers. It will take time for the torrent to speed up, be patient. There's nothing wrong with MP4. The quality is still great, read the description. If you don't like it, go convert it yourself, it's not too hard - but thanks for the friendly suggestion.

Oh, and, you're welcome."
,MDinamit,2010-01-01T21:53Z,"And I'm actually seeding faster than downloading which is strange, since I live in Croatia where upload barely works."
,caphojer,2010-01-01T21:53Z,thanks!!! 
,fdx180,2010-01-01T21:53Z,"Mine is downloading at max 10kbs.

And it says 0 (42) seeds...how can i get seeds?

Sry I'm newer at this."
,andremo,2010-01-01T21:55Z,who wants avi anyways? it's on ancient container format lacking many features. mkv or ogv are the modern containers that should be used nowadays.
,MDinamit,2010-01-01T21:55Z,"Topunit one question though: what kind of MP4? Is it PSP compatible? Cause its kinda late, and tommorow i go on my skiing trip and want to watch it on my PSP on the way..."
,RavenTrigun,2010-01-01T22:02Z,"Wow look at that leecher count.

All the American's Who are fans are trying to watch it a day early. Can't blame em I am doing it too.

I will be seeding after I am done downloading.
About half way done now."
,oggologgo,2010-01-01T22:02Z,"alrighty, thanks for upping it. I guess I'd rather want one in mp4 now, than wait."
,RavenTrigun,2010-01-01T22:03Z,"Yes MP4 should be PSP compatible, If not Convert It to a Quicktime format."
,Noaru,2010-01-01T22:06Z,"I have only 1 actual seeder in list, is this correct? if so can we get more seeds? Once it downloads I can update this to my VPS and seed from there going at 100+ Mbps."
,artemisbones,2010-01-01T22:07Z,It should be but its all a matter of fram width and height.
,FANFANFANRalle,2010-01-01T22:42Z,"Thanks, finally done! Seeding!"
,squidlips,2010-01-01T23:11Z,"just finshed downloading quality looks great
 thanks topunit"
,Doctor_Horror,2010-01-01T23:17Z,"Hey thanks for the nice download,I just want to say good bye to David you will be missed,I would also like to say good luck to Matt Smith to be honest you are kind of hard to look at as the new Doctor,Karen Gillan will be nice to look at as the new companion .Its like the new show is going to be about Rocky Dennis and his hot blind girlfriend.All jokes aside I love this show and I always will.Now I am going to smoke my bong ....be good."
,xangel0228,2010-01-01T23:32Z,"@Everyone who uses BitTorrent: Please keep in mind that you can copy to another directory for viewing, and let it seed in the original download location! 

I see seeders hopping on and then off... I understand everyones want to watch it right away.. but man the time keeps on fluxing so much. It'll get down to 30 minutes and then skyrocket back up to 2-3 hours! PLEASE KEEP SEEDing!  "
,docbill,2010-01-01T23:53Z,"I hate packet shaping.  I was one of the first to start downloading this, and I'm still looking at at least 6 hours +.   But thanks for the seed.  It is likely this won't be available for on air broadcasts in Canada for a long time.   So without your help I'd have to convince someone else to record this, or wait until I can buy the DVD."
,retrofreak90,2010-01-02T00:23Z,"To Sharaz-jek...GET HELP. I'm glad to see the back of Davies also, but because of his writing not his sexuality. You're pathetic."
,Baliame,2010-01-02T00:33Z,"Bloody americans are eating all the bandwidth and slow down the torrent, COME ON YOU HAVE BBC AMERICA, WATCH IT TOMORROW, LET US WHO COULDN'T SEE IT FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS GET IT TODAY."
,xangel0228,2010-01-02T00:38Z,"@Baliame

Keep in mind that the more of us that get it.. the more seeds, and therefore faster for you to get it. "
,Topunit,2010-01-02T00:44Z,"You're all welcome.

docbill: Me too. It's a common problem here in the UK, all the main ISPs here do it. Most of the time, I only get 10% of the speed when torrenting.

Steven Moffat will be taking Russell T Davies' place, so it should be good I hope. He wrote a few of Doctor Who's episodes, and they were great in my opinion.

I'm still seeding at 10MBytes/s on a VPS. Just wait a while for the number of seeders to increase. There's 8x more leechers."
,xangel0228,2010-01-02T00:56Z,Seeding at high bandwidth. I hope this helps. 
,Green_Banana,2010-01-02T01:00Z,Why is this in mp4 format?  Are you fucking retarded?  
,dmitriw,2010-01-02T01:02Z,"I'm getting terrible download speeds...but I'm sharing at 100kbps+.  Come on, people, please seed!  I'd like to see this before I go to work tonight..."
,wufeng,2010-01-02T01:07Z,"@sharaz_jek: You may be the only person who ever gave a damn about any homosexual references in Doctor Who. Us normal people understand that those references are part of the BACKGROUND.

@Normal People: Man I love this series please seed I think we have to wait for ages before it airs in Australia..."
,docbill,2010-01-02T02:00Z,"No audio when I play it on my computer with vlc or Nero.   If I play it on my media player, the receiver can't process the audio but the TV can.   The audio is extremely tinny, like it is coming over a cell phone.   So I think I'll have to download another version before I can actually watch this."
[T],n2kmaster,2010-01-02T02:16Z,Big virtual smooch from canada for this!
[T],n2kmaster,2010-01-02T02:22Z,"WOW the speed is shit, 2032 seeds and getting a whopping 0.9 kbs speed down, i cant even get the info at the speed i want to seed this at. Horrible guys, fn share will ya"
,Glitchz,2010-01-02T02:35Z,"Great Torrent, But PLEASE PLEASE SEED. I am in Australia and i wont be able to c this on TV for at least a year maybe more, so if you can watch it on TV tomorrow on the even in the next week then please w8 until then because we cant download it when there are 9k leechers and only 1.7k seeders"
,Glitchz,2010-01-02T02:48Z,"Great Torrent, But PLEASE SEED i have 1.5mbps download speed and i am only getting and average of 24kb/s do if your in America and your so impatient that you cant wait a few days and watch it on TV then think about all us Aussies that wont be able to watch it on TV for at least a year maybe more"
,xangel0228,2010-01-02T02:51Z,I am seeding between 70-100 Kbps.. I will leave it on as long as I can as I am on my parents computer their house. 
,docbill,2010-01-02T03:28Z,"While I appreciate the effort, a file that I can not play is fairly useless, so I stopped seeding."
,wufeng,2010-01-02T04:19Z,man the speed is slow...I'm whooping for joy whenever it gets past 20 kb/s...
,CaptainMidnight,2010-01-02T04:44Z,"I've never seen so many idiots around. ""Why effing MP4?"" Because AVI is inferior, maybe? AVI and MP4 are nothing but containers. There is nothing AVI can handle that MP4 can't, but the reverse is certainly not true. And MP4 is an ISO standard, while AVI is something kludged together from a Microsoft format introduced in the early 1990s. If you want to be trapped in the past, go ahead, but stop whining about the people who want to keep moving into the future.

As for speed, something is wrong with your system if you're only getting a few kBps. I had 200-300kBps around 11 p.m. GMT.

Hope everybody keeps seeding. Right now, there are almost 3500 seeders and 7400 peers. Let's get it to 10000 seeders! No wonder BBC threw in the towel and stopped trying to keep the program from BBC America long after the UK premiere. By the time they finally air it weeks later, everybody interested will already have seen it. Their one day delay isn't so bad right now, but they really need to get the message that it's impossible and they should just show it the same day on both sides of the pond."
,silverdra,2010-01-02T04:55Z,"I dont usually post comments, but for this I had to for two reason.

1)  David Tennant, best Doctor ever and best exit ever.  Myself and friends had goose bumps and a few tears during the last 15 mins or so.  He will be missed  Russel T. Davies, Fantastic writer and I hope the storylines match up to his standards with the new doctor.

2) @sharaz_jek.  Fuck Off :D  wait...no, I can do better.  You homophobic little twat.  Why dont you just never post again and go fuck your mother or somethin.  I am sure growing up with  hillbilly family was rough with all that incest and beastiality, especially with you Father also probably being your Brother, but dont take it out on the world, take it out on the local bike that gave birth to you.  They should ban her pussy until she learns how to bring up kids with normal attitude to life rather than the twisted minded, webbed footed prick lick you.

That was fun :D  Nice work uploader"
,CaptainMidnight,2010-01-02T05:15Z,"Glitchz,

If your DL speed is low, blame your ISP, not Americans. And not all Americans get BBC America, so they won't be watching it tomorrow.

Docbill,

What do you mean a file you can't play? VLC or MPlayer can easily handle this. The only reason you might not be able to play this back is if you have a very old, slow computer that can't handle H.264 playback or if you're dead set on playing this back on a standalone player without H.264. If that's the case, then you need a lower quality Xvid version of this, but otherwise it's nothing that needs special hardware."
,Synthesist,2010-01-02T05:17Z,"Hear, hear to CaptainMidnight."
,Liam137,2010-01-02T06:29Z,"Thanks for uploading this, the only problem is the speed. my upload speed is sky rocketing but my download is hovering around 5kb/s. does anyone know a way to make my download speed higher?"
,wufeng,2010-01-02T06:32Z,To people who have a speed problem: I just updated my utorrent progam and it may be a coincidence but download speed has doubled
,MDinamit,2010-01-02T07:20Z,"Still downloading lol. Speed on 100kbs though, hope it downloads on time."
,MDinamit,2010-01-02T07:34Z,"Somehow, my yelling on the monitor saying ""go up you motherfucking speed! uppp! ok, 100kbs, stay there! NOOO dont go down again!"" caused my speed to actually stay on 100kbs. LOL."
,CaptainBollocks,2010-01-02T07:46Z,I will be seeding until 6 am EST. 
,CaptainBollocks,2010-01-02T08:24Z,Is anyone still downloading??? Please comment back or else I stop seeding.
,docbill,2010-01-02T08:27Z,"@CaptainMidnight

I already commented about the problem.   The audio does not play on my computer with either nero or vlc.  Watching the video without sound is sort of pointless.  My receiver can also not play the audio.   My media player can send the audio to the TV, but it sounded so badly distorted I gave-up after watching the first 2 minutes.

After several attempts, and a couple of hours of computer time I managed to convert the video with avidemux to something that would play.   But since converting lossy formats always adds more compression artifacts, so I'm still downloading a version that is more friendly."
,CaptainBollocks,2010-01-02T08:27Z,Whatever I am done.
,Doctor_Horror,2010-01-02T10:30Z,Matt Smith looks like Rocky Dennis from MASK.
,Gambit-El,2010-01-02T15:24Z,Awsome velocity. and awsome video quality!! Tys mate!! and? happy New Year too!!!
,CaptainMidnight,2010-01-02T15:35Z,"docbill,

Sounds like something seriously out of whack with your system, not with the file. Nobody else has complained about audio or video problems. I had no problems whatsoever."
,piryte,2010-01-02T20:33Z,thank you for putting this up! good quality! :)
,Doctor_Horror,2010-01-02T21:39Z,"I know we will all miss David Tennant,But I dont think its the last time we will see him on the show ,David Tennants half human doctor is still with Rose,so im sure they have to do something with that....Lets see ,they just brought back the Master from a ring,Donna Still has the stuff in her head,David Tennants half human Doctor is still alive...So they do have lots of ways to bring Tennant back as the Doctor if Matt Smiths Doctor does not sell well...I can already see we will be hearing Geronimo !  a lot as the new Doctors Catch phrase ,I dont know if thats good or not.Good Luck Matt Smith."
,docbill,2010-01-03T03:59Z,"@Captain Jack
Could well be.  I find it strange that I was able to convert the video with avidemux, even though the original won't play.   I did some googling, and found many references to people who don't hear the audio when playing videos with mp4a audio in vlc.   Unfortunately, the suggested solution is for Linux, not for Windows.

And of course it is quite common for my popcorn hour to have problems when the less common codec and resolution settings are change.   avidemux also crashes on the file if I don't select ""safe mode"".   So chances are the B-Frames are corrupt.  However, that should not prevent the audio from playing, it should just cause a loss of synchronization."
,thehellz,2012-03-17T05:26Z,"Working well! But the video seem cropped compared to the ""FoV"" version and the BBC logo is in the corner. Thank you anyway :)"
