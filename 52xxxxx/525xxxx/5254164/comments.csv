,TriSpirit,2010-01-03T02:23Z,"Btw Downloaders, Or leechers... I am trying to make the download faster...however Your going to just have to deal with it. 

There are no viruses, No bad stuff...just extract and play...

This Seed is alive and still being seeded by me On January 2nd, 2010. I'll be seeding for a planned 30 more days. So whatever works.

If there's an extraction question... DOWNLOAD ""UNIVERSAL EXTRACTOR""... just google it... it's a free program that you can use to open just about any file out there."
,TriSpirit,2010-01-03T12:33Z,"I may occasionally Pause the download...but On all my down time I will Be uploading as fast as possible ( I like to play games and watch videos online too :P)

But rest assured I will keep seeding... And if any of you can seed, please do so :D, you can always dupe the file if you got the hard drive space and seed with one and play with another :D please and thank you."
,horatiu665,2010-01-03T13:09Z,"wtf man, just upload the mod. do you expect users to download a full 2 gb installation just for some 5 minute ramble on a new mod?

I have d2 installed. downloading the full game again for a mod is just bullshit. you suck. please upload the mod alone.

nobody is going to start playing diablo 2 with this mod.

and this is not a hate comment. it is just my opinion spiced up a bit."
,TriSpirit,2010-01-03T21:19Z,"LoL well dude... if your *smart* enough to download just the mod, Then Your *smart* enough to find it on the net yourself.  

I'll tell you exactly what you have to do :P
And I'll start at the begining for all you scrubs who wanna start your journey outta Noob town.

1. Your going to have to Find a download that is in Iso Format. ( Iso, file extension means that it's basically just a virtual CD) 

2. Your going to have to Find a program like Daemon Tools, Or what I use, Clone drive. To Mount and run those iso Files in. ( Or you can just burn the iso file to a disc if you really want to waste the cds)

3. Install the Game. ( some Games like this D2, will require you to Have a Key Generator or to look for applicable Keys online- A simple google search is usually enough to get it)

4. For This version and most mods, The mods are usually designed for a specific Version of the game, which means you have to A. Make sure the version you just downloaded and installed isn't beyond that patch ( usually displayed in numbers on the title screen like version. 1.6834 or whatever) B. Once that is confirmed you have to Find and Download the proper patch, For this Diablo 2, it's patch 1.10 exactly, not before or after... otherwise it won't work in act 5 specifically.

5. Once you have the Game patched up, it's time to Install the mod. In the case of Diablo 2, This mod is just a simple drag and drop into the D2 folder and a replacing of the MPQ file. For other games it's usually alot more complicated. But when you download a mod, There is usually a ""Read me"" Do Exactly as it says, if you can't find a file to edit or whatever it says, run a search, and Do everything in the exact order it says.

7. now That you are officially mod'ed, It's time to Crack the game. You Gotta find and download a CD-less crack ( some games are a little bit more complicated to crack Example being Spore) The cd-less crack is usually just a exe, that replaces the exe in the game folder ( aka NOT the one on your desktop newb :D) 

8. now that everything is done congrats, you've began a journey of knowledge, now play your fucking game. 

Once again, this Seed is for people who don't want to do all the leg work I did, and are not too keen on learning to do shit for themselves."
