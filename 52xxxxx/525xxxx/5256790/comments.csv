,panzersiddhartha,2010-01-05T22:37Z,"wastedbrat - Are you a bot automatically pasting that comment into things? If so, thank you for not going on about some lousy virus ridden page like your brothers. If not, stop posting the same thing everywhere and download winrar or winzip, install the program of your choice and then just right click any of those small files you mentioned and choose Extract here. Then it will create that larger file that you can view in VLC."

,hayden1,2010-02-28T02:45Z,"@HeyYou88:

When they say ""HDTV"" it usually means that the show was recorded from an HD source and then downgraded by the encoder/DVR. Recording from an HD source greatly increases quality of the video versus an SD source.

Tip: You know its in true HD if it has 720p or (more rarely) 1080p in the title."
