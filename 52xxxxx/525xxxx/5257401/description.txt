Wayne Petherick, Brent Turvey, Claire Ferguson, "Forensic Criminology"
Academic Press | 2009 | ISBN: 0123750717 | 624 pages | PDF

Forensic Criminology: the scientific study of crime and criminals for the purposes of addressing investigative and legal issues. It is a science, a behavioral science, and a forensic science. This text is intended to educate students in an applied fashion regarding the nature and extent of forensic casework that is supported by, dependent upon, and interactive with research, theory, and knowledge derived from criminology. It is also intended to act as a preliminary guide for practitioners working with and within related criminal justice professions. Particularly those involved with assisting investigations, administrative inquiries, legal proceedings or providing expert findings or testimony under oath. It is offered as an applied scientific sub-discipline within the domain of general criminology, as well as a roadmap to the forensic realm for the uninitiated.

Written by the authors of the best-selling Criminal Profiling, now in its third edition, and the groundbreaking Forensic Victimology, Forensic Criminology provides a bridge between the broad constructs of theoretical criminology and the forensic examination of individual cases. It serves as a textbook for college and university coursework, as a manual for practitioners, and as career guide for students.
