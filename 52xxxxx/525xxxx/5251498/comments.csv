,BikeBert,2010-01-06T00:03Z,"I tried many previous DK 2010 and none of them worked. Hence, I went back to 2009. Now, I tried this one on two different laptops and it works great. Thank you!"
,BikeBert,2010-01-06T00:22Z,"BTW, if you have a SSD , the HyperFast is just working miracles. I have the OCZ Vertex 60GB and the speeds degraded after some time without DK running, even with TRIM enabled on Win7. Since I installed DK with HyperFast the speed stay up. "
,w1cked16,2010-01-06T08:51Z,"Thank you!  I have tried many other diskeeper torrents with no luck.  After a few days I could not manually defragment anymore, but this fix works great!
Diskeeper is much better than perfectdisk too."

,christ77,2010-01-21T09:22Z,"ok I will write more detailed what I did for step #3

basically under diskeeper patch x32  etc folder
i opened the fix 32 folder
and I replaced the 3 files with the same 3 files in the actuall program folder.
but you have to first close down the program manually through windows task manger/ processes.
then complete the rest of the instructions and restart the computer and you should be good to go."
,fersenhalter,2010-01-22T13:24Z,"Works! Just followed the instruction and I had no problems whatsoever

Now I have to see if it's better than O&O...

,dragon766,2010-02-13T05:27Z,Can anyone help? Have program loaded and stopped with task manager-applied cracks-restarted-tells me this is trial version and I do not understand regedit. Do I have to do this manually? How?
,Gownaar,2010-03-16T15:57Z,"Been a long time Diskeeper user and I'm sorry to say - v2010 sucks, I'm sticking with 2009. First thing you should do with the new version is turn off IntelliWrite. It may sound good in theory, but in practice, deliberate fragmentation of free space (that's what it comes down to) is not a good idea. But even without it, the problem is, I would call it excessive activity. It seems as though as automatic defrag now takes 10x more i/o operations to achieve the same goal as the previous version. And 2 weeks after I installed 2010, it was still defragging away like my disk was randomly filled with data, it simply didn't feel right. The bottom line is: newer is not necessarily better and if you think Diskeeper 2009 is superior, you're not the only one."
,Gownaar,2010-03-16T16:08Z,"One more piece of info to share with fellow Diskeeper users: there's a little util called DkSwitch (freeware, available @ Softpedia). It's used to control Diskeeper, e.g. if you want to pause it while you're performing some disk-intensive task."
,Sidewinder42,2010-03-20T21:58Z,"OK, followed the instructions, but how exactly do you ""apply regkey""?
Sorry, haven't had much experience with mucking around with the registry."
,Faziri,2010-05-05T13:26Z,"Oh, awesome software "
,apishwin1991,2010-05-11T19:15Z,Excellent Torrent. Diskeeper Guys Sure are Awesome

,BundD,2010-07-22T03:59Z,Do you start the diskeeper service after all the steps?
