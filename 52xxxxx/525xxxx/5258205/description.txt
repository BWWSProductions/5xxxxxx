A typical farce from Michel Audiard, French screenwriter and director, the French Preston Sturges in a way. a bunch of oddballs, living in a shanty town in Paris outskirts, liquidate visitors and foreigners thru a special machine. the cast is a collection of famous French actors. michel Audiard put no boundaries to his imagination in this post1968 movie, conceived as a ludicrous comedy for oddball actors. The wittiness of the lines of michel audiard are,as always,sheer delight and hilarity in the voice of bernard blier. all the fun comes from those pungent and witty lines, which does not really make up the thin plot and low budget.
