,Samjj,2010-05-01T12:03Z,thanx for the game!
,Equilite,2010-05-31T10:37Z,"Installed the game. No instructions were provided with the torrent from the uploader. Simply a folder named, ""crack"". It contained a file named ""POP2.EXE"". Presumably copy and replace the original POP2.EXE file. Tried to start the game, and it continued to ask for the CD to play the game.

Meh."
,Equilite,2010-05-31T10:58Z,"Had to waste a DVD-R on it. It's a horrific game. Maximum resolution is 1280x960. After waiting about 4 minutes watching the dull scenes, I was finally given control. When I was, everything was dark and gray. Seems like a VERY old and inefficiently created game. Highly not recommended."
,Xirapte,2010-06-06T07:09Z,Awesome game. Installed perfectly and the cracked works flawlessly. I salute you! I like this game more then the two thrones since it is actually HAS decapitations.
,bootwhistle,2010-06-09T09:49Z,"Works fine, installed and copied the crack to the installation folder. Had some video issues so had to run in safe mode but more of a problem with game than the torrent. In any event thanks for the nifty upload!"

Please Reply if someone knows...what the problem is.."
,underclock4,2011-07-13T12:07Z,"Hi Guys,
I applied the crack and the game was launched but when I tried the following day to launch again I was informed that I have to launch through a path (PrinceOfPersia.exe). Can't seem to find that anywhere, even when I typed the path in the search section.
Any solutions anyone...please!!!! "
