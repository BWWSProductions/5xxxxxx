nice system but out of date so beware its not very new but does support Mac Classic
so  thats a good thing about it but if you have a Intel or AMD PC you could get Snow Leopard or Leopard or Tiger, just go to a bittorrent site and search it "make sure you have something typed about X86 OR AMD and INTEL"







"WARNING the X86 INTEL and AMD versions may not support your system hardware wise or it just wont boot so no promises but i have tryed them and they worked rarely so be careful and back up your files and and such cause if it does not work your hard drive will be erased and deleted sometimes so play it safe"
