Contains all 25 episodes and the spoken language is English.  Only caveat is that there are Italian subtitles which of course cannot be undone using WMP but if you have divx or VLC player, you can at least turn the subtitles off by right clicking the video screen and choosing to turn off subtitles.  If you do not have divx, you can always download it right here at tpb.  Now hopefully, the above info will prevent most of you from bitching and complaining--hopefully-lol.  Anyway, enjoy!!!!
