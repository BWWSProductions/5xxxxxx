People: you can watch the eps on the official site anyway, I certainly won't bother downloading this from this clown any more."

I have watched both episodes from MTV.com as well as these torrents. The torrent episodes are full episodes were the MTV streamed episodes are watered down, filtered, missing some content, albeit a little. 

Thats why I choose to DL these instead. "
