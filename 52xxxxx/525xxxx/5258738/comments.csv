You know...""trembling"" is a good choice of words, here.  It is the one thing that the american people have learned to do together - and they do it well."

I am assuming that the torrent uploader is Jewish. Hence, the spelling of G-D in without the O. The reason behind it is this; Jews are forbidden to transcribe the name of God into a written or physical form for fear that it can become defaced."
,Ploni,2010-04-02T10:48Z,"These comments are disturbing. The movie is spelled how it appears on the DVD jacket. That is the title of the film, spelled like that... The uploader may or may not be of any religion, the title of the film is Trembling Before G-d and it is spelled that way for several reasons, one was mentioned earlier and there are several more. Anyone sincerely interested could easily find out.

Can anyone seed? I have a religious (Christian) friend living in the West Bank who would benefit greatly from the film. "
,Diesel67,2010-04-04T22:06Z,I'm the uploader but I can't seem to get my own torrents to seed.  Can somebody help me?
