JosÃ© Montserrate Feliciano GarcÃ­a (born September 10, 1945) is a Puerto Rican - American singer, virtuoso guitarist and composer, known for many international hits including the 1970 holiday single, "Feliz Navidad". He was born permanently blind owing to congenital glaucoma.
 
Feliciano was born in Lares, Puerto Rico, one of eleven children. He was first exposed to music at age three. At five, his family moved to Spanish Harlem, New York City and, at age nine, he played on the Teatro Puerto Rico. He started his musical life playing accordion until his grandfather gave him a guitar. He reportedly sat by himself in his room for up to 14 hours a day to listen to 1950s rock albums, classical guitarists such as AndrÃ©s Segovia, and jazz players such as Wes Montgomery. He later had classical lessons with Harold Morris who earlier had been a student with Segovia. 
At 17, he quit school to play in clubs, having his first professional, contracted performance in Detroit.
