Marvel Graphic Novel was Marvel's attempt at emulating European-style graphic novels, with big-name creators, complete-in-one-volume stories, 8.5 x 11 dimensions and fancy paper and printing.  At the same time, it had one foot firmly rooted in the four-color pamphlet tradition, with plenty of emphasis on super-heroes and a decision to number each volume in sequence despite the fact that none of the books were connected in any way but a blanket title. The series began in early 1982 with Jim Starlin's Death of Captain Marvel and continued with the 8.5 x 11 format and an increasingly sporadic schedule into 1993 with "Daredevil & Black Widow: Abattoir."

Marvel numbered stories through 1985 up to number 20, but released many other stories in the same format that are considered unnumbered parts of the series according to the Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide. Overstreet continued counting beyond the original "official" numbering, following a Marvel-published list of graphic novels. When the list stopped being published, Overstreet stopped trying to number the issues, halting at issue 38.
