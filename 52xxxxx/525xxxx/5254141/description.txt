Eminent artist friends and peers of this year's five honorees converged in Washington, D.C. on Sunday, December 6 to present 
entertaining and heartfelt tributes at the 32nd annual Kennedy Center Honors, an entertainment special to be broadcast Tuesday, 
Dec. 29 (9:00-11:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network, with Caroline Kennedy as host for the seventh consecutive year. 
This marks the 32nd anniversary of this acclaimed special, which has been broadcast on CBS each year since its debut in 1978. 
This annual event recognizes recipients for their lifetime contributions to American culture through the performing arts in 
dance, music, theater, opera, motion pictures and television.

Performers and presenters included Roger Bart, Gary Beach, Jack Black, Matthew Broderick, Harry Connick, Jr., Cory English, 
Simon Estes, Melissa Etheridge, Aretha Franklin, Angela Gheorghiu, Herbie Hancock, Ben Harper, Shuler Hensley, Harvey Keitel, 
Ron Kovic, Jane Krakowski, Richard Kind, Frank Langella, John Mellencamp, Matthew Morrison, Jennifer Nettles, Edward Norton, 
Carl Reiner, Kennedy Center Chairman Stephen A. Schwarzman, Martin Scorsese, Martin Short, Jon Stewart, Ben Stiller, Sting, 
Sharon Stone, Meryl Streep, and Eddie Vedder.

President and Mrs. Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were seated with the honorees in the Presidential Box of the 
Kennedy Center Opera House, after having just hosted the traditional White House reception for the honorees.

Host Caroline Kennedy commenced the festivities by quoting her father, President John F. Kennedy, who said, "I look forward 
to an America that will not be afraid of grace and beauty. I look forward to an America that will reward achievement in the 
arts as we reward achievement in business or statecraft." She described the five 2009 honorees as "a piano virtuoso from the 
California hills whose inspired rhythms made him Americaâ€™s herald of a new age of jazz; a good fella from the mean streets 
of New York who redefined acting and made movie audiences an offer they couldnâ€™t refuse; the little girl from a St. Louis 
church choir who could hit high C and became the diva we cheered in the houses of grand opera; a mischievous boy from Brooklyn 
who provoked billions of laughs by walking loudly and carrying a big schtick; and a rocker from the Jersey Shore who composed 
his own musical universe and â€“ across America and the world â€“ became the Boss."
