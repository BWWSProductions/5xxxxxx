Episode4: Fish.
Fish dominate the planet's waters through their variety of shape and behaviour. The weedy sea dragon looks like a creature from a fairytale, and the male protects their eggs by carrying them on his tail. The sarcastic fringehead, meanwhile, appears to turn its head inside out when it fights. Slow motion cameras show the flying fish gliding through the air like a flock of birds and capture the world's fastest swimmer, the sailfish, plucking sardines from a shoal at 100 mph.
