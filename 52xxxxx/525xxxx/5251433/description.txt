And it's finally here. Season 2 of Moomin in English. My personal favorite
season of the 3 I've made torrents of so far. Only one thing to really give
you all a heads up on, and that is when I had gotten my season 3 DVD I had
noticed the first episode of season 3 "Aunt Jane" is the last episode of
season 2. As I have all ready gotten that episode out there, I've decided
I'm just going to leave Aunt Jane out of this season. It's obviously found
in the season 3 torrent.

Anyway, happy new years everyone. Spread the torrent around to as many
trackers as you'd like. I had intended to get this torrent out yesterday,
but due to poor time management and my desire to play my brand new PS3
I never really got around to finishing it up yesterday! So here it is now.

As always, please just leave a little thank you to confuse me into thinking this is all worth the trouble. Have a good one dudes.

Enjoy.
