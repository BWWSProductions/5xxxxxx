,WammerMammer,2010-01-06T16:53Z,This is a great version!!!! Actually the best I've seen but it is TOO DARK. I turned the contrast and the brightness all the way up and it is still dark. Please fix because all the other Avatar copies on here have German or Russian subs hard coded and it looks stupid to overlay other subs on top of the Germ ones.
,jstang73,2010-01-07T03:10Z,"Wammer Mammer . . . I never claimed to be Devise, I just uploaded a great copy of Avatar I found and gave the credit to the originators in the title, so F**k off."
,K10ud,2010-03-22T18:43Z,"Wow their jstang73, chill a bit, it sounds to me like wammermammer the first comment he was just praising you, and in the second he was giving you a compliment by telling you you're not devise. "
