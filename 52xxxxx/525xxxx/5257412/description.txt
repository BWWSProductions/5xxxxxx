From Wiki:


Footloose is a 1984 American film that tells the story of Ren McCormack, played by Kevin Bacon, a teenager who was raised in Chicago. McCormack moves to a small town where the local government has banned dancing and rock music. Ren and his classmates want to have a senior prom with music and dancing. They must figure out a way to get around the law and Reverend Shaw Moore, played by John Lithgow, who blames rock music's influence for the death of his first child.
The movie was loosely based on events that took place in the tiny, rural farming community of Elmore City, Oklahoma.[1] Much of the film was filmed in Utah County, Utah. 






Footloose 1984

Footloose is the original soundtrack of the Paramount Motion Picture, Footloose. The original nine-track album was released in 1984 (see 1984 in music) and reached Number One on the Billboard 200 Pop Album chart on April 21, 1984, where it stayed until June 30, 1984. When it was re-released in 1998, four bonus tracks were added to the album. In 2002, Sony International released the Australian Souvenir Edition (aka Australian Cast Special Edition). Two megamixes were added to the album, featuring the Australian Cast of the Footloose musical. The original soundtrack contained three Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 hits, including two #1 hits, Kenny Loggins' "Footloose" and Deniece Williams' "Let's Hear It for the Boy", and "Almost Paradise", a duet by Ann Wilson and Mike Reno that reached #7.
