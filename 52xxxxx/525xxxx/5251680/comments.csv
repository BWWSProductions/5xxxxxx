Do NOT download this - it has a trojan!"
,NeophobE,2010-01-07T09:50Z,"UnArchiving....

Looking...

Scanning for Virii, spyware, Malicious files, etc...

Still waiting...

Still waiting...

Still Scanning and waiting....

Smoking a Ciggy, packing a cone...

still scanning...

still farking scanning...

NOTHING!!!


Dude, I think you should send Me some of those drugs you're on.... I can't find anything and if anyone else does I'll delete it but My AV can't find anything.... 

Think I'll go smoke that cone now...."
,alexmahon940,2010-01-13T00:22Z,My AV doesn't have a problem with it
,AbelLP,2010-01-13T22:41Z,Does anyone know how to crack this program to load it from its shortcut?
,AbelLP,2010-01-13T23:24Z,"Well, my McAfee detected a trojan like 8x57IS said, maybe you should change your anti-virus, sorry NeophobE..."
,slka,2010-01-17T20:17Z,"I haven't downloaded this, but from what I hear, I believe that trojan you speak of is the crack, but I'm no expert so... go with your gut feeling.

You'll have to disable your McAfee virus protection to get the crack to work, but  don't forget to restore the crack after disabling your virus protection."
,slka,2010-01-17T20:20Z,"One more thing,
                         if the trojan is in the setup file, your pretty much going to get into some deep shit.

However, if its in a separate folder, chances are that is the crack."
,NeophobE,2010-01-20T14:49Z,"it's all good AbelLP, I believe it is the crack and it's not a virus but as many cracks do, it is detected as a virus because it works like one. I was going to delete it but no, I know it works and My system is not infected, used both latest AVG and Nortons 360, and We can all decide for our selves if We trust enough to use it or we could always avoid the virii all together and go buy the fucka.... 10 seeds, can't be too bad..."
[T],MrLore,2010-01-29T17:09Z,"avast! finds nothing suspect with the .rar nor it's contents. However during installation it came across a file within the start menu it didn't like.

Could be a coincidence, either way I won't be using it as it gives a ""discontinued product"" error."
,urdoomd,2010-02-06T21:43Z,"Kaspersky found a trojan within the daemon tools installer, found nothing in the crack but if it is a known issue it might have been fixed in a newer version and I've downloaded the installer from the website which is newer and it has found nothing. Will not be installing this but I will download another torrent with the same executable and try again or from the website if they have the older version for download"
,urdoomd,2010-02-06T22:15Z,"Yup, virus in the installer. Just downloaded from elsewhere, but this version is discontinued anyway. *delete* Will be waiting for a crack for 308----------"
