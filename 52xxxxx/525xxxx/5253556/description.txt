Install Boeing 777-200 Boeing 777-300 many textures and addons, airport chart install and groundhandling. Changes made by me and thanks to suporte base material of opensky and much more entusiasts of planes Full Freeware.

1-First unzipp the file to desktop

2-Open dir (to install  for FSX), 

3-Open dir (apchart)

4-Inside dir apchart to install airportchart, run setup, for windows XP continued installation to the end.
For VISTA and WIN7 run apinst a file created after you run setup and aborted by error of security, no problem with software, only license/certificate cost money

5-Copy the dir (Microsoft Flight Simulator X) for your pathgame with same name Microsoft games/Microsoft Flight Simulator X, 

where you have the game installed.

Nothing more...You have now, inside the panel microsoft radar, airport chart and  groundhandling, inflight.

Activeted this addon (see views menu) depends on your choice.

Best flight
