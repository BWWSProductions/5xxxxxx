 It sounds as if would be mono at 64 kB/s sound quality."

This is LOSSLESS! and this is NOT SOURCED FROM A VIDEO, BUT THIS IS AN EXCELLENT AUDIENCE RECORDING!

Excellent for a bootleg of course, if you're so stupid that you still don't understand these things, you have just one thing to do: SHUT UP!"

I ALWAYS APLOAD MUSIC IN AAC HIGH QUALITY FROM THE ORIGINAL ALBUMS.
