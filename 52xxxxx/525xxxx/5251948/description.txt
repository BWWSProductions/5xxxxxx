The David Bowie portion of this show is available on the silver pressed bootleg "A Hyper Circle" and the more rare NIN portion on something called "Closer to Trent"Whether this was an actual silver boot is unknown 
since I cannot find any artwork or actual people who have it. 
These recordings are from the same DAT(?) source
 since the overlapping portions of the show have identical crowd noise and sound level fluctuations.  This is NOT sourced from a video.


"A Hyper Circle" is sourced from the boot, but the NIN portion came without lineage info and has a slightly worse sound quality.  Tracks 1-10 from "Closer to Trent" and tracks 11-31 from "A Hyper Cirlce".

Apart from the recording starting during first verse of Terrible Lie, there is only one small gap between the two recordings.  Because "Closer to Trent" skips Eraser and "A Hyper Circle" starts at the begining of Eraser, the crowd cheering after Down In It is cut.

Thanks to the original taper.

Many thanks to gladcarrot for having uploaded this recording to Dime. I renamed tracks and added tags (in addition to editing the info file), so this torrent hasn't the same info hash as the one previously shared. All I have to say is that this is an Excellent (IMO) Audience Recording, even if not as good as some others like Camden, with the NIN portion sounding slightly worse (as said by gladcarrot).
