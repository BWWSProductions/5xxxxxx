,psphackerowned,2010-01-14T02:58Z,this has to be terrible quality
,Dharquen,2010-03-01T11:32Z,"The Quality is great! All mkv's. 
Is there any chance that the rest of the episodes will be posted in this quality? I do hope so!

A = 9 / V = 9"
,shadd22,2010-03-08T20:57Z,Yes! Thank you so much! Perfect encode and perfect video! Please put the other episodes up as soon as you can.
,ThePalindorme,2010-04-01T07:23Z,".mkv is like a compressed format for a video file.
Its perfect for viewing having great quality audio and video. But it would be hard to make a dvd out of it......."
,ThePalindorme,2010-04-02T21:30Z,"woah awesome quality
10/10.
dont know what episodes are these though, neither from which seasons........
Still an important part of dexter, wish you uploaded the rest"
,q1key,2010-05-12T00:43Z,"These are all of the episodes of Dexter's Laboratory through season 2, episode 7. It also has the season 1 pilot episode.

Both the audio and video quality are great.. Thanks!.."
,smilisav,2011-04-16T17:29Z,"@psphackerowned Smaller files can be terrible quality only if older codec used (DivX, XviD, ...)
Newer ones (mkv, mp4) can give good quality at this size. So, ppl could get new K-Lite and some newer free video re-coder and make all faster to download and easier to seed.

Going to download and watch."
,markpriss,2011-05-31T12:26Z,89virgo89 can you please upload the rest of the episodes ? I'll seed ! =P 
,altoiddealer,2011-07-08T23:47Z,"This is currently the best Dexter's Laboratory torrent on the internet.

I say this because all of the other torrents have the episodes merged together in the most asinine way. The most popular Dexter's Lab torrent actually has episodes from completely different seasons in the same video file!

I would LOVE if the rest of the episodes were uploaded in this fashion"
,superche2005,2011-07-15T19:14Z,"DL-ing is slow but this one is worth to wait. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!

You got some Johnny Bravo and Cow and Chicken episodes as well??

(Hope it will speed up a bit though!)"
,ZooSam,2011-08-21T05:10Z,"@89virgo89 dude, can u upload more episodes?

,89virgo89,2011-10-14T10:25Z,"Yes people. I understand your interest. But sorry for such a late reply after many years. This is all the stuff i had, so i could upload only this much. I'll try to upload more, if i get any more stuff. "
