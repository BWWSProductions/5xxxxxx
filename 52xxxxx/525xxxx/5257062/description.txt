Storyline: Ryan Bingham's job is to fire people from theirs. The anguish, hostility, and despair of his 
"clients" has left him falsely compassionate, living out of a suitcase, and loving every second of it. When his boss hires arrogant 
young Natalie, she develops a method of video conferencing that will allow termination without ever leaving the office - essentially 
threatening the existence Ryan so cherishes. Determined to show the naive girl the error of her logic, Ryan takes her on one of his 
cross country firing expeditions, but as she starts to realize the disheartening realities of her profession, he begins to see the 
downfalls to his way of life.

NOTE : I have tested this on the PS3 and works fine.
I have noticed lots of nobs are posting fakes using my name only grab films from genuine SecretMyth, MajorTJKong and LifeChanger accounts or straight from the source
