Recommend playing h264 mp4s with KMPlayer or VLC Player.

Play on TV with PS3, XBox (2ch), WD HD TV, or Popcorn Hour."

,diego1283,2010-01-05T01:53Z,Does anyone know how to add the subtitles when im playing on ps3? is there any tutorial how to do it? THANKS!!
,CA5,2010-01-05T03:32Z,"Thanks for the movies Myth, long time follower, first time commenting.

I wouldn't normally request a film but this is one you have done before and doesn't seem to work (on PS3 or 360 atleast anyway), The Hurt Locker. This is a great film and hard to find a good small version. If you could redo it I'm sure it would be great for a lot of people as it is so good, but I appreciate that you do a lot so thanks anyway.

@ diego, PS3 won't support external subs, you'll have to find anoter way. I normally use ConvertXtoDVD and create a disc.

,in_silico,2010-01-11T07:42Z,"So happy with this one!  Nice movie, great quality download--not a long-term keeper due to watermarks and a little bit of choppiness at the end, but those issues were really minor and unobtrusive.  The best copy I've seen of this movie.  Well done."
,Anakunda,2010-01-23T20:43Z,"What codec do I need to play this movie?
I tried BS Player with ffdshow installed, got error message MP4filelibu.dll missing and no sound "

First movie from all my years at TPB that I could not show at all in any player. (VLC as standard.) Strange with thousands of seeders and leechers..
