BBC Life 01of10 Challenges of Life HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Episode1: Challenges of Life.
David Attenborough narrates a wildlife series. In nature, living long enough to breed is a monumental struggle, and many animals and plants go to extremes to give themselves a chance. Three brother cheetahs band together to bring down a huge ostrich, bottle-nosed dolphins trap fish in a ring of mud, the Strawberry frog carries a tadpole high into a tree and drops it in a water-filled bromeliad, and chinstrap penguins undertake a heroic and tragic journey through the broken ice to get out to sea.
