Caveat: This movie has been cropped to remove the Sweedish subtitles. For us English speaking folks it's much easier to watch and it fits our 16:9 wide-screens properly now. A bit of the text in a few places is cut off but still perfectly readable and the video quality is still excellent.

IMDb Rating: 6.3/10

Whatever You Do, Don't Buy Your Next Car Without Seeing This Movie!

If you think they're low-life scum when they're selling you a car... you should see them in their off hours!

Ever bought a used car from a dealer before? Want to know what REALLY happens behind the scenes? This movie offers some insight through the eyes of one of the dealers.

Shameless plug:
This is one of the few movies that Doctor Rich from the Love Doctors is always recommending. It's a radio talk show in South Florida, and unlike any show you've ever heard before. It's a caller driven show, so it's about whatever you want it to be about, that is until Rich tells you to shuffle off! Listen to it weekdays from 11am-3pm or the re-run at 1am-6am EST at wzzrcom or through iheartradio on your iPhone or Blackberry.

You won't be sorry you did!
