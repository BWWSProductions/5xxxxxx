The Geezer Butler Band was a solo band led by Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler, after leaving the band in 1984. The guitarist for his solo band was Peter "Pedro" Howse, who nowadays still remains a GZR (or G/Z/R, Geezer) member. This version of his band never released anything, although they performed some gigs in 1985 of which some bootlegs exist.
