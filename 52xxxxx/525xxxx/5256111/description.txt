[font=Verdana][b]Synopsis
[/b][/font]
Each episode takes place in a single dark room, with no camera cuts except for one lonely cut in episode six, at a ringing telephone. There's a rain track constantly playing, along with a regular low, moaning sounds that resembles a muted foghorn, and the camera loses focus whenever thunder cracks. The three rabbits - Jack, Jane and Suzie - enter, walk, sit, stand up and exit the room. Whenever one of the rabbits enters the room, an applause track is played. A laugh track is played, seemingly at random, since there are no jokes, although the laugh usually only plays when one of the rabbits refers to time. Action is scant, with the rabbits uttering their lines between pauses in disorder, so that there is no coherent flow of dialogue. There are several allusions to an unspecified "it". At one point, the rabbits take turns in reciting incoherent lines of poetry, starting with Jane and ending with Suzie, interrupted by sudden lapses of awareness that are quickly drowned by a burning hole in the background. To a similar effect, a diabolical mouth is shown twice in the show, reciting gibberish. In the very last episode, the steps that have been haunting the rabbits finally come to a stop, the door opens, and a hellish scream is heard. The rabbits cower in fear on the sofa, and Jane says "I wonder who I will be."
