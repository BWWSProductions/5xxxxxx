,milanevo7,2010-01-03T22:53Z,"Thx for a gr8 upload. 
I just wonder why the tracks are so short?"
[T],captim,2010-01-03T23:46Z,"@milanevo7: That's typical for the yearmix. Consider trance tracks often are long and in two hours you can only play like 20 tracks. That wouldn't be so funny if a yearmix would only consist of just a few tracks. I like the yearmixes, it's funny to have so many good tracks mixed together in this time.."
,brg2,2010-01-14T21:16Z,there's a slight hiccup at the beginning of each song. is that a gapless playback issue i can fix in itunes?
