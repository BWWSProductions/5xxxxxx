,sharina,2010-01-07T00:50Z,The sub file is awful it missed half of the dialogue and the syntax is just terrible.  This seems to be the same subs everyone else has as well.  
,evapilot,2010-01-07T20:14Z,agreed sharina.  the english-only audience would really appreciate functioning subs

,viktormikhail,2011-06-24T14:41Z,"Guys, if you are having a trouble with the subtitles, you can always download it at www.subscene.com

They're all free.

That's what I do whenever I can't find a good subtitle here."
