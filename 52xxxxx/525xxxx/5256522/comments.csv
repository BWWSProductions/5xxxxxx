,Harry Q Hammer,2010-01-18T01:09Z,"Hey joyceboxx,

Stop being such a whiny noob.

Learn a bit about your bittorrent client and the fact that it recalculates ETA every single second, and don't take it literally if it says ""24 weeks"" for a few seconds.

And don't keep posting multiple ""SEED SEED SEED"" begging comments!  It just broadcasts the fact that you are a total douche!  Learn some manners, not to mention basic internet etiquette.  Sheesh!"
,joyceboxx,2010-02-26T22:36Z,Who the hell are you to call me a douche??  Because I'm new at this???  You don't know me...I have no idea who you are and I'm not on here calling you names just for shits & giggles!!  I think you might want to look in the mirror buddy or at the very least get off your high  horse!!
