,m1m3,2010-01-01T18:52Z,"it works like charm! thnx, key will be blacklisted in a few days so do you know where i can search for new ones?"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-01-01T19:18Z,"@m1m3

lulz .... nothings been seeded yet and you already know that the key will be blacklisted in a few days .... 
Anyway, there are trial resetters for Avira AntiVir Premium and  Avira Premium Security Suite. Instead of looking for keys just use the trial resetter. (If the Avira trial resetters are not at TPB yet they might be posted later ...) "
[V],RobbingHood,2010-01-01T19:33Z,BTW: Happy 2010 to all pirates and the whole scene!!!
,m1m3,2010-01-01T19:44Z,"thnx RH, these keys are always blacklisted. Thnx for quick response! Wish you all best in 2010!!! "
[T],sanpork,2010-01-02T04:50Z,"Thanks Buddy !  Great up as always .
Happy New Year to You.."
,DahCaboose,2010-01-05T05:03Z,Sorry to pester you with such a question. But where can I find one of these trial-resets?
,buckoro,2010-01-06T02:03Z,"thank you robbinhood,your sound advice+support in all your ups.your a dan"
,Masazu,2010-01-07T12:12Z,"The key does not work, is here on TPB (or anyother torrent sites) working key?"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-01-08T00:51Z,"The key is working for me and other reliable users. Other reports about a not working key are considered to be lies, trolls, and other morons."
,Masazu,2010-01-08T11:57Z,Yes RobbinHood I do know that a key works well I'm not saying that your upload suck but after update it will go to demo version and it does not make any sense to not let your anti-virus get any updates. So I mean I'm looking for a key that works after updating too.
,DahCaboose,2010-01-08T16:01Z,"Thank-you for the upload RH, still working for me.

@Masazu:  RobbingHood's upload doesn't suck, these things work for some people, for others they don't. And you won't find a key that works for very long after updates.

This is about as good as it gets with Avira keys. "
[V],RobbingHood,2010-01-08T16:07Z,"@Masazu 

Updates are included. 

And in case of the error ""Scheduler not loaded"" when updating just run update.exe at (eg.): C:\Program Files\Avira\AntiVir Desktop\update.exe"
,smartvillan,2010-01-09T03:00Z,"thank u buddy , its working 4 me....... "

,T3KTRO,2010-01-28T16:49Z,"Worked like a charm until today...can you help us out?

,fu_manchu,2010-01-29T01:00Z,"was running for about 1 week and Today I checked the event viewer and bam

""The keyfile contains no valid license. The service will be stopped!""

So wheres the new key at because This shit is now in demo mode with no umbrella and you cannot start the service!"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-01-30T11:24Z,NOTE: I'm using this myself and they key is fine. Just IGNORE the trolls who say that the key is invalid.

,LayZeeDK,2010-01-31T22:18Z,"Key file works, but after updating to new version (you can't choose NOT to) the program is turned into a demo version :("
,Tyrranosaurus_Rex,2010-02-02T01:13Z,Key worked fine till the 28th after the program updated to .456 anyway to revert to old .455?
[V],RobbingHood,2010-02-02T18:27Z,"Since recently the key has been blacklisted:

""Know what you say, and say what you know"", so here you go:

To disable downloading product updates: Start Avira-> Configuration-> General-> Update
(also for disabling ""Notify if product updates are available"").

However, so far the Avira9_Trial_Reset_v2.2A works for all the latest program updates as well."
,fu_manchu,2010-02-03T18:53Z,robinhood you are a douche I will never download your crappy torrents n malware. Give credit to the originating group. Why use a trial reset? Im on version 10 beta and it rocks. Version 9 is so archaic compared to version 10
,fu_manchu,2010-02-03T19:09Z,"Oh, yeah! so now that your ""WORKING KEY"" doesnt work, you claim we are all liars. Now look at your hypocritical ass looks really stupid!. Youre the joke RobbingFOOD"
