,delic8bal,2010-01-03T06:58Z,"The numbers in front of the tracks are the play order.

001 (Jamrock) was listed at #100 and 100 (Crazy) was listed at #1. They are labelled this way so you go from:

100th best, 99th, 98th ... 3rd, 2nd, best

when played (at least that's the idea - hope it works for you)."
,ChezCote10,2010-01-03T08:21Z,"Nice download speed, thanks, look forward to blasting them out on my MP3 player :)

Merry New year"
,ChezCote10,2010-01-03T11:30Z,"Uh oh,hope it wasnt u who gave me Virus! Ifnot sorry but only have done 2 downloads and will check"
,delic8bal,2010-01-03T17:12Z,"Not me that gave you a virus. 100% Guaranteed. I run Eset 32 on my machine and the only files in the download are music files (MP3).

I'm sorry if you /do/ have a virus, but I assure you it has nothing what-so-ever to do with this download. Hope you enjoy the songs still!"
