This is a collection I put together of the tracks on Rolling Stone Magazine's 100 Best Singles of the 2000's (http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/31248926/100_best_songs_of_the_decade/27).

I'm not promising high quality, but all the tracks are there and good enough to listen to. I have properly labelled them all (track, artist, album).

I found some new tracks I liked and remembered some other great tracks I haven't listned to for a ages while making the compilation - maybe you will too if you download.
