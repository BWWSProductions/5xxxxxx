,miknos,2010-01-22T14:57Z,"I posted because the uploader of the other torrent wasn't uploading.

Use the search and you'll find 3 other torrents with plenty of seeders."
,Runesecret,2010-07-14T03:40Z,"Hey, I\'m new to this downloading business; nnWhen I\'m trying to open this file it says it does not know what application to use to open it? nnSo...which application do I use to open torrent files?"
,Lithiumn,2011-01-08T03:50Z,"If you're downloading with a mac you shouldn't have that problem man.  It's an app file.  You just double click it, unless of course you're downloading this with pc, in which case you should read the description of the torrent before downloading."

,Aaronizarions,2011-12-10T11:39Z,"Hey Runesecret to download the files all you need to do is follow these steps:
1. Download torrent from this or other torrent sites
2. download either bitlord or utorrent
3. open the downloaded torrent with whatever you downloaded in step 2.
4. wait until finished
5. when done find the file directory (either in the downloads file for utorrent or documents,bitlord for bitlord)"
