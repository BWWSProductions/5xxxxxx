,Twisky,2010-01-04T15:07Z,I'm trying to seed this out as fast as I possibly can but its not working. Usually my upload speed is ~500 kbps but yesterday I installed 'PeerBlock' and I think that might be messing it up . . .

Just to be clear, this torrent contains the re-rip of the CAMELOT groups torrent. They're torrent contained ~100 .RAR's in a two CD rip. This is that torrent but un-rared and with both videos joined into one.
