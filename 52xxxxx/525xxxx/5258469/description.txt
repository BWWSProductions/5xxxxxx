                    The Red Dahlia. Part 1.                  
                    First of a three-part crime drama. DC Anna  
                    Travis is reunited with the inimitable DCI  
                    James Langton to face her most challenging and  
                    terrifying case yet. When the body of a young  
                    woman is discovered by the Thames, sadistically  
                    mutilated, it seems to be a shocking     
                    re-enactment of the infamous Black Dahlia  
                    murder which occurred in 1940s Los Angeles.  
                    Then a journalist comes forward with cryptic  
                    clues allegedly sent from the killer, and  
                    Travis faces a tough test of judgement.
