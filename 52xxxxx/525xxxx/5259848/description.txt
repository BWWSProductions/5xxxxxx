This torrent contains files needed to install Debian on HTC Hero ( http://android.modaco.com/content/htc-hero-hero-modaco-com/292093/debian-lenny-now-running-on-hero/ ) AND a tutorial for that. Uploaded it here because of the fact that FileFactory are fucking retards.
31.03.2010 UPDATE:
Because most of you that installed deb realize that they need a bigger image to play with I've uploaded a 3,5 gig copy of the debian.img. Check out http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5473525
