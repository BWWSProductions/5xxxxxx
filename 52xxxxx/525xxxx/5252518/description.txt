Tool provided by microsoft. Use this to put windows 7 onto a disk, If you do not have a disk No problem. It burns to Flashdrives. Just put in a 4gb or higher and let Microsoft do the rest, Within minutes you will have a bootable flashdrive in which you can install Windows 7 onto your computer. Just install and go. That simple. Have fun. And remember to seed!
