Start with your description page:  Using his format with an IMDB link and other relevant information is the cue that we may find similar or better quality in the product itself.  

Lots of folks will be undiplomatic in criticizing (yes, I know :( ) if the fred label is used without delivering the goods elsewhere.  Good luck and encouragement, and we all look forward to your future uploads in the New Year."
