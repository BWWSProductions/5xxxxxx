BBC Life 02of10 Reptiles and Amphibians HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Episode2: Reptiles and Amphibians.
David Attenborough reveals how reptiles and amphibians conquer their shortcomings through amazing innovation. Extreme slow-motion shows how a Jesus Christ lizard runs on water, and how a chameleon fires an extendible tongue at its prey with unfailing accuracy. The camera dives on a Niuean sea snake, which avoids predators by swimming to an air bubble at the end of an underwater tunnel, and in a TV first, komodo dragons hunt a huge water-buffalo, stripping its carcass to bone in four hours.
