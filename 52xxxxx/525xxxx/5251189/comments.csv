I'm eager to check these out. 

I'd recommend stating the concept behind your playlist for these first few - just to establish yourself among some of our favourites: Joydue, dakradha, cut the crap, shankly, etc.

It seems to be most similar to ""Cut the Crap"" playlist, which is short, mostly indie, and composed not strictly with 'new' tracks (unless that Foo Fighters acoustic is a new track - because that's the only one that stood out to me as an old track)."

Onda Caliente used to be a shortwave pirate radio a few years ago, it is just to carry on with the spirit !"
