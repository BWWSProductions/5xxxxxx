BBC Life 07of10 Hunters and Hunted HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Episode 7. Hunters and Hunted.
The nature documentary explores mammals' ability to learn new survival tricks. In a TV first, a killer whale is shown sneaking into a pool where elephant seal pups learn to swim, saving itself the trouble of hunting in the open sea. Slow-motion cameras reveal how the star-nosed mole can smell prey underwater; young ibex run up an almost vertical cliff face to escape a fox; and young stoats fight mock battles, learning the skills that make them one of the world's most efficient predators.
