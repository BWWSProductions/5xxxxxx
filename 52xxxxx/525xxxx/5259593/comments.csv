Can u upload more from Muse ?"
,x1337x,2010-01-07T03:06Z,"Dude is this true 320 bitrate where you find this album I don't see where to buy the deluxe edition anywhere on the net, and couldn't find cover either."
[V],MeRaDil,2010-01-07T21:14Z,"@x1337x
I have this from a russian site.MediaInfo says that the bitrate is 320kbps constant."
,Muhammad1993,2010-01-07T21:23Z,"Please check out my iTunes rip of this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5266281
including PDF Digital Booklet"
,9v,2010-01-08T05:07Z,"lowpass cutoff @ 15000-16000, definite 128kbps transcode. sounds like even less on some tracks.

at least this copy has the right tracks to start with."
,3Brothers,2010-01-08T08:16Z,thanks for this HIGH QUALITY album....
,Rashad648,2010-01-23T17:10Z,How do u listen to this shit. Its a crap.
,Rashad648,2010-01-23T17:10Z,Fuck Kesha
,ColdNcursed,2010-01-25T08:22Z,"Thanks =) Great quality. And to the haters.. Why the hell do you look it up/check into it if you don't like the music? Seriously, why waste your time? "
,vladmir21,2010-01-25T11:45Z,"thanks, and now seeding! wheeee!!!"
,vladmir21,2010-01-25T12:05Z,i love her crazy energy!!!!!!!!
,The.Bad,2010-01-26T11:43Z,A few songs (eg. Party at a rich dude's house) didn't seem to be high quality. IMO some are even quieter than others. 
,j3illy,2010-01-31T09:05Z,"You can't buy this anywhere cuz it's not a legit release..  All it is, is the real album, along with the other ""bonus"" tracks that were part of the ""leaked"" release from December.. The bonus tracks were on there, but they were mislabeled, instead of songs they didn't have (Stephen, Hungover, Animal, etc...)  And just so you know, there's quite a few other Kesha songs out there that are just as good as the ones on here - I have 30 total."
,bridog80,2010-02-04T21:13Z,"Awesome!

,Jusbax,2010-02-13T12:52Z,WTF is this shit!!??!! Fuck you for uploading this swhit. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!
,arch11,2010-02-15T12:13Z,"Some tracks like for instance track 14 are in VERY low quality. Sounds like 64 kbps at best!

Clear example of high bitrate not equaling high quality."
,LateMan001,2010-02-28T23:10Z,Fuck Kesha 
,LateMan001,2010-02-28T23:35Z,P00P

,HiroPro2,2011-03-05T01:49Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -2 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR Fraunhofer RETARDS!!!"
,crazy_assasin,2011-03-14T16:20Z,"@hiro pro: dude, you're absolutely right about the vbr thing but i think that only stereo mode should be used but not the joint stereo one because if you are using some good quality listening aid with a bouncy left right song... that's helps a lottt...!!!"
,Andrew40,2011-04-05T03:57Z,"HiroPro2 advice is wrong.
CD's should be encoded with settings 44100@256/320 CBR Stereo.

VBR is used only for broadcasting or streaming. Joint Stereo is not true stereo and was only used for internet streaming back before broadband. using either or both of these settings decrease the audio quality.

There is nothing wrong with the iTunes encoder. It only had problems in version 1 and only for mac computers.

Also MP3 was dropped from the standards in 1995 for AAC. It is all there in the standards.  Fraunhoffer invented and own the mp3 rights."
,loveinthespace,2011-08-21T08:41Z,Thanks MeRaDil.  Nice torrent.
