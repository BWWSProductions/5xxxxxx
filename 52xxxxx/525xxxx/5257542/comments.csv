,ipha00,2010-01-05T11:16Z,"First I have to say that you should see this in the theaters first, 3D preferably.

This is the only TS I've found that was actually worth watching, defiantly one of the best I've seen. Audio quality is great, but it got out of sync a bit."

,velocitychaos,2010-01-05T23:46Z,CAM=i'm a bit new to this stuff but where does it say CAM in the description??
,WammerMammer,2010-01-06T17:04Z,"As always LTT delivers a beautiful copy. But I need to know Ltt_01 if you are German? Why do all the copies of Avatar have German or Russian or some other language than English?
Once again this once has Germs."
,cemmett,2010-01-08T00:20Z,"This is a fantastic copy of a fantastic film.
Do Not Hesitate to download this torrent, it's as near damn it as good as a dvd-rip.

Thank you and much respect to the man who made this one happen.  Nice one and keep up the good work."
,niko19,2010-01-08T01:38Z,"Only first 3 phrases are in german, everything else in english. good subs
Thanks for the upload!"
,Costiputza,2010-01-09T14:19Z,"Thanks for the upload, finally a real one, but the quality is not so great. 
V=6, A=6, but good enough to make an idea about this movie!"
,keepitlive,2010-01-18T19:21Z,"I have never been a TS guy, Id rather wait, but strangely enough couldn't wait for this release, and im SO Amazed that a TS can actually be in such a great Quality.... 

I warmly recommend to those who wont/cant wait for a proper rip, to DL this one. Great sound and picture. (For a TS ofc.)

,mcsegeek1,2010-01-19T04:39Z,"Not in English (at least the first several minutes of the film, which are important for story and context). Also, subs are not in english for the Navi language sections. A/7 V/6. "
,FlankerB1,2010-01-19T12:12Z,Why does it start with German audio?
,saaftware7,2010-01-20T22:16Z,"OMG best ts video ever ( its cam for newbies) but if you cant wait dl this atonce trust me awsome, thx so much Ltt_01.
A:7
V:9 (for a ts vid)."
,elegos,2010-01-21T12:24Z,"This release is very, very good. Little audio cutting (in the beginning (after the few minutes in German) and in the middle sometimes). For the rest: audio confirmed being LC, video is very, very good.

Subtitles: the English one is just superb but some Na'vi words, the Italian one is completely screwed up - going to create a proper one..."
,ValtieI,2010-01-27T18:19Z,"How do I apply the subtitles to the film?
there's a lot of different language files but idk what to do with them..."
,moehrd,2010-01-29T09:49Z,"v/9

Almost as a R5 LiNE. Very watchable."
