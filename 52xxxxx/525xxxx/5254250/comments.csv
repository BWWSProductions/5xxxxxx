Howard's stuff in ""These Immortal Souls"" (or solo) until I saw these live clips aired on Rage ... you can imagine how disappointed I was when I looked him up and discovered that he had just passed away days earlier.

Let's hope his unreleased & unavaliable stuff can live on, online, so everyone can enjoy it now and into the future."
,footyshorts,2010-01-06T07:37Z,"Hey bigbucket, I appreciate your comments.  As you know Rage's presentation is very sparse, so aside from the 'tribute' message at the start there was no indication as to why they were showing so much Birthday Party stuff.  With their airing of the complete ""Pleasure Heads"" video I'm sure some viewers must have thought Nick Cave had died.  This upload seems to have attracted quite a bit of attention, but I do wish people wouldn't be so selfish and would help seed once they've downloaded it.  Even to a ratio of 2 would be excellent.  I won't be seeding it forever - sooner or later it is up to the fans to take over or it will die."
