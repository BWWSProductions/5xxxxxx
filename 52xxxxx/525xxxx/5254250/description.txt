These three clips were aired on the ABC (Australia overnight music show "Rage" in tribute to Rowland S. Howard (of The Birthday Party fame) who died in Melbourne on December 30, 2009.

Boys Next Door (later The Birthday Party) - "Shivers", written by Howard (performance recorded for Channel 7 Melbourne rock show "Nightmoves")

These Immortal Souls - "Marry Me" (promo clip)

Rowland S. Howard - "Exit Everything"  (1999 performance on ABC show "The 10.30 Slot" - thankfully with Dylan Lewis' pathetic introduction edited off).

These are presented exactly as they were aired, in standard digital broadcast definition (DVD-compatible mpeg2). Please enjoy, whether in remembrance or discovering this music for the first time....

I have kept the clips separate so they can be downloaded individually or all at once.

And a special shout out to Mr Garfield who I suspect will be all over these, and is welcome back in Australia any time.
