There is very slight background noise on these recordings, which is to be expected on any vinyl rip. However, I prefer vinyl to CD because it sounds crisper. These rips were done directly from my USB turntable and covnerted directly to MP3 at 320 kb/s. No compression other than that. Project's sample frequency is 44100 hertz.
