,fredfan,2010-01-03T06:06Z,"Good one, thanks.  Weird I had so much trouble burning and getting to verify, though.  Fourth time was a charm, but likely my bizarre burner's fault, I guess."
[T],hjsn1,2010-01-04T05:47Z,"carouselboy: You're welcome. 

fredfan: You're welcome too. Do you really think it was your burner? I haven't heard of anyone else having trouble with it yet. I'll burn it too to see."
