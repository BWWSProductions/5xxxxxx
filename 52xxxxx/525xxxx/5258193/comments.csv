,idrone42,2010-01-14T08:04Z,"a movie can't suck harder than this. they park two armored vans inside an old run-down factory, and there it is. that's the movie. it must have cost FIVE DORRA to make. SUCKY SUCKY LOVE YOU LONG TIME "
,idrone42,2010-01-14T08:12Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD 

it's not a movie. it's a lump of feces dug out of the parasite-infested asshole of a rat in a landfill. also, a fat old hobo sick with hepatitis-b pissed on it. 

may whoever is responsible for this movie be locked in a sarcophagus of cement, after receiving XXL amounts of skullcracking facerape, torture and systematic mutilation. since i believe in fair treatment of people and animals, including subhuman moviemakers, i would still not force them to watch this movie. 

if you liked it, you should be summarily executed and incinerated for the benefit of mankind."
