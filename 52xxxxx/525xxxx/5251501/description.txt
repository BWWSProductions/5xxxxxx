Air Farce New Year's Eve 2009

The Farce is getting together again, for one night only on CBC Television - laughing out 2009 and laughing in 2010. And theyâ€™ll be in good company, with special guest appearances by Battle of the Blades champions, Olympic skater Jamie SalÃ© and hockey great Craig Simpson. While Battle turned a hockey player into a figure skater, the Farce plans to flip it up with â€œThe Luck of the Puck,â€ as SalÃ© faces Simpson in a shootout. Plus, the Farce will welcome the dragons of Dragonsâ€™ Denâ€”Arlene Dickinson, Robert Herjavec, Jim Treliving, Kevin Oâ€™Leary and W. Brett Wilsonâ€”who will turn in a high-stakes comedy performance, as the Farceâ€™s political characters pitch solutions for Canadaâ€™s economic crisis.
