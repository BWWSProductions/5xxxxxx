Ryden Malby had a plan. Do well in high school, thereby receiving a great college scholarship. Now that sheâ€™s finally graduated, itâ€™s time for her to find a gorgeous loft apartment and land her dream job at the cityâ€™s best publishing house. But when Jessica Bard, Rydenâ€™s college nemesis steals her perfect job, Ryden is forced to move back to her childhood home. Stuck with her eccentric family â€“ a stubborn do-it-yourself dad, an overly thrifty mom, a politically incorrect grandma, a very odd little brother â€“ and a growing stack of rejected job applications, Ryden starts to feel like sheâ€™s going nowhere. The only upside is spending time with her best friend, Adam â€“ and running into her hot next-door neighbor, David. But if Rydenâ€™s going to survive life as a post grad, it may be time to come up with a new planâ€¦
