Please tell Bob that his gap settings in EAC is undefined and therefore the CUE sheet is bad. - In EAC, load a CD, hit F4 to detect gaps, in the menu select Action, make sure to tick ""Append Gaps To Previous Track (default)"".

Copy/paste the following to create a proper CUE sheet. It is burn-tested against AccurateRip.
