,jstang73,2010-01-01T22:46Z,"To all who have downloaded, please comment. Did this torrent upload right? Was the speed acceptable? Thanks jstang73"
,krillsson,2010-01-01T23:06Z,FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE
,jstang73,2010-01-01T23:33Z,"krillson this is not fake. Did you even bother to download it? If so and there is a problem with the torrent , please let me know."
,Ghost.,2010-01-02T05:16Z,"i'm going to try to download this one, if you look on this website there should be one called Avatar movie 2009 or something along those lines, it's about 1.5 gb i believe and it's also very good, the best i've seen so far.
there are MANY MANY others out there that have the movie.... but when you try to play it, it redirects you to a webpage asking if you want a ""media player that will play the .avi file""
i'm no idiot i know VLC can play .avi so beware people.
oh and jstang, thanks for the upload! really appreciate it, i'll seed as much as possible once i'm done downloading it =)"

,abidady,2010-01-02T16:35Z,"I did download the simple, so: A: 5.5 V: 5 (watchable but Not up to the required)"
,Beccaz,2010-01-02T16:59Z,"Best copy out there!
you rule.. : )"
,jstang73,2010-01-02T17:27Z,"Hmmm. .. doesn't the title say T.S. ? So the source is a cam. Also it's in sync on my playbacks, It's also much clearer than the 480p on my widescreen. I never claimed this to be a dvd rip, just the best copy I've found so far."
,Slaterboy,2010-01-02T18:01Z,ok i'm downloading it...10 hour left... if its good you get a good comment. if its bad... ill let everyone know then ill find where you live and i will masacre you! rape your dog and kill your mum!.... oh wait oppps
,jstang73,2010-01-02T18:26Z,"Is this really that slow . . . 10 hours? I've been seeding at my full bandwith. According to my client there are 536 seeds out there, come on people give something back and seed, please."
,jstang73,2010-01-02T22:36Z,"horny_247 , klp56 ,Beccaz , thank you , hope you enjoy the movie. whosthepussydad ; I've downloaded more than 20 copies of Avatar and the 2 I've posted are the best out there. If they're not good enough for you, go pay to see the movie. abidady ; you downloaded the simple? Well simple is as simple does. The sample is from the original cam.  The movie I uploaded is better. Finally iki24 and Ghjab25, give it up , nobody wants to go to your spam sites and pay for what is free and clean of spam and viruses, unlike what is available on the torrent sites."
,ilstxfe,2010-01-04T07:12Z,why I cannot download the torrent?!
,WammerMammer,2010-01-06T17:14Z,"Hey jstang73 how many times are you going to upload the same movie under different names and every one says gee I hope I did it right. It's my first upload. You're so full of shit.
Here is your other upload under Devise's name.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5251186/Avatar.TS.XVID-Devise_%28720p_Eng._Subs%29
What is wrong with you? Are you a freak or something. Liar!!"
,jstang73,2010-01-07T03:04Z,"WammerMammer . . . they are not the same upload, they are two different files, one is Devise with hard coded subs and the other is Vision with added subs, I uploaded them both at the same time. So kiss my behind if you want to call me a liar."
,ChaosTheorie,2010-01-07T16:08Z,Thank you. Nice work and good quality untill now :)
,jayrenz,2010-01-07T21:34Z,"jstang73, awesome quality, my only concern however; the copy I downloaded, the movie stops at about 2:21:26 which is still in the midst of the final fight. Was is it made that way, or did I just not get all of the file? My bittorrent says the download was complete. Thanks again, it's nice to watch the movie again haha"
,jstang73,2010-01-07T22:18Z,"jayrenz . . . the movie runs 2:34:31, if you're missing parts I don't know what happened. Sorry."
,call_me_nobody,2010-02-01T00:40Z,"JUST TO SAY IT

THIS VIDEO IS NOT FAKE

IT IS IN A GOOD 720P QUALITY

THE SOUND IS SAME AS THE PROPER VERSION

BUT! 

AT 1H 18 MINUTES THE SOUND IS FUCKED UP THE SOUND SOME KIND TAKES A BREAK AND KONTINUES AT 1.18.12
