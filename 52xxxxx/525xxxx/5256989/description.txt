Bonus CD


Two sessions here. First is the 18th December 1970 (mis-dated as 8th December on inserts) recording from Keith Richards' 27th birthday party thrown by his mates at Olympic Sound Studios in London. Eric played slide on "Brown Sugar" and serious consideration was given to releasing that version or stripping EC's slide off and mixing it with another version, but nothing ever happened. The second is two alternate takes of Carnival To Rio from June 1975, with Mick, Keef, Ronnie Wood, Bill Wyman, and Charlie Watts guesting. Also considered for release but too many contractual and legal issues to sort out. With the entire Rolling Stones band on the song, who gets lead billing, etc, etc (the Stones didn't care but you better believe their manager and recording label did).
