You should've read ""how do I download"" on the front page of the pirate bay.

Anyway, a torrent isn't a normal download, you get the file from other people. What you need to do is load the .torrent file in a bittorrent program like Âľtorrent (www.utorrent.com) and then it will download the movie. I recommend utorrent as I never had any trouble with it and it is very small, but you can choose another program if you like.

Hope I helped."
