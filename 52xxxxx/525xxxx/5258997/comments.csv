,yinzer,2010-01-05T12:53Z,many thanks 2040 - can you do The League?
,boom777,2010-01-05T15:18Z,"
I'm confused. Aren't these supposed to be episodes 12 & 13?
Or am I wrong?"

It looks fine to me.

@yinzer: ""The League"" WAS in my Schedule on name-not-to-be-spoken for a month. Interest was so incredibly low, that T.L - like many other shows - pushed themselves out - for good.
I see no point in spending time, resources and money for maybe dozen people who even  haven't bothered to say plain ""Thanks"".
However, I've found episodes I have ( 1st is double, that 2-4) and I'll re-up these as ""1-4 package"" few hours from now."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-05T17:23Z,"Sorry, 1st one is not double-lenght, just longer than other ones and longer than ""standard"".

@sanyam: Thank you."
,boom777,2010-01-05T17:36Z,"Okay, thanks for clearing that up.
I got confused from reading the Wikipedia page for the episode list.
Keep uploading! It is appreciated!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-05T18:59Z,"Torrent for ""The League"" 1-4 was up for two hours, but seems like nobody have interest. Well, I knew it - and have deleted that torrent right now."
