BBC Life 08of10 Creatures of the Deep HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Episode 8. Creatures of the Deep.
The nature documentary series takes a look at marine invertebrates, some of the most bizarre and beautiful animals on the planet. Divers swim into a shoal of predatory Humboldt squid as the creatures emerge from the depths to hunt in packs. Time-lapse photography reveals thousands of starfish gathering under the Arctic ice to devour a seal carcass. And a giant octopus commits suicide for her young: a camera follows her into a cave which she walls up, then she protects her eggs until she starves.
