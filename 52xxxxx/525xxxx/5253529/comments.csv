,ajones81,2010-01-03T19:47Z,"This is simply fantastic, thanks! :D

BTW, I see you have a bunch of Blueberry in there. My numbering is slightly different, but do you happen to have ""Blueberry 12 - The Ghost with the Golden Bullets"" by any chance?

Any other English translations of Blueberry would also be highly appreciated. :)"
,notenough,2010-01-06T04:01Z,"Any chance you could finish seeding ""The Phantom Stranger""? There are over a dozen people stuck at 99.3% with no seeds.

@ ajones81 - I might upload Blueberry after I finished with the Batman mini-series collection.  The numbering is different as Epic didn't ptint them in order.

@ notenough - I'm reseeding the Phantom Stranger, but can people that donwload torrents please stay on and seed it for others."
