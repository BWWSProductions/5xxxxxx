Epic Comics was a creator-owned imprint of Marvel Comics started in 1982, lasting through the mid-1990s, and being briefly revived on a small scale in the mid-2000s.

The Epic Graphic Novels were produced between 1987-1994, and were mostly dominated by Moebius but also featured creators ranging from Sergio Aragones at the beginning to James Robinson at the end.  Though originally unnumbered, the novels are listed in chronological order by Bob Rozakis in his Definitive Graphic Novels List at comicsbulletin.com, but it is not definitive as neither William Gibson's Neuromancer, adapted by Tom de Haven and Bruce Jensen (also published as Marvel Graphic Novel 52) and Alfred Bester's The Stars, My Destination, adapted by Bryon Preiss and Howard Chaykin are included.  I have included them in this pack.  This pack includes:
