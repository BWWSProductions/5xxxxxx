Note:
1. You have to be jailbroken.
2. You have to have AppSync installed via Cydia"

,justinxtreme,2010-03-13T05:44Z,works fine..... no offense but don't see any differences between v1.0 and v1.2..... only a little speed improvements but overall still feels the same.... just less cluttered (the whole music playing and stuff)
