*** Small-sized 2-pass re-encode of Hannibal's XviD for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox, portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) . ***
*** Video is 480x272 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***

I can recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.
VLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.
One can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.
QuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.
PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.
And please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.

USE TORRENT-SEARCH SITES, TorrentBar extension for FireFox OR EVEN GOOGLE: show-name H264
(for example GOSSIP GIRL H264).

Episode Summary
	 
One of the guests chokes to death on a cocktail when Poirot a dinner party at Sir Charles Cartwright's house. Poirot is left baffled when there seems no motive for the murder and there are no traces of poison. When another guest dies at a similar party a few weeks later which the same guests are attending there seems to be more evidence this time.
