The movie begins with Ty (Columbus Short), the main character, going to work like any other day. They travel to a bank and pick up something that needs to be moved.

Once they exit the bank with the money, Baines (Laurence Fishburne) signals for them to wait. He says a black van has circled their truck twice, and to be on the look out. They load up and move out. However, while traveling along a back road, their truck stalls. Baines tries to start the truck, but canâ€™t. The truck has been sabotaged by someone putting sugar in the gas tank.

They try to radio for help, but canâ€™t, they are in a radio dead zone. Just then, the black van speeds up behind the truck and four men in gas masks jump out and stick a bomb to the back window. Ty tries to get away, but is stuck next to the bomb. The bomb goes off, andâ€¦ launches a bottle rocket into the truck. It was all a prank being played on Ty. They all laugh it off and drive back, saying it was a prank.
