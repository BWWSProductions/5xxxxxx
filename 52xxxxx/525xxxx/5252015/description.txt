Final Fantasy Tactics for the original PlayStation (PSX) - one of my absolute favorites from the past and even if the gameplay is severely different from the traditional Final Fantasy games, it is commonly considered to be one of the absolutely best ones in the series. Here is a clean copy of it in standard CUE/BIN format. If you have not thought about modding the game after download, I recommend that you check out http://www.ffhacktics.com for information about this (I have personally nothing to do with the various ffhacktics modding projects, I just promote it). Basically, what it will do is make the game more balanced and a bit harder for it to be more fun to play. However, nothing is needed to be done to be able to play the game (except for the fact that you either need a chipped PlayStation or an emulator, but I think that is pretty obvious).

Direct link to the FFT 1.3 Easytype mod (easier than 1.3, harder than unmodded, good for non-hardcore players):

Installation instructions can be found there as well.

Once again, this is a clean copy of the game. I just posted the information about the mod to shine some light on it.

The game is great. Enjoy!
