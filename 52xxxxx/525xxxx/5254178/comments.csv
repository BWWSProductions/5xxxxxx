,Gololo,2010-01-05T23:18Z,What's wrong with this torrent? Why is everybody stuck at 82.9%? O_o!?
,diftl,2010-01-05T23:27Z,Not sure why it's stuck. It's a valid torrent; I'll re-seed/re-start it.
,Gololo,2010-01-05T23:55Z,"ok, thx! :D"
,mjbmjbmjb,2010-02-24T07:27Z,does anyone know if this torrent has been completely downloaded and is functional?
,dearleuk,2010-04-05T20:03Z,"Looking forward to this, thank you"
,chioneskeeper,2010-10-09T05:45Z,98.24% can someone seed for just a bit longer so I can finish?  
,st0neat,2011-01-12T07:38Z,"hey, if anyone doesn't mind, I'd appreciate if you could seed for a little while; I'll keep it going for months if you do."
,st0neat,2011-01-12T08:20Z,"hey, don't know if it's a coincidence, put to the two people who started seeding it I really appreciate it!"
,jonja,2011-02-05T04:50Z,Please seed
