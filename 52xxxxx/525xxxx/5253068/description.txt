Game description:
It might be another long while until Slightly Mad Studiosâ€™ Ferrari Project is out, you donâ€™t have to wait that long to drive your favorite prancing horse road car though - Thanks to Ferrari Virtual Race.
The official Ferrari racing game lets you drive the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano, the Ferrari 612 Scaglietti and Ferrari 430 at Mugello, one of the companyâ€™s trademark tracks. The game is not supposed to be a real simulation but more of a driving game, if you enjoy Ferraris and titles like GRID or Gran Turismo itâ€™s worth to be checked out for sure.
The current version of the game is single player only, an online-version as well as new cars like the Ferrari California are already in the pipeline.
