Partily the sound is extremly excellent - in the more quit parts -  than you get this overmodulated sound as if the tapes have gone bad or something.

I can not enjoy this record at all.

(I collect MFSL / DCC FLACs and my tubeamp sounds usually quite nice - not every thing is a Steve Hoffman artwork which is released on a gold CD)

It seems that my audio system has got a nasty resonant frequency and WYWH just just the right spot."
