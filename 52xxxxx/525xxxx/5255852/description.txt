The Kids from "Fame" was the group name of several cast members from the TV series Fame who had a number of hit singles and albums at the height of the show's success in the UK. This success culminated in tours of the UK where they performed live in concert. A live album was subsequently released.

The group came to prominence in the summer of 1982 when the series first aired in the UK and a single "Hi Fidelity" reached No.5.[3] Along with this an album was released: The Kids from "Fame", which reached No.1 for 12 weeks.[4][5] A series of singles and albums followed over the next 12 months with songs taken from the show's first three seasons.[6] By the summer of 1983, interest in the show was beginning to wane and the releases abruptly stopped, although the TV series carried on for a number of years.
The main vocalists of the group were Debbie Allen, Valerie Landsburg, Erica Gimpel, Carlo Imperato, Gene Anthony Ray, Lee Curreri, Lori Singer and P.R. Paul.
