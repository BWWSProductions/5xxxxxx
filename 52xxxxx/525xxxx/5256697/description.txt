The Glow of White Women, an autobiographical documentary film made by Yunus Valley, tells a personal story of growing up amidst the extreme segregation of Nelspruit, South Africa, which effected societal perceptions of beauty. Yunus was raised Muslim, in an area that declared "whiteness" the ultimate form of beauty. ;; Witness the contrast of Yunus's journey into adulthood, filled with sexual revolution, Trotskyism, and a culture coming of age, where past and present meet through a prism of modern racism.
