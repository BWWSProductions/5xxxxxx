,Ziphius,2010-01-17T01:48Z,"Anyone got this to work? Im sent back to main menu as Im about to start either single or multiplayer...
(softmodded wii, tried with both neogamma and uloader)"
,bookimam,2010-01-18T22:33Z,thank u does it works?
,xx21playerxx,2010-02-03T18:13Z,"Yes. This works Great!! Thanks Ecabuk!! keep up the good work. Also For those who cant get it to work.. Install cIOS38_rev17(google it) and use any version of Neogamma set alt.dol to disc, force NTSC480i and use main dol to launch the game so you can create a save file using your Mii(keep in mind you will not be able to launch any of the games here). Then restart your Wii use your Neogamma(any Version) and select individual disc.dol for the respective game you want to play.
Good luck!! and CHEERS for this new uploader."
,wiirex04,2010-02-06T22:03Z,Still not working on USB loader GX. This is the only game that has not worked for me and I have around 50 games. Everything works until you select what game you want to play and after about 3 seconds of loading screen turns green and quickly diverts back to wii main menu.
,Destoroyah,2010-05-13T17:09Z,"i guess ill have to buy this one and okami, those are so far the only games not working. at least not as softmod, burning MIGHT work, but i never got a proper burn"
,krad21,2010-05-17T09:40Z,"Thanks for the UP ecabuk, seems to work perfect after 10min on each game from the regular disc loader.
Btw this is what i got loaded:
Wii NTSC v4.1u, wiikey v1, startpatch regionfree enabled, updates disabled. Installed CIOS: 250, 249, 222, 202, 36-30, 21.
Hope this helps someone. The only games i HAVE to use neogamma are newsupermariobros, all other mario titles work fine for me even Okami (Destoroyah.)"
