,AGSB,2010-01-03T16:00Z,"Same here, tells me I am missing a .dll file."
,degravedi,2010-01-03T17:27Z,"The error ""This application has failed to start because d3dx9_37.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."" usually means your DirectX is not up to date/is corrupted, or your machine doesn't have the specifications required to play the game. Try the suggestions here: http://pcsupport.about.com/od/findbyerrormessage/a/d3dx9_37dll-dll.htm

The game works great for me. Thanks again Wendy!"
