       All of the Cars Toons follow the same tall tale formula: Mater tells a story of     
       something he has done in the past. In the story, Mater finds himself in an          
       inescapable predicament. When McQueen questions Mater over whether the events in    
       the story actually occurred, Mater responds, "Don't you remember? You was there     
       too!", and continues the story including McQueen's sudden participation. The        
       cartoons end with Mater leaving the scene, often followed by characters or          
       references to the story that was being told, putting up a possibility that the      
       story might be real. Each story includes Mater, Lightning McQueen, Mia and Tia      
       (the two red cars that adore Lightning McQueen), and various pit crew cars.
