"The Invasion of Gaza" with Michel Chossudovsky discussing Israel's broader military-intelligence plan, "Operation Justified Vengeance" (Ariel Sharon 2001) of which "Operation Cast Lead" is part; the assassination of Yaser Arafat; the humanitarian crisis; strategic gas reserves offshore from Gaza; and Israel's energy transport corridor along the coast of the eastern Mediterranean.  Encore broadcast to mark the one-year anniversary of the attack on the Gaza strip.





================================================

"Guns & Butter" investigates the relationships among capitalism, militarism and politics. Maintaining a radical perspective in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, "Guns & Butter: The Economics of Politics" reports on who wins and who loses when the economic resources of civil society are diverted toward global corporatization, war, and the furtherance of a national security state.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
