~~~~~~~~ SYNOPSIS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Miami narcotics detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett become part of a high-tech task force assigned to stem the flood of designer ecstasy into Miami. They unwittingly uncover a deadly conspiracy involving a ruthless drug lord who is determined to expand his empire and take control of the cityâ€™s burgeoning narcotics trade, killing anyone who stands in his way. To make matters worse, Marcusâ€™ beautiful sister Syd, an undercover DEA agent, gets caught in the crossfire, forcing our heroes to the edge of the law. The assignment takes on further complications when romantic sparks start to fly between Mike and Syd, driving her overly protective brother completely around the bend. But Marcus and Mike must overcome their differences to bring down Tapia. And when Sydâ€™s cover is jeopardized, itâ€™s up to the Bad Boys to rescue her.
