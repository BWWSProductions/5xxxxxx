,gggs,2010-05-07T02:57Z,"Steps for installation

#1 read the fucking instructions posted in the description, if you're still clueless go to #2.

#2 navigate to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc and open the hosts file with notepad.
Add the listed entries from step #1 in the torrent description to the host file. Save (you must open as administrator)

#3 Download and install a virtual drive app:
Virtual clone drive (best) or Deamon tools

#4 Mount disk 1 to your virtual drive and run setup and use a valid serial (find one if you don't have one)

#5 When prompted for next disk, mount the disk in the virtual drive."
