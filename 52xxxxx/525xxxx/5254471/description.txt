SO consolidated Gabriel's reputation as an original and exciting composer, capable of projecting sophisticated lyrics on accessible melodies. 'Sledgehammer' was a massive hit (number one in the USA), as was 'Don't Give Up', with Kate Bush's vocals adding extra pathos. 'This Is The Picture' clearly shows the slightly surreal influence of co-writer Laurie Anderson, and the whole is given flight by Daniel Lanois' impeccable production. The towering achievement, however, is 'Mercy Street', a sparely orchestrated and perfectly constructed tribute to the late poet Anne Sexton. All tracks have been digitally remastered. Recorded at Ascombe Studios, Bath, England between Feruary and December, 1985. Recorded at Ascombe Studios, Bath, England between Feruary & December 1985.
