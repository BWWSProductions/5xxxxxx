What would you say to an evening of partying with music, song and above all, lots of fun, leaving you shaking with laughter? This DVD won't just have you in party mood on New Year's Eve; it could be party night every night! This scintillating New Year's Eve concert was recorded in December 2003 in Hanover, Germany, with AndrÃ© Rieu and his orchestra accompanied by special guests such as Otto Waalkes and BOND, showing what partying should be all about! It's really AndrÃ© at his best!
