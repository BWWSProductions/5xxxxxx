,MerlinBiggs,2010-03-30T16:17Z,Why does some fucktard always have to put the movie in rars.  It's pointless
,mindtpi,2010-04-23T07:43Z,"MerlinBiggs - if you are too lazy to spend less than a minute unraring it, just don't download it moron. Seriously, who cares if it's rar'd. Thanks to TvTeam for the upload"
,MerlinBiggs,2010-04-23T17:23Z,It's still pointless. Seriously - why do it?
