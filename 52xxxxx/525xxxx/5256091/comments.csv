I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

Would it be safe to think Warren Haynes will be doing shows from Belly Up, Aspen in 2010?  I live a million miles from that town, but the 2008 shows you put on TPB were excellent.  Thanks for the new bout of music you are doing."
