,mudvayne1993,2010-01-06T17:03Z,is it possible that this files have a strange format? if I wanna watch this in fullscreen there is still a black line around the screen so its not really full screen. but its still better quality than normal tvrips
,sbas87_,2010-01-06T17:41Z,"Yes, that would be because its 4:3.
It gets strange if the video is 16:9 but the actual data is just 4:3 (the last 4 episodes of this season), in that case you will most likely get those weird bars yes)."
