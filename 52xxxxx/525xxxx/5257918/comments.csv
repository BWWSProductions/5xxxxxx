,Gekkie11,2010-11-25T22:22Z,"First time I installed the game would get stuck at loading the first area. Second time it worked, however I am now finding I can't 'activate' a new destination on the map in the game. So that's too annoying to ignore so I threw this game off my pc."

,iRekognize,2011-10-30T23:09Z,"I just installed the game and I experienced the same problems you some of you guys have been having. I accidentally found a strange solution: while the loading screen ""freezes"", press alt+tab to get out to OS and then alt+tab again to get back into the game. The loader proceeds a little bit. Do this several times and eventually the loading screen will be complete and the intro will start. Weird I know, but it worked for me. :D"
