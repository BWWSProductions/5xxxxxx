Installing Windows 7 From USB Drive 3 Steps Easy Process

There are guides on how to prepare your USB drive so you can put all the Windows 7 files on it, then boot from your USB drive and install Windows 7, but they are all lengthy and require a bunch of commands.

The Easy Process:

Note: Make sure your motherboard is capable of booting off a USB drive or this will not work. Also, backup any files on your USB drive because it will be formatted.


1) Download the free UltraISO trial here
Code:

With UltraISO:

- Choose your USB stick under ""Disk Drive""
- Choose a method (It's recommended to use USB-HDD+)
- Press Write
- Make sure to change your BOOT order in BIOS to boot from your USB drive first.

Hope This sorts out all these problems regarding size of the image."
