,StuShipp,2010-01-09T16:06Z,"PowerPC 1.25GHz OSX 10.5.8 - it didn't seem to work for me.  It loaded after doing the chmod +x hack through terminal, but the graphics were all distorted.  It probably isn't anything to do with the program, but the lack of graphics power of the Mac.  Just wanted to be helpful in case anyone of the same Mac type were interested in this torrent.  Thanks for the upload though.

Rock on"

,Lithiumn,2011-01-08T03:59Z,"HERES HOW TO MAKE IT WORK SIMPLY. 
OPEN TERMINAL.  TYPE ""chmod +x"" AND THEN DRAG AND DROP THE RUBBER NINJAS FILE LOCATED INSIDE OF THE .APP/CONTENTS/MACOS AND IT WILL AUTO INPUT THE CORRECT LOCATION.  "
,cuda10358,2011-01-16T19:54Z,"I did the thing in terminal. the only thing that came up was usage:	chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-a | +a | =a  [i][# [ n]]] mode|entry file ...
	chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-E | -C | -i | -I] file ...
