Rubber Ninjas is an experimental 3D ragdoll fighting game by Matteo Guarnieri of Rag Doll Software. It is currently available for Mac OS X (10.4 or later) and Windows (XP, Vista, 7).

The game features ragdolls of many sizes and shapes, fighting bare handed or with a variety of different weapons. Thanks to the innovative gameplay based on Matteo's own Ragdoll Masters, players will never fight the same fight twice, and all moves will be different and spectacular.

Rubber Ninjas uses smooth OpenGL graphics, a custom ragdoll physics engine and cinematic camera techniques to provide an immersive and thrilling fighting experience.
