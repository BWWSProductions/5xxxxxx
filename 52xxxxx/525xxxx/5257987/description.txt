ABOUT THE MOVIE

Directed by Rajkumar Hirani the flick opens with Farhan(R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) beginning a journey in search of their lost friend Ranchoddas Shaymaldas Chajaad (Aamir Khan) who leaves college all of sudden.

The movie proceeds through narrations that take you into the flashback when Rancho, Farhan and Raju arrive at a premier engineering institute to begin their course.

The three are roommates and go about their life at college in a lively way occasionally Raju and Farhan being worried about Ranchoâ€™s antiques.

The so called â€œvillainâ€ of the flick whose ways are against that of Rancho is the Dean of the college Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani). In addition, to make matters worse Rancho happens to find love in his daughter Pia (Kareena Kapoor).

The movie has some really hilarious moments with wedding reception mayhem of Viruâ€™s oldest daughter played by Mona Singh, Rajuâ€™s father being reached to the hospital in a very funny way on a two-wheeler and so on.

The first half keeps you at wits end. But, enter second half and you are no longer given the same experience of the first half. The end stretches a bit too long and some things are just too away from spontaneity.

The music is light and entertaining. On the whole a decent flick. Only time will tell if it joins the ranks of Aamir Khanâ€™s other blockbuster movies.

3 Idiots works and how! With a good grip on emotions and entertainment, 3 Idiots is the biggest hit of 2009 for sure. Take it from me.
