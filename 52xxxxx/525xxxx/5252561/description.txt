All Windows XP x64bit drivers for the V1V notebook from ASUS updated January 2010.
 
You can include then in your Windows XP x64bit install CD so it installs them automatically or if you already have Windows installed you can use a driver backup/restore program like Double Driver, or of course you can install them manually, which I do not recommend, being way to time consuming.

       This is actually a backup of all my drivers, checked them with Driveragent as being all up to date, with the exception of the webcam, which works perfectly but is the only one that appears outdated at Driveragent.
       This pack contains also some drivers you might not necessarily need, like the Canon MF scanner/printer drivers. The only thing that I couldn't make to work as I like is the Fingerprint reader. Drivers are good and up to date, but can't find a useful 3rd party security app for it.

Archived with RAR, zip version was more than 2x bigger, so...RAR it is. Enjoy!

I am also seeding the free Double Driver app for easy installation of these drivers.
