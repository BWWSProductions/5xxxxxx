,stevenkain,2010-01-02T15:02Z,"""jessup"", my dear, these are the x64bit drivers for WinXP, and ASUS does NOT offer support for this OS on their site, or anywhere else for the V1V notebook, just plain XP 32bit and Vista.

Please do your research more carefully before you comment. Now you just look stupid.

I actually had to search and test a lot of drivers on the web until I got everything working perfectly. Driveragent was a big help, and the notebook works better and faster now with WinXP x64bit than any other OS, being built on the WinNT kernel rather than the Win95 that all others have (XP, Vista, 7).  It is also taking full advantage of the 4GB memory.

Hope it will save people a lot of time, money and frustration. It took less than a minute since I uploaded the torrent until somebody started downloading, so I guess it helped at least one person."
