 This documentary recounts the famous World War II battle of El Alamein,
 considered one of the key turning points in the war against the Nazis.
 The film uses actual footage taken during the battle, including film

 execution. It also pays tribute to the men and women on the home front
 who, in their work in the factories and in their lives in general,
 made victory possible.

 relieve source of ghosting. All said, we think it came out pretty nice!
