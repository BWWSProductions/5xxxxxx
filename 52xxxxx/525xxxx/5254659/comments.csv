amazon uk...review

Some reviews here, list the collection as containing 27 episodes. This is incorrect. The US version does contain the 27 episodes mentioned (with a run time of 618 minutes). This UK version, contains only 20 episodes (with a run time of 460 minutes). I was quite disappointed when I received this, as I thought it was the same as the US release (with 27 episodes). The US version, which looks identical to this, is titled ""Volume 1 - Episodes 1-27"". This UK version is entitled ""First Collection"". Both sets contain 3 discs, however, as mentioned, The UK version does not have the same amount of episodes. "
