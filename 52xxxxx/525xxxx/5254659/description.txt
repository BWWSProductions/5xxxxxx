The world's wealthiest duck brings his high-flying escapades home to DVD with DuckTales. Scrooge McDuck has a nose for business that leads him to the far corners of the world, but even this tycoon has his hands full when nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie join the fun. Joined by their loyal pals Launchpad McQuack, Gyro Gearloose, Mrs. Beakley and Webby Vanderquack, the DuckTales gang never fails to deliver a wealth of adventure.

Whether searching for the Fountain of Youth, traveling back in time to the days of King Arthur's Round Table or being accidentally launched into outer space - you can always bank on Scrooge and the boys to keep the thrills coming.

Get ready for a fortune of fun with some of the most memorable DuckTales episodes ever on 3 discs. It's a feather-raising quack-up that you and your family will treasure.
