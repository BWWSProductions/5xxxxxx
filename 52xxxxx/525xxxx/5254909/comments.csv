,Shadow_Jedi,2010-01-03T12:01Z,Hmm...Over 400 uploaders and no comments? I'll trust the uploader with the green skull and comment about the quality of the upload and if its legit or not. Hope so!
,Shadow_Jedi,2010-01-03T12:23Z,"@ FELLOW PIRATES: Can someone please help get this seeded? It seems as though everyone gobbled this torrent up and now it's dead, in regards to uploading it. I will help seed if I can get this downloaded but this is taking forever! Also, there has still been no comments if this torrent is actually a good download..."
,mattwjones,2010-01-03T12:27Z,It looks like there are almost 4 working seeds now. PLease let us know if the d/l is legit.
,sushanth_bhat,2010-01-03T14:57Z,What are you talking about 4 working seed. Now there is only one. Please people seed.
,keithh85,2010-01-03T16:26Z,Real and quick DL. Took maybe 1.5 hours. THANKS to uploader!
,awlh,2010-01-03T18:51Z,Awesome! 10/10
,sushanth_bhat,2010-01-04T07:21Z,Sorry for late reply. 10/10. Real deal. Enjoy the fights :)
,Shadow_Jedi,2010-01-04T20:29Z,"@ Jesper.sv: Thanks a lot for the great upload! Wow, that was an amazing card with great up and coming fighters that I haven't heard much of. The UFC has evolved into a really technical sport and this card truly is a testament to that. The co-main even was awesome but the 'main' event was incredible! Sugar looked fluid like water and Silva is a beast. I was expecting one of them to throw a fireball from their palms at any moment. Now I have to wait until March for the Shogun/Machida rematch... what a match-up that will be. Keep up the great UFC torrents because everyone should be able to watch the modern clash of the titans. Long live the UFC!  "
