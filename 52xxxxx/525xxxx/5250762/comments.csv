,29385729-Unknown,2010-05-29T05:56Z,"*** Works 100% ***

By the looks of it, it looks like someone used Alcohol 120% to Rip the Game.  Good Work.

Follow the Instructions...

1. Use PowerISO, MagicISO, Alcohol 120%, or Dameon Tools, to Virutually Mount CD1, then when asked, Mount CD2.

2. When you have CD2 Virtually Mounted, Explore the CD, and look for a folder called DEViANCE, Copy and Paste the Original pop.exe and save it in a safe place, preferably in a folder on your 1TB External Hard Drive, lol.

3. After you have saved the original executable, then you can Copy and Paste the pop.exe to the Install directory. By Default, it's C:\Program Files\UBISOFT\Prince of Persia The Sands of Time\ ...... Yes you want to Replace the damn file.

4. Double Click the Shortcut on your desktop.

5. Control Time, Kill People, Defend the Princes, Run on the walls, Scale very tall walls, get chopped up in little pieces by the contraptions that are trying to stop you, Beat the Game.

6. SEED THIS GAME !!!!

7. Tell your Friends about TPB.

8. Teach others how to do the things we can do, like copy games and stuff with programs like Alcohol 120%.

9. LONG LIVE TPB, and don't forget to Watch, Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time.

,subena,2012-01-27T18:45Z,"For those who have problems on win 7 64bit, here is what I did to make the game work;

-copied the contents of the CD2 into a folder on Desktop. ""xmltok.dll"" couldn't be copied.

- downloaded same .dll from this website :http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?xmltok and replaced it with the one on CD2

- restarted installation of the game, when it asked CD2 I pointed the folder with replaced .dll

It installed ok and game works fine so far.
