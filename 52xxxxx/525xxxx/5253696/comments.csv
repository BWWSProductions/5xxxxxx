,osirisgothra,2011-07-26T06:41Z,"just a general comment to people uploading tracker lists: YOU DONT NEED TO PUT IT IN A TEXT FILE!!! make it easier for EVERYONE ELSE by putting the tracker list directly into the torrent you are seeding, and just put some 1-kbyte text file explaining that the list is in the torrent---this way we can have the big list as soon as we have the torrent! much better approach!!!"
,cheborneck,2011-08-01T09:01Z,what I find is most of these trackers are dead and cause a slow down in any download!
