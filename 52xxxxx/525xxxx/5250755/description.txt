Starring Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett, directed by Fritz Lang. A first-class femme-fatale noir. Every dream and illusion is either suddenly dashed or slowly ground to dust in one plot-twist after another, except for one-- the dream of getting rid of that ugly, nagging hag of a wife! And if you think you can guess how that happens, think again...
