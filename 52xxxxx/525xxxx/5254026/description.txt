Release Notes:

For fans of: my bloody valentine, the smiths, the jesus and
mary chain, the vivian girls, c86. meet the pains of being
pure at heart, a four-piece from the same new york scene as
the vivian girls and crystal stilts who play dreamy, noisy pop
with boy / girl vocals, blissful melodies and blistering
drums. original members peggy, kip and alex came together
through a shared love of the pastels, the ramones, american
indie noisepop legends black tambourine and sunny sundae
smile - era my bloody valentine.

Now joined by drummer kurt, the pains proudly bring you their
self-titled debut album and the most infectious slice of pop
perfection you will hear all year, a distillation of all the
great noise-pop precedents - early mbv, house of love, jamc -
but with the incredible exuberance and energy that the pains
bring to every song, the excitement of youth just rushing
forth and sweeping the listener along. over ten tracks the
pains demonstrate an absolute mastery of noise / jangle pop,
their songs being a perfect distillation of classic pop melody
and thrilling, rushing guitar noise that have taste-making
blogs across the planet tripping over themselves in search of
superlatives. like their american peers black kids and vampire
weekend, the pains have a happy knack of taking the classic
sounds of the past and at once making them invigorating and
fresh, a knack sure to propel them to an audience beyond the
blogs and away from the scenester crowd that made their uk
tour dates crushed, sweaty and sold-out through word-of-mouth
alone. already dance-floor faves in london clubs such as twee
as fuck and how does it feel to be loved, and featured on our
own counter culture album for 2008, the pains debut will be
the sound of 2009, rocking the discos and blasting from ipods.
the pains are crafting noise pop gems that are timeless but
completely now, and their debut album serves notice of an
exhilarating new talent. on fortuna pop.
