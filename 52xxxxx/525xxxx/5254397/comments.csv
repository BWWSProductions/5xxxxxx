,tanilfa,2010-01-03T21:18Z,"It's true it's a DVD rip, but the video quality is sub-standard. It's very fuzzy and colors are slightly muted. It's a consideration screener, so I'm wondering if the quality was intentionally poor on the original disk, or was it too compressed after it was ripped? Either way, the video is about a 7 out of 10. I'd much rather prefer a less compressed rip. 

But thanks for the up nevertheless."

the files are rared, you need winrar to extract the movie, easily downloadable and usually one of the first progs any1 installs on a pc, once installed just right click the first .rar file and click extract here"

,the_one60,2010-01-04T05:38Z,"Please...Stop posting rar files or GTFO! Secene groups use rar because they post to newsgroups. Rars have no useful purpose in torrents other than hiding cracks and patches from Anti-virus progs. All the other reason given for using rars ONLY APPLY TO NEWSGROUPS! Back when The Scene started, newsgroup servers restricted the size of attachment in messages and RAR was the only compression utility that would easily split large files.
Scene groups sever a useful purpose, but people who just take these rar files and post them as torrents just make more work for torrent users. Please UNRAR before you post."
,OGma59,2010-01-04T05:52Z,"hye, ""the one_60"" YOU GE THE FUCK OFF.  you dis an upper for giving you an excellent rip for free? you are a complete douche.  is it so hard to right click and wait 30 seconds??  and there ARE legit reasons to up an movie in rars...if you don't know what they are, then YOU ARE THE NOOB.
you are an ungrateful prick, keep your ignorant comments to yourself, nobody else cars.

I'm watching this on my TV via a HDD/USB connection. The picture stutters the whole way through like there are just too few frames per minute. Is this to be expected from this type of file? I have watched a few movies on my tv this way and they have all been far better quality.

My TV says it plays mpeg-1, mpeg2, h.264/mpeg-4 avc files. This is a .avi file and I can play it but can't watch any .wmv files. Anyone any idea why? Do I need to convert?

Thx in advance for your help."

,fuckletmein,2010-01-21T08:39Z,"To the noobs who are complaining about RAR files. Most if not ALL torrents which are uploaded to ANY tracker, COME FROM USENET!... Usenet has a 15MB per article size restriction. This means, when someone posts an 'article' with an attachment (much like email with an attachment) on Usenet then their 'attachment' MUST NOT EXCEED 15MB! ...

This is why ALOT of torrents come in Multi-RAR form. The uploader is simply passing on the exact archive he got either from Usenet or from a friend who has a Usenet account. So stop fucking complaining about ""ohh in this day in age we're still dealing with rars"" you bunch of arrogant misguided pricks! Have a cup of concrete and HARDEN THE FUCK UP! 

RAR is not just used to split files up for EASIER TRANSMISSION. It's also a COMPRESSION FORMAT you bunch of dumbarses.. 

I bet you lot are the same fucking arseholes who complain about ""Ohh why is this file so big?!"" Jesus christ.... wake the fuck up and understand that you HAVE to almost ALWAYS sacrifice something for something else (e.g filesize for quality, quality for filesize).

Goddamn, every torrent comment section has these fucking morons who really don't understand how shit is done DESPITE THERE BEING THE WORLDS LARGEST LIBRARY ONLINE TO LOOK UP SHIT!!! A.K.A GOOGLE AND/OR WIKI!

Try researching a little before posting retarded bitchy comments.. Oh wait, most of you are 'too lazy' to do that and would probably respond with ""Oh why should i waste my time...."" in which case, turn off your computer, get rid of it and go outside in the real world. Clearly you're not cut out for how the internet works.

1. Get another hard drive if you don't like un-raring. The value of RARs far outweighs the little wear and tear of unRARing. If you do it to a second physical hd, it's pathetically easy. 

2. Viruses are not stored in RARs, and even if they were, your antivirus would catch it as soon as you unrar. Follow..? So what's the diff,you  idiot?

If you don't know why .rars are an ""industry"" standard, then go PAY for your movies. They solve problems you did not know existed.  and for you to ask ""What Problems?"" only furthers my point.
