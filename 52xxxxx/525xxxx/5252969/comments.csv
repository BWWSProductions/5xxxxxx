,sfbi,2010-01-04T18:46Z,"Dont think it is a good idea to wait for this. I found that this torrent contains exactly the same files as in http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5194238/Windows_7_Ultimate_no_activation_needed

Therefore, you can keep the files that you have downloaded, and use that torrent to continue (of course you need a client which supports file hashing and resuming)"
