[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-12T22:44Z,"I will ask everyone who downloaded any of my movies and liked the quality to give them +1 quality because I saw some movies with a lot of thanks comments and -1-2 quality.That's just retarded if you ask me...so remember,+1 if you like the quality. "
,maaadal,2010-04-03T21:58Z,"I love the movie. It is a highly under-rated film. Many people compare this movie with Braveheart because both movies came out in the same year, and have a Scottish theme. I think Rob Roy is the better movie.

video/audio quality A++++

 Thank you krisskringle - Gopo"
