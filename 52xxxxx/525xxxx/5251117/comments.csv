,LORDLORD,2010-01-03T13:00Z,"why in this and other torrent when i install, there is no subtitle line --- save as in subtitle editor ?

HElp, is there any good version out with this feature that works ?"
,LORDLORD,2010-01-03T13:12Z,"Instead of the ""save"" button I had on my former version, on the lower right of the subtitles window, it appears only ""Add a new subtitle line"". The ""save"" button is gone and I can't find it nowhere! Is this a bug? "

[T],SceneRlz,2010-02-05T12:09Z,"The reason why I didn't post release...
""BS.Player.Pro.v2.51.1022.Multilingual.Incl.Keymaker-CORE"" was this:
http://anubis.iseclab.org/?action=result&task_id=1c69fa0d850ebed447d1ae14b0823ebe8&format=html

I mean if you ripped serial from core's keygen, probably you're infected with malware...."

,ScorpionMKD,2010-02-15T04:13Z,"Wow, got it in 30 seconds."
,brianxxx,2010-02-21T16:38Z,You should do what I do with keygens. Run them only in a VMWARE machine then restore it to a clean state. I never have problems that way. lol
