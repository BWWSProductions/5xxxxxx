ANOTHER VERSION OF THE TRUTH: THE GIFT

On 5th May, 2008, Nine Inch Nails released "The Slip" for free via their website, as a gift to their fans. Or as Trent Reznor put it: "This one's on me".

On December 13th, 2008, dozens of Nine Inch Nails fans recorded the last show ofthe Lights In The Sky tour at Planet Hollywood, Las Vegas.

On January 7th, 2009, over 400Gb of video from the Victoria, Portland and Sacramento shows from the same tour were unofficially released by the band.

By working together, the Nine Inch Nails fan community have created "Another Version of the Truth" - a 3 disc creative commons release bringing together numerous editors, designers, and web programmers to create a professional digital film, followed by a physical release created by fans for fans.
