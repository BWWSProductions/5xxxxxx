I've grabbed just the CD, but Nero 10 doesn't recognize the .wv format.

Anyone know what to do?"
,tjs001,2010-11-17T22:44Z,"I've resolved the .wv problem I asked about.

I had downloaded a Nero patch from WavPack without success, but it turned out I just hadn't added it to enough places in Nero 10 (there are Audio Manager folders everywhere!).

Hope this helps anyone else in the same boat."
