,giyanvice,2011-10-15T00:16Z,"Willium_Bob_Cole @ Please don't misslead and specify exatly which shows you are talking about.
Shows on TV get longer because of the commercial breaks so be clear about where you are getting your info from.

impact0r @ Good job, well done."
,groverjones,2011-12-13T08:39Z,"For those wondering why the English subtitles with English audio, it's for those like me that are deaf or thereabouts.  More TV is catering to people like me, and I thank the uploader for this courtesy.
THis is my all time favourite series (all of them).  I'm still trying to get a copy of the Ballad of Big Al, and Nigel Marvens Chased by Dinosaurs, but I'm pretty happy.
I'm still seeding this after d/l a year ago.
