This new edition of Rita Mulcahy's worldwide best-selling PMPÂ® exam preparation book is aligned with the PMBOKÂ® Guideâ€”Fourth Edition. Features of this worldwide best-selling resource include the following:

    * More practice exam questionsâ€”over 400 throughout the book.
    * An increased focus on real-world project issues.
    * Brand new exercises and Tricks of the TradeÂ®.
    * Cross-references to PMBOKÂ® Guide pages for easy lookup.
    * A new chapter dedicated exclusively to making sure you pass the exam on your first attempt.

There are other copies floating on the web, but this one is by far the best scan quality which is why it is so heavy. You will not find this anywhere else. So DL this one, save $99 & violate PMI ethics(oops!)
