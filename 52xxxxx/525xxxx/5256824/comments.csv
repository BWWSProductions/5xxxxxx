,Eviex3,2011-02-28T02:09Z,Hey I installed this once fine but then I went and installed Luka (which didnt seem to work for me since I couldn't figure out how to remove my registration key from Gackpoid) so since I gave up on Luka I reinstalled this one.. However I'm getting errors again.. Ideas please?
