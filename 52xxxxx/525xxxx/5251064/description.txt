This is a nice comdey for some, and it too is out of print and is available for instant one click free download at our movie reviews website moviesbyrizzo.info

The movie we launched last night is similarly available as are many other such "out of prints" So its hard to understand why anyone would pass on the offer! Simply grab the download and use it to join the seed if you wish! Thanks
We also have some French, German and Italin language version being posted there
especially if they lack strong seeding support historically for whatever reason.

"Being there"' is about a culture that is often mistaken by paranoid feigns and cues as they are overused Im afraid in place of real wisdom. As such the accidental genius of Peter sellers could someday launch a nuclear missile perhaps, or whatever, if the nation is led by people who count on hidden meanings in things to determine what they are being told to do, all to often if you read between the lines in this cultural context as i am trained to do.


Its an interestinbg movie, however some will find it a tad boring given the level of humour is disguised for a certain pallate of appealwithin this cultural context as I say.
