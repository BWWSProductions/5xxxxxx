,DiaboLiCaL420,2010-01-27T22:29Z,"I must ask cause im curious, but what exactly does this mean ""though it offers only a fraction of what you should expect from a retail product.""

,dollydagger91,2010-05-15T10:34Z,"i dont understand how to install it, why are there 6 of the same files? help me plz anyone:("
,R0CKLOBSTER,2010-06-01T09:40Z,"dolly, those r called .rar files, u need 2 extract with winrar, a program u can get from rarlabs.com. also this is a free game 2 DL from their site with better than p2p speeds. unless this is a special version go to the site n DL it. no offence to the uploader! if i didnt already have it i might have gooten it from you.   =)   "
,vanja0317,2010-07-05T01:15Z,Is this US installation or EU?
,165427,2010-07-19T08:15Z,"i don't get it, you put a picture of collector's pack edition and when i install the game i DONT get any of the collector's pack champions/bonuses? wtf?"
,gurupitka,2010-09-27T00:10Z,works ok.
,Rsslone,2010-10-03T03:02Z,"Why would you post this, you can just go to there website and download it free, and its pando media booster so, no speed increase"
,Coga95,2010-10-11T19:12Z,"dollydagger91

I am kinda late but anyway ....

,BigBadVoodoo,2010-10-28T17:43Z,"hi i downloaded the torrent and extracted the files...than i installed the game but when i run it, it keeps updating patches and closing and over and over...i don't know what should i do?"
,cerenatan,2010-11-13T09:15Z,"yeah, i am having the same problem too. its updating LOL.airtime after completing the installation. Is there anyway to solve this? Any kind of new patch available?"
,roflpanda,2010-11-16T23:22Z,"For all of you that are wondering why the game keeps updating after installation, it's because it's an online game, not single player. Multiple patches for new game data and content have been added since the release of the game.

It's a free game. A trip to the official website would tell you all you need to know."
,Rovelius,2011-01-14T21:29Z,"I can't help but wonder why anyone would download this. The game is free, you can download it from the official website along with other things... and you don't get that silly description containing obvious fanboy-ism for HoN, too."
,FreeeQQ,2011-01-21T08:18Z,"Thank you very much gamerguy1, I could not get the pando installer to work for the life of me, tried everything they gave in the guides to get it to work (and I'm in IT too, I'm not a computer dummy), but my 'system' just couldn't get hooked up to the download server

Your torrent is best torrent"
,totermusiker,2011-01-28T01:25Z,"Thanks for the torrent.

,cjfosho,2011-03-27T08:56Z,"ok everyone asking why the fuck he would upload this...shut the fuck up. first off why would it matter? and if you know LoL was available for free from the website then why the hell are you searching for it? and THANKFULLY gamerguy1 uploaded it because every time i have tried to download it, it wouldn't work. and i'm not technologically retarded either and i'm not the only one many others i have talked to couldn't get it to work no matter what they tried. so fuck off. also thanks gamerguy1"
