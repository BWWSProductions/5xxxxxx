In Wii Sports Resort, you'll use your Wii Remote to literally swing into action. Perform realistic sports moves to take on the competition in activities that include Sword Play, Power Cruising (racing a water scooter) and Disc Dog, in which you'll toss a disc to an adorable, Mii-like dog. Become even more immersed in the action courtesy of the included Wii MotionPlus accessory, which attaches to your Wii Remote to provide even greater responsiveness and precision. With the game's easy-to-use controls, anyone can pick up a Wii Remote and leap into the game to experience all the heated competition and hilarity.
