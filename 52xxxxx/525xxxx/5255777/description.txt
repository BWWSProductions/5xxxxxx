BBC Life 06of10 Insects HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Episode 6. Insects.
The nature documentary looks at insects, the most successful animal group ever. There are 200 million insects for each of us. Darwin's stag beetle fights in the tree tops with huge curved jaws, the camera flies with millions of monarch butterflies, and super-slow motion shows a bombardier beetle firing boiling liquid at enemies through a rotating nozzle. Also a honey bee army stings a raiding bear into submission and grass cutter ants march like a Roman army, harvesting grass they cannot eat.
