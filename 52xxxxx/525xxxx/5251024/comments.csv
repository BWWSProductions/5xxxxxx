,Benson,2010-01-06T20:39Z,"You are wrong karolinesin! You dont need dvdshrink or nero recode. Just unpack to ISO files on the discs and unpack ISO file with Isobuster. Disc 2 failed file realocation when trying to burn i Nero, you can fix that problem with FixVTS run the whole DVD option."
,poon!!,2010-01-06T22:12Z,"As karolinesin said, files missing in disc 3 and 5. 
The other ones are working.

,nallefnahsq,2010-02-13T13:28Z,"Hi, I'm sorry! Don't know what happend. It seems my computer is ""eating"" files. I've made some new torrent for the missing files. Don't know how to put in missing files in existing torrents, so I made new torrents for every missing file. Hope this will correct the problems.
