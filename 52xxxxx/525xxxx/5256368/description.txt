                    In the final episode of the series, Jeremy  
                    Clarkson makes a film about the BMW X6 and ends  
                    up conducting one of the most expensive road  
                    tests in Top Gear history. James May drives the  
                    new Vauxhall Insignia VXR, accompanied by  
                    Margaret Calvert, the designer of Britain's  
                    road signs; and Richard Hammond tests the  
                    340,000 pound Lexus supercar on the Top Gear  
                    track. The boys then try out the latest in  
                    electric personal transport in the studio, and  
                    the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car is blues
