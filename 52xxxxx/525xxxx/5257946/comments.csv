,xXxPrimexXx,2010-01-09T11:13Z,ANd I think rarely any1 must have complted download!! All due to MKVGuy sucker guy; coz HE DOESNT SEED MEANS A LOT!!
,Bum_Fluff,2010-01-09T11:24Z,another unhappy customer.  I'm (and have been one) of the 99.8% losers.  been here for days.  
[V],MKVGuy,2010-01-09T18:44Z,"guys, that is not my normal behaviour, so plz dont shout on me..
this happened because my connection had some problem and I took help from a friend to seed my file, so moving the file to a different system resulted in loss of one packet..

also I don't think without that one packet u guys were not able to watch it??

I hope now all would be happy cuz my connection is back as it was.."

@MKVGuy

,surajitghosh37,2010-01-13T06:19Z,"very good work mkv guys,hey man how do you get the perfect subtitles?i cannot get the subs for the 400 mb files."
[V],MKVGuy,2010-01-13T19:06Z,"thanks for your lovely comments guys.. and I am trying my best to be frequent..

@surajitghosh37
you can find perfect subs by just caring about the frame rate that you have and the frame rate of the file that you have downloaded.. mostly the frame rate is 23.976 fps so you can download subs from most of the rippers..
try subscene.com for Google it with 'movie name+subtitles'.."
,surajitghosh37,2010-01-14T20:46Z,"thank you so much mkvguy,i really think you are the best ripper around,considering the file size and quality.we love you.keep it up,looking forward to your new posts."
,allsortsoneshop,2010-01-14T22:39Z,how come i get no sound on this
,surajitghosh37,2010-01-15T12:36Z,"hey man,can i ask u a favor?could pls upload ""13 going on 30""?i know its a 2004 movie and it is kind of a late request but its a very fun movie,i would really appreciate it and will seed it for a month.as alway u r the best and take care."
,surajitghosh37,2010-01-15T12:38Z,@allsortsoneshop  try playing it in GOM player and if required download the codec suggested by GOM player
