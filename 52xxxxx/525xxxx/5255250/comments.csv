Muslims are the vilest of animals?
Show mercy to one another, but be ruthless to Muslims
How perverse are Muslims
Strike off the heads of Muslims, as well as their fingertips
Fight those Muslims who are near to you
Muslim mischief makers should be murdered or crucified
Yes, and I am part of the worldwide Zionist Conspiracy, and I am not even jewish.

One of the many lies Muslims tell;

""Muhammad never killed anyone.?

The Muslim Game:

In order to give others the impression that Muhammad was a man of peace, Muslims sometimes claim that he never killed anyone.  By this, they mean that he never slew anyone with his own hand (except in battle? which they may or may not remember to mention).  

The Truth:

By this logic, Hitler never killed anyone either."

You are a prehistoric animal. Swine are better than you. You force your moronic beliefs on the world and if they dont agree you kill them. I hope you drown in the intestines of pigs.
DUMB FUCK!!!!!!!"
