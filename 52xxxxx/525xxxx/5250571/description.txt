Little Black Book (2004) 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361841

With Brittany Murphy, Holly Hunter, Kathy Bates.

Genre: Comedy | Romance | Drama
Plot: A woman snoops through her boyfriend's palm pilot and reveals his former girlfriends, which causes her to question why they're still listed in his little black book.

An intelligent script well directed. Brittany Murphy is impressive in seamless performance.

Personal note @addictedtomovies: Thank you for pointing me to this great, funny,
entertaining and smart movie. Brittany's best role I've seen(equally mesmerizing as in Don't Say a Word). 
Thanks again.
At the beginning was the quote from Shakespeare's "The Tempest":
"Hell is empty. All the devils are here."

Note to all: It was hard-to-get one... and considering what was the input, I am satisfied with A8/V8. It is re-encoded old XviD copy of mediocre quality.
