Ever wondered if you too could make a game? Maybe a shooter? No
programming? Then this is for you. Make your own single or multi-
player games. Yes, with multiplayer support! I made my first game
in under 30 minutes. Try for yourself. And whats the coolest thing
about it? You can make stand-alone executables and share with your
friends ;)

EDIT: Further updates are available from the FPS Creator main
      website, but DON'T update since it will turn your full version
      into the free one, and WON'T allow you to build stand-alone
      executables anymore.


Happy "programming" ;D
