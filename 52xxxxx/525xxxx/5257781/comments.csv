,Jack_Raiden,2010-02-04T07:00Z,"6 channels of audio at 192 kbps = LOL
(All audio above, say, 5 Khz will be cut off!)

From specs, looks like nice video quality, though."
,herniator,2010-02-04T14:20Z,"192kbps AAC 5.1 sound is fine.  Keep in mind that a 48kbps stereo AAC stream is of similar quality to a 128kbps MP3 stream.  Also, it isn't really like 6 full channels, because sounds are distributed among them to an extent (voice from center, fx from surround, low freq fx only from sub).  More like the equivalent of 4 full complexity channels.  So basically it is like the quality of two 256kbps MP3 stereo steams.  More than adequate unless you are a bat or some shit.

Thanks Westy!"
,Jack_Raiden,2010-02-06T09:00Z,"@herniator: ""48kbps stereo AAC stream is of similar quality to a 128kbps MP3 stream."" 

AAC is not THAT magical. Actually, it may be only slightly higher quality than an identical bitrate MP3, at least in tests I've seen and performed.

""Also, it isn't really like 6 full channels ... sounds are distributed ... More like the equivalent of 4 full complexity channels ... it is like the quality of two 256kbps MP3 stereo steams.""

That all undoubtedly helps, but all that matters is the final audio quality. Just take a listen, try to compare to the original audio (ex: HR's release). Analyze the data (ex: Audacity, plot spectrum) to see why: All audio over ~5-7 KHz has vanished. (~15-18 Khz would be a normal/decent cutoff, matching human ear.)

The point is that a lot of audio data has to be sacrificed (perhaps unbeknownst to encoders) to meet such a low, extremely insufficient bitrate, such as 6 ch. AAC at 192-256 kbps.

Just a friendly debate! (Don't hurt me, Westy!)"
,derrique,2010-02-25T12:36Z,"yes indeed, the quality seems great....
up until 1:37 when the film stops for a few seconds and then continues without audio... )-:
the question is whether this is a download glitch.. ?
or is this mp4 format destined for devices like Ipods and not for my outdated macbook... ?"

Thanks"

Now how this fuck can have a skull is fucking beyond me.

,tinny112,2010-04-14T08:18Z,good quality. shitty movie
,texi400,2010-06-07T19:03Z,"Found the picture quality of the video was trully excellent but despite the contributions from a few tech'ies here, I couldn't adjust the sound balance between the impressive surround sound effects and the dialogue, the latter was all but lost completely. Probably my innability to do me tweeks correctly.

Darn, that kind of war is hell."
,jiggysiggy,2011-03-09T14:51Z,"warnung an alle deutschen nutzer!!! dieser torrent wird von der kriminellen abzocker-kanzlei ""waldorf und frommer"" ueberwacht. mit dem download dieses films riskiert ihr eine abmahnung von 1000 euro. ehrlich gesagt ist dieser film eh ziemlich kacke, er ist es jedenfalls nicht wert dafuer geld auszugeben. wenn ihr den film unbedingt haben wollt dann holt ihn euch bei einem one-klick-hoster, dann koennen euch zumindest die waldorf-frommer-hurensoehne nichts anhaben."
