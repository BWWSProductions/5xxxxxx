,dancetripper,2010-12-15T00:04Z,"Hi there, i've downloaded the torrent and burned it with IMGBurn. Everithing is OK, the console recognises it, but the problem appears when i start the game - after the starting screen (which tells me to hold securely the remote comtrol and bla bla...) the screen gets black and there is some kind of error massage (the disc can't be read - something like that).
I have the exact same problem with another game uploaded by you - Just Dance. Am I doing something wrong or hte problem is somewhere else ?"
