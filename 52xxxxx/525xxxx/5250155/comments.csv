,spacelord76,2010-01-01T13:18Z,Most movies aren't 1080. But as far as I know it only means that you have black in the upper and lower part of the screen. Still good quality.
,Tortolini,2010-01-03T04:41Z,thanks a bunch CHD!
,bitabur,2010-01-04T17:46Z,"The bluray might encode black for the top and bottom, but if it's 1920 wide than it's a ""1080p"" standard movie.  If that's the case, the mkv rip just gets rid of the pixel data for the bars, as it's a waste of space.  Many blurays are in 2.35 aspect and will not fill a 16:9 hdtv."
