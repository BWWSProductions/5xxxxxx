This is a Fan Made DTS Quadraphonic mix of Rush's Moving Pictures Album. All of the songs from the album plus Closer to the Heart, and Working Man are included. The mix present here has been reviewed by a few other people and has been given their approval. 

I used the Rockband Master tracks as the basis for the mix, but i have created better separation in many places. Dont worry, i did not use filters to create the effect so the audio has not been damaged. Please enjoy. 

Warning: if you do not have a DTS compatable system, you will only hear static. This static can be very loud, and can damage both your speakers and your ears. Be sure to turn up the volume slowly if you are unsure. 

Peace Out and RUSH ON!!!
