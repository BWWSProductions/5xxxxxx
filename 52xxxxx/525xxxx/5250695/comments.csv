[V],twentyforty,2010-01-01T14:59Z,"Thanks lilars...word ""happier"" is used in more cultures and languages. That's why I have pointed to word ""happier"", as more proper and common to English speaking countries than short-living, soon-to-be-expired word ""happy"" (describes a state of mind, not ""everlasting thrive"") Use of ""happier"" expresses a wish to be more happy, to move on better place in life, not as static and self-indulging word ""happy"".

To be Happier... that's what I wish to all of you, my displaced and pixelated friends..."

[V],twentyforty,2010-01-01T18:34Z,"Wow, Xmas and New Year spirit has taken over - H264 of Brothers just hit 1000 downloads with - zero (null, zilch, nada) thanks or comments. I guess I'm doing something terribly wrong...but hey... at least I don't get ""Fake"" cries or ""To low quality to be watched"" as on some mirror/sister sites (which make me nauseous even by peeking into)."
