[T],kimeesteres,2011-09-10T05:29Z,"Hey, Neo, you're welcome for the soundtrack upload. I know all the words too!

Re: minifrepper and his/her 60's comment -- He/she was referring to the band Holy Mackerel, which Paul Williams was in during the 60's. So, minifrepper is not a bonehead, as far as I can tell. 

Trust me! :)"
