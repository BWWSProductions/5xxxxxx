,cigaretteburns,2010-01-07T12:08Z,malkyvich - lots of people burn discs - to loan to friends who aren't as geeky as us! Is sound in sync in this version? VOMIT's version was badly out of sync. Downloading anyway. 
,neeliesu,2010-02-09T08:04Z,"Thanx .BONE. Good quality, great British actors, BUT this film should come with a warning, I couldn't watch the whole film, the foul language was way, way over the top. Not one for the ladies."
