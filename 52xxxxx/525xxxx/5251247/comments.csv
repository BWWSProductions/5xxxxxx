,OttoBismark,2010-01-02T02:09Z,"@ifandbut-
the easiest way I know of to fix audio sync is to use the free and open source VLC to play videos,  
then click tools---track synchronization and there is a simples dailog box to adjust the video.

Otherwise, you can use video editing software."
,andrew0_0,2010-01-02T04:38Z,"its not fake, as for the audio...hum, it worked fine on the file from dailymotion. all i did was make a torrent in utorrent, sorry."
,Prevok,2010-01-04T05:47Z,"It's all good. The audio is out of sync when playing with Media Player Classic, but it ok with VLC. I guess MPC does not like mp4 file..."
,ezboard,2010-01-11T01:35Z,"I keep trying to download, but I keep getting 404'd, where is this torrent?"
,DismalN,2010-02-17T01:49Z,"i just shifted the audio -1900 ms. right click the video, go to options, and you'll see 'audio switcher'. the setting is there."
