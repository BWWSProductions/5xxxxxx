,s2kdude,2010-02-15T04:29Z,Got the install going and the game to boot up but when you start a career sometimes the intro goes on 3 or 4 times and you cant skip it. Also it freezes up on me everytime I try to go into the test lap and closes and when I do get about half way around the lap the steering is way off and inaccurate and I've tried all the resolution and graphics settings. Anyone have any suggestions? I am using a laptop with Windows 7 as well if that helps. I tried looking for patches but nothing!
