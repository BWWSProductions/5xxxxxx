Jad 1.58 for Mac OS X
It has unfortunately become extremely hard
to find Jad anywhere.  You can thank me
for finding Jad.

---System Requirements------------------------------
 - Mac OS X 10.4.6
 - A proper torrent downloader to download this.

---Other requirements, not system-------------------
 - You must have the time to seed this,
   don't be selfish

First download the torrent (a no-brainer)
using Vuze, Tomato Torrent, or similar
NOTE: Vuze is formerly Azureus.

In Finder, press CMD+G and type
/usr/bin

Drop "jad" into /usr/bin
Finder will ask you to authenticate to
put it in there.

Installed!

---How to use JAD-----------------------------------
Open Terminal, it's in the Utilities folder.
Press Shift+Command+U to open the Utilities folder.

Use the "cd" command to cd to the directory
of your class files you want to decompile.
Then type jad *.class
