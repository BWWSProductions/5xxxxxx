Includes: Log/Cue

The album art features a 1977 portrait of renowned Butoh dancer, Kazuo Ohno, taken by Naoya Ikegami in Tokyo. Ohno is shown reaching towards light, his striking visage and reclined posture simultaneously invoking the cradle, the grave, and transcendence.

Antony says, "The Crying Light is dedicated to the great dancer Kazuo Ohno. In performance I watched him cast a circle of light upon the stage, and step into that circle, and reveal the dreams and reveries of his heart. He seemed to dance in the eye of something mysterious and creative; with every gesture he embodied the child and the feminine divine. He's kind of like my art parent."
