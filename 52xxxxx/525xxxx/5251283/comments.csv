,bamboofm,2012-03-04T04:07Z,"i use flashoffliner for playing games like this ...
if the game is hosted online somewhere, you can dl it here :: http://file2hd.com/Default.aspx
set the filter for objects and get the loader, than integrate it in flashoffliner, quite simple and interner connection not needed for playing after all that ...
hope it is helpful in some way !:  ))"
