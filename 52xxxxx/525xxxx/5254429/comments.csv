Rars have no useful purpose in torrents other than hiding cracks and patches from Anti-virus progs. All the other reason given for using rars ONLY APPLY TO NEWSGROUPS! Back when The Scene started, newsgroup servers restricted the size of attachment in messages and RAR was the only compression utility that would easily split large files.
Scene groups sever a useful purpose, but people who just take these rar files and post them as torrents just make more work for torrent users. Please UNRAR before you post."
