"The Crying Game" is a song written by Geoff Stephens, and first released by Dave Berry in July 1964. It reached #5 in the UK Singles Chart. Then-unknown guitarist, session guitarist Jimmy Page played rhythm guitar in this song. Jimmy Page revealed this when Ritchie Blackmore asked him whether he played on this track. In his interview to Martin K. Webb he says

Jimmy used to run around telling everyone that he played on certain records. I asked him if he played on "The Crying Game" -that was Dave Berry- and "My Baby Left Me." He said,"Yes,I played guitar on that." What he didn't say was that he played rhythm guitar on it. Big Jim Sullivan played the solo on "The Crying Game." He was livid when he heard what Jimmy was running around saying, because Jimmy had always used his guitar and everything. Jimmy played rhythm guitar because the lead guitar bit was a reading part and Jimmy couldn't read.


The song was covered by Boy George in 1992 as the theme to the Neil Jordan movie, The Crying Game. Produced by the Pet Shop Boys, it turned out to be his last major hit single, reaching #22 on the UK Singles Chart in 1992, #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the U.S. and #1 in Canada the following year.

In addition the song has been covered by artists such as Brenda Lee, The Associates, Kylie Minogue, Percy Sledge, Chris Spedding, Blue System, and crooner Alex Moore.

A version of the song was featured in the Jim Carrey film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective
