Would you be so kind enough to tell the movies which you will upload from your list?

Please... anxiously waiting for your reply."
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-02T00:59Z,I downloaded another source for Audition because from the first one I couldn't extract the sound so that means that I'll have to rip the movie again.

I Was Thinking About This One Just 2 Days Ago.

Wonderful."

Any chance to get Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources is high res?

thanks again."
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-12T21:57Z,"No,there is no chance because there are no high-resolution sources for those movies and I don't take requests."
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-12T22:39Z,"I will ask everyone who downloaded any of my movies and liked the quality to give them +1 quality because I saw some movies with a lot of thanks comments and -1-2 quality.That's just retarded if you ask me...so remember,+1 if you like the quality. "
