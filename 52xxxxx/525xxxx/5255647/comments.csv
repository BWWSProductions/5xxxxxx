[T],Mayweed2000,2010-01-03T17:46Z,"Just so you all know, since we're starting from scratch with this torrent, I am the only one seeding at the beginning.  My upload is extremely slow, thanks to my ISP.  Funny, I can download at over 800k/sec, but only upload at maybe 5k/sec.  Cruel world, isn't it?  Just be patient, and after around 3 months, a whole bunch of people will have this torrent all at the same time, and if they were to all seed, the download rate would be incredible."
,tooticki,2010-01-03T17:59Z,"You are not alone, mate. ;-)

I downloaded your old torrent. I'll help you seed until it gets going. I have a 100/10 line, but I'll be seeding the movies off a somewhat sluggish USB drive which may slow things down a  little.

A belated thank you. My account was fucked up and I couldn't post back when I downloaded it, so I'll say a belated thank you now.  It's a great collection.

Checked 25%..."
,tooticki,2010-01-03T19:16Z,"It didn't work. Are the files changed since last time? A little bit i missing in each one. I'm reluctant to download the missing bits since I don't know if that would screw my files up. :-(

In this torrent there's also a great number of padding files. Could that have anything to do with it?"
[T],Mayweed2000,2010-01-03T20:46Z,"Hi, tooticki.  If you want to download the files you have left, nothing will get messed up at all.  Try a hash check.  To do this, ensure that the new torrent is showing in your torrent sharing software.  Don't have the torrent open, right click on it, and there should be an option to do a manual hash check.  Your old torrent may be able to read what you've had before, and continue the download.  Hope it works, and good luck!"
,tooticki,2010-01-03T21:36Z,"That's what I've been doing. There are no missing files. A tiny bit of every file is missing/different.

But OK, I guess it won't screw up my files. Why are the new files different though?"
[T],Mayweed2000,2010-01-03T23:11Z,"The only difference in this torrent and the original is one file I added, a half-hour educational short.  When I tried uploading the original torrent, the site said that it already exists.  My only other option that I could think of was to create a brand new torrent."
,tooticki,2010-01-03T23:49Z,"Yeah, I saw later there was an new avi. So the Toot Whistle things isn't Disney? I skip that file then. 

Often when I try to re-seed files there is this problem, some bits are missing. I don't get  why when the files should be identical. But usually that happens with rars and only one or two are affected. Here ALL the old files files stop at 99.nn % when rechecking.

Don't get too good up speed. Only 1.67 GB up so far."
[T],Mayweed2000,2010-01-03T23:54Z,"Actually, Toot Whistle Plunk & Boom is a Disney short.  It's pretty nostalgic.  "
,billybog,2010-01-05T21:09Z,"Great torrent, thanks.  Has anyone ever run across a copy of ""Black Arrow"" with Oliver Reed, or ""a walt disney christmas""?"
,tooticki,2010-01-06T17:17Z,"OK, thanks. I downloaded Toot too. It has taken until now.

Now I have upload at 1 MB. I've had to turn the HD off at night, but I have uploaded 35 GB anyway.
"
,tooticki,2010-01-06T17:18Z,That came out wrong. Now my upspeed is 1 MB.
[T],Mayweed2000,2010-01-07T01:58Z,"Thanks, tooticki.  You rock!!"
,Bum_Fluff,2010-01-07T03:40Z,sigh.  
[T],Mac-Sparrow,2010-01-07T13:17Z,I only have the last upload you made of this. Think I can seed then?
,a.d.o.2,2010-01-08T13:04Z,"Great collection!!! I had to move stuff to my external drive and delete practically all the things I had on my computer to download this, but it's worth it :).

One thing I wonder is, do I have to download all the padding files that are included? Right now I have them unmarked on uTorrent...

Thanks again Mayweed2000! Will seed for a loooong time!"
,DL_King,2010-01-19T06:13Z,"Firstly thank you so much for this amazing and extensive torrent!!!

I plan to help you seed this sucker with my whole server (4 more seed sources), but there's the clincher... I had initially finished downloading your original torrent, I went to add other seed sources and realized you had re-uploaded a slightly different torrent (addition of Toot Whistle Plunk and Boom no big deal).

However because you created your torrent in crappy (no anger to you, just that shitty torrent agent) bitcomet using the ""file align to piece boundary"" option. When this feature is used, each file is padded to make sure that the file size plus the padding is a multiple of the piece size. So virtually each file has a padding with it, adding hundreds of MB to the download. Although these files are useless to anyone not using comet (as comet recognizes and discards) they are unfortunately necessary in order to fully complete the torrent and seed. They can't be ignored because the final piece for each file contains the padded part, clients other than BitComet have to download the padding, as they cannot hash or check an incomplete piece. 

So next time please do not use BitComet to create torrents or at least don't use the ""file align to piece boundary"" option.

Thanks again!!! Awesome quality V10/10 A10/10
and as I said I will be adding all my seeding resources to your new torrent as soon as I download toot and those terrible padding files."
,DL_King,2010-01-23T09:05Z,Just Finished. I will seed for a while
,drmmrtrey,2010-01-29T01:02Z,This is epic
,Elias-T,2010-02-02T00:27Z,"I'm using uTorrent, and it labels all the padding files as separate files when I add the torrent.  Can I un-check the boxes of each padding file to save some time downloading?"
,a.d.o.2,2010-02-02T17:49Z,"Thanks for the answer, DL-King!

@Elias-T
I am also using uTorrent, and I unmarked all the padding files, but uTorrent downloaded them anyway... It takes some extra time, but it doesn't really matter, cause it's really worth it! :)

Thanks once again, Mayweed!"
,irishking,2010-02-05T07:47Z,i have been downloading this for a week now and it  has has not even compleaded 3%.... can we get more seeders or some info on how to sped it up?  i cant seed untill i get it finished.. thanks

,ruefel,2010-03-21T21:54Z,I love this torrent! please people seed!!!! at the moment I upload more then I download...my ratio is over 1.2! :)  I hope everyone will help out so that the first ones reach the magical 100%. Thanks for this torrent!
,25Uhooah,2010-03-21T23:32Z,I will seed for as long as my shitty ISP lets me.. When I first tried to download when my wife got pregnant I was only 52% at 7 months pregnant. Since I upgraded to windows 7 I'd recommend downloading the torrent in parts.. 10 gig parts imo

,HiEVERYBODY7,2010-04-26T11:23Z,"Hi guys
My max upload is 90 kb/s. You are using 100% of my upload capacity. Like I said b4, I WILL SEED until there are no LEECHERS!!!! 
PROMISE!!"
,pl00ke,2010-04-29T12:15Z,Darby O'Gill and the Little People has no audio past the beginnig :/
[T],Mayweed2000,2010-04-29T13:54Z,"pl00ke - you are incorrect.  I stand by my work, and all of these movies have complete audio, all in English, and are all in sync.  Maybe you are trying to watch a partially downloaded file, are missing the right codecs (make sure you have the ac3 codec), or you can try vlc media player."
,jazmineaidelyn,2010-05-07T23:13Z,I am new here and i have a 18month old baby and i would love to download this movies. my speed is 2.0 kps. do you know long will it take to download?
,oogaboogaman,2010-05-13T09:12Z,Unlimited thankses to you good sir and/or madame :D I'll seed as much as possible. Might have to cut it off every now and then to actually use my internet though :P

What is internet ex 8????

I have RoadRunner internet. 

At speedtest.net, it shows me getting about an average of 30 mb/s.

Its funny b/c I only pay for the 7mb/s plan :D

Go to speedtest.net and click a server that is located next to you and tell me what your downloading speed is :P"

I will leave this running for a week.  Also people, please limit the number of upload slots you have per torrent in order to more quickly generate seeders.  If you have 50 peers trying to connect to you but you have a max of 90kB/s that's not going to help much."
