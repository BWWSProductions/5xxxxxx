,dnlcrdns,2010-01-05T01:40Z,yup its real
,xforewarnedx,2010-01-05T01:58Z,It's real. 2 songs that were previously released and I assume the rest from the myspace. Cover is with it but not numbered correctly.
,henry76,2010-01-06T12:28Z,Awsome :O) Thanks :D...
,spinoza77,2010-01-06T17:55Z,thx for sharing!
,bigrussta,2010-01-06T22:54Z,"There's no way that this is a direct CD rip. 

""Horchata"" and ""Cousins"" are quite clearly taken from a different source. It's not only noticeable in volume level but the ID3 tags show it too. And speaking of those, none of the tracks are actually numbered, they just have the track number it is in front of the track name which anyone sticking this on their mp3 player is obviously going to change.

It's by no means terrible quality and is worth downloading until the real rips get here in a few days I just don't understand the point of labeling the release as something it's not."
,AlfredYLeVolcmp,2010-01-15T03:46Z,Horchata is glitched.  Maybe its just my dload. Dunno.
