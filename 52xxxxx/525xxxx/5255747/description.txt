PLOT

Students learn on the first day of classes that their teachers expect them to know everything. In dance class, Ms. Kraft is worried about Kevin's dancing, but is easily impressed by Alice. In acting class, Jenny feels uncomfortable to let loose and be crazy like everyone else. In music class, Mr. Cranston gives Victor pointers, while Denise plays the music perfectly on the piano. In the lunchroom, everyone practices their major and they all get up and dance ("This Is My Life"), and Denise and Malik escape the madness and they talk to each other, Denise saying the her parents thinks that the school was 'people sitting around, practicing cello all day', and that they would die if they saw this, Malik reveals that his mom doesn't even know that he is going to the school. Just before Freshman year ends, it shows Malik at his apartment, his mom finding his report card, making in clear that he goes to P.A. She is angry, and asks who even told him that he was special, but he still continued to go to the school. The year closes after she goes to work and leaves Malik standing alone.
[edit] Sophomore year

As the new school year begins, it shows the dancers all practicing in a circle, but once it is Kevin's turn, he is out-shined and is forced to go back in his original spot. And Victor is having trouble sticking to the right music, and adds his own spin on whatever he is playing, which doesn't sit well with Mr. Cranston. Malik, in theater class, talks about his dead sister, Ayana, which causes Mr. Dowd to ask questions that he refuses to answer, then leaves, stating that he's gonna be famous, no matter what anyone else says. Denise is playing her classical piano, but then starts to sing, thinking that she's alone, but then, when she is finished, the bell rings. She leaves, but then you see that Malik was watching the whole time. He brings her to Victor and convinces her to sing for the album that they were producing, which she agrees to, as long as her strict father doesn't find out. There is a Halloween party, where Malik plays the song while being D.J., but says the vocals are 'anonymous', making Denise's face fall, which confuses Malik. Marco asks Jenny out on a date, (though, not for the first time), and she asks why he keeps trying. But then agrees to go with him to dinner at his dad's restaurant. They go, and she convinces him to play a song and sing on the piano, he does ("Try"), and she ends up giving his a money tip. The sophomore year portion of the movie end with them kissing.
