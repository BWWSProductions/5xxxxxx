my amigo.

Well i must say that destiny brought me to this link and yes there is
this part common between us.

I appreciate what you have done on the TPB and sincerely thank you
from the bottom of my heart(both auricles and ventricles included).

Kindly share the link where you have downloaded the 52 episodes of the
wonderful wizard of Oz and please also explain if it is the english
dubbed uncut version of the japanese animation or not.

I found that 'sharing is caring' on TPB and you have cared a lot for
the childhood dreams of many on distant and farside of this planet.

May god help you realize all your dreams.

May u get a supercool Girl/Boy-friend


Warm Regards,

Ramses Makhija"
