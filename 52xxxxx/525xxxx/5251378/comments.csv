Obviously you have no idea what you are talking about when it comes to the military that defends the rights of the American people. 

America has given more resources to 3rd world nations and people then any other country. We have given away rather then taken. 

I commend a brother for taking the time to follow his brothers into the combat battle zone to show what war does to our troops and what their lives are like over there."

,erich555,2010-06-24T21:21Z,"We'd wait till like 3 in the morning and start kicking in doors of folks we were suspicious of. Other than that, we looked at palm trees that nobody trimmed, watched people throw all their garbage out the window on to the sidewalk. Uneventful. God bless all those that lost their lives. I didn't see them."
