,koo107,2010-02-26T08:43Z,All these FLAC files are fake. They may be converted from mp3 files. You all can check them by seeing the spectrum or frequency of the files. The one who did this conversion is very stupid.
[V],cenkota,2010-05-16T23:45Z,uh.. these are 100% no fake. If you actually made spectrals please post them and I'll try to see if there is a chance this is a lossy master
[V],cenkota,2010-05-16T23:48Z,Just to clarify.. a lossy master is where the original CD is sourced from mp3 or another lossy format. This happens occasionally. Regardless these files (in this torrent) are ripped directly from the original CD and compressed into FLAC.
