,snow7269,2010-01-04T19:28Z,can someone please tell me why some of my movies get detected and some doesnt. And what can I do to prevent it because I am tired of my internet getting shut down. 
,aelfred,2010-01-04T19:42Z,Snow I do not understand what you mean or what country you live in however. Try using the Opera Browser to download your torrents. If your isp is blocking you there is nothing you can do.
,devilsditchdigger,2010-01-04T21:16Z,"whay tag it axxo aren't the authorities interested in axxo wouldn't it be funny if one of these wannabees
got busted for being axxo"
,madtown4,2010-01-04T21:43Z,"lol !!! ok this is a axxo torrent, and im superman !! "
,falconxx,2010-01-04T22:30Z,"@madtown4

Dude Read the Description Carefully!!! It says an aXXo Wannabe Not the Original aXXo"
,mike17x,2010-01-05T02:01Z,unless he really is superman i detect a bit of sarcasm so falcon you may be an idiot
[V],pluto999,2010-01-05T19:20Z,@falconxx:Don't mislabel torrent..aXXo is history man!!
,snow7269,2010-01-05T20:32Z,"thanks for the info aelfred. But the problem that I am having is that I have downloaded about 40 movies but some client or whoever keeps warning my isp of a torrent that they have detected on my computer and for that reason my isp keeps shutting me down. But I dont understand how one or two movies get detected but the rest of them doesnt. So if you or abybodyelse have any suggestions please fill me in because I am kind of new at this. I love downloading movies but I dont want to jeopardize myself in any way. And by the way, I am in the US."
,clyde4210,2010-01-06T00:28Z,"Snow not much you can do. QWe don't know what client you're using so can't really tell you how to block some IP's from your peers and seed list. Your best bet is to stop downloading for awhile.

Look around for IP.dat if you're using Utorrent. Look for something similar for other clients. Check out peer guardian. Not much you can do. "
,falconxx,2010-01-06T02:46Z,@pluto999 I didn't label the torrent..when i downloaded it from the private tracker it was labeled it this way...
,demelvinvil,2010-01-09T07:40Z,thnx man... pls ignore those ignorant

thanks dude ... :)"
,potat03,2010-01-17T03:12Z,using the name of aXXo like that just aint cool. but atleast it isnt as bad as KLAXXON's shit.

,himangsh,2010-01-20T19:30Z,"dude, if you are confident in your work then why did you use the aXXo name ?"
,deathscout,2010-01-21T05:06Z,Snow on top of what everyone else suggested just take the time to find a copy of whatever movie your looking for then check the comments if theirs no comments don't DL it. I've dodged a few files because people flat out stated in the comments they got pegged downloading that file.
,rasungod0,2010-01-21T20:42Z,"just a pathetic attempt at attention by a low quality uploader, falconxx you suck!"
,JimmyTheKid,2010-01-23T13:22Z,If your isp is blocking PirateBay you can go to a friends or an internet cafe and find the torrents u want - then email the torrent files to yourself at home and then open them with bittorrent(what I use others may work too) and your torrents should download:)
,skinny_dj,2010-01-25T15:31Z,"this is not a DvDrip. Shame u loader coz u used aXXo name. Movie is watchable. A/V - 7+

Believe me this is not a DvDrip. So theres no 10/10 for A/V"
,LocoViking,2010-01-26T00:24Z,"hey snow, it`s probably just Warner Bros. that has targeted you as their next law suit. That`s why they follow the file to your ip. JK man. There might be restrictions on the torrent...password."
,Rang3r187,2010-01-26T08:11Z,"My god. Some of you people are not too smart. If you email the torrent link to yourself, how is that NOT going to get you nailed when you will be running if off your computer? ROFL. You do know they track the torrents by IP. ROFLCOPTER.....

If you don't want to get tracked it's simple (and some already hit most of it)..

1. Don't download ANY cam/TS/scr's that are for a new movie. Wait until the torrent is a DVDSCR/DVDrip/DVD/R5 and 90% of the time you won't have any issue in the world.

How do I know? I've downloaded every Top 100 movie via: http://thepiratebay.org/top/201

For about 5 years and gotten 0 cease and desist/dmca letters. 

You can also just pay for newsgroup access , or demonoid. ;)"
,V5Spectre,2010-01-27T05:54Z,"aXXo is retired, fuck this poser for using his glorious name."
,nziced,2010-01-27T09:57Z,"aXXO is just a young boy. And he still rips, hes on darkng or whatever that site is, its just a forum though, shit layout so not worth visiting for average rips"
,e-asy11,2010-01-28T17:54Z,"OK, don't write 10/10 when it's not!!!

Actual quality:
V: 4/10 (1 being cam, 10 being flawless)
A: 5/10

I don't mind people posting crappy quality, just don't say 10/10 when it's not, please. Thank you for understanding."

If he ever comebacks he gonna need to up his rips quality a shit ton to compete with HD rippers like SAMNhaNc3, HolyRoses..."
,RickFrenzy,2010-02-01T06:26Z,Can one of you legends set this up in the DVDR section. Been waiting on this one. Thx mate
,somedude.1001,2010-02-01T06:29Z,"@Morfinel: piss off! I wasnt talking about this fake aXXo. The original aXXo only had low quality 700MB rips, that was the point.

Learn to read before calling someone noob, moron."
,rancidguy,2010-02-01T13:15Z,If you are worried about getting notices from your ISP in Utorrent: Options->Preferences->BitTorrent. Uncheck 'Allow Incoming Legacy Connections' and under protocol encryption use the drop-down menu & select 'Forced' for Outgoing. Wa-lah

,sentient1,2010-02-05T03:00Z,"@nziced

The REAL aXXo is in fact retired.  Or at least not using the alias. 

He is from South America, and is no Child.  A friend of mine is friends with him.

Leave his name alone you fucking biters.

Earn your own Legacy."
