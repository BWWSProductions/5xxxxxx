This is the source code of the search feature currently used by the Open Directory Project, aka dmoz.org, written in C. They used to provide a direct link for the folder containing all the files but now it's broken, however I managed to grab the tarball from eDonkey. So if you want it, you can get it, it's under the Mozilla Public License. And... read the README.

The torrent also includes SHA1 and ed2k hashes, so even if there's no seeds you may use it with MLDonkey or Shareaza (not the fake version which is merely an imesh and bearshare clone, refer to the Wikipedia article on this P2P app) and find sources on other P2P networks.
