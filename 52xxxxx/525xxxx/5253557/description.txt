The Beatles: The First U.S. Visit is an archive footage documentary of the Beatles' first visit to America in February of 1964. It was filmed by renowned documentary filmmaking team Albert and David Maysles, using footage from their 1964 16mm documentary What's Happening! The Beatles In The USA, and documents the Beatles' U.S. trip as they travel to New York City, Washington, D.C., and Miami Beach. Footage of the Beatles (often acting irreverently in front of the camera) in hotel rooms makes up the majority of the non-musical portion of the film. The other portion of the film is the Fab Four's live recorded performances on The Ed Sullivan Show, which were not included in the original 1964 release. Everything is shown in chronological order.
