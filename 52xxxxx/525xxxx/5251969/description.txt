VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
SPECIAL EDITION
SEASON 4 VOLUME 2 DVD 2

The Seaview first sailed across American TV screens on September 14, 1964.

Now, 45 years later, TooleMan TV presents the final 13 episodes of Irwin Allen's Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.

All episodes have been remastered by TooleMan TV from excellent broadcast recordings for the best video and audio.

These are FULL RESOLUTION REGION-FREE NTSC DVD's.

We've all waited impatiently while a certain video company stuck in the previous century put off the release of the final season of Voyage. And we've waited some more for them to release the second half of season four.

Well... THE WAITING IS OVER!

Included:

- ABC-TV's "In Color" opener before each episode
- full-length episodes of the second half of season four
- uncut season four opening theme including "brought to you by..."
- previews of the next episode

DVD 2 contains these fantastic uncut episodes in brilliant color not seen in the US since the shows first aired in 1968:

Episode 17: Nightmare (Airdate: January 28, 1968)
Episode 18: The Abominable Snowman (Airdate: February 4, 1968)

Enjoy, share, and NEVER SELL these disks!
