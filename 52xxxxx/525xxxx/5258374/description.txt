Bored to Death is an American comedy television series, which premiered in the United States on HBO on September 20, 2009. Created by Jonathan Ames, the series follows a writer, named Jonathan Ames, based in Brooklyn who moonlights as an unlicensed private detective. Advertisements have described Bored to Death as a "Noir-otic comedy". It airs Sundays at 9:30pm EST.

Although it is loosely based in Carroll Gardens, the series is shot primarily on location in the nearby neighborhood of Fort Greene.

HBO has renewed the comedy for a second season. The pickup came days after the show saw a ratings high of 1.1 million on Sunday, when it followed Curb Your Enthusiasm's Seinfeld reunion episode. Since its Sept. 20 debut, Bored to Death's pilot has been seen by 4.1 million viewers with repeats factored in.
