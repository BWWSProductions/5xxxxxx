,theoangelo,2010-12-12T00:54Z,"WTF, next time you do this try to put the credits in, i mean, at least have the decency to give the credit that the people who work in this shit deserve. and also as all the episodes en with music it's almost as that you took parts of the ending, ya with me?    "

,Dragonite_9,2011-06-01T00:50Z,"@theoangelo

Do you mean the end credits are gone, and you want that?

Or do you mean the names of the .avi files, credit to those who created the .avi file? (e.g. LOL, FQM)

The file name I agree that I want to know the original names, for subtitle purpose just, otherwise great that episode names show, love that!
For END CREDITS, I do not mind most of the time, sometimes it would be great to see a special guest star who you want the name of or so, if not listed in beginning, but that vs. the saved space is imo better to cut end credit of, since you easy can look it up on the webb!


@crakhed32 and N3tw0rkbomb3r

Haha, yepp, so true! Sometimes I can not believe what people have the nerve to write to them (us) who up load stuff!! Incredible what morons there is out there who are really mean and behave like fucking idiots with rude nonsense commentary's or complaints about the up load, or up loader! Makes me sick these people, have the nerve to complaint about what we up loaders do FOR FREE for them so they can download it FOR FREE, and yet we just get shit and fucking retarded personal verbal attacks !!!
(Great example, just look at my torrents, for example, Men in Black...).

Take care! (And thx proxyjon for the effort done of up loading something!) "
,kootenay67,2011-08-25T03:16Z,Thanks Proxyjon and seeders for the upload

,cartman19987,2011-09-30T15:48Z,"Well, it is pointless to cut the credits out for what, a few megabytes? But I still greatly appreciate the upload."

,spifkitten99,2012-02-23T18:14Z,"Dragonite_9, get over yourself.

Nobody gives cares that you apparently think a little to highly of yourself.

When a crappy job has been done, you will be told. Deal with it, or stop uploading.

1 - The filenaming in this torrent is dumb. It should be for example s01e01, for season 1 episode 1.

2 - I didn't download this one, because cutting out the credits is retarded. Not because I give a shit about them, but because It's incomplete without them. Why the hell would anyone cut them out? The size is certainly not an issue.

The uploader (or whoever created it) needs to learn, and then do it properly. Don't come with invalid arguments about how it's free. That's irrelevant. Whoever made it, made it with the intention to share it with people. Well, then make it in the way, so people will like it, by doing it properly. Otherwise there is no point."
