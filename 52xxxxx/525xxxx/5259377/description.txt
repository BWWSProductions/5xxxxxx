This entertaining sci-fi comedy series is written by one of Canada's 
best-loved comedy writers, Matt Watts. It is the year 2056. The 
United States has launched an armada to destroy an alien threat. 
Canada sends the nation's only publicly-funded spacecraft, The 
Canadia - a ship with a single purpose - to plunge the Americans' 
toilets.

----

Episode 01:

Max Anderson is the first American ever to be stationed on the 
Canadia. He was put there by the American admiral (his mother) to 
toughen him up but keep him out of any real danger. The only thing 
that Max and the crew of the Canadia agree on is that no one wants 
him there.

Episode 02:

The Captain is convinced that there is a saboteur on board his ship 
and Anderson plots his escape.

Episode 03:

There has been a nuclear spill on a ship in the American fleet. The 
Captain feels that the "spill" is the Canadia's jurisdiction (they 
do clean up spills). A battle of wills begins when the American 
elite nuclear cleanup crew arrives to do the cleanup. Meanwhile, 
Anderson does his best to be useful and new security measures are 
implemented on the ship.

Episode 04:

The Fleet answers a distress call from an alien ship. Faverau tries 
to figure out what the Canadia can do to help the aliens. Anderson 
and Skip get to know each other a little better but the Captain has 
a problem with their relationship.

Episode 05:

The Captain and Anderson are away from the ship when disaster 
strikes. There is a fluctuation in the engine core that threatens 
to destroy the ship. The crew has to resort to alternative methods 
of travel aboard the ship.

Episode 06:

Anderson pines for Connie his first love. The crew loses the 
ability to navigate the ship when they are controlled by a cloud. 
The up side is that the cloud grants them wishes, the down side is 
that the cloud grants them wishes.

Episode 07:

The Canadia receives word that their budget is being cut and the 
Captain has to decide what to trim. Doc Gaffney isn't happy with 
his decision and takes drastic action.

Episode 08:

Romance is in the air on the Canadia. Lewis finds something big in 
a pile of trash. The Captain invites the Captain of the USS Pickens 
over to the Canadia in order to present him with a gift. Anderson 
discovers a hidden talent and the computer explores her jealous side.

Episode 09:

The Captain takes drastic action when his relationship with the 
computer goes too far. Faverau gets a promotion.
Anderson and Lewis try to modify the robot. The captain uncovers 
the real reason the Americans declared war on the Ipampilashians. 
As they approach the end of the mission, the relationships between 
the crewmembers intensify.

Episode 10 Season Finale:

An illegal upload adversely affects the computer. The Canadia 
finally reaches the planet Ipampilash, but Faverau and Pickens 
can't agree on what to do. Anderson and Lewis take matters into 
their own hands when the Captain is unable to answer the call of 
duty. Faverau comes across a Canadian on board the USS Pickens and 
brings them back to the Canadia.
