,elenfoiro,2010-02-23T17:56Z,"Works fine for windows, also works fine on an old osx version but cannot get it to work properly on snow leopard 10.6.2"
,elenfoiro,2010-02-23T17:57Z,And when I say can't get it to work properly I mean vent won't even start. Not a matter of connecting to the server.
,Andreasvb,2010-03-20T11:58Z,"elenfoiro: You may need to make the file executable.

Read the NFO, then do this in Terminal:

~ Andreas$ cd /Applications/Ventrilo.app/
Ventrilo.app Andreas$ cd Contents/
Contents Andreas$ cd MacOS/
MacOS Andreas$ ls -al
-rw-r--r--@ 1 Andreas  staff  1924460 20 Mar 10:54 Ventrilo
MacOS Andreas$ chmod +x Ventrilo 
MacOS Andreas$ ls -al
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 Andreas  staff  1924460 20 Mar 10:54 Ventrilo

Then it will start. :)"

mangler.org for more info."
,Minibrutalt,2010-10-25T12:06Z,"Ok, so i instal it etc etc and all is successful, however, other people cant login, why?"
,nkhaim,2011-02-27T02:55Z,waste of time imo because only users with cracked versions of ventrilo client can connect to your server.
,Werepire,2011-08-17T17:54Z,"where is the ventrilo_srv.ini file! and where do you put the ventrilo_srv.exe, im really stuck plz help me."
