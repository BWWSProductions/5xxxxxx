,mikexxxryan,2010-01-01T05:42Z,"Fake.  Uploader has no history.  This is his first upload ever and it is currently in theaters?  Don't be stupid.  Also, look at the size 425meg?  Minimum would be 700 megs.  AVOID.  FAKE."
,AndromedaB,2010-01-01T07:08Z,"mike you are a firggn noob

,AndromedaB,2010-01-01T07:09Z,and as i said the resolution is VERY SMALL can you read you iliterate dumbass 
,rob29evansville,2010-01-01T14:06Z,"I appreciate your time and thanks for the upload. these are typical assholes that want to copmplain about Something FREE. Oh, and andromeda, for those of us that are literate, you Misspelled Illiterate, lol"
,221b,2010-01-01T14:52Z,"Yup, definitely real, but IMO this is a movie that you should wait for a better quality upload of.  Small means it's a fast download, however, so if you're just planning on putting it on an mp3 player or something, this could suffice.  Also, if I'm remembering what I saw in theatre properly, this is missing the last few minutes--an entire scene between Holmes and Watson when H gets his next case, no?"
,curtisj,2010-01-01T16:31Z,dont evan waste time you wont see anything v-1

,devilsditchdigger,2010-01-04T21:25Z,demonoid now allows 5 downloads a week without membership 
,lordhades,2010-01-05T03:09Z,"I think its unfair for some guys to blame the uploader for his extra effort at getting u the movie for free!!! Instead of just leeching like so many of us,who never even seed for a day after DL completes!!! But i'd prefer if the uploader also rates the audio/video (a/v) quality, specially if its cam... Anyways tnx for the sharing, and dont forget"
