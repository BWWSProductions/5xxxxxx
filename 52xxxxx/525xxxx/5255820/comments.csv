,thepartycrasher,2010-03-01T04:05Z,"Thank you. I like that song ""the best around"" I've never actually seen the movie, but the song was in It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia and always makes me laugh because I picture the guys beating up Charlie with boards and chairs! lol

This song was actually really hard to find, since NOBODY seemed to know who it was or what it was called--even KGB or my Shazam program! :o

Thanks for this one...maybe I'll check out the movie one of these days."
,hootieman,2010-06-29T07:21Z,WOW haven't actually seen the movie..
,MulliganM,2011-01-09T06:11Z,"The movie at first look seemed kiddish but begin a Jackie Chan fan I wanted see it. After viewing it, I would sit and watch it again I really liked this move the first karate kid was touching but this one has it's own feel of begin a new movie.

I have been looking for this for so long...i just wanted to say THANK YOU!

Brings back a lot of childhood memories.
All the pop songs were easy to find, but the panflut music was something i had been searching for since i was 5 years old and this movie came out....it just always touched my heart and soul.
Thank you so very much for sharing this with the world. "
