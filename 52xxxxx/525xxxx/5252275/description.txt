An example of a a knife made from pattern welded steel.
Creation of a forge welded billet using tradational wire wrapped wet weld in a coal forge and hand hammered. 

"A no-nonsense, doable approach to pattern welding and knife making.  All techniques learned can be easily duplicated in any blacksmiths shop.  Forty education packed minutes, with no time wasted on useless filler!
