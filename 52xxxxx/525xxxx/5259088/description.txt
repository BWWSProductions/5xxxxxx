RaÃºl Alejandro Escajadillo PeÃ±a (born September 29, 1969 in MÃ©rida, YucatÃ¡n, Mexico), better known as Aleks Syntek, is a Mexican singer, songwriter and producer. He is married to Karen Coronado, sister of talkshow host Ingrid Coronado.

From an early age he began to show his musical talent, and at the age of 11 he began composing his own music and lyrics. It was not until 1984 that his interest in music turned professional, and he assumed the stage name Aleks Syntek, ("Syntek" being a shorthand name for "sin teclados", lit. "without keyboards;" the name was given by a friend from whom he had asked to borrow a keyboard.)

In 1989, he composed the songs "MuÃ©vete a mi alrededor" ("Move in my surroundings") and "SiÃ©nteme" ("Feel Me") sung by Mexican artist Sasha Sokol.

On Mexican pop trio Pandora's album, "999 Razones", he wrote "Invisible" and "Â¿Por quÃ© seguir?" with Alex Zepeda.

In 1990, he wrote "SacÃºdete" ("Shake Yourself") and "Escapar de ti" ("Escape From You") included on pop group Timbiriche's album "10". The same year he formed a group called Aleks Syntek y la Gente Normal. His first album, "Hey tÃº!" ("Hey You!"), included the single "Unos quieren subir" ("Some want to rise"), as well as "Te quiero asÃ­" ("I Love You Like That") sung with Sasha Sokol.

As of 2008, he is working on a crossover album for the English-speaking market. The album will consist of English versions of his past Spanish hits, such as "Duele El Amor" (Love Hurts) and "Intocable" (Untouchable).

In 2008, Aleks collaborated on song "AquÃ­ Estoy Yo" with singers Luis Fonsi, David Bisbal and Noel Schajris, a song included on Latin Grammy Award-nominated album Palabras del Silencio by Luis Fonsi.

In August 30, 2009 he released a new single titled "Loca" also used as the main-theme for telenovela Los Exitosos PÃ©rez.
