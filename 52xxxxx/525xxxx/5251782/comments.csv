,GlassWolf,2011-08-24T03:45Z,"sadly, the cue files are hosed, and I can't find the problem to get these to write to CD.
I keep getting errors in both nero and Brrrn of:
"" isn't an integer

If I just drag the tracks to Brrrn and try, I get an error that the software can't find the end of the track.

oddly, the songs play fine one by one in WMP"
