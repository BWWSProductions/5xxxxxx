,arnoldtejones,2010-03-09T07:51Z,"I downloaded and tried this. It seems to me that this is a censored version. can anyone else confirm this? 

If you guys have a torrent link for the uncensored one please share it.

Many thanks"
,arnoldtejones,2010-03-09T07:53Z,Btw. this is a multi- Language installer but when I tried killing soldiers when the prince arrived in his kingdom I cant slice bodies in half or cut their heads off.. 
,ilmater17,2010-03-16T11:24Z,I found trojan Exploit.Win32.Lamebrk.d in autorun.exe so... it's not good.
,bessa577,2010-03-18T00:08Z,"It works fine until the end of the introduction video, then when itÂ´s to start plaing my pc restarts does anyone have the same problem??? plese help!!!"
,Desolator4u,2010-04-02T05:08Z,"Big ass iso. Hoping this is the uncensored version. I won't be able to get this until some time in May. Someone should tell us if it's censored or not by then, right? :|"
,dubistjac,2010-04-10T12:27Z,Kasperky found trojen in autorun and pop3.exe you motherfucker bitch. Fuck your mother by trojan. Fucking virus producers. If u download this iso file your credit card info and other infos will be stealed by big motherfuckers.
,SullySadface,2010-05-22T22:35Z,"@dubistjac:

Retard. I have no credit card, no ID, no SSN. This is a nearly fresh install of windows 7. If I do anything online, I do it in a separate partition of my computer that NTFS can't even detect as a hard drive. So you're stupid. Your parents are probably stupid. You will doubtlessly be stupid and end up having stupid kids. "
,Esmad3,2010-05-26T16:26Z,http://content.gucca.dk/spil-covers/store/prince-of-persia-3-the-two-thrones_49854.jpg  Is there any enthusiasts out there who can tell by this cover wether it is the uncensored version or not? I'm thinking off buying it and making a torrent out if it myself
,lilpav,2010-05-26T19:06Z,hahahah! 159 Seeders!? Fuckin' Nice! I'll Seed Aswell :) 
,xxxblucoxxx,2010-05-28T10:47Z,what is the Disc key? i canÂ´t find it anywhere in the files 
,xxxblucoxxx,2010-05-28T10:50Z,Could someone plz tell me what the disc key is ?
,DaGleese,2010-06-03T04:11Z,"in agreement with 2 people above, this definitly has some wierd shit going on, my antivirus didnt pick anything up, but after install upon trying to run the game the game prompts you to restart, after that windows could not start until i had run through windows repair...

and when i got back into windows all the executable files for the game had been deleted by windows repair :-/"
,Xirapte,2010-06-06T07:04Z,Censored version. Regardless it works and is very fun to play. Thanks for this muryucu.
,DeadPast,2010-06-07T01:07Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS PIECE OF SHIT MADE ME REFORMAT MY PC!!! FUCKS UP YOUR PC ON WINDOWS 7 ULTIMATE 64BIT ON REBOOT!! UNFIXABLE UNLESS YOU REFORMAT!
,altrego99,2010-06-22T16:35Z,Has anyone got it working on Windows 7 x64?
,Shanski77,2010-06-28T08:35Z,cant even play without cd key? i see many comments on this and no help. cant use generic cd key cos it checks with disc also
,Yenrock7,2010-09-03T09:33Z,Why is this 4.16GB? While the others are only 1.6GB? I've downloaded the 1.6GB ones but the graphics isn't that convincing. It's very bad even when set on Maximum.
,RecycleBin32,2010-10-23T19:57Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5884030

,Ganix565,2011-02-21T23:35Z,This didn't work for me. I also got a trojan and it fucked up my computer. I wouldn't trust this guy.
,bb_bulldog,2011-03-08T20:16Z,im downloading  Is this working ;) ?
,norbi96,2011-03-12T20:55Z,thx for upload!!!
,SirEpicWin,2011-04-22T22:17Z,"Don't download this if you have windows 7 x64.Windows will never start. 
I had to format my pc because of this."
,-Enzup-,2011-05-04T21:45Z,"Is this a ""Setup"" or ""Installed Game""

And if anyone has completed this game then plz tell me that the game is having ""Alternate Ending"" or NOT ?"
,elcoolio,2011-07-09T10:00Z,"it works,however i had problems with the controller,the analogue stick for movement caused the prince character to continue walking even after input was finished,fix=redfine movement to the Dpad,also the screen lights up in red if antaliasing is 4x and lights up in gold in 2x,fix=turn this option off,also its important to put crack in before running game to disable starforce from crashing your system,another bug is the windows media player that comes on when you quit game,fix=no fix you have to grin and bare it"
,jurjeskovici,2011-07-12T12:59Z,Download it if you want the game! the guys  that complain have a shitty pc!
,abhi24,2011-07-31T17:30Z,"I too have same problem. Prince making an extra haphazard turn at the press of the key. And windows media centre opening up once i exit the game. Anyone knows how to fix these??
And those talking of shitty pc, i have other games working smoothly even at max graphic settings. (eg pop sot,pop ww, cod4, battlefield bad company 2)"
,abhi24,2011-08-19T13:51Z,"Okay, here is what i faced as the problem
Prince rotating absurdly, problem first appears in stage 5 (ie the palace), problem increases from a mere nuissance to make the game almost unplayable by stage 8 (ie the ruined palace). Brace the bug for anther four levels, and from stage 12 onwards (ie the fortress), game works perfectly. 
"
,hancock86,2011-10-15T08:15Z,Game really fucks dont download dis friends
,Godpk11,2011-10-15T22:57Z,"Alright, they're several bugs in certain stages which make the game completely unplayable and difficult to complete. Anyways, thanks for upload. Fun while it lasted :)"
,darkgeo1,2011-11-01T17:09Z,it works on xP :P
,nonsolu,2011-11-24T06:09Z,Yeah this torrent is not clean. Comes with a StarProtection or some shit that writes to the system directory. Pretty much the definition of a virus right there.
,ssspikas,2011-12-04T23:33Z,1mb/s :)
,Maero1234,2012-01-15T13:02Z,TNX very MUCH
,tmfdbx,2012-01-28T15:31Z,THX BRO!
,dundun12,2012-03-24T02:53Z,"This game is a bit of a virus. Just like SirEpicWin stated you WILL have to format your computer if you have Windows 7 64 bit, and it does come with some type of star protection program. This is a security feature. Pirating IS illegal and it's meant to track the IP-adress down. Just don't download this."
,LightSystem97,2012-04-07T00:10Z,Does this game works on Windows 7 64 bit?
,ansarim,2012-05-02T08:37Z,"does this game have the videos in it... im talking about the story videos and stuff! :D

,ansarim,2012-05-02T15:03Z,works awsum! best quality and graphics.. no errors! thnx!
,ansarim,2012-05-02T15:05Z,"@arnoldtejones 
you can only cut their heads of or slice them after wazir becomes immortal and makes all the soldiers turn into sand monsters! :)"
,dreco4,2012-05-26T20:39Z,How can i get the serial key?
