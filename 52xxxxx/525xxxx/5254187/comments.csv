,gmdb55,2010-05-21T17:09Z,"Thanks for the patches, but what are they for? I used to play this game perfectly on Windows xp but now I have Windows 7 and the game crashes at the start of the first mission. Will these patches fix the problem?"
,Jabwater,2010-05-25T23:26Z,"try right clicking on the application and run as administrator.
 the patches are necessary for online play. although they were released before windows 7 came out so there wouldn't be any 7 fix. i play FFOW on 7 and i have to run as admin. 
many people have that problem. XP was always the best for this game.
 try turning of unnecessary services that & always has running for no reason and lighten the CPU load."

p.s. make sure you select LAN in menu and brows for a server not the internet!!"
