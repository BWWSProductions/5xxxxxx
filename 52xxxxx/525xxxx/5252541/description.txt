The Process of Belief is an album by the punk rock band Bad Religion, released in 2002. It marks the band's first album released on Epitaph Records since 1993's Recipe for Hate (although that label released the All Ages compilation) and to feature original guitarist Brett Gurewitz since 1994's Stranger Than Fiction. It was also the first Bad Religion album to feature new drummer Brooks Wackerman, replacing Bobby Schayer who suffered a severe shoulder injury which left him unable to drum professionally.

This album sold very well because of the success of its lead single "Sorrow", the band's first to chart in the US in over five years, since "A Walk" (from 1996's The Gray Race). The Process of Belief included three more singles, "Broken", "The Defense" and "Supersonic", but all failed to make any national chart (although "Broken" reached #125 on the UK Singles Chart).
