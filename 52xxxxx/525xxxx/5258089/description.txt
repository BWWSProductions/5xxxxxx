After the release of Welcome To The World, Adrian went to help on two albums and two tours with Bruce Dickinson which were both highly successful. After this, both Adrian and Bruce re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999 and Adrian split up Psycho Motel. When asked if he would consider re-forming the band in 2001, he said that they had "no plans at the moment" but they would "possibly do some stuff next year". This has yet to happen with his continued success with Iron Maiden.
