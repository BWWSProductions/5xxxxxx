The 24th Sasuke Tournament; also known around the world (aka, outside of Japan) as Ninja Warrior.

The quality is a bit poor, but that's what happens when the show is streamed from Japan through the TV. Don't worry, it's still more than enough to enjoy the show. Usually, a better quality file is found later and will be distributed at that time. It is a total of 6 hours long though... so prepare yourself.
