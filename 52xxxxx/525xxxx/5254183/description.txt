I have listened to these files all the way through, and the quality is pretty good. However, if you have any issues, please, leave a comment and I'll try to fix them.

In all the currently available torrents of "Zoe's Tale," I've found a couple of the files half-way through the book are corrupted. I found this version on Rapid Share that has the files in tact. It's divided into 5 .rars that when decompressed give you 2 Mp3 files (~3 and ~6 hours, respectively).

I've included a folder that has both parts broken up into ~30 minute blocks for easier bookmarking.


As always, PLEASE SEED.
