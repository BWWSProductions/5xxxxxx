My personal opinion of this CD is that its typical of the saccharine-sweet junk promoted by Classic FM. It is supposed to be a "modern approach to the style of ancient chants", but seemingly Goodall has no understanding of traditional chant. Overall, its not a bad sound, I suppose, but it really is not chant.

However, snobbery aside, THIS IS ACTUALLY AN EXTREMELY POPULAR CD, and I notice that there is as yet no torrent available. So, erm, enjoy! :)
