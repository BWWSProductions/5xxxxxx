Unless someone wants me to put up individual ones, in case they don't want to download that huge pack. As with the last one, I'll be seeding whenever I have Azureus open (AKA ""a lot"")."
,Melodicanth,2010-01-06T02:20Z,"...I love you. I've been looking for Kaito and Luka EVERYWHERE (On the safe torrent sites, that is.).

I'll download and seed. Same for when Luka and probably Meiko arrive.

*bliss*"
,DannyWolf,2010-01-06T09:19Z,"...thanks? And you're welcome ^^

Well, Meiko is up now, but Luka's giving me some serious issues... It should be ready tomorrow... If not, I'm going to kill something :/"
