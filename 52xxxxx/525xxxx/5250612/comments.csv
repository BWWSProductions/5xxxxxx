,burningrabbit,2010-01-12T19:43Z,Because I will beat you senseless....You have been warned. Class dismissed. You: go get a late pass.
,ricoeur,2010-03-28T13:04Z,"there are no problems with this torrent, it was taken from tv and it's the real thing. Enjoy it!"
,ns194,2011-01-14T21:23Z,"@GIOVANI1 First of all, this is not ""fake."" You just found that stupid image somewhere and wanted to post it on a torrent. 

To everyone else, the quality isn't exactly great, but it's watchable... I just wonder why the uploader didn't bother to cut the TV introduction - a mere 30 seconds of annoying preamble before the film. Apart from that, thanks!"
