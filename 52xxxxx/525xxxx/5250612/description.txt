The Romanian Wave continues with the release of Stuff and Dough, the debut feature by Cristi Puiu, critically acclaimed director of The Death of Mr. Lazarescu. Combining genres (the road movie, the buddy movie, the slacker story), he takes us in a rattle-trap van with a naÃ¯ve young man, his pal and the pal's girlfriend en route to Bucharest to deliver a mysterious parcel for a local gangster.

Their conversation and the action veers from the mundane and the idiotic to the sinister and the bizzare. Puiu's sense of humor is never far from the surface, but neither is his notion that Romania is a land of serious contradictions, corruption, foolishness and brutality. â€” Film Forum, New Yorkâ€™s leading movie house for independent premieres and international art films since 1970.
