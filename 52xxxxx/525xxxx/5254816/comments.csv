,Pinty22,2010-05-02T19:20Z,NO fucking seed!!! 
,Shares,2010-06-06T18:52Z,Seems the last 0.2% doesn't exist anymore. Fortunatly most of it works fine without it (note most!). I've been uploading the 99.8% there is for several months now and will keep doing so(though it propably will be inconsistent).
