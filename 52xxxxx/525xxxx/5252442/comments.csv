,piman314,2011-11-14T02:47Z,"What the heck is this?

Windows 95 is missing (not installed on the VMware disk).

Windows 3.1 just boots to the DOS prompt.  Maybe someone can correct me on this, but this doesn't seem right.

None of these, with the exception of Mac OSX, is compressed!  Easy compression with 7-Zip would save many gigabytes."
,t2BeDLaM,2012-01-21T09:41Z,"for the ""morons"" who put ""rar'd, forget it. Get a fucking life! I been ""warez'n"" the scene since before the internet came out back when we had BBS's and used to ""phreak"" our phone calls to systems. So learn how to use the Tools to do this properly or get the hell out of the scene. We ""rar"" or ""zip"" stuff so it ""shrinks"" the size to make the downloads come faster.  God I get so tired of hearing these lame asses complain. 
 To the uploader, thanks, good upload. Also thanks for your time to make this avaiable for others."
,pontoon,2012-02-15T18:27Z,Thank you very much. It's great.
