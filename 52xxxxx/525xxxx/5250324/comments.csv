Thank you for your work in posting these torrents. As I live outside of the USA I very much appreciate these.
May All of you have a very safe, happy and prosperous New Years - May 2010 bless you.

Also, a prayer for Rush in hopes of his speedy recovery - We, and the USA, need him.

Bless You All."

,lewispatin,2010-01-01T06:53Z,there are one hell of a lot of maggots that hang around these uploads. looks like they could spend their time instead trying to get their iq above fifty. thanks jwhitt62 for all you do to get rush out to those of us without usa radio.

Have to agree with Tainan - prayers for Rush in hopes of a speedy and complete recovery. 

Happy New Year to fellow Rush fans! :)"
