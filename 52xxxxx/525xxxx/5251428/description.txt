Better File Rename is the preferred renaming tool of many professional and ambitious amateur photographers and has over time grown an impressive array of features dedicated to manipulating sequence numbers (create sequence number lists, add and insert sequence numbers, pad them with 0s, etc..) and adding shooting dates & times to picture names.
