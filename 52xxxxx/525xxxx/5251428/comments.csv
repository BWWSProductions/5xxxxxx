What are you talking about?  What else is there?  Are them damned ferners infiltrating our Internet, again?

Honey!  Call the Orkin guy!  We got ferners on the Internet, again!"
,neuroxik,2010-04-01T22:41Z,"@HungerIM : Actually, the key must remain intact. Check the registry and when you install the app it creates a ""ISM SĂ rl"" entry, WITH the special character. Replacing it (in the .reg file to execute) just creates another entry as ""ISM Sarl"" and the program doesn't refer to that, making it useless. Therefore (for others), just leave the .reg file intact if you want it to work."
