The nutty yet thoughtful Israeli social satire Te'alat Blaumilch (AKA Big Dig) concerns Blaumilch (Bomba Zur), a deranged resident of a mental institution who escapes from the psycho ward, makes a beeline for downtown Tel Aviv, and steals a large pneumatic drill. He then uses the equipment to do serious damage to an urban plaza, tearing a strip right down the middle of a central road and toward the sea. When the ditch hits the ocean, it fills up with water and government personnel mistakenly believe that the series of actions has been authorized by the state - ignoring the protests of people who indicate otherwise.
