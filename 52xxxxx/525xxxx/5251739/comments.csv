,oggologgo,2010-01-01T23:04Z,Thank you. Perfect torrent.
,Doctor_Horror,2010-01-01T23:19Z,"Hey thanks for the nice download,I just want to say good bye to David you will be missed,I would also like to say good luck to Matt Smith to be honest you are kind of hard to look at as the new Doctor,Karen Gillan will be nice to look at as the new companion .Its like the new show is going to be about Rocky Dennis and his hot blind girlfriend.All jokes aside I love this show and I always will.Now I am going to smoke my bong ....be good."
,tiger2000,2010-01-02T00:41Z,"@sharaz

Hi gayboy hope you enjoyed the show. Hopefully Moffett will keep the Left Wing Agenda to counterbalance Rigt Wing nut jobs like you."
,darkkrisse81,2010-01-02T00:44Z,"thnx much for upload!!
@sharaz you disgust me. that is all kthnxbye."
,QJo,2010-01-02T01:38Z,"Moffatt will probably not be promoting any ""agenda"" other than that of a quality-driven, talented, and dedicated Sci-Fi writer who has written some of the absolute best episodes of the current series. Let's just keep our fingers crossed that he'll be up to the task of doing it consistently. I have a feeling that we will all be in better hands now.

sharaz_jek does present some valid points about the gay agenda and I will also not be saddened to see it go the fuck away. Yes you're here and you're queer, but I for one do not need to be reminded of it so often when all I'm looking for is a quality science fiction escape clause from all the real world agendas.

Thank you Mr. Davies for reviving an excellent program from SF history. Now take your agenda and go away."
,eddboy876,2010-01-02T02:07Z,"Awesome upload, thanks."
,eddboy876,2010-01-02T02:10Z,"@Sharaz:

Dude, quit getting mad on the internet and accept the fact that homosexuality is becoming more frequent.

Stop being an idiot, and get with the times."
,disastercat,2010-01-02T03:08Z,"Thank you for uploading so fast so people in US can watch the same day that it comes out.

@sharaz jek-
i started an account just to tell you to fuck off. comments sections for torrents are generally about the torrent, not some piece of shit going off about his/her personal politics. if you want to protest an opinion that you dont agree with, try being constructive and informed about an actual issue. get with the times, people dont have to ignorant fuckwads to each other."
,Noble92,2010-01-02T07:06Z,thanks for the upload downloading it now been waiting for this and then again haven't because i don't want it to be over just yet but it has been a good doctor who run and all good things sadly come to an end so something just as good or better can take its place.
,cominagetcha,2010-01-02T07:08Z,"sharaz_jek we really don't care you take it up the arse, yet feel terrible about it because your Daddy beat the crap out of you because of his own homophobia.  Queer As Folk was about Gays - whoda guess!!  As the poster in the UK says ""There are gay people in the world (just like you sharaz_jek) get over it"""
,Bella35,2010-01-02T07:32Z,"Thanks so much for the upload!

@sharaz_jek - Wow could you be more of a fuckwit! I'm embarassed that we like the same show. I mean how stupid are you? Maybe you need to take a ride in the tardis back to the dark ages ..except thats right since absolutely no Doctor would take a right wing nut job like you that just wouldn't be possible. Idiot Idiot Idiot. "
,docbill,2010-01-02T09:31Z,"The resolution is a bit low, but is a good copy."
,Doctor_Horror,2010-01-02T10:24Z,"First of all, The Doctor Who show never had an episode with Captain Jack getting it on with a guy, that was a show called Torchwood and that show was for adults and had lots of sex of all kinds in it and by the way I miss Torchwood very much.I myself am not a gay man and I dont give a crap who is gay or not ,The fact is that Captain Jack has sex with anything that moves is what makes him an all around cool guy,and I know that John Barrowman is a gay man and I dont give a crap ,he is a cool dude in my book no matter who he bangs,its his life.GOD its 2010 and  the KKK is still around,that stinks.Grow up man nobody likes a gay basher or a basher of anykind , it just make you look ugly. Im going to smoke my bong....be good."
,Doctor_Horror,2010-01-02T10:38Z,sharaz_jek sounds like you were raped by a male gorilla as a child.
,funzone1970,2010-01-02T15:18Z,"@sharaz: dude, when your doctor prescribes medicines, you're supposed to take them consistently.

@QJo: ""gay agenda"" lol.  Can't imagine anyone actually saw anything worthy of notice in sharaz_jek's rant - and that includes you.  You've got to be a troll."
,DragonRebel,2010-01-02T18:35Z,"What a couple of douchebag trolls.  Men kiss women on TV, no idiots scream that they're ""PROMOTING A HETERO AGENDA!!!!!""  ONE character, just ONE, flirts with the Doctor in three eps out of how many, 50?  One couple who have about two minutes of screen time in ONE ep are single-sex married?

THAT'S A ""GAY"" AGENDA?

Wow.  Some people out there are really, really scared of homosexuality, aren't they?  Take your trollish comments and GO FUCK YOURSELVES"
,Sickpup120,2010-01-03T03:45Z,Just wanted to say thanks......\(^_^)/.....Happy New Year!!!!!!!
,gershitz,2010-01-03T04:46Z,"So, a few points of note:

1) Hilarious to see all the indignant 'fuck off troll' commentary from folks aimed at sharaz-jek - as his post was apparently dinged by the mods, you appear to be shouting at air.  

2) OTOH, congratulations are in order for you apostles of tolerance.  You've successfully shouted down a point a point of view (however poorly expressed) with which you don't agree.  Timothy Dalton's Rassillon would be proud. 

3) In the end, no biggie.  It's all a tempest in a teapot, anyway.  The UK is about 22 years away from full Sharia law, having allowed itself to be hollowed out by a self-hating Labor elite and near-unrestricted immigration.  I doubt these debates (or this curiously angry 'tolerance') will survive those days."
