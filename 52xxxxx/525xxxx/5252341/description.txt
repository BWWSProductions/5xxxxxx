While Jimmy tries to dodge a bullet, Pavel Korkov lets one fly

The series airs on Showcase Canada.

The resolution is 608x352 and while the quality is not as good as a scene release due to my capture and encoding methods it is quite watchable in my opinion.


Series Info: Described as a cross between The Office and The Sopranos by the show's creator, Malcolm MacRury (ZOS: Zone of Separation, Deadwood), Cra$h & Burn follows Jimmy Burn, a young claims adjuster for a cut-throat, bottom-line insurance corporation. Jimmy maneuvers his way around insurance scams and the criminal underworld as he tries to escape his past and make a better life on the gritty post-industrial streets of Hamilton.

Cra$h & Burn stars Luke Kirby (Tell Me You Love Me, Slings and Arrows) as Jimmy Burn, the cocky yet charming up-and-comer looking to claim a piece of the corporate pie as an insurance adjuster. Casting also features Leela Savasta (Battlestar Galactica, Intelligence) as Lucia Silva, Jimmy's live-in girlfriend; Caroline Cave (The L Word, This Beautiful City) as Catherine Scott, a shrewd yet practical in-house insurance lawyer; Clark Johnson (The Wire, Homicide: Life on the Street, also an Emmy-nominated director on The Shield) as Walker Hearn, a veteran insurance investigator and Steve Bacic (The Guard, Andromeda) as Korkov, a conman and Mafioso hustling to scam the system.
