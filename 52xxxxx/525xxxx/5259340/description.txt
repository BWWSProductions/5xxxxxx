.Hoarders.S02E06.Deborah.and.Jim.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM

Deborah is a 49 year old mother of two who fears that 
her hoarding may cause her two children to be taken 
away. Her husband Ron claims that Deborah's hoarding 
triggered his depression and alcoholism and Deborah 
claims that Ron's alcoholism fueled her hoarding. 
The situation went from bad to worse when Ron attempted 
suicide seven years ago. Now Deborah must either 
change or risk losing her family. Jim is living a 
double life. He manages a successful honey business 
as a bee keeper but at home he lives as a compulsive 
hoarder. His 37 year old daughter Heather has threatened 
to call Adult Protective Services on him if he doesn't 
change for the sake of himself and his eight month 
old granddaughter.
