,dlarrym1111,2011-08-14T05:58Z,"#1) If make a number in my computer how does it get into the system? (2) If I try (to get it into the system via the internet), my IP address will certainly show that I have no business having such a program. Lastly my IP address will show the feds and sate law enforcement exactly where to go. (You can't load software onto a public library computer, even if there was a way of using another terminal to ""INJECT"" the number into FL states DMV, if it entered the system from anywhere except KNOWN IP addresses, they would turn around and toss it out. Again, worthless app. I don't get its usefulness ???? Only a criminal would even be thinking of attaining this type of app. I would STAY THE HELL AWAY!!"

dont be foolish. this program simply generates the DRIVERS LICENSE NUMBER. with a little google research you can find the algorithm this file uses yourself. i dont know how you jumped to the conclusion of defrauding the american government but this program has nothing to do with that. use your head m8!"
