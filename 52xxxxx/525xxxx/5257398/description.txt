Ripped with DVDFAB to divx format.  Main language is English but there is German and French spoken throughout the movie (since takes place in France) but the english subtitles come up automatically for those.  DVDFAB seperates the subtitles that you would choose from the main menu on the dvd into a seperate file.  I'm not exactly sure how you make use of them, but they are included as well.  They are "English for the Hearing Impaired" subtitles.  I know the files is kinda big, but the movie is about 2 and half hours long and I didnt want to sacrifice quality.  I went through it before posting and audio and video stay in sync.  At any rate, enjoy.
