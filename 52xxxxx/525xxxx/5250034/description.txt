Political comedian Andy Zaltzman launches the first instalment of a decade-by-decade comic analysis of the Third Millennium, covering 2000 to 2009.

Ably assisted by a team of comic performers, Andy Zaltzman serves up a combination of stand-up, sketches, facts and blatant lies to round up the decade in style.

Each week, Andy examines the last 10 years in relation to the major events, characters, trends and developments in a different sphere of human existence, world politics, British society, the global economy, and the general state of the planet, and looks ahead to what the next ten years are likely to bring.

At the end of each episode, Andy gives the decade a score out of 10 for the issue covered. At the end of the final show, he tots up the decade's overall score and judges whether it has passed or failed.
