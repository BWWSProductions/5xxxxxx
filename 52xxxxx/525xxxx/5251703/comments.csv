The dogs (and cat) were introduced in short stories in the 4 issue Dark Horse ""Book of ..."" series. 3 of the 4 stories can be found on the Dark Horse website (link is mentioned on inside front cover of each issue of the mini); the 4th was not made available for free. However, higher-res scans of the 4 original stories can be easily found online. Just search for the following:

Dark Horse Book of Hauntings
Dark Horse Book of Monsters
Dark Horse Book of the Dead
Dark Horse Book of Witchcraft"
