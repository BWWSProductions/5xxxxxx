,BasilBrush,2010-01-05T23:53Z,I've just started seeding episode 6 (5th Jan 2010 10:50pm GMT). Episode 10 will be at least another day away before release. Login to MVGroup to check the status of the torrents.
,BasilBrush,2010-01-06T00:04Z,If you're desperate try downloading the newsgroup versions of these files. They're probably encoded at 3151Kbps instead of 4000Kbps.
