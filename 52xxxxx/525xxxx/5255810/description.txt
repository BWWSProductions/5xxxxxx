Episode 10. Primates.
The nature documentary series examines primates. Primates are just like us - intelligent, quarrelsome, family-centred. Huge armies of Hamadryas baboons, 400 strong, battle on the plains of Ethiopia to steal females and settle old scores. Japanese macaques in Japan beat the cold by lounging in thermal springs - but only if they come from the right family. An orang-utan baby fails in its struggle to make an umbrella out of leaves to keep off the rain.
