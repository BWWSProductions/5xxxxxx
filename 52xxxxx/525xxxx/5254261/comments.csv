Sheriff's Department puts 'The Squeeze' on new reality series.

Throughout its 80-year history, Cook County Jail has been a place of mystery, its inner workings shielded from the public and the media. Occasional stories, like one in the days before Christmas about an inmate dying after suffering a 106-degree temperature, are almost always negative. Some of that veil will be lifted Friday with the debut of a television series that examines the inner workings of the jail, the largest single-site county facility in the United States, and profiles the people who work and do time there.

MSNBC's ""The Squeeze"" takes cameras inside the jail, a feat made possible, those involved would have you believe, by a sheriff who advocates openness.
