,bagwell75,2010-02-22T10:30Z,"tracyleigh is there any chance you'd be able to upload the entire series? I watched this as a kid in the 80's and would love to see it again.
Thanks"
[T],tracyleigh,2010-02-24T01:14Z,"Hi bagwell75, I currently don't have episodes 1-8, but have 9 up to about 31 so far (just haven't had the time to upload them lately but will try and do it asap for you). As I get new ones I will upload them when I have the time. I too loved this series as a kid and was stoked to be able to find it in English. If you want to know where I get them from feel free to send me an email if you can and I'll let you know."
