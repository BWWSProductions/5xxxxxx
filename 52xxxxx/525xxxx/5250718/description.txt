The Tony B Show, a talk show thatâ€™s utterly unlike any other! Watch Tony B spin the guests in circles with his ridiculous questions and dead pan expression. His utter lack of research and knowledge will drive them up the wall and have them pull out their hair. And he does all this with the most innocent and blasÃ© demeanor.
Tony B Show is about the plentiful interviews where the use of clever questioning, the celebrity is put on the back footing and it cause the many collapsing. That is when the Tony B brings out the jumping truth on the T.V.

Tony B is undoubtedly the most un-presentable of presenters â€“ thick black horn-rimmed spectacles, a suit that makes the 70s look like the epitome of high fashion and a hairdo that will surely have the ladies swooning - literally!
