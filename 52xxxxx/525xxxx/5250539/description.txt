Here we are, back for the New year and ready to "UP" those music vidz, Concerts, and Rock stage shows you liked so much in '09! Starting off the year is the first part of the Sonisphere Festival 2009 that has become one of the UK's biggest draws for talent and name brand acts. In this first part we have Linkin Park, Anthrax, Metallica, with R.J. Dio and Tony Iommi on stage and hustlin' some of their stuff with a little band called Heaven and Hell. Alien Ant Farm also shows up to reminisce.

This 51:16 show was capped in HD for your viewing pleasure and we hope it makes for entertaining video regardless the acts. Either way, down load it and enjoy!
