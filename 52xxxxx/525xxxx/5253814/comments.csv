Of all the CDs that have become lost or scratched over the years, this is definitely one of the ones I miss(ed) the most. As you noted it's hard to find this name.

I've listened to the first track so far and the quality is good and this IS the album I've been searching for all these years.

Thankyou a million times you wonderful wondeful person!
