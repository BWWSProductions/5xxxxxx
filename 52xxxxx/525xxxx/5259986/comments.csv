But the intention was to actually and really remake the original, not improve on it. The acting and the video type (the quality is actually better, but most people aren't used to B&W and can't tell) are meant to replicate the original as close as possible. Frankly I think the pilot in this version is more believable, but that's subjective. What's special about this is that it was intended as a real remake, not an update, and that it was the first time in 30 years that a live, no delay, single shot, no retakes, get it right or not dramatic presentation was even attempted on TV. The errors are in the storyline, not the presentation. Like it or not (I do, very much) it's worth watching and saving because it's not likely that real live TV will be done in the future very much, if at all."
