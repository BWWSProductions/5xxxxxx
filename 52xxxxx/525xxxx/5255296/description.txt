DVD rip of Disney's G-Force to .avi using dvix codec.  New at ripping to different file types but it looked pretty good to me.  I checked all the way through to make sure audio and video stayed in sync the whole time.  I always had a problem wth that in my earlier attempts.  If there is anyone who has a fool proof method they use themselves, please let me know in the comments.

Thanks and enjoy.
