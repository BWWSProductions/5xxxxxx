"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side" is an hour-long episode of the FOX
animated series Family Guy and the sequel episode to the Star Wars parody "Blue
Harvest". While watching Aaron Sorkin's "new show" The Kitchen, the power goes out
once again in the Griffin family home. Remembering Peter's last story about Star Wars,
the others ask if he has any other stories like it. Peter responds by proceeding to
retell the story of The Empire Strikes Back (after first beginning to tell the story
of the movie Black Snake Moan) and once again re-imagines the film with Family Guy
characters.
