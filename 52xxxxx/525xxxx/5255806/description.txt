Episode 9. Plants. 
The nature documentary series examines plants and their ingenious and manipulative solutions to life's challenges. Time-lapse photography reveals plants acting like fly-paper, or spring-loaded traps, to catch insects. Vines develop suckers and claws to haul themselves up trees. Every peculiar shape proves to have a clever purpose; the dragon's blood tree's upturned umbrella form captures mist, and the seed of a Bornean tree has wings so aerodynamic they inspired the design of early gliders.
