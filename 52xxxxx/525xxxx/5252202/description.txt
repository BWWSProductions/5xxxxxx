 Rating...: 7.3/10   71 votes
 Genre....: Documentary
 Plot.....:

 A documentary about the film Peeping Tom (1960). How and why it was
 made, how the uniformly bad reaction from the critics at the time
 affected everybody concerned and how it is regarded now. Interviews
 with the cast and writer and with film critics past and present.
 Older critics still try to justify their bad reviews, some referring
 to it as a "snuff movie" despite the fact that the only death we
 see is that of the killer. It was released just as writer 'Leo Marks'
 was about to publish his autobiography of his time in SOE so there
 is quite a bit about wartime influences on the study of fear.
