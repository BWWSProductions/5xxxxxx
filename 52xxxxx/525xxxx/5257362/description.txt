Barrie Zwicker "Towers of Deception: The Media Cover-up of 9/11"
New Society Publishers | English | 2006-09-01 | ISBN: 0865715734 | 416 pages | PDF 


A dozen carefully researched books have exposed the official story of 9/11 to be a terror fraud. Yet the mainstream media have monolithically failed to ask elementary questions about anomalies in this story. So-called alternative media have been little better. Towers of Deception explains why and prescribes actions to break out the truth.

Authored by a lifelong journalist who was for thirty-five years a media critic, Towers of Deception provides twenty-six "exhibits" of evidence proving "beyond a reasonable doubt" that 9/11 was an inside job. It then presents case histories of de facto censorship by mainstream media and examines the psychological phenomenon of denial. "False flag" operations and psychological warfare are dealt with in detail, as is the "invisible government"-the powers pulling strings behind the scenes. Following a profile of Dr. David Ray Griffin as an authentic prophet of the 9/11 truth movement, Towers of Deception urges people to speak truth to power and challenge all media.

Interspersed with photographs, diary entries, and inspiring profiles of those who see 9/11 truth as the Achilles' heel of the neocon agenda, Towers of Deception includes a professional-quality DVD produced by the author: The Great Conspiracy: The 9/11 News Special You Never Saw.
