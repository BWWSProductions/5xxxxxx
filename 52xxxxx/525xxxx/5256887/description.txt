Lenny Kravitz 5

Release Date - 1998

This version only came with 13 Songs. The version released in '99 came with 2 extra bonus tracks which I've added here in another folder.

I did not end up buying the re-release. So I simply found the 2 extra tracks to add to this one. The CD you are getting here is EAC of mine.

If you want to burn those to CD as well, simply edit the cue sheets. It's not very difficult. Just use google to read more about cue sheets. 

If using cue sheets to burn, select a cue sheet, open it in notepad, and replace all ".wav" to ".flac", this is important otherwise your burning program will look for WAV files when you want it to look for FLAC instead.

If you are downloading FLAC, you should already know  a few things about this format. Otherwise, look it up. 

Easily one of my favorite albums. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. And remember, please seed for everyone and don't forget to say Thanks.
