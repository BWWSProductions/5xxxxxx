---Information--------------------------------------
This is some thing you can use to make your own fonts.
It's a lot of fun doing it, I even made my own fonts.

---System Requirements------------------------------
 - Mac OS X
 - Vuze (aka Azureus) or Tomato Torrent or ÂµTorrent
   or similar

---Requirements, not system-------------------------
 - You must have the time to seed this, don't be
   selfish.
 - You must NOT be a no-brainer like Dumb & Dumber
 - You must be able to create nice fonts otherwise
   you don't deserve to have Fontographer.
