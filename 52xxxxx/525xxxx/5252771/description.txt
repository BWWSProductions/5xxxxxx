Description: TIME WARP will reveal our world in astonishing and spectacular new ways by radically changing the lens of time. We will be able to see and appreciate things that are normally beyond our senses because they take place much too quickly, or too slowly.

You know how your dog uses the language when drinking? What happens to a person in getting a fist fighter UFC? What happens when a spinning fan dropping an egg? Or shoot an apple?
However, using only their eyes - can not see the details. In fact, in the world are countless number of events that we can not enjoy because of the limited capacity of our sensory organs ... but it was only until now.
The new show on Discovery Channel, in which Jeff Lieberman uses the latest technology in order to show the invisible before the wonderful things that in everyday life, we simply do not have time to notice.
With their equipment Time Warp team takes the simple events (a cat licking, opening bottles of champagne) - and not so simple (balloon with water in his face) - and turns them into a mixture of spectacular, surprising and informative.

Speed camera so even with the resolution of HDTV shoot different, usually very rapid and subtle eye processes, then all the show in slow motion. Classical prostrelivanie food, blows, piercing the air ball, throwing a ball filled with water, in the face, the various movements of the dog and others
