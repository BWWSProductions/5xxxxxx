On For Lack Of A Better Name, the follow-up to his critically acclaimed 2008 debut Random Album Title, deadmau5 takes a different turn by incorporating various styles of music into multi-blocks of songs. The album includes a new and improved version of his club favorite â€œGhosts â€˜Nâ€™ Stuffâ€ featuring added vocals by Pendulumâ€™s Rob Swire. There is also the charismatic â€œHi Friend!â€ and a downtempo block of tracks â€œLack Of A Better Name,â€ â€œThe 16th Hourâ€ and â€œStrobe.â€ His sound transcends various genres of music, flirting with techno and minimal beats while hinting at tech house, trance and electro, showcasing his diverse tastes and talents presented throughout the albumâ€™s ten songs. This true long player swings between a hard drum line cadence of the arena styled opening techno driven track of â€œFMLâ€ and manipulates the listener through till the end where it signs off with a multi-layered, beautifully sweeping soft synth, kick drum and movie score production of the final track â€œStrobeâ€.
