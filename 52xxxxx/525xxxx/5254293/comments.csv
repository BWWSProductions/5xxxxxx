,k3nd00d,2010-02-13T11:51Z,"Note how so much of the supposed settled AGW science has now been proven to not be science but based on WWF propaganda, hiking magazine articles, telephone interview statements known to be spurious, student papers and intentionally fudged math. If you want to know these details, let me know. I know a web radio show that has covered the MSM news coverage about this coming from the top UK online newspapers...or search for yourself.

I suspect new AGW counter propaganda videos on you-tube likely have been covering this too. Not like you can expect our US controlled media to cover it and with honesty. Even the GOP news channel (fox) is not adequately doing so. But then its owner (Rupert Murdoch) also owns AGW theory fraud friendly media in other countries (making fox what is known as ""controlled opposition"")."

People please stop reflexively googling the denialosphere for what to think, do some real research and you'll see the thousands (that's real thousands, not sceptic 'thousands') of papers and scientists in peer-reviewed journals forming an unarguable consensus. 

If you take this time-out from the world of groupthinking, mutually-appreciating conspiracy believers, you'll see how evasive, inconsistent and self-contradictory these 'sceptics' really are. They regularly support theories/papers which totally contradict those they held As I said on the other torrent, I am sad to see people conned into believing this obvious nonsense which is nothing to do with science but is pure, devious politics - I mean the misnamed 'scepticism' of AGW, of course.

They regularly support theories/papers which totally contradict those they held last week, ffs, yet see no need to reconcile this - it's just all grist to the mill of doubt!  Now I ask you - is that scientific? Is it even logical?!

'Sceptics', save yourself the humiliation some of you so enjoy inflicting on others - all the LOLing at the gullible on youtube is going to seem sadly ironic when the lid is blown, and that time is fast approaching - 2 glowingly reviewed books by respected authors already published that expose this real scandal in detail ('Merchants of Doubt' and 'Global Climate Change: A Primer')...
