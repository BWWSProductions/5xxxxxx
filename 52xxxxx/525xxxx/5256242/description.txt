So here we have it once again, the End of Year Countdown 2009. EOYC has been and is Worlds Biggest Online Electronic Dance Music event. It has been a wonderful year for AH.FM, I must say. We have been growing at a fast pace, this is not only due to the wonderful exclusive DJ's that have their shows here, but also the fact that we have an amazing community here and we wish to extend a big thanks to you all on our forum. We look out for one another here, I have seen a lot of examples of just that, & it shows how a "family" like AH.FM is. Of course there are ups and downs, obstacles that one has to overcome and best of all learn from them, but best of all its all about FUN!


NOTICE: Shows 63, 96, 215 and 283 have at this time, not yet been uploaded by the AH.FM crew and could not be included in this package. If they are at some point uploaded, they will be available at www.ah.fm.


This package is as complete as it gets at the moment. See you at EOYC 2010!


Enjoy.
