,ciderwar,2010-01-23T17:17Z,Bad recording distorts at peak levels probably recorded with too much base and volume uploader should learn how to rip music propally
[T],mrsjs,2010-01-27T09:07Z,"@ciderwar

yeah there are few clipping at peaks ! but overall in my opinion it is a far good rip of the Avatar Movie Soundtracks ! 

thanks

,Klowlife,2010-02-04T00:33Z,"Hey mrsjs,

I was looking for the Avatar soundtrack of the trailer but it seems it's the soundtrack of the movie called ""The Island"". I finally found it when I was watching tv and the movie was on (completely random). Thnx anyway! ^^

Thnx!"

,heffeque,2010-10-14T21:14Z,"Argh! The quality is horrible! What do you need 320 Kbps for if it's going to be ruined with clicks and quirks? So many distortions, specially when there's supposed to be loud bass. Deleted it right away. Gonna try another torrent. Hope it's not as bad as this one :-S"
,Millirem,2011-01-28T00:53Z,"Terrible rip, sound is clipped, metatags and album art all obnoxiously pimp the (bad) ripper, do not download."
