Performed in concert at Berlin's exquisite Tempodrom Arena in January of 2009, this DVD showcases David Garrett's unique and wholly individual style which pays as much homage to Metallica as to Bach. This concert covers an incredibly diverse selection of repertoire, representing David's love for many genres and his remarkable ability to tackle each with unsurpassed enthusiasm. Michael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal" is cleverly reinterpreted, as is Queen's ballad, "Who Wants to Live Forever." AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" is given a memorable new twist, alongside "He's a Pirate" from "Pirates of the Carribean." Given his enduring commitment to his first musical love, watch as David performs classical selections including the last movement of Vivaldi's "Summer" from The Four Seasons, and Bach's "Air." Not to be satisfied with only imaginative covers, David also displays his own deft writing skills with notable originals, including "Chelsea Girl."
