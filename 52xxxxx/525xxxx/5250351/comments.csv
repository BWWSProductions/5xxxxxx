,wburdett,2010-02-05T23:29Z,"I copied the m4v directly to the ps3 but not getting any audio. Am I missing something?

I also tried ps3mediaserver encoding and fine picture but still no audio. I appreciate any help guys"
,tehnores,2011-12-09T00:53Z,"Quality is great, but there's an encoding problem. At 0:27:46, there seems to be 1280ms of audio missing (according to HandBrake) that causes WMP to crash and PS3 Media Player to stream out-of-sync from that point on.

I re-encoded the file with HandBrake and it automatically fixed the problem. The video glitches for a second, but it stays in sync afterwards."
