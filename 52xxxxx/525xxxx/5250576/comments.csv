,snoski3,2010-01-04T00:04Z,I have to redo episodes 33-36.  I don't know if you have to restart the download or if you can just redownload those episodes.  Sorry for the trouble.  All of the other episodes are clean.

,snoski3,2010-01-22T15:04Z,"I am breaking down the ""Bleach episodes 21 - 41 in English DVD format"" torrent into the five dvd's.   They are in the same format as this one so don't delete what you have already downloaded."
