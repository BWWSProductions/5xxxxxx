AUDIO is a german magazin for High Fidelity and High End Music
Equipment.

In some issues of AUDIO a CD with Tracks of the best musicians
and the best possible audio quality is enclosed to the magazine.

These CD's have mostly tracks in Jazz, Classic Music but also
Pop & Rock and World Music.

I have the best experience with CD's from AUDIO and want to 
share this also with you :-)
