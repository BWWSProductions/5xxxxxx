Now, the main thing I want you ""skull"" holders to notice is that your releases need a little more info about the ""upload"" - ""what kind"" of ""dvd rip"", quality of audio and video, and sample pictures from the uploaded stuff. You might actually gain some more respect as well.
Happy New Year. :)"
