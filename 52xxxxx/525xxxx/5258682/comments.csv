You're a fagbrain. Then again, what would one expect, you're from Serbia.
21 THOUSAND seeders. 35 online and speed is below 90Kb/s. I fuckin' hate leechers and wish there was a way to have 'em banned if they are on - ratio. U are fucking egoistic pigs. Go and die motherfuckers. "

,Shadow_Jedi,2010-01-06T04:21Z,"@ Marko90_bg-SERBIA: If you don't like the show than why even post on a site and run your yap where twenty thousand + fans are downloading from...? This show isn't close to Power Rangers and if that is your only film reference than obviously your not very cultured, you swine. I spit on you and all douche bags like you you that run you mouth on torrents that they have no place on in the first place. Eat a Serbian turd you cock smoker! 

@ eztv: Thanks a lot for your continuous and ultra fast uploads. I've gotten most of my television show from you and never posted a thanks. If it wasn't for you I would be stuck watching these on the net or television at the broadcasting time with brainwashing commercials. You or your team does an outstanding service to the pirating community!"
