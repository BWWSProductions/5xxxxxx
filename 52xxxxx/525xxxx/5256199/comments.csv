,noddegamra81,2010-01-12T12:51Z,does this version have the bowling that was on the ps2 version? 
,Loading..,2011-04-08T06:26Z,"wow works great. I thought it would run slow but its fast. But I can't change any settings e.g. graphics, difficulty settings, number of rounds, round time, etc. How to do that? Although its easy to configure keyboard controls. Thanks"
,Gneboll,2011-07-06T15:18Z,wtf that old crap needs 2 gb of ram you joking 
,MikeQuest333,2011-07-30T19:29Z,"Thanks for uploading and to those seeding.
the game works great. though it lags a little but that is due to my old pc. I have completed the arcade twice i.e won 8 stages (the final one with Unknown) but still haven't been able to unlock any characters.... it says on the net that completing the arcade unlocks certain modes and characters.
i have searched the net a little but couldn't find any answers... can anybody help.
Thanks
Mike"
,MikeQuest333,2011-08-07T12:47Z,"finally got it, there are cheat.dat & cheat.zip files found in another one of the torrents on the site for the same game along with a file that explains how to use them; which unlocks all characters.
