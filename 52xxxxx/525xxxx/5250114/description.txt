Alex talks with author, journalist, lecturer, historian, and expert on false flag attacks Webster Tarpley about the underwear bomber. Tarpley is the author of several important books, including Obama: The Post Modern Coup and Barack H. Obama: The Unauthorized Biography, both available at the Infowars Store.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
