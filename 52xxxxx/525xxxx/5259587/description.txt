Joseph Carey Merrick (5 August 1862 â€“ 11 April 1890) was an Englishman who became known as "The Elephant Man" because of his physical appearance caused by a congenital disorder. 

Because of his condition, he would garner the sympathy of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland during the great Victorian era. He has often been incorrectly called John Merrick.
