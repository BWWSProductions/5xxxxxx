,acilius,2010-11-29T22:56Z,Do understand that Longhorn and Vista are completely different! Longhorn had the sidebar as part of the core ui while Vista doesn't. They scrapped longhorn because it was taking to long. Vista and Longhorn are in no way related. They are simply both Windows OSs.
,LH-TAIMI,2010-12-13T18:22Z,"NOTE THIS! All longhorn builds up to 4074 is xp  Builds (Based on xp)

And the three over is windows ""codename"" longhorn vista!

Cheers =)"
