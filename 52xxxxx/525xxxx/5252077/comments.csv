,wordupp,2010-01-02T06:10Z,"in avatar, or whip it?"
,greatsunrise,2010-01-02T07:32Z,"wordup. avatar is one of those movies you have to watch in theaters, even better if in 3d imax. on a small psp or ipod screen, a 400 million dollar produced film (including marketing) just does not serve it justice."
,c0rnbread,2010-01-02T19:36Z,"Hey holy roses three things.

1. I made a website where people could request a video for you to upload and wanted to know if you approve. It's rough right now and I'll make it better if you approve.

2. Could you upload ""Bad Santa (2003)"" in your (PSP, iPod, Zune) format?

3. Another movie (if you can and have the time) is ""Halloween (2007)"" also in your (PSP, iPod, Zune) format.

If you don't have the time of flat out don't want to do it that's okay. Thank you in advance,

Trevor ""c0rnbread"""
