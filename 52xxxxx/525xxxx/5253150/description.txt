
Lincoln is the second album by the band They Might Be Giants. It was released in 1988. The album is named after John Linnell and John Flansburgh's boyhood home of Lincoln, Massachusetts. The two men pictured are Linnell's great-grandfather, Lewis T. Linnell (left) and Flansburgh's maternal grandfather, Brigadier General Ralph Hospital (right).

Lincoln's lyrics further elaborate the themes and surrealistic, wordplay-heavy style of They Might Be Giants ("Shoehorn With Teeth"), but include more songs about troubled romantic relationships ("Ana Ng", "They'll Need a Crane", "I've Got a Match"), and some songs that verge on social or political satire ("Purple Toupee", "Pencil Rain", "Kiss Me, Son of God"). Lincoln is a more technically polished album than They Might Be Giants, making heavier use of what would become TMBG's signature instrument, Linnell's accordion. Hints of jazz ("Lie Still, Little Bottle") and sea shanties ("Mr. Me", "Cowtown") are added to the previous album's wide-ranging musical influences.

Despite its primitive sound (the duo would eventually take on a backing band with live drums), this do-it-yourself effort is widely considered by critics to be the band's defining musical statement.

This album is included in Then: The Earlier Years, a compilation of the band's early material, in its entirety.
