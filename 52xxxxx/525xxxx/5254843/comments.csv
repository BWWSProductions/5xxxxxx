I can hear audio on this vid just fine or i wouldn't have posted it. I am using Media Player Classic and the CCCP codec pack (FFDShow based). Hope this helps you :)"
,brianxxx,2010-01-05T03:16Z,OK. Will try. Did some other tests. Maybe bad download. 
,brianxxx,2010-01-07T18:19Z,Downloaded it again. All is well. Great upload. Have any LS with Danica Collins or Teya ? Besides the ones already found here?
