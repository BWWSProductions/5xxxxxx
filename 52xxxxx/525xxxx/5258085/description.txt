My collection of Irving's ebooks found @ http://www.fpp.co.uk/books/index.html
I've organized them somewhat, that's all - I repeat, nothing here you cannot
easily get from the website shown above.
As for the (possible) trolls endlessly searching for what offends them, all i can say is that (for me) David Irving is a decent historian who has written interesting books.
