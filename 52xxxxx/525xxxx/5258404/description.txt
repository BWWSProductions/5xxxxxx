               .  . ..: EPiSODE SUMMARY :.. .  .             
                                                              
    A glamorous group of London socialites and genteel         
    Cornish locals are gathered at the stunning Art Deco      
    home of charming retired actor Sir Charles Cartwright    
    (a livelier performance than usual from Martin Shaw):     
    among them are a wealthy psychologist (Art Malik), a       
    nosey playwright, a mild-mannered vicar, a pretty young   
    gel called Egg and a hatchet-faced housekeeper. And      
    Poirot, of course. Before they've even downed the first  
    Martini, one of them is dead. Not Poirot, of course.     
    Cartwright, having successfully played a detective on    
    the London stage, is determined to play detective in     
    real life and he doesn't do badly, finding all sorts of  
    clues and leads. However - unlike in the original novel  
    Three Act Tragedy - he deigns graciously to let Poirot   
    help him after a second inexplicable death takes place.  
    This Christie whodunnit is so sumptuously staged, so     
    artfully theatrical and has such a handsome cast, you    
    can easily forgive it being laughably easy to work out   
    who the murderer is.
