,Ms_Medea,2010-01-11T11:38Z,I'm sorry!!! I don't know what I'm doing wrong!! 
,Ms_Medea,2010-01-16T17:05Z,"I'm sorry for the inconvenience but I tried again by making another torrent and it seems to be doing ok- its called The Vampire Diaries ST #2 and I'm going to be seeding for days if I have to until other people have it downloaded fully.

 I know: I'm a noob, I'm retarded, I'm all kinds of bad names.

Again I'm so sorry- I wasn't trying to be a bitch or anything I just really don't know what I'm doing. I mean, I'm following directions I looked up in an article called ""A Step-by-step Guide To Create and Upload Torrents"" for fraks sake! 

This is trial and error for me and I'm really sorry I'm not doing better. I just wanted to help- not piss people off. "

,circumvent,2010-10-13T22:58Z,"hey, Ms_Medea, relax, everyone was a noob once and I don't think anyone in their right mind would flame on anyone trying to help out the community :-) great choice of first upload...and practice makes perfect..."
