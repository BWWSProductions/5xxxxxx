Description:
Physics is frequently one of the hardest subjects for students to tackle because it is a combination of two of the toughest subjects for most
students: Math and Word Problems.

If you understand the math but don't do well in word problems then you will have trouble. And if you understand the word problem but have no idea
where to begin with the math, again, you will not do well.

The Ultimate Physics Tutor is a complete Physics course that begins at the very beginning assuming the student has never seen a physics equation.
The course then proceeds to introduce new topics in an easy-to-understand fashion. The course is a 2 DVD series, 11 full hours in duration, and
contains 24 chapters of material so you can be assured that all of the core topics are covered in detail. What sets this DVD apart from the rest
is that the concepts are taught entirely through example problems. The easiest way to learn Physics is to work problems as you learn the material
- and that is exactly what this 2 DVD series provides. You will immediately improve your problem-solving skills which will help on homework and
exams, and you will have a reference for many of the commonly asked problems in Physics. If you have a problem with your homework, simply find a
similar problem fully worked on the Ultimate Physics Tutor!
