my brother inlaw, Blindmanpuppet , was fixing a chicks computer when her roommate made fun of him for being a computer nerd, calling him 'geek squad' and all. Well as it turned out she needed an antivirus program installed on her laptop too. Long story short, he pirated these off of her hard drive when she wasnt looking. LOL DONT EVER FUCK WIT A PIRATE!!
