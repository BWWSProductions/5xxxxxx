,fresh_prince7679,2010-01-02T02:55Z,"""ha! some idiot tried to pack an avi! ha! what a fucking noob!

just saying ""

Hey idiot, calm down and learn to speak. You don't even know your acronyms. (An acronym is a word formed by the first letter of a series of words.)

 Example: gtfo means ""Get the Fuck Off"". Therefore when you said "" gtfo off the internet!!!1"" You really said ""Get the fuck off off the internet!. 

Also while we are at it, Putting multiple exclamation marks (they look like this !) to a sentence does not make it better.  

And in closing, I believe you let go of your shift button prematurely as there is a stranded 1 at the end of you exclamation marks.

This guy may have packed an .avi file, but your the one who come across as the biggest moron. "

,aspiderman25,2010-01-02T14:29Z,"VIRUS? i would say dont download but too late. lol.  I am suprised 20,000 seeders and leechers and no one is using anti virus software. both avira antvir guard and avg and avast all free picked up sality.Y or avg tanatos.m nasty rootkit keylogger password stealing virus embedded in r4 and r8, r13, r31, r33 .rar files. come on, anyone???? anyone got infected by it. i repaired files before executed. if anyone cares u could run it in vmware or virtualbox and see what it does and protect your computer. avira free anti virus protection is best out of 3. good luck. that virus is everywhere and in usb autorun.inf drives infected so many computers. good luck"
,thefan,2010-01-02T14:37Z,"can all you smart asses stop your crap & tell the ratings for the movies, for which comment section is for anyways, not for all your mindless crap

M = ????"
,aspiderman25,2010-01-02T14:58Z,LOl. that post was not mindless. it was truth. those .rar files have virus. go download free antivirus software. i have all 3 free ones. or scanfiles. at virustotal dot com. i give link to one of the .rar files scanned. i cant believe u know how to use torrents but u know nothing else about computers. go figure. maybe my computer had infected the files from other movie downloaded. that fuckin virus sucks. peace
,aspiderman25,2010-01-02T15:24Z,"10,000 seeds and noone seeding. good. they are probably fake seeds so that the uploader could get on top 100 list and more people will download the and get infected with the virus. haha laugh and make fun like u never heard of computer or rootkit virus. fucking noobs on public trackers. i was only trying to help.

,BigSniff,2010-01-02T21:03Z,"""go download free antivirus software. i have all 3 free ones. or scanfiles.""

LOL, you have 3 AV's running? No wonder you get false reports, each one is treating the other as a virus."

,Sharak23,2010-01-03T01:33Z,"Audio Video good quality, the movie itself was disappointing. When I saw the trailer I got excited to see this one, it looked good. The screenplay and script was kind of cliche and disappointing. The idea of the movie is good"

,BoneThugish,2010-01-03T05:10Z,"@dulhanr
