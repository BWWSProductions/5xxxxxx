,fredfan,2010-01-02T17:09Z,Why are you uploading movies djfred has already done?
,clwilson1977,2010-01-03T05:25Z,"Because i am playing with a new encoder to me, CCE and was learning how to use it.  Plus I was in Iraq if you must know for a year so not sure what was uploaded and not.  And personally not going to take time to look through 1000's of torrents.  I am sorry to inconvenience you."
,fredfan,2010-01-03T18:13Z,"That's no excuse, soldier! (Slap!, slap!) Get back in those trenches and upload HARDER!!!  It's probably for the best, since this is one of the rare ULs fred let slip with an imperfection in it, as mentioned in its comments section.  Looking forward to your contributions, and don't let the inevitable ingrate bastards get you down--Fred's got some big shoes to fill and a huge shadow to escape from."
