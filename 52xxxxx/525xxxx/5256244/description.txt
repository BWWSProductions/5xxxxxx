For the last several months I've been looking for a good running playlist. Couldn't find anything that suited my purposes, so I downloaded a bunch of music and created my own playlist. Over five hours' worth of music; eclectic is an understatement.

Things were downloaded from different locations, so files are various bitrates, etc. ALL are mp3s.
