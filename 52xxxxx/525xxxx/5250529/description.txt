Who Do You Think You Are S01E10 - Don Cherry (CA)

Don Cherry is as famous for his outspoken hockey commentary as he is for his unique fashion sense. He has been hosting CBC's Coach's Corner on Hockey Night in Canada for over twenty-four years. A former player and long-time coach, Don made a name for himself as the feisty champion of some of the scrappiest hockey players in the sport. He is also a fierce supporter of Canada's military troops. Don begins his journey into his ancestry wondering if his support of the military just might run in his blood.

The resolution is 608x352 and while the quality is not as good as a scene release due to my capture and encoding methods it is quite watchable in my opinion.


The series consisted of 13 episodes. I have most but not all of the episodes. However, each episode is self-contained so it isn't a big deal. If it ever airs again, I'll try to fill in the missing eps.
