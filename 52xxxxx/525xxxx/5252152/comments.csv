,sandshreder,2010-01-02T18:36Z,"To all the God haters... 

First question, according to your faith in evolution there is no God so why do you care? really... why care, if there is no God there is no moral authority... why waste your time with those who love God? why worry about what is uploaded on the Pirate Bay?

Second, YOU believe we evolved from a rock (earth was just a molten rock and water arrived millions of years later according to evolutionary hypothesis)... so you believe we evolved from a rock whether you know it or not, SO who is dumber a creationist or evolutionist?

Third, you cannot prove or disprove evolution, nor can you prove or disprove God, AREN'T both a just religion?

Fourth, If a frog turns into a prince over millions of years its called science... If a frog is kissed by a princess and turns into a prince immediately its a ferry tale..., Now seriously... who is believing in ferry tales???  .......................... and who Trusts the Prophecies we see happening right in front of our eyes today???

Study the bible before you bash Christianity, maybe you wont sound so dumb!

God bless, and thank you uploader!

THAT is what is sickening. intolerance."
