This Estonian documentary of the Afghanistan experience was an eyeopener - especially since we have seen plenty of films of Americans, who have returned to Vietnam to find closure. It was now interesting to find how the 1,112 Estonians who had been sent (conscripted into the Soviet Red Army) to Afghanistan, where 50 Estonians had died, coped with similar situations. It was filmed in a country where 1.2 million Afghans have died â€” and fighting is still going on, â€” though there was no sign of current fighting in the documentary. 
Two ex-soldiers, both conscripted by the Soviets to fight in Afghanistan ten years apart, between 1979 and 1989, returned to walk the same areas where they had fought a brutal war.

Film jutustab kahest erinevalt kulgenud "Afganistani loost", mida kannavad kaks kangelast ja nende pered. Kunstnik Simson SeakÃ¼last, kelle naine ei luba tal sÃµda meeldegi tuletada, sest "siis Simson jÃ¤lle kolm nÃ¤dalat joob" ja Puurmanist pÃ¤rit traktorist Leino, kes jÃ¤i Afganistanis jalgadest ja Ã¼hest silmast ilma just nÃ¤dal enne kojulendu. Lisaks kommentaare veteranide naistelt, kelle meestest-afganistani poistest on saanud mÃ¤ngurid vÃµi alkohoolikud, psÃ¼hhiaatritelt, kes proovivad armidega mehi hingeliselt uuesti jalule tÃµsta.
