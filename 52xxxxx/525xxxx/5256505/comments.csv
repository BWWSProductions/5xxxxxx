,krokkk,2010-04-17T03:33Z,"Yep, this is THE version to have.  It's excellent, and the only way to see it.  Thanks for keeping it alive!"

,dunedark,2011-02-13T12:55Z,"This is indeed the best version, the others have been cropped in top and bottom and gives a much more ""zoomed in"" and confuzing composition.

I downloaded 3 versions to compare side by side. This one is the best."
,kozmobunny,2011-06-07T16:13Z,i really want this version to get the unedited video. i DLed it and tried to play it in VLC uninterrupted. it come in 6 playable TS files. i load them into the VLC playlist and it has to skip to the next one after each one plays. this hinders my experience more then cropping. any suggestions?
,Mocani3,2011-06-23T17:11Z,Salamat!
,jesthigh,2011-08-01T04:13Z,DL speed is soooo low. Greedy capitalists.
,SoMoS,2011-09-18T16:11Z,"Thanks so much for this.  So far ahead of its time, everyone should watch this incredible piece.  The filmaker Fricke is a genius, so is Philip Glass."
,72194123,2011-12-08T03:22Z,Hail to open matte! Best we will get until It's on Bluray in this aspect ratio.

,KKafka,2012-03-23T05:55Z,"Thanks a lot. DL was slow, but not terribly so.
The other versions are cropped to fit the 16:9 aspect ratio. The IRE version shows the full screen, as in the 1.33:1 theatrical version, at a smaller resolution (something like 720x540). Quality is pretty good, though. 
Screen caps comparing this to the HDTV version:
