,ajarnmark,2010-01-05T03:25Z,"Thank you for the upload. I was wondering what happened to the series, if it was still running.
In Thailand it's hard to view.
So your time is greatly appreciated. "
,zen-TAO,2010-01-05T05:50Z,"thank you!

""jonXo"" - no offense, but if you try to DL both avi and .rar you may notice that the .rar-files will give you a faster DL.

Peace and Love!"

and equally no offense zen-TAO, I've been doing this for a long time and I've never noticed rars to D/L any faster. I too much prefer avi's

Happy new year to all"
