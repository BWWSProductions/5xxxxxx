PanteÃ³n RococÃ³ blends several styles of popular music such as rock, punk, salsa, cumbia, mariachi, reggae, ska, and also mestizo-music into a very energetic, groovy sound. As they are very political people and sympazise with the EZLN in Chiapas, some of their lyrics contain political statements, but many of them are love-songs.
