Now - Smash Hits Of The 80's(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
______________________________________________

Now That's What I Call Music, Smash Hits was a compilation album 
released in 1987. 

The album is part of the (UK) Now! series, and is a collaboration 
with Smash Hits magazine, a successful pop music based magazine at 
the time. 

It was conceived, written and designed by the Smash Hits staff.

The album features popular UK Singles Chart hits from 1980 to 1987, 
in rough backwards chronological order, starting with more recent 
songs (four songs for each year) and ending with older ones. 

Many of the older songs had not featured on any Now albums before 
as the series did not start until 1983. 

A companion issue of the magazine was released at the same time, 
featuring pictures and lyrics to all of the songs on the album.

Neil Tennant, who features on side 1 of the album as part of 
Pet Shop Boys, worked as Assistant Editor of Smash Hits magazine 
in the early 1980s
