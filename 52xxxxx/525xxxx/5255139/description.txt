Jimmy Smith - Live In '69


The Jimmy Smith Trio recorded live in a concert setting at Salle Pleyel, Paris, France, 1969.

Not a single minute is wasted in surroundings, lengthy announcements, banter, 'jazz organ history education', 'guided tour of the town', etc. This production is instead all about the trio and the music. The movie starts, the band starts playing immediately, and they play without any interruption during a full 86 minutes, until the end of the movie.

If anyone happens to have a question about the performance as such, here is the answer: They groove, cook and swing at top-notch level!

Jimmy Smith is of course the true virtuoso and driving force behind his Hammond B-3 organ, with his impeccable timing, incredible technique, and swing, but Eddie McFadden, the cool guitarist, will make no one disappointed with his performance aided by his Gretch and Fender amp, and the drummer Charlie Crosby lays a very solid backdrop using his Premier drums.

Extensive high quality footage and good sound, with lots of close-up angles. I would say excellent camera work and production considering it's from 1969 after all, captured in black & white.
