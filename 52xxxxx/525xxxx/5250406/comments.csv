No, correct is in fact ""das weisse Band"". That's because ""das"" is the definite article. With an indefinite article you would be correct: ""ein weisses Band"".

The same for example with ""the blue house"" versus. ""a blue house"":
das blaue Haus
ein blaues Haus."
,fumbler123,2010-01-12T05:27Z,"Is this one for real... has anyone verified this?!?  TSOG2001 you're just promoting this one on the other White ribbon torrent that's out there, but now it says Anonymous... sounds sketchy... Anyone else saying it's fake... did some other people actually look at it? or do we have posters just posting fake for fun.  Been dying to see this one.  My theaters suk and I won't get this one near me."
,tsog2001,2010-01-13T00:30Z,"fumbler123, before i posted this torrent, i attempted to download the torrent you mentioned - it has no seeder; therefore i uploaded this copy (after searching for & downloading, obviously). I noticed that people were still attempting to get the torrent w/out a seeder & so posted my message - my torrent is ""anonymous"" because it's not my rip."
,cinesimon,2010-01-14T03:54Z,"Hi there: is this a DVD rip, or a screener/cam? Also, is the audio 2.0 or 5.1? 
Probably the former given file size - and Haneke isn't one for surround usually - but thought I'd ask anyway!
Thanks for your efforts, 'tsog2001'"
,pInO_,2010-01-19T04:54Z,"i think it should be das weisses band, but my german is poor too"
,OrpheusDude,2010-01-20T08:43Z,"A)  Thank you for the download!

B)  I live in Herr Haneke's city and I assure you: ""Das weiĂe Band"" is correct!  ""raimb,"" above, gives the correct explanation."

BTW, this is a DVVDSCR.

Can't understand why the uploader didn't care to share this info.
