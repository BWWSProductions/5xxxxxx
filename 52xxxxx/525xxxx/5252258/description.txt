This is my compact version of Nanashi's 720p release. As you can see from the file size, the movie is significantly smaller. I've reduced it to 480p and converted the audio to Vorbis stereo. The quality is still great. Trust me!

Plot Summary: 

Renton, son of scientists, and Eureka, a girl who can't live under the sun, are raised together when very young and become very attached to each other. One day, Eureka is taken away. Powerless at the time, Renton vows to rescue her. He enters the military and is soon assigned to the Independent Youths Unit 303 of the First Mobile Forces thanks to his exceptional performance alongside his Nirvash, a bio-mechanical armor/control system. Unknown to Renton, lies a plot to extinguish the alien invasion that is currently happening. It involves not only him, but Eureka too.

Leave any compliments or complaints please! I hope this was a good encode.
