The Chemical Wedding is the fifth studio album by English heavy metal singer Bruce Dickinson [Iron Maiden, Samson]. It was released on July 14, 1998 through Sanctuary Records, and included the single "Killing Floor"â€”released only in Japan. The album draws some inspiration from the works of William Blake - of whom some paintings are featured in the artwork, as well as both sung and spoken excerpts from Blake's prophetic works - although the name of the album and its title track derive from the Rosicrucian manifest the Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz. As with the previous album, it featured Iron Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith, former (and once again current) bandmate of Dickinson.
