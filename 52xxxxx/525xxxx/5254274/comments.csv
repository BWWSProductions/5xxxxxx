But when I open C&C I just get the first picture it displays when the game is loading (the one with the tanks and the title) but windows says it isn't working."
,MODUSOPERANDl,2010-01-15T09:54Z,"Maybe these can fix the problem:

Try using the key 4912-5083939-6799769-5962. That's the one that worked for me.

OR

If you're running Windows 7 or Vista, try changing the compatibility to XP Service Pack 2.

On my version the window stays stuck on the loading page with the tanks unless I click with my mouse. Then it starts up.

Does Windows give you any errors or notifications of missing files?"
,XanderHarris,2010-01-21T22:07Z,"I keep getting ""Wrong serial length"" or ""serial inserted into registry"" when I try to enter the key."
,Schmitty93,2010-01-31T02:01Z,"I have a problem: I followed the instructions, and opened Generals. However, it stays on the ""Tank"" screen for a long while. Following this phase, the screen flashes and I have an error message saying ""Sorry, a serious error occurred."" Please advise?"
,Chenier09,2010-01-31T22:41Z,"So, i followed instructions and when i ran setup, ""redist.exe"" won't decompress, then i just continued on, and ran generals.exe after inserting the serial and whatnot, and it won't go past the tank screen, and it just says a serious error occured and closes, so i reran setup after deleting everything and the exact same thing happened, someone help! please!"
,MODUSOPERANDl,2010-02-01T06:44Z,"Make sure you're running minimum specs or better: Intel Pentium 3/AMD Athlon 800 MHz, 128 MB RAM, Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista (32 bit), 32 MB AGP DirectX 8.1 compatible video card NVIDIA Geforce 2 or ATI Radeon 7500, DirectX 8.1 compatible sound card, 1.8 GB hard disk space.

Make sure that setup.bat runs completely; if it says that a serious error has occurred, CTRL + ALT + DELETE and make sure that Generals.exe 
and game.dat are not running in your processes, then try again. Also try clicking the tank screen with your mouse (I have to click it to get it to load completely).

Try changing the compatibility to Windows XP Service Pack 2 if you're running on Vista or 7 64 bit (though I'm probably stating the obvious here).

Not sure why redist.exe isn't decompressing. Try using Winrar or 7Zip if you haven't already; redist.exe failing to decompress is definitely your issue if it's not running since it's the DirectX patch. Make sure you've the latest DirectX codecs."
,phat13h,2010-02-03T17:06Z,Can u play on EA servers? if not can u give me a link somewhere of the game that i can play on the ea servers?
,phat13h,2010-02-03T17:40Z,"aaaaaaaaaa everytime i open the setup batch it just
sits there...when i press key it does nothin (running vista)"
,efi26,2010-03-15T14:19Z,does not work
,keefmak,2010-05-20T21:49Z,"Spot on works lovely in Windows XP Except The
Keygen dont work but the Ser no. that you have supplied in one of you replies works a treat.
Keep up the good work"
,MODUSOPERANDl,2010-06-15T00:11Z,"Thanks keefmak. I think some of the problems people are experiencing may be with not letting setup.bat run long enough (while it may look like it's done, it may not be, so be sure to run it twice and give it some time).

Furthermore, for those of you on Windows Vista and 7: try disabling the Windows Driver Authentication option. You should be able to hit F8 during your boot-up and disable it from there. This may not be the issue though, since as I've said before, I've run this both on XP and 7 (without having to do this) and it works fine. Connection to EA servers for online play is unfortunately disabled due to the authentication process which would be required for you to play online which, as you know with many cracked games, won't work anyways."
