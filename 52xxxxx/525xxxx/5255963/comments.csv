,ingramlcf,2010-01-05T11:24Z,"Well , the image quality is very good for a 8.83 GB file. but i have to  say if someone expecting a better sound quality ( even it mention as AC3 2 channel) the sound is a bit disappointed... seldom see a 8Gb sound like this. but no matter what appreciate the seeder to upload such a interesting movie. and no sub title if you require one, but i bet you can download an SRT file elsewhere."
,Hardcode,2010-01-07T00:59Z,"Yeah, wtf with the audio?  I've never seen *only* a 192k 2 channel audio file in an HD movie release, so I didn't bother to look before I downloaded.  Perhaps that's my fault, but wtf?"
,hypnopotamus,2010-01-07T17:44Z,"yeah, what is with the sound?? why is it so bad??? :("
,Jim1979,2010-01-09T22:10Z,AC3 2ch @ 192 Kbps. Well that sucks. I cant watch this one. 
,twgg,2010-01-13T00:50Z,"not worth the download, the movie itself sux large"
,X45JKD,2010-01-14T18:21Z,Thanks for the upload but the sound quality is horrible. You can barely make out what they're saying.
,TMA2,2010-02-05T21:33Z,"""LINE"" motherfuckers. learn about it"
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-02-09T02:06Z,"Lol, Audio: AC3 2ch @ 192 Kbps
