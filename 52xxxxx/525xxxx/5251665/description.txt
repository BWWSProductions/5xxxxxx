The News At Bedtime - Series 01 - Audio Comedy - BBC Radio 4 via DVB-T 
7 x 15 Minute Episodes - 128Kbps - Mp3 - Slimoo

Inspired by their column for Private Eye, writers Ian Hislop and Nick Newman have created an in-depth news analysis programme covering the latest events... in a fairytale world.

The News at Bedtime is introduced by twin presenters John Tweedledum (Jack Dee) and Jim Tweedledee (Peter Capaldi) - who argue and disagree with everyone - and sometimes each other.

This is serious broadcasting: The News At Bedtime addresses the zeitgeist issues of today and once upon a time; Humpty Dumpty's great fall, the worrying story of Jack and the Genetically Modified Beanstalk and the celebrity wedding of the owl to the pussycat, to name but three.
