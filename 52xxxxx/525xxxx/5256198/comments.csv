,fschd1,2010-01-17T13:54Z,For them all  to work you need all the Official refx nexus  packs  for nexus 1.41
,Nuieve,2010-01-25T00:15Z,"Works perfectly. Several presets are empty and a few ask for some unknown expansion pack, but this is a tiny drawback of this otherwise spectacular pack. Thousands and thousands of excellent sounds that finally make Nexus more complete. For example I always thought there were way too few arps... now you have thousands of them. Also tons of good usable straight pads (not so fun to listen alone, but great in the mix). Millions of basses, gazillions of leads, plucks and great variety in non-categorized sounds. "
,iamnotcoollll,2010-02-03T22:07Z,"the files that are here for download are not the only files needed to be able to use these sounds, there are only fxp files but they wont work because i dont have the nxp files which are the actual exp files that i can import, any suggestions? "
,fschd1,2010-02-26T11:09Z,read my second post
,fschd1,2010-05-04T15:27Z,"Gazaramataz  none are corrupted , you just need ALL ..all...ALL of the nexus .nxp packs ,some are hard to get . 5 are not to easily available.
once you have them all, you will get no corrupt data errors"
,sumr4ndomguy,2010-05-05T00:54Z,@fschd1 So what you're saying is that I have to find those .nxp files in order for all of them to work? Do you by any chance have them all working so you can possibly upload the .nxp files? Sounds like a good Torrent idea to me. :p Other than that cheers mate. :]
,shredhed,2010-05-05T11:17Z,"thanks for the reply to my post on your other torrent fschd1.

Indeed I did read your second post.. I've followed your instructions but am not getting the intended results.

I will keep on trying as clearly I'm the weakest link in this process.

Anyhow, as sumr4ndomguy also suggested; perhaps it would be a good idea to up all the nxp expansions; or failing that, at least those 'hard to find' ones?  I myself only have the ones readily available on tpb...

It's good of you to monitor and provide support to us plebs who have dl'ed your ups.  Cheers"
,fschd1,2010-05-06T03:16Z,"you could try looking for this

refx nexus (whole bundle) 16 gb"
,fschd1,2010-12-13T01:56Z,@ sumr4ndomguy you better word4knslim or you ae gona wait a long time finding what you are looking fori cant post those .nxp files for obvious reasons... seek and thee shall find
,fschd1,2010-12-13T02:09Z,@iamnotcoollll for this to work you need to have nexus 2.2.0.0 installed then import all oficial nexus 1.41 .nxp packs thats all the official nexus 1.41 packs into nexus 2.2.0.0 and drop these presets into nexus presets folder and hey they should now work.

,EdmAddict,2011-08-07T12:32Z,"Hello and thanks for sharing. Just installed RefX Nexus 2.2.x.x.x (Probably zeroes those numbers), but these presets wont even show up in Nexus... I didn't have nexus 1.x.x.x.x before on this computer, so i started with the 2.2.

Anyways i down loaded the other xp-pack, and those idn't work either.

Any ideas?"
