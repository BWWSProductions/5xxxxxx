[V],80zforever,2010-01-01T03:03Z,"papanko not a problem at all. You might not know but I love many of the modern synthpop bands like Perfidious Words, Mesh, !distain, The Dignity of Labour, Iris, Bit Pixel, Eloquent, Conetik, Faith Assembly, Blind Passengers, Apoptygma Berzerk, Silence Gift etc. So now off to your torrent. thanks for pointing me to it. Sounds like a great mix! cheers"
,glock31ca,2010-01-01T04:03Z,"Likewise, thanks for all the work bringing so many virtually unknown or forgotten and unavailable albums to light."
,BenHardn,2010-01-01T04:19Z,"It feels like coming home, to Fireflys and laughing Tigers. Thanks a lot for this one Bro. ;-))"
[V],80zforever,2010-01-01T04:40Z,"glock31ca, you're welcome and have a wonderful new year.

BenHardn same wishes for you. Now I see someone who has a good taste in goth stuff lol It's sad B.F.G has remained so obscure, It's plain sad."
,Punkturednoize,2010-01-01T12:29Z,"What a way to start 2010. Thanks for the upload 80'z. Speaking of the 80's, it's now been 30 years since 80's began but it's still feels like it just started specially when I see a new upload from you. Thanks."
,erikphnx,2010-01-01T14:44Z,Thank you. Great LP cover for Single Bullet Theory. Happy New Year!
,white_arcades,2010-01-03T00:33Z,"Cheers Dan, you do right. Regards contemporary synth, have you ever checked out Leiahdorus on the Different Drum label? Their debut album ""Ashes Ashes"" was a beauty."
,winkiegonad1,2010-01-04T00:15Z,"A big thanks a lot for all these old 80's albums 80zforever! You're an absolute bloody legend!! It's amazing to find some of my old fave albums here. It's a good trip down memory lane..and of course a voyage of doscovery with most of the stuff that I didn't get to listen to or own back then.

I was just wondering, do you have anything by Vicious Pink and the Explorers?. "
,brickinthewall,2010-01-04T02:55Z,"Happy New Year 80z

So far I've downloaded up to part 70 or so, and The Comateens, Tuxedomoon/Blaine L. Reininger, etc. I've recently discovered have become all time favorites.

Which bands/torrents would you recommend that sound like these artists?"
,rtrifunov,2010-01-05T22:51Z,"Happy new year 80z.
Thanx for your good work once again. Keep the pace, you're the best."
,JonYo,2010-01-09T04:27Z,80zforever FTW!
,smucktor,2010-01-11T22:10Z,"80zforever, thank you for all this amazing deeds of a true poet (the poetic way of existence meaning that those who adopt it are the keepers of the lore, of the genealogies and of rare knowledge).

like I told you another time, I am from Romania and I was born in 78 (so that makes me another great product that developed in the 80z - applause, laughs, the Nobel prize for exquisite jokes). We scarcely had any alternative when it came not only to entertainment, but to options of life. I remember listening together with my brother (born in 1970 and a more proggressive-oriented dude) every saturday night to Radio Free Europe, as they used to feed us on some of the ""other music"" (more Tangerine Dream, Pink Floyd, Jeff Wayne, Kraftwerk, true, but sometimes they aired more ""popy"" and ""wavy"" stuff) and we sure thought about ourselves as ""dissidents"", go figure!
so I want to say that I always felt something missing from my youngest years. a kind of soundtrack to life. other than the horrible hymns sung for the glory of the Party and the President and the Red Shitty Death (sorry, angers takes me away and I am a poor anger manager). as a child I always sung when doing things. but none of my tunes seemed to really fit into life. I am not a full grown adult from an emotional point of view and I am not ashamed of that (just sad). and now, with your help, I really feel as though I am putting all the puzzle pieces in their place. I have the soundtrack to my youth and let me tell you, re-living some moments on this background sure makes them fell... defferent. feel real. 
for giving back some of the years I hated thinking about, I say thank you, SIR, and I am forever in your debt! this is so important to me that it sounds really stupid, corny, whatever. but like I said, I was alone back then. my brother was alone too. we were all alone and some of us did a poor job in putting their solitudes together.

PS -please accept my apologies for not thanking you on each torrent I feed on (all of yours, I guess), but I am somewhat ashamed of my English and my sentimental uncontrolled trips. I guess I am not very well-adapted to this world of ""quick-thinking"" (nor are the most of todays musicians, since everyday I can spot on the radio a tune which uses a beat, a rhyme, or even many measures from obscure 80z songs - which is not bad at all, because those who know better, sure do get a better taste). once again, THANK YOU, SIR!"
,lixivium,2010-01-24T17:35Z,"You are the best!
Thank you!"
[V],80zforever,2010-01-31T18:40Z,"smucktor, it's very kind of you. Thanks for taking the time and writing it."
,Carcharoth,2010-02-11T00:25Z,"Thanks for all the uploads! If you enjoy modern synth-based music, might I point you in the direction of Alice in Videoland, Absurd Minds, and the now sadly defunct Echo Image?"
,smurphyzeke,2011-03-05T01:54Z,Thanks 
,hellfest,2012-01-26T11:59Z,hey 80z Do you have stuff simliar to fad gadget and eleven pond?
