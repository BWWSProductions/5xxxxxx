Another day another movie from VoMiT. This one looks pretty good with decent ratings around the usual traps. Can tell this is a VoMiT flick by the perfect quality.



Synopsis: Diane Ford (Michelle Monaghan), a vivacious and successful independent truck driver, leads a carefree life of long-haul trucking, one night stands and all-night drinking with Runner (Nathan Fillion, Serenity, Waitress, â€œCastleâ€) until the evening her estranged 11-year-old son, Peter (Jimmy Bennett, young James Kirk in Star Trek) is unexpectedly dropped at her door.

Peter hasnâ€™t seen his mother since he was a baby and wants to live with Diane as little as she wants him, but they are stuck with each other â€“ at least for now, while his father Len (Benjamin Bratt) is in the hospital. Burdened with this new responsibility and seeing the life of freedom sheâ€™s fought for now jeopardized, Diane steps reluctantly into her past and looks sidelong at an uncharted future that is not as simple or straightforward as she had once believed possible.
