[V],twentyforty,2010-01-03T23:31Z,"htctouch, concerning subs, look at ""Up in the..."" answer."
,htctouch,2010-01-03T23:39Z,sir i already searched the subs on comman sites but thr r no english subs avlbl .. thts y i askd out in the topic if some one hv d subtitle file 
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-04T06:40Z,"@hitman02021980: Nope, sorry, mainly because the reason for RERIP wasn't quality - BUT custom quant. matrices and qpel, which prevents playback on standalones. I do not need to look for that.
Yeah, I am quite sure that new rerip of 1.4 GB is better and Clooney fans may get excited about. But movie as movie doesn't need that, it is not some epic movie or masterpiece.

@htctouch: LOL, again... now do you expect subtitles the same day movie gets released? You must wait for day, three or up to week."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-04T07:23Z,"@htctouch: You haven't look hard enough. I found dozen of subs for Uni.Sold.Regen.
on podnapisi dot net by doing plain Search.

You must rename
Universal.Soldier.Regeneration.2009.DVDSCR-CM8.srt
in
Universal.Soldier.Regeneration.DVDSCR.H264[PC.Mac.Xbox.PS3.ipod].srt

and sub is automatically loaded by VLC player, MediaPlayer Classic and mplayer. I tried and subtitle is good even if that one has been made for CM8 screener.
Same ""rule?for changing the name of the sub should be always applied."

[V],twentyforty,2010-01-05T10:35Z,"Hey, IF subtitles are available  on www I usually mux them in mp4. Use VLC player.
