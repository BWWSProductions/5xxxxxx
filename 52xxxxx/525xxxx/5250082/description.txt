Courage in Red S01E06 - Police Dog Services (aka K9)

This 13 part series goes behind closed doors to reveal many aspects of the RCMP. These aspects include: protecting schools, cadet training, peacekeeping, ERT, remote policing, drug labs, youth policing, frontline policing, VIPs etc.


Episode Info: For a police dog and his handler every day on the job is different, unpredictable and guaranteed to be interesting. This episode takes us to the West coast where we get to follow an experienced team on their patrols, get an intimate view of the relationship between dog and handler, and witness the unique situations they encounter every day. We also visit the Police Dog Services Training Centre in Alberta where these canine heroes are bred and trained.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion.
