That's nonsense.  This is a pretty good documentary series, not perfect, but better than usual when it comes to UFOs.  No, it isn't zealot-candy, it is critical at times, but that's a good thing.  I didn't really agree with the Betty and Barney Hill treatment but most of the time it levied criticism when it should have.  But anyway, you shouldn't ""believe"" in anything."
