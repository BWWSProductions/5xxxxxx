Good website for 1.12.1 classic play
no boosted xp or loot
committed staff"
,joonior83,2010-11-28T09:08Z,"Wow yeah this works perfectly. Only issue is the servers are set for more xp than normal, but I guess that's normal since most of us just wanna get high level and pvp :-P

Anyways, thanks for the up, Vanilla. Works well with no issues.

FYI for those just downloading, there is a realmlist.wtf file you need to edit with notepad to make sure it's set for whatever server you register.

Mine looks like:

SET REALMLIST logon.vanillagaming.org

So just register at the site, change that file to match above, and then play!"
