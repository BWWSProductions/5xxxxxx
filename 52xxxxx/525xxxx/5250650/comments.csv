Im a big fan of your work gopo, high quality uploads and small file sizes, that's what i've been looking for :)

The movie is a classic everyone should give it a try!"
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-12T22:39Z,"I will ask everyone who downloaded any of my movies and liked the quality to give them +1 quality because I saw some movies with a lot of thanks comments and -1-2 quality.That's just retarded if you ask me...so remember,+1 if you like the quality. "
