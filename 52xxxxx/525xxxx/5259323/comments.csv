,aarque,2010-01-07T14:45Z,"Ya I don't understand the 0 seeders, I think the system changed since TPB started the magnet links. There was one seeder at one point and I have had my bit torrent client open since I originally uploaded it. So if anyone has been trying for a reasonable duration and hasn't gotten this yet, I will start another."
,737freak,2010-01-07T21:16Z,"Thank you so much for this upload! I've been waiting for this for so long. But the first few minutes, the speed was 480 Kb/s, but now I'm stuck at 76% and the speed is zero... Can somebody please seed? I'm trying to seed but the speed is only 
6 Kb/s :S
Req: Aerosoft Mega Airport Amsterden, when it's released ;P"
