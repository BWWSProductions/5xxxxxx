DVDRip of the BBC episode of Sherlock Holmes in 1968. These were both in Season 2, episode 6. This is only one of six episodes that survived. Once I have enough seeders, I'll upload the others. 

The dead body of grumpy Bill McCarthy is found, brained with a rock, and his son James, with whom he did not get on, is arrested. James' girl-friend approaches Holmes, who discovers that Bill's dying words were nothing to do with "a rat" but concerned with the days of the Australian Gold Rush, decades earlier.
