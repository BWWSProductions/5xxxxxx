Laura Solon Talking And Not Talking - Series 03 - Audio Comedy - BBC Radio 4 via DVB-T 
6 x 30 Minute Episodes - 128Kbps - Mp3 - Slimoo


Radio sketch show starring Laura Solon. With virtually no recurring characters each episode is made up from unique bittersweet character monologues and cuttingly modern sketches.

With characters ranging from infuriating call-centre staff, drunk mothers intent on ruining everyone else's Christmas and recently deposed ex-Soviet tyrants trying to settle in the British suburbs, Laura turns the things that most irritate people into sharply observed and occasionally surreal comic gems.

www.comedy.co.uk Review: 
A very strong sketch show which gives you no chance to get bored - not only are things conducted at a fast pace, but there are virtually no recurring characters or situations.
