,dizzycactus,2010-02-04T00:36Z,thanks just one thing there are very few bands that have THE in front of their name.i think THE THRILLS are the only ones that are listed in uk hit singles books with THE in their name. it's a common mistake that a lot of young people make these days. THE BOW WOW WOW? THE UB40? THE ADAM AND THE ANTS? don't even sound same.... simples
