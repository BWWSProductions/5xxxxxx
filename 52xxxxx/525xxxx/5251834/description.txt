                    Allons-Y!                                
                    Doctor Who Confidential gets up close and  
                    personal with David Tennant as he contemplates  
                    his last days as the Doctor. On set for his  
                    final episode, his final scenes, his final  
                    words, the tenth Doctor's time has come to an  
                    end and Confidential is there to follow him  
                    every step of the way. Witnessing everything  
                    from his final showdown, his poignant goodbyes  
                    and, of course, his regeneration, this intimate  
                    account of TV history pulls out all the stops  
                    for the ultimate Doctor Who finale.
