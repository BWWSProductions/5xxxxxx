"
,Flopis,2010-01-05T22:28Z,"I liked the movie. The direction and photography are miraculous, given the poor script. The characters are mostly well portrayed, with some exceptions. The fight scenes are good, not superb because of extensive dubbing. Seagal needs to lose weight.
Some of the dialog is cute. The Russian mobster tells the cop: ""Where I come from, we f... cops in the mouth after we run out of farm animals"".
I would give it a 7. "
