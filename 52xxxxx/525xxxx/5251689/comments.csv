You should catch up and not be old fashioned. There is no reason to rar split it. Just let us have the file directly."
,jtelee,2010-01-01T22:19Z,"And you should get smarter.

Don't you know that a torrent split in rar:
- get faster
- does less damage to your hd
- your ISP doesn't ""see"" so well what you downloading..

still want more reasons, smart ass?

Your stupid remark shows why torrents are going down. 
Shut up and be thankful while you can. 

Thanks, seeder. 
Trackers should forbid torrents not split in .rar."
,Mystyk,2010-01-01T22:37Z,aaaah problem is man soooooo many scammin as*holes post rars to hide the fact they are 700m or 1.3g chunks of bullsh*t scammin virus laden FAKES that it is hard to trust rars when u talk aboot movies!! it ends up bein a wasted download as well as an attempt to hijack yer system! now rars are best....and when lookin fer programs i always look fer rars but movies have been hijacked by what is probably mpaa bastids tryin to screw with peeps! but beyond that....thanx tvteam fer an awsome show i bin waitin for with baited breath. i am canadian and it takes a while for dr who to filter over to us on tv......so i am very grateful fer this ul!!
,nie_mand,2010-01-01T22:37Z,"thx

@jtelee: nice one!

why do people even start writing a comment on a file they like to download, if they don't like the format they have to download. get it and be thankfull, or get away"
,carpenox1,2010-01-01T22:42Z,"How about only thanking the uploader and not getting in a flame war with each other?

Thanks uploader, this 2nd part looks like it's going to be amazing."
,nie_mand,2010-01-01T22:56Z,"hopefully the first line (""thx"") was enough, but yes, what realy was on my mind was:

i am from germany we only get purly dubed versions, years later, and i can't wait to see the second part, so i am so thankfull for the upload, and all people seeding, thats why i coundn't understand a comment mostly complayning. We realy depend on You recording it (thx to FoV) and shareing it (thx to TvTeam), it's not just getting it a day earlier for me. so:

thx thx thx"
,chocholoco,2010-01-01T22:58Z,"First of all, thanks to the uploaded. I'm looking forward to see this episode.

However, I find @jtelee's comment a bit confusing. Could you please elaborate? I am a bit confused about those reasons cited, and I would like to know a bit more.

How do big files ""get faster"" when split in rar files? I would have thought media files can hardly be compressed. Perhaps you mean it for a reason different than sheer file size?

How do split torrents do ""less damage to your hd""? Moreover, how does any file do any damage at all to a hard drive? If you again you mean file size, this is hardly a reason, as rar'd files have to be decompressed before use, therefore making you have two copies of the file (the compressed and the uncompressed one) at least for short amount of time.

As for ISPs ""seeing"" what is being downloaded, this is deep packet inspection that we are talking about, and is far from trivial for them. I doubt there is much an ISP can see about what your torrent contains. It any rate, it's enough (and simpler) for them to just know that you are downloading a torrent, what torrent, and where from. Rar won't save you from that.

Of course, I may be very mistaken. Please let us know a bit more, or point us to relevant links where we can get better insight on this topic.

Oh, and there is no reason to be impolite :-) @aggologgo could have improved his wording a bit, but still didn't insult anybody."
,oggologgo,2010-01-01T23:02Z,"jtelee, you are clearly retarded.

not one of the reason you provided were true. Nothing but a load of BS passed around by ignorant people (like you) who don't know what they are talking about.

""- get faster""
""- does less damage to your hd""

WTF! What a load of bull. It doesn't even make sense. It's the EXACT same speed! and if anything, it does MORE damage to your harddisk, although the damage done in either case is COMPETELY irrelevant.

""- your ISP doesn't ""see"" so well what you downloading..""

Now you are just stupid. They see it just as little or as much, and I don't give a shit if they see it anyway.

What a small brain one must have to think it's more secure. It's just as easy for anyone wanting to find out what it is, as it is for you.

And do you really think it's difficult to figure out what a rar file called ""doctor_who_2005.the_end_of_time_part_two_2010_special.hdtv_xvid-fov.r01"" is?

Damn you are dumb.

Now don't get started on rar-fix. That is the most retarded myth ever.

1 - There will not be any errors. torrents are already downloaded in blocks, and blocks are automatically redownloaded if there are errors, without you ever noticing.
2 - Any error in a rar file, ONLY happens because it was rar packed in the first place.

So no, there is not one single good reason to rar split, and you just proved that people are only doing it because they either are stuck in old ways from the 90s, or because they are ignorant fools who believe in myths (like you)."

,nie_mand,2010-01-01T23:19Z,"as the flamewar is on: i like people sucked in the 90s, they don't care about the best way to share, they just share

,PI22,2010-01-01T23:31Z,"I agree that people must stop to chop up the stuff they are sharing into .rar bits. It absolutely makes no sense. And indeed, virusses can easily be packed in rars, that's why people tend to avoid rars, which is bad for 'the business' :)"
,jtelee,2010-01-01T23:58Z,"""- your ISP doesn't ""see"" so well what you downloading..""

yes I mean packet inspection for traffic shaping, for example.

""- get faster""
""- does less damage to your hd""

These two should have been actually together - it means it requires much less read/write effort to locate a missing block in smaller file, with significant increases in overall speed for large files.

As for the insultuous verbosity, it gets no response.

This matter is closed as so many people take things for granted.. If things split in rar are so outdated, etc, why the releasers keep making the initial releases like that? 
Nobody wonders why?

Well thanks again for the nice upload. :)"
,Mystyk,2010-01-02T00:26Z,now...the reason i seem to member fileslittin started was to break sh*t up into disk size peices. 1.44m at first(at least that is how it was when i dl'ed ma first 14 disk set of metaltech earthseige off ma fav BBS) then the net happened....and then was kinda 'standerdsized' to 15m chunks when the whole par thing took off....wow ancient history now i guess!! LMAO but par files usta SAVE all our old pirate as*es when usin newsgroups and mirc. now thangs kinda self check wich makes that all kinda useless. but when dl'ing official releases it is nice to see it all in its regulation size with a sfv file to check with gives me a lil warm chill of happiness...tho dont mean much these days with all the fakirs out there LOL and i still like rars cuz ive had a couple of unfortunate things happen from dl'ing direct to hd of files....they(especially music files) fix there atributes so they cant be removed....an amatuers mistake or malitious?? dont know....but like to manage rar files maself instead of direct files....EXCEPT movies(all video) so there is the ancient history lessons fer those who care....otherwise...ENJOY YER DR WHO!! LOL it wont be out here in  canada fer a month. guess its good thang aboot bein commenwealth country and not germany! LOL
,oggologgo,2010-01-02T00:42Z,"jtelee, still pure nonsense. Not one valid reason from you.

- ""If things split in rar are so outdated, etc, why the releasers keep making the initial releases like that?""

Because people from the scene are stubborn. It's pure tradition.

If you want to know, the real reasons for rar splitting, which are not really valid anymore, are as follows:

1 - Because it is intended to also be distributed through other networks, such as newsgroups, where files have to be smaller.
2 - Because the uploader might have uploaded it to a seedbox using ftp, where errors could occur.

They are quite outdated. The most valid is the ftp reason.

Some people like it so they can partseed, but again, it's only because they don't know how easy it actually is to partseed without it being split.

But the real reason it's still being done, is purely because of tradition. The scene knows this method is obsolete, but are just sticking with old tradition.

Let's not forget who started being rude for no reason. You did. You tried to be a smartass and was very rude, but it turned out that you didn't know what you were talking about."

,nie_mand,2010-01-02T01:18Z,"@PI22

filesharing is older than the world wide web, and even simple things like filenames have a history. But the real thing is filesharing that was done by peaple who knew each other by nick, no leaches, no complaynes, just some people building a comunity, setting up rules, keeping them, and making it a way of live. u might not rememder or know these times, but most of what was done thoses times is a tradition now. and if fileSHARING isn't about thoses that started giving, and those thet followed, then it is about taking, and only tking dosn't work.

we live in difrent times now, but filesharing is based on tradition, and it will fall apard as soon as it gets a way of serving ur own purpose."

Nonsense. Sticking with tradition is like being stuck in the stone age with no evolution.

OK, dear chap, I exactly know what you mean. Although I was a bit mystified and had some trouble to find the relation with the .rar thing context. Never mind.

O, yeah! I was the kind of guy that owned a computer, partly home made, and a C-64 before everybody else. This was the era where PCs were just born and very boring with green, amber or white text displays.
We shared software by jumping on bikes with our cassette recorders and get fresh air and healthy bodies in the process, and make new real flesh and blood friends.

,jtelee,2010-01-02T02:07Z,"oggoogle,

actually I do know what I am talking about.

Your 2 reasons are correct, and strictly from the point of view of pragmatism the usage of .rar files is outdated. 

However, about three years ago I gave myself some time and even built a few spreadsheets with evolution of CPU usage, hd usage and got these trends below:

1) on downloading straight .avi/iso/dmg files, cpu/hd usage would fly up;
2) my then ISP started to practice traffic shaping - prioritizing my bandwidth according to the data that was being transfered.

I covered extensively the environmental variables along with some colleagues of mine made identical tests in order to protest with the ISP.  These are my grounds for what I stated.

""You should catch up and not be old fashioned. There is no reason to rar split it. Just let us have the file directly.""

You know, this doesn't seem like a nice thanks to the uploader, seems more like you were saying you're the man. 
The uploader is sharing and you even call him outdated, man?? Come on .. are you some sort of torrent-quality-policeman or what? 
Haven't you written it in that pretentiously magnanimous way I'd haven't even bothered to comment on it.

Anyway, the upload rocks, the quality is very fine and had a great moment with the Doctor. :)"
