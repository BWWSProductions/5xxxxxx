,zzzzdin,2010-01-24T05:33Z,"OMG, very quick download!"
,dave359,2010-01-28T20:04Z,"This is a good download, but I caution it.

The audio tracks are all encoded with too much MP3 compression - the soundwave is peaking and causing distortion on louder parts of the songs (especially I See You) and as a result sounds such as the Kick drum appear distorted."
,dave359,2010-01-28T20:07Z,"Addendum: If you're just playing this through an MP3 player with headphones, you won't notice it too much - if it's running through Pro Audio equipment, that's where the distortions tend to appear.

I do like the fact that music video is included here - good work katrutube."
