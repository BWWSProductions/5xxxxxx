In 1981 Alice Cooper shot a TV Special in Paris for the french audience. It`s never been aired in the UK or US. This scarce program is now available on DVD.
Basically the show starts out as a series of "videos" for tracks from "Flush The Fashion" and "Special Forces" albums plus some older classics. This exceptional show was recorded in Paris in December 1981 just before the start of the "Special Forces"european tour. All the first songs of this broadcast were filmed in several characteristic and typically touristic places of the french city : le SacrÃ©-Coeur church (Montmartre district), la Rue Saint-Denis (the hot district), Pigalle (the Moulin Rouge district), the George Pompidou Museum also called Centre Beaubourg etc... Other places of shootings were however less conventional : a breakage of cars in border of the ring road (peripheral), in the parisian subway or in famous "Abattoirs de La Villette" (slaughterhouse) which ought to become later a cultural park in Paris.
Shots would have been made in the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral but they finally didn't appear in the show. Maybe it was about the song "Go To Hell", finally shot at the SacrÃ© CÅ“ur church. 
After a brief and hilarious Alice's self interview (where Vincent Damon Furnier meets Alice Cooper !) the show is changing into a live in the studio setting for the second half. Some of the old tracks were re-recorded for the special. This second part of "Alice Cooper in Paris" was shot in the television studios of Boulogne and offers for the occasion some Alice Cooper's classics "live".
The sound recording of the performance was made on the spot, then Alice Cooper and Special Forces' band made a very funny playback on these recordings ("School's Out" take is really a must !).
The versions of all these Alice Cooper's Special Forces songs remain thus officially unreleased to this day in any format. The Alice Cooper show was aired on the french channel then called Antenne 2 (today France 2) in 1982 on the 14th of january. The show was presented within the very first broadcast of the famous french TV show "Les Enfants Du Rock".
