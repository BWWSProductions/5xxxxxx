,matttyger,2010-01-03T22:31Z,"It's season finale, I don't think it's the series finale.

Fnx eztv for the up!"

Season One had 22 episodes, and the ratings were phenomenal according to Cartoon Network. Season 2 should have at least this many, unless Lucas Animation decided to cut the season length down to 12 episodes. However, because of the popularity of the show among youth ages 12-17, as well as young adults ages 18-24, Season Two should follow the pattern of Season One. Not to mention the fact that Season 2 has been absolutely kickass. Even TV Critics are raving."
