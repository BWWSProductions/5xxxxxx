,potangbengi,2010-01-07T03:23Z,anybody noticed that a/v is out of sync?audio is delayed by 3ms.anybody having the same problem?
,kimahri---1980,2010-01-07T15:58Z,"Thanks Secret! Great video quality. Although the audio is slightly out of sync. First I thought it was my pc it's getting quite old, but then I read the above comments. I must say I first noticed the audio delay after 30 mins. It's hardly noticeble but once you have.... well enough said. The video quality is SUPERB on the other hand so I won't download an other 264 rip, but I will rather try to fix this audiotrack.

(Any help would be apreciated)"
,potangbengi,2010-01-07T18:06Z,"kimahri---1980/ bro,please give me a heads up when you find a solution for syncing a/v.i tried avidemux with no success.thanks."

,Yittle,2010-01-08T04:38Z,"Secret_myth, I havent left any comments till now and wanted to say a big thank you for the wonderful work you do.  Before I ever get a movie, I look and wait till you have it.  The wait has always been well worth it. There is one movie I have been looking for and having a hard time finding.  Could you please upload ""The Road"" with Viggo Mortensen in it.  Also would love ""Legion"" and "" The Book Of Eli"" if you have them.  They look like awesome movies.  Again a big thank you in advance."
,T-Fish,2010-01-09T00:42Z,"good movie, good rip and the audio is NOT out of sync. its perfectly fine!"
,anyeuha_80,2010-01-09T15:27Z,"Great film, thanks so much! Heeheee"
,toycartel,2010-01-09T18:47Z,Ok the problem I am hving is for the xbox when I use yamb to create the 2 channel audio when i click on the two channel file and then you have to unclick the 6 channel the 2 channel is also 6 channel! does that make since. so in the file the 2 channel when clicked on is really a 6 channel too! so I cant paly it on my xbox! it seems like it may be an easy fix but i think secretmyth would have to do it on his end! is anyone else having this problem? all the other ones are working fine! secret myth is the only person I get movies from! so If he dont post it i dont watch it! eveytime i try to get one from someone else it always causes problems! and he always does the 2 channel for us xbox users! So Thank you!

,Lennie690,2010-01-14T02:18Z,"Great rip as usual but the Audio 2ch supplied in the folder is in fact a 126 Kbps 6ch Audio file and therefore the XBOX/PS3 process doesn't work!!
Any chance of uploading the 2ch Audio track please?"
,joyrideracing,2010-01-16T03:38Z,"hey secret, thanks for the great uploads.  Can you please re-up the 2 channel audio for xbox? The 2 channel audio file in the torrent is in fact 6 channel. "
,waynebmw,2010-01-18T21:36Z,"Myth , Where can I find Transylmania 2009? and thanks for the upload"
,honzas7,2010-01-20T22:24Z,Hi. Thanks a lot. Does someone know how to make the MP4 file playable on PS3 with subtitles please?
,Mokoko34,2010-01-28T03:09Z,"@honzas7, unfortunately you cannot make the MP4 files play with subtitles on the PS3, you would have to convert it to an AVCHD on DVD or USB stick. Videohelp.com has plenty or links on how to do this. 

Video quality is superb like any other SecretMyth release but I have to agree that the audio was slighly off in this release. Easily fixable with YAMB or MKVMerge. A delay of minus -300ms is enough to bring it into perfect sync. 
For those that say it is fine then I'm glad you enjoyed it. "
,Superman169,2010-02-13T08:22Z,Thank you very much you are simply the best
,Superman169,2010-02-14T08:54Z,"not sure if its me or not, im pretty sure its not me but when i take the 6 channel off with yamb and add the 2 channel its actually just another 6 channel, i had downloaded this once and took care of it and tried to play it on my 360 but it wouldnt play so i re downloaded it and thats when i found the second 6 channel, it would be nice to know how to convert the 6 channel to 2 channel myself so not to bother Secret with this little stuff maybe someone will let me know of such a program until then i will keep searching thanks Secret your awesome u r still my #1 source"
,guddu88,2010-04-16T22:45Z,excellent quality as usual !
