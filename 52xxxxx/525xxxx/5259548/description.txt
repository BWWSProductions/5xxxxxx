Storyline: Two crew members are stranded on a spacecraft and quickly - and horrifically - 
realize they are not alone. Two astronauts awaken in a hyper-sleep chamber aboard a seemingly abandoned spacecraft. It's 
pitch black, they are disoriented, and the only sound is a low rumble and creak from the belly of the ship. They can't 
remember anything: Who are they? What is their mission? With Lt. Payton staying behind to guide him via radio transmitter, 
Cpl. Bower ventures deep into the ship and begins to uncover a terrifying reality. Slowly the spacecraft's shocking, deadly 
secrets are revealed...and the astronauts find their own survival is more important than they could ever have imagined.
