              Release Date....: 2010.01.04
              Genre...........: Comedy

       One-off period comedy, peeping into the lives of a south Wales 
       family's Christmases across the 1980s, written by comedian Mark 
       Watson and inspired by a Dylan Thomas short story. Christmas in 
       this household may be a less than poetic affair, but it is just as 
       eventful. So much changes across a decade in any family, and yet 
       so much manages to remain the same.


       Note: I tried to get this in HD, but ther was a glitch that 
       resulted in a few minutes of missing video, no HD reruns scheduled.


                             Big up all scene massive!
