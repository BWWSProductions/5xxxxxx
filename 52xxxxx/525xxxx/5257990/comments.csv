,pamona,2010-01-04T21:03Z,"I AM seeding, there are already 3 downloads completed, and the download is still running with 80kb's/sec. Still piratebay shows 0 seeders and 0 leechers!! I think that there is something rotten in the state of Denmark, eh...sorry, Sweden"
,pamona,2010-01-04T22:32Z,"Update Âą 1 hour later: now there are 6 seeders and 4 leechers, and still Piratebay shows two times 0. Maybe it would be nice if somebody who has completed the download, to tell so. Than I(we) aresure that Piratebay isn't working properly."
