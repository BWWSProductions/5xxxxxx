,LegacyX24,2010-01-03T04:01Z,Let me know if this method works to get this latest patch installed and working =)
,Lenoir333,2010-01-07T09:43Z,"Worked like a charm, my AVG didn't find anything, got it in under 1minute. I'm definitely seeding. I've got the latest patch in the following way: got razor's iso and keys, installed, updated to 1.8 through sims3 launcher(it won't work if you crack the game first, you have to crack it AFTER you update it) and then replaced the original TS3.exe with this one. For me, it works without any problems. I don't know how it will work with WA, because i don't have it and I'm not interested. Good luck!"

mine crashes too, anyone know how to fix this problem, does installing the patch help?"
,glasswings21,2010-01-25T19:12Z,Well the without error crashing issue is related to GPU overheating its been happening around i mean when you're graphics adapter gets kinda hot or something it shuts off to prevent any damages and there goes the game it was happenin to me too until i got a better powered power supply and no more GPU overload and works fine.
,Blackbyrd,2010-01-27T23:28Z,Doesn't work just makes my game crash. POS!
,kurangel,2010-02-07T06:13Z,"Sorry if this is something I should be getting on my own. I got it and it works fine but my custom content isn't showing up in the game. Is anyone else having this issue?
The torrent works great I just don't have any custom stuff in my game."
,skullos,2010-09-03T18:47Z,"@Lenoir333 Same over here, works great and I can just play the game without a disc which is really nice :P"
