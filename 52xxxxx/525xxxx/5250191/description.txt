This is a discography of Poets of the Fall, a great band from Helsinki, Finland. They are relatively unknown in the US but all three of their albums were #1 in Finland. The first two albums are 320 kb/s and ripped from a CD. Their CD's are about $50 each cause they have to be inported so I didn't get revolution Roulette yet. However I got it for $7.99 on Amazon as an MP3 download. The quality is just over 256 kb/s,  and each song varies a little bit. Still sounds great though, and enjoy this torrent. Here's the track list:
