When her father presented her he used the word (not name) pocahontas, meaning ""spoiled brat"". She never fell in love with anybody, though she was taken from her tribe to England and married Rolfe. She was given and went because such arranged marriages were common among native nations as political moves, just as they became in Europe.

As for ""New World"", when the barbarian tribes that were to become Europeans were still buggering each other to indicate dominance, on this continent the Anasazi had already come and gone, and the next civilization, the Hopi had already traveled to all reaches of the continent we call Turtle Island. Before the proto-Europeans even had an inkling what a continent was, the Hopi had traveled to the Bering land bridge from THIS side, met the Di'ne/De'ne (the future Navajo) coming across it, and documented the event. Of all the continents, Europe is the newest in terms of developing civilizations aware of their place on this planet."

LIAR!"
,puppyup,2010-12-31T08:27Z,mkvonly doesn't know what a BRrip is. How could this dork get a skull?
,osriccc,2011-05-31T23:14Z,"Ok, this is 480p but indeed is a BRIP because of the image being very sharp. The best copy (considering the size of the file...) you can get if you want to watch the movie right away."
,frogshare,2011-06-06T15:18Z,"As for size/quality, this is the best copy."
,k3nd00d,2011-06-29T12:09Z,"Idiots. BRRip simply indicates it is ripped from blu-ray, I have BRRips I have encoded down to 480x208 mp4/m4v to play and look nice yet be small file size on my Android phone. If you don't know anything, then shut up. BRRip or DVDRip is not an indication of the file size, resolution, quality or aspect ratio of a ripped video."
,schnitzelburger,2012-02-04T10:30Z,"Hello fucking idiots.
BDRip = ripped from BluRay-Disc.
BRRip = ripped from BluRay-Rip.
An important difference. BRRip is NOT ripped directly from the disc. It's actually a rip from a rip."
