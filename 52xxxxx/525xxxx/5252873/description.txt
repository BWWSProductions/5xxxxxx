I upload the same file that http://thepiratebay.org/user/void_bamboozle/ uploaded: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4723812/FileMaker_Pro_Advanced_v10.0.1_MULTiLANGUAGE-CYGiSO- but i delete the file infected setup.exe in the root directory and create a new .ISO disk image.

I have not tried it because it's for a friend and i am a Mac user, i hope it works fine.

Please continue seeding. I would appreciate comments.
