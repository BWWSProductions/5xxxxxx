,EdyK9,2011-10-25T17:51Z,"Clean and working great on Windows7! 
- mount with PowerIso
- go to 'Autorun\autorun.exe', select first option to start instal
- use serial (is in CYGiSO folder, readme.txt):334K9-3M6VX-NN76M-79M64-6XN3X-4J8JK-64K38 , and instal
- it wil ask to instal 'Bonjour Printer Wizard', accept.
  I blocked the access to internet, I personally do not like to leave pirated programs to access the internet."
,filebrary,2012-07-18T13:13Z,"Thanks nuvolet for this CLEAN upload. It works great. Also thanks to EdyK9 for your explanations and advice. ... I could not get to work the ""Autoplay"" though. ... So I directly used the ""Setup"" application in the ""Files"" map. I extracted the ISO using Winrar."
