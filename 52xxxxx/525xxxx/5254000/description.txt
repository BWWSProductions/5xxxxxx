Jack Wilkins is an excellent guitarist deserving of wider recognition.  This 1992 CTI release might get overlooked by hard bop fans because of producer Creed Taylor's tendency to either over-produce a session or turn it into commercial pabulum, but this out of print CD is worth acquiring.  "Dailey Double," written by pianist Albert Dailey, is an up-tempo blues with a Latin kick.  The guitarist's lyricism comes to the forefront during a brisk reading of "You Must Believe in Spring" and a rather brief "My Foolish Heart," featuring the leader on solo acoustic guitar.  Phil Woods makes a guest appearance on Wilkins' swirling bop composition "Captain Blued" and also bassist Harvie Swartz's "Opal," stealing the spotlight on both tracks.  Chick Corea's "Captain Marvel" is a miniature that features Wilkins with guest guitarist Carl Barry.  A very enjoyable outing. ~ Ken Dryden, AMG
