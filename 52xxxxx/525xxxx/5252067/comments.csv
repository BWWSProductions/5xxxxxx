,grash54,2010-01-02T08:26Z,It is real.  The size is 160x112.  Don't look too bad if you can watch something this small.  Increasing size decreases quality.  Very dark and LOTS of flicker. I give it v3-a4 @ it's 160x112 size.  Not really very watchable imho.
,seasame,2010-01-02T14:44Z,"if you ask me, its better to wait for a better copy. this is very hard to watch, sorry uploader. i dl-ed all of them and ql is the same - awful. "

,Barnzito,2010-01-06T04:33Z,"Im not about to complain about the free download of a film which isn't widely available.
However 5/10 for the video is being just a little bit too kind. The picture cannot be enlarged to the maximum and at certain parts there is nothing but dark shadows on the screen.
Despite this the audio is hearable and the story can be followed if watched very closely.
Not an enjoyable experience.

A - 5
V - 2.5"
