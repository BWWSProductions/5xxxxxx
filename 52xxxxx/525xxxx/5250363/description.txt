Sometimes, time is the best judge of a film, and different from what happened to "Jesse James", which aged considerably, this sequel seems better than ever. Fritz Lang made two unconventional westerns, this one and "Rancho Notorious". In both films he did not follow the usual standards. The best moments here take place in court, where Frank is being judged, by a very partial jury, where even the judge was an ex confederate officer. Henry Hull gives quite a performance, whereas in "Jesse" he kept repeating himself. Gene Tierney is excellent as the young reporter who is almost a "fan" of Frank James. But the great actor here is Henry Fonda as Frank, unforgettable.
