,psychlife,2010-07-31T13:55Z,"I have to say, this is probably the most complete Trek novel torrent I've seen. Not only does it have some of the most recent novels, the organization in the uploader's comments is impeccable, telling me what there is in what folder, how many, etc. Most of the other book torrents I've seen have no organization or very little. 

I will always seed this!"
,deuZige,2010-11-07T02:36Z,"Very very nice. If i wasn't sure before, i'm sure now: I've got everything Star Trek! Thanks a million! I'm uploading them all to my phone and spend lots of time on the toilet!"
