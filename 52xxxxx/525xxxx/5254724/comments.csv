will u b uploading Republic of Doyle"
[V],err0001,2010-01-05T16:34Z,"RoD is already on my list. Unfortunately, the list is getting pretty long and I've got so many eps of Littlest Hobo, Red Green recorded but not converted that I don't know if I'll ever catch up.

Fortunately someone is posting whole seasons of Red Green from DVDRips so I don't need to worry about those eps.

I also recorded a new CBC show last night named 18 to Life. I'm not sure what it is about, but I'll try to upload it soon if no one else does."
,cindy25,2010-01-07T00:56Z,"18 to life was ok, better than most comedy's on tv today. hope they continue to post it.  looks like they missed rod which makes no sense.  
u do a great job of filling in what they miss. "
[V],err0001,2010-01-07T02:08Z,"RoD hasn't aired yet - that is probably why they ""missed"" it.

It is on in a few hours."
,cindy25,2010-01-07T08:30Z,"my mistake; thought it was supposed to be the day b4.
anyway, the scene did post it.  "
