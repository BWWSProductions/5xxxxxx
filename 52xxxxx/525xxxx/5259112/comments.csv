,htctouch,2010-01-05T08:56Z,i have a doubt .. y some releases are named LIMITED ?? 
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-05T09:10Z,"It's so called Scene tag. Look at the name of the input. My re-encodings inherit tags.

From Scene pamphlet:
""Scene Tags:

PROPER
Due to scene rules, whoever releases the first Telesync has won that race (for example). But if the quality of that release is fairly poor, if another group has another telesync (or the same source in higher quality) then the tag PROPER is added to the folder to avoid being duped. PROPER is the most subjective tag in the scene, and a lot of people will generally argue whether the PROPER is better than the original release. A lot of groups release PROPERS just out of desperation due to losing the race. A reason for the PROPER should always be included in the NFO.

LIMITED
A limited movie means it has had a limited theater run, generally opening in less than 250 theaters, generally smaller films (such as art house films) are released as limited.

INTERNAL
An internal release is done for several reasons. Classic DVD groups do a lot of .INTERNAL. releases, as they wont be dupe'd on it. Also lower quality theater rips are done INTERNAL so not to lower the reputation of the group, or due to the amount of rips done already. An INTERNAL release is available as normal on the groups affiliate sites, but they can't be traded to other sites without request from the site ops. Some INTERNAL releases still trickle down to IRC/Newsgroups, it usually depends on the title and the popularity. Earlier in the year people referred to Centropy going ""internal"". This meant the group were only releasing the movies to their members and site ops. This is in a different context to the usual definition.

STV
Straight To Video. Was never released in theaters, and therefore a lot of sites do not allow these.

ASPECT RATIO TAGS
These are *WS* for widescreen (letterbox) and *FS* for Fullscreen.

REPACK
If a group releases a bad rip, they will release a Repack which will fix the problems.

DUPE
Dupe is quite simply, if something exists already, then theres no reason for it to exist again without proper reason.""

You'll learn. my brother."
