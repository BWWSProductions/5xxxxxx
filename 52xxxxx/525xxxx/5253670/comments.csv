,e-quity,2010-01-03T08:22Z,"Eh, give the guy a break. Obviously not UFC 108, the names are unknown (Polish I think) and definitely not on tonight's card, but it was MMA. Quick though and not very interesting, thanks anyway."
,cloughy79,2010-01-03T12:35Z,"this is KSW,its a polish MMA event. Pudzianowski for thows who dont know was world strongest man 5 times. this guy when he gets all his tool in MMA will be interesting to watch. all MMA fans should watch this fight. Pudzianowski Vs Lesner would b an interesting fight if UFC ever signed him. thanks willy5111.been looking for this fight event if it isnt UFC."
