By default, Connectify will launch itself everytime you start your PC. To disable this:

   1. Go to Control PanelSystem and SecurityAdministrative Tools and select System Configuration
   2. Click on the Startup tab
   3. Uncheck Connectify

Alternatively:

   1. Go to Control PanelSystem and SecurityAdministrative Tools and select Task Scheduler
   2. Select Connectify
   3. On the right sidebar, under Selected Item, click on Disable.

Okay... so now I want a version with no ads."
