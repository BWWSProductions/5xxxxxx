"Ain't Nothing 'Bout You" was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by A Duo Or Group With Vocal. 

Selling 22 million albums and scoring 18 #1 hits, Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn have been dominant figures in '90s ... Full Descriptioncountry music. With this album, they upped the ante for the 21st century. Enlisting hot producer Mark Wright (who has worked with Lee Ann Womack and Clint Black), the band took seven months to record STEERS & STRIPES. Instead of doing a quickie recording session then heading out on tour, Brooks & Dunn really took their time on this one, and their efforts payed off with this phenomenal country-pop crossover album. 

Trisha Yearwood lends her fabulous vocal power on "The Last Thing I Do." "The Long Goodbye" is a tug-at-your-heartstrings ballad complete with gorgeous strings. "My Heart Is Lost To You" is a pledge of love that goes in a slight Latin direction. "Lucky Me, Lonely You" is one of the few traditional country tunes on the album, as STEERS & STRIPES is dominated by country-rock/pop and tender ballads. All in all, these heartfelt tunes are some of the strongest the boys have released.
