Let's not forget that it also stars the wonderful Anna May Wong - the first Asian actress to break into the Hollywood mainstream and cross race barriers. Though she was a favourite with movie-goers, she was often paid less than her white co-stars. Wong received less than a third of Dietrich's salary for appearing in 'Shanghai Express'."

I must add that - this being the film where cinematography is the major star, especially the shades of black, and the quality of light - the copy is only ""informative"", far from the rip quality it needs."

""It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily.""

Many thanks for this!"
