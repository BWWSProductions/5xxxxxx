,XxM24Ty,2010-01-01T12:22Z,"Interesting thanks. May I asked who did the Remastering? Like, was a pet-project of the underground, or has the company actually done this?"
,OlexKi,2010-01-01T13:23Z,"XxM24Ty, you wellcome.

All work (remastering, searching and collecting songs from different bootleg recordings, e.t.c.) was made by me, with no company and\or other people. ;)"
,XxM24Ty,2010-01-01T13:25Z,"A perfect CD to add to the Beatles fan that already has all of their main stream commercial CDs. This is the additional my box set was ""looking for""! - Awesome mix and audio quality too."
,XxM24Ty,2010-01-01T13:48Z,"A BIG THANKS again OlexKi !

The more I listen, the more I like this disc. Very good quality, and the artwork is all one needs to feed Nero to print front and back covers, and with a light scribe CD and color blank HP CDs the image of the pictures of the discs can be burned into a blank. Great Job! When I seen the art work, it seemed too fancy to be made underground, and with the credits and the story on the back cover made me think it had to be company produced. Awesome job for sure, you really out did a lot of people. Gosh the record companies could take your entire project and need to make no changes before selling them at Walmart! (Shsssssh- forget I said that) lol"
,ras_yo,2010-01-01T14:17Z,Thanks for this jewel  :o)
,OlexKi,2010-01-01T14:17Z,"Thanks to all! 

I must say: I find front and back artwork at site bootlegzone[dot]com. It's not my artwork! (but I add some changes to back cover) :) 

I make only *.png CD label and, of course, the main thing - flac + cue CD image. ;)"
,dr4cul,2010-01-01T15:30Z,Many thanks OlexKi and Happy New Year!
,OlexKi,2010-01-01T15:51Z,"Oh, yes! Happy New Year to all people from all countries over the world!

P.S. Sorry, if my english is not good - I'm from Russia. ;) "
,XxM24Ty,2010-01-01T20:56Z,"Your English is likely better than mine! Thanks for the tip on that site you found the art on. Until recently I have used http://www.cdcovers.cc/ and images on Google. however it's difficult to find many, if any, bootleg art for cd or dvd there."
,XxM24Ty,2010-01-01T23:52Z,"I KNEW IT!! The Record Company IS going to RELEASE A REMASTERED BOOTLEG of HOT SUN!! Read Here: http://www.goldminemag.com/article/inside_the_making_of_the_beatles_abbey_road_part_2/

Quote: ""Apple Corps and EMI are releasing a remasterd version of the album, along with the rest of The Beatles catalog, on CD later this year.""-2009 

Which makes one wonder what the wait has been, and if THIS flac could be the source of the release when it comes out?"
,XxM24Ty,2010-01-01T23:55Z,"SORRY, MY BAD! - I mis-read the article. lol. *ahem* never-mind my last comment. ;)"
,OlexKi,2010-01-02T07:07Z,"X-D Funny mistake. 

Wow! That's an error on TheLazenby's review on back CD-cover! 'Rolling Stone' magazine is from September 17 1970, not from September 17 1969! :)"
,XxM24Ty,2010-01-02T08:02Z,"Thanks for pointing out the mistake on the back cover OlexKi. I was mainly happy to read up on the story about how this rehearsal-tape had been stolen, reported to of been zapped by X-Rays checking in/out of an Airport thus erasing the tape - As Rolling Stones had reported in 1970- (NOT 1969 as pointed out above).... Yet the recording resurfaced in 2005, and now our guy here has improved the audio quality for 2010. As one can read, I am currently a BIG Beatles FAN, however they were already playing to the boomers when I was being born. In the 1980's I bought all of The Beatles cds, and now have the entire 16 box set plus THIS cd and the 2009 Beatles DVD that comes with some box sets (maybe all have it).  

I keep watching this torrent for any new info on this CD and/or any links to other Beatles rare cds."
,OlexKi,2010-01-02T09:18Z,"So... I've just sitting and playing with artwork in Photoshop about 3 hours... and this is a result - new upgraded artwork for this bootleg, based on photo of artwork from 'JunkHeads' version:

;)"
,OlexKi,2010-01-02T09:42Z,"O-o-ops... X-D In new covers I have fixed one mistake (1970, not 1969) and make two new errors: in words 'december' and 'also'. I really need an editor to watch my work. %)"
,XxM24Ty,2010-01-02T10:23Z,"OlexKi: I really dig that pic of your art for the front cover, however I can not get your torrent to work for me. Read more on your torrent site. Maybe we are too far away. I tried all security settings on my programs, it's not my firewall nor IP blocker- and even with those both turned up to 100% I can still get all other torrents to work with ease. I re downloaded your torrent 2 or 3 times, always no download- It says it is downloaded, so I guess it connects, but no files transfer.

OK, I'll try to stay on topic better now. ;)"
,OlexKi,2010-01-02T10:59Z,"XxM24Ty, I'm just upload all covers to http://bayimg.com/ and add driect links to the top post. :)"
,XxM24Ty,2010-01-02T11:54Z,"Cool idea OlexKi. I searched on Google, and it appears the P.B. was the first place this torrent was uploaded too, but there were also about a dozen other torrent sites that put up this same exact one that you uped here. It seems your little torrent is getting the traffic. I wonder if there are nor Beatles fans than Star Trek/Stargate??

Search for this torrent name on Google. It's getting around."
,OlexKi,2010-01-02T12:48Z,"Yes, I have already know about this... my torrent was added into other trackers by automatic bot programs. It's happens with all torrents from Piratebay, I think. :) "
,toflyde,2010-01-05T11:02Z,How do i split these tracks for listening in Itunes? Do I have to burn it to a CD...? Oldie :P
,OlexKi,2010-01-10T08:12Z,You can split tracks with Exact Audio Copy program... or burn a CD and grab it ;)
