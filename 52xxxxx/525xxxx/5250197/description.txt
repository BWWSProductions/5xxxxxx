Both of Mahmoud Awad's very fucked up albums, Shiekh to the Future and Too Fast for Time.

So apparently this dude made this music in 2053 and sent it back to the past to show you what the future of music is like.  Its pretty cool, so yeah download it and seed but i will seed this forever so no worries about it being dead or whatnot (unlike my other torrents that my brother deleted excuse the deadness of those).  I'm cool like that.

Sincerely,
