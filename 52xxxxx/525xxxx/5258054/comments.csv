,josimisi,2010-01-06T08:19Z,is this worth of download? there is no cracks or other things? just pure download and install? cause i got fm2010 on cd but it needs some steam thing and asks me for cd key wich wasnt included on cd or box? so i was wondering if this is going to be the same

,callofdutymodernwarfare2,2010-05-15T14:38Z,"Thx dude for the fast speed!!! (1.5mbps)
It was done in i guess 20 minutes.
So for the guys who want to download this.
First of all download
Mount it with DAEMON TOOLS LITE.
Install it.
Choose for install with cd not for steam install or something.
(don't worry you don't need a cd)
When it's downloaden you can play it.
But when you shut off your computer and you want to play it again then it says insert a cd.
Now download the football manager 2010 no cd crack on this site.
Download the football manager patch i guess it's the 10.3 patch and the file is like 150mb.
When u have downloaded the patch , install it and it will update your game.
Then paste the no cd crack in your sports interactive-fotball manager 2010 file and it wil replace your old one.
Then u can play without inserting a cd.
Good luck.

Sorry for my bad English but i tried:)

If u follow my steps you would play it and it's not worth i think, cuz the game is very boring.
But guys good luck"
,callofdutymodernwarfare2,2010-05-15T14:40Z,"Dude it's not damaged it works.
The game works perfectly don't listen to the other guys i've downloaded this game and played for long enough, it works perfectly"
,callofdutymodernwarfare2,2010-05-15T14:41Z,"You don't need the product code just chose download with cd, you may think u need a cd for the download but you don't.
I had the same problems and i chose for download with cd and it worked.
You don't need steam for the download;)"
