What is the big fucking deal, you should have winrar installed on your computer anyway, if you don't it's free, and a very useful tool. Unless you are running on a shit computer it takes around 8 seconds....you only have to do it on the first one...the rest all extract automatically.

how could he make such a crap after lord of the rings.basically he put together ""what dreams may come""movie and some serial killer movie crap. 
he should have stay with the ""halo""movie project.
lord of the rings is one of my favorite movie,king kong wasn't bad but wasn't good either (he copied the original movie) .but this shit??!!WTF!!this movie, just gives a taste about murdering a child for some sick motherfucker out there .so fuck you peter jackson!!
i hope everyone is gonna download this movie and watch it before it comes out,so this crap doesn't make any money.
i was so interested in this movie but after this!?,peter jackson lost a fan!i think they did a Gastric bypass surgery on his brain too!..WTF!!
i need a drink,dude!

otherwise the video quality is good .8.5/10
sound is 9/10 5.1 surround.no black and white parts in this dvdscr.ps3 plays it.

,PudKat,2010-01-03T13:26Z,"Besike what kind of a fucking loser are you??  Do your research first mate, The Lovely Bones is one of the best books ever written and Peter Jackson has well and truly done it justice.  Don't stereotype a director into one genre of movie.  Yes, Lord of the Rings was great, but there is alot more to Jackson than just that.  If you don't think you're gunna like it, don't download it!"

,kbowk2,2010-01-05T08:38Z,"U want the truth about RAR FILES?  Rar is an unstoppable beast that looks like a giant insect.  We are unable to locate the rar exactly but believe it to be somewhere in Tokyo. Every time u extract a rar it feeds the Rar as it is connected to all computers using its special rar abilities.  The more rar it gets the stronger the Rar becomes.  We are part of a secret organization called PAR (ppl against Rar).  We put subliminal messages into no rar movies that tell u to hate rar files, so that u will stop extracting thus feeding the Rar.  This is y u hate rar torrents but don't rly know y.  If u keep extracting rar then the Rar will become too powerful and will awaken from it's slumber, unleashing great rar powers that can only be stopped by zipping the Rar into a great folder then sent to C:/RarWorld back to where the great Rar came from and where other Rars dwell.  If Par can find Rar before this happens then we might just be able to stop the destruction.  Hope is not lost as we now have Nickolas Cage in Par and he wears a wig to strengthen his Cage powers which also doubles as a Rardar (radar that finds Rar).   "

It was a good film in my view, ok it wasnt perfect but Im not going to rant and rave about something I havent paid for, something that kept me watching and something that I know is a lot better than most of the films being made these days.  Nice job jackson, even if it isnt your finest work, we all have different opinions of films and I for one say give it a chance... It is suprisingly dark at times but I know my girlfriend and her family will love this all the same.  Every film in the top 100s comments has some idiot swearing his dick off and ranting hate towards other people.  What is there problem, if I dont like something I dont even bother commenting, I have to much real life stuff to do with my time to spend my energy hating everything online.

This movie is actually similar to the Frighteners.  How the dead help the living, which is also a Jackson Film.  Thus. Besike is a douche and should be fed to the Rar.  I ended up feeding rar to the Rar.  My new mate Nicky C rly wanted to watch the movie so we downloaded it.  Can't believe the quality, it's so good.  fucking rar de rar.  

P.S New intelligence suggests Besike's mum is the Rar due to her body odors, insect-like-appearance and she is rly big.  

What? No I'm typing.... geez fine I'll tell them.... Nicky C also wants to apologize for Ghost Rider, but not Bangkok Dangerous, as he believes he rly is an assassin with long hair.
