Any chance you have any of Florence (flo) from the ATK older sets and videos?  I don't know exactly what it is, but Florence was one of my favorite all time models.  A few years ago I lost everything to a fire.  Computers, disks, CDs and so on.  The only thing I really want back is Flo.  If you, or anyone else, has any Flo, I would greatly appreciate it.

TIA--
Hops to all"
