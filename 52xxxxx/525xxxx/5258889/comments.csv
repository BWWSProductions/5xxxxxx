,codyo,2010-01-15T01:28Z,"@yerisan
Dude you seriously need to find something better to do with your time than bitch about torrents by drawing stupid fucking pictures. UR so 1337 dude...."
,r-man-010,2010-01-15T12:23Z,"Okay, now I can first say I really do not feel like logging into SuprBay forums and getting a new password for my old accounts, so if anyone is thinking I am some spammer with a rediculous comment, then think again. Anyone who has been with TPB for some years knows the name ReadyMan, and that is myself.

With that said I can say I have downloaded this torrent, so for those who are concerned with an honest answer from a former TPB Helper and still TPB VIP on the quality of this film, I feel I NEED to give my 2 cents.

This torrent needs to be renamed, it is not aXXo, aXXo is no longer ripping movies, therefor his name should not be re-placed in files that are not his. The tags state clearly that it is 'aXXo wannabe', this also needs to be removed. Since this is not aXXo's release himself, please remove any tag's referring to his name from this torrent, do not worry about the rername, it is quite okay to rename a torrent and label it as your own if it is not aXXo's. And I think that for the sake of popularity and 'customer support', a vast majority of the people would probably prefer if it did not have his name in it as well, since yet again, it is not his.

As far as the quality, it is a V-9 / A-9, and I will thank you for the great quality upload, because I am not one to bag on a free movie, especially one that is of good quality. It is tha aXXo name that is or may be creating a stir of madness on this torrent by some, and not the quality itself. It is a great torrent, and is worth the downlaod, I do recommentd it. Just do not expect it to be an aXXo original.

Sorry falconxx, it is not you, as you are only an uploader, not the ripper, I will fully acknowledge the quality, and assure all that it is no fake, or a dirty quality film, I am just going to say again, that you should consider renaming it, because once again it is not an aXXo release.

ThX for reading my comment, and please enjoy this torrent.

/ReadyMan"
,r-man-010,2010-01-15T12:33Z,"Lol, I almost forgot to add!

People like yerisan, whid523, kolos123 are just spamming these great torrents, I will personally report those comments in the TPB forums so that the MOD's know to remove them. The big middle finger is more or less a designated image the users post on a genuine fake, not for recreational use to bag ones disagreed torrent(s). 

And as for other posting links to where you can watch movies, let me ask what is the point? The only differnce is that on this movie, you gotta wait until it is done downloading, so please dont post links to external movie watching sites, as they will get reported, and accounts can possibly be banned.

I for one will report these comments, and if they are not removed, then so be it....but please be warned that you guys are soing the classic 'spammer' scenario, and on TPB it is not tolerated."
,Numan091,2010-01-15T13:07Z,Thanks 10 out of 10
,UnknownAlly,2010-01-19T13:14Z,"Thank you falconxx.

Video: 9.8/10
Audio 10/10

Only reason video is not a perfect 10 is because it is 592x256. When full screen, you can't even tell the difference. It's virtually perfect."

,rasungod0,2010-01-21T20:43Z,"just a pathetic attempt at attention by a low quality uploader, falconxx you suck!"
,skinny_dj,2010-01-25T15:29Z,this is not a DvDrip. Shame u loader coz u used aXXo name. Movie is watchable. A/V - 7+
,PunkArmy,2010-01-28T01:44Z,"trying to impersonate aXXo, thats pathetic"
,CSuk,2010-01-28T21:19Z,"IMOpinion...This film is a total load of talentless CRAP. No doubt though it will most likely be a favourite amongst those people who watch all the talentless 'Reality TV' programs and X-Factor rubbish :)
Do yourselves a favour and go watch the original 80's copy."
,geelad1212,2010-01-29T15:59Z,for a dvdrip its 10/10
,bokky,2010-01-30T14:26Z,"Thank you falconxx, and thank you r-man-010. I think u made your point. This is a free movie and it should stay as it is, and all you spammers complain to your mom instead of  leaving stupid comments. Thank you."
,fuzz2010,2010-02-01T20:50Z,"dont see why people say there axxo, it's stupid.

you have all them seeders and leechers and you dont put your real name down to take the credit.

cheers for the upload anyways

:)"
,Rinxx,2010-02-08T02:02Z,"Good quality

A-9
V-9

really douchy move using aXXo's name bro, if you wanna be respected as an uploader on TPB take credit when you deserve it and give credit to others, cant go wrong with honesty. cudos for at least saying aXXo wannabe tho and openly admitting you mistake. next time tho do us all a favor and rename it and skip the aXXo refferance all together. aXXo is a legacy bro..."
,stanfosi,2010-02-08T20:29Z,"why don't u just rename it, i was just hoping to hear from axxo again and what did i see, ""falconxx""'s CUNT!
thats what you will be if u use axxo's name, nothing more then a CUNT!!!!!!!
you should be banned forever using axxo's legendary name, or i'l hope the police will chace on you and they accidentialy shot you because you made a stupid move... CUNT!!!
change your name in something original and then i'l speak with two words again.....
(CUNT!)
there... i just gave you an original uploaders name. "
[V],.BONE.,2010-02-12T06:13Z,the tags say it all aXXo wannabe lol no offence but sum of u are like lost sheep hes gone get over it he was good yes but he wasnt the only ripper in the world u no
,dragon08,2010-02-14T14:47Z,"nice movie men!
good quality.
trusted download for a pirate like me. :)"
,theloston3,2010-02-17T08:05Z,"LMAO, I love everyone's grammar when they upload a file. there is always SOMETHING wrong =P
Notice he said ""its a release from a axxo wannabe"" he wasn't talking about himself, he was just saying he got it from another person who is a wannabe. I like your utter boldness. If you think there is a virus or whatever, don't download it, I don't give a shit. ha!"
,loyalistlad,2010-03-01T11:18Z,its b cuz axxo was the fkin man.....sadly missed by all..i hear e is bk under a new name...???????????????????????????? dnt these pple no that if they get caught up loadin in is name they will get done 4 all da shit e as done..lmoa..build yr own respect peeps..MUGS..fanx 4 the up by the way
,minimof1,2010-03-05T13:08Z,"Axxo WAS good, get over it, hope ""the man' didn;t get to him/her. Anyway... good quality 9A and 8V, sadly the movie it self is VERY average, I'd give it a 6 out of 10 at best, long live Margaret Pomeranz and David what's his name(for Australian pirates! (or Pirates in Australia, as there really isn't that many 'real' Australians except for YOTHU YINDI and Kathy Freeman). Oh... and Let there be good Grammar."
