,MODUSOPERANDl,2010-06-15T00:39Z,"Because only the cool kids upload in FLAC.

But really, FLAC files are a great way to compress files without losing quality on lossy audio files. If anyone needs to convert them, I'd recommend using dBpoweramp from here: http://www.dbpoweramp.com/

It always comes in handy for things like this. Enjoy :)"
