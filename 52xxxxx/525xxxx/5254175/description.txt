Suicide Silence is an American deathcore band from Riverside, California, formed in 2002.

I saw the other discography torrents on here and noticed none of them included the "Family Guy Demo" or "Live in Paris". So here it is: their complete discography in FLAC with all album art.

ALBUMS:
 1. Demo [2003]
 2. Downtown Massacre Split [2004]
 3. Family Guy Demo [2004]
 4. Suicide Silence EP [2005]
 5. Pre-Prod Demo [2006]
 6. The Cleansing [2007]
 7. No Time To Bleed + bonus track [2009]
 8. Live in Paris [2009] (ripped myself)

 Also included is their cover of the Deftones song "Engine No. 9".


Don't forget to seed!
