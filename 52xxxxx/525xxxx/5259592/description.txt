        Fight Hard to Survive

        Wrestling  icon  'Stone  Cold'  Steve  Austin  stars  as  John
        Brickner in Jeff King's action-packed Damage!

        Recently paroled  from prison  Brickner intially  tries to  go
        straight,  but  in a  society  of criminals  and  wasters, his
        options are severely  limited. Fighting promoter  Reno (Walton
        Goggins)  encourages  him   into  the  world   of  underground
        fighting, where Brickner soon finds his brutal skills can take
        him to the top of the  league. But when the stakes are  raised
        can he keep climbing the ranks,  or does he now have too  much
        to lose?
