,paradime1,2010-01-09T13:58Z,watch out everyone demonroids are uploading a version that's digitally locked and fucks you with spam and surveys! these pricks will provably pop up again somewhere else and fuck up more computers because your not paying them at this site so they sabotage this site and Ive told pirate bay about this shit and fake pirate-bay sites that will download all the crap available that does not work! This is subscription torrent manipulation of the free free pirate market that we enjoy but that's OK because we are all pirates who have no rights!  Anyone can screw us over and who would care? why don't all you lame fucks who have nothing better to do but generate problems for everyone! Give those bastards a tune up and give it to them instead of spamming and hacking everyone else! You piles of discharged Vaginal excrement!
