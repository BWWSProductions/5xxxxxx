,Phews,2010-01-05T15:01Z,"Hi 80s,

Happy New Year! 3 years already I always waiting your released and I got all. Everything is superb and including this one. So please if maybe some still not make comments it doesn't meant no one like it. I always enjoy it and I'm sure some of your fans too, so please keep up the good work!

By the way in this special occasion I would like really to thank you and much appreciate for your great work. Finally the songs which I'm looking for almost 25 years with no clue who is the band or the title of song (I just saw the video clip on that time with no song or band title) found it in your released. I couldn't describe how happy I'm on that moments, just scream and cry for happiness.
This is not joke Bro it's really happen.

That song is ""State Of The Art from Friends Again. 

I'm 40 now I'm really couldn't imagine I can found it after 40. Now 80z you see bro, what you did can have big good influence to others. So dont bother about comments WE ALWAYS LIKE AND LOVE U NO MATTER WHAT.

PS : Did you have State of the Art Extended Version? also Oil Of The Lamp Of China From Listening Pool in Extended? We miss your Extended Collections I really love that.

Cheers.  "

Best tracks by: Aus Device, Roy Finch, Experimental Products, Monuments, Into the Past, Procinate Force, Second Glance, and East of Saigon. I love intense synthersizers !

But the last word I wanna hear in January is ""coldwave"".
