,torgman1,2010-01-19T05:11Z,one of these files is messed up--xtras 3 says there's no video.
,OttoBismark,2010-01-23T07:29Z,"@torgman1
F means fixed, I uploaded a version with a broken nfo before this one, then hit the character limit on the title.

xtras 3 is not messed up, all these files are good, the problem is on your end. "
