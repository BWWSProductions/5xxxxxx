this is from the PS3 upload sony done by mistake,
total noobs :lol:, anyway i tagged dvdscr as quality
is sweet but its not a dvdrip!!!...i fixed colors
and increased brightness and sharpness overall
looks better but take it or leave it :)

you can't tag a webdownload as dvdrip !!"

Sound and picture are very clear.  Seriously, you're an idoit."
