    "Like the original, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, Pt. 2 sets the stage with the intro, but here it's some Raekwon history courtesy of Popa Wu. On Pt. 1 it was fictional dialogue introducing a loose concept album. Besides the introductory dialogue and the album's look-alike cover â€“ tinted purple, as if it were a Cash Money screwed & chopped mix of Pt. 1 â€“ the only traits this sequel shares with the original Linx is that it's the Wu rapper in top form, spitting out rhymes worthy of the Wu logo and pushing his guest list to work harder, as evidenced by Ghostface, Jadakiss, and Cappadonna all sounding at the top of their game. The productions are equally magnificent, with Pete Rock, the Alchemist, and even Dr. Dre all living up to their lofty reputations. Inspectah Deck and Wu secret weapon Mathematics out-RZA the RZA on their 36 Chambers-flavoured cuts â€“ the awesome "House of Flying Daggers" (actually produced by Dilla, not Deck) and "Mean Streets" respectively â€“ but if it's possible to create a poignant beat track, it has to be the soulful loop on "Ason Jones" a tribute to Ol' Dirty Bastard made all the more moving when you notice the beat comes from the late J Dilla. Raekwon's lyrical highlights come back to back as "Gihad" slaps the current rap scene for all it's worth while "New Wu" with Ghostface, Method Man, and RZA on production, renews hope that the Wu-Tang dynasty will return with a vengeance. If it looks long at 22 tracks, it'll still leave the Wu heads wanting more. This sequel may have little to do with the original, but if the title helps to point out this is the Shaolin poet's best work since 1995's Pt. 1, then so be it." - David Jeffries, AMG
