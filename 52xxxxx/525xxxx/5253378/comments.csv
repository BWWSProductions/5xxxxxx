[T],2mean2die,2010-01-08T13:55Z,"Install via setup.exe, DO NOT run afterwards (Close program)

Copy MovieEdit.exe to install directory overwriting original
Default XP: C:\Program Files\MAGIX\Movie_Edit_Pro_15_Plus_Download_version
Default Vista64: C:\Program Files (x86)\MAGIX\Movie_Edit_Pro_15_Plus_Download_version"
,masappeal,2010-01-12T00:21Z,Works perfect!! Thanks!
,Reducto1,2010-01-16T05:02Z,"Hi guys, i tried several times but it looks like am doing something wrong. is it please possible to tell me in details step by step how where should i copy and paste the Copy MovieEdit.exe  ? i cant get it work at the mom. keep asking for a serial key :(

Many Thanks"
[T],2mean2die,2010-01-18T07:06Z,"Do not run program after you install it;
Locate the directory that the program was installed to; open the directory; Copy & Paste the MovieEdit.exe to that directory. Now open the program, it should run for you. "
,spiketank,2010-01-27T09:51Z,"make sure it's blocked from the internet.
You might have to go under the ""Help"" menu after you copy and replace the crack. In the Help menu (after running it the first time with the crack) it should show something about activate or update the program.
you should be able to enter anything for the name and serial.
then when you're done it should tell you it's going to reinstall with updated information and unlock everything. after that you can go back to the Help menu and activate additional functions (mpeg4, 5.1, etc)
That's how it worked for Magix MEP 14 Plus

btw, is the download version the same as ""e-version""??"
,Smugfest,2010-01-31T20:08Z,"I want to download this, but it seems like it isn't getting too many people an easy install.  It would really help to line out the steps for us not so comp. savvy dudes.  Like I don't know what directory means.  Maybe try doing it like this.  Step 1) Open the file/torrent that has been downloaded. 2) disconnect from the internet (if necessary)....you know, kind of like that.  "
[T],2mean2die,2010-02-02T23:41Z,"1. Unzip file using WinZip
2. Copy files from the Winzip to a folder on your
computer.
3. Run the Magix Movie Edit Setup(Install via setup.exe,)
4.  DO NOT run afterwards (Close program)
5. Copy MovieEdit.exe (not the Setup.exe)to install directory overwriting original
Default XP: C:\Program Files\MAGIX\Movie_Edit_Pro_15_Plus_Download_version

Default Vista64: C:\Program Files (x86)\MAGIX\Movie_Edit_Pro_15_Plus_Download_version
6,. Your computer may require a reboot or restart.
7. Once you have copied and pasted the MovieEdit.exe to the Program Folder. Run the 
program. It should work for you."
,Smugfest,2010-02-03T23:10Z,What is the install directory?
,Smugfest,2010-02-03T23:13Z,"When I did it, I believe it started the program up automatically after the setup and there are three icons on my desktop.  Setup, Magix....word doc, MovieEdit, and now the one I click to open it:Magix MovieEdit 12 download version.  When I do double click the MovieEdit icon, it gives me an error.  Dac32.dll is the error name.   "
[T],2mean2die,2010-02-04T04:57Z,"The easiest way to explain it is:

Go to the folder My Documents> in any open space
use you mouse and right click. On the selection (choices) choose (NEW) then (Folder). This will create a New Folder in My Documents.

Next open  the Zip File, and copy all the files
to  the (New Folder) located in (My Documents).

Now click on the setup.exe file
Let setup run and finish.
Do Not run the program yet
Now click on My Computer, then click on Program Files then click on the file MAGIX, then click on the file Movie_Edit_Pro_15_Plus_Download_version.
Now your program file is open,

Now go back to (My Documents) (New Folder)
this is the one you created.  and find the file
MovieEdit.exe. copy or drag this file to the (Movie_Edit_Pro_15_Plus_Download_version) 
folder) it will ask you if you want to replace the
existing file, click yes.

Now close all files.

Go back to your desktop and find the (MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 15 Plus Download version) icon,
click on that and your program should run.

If you have anymore questions or problems,
e-mail me at tomeantodie@rocketmail.com
Hope this helps you"

In regard to your last statment, it sounds like you unzipped the file to your desktop.  Just follow the instructions in my previous comment and you should be OK."
,928s4vr,2010-02-22T17:06Z,"  Looking for some suggestions, I have went to their website and they say that their software is compatible with W7 but I keep getting a message when I try and install ver.12 and 14 that it won't install to my operating system.  Any ideas??"
,mtracker_2009,2010-03-31T16:53Z,"can someone tell me why I'm getting no sounds on my videos? I updated the codecs, but there's still no audio :\"
,Deljor,2010-07-09T00:22Z,"Works Great, Thanx for the detailed instr."
,akertyne22,2010-09-27T07:41Z,"Especially for Reducto:
Generally once a torrent is downloaded, you
1. right click on completed torrent to go to the downloaded folder.
2. once in the folder you click to extract using what ever unzip program you have.
3.Go to that created folder where you see files that include an install file, and and exe file.
4.Install and when finished you see a desktop icon of program which you click to view properties and then open file location.
5..Where you see the squared in exe file, this is what you replace with the downloaded exe file with a copy from folder to folder.

AND THANKS 'tomeantodie' FOR A RELATIVELY
PAINLESS TO GET TO FUNCTION DOWNLOAD. "
,nimrodxx,2010-10-02T22:46Z,Man I've been banging my head trying to get this sony vega to act right but that sucker has too man bugs....sad thing is that I'm running it on a sony laptop with quad core and it still freezes. Tried Avid no go. This looks promising so far........Love the 3d transitions!
,fuckregister,2011-03-10T10:16Z,"Fine work, great upload, thanks guys.  Was having some problems with it, thought I'd report:  At odd times and after using it a while, program would close abruptly without any warnings or messages while trying to select 'edit' (to see the 'timeline' mode).  First 'solution' was system restore (xp sp1) then re-install.  Yeah, a real drag.  After some tests, though, solution seems narrowed down to the following:  Open program.  Go to 'Help' and choose 'Reset program settings to defaults', and that should do it.  It worked for me at least once.  On a side note, in my opinion this program seems to be so damn good I'll most likely buy it the first chance I get.  Also, I'll try to seed it for as long as possible.  So much for ""piracy"", huh?"
,allardm,2011-08-16T13:02Z,"It works, but i don't know for how long. I also downloaded adobe premiĂ¨re pro cs3, it works a month and then the licence was expired.

I hope this program will work at least 2 year"
,yesyeyall,2011-12-08T12:45Z,"fucckwads - this program costs something like 60 bucks, if you know its works fuck it just buy it, IT IS SO CHEAP AND GOOD THAT YOU SHOULD STOP BITCHIN RIGHT NOW."
