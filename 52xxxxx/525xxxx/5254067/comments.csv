Will play in any PS3 or Xbox !
Enjoy!

Recommend playing h264 mp4s with KMPlayer or VLC Player.

Play on TV with PS3, XBox (2ch), WD HD TV, or Popcorn Hour."
,d_archangel,2010-01-02T23:52Z,Waiting for the BRRip. DVDScr is usually not too good. Anyway your latest releases have superb quality. It's incredible but you're getting even better.

,grisa3,2010-01-03T00:31Z,"hey secret_myth, I am a huge fan of your hard work. Hope it is not rude to ask for brrip of kill bill. Ive found some blu ray torrents but they are around 4 GB and 1080p. And you are just sooooo good in ripping them into smaller resolution and file of approx 2 GB. Would be happy if you put it here. thanks for everything"

If you're looking for Kill Bill, try this one:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5222630/Kill.Bill.2003-2004.BluRay.720p.x264.AC3-CMCT

CMCT's quality is usually great as well, only the non-srt japanese subs are a bit annoying"
,MTLGENTLEMAN,2010-01-06T00:01Z,"Good to see you back in 2010 !!!

,thunderx7,2010-01-06T04:14Z,Is this considered to be 720p or 480p?

,in_silico,2010-01-11T07:38Z,"Really nice download--some unobtrusive watermarks throughout, good quality on both audio and visual, definitely worth downloading for the purpose of watching.  Interesting movie as well.  Happier than I expected to be.  Maybe not the copy you keep long-term, but good if you are looking to enjoy the movie right now without being distracted by quality issues."
,red_lollies,2010-01-11T14:24Z,"Thanks heaps, great quality download. "
,Jack_Raiden,2010-01-12T01:01Z,"@thunderx7: ""Resolution: 704 x 304""
