Allmusic: "My Morning Jacket may be a journey through the past, but it's also a solid step into something rock & roll has been missing...melody, extremely catchy and well-written songs... and a love of the great pop continuum that translates into something new." Grade: 3/5 
Pitchfork Media:"It Still Moves...[is] an album by turns beautiful and possessed, by others raucous and fiery. My Morning Jacket have made the move to the bigs in tremendous style...[the album's length, its one major flaw] is a small concern considering the riches that await inside." Grade: 8.3/10 
Spin Magazine: "This time, the band lug the still-smoking amps from their lightning-strike live show into the studio and let the noise chase the midnite vultures away." Grade: 9.1/10 
Robert Christgau: "...and I guess his (Jim James's) boys are trickier than Crazy Horse, just not in any way you haven't heard before. Then there's his filtered drawl, his straitened tune sense, his lyrics you feel cheated straining for, his 12 songs in 72 minutes." Grade: C
