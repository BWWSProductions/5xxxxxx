Converting Vegetarians is a two-disc set album by the Israeli Psychedelic trance duo Infected Mushroom. It is their fourth studio album. The album was released by BNE/Yoyo Records in 2003 (see 2003 in music). The first disc consists of, more or less, psychedelic trance, hence 'Trance Side', while the second disc is more experimental and eclectic, featuring, among others, synth pop and hip hop influences.
