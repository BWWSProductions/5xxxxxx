Heartland S03E10: Eye of the Wolf

In this week's episode, written by Heather Conkie and directed by Ron Murphy, we follow the continuing drama of Scott and Ty who, when we last saw them, had gone missing in Scott's plane in a remote forested mountain area.

Tensions and emotions run high as Amy, Lou, Jack, Tim and Peter confront their fears of not knowing what has happened as they decide to do anything and everything they can to help locate the two men.

Realizing that you should cherish the time you have with loved ones, because you never know what the future might bring, certain feelings are brought to the surface and some relationships are dramatically affected in this week's show.

Guest starring in Eye of the Wolf is Joy Tanner as an RCMP constable helping with the search and rescue mission. Fans of "Life with Derek" will know Joy as Nora MacDonald on the half-hour sitcom. 


The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Jan 3, 2010. According to the CBC website, the next 4 new episodes will air consecutively each Sunday (from Jan 10 to Jan 31, 2009).
