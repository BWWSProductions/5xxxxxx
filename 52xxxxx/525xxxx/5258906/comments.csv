,VivastarDK,2010-01-05T22:28Z,"why does this say its S07E24 when i cant find it on wiki, they say that this episode is really S08E01 instead of S07E24 ???"
,BK-201,2010-01-07T22:29Z,I really love how this is ripped from the HD channel but is encoded lower than 480p. Please learn how to rip HD videos properly. Good quality...but could be much better. Its not that hard man look it up if you have to. Though I do like how often you upload. Thanks anyway. And yes this is actually the first episode of season 8

Since you are such an expert, then please /please/ start sharing all those super high-quality rips you've made with your masterful ripping skills.

As Jingle said, perhaps you should look for HD downloads in the Hires category? Please learn how to use ThePirateBay properly, its not that hard man look it up if you have to.

Thanks for the up, great quality (SD or not) like always."

Thanks Macavity81."
,macavity81,2010-02-01T08:59Z,"no prob, thought I'd contribute a bit "
[T],Pongydog,2010-04-01T02:32Z,"This eppisode is what wikipedia refers to as S08E01.

Myths tested:
Can you accidentally kill yourself with a bullet that ricochets off three walls?
Could a medieval army have used trees to catapult dead bodies over a castle wall? "
