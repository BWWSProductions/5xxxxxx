The album project began when Dickinson [Iron Maiden, Samson] was asked to record a song for the fifth Nightmare on Elm Street movie, which became the song called "Bring your Daughter...to the Slaughter". Collaborating with future Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers, Dickinson began to make a solo album which was fundamentally different from his works with Iron Maiden, sounding much more rock-oriented. "Bring your Daughter..." was not included on the original album but Iron Maiden later recorded a different version that was included on their 1990 album No Prayer for the Dying, which coincidentally became the band's only number one single to date. The introduction to the song "No Lies" is also reminiscent of Iron Maiden's version of "Bring your Daughter...to the Slaughter".
