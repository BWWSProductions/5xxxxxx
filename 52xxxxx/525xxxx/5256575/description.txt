Description:
Activision's third band-centric Guitar Hero release follows rock group Van Halen during its formative years with David Lee Roth as lead singer, but without original bassist Michael Anthony. As with previous titles focusing on Aerosmith and Metallica, Guitar Hero: Van Halen features 3D modeled versions of each band member as well as signature-style moves, clothing, and instruments from the past and present. Complete a solo tour on bass, guitar, drums, or vocals, or team up with up to three friends for the full band experience. In addition to Van Halen's biggest hits, 19 songs from such artists as Queen, Weezer, blink-182, the Offspring, and Queens of the Stone Age are included. Among the 25 featured songs from Van Halen are "Jump," "Hot for Teacher," "Panama," "Little Guitars," "Cathedral," "Spanish Fly," and "Eruption."
