,sczahra,2010-01-12T00:19Z,once you decompress the files how do you burn the disk? 
,MasterFen,2010-05-21T15:14Z,"To reply to sczahra, you need to use a program that's able to burn disc images (Nero, Imgburn etc) and have a disc drive that can write to a disc."
,CivicScootin,2010-06-01T01:36Z,Agree'd - ImgBurn is the way to go (plus its free)
,MasterFen,2010-06-21T14:37Z,"Or you could use a torrented version of Nero 6 and use a keygen like I did, it doesn't fuss about what DVD I use."
