must watch print.
its the HBO EDITION of Vicious Circle, not the DANGEROUS EDITION (search wikipedia for more info). if u get a good copy of Dangerous Edition, watch that(& upload also) coz its the whole show (2hr 12min approx).
if u cant find or dont want to watch whole show, then this is the best copy(1hr 32min approx)."
,FireIsHot,2010-07-10T10:21Z,"V: 10nA: 9nnUnfortunatly I\'ve downloaded 3 versions of Vicious Circle, 2 claiming to be Danegerous or 2 Disc Versions. But they all turn out to be the HBO Edition.nnOut of all of those, this is the only DVD Quality, the others were ripped from a Tivo.nn(There\'s No Legit Danegerous Versions out there, I might go buy it & upload it so others can enjoy the full length film)"
