I probably don't need it but was curious what Outlook 2003 looked like, now I know. Those who currently use Outlook Express might as well stick with it. I don't see any benefits to using Outlook 2003 instead, at least in my case."

I clicked on ""download this torrent"" but then a window pops up saying that my window doesn't support it and I needed to open it with another application.  I used some microsoft application but it's not downloading the way it should.  Can someone help? Please?"
