for some reason the timestamp doesn't show up on VLC having said that no M2TS shows up with that player.

Nothing wrong with the file just try a different player ""Media Player Classic"" is somewhere to start.

Couldn't see the point why you wanted to re-encode it.

The reason I used M2TS is because most players will play it and it's easy to transfer to a PS3 simple..
