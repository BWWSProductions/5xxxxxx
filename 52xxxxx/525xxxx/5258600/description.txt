Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a 2004 American pulp adventure science
fiction film written and directed by Kerry Conran in his directorial debut. The film is set in
an alternative 1939 and follows the adventures of Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), a
newspaper reporter for The Chronicle, and H. Joseph "Joe" Sullivan (Jude Law), known
as "Sky Captain", as they track down the mysterious "Dr. Totenkopf".

Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer with a bluescreen set up
in his living room and using a Macintosh IIci personal computer. He was able to get
producer Jon Avnet to see it, who was so impressed that he spent two years working with
the aspiring filmmaker on his screenplay. None of the major studios were interested in
financing such an unusual film with a first-time director. Avnet convinced Aurelio De
Laurentiis to finance Sky Captain without a distribution deal...
