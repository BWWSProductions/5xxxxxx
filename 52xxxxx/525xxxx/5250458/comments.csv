,indichub,2010-01-04T14:56Z,will these work on Iphone 3gs 
,blazinmonsta,2010-01-04T17:23Z,really cool apps. fast download. Thanks!
,sysuser32_2,2010-01-04T18:28Z,i believe there's no reason for these apps not to work with the 3gs... just make sure you've jailbroken your device...
,ThaFlava,2010-01-08T02:03Z,About 35 of these Apps will not install. Itunes store wants my computer to be authorised. Looks like those 35 are not cracked and most of the ones I wanted are in that 35. Disappointed.
