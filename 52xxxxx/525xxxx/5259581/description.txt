"Do You Remember" is the second single by British R&B artist Jay Sean from his American-debut album, All or Nothing. The single features Jamaican dancehall musician Sean Paul and American crunk rapper Lil Jon. The song is produced by J-Remy and Bobby Bass.

The song was released to U.S. radio stations on October 20, 2009 and released as a digital download on iTunes on November 3, 2009. It has entered the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 604,957 digital copies in the United States, qualifying for Gold certification there.

The video was shot in Los Angeles on November 11, 2009 with Sean Paul and Lil Jon and was directed by Gil Green. It features Sean, Paul and Lil Jon in a New York City block party setting and features cameos by DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia, Tyga, Birdman and Kevin Rudolf. The music video was premiered on BET on December 2, 2009. One scene in the video is inspired by Michael Jackson's 1987 music video "The Way You Make Me Feel".

In the United States, "Do You Remember" debuted at #27 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the chart week of November 21, 2009, making it Sean's highest debut charting single on the Hot 100. The following week it fell to #30 and remained at #30 for another week until rising up to #25 for the week of December 12. It later picked up and became the biggest airplay gainer of the week on December 19, 2009, when it reached #19. On the issue dated January 9, 2010, the song entered the top ten of the Hot 100 at #10, thus doubling Sean's presence on the top ten with "Down" also being at #7 that same week. This makes him the first male act since Chingy in 2003 to "simultaneously appear in the Hot 100 top 10 with his first two charting singles." It also broke "a three-week streak of no titles moving into the top 10" since December 2009. It also reached #9 on the Hot Digital Songs chart that same week.

On the Canadian Hot 100, it debuted at #55 for the chart week of November 12, 2009, and moved up to #46 the following week, so far peaking at #14 over a month later for the chart week of January 2, 2009. On the New Zealand Singles Chart, the song debuted at #23 and has so far peaked at #21 two weeks later. Despite the song not being released as an official single in the United Kingdom, the song debuted on the UK Singles Chart at #83 and on the UK Indie Chart at #6. On the Australian ARIA Charts, the single debuted at #43 on the week of 4 January 2010. It was the only new entry to enter the Australian Top 50 that week.

DJBooth commented, "like 'Down', this jam has undeniable club/radio appeal â€“ thanks in large part to J Remy & BobbyBassâ€™ upbeat, string-led instrumental - which sounds a lot like their boardwork on Down. "Do You Remember" may not be a drastic departure from its predecessor, but Seanâ€™s recipe for number-one success yields an equally appetizing result the second time around."
