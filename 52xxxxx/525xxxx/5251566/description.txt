I was going to wait a while to do this but found a few minutes to spare. I hope you all like it.
Again not much to say about this.

Ripped with EAC
Included:

FLAC - 15 tracks - WAV TO FLAC
LOG
CUE sheets.

To burn to CD, simply use CUE sheets.

Note: Cue sheets refer to WAV files. To burn FLAC to CD, you need to edit the CUE sheet.

         So extention .wav must changed to .flac 

This is 100% real. Support the artists by making a contribution. 

Please SEED. I have limited upload capability so I'll be pulling this off soon. Consider others you share with, so please don't hit and run. Atleast give it 100% if not more just like others do for you.

Enjoy!
