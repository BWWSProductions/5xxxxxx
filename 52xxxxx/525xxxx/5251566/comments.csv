I removed it when creating a new torrent but somehow its still there. Bug in client perhaps. In anycase, disregard that bit. If you check the files themselves, all is well. Enjoy and please remember, others are uploading for you, do the same for them. Thanks!"
,ChillyCrossFoot,2010-01-02T21:24Z,I stop seeding at 12.am. this midnight. Then it's upto you guys. More to come soon.
,ChillyCrossFoot,2010-01-04T04:42Z,"I wish I had more support, but it looks like everyone wants to hit and run. I love to share, but I would you guys to help out. So Please leave your torrents running. This way I can put up more stuff. Thanks!"
,bigpumped,2010-01-04T23:55Z,"do you have the original WAV files that you can upload I would love to have them, just asking, and thanks "
,ChillyCrossFoot,2010-01-05T16:50Z,"No, I am sorry I don't keep WAVs unless they are 24bit/96khz.
There is absolutely no difference between audio quality of WAV vs that of FLAC if that is what you are worried about. Please read a bit more about this on Google. Or, Wikipedia would be a good place to start."
