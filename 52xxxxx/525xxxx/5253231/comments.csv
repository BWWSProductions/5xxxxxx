however it seems it doesn't index filenames - if I remember right
AND it cannot index ONLY filenames within archives, it does try to extract files
AND if I saw this right, on a .tgz file it kept extracting the .tar file for each file scanned?! I may be wrong by my space kept fluctuating 150MB create/delete about every few seconds, until I decided to kill the app (after about 15 times seeing that)

so, as with ""Archivarius 3000"" v. 4.32 or so, it seems I cannot scan only filenames from inside archives, they all want my documents heh and yeah no options that I could see...

so I'll stick with ""Everything"" and its totalcommander plugin for fast filename-only searches (not within archives though)"
