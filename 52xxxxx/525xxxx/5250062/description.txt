Sorry, but I had to upload this as a 7zip file. Piratebay would not let me upload otherwise (saying "You can't upload an .url/.txt file in this category" or some other stupid thing). Normally I wouldn't.

There will be more coming, but I have a slow upload speed, so please seed so torrents of more albums in lossless format can be made. Remember that you can also download this at the website  via rapid_share or mega_upload,
