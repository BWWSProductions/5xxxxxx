,wtfprashan,2010-12-21T17:50Z,All the band member of Pink Floyd would commit a suicide if they listen to this album....... I know The Flaming Lips must have worked hard to create this album...... But its totally out of league........ I think its like being disrespectful to Pink Floyd........ after downloading this torrent I immediately deleted this album.....
