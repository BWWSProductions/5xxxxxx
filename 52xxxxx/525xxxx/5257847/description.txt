Another torrent for this movie was dead so I have seeded this new one.

Somewhere in the Night has an amnesia theme, which is also employed by several other noirs, for example The Crooked Way. Echoing the spirit of America after WWII, these characters have lost their identity and thier hope, and are finding it rough going until redeemed by a lovely, good-hearted woman.

Please seed this at least as much as you download. Thank you.
