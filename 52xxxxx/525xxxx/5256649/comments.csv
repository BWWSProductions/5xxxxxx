If so, thank you for not going on about some lousy virus ridden page like your brothers. If not, stop posting the same thing everywhere and download winrar or winzip, install the program of your choice and then just right click any of those small files you mentioned and choose Extract here. Then it will create that larger file that you can view in VLC."
