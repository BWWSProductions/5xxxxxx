Personnel: Michael Schenker : Guitar - Billy Sheehan : Bass - Denny Carmassi : Drums - Gary Barden : Vocal.

Notes: After leaving Scorpions for a second time, Michael Schenker wanted to start his solo career. He assembled a superb lineup. Gary Barden (vocals), Michael Schenker (guitar), Billy Sheehan (bass), Denny Carmassi (drums) [Montrose & Sammy Hagar Band]. They recorded some demos, but finally, they split, so Schenker and Barden recorded their first album with famed sessionmen (Mo Foster, Don Airey and Simon Phillips).
