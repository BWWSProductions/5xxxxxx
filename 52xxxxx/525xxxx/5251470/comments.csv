[V],twentyforty,2010-01-01T20:32Z,"Hey sonews, welcome to my home 
http://thepiratebay.org/user/twentyforty/

Take your pick and read the comments."
,lilars26,2010-01-01T20:51Z,"@sonews-try it,you'll like it....thanks 20/40 I've been waiting for this one...you have made my new year happier already.lol"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-01T21:01Z,"@lilars & htctouch: Just now, I watch it for the second time. I read the book few years back (in fact everyone I knew had, my sis recommended it) and I have been waiting, grabbed first crappy cam (hard to watch), waiting till yesterday when I got this. What to say, I have chills, I have been on verge of crying... great movie, great acting and - great story."
[T],houruoha,2010-01-01T22:55Z,"thanks 
:)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-02T11:28Z,"@hourouha: Thank you... for being nice and together with two friends have thanked in the name of thousand downloaders of this movie who have not shown any appreciation for my work. It may sound stupid, but I ""live"" from and because of such crumbs of human decency."
,thwapt,2010-01-02T12:26Z,"Thanks 2040, seems noone is seeding though...
I've been trying to download this all day & still only @ 35%

But I'm sure it will get there, thanks for the hard work"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-02T14:22Z,"@thawpt: Can you see BIG question-mark. I can't. I see 131 seeds and 103 peers. However, I CANNOT see quality of the seeders nor who they are. But - I also cannot imagine what problem you have.

OK, know what? Power off and on your modem/router (by doing so you'll change your IP), reboot comp if necessary, switch to Accept ONLY encrypted connections. I'm guessing but I'm almost sure that some ""gremlin"" have blocked your connection (maybe your ISP or mpaa payed agency). Be reasonable, please, it seems that you have forgotten what we/you are doing."
,thwapt,2010-01-02T23:19Z,"Thanks 2040, it downloaded.

But, can you please help with an error
""The header is corrupt""?
I've never seen this before"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-03T08:48Z,"@thwapt: Me neither. What ""header""? Which? Where did you get this error message?

PLEASE, take a look at my answer to friend of mine few months back on name-not-to-be-spoken - it might be connected to problem you had (have):

""LOTR torrent is ""under siege"" from ""protectors of innocence and righteousness"" who are
payed to load torrents and collect IP numbers of all in the swarms.

Reason why I have asked you to change your client is that guys from above.net and other ""agencies"" use - Azureus. Developers of Azureus stubbornly make source code of their program publicly available - uTorrent developers will rather choose death than do such stupidity.

Forget Vuze...Azureus... please.

Also, watch names in peer list (uTorrent HAVE that too, like no other) and if you spot sudden increase in number of inactive peers or ""dead"" (inactive) seeders (>THWAPT - that happened here, I've seen it!!!), you can be sure that torrent and swarm is - infected. Same thing with a lot *.*.gh addresses, above.*.net and few others. PeerG cannot block them, they act like normal clients, but usually just pull and trash bytes they receive. They suck dry anyone, declaring any received data-package as invalid AND for worse, they SERVE to others also bad and invalid packets. They produce what is called - dead traffic. Yesterday you have been - victimized by such nefarious activity.""...

It rings a bell, right?"
,thwapt,2010-01-03T12:15Z,"Thanks again 2040

I am really grateful for your help :)

I've never had this happen, so I didn't have any idea what it was..

Disappointing, but what can I do..

Thanks again :)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-03T16:26Z,"@thwapt: I am not sure that you have understood: it was few months old message (last and biggest part which was there only to point you what might happened), not a diagnose of your problem.

Now... can you tell me where do yo get that error message?
If you have the mp4, EVEN corrupted one, mplayer and VLC player ALWAYS can play one - always. Maybe not as perfect as should, but sure as hell - they will try.

Do not give up, why to trash already downloaded perfect movie."
,valu59er,2010-01-03T20:17Z,"this looks great.Vid and sound good.
Thanks 2040 New month unshaped yay.
good year people
Will seed for a few days but Im slow"
,thwapt,2010-01-03T23:20Z,"Hi 2040,
The error is when I'm extracting the rar file.

It wont extract at all, it is telling me different messages
""the header is corrupt""
""the CRC is corrupt""

I can see others have downloaded this with no problem, so something must have hapened to my file.
I can't check with VLC player because I cant extract..."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-04T19:16Z,"@thwapt: I have NO idea where that .rar comes from. In my torrent is only ONE .mp4.
Click on ""Files"" in upper left corner of this page."
