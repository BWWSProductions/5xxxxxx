,je2854,2010-01-06T23:28Z,From one SoldierX member to another THANK YOU
,WernerCD,2010-01-26T19:41Z,"Soldier... I love your torrents... 

but why with the stupid frekkin *.r00 crap?"
,sspazz35,2010-02-21T17:28Z,"I am also a member of SoldierX and have used the MRI for quite some time.  I know some GeekSquad employees and they say it is their fault for leaving the MRI and Customizer 3.8.1 (another good thing to have), in customers computers after performing services.  It seems that Geek Squads life revolves around the MRI and Customizer.  Half of them don't know how to optimize a computer without it.

I will seed this for as long as possible.

Keep up the good fight SX Crew."
,PollitoSabroso,2010-03-03T05:15Z,I actually work for GS... not cool... not cool. Oh n fyi there up to 5.1.3 :)
,in50mn14c,2010-03-23T06:11Z,"hahaha.
5.1.4 is out in test...

And it's not like cracking any of the MRIs is hard... BTW you guys missed call homes, the virus updates that are hosted with the AVAS companies are IP logged and sent to the GS. Have fun getting your Cease and Desist letters :P"
,susanslash,2010-04-07T05:44Z,"You will not get any letters, that's BS.  The agents use this disk in customer's homes everyday all across the nation.  You expect us to beleive they have someone do a reverse lookup , contact the ISP and ask , who owns this account ?  then compare that to receipts?!  Be for real.  but if you would like ot share the newest  disk ...that would be nice."
,Hanzmeister,2010-04-09T04:47Z,"WHY ALL THE EXTRA SHIT!

I may sound nubbish but what do I do with the .rar files.

Why not just a single ISO?

Thank you "
,dnkredible,2010-05-03T21:14Z,My Nod32 found a Win32/NuWar infection. Not saying its a definite. Just be cautious.

,swampownr1,2010-05-07T11:51Z,Thanks! Just extract RAR files. No virus
,sspazz35,2010-07-12T06:40Z,"PollitoSabroso,nnNot to get in a flaming contest, but I too worked for Geek Squad.  Some of the GS Agents are actually good at what they do.  Most, on the other hand, shouldn\'t be allowed to work on PC\'s.  The scary thing is, is they would rather train a salesman to repair PC\'s than train a computer tech to actually sale PC\'s.  nnWhen I applied for the job, one of the questions was whether or not I knew what STOP: 0x0000007A was for.  When I told them, they were surprised because, and I quote: \""Most people would have to look that up\""!  nnAnyway, nice upload once again SX!"
,edbtz567,2010-08-07T04:55Z,ok i am a noob and i have no idea how to put this on a cd....please help me
,boyobejaminhere,2010-08-23T06:50Z,"Is it safe to download the latest definitions for the anti-virus software included in this torrent.

And Thanks a lot soldierx team! This is a pretty cool cd to play with in my free time :D"
,DrStoooopid,2010-09-14T08:09Z,"@sspazz35 You're absolutely right, Brother. I too used to be an ""agent"" I laugh at that now. Since I left that precinct, it's gone to hell in a handbasket. Nothing gets done, they're all fighting with each other, and the person that they promoted over me (was a sales person)...didn't last in that position long. I told them that this was going to happen, but they wouldn't listen. Fuck Geek Squad, and fuck Best Buy."
,rwrope,2010-09-15T09:25Z,"Frankly if you cant figure out how extract a .rar archive, you have no business messing with the tools on this disk. 

About Virus updates, yes IPs are logged, but as stated, nothing ever comes of it, because the real disks are used in homes as well. FACE is an automated tool that they get paid to just click ""next"" and let it do its thing. With the tools that are on here, most windows problems can be fixed under the 1/2 labor sku, if the tech knows what hes doing. in most cases paying $200 to restore it, is bullshit. that said, if you are dumb enough to go look at porn unprotected, you deserve the removal fee... you wouldnt fuck a pornstar without a condom, and you cant look at one without A/v. 

Everyone enjoy the disk, just remember to return it to your local precinct when done... it will give them a laugh. 
Also if you run FACE, dont run it with mcAffee, it tends to break the OS, and cause it to blue screen on boot after the removals.
On another note, is there going to be a 5.5 crack coming out soon? "
,hyperstriker,2010-11-02T02:06Z,"Expired, please download the new version, blah blah blah..."
,kheady,2010-12-30T12:43Z,"Thanks for the upload! This CD is a great tool to have.

Is there a way to take the ISO and put it on a USB drive and make it bootable? If anyone knows how to do this, please share."
,kheady,2010-12-30T13:17Z,"Never mind, I found a tutorial over at SOLDIERX.COM

If anyone is interested. Here are the instructions on booting the MRI from USB

,RickZero,2011-06-21T20:58Z,"Hey SOLDIERX, I have a buddy that works at Geek Squad so he went ahead and gave me the updated version of MRI which expires in Feb 2012, you think u can go ahead and crack it too?"
,connorxkhaotic,2011-07-26T06:39Z,i need help!! for some reason this mri file got stuck on my g drive and when i try to delete it it says files on this drive are dvd-read only files cannot delete copy or move files.. i have my local disk (c:) local (d:) dvd drive (e:) dvd-ram drive (f:) and then Mri5.0.1 (g:). i dont want the mri on the g drive and i cant take it off.. someone help?
,connorxkhaotic,2011-07-26T06:41Z,but thanks for the torrent i love the tool just need the help on getting if off my g drive
,kfstevens2003,2012-06-11T15:03Z,"""booting the MRI from USB""
I just format the USB as FAT32 and extracted all MRI files to the USB stick. That worked just fine. No need to create an ISO file at all. If you already have it on a CD just copy all the files from your CD to the flashdrive."
,kfstevens2003,2012-06-11T15:09Z,"Response to: connorxkhaotic 
Delete partition for drive G and reformat. If it is a virtual mounted drive uninstall the program and reinstall it. "
,exuni,2012-06-19T03:20Z,"I would just like to say that GeekSquad MRI is an Awesome Tool, But it very limited and TAKES FOREVER to do scans and what not, as an agent you have no choice in the matter it must be used, but its also illegal to use there software. Use a free alt, or build your own, Google WINPE V 3 and make your own or use mine: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7333708/ATOM_PE_V_4_MULTI-BOOT all freeware and share ware and a ton of freedom!"
,Stonecold1995,2012-06-23T21:44Z," I keep hearing that this phones home to the Geek Squad servers.  But that was on a different, un-cracked torrent.  Is this cracked version safe to use in that respect?"
