,elcapizzo,2011-03-27T09:37Z,"This movie had an interesting concept, although not very original. For a direct to TV 80s movie the acting isn't too horrible. Sheen and Swayze really give it a bit more credibility too. But overall it is pretty c-grade. 

Quality is alright for an older movie rip.

,Wave_rider,2011-12-06T20:42Z,"decent quality download. Going look for a better one, but for the size, quality, and hard coded subs for non-english parts, will remain until a replacement can be found.

Thanks uploader!
