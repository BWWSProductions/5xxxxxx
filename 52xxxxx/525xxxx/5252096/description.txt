Follow the trend of the recently posted 'Biology 8th edition' PDF, i'm pleased to post 'Microbiology 10th edition'.

The resources for this document were extracted from the official eText version, which I have access to. 

I would like to thank Djdjura (his Piratebay nickname) for his help in scripting and layering all the pages. Without his help, this PDF wasn't possible.

Note: This PDF has been OCR'ed with Acrobat 9 pro. Optical Character Recognition  makes digital text in images searchable. Even after this technology is applied, some letter/text might not be recognized by the software, resulting in some failed search attempts.

To the publishers,

Please make an eBook that is actually downloadable WITHOUT A YEAR SUBSCRIPTION.
Charging the ridiculously high fees you do, for something that you can't fully own is a scam.  

Of who's backs are you trying to make your earnings here... 



Sincerely, 

Daniel C.
