,FlippoFromFin,2010-01-04T16:34Z,I didnt remember that I have only 1mb connection so my max upload speed is something around 150kbit/s so im sorry cause my upload rate sucks and I can't upload 24/7 but I try to seed as fast as I can.
,FlippoFromFin,2010-01-09T14:24Z,"OMG! Wtf is this dudes? When I seeded it 100% like 10 minutes ago before that there were 130 downloading.. When it was seeded there were left downloaders about 30 and only 4 seeders, wtf fucking bastards? SEED GODDAMMIT! Torrents are not working if you dont seed!"
