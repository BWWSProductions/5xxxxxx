If you have modded ps2 and modern tv you can use it with ntsc ps2. Most new televisions do support both PAL and NTSC 50Hz and 60Hz.


Ripkit what I used to get this file was named: GH5 RipKit_PAL-Drake
You can find it here: http://thedgtl.net/

It took really long to run that ripkit even I have double core 2,8GHz , about 3h so I upload this to save space and time.

Its working GREAT! I can't notice audio quality loss and I play it alltime =)

How to Burn to dvd:
1. Download this
2. You get gh5.rar file
3. Download Winrar or if you already have it then extract it
4. You get gh5.iso

4,5: IF you use memory card with ESR to run it then you have to patch it with it!

5. Download Img Burn here: http://www.imgburn.com/ or if you have it then skip this
6. Start Img Burn 
7. Choose Write Image to disc
8. Choose gh5.iso to burn and put Empty DVD into your Burning DVD-Station
9. Best DVD to get it work are:

..1 DVD-R
..2 DVD+R
..3 DVD-RW

So use DVD-R discs cause they are most cheapest and also works best.

10. Start burning process at 2x speed and wait for it to finish.
11. Take disc and put it into your modded playstation 2 dvd-station and ENJOY!
12. If it freezes then your disc is bad quality and you can burn it to new DVD.
 
I had to burn it twice cause first dvd was fuckwed so it freezed. Second one were perfect and worked great =)
