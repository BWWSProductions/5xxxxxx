As the new decade begins, Chilla Jones, fresh off the release of his greatest work entitled "timebomb", follows up his street album with a mixtape called "23", dedicated to his becoming of age. "23" is a mix of original records, brand-new freestyles, classic tracks and shout-outs from birthday well-wishers. With over 40+ minutes of new material, this mixtape is a great indicator of things to come this year from Chilla, and with this project to kick the year off, you can bet that he's gonna play a major role in the progress of the city of Boston, and of hip-hop itself.
