Email me if you are looking for an album in Lossless/FLAC (even obscure ones). I'd be willing to send you a link to it if you would share the album on publicbt/thepiratebay after you finish downloading it. My email: centroids1@gmail.com

    The Blood Bank EP oozes into stores in the UK/Ireland January 19 and the U.S. January 20, all thanks to Jagjaguwar. The four song set will be available on either CD or download-coupon-boosted 12", with the vinyl getting a little pre-release action at the merch tables at Bon Iver's forthcoming December dates.
