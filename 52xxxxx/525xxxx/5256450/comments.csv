,cinesimon,2010-01-05T14:39Z,Thanks - this one obviously has some seeders with their upload speeds set at reasonable levels. A shame the more populated one is populated with what seem like a bunch of stingy Brits who all seem to have their u/ls extremely limited to the point of silliness...

Unfortunately, most people in the UK use ADSL broadband (only one company offers fibre optic), so the upload speed is much lower: around 30-50kb/s."
