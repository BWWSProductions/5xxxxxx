,iggitel2000,2010-01-09T01:50Z,it says register no matter what..share the license
,bigbenwallace90,2010-01-16T23:50Z,if he did that then the license wouldnt work anymore cause they would see that its registered to 1578373 ip's so then it would not be a valid key dissconnect like he said and also block it with a firewall then your totaly safe to use it without having to worry about it not working enjoy hope that help some
,nakinage,2010-01-19T16:21Z,"thanks a lot!!!!!
but there is something... if an expensive software is cracked, the software should think that you already paid for it... here they say ""you are using the cracked version, buy the software""... i am not a PRO in logic yet but THIS kinda means 2 things: ""they created their own crack"" and ""this is still not the full version -_-"""
,nakinage,2010-01-19T16:22Z,o and btw... i did disconect
,nakinage,2010-01-19T16:28Z,"aw... actually, i reiinstalled it and now it works perfect... sorry Murlok and great job ;)"

Go to your firewall settings, make sure you use that firewall to block this program from accessing the internet. I personally use the firewall which comes with Kaspersky Internet Security. Blocking the application from connecting to the internet by using a firewall is basically what most pirates like us do ;)"
,dardar6t9,2010-02-03T04:35Z,I got MalWare up the ass(had ^6 items in my registry).....and after reading the other comments it doesn't bode well. Ability to be useful......TERMINATED!!!!!
