,kingtrencher,2010-01-03T18:24Z,Be sure to scan this. I did a standard scan of all incoming torrents & something from this torrent set off my anti-virus.
,PunksAndSkins.com,2010-01-03T19:43Z,"Hahahahaha a virus, yeah right...

Your anti-virus is garbage, virus in mp3 files is an impossible thing

Or just don't download it if it scares you... i don't really care"
[V],neon,2010-01-05T16:08Z,"MP3 files are not executable files. It is not possible for them to contain viruses.

User kingtrencher  either needs better anti-virus software, or he needs to get a lot smarter about understanding false positives from bad AV scanners. "
,ANicki_InTheUk,2010-03-07T17:06Z,"there IS somethng wrong with this, It made my computer keep flashing and beeping until i managed to get rid of it, I've been downloading torrents for years and never had this problem, might not be a virus but there's something bad happening for sure"
,ANicki_InTheUk,2010-03-07T17:07Z,"and i have downloaded many other files from PunksAndSkins and not had any problems, just so you know..."
,hmrhead,2010-06-19T16:52Z,I always exclude image files unless that is exactly what I am aiming for
,hmrhead,2010-06-19T16:53Z,not working :(
,Tulkoju,2010-07-04T13:56Z,"THANX!!!
music plays fine.

if you find a virus you should report the torrent officially to pirate bay. also you should write exactly what your antivirus found. Mine didn't find anything.

,leelocka,2012-03-02T19:07Z,"Sketch site, nothing is at punksandskins.com but t-shirts and bullshit."
,leelocka,2012-03-02T19:24Z,"and be prepared to delete [punksandskins.com] from every file and every folder.  I wouldn't have gotten it if it weren't for you so, THANKS.  But your thorough advertisements were most annoying and your site does SUCK"
,leelocka,2012-03-02T19:35Z,"ah foot in mouth about the track titles.  This is the first torrent I've downloaded (or noticed) where someone added a ""title"" ""album"" and ""#"" column, so much thanks.  your site is still wack. "
,leelocka,2012-03-02T19:38Z,"o yeah and nothing but mp3s and jpegs in the download, unless they're hidden somehow, im not a comp wiz but i wouldn't shy away from this b/c of the people that had problems"
,charleshart5,2012-03-15T15:34Z,"Missing tracks, pisspoor bitrate, different file types lumped in together, lo-res artwork, everything plastered with the address of their frankly shit website... Cheers! Punk's not dead after all."
,slimHXCchance,2012-06-19T06:31Z,Yeah gotta say this doesnt look worth it in my opinion
,landyeahy,2012-06-29T18:42Z,"Thank you for this, my DM cassettes are wearing out.
This worked perfectly, and the quality is fine.
The only music file that isn't an mp3 is ""Stuart"" from ""Beelzebubba"", it's a wma file."
,landyeahy,2012-06-29T18:45Z,"Also, the file names are fine. The website name [WWW.PunksAndSkins.COM]  doesn't show up after downloading."
