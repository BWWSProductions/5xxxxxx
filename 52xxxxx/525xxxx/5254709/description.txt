I'm Alive is a striking return to the kind of romantic subject matter that the Los Angeles singer and songwriter seemed to have abandoned after 1980 in favor of political songwriting. His finest album in nearly two decades, it has much in common with his 1974 masterpiece, Late For The Sky, whose songs also described the disintegration of a relationship. -Stephen Holden (The New York Times, November 14, 1993). The album was in Q's list of 'The 50 Best Albums Of 1993' -Q (1/94, p.84).
