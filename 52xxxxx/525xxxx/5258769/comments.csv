Remember to seed guys!!"
,Daddy_Spank,2010-02-21T00:43Z,Burn this with DVD decrypter
,evilmonkey99,2010-03-10T08:17Z,"please let me know what program to rip this. all the blurays i have downloaded have been just one file and i open it up and watch it, however with this one you can only burn it. can i simply use any burner to burn the iso or do i have to do something special with the mds file with a special program or what ... why wasnt this info included with this torrent?
thank you."
,evilmonkey99,2010-03-10T12:43Z,"i had an old 25gb bluray rom that came with my bluray drive and i went ahead and burnt it to the desk and it works perfectly.  I would rather have this movie as one file though like the other blurays i have been downloading. 
thanks again for making this bluray movie available for us."
,evilmonkey99,2010-03-10T12:46Z,oh by the way i just used my regular burn software that i always use (power2go) and all i had to do was double click the ISO file and my burning software took over. i didn't need anything special like a DVD decryptor nor did have to mess with the MDS file at all.
