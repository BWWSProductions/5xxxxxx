About the Show

"Drop Dead Diva" is Lifetime's spirited new comedic drama series that puts a wildly unique and entertaining spin on the complex issues of a woman's identity in today's world.

The show tells the story of a beautiful-but-vapid model wannabe, Deb, who has a fatal car accident and suddenly finds herself in front of Heaven's gatekeeper, Fred, who declares her a self-centered "zero." Outraged, Deb attempts to persuade Fred to return her to her shallow existence but is accidentally relegated to the body of the recently deceased Jane Bingum (Brooke Elliott). A brilliant, thoughtful and plus-size attorney with a loyal assistant (Margaret Cho), Jane has always lived in the shadow of her more comely colleagues, whereas Deb has always relied on her external beauty. Now, by a twist of fate and a bolt of divine intervention, Deb must come to terms with inhabiting Janeâ€™s plus-size frame and learn to reconcile her beauty queen ways with her brilliant new mind.

"Drop Dead Diva" is produced by Sony Pictures Television for Lifetime Television. Josh Berman ("Bones," "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation") is creator and executive producer.
