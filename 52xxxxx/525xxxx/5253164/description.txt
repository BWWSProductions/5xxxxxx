From the rough songs of ZZ Top to the sexy sounds of Tito And Tarantula's "After Dark", this soundtrack has the same spirit as the film. "Dark Night" by The Blasters is a great opening for the film and the soundtrack. "Mexican Blackbird" by ZZ Top follows. Along with some blues tunes and an unexpected dialouge from Cheech Marin. The two score pieces fill the rest of the space. Great soundtrack for a night in an "off the wall cantina.
