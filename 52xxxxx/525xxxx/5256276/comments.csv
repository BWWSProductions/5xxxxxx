,Liise100,2010-03-16T18:31Z,"I'd really like to see this, and I can, but only on my laptop because it's an Avi file so you can't play it on your TV (unless you have a really good dvdplayer!)
Such a shame! Does anybody know where I can find this movie in PAL, NTSC or TS format??

the quality seems good btw!"
