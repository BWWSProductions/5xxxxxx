Thanks for the great torrents for all the Star Trek movies, but is there a chance you have the subs available for just the klingon/vulcan parts of these, or could you re-up a version that has those hard-coded? Thanks again for all the great torrents!

,Rapier_Wit,2010-12-31T15:41Z,For some reason there's music over a blank screen for a couple of minutes before the movie starts. Top quality once it gets going. Thanks for this and all your Trek rips.
,scurvypirate1234,2011-08-13T03:49Z,Does anyone have any WORKING subs? The subs torrent posted in 2010 is dead.
