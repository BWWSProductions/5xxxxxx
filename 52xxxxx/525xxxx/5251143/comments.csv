,nogoodnamesleft2,2010-01-02T11:38Z,">torrentpirateer> Try http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4517187/Mad_Max_Trilogy_DVDRip_%5BA_Release-Lounge_H264-Boxset_By_Paulx1%5D for Mad Max - it's not Secret Myth but it's pretty good.

I agree with you on your request for the Resident Evil films, and also with the guy after all the Star Wars. To that I would add a request for the Star Treks and Star Gates. I guess it's my day for Stars..."

,IloveHD,2010-01-14T05:08Z,"Hey secret,
I really love the quality of your stuff, but I have one question: why did you change the profile of your videos from ""Main @L4.1 to High @L4.1""?
this is making them unable to play on Apple TV. how can I change that (I have a mac) and why did you start uploading them differently?"
,pearl_001,2010-01-19T13:16Z,Thanks a lot Secret Myth.
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-01-27T10:34Z,"Thanks. As always, great quality. +1"
,bskr,2010-02-01T15:54Z,"I'am always waiting to see whats next from secretmyth. Now a days even though others rip and upload, i download only from your uploads. Quality is amazing!!"
,EXE_cutioner,2010-02-01T18:38Z,"OMG! I am so sick of everyone complaining about not being able to watch movies or do basically everything on their MAC! If you were stupid enough to buy one of those useless pieces of crap deal with it! ""They are nothing but over priced shinny cases and advertizing capaigns""! That's a quote right out of the mouth of Steve Jobs himself! He even thinks you are an idiot for buying one! All their money goes into advertizing and their pockets! All the technology is scavenged (""stolen"") from here and there. He even robbed is so called friend and partner Steve Wozniak back in the day. Jobs was offered $5000 to fix a problem at his job. He told Wozniak he would give him half of what they paid him to do it. Wozniak fixed the problem and Jobs told him they gave him $500 and only gave him $250 of the $5000! I would have shot in in the face when I found out, not continue to let him ride his skirt! Now you know the truth about MACs and Jobs, Wozniak is cool, just stupid for letting Jobs get a free ride all these years.
PS. Thanks for the great upload..."
,DGray978,2010-02-10T11:12Z,"Thanks swcret_myth, the quality of your work is great.
