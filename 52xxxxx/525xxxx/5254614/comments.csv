,luffarungen,2010-02-14T15:57Z,"mee7, are you kidding me? this is NOT a 9 rating for the video quality. 6-6.5 at most. 

I wish that one day indian rippers woud wait for the dvd's to come so we can watch the movies in good quality instead of crap quality like this"
,manuhatetolove,2010-03-23T10:52Z,when will the DVD version will be uploaded? 
,ruchirrathore,2010-04-12T03:13Z,"kamikaze_al, you should clearly mention the source of this print. stop making a fool of people. this print is clearly a cam print. not at all a DVD print. so a=5 and v=4. OK quality for cam but DVD has been released and I downloaded it expecting a dvd print, as you have not mentioned any where in description that it's cam print. At least you'd mention that it's cam print. I am deleting the entire download and will download from some other source. I will NOT seed it."
,Torrentreporter,2010-07-01T15:20Z,This person downloaded it from Team_xrg copy and upload it again...Fake one...NOt orignal print but this is one of the best print in release days by Team_Xrg....
