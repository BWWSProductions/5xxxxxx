I hope everyone gets better speeds now, I've been uploading at 100k/sec for over a week. Its sort of annoying that half of what you upload gets wasted, but that's life! 

I will continue to seed for the foreseeable future. Enjoy."
,MafiaHansen,2010-01-11T16:30Z,kidding right? 25Gib?!
,Seta,2010-01-15T07:25Z,"Thank you for this!

@MafiaHansen: 22 episodes, each 1.09 GiB. You do the math. :)"
,Spelunca,2010-01-27T11:19Z,Thank you! As far as I know that's the only place you can find it all in mkv. I just hope to find season 2 as well.
,Kermit,2010-02-18T00:48Z,"Thank you indeed!
Alredy seen them of course but this is a good show and worth the download to watch again sometime. Again - thanks fot the effort, some of us at least bother to show our gratitude..."
