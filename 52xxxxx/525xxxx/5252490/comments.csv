They told me to quit downloading torrents and that it was illegal. My ISP had got a letter from warner bro. telling them to contact me and handle it in a appropriate manner. To make a long story short, they're gonna turn off my service if they get contacted again by someone saying i downloaded their movie torrents. My question is : How does everyone else get away with this? Thanks for your comment. "
