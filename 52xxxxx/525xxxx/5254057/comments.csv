Hopefully most people understand that evidence presented at the Nuremberg trials were all lies; Jew Fat Soap, Jew Skin Lampshades, Shrunken Heads, etc etc etc...all lies conceded even by Yad Vesham and the Wiesenthal Center.

The Nuremberg Trials were nothing less than the typical ""Victors Justice"" that has been handed down for millenniums. "
[V],rambam1776,2010-01-03T12:30Z,"When presented with a claim such as the one made above by ?bilderbooger?, an historian has to enter into a Devil?s Choice. Do you simply ignore it, or do you run the risk of justifying the debate by refuting it? Consider, you can easily prove a flat-earther wrong, someone who claims that something isn?t true when the evidence that it is so is absolute. By arguing with them, doesn?t that make it sound like the debate is even worth having?

This is the problem addressed by Prof. Deborah Lipstadt in her famous book DENYING THE TRUTH: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory, which I would encourage everyone to read.

The purpose of these trials to begin with was to make it impossible for anyone to successfully claim that the Holocaust did not occur. Watch the films and judge for yourself if they were successful. As far ?bilderbooger? goes, his technique above is to seize on some aspects that have been embellished in urban myth to act as proof that the event is false. For example, if I were to describe in great detail a car crash involving 100 cars and multiple deaths, but to have described one car as blue when it was really green, then someone who wanted to deny all of it could say the evidence was wrong. A famous real life example of this is in American History, where people are told how the cavalry used to give infected blankets to Indians. In reality, there is only one recorded case of that ever happening, and it occurred in the 1760s when a single BRITISH officer did so ? for which he was court-martialed. That does not mean that subsequent American treatment of the Indians was pristine, simply that a famous grotesque historical image is inaccurate. 

The Holocaust was the systematic destruction of around 13 million people deemed by the Third Reich to be unfit to live for a variety of reasons. Roughly 6 million of these were Jews (seen as the primary enemy), and around 7 million were other ethnic minorities, politically unacceptable Germans, foreign soldiers, sexually or religiously disliked minorities, and other assorted groups. The killing had two major methods ? murder in place by mobile squads called einsatzgruppen, or transportation and elimination in camps by various means ? ranging from gas to exposure and slave labor. 

In any mass operation, especially one so evil and necessarily cruel, there were bound to be further aberrations and extremities, as well as myths and falsehoods. These are what the above poster uses to deny everything. One deeply warped person in a camp made two shrunken heads of a pair of Polish resistance fighters. One person with some tanning ability used tattooed human skin to make some leather souvenirs, not lamp shades. Soap was considered, but not carried out.

If you are reading this, and are not a history scholar or are new to this ugliness, I suggest you read Lipstadt?s book, or simply go here to gain a better understanding of the nature of Holocaust Denial: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial"

,Bilderbooger,2010-01-03T23:15Z,"There is no doubt that millions of people died due to the circumstances of the war. Most people died from starvation and disease due to the conditions that existed in Germany during the last few years of the war - especially at the very end, after Germany was bombed by the Allies back into the stone age.

If you really want to debate the issue, you can visit this forum:

Unless, of course, that you live in a country that will throw you in prison for questioning the ""Official Version"" of the events of WWII. As they did David Irving, Ernst Zundel, Frederick Toben, Germar Rudolph, Jç«¯rgen Graf, etc. etc. etc."

,KickassWashingMachine,2011-03-16T18:40Z,"@rambam1776: That is the most well-written rebuttal I've ever read (and probably every will read) on the pirate bay!

@Bilderbooger: A high number of ignorants doesn't make the ignorance go away, it just makes the problem bigger. "
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-03-16T18:47Z,"By the way, it might be interesting to know that this (I believe) is the footage as shot by the Soviets.

The American and the Soviet lawyers were working together during the Nuremburg trials, and both sides were shooting film to document everything.

The American version, however, was shortly after put on ice as the government - now embarking on their communist scare tactics - didn't want to depict this coworking of Americans with scary Soviet communists.

The American version has recently been released (actually that's how I found this torrent, as I was searching for the other one).

It's called ""Nuremburg - Its Lesson for Today"" and features the only known actual amateur footage (shot by an SS officer) of early testing of gas chambers on unknowing Jewish concentration camp victims.
