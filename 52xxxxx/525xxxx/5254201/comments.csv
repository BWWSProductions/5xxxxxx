,Amerialb,2010-01-03T06:39Z,"The mesh has great quality but alas it does not work well with my FSX. It removed most of the bridges so the cars go through the water now, it removed all the correct buildings and forced the AI to put any old building were the correct ones should be, removed most of the stadiums, and put mounds were there were none. I am glad I did not buy this thing."
,Doggit07,2010-01-03T11:25Z,"the ground enviroment s U.S an Canada is a lot better, looks great also there is the ground enviroment x for Europe on the bay also, I would choose those over FS Global anytime"
,fkshda,2010-01-03T13:47Z," Who can upload the file of FSX Flight1 Skyhawk 172R?

Thanks~~"
,grfam,2010-01-03T16:13Z,doggit07: you have mixed up two completely different kind of fsx products!
,Amerialb,2010-01-04T03:12Z,"Does anyone know how to keep this mesh from stepping on FSX buildings, bridges, control towers, and stadiums, while still using it. I mean, is there a position in the scenery line up I should put it in?"
,Amerialb,2010-01-04T03:51Z,"Never mind, I figured it out on my system. I had installed some other scenery stuff that added all the buildings and stadiums in the cities across the US and EU. Well I unchecked them in the scenery setup in FSX, after going in and checking them again all the correct buildings, stadiums and towers came up, But it did not correct the missing bridges and the unusual mounds were there shouldn't be any. Don't ask what the additional scenery is, that was a dozen installs ago."
,goodhope357,2010-01-04T16:23Z,Pls. We wait for captiansim 767 with keygen. 
,massive74,2010-01-06T17:32Z,"I am agreed with Doggit07.

The Ground Enviroment  for U.S, Canada and Europe is a lot better."
,NightM0nkey,2010-01-07T18:38Z,"Doggit07 and Massive74: As grfam said, this is a completely different product to Ground Enviroment X for U.S, Canada and Europe.
FS global is 3D terrain mesh, basically it adds all the lumps and bumps on the earth so it doesn't look so flat. "
,Kaluleomorir,2010-01-15T16:42Z,"Pretty Please: someone who already d/l this torrent upload only the FS GLOBAL 2010 for FSX, for time sake!"
,RocketRick43,2010-01-19T05:12Z,"There's always confusion on what this program is compared to others.  This program is terrain MESH where Ground Environment is terrain textures.  Mesh is what gives you peaks and valleys and makes mountains look more realistic as far as height and so on.  GE puts the details on those peaks and valleys.  e.g.  houses, roads, and the like.  Textures (GE) over lay mesh (FSG).  They are not alike.  Hope this clears up some confusion!"
,eric-w,2010-02-07T01:51Z,Kaluleomorir I think this is the FSX version only. The full FS Global X 2010 package comes with 12 DVDs (6 for fs2004 / 6 for FSX) and this torrent only contains 6.
,darkstar-g,2010-02-13T10:38Z,"Just to confirm, This IS for both FS9 & FSX..Ive just installed to both sims succesfully...Great upload...Thanks upper"

,doatg,2010-02-19T19:04Z,Ok there seems to  be that this program doesnt work very well commenting about bridges going thru the water.  Does this mean that there is a bug with the software or is this just a user error?  Asking because i like to try before you buy concept so someone please leave some feedback about if this will work or not.  Thanks
,TITIBUTI,2010-02-21T12:36Z,"Hi guys, I´m having a problem with the installation. I installed all the disks and once I load with the microsoft flight simulator X (deluxe edition) it says that areas 116, 117, 118, 119, 120 and 120 are misssing in the scenery. I press ok and i starts but I presume that something has not fully worked with the installation of FS GLOBAL 2010. When it finishes it creates 19,2 GBS of data in the computer (just measuring the size of the directory FSGX created). It was not supposed to be 21GBs.
If someone can help I´ll be vere appreciated. By the way, it takes six hours to install."
,TITIBUTI,2010-02-21T12:41Z,One more comment: I have Vista 32 and I installed twice and the result was the same. I don´t have SP1 and SP2 installed but I think that is not needed if you have the Deluxe Edition

MSFS X Deluxe does not include SP1 or SP2. You must install both to bring FSX up to date. Suggest a clean install of FSX then both SP's."
