,FijitsuCOBOL,2010-03-06T22:03Z,THANK YOU!  for all your uploads.  I have installed VMware and Windows 7 and they work perfectly.  I even got my old 32bit Fujitsu COBOL running again and I am uploading the install ISO to a file sharing site now if anyone wants COBOL (Net Express COBOL is free but you have to have the expensive version of Visual Basic installed to run it).  I will post the link to the COBOL as soon as it uploads.

The other torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5087783/VMWare_Virtual_Machine_6.05 did install though."

Yes this will allow you to run Windows XP on a Vista computer. If you're having compatibility issues with programs, you could try running in compatibility mode.
Also, game problem could have something to do with your CPU or video card. Try updating all your video card drivers."
