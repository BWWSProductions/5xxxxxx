The Producers (80s pop band) live show on MTV, New Years Eve, 1982.  It was the 2nd annual MTV New Years Eve Rock and Roll Ball.

I was a big Producers fan in the 80s and always valued this tape.  Unfortunately it is digitized from a nearly 30 year old VHS tape that was recorded in SLP mode.

The original tape has all but lost it's audio.  I found a copy I had made about 15 years ago and imported it.  The video quality is not as good as the original but the audio is much better... still not very good but much better.

I've uploaded this for all those old Producers fans out there that either never saw the show, never saw the band live or just plain missed seeing the band.

The poor quality will not really bother the true fans that really don't have any old material to look back on.

Includes interview with Van and Waynne after the performance.

The early days of MTV... it don't get any better than that!
