,triadwarfare,2012-06-30T04:55Z,"Is there any nick logos/watermarks/age advisory here? I need to know before downloading.. I'm looking for the prefect quality but if its source is from the TV, then it's not perfect.

I have watched all the episodes already but my collection is substandard so I deleted it. I'd love an iTunes quality release with no logos, overlays, or any distractions that would break the immersion of the story"
