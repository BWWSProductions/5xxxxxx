Balls to Picasso is a Hard rock album released in 1994 and is the second effort in Bruce Dickinson's solo career. The ballad "Tears of the Dragon" stayed for many months on top the of charts in countries like Brazil where Dickinson has a large fanbase.

This record marked the beginning of Dickinson's collaborations with Roy Z, who would work on many of Dickinson's later albums including Accident of Birth, The Chemical Wedding and Tyranny of Souls. Stylistically it departs from Tattooed Millionaire but is still more traditional-sounding than the follow-up album Skunkworks released in 1996. Later, Dickinson said that he and Roy Z were talked into making the album less heavy than it should have been.

Dickinson started working on his second solo album while still in Iron Maiden. For the very first recording sessions he recruited the British band Skin. Not satisfied with the style of the effort, Dickinson aborted the recording. His next attempt at a second solo album was a collaboration with producer Keith Olsen. Dickinson decided to scrap this project as well and teamed up with guitarist Roy Z and his band Tribe Of Gypsies to write and record Balls To Picasso. Songs from the previous recording sessions later resurfaced as b-sides on singles from Balls To Picasso and subsequently also as bonus tracks on the album's 2005 extended edition.

"Laughing in the Hiding Bush" is dedicated to Bruce Dickinson's son: Austin. According to Bruce, when his son was a child he said he was "Laughing in the Hiding Bush" instead of "Hiding in the Laughing Bush". The "Laughing Bush" was a nickname for a bush in their home.
