RAR file requires password that you can only get from a pay site - this is unnacceptable, certainly against the spirit of TPB & if so this user should be warned/barred!

[Also, why (?!?!) does anyone still RAR video files - they don't seem to take up ANY less space and are a pain for both parties?]"
