,Hardcode,2010-01-05T09:27Z,"If you encoded these, I appreciate your efforts and I mean no disrespect, but these bitrates are horrendously low for 1080p videos.  They should be at least double what they are.  Also, the audio should be at least 640K AC3 or 1510K DTS."
,penandpike,2010-01-05T12:18Z,"I did encoded these, and the picture is just awesome on my 46"" lcd. If somebody doesn't like the spec., just don't download it. And how come somebody rated the quality (-1)  before i even began seeding the torrent."
,eccles,2010-01-06T14:28Z,I'm sure they'll be fine. Thanks for including the subs too.
,runner00,2010-01-06T20:57Z,"This is an amazing torrent. Even for the low bitrates.

Thanks ....."
,runner00,2010-01-17T13:58Z,But whats with the download speed ... taking forever ....
,Lucentdepths,2010-01-19T09:12Z,"God I've been stuck at 99.6% of this for 2 days now, could you please seed some more and hopefully get some more seeds up? There are a ton of leechers, but with all the trackers I only see 6 to 10 seeders, but will not connect to any of them. Sucks! The first 5 movies are at 100% but the others are stuck from 99.1 - 99.6.

I'd really love to finish this, thanks for taking the time for this. but please please please seed some more."
,Airborne_DK,2010-01-30T11:13Z,when you have finished downloading so please seed
,Bean-Bandit,2010-02-26T16:42Z,How is it that all of these are all 4.37Gb each? Did you shrink these all to fit on just a dvd-r?
,pnfkwfl,2010-02-27T05:20Z,Did anyone else find that several of the movies did not play?
,whinyl,2010-03-18T08:59Z,"Low bit rates but still excellent quality, thanks to matroska format. "
[T],zeromancer,2010-04-10T09:14Z,"well, to elaborate on that; it's not because of matroska. Matroska, like avi, is just a container. It's all about the codec, x264 in this case which is one of the better codecs out there.

penandpike; just ignore the minuses, it's a nice up and I know how pains taking and time consuming it is to re encode this stuff.

Thanks for an awesome up. 

Keep it up!"
,ebf1220,2010-06-18T07:41Z,"sorry to say, this download sucks, since 1 week only 12kbs, looks like no one want to share"
,pnfkwfl,2010-06-18T17:12Z,OUTSTANDING collection.  Thank you for your efforts
,bv_abhi,2010-08-06T14:10Z,thanks to penandpike for the hard work
,skykng955,2010-08-06T21:14Z,"u know, why encode..reduce quality bigtime and size to a standard 4.7 dvd. These arent gonna fit onto a dvd if u decided to make into a dvd. Plus, if u do, some scenes in the movies will show a huge amount of pixals, and thats cus of the way the rencoding of all the files. Just download 1080p movies that are like 6gigs or bigger."

,gregersamsa,2010-09-05T08:42Z,Thanks a lot for the effort! Very nicely done!
,dielaughing,2010-09-08T12:26Z,"Hey fuck ass.. MKV sucks ass.. you've now officially joined the lowest of the ranks by putting this file format out into the pool of torrents.. may your machine become corrupted with many viruses and force you to redo everything. MKV is the absolute WORST video format available.. next to FLV and WMA and QuickTime.. MKV is at the top of the shitlist of unsuitable video format and it takes about 24 hours to properly convert just 1 film to a more civilized AVI format.. or even mpg, but not MKV! Why can't you people get it straight? MKV blows, with teeth! I sense chafige around the base of my **** Rot with your MKV files ignorant fool!!!"
,ssmurple,2010-09-12T02:46Z,"
@dielaughing  You are stupid for saying all that shit about the mkv format.  It is an open standard free container format unlike the other formats you mention.  Regardless, the format is much less important compared to the bit rate quality of sound and audio chosen when encoding in a format.  Learn about technology before commenting on it."
,JesiahCarver,2010-09-24T22:18Z,@dielaughing Was this your one shot at trying to sound like you actually know something? Such a shame you had to screw it up. I'm sorry. *pats you on the back*
,vita10,2010-10-20T11:10Z,"EXCELLENT QUALITY!  

I don't know what everyone's yapping about, but I just checked the videos and they're cristal clear.

Although the difference between some movies is 30 min. but the file sizes are the same??

Very WIDE format...seeing these old movies in bluray is great.

21days in only 83% done. longest download, EVER!

One of the best UPs EVER!  Will SEED until 2.0 ratio.

OTHERS SEED. Engage. Make it so.  Energize. Do it. Proceed. Resistance is futile.

This is not a drill.

,ODBC,2010-10-24T14:25Z,"Thank you very much for sharing this diamond collection.

Live long and Prosper."
,naughtygirl,2010-10-27T13:19Z,"I found some screens from a a different tor site ...

It would appear that the low file size has resulted poor compression."
,luka3rd,2010-11-29T13:25Z,"Just to say: longest download EVER!!!
for 45 days!!!! I am on 24% and already on 0.7 ratio! Tragic...
I'll be on 2:1 before I finish it!
I wanned to cancel it a 100 times..."
,RaandJ04,2010-12-29T18:46Z,Thanks so much LOVE these movies! Seed please Im sitting at four days!
,sirpip,2011-08-28T22:09Z,"WTF, people?!  I've been sitting at 5 kbps download for the past week!  The current ETA is approx. 1,500 hours (about 9 months)!

Please SEED!!  And those of you who are seeding, please increase the upload bandwidth cap to more than 1 or 2 kbps!

As it stands right now, this is a DEAD TORRENT.  This is the best Trek movies torrent available, so please bring it back to life by SEEDING!"
,sirpip,2011-08-28T22:11Z,"Bah typo.  ETA is approx. 6,500 hours, not 1,500.

SOMEBODY SEED THIS PLZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
