Norah has taken a new direction on the The Fall, experimenting with different
sounds and a new set of collaborators, including Jacquire King, a noted producer
and engineer who has worked with Kings of Leon, Tom Waits, and Modest Mouse
among others. Jones enlisted several songwriting collaborators, including Ryan
Adams and Okkervil Riverâ€™s Will Sheff, as well as her frequent partner Jesse
Harris. Jones also put together a new group of musicians to perform on the album,
including drummers Joey Waronker (Beck, R.E.M.) and James Gadson (Bill
Withers), keyboardist James Poyser (Erykah Badu, Al Green), and guitarists Marc
Ribot (Tom Waits, Elvis Costello) and Smokey Hormel (Johnny Cash, Joe
Strummer).
