My favorite Christmas songs. Tried to get the original artists for most, but settling for older artists singing the song to the original tune. None of this over-singing the song and killing it, making it my own BS that the more modern artists do. I really hate it when people that.

Couldn't find a torrent like this - although I didn't go to extremes to find one, just checked the usual places - so I'm making one for everyone. Had to go as far as ripping some of the songs fromto get a version sung by a decent artist. Enjoy!

PLEASE SEED! I pay per gigabyte here, and I'm broke so I can't afford to seed this indefinitely!
