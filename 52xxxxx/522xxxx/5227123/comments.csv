,Garr255,2009-12-19T23:44Z,"Sweet thanks, master!"
,Garr255,2009-12-19T23:45Z,"@ k-kid
How do I become a moderator?"
,tpbmaster,2009-12-20T22:29Z,"Yeah, great, what can I say k-kid...I didn't knew... I have that program still on my PC and it's not ""infected""...... whatever..... will keep uploading...."
,alexjuuhh,2009-12-23T19:32Z,And is this torrent infected? :)
,tpbmaster,2009-12-23T20:15Z,No it's not....it's safe
,xlFireman,2009-12-27T17:35Z,"Thank you very much, I've been looking for good anti-virus software and that Norton Trial reset is very annoying to use"
,Rory129,2009-12-31T01:04Z,Ty I had one then summat happend and my identaty protection ran out + i dno wots that mod goin on about maby it his computer?
,hostage24,2009-12-31T20:40Z,"Works like a charm my master, thanks."
,Shadow_Jedi,2010-01-01T03:10Z,"@ tpbmaster: Thanks a lot for this torrent! I have a copy of this and it is far superior to any virus protection program I've used thus far. I had purchased System Mechanic for several years and although it works fine now for an automated internal mechanic tool it's virus and firewall capabilities have been wiped away and they really let me down, in that regards, as a customer. It's hard to find a trustworthy virus uploader and my current copy of AVG is about to run out. If this works for eight more years, as you claim, than this is an EXCELLENT, torrent! That along with the number of downloaders and the fact that a moderator has commented on this upload makes me feel very safe about this upload. Thats harsh that you got demoted, however, its seems as though you have a lot of loyal fans so if you keep up the good uploads perhaps the mod team will have a change of heart. Thanks again tpbmaster!  "
,deimos2289,2010-01-02T14:33Z,"thanx you master^^u r the best..hope the key will never get blacklisted.....
:-)"
,karl6969,2010-01-05T02:20Z,this works awsom... thanks
,Shadow_Jedi,2010-01-05T12:40Z,"@ Downloaders: FYI, the key works to the game until the year 2018. However, after a week of installing it mine was reset to April of this year. Please message back if anyone has the problem. Thanks."
,fta009,2010-01-06T02:40Z,"Yes, it does reset to April 2010. Is there a fix for this?"
,star_child88,2010-01-06T05:33Z,"I had a version also that was good until 2018 and a few days ago it changed to expire on April 5, 2010 also."
,tpbmaster,2010-01-08T14:41Z,"Maybe try to Re-actiate your license key or something... 
I still have it until 2018
I'll try to find out what is the problem..."
,Camazotz,2010-01-09T16:52Z,Good job man... Norton sucked ass. :D Keep 'er going!
,dellis01,2010-01-12T15:33Z,"You have to reactivate it when it goes to April 2010. I just went to help, activate and re-entered the serial from this torrent, it is back to 2/25/2018"
,crossfire6,2010-01-13T03:13Z,"Okay, this was great and really appreciate the tpbmaster for this.  BUT, I think maybe AVG finally got this number if you know what I mean.  I used this successfully for a good while, but now it only lasts a few days and then pops up a window that says AVG ""changed"" the key and advised that the serial used was invalid.  At that point the program's expiration is changed to April 2010.
This happens to me on my laptop and desktop, both running Win 7, but I can't say about other OS's.  "
,crossfire6,2010-01-13T03:15Z,"P.S.  I tried the reactivation thing with the same serial# also, but it went back to April 2010 again within a couple days.  Probably after a trip or two to the server.  Just FYI..."
,thebaldgod,2010-01-13T23:25Z,Key is no longer valid..mine got removed this afternoon and put back in trial version
,tpbmaster,2010-01-14T13:51Z,"This key is no longer valid!!!
It was valid for first 20 days but now no longer...
But, I still have it untill 2018... I don't get it...
I'll remove/delete torrent soon
Enyoj!"
,Hackboy,2010-01-14T16:49Z,"The serials that you and everyone else is using to give the software a validation until Feb 2018 has been around for over a year. There was a group of serials for AVG 8.5 that all the ""lamers"" started using to register 9.0 when it came out a few months ago. Now, since the same serials are being used by more than the license allows, they are throwing up red flags at AVG and they are no longer working. AVG is ""allowing"" these new installations or registrations to work on a trial basis without going after the IP addresses yet. Consider yourselves lucky for the time being.  "
,imunionjack,2010-01-16T14:56Z,"Serial validation failed. Also tried the list on here of 20 or so, seems not to like any of them. 
Ive used this b4 with no problems. Have they causght up or what??"
,xxxEVILDUDExxx,2010-01-29T01:31Z,K-KID NO OFFENCE... BUT UR A FUCKING RETARD U NOOB!!!!!!!!! ALL KEYGENS AND ILLEGAL PACHES WILL SHOW AS VIRUSES!!!!!! THIS TORRENT IS CLEAN BUT ALL KEYGEN GENERATORS SHOW AS VIRUSES DO NOT BE FOOLED!!!!!!
,cpuwizz,2010-02-01T23:39Z,"I have a couple questions for you, tpbmaster. Why is it that if i download avg myself and attempt to use the key code provided with your torrent it don't work unless, I use the link that you provided? Secondly the key you provided is also the exact same key code provided for a similar type of download for adaware? seems fishy to me. Why would the key code only work from your download link?"
,cpuwizz,2010-02-01T23:44Z,your readme file states that it downloads directly from AVG. Why would your key code just happen to be the exact same key code for an adaware program when AVG and Adaware are two seperate companies?
,[Banana],2010-02-12T19:10Z,"Nice upload! No virus. This is so simple, you don't even have to waste your time with extracting ... 
Cheers..!"
,Masta69,2010-02-17T21:20Z,Works great and no issues with serial as stated by previous posters. Thanks for the great upload.
,me_kk_55,2010-02-25T00:20Z,thanks for the super fast DL
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-04-06T16:21Z,"keys don't work anymore, they will last a few days then die. unless anyone has a new list - these lists been around forever."
,southpole165,2010-05-02T05:17Z,dont download this it doesnt work not even the installer works id scan ur computer afterwards tho
