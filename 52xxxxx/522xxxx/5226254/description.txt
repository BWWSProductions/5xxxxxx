Gabriel's Message or The angel Gabriel from heaven came (Basque: Birjina gaztetto bat zegoen) is a Basque Christmas folk carol about the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary. It quotes the biblical account of that event (Luke, Chapter 1, verses 26-38) and Mary's Magnificat (Luke 1.46-55) with the opening lines:

    The angel Gabriel from heaven came,
    his wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame;
    "All hail", said he, "thou lowly maiden Mary,
    most highly favoured lady." Gloria.

It was collected by Charles Bordes and then paraphrased into English by Sabine Baring-Gould, whose use of the lilting phrase Most highly favoured lady made it the favourite carol of Richard Harries, Bishop of Oxford. It was performed on the album A Very Special Christmas by Sting, and most recently on the album Christmas Songs by Jars of Clay.

A Very Special Christmas is the first in a series of Christmas-themed compilation albums produced to benefit Special Olympics. The album was released in 1987, and production was overseen by Jimmy Iovine for A&M Records. The cover artwork was designed by Keith Haring.
