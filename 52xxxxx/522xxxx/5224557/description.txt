25 Calculus E-Books (PDF) [Dodecahedron]


One of my earliest torrents, and one of my favorites too. Due to a database issue I couldn't upload it here until now, thanks to the mods for fixing that. Also special thanks to Tqw and Malestrom. This is the original torrent, only the best of the best. It took me a while to compile this collection so I hope you like it.
