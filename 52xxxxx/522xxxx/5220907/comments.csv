and you people complaining about no audio use vlc or media player classic home cinema"
,asfdmnbb,2010-02-01T19:05Z,"Thanks for uploading this awesome movie, i'll continue to seed for a while, 40GB so far.
Plays great on media player classic with K-Lite Codec Pack.  :)"

,xMugenx,2011-03-31T20:55Z,"There are far too many retards making comments on this site. There is both English and Japanese audio in this torrent. If you can't hear audio, then sell your computer and cut off your genitals because you're not fit for human existence. Or an easier path may be to download VLC media player or any other non-fail player along with a codec pack. Although VLC plays pretty much anything without a hitch."
,xMugenx,2011-03-31T20:57Z,"Oh and the video looks amazing, thank you.

And what do you mean what's up with the weird file size? The default size of this movie on Blu-Ray is around 20-25 GB for just the movie itself. 5 GB is nothing. This isn't a fucking DVD. It's compressed High Def."
,xMugenx,2011-03-31T21:00Z,"Oh and by the way, the video looks amazing, thank you for the up.

And what do you mean what's up with the weird file size? This movie on Blu-Ray is about 20-25 GB, and that is just the movie itself, not the entire disc with menus and extras. This is compressed High Def, not a fucking DVD. The file size can get pretty high depending on how much quality you want to retain. It doesn't matter if it's animated or not. Welcome to the world of quality high def rips."
