,Dubby09,2009-12-15T19:34Z,yepp real just tried uploading this one for him and it said torrent already already here so its real 10/10 thanks uploader
,Fox_Almighty,2009-12-16T08:36Z,"Why didn't noir upload it himself, and why would noir upload something with such low audio bitrate when clearly this movie requires a minimum of 128 - 192kbps so feel the effects of the sound in the movie?

I say I'll pass on this rip and will wait for someone better to upload the movie."
,XoLWoX,2009-12-16T13:57Z,if you havnt notice that noir is no long a member of TPB -- also that the bitrate noir has always used
,Fox_Almighty,2009-12-16T21:11Z,"I take that back, I went on another torrent site (much better then this one) and found him and his torrent there... So I guess this one is legit... but what is up with the horrible sound quality. Sound takes next to no space at all, so from 112kbps to 192kbps is maybe 10mb difference, that's it. I don't see why he'd do that"
,XoLWoX,2009-12-17T00:14Z,to keep it a 701mb file
,oosit,2009-12-17T07:58Z,"The WBZ release is the unrated version (ending with katie die, shot by the police,) but the JUMANJI and 1337x Noir release is the theatrical ending version (katie sniffing at Micah's lifeless body, then smiles at the camera before lunging toward it and the screen smash cuts to black and the credits roll). check imdb."

,merlin_ie,2010-10-31T01:05Z,thanks to numbnuts for giving away the ending
