Redsn0w 0.8 (iPhone 3GS Jailbreak)

The iPhone Dev Team released their lastest iPhone and iPod Touch jailbreaking tool Redsn0w 0.8. 
Im sure most of you are wondering whats new, since the 0.7 version of redsn0w was released not to long ago. Whats new? This release is now able to jailbreak the new iPhone 3GS. I havenâ€™t been able to confirm it but iâ€™ve heard the dev team also updated ultrasn0w, the iPhone OS 3.0 unlocking to work with the 3GS. While this isnâ€™t the first jailbreak for the 3GS, it is way more stable and safer than the other method.I used it on my sisters 3gs and worked a charm - Enjoy!
