,scratchbomber,2010-02-02T12:35Z,Someone should upload Over the Top rifftrax.

,deadspaced,2010-10-31T08:22Z,"Very much appreciate the upload, but this is in dire need of normalization. In order to hear the movie track at so much as a whisper, the volume has to be cranked to the point where the riff track could be used for riot control.

Again, very thankful for the upload. Just thought I'd offer some constructive criticism. "
