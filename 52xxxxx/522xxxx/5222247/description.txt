[b][color=red]Storyline:[/color][/b] [b][i]An adolescent named Max has an active imagination, and he will 
throw fits if others don't go along with what he wants. Max, following an incident with Claire (his sister) 
and her friends, and following a tantrum which he throws as a result of his Mother paying more attention to 
her boyfriend than to him - runs away from home. Wearing his wolf costume at the time, Max not only runs away 
physically, but runs toward a world in his imagination. This world, an ocean away, is inhabited by large wild 
beasts, including one named Carol who is much like Max himself in temperament. Instead of eating Max like they 
normally would with creatures of his type, the wild things befriend Max after he proclaims himself a king who 
can magically solve all their problems.[/i][/b]
