,jenotron,2009-12-16T19:03Z,"SecretMyth's rips never work on the Apple TV. A lot of people have to wait for Westy's rips because of this. Please make adjustments. I much prefer adding artwork, tags etc and keeping my films in iTunes rather than watching off a pen drive on the PS3."
,TommyBlade2018,2009-12-16T19:40Z,Thanks King

Please stop bitch*** about adjustments either take or ignore it. 
Be grateful and enjoy the movie for free.

Thanks SecretMyth. "

,bharatrn,2009-12-17T06:15Z,"Thanks myth..
I know you will be uploading Ponyo in the near future.Please try to make it a dual audio rip with English and Japanese.
Movies are usually meant to be watched in their original languages."

,darin_god,2009-12-19T00:00Z,"


Okay, I just tried to play it on my ps3, it won't work through the flash drive.

Am I doing something wrong?


I know these movies work perfect with amazing quality if I burn them on a dvd, but that takes a lot of time.  I'd like to use a flash drive plugged straight into my ps3.

any help?"
,drbadass,2009-12-20T07:05Z,"thanks for the movie secret myth, but can you please continue to upload the alternate audio so we can use YAMB and have better sound when playing it on xbox. thanks. "
