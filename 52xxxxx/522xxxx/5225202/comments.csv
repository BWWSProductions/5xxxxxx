,meskalin64,2010-02-18T04:47Z,Bad quality and crappy playback.
,rrpostal,2010-02-27T02:00Z,"any other comments on the quality? I'm going back and getting good copies of some old movies I like. So I usually am not picky at all, but since it takes so much time for these huge files, I'd like to be sure they're as advertised.

Thanks, btw."
,Mitsanaga,2010-05-24T01:34Z,"dont worry about what mescalin64 says, the ps3 team rips have always worked fine for me, on my computer and directly by dvd or copied on my ps3. mescalin64 probably just has a shitty computer that cant play 1080i or higher material. "
,tfr777,2010-09-05T23:59Z,"Thanks, Suavecito!!!

Perfect and balanced quality, it's the only Full HD movie I've seen that fits onto 4.5GB DVD.
The movie is brutal but charming, must have! "

,Ps3shaman,2011-02-10T22:04Z,Does the file has embedded subtitles for playback on ps3. By the way if anyone knows are to  include subtitles in a movie file so it reads them on ps3 let us know
,Ripadysplit,2011-02-10T23:48Z,Are the subtitles hardcoded ???
