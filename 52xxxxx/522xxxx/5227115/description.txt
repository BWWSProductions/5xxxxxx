Shaun is a sheep who doesnâ€™t follow the flock â€“ in fact, he leads them into all sorts of scrapes and scraps, turning peace in the valley into mayhem in the meadow.

Shaun and his pals run rings around their poor sheepdog Bitzer, as he tries to stop the Farmer finding out whatâ€™s going on behind his back.

Every day brings a new adventure for Shaun â€“ a stray cabbage bouncing into the field turns into a football feud with the Naughty Pigs.

NFO:
So at the start of this whole messy saga we noted that the bbc had the current run of episodes listed as season 2, however imdb, wikipedia amongst very many others had the current run of episodes listed either season 3 or unknown, on top of this we had dvdrips of the previous run which were released as season 2. Since this time many web pages have updated their pages to follow the bbc, imdb has not at the time of writing this nfo.

So what we are going to do is this, complete the current run as is, then issue a dirfix for the complete set of current eps, knowing the bbc and others they will probably at some point in the future change the labelling again anyway just to confuse things even more.
