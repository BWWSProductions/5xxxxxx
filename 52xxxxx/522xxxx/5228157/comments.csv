[V],Big_dude,2009-12-20T05:37Z,"Well 7 Blades would be something Id have to buy at ebay couldn't find it on the net plus its an import.

I may just buy it on ebay after christmas used on for $25.00 I think then when I get it I'll of course try to upload it.

Thing is I have to buy some other games on ebay like sega bass fishing duel for ps2 and others, so If I have enough money I'll upload it."
[V],Big_dude,2009-12-20T05:41Z,"Wait I need to know are talking about the Pal or Japan version, if japan it won't be in english if pal
I can try to patch it to Ntsc format for you though
the screen offset won't be perfect.

Let me know Pal or Japan?"
[V],Big_dude,2009-12-20T05:42Z,7 Blades came out for Japan and the UK (Pal).
[V],Big_dude,2009-12-20T05:43Z,If its pal let me know if you want it patched to ntsc other wise if you don't have the pal standard the screen will roll and be unplayable.
,theebheart,2009-12-20T21:52Z,"hey Big_dude its really no need to buy it
unless i share the price but i don't have a credit card, so thank you any way"
,theebheart,2009-12-20T21:55Z,happy christmas by the way
[V],Big_dude,2009-12-20T22:31Z,"some cd type ps2 games cannot be converted.

just so you know."
,theebheart,2009-12-20T23:48Z,as for me both systems are playable
[V],Big_dude,2009-12-21T01:44Z,for playablity reasons concerning 7 blades Id go with uk version patched to ntsc if I can get it.
,theebheart,2009-12-21T06:51Z,its up to you Big_Dude you are the master
[V],Big_dude,2009-12-23T13:42Z,"Well mr. bean was a bust did get it to work rebuilt to dvd however patching to ntsc crashes the game just goes blank after the ps2 logo.

This is common in some pal games not all can be patched because the the way they structured the game or coded it.

Mr. bean can be downloaded at gamestorrents theres no need for me to upload it."
[V],Big_dude,2009-12-23T13:44Z,I'll try eventually on some cd type ps2 if I can get them online or cheap.
,afgaviria,2009-12-25T18:16Z,"finally yesterday burned the game (drakengard 1) and works perfect, thanks you very much dude!!! and happy holidays!!"
