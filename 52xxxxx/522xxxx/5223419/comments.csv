[i]Update: 12/22/2009

DECAF wasn't fake. It did what it was set out to do and did it well, we just respect authority and experts in the field and would rather promote a positive move then a negative one.

Some will understand, some will not. We did not remove the tool because of Microsoft. In fact, they did not even release a statement until after the tool was pulled offline. Going after major corporations like Microsoft is no easy task. Just understand we did what we feel is best for the safety and well being of our nation and other governments.
