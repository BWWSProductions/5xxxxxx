Books by the Master Franz Bardon are unparalleled in the world of magick. What Crowley could not do, Master Bardon does. Instead of bragging about himself like Crowley, Master Bardon gets directly to the matter of making Hermetic science accessible to ALL. The first book explained the basic techniques and theory of magick. This second volume described the Solar Hierarchy of Intelligences and beings that are part of our universe. With the same care and delicacy, Master Bardon explains in theory then goes direct into practice. There are no blinds, tricks, or games like Crowley, but direct and to the point information. Master Bardon takes the student step by step in order to become an initiate.
