Before shakin' stevens became a popabilly idol in the 1980s he was a rockabilly rebel in the 1970s,this is a selection of pre-fame shakin' stevens songs i put together myself from my collection [yes i have a shaky collection]...he was lead singer with shakin' stevens & the sunsets throughout the 70s and theres quite a lot of songs from those days on this compilation(no 80s chart hits here),so if your a fan of popabilly shaky.....get ready for rockabilly shaky.
