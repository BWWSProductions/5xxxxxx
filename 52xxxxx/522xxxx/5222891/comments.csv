The first 3 minutes 30 seconds of this movie are a bit shaky and blurry. After the 3:30 mark, the quality is a lot better. The camera angle is a bit off and doesn't show the whole screen so some text is illegible. Audio is pretty good after the 3:30 mark, but is kind of tinny. (not enough bass)

Overall - V:6  A:5

To the genius who said this is ""copied inside a cinema""---This is a TS (Telesync) which is a handheld or tripod camera inside a theater and synched up with direct line audio.

A CAM version uses the handheld camera's microphone so you end up hearing the audience and/or the camera operator."

,kgerry69,2010-01-01T12:59Z,"The audio is great 8/10. The video isnt the best, 5/10 but with vlc player, you can adjust it to whatever the best it can be. Well done TvTeam. And its not a fake(Buns 42. its a fucking fake like all the others). Some people Really need to just be thankfull for what they can get for free. "
,tsd6,2010-01-11T19:58Z,"buns42 and suppepik seem to be commenting on a large number of known real releases that they are fake.

You don't imagine that there might be black info coming out from a few hired hands by the studios, do you?

This is real. There was one uploaded a few days ago that was a fake, or at least it required some BS codec download. TPB quickly nuked it off the site.

Skulls are not an automatic indication of it being great, or possibly even real, but it sure is a very high chance. Should one of those accounts get compromised, I think the admin team (living on the islands, drinking ""boat drinks"") would fix it pretty quick. "
