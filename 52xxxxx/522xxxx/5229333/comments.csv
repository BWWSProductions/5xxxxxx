Hey, go ahead and run yourself ragged trying to please everyone. I was basically saying that it was more exciting when you posted rare stuff that was true to your heart than spending most of your time filling everyone's requests. I'm glad that you finally found a way to get some ""recognition"" in your life. Maybe now that you have all of this newfound confidence, you can give a try at creating something of your own instead of just collecting it.

,pafbrown,2009-12-20T01:42Z,"Kraftvox - without wishing to piss anyone off or start a thing, personally I'm greatful to the likes of 80zforever in uploading what he does. I'm originally from NZ and now reside in Australia and I agree with 80z, what appears to be routine to you can be extremly rare for me to get a hold of. Besides who decides what is rare and what is not anyway? NZ didn't have to bad an alternative scene back in the day but most Aussie (Sydney) music retailers aren't interested in anything other than the current chart toppers and those second hand places that do stock rarer stuff charge an absolute fortune for it (a point that always seems to get missed in the file sharing vs artist missing out on earnings from sales but I digress). With the internet and guys like 80z, torchomatic etc I've not only managed to get the older stuff I used to have I've also been introduced to a whole lot of stuff that I missed first time around. Your argument seems kinda petty and irrelevant. Cheers for the latest upload 80z!"
,Kraftvox,2009-12-20T02:29Z,"I'm glad for the postings that 80zforever has posted also. I just remember a time when 80zforever use to get annoyed at commonplace requests. He was annoyed and slightly hurt by the lack of gratitude and the preponderance of requests. He and torchomatic set the bar for rare torrents. It seemed that instead of growing a thicker skin, 80zforever, did a 180 and started to cater to requests that if one just took the time and put a little effort in to it can be easily found on other torrent site and blogs.  I guess praise is better than criticism. I realize now I?ve been a little harsh. I think I?m just jaded because it use to take a lot work to find and get a hold of rare 80s music and along came torchomatic and 80zforever posting some of the rarest torrents I?ve ever seen and now I have to wade through the requests from the individuals to catch up with their ?Wishlists? Like I mentioned before, most of the requests I?ve seen for 80zforever are posted on other sites and blogs. Torchomatic quit posting because he was tired of the mundane requests and the comments about bitrate and 80zforever now spends most of his time catering to request so he can get some positive feedback. Oh well it nice while it lasted. "
,JettBlack9,2009-12-20T04:23Z,All I can say is Thank You 80zforever...
,teddydiaz,2009-12-20T06:47Z,"kraftvox, yes you are harsh, arrogant and ungrateful. in my book, you're one of those guys who think they know it all, yet rely on others to get their stuff.  

if you don't like it, get lost. sheez..."
,Kraftvox,2009-12-20T07:41Z,teddydiaz. You have no idea what you are talking about. I'm hardly arrogant or ungrateful. I have been trading and collecting music for over 30 years. I rarely rely on others to get their stuff. Several torrents floating around come from my collection. I have given away hundreds of copies from my collection of which I acquired the old fashion way by countless hard work spent tracking down & by shelling out hard earned cash. I think you are being a little harsh now. 
,Kraftvox,2009-12-20T08:36Z,"Wait a minute why am I wasting my time refuting these comments. I have given away copies of music from my collection several times over. Everyday on my blog I fill request from my collection. I rarely take trades in return. I fulfill people's wish list every day. 80zforever has been posting here for over two years. Half of the time most of the lechers do not ever bother to thank him. Most of the comments posted, only include requests for him to fill. He ends up with several dead torrents because very few continue to seed. I have a question! Why hasn't any one else posted 80s torrents to fill in the gap and take care of some the commonplace torrents so he doesn't have to be the only one posting rare 80's stuff on TPB???? It has been over two years and no one has joined in. So don't call me arrogant, I spend several hours a week fulfilling ""wish lists"" for people. There are very few people out there that I can get anything from that I don't already have in my collection. Why??? , because I have spent thousands & thousands of dollars and years working on my collection. Why do I have an attitude? Not because I spend several hours a week sharing my collection with people who have nothing to trade, but one of the few places I had to find music that I had forgot about or just don't have has been replaced with request site for commonplace torrents that I see posted at several other sites and blogs all there for the taking only if one would do the groundwork. EaT mY aSS !"
,Punkturednoize,2009-12-20T13:43Z,"Hey guys, cool it. If we all both share the same interest in music, we should not be talking to each other like this. Let's just enjoy the 80's music, that's what should keep us united no matter what opinion each of us have. Let's just have fun and share whatever music you want to share just like what 80z is doing. Merry Christmas to all. Peace to all of us."
,erikphnx,2009-12-20T22:11Z,"I don't want to fan the flames but I really need to say this. I am one of those who has made requests.  I never ""expected"" the request to be filled. I was just letting 80z know I was looking for it and if he had it and if he wished to post it that would be cool. Once he was able t complete my request and I was very happy as I had been looking for that LP for quite some time. I can also tell you that I have personally enjoyed listening to the LPs that were posted as a result of a request. 80z keep up the awesome work."
,JettBlack9,2009-12-21T04:09Z,"Not all of us have USB turntables; I am getting one for Christmas but I don't have a place to put it yet---severe space limitations.
As for uploading obscure CDs? I tried it but I guess I'm an idiot.  I failed.
I have requested some items from 80zforever--stuff I already own on vinyl --like Ebn-Ozn. 
So 80zforever has been nice. What is wrong with that?  If you wish to dump on him wait until March.  It's not the time of year for that. 
I applaud him for bring some obscure music to light --and another fact: I have tracked down and bought at least 15 albums because 80zforever introduced me to their music.
JettBlack9---Alan"
,obsqr,2009-12-22T17:37Z,"This is just a divisive conversation.  Obviously we're all interested in music, in this case from the 80's, although I'm not married to this era.  I too, have a vast collection that I'm willing to share.  My problem is prioritization.  I've also learned here that quantity is not quality.  80zforever has astounded me with his ability to quickly come up with some of the items that I've been searching for.  Granted, with more effort I could have found them, and even bought them.  I actually have bought some of the items I've seen here, not just listed as rare but listed as favorites of others.  I've always asked at record stores,'What do you like?' to help me find new things.  Now, I pay I have a few titles in the back of my head to pick up if I see them in the used bins.  I regret that people like torchomatic, who I'm not familiar with, felt they had to stop doing what they probably loved, because of perceived pressure.  Kraftvox makes some good points.  Without seeding, eventually all we will have is repetitive requests.  I will endeavor to get some of my collection up for everyones enjoyment.  I hope that Kraftvox and others here, that may have gems in their collections, will offer them as well, to make all our new year that much richer.  This will be my new years resolution.  I look forward to your postings, 80z, and I thank you for the items you've given me offline, Marc Seberg, the Mary Onettes, and the Death of Samantha, among others.  As a Christmas present, I'll work on getting the Gary Wright that another writer can't get up on the net, and anything else I might have that people will request here.  I have to start somewhere.  Happy holidays and happy listening to you all.  By the way, I have 4 Jack Green albums, want them all?"
,rockaway99,2009-12-23T18:47Z,"Well, isn't this getting interesting. It really shows just how much passion we all have for our music. I think it's great that people such as 80zforever are making this music available for others who are unable to locate it elsewhere. And, yes, some of it may not exactly be what one may term ""rare"", but to many it is exactly that, depending on where they live and what their technical abilities may be. I am one who has made many requests and am very grateful that some of these have been filled. To show my appreciation I have posted several albums that I noticed were not available on TPB. True, most of these are not rare either, but many have downloaded them, showing that they were wanted. If everybody did the same with their music collection, we would all be much happier. By the way, obsqr, Humanesque is the only Jack Green album I have ever heard, but if you have more I would be glad to hear them too. Thanks again evrybody."
,blingpig,2009-12-25T07:23Z,"I'll chime in too. Almost everything 80z has posted is new to me. I am more into progressive music and barely touched this scene back when I was buying records. I bought records by artists such as Ogi in the 80z. The pitiful plight of radio  makes it impossible to hear something that shows a bit of eclecticism. I would be hard pressed to even consider buying one of these bands on CD. It's not like the old days when you could pick up a record and look at the band members, see the instrumentation, and make a decision to buy that record. Sorry, showing my age but I go back to the sixties in musical awareness. It's hard for me to believe a critism would come about from anyone. Move along to somewhere else if you feel it has become stagnant in here. I believe you still rock Mr. Z, and I for one am grateful for the music you have posted!"
,madopal,2009-12-26T18:37Z,"Hey, great stuff 80z, can't thank you enough for helping to save all of this great damn-close-to-impossible-to-find stuff.  

Any chance you have the Wire Train albums In A Chamber or Between Two Worlds?  There's only one torrent up for it, and it's stuck with a bunch of people and no one to finish it..."
,yuppefish,2009-12-26T19:50Z,"I personally am grateful for everything that 80z has posted - all of it was new to me - and I have been guilty of asking for what was available elsewhere (I didn't know it - but I found it later)

The point is - THANK YOU 80z.

Seriously. Stop drinking haterade Kraftvox. What you want is as much a request as anything else.

Post whatever you want 80z - I love it all."
,white_arcades,2009-12-31T17:25Z,"Haha, this Kraftvox is an absolute fucking tool. He sneers at 80z for 'collecting instead of creating' and in his next post describes himself as a trader and collector of 30 years. Fucking imbecile. I can't help but laugh at the genuine injustice he feels at having to 'wade through other people's requests'. How cruel life is to deal him such a fate.

Kraftvox, you are in all probability the first human being to be conceived during anal sex and as such your opinions aren't worth shit. 

One day Kraftvox, you may be lucky enough to achieve coitus with the opposite sex. Until then, please refrain from venting your frustrations with this undignified drivel. Goodbye.

Comedy genius!"
,fanciz,2009-12-31T22:04Z,"I think that the master word on a site like this one, is tolerance. People have different tastes and so be it. Let's get what we like and discard what we don't like, as simple as that. Uploading music here is already an act of love in view of the little rewards that we get, there is no point of pressuring the uploader to do this or that. 
Anyway, let's keep cool among gentlemen and happy New Year to all.

Madopal: I have all the CD's of Wire Train but since the album that U cited is already posted, I have uploaded another one that includes most of their good songs."
,teddydiaz,2010-01-01T05:03Z,"well said white_arcades, well said... 
cheers my main man!"
,Kraftvox,2010-01-01T23:57Z,"white_arcades, I do agree with teddydiaz, those comments you made were well stated. You definitely have a command of Homoerotic verbiage. Of course white_arcades, you being raised by two Gay Fathers would make anyone question their sexuality and lash out with Homophobic rage. Statically, you do not have to worry yourself. It is stated that most children raised by same sex parents, like you, do not necessary turn out to be homosexual. In your case white_arcades, you being a hermaphrodite, which does not really apply to you. You can have sex with either genders and that does not qualify you as a homosexual. What you might want to do is see a doctor to find out, white_arcades, if what you do have between your legs is a tiny penis or an enlarged clitoris. Given your limited intelligence, this might help you in dealing with some of your anger and fears about your latent homosexuality."
,white_arcades,2010-01-02T23:28Z,"Kraftvox, you seem to forget you've laid your pathetic little life bare in your petty, whining posts, filling us all in on your lonely 30 years as a joyless, obsessive LP hoarder and lambasting anyone who dares oblige another user instead of relentlessly uploading wilfully obscure records for your sole purpose of expanding your impossibly large and pointless collection. 

Knowing nothing about me, you've now embarrassingly reduced yourself to wild and frankly unfunny conjecture presumably in a bid to settle some kind of score. Since you have no dignity left here on TPB, and no uploads either, please entertain the bretheren further by continuing your imaginary biography of my good self. 

By the way, even taking into account the fact that you're an overwrought individual, I'm not really sure how the mere mention of anal sex constitutes 'homephobic rage'. I guess you wouldn't know, but 'a bit of the other' is no longer something associated solely with homosexuality. Just to be clear, its 80s music we're uploading, the actual 80s ended a couple of decades ago. You need to get out more.

Anyhow, just to correct your misunderstanding, I genuinely couldn't care less about your orientation, my issue is that you're an utter prick. Many people here seem to agree, but since you're manifestly a crank you'll no doubt put that down to a conspiracy. Now like I say, please continue your biog...."
,white_arcades,2010-01-03T00:13Z,"One final question Kraftvox:

Why did you find it homoerotic when i referred to you as the spawn of shit?

To the users of TPB:

Does anyone have something really really rare to upload to keep this oddball cunt from crying further? (apologies for any potentially misogynistic verbiage employed herein)"
,arl0011,2010-01-04T14:54Z,"thanks for another round of rare hits 80z!
happy new year!"
,smucktor,2010-01-11T12:55Z,"plese, tell us, mighty 80zforever, since you are God, how do you find life on Earth to be? like the food?"
,smurphyzeke,2011-03-05T01:53Z,Thanks
