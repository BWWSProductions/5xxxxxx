I was finally able to get down and put together another rare 80s mix after an ultra hectic few weeks! Now seasonâ€™s greetings from your dedicated 80s uploader! Itâ€™s time to explore more obscure 80s and enjoy some really good songs.   I will upload your requests as well during x-mas holidays. To the user who made a comment that I should ignore the requests and get on uploading just rare records: I am sorry, I just post whatever I like and whenever I feel like posting. This includes usersâ€™ request. You gotta realize not everyone is an avid collector and the music which has become routine to you might have been on someoneâ€™s wish list forever.
