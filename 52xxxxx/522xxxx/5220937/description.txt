================


Japanese for Everyone was only available on tapes, at a ludicrous price.
Nowadays you can't get them, even if you wanted to.

Someone has made an audio CD from the first tape (lessons 01-07) and shared it
as an ISO. But seeding an uncompressed audio  was a pain in the butt for everyone.
So, it has been taken care of. Sound quality has been improved through denoising,
most of the 'tape noise' has been removed, then encoded with Ogg Vorbis Q2.

Tape 2 and 3 were copied, recorded and transoded by a generous - but actually
never seen - friend. He made directly MP3s from the tapes and I was in
no position to complain. They are as is, quality is not that bad, anyway.

Enjoy.
