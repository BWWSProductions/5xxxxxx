,tsd6,2010-01-11T11:43Z,"buns42 and suppepik seem to be commenting on a large number of known real releases that they are fake.

You don't imagine that there might be black info coming out from a few hired hands by the studios, do you?

This is real. There was one uploaded a few days ago that was a fake, or at least it required some BS codec download. TPB quickly nuked it off the site.

Skulls are not an automatic indication of it being great, or possibly even real, but it sure is a very high chance. Should one of those accounts get compromised, I think the admin team (living on the islands, drinking ""boat drinks"") would fix it pretty quick."
