,JPeterson,2009-12-28T00:07Z,Anyone got a Bluray source?
,baltic8,2010-01-01T15:11Z,"the correct question would be ""does anyone want to share a bluray source?"" ;)"
,AlexTyrrell,2010-01-03T14:36Z,"I'm half way through downloading the first 8 episodes on another torrent. Could you do us a massive favor and share just the last two episodes, I'd be really appreciative and I'm sure the other 4965 leechers would be too! Cheers :)"
,baltic8,2010-01-03T23:52Z,"Alex, when you download this torrent, just tell your torrent program to save the content at the same location, where you saved those 8 episodes, and youll be fine "
,Sanderson88,2010-01-14T20:12Z,"I found it faster to download all of them one by one. There are too many leechers to seeders, just search for BBC Life and download each episode. "

"
,z00t.z00t,2010-01-18T20:50Z,sanderson is right the ratio of seed:leech is much lower for the torrent in the link above but the speed is still shit
,oiasheeda,2010-02-13T03:14Z,Seed please!
,ampism,2010-02-18T22:39Z,"I have just spent FIVE months downloading this.It finally came down yesterday.I just tried to watch it,first on X-box media center,which plays just about anything,then on VLC on my mac.Both are fucked.When something that has taken a day or 2 to d'load doesn't work then it doesn't really bother me,but FIVE bloody months? What in god's name is an MKV file? Most unhappy...."
,rrandom,2010-02-21T00:41Z,"ampism:

Matroska (MKV)/h.264 is the de facto standard for HD rips. VLC plays them fine on all of my machines -- Windows and Linux. Then again, it sounds like your computer with its 56k connection is a real dinosaur, so I doubt it could even handle HD playback anyway."
,pesja,2010-03-03T19:27Z,"Please seed, I've been struggling with this download for days now. "
,Flopis,2010-03-24T17:37Z,10xs for a good up!
,Awookie,2010-03-27T12:36Z,"Thx for up, watching the American redub with Oprah narrating makes me want to kill myself"
[V],Alia_Erenel,2010-03-31T02:44Z,Moved to Highres - TV Shows.
,patraikos,2010-04-01T07:41Z,"Downloaded: 317 MB

How can I stop this waste please?"
,allrockedout,2010-04-02T04:55Z,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5471108/BBC_-_Life_(10_Episodes)_%5BBDRip_720p%5D i downloaded this one in 1 day great quality as well
,agentx216,2010-04-03T01:56Z,I'm having a problem getting narration audio.  I have the background sounds and music...but no narrator.  I am using the latest VLC...any suggestions?  Thanks.
,burgwinkel,2010-04-08T11:05Z,"Visually rich but fast moving, with Attenborough uncharacteristically bounding off to another subject before his usual thorough explanation of the last was even fully started.  If you are used to David Attenborough in the 'Secret Life of...' sequence of series, or can remember 'Life on Earth', where exhaustive research and thoroughness carried the day, 'Life' pales in comparison.  What this gains in HD, it loses in descriptions and explanation.  The seemingly immortal Sir David--creeping up on 90--can be forgiven for attending this production in studio only, as narrator. But I wish he had pressed some of his indisputable influence toward getting more info about life into such an ambitiously titled series as 'Life'.  "
,godswallops,2010-04-09T14:50Z,"That's a fair comment, burgwinkel.

Visually, this series is stunning. It is also ""feels"" too short or perhaps shallow.

My kids and I still love it, though. :-)"
,godswallops,2010-04-09T15:00Z,"... Oh yeah, I am still seeding this - probably have at least another week to give back all that I downloaded.

Cheers"
,SnapperNZ,2010-04-25T01:23Z,there is a very fast 17GB version on rarbg
,SnapperNZ,2010-04-25T01:25Z,"And to elaborate, as TPB seem to block half my comments - search t o r r e n tz dot c o m for BBC Life and there's a 17GB version listed - that one is the one which I'm downloading and it's absolutely flying down!"
,SnapperNZ,2010-04-25T01:27Z,"Just google this

""How.Earth.Made.Us.2010.720p.BluRay.DTS.x264-HDxT rarbg""

Simples!"
,SnapperNZ,2010-04-25T01:40Z,"Oh FFS - I've posted on the wrong TPB thread, sorry folks - I was meant to post on the How Earth Made Us torrent/thread - as you can probably tell!"
,aryary,2010-05-11T04:02Z,"Don't know about you guys, but this downloaded very well for me. Got it in a few hours, avg speed about 650 kb/s. 

Anyway, great quality. V&A are perfect! 

Will be seeding this one for some time :)"
,aryary,2010-05-14T15:00Z,"Want to add something: The narrator's volume seems to fluctuate, sometimes it's very soft and other times it's very loud. Anyone else experiencing this? 

Still seeding, share ratio of 6 right now :)"
[V],GoodFilms,2010-05-15T20:29Z,Better quality rip!: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5262949/Life_2009_BBC_BluRay_720p_x264
,.EzDL,2010-05-20T21:56Z,"Thankyou, cant wait to watch!"
,mercury001,2010-06-02T03:22Z,please seed..
,Lucky13s,2010-06-06T10:11Z,OPRAH!?
,Lucky13s,2010-06-06T10:46Z,Wow 1 hour and it still hasnt connected to any seeders
,Lucky13s,2010-06-07T06:46Z,"Wow this is ridiculous, a whole day and it never downloaded a kb.

If I download the episodes individually they download at a reasonable speed, but if I try to get them all in one from this highly seeded source, no a single byte gets downloaded in a whole day...

Is there something wrong with this torret?"
,tarball8,2010-06-13T07:43Z,"This torrent is bogus.  Even though I have max peers = 80, it never goes past 30, even thought there are hundreds supposedly available.   And strangely most of the peers/seeds I get anything from are at shawcable.net.   Hmmmm...."
,Afcan1,2010-06-23T04:17Z,Try to downlaod one episode at the time it's working real good for me
,mynameisjan,2010-08-16T12:45Z,It's David Attenborough narrating very clearly with excellent quality.
,ONeg,2010-08-30T18:41Z,H264 are mp4 container HD. This isn't that. These are regular mkv x264 containers. You're gonna have to remux these if you were looking to watch them on your XBox like I was.
,mcordell,2010-09-27T22:06Z,"What crap seeders, 494 seeders and getting 200 kb/s.

Note: Normally get 1.2 Mb/s on torrents with over 100 seeders

Gonna take 2 days to finish"
,mcordell,2010-09-27T22:09Z,"One question: who is narrating this version of Life?  Think my Mom's crazy, but she actually prefers the Oprah narration.  As you can tell, I'm downloading this for my Mom."
,mcordell,2010-09-28T23:50Z,"Download complete!  It actually finished this last night as my speed jumped to 1.1 MB/s.  Great video quality, great audio quality, and great documentary!

For people wanting to know: This is NOT the Oprah narration version!"
,Scrappychin,2010-10-11T22:24Z,"I've had some problems with this freezing, gave the files to a friend to check if it was my computer but it happened to him too.
 Gonna retry, might have been an error in the download, will comment after. I really want to see this"
,gertfjì±„rt,2010-11-06T13:46Z,comon PLZ seed!! 
,DutchXL,2011-03-19T14:06Z,Awesome! Thanks man! If it's downloaded i will seed a few weeks
,thgttg3234409,2011-08-29T20:05Z,"How did you rip subtitles to txt?
I'm looking an alternative for SubRip."
,drako314,2012-01-16T08:34Z,"A=10

Quality is excellent even on 2080 hi def.
Brilliant!"
,drako314,2012-01-16T08:36Z,Correction above: 1080 hi def
,MoDu_Pirate,2012-07-01T21:37Z,"Excelent torrent. Still seeding, currently at 32 share ratio. Will seed for at least one more month. Enjoy."
