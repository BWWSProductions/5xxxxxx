,Xeokym,2010-02-02T07:11Z,"How can you NOT know how to SEED?! You just leave Bit Torrent (or whatever program you use) open every time your PC is on, and leave the torrent queued. It will seed automatically!

If you save your torrents to a different folder than your music folder, then you must leave a copy of them in the original folder. If they were DL'd in zip format, you can unzip to your music folder & then just leave the original zip in the DL folder. 

I can't imagine how people figure out how to DL torrents, but then they don't know how to seed...if you figured it out enough to download then you should know how the hell to seed! Besides, most bit torrent programs these days begin seeding automatically as soon as the file is 100%. It's practically retard-proof. Practically....
