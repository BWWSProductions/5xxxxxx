1. About
---------------------------------------------

This is full @Home Mate by ILLUSION. Fully installed it will take 3.2 GB of HDD
After install the game is in english (read mod info), fully uncensored and ready to play
With this installer a Illusion Wizzard will be installed with the newest PPExtractor and ready to install mods.
Basic needed mod to play have been already installed and should show up on the Wizzard.

As an extra option, you can also install @Home Mate Special (also known as @Home Mate Photo) and Esk Mate.
I also included couple trainers and other tools.
Make sure you have all of the net frameworks installed. Different parts of the game (mods, trainers, wizzard, launchers) need different .NET Framework to run. I included all the basic .NET frameworks with this DVD.

Make sure you read WiKi FIRST before you start asking any stupid questions like "how do i install this" or "how do i play".

4. Mod info
---------------------------------------------

With the game Illusion Wizzard and some ready to install mods will be installed.
Basic needed mods are already applied to the game and should show up.

Translation is not fully completed but i installed the latest version before creating this installer.
If the newest versions will be out, then you can install them on your own.

If you install the @Home Mate Special, then the current interface is not translated fully. Still it is not that hard to figure it out.

IMPORTANT: The Subtitle Overlay Mod includes no subtitles whatsoever. It was included only because of possible future subtitles and because it has some nice cheat options (like girl tit size). It is highly unlikely that there will ever be translated any dialog for this game. Run the game with subtitles to enable you to cheat.

FINAL NOTE: Before installing any mod, read the mod info FIRST!
