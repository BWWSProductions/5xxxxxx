is kinda good but it need a little more translation, i know is not your fault im just imforming to the rest of people.

about the torrent, like always is perfect, the install wizard is beautiful (amazing work there man!) and it works flawless in win7 x64.
thanks."
,emptorr,2009-12-26T13:43Z,"Hey dude, your games are really awesome. I was wondering, is there any way you could upload the SECOND Bible Black game? Been really looking for that one."
,VulgarWind,2009-12-26T15:46Z,"Thx random for all these [Illusion] games since it has been a hassle for many to install them cuz there are no organised downloads  section and AppLocale sucks xD thx again... Also, could you plz try uploading Yuusha (new illusion game) and Battle Raper 1 ? Also i'm looking forward for Real Girlfriend xD... Thx and keep up the good work...!"

,adsfae,2010-01-09T15:00Z,"About the quality of this game, is it better than school mate? because I didn't really like that game."
,da_300_squirrels,2010-04-15T14:27Z,"it sounds to be a little like ag3 and if it is, im totally in :D
didnt get the schoolmate to work so i dont know bother going deeper into it. another illusion game from randompirate, could it be better ;)"
,da_300_squirrels,2010-04-18T14:11Z,"tnx. runs well, easy install, fast download, no virus and a great game = strongly recomended"
,da_300_squirrels,2010-04-20T19:10Z,"well hmmm this is awkward but.. im having a problem. i tried to apply some mods with the wizzard but then the game wouldnt start, i got up the menu to start game and options etc but no game. so i had to re-install the entire thing which was no problem and now the game works but i cant ""make"" the girls you know outfits etc, i can with the guy but not with the girls. 

how do i do, do i need to re-install again or are there any smart things to do??!?

otherwise, works really great."

,da_300_squirrels,2010-05-14T12:44Z,"@ randompirate ya, after i applyed the mods and it didnt work i reinstalled it, so now its the original but i cant use the make option ingame, so what am i supposed to do... reinstall again or what??!?"

,Niaku,2010-09-13T09:13Z,"When installing, my virus program told me there was a virus. Just double checking, there's no virus, right?"

,penzes,2010-12-16T07:36Z,thx for the splendid upload randompirate. u r the best :D
,salmanwahidi,2011-01-18T19:58Z,1 thing I want to tell guyz! The autorun installs a Trojan. I have K-Pure and it kicked that Trojan out from my PC!
,DiscoPirate,2011-02-11T08:57Z,"This game won't play. It starts up, has a splash screen that is off to the right but then nothing happens, just music. I have ATI Radeon express 1250 windows 7 x64 and 4gb ram. this should run I don't get it? Is this a fake? "
,DiscoPirate,2011-02-11T09:02Z,"I think the problem is in the d3d9.dll as I replaced it with the one in my system folder (it didn't fix it, it actually made it worse) but it changed it so I guess maybe if I had a better d3d9.dll it would run. I'll try the graphics upgrade and try comparability mode again but it didn't work last time. 

if anyone knows how to get this to work aside from installing windowsxp onto a virtual machine let me know"
,DiscoPirate,2011-02-13T05:43Z,"after waiting an entire day for a response and getting no help I've decided thhe uploader is a faggot. Game doesn't work on Windows 7 people don't waste your time, probably don't work at all, just uploaded to troll?"
,Oizumi3,2011-04-29T06:56Z,"@DiscoPirate
You're a fucking moron. Nuff said.

@Randompirate
AWESOME upload pack man! It's a big pain in the ass for me to try and get the game clean and then install all the mods and whatnot, so this is a big help for people like me. Works perfectly too, thanks for the upload!"
,SketchX,2011-05-12T04:07Z,you have the best shit and the most amazing support! if anyone has a problem with you they have a problem with me!
,Achilles295,2011-05-25T01:01Z,"I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate x64 and the game runs perfectly. The install is so easy that a troglodyte could do it and the important mods are already applied.

If you can't get it to run don't blame the uploader. Just READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!

Thanks for this."
,DoomedConman,2011-05-28T02:12Z,Amazing download speeds on all your uploads Pirate. You the man. Cheers :)
,mcbobinite,2011-05-30T09:29Z,"hey man thanks for all the games youve uploaded i have them all, your the best uploader and you make it far easier than anyone on HF. but this is the only game im having problems with. whenever i try to take a girl on a date (i think) it just crashes. all i can do is click on the girl or w/e and then it crashes. im not really sure what the problem is but any help is appreciated and lemme know if its just gonna sadly be one of those games i wont be able to play. though i dont see why, all the others youve uploaded work perfectly fine."
