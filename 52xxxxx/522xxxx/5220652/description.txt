Top Of The Pops (23rd December 1975) [VHSRip (XviD)]

Episode information
--------------------

Presented by Dave Lee Travis and Jimmy Savile

Performances by:
Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel - Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)
Billy Connolly - D.I.V.O.R.C.E.
Status Quo - Down Down
Sweet - Fox on the Run
Rod Stewart - Sailing (Video)
Mud - Oh Boy
David Bowie - Space Oddity (Danced by Pan's People)
Bay City Rollers - Give a Little Love (Video)
Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody (Video)

Don't get too excited at the mention of Noel Edmonds in the opening titles - he was only in the 2nd Christmas episode shown on 25th December, which used the same titles.  Of course, that episode isn't available due to Edmonds being a party-pooper.
Also, it seems that this episode is edited!  The TOTP2 performance database mentions a Pan's People performance of Typically Tropical's 'Barbados' and Hot Chocolate with 'You Sexy Thing', neither of whom appear.  Thanks very much UK Gold.

Top Of The Pops (11th December 1980) [VHS Rip (XviD)]
	

Richard Skinner hosts this episode of Top Of The Pops from December of 1980. The tracklisting is as follows :- (â€˜vâ€™ denotes video)

Adam & The Ants â€“ Antmusic
Showaddywaddy â€“ Blue Moon
Madness â€“ Embarrassment
Status Quo â€“ Lies
Matchbox â€“ Over The Rainbow
Police â€“ De Do Do Do De Da Da Da (v)
Queen â€“ Flash
Stray Cats â€“ Runaway Boys
Abba â€“ Super Trouper (v)
John Lennon â€“ Imagine (live)


Thereâ€™s alot going on in this episode. This weeks obligatory interview segments are with Jermaine Jackson and a rather startled looking Gary Numan who claims heâ€™s giving up music. Thereâ€™s no Legs & Co but there are three 1950s throwback acts which just proves the early 80s wasnâ€™t all post punk and New Romantic at all. Finally, this is the first episode to be transmitted after the death of John Lennon and thereâ€™s a rather nice tribute after the ending titles have finished when the programme comes back and a live performance of â€˜Imagineâ€™ (not the usual video) is played.

This recording is NOT from a UK Gold repeat. It is somebodyâ€™s home recording of the time and I suspect that due to the special Beatles connection this has come a few generations down the line. The quality is ok but it isnâ€™t up to the usual standard, thereâ€™s a slight orange hue (see screenshots) it shouldnâ€™t spoil your enjoyment but do be aware of it.

Top Of The Pops (18th December 1980) [VHS Rip (XviD)]

â€œThe last Christmas Top of the Pops before the Christmas Top of the Pops...â€ says Simon Bates a bit confusedly in the penultimate TOTP of 1980. The Tracklisting looks like this :
(This episode contains all studio performances, no videos)
The Beat â€“ Too Nice To Talk To
St Winifredâ€™s School Choir â€“ Thereâ€™s No One Quite Like Grandma
Barron Knights â€“ Never Mind the Presents
Specials â€“ Do Nothing
Gary Numan â€“ This Wreckage
Robert Palmer â€“ Looking For Clues
Chas & Dave â€“ Rabbit
Nolans â€“ Whoâ€™s Gonna Rock You?
Jona Lewie â€“ Stop The Cavalry
John Lennon â€“ Just Like Starting Over (Legs & Co)

St Winifreds, Barron Knights and an interview with Little and Large? What had we done to deserve this? 
Fortunately the episode redeems itself with an excellent Specials performance (check out the Xmas jumpers!) 
a first play for the now ubiquitous â€˜Stop The Cavalryâ€™ and Robert Palmer in what can only be described as a leather suit (!)

Quality is very good taken from a UK Gold repeat. As with with all UK Gold broadcasts it may be edited from original transmission.

Top Of The Pops Christmas Special (25 December 1980) [VHS Rip (XviD)]..


â€œAll these toys and Leo Sayer too..â€

Possibly my favourite episode of TOTP as Peter Powell and Jimmy Saville basically eat their way through the greatest hits of the year. Which are as follows (â€˜vâ€™ denotes video):-

The Nolans â€“ Iâ€™m In The Mood For Dancing
Dexyâ€™s Midnight Runners â€“ Geno
Blondie â€“ Atomic (v)
Paul McCartney â€“ Coming Up (v)
Barbara Streisand â€“ Woman In Love (Legs & Co)
Liquid Gold â€“ Dance Yourself Dizzy
David Bowie â€“ Ashes To Ashes (v)
Marti Webb â€“ Take That Look Off Your Face
Police â€“ Donâ€™t Stand So Close To Me (v)
Abba â€“ Super Trouper (v)
Lipps Inc.- Funkytown (Legs & Co)
Leo Sayer â€“ More Than I Can Say
Sheena Easton â€“ 9 to 5
Pink Floyd â€“ Another Brick In The Wall (Part 2) (v)
St Winifredâ€™s School Choir â€“ Thereâ€™s No One Quite Like Grandma

Quality is very good taken from a UK Gold Repeat. There is a slight issue with crackly sound for the first minute or two but itâ€™s corrected itself by the end of The Nolans. This is an issue with the original satellite recording and not my encoding. 
As with all Uk Gold repeats, programme may be edited from original transmission.

Top Of The Pops Xmas Special (25th December 1981) [VHS Rip (XviD)]

Presented by â€“ The Radio 1 D.Jâ€™s (specifically Jimmy Saville, Kid Jensen, Tony Blackburn, John Peel, DLT, Adrian Juste, Simon Bates, Andy Peebles,Paul Burnett, Paul Gambaccini, Steve Wright, Peter Powell, Richard Skinner, Tommy Vance, Mike Reid)

An excellent show containing the following tracks (all are studio performances. No videos!)

Teardrop Explodes â€“ Reward
Ultravox â€“ Vienna
Kim Wilde â€“ Kids In America
Human League â€“ Love Action
Godley & Cream â€“ Under Your Thumb
Kirsty McColl â€“ Thereâ€™s A Guy Works Down The Chipshop Swears Heâ€™s Elvis
Dave Stewart w/ Colin Blunstone â€“ What Becomes Of The Broken Hearted?
Jacksons â€“ Can You Feel It? (danced by Zoo)
Linx â€“ Intuition
The Beat â€“ Too Nice To Talk To
Spandau Ballet â€“ I Donâ€™t Need This Pressure On
Toyah â€“ Itâ€™s A Mystery
Laurie Anderson â€“ O Superman (Zoo)
Altered Images â€“ Happy Birthday
Depeche Mode â€“ I Just Canâ€™t Get Enough
OMD â€“ Souvenir
Shakinâ€™ Stevens â€“ You Drive Me Crazy
Radio 1 D.Jâ€™s â€“ All You Need Is Love (!)

Although the tracklisting of this episode speaks for itself, thereâ€™s still some points that need to be mentioned. Firstly it contains John Peelâ€™s return to the show after an apparantly disasterous attempt back in the 60s. Secondly Ultravoxâ€™s performance of â€˜Viennaâ€™ in which Midge Ure appears to be wearing bondage gear (see picture) and finally the truly jaw dropping interpretation of â€˜O Supermanâ€™ by Zoo in which a high court judge dances around pulsating pods. Iâ€™m not making any of this up!

The quality of this episode, although excellent on tape pixellated quite badly when encoded. I re-encoded it at a higher bitrate (hence the slightly bigger file size than normal) and although perfectly watchable, you might find it slightly blockier than normal, for this I can only apologise. On the positive side itâ€™s NOT a Uk Gold repeat which means it wonâ€™t be edited in any way!

Top Of the Pops-Christmas Day 1984 [VHSRip (XVID)]

Description	Another episode of TOTP ripped from a VHS my haording husband has kept all these years.Again the quality is as good as you'd expect from a tape of this vintage.
One other thing on the quality, this was a typical VHS recording so the  beginning and end are slightly abrupt, but none of the actual programme is lost.Also the sound is slightly muffled for about 45 seconds in the middle of the first song, after that it's fine.
All the acts are live in the studio except for Wham/George Michael.this includes virtually all the members of Band Aid. There are no presenters, each act is announced by the preceeding artist.

The artists featured are
Frankie Goes to Hollywood: Two tribes
Howard Jones; what Is love?
Duran duran: The Reflex
Nik Kershaw: I Won't let the Sun Go Down On Me
Culture Club: War Song
Thompson Twins Doctor, Doctor
Jim Diamond: I Should Have Known Better
Wham: Wake Me Up Before You Go
Paul Young: Love Of The Common People
Duran Duran: Wild Boys
George Michael: Careless Whisper
Frankie Goes To Hollywood: The Power Of love
Thompson Twins You
Frankie Goes To Hollywood: Relax
and of course as it was 1984
Band Aid: Do They Know It's Christmas?-see a very tired looking Bob Geldof sheepishly grooving down.
