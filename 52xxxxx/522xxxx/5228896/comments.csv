,Just4Fun49,2009-12-21T22:21Z,i will make patches for it if ill find bugs ....
,loopas,2009-12-22T23:14Z,"download 50%, nice job just4fun, good torrents. but i do have a question. you know the undo bug that people sometimes have when doing lan? is it fixed?"
,ParisNara,2009-12-23T03:11Z,D: plz seed people it says 3 days for download and I have a godlike intarn3tz
,Just4Fun49,2009-12-23T11:29Z,"@ loopas : Yes i know it, its really annoying, but i managed to fix it with SteamUP. Now i have an account-based Unique SteamID and no more undo-bug. Sadly the Stand-alone Rev-Emu seems to not support Steam-IDs...."
,loopas,2009-12-23T21:53Z,"so this has the undo bug, or does this not use rev-emu? how can i go about fixing it if it does use rev-emu. thanks"
,Just4Fun49,2009-12-24T15:45Z,"Install Steam. Crack Steam with SteamEmu by REVOLUTiON. Copy the gcf's to Steam\steamapps.
Login to Steam by SteamEmu. Have Fun."
,blindbox,2009-12-27T05:58Z,"Is the serverbrowser fixed for Setti? If it is, could you tell me how you did it? I have my own Garry's mod etc already, but I just couldn't figure out how to fix the serverbrowser for setti."
,Just4Fun49,2009-12-27T14:43Z,"No, its not fixed but i will if necessary. I do it by downloading going to Setti Masterserver's official site. Download Masterserver. And then install it by the steps shown to you there."

,Norwegian_Smiley,2010-04-23T16:37Z,"OK...
Just4Fun49, You are a genius, and all your torrents are high quality stuff, indeed. ; )

But this is too confusing for my little brain...
Care to explain quite simply what I must do to
run Gmod with this torrent?

Thought I'd try this one now
(I've been using your other torrent earlier).
Please answer! =)"
,Norwegian_Smiley,2010-04-27T21:31Z,"Sorry, I'm a retard!
Didn't see the Utube-link at first...
BUT!
Now I've installed Gmod correctly, following your
instructions 100%, but the game does not detect
any addons or new maps. :S

Help please? :D"
,Rhonon,2010-05-17T04:00Z,"Not sure, but I run Windows 7 and get this error in the MiSteam application:

Microsoft .NET Framework

Unhandled exception has occurred in your application. If you click Continue, the application will ignore this error and attempt to continue. If you click Quit, the application will close immediately.

Unknown field: 7.

I am running Windows 7 and have .NET Framework 4.0."

,mariojuniorjp,2010-06-16T20:53Z,"Guys, who declined to be seed please ... has very little to seed this torrent, speed download this shit"
,Axires,2010-07-19T15:12Z,"Hey, thanks for the great torrent dude, I've used your other ones before but I'm having a problem with the installation of this particular one - the same problem as Rhonon.

I already have NET. framework 2.0 installed, but I'm still getting an unhandled exception within NET. framework.

I'm running windows XP SP2"
,Axires,2010-07-19T16:25Z,"Hey, seeing as MiSteamPrep doesn't work for me, would I be able to use a program like GCFExplorer?"
,Axires,2010-07-19T17:47Z,"GCFExplorer works ^_^

I had to extract each GCF/NCF file individually, but it was done within a 1/2 hour

SO GUYS!! If your getting any errors with MiSteamPrep, just download and install GCFExplorer, and extract each GCF file into a single folder, it all works out properly :D"
,Stalkerdauno,2010-07-22T14:00Z,Man I'm pissed... It just doesn't work for me... MiSteam has a problem with .NET framework although I installed it just now... 2.0 and 4.0. And if I get through that problem another one pops up.. When I set the Cache Folder and it check for caches it comes up with nothing. No items were found :( WTF???!!! :((((

,nutzu2220,2011-05-18T18:17Z,"Got this to work :D
How to install without misteamprep:
Extract Patch
Open the base content folder
extract each GCF file in the Patch folder (overwrite if asked to)
After you are done make a shortcut of hl2.exe
go to proprieties
at the target type:
-steam -garrysmod -appid 4001
And rename the shortcut
Garry's mod 11
EXACTLY LIKE THAT OR IT WONT WORK!"
,Syphera,2011-07-04T16:13Z,"Does someone have a PROPER install guide, because i can't tell shit from al the comments, nothing works."
