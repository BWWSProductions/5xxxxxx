,Psychosis666,2009-12-20T01:48Z,"Thank's Secret ...can Somebody please explain what is the difference between BDRip And BRRip ....i know the basic can u give me the technical...

BD is An XviD encode directly from a source Blu-Ray disk.
BR is An XviD encode from a Blu-Ray release (i.e. a 1080p *.mkv file

Can u explain the Tech part in detail and which one is better  

Thanks"
,T-Fish,2009-12-21T07:08Z,"@Psychosis666..  its rather simple. theres no such thing as a BR.

it was made up by someone and caught on. google the official blu-ray logo and notice that it says ""Blu-ray Disc"" hence BD. just like a DVD is a Digital Video Disc.

now about your question regarding quality. thats also very simple. every re-encode of a video file is like re-compressing a .jpg image. re-compressing/re-encoding an already compressed format will always result in a quality loss, so a re-encoded scene release will never look as good as if it was made from the retail disc itself. 
BUT since quality is subjective, only you can decide whats good enough for you :)"
,Psychosis666,2009-12-28T03:23Z,what r the best rippers available .....i tried rippig my dvd using imTOO the quality was bad when i ripped it in 700 mb....i want the it to be done in axxo quality its good for 700 mb
,T-Fish,2009-12-30T19:15Z,"if axxo quality is good enough for you, then use AutoGK.
its the easiest dvd to avi tool out there."
