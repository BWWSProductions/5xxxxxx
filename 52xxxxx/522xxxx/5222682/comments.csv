For some strange reason on VLC even, there is no audio. This is the first after hundreds if not thousands of films/clips that I cannot access audio. 
It would seem unlikely that this is a codec issue, but can somebody - or the torrent poster acosmic, confirm there is a problem or not? Or offer a solution if they know of one? 
I would be ever so grateful."

I just realized it's in 5.1 but vlc seems only able to accept the side channels - turned vlc to stereo and presto.
So ignore me. "
