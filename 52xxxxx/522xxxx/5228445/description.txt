The Star of Bethlehem was the brightest star anyone has ever seen. It led the Magi on a search for a new Messiah, yet no one else saw it.

Was it a spectacular comet, a blazing supernova, or an astrologically significant alignment of planets?

This film brings together Biblical scholars, renowned astronomers, and world famous scientists to explain the origins of the Christmas Star. Combining astronomy and astrology with religion and philosophy, this scientific investigation is rooted in the Ancient Near East.

Gathering evidence from Bethlehem to Babylon, the catacombs of Rome to the vaults of the British Museum, this is a quest to uncover the celestial truth behind this most famous of stars.

What did the Magi really see 2000 years ago?
