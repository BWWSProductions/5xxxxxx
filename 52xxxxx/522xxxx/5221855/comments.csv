Atheists are just dumb cattle for the slaughter of the Satanists that push Evolution theory.  Most politicians and World figures are Satanists.  They know there is a spiritual nature to life, but their mission is to destroy the Goyim. So take your choice truth or lie.  Death or Salvation.

Wake up fool."

   Says who?  A bunch of ignorant, bigoted crooks? Like Kent Hovind, for instance? Terrific endorsement indeed."
,Tamarind777,2010-01-28T08:29Z,"Attack the man when you can't do any better. Hovind has done so much damage to the religion of evolution. Look how stupid you are: Darwin only had a religion degree and yet you call HIM a scientist. At least Hovind used to teach high school science and he puts evolution to shame, that's why you hate him so much. Maybe you should listen to one of Hovind's presentation and see how intelligent he is. He asks very simple questions of evolution and the very best of you can't answer any of them. For example, let me see your response to this: how do you prove that fossilized bones passed on it's genes? In order for a fossil to be related to anything after it, you have to go on the assumption that it passed on it's genes. This is just common sense, something that evolution lacks big time. The very thing you're trying to prove is what you assume. That, my friend, is a logical fallacy. Evolution is replete with them. The only sense evolution makes is NONsense! You guys who call yourselves atheists don't have a problem with evolution, no matter how foolish and nonscientific it is. What you really have is actually a problem with God and judgment. I am quite sure if there was no judgment associated with God, you all would disband the idiotic religion of evolution in a minute. You love sin too much, that's your problem. No matter, you can try and close your eyes and stop your ears as much as you want, but guess what? There is still an impending judgment and you can't hide!"

Evangelical christianity, he has done more to discredit it than atheists themselves.

""Maybe you should listen to one of Hovind's presentation and see how intelligent he is.""
We have! But hes not very bright :( He makes up for his lack of intelligence with his er canny unsuspecting humour?


""how do you prove that fossilized bones passed on it's genes?""
You can't prove it! Gaaaawud planted the bones there to test our faith! Ooooh Gawud you are being so cheeky and deceptive, but I know the truth you loving being!

""You love sin too much, that's your problem. No matter, you can try and close your eyes and stop your ears as much as you want, but guess what?""
Damn, how did you know?


""There is still an impending judgment and you can't hide!""
Why oh why! Why am I being silly? Why am I wasting my life sinning now and risking eternal torment after, when I can get EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED as long as I kiss Gawud's ass now?

Sir, you have convinced me to believe! I must be brainwashed, I mean BAPTISED immmediately!"

Bullshit. There is no malware, just Kent ""Water stops X-rays"" Hovind's drek... unless you class that as malware!"
,jdlance,2011-05-19T20:14Z,"I find it so interesting how much intense HATRED comes from the ""open minded"" when this topic arises.

Perhaps Hovind is a nut.  Whether or not that's true, you can't explain why there are planets spinning in different directions in solar systems.  Why there are are galaxies spinning in various directions.  You can't explain why there are trees growing straight up through ALL the evolutionary periods of strata.  Nut or not.  Criminal or not, he has some very good points.

Perhaps we could all benefit from using more brain power for thinking Instead of wasting it all on hatred.

Besides, if Al Capone had been the guy who claimed the world was round, you wouldn't be all bent out of shape that he was in jail.

Just for the record, who-ever it was who was writing about the IRS is correct and a person who is honest with themselves and researched the matter would also conclude that the IRS is constitutionally illegal - not that anyone cares that we have a Constitution these days....

Anyway, maybe we all could work on discussing the facts more and throwing hate a little less.

cheers
