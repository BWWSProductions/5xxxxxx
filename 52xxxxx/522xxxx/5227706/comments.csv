When you convert next time, use 4096mb as the limit to make it 3.99gb. Every little bit counts. :)"
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-19T04:44Z,"Lol, ever since I was informed of my oversight, I have been, but I still have a large collection that are 80 megs short. Sorry. Someday I may go back and replace them one at a time, but it's 6 months worth of non stop conversions. "

,GRSHOPR,2009-12-19T09:12Z,"LOL @ zax. It's unfortunate that I didn't engage my brain more before I did the rips.

@sasi: Stop blasting our seeds. And open your eyes. They've already been done."

,marc3000uk,2009-12-19T12:59Z,"Hi guys. Marc30uk here from the PS3TEAM ;) I didnt bother uploading on here as it was a pain in the arse to register for some reason. Anyway, demonoid is more or less back now.
Im in the middle of building a new PC so ill be back to uploading in the new year.
If anyone is interested, Iv started converting these 1080p rips now to a 4.7gb iso instead of a 4gb m2ts file. They can be burned straight to any standard size blank dvd and they play fine on the PS3 and BLU-RAY Players. You can squize a bit more bit rate into them aswell ;)
Well thats it for now. Have a great xmas.

,sasi2287,2009-12-19T13:35Z,"hi marc3000uk ,

4.4gb would be fine instead of 4.7 as typical dvd is 4483 mb

  i have tried this 4.7 with titanic ,transformers.but i face errors all the time

 so i advise to make it 4.4 gb


i willl be witing for harry potter bluray with 4.4

hope u understand"
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-19T18:17Z,What's up taz?
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-20T00:29Z,"Lol, no problem man. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. For uploading, you need to first create a torrent file. I use uTorrent to do that, as it's built right into the software. Try the link below. And what about your PS3?? Do you have playback questions?

Hello marc3000uk,

Glad To Know About Your Forthcoming Plans.
But As You Are A PS3 MEMBER Your Uploads Should Be PS3 Friendly.

But What Is 4.7GB? [4812.8MB]
FAT HDD/Flash Drives Will Not Support This Size.
[Max 4GB Support.]

DVD5 +/-R/RW Too Will Not Support This Size.
[Max 4.37GB=4474.88MB Support.]

So The Only Suitable Way Is DVD9 That Is Not A Good Idea.

I Think You Should Go For 4.37GB Instead Of 4.7GB.

Thanks.

,asdrubol,2009-12-26T04:43Z,"the info doesnt say if its in english or chinese...
read the info
yeah i can guess it says no subtitle but some teams release the original audio(like chinese) without subtitles(like english)..."
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-28T06:18Z,"@taz: Yes, it's 1080p. It's a deceiving measurement of a movies quality, since rarely does a movie have 1,080 horizontal lines of image. The trick to telling if it's 1080 is the width. If there are 1,920 vertical lines, you're set.

@asdrubol: Read the info. If you can't understand that, you've got bigger issues, bud. ;)"
,inb4_SEED,2010-01-03T17:50Z,"Ugh. I'm usually alright with English dubs, but this one totally takes away from the beauty aspect of this movie. 

@GRSHOPR AND IT'S NOT IN THE GOD DAMN INFO!!

Good rip, though :P"

,osriccc,2010-12-06T17:31Z,"Please release AVATAR EXTEDNED in 1080p without hardcoded subs and the great quality of always. Avatar Extended brips out there (both 720, and 1080) are LAME. Bring us that great movie with the perfect quality of always!"
