,PunksAndSkins.com,2009-12-19T23:31Z,"thanks a lot for the tracker list !! All my future torrents will include these trackers

But like you said for now i have uploaded too many torrents at the same time, so i will wait until i get more seeders to upload new torrents!

thanks again for your advices"
,PunksAndSkins.com,2009-12-19T23:32Z,"One more question : i suppose i can't add those trackers in the torrents i have already uploaded here, can I ?"
[V],neon,2009-12-20T00:15Z,yes you can...this is the only way i know how to do it...copy all these trackers i gave you... go to your utorrent or whatever program you use for uploading...double click a torrent and yor tracker list will come up...paste the trackers below the ones you already have...make sure there is a space between each one...you have to do it for every torrent....this should get your albums to people quicker...any problems let me know 
,PunksAndSkins.com,2009-12-20T17:20Z,"Ok cool thanks, that's what i did... I thought i also had to re-upload the torrent on PirateBay or something...

I think we can already see a speed difference with the new trackers

thanks for the useful info!"
[V],neon,2009-12-20T22:38Z,no problem ...glad to help out..good luck on the pirate bay.
