,ErnieMcCracken,2010-03-06T14:19Z,"Impressive fact that Lil Wayne has been involved on the artist  scene since was a young teenager but... 

The results of his effort and imagination is really not very impressive. 

Yet for being a total douche, he looks really cool!!"

But no lil wayne sold out and tried to pawn this shit off on us after delaying like 8 months because he wanted it to be ""perfect"". Congrats, it's perfectly retarded.

,PhilnLisa,2010-06-19T23:56Z,"It's a good album, don't know why everyone is whinging about it, or saying Drop the World is the only good track.... guess it's just the people that usually have Brittany Spears and beiber blarring out there ipod headphones...
It's not as good as it could of been, there are a few tracks that made me feel like he had lost sight of what he stands for, but all in all it's not that bad..

If you appreciate hip hop, you should definitely give this album a try, you won't be too disappointed...

,OblivionExx,2011-03-06T18:33Z,"Well PhilnLisa, I love how you talk about how a couple songs make you think he lost sight, when the fact of the matter is he's a gangster rapper, and this is a punk rock CD. That's the reason people hate on it. Personally, as a huge Lil Wayne fan, I was very disappointed by this CD, although coming from a punk rock point of view, he did a very good job crossing genres. This CD is worth buying, but it's not worth mentioning as one of Lil Wayne's CD, and even Lil Wayne himself was quoted saying ""I was gunna call this CD Tha Carter IV, but I know alot of people are going to hate this CD, so I'll have to think of a different name""

P.S. Where the fuck is da drought is ova 6? I know its from evil empire but its all new weezy songs.."
