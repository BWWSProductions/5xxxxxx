From Wiki:


Nickel Creek was an American acoustic music trio. Although the group's music has roots from bluegrass, the trio describes itself as "progressive acoustic".[1] Nickel Creek consisted of three permanent members: Chris Thile (mandolin), Sara Watkins (fiddle), and her brother Sean Watkins (guitar). The trio has always recorded and toured with a bass player, but no bass player has ever been an official member of the band. Chris's father Scott Thile played bass with the group until 2000, followed by Byron House, and Derek Jones. Mark Schatz has played bass regularly with the group since 2003.[2][3] In interviews, the band has stressed that they are not a bluegrass band, but a band that "incorporates bluegrass into [its] music".[4] Nickel Creek has covered songs by Weezer, Radiohead, Pavement, Coldplay, Elliott Smith, Bob Dylan, The White Stripes, the Jackson Five and Britney Spears.









Nickel Creek 2000


Nickel Creek (2000) is an eponymous album by the acoustic/"newgrass" trio known as Nickel Creek. Although the group had released two albums prior to this, they are not produced anymore and the band's style was redefined before the release of Nickel Creek; therefore this album is widely regarded as their debut album. It was released by Sugar Hill Records, and produced by country star Alison Krauss.
