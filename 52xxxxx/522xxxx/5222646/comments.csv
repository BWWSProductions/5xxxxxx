,wtf6666,2010-01-20T00:12Z,"Thanks a lot. Please seed everyone!

Note to uploader. Would you like to tell me how you came to a conclusion that these are man made? How can they appear over night, in some cases in a few hours? It is absurd that a group of people with boards on their feet could achieve a perfect symmetrical pattern. I do not know who made these things but I can quarentee it was not bunch people drunk after a night out, as the usual explenation seems to be.
I would not call it a ""quick buck"" either. Since it is very time consuming to make a documentary like this and I doubt they have made any real money by selling this.

dont bother to download - this guy clearly thinks he can make the thinking for us by plonking a ""Bullshit Warning"" permanently on the video - what a jerk!!"
,kc0itf,2010-04-24T23:33Z,"At least the uploader reminds us that the Doug and Dave absurdity is bullshit as well as the ""bullshit warning"" isn't taken down during that scene..."
,dubpir8,2011-03-05T22:10Z,"Thats a shame the uploader added his own message. Why not let people have the pure documentary and let them decide for themselves what they think?

Remember that people were burned at the stake for thinking the earth not flat, could you imagine if we thought that the earth was still flat today and someone made a documentary suggesting it was round and someone uploads the documentary with a big message in it saying ""bullshit"" then we all find it to be true? how can you say such things on subjects that aren't widely studied by the mainstream?

,mitcheg,2012-03-30T08:35Z,"When someone screams ""Bullshit"" so strongly, and such an utterly  stupid way, it makes me think that someone really does NOT  want me to look at this material seriously. Which makes me want to consider it even more. I wish I could get a cop of this without the graffiti  "
