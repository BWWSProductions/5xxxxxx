Description:

  There is now a much smoother and faster way to create setup files for easy 
  installation of applications. As a developer, you will no longer be bogged down 
  learning complex installation programs or yet another awkward scripting language. 
  This guarantees hassle-free programming, quicker market delivery and ultimately a 
  faster turnaround with more satisfied users. Smart Install Maker enables the creation 
  of a professional-looking, custom-made setup file in just a few mouse clicks. The 
  simplicity of Smart Install Maker means:


Features:

  * Create smaller setup files with built-in Ã‘ab compression. Smaller size 
    distributives are quicker to download and give users a better installation experience.

  * Control installation and uninstallation â€“ decide the method, time and contents of 
    installation, modification or removal (including registry, .ini and config files).

  * Check system requirements automatically. If the current system does not comply with 
    the minimum requirements, the installer can notify the user of the problem or 
    automatically abort installation.

  * Customize the installation environment and appearance of wizard screens 
    (eg add gradients or images to the window background, add header image, logo image, etc).

  * Customize screens for display during installation (eg license agreements, readme files, etc).

  * Use the OS native language: automatically identify the language of the target 
    operating system and adjust the screen and message language settings accordingly.

  * Execute custom commands, operate with installer variables, verify passwords, 
    customize uninstall, manage uninstall feedback.

  * Ensure a clean uninstall with no leftovers or orphan files, folders, services or 
    registry records.

  * Create silent installations that do not display installation dialogs and messages.

  * Cut development time. Avoid learning new languages or complex software â€“ get hold 
    of the intuitive GUI and enjoy the speedy setup creation process.
