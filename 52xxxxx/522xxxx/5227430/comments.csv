,Kaemos,2010-05-05T08:27Z,"aww fuck you dude virus detected by norton 360 ""Trojan.SpamThru"" go back to hell >=["
[T],thegrimreaper123,2010-05-06T10:15Z,thanks for the positive comment :) and you know what im sick and tired of you kinda people spreading crap about peoples uploads its obvious i dont upload crap and viruses 1 because im trusted and  2 because i wouldnt 3 norton sucks ass so when you find a real anti virus come back to me and show me the false positive then and maybe i will think about showing you the online and offline scan results :) happy !? i am :P
,murrambingi,2010-07-07T15:56Z,"my norton 360 4.0 anti virus won't allow this torrent to be opened, also norton 360 4.0 scanned 4 files and 1 of them was a *trojan thru* virus, where as my malwarebytes anti malware only scanned 1 file and found nothing, when unzipping with winzip it shows 3 files when really there are 4 files, 1 of which is a *trojan thru virus* you might want to consider kicking your source up the arse. not happy :("
,murrambingi,2010-07-07T16:07Z,"yep i just tripple checked, its not the txt infected, it is the program itself, so to fix this you can go to http://www.sminstall.com/order.html and download the program and use the registration keys you get from this torrent, just extract the txt files and deleate the program file, hope this helps.."
