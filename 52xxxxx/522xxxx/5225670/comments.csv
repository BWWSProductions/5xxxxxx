,Mr.noGay,2009-12-18T08:40Z,"@ GRSHOPR & zax808 ... can u guys tell me the names of all the PS3-TEAM members other than bricktophd, akamaru, suavecito195782 ? .. coz i m seeing GRSHOPR for the first time, n guess its his/her first torrent on TPB. 
i m glad to know that the PS3-TEAM is growing stronger.
al d best."
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-18T09:37Z,"I honestly couldn't tell you. If it says PS3-TEAM in the title, you're good, but there are over 100 people on the team, hard to know who is and isn't active or behind the scenes."
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-18T09:38Z,"And GRSHOPR is just my new pen name, as it were. I'm the artist formerly known as Hackurs. Next will be The Nightmare Before Christmas."
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-18T19:11Z,You know it. :D
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-18T19:12Z,"They'll be a bit, I have 16 ahead of those right now."
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-18T19:18Z,And can anyone confirm or deny if Brick has done Nightmare Before Christmas yet?
[T],suavecito195782,2009-12-18T21:57Z,glad to have you on the team grshopr i just had a question what is the source of your movies 
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-19T03:43Z,"Lol, that's what the hex says, zax. My bad. "
,GRSHOPR,2009-12-19T03:45Z,"Thanks taz. I'll upload Hero then, since you asked about it, and found brick's torrent for me. "

,marc3000uk,2009-12-19T12:56Z,"Hi guys. Marc30uk here from the PS3TEAM ;) I didnt bother uploading on here as it was a pain in the arse to register for some reason. Anyway, demonoid is more or less back now.
Im in the middle of building a new PC so ill be back to uploading in the new year.
If anyone is interested, Iv started converting these 1080p rips now to a 4.7gb iso instead of a 4gb m2ts file. They can be burned straight to any standard size blank dvd and they play fine on the PS3 and BLU-RAY Players. You can squize a bit more bit rate into them aswell ;)
Well thats it for now. Have a great xmas.

,parra24,2009-12-20T15:30Z,"Hi PS3-Team. Thanks for all the blu-rays. They are amazing! Any chance of getting ""Angels & Demons"" uploaded sometime? Thanks in advance!"
,skinhead.69,2009-12-23T17:00Z,"Thank you for this film. I've downloaded this completely but I'm not satisfied by the quality. Since I don't know your source this seems nothing more than an upscaled DVD to me. If not, you need to update your coding skills dramatically."
,fordizama,2009-12-24T02:22Z,"ps3 team, could you upload The kingdom.2007 4Gib size please?
Thanks "
