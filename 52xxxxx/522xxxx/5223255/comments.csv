,classy35,2009-12-17T04:58Z,NVidia or ATI?
,imnoobish,2009-12-17T06:11Z,"is this like the mac version, or would i have to get bootcamp or crossover?"
,BoneCrush3r,2009-12-17T16:58Z,i hope it is ATi
,BW31,2009-12-17T17:31Z,If someone with ATI can get it to work just tell us please !
,Jason99KR,2009-12-18T04:45Z,"ok, i tried it on Macbook pro 13"" (geforce 9400M)
It's REALLY slow
just play on Bootcamp"

Let us know please!!!"
,makusr,2009-12-18T18:29Z,"It only works on Nvidia Graphics , tried it on a MB Pro with Nividia 9400M .Also tried it on a 24 iMac with ati graphics but you can hear only the sound"
,ionlyknow,2009-12-19T00:44Z,Damn it! Why isn't there any versions for ATI?

,Phillakied,2009-12-19T17:08Z,"Crap once again it's the dang black screen( I am working this on on iMac with ATI graphics) That was the reason I deleted the other so called working cod 6 for mac like wtf I don't have a shit load of memory to fill this shit with. Here is a note:
THOSES WITH ATI GRAPHICS AND WANT THIS GAME WILL NOT GET IT TO WORK!! WE ALL GET THE BLACK SCREEN! "
,Phillakied,2009-12-20T04:00Z,"WAIT I TAKE IT ALL BACK!! Guys with ATI graphics card it can work for you! this is what I did

1) Download Crossover Games and instal
2) When you are done downloading this torrent open and instal, after that do this
 GO in the folder with Cod MW 2 and then goto Show Package content then go into content/resources/transgaming/c_drive/programme/activison/modern warfare 2/
3) When you do this you will see an icon that looks like crossover they are actually the game but before you click on one of thme there are actually 2 of them the first on is multiplayer and the other is the campaign.
4) So what ever one you click on crossover will open up don't freak out if it does not load up fast it takes a while and when it is done you should see something white come up then a screen will ask you some shit i don't care after that it will work! 

I don't know about people with Nyidia graphics but it worked for me and i have ATI. see ya guys happy gaming. (^_^)"
,isab21,2009-12-21T12:37Z,multiplayer doesnt work :s
,PornFlakes13,2009-12-23T22:47Z,Is their anyway you can get Multiplayer to work with this version ? The Windows version can play with cracked steam account or smth..  Answer is appreciated !! :D
,_Leon_,2009-12-24T02:37Z,I have iMac with an ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro The game starts but the graphics are completely altered. Surely the card is not compatible. Unplayable. What idea? Any solution?
,21bower,2009-12-24T14:38Z,"OK, HERE IT IS,, if somone could help me along,, 
1. If COD modern warfare isn't in applications already move it there

2. get steam FOR MAC not the windows version that runs through crossover

http://snow-leopard.ning.com/page/steam-for-mac (havnt tried this one but it should be the same)  

3, Download http://www.qurlyq.com/7j3 (u have to fill out survays but just write random stuff)

4, UNRAR all of the files and replace the files in applications-->Modern WarFare 2.app (rightclick show package contents) /Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Programme/Activision/Modern Warfare 2 

5, Then go to applications/modernwarfare2/contents/info.plist (open in text edit) then about 3/4 of the way down change 
c:\Programme\Activision\Modern Warfare 2\iw4sp.exe
to
c:\Programme\Activision\Modern Warfare 2\iw4mp.exe

change the iw4sp.exe to iw4mp.exe then save

6, Finaly go into your mac version of steam and login to your account, then go to file --> settings --> friends and change your nickname to somthing with a space in it, i was sanjeb and now i am sanjeb 123, so yer,

7, NOW this is very important, go to MY GAMES tab on steam and click on add-non steam game, then click browse, then at the top pull down menu click z:\ then navagate to applications then to your cod modern warfare 2 folder 
applications-->Modern WarFare 2.app/Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Programme/Activision/Modern Warfare 2/IW4MP.EXE and then add it to the games list, then just open it from in steam and it should be running,, 

There is only one problem this only allows you to play online for a couple of minute because you get kick but i am working on a fix for this,,, MERRY CHRISTMASS (OR FESTIVE CELEBRATION OF YOUR RELIGION :) ) PEACE OUT Y'ALL"

This torrent is not a mac game it is a windows game manually ported to mac, because of this.
1. It won't work on majority of macs
2. If it does work it might randomly stop working
3. Multiplayer won't work (as far a I am concerned there is no cracked servers out yet for cod mw2
*** What you need to do after downloading this torrent...
open it, if it doesn't work force quit, then open again, keep on doing this if it doesn't work it won't work on your mac, also click on the apple sign in the top left corner and hold ""option"" key and click system profiler then click on the hardware tab and check if you Mac has a NVidida graphics card if it doesn't it will not work on your mac!!!
More than 50% of macs can't run manually ported windows games so don't keep your hopes up that this torrent will work."

(I have an iMac 2.66 GHz Intel Core2Duo, Ram 4Gb, ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro, Snow Leopard 10.6.2)

1) Modern Warfare 2 works well with Parallels 5 at a lower resolution than 1024x768 (depending on the characteristics of the Mac). You can play well, the movements are fluid.

2) With VMware Fusion 3 is impossible to play with problems in video card."

For those with ATI download Crossover games. When it is done downloading (With this torrent you should have Cod 6 folder when done downloading) 
Go in the folder, instead of just double clicking the app just right click and go into ""Show package content"" 
Content/Resources/Transgaming/c_drive/Programme/Activison/Modern warfare 2

From there you should see two things one says ""iw4sp.exe"" or ""iw4mp.exe"" click on iw4sp, crossover should show up and install it into a bottle. then you should either see a blank box or one with mw 2 either way it should work. enjoy playing everyone. Questions?  "

first is unzipped and dragged in applications. it appears on my dock and then disappears. then i went in the contents, used crossover, and opened the .exe file itself. i got the black screen shit except i AM NOT HEARING ANY AUDIO AT ALL which lead me to believe that it just wasn't working at all. and please, dont say to leave it there because i did, for a long time, and it still wasn't working

       - You need to create an account, but they have many more gameports!
2. Download V1.1(!!) wrapper (The last link)

3. Once Downloaded this torrent, open the .dmg
4. Right click on the file, choose 'Show Package Contents'
5. Navigate to the following --> contents --> recources --> transgaming --> c_drive --> program files
6. Drag the Activision folder to your desktop (or anywhere you can easily find it)

7. Navigate to program files in the downloaded wrapper, just like you did in step 5
8. Drag the Activision Folder in program files 
9. You are done! Don't forget to turn of your internet, otherwise you'll get ALTERIWERT error!!"

,Cacklemus,2011-08-14T08:09Z,"Works perfectly with my mac 10.4.6.  Here are some tips-

-Turn off your internet.  Otherwise it won't work.
-Close other applications to stop lagging.
-Go to options and turn ALL settings to low or off.  You may think this lowers quality but it doesn't.
-Press spacebar during infinity ward logo.

Multiplayer does not work.  there is no current fix, however campaign and special ops work with no lag.  

the download takes a few hours.  deal with it.

To stop the shaking, you turn anti-aliasing off (most of you know this). On default settings, after you do this an try to aim down sights, your screen will act weirdly and go white. This can be solved by turning depth of field. I recently figured this out and hope this helps.
