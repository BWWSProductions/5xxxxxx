,TheFreezerBox,2009-12-25T04:51Z,"You'll right-click send-to SetupS for two archive folders: 1. ChocolateDoom (if you have not already done this that is...) and 2. This file (Final Doom or which ever ppGame Doom you want). This only ""installs"" the ppGames and creates shortcuts in your Start-Menu -- look for the shortcuts under something like ""id Software""."
