Synopis: The story of how a maid called Raquel, who has worked for over 20 years in one affluent Chilean household, rediscovers herself. La Nana is an intelligent microcosm of Latin social hierarchy while also focusing on one woman's journey to free herself from a mental servitude of her own making. (IMDB)
