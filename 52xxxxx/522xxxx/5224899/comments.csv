,Fleskhjerta,2010-01-04T16:43Z,"2.6/5

Good on quality and preformance,
Sound and music quality is broken.
The Music sounds just like a gunshot bang. 

Not recommended."
,TombRaiderAddict,2010-01-18T18:25Z,"I ran the game on my Windows XP service pack 3 and the game, sound and controls worked perfectly

not sure what OS you have Fleskjerka but, tested, the sound works fine."
,TombRaiderAddict,2010-01-18T18:26Z,"lol u say not reccomended, when this is liek the only torrent of this with seeds "

,GARitter,2011-05-07T04:55Z,downloaded quickly but the sound is choppy and I also have Windows XP service pack 3 that can run Crysis.
,biancalabraque,2011-05-25T09:43Z,I downloaded this successfully but it says: Cannot find win.dll something like that try installing again? :/ Oh boy i'll just try to reinstall it. :} 
,bocmaxima,2011-07-30T20:23Z,"Do you mean to say it's the ""full game"" minus the cutscenes and music? I am going to try and find the actual full version."
,TombRaiderAddict,2011-09-19T23:27Z,"The music and cutscenes are included.

Compatibility issues may skip them on your computer, but if you explore the folders and files of the game you'll find the oggs, wavs and cutscenes ect in there, if you really want them.

Stop complaining. This is a perfectly legit torrent."
,TombRaiderAddict,2011-09-19T23:29Z,"Google any missing .dll it says are missing, download it standalone and put it in the folder. Not hard. I can't include every individual file you'll need to run it on your machine, but usually if you have the right directx runtimes and frameworks and other suck packages installed there will be no missing files. But as I said there's websites you can get any missing individual files from, it's not an error with the torrent its your PC, so don't blame me, and don't be stupid its not hard to fix."
,GothaXDark,2011-12-26T07:18Z,"Sound did weird with me as well.
As if a gun fires about every second. A crappy 80's game gun.  That's probably my computer. What worried me more was the trojan horse my computer found in these files."
,thetoodd,2012-06-11T10:31Z,The sound doesn't work and that's not from my computer... The rest of the game works well.
