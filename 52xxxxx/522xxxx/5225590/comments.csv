,anuskasvo,2009-12-18T15:04Z,Be thankful someone is uploading this stuff instead of complaining like some fuckwit.
,EmpAtahualpa,2009-12-18T19:47Z,"This is indeed in the wrong category. It should be in ""Movies"", not in ""Highres - Movies""."

,hummarstra,2010-01-07T07:27Z,"Thanks for uploading. But, I have to say Artie's stand up act is mediocre. Barely funny. I turned it off after 30 mins and deleted it. "

As good as if not even better than It's the Whiskey Talkin'"
