Artie Lange - Jack and Coke DVD
==========================
As raw and offensive as ever, Artie Lange returns to his roots in JACK AND COKE, shot at one of his favorite clubs in his beloved New York City. One of America's funniest stand-up comedians, Lange's irreverent, uncensored humor gets huge laughs from this NYC crowd. The culmination of nearly four years of touring, JACK AND COKE includes nearly an hour and a half of insanely honest, hilarious material. Hope you like it.
