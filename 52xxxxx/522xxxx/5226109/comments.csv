,Zero2ninE,2009-12-18T12:50Z,"Sound slides quite a bit out of sync, as the episode progress (goes for both this and the other S07E22 Delta9 version available). Maybe it's on my end something's wrong. In any case thank you for uploading it :D"
,-yeti-,2009-12-18T15:06Z,Its about time.  Why did this popular show take 24+ hrs to come out?  Everybody out Xmas shopping?
,downloads,2009-12-18T16:52Z,"Yeah, sound is a bit out od sync and video is distorted in several places but it's watchable- not a collectible though.
Thanks anyway, there's nothing better at the moment."
,bullolle57,2009-12-18T17:38Z,"How the hell do you get the sound ""out of sync""!?
That seems like there's something wrong with Divx or xvid files! maybe it's time for something new!"
,vonderstock,2009-12-18T22:23Z,"Every minute the video freezes and the sound is muted for 5 seconds. There are also image distortions all the time. This shit is not watchable, please upload something that we can bear to watch. Why even put this one up here?"
,yytrxr,2009-12-19T01:37Z,"i agree with vonderstock why would you bother to upload something that's slightly flawed if no other copy is available?!

I'm just kidding thanks for the upload.  It's really not that bad.  There's one skip in the beginning of the episode, which is likely a broadcast error.  The audio, however, does go a bit out of sync about half way through.  It's not even close to ""not watchable"" though.

We should all do vonderstock a favor though and only upload torrents that he approves of."
,ptv83,2009-12-19T05:53Z,"hey vonderstock.. i guess everyone should stop uploading cams and telesyncs too , eh?   since they're mostly unwatchable too??

lol.. but why?  people are pretty tolerable as to what they want to watch... and besides, it's a free world and i didn't see you upload a better copy so there is no alternative either :)

cheers, eh!  thanks from cunuckistan :)"
,illegs,2009-12-19T06:42Z,"thanks for uploading one of my favorite shows. Peace to you AiTB!!!

Happy Festivus to all  ;]"
,illegs,2009-12-19T08:25Z,"btw,,, im watching it now and it is PLAYING PERFECTLY!"
,illegs,2009-12-19T09:05Z,"ooooops,,,,around the 26min mark the audio becomes premature slightly. Still very watchable."
,vonderstock,2009-12-19T11:20Z,"->ptv83, Yes, they should stop uploading cams and telesyncs. You have to be a fucking retard to watch that crappy quality.  

->yytrxr, That's a great idea. Next time you limpdicks want to upload something, send it to me first so I can approve it. ;)

I'm not watching this episode until there's a better  version to download. I actually care about what they are saying and what is happening in the show, unlike you who only download because it's free.  "
,ravhin21,2009-12-19T14:56Z,"the audio becomes out of sync in about 2/3 of the video.

but still watchable."
,diyadokeon,2009-12-19T18:09Z,">>I'm not watching this episode until there's a better version to download.

In that case, vonderstock, you might not be able to watch this episode at all. It's quite unusual for an episode to be effectively skipped like that but it happens occasionally.

As far as I'm concerned, I'll probably wait till tuesday or so and grab this one if nothing becomes available by that time."

Well, there's already a 720p version out, which is in sync. Someone just needs to put it on TPB."
,Doktor_Schmerz,2009-12-19T20:20Z,"guys dont shit your pants because something is slightly out of sync.. in media player classic for example you can easily set an audio shift time.
takes only a moment and you're back in sync"
,diyadokeon,2009-12-19T20:50Z,">> Well, there's already a 720p version out, which is in sync. Someone just needs to put it on TPB.

I'd say someone needs to put it out SOMEWHERE.
I do regular searches on several indexers and a couple of private trackers (including one where 720p versions usually appear reasonably early). So far, no results."
,abhijit_net,2009-12-19T22:44Z,"I hope some one uploads a in-sync version soon.
I could not find it."
,creamypuff,2009-12-20T02:25Z,"I got mine from HDBits. 

MythBusters.S07E22.720p.HDTV.DD5.1.x264-Funner"
,irmelikoira,2009-12-20T09:23Z,"You fucking shits. How dare you send these comments, when somebody tries to entertain those who are interested in the show, not their own equipment...!!!?

This will come as a better version someday, so all you fuckers who read these comments, dont download this if you are here to write comments, and not watching the shows.

I also pay for DiscoveryChannel because I think it's fair play. I just can't wait, that's because I download from here.

Got to get your names up so my equipment won't send you nothing, no bluerays no HDTVs, you idiots.

Thanks AiTB for a good try!"
,Zero2ninE,2009-12-20T10:57Z,"Maybe this is why we had to wait so long, with all the moaning going on, I wouldn't want to release it here, with that attitude. I'm very grateful for all the MB-pushers out there that supply us fans (with very little patience).

So it's out of sync by ~1/3 of a second near the end, but that does not mean it's ""unwatchable"". I cannot believe how some of you people (mis)treat people who spend time, putting this stuff up for you to download. Pay some friggin' respect!"
,hentooth,2009-12-20T17:54Z,"AITB, Thanks very much for the upload, a brilliant episode, I enjoyed it very much, thank you.

To the moaners, yes the sound gets out of sync, not enough to be a problem, but both sound and video quality are superb.

Just remember you gt this free and AITB took time out to prepare it for upload"
