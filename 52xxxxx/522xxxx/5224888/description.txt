This is the UNCUT/Unseen/Unreleased version of the insane 1998 avant-garde, satanic mind control freakshow film from John Brodie and Ron Atkins. Also known by the title: Dark Night of the Soul. A skeleton faced ghoul smokes black opium and gets wild with sex and drug crazed zombies. Some college kids wander into his cemetery and get brainwashed and forced to smoke opium and engage in bizarre mind control rites. This runs 15 minutes longer, is crazier and has a different beginning, ending and score than the DVD release of Dark Night of the Soul. Used at college drug parties to freak out noobs due to its trippy dialog and imagery. In my opinion this is a better version of this wacky film then the DVD release and the electronic soundtrack pumps.
