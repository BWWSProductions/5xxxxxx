,Dankman007,2009-12-19T09:02Z,I used on a HP Laptop and It bricked my OS. There wasnt much I could have done wrong so I dunno just beware with using this
[V],kentucky-kid,2009-12-19T09:21Z,"it should be working just fine, it works on my HP lappy =)"
[V],kentucky-kid,2009-12-20T10:38Z,yes it will.
,CheesusTehLord,2009-12-21T21:51Z,"Thanks, worked like a charm. I should mention it requires a restart before it'll fully activate.
I had actually bought Windows 7, and I installed it only to learn ""my product key is not valid for installation"". Thanks a lot, Microsoft. Lesson learned: pirate everything."
,TechWizard86,2009-12-22T01:14Z,"As with Dankman I had issues activating Windows 7 ultimate. It boots up to a screen saying ""Invalid boot.ini file Booting from C:\Windows"" then goes to a black screen and the startup sequence comes to a halt. "
,vragec111,2009-12-22T12:18Z,"doesn't work on x64 ultimate,
it says no windows boot drive.. "
,ghstrdr,2009-12-22T13:24Z,"I'm sorry to say that I had the same problem with the 64 bit ultimate : doesn't work on x64 ultimate,
