Hey folks! Â Dev here...here's three tracks for ya. I think they're cool, but theyre just 'bonus' stuff for Ki...take em, love em, hate em, burn a disk and enjoy...(or not)

Track 1) SYNCHRONICITY FREAKS: This is the first song I wrote for Ki, didn't end up quite right though...I like it and it's cool to hear (I think) It's unmastered.

Track 2) KI JAM: This is Me, Jean and Duris kind of jamming in between takes while we were recording the album...yup. It's unmastered too.

Â 
Track 3) TESTING SOME FENDER TOYS: This was a sunny afternoon and I'm just messing around with clean sounds and different pickups. It was a Fender 57 Twin reissue with some Mullards, My EJ strat, and a Keeley compressor. Echos were after the fact. Aaaand, unmastered. Get yer wank on.

Â 
Theres lots more stuff I'll put up here in the next month or so. Music is life, thanks for letting me continue to do it!

Devin.

Enjoy!

PS. It's not flac, but still lossless (wav), so flac seemed like the best category to place it in.
