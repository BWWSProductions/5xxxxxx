Korn - Korn [1994]
	
Wikipedia - Korn (promoted with a ya as KoÐ¯n) is the self-titled debut album by American nu metal band Korn, released on October 11, 1994 through Immortal/Epic Records. It has been certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA in the US.
The album merges influences from alternative metal, funk metal, grunge and hip-hop, which altogether made a sound which would later be called nu metal. It is regarded as the first album of this genre. The band has been said to "disdain the metal or nu metal label," and consider the album more like a "heavy groove".
While these elements have been adapted by other bands, the album includes elements that are unique to Korn, including scatting vocals, and the use of bagpipes.
According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Korn borrows elements from such acts as Pantera, Jane's Addiction, Rage Against the Machine, Helmet, Faith No More, Anthrax, Cypress Hill and N.W.A. According to author Cheryl Lynette Keyes, Korn's sound originated from the acid rap style of Esham. Since its release in 1994, the album has proven to be a seller over time, being certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA in the US. "Shoots and Ladders" was nominated for a 1997 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.
Q magazine (8/00, p.127) - Included in Q's "Best Metal Albums of All Time" - "[Their] clinical power generated maximum moshpit activity, while singer Jonathan Davis' lyrics spoke directly to any teen who'd ever been misunderstood, bullied or abused."
Amazon.co.uk Review  By Jon Wiederhorn - Combining the stop-start rhythms of Helmet, the hip-hop assault of Rage Against the Machine and the brooding vocals of Faith No More, Bakersfield, California band Korn concocted a golden formula that would reanimate the dormant corpse of heavy metal. The band's self-titled debut is a teenage-fantasy-endorphin-rush--a subversive noisefest as angry and hostile as Slayer but with a propulsive groove perfect for skateboarding, vandalism, or jumping up and down until you're nauseous. Songs like "Blind", "Clown", and "Shoots and Ladders" blend dark, bleak riffs with head-spinning guitar effects and scream-and-response choruses. But even at their most vitriolic, Korn imbue their blustery music with a cathartic element of fun.
