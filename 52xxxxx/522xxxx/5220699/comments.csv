,The-Blob,2010-04-16T00:39Z,"Maybe I misread something, but when I play the movie, there is a narrator telling everything that is happening! It is SO annoying to have to listen to some voice that isn't part of the movie. Also, there is no DVD menu. The DVD quality itself is excellent, but that stupid voice playing through the whole movie makes it awful."
