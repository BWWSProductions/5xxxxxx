A Summer Night in Munich captures Oscar Peterson and his "NATO quartet" in a triumphant concert performance recorded July 22, 1998, at the Munchen Philharmonika.  With a program of seven Peterson originals plus the Ellington-Strayhorn standard, "Satin Doll," this group cooks.  "Backyard Blues" and "Nigerian Marketplace" are especially exciting and contemporary-sounding originals, while "When Summer Comes," "Evening Song" and "Love Ballade" are beautiful ballads.  Bassist Niels-Henning Oersted Pedersen lays down the nimble-fingered lines for which he is known, while guitarist Ulf Wakenius is a most complementary figure in dialogue with the leader.  Drummer Martin Drew keeps the proceedings on track rhythmically, taking a tasty solo turn on the set closer, "Sushi." With this fine recording, Peterson shows that even in his seventies, he's still got the goods. ~ Jim Newsom, AMG
