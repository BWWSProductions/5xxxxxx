What a fabulous present! 

I would not have dared to dream that anyone here remembered the existence of this jewel in the ancient of days TV crown!"

I am currently putting season 1 together but it will depend on everyone in TPB community to help me decided if this TV series torrent will survive on its own or not. As much as I would like to I will not be able to seed this forever, so let me see and hear some positive feedback.      "

I wonder, since people today are so accustomed to a ""season"" being 12 episodes or so, if you might consider just doing the 1st 10-12 of Season 1?

That might pump up the action a little bit, especially for people with slower connections and those discovering the show for the first time.

It would also mean less of an investment of your own time and effort, at least until you can see how strong the interest is in the show.

I predict tha just a few episodes of Season 1 will have people clamoring - and seeding - for more!

Thanks again for this remarkable chunk of Television History!"
