Lashed - Mixed By Lisa Lashes - Lisa Lashes [2005]

One of the leading DJs in the Hard House dance scene (she was known as the Queen of Hard House), Lisa Lashes was also one of the world's top party spinners and club names during from the mid nineties through the later parts of the 2000's. Born Lisa Dawn Rose-Wyatt in Holbrooks, Coventry, England, Lashes played her first event in 1996. During the event Lashes was a hit, and won her first residency. From there on out, Lashes made appearances at most (if not all) of England's top clubs, including Gatecrasher, UK: Base, and Temple Theater. Her skills at handling the large club crowds translated well to the festival circuit, and Lashes was a headliner at such events as Global Gathering, Homelands, Creamfields UK, and Knebworth.
