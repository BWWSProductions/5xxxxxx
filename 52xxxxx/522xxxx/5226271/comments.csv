,phutyphan,2009-12-19T08:41Z,I'll keep the rugby coming as long as you fans keep the rugby seeding.  Thank you all for your fantastic work so far!
,deladio,2009-12-23T16:42Z,thank you so very bloody much. i watched the game here in Korea but was so drunk that i can't actually remember much about it other than the fog.  And of course can't get the game on the internet for love nor money. Is the IRB deliberately trying to keep rugby a minority sport?
