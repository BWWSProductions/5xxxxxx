
Max Stevens (Steven Seagal) is the best kind of thief, a modern-day Robin Hood who steals from the rich and gives to those in need. His talents, however, are peerless, and he will do whatever it takes to get the job done, regardless of the ruthlessness involved. Convinced by his lover that itâ€™s time to go straight, Max agrees to one last heist, which, of course, does not go as planned. Set up and framed for a much bigger crime than the one he signed on for, Max finds himself in a high-security prison where he must prove his mettle among the inmates. He forms an unlikely friendship with Ice Cool (Anthony â€œTreachâ€ Criss), and together they orchestrate a massive jailbreak, setting out to extract revenge from whoever set Max up. Much witty banter, explosions, and general mayhem follow, in an action film that delivers all the crucial elements.
