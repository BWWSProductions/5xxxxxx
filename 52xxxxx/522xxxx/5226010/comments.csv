,watbol,2010-02-13T08:16Z,"I never understood the concept of RAR in a torrent???
They are not being EMAILED where you would NEED files < 14Megs, ya know???
Torrents DO continue if logged off and back on, ya know???

Now I have to waste diskspace to get this, waste more to open it, just to watch it???
Wouldn't it be better for all if they just sent the AVI in the frst place???
Just a thought, nothing more... nothing less.
