Eva Peron was the wife of Argentinian President Juan Peron. She was exceedingly beautiful, so beautiful that when at the young age of 33, she died from Uterine cancer, her husband had her body embalmed. Sadly soon after his government was overthrown, and he had to leave country with the embalmed corpse of her beloved wife Eva behind. What happened to her corpse after that is not only unbelievable, but unimaginable. There are charges that her corpse was even attacked - perhaps sexually - by enemies.

This short film - which first appeared in A&E Biography - chronicles the life of the mysterious woman Eva Peron. At the end, there is a cameo showing her corpse in various poses.
