But once I see some seeders, I expect that you will help seed and not just take the info and remove it. Please help me and others to spread this information. Also please see my latest post ""Rima Laibow - Codex Alimentarius Complete."" I forgot about this one and it was left out of this release, so please be sure to download it to at one of my pages:

Then I can seed the individual discs, and other torrents I have running.  I need all the help I can get with seeding, for all of my torrents are stemmed from me directly and I seed as much as possible in hopes that others will help once they have finished.  Thanks.
