Uploader Comments
-One special feature; an audiocommentary by director Richard C. Sarafian
-Also, this is the original cut. The UK version includes an interesting 
but useless scene with Charlotte Rampling (that has quality loss and 
suffers from bad dubbing.)
-They made a horrendous remake in 1997 of this film. Avoid watching that one.


thanks goes to Keyser
