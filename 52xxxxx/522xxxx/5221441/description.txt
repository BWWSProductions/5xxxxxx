GHV2 (an abbreviation of Greatest Hits Volume 2) is the second greatest hits compilation album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on November 12, 2001 by Maverick Records. It is the follow-up to the 1990 release, The Immaculate Collection. It does not contain any new recordings and was released to coincide with the live video release, Drowned World Tour 2001. The RIAA certified it Gold and Platinum on Dec 12, 2001, denoting one million shipments in the United States. Worldwide, the album has sold more than seven million units. It was the 12th best selling album of 2001. A promotional only remix album, GHV2 Remixed: The Best of 1991â€”2001, was released to accompany it.

In November 2001, Maverick released a promotional megamix to promote the album. It was never released commercially.

The "Thunderpuss GHV2 Megamix" was the most common version used by radio stations and the version used in the music video. The songs featured (in chronological order) were: "Don't Tell Me", "Erotica", "Secret", "Frozen", "What It Feels Like for a Girl", "Take a Bow", "Deeper and Deeper", "Music" and "Ray of Light" Other remixes were produced by Johnny Rocks & Mac Quayle and Tracy Young.

The remix went to #5 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 2001 and charted under the title "Madonna Megamix". The original Thunderpuss version has some spoken words at the beginning of "Deeper and Deeper": this was a recorded message used on the early Internet to promote the album Bedtime Stories. The "Thunderpuss GHV2 Megamix" video is compiled of images of live performances and 23 Madonna videos. It was directed by Dago Gonzalez of Veneno Inc.
