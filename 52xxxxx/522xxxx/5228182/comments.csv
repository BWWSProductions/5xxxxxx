,BLADE121,2010-02-08T20:18Z,"hi guys,
i need help : game crashes for me:(

i downloaded ""Left.4.Dead.2.FullRIP.NoSteam.[v2.0.0.3]-DarkSniper87""....then extracted it.

I then downloaded this mega patch [2001-2007] and replaced all the files into the game directory.

Then i  ran ""l4d2regkey.reg"" file and added it to windows registry. 

i followed this mega patch steps to launch the game...i first ran ""IniGen.exe""(entered a name and didnt close it)..then i ran ""left4dead2.exe""...wen i started the ""single player"", game loaded to 100% then crashed without any error.....:(

i closed that ""inigen.exe"" ran the ""Start Left 4 Dead 2.bat""...this time game loaded to 100% and then freezed on the loading screen.....had to restart my pc...

does anyone know how to fix this....please help..!

i installed MSvisual c++ 2005,2008 and i also have Dot Net 3.5 installed...

please help me out.....
"
,BLADE121,2010-02-08T20:31Z,"EDIT: I figured it out :)

i just needed to press ""ENTER"" button after entering the name name into ""Inigen.exe""

IT WORKS NOW...THANKS for such wonderful working rip and patch...

BTW can i enter ANY name into ""inigen"" or i should enter only the ingame character's name ?"
