,superswiffty,2009-12-19T13:31Z,lp531 - you sound spot on. I really don't understand why the uploader doesn't provide screenshots?! What the hell is the point of the upload if you're not showing us what we're downloading!

,superswiffty,2009-12-20T05:37Z,"BipolarMonkey - it seems your condition has got the better of you in this case scenario, so I'll go easy on you - anywho your blunt explanation doesn't answer my question - yeah it's the real deal - big whoop! But why aren't we shown the quality of the film via screenshot? If you can't answer that go away."
