,ZenRhino,2010-04-16T05:23Z,"@paragon9 I don't see you uploading anything, so quit yer bitchin' ok? Besides, for people who know anything an .mkv video isn't anything to worry about & usually is awesome in quality.

Thanks MKVGuy for this release... I just saw the commercial on tv for this & it looks funny!!"
