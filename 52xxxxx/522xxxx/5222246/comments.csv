[V],twentyforty,2009-12-16T18:38Z,"@htctouch: Don't worry, however I cannot see you in swarm. Better wait a little, it is usually a sign that swarm is full of.
@sanyam: I don't use so called ""ripper"" program. I use programs modified, written and compiled by myself. But - your friend needs to re-compress XviDs (350MB) and for H264 I use 720p as input. But, I keep my collections as XviD 330 MB per episode what gives 13 episodes per DVD-R. On one DVD-R can be burned up to 24 episodes, but they need to be really small - and I have not be satisfied with quality if XviD episode is smaller than 182 MB (XviD to XviD).
So, there is no simple answers - but - if you want I can send you (or your friend) archive (.rar) with my ""way"" of doing XviD re-compression - if I get his/your public e-mail address (open one just for this purpose for free, somewhere) but one which accepts attachments to messages."
,htctouch,2009-12-16T19:36Z,"sory sir dint got ur point ??

swarm means group or a bunch ?? what group u talking abt bro ??"
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-16T20:50Z,"@htctouch: Don't get me wrong, but you should learn at least few basic terms, swarm is one of them. ""Swarm"" is where ""peers"" are.

@sanyam: Yes, it is. But RAM is cheap today and if you can, get up to 2 GB (but its not needed if you stop doing something else parallel to encoding). BTW, 2 minutes ago I send you my toolset."
