,Rod321,2010-01-23T04:49Z,"Fast Download 
Converted & burnt with ""ConvertX to Dvd 4"".
Visuals 8/10 (Obviously due to small download file size), Audio 9/10, Sync is good.
Subtitles won't turn off but are not too intrusive. Grandkids might use it for reading practice.
Thanks to:
mrsjs, Seeders & Peers"
