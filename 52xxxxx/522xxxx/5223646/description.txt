This is the non setup, portable version of simple port forwarding.

The program requires some extra files to be installed, I have included these files, simply just run the

_Install_Files_Needed_For_SPF_32bit_System.bat
or
_Install_Files_Needed_For_SPF_64bit_System.bat

and it will only copy the files it needs in order to run.

once those files are on the system you can run simple port forwarding from anywhere.
