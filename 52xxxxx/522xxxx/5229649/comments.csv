This user is a spammer/faker. Using your site as a classified advertisement channel. All his torrents are advertisement only but masked as something else. I guess using your site for advertisement is not free, but I am sure he gets some money for this. He is using zip archives with video file type file extension to hide his advertisement, or so-called rename to zip trick. Almost all the torrent from this user has rename to zip instructions either in a jpg ?screens? file or in preview avi files.
Also NO I AM NOT working for the porn industry. Like you are. I guess you get paid for every click on the preview link. And no I am also not working for the church. I wonder what is next on your list. Why are you doing this over and over again? Why do think people will buy your porn. Then they can get all for free here. You are a compleate moron"
