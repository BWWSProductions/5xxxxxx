,4rost,2009-12-17T22:25Z,Can someone tell me if this is in sync this time?
,4rost,2009-12-18T00:07Z,ok I just finished the download and I am not going to continue to seed this because it does not work for me when I try to play the file on windows media player that has the latest K-Lite codec pack installed windows xp service pack 2 all i see and hear is my visulizations from the media player come up and there is just a high pitch that is destorted all to hell for me so for me the A/V is Audio 0 / Video 0 if anyone can help please respond this sucks I cant wait to see this movie I will help seed when there is a good copy thanx
,tpbking,2009-12-18T02:56Z,"sorry to hear that 4rost well it isnt a fake or anything but maybe try the vlc media player it works fine for me i sure hope that this will work for others since i never heard any complaints about my other torrents hence i even have the whole south park collection which is 32 gigs and nobody posted problems with video or audio all i am trying to do is to share a great indie movie with you and it all works fine with me yet somehow this isnt really picking up so well due to some decoder failures! I mean i aint stupid i`ve done a few torrents and can handle the way to convert and sync it properly please dont think that i am taking the micky out of you cause it doesnt work for you yet i am trying my best to share a movie with you.
for all the others please comment to tell me how it worked for you so that i can better my efforts for the future thank you"
,4rost,2009-12-18T20:44Z,Alright I got it working with the vlc player it just does'nt work with my windows media player it plays a bit glitchy at times its not perfect for me but it is watchable so thank you for the upload tpbking and I hope you will seed us the leaked dvd I have been hearing that is supposed to be leaked out in a torrent file monday the 21st thanx again
,tpbking,2009-12-18T22:16Z,i am so glad too hear that i hope it was also in sync for you this time and also i will surely be seeding the dvdrip version as soon as its available on the 21st dec an early christmas present for ya`ll
,4nd0r1n,2010-01-01T10:45Z,"People, please seed this! Nintendo has stopped the producers from showing the film to anyone. Don't let this monumental independent film go to waste!"
,highlander777,2010-01-01T23:02Z,Why is the torrent file so HUGE (812KB)?
,ifandbut,2010-01-01T23:36Z,"I get the same high pitch that is distortion that 4rost was having. I'm useing Media Player Classic - Homecinema Build 1.3.1264.0 with FFmpeg Compiler version GCC 4.3.3

I have never heard of VLC player before. Is it free or will I have to torrent that as well?"
,mqduck,2010-01-02T06:13Z,VLC is free in more ways than one. It both costs no money and is open-source. It's probably the best video player for Windows.
,no-success,2010-01-03T04:53Z,@dragoonadept: You have to be kidding... VLC is the most updated and complete video player on all platforms. Slow and laggy and low quality... maybe its been a while since you've tried VLC but its great at playing HD x264 mkv's.
,Ifuckandy,2010-01-03T07:46Z,"You people with your windows media player cracks me up.
""VLC is for low end PCs"" said some idiot
If you wanna play virtually any video on your computer,(not only PCs) play it with VLC - videolan.
That's simple as that.
By the way thanks for the video."
,NoseMan79,2010-01-05T01:46Z,"hahaa!
fuck you nintendo"
,zelectric,2010-01-05T06:18Z,"Thank you so much for this!!! I too had problems until I tried VLC player, and now it works perfectly."
,Pike84,2010-01-06T03:49Z,"I couldn't get it to work either (will try VLC player later): ZoomPlayer didn't play it at all, and showed the play time as 9+ hours, Media Player Classic showed the right time, but didn't play either, and WMP gave those glitchy sounds with a visualization like others described. I also have CCCP installed, so it's not about that. Perhaps it's not all bad if it works with VLC, but I'd say there's gotta be something wrong about it.."
,zodiac321,2010-01-12T22:52Z,"Just for the info, you will not find this anywhere online to stream as Nintendo doesn't want people watching it anymore (basically pulled the plug)"
,djdragon1979,2010-01-14T08:37Z,"Nintendo is just jealous because this independent film based on their IP is doing so well. and because we all know the last Nintendo based movie sucks balls, AKA Mario Bros. They know if they stop Hero Of Time they will try to make their own POS Zelda movie, and it will end of biting the big one like Mario Bros. did."
,Tektool,2010-02-04T10:24Z,"Real Deal, not the animated one that loder put up.  Thanks tpbking"
,Tektool,2010-02-04T10:28Z,Should have mentioned real deal as in a fan made movie.  Cheesy though.
,kosselammm,2010-02-22T12:38Z,Why doesnt the images work? I can only hear what they are saying but i cant see anything! Help anyone?
,kosselammm,2010-02-22T12:56Z,"it worked with the VLC player. should've read 4rost comment first ;)

after seeing 10 minutes of this ""movie"" it couldnt possibly be a nintendo producters movie.. it seems homemade :S"
,tpbking,2010-03-04T14:35Z,i just wanted to thank all the seeders that are helping me on this one so THANK YOU!!!
,webace87,2010-03-24T23:36Z,"This AVI uses AVC1 Video Codec, not a standard codec amongst most popular media players.  VLC supports most codecs including this one, however this video will soon be re-uploaded with a standard DivX AVI Codec soon ^_^"
,ezboard,2010-05-21T07:35Z,I don't get why nintendo would interfere... this movie was being given for free to people
,LH-TAIMI,2010-06-30T11:47Z,"gr8 move :) quality good, sound is a little bit of good, sometime is hard to hear what they say, and some ""parts"" are very bad :( i like the movie, but when they kill the ""troll"" its very bad, the ran away, and after a sec the troll is down O.O "
,LH-TAIMI,2010-06-30T11:49Z,"wow, nintendo are selfish, "
,akdude413,2010-07-15T06:31Z,"I downloaded this using Frostwire, but it\'s not playing. I have VLC on here but that\'s not bringing it up either. What do I need to download this file?"
,tpbking,2010-07-24T12:57Z,"@akdude413
try downloading the newest version of the vlc media player if that doesnt work then write a new coment and i will upload an other version"
,Juggalo_Stitch,2010-10-29T05:27Z,"i call this epicness! i got it awhile ago, but never had time to come comment. works fine other than VLC hasnt updated to take tha corniness out of movies yet. thanks for tha upload tpbking!"
,CaptainHook15,2011-04-11T02:14Z,works good but really cheesy acting and i know its a fan made movie but after all the hype i was  disappointed.
,call_me_nobody,2011-04-14T20:34Z,"seriously fuck windows media player, its a piece of shit program!

I use vlc for all my media and it hasnt failed yet!

For playing 1080p and 720p i recommend media player classic home cinema, it can play all kinds of media inclute HD, and mpchc also uses gpu to render so u can game or do heavy cpu process programs while watching a full HD movie withput disturbence"
,call_me_nobody,2011-04-14T20:35Z,But for a low cost or maby a home made movie ill give it a 10/10:)
