"1 Thing" is a song written by American R&B singer-songwriter Amerie and Rich Harrison for Amerie's second studio album, Touch (2005). The song is influenced by go-go rhythms and features a prominent sample of The Meters' 1970 funk recording of "Oh, Calcutta!", written by Stanley Walden. Its lyrics focus on an unidentified "thing" that fuels a romantic attraction.

The song was released as Touch's lead single in 2005, and is the only single from the soundtrack to the 2005 romantic comedy film Hitch. "1 Thing" peaked at number eight in the United States and number four in the United Kingdom, becoming Amerie's first top ten single and her biggest hit to date, also peaking at number one on the U.S. R&B singles chart. Its digital download and ringtone releases were each certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The song earned Amerie a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 2006 Grammy Awards. A remix of "1 Thing" features rapper Eve.

The music video for "1 Thing", directed by Chris Robinson and Amerie, revealed to the public the singer's sexual side. It focuses on her dance routines, featuring her as a go-go dancer in various setups, intercut with footage from the film Hitch. Amerie co-directed the video with Chris Robinson after she approached him with the video's concept in mind. The two collaborated again when directing the music video for the following single, "Touch".

Touch is the second studio album by American R&B singerâ€“songwriter Amerie, released in the United States on April 26, 2005 by Columbia Records and Sony Urban Music. It spawned two singles: the number-one R&B hit "1 Thing" (which also has a remix featuring rapper Eve) and the Lil Jon-produced "Touch". The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 124,000 copies.

Touch helped her win the Vibe Award for Club Banger of the Year for "1 Thing". The album was certified gold by the RIAA on August 4, 2005, four months after its release, having sold 406,000 copies in the United States as of June 2009. It also earned Amerie two 2006 Grammy Award nominations, including Best Contemporary R&B Album. The song "Talkin' About" would be sampled on Chinese singer CoCo Lee's "Hip Hop Tonight", from her 2006 album Just Want You.
