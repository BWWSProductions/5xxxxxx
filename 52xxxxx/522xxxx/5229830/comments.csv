,PopeYodaII,2010-01-02T23:52Z,"...well fuck.  I honestly wasn't expecting the torrent to ever start.  If you read this and your reply was to begin seeding, you have my gratitude.

P.S. I suppose I'll be seeding for a week..."
,antibob,2010-01-11T13:43Z,"i'll be keeping this alive for as long as possible. It's a great collection ( I actually will need to read book 11, as I was listening to the audio books and came across the Text aloud. Fucking horrible)"
,Kustan420,2010-04-11T01:08Z,"EXCELLENT Series... Tis missing the Icewind Dale Trilogy, which happens to be pivotal. Wulfgar, Bruenor, Cattie-Brie, Regis, Artemis Enteri.. All these characters introductions set the tone for the ENTIRE STORY! Where the FUCK are they?!?!?!?"
,Demyslith,2010-04-29T23:45Z,"@Kustan420:If you look it is included in the torrent but not the description.

Also I will seed this torrent as much as I can."
