:
Rogue Warrior is set in 1986, as Dick Marcinko and two fellow warriors infiltrate North Korea to track down a mole within the army that has information on a top secret ballistic missile project. Unfortunately for Dick, his teammates are killed by a grenade shortly after they attempt to eliminate a patrol. Disregarding calls from his commanding officers to abort the mission and escape the country, Dick forges ahead, blasting a path through North Korea and Russia as he tries to destroy the missiles before they can be used against the West. The plot is rather poorly developed, as Dick ignores orders, and makes his own decisions on how to kill as many communists as possible over the eight missions of the game.
