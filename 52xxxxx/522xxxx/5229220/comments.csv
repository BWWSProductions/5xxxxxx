,EnemyDrone,2009-12-19T21:22Z,Why ANYONE would want to see a TS or cam of this is beyond me. You are cheating yourselves from a visual treat. I understand D/L and all but this movie deserves to be seen on the big screen or at least a Bluray rip.

,PhilnLisa,2009-12-20T10:32Z,"Why anyone would think that everyone that wants to watch this is as obssessed about this bullshit movie as some of you geeks are, is beyond me....

To most people this is just another shitty movie, just like all the rest...but they watch it, simply because it is available to them for a download, or are regular 'cinema goers'

I am only downloading this because it's there, never would I of gone to see it at the movies, or bought it at a shop, or even rented it out! So I certainly don't give a toss as to what quality it is, I'll probably just watch it at 3am on my laptop anyway.

As it happens I quite enjoyed it, so thanks to Internet Downloads, I may even buy the blu-ray when it comes out.......Getting the early release, when it is in poor quality may actually be benificial to that scenaio, in that if the downlaoder enjoys the film, they will especially be more keen on actully buying the movie solely for the difference in quality....

Then again I am really stoned at the moment, and have no idea if any of that made sense..."

,rorina,2009-12-20T12:35Z,"this movie needs no deserves to be seen in cinema at least. I t should be seen in 3D cinema there are fleeting moments where you feel you are in the room with the characters. The 3D is not the typical poke you in the eye with a stick gimmick . Mr. Cameron has used it in such a way to immerse you in the movie. The editting is perfect the pace of the film is constant through out. See it in the cinema, if you can in 3D.If you can't see it in the cinema because of location I apologize for my comments. If you can however see it in the cinema or in 3D cinema. Then every reason you give is a lame ass punk excuse. Sometimes you gotta nut up or shut up!(Zombieland qoute).Avatar is a groundbreaking movie. It set's the bar a little higher ( or alot higher actually)for storytelling in the visual medium. So climb out of your parents basement ask for a more cash and go to tne cinema. If you disagree well I'm OK with you being wrong."

,Arkenoid,2009-12-20T13:33Z,"I'm all for the illegal downloading and stuff, but really, watching a cam version of this is going to rob you of experiencing the most detailed (and expensive!) CGI movie produced so far!

Personally, I thought the 3d IMAX version was pretty cool but the 3d didn't add too much film wise for me.

IMAX uses pop-OUT 3d, where 3Real and dolby 3D uses INWARD 3D and doesn't make your eyes hurt and also looks way more real. in addition IMAX uses linear lenses so you have to look at a specific angle to see the 3D (it disappears if you move your head)
