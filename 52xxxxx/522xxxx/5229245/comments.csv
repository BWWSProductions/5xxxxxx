,joex15,2010-01-06T00:22Z,"Thank you for the download.  Tried to start program and recieved General Protection Fault.  Found this page with download patch, but the patch can't find the program because it wasn't ""installed"" : http://www.atari.com/support/na/faq/tacops_pc.asp
Seems that the GPF is something that atari knows about.
I think I'm done.  Thank you anyway."
