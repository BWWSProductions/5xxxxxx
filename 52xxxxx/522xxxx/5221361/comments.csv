,nessunoic,2010-07-06T13:56Z,"it works for me
but there was one problem - the game installs wSock.exe and progressbar.js into C:\Program Files\Common Files\CimObject\

progressbar.js invokes wSock.exe multiple times and this causes the processor to run at 100%. I suspect this to some sort of a virus even though no antivirus detected it. Simply remove these files"
