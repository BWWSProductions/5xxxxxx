Also, if you care noting, all of your .M2TS movies work flawlessly on the WD HD TV Media Center since i believe that there are others like me that don't watch them on a pc, mac, ps3 or 360.

later."

Im in the middle of building a new PC so ill be back to uploading in the new year.
If anyone is interested, Iv started converting these 1080p rips now to a 4.7gb iso instead of a 4gb m2ts file. They can be burned straight to any standard size blank dvd and they play fine on the PS3 and BLU-RAY Players. You can squize a bit more bit rate into them aswell ;)
Well thats it for now. Have a great xmas.
