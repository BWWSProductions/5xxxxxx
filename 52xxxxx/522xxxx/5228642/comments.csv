[T],Booster2,2009-12-20T18:35Z,"""Included in this torrent are all 3 movies plus original covers for all. I'm pretty sure they where ripped off VHS but they are still awesome quality.""

I can ensure you that they have been ripped and encoded DVD discs. And it is I who created those XviD's files. Want some proves? http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4541883/Star_Wars_Trilogy_(The_Original_Unaltered_Trilogy)_(NTSC)"

,agtarus,2010-11-21T05:18Z,"thanks for this original material

I have just seen a first screening of The People vs. George Lucas documentary from Alexandre Philippe

You should go and see it.  In theater soon.  

Kind of a major : you shouldn't have done that documentary on how everyone feels it is a shame originals theatrical release is no more available.  

All geeks and star war fans should see it."
