This is the original Star Wars Trilogy before good old George Lucas got ahold of them and decided to fuck them up by remastering them.

No descrition of these movies should be necessary as I'm sure every one on Earth knows of these movies.

Included in this torrent are all 3 movies plus original covers for all. I'm pretty sure they where ripped off VHS but they are still awesome quality. 
I appolagise but I'm not sure of the Ratio or framerate but please take my word that they are very good quality rips.


If you have any questions regarding this torrent or I have messed it up somehow please leave a comment and I'll get right onto fixing it.


I hope you all enjoy these movies as much as I do.
