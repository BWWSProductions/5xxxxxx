,Kigaruna,2009-12-18T15:59Z,Again crappy audio... why this happening? Does all dvds was mastered so badly?
,simps_br,2009-12-18T16:15Z,"Its a line audio... Its the only one available so far. The R5 DVD had this audio on it, so this is all there is so far. I am sure the retail DVD audio will be much better, but we will have to wait for it."
