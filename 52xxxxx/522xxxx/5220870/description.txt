                    Drama series. The team receive double the  
                    amount of images in what appears to be their  
                    most unfathomable mystery so far. The images  
                    seem to be predicting a robbery, a fire and  
                    multiple deaths, but how can they trace so many  
                    clues in so little time? One of the images last  
                    time was random; are some of these the same?  
                    How do they know which images relate to the  
                    event they are supposed to stop and which ones  
                    they can trust?
