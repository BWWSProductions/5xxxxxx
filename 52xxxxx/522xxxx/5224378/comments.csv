,Sarmatae1,2011-09-22T03:35Z,"Hey Riddler, saw you were having some trouble here so I thought I'd hop in and stand up for you and your torrents.

This torrent is on the level, pirates. It's clean, glitch-free, and complete. Small file size can be a good thing. Don't judge based on size, it's not that kind of party. If you don't know what you're doing, or commenting on...then say nothing. It's not cool to damage an uploader's reputation by talking shit when you clearly are unknowledgeable in the shit you're talking.

I downloaded this last year and still have it and seed it. Shame on me for not commenting then, but seriously...it's legit. If you want it, dl it. I guarantee it myself.

If you have questions, hit me up. I don't know RiddlerA and wouldn't lie for him. What I WILL do, is defend any torrent or uploader that has done us a service and is getting unjustly slammed by trolls."
