I looked in here  and find it and it works I was worry for the virus but it's clean for anyone who need it it will wipe the computrace on the latitude laptops or the administrator passwords on the bios .... you still need to have access to the bios if its lock you cant use this software"
,nailbender,2010-06-06T10:01Z,Worked great on Lattitude d620 but was a no o on Inserion 1501. 
,GODZRUS,2010-08-21T04:50Z,"I picked up a Dell 4100 laptop today.  It had a master password in the bios and I could nto make any changes.  I called Dell and tried to do it by the book and they basically laughed at me.  This would not work right off as the computer was set to boot to HD first.  Pulled the HD out and then it had to boot to the CD.  All reset now.  In conclusion............SCREW YOU DELL!!

Thank you for this great program, will get a lot of use out of it in the future."

,rezmax,2012-03-13T08:26Z,"Doesn't work for Dell Latitude E6520...
Comes up with system ID: 0x0494
BIOS REV: A05
This system is not supported by this utility (error 2).

Very unfortunate as this would have resolved everything quickly. 

If anyone has any tips on how to edit my BIOS please let me know. I have full admin rights (zero Passwords). I want this stupid computrace off my computer as I'm not paying for it."
,cwgate,2012-03-27T04:58Z,"Had occasion to use this on a GX270 and noticed the errors reported above.

When it boots into DOS Windows 98 screen at the A:/ prompt

asset /d 

Then answer Y to delete the Asset tag

Reboot and press F2 for Setup"
