,dControl,2010-04-17T07:12Z,"@xXeSPeeXx
that's exactly what i was fcking thinking.."
[T],TeamPS,2010-04-18T02:46Z,"@xXeSPeeXx and dControl

Some people don't know about freeware apps, unless they're posted on sites like these. Try growing brains, you thick fucks."
,Larskilli,2010-05-22T10:31Z,"Like p0wersurge says, not everyone knows how to get stuff like this for free. I have no idea, I'm glad I can just type it into piratebay and continue with my day.

thanks for the upload, man :) "

,la_cross37,2011-01-09T23:12Z,"This version is obsolete, the latest version for the moment is 4.40.1

Daemon tools lite is available for FREE on there website - http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads

Daemon tools lite works for (as far as I know and have tested, it might work for other operating systems too but these are the only ones I have tested on):

Windows XP 32/64 bit

Windows Vista 32/64 bit

Windows 7 32/64 bit


Downloading from the daemon tools website = :

100% virus free download guaranteed

Stable download speed

Always the latest version


Downloading using this torrent:

Virus free download can't be guaranteed (but I'm pretty sure the torrent is clean).

The download speed can vary a lot, but it can also be faster depending on the number of seeders and leechers.

You have to check the daemon tools website if daemon tools in this torrent is the latest version or if there's been a new release, or you can download and install the program and then check for updates using the program."
,eXoflow,2011-01-14T19:44Z,"Why use lite when you can get advanced for free:

,AldisEir,2011-03-26T14:04Z,"When I try to open DT a window pops up and says that there's a problem in the command line, I have windows 7, any suggestions as to what I can do??"
,Holdaas1993,2011-04-26T08:08Z,You can get this fully updated for free on their website so this is really pretty useless.
,1ThtGuy,2011-05-07T18:15Z,"just asking, whats the point of downloading it here when you can get the updated version of deamon tools free from the web site?"
,plafta,2011-05-16T17:22Z,Thank you vm!!!
,hettinger,2011-10-07T10:04Z,"Don't go to Daemon Tools for their ""free version.""  Their ""free version"" is merely a trial offer they can use to advertise themselves with."
,la_cross37,2012-02-16T18:52Z,"Daemon tools lite is legally free from the daemon tools website (http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads), but you can however use a serial key if you want to be able to get support. If you haven't bought the product you won't get any support, but you can still use it. When you're going through the setup it will ask you if you want to use a paid license or a free one, just choose the free one. It's perfect for mounting .iso files to install games or watch movies in .iso format or other similar things and formats. If you want to find out more about the difference between the lite, pro and the pro advanced version just head over to their website."
