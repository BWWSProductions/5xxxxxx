,Catastrophic_Failure,2009-12-31T06:38Z,Sometimes people are just being idiots too on1n3 and are in the habit of getting people to hold their hand through the entire installation without using their brains. Be careful with how and when you help.

I got the .iso from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4898537/Europa_Universalis_3_Complete_Edition then mounted and installed, ran the game once (not sure if it's necessary to do so, just throwing this out there) and then ran the .exe from this torrent.  I'm running Windows 7 32-bit."

,mr_peruna,2011-02-05T13:48Z,"If your game is crashing at the start (after maplogic)
 and you have installed the ""divine winds"" from this torrent
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6036299/Europa.Universalis.III.Divine.Wind-OUTLAWS
, try reinstalling everything without the divine winds, worked for me."
,philicus,2011-06-24T01:43Z,"crashes when it gets to ""map initializing.."" during boot up. Then it goes to eu3.exe not responding. Anyone else have that problem? i am on windows 7."
,[SMURF]Lolsmurf,2012-02-16T09:51Z,"****FIX FOR THE PEOPLE WHO GET THE CRASH AT STARTUP ****

1) DISABLE INTERNET CONNECTION 

2) Start the game from your program files europa universalis folder, click RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR

3) PLAY


=> A lot of people said: oh easy game no need for crack or something, well that's not right, the game must have some sort of built in registration which allows it to connect and try to register your game, this is what causes the game to crash at startup after the creating world or intializing map.


If this still doesnt work, go to the program files europe universalis folder and there you find settings.txt file

OPEN IT

a) set : fullscreen to NO (instead of yes)
b) PUT THIS UNDER GRAPHICS: size=
{
	x=1920
	y=1080
}


(**choose your own destkop screen resolution and adapt it**)

c) PLAY"
,afpeixoto,2012-02-28T02:26Z,My map is blue lol.. anyone knows why??
