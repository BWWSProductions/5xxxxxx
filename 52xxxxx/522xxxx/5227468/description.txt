aka Erotic Perversion - Here are the infamous Cole Loops, a shocking expose of American S&M and bondage. Let me start by saying that this is not for everyone. This 2 hour collection of loops was made during the 70's era of porn where laws in the states were much more lax. Nothing like this is being made in the states now. Years ago Robert Cole and Jason Whitman set out to do a series of bondage/S&M loops like nothing before. The basic plot of these 9 loops: A series of masked sexual sadists kidnap various women and take them to a variety of remote locations where they dominate and torture them into submission. Heavy bondage and intense, twisted, sadistic theme make this not for all viewers. Ambient soundtrack throughout, very little dialog. Back in the mail order video piracy days this title was ordered so often it literally broke two industrial strength VCR's. Enjoy gang!
