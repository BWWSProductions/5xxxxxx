,chief_petty,2009-12-19T14:05Z,"geomau - look at the right hand side it say ""By: Wendys99"" and has a pink skull'n'crossbones.

This is a 'Wendys99@ download and I have never had a problem with any of wendys99 files

It is only sensible to check ANY file when you download it, but the uploader is NOT a fake "
,HOGSpazz,2009-12-19T21:54Z,"McAfee prevents me from downloading this, says it has ""generic!bg.eg""...I've played many of Wendys99's without any issues (Thanks Wendy). Any thoughts?"
,barnaclebilly,2009-12-20T16:44Z,"Ok you lot, I haven't actually played the game, but I HAVE downloaded it and installed it WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE!! As usual -for a wendy game- it downloaded fast around 600 Kbs/s and is virus free. THANKS A LOT WENDY! As we say in my part of the world, yer blood wants bottling... Which, actually, is a very high complement. Keep up the good work (please)."
