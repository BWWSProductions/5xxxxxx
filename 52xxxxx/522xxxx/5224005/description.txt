DVD Rip to DIVX AVI, 720x480, ~98 minutes.


Decent instructional video, a bit dry at times.  Although I prefer the Nikon Guide to creative lighting (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5180584/Nikon_School_-_Guide_to_Creative_Lighting_-_Full) which offers more interesting setups and situations - this DVD does go more into more detail using and setting up speedlights in various modes, CLS, etc.
