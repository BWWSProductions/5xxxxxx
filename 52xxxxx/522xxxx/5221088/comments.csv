[V],phatwarez,2009-12-16T15:59Z,Very watchable. Since it's an animation you won't notice the quality problems normally associated with cam/telesync. This will be perfect for shutting up the kids on the ride down for christmas.
,dome-of-the rock,2009-12-17T07:52Z,You call this watchable ? Watched 10 min of it and will get some aspirins now for the headache. I'm not wearing any glasses but when I watch this film it is as if I was and I had mislayed them somewhere. The film is all blurry. Thanx anyway for uploading. I guess this is for hardcore fans that just HAVE TO see it before anybody else. I'll wait for the DVD rip...

It's a kid movie... My hardcore fans are 6, and 9 year old girls. "
