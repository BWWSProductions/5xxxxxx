Eph 6:11  Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 1Co 15:22  For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1Ti 2:4  Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. Luk 20:38  For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him. "
