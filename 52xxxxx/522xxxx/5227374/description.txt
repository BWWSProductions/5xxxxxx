An artifact known as the "King's Seal" is stolen during transport from the Soul Society by an unidentified Soul Reaper and two Arrancar resembling girls who control fire and lightning. During the attack, Toshiro Hitsugaya corners and seems to recognize the Soul Reaper, who immediately stabs him in the stomach. In the middle of battle, Hitsugaya abandons his post to pursue him and leaves his squad behind to fend for themselves. After the battle, The Soul Society suspects Hitsuguya of treason and orders his immediate capture.
