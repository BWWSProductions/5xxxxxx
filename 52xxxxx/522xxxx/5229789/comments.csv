,zapiolanz,2009-12-21T22:57Z,I download it yesterday IT WORKS PERFECTLY!thank you so much
,SirBieber,2009-12-23T12:39Z,"I've downloaded about 5 languages so far, and all seem to work fine except level 1 of Hindi. Its been working very slowly if at all, and sometimes it just gets stuck after a complete exercise. Anyone know why this would be? "
,maroonhs,2009-12-24T10:07Z,Thank you so much!
,calicali,2009-12-25T01:00Z,"Someone please tell me how to install, i burn the iso to a image and folders option open when i put the disk in..please tell me how to install and setup properly...thanks you."

,duobeef,2009-12-28T02:53Z,"I'm still getting an activation prompt when I start it...is there an activation code for this or will we be able to continue using it if we keep hitting ""activate later""?

Also, I agree, this Hindi package is functioning quite slow...I've been waiting a long time for Hindi V3 though, so I don't mind.

Help with the activation would be much appreciated though!  And thank you very much for the upload!  My mom will be proud when I finally know Hindi"
,SirBieber,2009-12-29T00:44Z,"You will have to click activate later with every use. also another word of caution you will not want to update anything with rosetta, that will mess things up. 

If anyone can help me figure out why its working so slowly for me let me know. bunch of other languages work fine and this one (all levels) is really slow, and after an exercise or 2 it will just freeze. "
,atlhafiz,2009-12-29T08:29Z,"Thanks for the download. However, it isn't working.
Rosetta stone comes up with the error 3221 saying that ""This language content requires an update of Rosetta Stone"". Can you please help me with this because I desperately want to start learning."
,lovecookie,2010-01-21T11:36Z,can someone tell me what i am doing wrong i got the audio companion to work just fine but i am having trouble with the rest of the download. 
,SirBieber,2010-01-22T22:40Z,"Im still having trouble too. the audio companion is fine, the lessons arent working. They are very slow, and after a few exercises it will freeze and not move on to the next page. im using RS version 3.4.5. If anyone has any idea let me know. I need this to work."
,lightbearer7,2010-02-18T00:02Z,Thanks!!
,johnn2727,2010-03-03T13:48Z,how do you install?
,why_oh_why,2010-05-01T04:26Z,"tried burning the ISO files to disc, but
it burns the ISO into 4 seprate content files

so not working, any suggestions anyone"
,whisperingwillow,2010-05-04T23:47Z,"Once I get to Lesson 3 I can't go any further without an activation code. Just pressing activate later won't work anymore.
What do I do?!?!"
,logovore,2010-06-07T18:50Z,"Hey all, I am really confused by this torrent.  When I try to add a language file to Rosetta stone, it looks for a cd with the language loaded.  I can't mount these files like isos so there is nothing for Rosetta stone to find.  What do I do with these folders?"
,Joe3W,2010-09-17T04:24Z,"Hey Atlhafiz, did you resolve the problem? any help would be appreciated.. thanks."
,tttgroup,2010-11-09T09:54Z,Do you have Urdu as well as we have heard the Rosetta released Urdu in august.
,Kam_Kam,2011-01-11T04:47Z,Im having trouble getting the actual language pack into the rosetta stone program. I have the programe already downloaded but can get the languages in. Please help!
,TMacDMB,2011-03-02T03:55Z,"Works easy as cheesy on Mac OS X.

Download Rosetta Stone:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5181175/Rosetta_Stone_Application_V3.4.5_for_Mac_OS_X

Fallow install instructions for above.  Then simply mount the iso (double click it mac os x - gotta love it), then open app and install the data.

Wicked easy.  Thanks"
,TMacDMB,2011-03-02T04:47Z,"Actually, it works too slow (at least on mac).  Forget my above post.  It makes the app run slow and when you speak for audio recognition, the slowness causes it to skip, deeming the program worthless.  Its a total bummer cause the app is great.  

Someone please post working hindi data files"
,TMacDMB,2011-03-02T04:52Z,"Actually is doesnt work.  It works too slowly and when it records your voice for voice recognition (a huge part of he software) it does not recognise it cause it is skipping it (due to it processing too slow) - deems the program unusable.  

Its a shame cause the software is AWESOME.  Someone please upload working data files or point to them.  THank You!"

,quadojo,2011-09-27T06:29Z,"i am in need of a little help, I've downloaded the Hindi levels from this torrent and I've downloaded Rosetta stone 3.4.5 and tried 3.4.7 and neither of them recognize the Hindi ISO's when i try and virtually mount them Rosetta stone doesn't recognize that anything is there. what should i do?"
,quadojo,2011-09-27T20:15Z,"jk. figured it out, all i had to do was restart the computer. don't ask me why but after i rebooted Rosetta stone accepted the ISO's without a problem"
,jboggle,2012-01-20T18:19Z,"Oh, I seriously love you. This torrent rocks!!"
