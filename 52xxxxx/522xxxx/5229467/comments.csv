,GGAllinlives,2009-12-23T09:28Z,"lolerskaters dont jump on him he was talking about an account that posted that was probally banned for spamming. he's not crazy, it just looks that way. when an account is banned all post it made are deleted like they were never there."
,ANG369,2009-12-23T13:34Z,"willywonka111111:

Between the imdb link and my comment, someone wrote something about free movies online and shit like that. The mods must have erased it.
This however does not mean that there shouldn't be a ""report spam"" button.

maxnaz: You're explaning to me what imdb is? And I'm the ""obviously a nub""???
Why won't you tell us all what google is??"
