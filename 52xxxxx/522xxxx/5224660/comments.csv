,JakeN440,2010-01-05T09:02Z,"And btw the disk Image is the ISO file, Take that and drag it into your image catalog right click and mount"
,JakeN440,2010-01-05T09:06Z,"BTW the disk image is the ISO file, Usually anyway. and you just take it and drag it into the 'image catalog'. right click and mount image, auto run should pop right up"
,sewer-rodent,2010-01-05T15:50Z,"there isnt an ISO file, or any other type og image file..."

,Oreo2996,2010-01-14T02:15Z,"@Kazza786

I mounted to drive, checked the drive I mounted it to, and only the RAR was there which I could do nothing with, other than remount which just gives me the same iso."
,Kazza786,2010-01-14T09:50Z,"@Oreo2996

What Mounting software are you using?
Its best to use power ISO.
also, what OS are you using?"
,Oreo2996,2010-01-15T01:34Z,"@Kazza786

I am using PowerIso, and have used it before so I know what I'm doing.

I am running Windows 7."
,oriam12,2010-01-16T01:53Z,"WTF? i installed it then it said to insert cd, it didnt come with anything to mount!!!! >:("
,duffmanthegreat,2010-01-16T03:18Z,"I desperately need help. I cant find any image to mount? Im using daemon tools, if that helps."
,CYM1,2010-01-17T01:42Z,This works fine you bunch of noobs! Step one: DOWNLOAD! Step 2: Mount the disk images. Step 3: Install Step 4: Crack it using the included crack Step 5: Play the damn game!

,GCooper14,2010-01-23T14:55Z,"Would someone please just inform us where to find the .iso?  I've downloaded and installed, and I know where the crack is, but I'm stuck, because I don't know what to mount.  There is no iso file."
,iwilleatu,2010-01-25T03:48Z,"why do you people even bother coming on here and download games when you don't even know how or worse how to even get started, go do some research. Is this unrated or the remake? i want hot coffee, is it possible with this?"

,kickflipfromhell,2010-01-30T22:47Z,"xxskullkillxx   this is your torrent,  and when there is more than 5 people asking what file to mount, you should post which one it is....       "
,Viva-La-Tailsko,2010-02-02T09:31Z,"My install finished but the file ""data2.cab"" is incomplete and it won't install because of it. Any solutions? Much appreciated!"
,endsenten,2010-02-03T01:21Z,"No ISO needed, just run ""Install.exe"", then replace ""gta_sa.exe"" located on the installation folder with the file on ""Crack""."
,pazeatcow,2010-02-07T06:44Z,"Stuck at 99.7%. 

Wow."
,kent92,2010-02-07T19:27Z,"ok guys, you don't need the ISO thing at all!

1. download this torrent, which will make you download GTA:San Andreas pc

2. after you download, find the folder and the readme

3. double-click on the folder ""gta san andreas"" (i probably missed capitals) and find ""setup.exe""

4. run setup.exe, and it will install the game on your computer (takes about 15 mins) and when it asks to create a desktop shortcut, click ""yes""

5. after installation is complete, go to 
my computer > c: > program files > rockstar games > gta san andreas 

6. look for the file ""gta_sa.exe"" and delete it

7. now, go back to the original ""gta san andreas"" folder in step 2.

8. open the folder ""crack"" and look for ""gta_sa.exe""

9. copy THIS ""gta_sa.exe"" and paste it in the ""rockstar games"" folder in ""my computer""

10. double-click this gta_sa.exe or go to the  desktop and double-click on the shortcut.

11. enjoy!

**THIS REQUIRES NO CD/DVD BURNER, NO ISO, OR ANY SHIT LIKE THAT. NO NEED TO MOUNT, ETC ETC ETC**

just follow my steps and you should have what i have."

,Juggalo_1,2010-04-26T19:47Z,"it works,, but is Soooooooooo Laggy. Im runnning it on a Dell Dimension 2400, 2.4 Ghz, 1GB RAM, 500GB HDD. its even quite slow on all the lowest quality settings. I think I need a better graphics card though, even though mine meets up to it"
,thunderman1212,2010-04-28T00:33Z,"WOOOOW Nice download, I was desperate for a download cuz the one i burned to my DVD had catastrophic failure...whatever that is xD But great download, only took about 30 minutes.

,Cody_Watson,2010-06-22T05:11Z,"1. Download torrent (duh)
2. Open the folder you've downloaded
3. Click on ""setup.exe""
4. Click ""No"" on the setup for online gameplay and ""yes"" for desktop icon.
5. Let it extract
6. Go back to step 2
7. Click on ""crack"" (Folder)
8. Copy ""gta_sa.exe""
9. Go to where it extracted to (mines: C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Grand Theft Auto
10. (OPTIONAL: Create a backup of ""gta_sa.exe""   and replace it with what you did on step 8.
11. Enjoy playing GTA SA

Now, on to my problem. I did those steps and I've been playing for a while, but all of a sudden when I click the shortcut it opens up fine, but when it gets to the loading screen it freezes about 9/10 of the way down 

I installed s0beit (hacks) and it said it froze on stream.ini  SO: I'm asking if anyone can post what their stream.ini says in it, to verify if it's incorrect.

Thanks and your welcome"
