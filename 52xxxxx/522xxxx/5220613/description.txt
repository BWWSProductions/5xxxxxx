The Temper Trap - BBC Live Lounge 15th Dec 2009 (2 songs)

The Temper Trap performed Sweet Disposition and a cover of La Roux's In For The Kill because they like her hair.

The lads are going back home to Australia for Christmas where it's currently 39 degrees! They're all going their separate ways though because they're getting fed up of each other.

Joseph from the band has the most annoying habit, apparently. The other band members says he goes around smelling things and smelling people.

Their favourite Christmas song is Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You so that pleased Fearne.
