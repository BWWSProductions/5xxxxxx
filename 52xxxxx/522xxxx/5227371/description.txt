Wikipedia - The Best of 1990â€“2000 is the second greatest hits compilation by Irish rock band U2, released in November 2002. It went on to become the 12th best selling album in the world that year. [1]. Among the 17 tracks are four remixed or re-recorded tracks and two entirely new songs. In December of the same year, a companion DVD (featuring music videos and live footage) was released.
A limited edition version containing a special B-sides disc and a bonus DVD was released on the same date as the single-disc version. At the time of release, the official word was that the two-disc album would be available the first week the album went on sale, then pulled from the stores. As with The Best of 1980â€“1990, this threat did not materialize.
It includes two new songs. "Electrical Storm" was released as a single. "The Hands That Built America" appeared on the soundtrack to Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York film (with a different, more traditional arrangement than the one here). For some reason, despite the title of the album, these two tracks fall outside the dates specified ("'Electrical Storm" did not exist in any form until 2002).
It is also the first full U2 release to include "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me", a 1995 single originally contributed to the Batman Forever soundtrack, and "Miss Sarajevo", another 1995 single originally released on Original Soundtracks No. 1 and credited to "Passengers", a pseudonym used for the side project by U2, Brian Eno, and various guests.

Amazon.com Review By Jerry McCulley - U2's second decade often seemed as preoccupied with the band's burgeoning superstardom--and how to confront/confound it--as it did with creating music. The band managed only four albums during the era (only of half its '80s output), projects whose gestations seemed perennially plagued by turmoil as much as mercurial creative instincts. But as this rewarding, 30-track double-disc anthology (and bonus DVD) chronicles, U2 ultimately managed a considerable feat: producing a memorable, lasting body of work in a decade when one of pop music's chief attributes was its disposability. Disc one mixes hits like "Mysterious Ways" and "One" with seductive soundtrack cuts (the title track to Wim Wenders's Until the End of the World, Batman Forever's "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me"), new mixes of "Discotheque," "Staring at the Sun," and "Numb," and a pair of strong new tracks, the Orbit mix of "Electrical Storm" and "The Hands that Built America," the title track from Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York. The second disc compiles the band's more experimental B-sides from the epoch (many of them remixes), and offers up a concise encapsulation of the band's fascination with--and shrewd incorporation of--electronica and club music. The bonus DVD contains a generous collection of videos of songs from disc one, along with alternate versions, director commentaries, additional bonus tracks such as "If God Will Send His Angels" and "Lemon," as well as a mini-documentary of the band's historic 1997 Bosnian concert, The Road to Sarajevo.
