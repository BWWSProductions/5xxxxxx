,nattytj,2009-12-29T08:03Z,"Hi, sorry I'm new to all this....I've downloaded the torrent via Azureus and it just shows in the folder as 28 files.  Can someone please tell me how to get it to play?"
,affinityw,2009-12-29T12:49Z,"Natty-this download has been compressed into .rar files. Right click on any one of those 28 files and select ""Extract here"" and the a window should come up showing the extraction process, it may take a minute or so. When its completed the normal .avi file will be in the folder and you can delete all the other 28 files. Hope this helps :)"
,nattytj,2009-12-30T09:47Z,Affinityw - Thanks but unfortunately when I right click I get nothing like 'Extract Here'.  Im running Visa so that may be why! 
,affinityw,2009-12-30T12:14Z,"Natty-sorry i forgot about that. I use a program called winrar to extract these zipped files but you have to pay for it. Try 7 Zip http://www.7-zip.org/ or other free software alternatives http://www.instantfundas.com/2008/01/10-freeware-alternatives-to-winrar-and.html

i hope you manage to do it because it's easy after you do it once and many torrents come zipped nowadays :) "
