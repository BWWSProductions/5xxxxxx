chuckmamuck and dirty_nigger are correct, its only fair that we keep seeding as a way of giving something back to the community. in order for this system to work we should always seed as much as we download.

I mean if you see the trailers ( http://www.seetrailer.com/2009/08/22/avatar-movie-trailer/ ) you'd think it's a regular movie and probably a disappointment like 2012, but trust me if you have a fragile heart and see this in an imax you might never get out alive.

,charybdisjim,2009-12-20T12:18Z,"There are some decent cam rips on here- this is one of them.  It's in English and the audio is surprisingly well captured.  Congrats to whoever recorded it- you managed to get the audio far better than I thought possible from a cam in a theater.

That being said, this and the other cam rips will only whet your appetite for this movie.  If you like it in this format, you will be blown away if you manage to see it in IMAX 3-D.  Maybe you should treat these lower resolution versions as an extremely extended trailer.  If you like what you see then please go see it in 3-D at an IMAX theater.  You'll be supporting a local museum (in most cases) and experience a truly amazing visual and audio feast that can not be replicated by a bootleg.  

This is one of the few movies I have seen in a long time that was worth the price of admission for IMAX 3-D.  I almost felt like I was in a fugue state when I got up at the end.  It was like I had been in another reality and had to readjust to my own less-beautiful and less intense reality afterwards.  I highly recommend it- assuming you even modestly enjoy what you see in this ""extended trailer."""

A/9,V/8  ,  Movie/10+

The audio is pretty remarkable for a cam and the video is very nice. Only problem I had with it is that it's kinda grainy, like watching an old vhs tape. Not dvd quality, of course, but very watchable. Why are so many of you whining and complaing? If it's not up to your standards, then by all means, don't download the damn thing. If you do, then seed please. It's not that hard to do.

,Kalilaff,2009-12-20T22:26Z,"Highly recommended to go see it in theaters in 3D (IMAX 3D preferably). This is one of the greatest movies of all time, movie of the year for sure. The stunning effects of the movie with 3D technology is an exciting experience worth paying for.

I went to see it twice in IMAX. It's that great of an experience. Support the effort, talent, and genius of the creators of the movie and James Cameron (creator of Titanic, The Terminator, Aliens and more) by going to the theaters. At least once before seeing it in lower quality. "

,TheobaldDancelot,2009-12-21T01:46Z,"thanks for the upload Extremezone....
audio is very good...video is not. 
not worth the d/l in general..in my humble opinion..as this film is all about the visuals.

music was shit in my opinion

saw it in the cinema today for the 2nd time and really noticed how bad the music is. the theme seems to be just like titanic theme but changes on the third note. bastards. Brad fiedel should have been dragged in.

p.s. to all of you my brothers, my mad seeders and leechers
isn't it funny how the pirate bay comment section has ended up being the most important place on the internet these days. i was speaking to a friend after the film and we were wondering where we should go online to discuss it/find out whether it was slated or not etc..

where else could we go but TPB comments? within 90 comments.. the core of human existence is displayed in its vulgar entirity. angry japanese and taunting americans lacing each other in the faces with completely uncensored realities.
the sweaty greed of the screaming leechers...
the odd helpful comment about the Na'Vi subs being in Russian..

If you don't like americans, well don't buy their products, buy other brands when it comes to cars, don't watch american made movies or television.

Don't buy their JUNKFOOD or DRINK POS COLA

When their economy crumbles we'll see whos tough enough to endure.

It's easy to wedge a war on people who can't fight back, just like hunting a tiger without claws or teeth or shooting fish in barrel!

Stop buying or support american shit, and maybe they wake up some day and smell the cofee.

LeSet-Go ahead stop buying American. We don't make anything here in the U.S. for you to buy. If our economy is struggling yours will follow. We import far more than export. 

There are 300 million people in the U.S. We are divided on so many issues here. Reading these comments though makes it sound as if we are all war mongering, narcissistic blowhards. Sure we have that here. Just as you have idiots in your country. 

Before passing judgement on an entire country maybe you should come visit.

Ni som tankar ner och ser den såhär är heligt korkade i huvudet och vet inte vad ni missar. Har ni å andra sidan redan sett den i 3D är ni förlåtna. SJälv tänker jag se den en andra gång på bio.

,Solon_Poledourus,2009-12-23T00:05Z,"So I found out a few things reading these comments:
1 - Elitepunk is a paranoid, whining little bitch.
2 - Slan101(amongst others) thinks he is better than people(or maybe just Americans) because he supposedly speaks 6 languages. Well, plenty of Americans, myself included, are fluent in just as many, if not more, languages. So there goes that dipshit theory.
3 - This movie is better to see in the cinema. Well no shit, what a fucking revelation! If you are so concerned with how much money James Cameron makes on this movie, then why the fuck are you supporting a torrent site?
4 - Telling people to seed will not do anything but waste space in the comments section, forcing me to sift through page after page of ""SEED U FUKKERZ!!11"", posted by people who don't seed themselves.

And finally, the most important thing I learned from all these comments is this:
People who complain about free shit should be shot.

You are spitting on this beautiful piece of art by downloading it.

Please. Buy the movie instead, and Cameron will surely make a sequal if it's popular enough.

 Most people, Like myself, use Priates Bay as a buffer to see if games, movies and music are worth spending our money on.  In my opinion the movie industry has been taking advantage of us for long enough by making thrilling, exciting 10 sec trailers for movies that fall far short of their self set expectations or are just completely misleading.

Quality overall was decent. Though I think people are being too generous. I give it A-7 V-6, in terms of being a cam. Above average, but that much CGI is never done justice on cams, for any movie.

Ok people, we get it. You want us to see it in the cinema. Read the fucking comments before you post the same, tired bullshit that the James Cameron boot licking squad has been posting. Guess what though? I'm not going to see it in the cinema. Not EVER. I don't like the cinema, I hate people, and I refuse to sit in a goddam room full of loud mouthed teenagers and shit bags who take crying babies to the theater. I have a HUGE, high quality TV, and when the Blu Ray comes out, I will buy it(or download it here).

When the avatars speak in their language the subtitles are in a language similar to Russian but they frequently speak English. It would be nice to see what they are saying when it is subtitled but I guess that is the cost of getting a blockbuster release on piratebay the week the movie comes out in the theatre.

I was quite impressed. I can only imagine how good it will be in 3D.
This upload was/is AWESOME...no wonder there are so many leechers. I've got it seeding priority 1 and shut down other transfers to boost it. V:9 A:9 (there's always room for improvement). 
I could have done without the cyrillic subtitles but I was too busy being in awe of the visuals to even notice really and I'm just too dogmatic to go about incorporating yet another player in my repertoire of video playing software. I'll pay more attention to the subs in theater (maybe).

Most people, Like myself, use Priates Bay as a buffer to see if games, movies and music are worth spending our money on. In my opinion the movie industry has been taking advantage of us for long enough by making thrilling, exciting 10 sec trailers for movies that fall far short of their self set expectations or are just completely misleading.

I have chosen to write my comments because like you I have a voice.....So to all of you whom feel that downloading movies, games, etc, You are nothing more than a statistic with the industry, To be exact the even if all 50,000 people downloaded a impression of the movie at an average of $12.00 per ticket that a whopping hit to the studio of $600k. which is less that 1% impact on the studio, considering expected returns and merchandising less than 0.023% of which is safe to conclude that 50% of the people that have downloaded have watched the movie already.....Its all about statistical return, To all of the those whom can read this far without the brain needing mom to bring your dinner, If the margin of return ever goes above 1% of a factor on the studio's profits do you all know how easy it is to purchase a little site like this and take control of the content, it would make more sense to wait and let the glass fill before you pay for it...In the mean time! download all your hearts content just do not let it get over that 1%, Then you will see a different site appear..."

,banan9943,2009-12-30T22:08Z,"@AOD_Creator, I registered here for the sole purpose of commenting on your ""hobby"" economics knowledge. 

Sure you have valid point in that the downloads from this site represents only a minor part of the total revenues for the studio. But in my opnion you are both using a low estimations for the number of people who watch the movie without ever paying but more importantly, you do only consider one site among thousands. Torrents like this is available in many many more sites and is also shared over several other thousands of file sharing networks. If you consider what has happend to the music industry you quickly realise that filesharing is a threat also to the movie industry. So to say that we represent only a small part of everyone that watch the movie is in my opinion equally idotic as saying that ""I dont care about global warming... or pollution, because what can one person really do??"" STUPID!

I mean they speak in English no subtitles through-out, when they speak Na'Vi they have subtitles in a different language, Russian I think, when they've finished speaking Na'Vi the subtitles go off. You have to either understand Na'Vi which I seriously hope no-one does; you could learn Russian if your English or vice versa if your Russian.

,dlarrym,2010-01-01T00:59Z,"@banan9943: If you REALLY looked at the music industry, you would find that sales have been increasing as far as profits for the record labels. Just for example, PDiddy... If he's been hurt from file sharing, how is it that BAD BOY RECORDS (P-Diddy's label) in 2009 earned more then it has ever earned since it came into existance. There is NO proof that sharing music over the internet is hurting anyones income. Last I checked, Madonna was still in one of her many homes and as of yet isn't homeless!! LOL!!!! The movies and music people hear from downloading ENCOURGES individuals to PURCHASE the music and to go see the movie on the BIG SCREEN... Quite the opposite of your opinion that it is hurting the music industry. One other thing.... I am 41 years old.... When I was 14, when I went to go buy a record (LP) [Cd's had not been invented yet] at the cash register, they had stacks of blank casette tapes for sale and some record stores even sold cassette tape recorders. We used to meet at out friends house 6 or 7 of my friends. We met to make JAM tapes to listen to in the car or on road trips. We all brought several of our favorite albums and we took turns combining different song arragements onto these cassette tapes. NO ONE got a law suit from any record label and it was obvious that people were copying albums without express written permission from the record label.... WHY only NOW did the music industry start getting all bent out of shape over people sharing there music. Why is it OK and FINE for me to use RCA type cables streched across a living room floor to copy an artists work, but to do the EXACT same thing using telephone lines and the internet, NOW we are getting attacked by the music industry. The Music GURU's did't care and even encouraged copying of there music... Why else would they sell blannk tapes at the same location you buy albums.... What did they think people would put onto these blank tapes??? They even were sold right beside a rack with all new music releases on them. If the music companies were worried about it, you would think they would have not distributed there artists music to the stores selling blank tapes. NOT even ONE music label did ANYTHING..... Only in the last several years has this been an issue. LASTLY.... When I download a movie from an individual, I have NO gaureentee that the copy I am getting is perfect. If I cannot get a perfect copy, I refuse to pay 17.00 US dollars for a copy made by some amatuer computer guy.... In a more direct way to put this.... I argue that when I download a movie, I would bet it isn't anywhere NEAR the same quality as if I went and bought the movie. SO, these quality differences make the movie I copied from the internet different from the store bought version. When you copy a movie from the net, it might end a few minutes early, or the 1st 2 minutes might be missing and in my mind if a movie is 2 minutes shorter then it is supposed to be, then I didn't make an exact copy of any said movie. My copy has slight flaws and such and therefore it is not the same identical movie... YOU SEE my point... Same with a music track. It might be messed up in all kind of ways. NO ONE at home is going to make a copy as perfect as the equipment the movie studios use to duplicate movies for re-sale. The movies I download don't have the extra scenes, interviews with the cast and director, or any of the other stuff included in a store bought DVD. If my copy is missing 30 minutes of extra stuff, interviews with the cast and such, that is pretty significant part that is missing. If I sold you a brand new Ferrari except it didn't have any rear wheels for it.... could you claim I sold you a car that is IDENTICAL to the Ferrari at the dealership... NO i couldn't unless all the cars at the Ferrari dealership are missing the rear wheels. SO my Ferrari with no rear wheels is a far cry from a ""perfect condition"" Ferrari. WHEN I BUY a movie on DVD, I expect it to have EVERY bit of DATA it is supposed to come with. If I have a copy that has the movie, but all the extras are NOT "
,bzzbzzbzz,2010-01-01T01:23Z,"Sorry, I've too much respect for James Cameron to download that. Ive paid for this and I recommend you do to so. Imax and 3D are a must-have for this movie.

Go see this movie !"
,fullsacksforyou,2010-01-01T01:25Z," banan9943 you have valid point if you?re looking at the whole filesharing thing from a film or record companies point of view. However gone are the days when film or record companies can tell us what to watch or listen too. Gone are the days when the public HAD to purchase cd, dvd or tickets to see a film only for us to be disappointed with the product. I ask you this, if you went to a restaurant and the meal was substandard you wouldn?t pay for it ?right? why should we pay for substandard music or films. This is a fact ?people who download music illegally spend more a year on music then the people that don?t download illegally? why? It?s because they downloaded an album, liked it and bought it, the albums they downloaded and didn?t like they deleted.  You may say this is rubbish? However I illegally downloaded X-Men Origins & The Dark Knight liked both the films and bought them on Blue-Ray. I also download Universal Soldier Regeneration watched and didn?t like, so deleted it. If I had bought it on DVD or Blue Ray I would have been so mad that I wasted my money and you can?t take a film it back to the shop for a refund because I?ve  ?watched it? . Is that fair? The film or record companies think that every illegally download is a lost sale, there wrong. The pubic now have a change to try before they buy. The only threat to the movie & music industry is the movie & music industry they have to stop making substandard films and music and raise the quality of their product. As for the people that download and don?t buy an original copy, there taking the place of people that recorded song?s and films off the radio or TV. I wonder how many people that would never download illegally have borrowed a film from a friend and watched it ?After all that illegally to?"

However, did you notice the 20,000 plus downloads on this torrent alone? I guess its safe to say that piracy is here to stay and has been since the days of Napster. You can't change the people's sway without locking millions of pirates away or putting us in concentration camps and if that day comes there will be a revolution like none before. So...you enjoy your movie ticket, which will exponentially increase in price with this economic turmoil, and popcorn and the pirates will continue being pirates and won't be repressed.

,Widowlicker,2010-01-05T14:01Z,"Thanks ( again ) extremezone for your contribution. Great quality as usual.

Video 8 / audio 8 / movie 8

A typical ""too"" flick. Too overwhelming, too much content, too everything, but not too bad for an animation with life actors. ( who still needs them after these developments in cinema )

LATEST NEWS: there will be a virtual sex-scene on the coming DVD.
I'm counting on you for this extremezone. "

,flamingfuzzy,2010-01-06T05:01Z,"For a normal movie, the quality here would be about a 6/10. Because this movie is so fucking amazing in 3D, this is a 4/10. It loses so god damned much between the theater and this copy. Go see it in theaters. You will NOT regret it"

,tuhkur,2010-01-07T00:15Z,"do NOT bother with downloading this movie at all. You will just get some blue guys running around the field for 3 hours. Go to the 3-D cinema, buy yourself a huge popcorn and relax. And you will get 3 hours of mindblowing speical effects and something to remember for several weeks. Seriously guys, to watch it with lousy quality from a tiny screen, is a waste of time."

Thankyou for your uploads! This is a very watchable movie. Bu I would go and see it at the movies first, perferrably in 3D. This is being hailed as one of the best movies of all time, so thankyou extremezone for making us able to watch this at home.

,born2bealive,2010-01-07T12:40Z,"If a website suddenly showed up that proved its legitimacy with regard to paying royalties to musicians and actors and software company's and this site just took 'donations' I think so many millions if not billions of dollars would roll in b/c people do feel guilty. pirate bay is really just a way of masses of people saying ""this stuff is too expensive to buy"" so the result is masses of people are just taking it for free? It's not right to download intellectual and artistic property for absolutely free anyone can see it is immoral (with the exception of a few). I would love to pay something for some things but there is no venue to do such a thing. Hey maybe I should start the site ""Pirate Pay"". We want to pay something we just kinda want to decide what we can afford and today we might pay a dollar but tomorrow we might pay a hundred dollars for downloading nothing but just to thanks because our tax return came in. I have found that people are good by nature.. just not always rich and sometimes we have very little money but could still use an uplifting movie or song."
,mumfi123,2010-01-07T13:01Z,okay I will say as so many otters have before me. this is the most awesome move I have ever seen! No way I would download this fantastic movie! if you only go to the movies once per year this is the one you go to :)  and on top of that you get to use fancy 3d glasses :D

,scrappyjohnson657,2010-01-07T20:36Z,This is THE film you've been waiting for. This is THE film that takes it to a whole new level. Remember how Star Wars used CGI and ruined the whole gig? Well this will be remembered as the first film that uses CGI and pulls it off. I saw this in 3D and it blows you away. 3 Hours flys by so fast you won't notice. Total immersion. Cameroon raised the bar with T2 and now he's done it aain. You will ruin something special if you do not go to the movies and watch this firsthand.
,kukkorv,2010-01-07T20:37Z,This is a movie that should be seen in 3D. 
,Robnisch,2010-01-07T22:12Z,"WAY to Bad quality imo... I've seen it twice in theatres already. Although once will do.

So take your imaginry girlfriend to the movies, buy some popcorn and soda, and make out with her after the movie, or wait for a Blu-Ray-rip in 1080P and go buy a 50"" plasma and surround-system and watch it alone.

Just see the movie. 
But not as a cam, or dvd-rip. And not on a tiny 22"" screen, and not with headphones.

Get the point?
See it, but don't SEE it.
K?"
,ozaawiinimkize,2010-01-07T22:49Z,"I really dont think we need sermons from 100 ppl telling us to see this in theaters. We're big boys and girls - we can make decisions for ourselves. 

On another note, this is just another pocahontas-danceswithwolves-lastofthemohicans-lastsamurai crapmovie about white people first trying to slaughter 'natives' and then becoming the savior of the 'natives.' Its got to be one of the most recycled lines of bullshit in the history of hollywood. 

The only saving grace of this flick is the visuals. "
,Neytiri,2010-01-07T23:36Z,"Thanks! But I have only one thing to say about this - either you watch it in the cinemas in 3D, or you download it later on in 1080p or you don't watch it at all. Simple as that. Once again, extremezone, thanks for UL."

Not putting you down extremezone, but no cam or DVD rip could ever replace seeing this in 3D at a theater (lucky 3D TVs are the new HDTVs)."

It does not matter what version of utorrent I use, or computer. always xp, currently using ut 1.8.5 on a wrt54g that is repeating. Is it because my router is set up cascading at the end of the line?

Props to James Cameron on a major comeback my boyfriend noted that James used a few props from the Ailen movies like the war ships and stuff. Don't you guys think that for a futuristic movie 2164 is not too far off and we should already be living like The Jetsons? We talk about how far the Human race has come along we don't know if there are other species out there waiting to be discovered and I think this movie really touches on that I will see it again.

It makes me really envious when everyone speaks so highly of the cinematic experience, that's all.  I mean, IMAX is practically science fiction to the poor hicks who live out here...  I'm just glad I'm tech-savvy enough not to qualify as one - I might have to shoot myself."

(My bloody valentine...)  but then my friend said we were going to see it in IMAX and he was paying.... that changed everything. 

Those of you who have seen it in reg theaters know these copies don't do it justice...

Those who took the rick and watched it in 3-D wonder what's the point of a dvd rip... that won't do it justice. Bare minimum of 720p and that probably won't do it right.

,AkaPhsyco,2010-03-01T11:54Z,"Hey MPAA you ever heard of innovation? 

Based on the condition of the movie industry over the past half of a decade, it would assuredly seem you haven't! 

Nice lame ass commercial at the beginning of your dvd menu's btw, ""You wouldn't steal a car would you!?"" 

Yea and Refer Madness was a factual depiction of marijuana use. 

The film industry has been separated from legitimate Art and Entertainment for half a century at least!

2tb and counting Dl'ed and believe me more to come!

Let me ask you this, the music industry got decimated by the digital pirate revolution, has music gotten any worse since? Haven't seen a NSYNC or Backstreet Boys in awhile. I wonder why that is?

If you really do it for the art, you should be happy to share your ""product"" and be happy with the theater tickets we buy!!!

Support Net Neutrality! Support the resistance against companies like Comcast trying to monopolize the internet and throttle innovation and connections! Write your congress/parliament, who's members time and again naively fail to understand how important a free and open internet is to this generation and the generations to come!

We all have grown up intimately connected to the internet. We've seen it sprout from a simple conversational tool in its public inception. Watched it grow into and industry must have with e-commerce. Blossom with sophisticated social networks and tools for musicians, amateur film makers and software designers to reach people in ways not even conceivable merely years ago.

 The fate of the internet; actual ""intellectual"" content, entrepreneurial availability and personal and artistic communication, is far too important to be left in the hands of people who have no reverence or little understanding.

Firstly I'd like to say I am not impressed by this movie due to the 3D technology or the CG.  And by the way, this is essentially a high-tech Pocahontas.

For everyone else:
Quality: 5 - VHS quality...could be sharper, slightly washed out and a slight scanline effect (like the flicker caused from low refresh rates on TVs and monitors)


Sound: 8 - Of course not as good as a theatre or DVD sound but close and the well synced.

,alexg69,2010-04-29T01:17Z,this a cam not a dvd rip
,esovia,2010-04-29T06:28Z,"This movie is awful. Childish, boring. It is an absolutely worthless movie."

,ImKamile,2010-05-09T05:00Z,"@esovia :
This is the second Avatar torrent I see you comment on. Okay, we get it, you do not like the movie. You say its childish? Well you are too, because mature people dont go round talking trash about the movie they ""HATE"" on every single torrent. So can you do me a favor? Shut up."

,Esmad3,2010-08-11T14:46Z,"If you download this you deserve the bad quality. It will be a learning experience. When you find out why the movie you just watched was of terrible quality when there is a BR version, and how this could easily have been avoided, you will be a richer person."
