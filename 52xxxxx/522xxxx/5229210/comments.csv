[T],trialNerror,2010-10-23T13:40Z,"Thanks for the bundled package of Season 5.  AAF, CAC, and Crimson know how to make quality rips.  Thank goodness these aren't really puma's rips.  His of season 6 are 4:3 ratio and not a standard .avi compression (requires re-converting to playback on PS3 or other DivX players).
Use XViD!  Do NOT use x264!!!  "
