I uploaded this just to ask everyone to post compressed images. Come on guys, why upload .iso, .mdf, .bin etc. formats and not a compressed format like .daa for instance? Just install PowerISO, double click to open the .iso, .mdf etc. images and press Compress. You will save for yourself a lot of hard drive space, and a lot of time for torrent downloaders.

No offense to anyone, I just hope we can and will be more efficient. If I succeeded in convincing 1 user, I saved thousands of download hours from now on. 


After download is complete, just rename DISCIPLES3.daa.iso to DISCIPLES3.daa.
Download and install PowerISO to open/mount the .daa image. (it is like any .iso)
Or, just use a portable version of PowerISO to transform the .daa into .iso.

Enjoy! (it is still not cracked yet, we'll have to wait)

7.17GB vs 4.9GB ... you choose.
