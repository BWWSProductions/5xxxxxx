Allmusic:
One of Australia's most gifted and versatile performers, Kate Ceberano's 
music crossed several genres and made her one of the most popular female 
vocalists of the 1980s and 1990s. Ceberano first rose to prominence as the 
teenage lead singer of Australian funk-pop outfit I'm Talking in 1985. Their 
debut (and as it transpired, only) album, Bear Witness, produced three hit 
singles, including "Love Don't Live Here Anymore." I'm Talking disbanded in 
1987, and Ceberano released her debut solo jazz album in that same year. 
Kate Ceberano and Her Septet, featuring her brother Phil and veteran 
session musicians Alex Pertout and Jex Saarelaht became a huge hit, and 
was followed in 1988 by You've Always Got the Blues, which featured 
Ceberano and Wendy Matthews as vocalists. In 1988 the first single from 
Ceberano's eagerly awaited first pop album was released. "Bedroom Eyes" 
became the highest selling Australian single of 1988 and helped Ceberano win 
two ARIA awards for best female vocalist in 1988 and 1989. The album, 
Brave, was released in 1989 and went triple platinum. "Young Boys Are My 
Weakness" was also released as a single from this disc. Another jazz album 
called Like Now followed in 1990, then her second pop album Think About It 
appeared in 1991. However, it could not build on the success of Brave and 
failed to produce a strong single. 1992 saw a stage production of Jesus 
Christ Superstar open in Australia. Ceberano won the part of Mary 
Magdalene, and performed alongside John Farnham, Noiseworks frontman 
Jon Stevens and former Rose Tattoo lead singer Angry Anderson in the 
show. The Australian cast album went four-times platinum and Ceberano's 
song from the production - "I Don't Know How to Love Him" - was released as 
a single. In 1996, another pop album, Blue Box, was released, and this was 
followed in 1998 with Pash. The 60s-influenced pop of the title track became 
her biggest hit since "Bedroom Eyes." A best-of collection entitled True 
Romantic appeared in 1999.
