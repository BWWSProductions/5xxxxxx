Winston Churchill succeeded to highest office amidst turbulent and extraordinary events. In the early 30s, his powerful warnings about the dangers of Nazi fanaticism had been dismissed as alarmist: but by the time he became Prime Minister on the afternoon of May 10, 1940, his grimmest forebodings had been proved all too true.

Western Europe was a cauldron of war. That morning, German divisions had poured irresistibly into Holland and Belgium, thrusting for the French frontier.

The prospects for Britain and her new war leader were inconceivably bleak. French intelligence estimated that Britain could withstand a German onslaught for no more that 3 weeks. Hitlers forces had enjoyed unbroken, astonishing success, and even the highest levels of power in London thought Hitler could not be beaten.

Churchill alone never faltered, announcing to the British people that his aim was Victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror; victory however long and hard the road may be.
