,vramin,2009-12-18T14:03Z,"Why I hate rars - 

In order to watch the movie, and continue seeding, you need to keep two copies of what is nearly 1 gb. 

I realize that disks are cheap these days, but rars are completely unnecessary these days for p2p. They just add overhead.

I am not ungrateful for the share... just suggesting that it could be more efficient.

thx"

,mulukku1,2009-12-19T21:46Z,This movie is a really crappy one. These people who made this movie should go and hang them selves.
,KurkoDokoljenko,2009-12-20T00:15Z,"Why does everyone on here think we care what they think of the movie? What kind of a person comes on here and thinks they are some torrent critic. I don't fucking care what you think. You are here to download torrents and post on quality, what has happened to the torrent community that all of a sudden everyone is a critic. Maybe I am over reacting but I am tired of see this shit on every fucking torrent. "
,dragon_prince,2009-12-20T00:26Z,I suport KurkoDokoljenko in this... yust cuz you have seen a movie you think is bad others might not. I have not seen this one but im sure its fine.
,fester0420,2009-12-20T01:50Z,I agree. Oh and aftaab4u you need to unrar first then you can play it. its a file like 7zip. winrar works real nice. if still you have problems google is your friend.
,numse,2009-12-20T03:59Z,"fuck rar! noob!

,scarygood48,2009-12-20T10:19Z,"I actually appreciate the comments on what people think about the movie.  99% of the time when people say ""worst movie ever"" it is usually terrible.  Pretty much what zmacdaddy8 said."
,barlakoski,2009-12-20T22:24Z,PLS SEEEEEEEED DUDES TOO SLOW DOWNLOAD THX FOR THE UPLOAD !
,Juggaloinvasion,2009-12-20T23:07Z,"We care to hear your opinions to rate the movie and also rate your intelligence level. I personally wouldn't waste my time seeing this movie. i have a hate for the US Army and do not support it at all, let alone bad acting in a ""Support our corrupt ways"" movie. They are here to brain wash you. You like them your a fucking moron sheep. Its the same with a ""marriage/ christian"" movie or a movie staring jack black. "
,JBNyen,2009-12-21T11:47Z,@zmacdaddy8 - Amend on that

,sonofdog,2010-01-04T00:57Z,"Seriously bad! For the money and skill involved to make this rubbish we could have saved a third world country, instead of corrupting it. Technically well made, but the lead character cannot act. The script and military advise is absent. Marine 1 was bad enough to have been made by George Bush. This is sooooo bad Dick Chaney must have leant a hand!"
