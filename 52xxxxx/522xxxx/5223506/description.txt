For many people, Basil Rathbone's portrayal of the iconic detective Sherlock Holmes is the definitive screen version of Arthur Conan Doyle's much-loved character.

In 1939, Basil Rathbone made his first appearance as Sherlock Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles, directed by Sidney Lanfield for Twentieth Century Fox. Sporting the trademark deerstalker and pipe, Holmes sets out to uncover the legendary curse of the Hound of the Baskervilles amidst the moody, atmospheric landscape of the moors.

In 1942 Universal decided to revive the Sherlock Holmes films, bringing back the successful partnership of Rathbone and Bruce in Sherlock Holmes and The Voice Of Terror, directed by John Rawlins. This time the films were re-vamped for modern audiences. The deerstalker was cast aside and Sherlock Holmes entered the twentieth century in this film set during WWII.
