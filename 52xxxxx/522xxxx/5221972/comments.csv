God you're making me tear out my hair with these picks,  what thirteen-year-old is picking these titles?  Who gives two shits about goddam G.I. Joe?"

Go buy it and scan it yourself if it's so damn important."

So what you're saying is that because of people like me uploading torrents, you have the chance to get comics you wouldn't otherwise be able to get?

Yet you still complain about your free comic not being available. Pretty damn ungrateful if you ask me. 

Say thanks to the scanners for the hours of work they put in each week. It doesn't take much and you won't come across as quite so unappreciateive"
