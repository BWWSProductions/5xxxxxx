,eXeQiEl,2010-04-21T19:35Z,"thanks man, just nowaday (2010.04.21) i realised about this new version. I was reviewing my movie collection and looking for a higher quality release of the movie, and found this.
I said, ""well, i didnt ever heard about this ""mall hours cut"", lets try it"".
Nice one, the 154mins unnofficial cut. Very nice.
I've seen that there is a spanish hardcoded version in 15 links of 100 mbs. but it's hardcoded, the idiot didnt wanted the pure srt or whatever was releases as a standalne subt.
So, im gonna work in the Spanish subts as much as i can, and ad it to your info so we can have the nl an sp subts available for the people. I was considering to DL a ripped version, a less space consuming version, but realised it's almost unique to have this apocryphe versions. U can buy the original dvd, but this ones r hard to find sometimes.

Now u got a new seed pal!

Another fanedit that im seeding it's ""Waterworld -The Ulysses Cut"", the longest ever edition of the movie, from a guy called mcfly89.

Take a look if u want to. There's is a poor rip made by me too. Here u have the two links.

2010.04.25

well, thanks for being online! haha, i just realised a pop up message told me the SRT is downloaded.

I dindt realised, untid y saw it. Cause i said ""but the movie is already downloaded, and im online seeding it, so... why is uTorrent saying me its downloaded=? dled again?""
so i checked, and realised that the finish message was from the little srt subtitle file.

I was expecting that u conected someday to catch the file again, cause it seems that ure the only one with the file. I almost lost my hope on you to being connected.

Well, now i have it too, so im gonna seed it from today. There were at least 30 ppl waiting for u to connect, haha. They were waiting for ur subt

So. thanks again

greets from Argentina

,Bagrawr,2010-06-16T17:36Z,Why is the file so big?
,mariusjr,2010-06-21T03:04Z,"Because it is DVD quality.
