About Ambulette(From their myspace):
Ambulette is the new expression of songs from Maura Davis. In the summer of 2004, Davis was thinking of how to get a new project off the ground. With a phone call to Chicago the Richmond, Virginia native enlisted bassist Stephen Howard and drummer Ryan Raspsys to begin working on her home-recorded demos(Chicagoans had served as the rhythm section for Maura's previous band Denali on their final U.S. tour). The three musicians began by sending discs back and forth from Virginia and Illinois. When songs had taken shape, Maura headed to the midwest to rehearse. Those rehearsals proved the songs had promise. The three made plans to record a demo EP the following month at Phantom Manor Studio in chicago. With Maura back in Chicago preparing for the session, a third Chicago talent, guitarist Matt Clark, was added to the group. What the four members of the as-yet-unnamed band put to tape at the Manor is precisely the sum of it's parts. Davis's compositions draped over the expert rhythms and low-end melodies of Rapsys and Howard then warped by Clark's anaesthetizing guitar tone. All four can play the lights out. Ambulette is a body holding great potential energy. They are now standing at the start overlooking vast opportunity. There is much anticipation. Following the release of a c.d. - e.p. on March 21 (Astralwerks), the band will be touring extensively this spring, while preparing to record a proper full-length record.
