The story was ok..but it so much eye candy going on...def see it in the theater, youd only be cheating yourself"
,neil22768,2009-12-20T08:33Z,"GPB2008 are you fucking blind this is the worst cam ive ever seen a5 v 4 defo wait for an R5 line

and yes thanks uploader for the try :]"
,GPB2008,2009-12-20T08:55Z,"@ neil22768 ...

NO HOMEY, IM FAR FROM BLIND .. IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ""CAMS"" THIS TELESYNC IS GREAT FOR A MOVIE THAT CAME OUT FRIDAY!!! 

AND FOR YOU TO RATE THE AUDIO - 5 .. 

CMON SON!!! A MEASLY 5????

ARE YOU DEAF??

FOR EVERYONE WHO TAKES PART IN THIS RELEASE YOU TELL ME YOUR HONEST TO GOD OPINION OF A/V??

BECAUSE CLEARLY THE VIDEO IS MUCH BETTER THAN A RATING OF 4/10 AND THE AUDIO IS MUCH MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN A 5/10 ... I THINK THAT YOU SIR (neil22768) ...

JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE GREAT WORK!!! SAD REALLY ... AN YEAH YOU SAID THANKS TO THE UPLOADER FOR THE TRY, BUT HIS TRY WAS DAMN GOOD CONSIDERING!!! 

SO NEIL WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE HOMEY AND ONCE YOU CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING TO TPB WORTH SHARING (BESIDES 9, IT WAS GOOD) THEN TALK TO ME .. BUT TILL THEN, RESPECT OTHERS WORK AND DON'T GET VULGAR!! YA DIG!!! "
,Gleaneagle,2009-12-20T14:43Z,"Hahaha, got your panties in a twist, GPB2008, and ""HOMIE"", it is indeed a great effort from TvTeam and i do thank him for it but remember that a rating of ten is supposed to be for the video quality and this being a telesync it is not blue-ray or DVD so it can not be a 9. If you give a rating to others they tend to want a rating of the video quality not your opinion of the upload. And writing everything in caps does not make your point any clearer...  ""ya dig"""
,neil22768,2009-12-20T15:36Z,"im not trying to piss on anyones bonfire but serious gpb you gave v9 so you must be blind v5 at most yes audio is alot better than a5 maybe 7.

im allowed an opinion like you so dont tell me to watch my language you fucking arse cunt wanker bastard that better get a life dicj head"
,Gleaneagle,2009-12-20T15:55Z,cheers for the site neil!!!
,hukkab,2009-12-20T18:54Z,"gotta say, for a movie that came out this weekend, this is a pretty good TS of it.  it would make so much more sense if people gave it ratings based on what type of release it was, because obviously no cam is getting near a blu-ray quality level, but they're both on the same scale.  i watched this last night and i def thought it wasn't that bad of quality, for a quick release telesync it actually is pretty high on the list..."
,johnnyathm1,2009-12-20T20:07Z,Link to the HD trailer:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5140947/Avatar_Trailer_2_HD1080p   enjoy...
,GPB2008,2009-12-20T22:44Z,"I GUESS IM DONE WITH GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH THESE NOOBS ... BUT FIRST OFF, I DONT TYPE IN CAPS TO GET MY POINT ACROSS, BECAUSE ITS JUST NOT WHAT I DO ... BASED ON A TELESYNC .. THIS IS VERY GOOD QUALITY .. BUT YES LIKE @HUKKAB SAID .. I AM BASING THE RATINGS OF TELESYNC RELEASES NOT DVD OR BLU-RAY QUALITY ...

BUT NAH NO PANTIES ARE IN A BUNCH, BUT @NEIL22768 AND @GLEANEAGLE .. ITS COOL THAT YOU HAVE YOUR OPINIONS OF THE RELEASE .. ALL 647+ SEEDERS HAVE THEIR OPINIONS, IM NOT MAD OR ANYTHING, ITS JUST NO NEED TO USE PROFANITY THATS ALL ... BUT AGAIN THANK YOU TVTEAM .. SHOUTS TO EVERY ONE OF YA'LL!!"
,.BlackIce,2009-12-21T10:24Z,"This is very good quality for a CAM rip.  Everyone elses uploads have watermarks and dumb shit like that.  If you want to watch this movie without going to theaters, then I recommend downloading TvTeam's version.  The two CD's packed into .rar's are kind of lame, but the movie rules.  Thanks a lot, unlike most of the assholes who say FUCK YOU, THE QUALITY SUCKS, WHY IS THIS NOT ON DVD EVEN THOUGH IT WAS JUST RELEASED IN THEATERS A COUPLE DAYS AGO AND I'M A FUCKING MORON, I appreciate your upload.

Audio: 8
Video: 8.5
Movie: 9"
,GPB2008,2009-12-21T20:29Z,"@.BLACKICE MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY LOL ... ENJOY THE MOVIE BROMIE!!!

IMAX 3D IS THE PLACE TO SEE IT IF YOU CAN!!"
