[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-17T20:08Z,I don't wanna upset anyone but I already have a big amount of films that I plan to rip so I can't take any suggestions or requests for that matter.
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-18T02:52Z,Jaws and Seven Samurai I think I'll do in the near future.As far as the anime goes it just isn't my type.I like more realistic animes you know?
