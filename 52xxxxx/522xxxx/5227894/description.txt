In India, the criteria and indicators approach for sustainable forest management is being implemented
on a pilot basis since 2000. The initiative, known as the Bhopal-India process, has over the years
endeavoured to formulate a working framework for the achievement of the goals of sustainability
specific to the national forestry conditions. Forests provide a wide range of ecological, economic and
socio-cultural benefits for the communities, enhancing their quality of life. However, the dynamics
of forest management in a developing country is unique, as the multiple uses of forests are clearly
felt in a multi-stakeholder environment. The application and monitoring of criteria and indicators
by the communities together with effective institutionalization and capacity-building can provide us
tools to review the progress towards our goals of sustainability. This article discusses the application
of criteria and indicator approach for sustainable forest management, giving a picture of the present
situation in the country towards achievement of sustainability of our forest resources.
