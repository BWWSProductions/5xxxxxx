,born2bealive,2009-12-20T03:37Z,"zero seeds, zero leechers? vip? am i in the land of oz here or what?"
,dimsums,2009-12-23T12:49Z,"its real im guessing. hes VIP thats what the green skull means. also its a dual audio so it will have more data then other cam versions. and higher quality means more data.

it starting in theaters means shit all. the dvd's for it are already being made. somone that works for the company that makes the dvds probably already has a copy sitting in there dvd shelf."
