So, this is the SACD version, right ?"

I guess you don't understand how FLAC encodes a file. Because you select 1024 kBit/s does not mean the tracks will have 1024 kBit/s.

Here's a capture of your album in foobar2000, none of the tracks have the same kBit/s and none of them have 1024 kBit/s by the way.

I had the same discussion here with a user, I can't remember his name but I hope you're not that user...

Take care,
