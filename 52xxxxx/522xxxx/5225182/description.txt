Ltd Ed.. well what can i say about this, inside the box came a black light and a complete white album... firstly you can actually see the band name on the CD if you look close enough.. the covers front and back were completely white so i added the stickers off the box after i took scans first.. and stuck them on the covers so it now looks like an Album... Weird! Bubs

But overall, Brilliant Album i gotta say....
