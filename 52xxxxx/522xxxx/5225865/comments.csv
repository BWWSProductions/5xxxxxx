any chance episodes 351,355,356,360,361,363 and 374 could be seeded again at some point? would be most appreciated :)"
[T],captim,2009-12-18T22:30Z,"@Syantha: I have them not in my torrent client anymore, but I can reupload them for you, if you want me to do that?!"
,Syantha,2009-12-19T02:11Z,"whatever works for you, I'd be happy to upload 2008 and 2009 compilation after, got every one of your torrents completed except the ones listed above and I edited most ID tracks to their real names"
[T],captim,2009-12-19T10:33Z,"I'm not at home, but I'll take a look around christmas, if I can upload a collection of the requested episodes. Would be a nice xmas gift, wouldn't it ;)?"
,bobstarone,2009-12-19T12:29Z,Captim rocks.
,Syantha,2009-12-19T15:18Z,"would be great! btw episode 374 is seeded now so only need the other 6, thanks alot mate looking forward to it :D"
,Syantha,2009-12-19T15:22Z,oh if you have any episodes older than 348 with split tracks that would also be super! I'll of course help seed a lot :)
,VoodooSlumlord,2009-12-20T00:08Z,"Thanks again, Captim!"
,SKO22,2009-12-22T00:47Z,"Captim, thx from Ukraine!
Nice job. Last time download Armin van Buuren only from U'r torrents.
Good quality & split files."
[T],captim,2009-12-26T18:46Z,"@Syantha: Please be patient. I need some time to split the tracks, don't have them separated anymore, but mp3+cue. And I will eliminate all ID tracks."
