This is a match from 2003 when Steph was forced to fight WWE champ Brock Lesnar.  Steph was an active wrestler at the time and also the Smackdown General Manager.  Vince was trying to get her to quit so he put her up against Brock.  


Comment and let me know if u enjoyed the match.  Steph looked pretty damn hot as well.



Oh and please remember to seed.  Thank you.
