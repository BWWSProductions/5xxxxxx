,jabe75,2010-02-23T13:03Z,"this is great,but comparing to remastered mp3 version(about 90Mib), only the volume is little louder in this one,sound quality is exatcly the same. I know that huge amount of mp3's has crappy quality,but in this case i prefer smaller package.. great job anyhow and thank's to the uploader."

Will seed as long as possible."

,chrisblackcatpirate,2010-09-06T15:17Z,"Great, why in the world anyone would alter the lineup  from the original is a disgrace. Luckily I have never heard the ""new"" redone versions and hope I never do. Thanks for the torrent. I lost my old cd."
,locofocos,2010-09-21T04:08Z,This is a great torrent. I've been listening to this and the 2002 remaster. There are subtle differences that make this version really stand out. I would recommend this version over any other torrent you might find.
