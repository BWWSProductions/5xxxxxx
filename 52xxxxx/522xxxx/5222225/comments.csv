A quick note for thouse who are fussy about album covers (like myself), there are no album covers in this torrent... but that is easy enough to download from the 'net.

And oh, about Alicia Keys... classical Alicia. She is not great (probably will never be), but it is as always good enough and makes for some very easy listening."
