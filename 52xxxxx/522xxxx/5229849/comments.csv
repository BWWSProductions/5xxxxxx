,Namibio,2010-01-17T04:29Z,"It's not fake. I clearly stated that i took an early release an uploaded the torrent here. The original seeder was lost, but ths torrent is still healthy. I will seed as long as it takes, there is no fake files or porn references, or asking a plugin or something.  I do it to spread the knowledge, and beat the reigning idiocracy (as you can see chapuratin).

Cheers"

,Namibio,2010-10-21T01:02Z,"I never said so. The files in the list are the files you will download. Period.

Please keep in mind the fact that many psychology books (most of them state of the art) are not in torrents. Some of them are not even in digital format, so there is no way to find them, unless they are digitalized (scanned). Another fact you have to consider is that every university has different curriculum, so the books you need to pass the classes are not here."
,jak_sparo,2010-10-31T14:49Z,"sry for such comment

,bandini21,2011-09-19T02:22Z,Please seed!  I'm stuck at 604 MB and I REALLY want these books.  
,Namibio,2011-10-23T02:39Z,"Guys, I'm seeding now, but I want to ask you a favor. Please seed to at least a ratio of 1 (The same amount of data downloaded is seeded). Thus, because right now I'm at very limited bandwidth and can't seed faster."
,nnonny,2011-12-11T03:15Z,"you may find these videos of psychological counselling by experts from different schools of psychology interesting. (thanks to symfora for uploading)
