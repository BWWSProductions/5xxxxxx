,PinkPuspe,2010-04-04T12:36Z,Absolutely fantastic picture quality on my viera 42in plasma
,repetitiousous,2011-03-08T21:22Z,Could you please make a shorter version of this? I've seen plenty of CD sized Blu-Ray rips that looked fantastic and had 1280x720 resolution. So for this document 2gigs would be neat. 18gigs is overkill. Thanks anyway.
,giffo5,2011-05-16T15:05Z,Thanks Very much to the Uploader !

To people: seed pls, this torrent deserves it."
