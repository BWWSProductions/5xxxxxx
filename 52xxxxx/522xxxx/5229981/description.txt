                TuneUp Utilities 2010 v9.0.3000.136 (Final) + Keys



Release date: December 18, 2009 (12/18/2009)


TuneUp Utilities can make your Windows operating system faster, more comfortable 
and more secure with just a few mouse clicks. And all operations performed on the 
operating system are completely safe, because all changes are monitored by TuneUp 
Rescue Center and can be undone at any time. All TuneUp Utilities modules can be 
accessed through a common interface that is divided into six categories.

The software helps both beginners and experts to make Windows meet their needs in 
a way that is better, easier and safer. All important system options are explained
in an easy way and can be turned on or off at the click of your mouse.  TuneUp 
Utilities will then make the necessary changes in the registry or boot files 
automatically. We place a high value on system stability, so that Windows won't 
stop working reliably. And most changes that you make can be undone in TuneUp 
Rescue Center - easily and safely.

TuneUp Utilities automatically runs important maintenance tasks for you, makes you 
aware of any problems and offers simple solutions. This ensures performance is 
always at its best. A slow and untidy computer is now a thing of the past for you. 
You can also use TuneUp Utilities to customize the appearance of your Windows 
system - to make working on your computer more enjoyable.

With TuneUp Utilities you will quickly make your Windows system faster and more 
convenient to use- and ensure that it stays like this for the long term. This 
makes TuneUp Utilities the perfect program for everyone: for those who would 
rather leave the computer maintenance to a reliable partner as well as for 
those who would rather do everything themselves.

The TuneUp Turbo Mode provides an immediate performance boost whenever needed. 
When you use your computer in the TuneUp Turbo Mode, an analysis is performed to 
see which tasks, programs and functions are currently running in the background 
that are not strictly necessary. These programs are stopped or slowed down, 
allowing the additional processing power gained to be used exclusively by the 
programs you are actually running.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
