But look: Not only is this piece of work encoded with ""Matroska"" but the CCCP codec pack recommended for it also does NOT play it! VLC, MPC, WMP, none of them play the video portion of this even with the codec plugged in! 

On top of this: Any ASSHOLE who creates a torrent for a movie to the size of 1.9 GIGS should have their equipment confiscated and be banned from the net to begin with! It's a 41 yr. old movie, it took 30 hours of constant download to acquire it and damn, I'm PISSED with the dick who initiated it. Isn't it about time you little peckers learn how to use ""Any Video Converter"" and crunch these down to 350-450MB filesize like they should be?

Well, that's what I am doing now and ALL players above will play the output file with no problem. This POS at 1.9G, forget it... none can produce more than the audio output! 

Whose the ASS who started this? INCOMPETENT!"

Hey dumb ass, I found this movie at a private community (and that was only after *days and days* of searching the hell out of it.)

When I finally found it, I decided to make it available here.  It played perfectly fine on my computer (including in VLC and WMP.)  I did NOT have to download any CCCP codec pack that you speak of; all I have on my system is the K-like codec pack (seems to work for everything I download.)  Since it works just fine; I'm not going to re-encode it (only to lose more quality) so a dipshit like you can ""enjoy"" it.

I've been seeding it on-and-off since uploading the torrent.  I can tell you that there's been upwards of 100+ completed downloads.  And so far, you're the only ass hole who seems to have a problem with it.  Obviously, if your piece-of-shit computer has problems playing the file, your computer is just that; a piece of shit.

""... crunch these down to 350-450MB filesize like they should be?""

Like they should be?  Are you fucking serious?  You're better off watching your movies on an old VHS VCR vs. a 350MB AVI.  As for the 1.9GB filesize; yes, it's that ""big.""  Some people actually like higher bitrates (looks cleaner when watching on a big-screen TV.)  The lowest movie filesize I will settle for is 700MB (and quality-wise, that's pushing the limit.)

As for your preferred filesize of 350-450MB; WTF; do you live in the Internet dark ages and have a dial-up connection?  And 1.9GB is too ""intimidating"" for you?

I can only deduce that you don't give a shit about the quality of your movies if you're looking for 350MB filesizes.  Go fuck yourself!"
