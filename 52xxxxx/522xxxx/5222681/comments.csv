,ltorrentstorm,2009-12-17T01:04Z,"Working 100% my butt!  This torrent has already been out there.  All the keys posted for vs. 5 releases are bogus, made by lameass lazy crackers who didn't take the time to properly crack the program."
,tommo39,2009-12-17T12:43Z,"THEY DONT KNOW THE 1ST THING ABOUT ""CRACK""!!"
,sudhan,2009-12-20T17:46Z,"The key works fine,But the only thing is that,
They could've used some more intelligence
-like- 
A Key file generator.
Well for now, Download and seed!
It's a good program though."
,borgmedve,2009-12-21T21:12Z,"Activate cFosSpeed using blacklisted key - how to:

New tutorial, this time use WWebserver

0. Install newest version of cFosSpeed.
1. Add to hosts file (path: %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\) these two lines:
CODE
127.0.0.1       www.cfos.de
127.0.0.1       cfos.de
2. Set up (http) server on localhost. In this turorial I used WWebserver.
2a. Download newest version of WWebserver (~ 8,6 MB) from homepage.
2b. Install it: just run setup, and click install (path may be default: C:/WWebserver, but you can change it, of course). Soft start automatically, do not close.
2c. Add blacklist.txt file to WWebserver folder. blacklist.txt should include:
CODE
[banned]
2d. WWebserver: now just click ""Start"".
3. Try activate cFosSpeed now. Enjoy.
2e. Stop WWebserver. Uninstall it.
4. Remove new (added) lines from hosts file.
5. Reboot computer.
6. Should works fine, tested."
,I3lackDragon,2009-12-24T00:30Z,"And then, I can delete the ""two lines"" added from the host file?

And unninstal WWebserver?"
,borgmedve,2009-12-26T16:38Z,I3lackDragon: Yes!
,IamMille,2010-01-15T23:20Z,"Download the newest version from cFos website instead!

Then use the trick mentioned earlier in the comments by borgmedve!

Works for me on Win7!"
,gadgetpal,2010-01-26T04:35Z,"This torrent works..just follow the guide above. It works on my win7. There is 2 keys given, use either one of them

Note: How this works is that the method creates a webserver on your own computer, so when the key tries to register itself, Cfosspeed can't blacklist it because the information doesn't gets there. After you have registered the key, you can uninstall the webserver and also removed the 2 entries in the HOST file.

More Help
You need to use notepad to create the blacklist.txt file and just add in [banned]. Remember when you look at the file, it should show blacklist and not blacklist.txt

Look inside the torrent under folder blacklist2 and there is a bunch of pictures showing screenshots of the various procedures. Just figure it out.

This one works better than the few torrents using trial reset key, at least no more annoying notificaiton."
