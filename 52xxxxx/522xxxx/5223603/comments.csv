,tommcd,2009-12-17T07:18Z,Thanks for uploading this so soon after the show was on TV. I'm still downloading it as I write this. I hope people will continue to seed this. I will. 
,k3nd00d,2009-12-17T08:41Z,"No problem. It was the best and most focussed episode yet, The only way it could have been better would have been to go into the vision of the ""new green age"" that is being worked toward. But, that might have taken too much time and been to fantastic for people to consider versus how Jesse handled it."
,DeltaPan,2009-12-17T10:42Z,"Actually it's a load of tosh, Ventura is simply using this to make some money and just recycling the usual nonsense whilst trying to say as ex governor he has more access and intel', utter balderdash.

Most of what was said in the first two was mainstream conspiracy theory, there may be elements of truth in them but so much detritus has merged with elements of substance so compelling people to bark up wrong trees as they wade through muddy waters.

I'm downloading this more to have a laugh but i surmise the detritus likely to be said regards climate change will be sorely irksome, not humourous as that is one of the most important issues we face and is not a conspiracy in the slightest.

There's some things which are not explained in this world, this is very true, but be careful of theories and in this, check what is exampled as corroborating science, when you do check and understand what you are being shown in the 'entertainment show', you'll realise you are in fact being misled and pulled in with intregue with little substance.

Don't let others do your thinking for you, be a sceptic and check things out.


Peace. : )"
,k3nd00d,2009-12-17T10:45Z,"Yes, do not let others do your thinking for you. Other than that, deltaPan...go stuff it."
,DeltaPan,2009-12-17T11:22Z,"No worries chap. Thanks for the upload anyways.

Peace. : )"
,aelfred,2009-12-17T15:09Z,"k3nd00d ty.

Just to add there is no conspiracy surrounding climate change. Its a fact. There is though conspiracy about whether it is man made. I do not think it is man made. For me its weather goes in cycles in the middle ages there was a mini ice age (fact). 

I will watch this with interest because all information is good information you make of it what you will. Thanks for the upload."
,begemot.,2009-12-17T16:14Z,"Geniusly!
I'm just applauding to this Great Exposing video!
Jessy and all his team, Bravo!!!

I'm sad about the fact that here in Russia we can't show such powerful things on TV -- ""freedom of speech"" is just a ""election point""..."
,DeltaPan,2009-12-17T17:11Z,"@selfred.

I would suggest it is both, the cyclic nature of the planet as well as galaxy and our transit through the density wave which is not given to constants but perturbations and variances in gravitational influences which has influenced our planet since the solar system was infant in 250 million year cycles and the 26,000-52,000 year cycles, exacerbated by what our species has output in 100 odd years on a rising curve in addition to the natural balance in atmospheric gasses and altering layers etc which has created imbalance to what should be, so accelerating natural phenomenon which lurches nature violently rather than slower adjusting and giving life little time to adapt.

Peace bruv.

,-SPQR-,2009-12-17T22:18Z,thanks for this. and so quick. I am curious
,SerSpec-V,2009-12-18T03:20Z,Thanks! Jesse is awesome.
,the3Dman,2009-12-18T16:13Z,"I've learned about this, have researched alot on the web, and maybe this will help wake up the couch potatos to what is going on.  This torrent will remain active on my PC until the government gets rid of it.
CO2?  This is plant food and some scientists believe dropping a little bit will affect our O2 from the plants of the world.  Polor bears?  Their populations are growing.  DDT?  Harmless  and the greenie weenies gained huge power gains by getting the regulations.  Also, many deaths in 3rd world countries just because it couldn't be used.  Loss of ICE?  Antartica is gaining.  1970s Global Cooling? Farce  2000's Global Warming?  Same people as the 70s and they now have to call the lie ""Climate Change"".   

Glen Beck...part of the story
Jim Quinn at the War Room...another part
Rush Limbaugh..the politics part in the U.S.
Alex Jones...I'm still trying to sort him out, but what information can be gained from him!!!!
Internet:
The Illuminati
Bildenberg Group
Council on Foreign Relations
One World Order
New World Order
Progressives/Liberals/etc
Obama ????
Health Car ????
Cap & Tax ???
The corruption is Washington ???
The 2 politcal parties in ""too much agreement""??
All of these parts build a very interlinked picture."
,cactuspete,2009-12-19T02:14Z,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

I depend on you to be my download source for this great series.  Don't know what I'd do without people like you who will actually record these programs live!  Great job!!!"
,thamask21,2009-12-19T04:47Z,good job on the UL with this
,DJGreenleaf,2009-12-19T07:30Z,"Thanks a lot for posting this up, k3nd00d.
All the links elsewhere where dead, so I'm grateful you put this up."
,victortango,2009-12-19T10:00Z,"Global Warming is a Fact! Man's involvement in global warming is a fact! These facts are undeniable. 

What is disputed is to what extent man-made-warming is contributing to the earth's warming. Are we pushing ourselves into a man-made warming cycle that will cause irreparable harm? This is what is up for debate. 

I look at it this way... can we afford to be wrong? Gambling with the earths ecosystem by pouring out billions of tonnes of pollutants seems a risky proposition. If you can conserve you SHOULD conserve. It's only logical. The earth does not have infinite resources, nor is the earth an infinite trash can. "
,k3nd00d,2009-12-19T14:01Z,"You're welcome to thpse that thanked me.

To victortango,
Man-made global warming is a lie. If you want to conserve, increase efficiency, use alternate power sources, not pollute, GREAT! But none of that has to do with CO2. CO2 is an invisible boogey man these liars are using to tax and control all humans on the planet. If they say you are doing something that puts off too much CO2, can you prove them wrong? No. It is a scam so the control freaks in government can tax and control everyone however they wish.

Why can't people like you quit living in la-la land? I mean come on! Our planet would be better off without really cold winters too, in my opinion. Should we get rid of them? If you have any clue about the global warming issue you would also know that CO2 continues to rise and yet the global temperatures stopped going up in 1998 and we cooled a little since then and on average have a 0 degree change for the past 10 years. That is in an official report called ""State of the climate 2008"".

http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2008/ann/bams/full-report.pdf

See page 24 in the first column about half way down. for this:

""The trend after remov-
ing ENSO (the ""ENSO-adjusted"" 
trend) is 0.00°±0.05°C decade?1, 
implying much greater disagree-
ment with anticipated global tem-
perature rise.""

ENS0 is the El Nino and La Nina oscillation. So when that is taken out of the readings, the temperature change over the past 10 years has been 0 degrees.

Also see page 23 and look at the graphs and trend lines."
,enemy2k,2009-12-20T08:21Z,"hey k3nd00d! Thanks for the upload man, I hope you continue to UL Jesse's show. I don't know what to believe about global warming. I do know the for and against sides BOTH have things to gain regardless if they are for or against it."
,enemy2k,2009-12-20T08:32Z,"BTW Choosing the year 1998 does not prove global warming stopped in 98.

The warmth in 1998 was elevated FAR above the trend line because 1998 was the year of the strongest El Nino of the CENTURY. Choosing that year as a starting point is a classic cherry pick."
,enemy2k,2009-12-20T08:34Z,"""It has stopped warming"" is only supported by selecting a single year out of context and using a seven-year window to look at multi-decadal trends in climate. That's a classic cherry pick."
,k3nd00d,2009-12-20T10:19Z,"No, it is not. How else would you show we have stopped warming? If you want to put it all into a larger context, go for it. The people who try to say we are warming mor and faster and higher than ever before are cherry picking start points. If you look at a very long temperature graph of Earth's temperatures you see that we are coming out of an ice age and where we are is not abnormal at all. Firstly, the modern day warming began BEFORE the industrial age (unlike what the pushers of AGW say). Secondly, the most famous graphs used to show that we are heating up faster and higher than ever is a graph using bad and fudged (in their own words) data to make the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age both flatten out to make the past 2o years look abnormally warm. The truth is that it was warmer during the Medieval Warm Period than it is now. "
,k3nd00d,2009-12-20T10:25Z,"This idea that both sides have something to gain is bull. Shell Oil is a huge funder of the man-made global warming side, as is BP, and the big energy companies have a LOT to gain by making the world believe that they should use less oil and should pay a lot more for it. This allows big oil to continue on making huge profits while they pay to pollute through Cap and Trade. Some call it Cap and Tax. Do you know why? Are you smart enough to know why? Because it will not harm big oil to make them have to pay to pollute, iit will only hurt the average person because prices will go up for everything and big oil will still make huge profits. It is a scam and the people behind it write about it and have speeches about it if you are not too blinded by the propaganda to go look. "
,k3nd00d,2009-12-20T10:27Z,"A lot of this information is being put up on y-o-u-t-u-b-e by people. Search y-o-u-t-u-b-e for things like this: Maurice Strong, John Hunt, Rio Earth Summit, Agenda 21, Earth Charter, UNCED, Population Control, Asch Experiment, conformity, Club of Rome, etc."
,enemy2k,2009-12-22T03:06Z,"No it is not bull. The status quo (doing nothing) will keep the big oil companies in power, keep polluting and keep making money off our addiction to oil. While the companies who wanna make money off alternate energies stand to make money if we switch to alternate energy. So they BOTH have things to gain."
,enemy2k,2009-12-22T03:10Z,"Propaganda goes BOTH ways. Both sides in whatever the argument is will have their own propaganda, it has always been that way and will continue to be that way."
,enemy2k,2009-12-22T03:11Z,"Also, I asked before but will you continue to upload this show? I think it is a good show to make us think and ask questions. I hope you will keep putting it up for all of us please!"
,thomasanderson911,2009-12-22T21:48Z,"enemy2k, big oil wants you to believe they are against the AGW agenda. Stop being fooled and wake up!!!"

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5218472/BBC-Sex.Spying.Conspiracy_(PBS.Discovery.History.Channel.Theory)

Watch and see how the government is tapping your phone calls, reading your emails, and creating databases of everything about you. Companies get paid by the government to collect info on all of us. All the purchases we make. The spouse we might have or what kind of pets we have, or even our favorite color. Here we have an ex CEO of the company talking about all this. Watch as you see how some companies monitor all their employees even while they are away from work! Finally the video shows the infamous NSA and how more than 20,000 people working each day listen to your phone calls. Hear ex employees talking about it. The sources are from MSNBC, Discovery Channel, and History Channel along with others. Not only is this evidence but it comes from high sources and it takes you right to the heart of where this is all happening. "

,k3nd00d,2010-02-13T11:32Z,"Pastafarian101,
So, you have faith in the AGW propaganda? You must, since each week it is being shown more and more that the theory lack any scientific basis. If you care to debate about this, let me know."
,k3nd00d,2010-02-13T11:55Z,"Note how so much of the supposed settled AGW science has now been proven to not be science but based on WWF propaganda, hiking magazine articles, telephone interview statements known to be spurious, student papers and intentionally fudged math. If you want to know these details, let me know. I know a web radio show that has covered the MSM news coverage about this coming from the top UK online newspapers...or search for yourself.

I suspect new AGW counter propaganda videos on you-tube likely have been covering this too. Not like you can expect our US controlled media to cover it and with honesty. Even the GOP news channel (fox) is not adequately doing so. But then its owner (Rupert Murdoch) also owns AGW theory fraud friendly media in other countries (making fox what is known as ""controlled opposition"")."
