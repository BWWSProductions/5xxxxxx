I hate to break it to you, but adding your name in a song you didn't even bother remixing at all doesn't make you a DJ it makes you a sad wannabe fool.

Fucking listening to this and all of a sudden some voice goes ""DJ Finesse"" it's fucking annoying, sad, and if you do have a job DJing somewhere it must be the worst place ever to hire a DJ like this."
