Robert De Niro teams with director Martin Scorsese in this 
extraordinarily compelling (Leonard Maltin) film that introduced
unflinching realism to stunned audiences in 1980. An exceedingly
violent as well as poetic figtht picture that maps the landscape
of the soul. Raging Bull garnered eight Oscar nominations and won
two including Best Actor for De Niro.

De Niro gives the performance of his career as Jake La Motta, a boxer
whose psychological and sexual complexities erupt into violence both
in and out of the ring. Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty are unforgettable
as the brother who fall prey to Jakes mounting paranoia and jealousy 
and the fifteen year old girl who becomes his most prized trophy. A
brilliantly photographed film of extraordinary power and rare distinction.
