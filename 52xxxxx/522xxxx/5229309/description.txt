At Her Very Best - Nana Mouskouri [2001]

Jose F. Promis, All Music Guide All Music Guide - The task of compiling a single-disc best-of collection for legendary Greek chanteuse Nana Mouskouri is virtually impossible, but this 21-track retrospective, spanning the singer's career and incorporating a range of musical styles, is an excellent introduction for the novice or casual fan. For the collector, it offers two rarities: her version of "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" (in English) and her duet with Michel Legrand, "Quand on S'Aime." From the song that made her famous ("The White Rose of Athens") to French opera (Carmen's "Habanera"), the array of musical styles (and languages) this woman has conquered is staggering. This disc, which includes pop songs ("Bridge Over Troubled Water"), gospel ("Oh Happy Day"), and classics ("Ave Maria"), brings the songs together seamlessly -- it's difficult to imagine that these recordings span nearly 40 years. Despite a serious lack of liner notes, this single-disc compilation is a definite treat, and a wonderful introduction to one of the most famous singers the world has known. 

Amazon.com Review By A Customer - This compilation contains 21 of her most beautiful songs, mostly in English, although it also has 3 songs in French (Bizet's "Habanera", Nana's first- rate version of "Plaisir d'amour" and a very jazzy 1965 duet with French composer Michel Legrand, "Quand on s'aime"),one in Spanish ("En Aranjuez con mi amor"), one in Greek (the predictable "Ta Pedia Tou Pirea") and Schubert's "Ave Maria" in Latin, of course. The album spans Nana's European and American career from 1962 to 1999 and displays a stupendously broad variety of styles, from romantic hits ("Only Love", "The White Rose of Athens", "Try to remember") to impecable covers of Simon&Garfunkel songs ("Bridge Over Troubled Water", "Scarborough Fair Canticle") to cross-over classical choice- morsels ("Song for Liberty" from Verdi's "Nabucco","Fields of Love", adapted from Offenbach's "Tales of Hoffmann", etc.) to Gospel ("Oh Happy Day") and, last but not least,...a marvellous version of "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes" recorded by Nana in New York in 1962 under the supervision of Quincy Jones. "Easy listening" is the vaguely condescending label used to describe Nana's songs, but her stupendous eclecticism is anything but spurious or facile, while her classically-trained voice certainly ought to command respect for its unusual depth and flexibility. "At her Very Best" for the past 40 years with 200 million records sold all over the world,... a feat rarely achieved in the world of pop-music!
