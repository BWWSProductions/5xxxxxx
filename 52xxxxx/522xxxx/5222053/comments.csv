,glavia,2009-12-18T06:37Z,Works fine.  Using Vista I just ran it in compatibility for XP SP2 and that cleared up any problems I encountered.  Thanks!
,nedswife,2009-12-31T03:49Z,"I was just coming here to say that I couldn't get this prog to run, then I saw Glavia's comment.  i changed the compatability to Xp sp2, it still wouldn't run, so i checked the box ""run as administrator"" and it all works fine!  Hope this helps others.  THANKS to Duwan, and thanks to Glavia for the tip!!!!!  I learned something new today :D"
