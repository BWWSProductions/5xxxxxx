,IamDUFF,2010-10-13T03:41Z,"For this, it won't play. I'm running 7 x64bit with Crossfire'd video, on a laptop so i'm sure it's on my end, but if you have any kind of a custom rig that has any problems at all this won't work i'd imagine. Gonna DL the MKV version."
,IamDUFF,2010-10-13T03:45Z,"Sorry for so many comments =( it works fine, it was some settings i messed around with in VLC player, it works fine after i reverted to default settings.
My apologies sir, and thank you very much for the beautiful upload."
