Four talented artists from Southern California come together as Tha Process to bring you their newest ep entitled "Press Play". The cast of this "Underground" Hip-Hop group consists of Kontra, Thawt, Thesis, and Noearth, Los Angeles locals. With their non traditional West-Coast approach "Press Play" leaves you with a feeling inspired by such artists as Atmosphere and Living Legends to Notorious B.I.G. and J Dilla.
