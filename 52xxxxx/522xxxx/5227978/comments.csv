,Terrial,2009-12-20T09:35Z,Can u update this program via live update and not keep having to copy and replace the crack???
[V],kentucky-kid,2009-12-20T10:40Z,"@Terrial

nonsense! this version of mine is pre-cracked. you don't need any cracks or serials for this. just install & it's full version already."
,Hagaren414,2009-12-21T05:21Z,"Works great! My AV stopped the setkey.exe so I disabled it, retried installing and it worked. Great torrent!"
,Terrial,2009-12-21T06:14Z,"Works here too, very recommended program - best Driver Genius Pro out atm... good work kentucky-kid!"
,vespadelus,2009-12-21T12:23Z,"Downloaded - installed - scanned - found 28 driver updates in 10 driver packages (wow, I thought most of my drivers were up to date, anyway) tried to download new drivers via ""Driver Headquater"" and 9 out of 10 failed to download. Either Driver Genius isn't genius or something is wrong with the cracked program! Apart from this rather BIG issue, it works fine...."

,pompomboy,2010-01-26T07:44Z,"Warning : Avast detect virus in C/Program Files/Driver Genius/SetKey.exe. Otherwise this program is helpless, it's better to find the driver on internet rather to use these kind of program. For example, with realtek driver (audio) Driver Genius will find a driver but not the one for your system - Driver Genius has nothing to do with ""Genius""."
