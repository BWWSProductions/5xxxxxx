Science and Islam (2009)
1of3

Physicist Jameel Al-Khalili takes a personal journey into a largely forgotten era, travelling through Syria, Iran, Tunisia and Spain to tell of the great leap in scientific knowledge that took place in the Islamic world between the 8th and 14th centuries CE.


The Language of Science

Terms like "algebra," "algorithm" and "alkali" are all Arabic in origin and at the very heart of modern science. There would be no modern mathematics or physics without algebra; no computers without algorithms; no chemistry without alkalis. From the great mathematician Al-Khwarizmi to Ibn Sina, whose Canon of Medicine was still in use as recently as the 19th century, Bagdad-born physicist Jameel Al-Khalili pieces together a remarkable story of the often overlooked achievements of the early medieval Islamic scientists.
