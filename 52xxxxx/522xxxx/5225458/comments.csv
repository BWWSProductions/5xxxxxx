What else is required for this religion."

,haddouche,2012-03-15T23:47Z,"The prophet Mohammed (PBUH) married Aisha when she was 9, she was engaged to someone else before that, it sounds weird today because traditions has changed, it wasn’t unusual at those days, he wasn’t the first to do it, such marriages happened before him and even after him, my friend’s grandmother was married at 10!!.  
 You are lying when you try making it look like a rape, her father Abu-Bakr was the best companion to the prophet Mohammed (PBUH), and he became the first calif in islam, among his wives, the prophet Mohammed loved Aisha the most, she loved him more than anyone else, a lot of Hadiths in the Boukhârî book talking about this, so don’t believe what you like. 
“He also had sex with a dead woman…..he also ***** his daughter in law….”
Shame on you to tell such lies that have never been told about the prophet Mohammed 
(PBUH), next time at least be respectful when you lie. 	"
