Author Notes
Most of these files are in either AVI, MPEG, or WMV format.  They are not DVD version, all though some of them are DVD rips.  This is a collection of past and current documentaries presenting alternative up-to-date news.  They are some of what I consider to be the most important and most informative documentaries on issues that are rarely discussed.  These are data discs, meaning that you can only run them on your PC.  You may use a conversion program (listed below) in order to convert them to DVD format if you wish.  All I ask is that you redistribute these discs freely to as many as you can afford, for as you probably already know, time is of the essence.  Please make note of and watch CODEX ALIMENTARIUS by Ian Cane firstly.  Also, FOOD INC., CHEMTRAIL FILMS, and WORLD ACCORDING TO MONSANTO are others to take note of.  This agenda has been around for years, but is just now being put into place, and it is very important for everyone, everywhere to understand all of this.  I have placed the files into separate discs and separate downloads, however, you may choose to download them all at once if you wish.  The above listed documentaries may not necessarily be on the current disc/download you have.  All of these files can be found at isohunt.com as well as others under the search terms NWO 2009 UP-TO-DATE. Enjoy, and again please redistribute freely.
