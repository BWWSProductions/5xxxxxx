first of all the original uploader said to keep the upload file intact just to only change the uploaded by name... and no this is modified from the original version that was upped. the .iwd files in main were not able to be extracted by windows 7 so i took them from the official CoD install. also it has maps that were not originally there. not all of them but it has maybe 6 maps i think there and the original up had only 1... dont get all pissy just because i got this working and want to share with others... i am following the forum rules this originally came from and i am including a link to this on the site..."
,cvydas,2009-12-18T05:08Z,why the hell would you post it as 1 file? goddamn! next time have them seperated so you can download which files you might only need.
,sk8rcat123,2009-12-18T05:21Z,this is my first up so i'm not sure on how to include multiple files. it has everything included to run... and no it is not a virus i will post scan results later because i have norton 2010 and it detects nothing wrong with this
,sk8rcat123,2009-12-18T14:08Z,"here are the antivirus reports from norton:

When I click single player on the multiplayer menu it just crashes. Please help!!!"
,Gaisle,2010-02-13T01:31Z,How large is this after installed?

,Slurgly,2010-06-12T23:27Z,"Very nice DL speed, however, I'm having serious issues getting the game to actually play. I have the same issue as animal2238. I can only load multiplayer that doesn't work. I edited and added the registry thing, and tried to install Punkbuster. Still, nothing worked."
