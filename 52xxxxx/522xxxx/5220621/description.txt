Jazz trumpeter, composer, and even author Wynton Marsalis has been wowing audiences with his style and creativity since he began performing with the New Orleans Philharmonic at the tender age of 14. At the same time, he played trumpet in a funk band, just to be able to play the trumpet in front of more people.

On this lens, I'll write about why I love Wynton Marsalis's music, how I came to love the sound of the trumpet, give album recommendations, and ask for your feedback on jazz, classical music, Mr. Marsalis, and the instruments and musical styles that you love. If you have questions, feel like I've missed something, or have your own story to share, please jump down to the guest book and type away. I look forward to hearfing from you!
