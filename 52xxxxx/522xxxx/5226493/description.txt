Argus is a superhero who first appeared during the Bloodlines crossover event in Flash Annual v2, #6 (1993), and was created by Mark Waid and Phil Hester.

Whilst investigating one of Keystone City's criminal organisations using the alias "Nick Kovac", federal agent Nick Kelly was attacked by a Bloodlines Parasite named Venev. Kelly gained the ability to become totally invisible in shadow and to see far beyond the normal spectrum in microwaves and infrared.

He later works with the Flash when Central City is attacked by weapons satellites. He would work with the Blood Pack, a team of superheroes formed out of the survivors of the alien attacks.
