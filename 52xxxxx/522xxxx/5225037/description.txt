Jpcsp â€“ Java PSP Emulator

Jpcsp is a PlayStation Portable emulator for PC, started by shadow (the same great 
person that made  PCSX & PCSX2)  and joined by a great team.
Jpcsp is the first psp emulator written in java, allows to play your psp games on a PC
Whatâ€™s new on v0.3?
â€¢ Itâ€™s Jpcspâ€™s birthday!! Happy birthday JpcspïŠ
â€¢ A huge improvement in CPU/FPU/VFPU added and fixed a considerable 
instructions which make things better.
â€¢ v0.3 is 50% faster than v0.2 ïŠ.
â€¢ Fixed a lot of issues and bugs ( in compiler, loader, memoryâ€¦etc).
â€¢ Better fake Mpeg.
â€¢ Improved and fixed a lot of modules like sceUmdâ€¦etc, and other HLE stuffs 
which make a lot of games are running or even playable.
â€¢ Improved graphics in VideoEngine and pspdislay, fixed compressed textures, 
textures cache, and also 2D & 3D (yeah we have 3D ïŠ).
â€¢ Added special settings for more compatibility and speed.
How it works:
â€¢ First you need to install JRE (Java Runtime Environement).
â€¢ Put your iso/cso in â€œumdimagesâ€ folder, and your homebrews/demos in â€œms0/
PSP/GAMEâ€.
You can find the saves in â€œms0/PSP/SAVEDATAâ€.
Note: only ISO and CSO are suported for commercial games!!and pbp/elf for 
demos.
â€¢ To lunch Jpcsp click on â€œJpcsp.jarâ€ or you can run it from a batch file using â€œ 
java -Xmx512m -jar "Jpcsp.jar" â€ you can also use Xmx1024m if you have 
more than 2bg of memory ;-)
â€¢ To load & play a gme do: click on file and choose â€œLoad UMDâ€ now you will 
see a window (â€œUMD iso/cso Browserâ€) choose a game and press â€œLoadâ€, 
then press â€œRunâ€ and be happy :p. 
â€¢ For homebrews/demos choose â€œLoad MemStickâ€â€¦
â€¢ In â€œOptionsâ€ you will see some special hacks, they helps to improve 
compatibility and speed, play with those hack to find a good stability for each 
game you are trying (not all games uses the same hacks :p). 
â€¢ To get more speed enable â€œOnly GE graphicsâ€ in â€œOptionsâ€ and disable the 
logger (in Logger change log level to â€œOFFâ€).
â€¢ Jpcsp is using HLE (High Level Emulation), the team chosen it for speed and 
a good compatibility instead of LLE which is really slow compared to HLE especially with Java, plus we havenâ€™t enough infos about hardware and 
firmwareïŒ to handle all the hardware at low level.
