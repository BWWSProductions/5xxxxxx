,Demon_661987,2009-12-31T01:47Z,"please seed when finished all.  most of my torrents are in need of seeders.  I seed as much as I can and overnight central time USA.  But once I see some seeders, I expect that you will help seed and not just take the info and remove it.  Please help me and others to spread this information.  Also please see my latest post ""Rima Laibow - Codex Alimentarius Complete.""  I forgot about this one and it was left out of this release, so please be sure to download it to at one of my pages:

If you guys just want to leech, go buy the thing and hoard it to your selves, but if you're getting it for free, share the joy :P"
,jared-156,2011-12-18T18:00Z,The audio for episode one is off a little bit.  I haven't watched any of the other episodes yet so I'm not sure if they are too.  Other than that it's a good upload.
