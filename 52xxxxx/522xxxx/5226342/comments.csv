Req: Imagine Simulation Atlanta for FSX."
,DeeDeeEs1,2009-12-19T21:54Z,"My FSX files for the Beech Duke are installed and working on ""D:\Flight Simulator X""
However, I am not able to get the update to install. I have followed the directions and made the change as instructed. Does anyone else experience this? Any further direction?"
,aarque,2009-12-20T00:16Z,"DD I wouldn't fret over it too much. If you ask me, it is one of those updates that tries to get piraters to buy the thing, either that or the update works only for Xp users with the very most basic install path, cause I tried many ways to jig the registry modification to allow the update. (I run Vista64 with my install path as E:\FSX). Anyway, decide for yourself, this from the RealAir site:

""This update adds a number of new features to the Duke and resolves a few minor issues. The major changes are as follows:

? Mousewheel support added.
? Optional left-click/right-click mouse interaction.
? Improved VC camera system.
? Optional Reality XP GNS WAAS 530/430 VC panel integration.
? Improved support for advanced hardware input devices.
? More user selectable options in the Config Panel.""

yawn."
,DeeDeeEs1,2009-12-20T00:34Z,Thanks for the insight aarque. I am using Win-7 64bit. The mouse-wheel interaction in the update is a huge draw for me. Having to repeatedly click-drag the controls just to change avionics in current release is a real pain.
,aarque,2009-12-20T06:39Z,"WTF? minus 1??? Who ticked that? Speak up you ungrateful bastard, all the comments are positive or neutral. Was it you futuredood?

I was gonna upload the Alphasim C-17 but now I think I'll just take my ball and go home..."

,PROSTOPROSIRENO,2010-03-05T15:43Z,"Do not panic. ACFT is perfect but the whole program is really CRAP. I spent a money, install this shit, and lights are not working. Active Sky Evolution also installed. After reinstalation of Duke I can not install 1.5 update, because of error installing some folder. I got Redux Lights to do some light at this ACFT but everything except flying is bullshit. GET SOME CRACK DO NOT BUY THIS"
,PROSTOPROSIRENO,2010-03-05T15:45Z,"Sorry I forgot
Win7, everything other works perfect, other ACFT also"
