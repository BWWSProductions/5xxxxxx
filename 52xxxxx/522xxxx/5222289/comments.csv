,Biglia05,2009-12-16T20:32Z,Do I need the (Reloaded?) 1.01 patch for this?
[V],gansuk,2009-12-17T00:15Z,nope latest patch files are included
,Anthony506,2009-12-17T00:27Z,Is there anywhere where i can download just the files that where missing out of the original download of this file? Im near getting capped and would rather download the 25mb missing files than download the whole thing again.
,delight99,2009-12-17T04:47Z,"does it includes the latest 1.1.0 patch?

,CADETbrazil,2009-12-18T02:44Z,"Didnt work to me, I followed the instructions, the game crashed at beginning and I had to reinstall the whole game twice. No install file with the repack?"
,Proudestmikey,2009-12-18T17:29Z,".DLL error for me, can't get it to run. my directx is updated & everything is fine, I don't get it..."
,naabhi,2009-12-22T20:29Z,"thomas dollar how did u run the dlc?? i keep getting the same online 'buy' problem that u initially had.
please reply"
,naabhi,2009-12-22T20:30Z,please someone help.
,Halfbrother,2009-12-24T00:06Z,"dude fail naabhi thats not a problem.. you just didnt install the crack rofl...  when you download the game you install the crack contents into bineries... and for this you install the files and replace bineries,engine,willow games but it doesnt replace all contents"
,reinku,2010-01-11T02:30Z,"Okay I guess I'm stupid. I extract bl.Dr.Ned.arc  to C:/Program Files/2k Games/Gearbox Software/Borderlands, and then I click ~repack~, and it sits for maybe half a second and then ~repack~, Dearc.dll, and the .arc file all disappear. When I boot up Borderlands, the DLC hasn't been installed. What is happening here?"
,reinku,2010-01-11T02:37Z,"Extracting to the Borderlands/Binaries folder made the process displayed in cmd last a lot longer, a minute or so, but same result: no DLC installed in-game."
,DevaXXL,2010-01-11T17:51Z,"The new DLC is out! Pls upload it! 
Thanks in advance! "
[V],gansuk,2010-01-12T17:18Z,"you can download the new dlc from www kaoskrew org, tpb seem to have uploading issues atm."

,daneroverg,2010-04-13T06:29Z,"I noticed that ""Foreign Streams"" have been ripped from this. What exactly is that?"
,Ezlin,2010-04-19T00:24Z,"@daneroverg

,anishrestha,2010-08-27T04:51Z,"guyz,please seed........i am trying to download since yesterday....."
