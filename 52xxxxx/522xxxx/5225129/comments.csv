,waya-waya,2009-12-24T00:11Z,"You have to unpack it first. Download 7zip and install it, then right click on the .rar file, and tell it to 7zip unpack."
,cenzo6945,2009-12-24T05:48Z,How do i use only the spanish audio and mute the english? Thanks for the torrent Fugig! 
,cenzo6945,2009-12-24T05:52Z,"More importantly, if i wanted to burn it, how do i burn just the spanish audio?"
,lilleogal,2009-12-31T19:25Z,i finished downloading it but I can only see the sample videos. The rest are divided into parts and all scrambled. They don't play. Please help.  
,lilleogal,2009-12-31T20:12Z,never I was able to unzip it using 7zip. But how can I make it only in English. I understand spanish but this keeps changing back and forth in spanish and english so I just want consistency. Anyhow my english is much better than spanish. Please help

,Kyk3,2010-01-02T00:36Z,How Do You stop both languages from playing at once??? if its good how do i vote for you to be trusted???
,rustydanielle,2010-01-03T01:52Z,"I agree with others, How the heck do you only play english?   or do you have to hear both languages at the same time?
if so this is not a very good download! I was all excited, I hope it works!"
,legenddj,2010-01-06T00:04Z,before you unpack rar files just delete spanish audio file
