,LorenzoJuarez,2009-12-20T06:24Z,NG.  1 Day Later... App aborts after the 1st update cycle... at least on XP.   I checked the docs all the way back to the original RAR and no mention of any license key.  We need a new crack.  The TurboTax Home + Business 2009 version is the best one to crack.
,Truvbay,2009-12-20T15:45Z,works great!
,Truvbay,2009-12-20T16:18Z,"No problems here. Updated fine, runs fine. On XP SP3 here."
,LorenzoJuarez,2009-12-29T20:15Z,"as it turns out, the problem I am having is a TT new version bug not related to the crack."
,carsnkrak,2010-01-04T07:01Z,"WORKS WIN 7...........all updates work 11/04/2010

no serial or crack damn thats me!!!"
,frndoflegolas,2010-01-05T06:36Z,"I agree with those that say it doesnt work after update.  Uninstall it delete the downloaded files and go buy it.                                    




For rest of us with brains:
it works perfectly even after update (windows 7)"

,ecs1,2010-01-10T07:06Z,Can someone please post the Canadian version for filing 2009 taxes in Canada?
,untrueparadox,2010-01-13T08:52Z,"glad it works. for those of you who need the premier version for special investment and other purposes in tax filing, its also under my username. and i dont think there are enough canadians online to actually have a huge possibility of getting turbotax for ya. i love TT because from years and years ago when they first made their software, they never had DRM. no serials, no activation, no nothing. just install from cd and update. thats all. and year after year, the files import perfectly into the later version."
,yesterdays_pirate,2010-01-20T03:30Z,Works like a charm. No problems whatsoever. Thanks for sharing this file.
,nodrm,2010-01-24T20:05Z,"Thanks for the share but your memory is a little short about Turbotax and DRM, try Googling Turbotax and DRM.

,jaystory9,2010-01-25T23:52Z,Anyone able to efile your state tax for free with this copy?
,ChuutRiit,2010-01-27T09:07Z,"Installed and updated perfectly for me in Win 7 Professional x64. I had multiple state filings so I did the first state with a copy of the d/l, reinstalled a new copy then did the other state. Federal filing is free...states are pay and I'm cheap so I mailed both state filings."
