But please tell me..
can i play this movie on my win XP. ??

,nsap102,2010-01-08T05:46Z,"Thank you Holy Roses!  The quality is terrific.  But I'm having some trouble with the file. I'm not an expert at this sort of stuff, but I'll do my best to describe the problem:

I'm using a PC, WinXP and played the movie on VLC,WinMedia player, and win media playe classic.  Same problem.  The screen size keeps changing.  At the very begining its small, then at 55 secs it's big then at 06:25 it's small again until 2:22 when its big again.  I've played around with the aspect ratio but it's still the same.  Appreciate any solutions you have.

Thank you
"

,Astrograsss,2010-01-26T17:13Z,"Hi HR, liking the quality :-) just a question, i noticed the option of DD5.1 but can only select aac 2ch and cant find a way of changing this (PS3 with cinema kit) id noticed posts earlier about whether or not you can change the channel via the ps3 manually, if so how do i do this, thanks again... "
,Astrograsss,2010-01-26T20:40Z,"after viewing the contents of the m4v file in yamb ive noticed the 6ch sound file is in ac3 format instead of aac, i think this is the reason my ps3 wont pick up the 5.1.. ive tried removing the 2ch aac file then converting the video/ac3 6ch files to mp4 but the ps3 wont play any sound, only the video file....."
,saro9872,2010-02-25T07:17Z,will it play on my dvd player ? coz when i play it on vlc it doesn't play properly.....
,fuckincrazyness,2010-03-10T01:52Z,this wont play on WDTV.  even if you change it to mp4.  it fucked up my hard drive.   and watching it on vlc or something similar the vid is so choppy.  my comptuer aint fast at all. but ive weatched other hd stuff that looks amazing on pc
