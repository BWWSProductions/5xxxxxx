,jjpirie,2009-12-26T00:12Z,"so, preshant22, how about you just PISS RIGHT OFF! It's a BR rip you stupid fool, what do you expect? If you're too cheap to have limited bandwidth, don't download it....there are many people with limited intelligence...."
,.Leto.,2010-01-06T00:13Z,"I totally agree. Most of us now have 22, 24-inch screens. 700mb releases are so compressed, so blurry that they're almost impossible to watch.
I'm not downloading anything below 1280x720 unless I'm really forced to."

,hyeguy123,2010-01-25T01:22Z,"Why is some of the writing in German? For instance, the quote shown in the beginning."
,funnyname,2010-01-30T23:12Z,"there is one hard coded quotation in german at the beginning, and maybe three times "" x days until relief"" (x Tage bis zur Abloesung) is written when a new chapter begins. "
