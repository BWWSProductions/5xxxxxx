,Schizoid1,2010-06-26T04:00Z,I guess it was a shitty year for music. This is pathetic. 
,fuzzybuz,2011-06-10T09:24Z,I'll tell you what's pathetic... it's the audio quality of the majority of these. Not only are most over modulated but why anyone would encode mp3's at nothing less than 320kbs or better yet upload flac's is beyond me :-/  Save yourselves some time and move on.
