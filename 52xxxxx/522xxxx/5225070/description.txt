Synopis: A quirky, low-key naturalistic drama from director Bohdan Slama, Divoke vcely (aka Wild Bees) takes a lingering peek into the quiet lives of the citizens of Northern Moravia. Lonely farmer Kaja (Zdenek Rauser) lives with his father, brother and grandmother on the country farm. Intensely attracted to beautiful grocery clerk Bozhka (Tatiana Vilhelmova), Kaja's advances are eschewed in favor of town Michael Jackson impersonator Lada (Pavel Liska), who also happens to be the father of Bozhka's child. - Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide
