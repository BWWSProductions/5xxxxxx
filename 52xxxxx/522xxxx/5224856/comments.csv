[V],maestral,2010-01-23T14:25Z,"Theres still no official date for this movie on DVD, it will only come out on blueray for now. Theres a good deal od movies on dvd made from blue ray, 6passes, original audio, subs etc. And tjey are better in quality than DVDs when they come out. So if you dont like this one wait for that or original DVD. This one is most decent and one of the best in quality i find around. AND ONLY ONE WITH ENG SUBS.

Thanx BYLAUR"
