I think the sprints are the most interesting type of races in modern xc-skiing. For me, even a sprint quarterfinal is often worth an entire 15 km or 30 km separate-start event..."
,BasilBrush,2009-12-18T23:43Z,I'll do both - the extended 55 minute version will probably cover more of the heats. You can never trust Eurosport anyway - their programmes can start 15 minutes before the alloted time and they sometimes swap to other events in mid stream - I suppose that's the problem with live sports when they have only 2 channels.

The live programme was 60 minutes, not 45 minutes as reported by Digibuide."

Yeah, I know... :(

I agree, but, you know, with today's sport being as media-oriented as it is, they could somehow try to schedule the events so that not more than two of them overlap...

Thank you once again for the sprints and the entire xc-skiing season!"
