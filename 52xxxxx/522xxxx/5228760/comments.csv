,mrvain32,2010-01-16T23:38Z,"Its great what you're doing here...

But for a beginner who's got no idea how to take these tutorials in a step by step manner,what about them? how would they download?

For ex ""lynda's one on one"" has atleast 3 volumes but there's no categorizing in your torrent. Like - ""lynda one on one Vol 1 ..."" ""lynda one on one Vol 2..."" & so on. Cos people like me who are unaware of these thing have no clue which one should we first download.These are all zipped file afterall.

Similarly if a set has many volumes to it pls name it serially so that we can track it properly. Frankly I'm lost looking at these marvelous uploads of yours. Cos I don't know which one should I download first.

That doesn't take away my regards to your fine uploads. The best in pirate bay but even the best can improve. Pls don't take this in a wrong way. Its like I've found a treasure but I don't understand the currency.

My respects..."
