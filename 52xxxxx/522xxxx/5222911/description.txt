Okay guys and girls (i hope some girls play this AWESOME game ), this is the Wipeout 2097 that i bought here in France, it's PAL but you don't give Ã  damn, ePSXe can handle any format. The CD was almost dead (scratches and some kicks on the boot sector) but alcohol managed to create an image in almost 40 minutes. No errors at all. It's the full game, not a damn rip without music, that's why it's soo large but hey, you'll be playing a damn adrenaline rush for free !! Never tried to drink Red Bull before playing this game, so if YOU try, please post feedback here
