,sacredxmaiden,2009-12-21T10:01Z,anything about this game? x_x?
,Ordeal,2009-12-21T11:36Z,"As far as I know there's no such thing as a Harvest Moon game for the PC, unless it's through a console emulator, which it apparently isn't since it says ""PC-Game"" in the title.. And seeing how it's an .exe file you've uploaded which is not even 2mb in size makes it all even more suspicious.."
,snotrocket,2010-02-14T09:10Z,"there is a version of harvest moon for PC, actually. i'm not sure about the size, though. 1.6 does seem small, though i don't think the game is all that huge..."
,Paragon_FX,2010-02-19T14:54Z,"I downloading it now. As soon as i finish i tell u guys how is the result. 

Be nice to me dragon9000, hope it doesn't have any virus or other hanky panky, spike or whatsoever. "

,Khihuahua,2010-05-10T23:12Z,"ok, there is no response weather it has a virus, if it works, or what, im gonna download it, it will take 3 secs, and i will update things"
,Khihuahua,2010-05-10T23:14Z,"there is no seeders, so i cant tell weather it is a virus or not"
,rey78,2010-12-04T05:58Z,"its clearly a virus, there's no such thing as Harvest moon for PC and there is no console game that is 1.61 mg it would've been believable if it was 1.61 gb, can ya just use your heads every now and then? >_"
