,byucougs,2009-12-19T18:41Z,"Am I an idiot, or wasn't this torrent labeled Tinker Bell originally? I downloaded it as such awhile back?"
,LadyOfThe80s,2009-12-20T01:18Z,"Well, sadly I must say it doesn't have Spanish audio, thanks anyway"
[T],hjsn1,2009-12-20T18:17Z,"byucougs: Maybe.

LadyOfThe80s: Sorry about that, it said it had spanish audio on a website I use and it has been accurate for a while now but I guess i'm gonna go back to what I was doing before and not rely on that site for that information."
,byucougs,2009-12-20T19:35Z,"Was that ""maybe I am an idiot"" or ""maybe it was mislabeled"".  I just want to make sure I am not losing my mind... :-)"
[T],hjsn1,2009-12-21T15:45Z,"byucougs: It was labeled Tinkerbell but before anyone noticed I put up Taps also so I deleted the ""Tinkerbell""."
