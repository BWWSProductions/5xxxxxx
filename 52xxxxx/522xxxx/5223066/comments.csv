You can activate your Copy of Windows-7 as your need.. This crack ables you to activate your Trial windows 7 to OEM version of many companies i.e Intel, Lenovo , Dell, Acer & many more..."
,DashBlacK,2009-12-18T04:11Z,Yo Smartass crazzy_DG this version is preactivated and u don't have to download it if you don't want to. stop spamming people's torrents and keep ur ideas to urself.
,DashBlacK,2009-12-18T04:13Z,and plus this is available forever unlike the one in your link and this is full version.
,DashBlacK,2009-12-18T05:51Z,"This is the original TOSHIBA OEM. It contains the TOSHIBA oobe, agreements, and all that shit. You can't get that out of an activator."
,siddhu93,2009-12-19T02:39Z,is it ultimate?please reply .thanks
,DashBlacK,2009-12-19T05:28Z,"it has all versions. Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium and Ultimate. it is an AiO Disc."
,siddhu93,2009-12-19T11:01Z,is this untouched toshiba disk or it is activated by using loader?thank you
,DashBlacK,2009-12-20T18:03Z,"If u have SLIC 2.1 in your bios, it will activate with ceritificate from TOSHIBA. Yes, it is untouched."
,siddhu93,2009-12-21T12:35Z,hey thankyou for your reply.what is grmculfrer_en_dvd?this one is activated with the leaked keys and these are blacklisted by microsoft.this grmculfrer dvd is released even before the release of windows 7 and this one is surely touched.this is not original toshiba disk.
,DashBlacK,2009-12-22T03:45Z,"Siddhu bhai, i have made this version myself by integrating an untouched retail version of windows 7 with the TOSHIBA Keys, Certificates and the OOBE. So you don't have to worry about the key being blacklisted because it is the real TOSHIBA OEM Key and it automatically gets activated when you start your computer for the first time. So this version will already be activated before you even know that Microsoft has found out. AND A TIP FOR YOU ****YOU CAN'T ACTIVATE WINDOWS 7 FROM ONLY A KEY WITHOUT GOING ONLINE!! THIS VERSION GETS ACTIVATED FROM THE SLIC2.1 IN YOUR BIOS AND THE TOSHIBA CERTIFICATE THAT COMES WITH NEW TOSHIBA COMPUTERS(WITH WINDOWS 7)**** HOPE THAT HELPS!"
,vragec111,2009-12-22T13:06Z,"is it possible to use on HP Compaq 610?
:(
can't find a working win7..."
,DashBlacK,2009-12-24T12:55Z,"yeah...it's possible to use and install, but it won't activate!"
,CarribeanPirateUser,2009-12-27T13:09Z,"I've downloaded and installed the Windows and I have a few questions.
1) You say this is pre-activated - why does it still ask me for a key during installation?
2) Do I burn the language pack and the applications on 2 seperate DvDs and install them like that or are there an alternative? (I don't want to use too many DvDs)
3) Is it safe to run windows updates?"
,DashBlacK,2009-12-28T21:08Z,"1) If you have your own key, you can use it. Otherwise if you have SLIC 2.1 in your BIOS, it will activate.
2)Yes, they are alternative.
3)Yes, it is safe to run Windows Update.
***If you don't have SLIC 2.1 in your bios or this version didn't work for you, I will be uploading another version really really soon. And that one will activate no matter what.***"
,gideonduah,2009-12-31T01:50Z,"dashblack how do i get slic 2.1?

,phantom1019,2010-01-03T22:41Z,work 100% on my toshiba a135. updated my bios and also updated windows once i restart it works
,DashBlacK,2010-01-04T04:22Z,"Hi gideonduah,
Try updating your BIOS from the TOSHIBA website. If you can't find a BIOS update, post you model number, i'll find one for you. or activate using an activator."
,alangaraujo,2010-01-05T02:26Z,"Thank you so much, worked flawlessly in my Toshiba A105 Modded BIOS!"
,bepari,2010-01-05T11:53Z,"Thanks for sharing bro... 
I was having a tough time installing windows 7 on my toshiba M300, as the touchpad and resolution behaved weird at some boots.. I hope this one works fine.... 
Thanks dear...."
,DashBlacK,2010-01-05T22:56Z,"Hi bepari,
it's not the problem with the Windows 7. If ur touchpad and resolution are behaving wierd, then it's a driver problem. I recommend you get driver magician (latest version) to get the latest drivers for your laptop."
,DashBlacK,2010-01-05T23:09Z,"Hey! Why does it say 3 seeders, while there are 60 seeders??"
,dufuss,2010-01-09T11:48Z,I used this to upgrade my Toshiba L505D from Vist to Windows 7 Ultimate and it is fully activated Thanks for the up!! 
,sky3k,2010-01-15T19:39Z,"Hi dashblack!

I have a Satellite A500-17X and it crashed while I was restoring the system resulting that my Pc does not boot anymore so I want tu reinstal the SO with all the original toshiba features. Do you think that this version of yours will solve the problem? tanks"
,DashBlacK,2010-01-18T04:36Z,"@sky3k

Just install Windows 7 from the DVD then install the apps from the app cd to get the TOSHIBA Applications!"

,moderan,2010-01-21T18:58Z,Hi! I installed this win7 on my Toshiba A300-1G5 and win7 is trial. I have 28 days to activate. I put my product ID but can't register. What to do?
,DashBlacK,2010-01-22T02:55Z,@1dave1 and @moderan: You guys have to either get a SLIC2.1 Bios Mod or you guys will have to use a crack.
,moderan,2010-01-22T11:35Z,"I have latest bios. Do you have a link for same good, checked crack for win7?"
,zapi9,2010-01-24T19:00Z,"Hey Dashblack. Great app. A little guidance...My toshiba is a satellite a355 and the latest bios update still does not have Slic2.1, but instead has 2.0. Unfort. I had to use the loader to work. Do you have the 64bit version as this is 32 bit and my machine is a 64bit. Thanks again though."
,DashBlacK,2010-01-31T20:51Z,"@zapi9; for a 64-bit, just download a 64 bit .iso and cop the $OEM$ folder from this .iso to the 64 bit one. and your done. any problems tell me."
,zapi9,2010-02-13T15:48Z,"Hey Dashblack..Thanks for the guidance. It worked!! Of course, since my version bios still did not have SLIC2, I used the loader as well, and now my OEM is activated. Thanks again guys."
,zapi9,2010-02-13T15:56Z,"Hey MAFIACORPORATION , I got the windows 7 .iso from mydigitallife site. It still did not recognise my laptop's OEM. So I copied the contents from Dashblack's $OEM$, namely the oobe folder to my windows' system32. Then the loader. Now I'm up and running."
,Vkalinkov,2010-03-02T14:59Z,"Guys! I have notebook Toshiba P300D with Vista Home Premium preinstalled. Want to update it to Win7 using this torrent. 
Can I do this (I mean upgrade Vista-to-thisWin7Toshiba, without clear reinstallation)?
And, if so, can I keep my OS licenced? Another words, is this new Win7 on my Toshiba remain licenced with the key I have now?

Or I must do clear re-installation?"
,H0bbes99,2010-04-17T07:28Z,"Hi,
I'm not sure if this is an untouched image or an edited one, but when installed, it gives a product ID of 00371-OEM-8992671-00004, which according to here: http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/10370-Windows-7-OEM-SLP-Key-Collection that product ID is ACER/GATEWAY/PACKARD. The ID for Win7 Pro in the key.vbs file is the same listed in the link above. Maybe I'm wrong but it's kinda confusing."
,ben02746,2010-04-26T06:09Z,i kno u answered this but i have a windows 7 key from a friend who also gave me a vista key from his laptop both hp and the vista one worked no problems but i have downloaded so many windows 7 copies and it wont accept my key is this a converted rtm to toshiba image or is it from a brand new computer u purchased ? thanks 
,ben02746,2010-04-26T08:50Z,this is the same version online everywere just with a toshiba key carefully inspected the info about the os and if u scroll to the bottom u will see consumer something windows 7 this does not this is an rtm version i believe 
,joeypeterman,2010-06-05T01:48Z,"I HAVE L305-S5955,AND IT WORKS PERFECTLY!!!! THANKYOU!!!"
,1Anonimo3,2010-08-07T16:50Z,"Vkalinkov 

Allways do a clean install, format during setup and erase all data from the partition that you want to use for Win7.

About this torrent I have no info, but I use another one and I have a Toshiba Satellite PSM 71 with Win7 and all works well. Beside the non-suport grafics driver for using the aero effects, all is well.

All the software and drivers for Toshiba can be find here:

,steelphoenix8,2010-08-15T15:42Z,"DashBlacK  - thank you.

I tried to copy  copy the $OEM$ folder from this .iso to the 64 bit one
I opened this iso with winrar, extracted $OEM$ folder and added it to sources folder of 64-bit image with MagicISO
I burned the disc, but it refused to install. 
What I did wrong?

And can you seed the 64-bit version?"
,DashBlacK,2010-08-16T12:51Z,"@steelphoenix8, Do a clean install with the 64-bit .iso and then copy the OOBE folder to Windows/System32 folder and you should be done. Please note that you need SLIC2.1 in your BIOS for it to activate. If you do not get the manufacturer info in the system properties you will need to run the .reg file in the OOBE folder."
