What the name says. Comments appreciated! Please be patient. Tell me here if any bugs!!


This version of Windows 7 is integrated with the TOSHIBA oobe, agreements, logos, oeminfo, certificates, TOSHIBA keys, and all the other stuff and it is pre-activated!! I have also provided a .iso with all the default TOSHIBA Applications that are pre-installed!! And there is a language pack too.




***Note: If you want this version to be pre-activated by OEM, you will need to have SLIC2.1 in your BIOS. Otherwise it might not activate. If you don't get the TOSHIBA logo in your system properties, go to X:_sources_$OEM$_$$_SETUP_SCRIPTS_logos_Toshiba and run reg.
(replace the _ with /)(replace the dash with slash)

There are more seeders than displayed here. Probably tracker error.
