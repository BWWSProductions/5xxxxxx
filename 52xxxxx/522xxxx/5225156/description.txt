PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
======================

ExpanDrive adds SFTP and SSH file capabilties to Windows Explorer by mounting SFTP servers as Windows drives.

Access remote files within any application

ExpanDrive acts just like a USB drive plugged into your PC. Open, edit, and save files on remote computers from within your favorite programsâ€”even when they are on a server half a world away. ExpanDrive enhances every single application on your computer by transparently connecting it to remote data.

Add SFTP to Explorer

With ExpanDrive, you can securely access any remote file server directly from Explorer, or even the command line. No need to open a separate SFTP client just for file transfer. ExpanDrive extends the way all applications on your PC can access data.

Reconnect with grace

Once youâ€™re connected, you stay connected. If you change access points or bring your computer out of sleep, youâ€™ll stay connected. Our robust networking core ensures that if a connection is available, your drive is available.

Ridiculously Simple â€” it just works

Our client is dead simpleâ€”there is nothing to install or configure on the server. No complicated instructions. No administrative hassles. Just use your existing login credentials to securely access your remote files.
