plzzzzzzzzzzz tell me if this is the real deal with all the files i need (isos)

all my uploads are real & clean. But this is a ISo for the PC. Magic Disc or another emulator is needed to load it."
,cryxix,2010-01-21T12:19Z,please upload the dlc w/ crack (if needed). please!!! Thank you.
,suprapro1,2010-01-22T08:11Z,cant i jus burn it like all other image files..... or did u rebuild the shit
,suprapro1,2010-01-22T08:14Z,"by the way, i just started the torrent and only have to wait 3hrs till completed, i will seed as long as possible "
,oriam12,2010-01-23T03:28Z,ok! i mounted the iso and nothing happened :( mounted with daemon tools
,suprapro1,2010-01-23T09:43Z,"forget mounting.. sigh..... waste of time, instead use iso buster to extract the iso files, save files to a location of ur choice...Then run setup, after all is set up, copy the crack(from extracted iso) to street fighter directory(where u set it up) it will ask u to overwrite, do it. Then launch and ur good to fight.
      END OF STORY......"
,suprapro1,2010-01-23T09:46Z,"By the way. if the crack,for some reason don't work, like mine.  It is actually a no-cd launcher, just google it, download it and do the same thing as u did with the 'crack'."
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-01-25T04:54Z,"the game works fine. Use Magic Disk as your emulator.

Install game. Then(DO NOT PLAY 1st)
copy the crack in the crack folder.
 Copy the SF4 Launcher to C:/Programs&Files/StreetFighter4 & paste & replace.
Then play the game.
Crack IS included, so enjoy the addiction"

*it may work, but the ISO was extracted from a .bin file, to make it easier for newer users o to use*

,xFOILx,2010-03-08T08:13Z,Thanks a lot! 
,gryphynwing,2010-03-12T06:05Z,"hmmm i cant seem to get this to work..
i mounted it with magic disk so that i could install, then i replaced the launcher with the cracked one, but when i double click the launcher nothing happens o.o"
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-03-22T12:01Z,"@gryphynwing  

1. is your pc rig able to play the game? meet game specs?

2. try to update your graphic card drivers."
,BBaraka,2010-03-23T01:44Z,Why is ghostsbusters playing? I am so confused?
,oriam12,2010-03-27T02:05Z,"downloaded this again just cuz, and i mounted it and everything went well :o, but this is a damn hard game!"

Why is ghostsbusters playing? I am so confused?

??? I play a mmorpg called The Reincarnation at the-reincarnation.com  I lead a theme guild called Ghostbusters, but how the hell did that video get in here? or are you speaking of my you(cant paste link on tpb)tube account?

@oriam12

indeed"
,fastneek,2010-04-16T18:43Z,Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeds
,fireflame3,2010-04-22T00:18Z,is there anyway to play this lan or direct connect?
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-04-30T05:22Z,"@fireflame3  unknown, I never attempted, and if there is no crack around, I hate to say it, but if you like the game alot, buy it, (yes i know) I try to provide as functional as possible games that are clean of virus & working decently, but online game play is harder, due to server scans, which some games will attempt to auto update, thus, killing the crack. So, atm, no I can not give you a helpful answer.

@suprapro1
I used Magic Disk. works everytime"
,fukq,2010-06-11T20:24Z,"waste of time. i don't know why but this just isn't working- mounted initially with daemon; then when i saw that someone else tried the same but failed, i tried magic iso- to no avail.

mounting went fine in both instances, and i've followed instructions to the T. i've mounted half life, nfs, f.e.a.r etc with no problem but this isn't working. when the window opens i try logging into my live account only to get the message 'can't sign in because your product key is not valid. please enter a valid product key.'

if someone can share a key for this i'd be grateful... otherwise i don't think this will work with any mounting tool."
,fukq,2010-06-11T20:37Z,"my apologies to the uploader for my misguiding previous comment. it seems the problem was not in the crack itself, but me forgetting to create an offline windows live profile. so make sure you pick an offline profile just in case you're having problems getting started... it should work 100% thereafter.

sorry once again.
"
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-06-19T07:03Z,"@fukq

no problem. when it douubt, always blame the uploader til he replies=D

if i take too long replying here, hit me up at GhostWarriorTheGeek on you||tube

and what in the name of the torrent gods is that music i hear and this is my only tab open lol.../runs to check source code"
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-06-19T07:05Z,least i aint going nuts just yet. seems music came from some adware on bottom for Heroes of Gaia mmo lol
,Gizmo20783,2010-07-03T00:48Z,After I install it says something about imputing the worng disk and to insert the correct one. What am I doing wrong?
,Gizmo20783,2010-07-03T03:40Z,"Wait scratch that it works,great too, but my computer isn't all that great so even after some adjusting my FPS is too slow to really enjoy it but thanks."
,J_Beezee,2010-07-31T13:03Z,Totally awesome. I had zero problems getting it to work and it runs flawlessly. Creating an offline profile will enable you to save your progress in the game (unlocking characters etc). Huge thanks!!! Will seed...
,fz39k,2010-08-02T22:59Z,"with me works fine, i just have one question, how can i save data if dont have any key? in the beginig ask for a key to regist if i want to save data. i want to save my progress in game.
"
,fz39k,2010-08-03T02:04Z,"i have a windows acount but the game dont have a option to put ""offline"" someone can help please?"
,kingwickedkidd,2010-08-13T15:59Z,wow downloaded at 889kbs for a while then dropped bad but downloaded and working perfect so far

,Ace_x8,2010-10-18T07:43Z,"works prefectly thankx !!!

,crazy4logick,2010-11-15T17:39Z,"WTF is this!? you need to propely format you file. because the file download was a 'file' 
Needless to say this has virus written all over it!
however I did not encounter any problems while installing a suggest to anyone downloading this torrent that you do a virus scan once file is downloaded"
,jinzo91,2010-11-19T01:07Z,"Hey here's wat I did:
Downloaded the torrent
Installed the game
Opened the crack folder (only had the 12.6mb sf4 launcher inside)
Copied and paste the SF4 launcher to the folder where SF4 is installed
Clicked the newly copied and pasted SF4 launcher to play game
NTH HAPPENS!! T_T (Same goes for when I click the Street Fighter IV button)
I'm using windows 7, I tried running in compatibiliyty with windows XP SP2 with administrator permissions but it still doesn't work! WHY!! =("
,crypt911,2010-12-05T21:33Z,installing now hoping everything runs fine....btw guys...if ur having troubling with the mounting just use powerISO....its the simplest thing to use on the market
,crypt911,2010-12-05T21:51Z,UP AND WORKING....THX PIRATE GW!
,Ejeemz,2010-12-08T17:58Z,"hi there
