[V],twentyforty,2009-12-18T18:16Z,"@htctouch: Don't worry, it's ready and goes after This is it.
@CAMILEON: Problem is with ""old"" torrents that my fans have uploaded my old torrents from name-not-to-be-spoken. When I moved-in (on TPB) most of my re-ups were rejected as ""This torrent already exists in system"". It has nothing to with me. However, my limited upload capabilities does not allow me to re-seed two-three months old episodes, I concentrate myself on contemporary production. I will suggest you to either do an extensive search here or btjunkie (I've seen my encodings here and there) and if file-size and file-name matches, and if such torrent is ""alive"", download it. Most of ""Dollhouse"" I have released as 360p and re-upping and re-seeding GigaBytes big pack would be suicidal, and no one of us would be happy...
Regarding Kite Runner, I must find DVD or BluRay - or very good (preferably 2CD rip) of XviD and I must be satisfied with quality. Answer is - maybe."

I have a request for The Hurt Locker please.
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887912/

If you can, woul dbe appreciated.

cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-18T19:11Z,"Jon, HurtLocker is one of the best movies in last two decades - and I had DVDrip almost two years ago. Movie was released as ""The Lucky Ones"" ""direct to DVD"", without theaters and kept away from public. Just now, after he got (last week) award on some festival, people start to speak about. If I can, I'll hunt them down and up the torrent... not tomorrow, but on this Sunday."
,jon4fun,2009-12-18T22:59Z,"Thanks mate. Whenever you get a chance is fine with me.

Look forward to seeing it even more now with your recommendation.

Cheers
Jon."

[V],twentyforty,2009-12-19T16:37Z,"@CAMILEON: LOL, thanks. Kite R. from BluRay is ready from this morning... just two Dollhouses delayed all ups. ""Kalifornia"" goes first, then ""Kite R"". Just a hint: requests caries a ""burden"" of seeding for at least 48h - fast as you can. That's all."
