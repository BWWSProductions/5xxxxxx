,8samurai,2011-12-23T18:35Z,for some reason episode 3 won't play very well. It plays up to 1:18ish the skips back to the beginning. Im using the latest version of VLC so anyone know why this isnt working?

I'm having the exact same problem! lol.

I re-installed VLC and tried Googling to find out what it might be but I guess the uploader messed something up with the files

,cl0ckwerk,2012-02-21T07:37Z,"none of these three episodes work properly. It seems to be related to the mostly red screens with words on them. Using vlc, every time it hits one of these screens it loops back to the beginning and disables the audio. Other players I tried just crash when they try to open these files. the OP works fine in vlc though as it does not have red screens. if you're looking for a stream, gogoanime has them in what looks like 480p. not great but more watchable than these."
,cl0ckwerk,2012-02-21T07:58Z,"sorry, disregard that last comment. The solution is to use media player classic with haali splitter (just google it). These work perfectly if you do that (not even any artifacting while cpu is under heavy load) perfect video and audio. color me impressed."
