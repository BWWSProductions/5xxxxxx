The Capatalist Conspiracy (1960's Anti New World Order)  This is the audio from the video.  I split the audio from the video because there wasn't much imagery to the video and the smaller file is nice.  Audio is only from the left channel only and is @ 128kbs.

This is about the agendia for a New World Order along with the manipulation of money, and its power structure.  The audio has some really good information considering the orginal video and this audio is from the 1960s.  

This would be really good to give to someone who doesn't know anything about the plans for a one world government.
