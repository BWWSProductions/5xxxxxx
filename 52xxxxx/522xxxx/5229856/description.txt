Just copied all 10 individual episodes to one folder for easier downloading and viewing.  Four of the ten episodes are mkv files but as long as your media player codecs are up to date, they WILL play in windows media player (and yes of course mkv files can be played in divx or vlc if you prefer it over wmp).  Enjoy!!!
