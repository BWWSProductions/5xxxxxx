I used to have this on Cd and I remember that that the quality was pretty poor (lots of background crackles). But the music could still bring out goosebumps. At this level of digitization, that is completely lost. Sorry gunsalius, but this is too disappointing and I have deleted it. I recommend that you do not waste time and bandwidth in downloading this."
