Thanks to the original uploader, here is what he wrote:

Great setlist, including "Yea, Heavy, and a Bottle of Bread."  Camera steady on a hatless and energized Bob the entire show. 

He seems to be really enjoying himself throughout. A reviewer at dvdylan complained that this show is boring since it's just 
focused on Bob throughout. Imho, that's what's cool about this video.  Enjoy!
