A live performance by Taylor Swift - You Belong With Me from CMT's Studio 330 Sessions.


"You Belong With Me" is a song co-written and recorded by American country artist Taylor Swift. It is the third single from her second album, Fearless. The song was originally released as a digital single, peaking at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 based on downloads. In April 2009, it was officially released to radio, debuting at #32 on the Hot Country Songs charts on the chart week of May 2, 2009. The song is Swift's eighth top 10 country hit. This song won the award for "Best Female Video" at the 2009 Video Music Awards. After the official full release, the song re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at #2, becoming her highest charting single, as well as her fourth top 10 hit, eighth top 20 hit, and 13th top 40 hit. "You Belong With Me" was the first song in over nine years to be in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts simultaneously (the last one being Faith Hill's 2000 single "Breathe").

The song also distinguished itself by being the first country song ever to top the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay since the list began incorporating Nielsen BDS-monitored data in 1990. 

On December 2, 2009, the song became nominated for three Grammy Awards including Song of the Year, Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the 52nd Grammy Awards.

The music video won the Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, making Swift the first country artist in history to win a moonman. During her acceptance speech, Swift was interrupted by Kanye West, which caused a media stir. Swift was invited back on stage to finish her acceptance speech by singer BeyoncÃ© Knowles, who won "Video of the Year" for her "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", instead of Knowles delivering a speech for her win.

Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song a mostly favorable review. Although he said that its production was "not remotely country" except for a prominent banjo line, he still called it a "well-written teen-centric lyric that any girl who isn't 'the pretty one' will absolutely relate to." Dan Milliken of Country Universe similarly said that the song was not suitable for country radio. Nonetheless, he gave it an A- rating, saying that its melody was "perhaps her catchiest yet" and that Swift gave a credible vocal performance.
