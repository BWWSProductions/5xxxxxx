,carkibanzali,2010-11-22T13:45Z,works awesomely problem when you try to open the game from a short cut it say you need to reinstall to fix simply open the original file not a copy not a short cut  
,colacocabmaster,2011-01-23T12:43Z,"@seconde
it is very logic it says that, because you haven't installed it. You need to know all about regestry editing and all if you want that problem to be solved, or just download another torrent and install that one.

Glad to help,
Colacocabmaster"

,ncc46537,2012-03-12T02:47Z,"To delete the folder, make sure none of the files inside it are in use.
So, open task manager, go to processes, make sure none of them are any of the files in the folder.
If any of them are, end that process."
