From Americaâ€™s #1 Crime ridden city comes the punk rock/metal mesh sound known as Without MF Order.

Scumrock if you will.

Founding member and guitarist Scumby began WMFO with drummer Crash in 1998. They self released 2 CDâ€™s before they met Peter Yarmouth at CBGBâ€™s in 2006 when they opened for Red State Riot. After witnessing the extreme showmanship that night Peter asked them to appear on the label's compilation CD Music To Make Your Ears Hurt Trey released in January 2007. Subsequently WMFO was signed to Black & Blue Records.

WMFO is fronted by vocalist Captain Perverto and bass player Al Poe rounds out the lineup.

The Captain is responsible for most of the humorous and controversial lyrics. The lyrics expolit reality TV with IDLE AMERICANS, a funny twist on St Louis biggest marketing firm is presented on the classic tune THIS BLOODâ€™S FOR YOU. This band plays it hard and loud and creates their lyrics based on current events, life experiences, and glorifying things that shouldn't be glorified. No subject is taboo.


WMFO have toured all over the United States including memorable gigs at The Sanctuary in San Antonio, Blood Club in Dallas, Room 710 in Austin TX, The Big Horse Lounge in Chicago, CBGBâ€™s Omfug in NYC, Whisky a Go Go and Key Club in LA, as well as appearances in NJ, TN, AR, MO, CA, NV, UT, IL, WI, KS, IA, KY and more I'm not aware of.
