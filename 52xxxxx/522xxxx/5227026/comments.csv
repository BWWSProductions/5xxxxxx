I can find nothing on him in English; his only mention in the Routledge Encyc. of Phil. is as a scholar of Nicholas of Cusa, and he doesn't have an entry in any English-language reference book that I checked. Has Rombach influenced anyone whose work is available in English?"
,post_modern,2009-12-19T08:09Z,"Well, maybe I should have said in Germany, Italy, Japan and France - as at least some of his works have been translated into Italian and French.  Why he is virtually unknown in English-speaking countries or why there are no translations in English available as yet is mystifying - this is not secondary literature, but a complete and exhaustive new philosophical approach, based on Heidegger's methods and school of thought, but regarded more as a culmination instead of a continuation of his approach.  He is being taught at virtually every philosophical and sociological faculty in Germany.  There is a paper on structural ontology in English underway - I will post it as soon as it is available."
