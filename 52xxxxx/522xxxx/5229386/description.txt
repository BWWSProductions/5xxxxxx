Amy Belle

Amy Belle was born and raised in Glasgow, Scotland, the youngest sibling of three (she has two older brothers). After a stint in the Alice Band, she commenced a solo career, the highlight of which is undoubtedly a televised performance with Rod Stewart at the Albert Hall in 2004. 

Despite the profile this granted her, a breakthrough into the mainstream is still forthcoming and she continues to busk and play gigs at venues in the West of Scotland and Northern Ireland.
