Stone Temple Pilots - Core 
Ripped with EAC to WAV to FLAC
Includes CUE + LOG.
Put CUE in main directory to burn. Choose the CUE you think is best for you. CUE files can be opened and edited in Notepad. You may want to change ".wav" to ".flac" before burning with your favorite program. 
Please don't hit and run. Seed to others as they do for you.
I have limited bandwidth and do the best I can to share. 
Will seed this till I have 5 seeds, then I leave it to you guys. Please keep it going.
