,twistquist,2009-12-18T07:17Z,"Word of advice: If you had any of the other torrent downloaded, dont erase it. Its not corrupt. This new torrent will pick up where the last one left off and you wont have to download all seven gigs again."
,menotoftheworld,2009-12-18T07:32Z,"Hey twistquist, way to come through with a tip in the clutch, I was about to trash the former download.  And thank you eksilimon13 for coming clean about what went down, we were all starting to wonder, but I appreciate the port and upload."

,twistquist,2009-12-18T08:40Z,"It works quiet well actually.. Some lag when you look around too quickly and some minor pop-up.

Just mess around with the settings until you find it runs best. This is what I came up with.

,StrategicPharaoh,2009-12-18T11:23Z,Could you please port Mass Effect? That'd be great!
,eksilimon13,2009-12-18T11:39Z,I will try every game you ask for but you have to wait cos I'm working on fallout 3 and dungeon keeper 2 when I upload these games I will start the other ones.
,sparrowhawk13,2009-12-18T11:39Z,"@ Kumphychair

Are you trying to run the game directly from the dmg, or have you copied it to your Applications folder first?"
,LoLoLou,2009-12-18T11:55Z,"@twistquist What's your system spec?
How well will this run on MacBook Pro (mid-2008) 2.4ghz 4gb RAM? 
I'm only asking because I tried the Modern Warfare 2 port that's knocking around, and it ran so slowly that it was unplayable."
,Kumphychair,2009-12-18T12:06Z,"@sparrowhawk13 

i did both, normally i do it right from the dmg. (poor practice?) but i brought it to the apps and it did the same thing.. should i re-download and bring it right to the apps and not anything else?"
,Kumphychair,2009-12-18T12:21Z,"problem fixed..when i tried to open it i had a other cider open i guess or something like that ? xD haha idk.. but its working now and like a charm great upload, props"
,LoLoLou,2009-12-18T12:24Z,"@Kumphychair
Hey how well is it running for you, and what's your spec?
Sorry to ask again about spec. I just... I just fear disappoint, bitter disappoint and hours inconsolable sadness and woe, woe and self-pity.

Then I'll play something else."
,sparrowhawk13,2009-12-18T12:50Z,"OK, so I installed and everything works GREAT!

Specs:
Macbook Pro 2.4 Ghz Penryn (Santa Rosa Model)  
2 Gigs of Ram
Nvidia G-Force 8600/128 megs dedicated v-ram
OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.2

I set resolution to 800x600 (crappy, I know, but playability is more important than how shiny it is, yeah?) and turned all other options off.  Game doesn't look too great, and the textures kinda blur in and out of focus sometimes, but everything runs very smoothly. 

I tested this with my very scientific 'spin around in a circle really fast while looking at lots of textures and see how much it chugs' method.  If anyone wants to do some actual benchmarking on a MBP, that would be pretty cool.

Since, you're asking for suggestions on which games to ciderize, can you do Dead Space?  I've been waiting for a Mac version, but hasn't shown up yet.  Looks fun as all hell."
,sparrowhawk13,2009-12-18T12:53Z,"@ Kumphychair

Yeah, bad practice, kinda.  Lots of games have to write to files in the game folder and do all kinds of other crazy game things, and that doesn't always go down to well when you're running from the dmg. I always copy the game to my apps folder and throw the dmg into the Vault for later distribution. (Anyone else do that? I can never seem to delete a dmg file, even if I have an unzipped copy. I just get scared that a game I love will somehow disappear from the web and be lost forever. Or I'm just a digital pack rat."
,sparrowhawk13,2009-12-18T12:56Z,"Sorry for the triple post!  Laptop users, if you change the 'Aim from sights' option from Right Click to Caps Lock, it's WAY easier to aim with the trackpad."

Or is there something I'm doing wrong? Windows hamachi seems far more simple and better than on mac, and there's one whole step for the windows hamachi/borderlands setup that you have to skip on mac, which is setting the network adapter priority.

I was actually running through Terminal, because after I spent ages reading the walkthrough on how to use it, I felt quite proud that I had successfully used something in Terminal.
However, I think I will get HamachiX now. Yes.
So even with hamachi we have to go through all the port-forwarding bullpoo?

,kountonme,2010-02-11T10:11Z,"this is how you play borderlands online...

1. Download Game
2. Open Game
3. At menu screen press the ""Online"" button (should be the second button
4. Log in or Create an account for Gamespy
5. Look for games that have either 1 or 2 spaces for people left.
6. From then it should load from 5 seconds to 10 seconds
7. If the time out timer goes to more than 10 press cancel.
8. If followed all the directions carefully you should end up in a screen that says ""Loading"" 
9. After that screen another screen should pop up after the black screen.
10. Choose your character and select the option join game.

Now you should be able to enjoy the game online and with friends. 

By the way great torrent.

Happy Fragging :D"

-just download the dlc's reloaded versions. 

-extract them

-right/ctrl click borderlands

-show package contents

- got to contents>resources>transgaming>c_drive>program files>gearbox software>borderlands

-then you will see the folders : eula, readme, binaries, willowgame and engine you will only need the last three

-now place the contents of the folders binaries, willowgame and engine ( there isn't a engine folder @ madd moxxi that is normal ) of your dlc's in the folders binaries, willowgame and engine

-accept every replacement

-and now close it start up the game and enjoy ;)"

I say seems, because I only launched the game and ran around a bit and killed a couple of guys, I didn't actually go to the new areas or whatever.
If anyone else wants to try, I did as the instructions said, with the RELOADED DLC for Zombie Island of Dr Ned, and just as a precaution, I didn't just copy the folders into the game contents, but rather I copied the files (as in NOT the folders) into the appropriate location each time.
I'll keep you posted if ever I try for another DLC, or when I try the new stuff (the stuff added by the DLC).
Thanks again hetserbarbaar..."
,Dobik2000,2010-03-04T00:29Z,"Ok, I tried it for Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot (RELOADED version), and it still seems to work (by using the same installation method as before).
Also, I tried going around a bit, specifically to the new areas, and although there are a few odd things, it seems completely playable (I only walked around a bit, checked the billboard, the shops, that kind of stuff).
The oddities I noticed are, during loading while going to Jakob's Cove, the tips didn't appear, it just stayed as DLC1_TIP_11 (the number changed), and in the Underdome, the bank system displays the same kind of weird messages (dlc2_whatever), but I guess overall it's still perfectly playable.
Again, will keep you posted once I try the Secret Army of General Knoxx..."
,Dobik2000,2010-03-04T20:50Z,"Ok, so, I finally tried installing the Secret Army of General Knoxx, the third and (for now) final DLC (still RELOADED). Same installation method, even replacing some ""old"" DLC content (files from the previous DLCs, actually called like ""dlc1_stuff"").
After a little testing, it seems like I don't have the previous ""oddities"" anymore (check my previous comments), but I did get a sound problem when the new DLC intro movie started (just after you get to the t-bone junction). No more sound until I left the area, but when I came back it worked ok. So, as far as I know, it's all working great.
If you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer. Otherwise, I'll probably post again once I've actually tried the content (doing the quests, etc...)."

,hetserbarbaar,2010-04-06T17:10Z,"allright i got a timesaver here for you,

How to skip the intro videos!

first:
-right/ctrl click borderlands
-show package contents

then :
- got to contents>resources>transgaming>c_drive>programfiles>gearboxsoftware>borderlands>willowgame>config

then:
open DefaultEngine.ini with your texteditor

then:
scroll down and search ( it's probably in the bottom of the document ) for : [FullScreenMovie]

then:
delete the following (NOTHING MORE!!!!!!)* :

+StartupMovies=2K_logo
+StartupMovies=Gearbox_logo
+StartupMovies=NVidia

 ; The game will automatically interpret the last entry in the list to be a generic looping movie, so make sure that the list has one... Comment was in the filename when loading.
+StartupMovies=Loading

+SkippableMovies=2K_logo
+SkippableMovies=Gearbox_logo
+SkippableMovies=Attract
+SkippableMovies=NVidia

now you can enjoy a intro free game. All you see now is the engine logos and such (much better than seeing all the other videos).

* just to be sure copy the data to a other document in case you accidentally delete to much "

,Dobik2000,2010-04-13T19:39Z,"BW31: moi aussi je suis franĂ§ais, donc je vais rĂŠexpliquer dans notre langue natale (bien que manifestement tu maitrises suffisamment bien l'anglais pour avoir compris le ""guide d'installation"").

En gros, j'ai tout fait tel qu'indiquĂŠ par hetserbarbaar. J'ai tĂŠlĂŠchargĂŠ les DLC faits par RELOADED, et je les ai installĂŠ un par un en testant Ă  chaque fois entre, et malgrĂŠ quelques bugs Ă§a marchait dans l'ensemble. L'installation en soi se fait en dĂŠ-rarant les archives (NB: parfois, en fonction du logiciel de dĂŠsarchivage que t'utilise, y a quelques dĂŠtails qui peuvent changer, et perso, j'utilise The Unarchiver), puis tu repĂ¨re dans les contenus de l'application les dossiers avec les mĂŞmes noms que ceux du DLC (contents>resources>transgaming>c_drive>program files>gearbox software>borderlands). La seule diffĂŠrence par rapport Ă  ce que disait hersetbaar, c'est qu'au lieu de tout balancer d'un coup, je n'ai dĂŠplacĂŠ Ă  chaque fois que des fichiers, jamais directement les dossiers. Oui, il faut accepter les remplacements, mais parfois si tu remplaces un dossier il t'efface les fichiers qui y ĂŠtaient avant mais que tu ne remplace pas dans le nouveau dossier, d'oĂš ce choix de ne pas bouger de dossiers. Ca prend plus de temps, mais c'est nettement plus prudent.

Pour ce qui est des bugs dont je parlais, pour Dr Ned, j'avais des messages (genre pendant les chargements) qui ne s'affichaient pas, et pour Moxxi, c'ĂŠtait des ĂŠlĂŠments de menu (notamment pour la banque, une des nouveautĂŠs de ce DLC). Pour Knoxx, les problĂ¨mes rencontrĂŠs avant ont ĂŠtĂŠ rĂŠsolus, mais la premiĂ¨re fois que je suis allĂŠ dans la nouvelle zone, j'avais des problĂ¨mes de sont (qui ont ĂŠtĂŠ rĂŠsolus en quittant la zone et en revenant).

Ta config Ă  l'air similaire Ă  la mienne, donc je ne vois pas pourquoi Ă§a marcherait pas, mais si tout Ă§a ne suffit pas, je ne crois pas que je pourrai t'aider davantage... Et si Ă§a marche, poste le (en anglais) pour que les autres puissent rĂŠsoudre le problĂ¨me..."

Running the game at 1920x1200 with 8x af, dynamic shadows off and everything else on the highest setting I am able to average about 45fps.

,Dobik2000,2010-05-23T17:48Z,"@quazx12: I haven't tried playing online, so I can't help you with that stuff. I do remember someone explaining how to play online in these comments (probably page 3 or 4 of the comments), so I'd try that if I were you, but I do seem to remember something like, if it doesn't connect before the 10s countdown, you should cancel and try again.
As for the DLC, apparently you got them working, so well done. I haven't tried it, but apparently there's a torrent for Borderlands with all the DLC for mac, so if other people have trouble, try that.
Finally, for the save games, I looked in the application package and in system library folders, and I haven't found a thing, but it's already a start to know that I can stop looking in the package folders.
@Sp1tFir3: I'm thinking that the problem lies in some kind of application conflict, because there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with your configuration, and other people, for no apparent reason, have had the same issue. You could try downloading the other mac borderlands torrent that I mentioned (the one with DLCs included), or eventually quitting every single application you have running and trying again.
Final idea, free some space on your hard drive. Seems kind of stupid, but the rare bugs that I had were in mid-game, and were solved when I freed some space on my hard drive (it bugged when I had, like, 1.5GB free space, and didn't bug anymore when I had more than 5GB free space). I think this could be something about how the application (through cider) handles virtual memory.
If none of that works, I don't know what to recommend, but good luck anyway..."
,leeofwestover,2010-05-25T09:58Z,"In the windows version the game creates a folder called my games in the my documents folder and that is where the save game is stored. The file is called ""player.wsg"". I cannot seem to find a mac equivalent.

I downloaded the mac version and played for about 10 hours. I now have the windows version which I can play at 1920x1200 with dynamic shadows and average 55-60fps. I really don't want to have to play through those first ten hours again."

It's not, in short, in applications, pictures, music, desktop, documents, downloads, movies, public, or sites, and it's not stored in any other program.

,quazx12,2010-05-28T05:58Z,"Also i got online working! It's only maybe a third of the games, but it does work and frequently enough that you can do it! Go to portforward.com and find your router, then find borderlands, and follow the instructions i put there."
,Dobik2000,2010-05-28T17:42Z,"@quazx12: I haven't played much, recently, so I can't be arsed to check right now, but there's an easy way to know if the savegames are on gamespy: disconnect your computer from the internet, launch the game and see if you still have your savegames (obviously, for playing solo).
@Sp1tFir3: if none of what I suggested works, I'm out of ideas... Sorry man, better luck next time.
@Plopomon: You can't seriously have read all the comments! It's mentioned several times throughout the comments. Anyhow, You have two options.
Either you search for the torrents (right here on the pirate bay, for instance) for ""borderlands dlc reloaded"" (RELOADED is the name of the group who made these versions of the DLC available, and they worked for me), and them install them by unraring and moving all the stuff in the appropriate place in the borderlands application package content (again, re-read the first few pages of comments, and you'll find a more complete description of the installation procedure).
Or you can go the easy way (if you have enough bandwidth and/or patience) and download the more recent torrent where there's borderlands with all three DLCs already installed (search for ""borderlands mac"" here on tpb and you should have this one and the one with the DLCs). Incidentally, if you choose this option, you apparently shouldn't lose your savegames, because, although nobody can find them, quazx12 confirmed that they aren't in the application package."

,quazx12,2010-05-29T07:52Z,"to be fair i only found out the saves weren't in the package through totally screwing up a dlc install a few times over. @plopomon, to install the dlc's, well, I'd say just be patient and download the one with dlc's installed already. in fact I suggest that to everyone. here's the link: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5583360/Borderlands___3_DLC_[MAC] @dobik2000 they aren't on gamespy, turned off airport and everything so they're somewhere on the mac. i just cant seem to find them! they can't be in the package because i've deleted the entire thing a few different times due to different issues, missing characters in the start screen, unhandled exception errors, and the like. so if they're there they're hidden and well. I'm halfway new to mac so is there a show hidden files and folders option?"
,Dobik2000,2010-05-29T15:04Z,"@quazx12: showing hidden files on a mac is possible through a bit of terminal manipulation. Open terminal (it's an application in the Utilities folder which gives access to the Unix command line interface), and type:
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true
and then relaunch the finder (or log out then back in). To make them hidden again, instead of ""true"" put ""false"".
However, I don't think this'll work to find the savegames, because hidden files are generally metadata that the OS uses (for Spotlight, for instance), and not much else.

And yes, to everyone, you might as well go ahead and directly download the torrent with all DLCs pre-installed: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5583360/Borderlands___3_DLC_[MAC]"
,leeofwestover,2010-05-29T16:13Z,"I have a suggestion, just don't bother. If you have a mac, it can run windows and that is the only way to run this game. At first I was getting like 30-40 fps with Dynamic Shadows off, but now that I have reached the headstone mines I am lucky to get a steady 20fps. And this is with a Radeon HD 4850. I downloaded the windows version of the game with all of the DLC( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5398067/Borderlands_1.3.0___Dr._Ned_DLC___Mad_Moxxi_s_DLC___Gen._Knox) and a working online portion of the game. It took about two hours to download and I had to play through the first ten hours of the game again, but it is so worth it. At 1920x1200 with shadows off I can get a solid 60fps and with shadows it varies but never drops below 35fps. Not only does the game play better out of the box, there are also about 50 variables you can play with in the DefaultEngine config file in the windows version of the game that are not accessible in the mac cider port. I was able to spend some time fooling around and have managed to strike the perfect balance between eye candy and performance."
,Riotnoob,2010-06-08T04:17Z,"Has anyone figured out how to work multiplayer? I've briefly scrolled through the comments and couldn't find a solution. I think it may be because it isn't updated to 1.3, but I may be wrong. I cannot connect to servers, as it'll just count down to 0 and nothing will happen.

Also, has anyone found out how to fix the lag? It works fine for about 2 - 3 minutes, then drops its framerate profusely. "
,Bobthedeadly,2010-06-17T01:40Z,"@Riotnoob

I have managed to get multiplayer working. Go to portforward.com, find your router, go to Borderlands, and follow the instructions. I got it to work using the instructions for my airport extreme. You need to forward some ports. Still, there is rarely a public game to join, and even if there is, I usually time out. Still, every once in awhile, I manage to connect to a game... usually just to get booted by the admin. If you don't have friends to play online with, theres little point in spending the time to get it to work. Just play single player, it's still a hell of a lot of fun.

As a side note - no one has found the saves yet? I really want to find them. Been looking everywhere. They aren't in the package, according to quazx12, but I can't find them anywhere else either..."
,Bobthedeadly,2010-06-17T02:26Z,"As far as I can tell, the save files don't exist... They are called save001.sav, save002.sav etc. on PC, but there is no such file anywhere on the Mac. I have looked at every file on my hard drive with the letters ""save"" in them, and the borderlands saves are nowhere to be found. But that's not possible..."
,mfjf,2010-06-17T18:57Z,"Hey, I am absolutely no expert on this kind of thing, however I believe the save file can be found in Username/Library/Preferences/Borderlands Preferences/p_drive/User/My Documents/My Games/Borderlands/SaveData

i had the same problem as you.  
no images of the guns showing up in the inventory menu or the vending machines.  its a small price to pay but actually really anoying. and makes switching guns and figuring out what you have equiped kindof a pain.  has anyone figured out a fix for this?  im downloading the other torrent and thinking i can just switch my save file into that one but its so much work.   if anyone has a fix id appreciate it...

This may be totally irrelevant but I run Borderlands with no freezes on a Desktop Mac running 10.6.4.
My specs are 3.06 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4 GB 800 MHz DDR2 SDRAM and the graphics card is NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GS 512MB. It may be that the Macbooks have bad Graphics cards, because my friend has a macbook and downloaded this specific torrent only to find when he tries to run the app he is rejected with a message about his graphics card. I also advise you download the other Borderlands torrent for mac which comes with the DLC because I can't seem to get them to work on this, I'm still waiting on some sort of help from anyone who has any clue on how to install the DLCs. Hope this helped, good luck."

I'm not the man with computers either, I just follow the instructions given, and when none are, then I'm really quite hopeless unless it comes down to guess and check so I can't give you the green OR red light. I've also never really got what 'mount' means computer wise (very nooby I know D: ) so I can't give you any specifics. I also can't exactly help alot with that area even if I knew because my friend gave me the .app, not the file you actually download. (I'm assuming its a .rar in multi-archive format?). First of all I advise you download 'Stuffit'. This is the best Mac app I know of for expanding and compressing files.
Again I have no idea if this information I'm telling you is even relevant to what you want to know, I can tell you there will most likely be nothing wrong with your Graphics Card because it is NVIDIA, and your specs seem quite good."
