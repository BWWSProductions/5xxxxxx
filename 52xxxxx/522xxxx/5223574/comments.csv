But what does it all matter since how the fuck am I supposed to burn an Ogg Vorbis file to CD?

A file ending of tar.gz?  What the fuck is that?

Isn't FLAC good enough for you?  Using obscure, difficult, and fickle file containers (how I hate Matroska!) is not going to win you fans or encourage keeping your torrents alive.  Use technology that normal people can understand and use.

End of rant, and sorry for the profanity, but I am a bit upset over this (since with Demonoid down it is the only torrent of this work available)."
