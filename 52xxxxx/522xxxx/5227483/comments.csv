,obeyordie,2010-04-04T04:26Z,@muis545 wtf i cant install im having the same prob as everyone else it says no disk inserted 
,soldiermoney,2010-07-06T22:49Z,"I am going to download it right now, looks like a nice torrent. Download speed around 250kb/s
If this works I'll try to make a small tutorial for the people who don't get it working."
,soldiermoney,2010-07-07T11:53Z,"Alright people, this is how I get it to workÂą

1.Download torrent (and seed)
2. Run autorun
3. The game will install now
4. When it asks for cd 1, DONT CLOSE THE SCREEN ASKING FOR CD1, the game is installed already. 
5. Now copy all the files you installed to the map containing you're downloaded files. (You're installed files could be in program files--> infrogrames.
6. The downloaded files and the installed files should be in 1 folder.
7. That folder should also contain a file called rct2.
8. With your screen asking for CD1 OPEN, click on RCT2.
9. The game should run now.
note: When you closed the CD1 screen, and run the game, there will be no scenarios. 

I hope this helped, this is how it worked for me on windows 7"
,saiy2k,2010-09-29T16:35Z,"works fine on XP sp2 :-)
thx"
,sweetface01,2010-10-26T16:15Z,i installed everything and i still cant play.. it says no disc inserted. :( please help me 
,razer145,2010-12-18T22:44Z,"Alright here's how I got it to work on Vista..

Download the torrent
Double click on autorun and install the game
copy all the files from the torrent into infogrames
go into infrogames folder > roller coaster tycoon2 then copy the location of the roller coaster tycoon2 shortcut.
go to the crack folder and open that and a box comes up paste that location into the box and hit the button on the left and the game should start. You have to c&p the location each time into the crack for it to work but it does work and it keeps your games/stats saved.

Hope this helps"
,ironbud,2010-12-19T09:26Z,corrupt game....fake game...i hate it.....contains trojan horse..........but where is the donkey...????
,inyualex123,2010-12-20T01:59Z,SEED and does this have a viruis
,razer145,2010-12-28T17:39Z,"I've scanned it with several virus scanners and didn't get anything. The game isn't fake, I've been playing it.. I've gotten through all the beginner levels and am now on the intermediate levels... I've also done a couple of the Six Flags Theme Parks"
,brokeded,2010-12-28T23:43Z,i did the above for windows 7 and it still asks for a cd
,DudeIGotCracks,2011-04-10T07:46Z,"this is XP Users help it might work for Other OS's

when you download the game and try to start it, it gives you this error. ""Wrong Disc Inserted"" ETC...

leave the screen open.
go into the folder you installed RCT2 in and copy the ""url thing at the top ETC... c:/Mydocuments...
then once you have that copyed go into the crack folder in the RTC2 install folder open RCT2.exe and paste what you copyed into the text area. once finished click the bottom right button the RTC2 and it will load GL"
,starmon,2011-04-10T11:19Z,"nice, download took only 5 min and installation process was a breeze"
,Morpheuz2o15,2011-05-15T22:48Z,"This gets a -1 from me.
I tried all the things suggested here but no matter what I try this installation keeps on failing.
Shouldnt be so difficult..."
,Stijnohood,2011-05-31T00:12Z,"Yeah it works, but as soon as I close the screen which is asking for a CD (it's still part of the sutup) I can't do play any scenario's anymore. When can I close that screen? Because it plays that annoying installation song the whole time and it pisses me off quite a bit."
,Aimar55555,2011-07-11T01:10Z,"Problem solved for Win7

(no annoying screens)

Here's what I did to make it work.

Once I've downloaded the files I opened Setup.exe and started installing as usual. At 99% (the end of setup) a screen pops up and asks me for disc one but as said before the installation is already done. What you now have too do is Copy the files inside the installation folder into your download folder which means:

COPY the files ""Data, Landscapes, ObjData, Saved Games, Scenarios, Tracks"" to your download folder named ""Roller Coaster Tycoon 2""

And now you have to copy and paste the crack into the downloaded folder ""Roller Coaster Tycoon 2"" (You can find the crack-folder inside the downloaded folder)

Now to get rid of the annoying screen you just have to Force Exit it with Ctrl+Alt+Del (I think its called Taskmanager) Because when you exit the screen in a normal way by pressing cross or cancel it wil delete you installed files.

Now you can play the game constantly by simply double clicking the crack. ""rct2""

Hope i helped out ;-)"
,Aimar55555,2011-07-11T01:28Z,"I forgot  something,

You'll also need the cange the properties of the crack ""rct2"" change the compability to windowsXP and set it to 256coulours. 

Once you've also done this you'll be set to go.

BTW: you probably already noticed that my English sucks, pls don't comment about it :-P"
,DankFace23,2011-09-29T09:45Z,"Uhm... I clicked on setup.exe and the installer window that popped up has been up on my screen for atleast 10 minutes and is still at 0%... This is beginning to aggrivate me. :( I don't know what I'm doing wrong? If I could get some help or maybe a walk through that a ""not-so-smart"" person could understand that would be greatly appriciated. (:"
,JaninaM,2011-10-11T11:11Z,"I have done all of this.. copy the crack and everything but It's still not working. It starts up , but then still asks for a CD... I did everything? Why is it not working?"
,pphan,2012-02-14T01:18Z,Doesn't work - fake.
,Butchekins,2012-03-27T05:10Z,"yeah um, mine installed fine and everything, and it even starts up to a black screen. Then a small window comes up in the top left corner with 2 options below a text box that is ready to be typed in that says: ./
the 2 options below are (a blank space) and what appear to be the words Roller Coaster Tycoon all smushed into the second option. Wtf is this."
,stemfish,2012-04-15T03:49Z,"Works fine, no viruses or trojans so far.

My setup on Win 7

To get it to work all I had to do was run the setup.exe and wait through the boring old school setup screens.
Click cancel, then when the confirmation window appeared let the program keep running to get pass 0%.
At the end I got a notice that the installed rct2.exe didn't match the installation bit, just clicked ignore, closed out the installer, and copied over the crack.
I did need to change the properties for the crack to run in win xp compatibility mode (service pack 2) and to run in 256 color as the sound was way off and the colors were overly pixalated.

Works just fine, what a blast to the past, shame my cd broke a few years back...This was probably my favorite game series growing up."
