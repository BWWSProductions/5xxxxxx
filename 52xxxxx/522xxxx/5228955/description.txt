Star Trek: Elite Force 2 - By Ritual Entertainment.

I have ported Star Trek: Elite Force 2 to Mac successfully!

This great game was the Second last First Person Shooters, from the Ritual gods, Who made FAKK2, SiN, Sin Episodes, etc.

This is a GREAT first person shooter, with one of the funniest multiplayer components ever!


Update:

Widescreen Support!


To change into a widescreen resolution (Standard is 1920x1200),
Right click on the file -> Show Content

and navigate to:

Contents -> Resources -> transgaming -> c_drive -> EF2 -> base

Right click on the file: frederikschreiber.cfg, and open with TextEdit.

Find the lines:

seta r_customwidth "1920"
seta r_customheight "1200"

and change the numbers to your screen resolution.


Good Luck! :)
