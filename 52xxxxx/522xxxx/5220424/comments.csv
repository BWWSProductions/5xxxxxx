,Oreo2996,2009-12-16T00:52Z,Which files go into which folder? >.
,Oreo2996,2009-12-16T00:56Z,"Okay, I took  a guess and copied the files into the Binaries folder, now when I try to launch I get this error: ""This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.""

Halp."
,Oreo2996,2009-12-16T02:57Z,"Yeah, all you put in was the .exe and a couple .dll's, not sure if it works, and do you know if this works on Razor's version? Because that's the one I have."

same here"
,moobyseviltwin,2009-12-16T03:20Z,"clarification, i installed the 1.1.0 update from the official website, then copied these files on top to the binaries folder. alf.dll and dfa.dll are NEW FILES to this crack. what is going on?"
,XavHalo,2009-12-16T04:28Z,"okay your game has to be updated to 1.1.0 and the files need to be put in the binaries directory,

the alf.dll and dfa.dll are actually a part of the zombie island dlc (im not sure if they are needed but their a part of the securom protection for the DLC so i figured reloaded may have modified them and they may be needed to crack the DLC)
so install the 1.1.0 update
http://updates.gearboxsoftware.com/dlc/Borderlands_Worldwide_Update_PC1.1.0.zip
and if you want you can install the DLC
http://updates.gearboxsoftware.com/dlc/BorderlandsDLC1_Worldwide.zip
after all is installed put the cracked files in the binaries directory 

so this crack will only work with actual installed copies of the game (installed from full 7gb iso) not the repacks (extract and run versions)

so in either case best thing to do overall is just get the reloaded copy of the zombie island DLC it is the 1.1.0 patch, crack and DLC combined and will be usable with any version of borderlands"
,Oreo2996,2009-12-16T05:54Z,"I downloaded the update from the site, and extracted to the default extract folder and then moved the crack to my binaries folder (not where I extracted the patch), do I have to extract the patch to my binaries folder? Or just install and let it extract to my temporary files?"
,Deathstryker,2009-12-16T11:00Z,"Hey XavHalo. I'm looking further into this but so far it seems that the EXE was not the only thing cracked by Reloaded. The ALF.dll and DLF.dll files weren't modified by them but it looks like all of the .umap files WERE cracked by them.

In theory, since only the DLC files have the modified .umap files, one could still find use for this torrent if they were to only install the 1.1.0 patch and not the DLC but otherwise, just this cracked EXE won't run on a legit DLC install."
,zhao9us,2009-12-16T21:01Z,does this give u multiplayer? or just single player?
,Oreo2996,2009-12-17T00:05Z,"Please answer this question.

I understand that you need to download the legit patch from their site, but when downloading it, it asks me where I want to extract the files, and my default is Temporary Internet Files, I have tried that and they succesfuly extract but of course it isn't yet cracked so I can't play. I then take the crack and put the needed  files into the binaries folder but it does not work. So do I need to extract the PATCH to my binaries folder also? Or what?"
,Deathstryker,2009-12-17T00:13Z,Extract the patch somewhere easy to get to like your desktop. There should be like 6 files or something and one should be a setup.exe. Run that and it will patch the files
,capnsate,2009-12-17T01:41Z,"Deathstryker-

I did that. I have the reloaded/ bigass ISO version patched to 1.01. The patch wont installed, it says ""the installation ended prematurely because of an error"". 

Instructions for this are pretty confusing btw, I have no idea wtf Xav us trying to say."
,Deathstryker,2009-12-17T02:11Z,"Can't really help you out I'm afraid. I didn't use the Reloaded release so I can't really troubleshoot with you.

To everyone using the legit'ly installed DLC:
I have confirmed that to get the NO-DVD function AND be able to play the DLC, you'll need to download the .umap files from Reloaded's release. You just need the ones from the DLC folder and you can obtain these from the UNRAR'ed version of the torrent that's around. Just don't download the DLL's because when someone made that torrent, they put a virus in those files. They aren't needed anyway because they weren't cracked.

If you don't use the cracked .umap files, you'll get a crash trying to load Jakob's Cove."
,theshadow1000,2009-12-17T03:00Z,"Hey I got it working. I have the non Zombie Island version. This is how:
1. Follow the link to the Borderlands 1.1 update, Install it! (Have your ISO mounted in your drive, I dunno if this makes a difference, just do it).
2. THEN unzip the torrent and copy ONLY the rdl.dll AND Borderlands.exe to Program files (x86)/2K Games/Gearbox Software/Borderlands/Binaries/Borderlands/Binaries. Replace the existing files.
3. Run Borderlands!

NOTE: I had the 1.01 crack patch installed before I installed the cracked 1.1 patch, you may need to do this!"
,theshadow1000,2009-12-17T03:02Z,"NOTE NOTE: I have the Razor1911 version of the game, with the 1.01 RELOADED patch installed (before I installed this 1.1 patch)"
,capnsate,2009-12-17T07:11Z,"For those who can't apply Official 1.1.0 Patch with the ""installation ended prematurely..."" problem read  quick/easy solution here: http://gbxforums.gearboxsoftware.com/showthread.php?t=87233

otherwise just follow other instructions. I had the reloaded Borderlands patched to 1.01; I did the official patch as above then copied the 1.1.0 reloaded crack onto binaries and works fine."
,stobecore,2009-12-17T15:47Z,"Hmm, in my games folder it says version 1.1.0
but when I go to online play and try to connect to any game it doesnt connect. Ports forward maybe??"
,Ilibaal,2009-12-19T01:02Z,"wtf i have a big problem. i have te razar's installed with the 1.0.1 reloaded patch, and did everything  except for the dlc , but it keeps saying whenever I start up the game:
First something about Runtime error, and then it says: pure virtual function call  error R6052..

wtf do I have to do :S"
,rusky-22,2009-12-19T22:05Z,"Can someone help me bro out? i have downloaded this patch: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5210389/Borderlands_1.10_patch 

Installed the patch files, and applied XavHalo's crack following theshadow1000's instructions, works fine. But when i go to install the DLC i cant get it to work, I just need help getting the DLC installed, gives me failed prematurely thing. I downloaded the other patch torrent because i needed  a work around due me getting same problem. Does anyone know a way around to install the DLC? "
,Tragik2k9,2009-12-20T13:10Z,"just as capnsate stated, worked flawlessly online. Thanks."
,epicmaster,2009-12-23T08:01Z,"ok i dll'ed the crack + patch etc. works fine but...

When I connect to online play I only find a couple of servers running and when I try connecting to one of them it times out, this has been hapenning ever since i downloaded the game PLEASE HELP !!!!"
,Hajojah,2009-12-26T15:53Z,RELOADED cracks are bogus. Better wait for another group to release a proper crack.
,omgitzkirby,2009-12-29T00:31Z,"Installed update, put in crack files, but when i start the game, i get the ""no disk inserted error""

Is it because i'm using the razor version, or
could it be because i don't have the ISO mounted? The crack that came with razor's version of the game allowed me to play the game without every mounting an image. Either way, when i mount the ISO using Daemon tools, i still get the error.

Please help!"
,Septette,2010-01-03T07:30Z,"Worked great. I've got some shadow issues in the game now, but that's probably my fault. Thanks!"
,Arenesus,2010-01-03T14:16Z,"Works perfectly, can use all the online functions and you need to have disk mounted. Just follow the instructions"
,lavafrawg,2010-01-07T04:35Z,"this works online, but it won't connect to servers HELP?"
,epicmaster,2010-01-12T02:00Z,Any one know where we can get 1.20 patch?
