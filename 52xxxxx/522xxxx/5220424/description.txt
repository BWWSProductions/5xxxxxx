Borderlands PC Crack 1.1.0

Your game has to be updated to 1.1.0 and the files need to be put in the binaries directory.

the alf.dll and dfa.dll are actually a part of the zombie island dlc (im not sure if they are needed but their a part of the securom protection for the DLC so i figured reloaded may have modified them and they may be needed to crack the DLC)

so install the 1.1.0 update

and if you want you can install the DLC 
http://updates.gearboxsoftware.com/dlc/BorderlandsDLC1_Worldwide.zip

after all is installed put the cracked files in the binaries directory

Those updates and copy of the dlc from gearbox website will only work with fully installed versions of borderlands (installed from full 7gb iso) not the repacks (extract and run versions)

so if you need the patch and the DLC the best thing to do overall is just get the reloaded copy of the zombie island DLC it is the 1.1.0 patch, crack and DLC combined and will be usable with any version of borderlands
