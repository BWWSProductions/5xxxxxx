I have downloaded since the 8 of March now and have 147 Mb of 3,42 Gb ;-). I would love a little little wider faucet to increase the flow if possible ;-)

Thanks for your kind effort!"

With a good internet connection, you should be able to get the entire dvd in less than an hour. Perhaps it's a timing issue as I don't have my computer on all the time (and I'm living in Korea time).

Well, anyways, keep trying! It's worth it."
