This is a DVD (Video_TS folder, .VOB files) of ë™í•´ì•ˆ ë³„ì‹ êµ¿ featuring ê¹€ì„ì¶œ. It is a staged ritual performance from 1991 produced by KBS. The last part of the DVD features the KBS orchestra playing a scored version of ë³„ì‹ êµ¿ (this part totally blows, but it was on the original DVD so I include it here).  

Hope you enjoy. It's a big file so I'll keep seeding for awhile. Click on my username for more Korean music.
