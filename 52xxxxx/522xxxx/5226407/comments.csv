If you don't have Vista, I am sorry but I don't know what to suggest.  Good luck."
,KumaPJS,2010-10-28T18:45Z,I'm running windows XP and the installer seemed to crash the explorer when i right clicked on it.  I wanted to run a virus scan on it since it was an exe.  So just a word of caution to all those that are interested.  DO NOT RIGHT CLICK on the file.  I'll go ahead and bite the bullet and see if I can run it at least though.  I'll be back later with how it went.  Yay for trial and error! X3
,KumaPJS,2010-10-28T22:15Z,Self extracted and installed.  Running it now and so far there is no viruses or crashing.  Download totally recommended.
,debart,2011-03-23T02:00Z,"Shorah!

The Drizzle component *works* in XP and that alone is the BEST part of this compilation. Thanks to the uploader - nice work! Using this, I was able to take an update that got me to an external shard and I am now exploring the user-made ages! Great fun. 

Thank you VERY much!"
,Cuttin_Edge,2012-01-12T08:36Z,Please seed! Also does it install drizzle straight away. I don't really want to install that. (also MYST Online has been free now for about 2 years)
