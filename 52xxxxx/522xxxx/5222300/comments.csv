,apkarino,2010-04-04T09:26Z,"i had to do some tricks to install it

the main problem that 
the computers displays a nag screen every time i open any folder 
yes any folder



it contains 
generals the original
and generals zero hour

generals works fine

but zero hour does not work
it is written in the file that to make it run
you must double click on the reg file

the whole installation does not contain any *.reg
in addition 
it is infected by a virus

does anyone really like that stuff????"
