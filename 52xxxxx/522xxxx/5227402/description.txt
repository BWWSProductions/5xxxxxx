Amazon.Com - Until Now, The Swedish Group The Cardigans Were Easily Identified By Their Sunny, Pop-Friendly, Melodic Releases. Fearing Being Typecast As An Act Fluffier Than A Nordic Lamb, The Band Decided To Head Farther North For The Winter. With Gran Turismo, Their Fifth Release, You'll Need Your Favorite, Um, Sweater, Because The Season Has Turned, The Atmosphere Is Frosty, And, Indeed, The Nights Are Long And Dark. Gran Turismo Is A Trip-Hop Album Following The Lead Of Grim Meisters Portishead. The CD Is Punctuated With Distorted, Muted, Uncomplicated Guitar Riffs And Keyboard Effects That Often Sound Like A Harpsichord Played Through A Fuzz Box. Nina Persson's Slightly Aching, Sleepy Little Cutesy Lead Vocals Sound As Frictionless As Rubbing Two Ice Cubes Together. Although The Skies Are Grayer Here, The One Familiar Musical Element Is Their Simple Yet Compelling Rhythm Structures, As Evidenced In Their Jazz-Informed Drum Patterns. If The Cardigans Weren't Competent Musicians, This Album Would Come Across As Nothing More Than A Career-Sustaining Maneuver. But With This Solid, Dark, And Intriguing Release, They've Clearly Demonstrated Their Ability To Compose Great Songs, No Matter What The Weather.
