So I'd assume you've cropped two vertical lines (""the black bar"" probably) out of the original 720x554 (since it's 1,85:1). That makes the correct resultant DAR

(718/720) * 1024  /  554
=~1,843:1
=~1021:554

The movie can be demuxed and remuxed (losslessly) to update the DAR flag to the correct value. There might be a tool for editing the flag straight away, too."

,elektronik_supersonik,2010-11-28T20:40Z,"Actually, AAC would've let you conserve the 5.1 audio with a sub-192 kbps bitrate - and with good quality, thanks to its superiority in multichannel encoding."
,elektronik_supersonik,2010-12-03T17:23Z,"Hmm, it's been cropped, but not completely. There's a vertical black bar on the right. Of course, it's only a rather trivial detail and the quality of the encode is excellent ;)"
