Editor's description:

The Learn in Your Car language series is the first system ever designed to teach a language in your car...or anywhere...without a textbook. Simple and effective, you can learn to converse in another language while driving, walking, or doing tasks around the house. And now with Learn in Your Car from audible.com, you can turn your PC, your Rio, or any mobile device into your own personal language tutor.

Each course is organized the way you learn best (by learning words and phrases) and building these into sentences and clear conversations. Arrange hotel accommodations, order in restaurants, change money, and feel more at home next time you travel!
