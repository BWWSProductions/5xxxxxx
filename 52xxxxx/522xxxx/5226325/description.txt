â€¢8 hours of recordings with an ingenious two-step approach:

Learn at home: Listen to the first set of recordings as you follow along in your textbook. Immerse yourself in Russian while you listen and repeat with the all-Russian recordings, and learn conversation, grammar, vocabulary, and more

Learn on the go: Then practice, review, and expand upon what youâ€™ve learned with the second set of recordings. An instructor will guide you through each lesson, and since no reading is required, you can listen in the car, on the train, at the gymâ€¦anywhere!
