There are 2 seeds on this torrent at present"
[T],Ch4cal,2009-12-19T17:18Z,"TPB tracker is down again folks, that's why the stats are out. There are 2 seeds and approx 50 peers at the moment and the upload is at about 33%

Please do me a favour and leave some feedback on the video/audio quality of my new format,

Thanks"

[T],Ch4cal,2009-12-21T00:39Z,"I can't believe how few seeds after 24 hours. I get a better response when I switch it off, rather than try to support it. And not one single comment so far. Is anyone enjoying this ? "
