In September 1999, Michael Adler Miltersen and Erin Chapman formed Sepiamusic (originally called Sepia) in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Sepiamusicâ€™s style is perhaps best described as melodic electronic. Itâ€™s also been described as a good mix of a masculine and feminine universe. Sepiamusic finds it difficult to place the music in a specific genre, because it holds elements of many different genres. Michael is inspired primarily by electronic music from the last 20 years. Erin also has a love for electronic music, but grew up listening to music from the 1940â€™s to the 1970â€™s. Sepiamusic is not about creating the â€sound of nowâ€, but creating the distinct sound of Sepiamusic.
