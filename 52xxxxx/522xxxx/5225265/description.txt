Treasure Island Media - DAWSON 50-LOAD WEEKEND - Part 2 - Bareback


PART 2 of the landmark two-part video from Treasure Island Media ...

The response has been OVERWHELMING. Since the release of DAWSON'S 50-LOAD WEEKEND PART 1, we've been flooded with demands for the concluding half of this already world-infamous porn saga.

Well gents, DAWSON'S 50-LOAD WEEKEND PART 2 (DIRECTOR'S CUT) has now arrived. And you're gonna be fuckin' blown away. If you think he stops at 50 loads you just don't know DAWSON!

DAWSON, the handsomest and most innocent-looking cumwhore of our time, has completely given in to his lust for manjuice - his hunger for taking load after load up his fine little ass. And he's never shown off his total hunger like he does in this vid, with his fine little welcome-home nympho-hole twitchin' with anticipation whenever a loaded cock wanders into fucking distance.

Some of the sperm-donating cocksmen that the insatiable DAWSON takes on in D50-LW PART 2 include Matt Walker, Kurt Kaiser, Seth Scott, Marc Short, Joe Sarge, Tom Finn, Pat Jackson, Mark Sergeant, Kevin Slater, Jace Hawk, Tony Rocco, Antonio Montez, Jack Forest and many more!
