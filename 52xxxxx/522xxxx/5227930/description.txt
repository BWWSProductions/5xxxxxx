Release Notes:

Aggressive Chill has a musical style where they blend alternative rock and 70's
hard rock. I might seem like it should turn out dated and completely
uninteresting but nothing could be more wrong when it comes to Aggressive Chill.

The leading track "Cockroach" starts of with a solid guitar riff leading you to
believe that this is well crafted but pretty ordinary hard rock. Two minutes
into that song when the symphonic orchestra is introduced the song takes on a
007 Bond kind of feel and it all kicks off into the stratosphere. The second
song, "Done by a fool" starts of with great singing over a simple guitar riff
before it turns into a killer tune, just making us eager to hear more. During
"Insomnia" it is time to bring the strings up front in the massive power ballad.
This tune could have worked as soundtrack to the movie Armageddon just as well
as Aerosmith did. You get the picture?

"Empathy" is a faster and overall harder track showcasing some faster riffing
and distorted vocals. We really believe that a tune like "Empathy will work well
during the live set. Still it comes across as an average track on the album and
it doesn't impress us much.

The first four tracks of the album really present the diversity of Agressive
Chill in the best possible manner, from here on you know what you are going to
get. The strongest compositions on the album are "Done by a fool", Insomnia",
"Understand me" and "Rust".

As soon as you get a sip of the blended result you will know that Aggressive
Chill possess something that's quite rare these days. They posses good taste and
a capability to capture that on tape. Aggressive Chill use that what have been
used by thousands of bands before them still they manage to produce great music
with an original feel.

Enjoy!
