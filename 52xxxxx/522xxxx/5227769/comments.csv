,xkinetikx,2010-01-01T22:42Z,"**DO NOT DOWNLOAD**

This file contains an undetectable virus/rootkit. I'm unsure what it does just yet however upon clicking the exe file your mouse buttons swap (easy fix) but it will start creating folders on your desktop like mad. I cannot find it in the processes or services. Running windows 7 64 I'm working on a fix now. If you downloaded this reply here and maybe I can help you."

,nisor,2011-03-10T16:05Z,"Hi!

If you downloaded it,of course it's a virus.
It makes the computer useless.You cannot open 
nothing cuz this makes exe files into windows media player file.

What you have to do:
Download and extract it into an other pc,and burn it into a DvD.There are lots of dvd burner. Like Ashaampo,Nero etc...

After that put the dvd into the disabled computer.Now go to My comptuer>Disk
Run it and restar pc,and it will be good.:)

,nathantjuuh,2011-04-19T08:03Z,"Retards..... This isn't a virus, your anti-virus program says it's a virus because it injects a .dll into the game. if it doesn't work, you have to select the file in your anti-virus program and set it as an ""exception"" otherwise your program will block the injection and wont work"
,ruarz,2011-06-20T18:36Z,"@nathanjuuh and everyone else.

Okay I can tell you right now you dickless fuck that this is definitely a virus. If I didn't have Kaspersky my computer would be totally fucked. It swaps around your mouse buttons, fucks with your .exe association, disables task manager and creates a load of folders everywhere. I've just about got it locked down and fixed but DO NOT BE TEMPTED TO DOWNLOAD THIS, DESPITE WHAT ANYONE SAYS. "
,gamerluke7,2011-10-01T17:34Z,"Please guys, do not download this whatever you do.
I was the stupid one who didn't bother to read the comments and run this without any anti-virus program. If you're also infected here's what I did for a simple fix. Download this http://www.dougknox.com/xp/fileassoc/xp_exe_fix.zip and put it on a usb stick. When booting up repetitively press F8, then choose 'Repair'. Open command prompt and type e: (or whatever the usb drive letter is) then regedit xp_exe_fix.reg. Restart PC.
Always read comments when downloading torrents and make sure you have up-to-date Anti-Virus software."
