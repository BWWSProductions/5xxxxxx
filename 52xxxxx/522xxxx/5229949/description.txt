"Halfway Gone" is the first single from Lifehouse's fifth studio album Smoke and Mirrors. It was released on October 27, 2009 in the U.S.

The music video for the song begins with an out-of-focus view of Wade, seemingly alone, coming up a hill towards the camera. When he stops and starts singing, the camera comes into focus and the other band members come out from behind him and start lip-synching his vocals. A group of people pull up in cars and they also lip-synch the song, as well as other activities throughout the video.
