,laurent123,2009-12-16T12:52Z,"hi , do you also have the meta keygen tct file to activate this map ?"
,shen_long75,2009-12-17T00:38Z,"yes i do...

i will post up a new Torrent for the .meta file.

I will also include the keygen activator aka Easytools.

On another note... can everyone please be patient with this download :-)

I only have 20KBp/s max upstream from my home PC (ISP Restrictions).

Once you have the FULL download please don't be scared to leave your PC/Mac/UNIX/Server running so that everyone else can grab it too.

Thanks in advance :-)"

can this map be used on a PDA?? "
,shen_long75,2010-01-12T03:31Z,"I don't think it can be used on PDA, however i am NOT 100% sure.

This map has lane guidance so possibly you are looking for 8.40.25.61 version which has NO lane guidance & can be used on PDA."

I have installed maps from different gps such as N95 and Iphone and never failed. But now with my TomTom One XL I can not make it work. I have an old scandinavia map in the harddrive. I have bought a new SD card 2GB but after trying to do as the comments here say it doesnt work. It just shows on the screen a big red kross over a memory card showing ""take out card"". Can somebody please post a walkthrough/guide showing ALL steps in the procedure? PLEASE!"

,malcinblue,2010-02-19T01:14Z,CHEN - in simple english how do you install this into the TomTom. Is it just a matter of replacing the meta file? All the files appear to be on my device already but when I click add new maps it demands a huge payment. Please advise...
