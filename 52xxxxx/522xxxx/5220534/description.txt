           Her fears and inability to cope with the harsh realities       
           of life becoming so intense that they manifest themselves      
           in an altered state of reality, a schizophrenic girl           
           begins taking orders from a pair of clown dolls who            
           instruct her to murder her adulterous mother. Rachel is a      
           small girl with a fragile mind. Her allegiance to her          
           parents irreparably fractured when she is forced to keep       
           her mother's extramarital affair a secret from her             
           father, Rachel can't figure out how to handle the              
           situation until her clown dolls, Melo and Lelo, offer an       
           unsettling piece of advice: kill your mother and in the        
           process absolve her of the evil that has infected her          
           soul. It doesn't take long for Rachel to act on the grim       
           suggestion, but as she grows up and her psyche becomes         
           more fractured, the cycle of violence continues.
