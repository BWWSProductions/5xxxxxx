,bongowolf,2010-01-12T11:27Z,Holy Shit - DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!  The studio that produced this movie is tracking !! and sending out emails!!! This isn't a joke.  My friends each got warnings! 
[V],bob5695,2010-01-12T13:47Z,^^ be careful with those emails - they might contain white powder a.k.a. anthrax ^^
[V],bob5695,2010-01-13T00:02Z,"i tell you what i make of it:

that email was NOT sent by the copyright holder.
it was sent by your motherfucking isp.
you can:
1) delete it and keep going with your life.
2) be an idiot and freak out about it.

the choice is yours."
