If you click on Wushdishmeen's name under the torrent info (the ""by"" field) you can see all of his torrents and then sort them by upload date and then you can see the latest upped by wush."

I am trying to automatically download the show so I can have it on my computer by the time I get up. I was hoping I could use my torrent client and RSS downloader. Any tips?"

I used a program called TED (television episode downloader) and that would create rss feed urls based on what tv show you wanted.  But I used it to make custom rss ""seraches"" and just included WDM or WUSH and it would find the episodes for me.  Hope that helps!"
,jd143,2009-12-18T20:17Z,Thanks deception420 I will give it a try. I wont know if it works until the next show....do you know if there is a show Monday? Or is another vacation?
