Release info:

This is some more great music by Paul May and Dick Taylor of the Pretty Things, Jim McCarty of the Yardbirds, Richard Hite of Canned Heat and Studebaker John. 
This is essentially a follow up to the excellent "Chicago Blues Tapes 1991". 
This CD covers the period between 1991 and 1993, and was recorded at various locations when times allowed these individuals to break from their busy schedules. 
The songs are all upbeat and fun and start out with a bang with the Lighthouse classic, "Wine, Women & Whiskey" right through a couple of doo-wop numbers to the ending number, L. Carr's "Getting' All Wet". There was a rumor of a third release, but seven years later, no sight of it. In the meantime, get this and the 1991 Chicago Tapes, light the BBQ and break out the beer.
