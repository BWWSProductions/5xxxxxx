,Princhy,2009-12-25T05:02Z,I really like that you took the time to post all of that here....good message especially the closing lines. Hopefully this movie will be a good witnessing tool and not just seen among Christians only.

Im Joseph from India, This is my first comment on this website..Can you pls Upload the movie ""Escape from Hell (2000)"".

 This movie will bring many people to jesus for salvation, I couldnt find this movie anywhere..Im planning to share it with all the people around me.."
[T],IndianChristian,2010-01-10T10:22Z,"@zmacdaddy8 

I do not have the avi version of the movie. So I posted the mpeg version because of repeated requests from people. 

Anyway in India it does not matter. Most people do not have dvd players or home theatre systems. They watch these movies from PCs.

In future, in case there is a movie requested for and I have a copy of it which is not in avi format, then I may upload it. Hence everyone who has a problem kindly do us a favor. Please check the movie format (avi, wmv, mpeg etc) before you download. In case your player won't play that format, please do not download.
Thanks."

I am unable to upload ""Escape from Hell"" as there seems to some issue with the site. Will upload it as soon as the site becomes normal."
[T],verifire,2010-01-12T12:34Z,"On the issue of formats: How about not being so picky, but actually grateful instead? To convert .mpg to .avi/Xvid/DivX isn't exactly the trick of the year. Lots of easy-to-use converters out there. My mother could do the job for you, but do the work yourself, zmacdaddy8, you lazy.. ..old friend of mine..  :-) "
,josephkarthic,2010-01-14T11:30Z,"Hi Indianchristian, Thanks for the reply..Hope the website will become normal soon..Still waiting for tht movie..Thanks.."
,born2bealive,2010-01-22T04:17Z,Thank you so much.. I just can't say how much I Love God! I really Hope the non-believers see the light.. I really do. The more the merrier in Heaven.

If you can be a blessing by helping me seed, I would really appreciate it. I hope these movies will be a blessing to you and any other people on PirateBay."

u must be wondering why i am writing these comments in all of ur uploads because being Christian u r not following the peaceful language which was taught by our prophet Jesus.
instead writing hateful vulgar comments against all other religions... grow up if u cant take criticism dont harass others"
,hahaheheha,2011-11-17T08:32Z,"@IndianChristian
after going through your comments i would just say that you  are one  hell of a great great and great bastards ... ooopss!! sorry !!!
rather you were born to the mother who just had the intercourse with the filthiest of pigs, the rotten itichiest dogs and hungry haynas  before giving birth to you fucking retard! .... yeah you proved it just now.....
i wish i could have uttered the same foul words as you did but ....
MOSES and JESUS were the noblemen and true messengers of Allah and we as muslims love,adore and respect them... i cant dare to say such words and above all PROPHET MOHAMMAD was the LAST prophet and messenger of ALLAH....
anyways u shits cant understand all this ...."
,mithu24x7,2012-01-02T16:59Z,"@hahaheheha 

Imagine you giving me chocolate.. and me not accepting it.. where is the chocolate?? With you right..

The same way you abuses Christians and we are not accepting it.. So everything is in ur hands itself..

Christ taught us to pray for our enemies..
Not to abuse others or to kill.. Will pray for you friend as Christ loves you too..

:)"
