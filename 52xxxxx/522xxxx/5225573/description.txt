All Ben Wilson wants is to be a better man. So when he hooks up with Joe Miller, a cantankerous old boxing trainer, he finally gets his chance. Preparing for a title-qualifying bout against The Butcher â€” the sadistic bully who once nearly crippled him â€” Ben hopes to win fame, fortune and the girl he loves. For in todayâ€™s world, thereâ€™s only one way to get what you really want: youâ€™ve got to fight for it!
