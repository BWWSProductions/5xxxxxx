Andrew Marr's The Making of Modern Britain 5of6 HDTV 720p x264 AC3 MVGroup

Episode 5. Little Britain.
The fifth film in Andrew Marr's epic six-part series charting the events that shaped Britain. A climate of betrayal, political extremism and unemployment pervaded 1930s Britain, with the country descending into chaos following the financial crash on Wall Street. Modern Britain had one eye on the future and one nostalgic eye on the past, but with Fascists on the march in Europe, our reticent nature was put to to the test, and the country finally chose confrontation over appeasement.
