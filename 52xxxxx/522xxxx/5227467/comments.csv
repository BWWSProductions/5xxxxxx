,libertaswv,2010-01-27T21:22Z,"^ yeah, alternative to reality.

Stossel is garbage. He is a liar, pure and simple. The man takes money from the industries he purports to 'report' on, and his presentations (like this one) are nothing more than press releases from the corporations in question. 

Stossel's Healthcare Distortions - 
One-sided report omits context - and facts: http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3189

Unlike Stossel, FAIR isn't in it for the money - but don't take their word for it, fact check the subject for yourself (making sure that your information sources aren't coming directly from the companies themselves, or their front groups...Read the 'about us' sections of websites). The man is a liar, and your own research will prove that to you.

More of his trouble with the truth here: http://thinkprogress.org/2009/08/27/stossel-death-panel/

Again, verify the facts for yourself. "
[T],skJGZV6z,2010-06-04T10:33Z,"The two websites cited are from progressive organizations, they lobby(ied) for the HC bill, helped to build it; the administration grew up out of and among the same cadre of folks who are behind these organizations.

Libertarian and progressive viewpoints tend to be in opposition. It only makes sense that from one perspective, the other may appear to be distortion in the minds of some.

I don't care about that. Arguments about the ""reality"" aside, my view is simply that government (especially at the Federal level) has no legal role in setting, managing, or regulating HC policy. Or, absent any Supreme Court decisions to the contrary, ought not have one in a free society."

,redactedwv,2011-03-11T21:33Z,"nonsense, uploader - pure nonsense. Glaring that you attack the linked sites from a partisan angle rather than attacking the facts found there. Shoot the messenger, avoid the message. Stossel is a yellow journalist - he's been busted for stretching the facts and excluding relevant information multiple times. It's fine to have an ideological opposition to socializing the costs of healthcare the way we do with libraries and police, but you can't claim it makes any fiscal sense. When you add multiple layers of middlemen that all require profit, you raise the cost of the service, and that is an inescapable fact."
