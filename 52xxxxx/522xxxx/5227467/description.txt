Tonightâ€™s Show (8pm ET / 5pm PT): The Real Problem with Health Care

Fox News reports today that the Senate health â€œreformâ€ bill is in danger from liberal Democrats.  Former Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean said:

"I know health reform when I see it, and there isn't much left in the Senate bill."

Heâ€™s right. It isnâ€™t â€œreformâ€. But expanding the governmentâ€™s role in healthcare isnâ€™t reform either. And why does the media call what Congress does, health â€œreformâ€?  The definition of reform is: making something better. I donâ€™t know that what Congress does will make our system better. Much of what Congress does makes life worse.

Tonightâ€™s show (8pm ET / 5pm PT) is about governmentâ€™s promises.  The â€œreformersâ€ say they will improve American health care, and slow the growth in costs.  To believe that Congress will do this is magical thinking.  They wonâ€™t keep costs under control. Medicare was supposed to cost $12 billion a year by 1990, but the actual cost was $110 billion. In the UK, the government-run system has tripled per-person spending since 1990 â€“ a much bigger increase than is the US.

My studio audience includes single-payer activists and members of the NYU Young Communist Club.  They will give Whole Foodsâ€™ CEO John Mackey and me a hard time.  Mackeyâ€™s stores were boycotted by â€œprogressivesâ€ after he wrote an Op Ed that was critical of Government-Care.

Hope you can join us tonight on Fox Business.  If you cannot, the health care show will be re-broadcast Friday night at 10 (against my old program, 20/20!), Saturday at 7PM EST, and Sunday at 11PM EST.
