,yosoyusuario,2009-12-16T07:05Z,"Is it virus free? There are very good movies, but, in my personal opinion, american pie the book of love, just sucks. They just ruined the concept of american pie.I specially recomend The Hangover. You're gonna laugh from the begining to the end. Thanks a lot to the uploader "
,yosoyusuario,2009-12-16T07:07Z,Does anyone know if this is virus free
,11241xXeyeXx14211,2009-12-16T09:17Z,"Well thank you yosoyusuario for thanking me and showing interest in my torrent. I believe you were looking for a response from another downloader about the reliability but I assure you I am here to become a trusted user and a favorite uploader. I would never put viruses into my files and give them out. If you want more information about my ideas behind EYE go to my other torrent Best.Action.Movies. Where I posted a comment tellng what my purpose here a tpb stands to be. Anyway I agree with you the funniest movie on here is The Hangover but The Goods is close behind, and as far as American Pie: The Book Of Love goes, you are correct again. They took probably one of the best DvD sets out there and turned it into a pile of rubbish compared to the rest. But as a movie alone it get a 7/10 from me. Well I hope you come back to download.

EYE will supply"
,yosoyusuario,2009-12-17T06:22Z,"Thanks for everything. I'm gonna give it a try and comment later. It's being each time harder to find good uploaders. I hope You understand my concern about free viruses torrents. Anyway, I have some movies maybe You could help me get. Once again, thanks a lot "
,11241xXeyeXx14211,2009-12-17T06:47Z,"yosoyusuario anytime. And i Know exactly what you mean about finding not only virus free but quality torrents. That is exactly why I started EYE. I wanted to take the hassle out of looking for such things and make it faster for people to search. And as far as building you a movie pack goes, tell me the names and i will find, compile and upload them. I realize right now most users wont download from me because of the speed but I am trying to express that if they don;t download and seed it will never be faster. I will always seed and I love doing it but people need to come to their senses that TPB is a file sharing web site, keyword SHARING, so please if you are not downloading or just before you go to bed hit the upload button and repay us. The more that do it the better we will be. But back to my original point, give me the list and I will give you the movies.   

EYE will supply"

No problem man. So are you downloading one of my torrents? I hope you do and don't forget to seed. Also do you have any requests for upload packs?"
,11241xXeyeXx14211,2010-01-01T23:35Z,"@dirty_nigger
First off only 2 maybe 3 of these movies are at all romance and really none of them are chick flicks. But thank you for commenting and expressing interest."
,Ogre999,2010-01-03T12:58Z,"Just a thought Ladies and Gents ...""Cheese"" is fine if your doing it knowingly ...it almost makes it laughably cool ... its only when you try something seriously and end up with cheese that it really sucks ...thanks for all your efforts as always "

i find it funny you think the movies other than 
bruno are gay whn bruno is by far the most gay movie i have ever seen 
im no homaphobe and i loed the ali g show and 
thought borat was funny 

but i really regreted watching bruno unfortunatly 
i watched the uncencored version and it was basicly sacha or his suntdoubles ass and penis about 35 times and 5 jokes that looked funner in the previews  and the rest is just gay sex acts and and a gay love story of a real stupid selfabsorbed ultra camp gay poser 

so if you want ali g type comedy dont bother if you want to perve on a gay blokes bits and watch simulated gay sex  then watch it "
,upploader,2010-01-17T12:46Z,"Same problem as with Best.Action.Movies(2009), really slow download, below 10 kB/s ATM. Please seed. Maybe you should rather just supply links to the movies... Thank you. "
