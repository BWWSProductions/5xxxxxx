Step 7: the sam eanswer.: I havent' the Civilization app right. Please reinstall.... :("
,mudbubble,2009-12-22T22:34Z,"You have to do all 10 steps in order before it will work, because the cracks are only used in step 10.

,wolfale,2009-12-23T01:56Z,"@ckecker67: all files for installation are included in this torrent!

step1: it's just copy and paste (copy the civ4 folder included on the mounted Step 1 - Civilization IV.dmg image  to your app-folder)

step 2-4: probably you have to choose the civ4 executable manually (it's the one and only executable in the apps/civ4 folder)

... 

good luck!

,hatzilo,2009-12-25T21:06Z,"I have done all the steps and  in the end it's telling me that I need a CD to play.
I triad with toast and It's not showing as an option.
where did I go wrong?
and if I want to restart jest delete it all from the application?"
,mudbubble,2009-12-25T22:32Z,"hatzilo, post the log files created by the 3 cracks.  Probably you can just delete everything to start over, but I guess you could use AppZapper to be really sure."
,hatzilo,2009-12-26T00:02Z,"what do you mean by log files
on step 9 where do I drop the Pseudo to? and then jest move all parts of step 10 in to the Pseudo?
Thanks for all the help "
,mudbubble,2009-12-26T00:34Z,"Step 9: Mount the disk image, drag Pseudo into /Applications, and then open Pseudo.

Step 10:  Drag the crack applications into the Pseudo window.  To use each one, you have to select the application by going to /Applications/Civilization IV/ and picking the right game to crack.

For Beyond the Sword, you have to go into the /Applications/Civilization IV/Beyond the Sword/ subdirectory, because /Applications/Civilization IV/Civilization IV Beyond the Sword is just a shortcut.   The same applies for Warlords.  

When you apply the cracks in step 10, it will either tell you it could not patch the files, or it will report success.  If it reports success, it will say ""Civilization IV.app has been successfully patched"" (e.g. for the original game), and you will be able to see a log of the patching process if you click on ""see log"".  What happens when you apply the cracks?  Does it report success or failure?  If it reports success, what does your log look like?  Mine looks like this:

Examining File : /Contents/Info.plist  -> OK
Examining File : /Contents/MacOS/Civilization IV  -> OK
Data of file : /Applications/Civilization IV/Civilization IV.app/Contents/Info.plist -> patched
Data of file : /Applications/Civilization IV/Civilization IV.app/Contents/MacOS/Civilization IV -> patched"

,mudbubble,2010-01-01T00:05Z,"randomshadows: no idea about the video card, but my guess is that it isn't to do with the crack.  Apparently the 3.19 update removes the DVD check, so you could always try not applying the cracks and see if that works.  Then again, that could be a Windows-only feature.

captaindim: no, it's a Mac game.

gaurabck, timbearden: each file is named with a step at the beginning, and there is also a README.txt that explains them in more detail.

,fillpas,2010-01-17T14:14Z,"OK

I'm running OS 10.5.8

I followed the instructions from the readme that comes with the torrent... which weren't actually that clear.

I managed to patch Civ IV and Civ IV Warlords, which are working perfectly, except for a bug where you can't see the faces of the leaders properly (just their beards floating in mid air!).

I cannot however get Beyond the Sword working properly. When I open the ""Step 10 - Civ4_Exp.140909.UBCracks.dmg"" file, and try to use the Beyond the sword updater with the Beyond the Sword app, it doesn't work as normal. 

First a window pops up saying:
""iPatch need to change permissions for these files : MacOS

Civilization IV Beyond The Sword""

You then have to allow permission change and enter your system password. After doing this another error window pops up that says

""Error (followed by a few directory paths etc)""

Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong? BTS is a bit different because it the torrent package didn't come with an actual zip file with cracked file to patch, or did I just miss something major?

Help please!!

,RomanSPQR,2010-02-25T21:27Z,"This is a really good seed and the instructions in the read me file walk you through the installation easily.

A couple of FAQs that I saw, I might as well take the liberty to answer

1) Yes this works on Snow Leopard. I play it on 10.6.0

2) When you install Beyond the Sword, you will have to manually select the Civilization 4 app to install. Leave the subsequent custom settings as they are.

3) NVIDIA cards may be glitchy, but it won't affect your enjoyment too much.  Faces of leaders will be invisible (oddly their beards and hats will remain.) When you zoom out too far on the world map, it will get graphically weird (land masses will shift, cities may appear on water etc) but you can zoom out far enough before this happens.

4) This will run on your hackintosh mac. I currently play this on a GA-EX58-UD5 motherboard with a Core i7 processor and an NVIDA GTX 285 graphics card.

5) This game runs on a macbook pro (10.6.2, C2Duo, ATIx1600, 3 yrs old)."

,jigreens,2010-06-15T16:57Z,"I had a tiny bit of trouble following the instructions in the beginning, but now it's all worked out. I'm running a 10.6.3 Snow Leopard.
HERE'S THE DUMMIES' GUIDE TO INSTALLATION, STEP BY STEP (some details may seem really elementary but I hope it'll help the mac newbies...)
#1. Copy the Civilization IV file (from ""Step 1 - Civilization IV.dmg"" of course..) into your Applications folder.
#2. Run through the installers for folders labeled Steps 2-4 (Update 1, Update 2, Civ IV Warlords)
#3. For the ""Step 5 - Beyond the Sword.dmg"" and ""Step 6 - Civ4_BTS_3.19"" installers, you have to actually go to your Apps folder, open the Civilization IV folder and select the main ""Civilization IV"" file - that's the file that should be updated, not ""Civilization IV - Warlords."" Then go through these two BTW installers. 
#4. ""Step 7 - Civ4_1.74.reissue.zip"" will release a 
Civilization IV file. Drag that into your Apps/Civilization IV folder to replace the original main file.
#5. ""Step 8 - Civ4Warlords_2.13.reissue.zip"" will release a Civ IV - Warlords file, drag that into your Apps/Civilization IV folder. 
#6. Install Psuedo using ""Step 9 - Pseudo_1.2.3.dmg"" (drag and drop into Applications folder).
#7. This is the cracking step. Open ""Step 10 - Civ4_Exp.140909.UBCracks.dmg."" You will see three UBCrack files for Civ IV, Warlords and BTSword. Launch them one by one, choosing corresponding files in Apps/Civ IV. Here are the instructions, including some essential details that no one seems to have mentioned.
(a) For Civ IV, choose the Civ IV file under Apps/Civ IV
(b) For Warlords, when you look in Apps/Civ IV, you will see two Warlords files, one is an alias (which will not work), the right one is the the 103MB one.
(c)THIS IS THE PART THAT NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE MENTIONED. In Finder, go to Apps/Civ IV/Beyond the Sword, copy the ""Civilization IV Beyond the Sword"" file. Then go back to Apps/Civ IV, and paste the file. Now under the Civ IV folder you will see two BTSword files, one is an alias (which will not work for the patching), the other is the file you just copied, 267.5MB. Now go back to the patching dmg folder (""Step 10 - Step 10 - Civ4_Exp.140909.UBCracks.dmg""), click on the BTSword UBCrack file, locate the 267.5MB BTSword file under Apps/Civ IV, then patch.
If you've patched successfully, a small green text line will appear telling you that the patching was successful.

Note: You never touch the Pseudo app after you drag and drop it into the Applications folder.

And I actually couldn't find the readme file that everyone's talking about.. So I wouldn't know if I've done something wrong, but so far the game has worked. If I encounter any problems I'll make sure to let everyone know and to come ask for help :D Enjoy! and THANKS mudbubble!"

Whenever I try to to run warlords, I get an error message, and when I tried doing the crack for beyond the sword, ran into a problems with permissions, changed them, but comes up with a message about changing the permissions again, asks for admin password, but comes up with error message after I enter it, so can't start that. 

Oh well, better than nothing, but if anyone has any suggestions, I'm listening, thanks.

czaneg, I ran into the same problem. Not sure if if you made the same error as me, but what I did was initially only put the civ 4 file, not the folder, into applications. For everyonelse, go ahead and laugh at silly me who forgot that all the files with the maps and programming are in the folder, not the app. 

Only other problem I had was with step 7, when I tried putting in the new version, it said I lacked some privileges, wierd. Anyways, I trashed the app in the Civ 4 folder in Applications and then pasted the reissued version. If anyone knows if thats what caused my problems with the expansions, please let me know. And explain simply, Sometimes I am very much the idiot as I stated. 

Thanks mudbubble andjlgreens"

I managed to patch Civ IV and Civ IV Warlords, which are working perfectly, except for a bug where you can't see the faces of the leaders properly (just their beards floating in mid air!).

I cannot however get Beyond the Sword working properly. When I open the ""Step 10 - Civ4_Exp.140909.UBCracks.dmg"" file, and try to use the Beyond the sword updater with the Beyond the Sword app, it doesn't work as normal. 

First a window pops up saying:
""iPatch need to change permissions for these files : MacOS

Civilization IV Beyond The Sword""

You then have to allow permission change and enter your system password. After doing this another error window pops up that says

""Error (followed by a few directory paths etc)""

Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong? BTS is a bit different because it the torrent package didn't come with an actual zip file with cracked file to patch, or did I just miss something major?

Help please!!

Copy the main Beyond the Sword file from the Beyond The Sword subfolder to where the main Civilization IV folder. Then apply the crack to the copied file.

I had the same problem as you but this fixed it"

The Pseudo crack doesn't on work because lion can't run POWERPC applications ... 

@Vasbied how did you get it to work"
,Loayajailat,2011-11-26T21:21Z,"I Finally Got it to work , since Pseudo doesn't work on Lion ..
Just enter terminal and type : sudo -s 
then press enter and drag the crack into it . and then just open the crack"
,sterno2,2011-12-14T05:58Z,"So, I got the game working fine, no issues with set up, just followed directions to the letter. But when I open the game everything is gibberish, all the writing that is, just random letter. Any one know how to fix this?"

,ryunushi,2012-04-11T23:00Z,"For anyone getting the error on Lion where you cannot patch Beyond the Sword (this comes with ""iPatch needs to change permissions for these files : MacOS
Civilization IV Beyond The Sword""):

1. Ctrl + click ""Civilization IV Beyond the Sword.app""
2. Show Package Contents
3. In the ""Contents"" folder, ctrl + click ""Mac OS""
4. Get Info
5. Click lock, enter password
6. Give yourself read + write permissions
7. Repeat step 3 for the file ""Civilization IV Beyond the Sword"" within the ""Mac OS"" folder.  This file should be a Unix Executable File.

Now apply the patch as normal."
,ryunushi,2012-04-11T23:01Z,"Sorry, step 7 in my last comment should say to repeat steps 3-6."
,Unwitty_Response,2012-06-14T22:21Z,"Ryunushi, you're a life saver. Game works great on my Macbook with Lion. Anyone looking to get the game working, just follow the original instructions up until Part 3"
