[V],globeplus,2009-12-18T19:49Z,"uploader note about this release for this game :
everything is pratical and nice to use with an automatic detection for close 20 languages that means that the executable will recognize the primary language the user have in the computer and it will use the language whenlaunching the game but just a little thing : the executable assumes native languages to be more pratical , for example : for using spanish , if youare from costa rica , you have to go to the control panel then select regions and idioms then select spanish from spain and it is guarantee that the game will be in spanish in the next launch of the executable , after that little change (if it is the case) after finishing playing the game you can put back the original language indication (spanish from costa rica) for example .
Well , nothing ripped , maximum quality or normal quality if you prefere and i wish to all the interested users to have fun with the game .
Merry Christmas ..."

,EvnikGillnam,2010-12-27T20:08Z,"There is a way around that dimi5510, and that is to put the files where they normaly would be put, IE into your programs folder. If you put it where the install would put it you should be able to install anything you want to it. But be warned that most of the Eps that I have seen will be checked for valid keys. I do not know how the mods work so I can't really help you there."
