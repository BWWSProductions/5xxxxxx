* GAMEPLAY :

* Sim houses and neighborhoods are entirely in one continuous map, and the developers have stated, "What you do outside your home now matters as much as what you do within." The game includes an optional feature called "Story Progression", which allows all NPC Sims in the neighborhood to autonomously continue as if the player was controlling them, such as grow up, get married, get jobs and promotions, have children, build their dream house or buy a house, and so forth.You can take any chances you like. You are the controller.

In addition to Needs, Sims now have Moodlets, which can be positive or negative. Moodlets involve events such as emotional or physical events, such as a good meal, comfort from sitting in a good chair, and other things. Most Moodlets last for a set duration, whereas some negative Moodlets can be cured and some positive ones rely on the Sim's surroundings.

The previous system of Wants and Fears from Sims 2 has been replaced with a new Wishes system. Fulfilling a Wish contributes to the Sim's Lifetime Happiness score, which can be used to purchase Lifetime Happiness Rewards.

Sims live for a set duration of time (adjustable by the player) and advance through several stages (baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult, adult, and elder). Sims can die of old age or they can die prematurely from causes such as fire, starvation, drowning, electrocution or mummy curse (new with Sims 3 World Adventures)
