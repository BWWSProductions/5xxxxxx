Star Trek: 25th Anniversary (1991) ppGame

The first in Interplay's game based on the 1960s Star Trek TV Series, you are Captain Kirk, leader of the Starship Enterprise, the most famous ship in the history of Starfleet Command, and are able to give orders to other crewmembers. It is up to you to right the intergalactic wrongs, protect the Federation, and boldly go where no man has gone before in a series of missions that test both your wit and command. 

The original cast of Star Trek provided the voices on this CD version, including William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, and Walter Koenig. The game itself was designed by Jayesh Patel, Bruce Schlickbernd, Michael A. Stackpole, and Liz Danforth.

The game had a copy-protection system in that the player was forced to consult the game's manual in order to find out which star system they were supposed to warp to on the navigation map. Warping to the wrong system would send them into either the Klingon or Romulan neutral zones, and initiate an extremely difficult battle that often ends with the destruction of the Enterprise.

See Page 10 of the pdf manual or GalaxyMap25.gif for the map you'll need (Look for it in the startmenu). When you first start and you're on the bridge, use the TAB key to get in and out of the view screen.
