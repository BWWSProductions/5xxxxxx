,raventhe,2009-12-20T08:34Z,"THIS IS A CAM RATING
V:7, Subtitles for alien language in russian
A:9, In English
Not bad, the few subtitled parts of the movie are in Russian so unless you read it you'll just have to guess."

This move has more details than a 4K proj can display, and you are downloading a cam?
