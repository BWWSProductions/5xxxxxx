Marine Aquarium 3.0.1 
This screensaver puts the fish right on your desktop or if you have a program like "Wallsaver" you can have your screensaver as a desktop background which is really cool.


After years of development, SereneScreen Marine Aquarium 3 is finally available. MA3 is not just an update to previous
versions - the entire program has been re-written from the ground up as a full 3D environment, taking advantage of the
increased capabilities of modern video cards.

What's in the program:

* An incredible new high-definition 3D tank, bringing a whole new definition to 3D aquarium simulations.
* No more 8-fish limit. The larger tank can handle up to 30 fish at once!
* Multi-monitor support. Spread your aquarium across two or even three screens!
* Music play-list. Choose your own MP3 or other music files to play in the background as you watch the Aquarium!
* Six moving Background Objects
* Clock/Calendar. Keep track of the time and date while enjoying the fish.
* Custom Logo support. Add your custom logo to the crystal in the tank!
