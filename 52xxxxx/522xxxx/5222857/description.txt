Andrew Marr's The Making of Modern Britain 2of6 HDTV 720p x264 AC3 MVGroup

Episode 2. Road to War.
Andrew Marr continues his rollicking account of the early 20th century, placing the era as a time of seeming innocence captured in children's classics such as The Wind in the Willows. But we shouldn't be fooled: "Edwardian Britain has been covered by a golden, dappled glow," Marr tells us, reclining in a punt on a golden, dappled river. Yet "Dark, angry storm clouds were brewing." The big storm was the First World War, but before that there were other rumblings - dockers' strikes and battles over women's suffrage. The jittery archive clip of Emily Wilding Davison running in front of the king's horse at Epsom is shocking to watch.
