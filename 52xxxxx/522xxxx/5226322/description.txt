Designed with busy people in mind, PDQ is an effective way to learn essential and practical Greek. Native speakers take the listener to Greece to learn the essential Greek he or she needs to get by. Topics covered include: meeting 
people for the first time; asking a question; ordering food and drink; starting a conversation; getting to know someone; talking about your family and friends; finding your way around and asking directions; talking about your home and where you live; hiring a car; and sightseeing. The recordings are bilingual so the learner can study simply by listening to the lessons. The book offers helpful backup and extra practice.
