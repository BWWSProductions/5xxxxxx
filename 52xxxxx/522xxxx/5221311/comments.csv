I installed and gave it a try, and became ' horrified ' by the suggestions of this software. On a system deemed clean by latest versions of Malwarebytes, Superantispyware, G-Data, Avast,  and A-Squared, this software still claimed to find malware inhabiting many of my system files ( notice I didn't say program files ). It is my personal belief that execution of some of this so-called malware removals could endanger an operating system and possibly would lead to a complete corruption and forced re-installation of said operating system. 
  All I'm saying is be very careful of the suggestions of this software. "

To check this simply diskonect from internet.
Run and select and delete all harmful thing from Pc.After you finish do it again ,so you will get same crap again and again which means that it is false result to impress you"
