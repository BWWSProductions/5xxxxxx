White Lunar is a collection of soundtrack work that Nick Cave has done with Warren Ellis. The album features work from the films The Proposition, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, and The Road. The work from those films takes up disc one of the two-disc collection.
The second disc of White Lunar contains music that Cave and Ellis composed for two documentaries: The English Surgeon, which detail's a doctor's attempt to bring neurosurgery to post-Soviet Ukraine,  and The Girls of Phnom Penh, which follows three young girls caught up in Cambodia's sex trade. The second disco also features a suite of four songs written by Cave and Ellis, all named after craters. White Lunar certainly won't be a sunbeam, but anyone who's familiar with Nick Cave couldn't have expected it would be.
