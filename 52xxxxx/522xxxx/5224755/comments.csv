,mimoid99,2010-02-20T19:01Z,"The file cfmon.fn.exe that runs during install contains a trojan (risk level 1).

DO NOT INSTALL!"

Why is there some dummy's trolling the torrents & posting these stupid virus warnings? They must be 12 or 13 years old.

I downloaded only the serial.txt file & got the 2.2.4 trial on Nikon & it worked fine.

Note that if Nikon changes the version of their trial, then you are better off with the entire torrent.

Don't forget to modify your hosts file, block in firewall & uninstall Nikon Message Center."
