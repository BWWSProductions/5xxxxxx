Nikon Capture NX 2.2.4 is a full-featured non-destructive photo editing program that provides photographers powerful tools to quickly and easily edit their photographs. Simply place the Control Point on the area that you want to edit and U Point Technology will analyze color elements such as hue, saturation and brightness, as well as recognize similar areas where an edit would best be applied. This technology powers the entire Capture NX 2 series of Control Points: Color Control Points, the all-new Selection Control Points, White/Black/Neutral Control Points and Red-Eye Control Points. With Capture NX 2, theres no need to deal with selection tools, layers or lengthy training.
