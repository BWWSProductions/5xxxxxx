,travelix,2010-01-02T12:00Z,where do I enter the unlock code?
,Cyphex,2010-01-08T00:11Z,"have you made an unlock code with the garmin unlock generator/keygen? 

you need to enter your unit id in the top and then choose custom mapset in the bottom, enter correct mapid and click generate

then use this code under the installation or in mapsource in the menu Utilities > Manage Map Products.

To unlock a map product in MapSource:

Click Utilities > Manage Map Products.

Click the Unlock Regions tab, and click Add.

Enter the 25-character unlock code.

Enter a comment (optional), and click OK.

,boarder8383,2011-01-25T05:30Z,"Hi all,
Do I need to use MapsetToolkit and cGPSMapper to convert the .img file into MapSource format before I can load it into Mapsource? I actually tried that but cGPSmapper failed saying that the .img file has less detailed layer or something. Does anyone know what I should do with the .img file? 

I also tried unlocking the region in Mapsource with the code but it said the map was not installed. Please let me know what I have done wrong. 
Thanks a lot!"
