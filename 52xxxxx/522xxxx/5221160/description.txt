synopsis:

After returning from her vacation, aspiring author Han Ji Eun discovers that her family home has been sold - without her consent - to famous actor Lee Young Jae. Young Jae has been trying to hide out from some nasty rumors about his sexuality and sees a perfect opportunity: he and Ji Eun will enter into a contractual marriage and pretend to be a real couple. In exchange, Ji Eun will do the cooking and cleaning and the house will be hers again after six months. Sounds simple, right? Wrong! Young Jae has been allowing the rumors to fly because he's really too afraid to tell his childhood friend Kang Hae Won that he's in love with her. Hae Won is blissfully unaware of Young Jae's feelings because she is love with their other childhood friend, Yoo Min Hyuk. As if that weren't enough of a love tangle, Ji Eun starts to fall for Young Jae despite their promise to keep things 'just business', and Min Hyuk starts to fall for Ji Eun. Will everyone end up happy, or will there be more than one broken heart?
