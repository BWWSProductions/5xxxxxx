Andrew Marr's The Making of Modern Britain 4of6 HDTV 720p x264 AC3 MVGroup

Episode 4. Having a Ball. 
The fourth film in Andrew Marr's epic six-part series charting the events that shaped Britain. In the 1920s, Imperial Britannia slid from view and a more modern Britain tried everything new, as a great age of experiment arrived in politics, writing, art, sex and drugs. The decade saw a post-war housing boom, the birth of radio broadcasting and the creation of the BBC, but the General Strike and the Wall Street Crash brought Britain's roaring twenties to a dramatic close.
