Well let me just say, If you're so passionate about saving the world by inaction and belief alone ...
Then get off your butt and upload this album.

38Mb needing 30% ... 12mbs isn't much to upload, even if you are on dial up.

C'mon people, look after the torrents you upload.
You have an obligation to your digital offerings..."
