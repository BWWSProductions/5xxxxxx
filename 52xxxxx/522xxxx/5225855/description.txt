If you don't have one i suggest you sign up & help promote this band, it's a really good site & it logs plays, the more plays the higher ratings it will get.
I personally think this is a good band & i suggest if you like it enough SEED & promote others into buying the album. Maybe we can get Amazon.com
to sell this artist too! Also you may add trackers to this torrent as well, please just don't modify the ID3 tags unless you know what you are doing, thanks!
