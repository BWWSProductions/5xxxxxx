,Manu1453,2010-04-29T00:04Z,"Hello, it's working.
You must have Alcohol 120.
Go to Menu Start => Alcohol 120 => A.C.I.D Wizard.
When the program is open, you must choose Cloak. It's for Securom 4 and 7.
Mount EPC Opel with Alcohol 120.
Instal the program.
On the last windows, you can see a http adress.
Copy this adress and open Internet Explorer.
Then CTRL+V, and the program start. 
Save this adress.

It's just a catalog...
And the program is 03/2009.

Opel don't have a program like Mitchell On Demand or ELSAWIN ?

Nie ma sam naprawiam ?

Dziekuje bardzo RJSYSTEMS :)"
