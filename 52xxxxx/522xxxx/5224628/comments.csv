,Stalingradz,2010-01-02T17:47Z,Its all in the info.
,user0111134,2010-01-03T21:00Z,"I am having the same issue as Arck. I downloaded the torrent, then put all files, excluding the info one, into an archive with Winrar, and then tried to extract and it's still not working."
,Stalingradz,2010-01-04T00:41Z,"Use this instead of winrar.

,user0111134,2010-01-04T19:28Z,"Ahh.. I was able to get it working finally. I appreciate you uploading this, but the part about using 7zip and more precisely which 7zip download(as there were multiple ones on that site) could definitely be added to the instructions section for those of us that aren't as advanced and can't catch on. Anyways, after running in playing it, I've gotta say it works just great!"
,user0111134,2010-01-04T19:35Z,"Oh, I did forget to post one thing, though. I extracted the game to my desktop, and as a result, whenever I try to move the game files off of my desktop into a folder, I get this error:
Failed to load the launcher DLL:
The specified module could not be found.
I guess it's looking in the wrong place for the files, but I'm not sure how to change where it looks for them."
,broaff,2010-01-18T00:32Z,"Congratulation to uploader. 

FOR fuck sake, TPB is the best torrent page.
DONT fuck it with torrents with PASSWORD.

I can't extract those files, because it need a fucking password! I wasted my time! Thank you!"
,Stalingradz,2010-01-18T10:27Z,"Dude, if you would bother READING THE FUCKING INFO you would realize that the pw is c@t you moron."
