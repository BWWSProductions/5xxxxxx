During the Bloodlines event, Venev, one of the Bloodlines Parasites attacks Andrew Van Horn, the son of a weapons manufacturer.  Upon awakening after the attack Andrew discovers that he is now able to agitate the atoms present in matter and either cause said objects to explode or convert a portion of their mass to directed blasts of concussive energy.  

He takes on the persona of Gunfire after he learns that his father had profited from weapons sales to terrorists. He works to neutralize this and comes into conflict with 'Dominion', a former employee of his father's business.
