,tarasingh,2009-12-17T16:39Z,can u please upload The Very Best Of MTV Unplugged
[V],bubanee,2009-12-17T21:36Z,if i upload lil wayne again.. it will be a proper CDRip with covers... i havn looked into it since i found this version... but when i know the world will too! 
,Jahorse,2009-12-17T23:19Z,"is it just me or is something up with these tracks? windows media player doesn't show the song's progress on the bar and if you try to jump around in the song it skips to the next one. Oh well, works fine in VLC, only having the problem in wmp. Great album either way. Thanks!"
,RobotPIRATENinja,2009-12-18T02:21Z,This isn't the real Rebirth album because it doesn't have the song Hot Revolver.
[V],bubanee,2009-12-18T07:19Z,"@ jar... yes thats why 99% of people give WMP the ars...
@ robotP... as for proper track list... who knows really... 
nothings real until you have the actual album/cd in your 'own' hand... seen the internet bullshit to many times to believe half the crap they write.. before a physical copy"
