All the themes and graphics are new and original â€“ and we promise not to tell your friends that our designers made them for you!
Animated DVD menus
Donâ€™t waste endless hours building menus and start screens for your video DVDs by hand. Just select a theme, select your movie clips and let Burning Studio do all the work for you. Click and burn, it really is that simple. And youâ€™ll be amazed at how impressed everyone will be when your menu appears on your TV! Theme Pack DVD Menu themes

    The Ocean theme, for example, shows a red buoy floating in a stormy 3D ocean. The self-playing movie previews circle this buoy and can be selected and started every time when they become visible in the menu.
    Watch video... 
    The next theme is all about the 70s and will bring the feeling of the seventies back to your screen. Colored spirals are spinning in the background while the blue bubbles of a lava lamp fall on the screen. Cool.
    Watch video... 
    The Skyline theme shows a colorful, illuminated skyscraper skyline of a fictitious city, with beams of searchlights sweeping over its buildings while the pictures of the displayed preview scenes reflect in the virtual water.
    Watch video... 
    A real eye-catcher is also the elaborate Comic theme which at first only shows the blank squares of an empty comic page and then gradually fills them with the preview pictures of the videos that are recorded on the DVD.
    Watch video... 
    For romantic videos, in contrast, the Hearts theme is particularly suitable. It changes the TV screenâ€™s color to pink and colored hearts rain down. Even the movie previews are fitted into neat little hearts.
    Watch video... 
    The Romance theme can also be used for romantic movies. In the background, it shows a handwritten letter with a burn hole in the middle through which the video preview is shown. A red rose and a burning candle further increase the romantic effect.
    Watch video... 
    The Tower template is very impressive. It shows a glass skyscraper from the perspective of a small human being standing directly in front of it and looking up the facade into the animated cloudy sky. The movie preview is projected directly onto the building facade.
    Watch video... 
    The Bamboo theme takes us into nature. It shows a green bamboo wall including symbols from the Far East, with flower petals slowly raining down in the foreground. The movie preview can be seen through a gap in the bamboo wall.
    Watch video... 
    The Colors theme provides psychedelic effects and transforms the background of the DVC menu into a multi-colored plasma sea whose colors are constantly changing. In the midst of the wavering color mist the preview for the movie can be seen.
    Watch video... 
    The ten themes are completed by the Happy Birthday theme. It is particularly suited for home-produced birthday party movies. The preview movies are integrated into a real birthday card which lies on top of an envelope. In the foreground, confetti is raining down on the card.
    Watch video... 

Disc labels, cases and booklets
These themes make it easier than ever to make great-looking discs, disc cases and booklets, and Burning Studio 9 supports a huge range of label formats, direct-to-disc printers and LightScribe burners. Here too, you just select and go, nothing could be easier. Theme Pack Cover Editor themes

    Beer For the brew aficionados in your life. Make discs and covers that look good enough to drink! 
    Crayons Great for kids and school content. A colorful eye-catcher 
    Curtain Not quite what you might expect from the name, this one is very stylish and modern with striking colors and a dark background. 
    Dessert Attractive as a gourmet platter in an expensive French restaurant, against a plain white background that gives you plenty of room for your own content. 
    Frog An attractive nature theme with a protagonist who looks as though he might just turn into a prince at any moment. 
    Grass Another great nature theme, looking up into the sky through the grass from an antâ€™s-eye perspective. 
    Party 2 The perfect setting for your party music, or for an unusual invitation to a special event. Graphical and striking in dark blues. 
    Rose Time for romance â€“ the classic flower of love in a perfect close-up. The dark maroon background creates a good contrast and provides space for plenty of text in light colors. 
    Sunset Another good theme for romantic content, but also for vacations and other uses. 
    Swan With its red beak this wonderful black swan is one of the most striking images in the entire Theme Pack. Perfect for unusual music and video. 
    Tree A very strong graphical image with vibrant colors. Great for romantic and nature content. 
    Virus This theme is very tech, with images from the further reaches of cyberspace. Good for computer themes, sci-fi and software. 

Movies and slide shows
In addition to the animated DVD menus (see above) you can also add graphical logos and subtitles to the images and movies in your disc shows. The logos and subtitles can be moved around and resized and you can easily edit the subtitle text in each image or movie. Theme Pack movie and slide show themes
