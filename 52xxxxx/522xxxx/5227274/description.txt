Issues - Korn [1999]
	
Wikipedia - Issues is the fourth studio album by American nu metal band Korn. The album has sold over 9,000,000 copies worldwide. Issues are one thing Korn singer Jonathan Davis has in spades. On the quintet's fourth album, Davis spews forth about misery, hate, happiness, pain, paranoia, and other primal issues, all set to an appropriately dark soundtrack. From "Dead" (which begins with Davis's trademark bagpipes in a sort of choral musical setting), to the first single, "Falling Away from Me," the vocalist's quavery, edgy, manic delivery sets the tone for this 16-song outing. Not as modern sounding or melodic as 1998's Follow the Leader, Issues is a throwback to earlier, more metallic Korn. If possible, Issues has an even creepier vibe than its three predecessors, thanks partially to eerie guitar lines and vocal effects, especially potent on "Let's Get This Party Started." Twisted, cohesive, and epic, Issues comes through for Korn's fans, who relate to the band's cathartic musical exorcisms and aggro, bottom-heavy rage, commercialism be damned. 
(Please note: You may receive any one of the album's four different covers.)
