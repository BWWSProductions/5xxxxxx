"Alex talks with Nigel Farage, the former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party and a member of the European Parliament for the South East. Farage recently criticized Prince Charles and British PM Gordon Brown for not allowing a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon. Often described by the media as a "eurosceptic," Farage has come under fire for characterizing the EU as authoritarian dictatorship ruled by unelected bureaucrats to the detriment of national sovereignty.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
