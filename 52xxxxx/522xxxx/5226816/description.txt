        If You've Never Seen a Ghost... Look Closer

        Sixteen-year-old  Alice Palmer  drowns while  swimming in  the
        local dam, near the town of Ararat. After she is laid to rest,
        her  family  start  experiencing  a  series  of  strange   and
        inexplicable events. She begins to mysteriously appear in  the
        background of photos and video footage. Profoundly  unsettled,
        the Palmers seek the help of a parapsychologist who  discovers
        that there  was more  to Alice's  life than  first appeared. A
        series of clues  lead the family  to Lake Mungo  where Alice's
        secret past emerges.

        Lake Mungo is a mystery, a thriller and a ghost story told  in
        documentary style  that illustrates  how the  dead can forever
        haunt the living.
