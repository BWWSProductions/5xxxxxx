,CherryxDarling,2010-04-25T04:15Z,"So when the show The Universe on the History Channel ended it's 4th season, I was completely heart broken. I am so very excited Nat Geo has decided to air this show because I am obsessed with learning things about our universe. 

Anyway, thank you very much for uploading this! I also set it to record on Media Center, but for some reason it didn't record this one and I don't want to wait until it comes on again in a couple of days."

,drako314,2011-11-01T07:00Z,"great series, highly informative basically dido with cherryxdarling.

The quality was averidge.. but this was on a 1080 hi def screen and it was still very watchable, so i imagine that it would be pretty good for lower quality's. "
