I'm out to buy a hard disk for this.

;-)

Please dont die on me"
,Torr3ntRid3r,2009-12-25T19:02Z,This torrent has 1 seeder even though it reports as 0
,Torr3ntRid3r,2010-01-13T14:20Z,Please dont run away when your download completed! - has taken me a long time to upload:p
,j770503rex,2010-01-25T07:28Z,can you reupload this torrent with separate discs..... i only want few  and i don't have 67+GB to let me download and extract....
,Nashnir,2010-01-27T01:13Z,"Can you please mention around which Version of Maya and Max are these tutorials based on.

No Offense but why did you archive them like that ?
You could have Archived each DVD separately rather than in parts making it easier to Download.

How are we now supposed to which ones we wish to Download?"
,Torr3ntRid3r,2010-01-27T09:16Z,"This course is based on 3DS Max 9
Im not the original archiver, i just uploaded this so ppl dont have to purchase premium accounts to download, and seeing as most leecher's seem to have hit and run, i wont bother anymore go google it and download separate iso's somewhere else!"
,apwbdjp,2010-01-27T13:27Z,"Thank you so much for this torrent. We would just all be gratefull if you could, since you have the files on your computer, extract the different ISOs and upload the torrents as separated discs.
It's just an advice, I know you did real real hard work on this, but you would have a lot more active torrents if they were directly accessible ISOs. (It's pretty obvious, since a leecher that had to be a leecher for a month downloading 67Gigs won't be seeding much longer, since the first reflex after that would be to turn off the client and to start taking the courses.) Imagin how easier it would be if we could download a DVD, watch it while seeding it, and downloading another one.
It's just an advice, I realy thank you."

,Xebecs,2011-06-25T22:02Z,"Alright! Download is done, I would like to thank up-loader for distributing this wonderful collection.
Anyone who is interested in 3D, seriously this one is a complete package for you.
The picture and sound quality are awesome, even in my 21"" LED videos are crisp and clear.
This is very through learning process, you need to consider yourself as a full time student in your computer, because the whole university materials are there to learn.
Every bits and bytes of 3D starting from vector mathematical representation in 3D to camerawork, lights, rendering and animation techniques are there to master.
High-school geometry classes are going to come handy now, although every chapters are described comprehensively for practical usage.
Even after I am finished downloading this Monster, I am definitely keeping it alive as promised.
Hope this helps.   "
