,crazzy_DG,2009-12-22T18:46Z,"No, U r not... It might be  the problem of missing system files... Reinstall windows 7 & run loader(crack).. U also havn't told me about the antivirus u r using.... For help mail me at crazyjimmi@gmail.com .... Have a good day.."

,crazzy_DG,2009-12-23T10:01Z,"Just Install Windows 7 V-7600....... Then Run this Crack... A window will appear to crack autometically or Manually.... Just choose autometically if u cant understand the manual functions... And if You dont have the version 7600 of windows 7 then download it from here:

And dont worry... it works 100%.. & I'm also using it...."
,superbad1,2010-01-08T05:35Z,"tried another activator, same problem as this one: ""the system cannot find the file specified""

the top of the error window says ""Windows 7 Loader eXtreme Edition v3(beta)""

version of w7 I'm running is from a pre-launch party. could it be a BIOS version problem?"
,crazzy_DG,2010-01-09T19:57Z,No... Its Not.... It might be the problem due to the version of windows..... Just download the version 7600 from the link given in comments.. It'll work 100%...
,whilmo,2010-01-17T12:40Z,"didn't believe that this would work, but it did! thanks man!"
,night creature,2010-02-17T12:18Z,It worked :D Thanks mate! 
,gahaj123,2010-03-22T02:38Z,"Just to let people know what I did.......
Im running windows 7 OEM 64 bit build  7600.
The crack does work. if it doesnt work for you, it could be a faulty version of windows........otherwise make sure you didnt use windows update, because that fucks up the crack (all of those security updates KB7878bla bla stuff). so  that means find a way to uninstall those updates.... or reinstall windows WITHOUT UPDATING and run the crack immediately. use loader method."
,gahaj123,2010-03-22T02:39Z,oh yeah dont forget to run as administrator
