Hey Guys!

My video files are always, always, always, high quality M4V files. Pretty well DVD quality, if not better. Playable on the PS3 and other home video playersâ€¦ I use my WDTV Live, and if watching on my computer I always use VideoLan VLC Player.
The Audio is just as good as the video. Just perfect.
Never any audio/video sync problems. No pixilation, though if you find any of this, let me know and Iâ€™ll get rid of it! I'm not perfect, but I try to make my rips!

The math works out to be about 1gb per hour. No more 700gb specials! 

To find more of my torrents, just click on my name VixtoSirchy at the top, or search for VIXY.
