Sometimes it says so if you haven't finished the downloading but if I try to make it play it just doesn't simply start. So it might be that you can't play it with your quick time. Try VLC ? Or media player.
It looks like my download takes 14 hours XD So I think I cancel this one. If not, I'll be posting the ''quality report''..."

A=10
