,2DTV,2009-12-19T19:07Z,Wish I never downloaded this - the picture isn't all that good. It's definitely not DVD quality. I will have to download the same film from another torrent now - another 1.37Gb download... sigh
[T],Booster2,2009-12-19T21:24Z,"What are you?! A fucking moron? Of course this is taken from a DVD. But you just says this to bullshit. Nice try, little fag."
,2DTV,2009-12-20T03:15Z,"Then why bother uploading some shit when there are perfect torrents for this? Seems stupid to me, and a waste of time. I just finished downloading the other torrent and the picture is PERFECT. So it was pointless downloading this one."
[T],Booster2,2009-12-20T11:03Z,"Because comments like yours is unnecessary.

Why bother taking time to download this one then if you ""KNOW"" a better release that you could download it other places instead?! You waste your time for yourself. Others may not."
,2DTV,2009-12-20T21:33Z,I chose this one because I thought it would be the same quality as others. My mistake.
[T],Booster2,2009-12-20T21:44Z,"No offence, man, but never expect good quality on files in 700 MB. These are ment for ""DivX use"" and are suppose to fit on a 700 MB disc. Kind of absurd by saying that this is a waste of time. What's the point to have internet, right?! Upgrade your speed then."
,2DTV,2009-12-22T00:20Z,"It has nothing to do with speed, my speed is fine, I'm more upset about the fact that I wasted time downloading this pile of shite. And for your information, I've downloaded hundreds of 700Mb films, all of which are DVD quality.

Actually I just checked my Armageddon film on my laptop, it's 701Mb, about 3 hours long and the picture is the same as on DVD.

Explain that asshole :)"
[T],Booster2,2009-12-22T15:54Z,"Armageddon on a 700 MB file? You got to be goddamn joking me. More like good picture without sound. You must be fucked up somehow. But please, download more shit so other people can make sure that you are not qualified as a good commenter and be insulted as much it is possible. Good luck with your report-bullshit in the future. And good luck by wasting more of your time too."
[T],Booster2,2009-12-22T15:56Z,"And by the way, Armageddeon is less than 3 hours. Explain that, faggot."
,2DTV,2009-12-22T23:51Z,"Correct, Armageddon on a 700Mb file (701Mb to be exact). It's . avi too - 2 hours, 24 minutes and 40 seconds long. I said 3 hours because everyone remembers it as being almost a 3 hour movie when it came out.

Sounds like you don't know how to do these films like others do, maybe you would like to educate yourself?"
[T],Booster2,2009-12-23T00:05Z,"You ain't serious. You know why?! Because you need to go to school again. Check my torrents and think again. Since I have encoded over 100 movies to an XviD file, so you shouldn't try be to arrogantly since I know this better than you."
[T],Booster2,2009-12-23T00:09Z,"One other thing (since you seem to be a lowminded fool) Don't confuse DVD and Blu-Ray rips. Two different things. Was that educated enough, ace?"
,2DTV,2009-12-23T16:55Z,"I know the difference between DVD and Bluray rips you dick! Admit it, you just aren't good at your shit :)"
[T],Booster2,2009-12-23T17:11Z,"Yeah whatever, fucker. Get lost, shithead."
,2DTV,2009-12-24T23:02Z,Merry shitty Christmas to you! :)
[T],Booster2,2009-12-24T23:36Z,"Thank you, fucking idiot."
,2DTV,2009-12-25T02:21Z,No problem dick licker :)
,Rames6,2009-12-25T08:18Z,"Lol, you two just made night.  That is the funniest shit i have heard in a while.  The quality is pretty much spot on what you might expect for a movie so old.
The one thing I can never understand is how people can complain so much about movies they are downloading for free.  Hell, i remember how dope this movie was when i was younger on the old VHS.  Can you really bitch about a rip that is better quality than that.  And 2DTV, you best not try and tell me this is worse than VHS.  Keep up the good work booster, without homies like you, i would not be DLing good old christmas time movies like this.

Merry Christmas."
,2DTV,2009-12-25T08:33Z,"Rames6, I never said it was worse than VHS, we all know how awful they are. Also, my first comment wasn't so much of a complaint, I was simply providing feedback. I know this is an old film, I just thought it was silly putting this torrent up when there are perfectly fine ones around that come with a better picture."
[T],Booster2,2009-12-25T11:06Z,"Well, 2DTV, best of all that shows how you are already is the ""I have Armageddon on a 701 MB file that has the same quality as DVD"" shows that you don't know much of a damn shit and talk only nonsense just for fun. You don't even help the downloaders, you just make a fool of yourself. Admit it, you're a Comment-Faker"
,2DTV,2009-12-25T20:05Z,"You knew EXACTLY what I meant about the quality of the film, I meant that the 701Mb file I have is ""like"" DVD quality. Whatever you want to put it, the Home Alone torrent here just isn't decent quality. I NEVER expected it to be the same as a DVD, but I didn't expect it to turn out all shit and fussy!"
[T],Booster2,2009-12-25T20:27Z,"Nope, your wrong as hell. This is what you've said: ""Actually I just checked my Armageddon film on my laptop, it's 701Mb, about 3 hours long and the picture is the same as on DVD."" So Where did you say LIKE? Oops, you fucked up bad here. ;)"
,2DTV,2009-12-26T18:28Z,"As I said before, I meant ""like"", not same as. But it doesn't even matter, what matters is the fact it is a perfectly done film, with no faults whatsoever. Compare your shite Home Alone 2 to another torrent and you'll see that yours is.... total shite.

But anyways, I have no time for this. I have better things to do. Might go download 2012, not perfect quality, but at least it's better than this shit! See ya cock sucker ;)"
[T],Booster2,2009-12-27T10:57Z,Ok. Get the fuck out here then. Moron.
[T],Booster2,2009-12-30T17:50Z,"I know you're here, 2DTV. Go and fuck somewhere else. Fucking idiot."
,impoor,2010-01-01T12:12Z,"This rip is fine, what one would expect from a 700 MB rip. Personally i like the 700 MBish rips. If i wanted a better rip i would d/l the multi gig HD version.  "
,hirstey,2010-01-26T01:41Z,"Booster2 you are way too sensitive, who gives a fuck what people think. You uploaded which I thank you for, if someone has an issue with it fuck em!"
[T],Booster2,2010-01-26T07:44Z,I like to irritate them. ;)
,ottohess,2010-05-29T22:59Z,Tsss tsss tsss. I'll give this one a try - just for the conversations above - lol.
,celerity21,2010-06-13T02:07Z,its actually not that bad mate. cheers.
,Pr0Sieeb,2010-08-06T23:04Z,"hha 2dtv , joking with a green skull , i""ll believe you booster :) "
,lilkiss,2010-09-22T06:37Z,thanks
,nicko7,2011-12-24T01:40Z,"@Booster2 Who cares what that fag says, I say this is a good torrent, thanks for the upload :P"
