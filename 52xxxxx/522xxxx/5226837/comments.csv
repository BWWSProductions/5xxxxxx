It opens a folder called ""bottle-gf-drunk"" inside which is the real file ""BOOZED_GF.wmv"".

It's a 5mn movie which in my opinion isn't that interesting (a poor orgy with a call-girl, I suppose).

Another file called ""pcs.r01"" which must be unzipped also contains pictures and links to some websites.

All that should have been said by the ""anonymous"" author of this torrent..."
