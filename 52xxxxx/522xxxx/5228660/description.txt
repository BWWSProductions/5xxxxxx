Ruudi (6), a devoted Viking-fan, lives with his single mother in a coastal fisherman's village. One day an exact scale model of an ancient Viking ship makes a pleasure trip nearby, but unfortunately only fathers with sons are allowed on board. Sailors tell Ruudi to return next time, but where could he possibly find a father so quickly?
Inspired by beauty contests, Ruudi organises the Big Father Contest with the award being Ruudi himself, his mother, and the mysterious Viking treasure.


Lugu vÃ¤ikesest Ruudist, kes isadele-poegadele mÃµeldud viikingireisile pÃ¤Ã¤semiseks korraldab isa leidmise konkursi, mille auhinnaks on tema ise, tema ema ja muinasjutuline viikingivarandus.
