Nostradamus Effect - S01E09 - Satan's Army
Airdate 11/11/2009

Less than 100 years after the birth of Christ, John the Apostle received a terrifying vision of Satan's final war against God--a horrific account of death and destruction that will bring about the end of human history. Heavy with symbolism, the prophecy describes a woman riding a monster with seven heads, and a Lamb releasing Four Horsemen that bring conquest, war, famine, and death. What has experts frightened is that many of the events that set the stage for Satan's rampage have already come true. Satan's wrath will be poured out upon the world in a series of cataclysms--earthquakes, pandemics, famine, and pestilence. What follows will be a massive battle with Satan's legion in a quest for world domination. All signs point to this occurring in our lifetime, a prophecy echoed by Nostradamus. Are we about to suffer the horrors of the Apocalypse?
