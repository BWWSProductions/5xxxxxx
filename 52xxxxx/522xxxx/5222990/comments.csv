Normalizing is something you do when you have files from different recordings and want them to sound equally loud at playback. Flac do NOT alter the relative level or the dynamics in a recording."

This is why I prefer Apple Lossless..."
,elektrostatisk,2009-12-20T21:08Z,"Sorry, still, flac is a compression format (like zip), it DOES NOT alter the level (volume) or the musical dynamic. If the sound is too low in a flac file (what is ""too low"" anyway, why not use the volume control that every playback equipment has?) it is because it was low in the original file. The apple/wma/ape lossless performs in an identical way (in this respect). They just compress the size of the file but DO NOT remove any data or alter the sound. This is very easy to confirm, just rip a song from a CD and compress it with flac/wma/ape (easy done with dBpowerAMP) and listen if you can hear any difference in level. I am pretty confident you wonÂ´t :-)

[V],LosslessDude,2009-12-22T19:23Z,"I do stand corrected....

I just did some testing and the waveform is held perfectly....  

I guess every recording studio just uses different volume levels!

Regardless I normalize all mine before I chose to convert into aac or mp3 so all my itunes have the maximum volume possible... : )"

Thanks for the up peck1234."
