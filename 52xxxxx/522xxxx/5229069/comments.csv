,porlock3,2010-02-22T04:24Z,"In case you're wondering: ""In Man"" is just an abbreviation for Incest Maniado (this movie is also called Maniado 2)

There is some damage to this file at 1:25:22 . I tried to find a clean copy using other variants of the name and also via ED2k, all different sources, and they all had the same damage.  Either this rip has been propagating (along with the damage) all over the place or there's something wrong with the original source.

It would be great to find a clean copy somewhere; I happen to find the activity there (or what SEEMS to be the activity there) interesting."
