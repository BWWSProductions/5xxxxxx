From the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team (F.A.R.T.) comes this excellent quality video with the original soundtrack restored! As you probably know, DVD's of season two of The Fugitive were released with a completely new, synthesized music score which destroyed much of the show's drama. Now, thanks to the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team, you can enjoy the show in top quality as it was originally intended to be experienced.
