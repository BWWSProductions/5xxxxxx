,sakinobashi,2010-02-05T02:25Z,"it's a great collection, but unfortunately i found more than a couple of songs that had the last 2 seconds clipped, as well as quite a few 128Kbps tracks on the original ""the fake sound of progress"" album (the reason I downloaded this, by the way).

this was close to being a great download, but i ended up having to check all songs for issues and deleting quite a few in the process. i did get most of what i wanted though, so thanks!"
