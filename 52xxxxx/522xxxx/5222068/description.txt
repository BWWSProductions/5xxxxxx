"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side" is an upcoming hour-long episode of the FOX animated series Family Guy and the sequel episode to the Star Wars parody "Blue Harvest", to be followed by the future spoof of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi currently named "We Have A Bad Feeling About This". It will retell the story of Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back as "Blue Harvest" did with Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope[3], recasting characters from Family Guy into roles from the film. It was originally scheduled to air as the 7th season finale,[4] but has been pushed back to season 8.[5] Like the previous installment, the poster for "Dark Side" is based on the design of an actual Star Wars poster.
