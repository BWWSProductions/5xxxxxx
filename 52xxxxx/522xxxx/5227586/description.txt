Reminiscent of the 2001 Dos Palmas incident, Linwoodâ€™s trip to paradise with his wife is suddenly shattered when guerrillas take control of a secluded five-star resort asking for a substantial ransom. The guerrilla leaders begin murdering hostages as the clock ticks away, forcing Joe to use his expert skills to save the hostages from certain death.
