Radio anthems, ballads, epics, this EP has it all compacted into 4 ass-kicking tracks. The award winning In The Face of Anger EP brought the New England based band recognition form all parts of the globe. 

"Certainly the opening cut, "In The Face Of Anger", will leave you breathless with it's huge stomp riffs and gang chants. But beyond that comes a dramatic sense of melody and understanding. The clean vocals are the perfect addition, almost playing the part of the calm eye in the hurricane. Next track, "Faithless", is easily one of the best songs of the year. The hook here is the fantastic piano sound, mixed in with amazing clean pop singing that moves into a more aggressive stance through the chorus parts."
