Release Notes:

What is a lytic anyways? Aside from one of the two
cycles of viral production (high school biology,
anyone?), Andrew Sannie, Anthony Sannie, Mungala
Londe and Gavin Kalansky are The Lytics. The group
has been playing its brand of smooth hip-hop from
the south end of the city since 2003. The Lyticsâ€™s
beats are effortless in their flow and rhythmic in
their execution, a showcase of how hip-hop should
sound. Whatâ€™s refreshing is that they donâ€™t sing
about stereotypical hip-hop themes like money,
bitches and hos. Thatâ€™s not to say they donâ€™t sing
about girls or parties, but they craft rhymes about
love without being abrasive, sexist and
unnecessarily profane, which allows them to appeal
to a broad audience. The Lytics are a rare gem in
the city and some may be surprised that theyâ€™re
even from Winnipeg. They produce high-calibre
hip-hop that even a 20-year-old white suburbanite
from St. James who listens to Fall Out Boy can
enjoy.
