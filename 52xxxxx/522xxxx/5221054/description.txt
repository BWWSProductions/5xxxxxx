Eyes Of Infliction further ignites the fusion of all forms of rock into one. A collection of songs for the true rock and roll connisseur, Shattersphere once again showcases how a vast array of influences can be arranged into structurally uncompromised rock anthems. 

"While bands like Linkin Park and Disturbed struggle with the same scenario album after album, Shattersphere have found a way to take that formula and remake it, to sort of bend and mold it into a whole new portal, a brand new vision that is a driving force."
