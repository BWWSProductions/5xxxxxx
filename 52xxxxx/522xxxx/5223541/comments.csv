Has anyone else tested it yet? 
jira.boxee.tv is another location to report problems."

,yifanlu,2009-12-18T04:56Z,"@nomaddna, umm you know that this is for OSX not Windows right?"
,kjell123agd,2009-12-18T12:18Z,"Has anyone got this running? It installed no problem, I registered at boxee.tv for an account and as soon as I loaded Boxee, (poof) she be gone very much like what I would expect to happen if the author's are using a call home feature to disable (unauthorized) versions. 

Any feedback would be appreciated."
,yifanlu,2009-12-18T13:26Z,It works for me 100% (except for a few bugs here and there). What's your system specs? How long does it stay up before it crashes? Could anything else be the cause?

Thanks for the reply. I have a iMac 2.16 Intel Core Duo with 1gig 667 MHz ddr2 sdram 10.4.11 Tiger.

Obviously the problem is at my end if you can run it no problem. Secondly, I've had the monitor distort and freeze up on me every time as it's loading the home screen. 

Maybe I should try the previous version and see if that works. "
,yifanlu,2009-12-19T19:13Z,"@kjell123agd, yea I think the problem is either Tiger or too little RAM, because Boxee is very memory intensive. I'm running Snow Leopard on an iMac and I've managed to run it 2 hours without crashing (watching various shows)."

Intel Mac Mini, OS X 10.6.2."
,dtdickman,2009-12-27T01:52Z,Works great for me! Thank you!
,funforus,2010-01-07T00:54Z,This version is pretty awesome compared to the last!  Now it just needs to go 64-bit...
