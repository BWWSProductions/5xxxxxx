                                Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Just a standard DVD rip of the flick, encoded to fit on a 1G flash drive.
Also converted the flash video "Hot Chicks on Bikes", the short set to a
portion of "Girls Like That" by "Weird War".
 I have wanted one of the IFTM T-shirts /posters from the movie's premiere, but
it's pretty clear that anyone who got one is holding onto them. Until I can
track one down, I've upsized and kinda cleaned the GIFs available on the net
using the GIMP, but tried to retain the "home-screened" roghness of the
original print. Saved the primary image on a transparent background in PNG 
format, so you can use it to get your neighborhood  T-Shirt maker, Cafe Press,
etc, to screen your own. If you happen to have access to one of the originals,
would you consider scanning it and making a torrent?

PS
I forgot to mention, if anybody has a copy of the last episode of "Man Alive" (with the three devils posing as old men), I'd sure appreciate you posting it.
