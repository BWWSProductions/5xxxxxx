Unlike most website download tools, our website downloader program will copy websites to your disk, and not store websites using a proprietary database format. As all links get corrected to relative file paths, you can copy and take the downloaded websites with you anywhere, and later view them offline in any browser. Our website copier software can download large websites with many thousands of pages, and includes options for configuring download speed, e.g. through usage of simultaneous connections. Control which files to crawl and which to download using include and exclude filters. Website download and login through most post form user/password systems is also supported. The website downloader understands all kinds of references including redirects, frames, javascripts and images. It is also able to correctly convert links in CSS and most javascript files. You can even scan and download websites from multiple start paths, useful if content in a website is not crosslinked.
