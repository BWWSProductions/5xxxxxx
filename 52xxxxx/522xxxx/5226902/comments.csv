,xxxyyyzzzus,2010-08-24T16:10Z,"Friends , I downloaded this and found the print ""EXTRARDINARILY GOOD"" - but thats the usual blue ray rip. 
I had one problem - it always gpt stuck at one point when I played it via WD Live Media Player. The point is when the team run into theater after  trying their first heist at a bank and Warren screams at the petrol bunk guy....There is no voice from this scene on. 
how ever this scene plays fine on VLCC on laptop. Any suggestions?
Sorry to write a huge comment."
