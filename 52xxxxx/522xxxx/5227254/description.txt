Wikipedia - Fantasy Ride is the 3rd studio album by American R&B singer Ciara. Featured guests on the album include Justin Timberlake, Ludacris, Chris Brown, Young Jeezy, The-Dream, Missy Elliott and T-Pain. In the US, the album debuted and peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Internationally, the album charted in the top 10 in the UK & Ireland. The album's first single in the US is R&B/Hip-Hop Charts top ten hit "Never Ever", featuring Young Jeezy. The international lead single and US second single is the worldwide hit "Love Sex Magic", with Justin Timberlake which would later go on to receive a nomination for Best Choreography at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The album's third single "Like A Surgeon" reached 59 on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart without an official release date, whilst the final single "Work" was released in international markets reaching top 40 in Ireland and Sweden but only 52 in the UK before being pulled from radios.
Fantasy Ride also introduces Ciara's comic book character, "Super C". Ciara said that Super C is her "inner strength and aggressive persona". The Super C character is set to become a major factor in Fantasy Ride promotion. She is a futuristic, superhero-esque Ciara, loosely based on the robotic character Ciara portrayed in the "Go Girl" music video. DC Comics artist Bernard Chang helped Ciara create the character for the album artwork. Ciara said she worked on the artwork about nine months to a year.[13] On April 5, her official website posted the new album covers (purple Super C for the standard edition, red Super C for the deluxe edition). Speaking on the images, Ciara stated, "Super C" is my super hero name. It's who I am. It's the inner strength and drive that enables me to overcome any obstacles and who I have to be in order to accomplish my dreams and survive in this tough world." Her official website confirmed that in North America the album will feature the super hero covers whereas international markets will receive the human cover featuring Ciara on a faded white background.
