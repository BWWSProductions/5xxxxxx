Hello everybody!

This is the final Cosmic Refractions of the year and I personally think some of the best breaks I've ever heard have been released this year, and I'm very excited about all the new producers and labels that have sprung up in 2009 - big things for 2010! This month there have been some wonderful progressive breaks tunes released by some of the top names in the business - all of which make up the first half of my set. Some exclusive remixes you might not have heard before from Abdomen Burst, Retroid and Karton. There's also one forthcoming on Digital Sensation UK from Llupa which will be released early in the new year. Towards the middle, all these gorgeous melodic tunes begin to delve a bit deeper into the sound of wonderfully twisted technology, before leading out with some old-skool influenced electro and harder bassline tracks. I hope you have enjoyed the series so far this year and it will of course continue throughout 2010 and I hope you can all listen along once again. Enjoy!

All tracks featured in the mix are (or will be soon) available at all your favourite download stores so please support the artists/labels/remixers if you like what you hear.

Last month I included the Oleg Zubkov remix of "Mystery" by Pavel Denisov which went down rather well - you can now purchase this (plus the original and Helbot remix) from all stores as well 

If you enjoy this and fancy more of the same (although with a completely different tracklisting!) I will be Retroid's guest on his awesome show "Revive!" this Sunday (20th Dec) on Proton Radio 9-11am GMT.
