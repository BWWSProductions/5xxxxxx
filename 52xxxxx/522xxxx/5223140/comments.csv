,x33hacks,2009-12-18T15:54Z,I like your uploads the h264 quantization is good but could you upload the files in  around 700 mb to 1 gbs   the m4v is good ie the video bit rate of say 800 kb/s 
,csproba,2009-12-28T07:50Z,"The audio is slightly delayed (800ms)
with the VLC player you can undelay it(options/player/key/audio delay -10ms), but every time , when you start the video, you have to do it again.

Nice V. quality."
