Produced by Rusty Santos, the New York mixer behind Animal Collective and Panda Bear's albums, Red, Yellow & Blue exemplifies the Ruffians' brand of self-described 'hootin and hollarin'. From start to finish it's a good time, and the band knows it. With songs like the jangly ''Hedonistic Me'' and the sugary sweet ''Foxes Mate for Life'' to the foot stomping ''Badonkadonkey'', the band constantly pushes the boundaries of musical arrangements.
