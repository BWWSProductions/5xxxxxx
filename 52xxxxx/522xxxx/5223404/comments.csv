,GreenMac,2009-12-18T17:39Z,Be aware: The CD's are not divided into tracks. Each CD comes as a single flac file with a cue sheet. It will take forever to extract single tracks if that is what you want.

,BeatleTom,2010-10-20T16:52Z,"Hi Guys,

To extract the files to your hard drive, use

MEDIEVAL CUE SPLITTER.

It will easily extract the individual flac files from the single flac file that you have downloaded. It is a free program. Works with Windows 7. Keeps the file names. It's free:

Man, that's a lotta disco - even for me (and I'm a fan) !

Thanks to the original uploader.  And thanks to all the seeders that have kept this a fast moving torrent.

,IOWBOY,2011-10-18T14:19Z,"If Ur gonna dload italo, make it this one. FLAC quality is excellent. Winamp plays it, so does WMP with plug-in (do a search) and numerous others. Best listened to on a decent sound system. I've heard more sonic range in this dload than ever before. Why do some people bother with bit rates of 192kbps or less? Great on my COWON personal media player (yes, it plays flac files no problem...aural orgasm!). Why bother sharing anything other than lossless. FLAC, ALAC, etc. Many thanx to the original uploader, stuff here I've wanted for years. Keepseeding fellow italo lovers!!!!"
