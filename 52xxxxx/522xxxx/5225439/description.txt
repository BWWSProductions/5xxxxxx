From the Director of Raging Bull and GoodFellas

Based on a true story. Boxcar Bertha is a spellbinding tale of
railroad renegades and runaway romance. Bristling with energy
and the raw, "sensual" performances of Barbara Hershey and David
Carradine, the film delivers a "humor and warmth" that's on track!

Free-spirited Bertha (Hershey) is a smalltime crook with a "love 'em
and leave 'em" philosophy...until she falls hard for a union man - and 
Robin-Hood-of -the-rails- Big Bill Shelly (Carradine). Stealing from the
rich and giving to the workers, Bertha and Bill soon become the most 
nortorious train robbers in the South. But as their crimes grow more 
brazen, the law grows more ruthless, and the duo discovers that their
lifetime of larceny may have bought them a one=way ticket...to a deadly
destination.
