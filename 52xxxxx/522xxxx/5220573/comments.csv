,dinosaur58,2010-12-15T11:54Z,"Gee Whiz Toerings it's a Christmas movie. Try to have some Christmas spirit. Sure there are always lame noobs, but relax. Also you forgot to rate the movie - the main reason for leaving comments.
This is a Full Screen version. The colorization is early, so not up to modern standards [limited color palette, somewhat sepia toned]. The Video quality is standard 'old film' noise: slightly flickery grainyness + some mild scratches and specks. The Audio is clear, but not true Stereo. Actually 2 Channel converted Mono - both channels carry identical sound. I haven't downloaded it yet, but you may want to go for the CiNEFiLE BluRay version even if it is 4.4Gb
