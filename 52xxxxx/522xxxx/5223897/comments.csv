,b9AcE,2009-12-18T18:50Z,"The expansion is only 14.75 MB if downloaded through GamersGate (Paradox' own distribution service).
The demo, which is standalone but does not allow savegames and is otherwise very limited as well, but is standalone, is only 266 MB.
So what this would be at 183.56 MB, would be weird.

It adds lots of crap ads to game.
I lost my saves and game start lagging.
Better download normal clear addon and game."
