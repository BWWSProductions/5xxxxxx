VirTool:Win32/DelfInject.gen!AF

file:\windows-7-secrets.rar->windows-7-secrets.exe

VirTool:Win32/DelfInject.gen!AF is a generic detection for files that inject malicious code in running processes. The malicious code is usually encrypted, and is decoded before it is loaded into memory. The malicious code may be injected into a clean process or loaded as a new process of its own.

VirTool:Win32/DelfInject.gen!AF checks if it is running on a virtual environment, and may not perform its malware routines if this is found to be the case."
