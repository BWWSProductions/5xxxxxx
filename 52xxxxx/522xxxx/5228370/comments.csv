,afgaviria,2009-12-19T20:35Z,"thats crap! is perfect the way it is, thanks @hjsn1."
[T],hjsn1,2009-12-19T20:43Z,"Captain_Ron: OK, here we go again. The movies are straight from a DVD. I don't add or remove subs. If you want more subs then you're gonna have to either do a lot of work or download one of the divx copies and convert it to play on your DVD player. Its up to you."
,muzikphan,2009-12-20T11:29Z,"Thanks a lot for this up.
I have one question though.
If this is a DVD9, then why the encoding?

""+Video- CCE Encoded - 5 passes""

Cheers."
[T],hjsn1,2009-12-20T18:07Z,"muzikphan: you know, I was just thinking and all of the DVD9's that i've done have this on it as well. I just use a wordpad document that I have saved and edit the things that need edited and I guess I overlook that because I don't have to change it every time. Good catch."
,trentmac12,2009-12-20T20:10Z,"hey hjsn1 .. would it be possible to upload ""the patriot"" great movie and id love to have it"

Looking forward to more of your releases.

[T],hjsn1,2009-12-27T18:02Z,neli00: I believe it was but I didn't put the second one up because I have a whole bunch more and I was running out of room on my 500 GB hard drive.
,Stress_Test,2009-12-30T05:46Z,"I just bought and watched the latest Terminator with my 2 kids and they were lost. I discovered that they had never seen the first 2 of the series.

,folloyerinstinx,2010-01-15T08:00Z,"I just tried playing the VOB files in VLC. As much as I appreciate the up, the files in this torrent are all kinds of screwed up. Some of them jump back and forth in quick bursts, and at least two of them have the director's comments on them. WTF?"
