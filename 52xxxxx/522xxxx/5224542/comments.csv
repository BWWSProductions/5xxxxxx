,Critic_101,2009-12-18T18:58Z,Alrighty i have a ps3  connected to a 1080p lcd flat screen but no 5.1 just stereo connected to a subwoofer I have 5.1 but thats hooked up to my dvd player. i'm downloading ur district 9 upload and will check if soft subs work or not could take a while before the file downloads so patience is a virtue. If u got files u want to check for ps3 that be stereo or virtual  surround i.e 5.1 from two spks that i can do.  I'm pissed at kingdom secret myth for misleading downloaders coz his rip of the hurt locker did not work on the ps3 and my pc wont even play it coz of high res he used. So all you who want to watch it on ps3 don't download his version its not compatible with ps3 plus a big file 1.40gb almost took long time downloadin and then wouldnt even work is just nerve wreckin. I don't lnow how u do it but  ur hig res work just fine on the ps3 miss roses thanx for them good high res that are ps3  playable.
,Critic_101,2009-12-18T19:06Z,Oh and those audio issues that iwas having are coz of non compatibility between samsung and ps3 hdmi issues. Hope sony releases a firmware fix for this coz its not right to pay so much and have such a minor thing ruin ur visual and aduio experience!!! Sony gat a damn fix out soon its's not just me but alot of people with ps3's having this trouble not just with samsung lcds but also with certain sony lcd tvs also just google it too find out.
,Critic_101,2009-12-18T21:07Z,Yes thats the one! its does not work with my ps3 which is updated to the latest firmware ur files on the other hand all work even ur HR stuff! Sound is got to do with compatibility issues not ur files. Hdmi handshake problems between the two devices my sound comes through the aux for external spks of my samsung telly. It's not just me alot of people have hdmi issues with their ps3 and telly. I think the other kingdom release i tried and which did not work also was Basic Instinct not sure if it was ripped by I think it was. but hurt locker is confirmed does not work with ps3 there was some other guy also who left a comment that his ps3 sould also not play it not on tpb but some other torrent site google it to find other torrents for his rip. plus the sample worked so I thought other guy was just being silly but when I tried the complete downloaded file it did not play on the ps3. If u need to test sumthin for the ps3 i also got that. like soft subs for psp or sumthin. 
,Critic_101,2009-12-18T21:12Z,Correction for my last post I meant if u want to test sumthin for the psp also that is soft subs e.tc. 
,Critic_101,2009-12-18T22:29Z,just started downloading district 9 HR will let you know once fin if it plays with subs.
,Critic_101,2009-12-18T22:59Z,don't know what you mean I have an avi or xivid which has soft subs that work just fine with the ps3 used xsub to add the subs no problem with the subs can disable it from menu and enable them at any time during viewing. If your comment was meant for .mp4 format then maybe coz have not yet played one that had soft subs. but otherwise soft subs do work so to say they dont at all is not right.
,Critic_101,2009-12-18T23:06Z,I think i have a file with dual audio tracks one is a foreign language which is the main and the other is a secondary one which is in english will see if it works with ps3 and if can change between tracks from the menu audio option.
,Critic_101,2009-12-18T23:18Z,well if u do a test file keep it small of abt 5 to 10 min should be fin coz it be quicker to download and give feed back quickly.
