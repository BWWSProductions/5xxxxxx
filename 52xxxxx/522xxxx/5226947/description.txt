At the heart of the popularity of such spiritual teachers as Eckhart Tolle and Ken Wilber lies the spirit and intellectual passion
of the seminal teacher who inspired them allâ€”Alan Watts. Now, in response to our run-away bestselling audio collection Out of
Your Mind, Sounds True is proud to present one of Alan Wattsâ€™ most extraordinary learning sessions.
Listeners will delight in hearing Alan Watts at his finest as he guides them with humor, deep insight, and startling wisdom into a
genuine understanding of how the grand, exuberant Self plays the game of living through us, and vice versa. With rare guided
meditations taught by Watts himself, Do You Do It or Does It Do You? is an essential audio seminar with one of the true
pioneers of Western spirituality.
