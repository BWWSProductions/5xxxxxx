Numbers-obsessed Sarah "Saz" Paley (Bionic Woman's Michelle Ryan) has just married her perfect man. Or so she thought. She believed hunky doctor Dan (Krod Mandoon's Sean Maguire) was her Mister Eleven--the eleventh man she'd slept with thus statistically her perfect man--but he wasn't.

During their wedding reception Saz comes face-to-face with an old flame (Britannia High's Adam Garcia) who informs her that when she thought they'd drunkenly made love she'd actually just passed out--meaning that Dan wasn't, mathematically speaking, the right man for her.

An emotional rollercoaster ensues as she doubts her marriage and lusts over Alex, the-man-that-could-have-been. Unsurprisingly, her new husband is less than amused and their relationship soon breaks down, leaving Saz with a tough decision--should she try to make things work with Dan, or pursue her true Mister Eleven?
