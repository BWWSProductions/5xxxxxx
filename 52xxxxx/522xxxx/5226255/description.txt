GUNS N' ROSES ROCK AM RING Rockpalast June 2nd, 2006
NÃ¼rburgring - Eifel, Germany 

This is a VERY GOOD DVD rip from a 4.2 GB DVD to a 703mb xvid. (I followed a guide (PAKG) on how to rip like AXXO) This is the WHOLE concert from start to finish when GNR take their final bow. The concert runs 88mins.
Unlike my previous upload of the concert: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5186166/Guns_N__Roses_LIVE_Rockpalast_2006_DVD_rip  that was ripped from a DVD featuring this June 2nd concert but also songs from other concerts, this Rip was from a DVD of just this June 2nd, 2006 Concert. It is the entire June 2nd concert, in order and I think ripped a bit better. ENJOY. And please seed! Thanks! By: wildbill666
