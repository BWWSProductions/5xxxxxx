Greek Ollendorff
It is a wonderful book of attic/ancient greek.It is a progressive book,grammar is well explained.It has many examples that are translated.I like this feature because when you are a beginner you want to be sure that you understand the sentences and grammar correctly,especially if you learn it by yourself like me.Another thing that i really like is the thing that vocabulary is repeated many times in different contexts and words are learned easily.
I began to work with this book this winter and i have enjoyed working with it so far.It is really a good book .I hope it will be a blessing for you too.
