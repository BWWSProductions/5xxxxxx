This was a cassette-only mixtape done for Sleepy Bird Orphanage records (www.sleepybirdorphanage.com) -- I'm used to having 80 minutes to work with on a CD, or 2-4 hours to work with during a live set; it was quite an interesting challenge trying to condense things down to roughly 17 minutes per side for this project.
