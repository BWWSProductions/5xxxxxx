[T],eyezin,2009-12-29T23:33Z,"Mounting the disk lets your OS access the data on it. You need a virtual drive to mount the image (ISO). You could burn it to a disk in which case it will auto mount the disk once inserted into the drive.  Don't just burn the iso onto a disk, you need to create a disk from image. "

,MmeM,2010-12-27T15:23Z,"I haven't downloaded this one, but I know it's not gonna work for Mac. The Mac-Game in the title just says that it's also a mac game, but this is not the mac release, it's the pc release. I wish eyezin would make that more clear though."
