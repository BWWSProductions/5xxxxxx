Only the Master, a man devoted to truth, and Margarita, the woman he loves, can resist the devil's onslaught. Written in the 1930s, with many digs at life under Stalin, the novel was not published until 1967. One of the most famous and bestselling Russian novels of the 20th century. "Rhind-Tutt gives a decidedly Cockney spin to his narration. But he also gives it mischief, invention, and unflagging energy... a fine reading of an important book."

The dextbook does not match the audio word-by-word and nor do the chapter titles. Still, it is not a problem.


A note by the uploader:
I've done great work in cutting this book by chapters - somewhere else on the web you can find only a lumped-joint version. The textbook is also edited.

There are also some more chaptered and organised books among my uploads - check them out!
