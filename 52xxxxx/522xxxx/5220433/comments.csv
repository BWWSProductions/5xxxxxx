All fixed!"
[T],Kajirae_melantha,2010-03-04T05:36Z,check the included nfo file on where to get subs
,kamon3169,2011-03-06T23:21Z,"The subs arn't working anymore.
I could only find them for episode 1.
Any suggestions?"
[T],Kajirae_melantha,2011-05-26T07:36Z,look on the .nfo file (open with notepad) it tells you where you can find subs for ALL three episodes
