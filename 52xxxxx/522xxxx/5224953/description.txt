Release Notes:

Fashion Bomb has released their sophomore record, â€œVisions of the Lifted Veilâ€.
The new album is produced by Raymond Herrera (Fear Factory/ Arkaea) and Jeremy
Blair (Guns-n-Roses, Cypress Hill), and recorded at Temple Studios in Los
Angeles, CA. Tom Baker (Marilyn Manson, NIN, Rob Zombie) of Precision Mastering
mastered the songs. With a flair for thinking about the world in large,
universal terms and influenced by George Orwell, Stephen Hawking, Hunter S.
Thompson and Carl Sagan, Fashion Bomb takes on complex ideas. This 13 track work
of art is a mature, well structured record that showcases the bandâ€™s amazing
musical skill, as well as their ability to write accessible, memorable songs.
