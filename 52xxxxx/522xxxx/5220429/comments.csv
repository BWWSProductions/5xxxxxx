Is it possible to try to crack a software called  devFus     versione 1.01a ?
The Homepage Link.. is http://www.devcad.com/ita/download.htm 
Its a FANTASTIC little program 12.9 MB for design fuselages for radiocontrol airplanes. The most amazing thing is that from the design the program can make the various sections and also the 3d fuselage and also the jig that support the fuselage during the construction.
I am sure that many persons out there are interesting regarding programs like this. You can use this program but without the possibility of saving or printing the results.
If you can make a crack it would be wonderfull because there are not free programs like that out there.
Best regards
Giovanni
