,Bhallspawn,2009-12-17T13:44Z,"Im not sure if it works or not cause guy who posted is prolly rus and doesn't explain very well, while crack removes serial protection i keep getting ""use of emulation sofwere detected"" when i mount his mini image in latest deamon tools lite, as it doesnt work in deamon tools pro..so im basicly clueles how to remove securerom protecion, any ideas? His way of disabling all drives but virtual wich has mini image mounted doesnt work."

,Ska8ter,2009-12-20T11:23Z,"disabling the cd/dvd drive does not work, but...
has anyone tried burning the mini image to a cd and trying with that ? I am unable to do so since my rom just broke.

I'm getting a new one on thuesday but i'm curious if using a cd with the mini image might work."
,atta_trol,2009-12-21T12:56Z,it's fake just because game needs no disc. It's barbaric online activation worse than spore has.
