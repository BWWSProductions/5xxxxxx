True it is not in the IMDB."
,stemoss,2009-12-22T18:06Z,WTF?!
,CSuk,2009-12-22T21:46Z,"Excellent quality. This is purely a 35 minute promo advert for the UbiSoft game of the same name follow up, Assassins Creed 2. So unless your'e going to play the game('s) you'll probably have no interest in downloading this at all as there is only a beginning, a middle but NO ending...that is left up to you in the game itself (if you buy it that is)."
,Mrpushpin,2009-12-23T00:02Z,"Good, Thanks.

Info: 35min Assassins Creed Video

,cybersteel8,2010-10-12T15:11Z,"""The first episode was released on YouTube on October 26, 2009, though it was announced for the 27th, and it was showcased on YouTube homepage in eight different countries. It was also released on EuroGamerTV on November 2, 2009.[1] The second and the third parts of the Lineage were released on YouTube on November 12, 2009. The complete film was released two days later.""

-- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed:_Lineage

What I take from this is that the three episodes of Lineage were eventually released as an entire short-movie with running time of 36 minutes. That's why it's one file, and that's why it's not large. I'll download it and let you all know if it's legit."
,cybersteel8,2010-10-16T07:57Z,"Excellent torrent! This seems to be the DVD release of the mini-series, so there are no interruptions. Definitely worth a quick watch.
