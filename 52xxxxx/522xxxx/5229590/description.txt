Wikipedia Review â€“ Aaliyah is the self-titled third studio album by American singer Aaliyah, released by Blackground and Virgin Records on July 17, 2001 (see 2001 in music) in the United States. It was primarily produced by Keybeats, with additional production by Timbaland, Bud'da, Jeffrey "J-Dub" Walker and Static Major, and lyrics by Static Major and Missy Elliott.
The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, number one on the R&B charts and was certified gold four weeks (platinum within six weeks) after its release: While it sold over 250,000 in its first week. A few weeks after its release, Aaliyah quickly jumped from #19 to #1 with sales of 305,000 beating Mary J. Blige and Slipknot from the top spot.[1] The album sold over 4 million copies in the United States, and 12 million copies worldwide to date. It was also nominated for a 2002 Grammy Award for Best R&B Album among many other awards. Physical copies of the album are out of print in the United States, but there have been rumors that the album is slated for a special edition tenth anniversary re-release in 2011. The album spent a total of 188 weeks on the Billboard 200. As of October 2009, this album is currently 2x Platinum. In April 2001, Aaliyah spoke highly of the album stating "It is Her version of Control".[

Amazon.com's Best of 2001 â€“ Review By Jake Barnes - Seven years after her debut at just 15 years old, Aaliyah assembled a third studio album that was astonishingly mature. Sadly, her death just a little over a month after its release stilled a promising voice in R&B. At 22, when most artists would just be getting started, Aaliyah had already progressed from pop to street to an unconventional retro-modern, risk-taking version of R&B. While lead track "We Need a Resolution" is as mainstream as it gets, there are fewer hits on this album than on previous efforts. Instead, this collection is an extraordinary romantic exposition of passion and pain. While Missy Elliott is cranking out jams for all her "club freaks," Aaliyah is like a modern-day (if less vocally gifted) Minnie Riperton, exploring the pains of moving from child star to adult sex symbol. Tracks such as "Never No More" and "I Care 4 U" (featuring Missy) are slinky, twisted ballads imbued with film-noir sultriness, as diva Aaliyah steps catlike away from the bubblegum R&B of her contemporaries. There's also the obligatory rock track tacked on near the end ("I Can Be"), but even this excels above the standard hip-hop/rock/R&B crossover fare with its Prince-like influences coupled with Aaliyah's own instinct for seduction. Aaliyah also signaled a move away from her long-standing musical relationship with producer Timbaland, who contributes just three cuts. Having started out heavily supported by R. Kelly, it appeared that Aaliyah was more than able to go it alone.
