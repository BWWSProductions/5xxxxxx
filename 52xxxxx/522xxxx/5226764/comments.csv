Movie had me bored from start to finish. The director, Spike Jonze, clearly forgot this was a movie for kids, about kids from a kids book. It would have had kudo's with adults who have kids had it been made better. Defo one for my Top 10 worst movies of 2009 list.
Creatures were typical of Jim Henson style charaacters and rather reminded me of the 1986 movie, 'Labyrinth'. Nowhere near as good though."
