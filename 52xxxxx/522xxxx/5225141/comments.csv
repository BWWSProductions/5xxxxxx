,Secret_Smile,2009-12-31T10:17Z,"This didn't work for me...I got just past the title screen, entered my name, and then the game closes and an error box pops up saying the game isn't functioning and needs to close.

Maybe it's because I'm using windows 7... "

,mimilou,2010-05-11T06:07Z,"Great torrent! I'm using Win7 and couldn't get the game to lauch at first, but then I did what trxxxpr said and it works just fine! After installing, just open the folder that has been installed and simply rename the application RueMorgue instead of that long name. Thanks Wendys99, I love your games, they always work and are virus free! :)"
,tuskel,2010-05-25T11:48Z,"Hello, I have been downloading your games for quite a long time now, and just wanted to say thanks. There's loads to choose from (and I love HOGs, though they are getting easier and easier, it seems :P) and new ones come up all the time, too. I've never had any problem with them, virus-wise, and as they are precracked, there's no need to fiddle around with crack files. Wonderful! Keep up the good work!

Of course, if you like any game a lot, please consider buying it for real... :) I am a member of BigFish Game Club, when I have some spare money, myself, and I find it good value, since they sell games from other sites at their low price. :) 

Well, enough of the advertising, thanks again for the torrents and please do continue!

Iris, 
sincerely"
