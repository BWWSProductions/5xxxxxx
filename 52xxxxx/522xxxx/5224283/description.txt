Chopin, Brahms, Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Beethoven, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Liszt, Rachmaninoff, AlbÃ©niz, Grieg, Satie, Mozart 


This set of 25 CDâ€™s offers superb quality piano music equally superbly executed by outstanding musicians such as Alfred Brendel, Sviatoslav Richter, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Grimaud, HÃ¥kon AustbÃ¸, Emil Gilels, Yevgeny Kissinâ€¦ and the list goes on.

â€¢ From the classical period onwards very few composers did not write for the piano. For some, like Chopin and Schumann, music for this instrument is at the heart of their output. Both composers are well represented in this collection with a generous three and two CDâ€™s respectively.

â€¢ Of course there are sonatas (by Mozart, Schubert, Beethoven and Schumann), but this set also contains some rather original choices. One CD with Satie gems, another with AlbÃ©nizâ€™s complete Iberia. And even more unusual Lisztâ€™s complete Hungarian Rhapsodies.

â€¢ Because of its repertoire and the outstanding performers The Piano Collection is an excellent choice for both newly â€œrecruitedâ€ music lovers and connoisseurs.
