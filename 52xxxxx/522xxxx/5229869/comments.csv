i deleted all my revious xvid movies and starrt downloading this high quality h.264 videos but as a suggestion i suggest you to rip audio in ogg vorbis format rahter than AAC

*****Graet Work****"
[V],MKVGuy,2009-12-20T16:15Z,sure mate will try OGG in my coming releases.. I tried it once a year back but I was not able to find any difference between both and ACCs are supported by most of the hardware.. 
[T],youssef0eddoumali,2009-12-20T18:36Z,thx in advance
[T],youssef0eddoumali,2009-12-20T18:47Z,"but first of all here is a little technical advice if you are going to use bitrate like 56 or 64 you should prefer the Ogg Vorbis Codec because it's quality is higher at those bitrates especially ,and also at 128 and 192 but for a movie you will not need to go that far with the bitrate but if you choose to encode at 48 then He-AAC aka AAC plus will the absolute choice according to some notorious lab test

i also i uploaded a small tutorial to get people familiar with h.264 encoding experience

*****god bless you****"
[V],MKVGuy,2009-12-20T19:16Z,"thanks for the info and advice Achwaq..

I have been reading a lot about encoding from last 2 years and once I read about a test held for audio codecs where AAC-HE 48 kbps was proved as good as 128 kbps of MP3.. that is why I like it and I am using 56 with a thought that +8 kbps can add more quality to it which is still better of using 128kbps of MP3..

also I have taken your suggestion for OGG 56-64kbps and will definitely implement it soon for my new releases..

Best Regards.."
[T],youssef0eddoumali,2009-12-20T20:15Z,"yes but you should consider if you add 8 to 48
it will add no significant quality in case this will affect the quality because he-AAC will only use PS aka parametric stereo and SBR aka Spectral band replication at only 48 kbps"
[V],pluto999,2009-12-21T08:39Z,dude.. no subtitle?
