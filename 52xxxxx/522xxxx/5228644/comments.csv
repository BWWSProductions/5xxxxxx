,adroklo,2009-12-20T01:12Z,"I registered an account and am writing on this for the first time in the 3+ yrs I've been using this site, just to say this:

If there is anything that gives validity to torrent sharing, it is movies like this. 

I haven't watched it yet, I'm still downloading it, but based on both its summery and how this film's creators have deliberately chosen to market it, I can do nothing more than simply support it.

This is a fundemental idea of New Media now being used for valid reason and with smart promotion.

Please, even if you don't give a shit, just download it and seed it - if nothing else, because it shows support to this entire enterprise and what this technological shift is all about.

Happy holidays!"

,MOK19,2009-12-21T05:03Z,"Excellent short drama, with lots of modern, casual friend-to-friend style humor spread throughout.  There were points where I began wondering, 'Where is this all going, and why am I watching?'  Fortunately the humor (and bare curiosity... bear curiosity?) kept me watching.

By the end, with the drama and experience having played out, I was satisfied...  almost.  The ending felt very unresolved.  All that drama leads up to ... this?  Sort of like someone hanging up the phone on you.

But I knew I was missing something.  After some searching around, I found an excellent review(with full spoilers) that clarified things.  However, I cant seem to link it...

This movie is all about the amorphous, fickle idea of ownership in it's various forms.  Also, contrary to an easy initial impression, it does not legitimize sites like this.  Rather, file-sharing is one of the vehicles of the broader theme.

So, watch this surprisingly deep movie, check the review, and think about it..."

,deckert,2009-12-22T01:03Z,"I think this movie has potential in that there was a story with the girl. However, this completely failed to grab my attention because there really was no conflict at all. I realize that not every film is going to be like a hollywood blockbuster, and being a filmmaker myself I understand how hard it is to write something that has a good message and still makes sense to everyone. I'm not going to lie, I didn't make it past 40 minutes into the movie. There was no reason for me to stay either. Nothing was happening to move the story forward past the point that there are a few guys who hang out, and they share files."
,ZeRaWaKH,2009-12-22T05:23Z,"Seemed promising but I too think that there could've been more of a plot. The file could've been made bigger, say 2,19 GB / 0,5xDVD. There were a lot of dark scenes which would've needed a bit more bits in my opinion."

,Cosades,2009-12-25T14:19Z,"Hey, great movie. I spent 7 years as a film critic, so I might as well give a VERY quick rundown. This is being written for people who have seen the film. It contains a few spoilers.

First, the movie was a fun watch. It did have flow issues, but the real characters and comedy were enough to keep the viewer in the story. 

On a side note, it is great that you're promoting this type of film. Innovation usually comes from the trenches.

Here's what was great. As mentioned earlier, the characters weren't fake at all. You didn't get drawn out of the film for a moment. Some of the minor characters, for instance the smoking girl near the bloodpuke mural, seemed out of place and a bit unnecessary. They weren't necessarily bad actors or anything, but there was no reason for some of them to be there. Other than that, perfect.

The humor was also great. I'm already using ""It's a bear fact"" with my buddies. The curry cum bit was funny too. Keep that real comedy, because even hollywood can't fake that. It needs to be real to be any good.

Last, there was a good central mood to the film. It was a feeling of expression, not just creation, but also sharing those creations. I know it said the same thing in the video's info, but it really is true. Plenty of movies today are good about centralizing their theme, but not their mood.

There were a few things that could be improved. While the writer has a great grasp of character and comedy, the plot could use some work. Let me explain why. First, the main character didn't have a significant change. He did decide to make the video in the end, but that temporary relief of 'creative constipation' was unimportant when Eva came back into his life briefly. It undid all character change. Often, the aspect that changes in the story is the character's most dominant feature. He seemed very timid throughout the film. It would have been good to see him take charge at near the end and have that cause a major plot point, such as getting the girl back.

Also, the montages seemed to have no purpose. I like the music, but they didn't contribute to the story. If every scene has a story-driven purpose, the plot and the flow will be much better.

If any of you did read this, let me know what you think. Also, on the off chance that anyone from the film reads this, I hope it helps... and thank you for a wonderful film."
,ShiroiKarasu,2009-12-26T00:00Z,"I love it!

I love how it's such a real story with real characters. I was feeling very bored and restless when I clicked play, but was left with a nice, calm thoughtfulness after seeing it.

Will donate when I get my hands on a credit card!

Love the way the characters are vulnerable but strong together."
,theshape31,2009-12-26T18:10Z,"This is great, I'll support any grassroots made-for-torrent movie like this.  It's a refreshing break from the general shit-show that is Hollywood.  A big 'thank you' goes out to the cast/crew, Vodo, and hoagster12."
