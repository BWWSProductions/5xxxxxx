Robert DziekaÅ„ski (April 15, 1967â€“October 14, 2007; pronounced [ËˆrÉ”bÉ›rt dÊ‘eËˆkaÉ²ski]) was a Polish immigrant to Canada[2] who died on October 14, 2007 after being tasered five times[3] by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) at Vancouver International Airport.

Full details of the incident came to light because it was filmed by a member of the public, Paul Pritchard. The police initially took possession of the video, refusing to return it to Pritchard. Pritchard went to court to obtain it, then released it to the press.

As of May 2009[update], the Braidwood Inquiry is underway, with public questioning and testimony of individuals involved in the incident.

On June 20, 2009, the proceedings were suspended until September, after it was discovered that an e-mail contained information indicating that the RCMP officers had already determined that they would use tasers even before encountering Dziekanski. This contradicts the officers' testimony that they only decided upon the use of tasers at the last minute
