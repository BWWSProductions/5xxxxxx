,dkporn,2009-12-17T00:16Z,"For all you PS3-TEAM guys, if you want you can also note that your releases work perfectly on the WD TV Live.

Keep up the good work."
,besike,2009-12-18T07:48Z,"nice for a comeback!
thx"
,HeWillSeeTheBigBoard,2009-12-18T16:18Z,"zax, dkporn is right. while i dont have the WD HD TV Live Media Center but rather the WD HD TV Media Center all the .M2TS movies work flawlessly. 

The PS3-team should probably include this in the description since i believe that there are others like me that don't watch them on a pc, mac, ps3 or 360.

Also on a Mac, don't use VLC to play them, it's way too primitive. Use Plex, it seems to play them much better. On a PC, the same, i dont use VLC but rather XBMC.

Anyway good job on the torrents Akamaru! Keep it up!"

,marc3000uk,2009-12-19T13:01Z,"Hi guys. Marc30uk here from the PS3TEAM ;) I didnt bother uploading on here as it was a pain in the arse to register for some reason. Anyway, demonoid is more or less back now.
Im in the middle of building a new PC so ill be back to uploading in the new year.
If anyone is interested, Iv started converting these 1080p rips now to a 4.7gb iso instead of a 4gb m2ts file. They can be burned straight to any standard size blank dvd and they play fine on the PS3 and BLU-RAY Players. You can squize a bit more bit rate into them aswell ;)
Well thats it for now. Have a great xmas.

,dkporn,2009-12-21T07:59Z,"@zax808 - they play as is on the WD TV Live, no changes need to be made. The WD TV Live is just about the most flexible media player there is and supports nearly everything you can throw at it."
