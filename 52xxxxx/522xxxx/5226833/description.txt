    1977. A family is murdered in cold blood. The case goes unsolved for     
    decades and remains a mystery. Enter the present day, detective Lee      
    Southward (Brian Anthony Fabian) is sent on assignment to infiltrate     
    an illegal underground fighting tournament and bring in the              
    organizers. Lee battles his way to the top of the tournaments in         
    attempts to get closer to the organizers. As Lee draws closer and        
    begins to piece clues together he is brought back to the case closed     
    decades ago. However there is a problem: The organizers (led by WWE      
    superstar Brian "blue meanie" Heffron and Darian Caine) are of the       
    undead and crave human blood! Lee must fight his way through all the     
    sex, drugs, and violence of the underground while trying to piece        
    together evidence with the help of an undercover officer (Cheyenne       
    King) and find a way to stop the undead! Loaded with non-stop action
