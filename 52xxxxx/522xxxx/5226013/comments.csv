Black is really black, no Blocky dark scenes, it's not Blurry either, no pixelation, just as clear as the source DVD(7.7 GB).
I first tried to make it 1.5 GB but was not perfect. cheers."

This file has it as a perfect 16:9 which fills up my whole tv-screen without any blackborders. It is the first feature film (of this age, before widescreen-tvs) that I have seen in this format. Also, imdb says it should be 1.85:1 so. . 
I think this release is malformed, although very watchable."
