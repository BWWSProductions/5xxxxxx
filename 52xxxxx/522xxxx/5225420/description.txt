Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bersen) is a rich and successfull
Beverly Hills dentist. In fact, he is so much more---a fine
connoisseur of music, the owner of a palatial mansion, and 
the proud husband of a beautiful wife. There's only one 
problem- he's insane. Dr. Feinstones loves perfection and he
expects if of everyone. Unfortunately, no one is perfect. This
unacceptable fact annoys the good doctor and leads him to commit
his one small imperfection: Murder. Murder is so messy, and Dr. 
Feinstone hates messes. But sometimes he just can't help killing
a patient or two.
