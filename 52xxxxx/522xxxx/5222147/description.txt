Xpadder is a program that has the ability to emulate a mouse and/or keyboard using a controller or joystick. This is primarily used for playing games with poor or no controller support, but Xpadder can be used in a web browser, media player, or almost any other application. Xpadder supports the use of up to 26 controllers simultaneously and if a controller supports it, Xpadder can assign a button to make the controller rumble/vibrate.
