,Etterless,2009-12-23T07:29Z,This movie could have been so good if it wasn?t for the dialogue. It?s like Kevin Smith was incarnated into a molested girl. And way too many plot twists.
,george0079,2010-01-06T03:49Z,I thought it was a fantastic movie.  I liked the plot twists.

,SergeantSpoon,2010-08-30T00:54Z,"The quality of the sample is:
V: 9
A: 9

Download speed is mostly: 1.5-1.7 mb/s.
Sometimes it slacks with 50 kb/s, but mostly the above.

Can't wait to watch the movie."
