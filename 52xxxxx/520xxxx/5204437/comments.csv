Enjoy the clean torrent and be happy."
,repeater4u,2009-12-09T09:42Z,"what I am trying to say is that the site knocked me back twice for the user name I chose so I changed the user name, they then knocked me back for username being too long. On the fourth attempt they knocked me back because my email was already registered??????? never had probs registering on sites before so I am thinking the site was just collecting email addresses. Could be wrong but 4 attempts & still getting denied is a bit suss.     "
