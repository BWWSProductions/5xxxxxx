Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose is an American comic book, written and drawn by Jim Balent and published by Broadsword Comics since 1999.

It is the story of Tarot, a warrior witch, and her family, friends and lovers. The comic generally features stories of fantasy action and adventure interspersed with frequent scenes of nudity, which have grown progressively stronger as the series has gone on.[neutrality disputed] Most current issues have the characters nude for at least a part of the issue.

As well as the comic narrative, each issue is backed up with interviews with "actual" witches (who are also sometimes nude[neutrality disputed]) and Wiccan practitioners, and advertisements for "real-life" spells and potions branded with the Tarot name.
