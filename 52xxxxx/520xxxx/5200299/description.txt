Out of the successful Midnight Sons books of the early nineties came Hellstorm - Prince of Lies featuring Daimon Hellstrom, also known as the Son of Satan.  This series is most notable for being written by Warren Ellis.  Much of his ideas Ellis used in Hellstorm - Prince of Lies would appear in later titles that he writes.

The first issue sees Hellstorm reborn on Earth.
