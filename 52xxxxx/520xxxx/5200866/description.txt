This worked 100% for me and another person who installed the English game. If you do not know how to install a driver this is what you must do.

Right click "my computer" and click "manage". Go to devices, in the right pane right click the name of your PC and select add legacy hardware.
When the wizard opens click next/select manual(advanced)/click show all devices and click next/click have disk/browse for the dev00 driver file that your downloaded.
