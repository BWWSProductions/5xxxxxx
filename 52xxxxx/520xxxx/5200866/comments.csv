,DaNoob,2009-12-07T02:47Z,No one told me that TPB tracker was down so i had to use a different one. This should be 100% working download.
,baalika,2009-12-08T15:06Z,could someone please confirm this works?
,118461,2009-12-08T22:31Z,"OMG , DOESNT'S MATE, UR VERY GOOD, BUT PLS HELP ME IF YOU CAN , I GET STILL THE KEY BOX AND TRY SOME LINKS, BUT NOTHING HAPPENS?!"
,DaNoob,2009-12-09T02:12Z,"Its hard to figure out the links cause they are in Russian, and yes this does work.

when the activation box comes up what i did was first type in a fake key... it failed... then i clicked the second text link near the bottom of the box. they box closed and i was able to start the game and play. every week it will ask for activation, make sure you have latest daemon tools and make sure the cd of English version is mounted. 

THIS DOES WORK YOU JUST HAVE TO MESS AROUND WITH THE ACTIVATION BOX BECAUSE ITS HARD TO UNDERSTAND. WHEN MY ACTIVATION BOX COMES UP AGAIN I WILL MAKE A TUTORIAL ON EXACTLY WHAT TO CLICK."
,bond672,2009-12-09T08:59Z,"please seeeeeed!

or if anyone has a web link to this zip file, so want to play it"
,baalika,2009-12-09T09:46Z,and soooo theres no hope for anyone using 64 bit windows?
,tehcombo,2009-12-09T13:45Z,"@DaNoob

quote: ""make sure you have latest daemon tools and make sure the cd of English version is mounted.""

question : CD of the ENGLISH version, how can you mount one when the torrent provided in step 1 does not contain an image ? (only installation directory with the 3 files, setup.exe data1.cab and cdkey.txt)"
,118461,2009-12-09T19:41Z,"Hey al, again is me, but first question: Can i use Trivium click instead of using FStarforce BECAUSE I DONT KNOW HOW TO INSTALL .INF ON WINDOWS7


Somebody pls help me, i google so much but found nothing,"
,DaNoob,2009-12-10T03:24Z,"O sorry my bad... I forgot lol.

Make sure the game is 1.0.1C English, and you have installed the latest Fstarforce driver. Also make sure that there are no starforce crap drivers on your machine(i recommend running the starforce removal tool).

When activation pops up play with it, i believe its the second link at bottom to play game."
,DaNoob,2009-12-10T03:34Z,"To install the driver in windows 7 all you have to do is click start and past (hdwwiz.exe) with out () and use the add hardware wizard. What you want to do is manually add the hard ware(check the bubble after hitting next)then when you get to the part where you have to select a device. Click show all devises and hit next. Click ""have disk"" and search for the driver file. The driver file should be extracted to desktop and i think its names dev00 or something.

i hope this helps"
,DaNoob,2009-12-10T03:40Z,Or if you want to add hardware through the windows 7 GUI right click my computer and click manage. Click devise manager then right click in the right pane at the top your name of your PC and click add legacy hardware.
,baalika,2009-12-10T12:55Z,"I aint buying a game thats using starforce... a pity cause the lomac series are really well developed :(

so is there any other way to play 1.01c without fstarfoce?

cause fstarforce driver doesnt work under 64 bit"
,DaNoob,2009-12-10T14:12Z,"Well if your willing to buy the game then buy it. I believe the digital download of the english version does not install any driver because it uses online activation keys. People complained about the starforce drivers eating there ide drives or something so that's why they took the driver out of it.

Also it says ""It does not work with the x64 versions of Windows Vista and Windows XP!"" but i still think you can try the 64bit version of windows 7..."
,bond672,2009-12-12T08:51Z,need seeders! or anyone have it as a file can download from sharing site!!
,bond672,2009-12-12T13:26Z,"ok finally downloaded, now just need to learn russian so i know which box to click!!!

HELP!!!!"
,DaNoob,2009-12-13T03:54Z,"I'm sure to activate what i did was type in a random code to test it, it gave me some Russian error and then i clicked the second of three links near the bottom of the box. It then disappeared and i though it died, but then i launched it and the box never came up again."
,bond672,2009-12-13T04:02Z,and you need a mounted version of the game to run it? or can just install from a disk and not need anything else? 
,DaNoob,2009-12-13T04:09Z,"OMG I AM SOOO SORRY!!!  I forgot that you still need the Russian CDs.

You need to get the Russian CDs and mount them and then you need to click the boxes to get it to scan the CD. Because the BIN folder is Russian it needs to scan a CD and if you download and use latest version of daemon tools to mount it you will be able to play..."
,DaNoob,2009-12-13T04:13Z,Sorry for me being responsible. I updated the instructions and if you follow them correctly your game should be full English and working 1.0.1C
,bond672,2009-12-13T05:31Z,"so now i need to download the russian cd first, i have a disk with setup,autorun,data1 file on it, if i create an image with this disk will that be good enough? or i need to get the russian version?"
,DaNoob,2009-12-13T19:48Z,"I am not sure. Maybe if i made a mini image of the Russian version i could upload it but i would not be able to test it since i just reactivated the game again.

Do you know how to make mini images?"
,DaNoob,2009-12-13T19:55Z,This torrent is so that people can get the English version working with out having to actually install the Russian version.
,bond672,2009-12-14T01:19Z,"i have the english version on a disk, i can create an image for it, i am using windows 7, just so u know, but its understanding the russian boxes and the key bit that is not clear!! so how to crack the english version? just adding your bin file does nothing if we cant read the russian star force boxes!! regards"
,DaNoob,2009-12-14T19:29Z,"Technically this is not a true crack. It is a patch to make the English version work.'

You need this bin file, the Russian CD, and fstarforce.

Putting the bin file makes the game allow searching for cd activation. Fstarforce makes the activation cracked to allow burnt copies.

When the bin file and fstarforce are installed use daemon tools to mount the RUSSIAN not English CD. If you see a page that has a key box click the 3rd link below it, you get another page with 4 buttons to the side. Click the second button and if you get another page click the top button. In the end the thing will disappear and allow you to run the game."
,cerfew,2009-12-16T00:49Z,"I can't get it to work. I do everything you said in the instructions, but when it gets to the disk-check, it gives an error and doesn't continue. I can get 1.0 working fine, but i'd like to be able to use the update..."
,bond672,2009-12-23T01:25Z,"ok this is how to do it, first, download the russian version on dvd, which is mountable, then also download the english version, but you dont need to mount this one, download the russian 1.01c patch and the english one too. next install the russian version, install the russian patch, now copy the bin file and save it somewhere...uninstall the russian version, install the english version, and patch it to 1.01c, now copy back the russian bin folder. download the starforce driver and install it, now remember the russian version you had? mount it with daemon tools, i turned on all the rsmp discsafe etc and i ran the game, it never even asked for a cd key, no damn silly russian boxed, straight to the english version of the game and i am using windows 7....cheers!"
,DaNoob,2009-12-25T04:19Z,"Again you do not need to do all of that since i already posted the russian bin folder. Just install the english version, patch to 1.0.1c, then copy my bin folder and delete old bin folder, then mount the russian game cd and use Fstarforce to start game."
,bond672,2009-12-25T14:51Z,"i tried it your way but it didnt work, so i gave my solution as an alternative.
regards"
,d1007,2009-12-26T01:38Z,"DaNoob// this crack is same as 1.01c rus version. so i tried rus version 1.01c, there is no activation. i'll try eng version. so far rus version 1.01c didn't work."
,bond672,2009-12-26T02:46Z,"thats why u need both versions mate, install and patch upto 1.01c the russian one, copy the bin folder and then uninstall it, install the english version, patch it to 1.01c then replace the bin folder with the one you saved from the russian one, run that protect.exe remove driver, then install the fs starforce driver and i mounted the russian verison with daemon tools, turned on the rmps or whatever it is and it never asks for any key or anything, hope this works for you!
but be warned this helo is a bitch to fly!!"
,d1007,2009-12-26T09:46Z,"YEHA~ I DID IT. IT WORKS.
But, I needed FStarForce 3.6 version.
I ran it with russian version, maybe It should be run with English version.
I need to reinstall my windows, and I'll test for more.
The reason that use Russian EXE is to remove starforce drive.
and People who want to run it, Search ""Fstarforce 3.6"" in search web site, you will find them somewhere. 
It is  named ""FStarForce.v.3.6.0.0_daemon4304_lite""
Regards."
,Kristoph109,2009-12-31T05:30Z,"I am trying so hard to make this game work but I just don't understand what is going on. :(

Okay, so the Fstarforce install doesn't work on mine because of x64 like '13dk13' said, so what do I do then? 

My game actually works and goes into the main menu, but when I go to play a mission it goes back to desktop with all the Russian writing about the CD key.

:( appreciate if anyone can clear up what to do. :("
,Kristoph109,2009-12-31T05:32Z,"Also I don't know what you mean by ""use Fstarforce to start game."" :| "
,d1007,2009-12-31T10:47Z,"Kristoph109 / You must run this with 32BIT system, because Fsatrforce works in 32Bit system.
you can't run this until real crack files comes up.
NEVER."
,Kristoph109,2010-01-01T11:18Z,"I actually got it working and got in-game..

problem is it's all in Russian.. when I get it working in English I get errors :(

I need to mess around with the bin's more... or learn Russian X)"
,d1007,2010-01-01T13:11Z,"Kristoph109 /Do you run in-game flight without Fstarforce? because 1.01patch works with starforce 5.7, you can't run into in-flight(just i think).

13dk13 / check what version of FStarForce is. last version of fstarforce is 3.6 which compatibles with starforce 5.7.
If you get pop-up window after hitting ""fly"" button, maybe you get three button in the right of the window, select the second button from above. maybe you can run in-flight."
,Kristoph109,2010-01-01T13:29Z,"Well I couldn't get this working so I'm just using the Trivium Crack on 1.00 which seems to work for me, half of it is in english and other half is in russian though...I just need to figure out which .ddl makes the subtitles english :("
,Kristoph109,2010-01-01T14:20Z,"omg! ok with a lot of mucking around I have the guy speaking english with english subtitles!

And I have to say..................holy shit. it takes like half an hour to start the Black Shark up........and another half an hour to start the second engine............I'M LOVING THIS SHIT! :D"
,d1007,2010-01-05T01:44Z,"Kristoph109 / you can't run 1.01 with 1.00 crack. I tested it already, but that is just 1.00.
because 1.01 exe works with many files, without 1.01 exe you don't run real 1.01. check mission editor. if you can't fly UH-1H or can't find UH-1H in aitcraft selector, you just run with 1.00"
,Antba,2010-01-20T00:02Z,"No chance of getting a mini-image from the russian dvd?

But thanks for your work anyway"
,winterino,2010-01-21T22:35Z,"Hey everyone, just a quick question. Having trouble getting 1.0.1c working and i think it's due to me using fstarforce 3.5 which someone mentioned does not work with the version of starforce included in the patch. I can't seem to find 3.6 anywhere though, anyone have a link?

thanks!"
,winterino,2010-01-28T12:36Z,"ok got 1.0.1c working! i noticed that as someone else mentioned restarting is critical.

AFTER removing the starforce driver restart your PC BEFORE doing anything else, including copying files. I didn't get it working until i did this. Thanks to everyone for the awsum work on cracking this game, you rock!"
,stanocugana,2010-01-29T13:31Z,"Please,i need corect cd key."
,Holton181,2010-02-15T21:12Z,"HELP!
Winterino, DaNoob or whoever succeeded to get english 1.0.1c version to work on a XP SP3 32bit machine.

I´ve tried the method suggested by DaNoob, and the one from bon672. I´ve tried with StarForce removed (stable.exe), I?ve tried with StarForce untouched. I´ve tried hitting this button, I´ve tried hitting that button. I´ve tried this, I´ve tried that. Over and over and over and over again!
Now I am getting tired!

PLEES, can someone write some CONSISTENT instructions??!
With ALL steps included, how trivial they ever might be.
Did you install russian and english versions in the same directory or in the ones suggested by the installer (different ones)?
On main drive (C) or some other drive?
(exactly) When did you remove StarForce (if you did)?
When to restart my PC?
Winterino, how can you remove StarForce and restart BEFOR copying files? You can´t remove StarForce with english stable.exe and you need to copy files (russian bin) to get english game to play.

I am sorry if I sound ungrateful, I am not. Quite the contrary. It´s just that I am feeling so frustrated that everybody seem to get this working except for me!
I have succeeded to get the 1.0.0 to work, but now when it seems that 1.0.1c is ?crackabel? I really want that one.

I´ve got Fstarforce 3.6 (installed and uninstalled several times), latest Deamon Tools Lite with RMPS enabled.  XP is a swedish XP Professional SP3.

Thank you everybody for all your efforts trying to help newbies like me. Also thank you for all that you have done so far, even if it has not helped me (yet).

/Holton181"
,Holton181,2010-02-20T19:23Z,"Well, I´ve got it running now. But I do not really understand how. First, after several attempts I succeeded to get up in the air, but then for some reason I can´t understand the game started to ask for the key again and locked me out. I started to guess that it checks for the key on random basis. I tried various sequences for the button-hitting, but never past.

Now I ones again are able to fly, and I will try to explain what I did as detailed as possible. But no guarantees! I still do not now what I did right this time or why license-requests appear and if they appear on random basis. I have no clue on the button-procedure, this last time I got it working it did not ask for the key.

Here how I did it:
1.	Downloaded both English and Russian games and 1.0.1c-patches.
2.	Burned the Russian mountable to a DVD (the mdf and mds files, not as a DVD-copy), and deleted the image from hard drive.
3.	Downloaded Fstarforce 3.6 (did not unpack the rar).
4.	Downloaded and installed latest Daemon Tools Lite and enabled RMPS. Did not start it. 
5.	Deactivated network and all protection software?s (i.e. antispyware and virus protection).
6.	Installed English game in a folder chosen by myself, on a secondary hard drive.
7.	Installed English patch.
8.	Created another folder outside the game folder and moved entire content of the game folder to it, except for the bin-folder.
9.	Deleted the English bin-folder.
10.	Emptied the recycler.
11.	Started Daemon Tools and mounted the Russian image from the DVD.
12.	Installed Russian game in the same directory as I installed the English one (I did NOT uninstall the English game first).
13.	Removed virtual CD-drive and turned off Daemon Tools.
14.	Removed DVD.
15.	Installed Russian patch.
16.	Removed the Starforce-driver using  ?\bin\stable\protect.exe.
17.	Rebooted the PC (actually turned it off completely, cut power for a second, and started).
18.	Unpacked and installed Fstarforce 3.6 like described above.
19.	Rebooted the PC (likewise).
20.	Copied the Russian image to hard drive.
21.	Mounted it with Daemon Tools.
22.	Run the Russian game, instant flight. I was able to fly without any license-requests.
23.	After starting to load flight, I dismounted the image from virtual drive (according to some this will prevent game from checking for license again).
24.	End the game.
25.	Created another folder outside the game folder and moved entire content of the game folder to it, except for the bin-folder.
26.	Moved all English files and folders back to game folder.
27.	Ones again mounted the image, started game, instant flight, dismounted image, SUCCESS!

Maybe some of these steps are unnecessary, but this is how I did it and it works for me (so far).

One thing that might corrupt the installation is if you run some kind of registry cleaner like CCleaner or RegistryBooster. I do not know for sure, but I have a feeling they might clean away some important registrykeys, since the files in the game folder are a mix of English and Russian files.

Ones again TANK YOU ALL that contributed to make this possible!
Hope everybody will be able to fly somehow.

/Holton181

PS when I can afford an entire hardware update I will purchase a legal copy of this wonderful game, they probably need all our economical support to produce sims like this."
,Holton181,2010-02-20T22:17Z,"Hear Ye, Hear Ye!!!
I just found another thing that might cause a lot of agony among us!

For some strange reason, after playing the game after the install, I ones again was unable to load it without license-check. WHYYYY??!  I thought.

Well, for a reason I do not know, I observed the processes running in the task manager while trying to load the game and saw the protect.exe among them. Nothing strange I thought, but then it hit me!
Could it be possible that it mattered witch of the image files, mds or mdf, I was using to mount with Daemon Tools?

I knew I was using the mdf now when the game did not load, but did not remember witch one I used previously when it worked. So I tried it out. I loaded Daemon Tools with the mds file and started the game. It asked for the license-key. I hit the third blue link from the top as other people previously mentioned. The protect.exe disappeared from the task manager and the game loaded correctly!

Tried the mdf ones again, the game did not let me in.

Again tried the mds, the bird was flying!

Conclusion:
Use the mds file when mounting the image!
