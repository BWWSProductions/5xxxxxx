,engruss,2009-12-18T14:45Z,"Got it installed and working except for two problems:

swexplorer2pdmworks_crk.exe makes my antivirus, Avira, complain that it
contains DR/Delphi.Gen. Even so, running it in the ,
it says that it failed to update file. Using Windows 7 64 bit. Tried running
swexplorer2pdmworks_crk.exe in compatibility and administrator mode with no
sucess.

Simulation is installed but says that ""No license exists for Solidworks
Simulation. Would you like to run the Activation Wizard?"", the simulation
runs. Maybe this is a trial license?

I set up a seperate partition on my machine with a fresh software load, just to run this version Solidworks. 

Thanks otherwise. This is great.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions on the above."

,ForFun00,2009-12-27T06:05Z,"Anonymous, Thanks a lot!
My installing learned experience w/SW2006, 7, 8 & 2009, is that I 'always' disconnect NTERNET; The installation will ask you to connect, 'click' CANCEL, a few times, until the installation starts.
Hope this helps. 
I never perform an INSTALLATION 'unless' I'm 100% sure internet is disconnected. 
Sometimes firewalls fails, and we may loose a good serial."

The reason why you got the message was because you installed the software while connected to the internenet. It has to be done while disconnected.

Has anyone got solidworks simulation fully working? 
It starts up fine and creates a mesh, but when it runs a study this message comes up and forces you to cancel. 
""Security device is not responding. 
Please install security device"". 

Any help would be really appreciated.

I downloaded this torrent but I am having some install trouble. After the download finished, I run the 32 bit install setup. My first hiccup is when it asks to enter the serial. The serial that was in the text file does not work with the software (as other users have previously stated). I decided to continue install without entering a serial. Everything else runs smoothly, except that when all is said and done, there is no Solidworks program. The only 2 new items are the e-drawing viewer and solidworks explorer. I cannot find the program anywhere...

Is this because i neglected to input a valid serial?? If this is the case, could someone provide input as to why the serial is not working and/or a valid way of getting it to work?

If someone could offer come advice, it would be much appreciated. I am running 32 bit Windows 7 in parallels on my Mac and would love to get this working.

Thanks!"

I hope this helps everyone:

0. Extract the sw2k10sp0.0_cracks.rar file
1. I deleted all previous versions of Solidworks, including all folders
2. Disconnect from internet and disable anti virus program
3. Open the contents of the .iso and go to the sldim folder then go open the sldim application
4. Install the product with the serial number (I used the first one in the sw2010_SolidSQUAD file). If it says that you cant install it or you need to be connected to the internet just hit ""Cancel"" or ""Okay"" to continue and it should start the installation.
5. After its installed DO NOT START SOLIDWORKS!!!!!! I believe this will ruin the crack and you will have to reinstall it or only use the trial version.
6. Apply the cracks. Go to the folders that appeared after extracting the sw2k10sp0.0_cracks file. Open each folder and it has instructions where to put it. For Windows 7 x64 some of the directories you have to paste the cracks in are located at C:\Program Files (x86)\SolidWorks Corp and some are in C:\Program Files\SolidWorks Corp (See below for more details).For the Solidworks Folder crack it says you need to install it with a different serial. I didnt and it still worked, so if its not working maybe use that.
8. After all this start up Solidworks and it should work. You can reconnect your internet and virus protector afterward."

now i have followed the crack folder and found the certain folders and the files in them to be copy pasted and done with the crack,,,,,,it is a bit tedious but worth it. after successfully installing the software i saw the guy REDMAN21 has given a detail step by step working here and belive me he has made it easy just follow it ...
also a thank you to redman 21 for his concern for the guys of cad out here.... welll coming to two main points of this installation 
first turn ur anitvirus to sleep for the time u did not finish with your complete crack installation
..........
secondly  see to it u turn off the internet while installing it and whn it promts for internet just dnt care about it press ok or whtever except cancel and it should move on with installation.

I finally got flow simulation working.

Under VirtualBox 4.0.4 (Guest Additions installed).
Windows 7, 64 bit:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5952557/Windows_7_Ultimate_(64_Bit)_x64_(November_2010)
64 bit version of SolidWorks from here.

What finally got it working for me was copying the license.dat to C:\Program Files (x86)\SolidWorks Corp\COSMOS M\License\ (thanks to Dan9111).
I then ran LicenseAdmin in that directory to verify it.

1) Mount 64 bit iso / burn and insert CD.
2) Run from iso/CD: \sldim\sldim.exe to install.
3) On the 3rd screen, click ""Change"" to change the products to be installed.  A couple things will be unchecked (flow stuff and cosmos).  Check everything! (thanks solidwok)
4) Finish install.
5) Copy crack (thanks RedMan21):
eDrawings: C:\Program Files (x86)\SolidWorks Corp\SolidWorks eDrawings\
PhotoView360: C:\Program Files (x86)\SolidWorks Corp\PhotoView 360\

6) Run C:\Program Files (x86)\SolidWorks Corp\COSMOS M\License\LicenseAdmin.exe
Verify ""Authorization"" = ""Passed"".  This is required for flow simulation to work.  If not, consider clicking ""Configure License"" or finding a license.dat elsewhere (I used the one included).

7) Run the SWExplorer crack... let me know if you get it to work."
