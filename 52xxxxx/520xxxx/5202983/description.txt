A feisty septuagenarian teams with a fearless wilderness ranger to do battle with a vicious band of beasts and villains in this computer-animated adventure scripted by Pixar veteran Bob Peterson and co-directed by Peterson and "Monsters, Inc." director Peter Docter. Carl Fredricksen is a 78-year-old balloon salesman. His entire life, Carl has longed to wander the wilds of South America. Then, one day, the irascible senior citizen shocks his neighbors by tying thousands of balloons to his home and finally taking flight. But Carl isn't alone on his once-in-a-lifetime journey, because stowed away on his front porch is an excitable eight-year-old wilderness explorer named Russell. Later, as the house touches down on the world's second largest continent, Carl and his unlikely traveling companion step outside to discover that not only is their new front lawn considerably larger, but that the predators therein are much more ferocious than anything they ever faced back home.

See on sÃ¼damlik, pÃ¶Ã¶raselt naljakas lugu 78-aastasest ÃµhupallimÃ¼Ã¼jast Carl Fredricksenist, kes teeb Ã¼hel pÃ¤eval teoks oma eluaegse unistuse sÃ¶Ã¶sta suurtesse seiklustesse. Selleks seob ta oma maja kÃ¼lge tuhandeid Ãµhupalle ja lendab LÃµuna Ameerika dzhunglitesse. TÃ¤it rÃµÃµmu unistuse tÃ¤itmisest segab aga kogemata reisile kaasa sattunud 8-aastane looduseuurija Russell, kes pole oma elus seni kordagi loodusesse sattunud! Ãœheskoos rÃ¤ndavad nad kadunud maailma, kus kohtuvad kummaliste, eksootiliste ja Ã¼llatavate kujudega ning Ã¼letavad Ã¼he vÃµimatuna nÃ¤iva takistuse teise jÃ¤rel.
KÃµik tegelased rÃ¤Ã¤givad sulaselges eesti keeles. 
Eestikeelse versiooni kesksetes osades TÃµnu Aav, Priit VÃµigemast, Aarne ÃœkskÃ¼la ja paljud teised.
