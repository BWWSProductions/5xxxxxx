,D14BL0,2009-12-25T08:26Z,Anybody know yet if this will play on M33?
,D14BL0,2009-12-25T09:42Z,Found out myself; it does not.
,deikbek,2010-01-30T06:04Z,"It might work on M33-6 if you patch it first

Just go to pspisosdotcom or something like that and search for a patcher  sorry I can't remember the source for the program but it works on the new games that require fm6 to work on cfw5.00m33-6"
,FernFrond,2010-06-16T10:37Z,Playing the first version of this game and its the best damn game I've ever played on the psp so far. Monster hunter gets too hard where this game is more playable. I hope Ill be able to play this version somehow.
