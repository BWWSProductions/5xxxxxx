Another great re-release by none other then: Civic/Scootin

..........................................................

HDDHacker with all current .bin files as of 12/8/09

TAKE NOTE:
The programs giving may be out of date
Do a google search for any and all current releases

..........................................................

Whats the point in doing this:
If your like me-I do not have over $100 to shell out to M$
So why not pay around $40 for a HDD and do the install your self and save

Will this get me banned:
It has been confirmed that you will NOT get banned by doing this mod

What will this do:
The files giving will let you use 3rd party (store bought-Western Digital) HDD's and let you use them on your 360 once modded

Will other HDD's other then Western Digital work with this:
No and there is no plans for releaseing a version to work on other HDD's as the auther has stated that it would just take up to much time and would not be worth the trouble in the end

Can you give me some advice/help on how to use this:
There is a README file within the folder to help on how to use this
If any further help is needed then try a search vai Google

Did you (the uploader) make this program:
No, Wish I did though as the auther has some series skills to pull this off

Did you know that you (the uploader) are a dick some times:
Yep, one of the perks of being Bi-Poler
