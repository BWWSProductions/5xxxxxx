,brian0423,2009-12-10T23:19Z,"gamerguy1, in your sentence you have ""?"" at the end of the sentence...are you asking if you need to have your xbox homebrewed or are you telling us? because it doesn't make sense to ask you, yourself a question. Unless you have the whole split personality thing going on."
