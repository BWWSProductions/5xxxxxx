After downloading lots of releases of this movie I discovered that not even one of these has the subs for the foreign languages. So I decided to make one.
So here it is : an R5 release of 2012 re-encoded by me to lower the size (a little) and to put the subs on video.
Audio : English, French, Russian etc.
Subs : English for the foreign languages parts

Hope you'll like this release...
