,rebelarms81,2009-12-14T08:14Z,Worked like a charm!
,msmmpts1,2009-12-15T13:10Z,does it activate the machine permanently??
[V],[HB],2009-12-15T15:56Z,Yah ! It does
,Anton00b,2009-12-15T20:06Z,"Erm, when I started my computer after using this, it said that I might be using a counterfeit version of windows. Any suggestions?
And I waited until the trial period was over before i ran this. Does this make any difference?"
,djME27,2009-12-16T02:17Z,"So got a question... originally started with the 1.61d loader by Hazar, using the SLIC method, and worked fine for a while until I reformatted in order to reinstall Windows 7 a bit ago.  Switched to this loader, and worked without a hitch for maybe three weeks before it started complaining that it wasn't genuine any longer.  So, used loader again, fixed it... warning came back two days later.  So, basically, the patch works, but it only seems to last an average of one to two days before I have to run it again.  Have tried both the SLIC method and the loader method, both seem to work just as well for the same amount of time.  Anything I'm doing wrong or is anyone else having this problem?"
,djME27,2009-12-16T02:22Z,"Forgot to mention... one idea I have is that maybe there is some service I have disabled that would need to remain enabled in order for the loader/activation to work?  I am fairly minimalist and disable a lot of the unnecessary services, done a lot of research on their dependencies but its possible I could have overlooked something."
[V],[HB],2009-12-16T07:38Z,"@Anton00b

On which version of Windows 7 you are trying to install this loader ?

@djME27

This torrent was uploaded on : 2009-12-09 18:11:46 GMT [which is a week ago]
I wonder how did it worked for you without a hitch for three weeks."
,otta94nr2,2009-12-16T16:27Z,"I think this one is the best!
I used it myself. Worked really nice!!"
,ocyrus70,2009-12-17T18:13Z,"try unticking the box ""under were you put the key"" that says active windows when connected to the net then run loader"
,SpiritWolfe,2009-12-17T20:03Z,"@Tauseef

I am having some troubles here, please help!

I have an old ASUS P4 x86 machine that it worked like a charm on, so I KNOW it personally works myself! :)

HOWEVER! I have an old Gateway 7210GX that is an AMD Mobile processor 3GHz that originally had XP on it with 512mb shared ATI video.

The LOADER reports the BIOS being a PTLD with a Manufacture Date of 9/04.

Any suggestions on how to get the info that I need to use the Loader on Windows 7 Ultimate x86?

I am kinda scratching my head at this dilemma!

THANKS! 

Cheers!

,B0sc0,2009-12-29T16:41Z,"I've been using this one and the previous one without a hitch on all my installs - both 32/64bit. I did notice though and was wondering if someone can confirm if this is ONLY for Ultimate? Or can it be used on ""lesser"" versions."

How the heck do you do that?  Any insite would be appreciated. TIA"
,djME27,2010-01-09T05:27Z,"@hellboy: My mistake with the three weeks thing... I forgot that I had used a different loader, ""7loader 1.6d,"" for about two weeks or so before I reformatted in order to fix some issues I was having with corrupted files.  So I suppose I should rephrase my question to read ""Your loader worked for a week.""  By the way, my question was not meant to bash this crack, as it DOES work, but for anywhere from 1 day to 2-3 weeks before needing to be run again.  I was posting it as a question to see if you had any ideas about what might be MY problem.  You must have thought what I was REALLY looking for was for you to question me back about the time frame, and NOT try to help in any way.  Sucks that its gotten so bad people have to scrutinize every poster cuz they suspect everyone of trying to flame their torrent."
,4rror,2010-01-14T23:15Z,"I've tried this several times on a 2007 MacBook Pro, with no luck. I've tried uninstalling and using different manufacturers.

After a second reboot it seems to work. The Macbook is now an Acer.

,Danj303,2010-02-24T21:10Z,DO NOT INSTALL WINDOWS UPDATE KB971033 if you use this to crack Windows 7. See http://www.buzzcrunch.net/2010/02/windows-7-update-kb971033/  And if you have installed it you have to remove it in the control panel then use removeWAT (search on TPB) and you'll be back up and running. 
,chrisjust98,2010-02-25T23:04Z,"If you installed the update KB971033 just do this. Use the loader to do the bios hack then click the key in the bottom right of your task bar. When the box pops up, click the button in the middle and it'll take you to the microsoft genuine advantage. Click the green button that says continue, download it and then run it. After you run it, click on the next green button under the first one that says continue. It'll then validate your installation and you should be good from there on out. I stumbled onto this by accident. I was going to close out the box that popped up but click the button in the middle by mistake and just went with it."
