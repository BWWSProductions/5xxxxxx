Seriously, all you are doing is making it take up more space when you extract the thing TWICE and making it a pain in the ass to figure out what convoluted system you had come up with for spanning a -65.5 megabyte- file which didn\'t need spanning in the first place. Seriously, you\'re just wasting people\'s time."
