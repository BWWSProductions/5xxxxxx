The Clan of the Cave Bear is a historical fiction novel by Jean M. Auel about prehistoric times set somewhat before the extinction of the Neanderthal race after 600,000 years as a species, and at least 10-15,000 years after 'Homo sapiens' remains are documented and dated in Europe as a viable second human species. It is the first book in the Earth's Children book series which is a purpose-built and written multi-book serial novel, that investigates the possibilities and some likely interactions of Neanderthal and modern Cro-Magnon humans living near each other at the same time.
