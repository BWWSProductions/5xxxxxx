,scarygood48,2009-12-10T17:16Z,"Good DVDRip, has a watermark but no big deal.  The movie, pretty awful.  Basically it is about a rich white Christian family who help out a poor black boy in the hopes that they might exploit his physical abilities.  Oh but they learn about eachother along the way....awww.  The acting is awful and it has jokes whose highlights are punchlines like the word ""ass"" and ""crotch mouth"".  It has this annoying little kid, which adds to the misery.  I would classify this type of stuff as ""Christian comedy"".  It is boring and mildly racist."

,Maximillian24,2009-12-14T03:00Z,"scarygood4 makes a good point. As far as the quality it's a screener so it's good for a screener. There should be no complaints about the quality.

As far as what scarygood4 saying. This film and story is racist for sure. Michael Oher said himself he has played football since he was 8 years old. This film makes it look like he didn't know how to play. There are a long line of poor kids in Memphis black, white, brown you name it. The odds they get ""adopted"" by some rich white religious couple is slim to none. Football played a large part of him being taken in by this family. To say otherwise is not reality.

Made for a good movie though....."

As for the comments on taking other places out.. town by town... come on! you fat fucks rarely leave the sofa, never mind your inbred state and you wanna come get the rest of the world... you ignorant fucks don't have a passport and have never looked at a map. What's your excuse? Nothing happening outside of the USA? Mentioning Bin Laden is also something i find just silly.. so if you are not an American you are related to him. I beg each and every one of the Americans reading this to please educate yourselves.. the system seems to be failing you and if you have children please don't let them grow up with the same misinformation that has guided you through your life & probably down the street to Burger King, with a short stop at the Dairy Queen! I'm happy American's are ignorant fools who stay in their own country.. Let's keep it that way and ecstatic knowing that 85% of Americans do not hold a passport however, 100% hold cheese burgers and a bug gulp!

,Drufasa,2009-12-23T16:32Z,"First of all, how does a mindless rant against an entire country have ANYTHING to do with this upload?
Secondly, I would like to point out to beppe1987 that the Germans are quite famous for a little thing they had going on in the 1940s - but very few (at least in America) thinks of every German as a Nazi.
Every country has a past it isn't proud of, the best we can do is go forward and learn from it.
And for the record, Americans make the wrong decisions sometimes, but at least we make them.  (Unlike some neutral indecisive do-nothing pussies *Switzerland*)  ;-)"
,rabblerowser,2009-12-23T17:00Z,"I do have to say that you're mostly right about lots of Americans, however the fast food, the nascar, etc. etc. just goes to show how much it takes to brainwash an american. You poor bastards conceded to the European Union and lost your sovereignty years ago. You think Obama's helping? You're just as easily fooled as any american. New World Order and Globalization is here to turn us all to slaves, no matter where we come from, so pull your head out of your ass and get off your soap-box. Just because your country hasn't done anything noteworthy(good or bad) recently doesn't mean you have to go picking e-fights with people twice as educated as yourself(assuming 87 is your birthdate). If swedes have had enough of our bullshit than why don't they gather the intestinal fortitude to do something about it? If your going to lose you faith, lose it in humanity, NOT americans.  "

You're just stereotyping Americans. If you actually came here for yourself, you'd realize we aren't all bumbling idiots who need our fixes on what's going on with the hottest celebrities. But, like us apparently, you just believe what you see on t.v and don't question it any further.

Anyways, thanks for the upload."

,baybay09,2009-12-26T22:16Z,"Seriously some of us come on here for the main purpose of downloading torrents. Do you know how fricken annoying it is to have to scroll thru a millon stupid ass comments just to find one that actually comments on the a/v. And yes occasionally I do have to read the comments (usually only a very few) but its just to realize the shear stupidity of people on here from all countries/continents. I am from America and it is not the best country, true we do raise morons(those would be the people raised by  occasionally country bunkins, definitly all the racists and everyone ignorant but usually all three or at least the last two are generally must have qualitlies of morons, I mean you can't be racist and not ignorant. By the way a nigger is an ignorant person Obviously those come in all shades :-) but we also raise people who are very intelligent are at least intelligent enough to have common sense. The whole reason I felt the need to even comment on this shit was because of the moronic american who was taunting the guy from another country (something like turk....don't know, can't remember either of the names) to go ahead and take an american out to the woods and kill him. Do you not realize thousands of americans go missing every year while on vacation in other countries and its generally not because they decided to take an extra long vacation. There are insane ass people out there who are smart enough to know if he did do something like that we're not about to take down there country and go build a McDonnalds where their house use to be. With the amount of hate there is out there for america and the amount of crazy ass people there are out there, I mean we do have enough here just in america. The last thing anyone should do is taunt someone to take out an american because there are plenty of stupid ass people out there that probably would and have. I mean there are still good americans, we do exist and we don't all eat hamburgers on a daily basis and never leave our couches! To everyone who actually comments on the movie and quality, THANK YOU SO MUCH, IT IS MUCH APPRECIATED! "

,Kekkai,2010-01-16T10:33Z,"The sample was not OOS for me, it was perfectly in sync, the video was very, very good as was the audio.   Thank you very much, cgaurav007, and/or your group, this was very well done, and very much appreciated.

As for the person who said something about not usually caring for Sandra Bullock but that ""she was hot"" in this - get a clue, cro-magnon guy - it's not how hot she is, although at age 45, she is most assuredly beautiful; it's about the quality of the acting.  

She is FINALLY going to be up for an academy award; and it's overdue.  She has had the acting ability for ages, but because she is so very beautiful dumb-ass producers couldn't get past that to see her as a ""serious"" actress.

Props to her - she is indeed a serious actress, a beautiful woman, and - as of her marriage to Jesse James (she hates guns, he loves them, opposites do attract ;) a mother as well.  Stepmother, but still - she's their soccer mom to add on to the impressive list of accomplishments."
