,Raventhorn,2010-01-28T16:59Z,Need a prog that does exactly this... but then the other way around :P need vid to SWF :(
,PirateRoo,2010-09-11T09:49Z,"Works awesome, best one Ive run across. Converts directly to mp4 ipod qualitys or higher qualitys. Lots of options and does the job perfectly without the need to watch it constantly."
,shr00mie,2011-02-10T23:48Z,Thank you very much. Just what I needed!
,Dasher.X,2011-08-24T20:59Z,Doesn't work for me. All converted videos come out with a duration of 00:00:00.

Why not just use flash to do this or you can use Imtoo or format factory video converter mate."
