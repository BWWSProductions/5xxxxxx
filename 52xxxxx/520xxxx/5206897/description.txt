REO Speedwagon The Hits CD(MP3 320KBS)ICM369
____________________________________________

Recorded between January 1976 & April 1988. Includes liner 
notes by Malcolm Dome.

Like Journey and Styx, REO Speedwagon was a '70s rock band 
that scored its biggest hits with radio-friendly rock and l
ovesick power ballads during the early '80s. Rock dudes 
could easily identify with guitarist Gary Richrath's crunchy 
power chords, while the girls could find solace in singer 
Kevin Cronin's delicate tales of the ups and downs of love.

On the 1988 compilation THE HITS, the best of REO Speedwagon's 
both worlds are featured--rocking standouts like 
"Ridin' the Storm Out" and "Roll with the Changes,
" as well as such softer fare as "Keep on Lovin' You" and 
"Can't Fight This Feeling." Although one of their biggest hits, 
"Keep the Fire Burnin'," is strangely absent, THE HITS is by 
and large a well-assembled collection of REO's biggest hits.

Additional personnel includes: 
Eric Persing (synthesizer, programming); 
Tommy Funderburk (background vocals).

All tracks have been digitally remastered.

Producers include: 
Keith Olsen, Kevin Cronin, Gary Richrath, 
Paul Grupp, Kevin Beamish.

Reissue producer: Al Quaglieri.

REO Speedwagon includes: Kevin Cronin (vocals, guitar); 
Gary Richrath (guitar); Neal Doughty (keyboards, synthesizer); 
Bruce Hall (bass); Alan Gratzer (drums).
