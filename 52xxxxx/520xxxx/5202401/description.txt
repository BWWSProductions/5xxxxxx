The most amazing thing about the information from Anastasia is it's so practical anyone can follow it and we believe that's why it is touching millions across the globe. The Ringing Cedars Series has sold over 11 million copies worldwide so far! Dr. Leonid Sharashkin (we call him Dr Leo!) is the absolute authority on this material in the English-speaking world. He regularly receives standing ovations and rave reviews. Now, you get to here him speak with Dr. Agnew. This is going to be great!
