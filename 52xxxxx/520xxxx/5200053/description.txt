This truly awesome album was released in 1958.  The Brazilian Jazz Quartet, an obscure jazz quartet from the late 50's featuring Moacyr Peixoto (piano), Jose Ferreira Godinho Filho "Case" (sax),  Rubens Barsotti "Rubinho" (drums) and Luiz Chaves Oliveira da Paz "Luiz Chaves" (bass).  As a matter of fact, this group should be considered as a sort of embryo of the legendary "Zimbo Trio".
