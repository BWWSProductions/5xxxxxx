,-WaRmOnGeR-,2009-12-13T22:31Z,"I have same problem, install freezes at 13%..."
,609team,2009-12-14T00:12Z,"It doesn't freeze, it copies a large file at 13% so it stops for a while. Just be patient."

,609team,2009-12-19T14:30Z,Did you install the C++ from the autorun?
,Metalfyre,2009-12-20T08:31Z,Do I understand it correctly that this has update 3 already installed? Or do I still need to install that after installing this game? Thnx for sharing and all the work on this.
,609team,2009-12-20T12:47Z,"It has patch 2 integrated, and can be updated with the patch 3 released by SKIDROW."
,609team,2009-12-20T13:40Z,"Or alternatively, you can download the patch v1.03 here:

,Sortulv,2009-12-21T20:41Z,"Got a problem with Trojans while installation, and afterwards it asks me about C++ program, and that it isnt installed right. Have someone got the real exe, think that this maybe could help the problems, so of you got it please send me a mail to Sortulv@s-e-e.net.
Thanks
Sortulv"
,DadoZmaj,2009-12-21T23:00Z,I have problem with sound (no sound at all) and runtime error when I try to go on campaign (I can play scenario). Any solutions?
,609team,2009-12-22T01:36Z,Sortulv: the Trojan is a false positive and you have to install the C++ from the autorun before playing...
,Sortulv,2009-12-22T01:55Z,"Yes i installed and deinstalled the C++ a few times, the problem is it tells me first to install it when i start. then it tell me i miss the admin rights. have started it in admin mode, but it didn't help. Someone got a clue?
@ 609team
thanks for this great upload :-)
Sortulv"
,Sortulv,2009-12-22T02:00Z,"i just see, i got windows vista servicepack 1. Can that be the source?"
,609team,2009-12-22T15:49Z,"Not sure, but you should install SP2 anyway..."
,DadoZmaj,2009-12-23T19:15Z,"I uninstalled the game and installed it again and everything that's on autorun, but still same problem: Runtime error (visual basic) and no sound. I have XP SP3."
,joeram52,2009-12-25T06:05Z,"when i click on the launcher it gives me and error that says: ""the application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect"" what the hell do i do. i tried running as administrator still same error"
,joeram52,2009-12-25T06:27Z,ok i corrected that problem i downloaded the visuals but now i have a new problem. when i click on the launcher it jus brings the game up as a black screen and i get a notice sayin the game launcher has stopped working.what do i do? i downloded the patch and ran as admin
,Gurox,2009-12-26T22:57Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD.

 I did, worked fine, and I was stupid enough to ignore the trojan alert from antivir about the launcher.

Didn't download anything else these days, and went on vacation. When I came back my hotmail account had been hacked. What a coincidence."

,Nawlsome,2010-02-17T20:38Z,"There are no viruses.

Some douchebags are using freeware that throw up alerts over over false positives. They only do this to appear affective.

609team has confirmed its a false positive, and plenty of other programs (free a paid [norton, bitdefender, etc]) all show the patch as clean.

Don't listen to faggots and enjoy them game."
,Nawlsome,2010-02-17T20:50Z,"I'm going to be scanning the files in the iso once its complete though. 

Gurox might just be a douche who got hacked while downloading the torrent. Luckily the program I use blocks port scans.

There has been a few varying reports of viruses (metal.dll with reloaded, as well as alleged infected autorun files (?), infected patches, etc).

Its hard to know whats true when theres so much shit flying around from potential sock puppets."
,Nawlsome,2010-02-18T16:55Z,"Scanned iso with spybot, malwarebytes, and bitdefender.

All three came up clean. The download works fine, the install appears to stop at 13% because its installing a large file, so don't get your panties in a knot.

Enjoy this game, 609team did an awesome job."
