I will have the CBT Nuggets videos along with Ciscos' ICND book and there videso as well. IF your looking for a free router, switch, ASA, and PIX sim try GN3 but you will need to download ISO images which you can find here as well."
,vin0301,2011-01-08T21:12Z,I downloaded the CBT Nuggets series from 4 other torrents and they all suffer from the same issue. The videos ccent29.wmv and ccent30.wmv would not play correctly. I suspect they all came from the same source. Would this torrent have the same problem?
