,denniscormier,2009-12-13T21:23Z,does anyone have an avi copy uploaded?
,godhatescowards,2009-12-14T05:18Z,"This is not E13, it is 12."
,Neromacer,2009-12-14T07:20Z,"actually, this is episode 13, look it up.

and there was a lack of hd files working with xbox, this is for people who can't play hd on their computers but have an xbox."
,denniscormier,2009-12-15T09:40Z,"I am all for putting up alternate formats but it is driving me crazy that not a single one of my regular sites have an avi copy of episode 13.  If anybody knows where one is please link it here.

Thanks"
,denniscormier,2009-12-16T00:27Z,"where I ran into some confusion is the episode listing from TV.com
They show different numbers.  Since every download except this one and tv.com show the secret santa as episode # 12.  Turns out I do have all of the episodes so far this season.  But I still don't see how websites and this file say it is #13 when it looks like there are only 12"
,CocaineCowboy,2009-12-17T00:39Z,"This IS episode #13

 The Niagra Episodes counted as 4 and 5.

  The douche bag that uploaded them didnt label it as so. So now all the Episodes have the wrong numbers."
,killbush,2009-12-19T18:53Z,This is episode 12. See http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1548747/
,deuce1,2010-01-07T02:10Z,"No more arguing about how episodes are supposed to be numbered.  The hour long episodes are supposed to count as two episodes in the numbering.

As you will notice in this link, secret santa is listed as E13 because Niagara was E04-E05:

Wikipedia, TV.com and tvguide.com also all list secret santa as #13:
