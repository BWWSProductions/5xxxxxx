,flipswitch5point,2010-01-16T05:35Z,What bitrate?
,Fighterlegend,2010-02-17T05:21Z,"Pshh, I don't care about the bit-rate. It can be 96 kbs, and I wouldn't care.
As long as I have the music :P

This looks like a CD rip. Taken right off of the cd's.
Thanks djchopps0013, I have the albums ""Beautiful Lie, 30 Seconds to Mars"" as a disc. I just wanted to get This is war. I don't feel like copying those CD's to my PC either.

30 Seconds to Mars is a great band, and they deserve a bunch ;D"

The studio albums are obviously CD rips.

Thanks much."
