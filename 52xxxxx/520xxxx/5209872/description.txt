Bad Lieutenant formed in 2007 with New Orderâ€™s Bernard Sumner (guitar and vocals) alongside Phil Cunningham (guitar) and Jake Evans (guitar and vocals). We can now confirm that they have completed their long awaited debut LP Never Cry Another Tear which is set for worldwide release on 5th October 2009 on Triple Echo Records. The album features sounds that have helped make New Order such a treasured, innovative force over the past three decades, but also featured is a brand new voice from exotic Macclesfield, Jake Evans.

It is the project of New Orderâ€™s Bernard Sumner and Phil Cunningham following the departure of Peter Hook from New Order in the Spring of 2007. Jake Evans of Rambo and Leroy is also a member. Other collaborators are New Orderâ€™s Stephen Morris, drummer Jack Mitchell from Haven and bassist Alex James from Blur.
