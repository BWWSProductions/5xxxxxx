Also check out ""Demolition Man"". It is better these days than it was when it came out. I can see us being like that movie in 10 years."
,aelfred,2009-12-10T15:11Z,Thanks for this. My advice read 1984-George Orwell and Aldous Huxley's A brave New World. Better then any film you can watch. 
,Goblin77,2009-12-10T21:32Z,Anybody have episode 1 online yet?
,spanish_for_shark,2009-12-12T07:03Z,"Great up, thanks a lot to the upper.

,k3nd00d,2009-12-12T18:59Z,"All of the S01E01 versions I have downloaded have been different time lengths. That is very odd. The best version for S01E01 seems to be:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5202204/Conspiracy.Theory.With.Jesse.Ventura.S01E01.DSR.XviD-OMiCRON

But, the OMiCRON version of S01E02 is missing a scene. That makes mine (this page) the best S01E02."
,SerSpec-V,2009-12-13T20:01Z,This is full-screen and not wide-screen FYI. Thanks for the upload though.
,the_obsolete_man,2009-12-14T05:00Z,This is the 9/11 episode (2nd one).  Labeled wrong
,k3nd00d,2009-12-14T05:36Z,"This is from HDTV and is only in 4:3, there is no such thing as widescfeen for this.

Also, this is not mislabelled. It is labeled as S01E02 (correct) and the description says it is the 9/11 episode.

Are you people stupid?"
,k3nd00d,2009-12-14T13:55Z,"Ah, that is a group tag."
,k3nd00d,2009-12-14T14:01Z,I edited the title to clear up that confusion. LOL
,-SPQR-,2009-12-17T22:18Z,thanks dude!
[T],one_last_round,2009-12-24T06:07Z,"If you want to learn more about how the government is spying on all of its citizens check out this Documentary

BBC-Sex.Spying.Conspiracy (PBS.Discovery.History.Channel.Theory)

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5218472/BBC-Sex.Spying.Conspiracy_(PBS.Discovery.History.Channel.Theory)

Watch and see how the government is tapping your phone calls, reading your emails, and creating databases of everything about you. Companies get paid by the government to collect info on all of us. All the purchases we make. The spouse we might have or what kind of pets we have, or even our favorite color. Here we have an ex CEO of the company talking about all this. Watch as you see how some companies monitor all their employees even while they are away from work! Finally the video shows the infamous NSA and how more than 20,000 people working each day listen to your phone calls. Hear ex employees talking about it. The sources are from MSNBC, Discovery Channel, and History Channel along with others. Not only is this evidence but it comes from high sources and it takes you right to the heart of where this is all happening. "
,k3nd00d,2010-01-01T01:11Z,"I just now noticed the filename on this one has an extra .avi in it. Sorry about that, I normally never make such annoying mistakes as that. It is minor, but sloppy of me. LOL"
,MichaelUK,2010-11-01T01:07Z,The truth is out there!
