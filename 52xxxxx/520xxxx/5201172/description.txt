    There are two ways to register this program.                         
                                                                         
    The first is to run game and register it normally via menu: "Game    
    > Enter Registration Code".  However in this case you *MUST* let     
    it connect to the Internet where it will send both name and reg      
    code to server for blacklist check. This check is only done once     
    and the details will be accepted if reg code hasn't been             
    blacklisted.                                                         
                                                                         
    The second (and recommended) method is for those that don't want     
    their name and reg code send to a remote server.  Before doing       
    these steps you *MUST* run the game at least once and also make      
    sure the game isn't running.  The easy automated method is just to   
    hit the "Save Reg" button inside keygen to store details.  To        
    manually add name and reg code find the plist listed below and       
    edit "RegName" and "RegCode" respectively.

      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      
      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
