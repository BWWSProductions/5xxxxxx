,raviraj87,2009-12-10T16:11Z,"I need help :P . I'm using Windows 7(x64). I have ""Left 4 Dead 2 - Razor1911"". But when I run the ""setup.exe"" it gives me the message that ""This version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you are using....."" .
I think may be this ""setup.exe"" is for 32-bit OS. So can any one upload the setup for 64-bit OS so that I can atleast install the game..... Please!!!!! "

,tweakn,2009-12-12T03:58Z,"Thanks! This patch and some others made this game work properly! 

Maybe it's just me, but these last couple years PC games have been really REALLY bugged up the ass and the companies seem to leave it to the crackers/hackers/coders/loaders etc. to fix the game for them (for free), all the while bashing the hackers etc. in the media...

So to all the coders and hackers etc. out there that make a buggy game playable for everyone, a BIG THANKS!! We all know the companies ain't trying... *coughprototypegta4L4d2cough*"
,lllsnowlll,2009-12-12T10:51Z,"just curious... I always end up using your cracks, do you think you could start including the patches in your torrents? considering it says patch + crack ^_^ anyhow it takes a matter of seconds to find them so not a big deal thanks for all your work xD"
,FTL3,2009-12-12T15:50Z,"i prefer to include http link to patch, coz they very big, my web server (for fast web seeding) no space to put patches which are easily found on the internet."
,dio1sp,2009-12-20T10:26Z,what are the errors of this version? does this game crash on exit? when u quit the game theres an error appearing on the screen. ive seen your post on every torrent pages promoting your warez. 
,mr357magnum,2011-04-03T14:35Z,"If you get an error saying ""MODE NOT SUPPORTED"" because your monitor or TV does not support the Games Default Resolution, then here is the fix:

All you have to do is, go to your shortcut on the desktop, right click go to properties. There should be text ""Target"" and next to it a line of coding like this ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" 

Change ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" to ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" -w 1024 -h 768 or what ever your Monitor or TV Supports.

That should force it to start up with those dimensions. Also if you wanna skip the video in the beginning, type -novid after -h 768
