Notes:

   These live songs are very difficult to find on the net, I've compiled the greates thits that you can really enjoy.  There are few songs have pop/click issues, but the quality is very good. Performace wise, the concert captures Air Supply at their commercial prime, just like listening to their studio tracks.

  Seed and enjoy! :)
