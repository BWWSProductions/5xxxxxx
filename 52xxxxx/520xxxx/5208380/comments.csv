,gigahertz21,2009-12-11T00:48Z,"I hate how the Xbox 360 can only play 2 channel movies, WTF Microsoft, always doing some gay shit like that.  PS3 plays just about every media file right?  Why is MS such a bitch about it?  

I'm glad SM includes 2 channel audio though in his torrents and directions on how to do it.  Whenever I go over a friends house to watch one of SecretMyths movies on a Xbox 360, I have to do the 2 channel audio muxing.  

I thought the streaming software called TVersity would convert the audio and video for any movie and make it playable on the Xbox 360, but I tried it a few days ago on a friends 360 and it still wouldn't play any video files that had more then 2 channels of audio.

I personally own a Popcorn Hour A-110 to play back all my downloaded movies, but most of the time I take downloaded movies over to peoples places to watch them and the only thing they own is a Xbox 360.  Maybe I should just buy a WD TV Live player for Christmas, since its alot cheaper then a Popcorn Hour yet still works great, and just haul that around whenever I go to a friends house.  Plug it in to their TV and play back the movie, no more messing around with 2 channel audio files.

Anybody like to share what they use to play back downloaded movies?  WD TV Live player is $120 at Newegg with free shipping, great reviews for it on the egg and amazon.  If any of you are like me and don't want to mess with the Xbox 360 being a bitch about audio, then I'd have to recommend getting the below.


Western Digital USB 2.0 WD TV Live Network-Ready HD Media Player

Feel Ya.....A Whole Bunch Of Corruption 
Xbox360 Pain in the ass also I don't mess around with my ps3

This Is What I Recommend Personally I bought Myself A WD HD TV Media Player at Best buy for $100 with tax came out about $110

Full HD, To Be Honest, Its Worth It Seriously


This Is How I Enjoy My Secret Myth Releases

1) Sharp Aquos 46"" 1080p w/120HZ Fine Motion Enhanced LCD HDTV (Special Edition)

2) Bose Home Theater System

3) A WD External Hardrive( Bought Like Four 500GB Cause King Release 600+ Br Or Bd a day lol, I Might Need More In The Future)

4) Monster Cable Ultra 600 HDMI Video Cable 

and Of Course

5) The WD HDTV Media Player

All This Is Equal To Imax Itself....I don't Need To Visit Imax lol Its All Home

But Without King's Releases All Of This Shit Is Garbage, Nothin, Useless

LONG LIVE THE KING, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING BUDDY. *RESPECT


Hertz I Think you Should Look Into It.....Perfect Christmas Present, Truly Worth It"

,Metal|Boy,2009-12-11T13:36Z,"Hey secret_myth..this is my first comment. I have to say that you're my favorite uploader and I pretty won't download movies, unless they are uploaded by you. Your Brrips are the best!

Is there a possibility that you could upload Star Trek movies..1-10..in brrip format? Thanks.
"
,d_archangel,2009-12-11T15:50Z,Stop bothering Secretmyth with all your requests. You're going too far!

,secretmythfan,2009-12-12T00:01Z,"First..thanks for all you do.  Question.  I used to download your stuff and it worked fine w/ Apple TV...now no longer does.  Like your more recent uploads don't, but the older ones still do just fine.  It will load and be recognized in Itunes...but doesn't appear on Apple TV.  Any ideas here?

Thanks again for all you do."

,westpoint22,2009-12-12T11:01Z,"Too tight encoding, and it is NO compliment.
http://img.cx/RDME.png
Artifacts appear and hide throughout whole film.
It started in your films since about ""Funny people"" where it was especially UGLY. Maybe you turned some option in encoder or upgraded since then your software. Thanks for listening. My configuration XP SP3, K-Lite Codec Pack 2.62, CoreAVC Version 1.8.5.0. In KMplayer picture is clear, BUT he doesn't have such feature like ""sharpen complex"" which enhances details in video."
,hpisaliar,2009-12-12T14:06Z,"Hi secretmyth
I know you get this quite often but how do you manage to squeeze Blu-ray in 1.5 GB
when most of other veterans take 8 GB for 1080p and 4 GB for 720p.Is there anything you leave out or is it the beauty of mp4.Will it look the same way in any HTPC of having LCD screen sizes 40 inch and above.I hopw if everything else is same then these 8 GB torrents should not exist at all.Anyone else can say anything.Thanks anyway for your wonderful quality in sych small sizes."
,d_archangel,2009-12-12T20:35Z,Westpoint22 change your processor or your player. Give up using that fucked-up VLC. Artefacts never happen to me.
,westpoint22,2009-12-12T22:45Z,"d_archangel - moron,  I don't use vlc. your knowledge null and question not for you. So fuck off. You not help."
,Flamer123,2009-12-14T05:36Z,"@ westpoint22 - I think this is just you. From the screenshot the artifacts are very apparent so I don't think the encoder would have uploaded it if thats the case.

I'm a encoder myself and I can see 2 things wrong with your setup K-lite and Core AVC. First off K-lite is epic fail and is a pack full of conflicting codecs and other shit that hasn't been developed for years. Adding to this with coreavc running along side it, its bound to conflict (this is assuming you haven't carefully selected what codecs and such when you installed K-lite and tuned the settings). 

Or its because that your using the old version of coreavc. I think this is definately the culprit because as far as I am aware secert_myth is using a updated version of x264 to encode. In the new versions of x264 there is this weightp setting (ususally at 2) that causes artifacts on older versions of acoreavc. I think the new versions fixed this but not sure since I don't use it

My suggestions - get rid of k-lite and download CCCP (small/light and optimized plus lets you most stuff on the web save rmvbs and quicktime, just get real/quicktime alternative for these) or update coreavc to latest version. You can keep core avc and CCCP at the same time, just turn off h264 decoding in the CCCP settings.

Hope this helps and for the record VLC is epic fail "
,Flamer123,2009-12-14T05:49Z,"@ hpisaliar 

There is the audio part which significantly reduces the size, this is encoded in AAC other encoders probably used something better like the DTS audio (at least this isn't MP3 which is reasonable but probably the worst). Also with the video, h264 is lossy as compressed so details would have been lost from the original source. So when comparing secret_myths encodes to other larger encodes there should be some slight quality loss. Its recommended to use 3-6mbit for 720p. But this is still very good quality compared to someone like axxo lol, I never did like his small DVD resolutions."
,westpoint22,2009-12-14T12:20Z,"@ Flamer123

Thanks for answer, will try your configuration with ???P on second system and compare results. Not seriously regarded ???P as codec pack till today. But must say that KLcodec of this 2.62 version fully tested as ok on many clips and videos in different formats. I not said clearly in my previous comment, but all releases of 'secret_myth' played well(thank you 'secret_myth' for your wonderful job), and artifacts started appear only newest selected(NOT all) most fresh releases"
,westpoint22,2009-12-14T13:42Z,"In my comments mentioned codec 2.62,
 MY BAD, of course I meant klmcodec462.exe (Version 4.62). Again sorry."
,JLTerry,2009-12-15T11:24Z,I am having the same problem with artifacts as westpoint. I have always downloaded secret's uploads with no problem until about a week ago. I view and record onto disc using nero 8. Any suggestions on how to fix this problem?
,langes01x,2009-12-16T00:19Z,@westpoint: Your problem is indeed coreAVC as others have said. Check the coreavc forum for more information. This will be fixed in version 2.0 which has yet to come out unfortunately. Temporary solution is to disable coreAVC until the new version comes out.
,d_archangel,2010-01-04T16:04Z,"Westpoint22,you asshole, change your fucking brain then, stupid. You're not worth secretmyth's releases, mother fucker, I hope they will never ever work on that piece of shit computer of yours. Suck my dick bitch and choke on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
