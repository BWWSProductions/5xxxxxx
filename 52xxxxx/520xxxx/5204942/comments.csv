,neshaminy,2009-12-11T15:12Z,"There is a challenge with the file sizes.  According to MP3 duration calculation, the typical book is about 2.7 hours.  In reality, some are more than 7 hours.  That leads me to believe one of three possibilities: (1) Windows MP3 calculation of duration is incorrect. (2) books are erroneously created (3) these are seriously abridged versions.  

Any thoughts?"

Oh and nothing is abridged."
