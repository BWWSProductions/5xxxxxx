,schlierkamp,2012-02-11T07:57Z,"also lmao @booduh1181

The 2nd time? You had to watch it twice to get it? There's nothing to get, dude. It's about life. That's it. With really good acting. Nuff said. This is not effen The Prestige or some sh*t where you actually do have to watch it twice."
,justblaze666,2012-06-28T00:40Z,"theres 3 files, a CD 1, a CD 2, and a third video file, mine shows its quicktime.  is this also the movie?"
,tamal25,2012-06-30T07:50Z,"No, the third file is not part of the movie. It's not even a kilobyte. It's for online streaming, just ignore it."
