Doug of the Dead / Suburbs of the Apes

Doug of the Dead: "Fast-Food Zombie Mall Gore-fest" 
is Parker and Josh's latest movie attempt. However 
they just can't get some scenes right. They use the 
SALIVATOR-X8, a new Mr. Meaty invention, to turn 
mall patrons into zombies, in order to film Doug 
in action taking them down. One problem: Doug's 
afraid of zombies.

Suburbs of the Apes: A new game console called
 the Game Craze is coming out and Josh and Parker 
want to be the first to get one. So, Parker builds 
a time machine that will transport them two months 
into the future. But instead, the time machine 
transports them to the year 2676, when apes rule 
the earth.
