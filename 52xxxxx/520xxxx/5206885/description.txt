                    Carrie.                                  
                    The thing about being smaller than everyone  
                    else means you have to shout to be noticed. The  
                    group are preparing to leave the island and  
                    Carrie can't wait to get away. Looking into her  
                    future, Carrie is being taught how to be a  
                    childrens' entertainer by Darren, who is  
                    finding her quite a challenge. When she arrives  
                    at her friend Claire's house to perform at a  
                    kids' party, she feels betrayed by the way  
                    things pan out. When an argument erupts, Carrie  
                    finally hears some home truths. Back on the  
                    island, a surprise guest looks to lighten the  
                    mood. Last in the series.
