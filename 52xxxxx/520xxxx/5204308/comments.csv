,morphaeus08,2010-01-08T00:43Z,Try VLC: www.videolan.org/vlc/
,shanejoe,2010-01-13T11:03Z,"Correct I have re-torrented them and tried VLC, do not use quicktime, these episodes open fine in VLC, and ps no viruses or anything that i can find on a mac"
,shanejoe,2010-01-13T12:46Z,"dont bother with this torrent, only episode 1, 15 and 24 will play, the other ones never load, at least for me on a MAC OS 10.6.2"
,emillkim,2010-01-15T21:05Z,"POINTLESS. THE FILES DON""T!!!! WORK."
,morphaeus08,2010-01-18T22:26Z,"if VLC doesn't work for you, try DivX"
,psphackerowned,2010-03-03T04:36Z,this format IS supported on the 360/PS3 according to this link http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/nxe/gamesandmedia/movies/videofaq/viewvideoplaybackfaq.aspx
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2010-05-18T14:20Z,"only 1st & last eps would play for me the rest are of a codec unknown & i have a shitloada codec sites+none can find one for this format-perhaps the uploader modded the file or summat,anyway i can only get 1st & last eps 2 play"
,mrpeiceofmind666,2010-06-28T17:35Z,if you have the kml lite codec pack then all you have to do is click properties on the file and change it from .m4v to .avi and it will run on windows media player. or if u dont have codec change to .mpeg
,caoquemordeuhomem,2010-07-18T17:16Z,Only the first episode worked for me.
,vmelkon,2010-11-11T14:48Z,"I downloaded ep 5 to 11. None of them can be played. Tried with Windows media player on Vista. DivX, QuickTime, VLC. Deleting this junk. What the heck is a m4v file anyway?"
,MarkGreen,2012-01-07T03:48Z,"avoid this torrent like the plague and just let it die without seeders. this is a bad rip with bad uncommon codec used.

only ep1,15,24 will play. the rest is just shit. just get your season 4 from other torrents.

avoid like the plague! you've been warned!"
,KarpoofdaJulii,2012-02-14T01:45Z,"Damn I probably should have read the comments before downloading. Only episodes 1,15 and 24 work. The rest are garbage."
