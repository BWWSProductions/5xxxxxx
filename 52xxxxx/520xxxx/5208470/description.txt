Do you enjoy the new World Vision ads that add an extra 1-inch bezel to the whole f*cking program?   Do you like the smaller adspace at the bottom of the program window?  Me neither.

This is a replacement DLL for TheWeatherNetwork's program "WeatherEye"

Tested OS: Windows XP

The Weather Network says it supports Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7




1) Download WeatherEye here:
   http://weathercentre.pelmorex.com/install/twn/en/WeatherEyeDownloader.exe

2) Install it

3) Once you've got a System Tray icon, right click it, exit.

4) Now copy the DLL you've just downloaded to:

C:Documents and SettingsYOUR_USER_NAMELocal SettingsApplication DataTheWeatherNetworkWeatherEye

(different for Vista, 7 .  Just search for weathereye.dll on your system, and replace the file)

4b)Overwrite the file that's in there.

5) Now open WeatherEye again. - POOF, no more 1 inch bezel of ads, and just a placeholder on the bottom.
Clean as a whistle.

Do leave comments as to your success.

Tested with Windows XP SP3 and the latest WeatherEye 3.0.0.36 from the link provided.

Lastly, this will probably stop working when a new version comes out.


For the curious: I opened the dll with a hex editor, and "zeroed out" two instances of "adstart", no other changes.
