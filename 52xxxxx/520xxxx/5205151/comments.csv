In Win 7 copy the patch in installed directory and patch the programme by right clicking  the patch and ""Run as Administrator"". The patching is applied, when we set the password it accepts ant password but when we run it from pen drive it ACCEPTS ONLY 123. 
plzzzzzzzzzz if any one have a better patch tell me coz I'm triying to find a better patch form last 1 year, tried nearly all versiond, patches, cracks, serials, etc but NO SUCCESS till now."
