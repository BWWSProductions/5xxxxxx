This is the other story by the same author as The Woman in White.


The biggest problem I have had with Pirate Bay has been that my first one or two 

attempts to upload gets lost or rejected.  If I have included an extentended

comment in it, that, too, disappears. I will miss Pirate Bay just as I've missed

Mininova. After they have both gone it will seem that the whole world has grown 

dark.
