There is an album torrent on some other site, but you have to have a password to open the zip, and of course there is some ludicrous procedure to obtain the password, of which I decided to try, and failed miserably at. So I don't think that there is a real password for the zip file. So if someone could either take this video and split up the audio into mp3 files for each song or just rip the CD it would be much appreciated."
