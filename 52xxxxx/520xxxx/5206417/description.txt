         Christina gets approval for a school soccer team but only by  
          volunteering to be its coach. Con borrows an amplifier from   
          his uncle to allow Jodie to make a demo tape of her songs.    
          Danielle creates some controversy when she asks to try out    
          for the new soccer team. Rumours about Nick and Jodie's       
          relationship make their way through the school. Chaka faces   
         off against Rivers.

         Our S01E02 and E03 are considered just E02 in the online      
          guides, which of course throws all the numbering out. Both    
          episodes have their own set of full credits, so the guides    
          are obviously wrong :p  You'll just have to live with it.
