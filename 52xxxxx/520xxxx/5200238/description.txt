release notes
My girlfriend is really into the "So You Think You Can Dance" TV series,
especially the routines of the coreopgrapher Sonya Tayeh. So I decided to
give her this "Sound track" featuring the titles Sonya has used in her
pieces throughout the series.

Please note that I simply searched the net for the titles included in this
"release" so expect some random quality. I did, however, run them through
MP3Gain to normalize the volume levels.
