                    Twist Of Fate.                           
                    Guest starring Ian Kelsey as Brendan Newlyn. DC  
                    Grace Dasari re-opens the investigation into an  
                    old missing person case when the sister of the  
                    woman involved holds a man at knife-point in a  
                    Soho brothel, claiming he knows where her  
                    sister is. When a body is found, Grace feels  
                    guilty that she did not devote more time to the  
                    investigation at the time of the woman's  
                    disappearance.
