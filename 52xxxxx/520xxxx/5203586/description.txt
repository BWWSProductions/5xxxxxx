10 years after we first filmed Air Baltic on their Avro RJ70 and Fokker 50 we return to Riga for a new program as the airline has been under serious expansion in recent years.

While this DVD includes the Fokker 50 it really focuses on the newly delivered Boeing 757s as well as on the fleet of Boeing 737-300 and 737-500.

Besides a domestic flight within Latvia we take you on routes to Egypt, Finland, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the UK. A total of 15 flights are included in this 3 hour program, some great pilot presentations, some cabin footage and aircraft action from Riga Airport.
