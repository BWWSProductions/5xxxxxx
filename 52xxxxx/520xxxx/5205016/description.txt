 At nearly 400 pounds, Tracy Orbison (Hubbel Palmer) is  
 a wide target. When he sets out to pursue his dream of  
 acting, the grocery clerk finds an assortment of people 
 waiting to dash his dreams: his acting coach (William   
 Baldwin), who has designs on his sister Peggy (24's     
 Mary Lynn Rajskub); his juvenile-delinquent friends,    
 who suck him into their petty crimes; and his           
 God-fearing, self-loathing mother (Academy Award        
 nominee Kathleen Quinlan). Through it all, Tracy        
 remains irrepressibly upbeat, convinced he's destined   
 for something big.
