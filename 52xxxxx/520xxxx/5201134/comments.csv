@mrhinter: Only when Canadian one-day earlier encodings have been done by the scene-groups, and only as Xvid re-encodings; not HDTV 720p re-encodings I usually do. Sorry, that's way I've done it. Only 'cause their ""exclusivity""..."

[V],twentyforty,2009-12-07T17:25Z,"No problems mrhinter, 'cause of you I've looked at tvrage dot com (go there and bookmark it) and found out:
 L&O SVU    11x10 09/Dec/2009.
So, one more and last SVU airing this year.
And... I'll up it, of course."
