I'm sick of removed rapid & other share links so here is torrent for everyone.
Upload speed sucks so have patience. 

In this demonstration the instructor starts off by explaining the nodes that will be used throughout the rest of the DVD. From there he goes into depth on how to create a material that can transition from one set of textures and parameters, into another. He also gets into how to make a character completely dissolve away.

Once the materials are setup, the instructor goes into how to control them in Cascade, Kismet, and Matinee. While inside Matinee, you learn how to time the dissolve to match the animation, and also how to swap entire materials and allow the character to dissolve after he has transformed from stone to real life.
