Aussie singer/songwriter Ben Lee started out as an angsty, teenage indie rocker, but since then he has truly grown into his own skin as a songwriter. His fourth solo album, Hey You. Yes You. is a sophisticated pop effort with a dark undercurrent of coming-of-age realizations. With producer Dan the Automator at the helm, Hey You is a surprisingly harmonious union between Lee's supple melodicism and his producer's paroxysmal pulse. Simple guitar string bends, wrap languidly around the sparse beats that drive the songs, bright melodies dance over fuzzed-out power chords and airy piano arpeggios drift above thick, stop-and-go trip hop rhythm tracks.
