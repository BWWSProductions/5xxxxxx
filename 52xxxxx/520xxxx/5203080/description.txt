Lizzie McGuire: Xtreme Xmas

Lizzie and Gordo are at a Christmas charity drive where they bring presents to an unlikely-looking Santa Claus. Lizzie fervently hopes to win the grand prize in the Christmas parade with her idea for a "Rock & Roll Christmas" float, but she'll have competition from Tudgeman, who is building a "Christmas Deathstar" float and also Kate and her cousin Amy, who have hired professionals to build theirs.
