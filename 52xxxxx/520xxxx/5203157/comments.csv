,eXeQiEl,2010-04-25T22:49Z,"well, thanks for being online! haha, i just realised a pop up message told me the SRT is downloaded.

I dindt realised, untid y saw it. Cause i said ""but the movie is already downloaded, and im online seeding it, so... why is uTorrent saying me its downloaded=? dled again?""
so i checked, and realised that the finish message was from the little srt subtitle file.

I was expecting that u conected someday to catch the file again, cause it seems that ure the only one with the file. I almost lost my hope on you to being connected.

Well, now i have it too, so im gonna seed it from today. There were at least 30 ppl waiting for u to connect, haha. They were waiting for ur subt

So. thanks again

greets from Argentina
