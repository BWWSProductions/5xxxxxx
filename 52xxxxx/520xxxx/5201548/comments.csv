why the BCA code ????

has anyone tested this - does it work past level 2?"

But to play the game you need to modify you wii, either with some software or with a chip on you wii. 

Here is some links to a way to softmod your wii, but if you don't do it right you can break your wii.

Firmware 4.2: http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/24630-hackmii-0-5-works-all-sys-menus-4-2-included.html

if your are completely unfamiliar with computers don't try this."
