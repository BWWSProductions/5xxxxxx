,RaitoKunRyuk,2009-12-08T02:15Z,"I AM seeding, its just that no matter what I do I cannot connect to EVERY peer that is trying to download. I get MAYBE 10 out of 50 peers that I can upload to."
,tj090901,2009-12-08T02:20Z,"Whatever you did, it fixed it. But you weren't even in the swarm before."
,RaitoKunRyuk,2009-12-08T02:31Z,Weird... Something must be wrong with my router or computer or something... Now I'm supposed to be connected to 3 peers but none of them are downloading... let me update uTorrent.
,HeavyMetalMachinist,2009-12-14T22:40Z,"Please seed more, been downloading for almost 5 days and don't have a single episode completed."
,RaitoKunRyuk,2009-12-19T03:24Z,"I am sorry, but I downloaded a bad TPB torrent and had to have my computer fixed. I will seed once it comes back from the repair shop."
,HeavyMetalMachinist,2009-12-20T22:22Z,"I managed to finish downloading and I'll keep seeding for a while. Thanks for uploading, great series. "
