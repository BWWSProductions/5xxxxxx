Here are two different versions of the breathtaking "I'll Find My Way Home" by Jon & 

Vangelis.  The version that is slightly altered appeared on Vangelis' Odyssey: The 

Definitive Collection CD.  I would appreciate some feedback as to which version you 

think sounds better.  During the instrumental section in the middle of the song on

the altered version you can hear an instrument that sounds a lot like a cowbell.  

This sound does not exist on the original recording.  Also, there are additional 

synthesizer sounds used during the beginning.  Again, please enjoy and please leave 

some comments.  Which version do you like more?  Which has the best audio quality?
