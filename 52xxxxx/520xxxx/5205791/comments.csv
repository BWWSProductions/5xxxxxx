,Kuuchu,2010-02-23T05:42Z,"Can't seem to get this to work.
I try to authenticate the program and when I go to enter in my email and click activate [just like the instructions say] I get a ""This email is not on our server"" popup.
Well of coarse it's not gonna be on your server, it's FAKE.
I can't seem to overcome this problem, help?"
,the.count,2010-08-19T10:07Z,"The Installation was perfect..and the Product Activation with the packaged Keygen was successfull too.

As for as for the utility of the Software itself.. I'm undecided.. Maybe its the incorporated MAC support with some functions useless for Windows users.. 

Anyway, thanks a lot hellboy!"
