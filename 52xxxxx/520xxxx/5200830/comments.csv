,swampmatt,2010-11-30T05:25Z,"LOL.... Firstly, thanks for this upload. Secondly.. yikes - this has to be the absolute worst Christmas album ever! 

You've gotta be a true fan of Star Wars to enjoy this! But the credits do mention that R2-D2 whistling sounds on one of the songs was performed by a young man (age 18) by the name of Jon BonJovi. (credited as John BonGiovi) Before he was famous. hahaha"
