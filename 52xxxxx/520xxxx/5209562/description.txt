Ripped December 11, 2009

I ordered this CD from Australia because it was the only place
where you could get a copy with the three bonus tracks on it.
Common, I'm in Canada, Anvil is from Canada, why not release the
special disc here and not half way around the world...

I ordered it brand new from eBay, or course it comes opened and
used, but oh well, it works and looks perfect.

This disc from Australia is labeled as "This Is Thirteen [Bonus
Tracks]"

Here is the song listing, you can see how there are three extra
tracks with this rip.

I ripped it with IMGBurn at low speed. So just load up the .cue in
IMGBurn and burn it to a CD. You will have an exact one to one copy
of the original.

Enjoy!
