I got frustrated by all of the incomplete torrents for Stephen Hawking material so I made this one.

All rips are mp3 V-0 done with dbPowerAmp

All of the tracks are labeled with chapters and then subdivided by track listing within chapters so you can easily find your place.

I will be making one for History in a Nutshell shortly as well and if there's anything I can do differently to improve them let me know.

Enjoy!
