This is a ballet based on the events surrounding the tragedy fo Mayerling.

The ballet starts with Mary Vetsera's burial and then moves on to 1881, back to the wedding of Rudolf and Stephanie. After the ballet we see how Rudolf is being pushed to choose for Hungary's freedom. At the wedding-night it becomes clear how different Rudolf and Stephanie are. Then we move to 1888. Rudolf and Mary meet at a tavern and Mary is taken by his charm. Countess Marie Larisch finds a way to bring the two together and so the tragedy unfolds.

What I liked was that they used several little things know to historians and how every actor resembled the real person. Also I liked the quote from Mary near the end and the information you get on the aftermath and how everyone involved lived after it.
