********************************************************************************

In a book Holdren co-authored in 1977, the man now firmly in control of science
policy in the United States under POTUS Obama, topics include:

+ Women could be forced to abort their pregnancies, whether they wanted to or 
  not;

+ The population at large could be sterilized by infertility drugs intentionally
  put into the nation's drinking water or in food;

+ Single mothers and teen mothers should have their babies seized from them
  against their will and given away to other couples to raise;

+ People who "contribute to social deterioration" (i.e. undesirables) "can be
  required by law to exercise reproductive responsibility" -- in other words,
  be compelled to have abortions or be sterilized.

+ A transnational "Planetary Regime" should assume control of the global economy
and also dictate the most intimate details of Americans' lives -- using an armed
international police force.
