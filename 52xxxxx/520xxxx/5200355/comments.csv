,NIbemo,2010-05-04T15:08Z,"Allright, please tell me; Does this work online too? :P"
,billshitter,2010-05-06T00:57Z,"@ NIbemo

yes offcourse it works online.

this torrent includes the 1.6 > 1.7 update patch and mp crack/patch.

you still have to update to > 1.6 patch since this torrent does not contain those files.


good luck."

it should work but if it doesnt work out for you you should find a tuturial and do exactly as it says... 

the steps should be..:

1. install game but DONT crack it.

2. install all the uppdate patches so you have version 1.7.. (only 1.6 to 1.7 is included in this torrent so you have to download them somwhere else...)

3. when you have updated the game you should start single player but unplugg the internet cable before you create a profile in singel player.

4. start the mp-patch that is included in this torrent and then start the game from codWaW_mp (or whatever) and hit f3 button(to turn on mp-patch)..

5. press the ""ยง"" to open console and paste server ip.. (connect 123.456.789)

6. as soon as you are ingame press f4 (to turnoff mp-pacth)"
,h4ck3ric,2011-01-05T01:30Z,"Wait, so do we ever crack it? If we just want single player with the patches?"
,KEEVVY,2011-02-14T01:29Z,"@billshitter Hey man does it matters if the single player is bloked by the firewall.
And I tryed the mp, it always starts with crate online profile, so I chose cancel. 
now I write connect 193.33.186.111:27960 this is the only server I found.
It's showing conecting 1 2 ...8 and then conection timed out. I tryed 10 times and same thing , can you advise me what I'm doing rong?"
,yeison578,2011-07-23T16:58Z,does this help me on the cd invalid 
,Morgul40,2012-04-10T22:22Z,"this shit isnt working for me. i turn on the ""patch"" and punkbuster throws me out of the game. f4 doesnt do a single thing."
