,laboro45,2009-12-13T20:29Z,Awesome dude just what I was looking for. 
,Leffebongo,2009-12-18T16:02Z,What version is this? European or American?
,tehkrizz,2010-01-13T20:40Z,This is the American version.
,x8jason8x,2010-01-25T08:28Z,"Yeah I'm dling this, after a looooong hiatus (I quit just after WoTG release), I'm just wondering if the POL.exe you included will work with XP?"
,tehkrizz,2010-01-25T14:52Z,"Jason, the POL.exe included is for Vista. For XP you will install POL with FFXICollection2008 > PlayOnlinesetup.exe

Make sure you take a look at the instructions txt doc if you're confused."
,x8jason8x,2010-01-25T19:59Z,"Hahah yeah uh, I feel dumb now, I suppose I should have read the box first! Thanks for the upload."
,thamask21,2010-02-23T17:41Z,"Same, took a long hiatus and since I don't wanna go back to the ps2 version...and def not the 360 version...I'll try this. "
,thamask21,2010-02-23T22:27Z,So finally after 1 year made up my mind to come back and try it on pc this time...good upload
,tehkrizz,2010-03-02T16:04Z,"Thamask21, thank you and welcome back to FFXI. Just in time for some major changes."
,theeleman,2010-05-15T02:45Z,question? will the american version work in eu? if i make a new acount using it? obv i still have my playonline
,tehkrizz,2010-05-20T20:15Z,"Theeleman, I'm not sure. I think it's safe to assume that the only difference would be the language it's in."
,Rocker10,2011-02-21T22:44Z,Is it possible to run this on a private server?
