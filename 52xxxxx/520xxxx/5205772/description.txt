    Lion Pride is an addictive, fast-paced game in which you control      
    lions as they stalk their territory and ambush prey. Hunt zebra,      
    warthog, gazelle and Cape buffalo and fend off predatory hyenas as    
    you race to feed your cubs and preserve your pride. Use simple        
    finger gestures to position your lions, slowly stalk prey and run     
    in for the attack. Coordinate multiple lions to trap animals or       
    take down larger game. Its a race against the clock - if you dont   
    provide enough food for your cubs, they will go hungry and its      
    game over! Game Features: - Use intuitive touch gestures to          
    control up to four lions - Strategically position your lions to       
    stalk and attack four kinds of prey - Ramp up the challenge over      
    eight levels - See how long you last in Survival Mode - Learn fun     
    facts about all of the Lion Pride animals - See how you stack up      
    against other players via the Online Scoreboard - Challenge other     
    players to beat your best score! Visit the Lion Pride website for
