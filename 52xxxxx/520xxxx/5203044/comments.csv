is it really AIO or just ultimate x86/x64? "
,ltorrentstorm,2009-12-09T03:41Z,"Sajeen:  as you are also the uploader for Damasgate, could you please point me to some web page where I can read more info about this in English?  I tried Damasgate's pages, but all are in Arabic.  What I did seem to understand Damasgate borrowed from Rocker's Team's idea?

Mr. noGay:  Yes this is a real AIO.  Take a look at the screenshots in these pages: http://www.damasgate.com/vb/t167072/. "
,sajeen,2009-12-10T06:57Z,"This is the comment I have written about this edition, It is a real x86 and x64 edition and these are the features from the winrar comments:

This is the first Arabic tri-lingual PreActivated version of windows 7 

I am Sajeen Al-Mo'anat from www.DamasGate.com

my specialization is Instrumentation which is a part of electronic engineering

If I could, I swear to god that I would have put my finger print on this edition

I challenge any one in this world to come up with something like this.

The characteristics of this edition:

1. Trilingual-------> Arabic, English and French.

2. PreActivation technology that depends on the presence of the loader 
and puts the slp key and activates the windows according to your BIOS information.

3. Automatic recognition of the BIOS.

4. Automatic OEM theme will be installed according to the system.

5. A new wallpaper for the setup.

6. It was made out of the original MSDNAA windows 7 ultimate copy.

7. It passes ms tintelligent test of genuine copy of windows and whether it was cracked or not. 

This work almost costed me my life due to desperation, but finally I got what I ever hoped to.

,sajeen,2009-12-10T07:18Z,"This edition contains all the versions of win 7.

untilmate x86 and x64 is the only one that let you switch between languages and others you have to specify the language from the setup screen otherwise you can not change language later unless you use vistalizor 2.3
"
,sajeen,2009-12-10T13:41Z,"Hi, Mr. Pattyrob

yes, you are right, I was wondering what to name this edition

this was my first name due to black theme that is installed automatically depending on your BIOS information, but when I looked around I found dozens of black edition, hence I decided to rename it...

thanks for the headsup

yours faithfully

,ltorrentstorm,2009-12-11T14:26Z,"Mr. Sajeen:

Yes I had heard of you from Damasgate and other webpages.  It is a pleasure to correspond with you, and thank you so much for replying to my questions above.

Damasgate and the Vortex team are still colaborators?  They used to be.  If I recall, you also helped with Windows Vortex 2G and 3G.  2G is and will always be the best XP OS ever.  I am still using it after 2 years!

Thank you for all the hard work with Win 7.  It is truly appreciated!! My specialty is hardware engineering, but now computers are only a hobby.  I relate well to your feelings of desperation from past experiences.  Kudos, and many thanks! "

,ltorrentstorm,2009-12-16T06:48Z,"After having tested this on a 5 year old LG/IBM mb, with 1 GB Ram, 128 MB ATi video, with an old 20GB WD Caviar hd,  I can truly say that Sajeen and Damasgate outdid themselves!  I have seen nothing better in the various Vista and Seven platforms!  Truly sleek, quiet, speedy, no hiccups, no crashes, no hang ups, nothing.  Sajeen and Damasgate outdid themselves and clearly knocked everyone else out of the water!  Well done, guys!"
,ltorrentstorm,2009-12-16T06:56Z,"Oh yes, and permanent activation from the start?  It didn't even ask!  No loaders, no nothing! Damn! you're good!"

,lmoralez,2010-05-08T05:27Z,Hi!  I am very impressed with your work.  I installed it on my computer about 4 months ago and it works super!  Do you have any upgrades to this version?  Please let me know either way.
,ruchirrathore,2010-05-08T14:41Z,"Sajeen, I'm writing this comment in hope of a reply from you. I'm quite impressed with this work. But I'm creating a slipstream version of windows 7 using this iso, with RT Seven Lite. I am encountering an error message (something about unhandled exception).
My query to you this that, does this ISO allow slipstreaming? Can i use this ISO to create a slipstream version without additional strings like language packs in your iso as well as built-in language packs provided by MS, and remove unwanted features like media center, tablet PC features, add more wall papers, codec packs like CCCP, adobe reader, flash, java 7, shockwave player etc., keeping the windows preactivated??
I hope you understand what I am aiming for?
Please advice if there is something like already out there on TPB or anywhere else on net..."
,sajeen,2011-04-04T15:06Z,"@ruchirrathore

Unfortunately, RT7lite supports only the original unmodified versions of windows 7, 

Bensam, the developer of this software is a friend of mine, I will talk to him to rectify this issue.

Yes, you can add any software without affecting the activiation methodology.

Thank you
