[V],thethingy,2009-12-17T03:25Z,thanks man.
,Dutchice,2010-01-19T16:50Z,Just for clarification this contains both original installers version v70016T_20091106 for 32 & 64 bit. You can download the latest installer yourself from aps2.toshiba-tro.de/bluetooth/?page=download and overwrite its TosBtMng.exe file after installation still with the fantastic crack included in this torrent. THANKS to the crackmakers & thethingy
,Watatsumi,2010-01-26T20:03Z,"thank you!

so far, it works very for me with the latest driver available at this time, v7.10.4(T)
v71004T_20091210_x32.exe

finally i can use again the bluetooth mouse i got for christmas, the stack decided to stop working yesterday and i have been using MouseKeys the entire day."
[V],thethingy,2010-01-27T08:54Z,itll work for all v7 editions and if no new bluetooth standard or operating system is released it will work on v8 also
,borgy15,2010-03-25T22:52Z,Thanks thethingy!! You are a genius!
,mortallkombat,2010-04-23T16:13Z,this just did not work for me at all.....i installed it and it kept telling me to plug in device  and click yes .......................it brought out another woindow saying installing device software.

Have a nice day
[V],thethingy,2010-04-23T16:19Z,"^^ it is working but youll need to uninstall the bluesoil as you cant have 2 bluetooth managers and also turn off all bluetooth devices when installing and note that there may not be drivers for your perticular phone etc, this is a manager not a driver pack"
,mortallkombat,2010-04-23T16:22Z,i am using a class1 bluetooth
,mortallkombat,2010-04-27T18:59Z,its really not my happy day..........i have gone thru lots of attempts and nothing seems to go right................i uninstalled the bluesolei and tried installing it but still it didnt work at all it still says plug in device and click yes............i really don't like disturbing people i have read some post here of people thanking u that it worked ..............so thats a lot for the concern
,albanian_gang,2010-07-17T16:38Z,thanks thethingy and all seeders now i have the best bluetooth
,iteachu,2010-09-14T23:59Z,"Thank you so much thethingy for this upload! Struggled with the Broadcom (widcomm) installer program - wouldn't detect my dongle. But this installed and worked a treat - I used the 32 bit installer on XP Home SP2.
Word of advice though, Remote Procedure Call Locator service needs to be loaded to connect to other devices.. but that'll only matter if you've streamlined your services and switched it off in the first place :-)
Much, much appreciated, thanks."
,GothVampress91010,2010-12-18T06:43Z,do u have to have an actual bluetooth headset for this?
,AndreLinoge,2010-12-26T23:33Z,excellent!!
,ers2258,2011-01-03T23:35Z,"The latest Toshiba Bluetooth Stack for Windows 7 x64 on Toshibas Site is v8.00.03
Can anyone confirm that the crack for the TosBtMng in this torrent will work on the v8.0.00.03 or not?"
,riteonman2001,2011-01-04T06:38Z,Awesome. Thanks. I finally can stop uninstalling and reinstalling every 30 days.
,cyfa89,2011-01-05T13:32Z,"im having the same problem as mortallkombat
i tried to install (x64) but it hangs on the same thing and doesnt recognise the internal device. i went to the toshiba website and downloaded 8.00.03 which installs fine and works but the crack makes it continuously turn on and off, so im stuck on evaluation period at the moment. please help!"
[V],thethingy,2011-01-07T18:16Z,"cyfa89 v8 is for sale so you need serials and this version doesn't work with v8, best thing to do is go to device manager and remove all the blue tooth drivers even the hidden ones;

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315539

uninstall both v7 and 8 of this then restart and you'll have (should) a cleanish system to put v7 back to. "
,hibbo15,2011-01-13T01:08Z,"You are absolutely amazing, bought a cheap Class 1 dongle off ebay, no drivers would allow me to use it with Windows 7. Found this Toshiba driver and hay presto :D. Thank You!!"
,cyfa89,2011-01-16T22:03Z,"hi thethingy, many thanks for your help and upload

it didnt work, i followed the instructions on the link you provided and deleted all the bluetooth parts
started to install bt stack again after removing old version and it asks me to plug in device again. while the toshiba bt stack was installing windows updated with and 'enemurator' and also in went the hp integrated module. so deleted them and turned internet off, began installing again and it still asks for me to plug in device :(

please help"
,godswallops,2011-01-23T15:37Z,"Fantastic.

Worked on an ASUS i5 laptop under W7 x64, although windows tried its best to install while the Toshiba s/w was running.

Once the drivers were installed and the logitech BT M555B mouse was found, the latest x64 SetPoint (6.2) app s/w from logitech worked just fine.

TA :)


PS: all bluesolei stuff failed miserably."
,tyrash,2011-02-16T02:07Z,"Hey guys,
I've got a question.
First off all ty to Thethingy!
Everything goes fine with skype, but that's also the only program it works with. I use ventrilo and it doesn't work, also I would like to listen to windows mediaplayer through my bluetooth headset? Does anyone have an idea how to solve this? Can't find anything on the net. I use W7 and I already made it standard device. I see the volume going up and down when I have mediaplayer on, but I don't hear anything. Many thanks "
