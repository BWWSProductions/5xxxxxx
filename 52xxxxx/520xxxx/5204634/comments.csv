,shinnok789,2009-12-10T09:35Z,"The keygen works very well. Open the keygen, and from the drop-down menu in the top-left select Acdsee Pro v3.0 instead of Acdsee 2009 v11 that is selected by default. In works flawlessly, thanks."

,Tektool,2010-01-27T09:11Z,"So I am asking the same question after doing a google search on CORE10K in this file I found the following and ask why you would include it or what it's purpose is:

CORE10K.EXE has been seen to perform the following behavior:

The Process is packed and/or encrypted using a software packing process
Adds a Winlogon Notification DLL to automatically load on system start up
Found on infected systems and resists interrogation by security products
Uses low level functions to hide itself from the user and from system/security processes
Executes a Process
Injects code into other processes
This process creates other processes on disk
Registers a Dynamic Link Library File
This Process is a file infector which modifies program files to include a copy of the infection
Drops known malicious software during execution
Reads email address and phone book details
Uses DNS to retrieve the IP address for web sites
Visits web sites on your PC without you knowing
Executes Processes stored in Temporary Folders
Opens browser pop ups 
CORE10K.EXE has been the subject of the following behavior:

Created as a process on disk
Deleted as a process from disk
Registered as a Dynamic Link Library File
Executed as a Process
Created as a new Background Service on the machine
Has code inserted into its Virtual Memory space by other programs
Terminated as a Process
Executed from Temporary Folders"
,Damien74,2010-03-01T15:45Z,"Tektool. Strange name for a noob :)

Core10K.exe is just a file where you can see info about the releasegroup, in this case ""Core"".
No need to use it if you don't want to."
,SVSilent,2010-03-04T14:10Z,Thanks man!
,hiero2,2010-05-19T13:52Z,"the crack is a malware. 

As soon as I downloaded my AVG detected a virus on keygen.exe. 

Then i removed it, and trying to figuring out how to install without keygen i loaded CORE10K.EXE. Few minutes after my AVG went crazy detecting virus and trojans everywhere!

I also saw some odd stuffs, like IE opening up to show adds and files being initialized (with windows) from temporary directories. Just like the things listed by Tektool. 

took a while for me to clean it all up.

you've been warned! Download at your own risk"
