    Use the touch screen to squash bugs as they try and "escape" to the   
    bottom of the screen. Squash multiple bugs at the same time for       
    bonus points. Wave after wave of bugs try and escape, and your        
    mission is to stop them. See how many levels you can get through      
    without letting 10 bugs escape. Earn bonus points based on the        
    level you are on, the number of bugs you squash, and your accuracy    
    in squashing. Great graphics and sound effects with over 50           
    different bugs, and more coming with each update! How far can you     
    get?
