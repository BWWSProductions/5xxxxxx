,kenpoo,2009-12-10T10:11Z,"Thanks for posting this torrent.  The nice aspect of this torrent is that it contains the avi versions of episodes 16 (Alaska) and 18 (Tucson), which are immediately playable.  I have not found a standalong avi version of episode 18 to date on any torrent site, only the rar version which needds to be reintegrated before playing.  Also, viewers seem to have had problems finding the Alaska episode, so this set makes it easy to obtain.  Viewers should know though this is not the complete season 2 and does not include episode 19 (New Brunswick), but the latter is already easily found in avi version.  This set is very worthwhile for having the playable avi versions of episodes 16 (Alaska) and 18 (Tucson) and pulling together the first 18 episodes in one place and all in immediately  playable avi versions for easy download.   Initially this torrent had only 1 seed, which made downloading the complete set very difficult, but as of today its seeds have increased to at least 35 and thus is easily downloadable in complete form.  Thanks again."
