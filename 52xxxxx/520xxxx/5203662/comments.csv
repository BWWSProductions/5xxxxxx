Download this one:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5208084/Kaspersky_Internet_Security_2010-9.0.0.736

JUST INSTALL IT (don't use the keys)

After the installation do this:

1. Update Kaspersky
2. Then rightklick at the Kaspersky icon down at the clock and take ""Settings"" then at the left
meny take ""Options"". At the top, disable ""Self-Defense"" (uncheck it)
3. Rightklick again at the Kaspersky icon at the clock and take ""Exit""
4. Click ""Start"" and ""Run"" then type ""regedit""
5. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> SOFTWARE -> KasperskyLab -> protected -> AVP9 and then click
at ""environment""
6. To the right you will scroll down and double click at ""ProductStatus"" and change from ""Release"" to ""Beta""
7. Close the Registationeditor and then start Kaspersky again! 
A window will shows up and there you will click ""Activate beta key"" or something then next the hole time
8. DONE!!!

Every 30 days you will need to activate again at the window who shows up!

This worked for me :)"
