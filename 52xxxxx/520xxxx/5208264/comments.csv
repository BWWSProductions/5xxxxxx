Converted & burnt with ""ConvertX to DVD 4""
Visuals 7.5/10, Sound 9/10, Sync is good.
Thanks to;

,Rod321,2010-01-24T01:21Z,"I have had the movie playing on the 50inch TV for grandkids &  need to change my previous comment; The Visuals are 9/10 & Sound 9.5/10 & Sync is good.
So for a 400MB download it is exceptional I reckon.
Thanks again MKVGuy"
