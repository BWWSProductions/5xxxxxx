Thanks A Lot kriss_kringle.
You Are Genius.
And Good To See All Great Supportive Comments.
Keep Up Great Works.

And Another Thing,
Recently There Was A Lot Darkness Issue On Secretmyth Releases. 
I Don't Know Why.
I Have Seen Your Releases.
They Do Not Have Such Problem At All.
In Fact They Are Great.
So When Modifying Your Settings Please Keep This Thing In Mind.

Thanks Again."
,JAGUAR7,2009-12-10T19:11Z,"
And Another Thing. 
It's Just An Opinion.

As Far As I Know, All The Sources YouAnd Others Like Secretmyth, 3Li Use Have DTS Or AC3 Audio At Much Higher Bitrate That Is Far Far Better Than AAC LC / AAC HE.

But Very Unfortunately .mp4 Does Not Support AC3/DTS.
But .mkv Does.
Again Comes The Pain. 
PS3 Does Not Support .mkv.

So All The PS3, X-Box, Apple TV, WDHD TV Owners, You All Have A PC And A HDTV For Sure. [If You Do Not Have HDTV Then It Is Even Better.]
So Why Don't You Spend A Few Bucks And Transform Your PC Into A HTPC By Adding A Avg. Video Card And Sound Card?
Then Connect With HDTV, Home Theatre Without Any Issue?

As A Matter Of Fact, HTPC Is Much Much Better Solution Than Changing Standalone Players Time To Time For Compatibility. 

And Thus One Day kriss_kringle Can Release .mkv Format With [AC3 Audio].

Guys Just Try AC3 Instead Of AAC Once.
You Will Hear The Huge Difference At Higher Volume Specially On Action Sequences.

FINALLY WE ONLY GET WHAT WE DEMAND.

SO DEMAND FOR HIGHER QUALITY.  "
[V],Team_xRG,2009-12-11T07:39Z,"no hitman quality wise its completely opposite 
maybe ur right about compression but when i play movie in my pc ac3 and dts are far more louder but kmplayer solves the problem even have high sound with aac when using kmplayer
ps im sabby2013 
my id is gone lol  "
,JAGUAR7,2009-12-11T07:43Z,"
hitman02021980,

AAC Is Newer With Better Cmpression.
The Main Aim Of AAC Was To Give Very Highly Compressed HQ Audio @ Lower Bitrate.

But How Can You Compare AAC LC @ CBR 320Kb With AC3 @ CBR 640Kb?
It Will Take Just About 150MB Extra.
But Put Them On Your HT System, Feel The Differance.

building HTPC is huge pain in the a**?
Well, Take A PainKiller And Then Build A PC.
Your Normal PC Can Be Upgraded Too.

All These Secretmyth, Gopo, 3Li Rips Will Work Fine On A Simple P4 + GPU.
If You Have Core2Duo, Without Video Cards It Can Play 1080p Rips Too.
But For Sure HTPC Is Not Like These.

And huge pain in the a** Is Then When You Spend A Lot On Your HDTV And HD Home Theatre System To Experience HD And Then You Get Nothing Like HD!

Audio Compression Is Much More Complicated Than Video. But Who Cares!
Most Of Us Always Have Video Complains.

As Making Things Simpler, 
As I Think, Playing Movie On PC Without Any Hassle Is Much Much Easier Then Transfering, Burning, Them For Players.

And As A Matter Of Fact If We Want All Things Such Simple Way Like Playing DVD On A Player For Analog TV, 
Nobody Will Be Here Today.

Thanks."
,JAGUAR7,2009-12-11T07:48Z,"BY THE WAY, 

ONE GREAT SOLUTION CAN BE .m2ts FORMAT.

WHAT ABOUT THAT?

And Sorry For All My Huge Posts."
,T-Fish,2009-12-11T11:57Z,"jaguar.. how can you compare 320kbps AAC with 640kbps AC3 ?  

*slap forehead* :P

ps: quality and VOLUME have nothing to do with each other."
,JAGUAR7,2009-12-11T16:17Z,"T-Fish,
More Quality You Have i.e. More Bitrate,
You Can Use Much More Volume With Much Clarity,
When Lower Bitrates Will Generate Distortion At Higher Volume.
But The Main Thing Is What You Have For Audio Output.
If You Have A Normal Headphone, Then Forget All These. 
But If You Have HQ HT System, Just Try Films Like GI Joe, Transformers 2 Etc With Both AAC And AC3 Source. 
You Will Get QUALITY And VOLUME Issue. 

Thanks."
,T-Fish,2009-12-11T18:35Z,"id say thats subjective, but you still can't compare
AAC with AC3 if you give the former only half the bitrate.
384kbps AAC will sound about equal to 384kbps AC3.
otherwise id have to say that AC3 with 640kbps sucks compared to DTS with 1536kpbs :P"
,D3v0,2009-12-11T21:27Z,"2.82 GB is too small for 720p, and the film grain texture suffers because of it.
If it's not 4.37Gb or 8GB, its a waste of our time so please just don't bother posting this shit. "
,T-Fish,2009-12-11T22:50Z,"i dont have a console, so i can't help you there.
i use a htpc -> 1080p samsung tv and a file server ;)

D3v0..  way to show your IQ matches your age.
quality is subjective you tard."
,Ltewsjr1,2010-05-07T02:23Z,"I just downloaded the sample and it looks very good..  The sound is also good.. So, if the movie quality is as good as the sample I'll give it a 9/9.."
[T],Vitamin_X,2010-06-22T04:26Z,"Thanks a million kriss_kringle
An awesome rip this is.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120863/

And what a great movie. But some of you typical products of the 21st century might find it boring."
,a8607,2010-07-17T12:49Z,quality is good.
