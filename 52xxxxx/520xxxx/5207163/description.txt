Alphonse Mucha
	The [Nearly] Complete Graphic Works

>> This guy was basically drawing "hawt anime chicks" over 100 years ago.

	Ripped via conventional DSLR photographs for free, non-commercial distribution. 
        
        >>>Honestly, this is just for people interested in this style of art, but don't want to search and then spend $50 on a book they'll look at like 5 times and put away forever.


        "Alphonse Maria Mucha (24 July 1860 â€“ 14 July 1939) was a Czech Art Nouveau painter and decorative artist, most well known for his images of women. He produced many paintings, illustrations, advertisements and designs."

        So, anyway, I've been somewhat of an Alphonse Mucha fan, a kind of person who enjoys high-brow, painted, pin-up girl material, but have been frustrating lacking in material. Other than finding some low-rez copies from Google Image search, a hand-full of high-rez copies on Flickr, and a handful of random, very underwhelming torrents, I decided to personally take it into my own hands. So I went on eBay, sniped an auction and got a book of 140+ pieces of Mucha's work in full detail and color for $45.

	My main intention for getting this out-of-print and somewhat uncommon book was to essentially rip it. Much like ripping CDs or Movies, I wanted to rip a book full of facinating art. But alas, as truly proper book ripping requires an expensive scanner, (which I did not have), and often the physical destruction of the book by cutting the pages out (which I did not want), I decided on my own technique.
 
	I may not have a professional-quality 600dpi scanner, but I do have a 10.0 Megapixel DSLR camera, a knowledge of taking balanced and accurate photos, and an above-average understanding of Photoshop. So, in the light of the sun above us, I took meticulous and still photos of each page as best as I could on the floor of my garage using free hand. Taking 2-6 photos of each piece of art. I went to my computer and did my best to straighten out each image, crop it just right, and use curve editing to get the color and contrast just right (in my eyes, on my screen). With some blemish-covering in for extra perfection, I call it a success.

[[[ For more detail, look in the Liner Notes I included with this torrent]]]


Features:
140 .jpgs containing over 150 pieces of individual art, complete with full details, titles, indexing, and credits for each (in the detailed Liner Notes). 

Images are around 2 mb in size or more (having uncompressed, 5-8 mb images didn't help quality and just made things huge). 

Images are around 2500x3200 pixels in size (larger-than-wallpaper size!)

Want an example? I recommend that you just download this torrent and start with image "Page27_v1", it's one of the highlights.

Leave comments on this page, I'll read and respond happily.

Also, why fixed? Because I'm new to creating torrents and I fucked up the trackers. Apparently my understanding of trackers as a whole only extended to how private trackers worked. And going off some really old how-to thread messed me up when I only put in some defunct PirateBay tracker. So, now more educated (in as fast as 15 minutes of Googling will get me), I'm sure / I hope I fixed up my mistakes from before.
