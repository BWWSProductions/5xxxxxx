@spotopneedslovin  wiibackupmanager worked fine, you must be a n00b"
,altrego99,2012-01-06T21:31Z,Thankee. What is a scrubbed file and how do you shrink the games??
,thedtjs,2012-04-14T10:53Z,@altrego99 Wii game discs have a 'junk' area to make a disc a certain size. Not all games take up the whole disc so the junk. A scrubbed game is just the game without the junk area so this is a shrinked Wii game.
,thedtjs,2012-04-14T10:54Z,^ typo!
