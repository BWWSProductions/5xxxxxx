These are the FLAC files I got straight from the Porcupine Tree online store, I figure everyone has a right to good quality music, so here they are. The cover art is included (Printable Cover Art, according to their site), but there's no .log file, since I didn't rip these, I got 'em from the band. Enjoy anyhow.

Please, enjoy, and seed.
