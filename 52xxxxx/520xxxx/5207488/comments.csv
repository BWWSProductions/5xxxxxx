,nicehs,2009-12-13T22:22Z,"appearently its being seeded from a brazilian dsl connection. until a few other ppl have it its gonna continue to be slow as noone is at 100% yet.. on my 3rd day of downloading now, about 20-30% more every day. but its this or nothing (or the other crappy versions) for now, so thanks alot anyways:)"
,badguyuk,2009-12-14T03:25Z,LMFAO@comments above :)im nearly there taken 4 days but hopefully ill be able to post back let you all know if it was worth the wait :)
,krag23,2009-12-14T12:22Z,"After 4 days downloading, I got it!

THIS IS THE BEST VERSION OF 2012 BY FAR!

1) Best video quality. The brightness and colors look exactly like what I've seen on the theater.
2) Best audio quality so far.
3) Perfect video / audio sync.
4) Real NTSC with 2h38m of video.
5) No hardcoded subs
6) There is one selectable sub (portuguese) but you can disable it if you don't want it.

V:9
A:8
M:8

OBS: There are no english subs, but if you have the subs in english, its very easy to add them to the DVD. Just google how to add subs to DVD."
,nicehs,2009-12-14T13:24Z,"krag23 if u got it already it would be nice if you would help seed as its been taking about an hour per % =S still only 1 seeder, but anyways whole swarm seems to be at 99.5% atm so almost done!"
,badguyuk,2009-12-14T14:35Z,OVER THE MOON GREAT QUALITY BIG TIME RECOMMEND thanks man long time to download but folks well worth it in the end by far the best quality out 10/10
,nicehs,2009-12-14T14:35Z,"ok all done now! quality and sound seems decent.. not bad:)

but.... I think Ill have to pass on this, will wait for another release. main reason is because it seems to be alot of dialog in other languages but english.. like french, chinese, spanish .... and with only portuguese subtitles its impossible for someone who dont know chinese OR portuguese to get all whats happening... :| 

didnt watch more than first 20 min or so, didnt wanna watch too much, but seemed alot of that was in other languages with only translation being portuguese.. or any other easy way to add custom subtitles to this? guess most subtitles released would be out of sync if this is longer than the others too tho? hm:\

guess this is great for the portuguese speaking people out there though.."
,badguyuk,2009-12-14T14:36Z,p.s no worries im seeding
,gonzo1990,2009-12-14T15:09Z,"Best video and sound quality. 10/10.
Its very easy to add the english subtitles to this DVD-R without encoding anything. I did it on my copy already.

Anyway, for you people that have no idea how to do it, I am sure someone will rip this version into 700MB or 1.4GB xvid / x264 with english subtitles either hardcoded or on .srt text files.

Thanks a lot for this release, its the best one BY FAR."
,mauro19,2009-12-14T15:13Z,10/10
,nicehs,2009-12-14T15:13Z,gonzo1990 can u pls tell me where you got your subtitles from? Ive tried 5+ now and neither matched.. all seems far out of sync. or could I have done something wrong while adding it (did it in the middle of the movie)  ?
