The R5 version of 2012 has a very dark picture and is speeded up (PAL).

This version is a re-encode of the leaked R5 DVD9 version, with color correction (now picture is clear and not dark), and conversion to NTSC.

All other versions of 2012 so far, have the dark picture issue and the PAL speed up issue. If you have this movie in PAL (25fps), this means you are watching the movie speeded up. You can check that on the total movie runtime. This one is 158 min, the correct runtime.

Audio is untouched from the leaked R5 DVD9 version (Line).

Also, there are no hardcoded subtitles on this one.
