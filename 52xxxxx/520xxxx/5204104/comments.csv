,boris72,2011-03-17T11:11Z,"RARing doesn't really belong in torrents. The torrent community is all about sharing and caring, and we still have to care for those in the world who don't have enough internet speed or download quota (I know many here in regional Australia who are limited to 12gb or less per month), and RARing doesn't enable them to slowly download an episode every day or so (and slowly seed them as well). RARing means they have to wait weeks to watch even one episode.

Besides this all these are brilliant ups, aspect ratio changes sometimes from widescreen to not but that's not really a problem, great video and great sound. Thanks for this brilliant show!"
