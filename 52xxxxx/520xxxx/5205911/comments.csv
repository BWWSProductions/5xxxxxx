,F1r3Gh0st,2009-12-09T16:28Z,If this works for levels other than Prestige 1 please let me know!
,F1r3Gh0st,2009-12-09T16:30Z,Small File... Please Seed...
,Stlouiscowboys,2009-12-09T18:54Z,"Suprisingly this actually works, but it doesn't just add exp to your current level.  You input the total exp you wish to have and then you get whatever level that amount would give you.  The base value sets you at level 30.  2.2 mil gives you level 67, ect ect.  

Thanks for this!  "
,Stlouiscowboys,2009-12-09T20:13Z,"If you want to go through all the prestige levels, you need to just put 2516000 in the tool.  Thats enough to get to you level 70 max and then you have to accept the prestige, then do it again.  "
,F1r3Gh0st,2009-12-09T21:26Z,Thanks StLouis! I wasn't sure if it used the same addy for all of them!
,Stlouiscowboys,2009-12-10T00:37Z,"No sir, thank you!  I really found the fact that if you wanted to advance through the prestige levels you had to give up all your weapon unlocks, ect pretty retarded.  This saved me a ton of time.  I went from base level 65 to prestige 2 level 65.  "
,F1r3Gh0st,2009-12-10T15:04Z,As this tool seems to be more popular than I hoped. I will be working on a version that takes you to the last prestige with all pro lvl perks and attachments unlocked. No promise on when it will drop however.
,tweak1,2009-12-20T04:13Z,i could not get it to work. followed the instructions. hope for a response!
,F1r3Gh0st,2009-12-30T01:06Z,"Was Patched, will have new by tomorrow.... Please check tomorrow night"
,F1r3Gh0st,2010-01-03T00:45Z,Ok so I can get it to work on CE but that's it still working on it...
