Vrioon is a 2002 collaboration between Ryuichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto. Characterized by an unusual experimental sound (a sound which Sakamoto and Noto will experiment also in Insen in 2005), it weaves an electronic minimalism spreading a very little amount of notes during the songs. The album was elected among the first 50 albums of 2003 by magazine The Wire[1]. Also named album of the year in 2004 by The Wire magazine.
