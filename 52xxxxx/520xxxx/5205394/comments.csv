,franglais,2009-12-11T15:55Z,"I would think a Carte de Resident (Green Card) would be more practical for those wanting to commit this kind of ""re-identification."" 
With a Carte Identitie, you're saying your a French National. 

With the Carte de Resident, also good for 10 years, you're entitled to work, live, collect all the benefits of a French person, but as most likely your French isn't that great, it's more plausible that you'd have that card, thus you could stay under the radar more easily. "
,Jedichiphazard,2009-12-16T03:43Z,"I agree with franglais,

A green card ( Carte de Resident ) would be a better option for those of us who struggle speaking French."
