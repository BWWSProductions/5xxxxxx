,Xindii90,2010-07-24T07:06Z,Thank you.  Running Server 2008 means that this is my best option.  It works so well that I might even pay for it when I get another job.

,bojancar,2011-08-31T12:53Z,"At first I thought It is fake because it's only 1MB, but it really works, you can simply copy crack to installation folder (what I did), or you can run crack.bat to auto crack.
Thanks trevorcatt"

I've been searching high and low for a DLNA compatible program that could load pictures fast enough. Twonky Media has a buffer service that lets you buffer in advance, reducing the load time.

Thank you so much!"
