Kang Jae-kyung (Hyun Bin) is your typical rich kid. Heâ€™s arrogant, drives sporty cars, attends the big clubs and rides through school corridors on his motorcycle. As his 18th birthday approaches heâ€™s set to inherit his grandfatherâ€™s fortune, but first Jae-kyung is required to transfer to a new school in Gangwondo and graduate. Until then all access to his penthouse, cottage and credit cards is denied. Should he fail to graduate or drop out then he loses everything. With little choice he heads out to the countryside and a small town in which daily life is far removed from what heâ€™s used to.

Shortly after settling into his new home he meets 18 year-old Choi Eun-whan (Lee Yeon-hee), who just happened to run into him back in Seoul. They donâ€™t exactly hit it off; heâ€™s far too stubborn and cool for school, while she sees hope for him and sets out to make him see it for himself. As they eventually draw closer, thanks to a set of coincidences and school projects they learn more about one another, but soon a shattering revelation will change these people forever.
