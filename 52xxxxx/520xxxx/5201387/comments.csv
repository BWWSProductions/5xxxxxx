Once it freezes, you have to advance it manually for each remaining chapters or else it will keep replaying the same chapter. I,m using DVD+R DL."
,grrahul,2009-12-25T11:51Z,"simon2005, I have burned it on a dvd+r dl. Firstly, I had to fix the file using FixVTS since nero notified me of some problems...that the first vob file was not referenced. Can you tell me the exact point (the time) at which it freezes? I can check it out myself by forwarding to that point -10 secs or so and see if I have the same problem and let you know."
