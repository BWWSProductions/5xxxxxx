,chuisle,2009-12-11T16:49Z,Ive just found you were doing these.  Is it possible to get the prior releases?  I cant seem to find any seeded.
,pianoman13,2009-12-21T02:30Z,"could you seed some of the earlier releases, especially 4-10ish? they used to have a fair amount of seeds but it seems they've all gone missing. :D i appreciate all of your torrents!! so helpful."
