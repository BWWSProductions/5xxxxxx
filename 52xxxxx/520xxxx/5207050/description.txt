synopsis:

A first year high school student Boeun is forced to marry, a close member of her family but who is not blood related. Her husband to be sangmin is an older college student who is on the verge of graduating. Secretly in love with his new bride, a constant teasing, brings humour to this excellent romantic comedy. However everything isn't fine and dandy, as Boeun is not sure, whether she likes her husband or high school boyfriend . But everything seems to change when her husband comes to work at her high school! A throughly enjoyable romatic comedy, one of the best ive ever seen! sweet and funny, far from original.
