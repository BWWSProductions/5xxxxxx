Savage is such a funny talk show host.  I love how he cuts off callers after one or two words.  Even if they're calling to agree with him!

He also has a really funny way of faking humility while at the same time pointing out how great he is (PhD in Epidemiology and Nutrition, writting x number of books, etc).  

But the best thing about his show is the comedy of blaming greedy corporations for taking advantage of the working man while at the same time advocating a completely unregulated market.  Does he really think corporations will be more fair if they can make a profit anyway they like?  It's preposterous and hilarious."
