It is a great OEM copy that is working flawlessly on several machines on my WLAN. Updates just fine and requires no hacks or patches or keygens."
,PERCY0819,2009-12-11T06:07Z,"What do I need to do now to download this file?
Let me knwo . Thank you"
,Axia10,2009-12-11T14:45Z,"Personally I like to use a torrent client for downloading. I use Utorrent for all of my torrent work. It can be found directly from their site at http://www.utorrent.com/downloads

Worth mentioning, a lot of the files found in torrent downloads are compressed using WinRar. 

WinRar is a file compression utility that will unpack (extract) your new torrent download.

Also worth mentioning: Once a file is at 100% completely downloaded, it is always great to upload at least as much as you download. That practice is called sharing. You can see your share ratio in Utorrent and use that as a gauge.

Sharing (seeding) is how the peer to peer (P2P) community continues to survive.

Not sharing deems you a leech and WILL get you banned in some private torrent sites. 

Good practice...Always share :-)"
,Axia10,2009-12-11T14:50Z,"Sorry, I guess I could have linked you to a good torrent for WinRar: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5103412/WinRAR.3.90.Pro.%2832_64Bit%29_-TauseeF

This has been around awhile and is the one I downloaded. There are both the 32 and 64 bit versions in this torrent."
,almcrp,2009-12-15T09:18Z,i really want this stuff so badly thanks for seeding
,Axia10,2009-12-15T10:43Z,"Glad I could help :-)

I'm still seeding the torrent as well. 

It looks like their are a few more seeds each day. 

I usually turn my bandwidth all the way up while I sleep, and back a bit during the business hours.

As long as the trooent remains healthy I will continue this practice."
,darthnbs,2009-12-16T08:23Z,I'm still seeding this one okay so no need to worry about incomplete downloads. One good version no serial number no activation. YO!
,Axia10,2009-12-16T10:54Z,"darthnbs

I appreciate the help. I am still seeding as well. 

Thanks for the Props! I have had absolutely zero problems with this OEM copy. It updates well and auto activates as it should.

The best part of Windows 7 is the way that it manages both memory and hard disk management tasks. 

The core kernel for all Windows 7 products is based on the Vista Core.

It is my understanding (from what I have read in the developer forums) that Windows 7 was they intended Vista to be.

Windows 7 is by far improved!"
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-16T19:16Z,"what the hell is this? is it kinda given OEM when it is installed without loader/activator.is this auto activate on custom built PC? is this 64bit or 32bit or both?

@Axia10
i bet you can be a good mate to talk about everything!"
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-16T19:24Z,"oh i have clicked on the file number from above and it previewed showing its detail that it was 32bit ISO 

(Microsoft Windows 7 ~ Ultimate OEM x32.iso	2.23 GiB)"
,Axia10,2009-12-21T01:31Z,"From what it sounds like, you simply need an ""Activator"" to get Windows 7 to work. 

If you are booted up and running, but not ""activated"" you may want to try this:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5153536/Windows_7_and_Vista_Activator_-_32bit___64bit_-_Ultimate__etc...

Of course I have NOT used this activator since my Torrent is my install and i did not need it. However from everything that was said on the page, it seems to work quite well.

If all else fails, download my torrent ""here"" and reinstall. :-)"

,ui92111,2009-12-21T03:12Z,"I'm hoping to use this file for bootcamp with my mac. I've dled the file, and burned it to a dvd using mac disk utility. However, when I try to install windows using the bootcamp assistant, it does not recognize the disk as an installer. Does anyone have any suggestions? 

Thanks"
,mckayjosh,2009-12-21T04:35Z,"Thanks Axia10. This OEM is awesome.  Check for viruses using http://www.virustotal.com/.  Not one virus found. Clean install & Upgrade was a very smooth operation.

Once again, thanks a mil."
,Axia10,2009-12-21T10:46Z,"mckayjosh

Thanks for the props. Glad I could help. 

I am currently on week 8-9 on this install with zero failures across my WLAN."
,Axia10,2009-12-21T10:54Z,"ui92111

Unfortunately my friend, I am not familiar with Mac bootcamp assistant. 

I can tell you this file is packed as an ISO file that may need unpacked prior to burning. 

The file is definitely not bootable as a burned DVD. 

Try unpacking the file in MAC (not sure of the utility for this) and then burning all of the files to DVD. Run the ""setup"" from the contents of the unpacked ISO.

Sorry, wish I knew more about the MAC. 

Maybe someone on the boards at SupraBay has some insight into this :-)"
,technopad,2009-12-22T14:18Z,Hey thanks Axia 10. I havent installed it yet. I have seeded it.

,SpartanAK47,2009-12-26T17:28Z,Which would be more preferable? installing this using .iso imaging program (eg. daemon tool) or burning onto a DVD?

,technopad,2010-01-03T09:50Z,"Downloaded and installed. Clean Copy windows7.iso and pre-activated. Thank you Axia 10. Was able to download Updates and that's it.

,drew501,2010-01-07T02:05Z,"Hello Axia, can this be used for bootcamp? trying to get windows 7 or xp for games on my mac book"
,Axia10,2010-01-08T02:12Z,"drew501

I really wish I could say yes....However, I don't  know for sure. 

I was just looking at BootCamp and it says that it can boot Windows, but I have no experience with Mac and I would hate to advise you that it would work with no knowledge of the product.

There may be some forums that could help you?"
,m_tefa7,2010-01-10T23:09Z,is it boot able ?

I don't think it is boot-able, I installed it over Vista.....unfortunately it cannot install over XP. Different kernel altogether. Vista and 7 share very similar kernels."
,Neokfriendz,2010-07-28T23:47Z,its a custom iso which is not working MS Win 7 USB/DVD tool..
