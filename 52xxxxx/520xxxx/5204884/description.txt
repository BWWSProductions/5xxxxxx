   Finally, high-quality map production software that works. MAPublisher
   cartography software seamlessly integrates over 40 GIS tools into the
   Adobe Illustrator environment to help you create maps the way you want,
   how you want. Import the most widely used GIS data formats, including
   those from ESRI, MapInfo, MicroStation, AutoCAD, Google and the U.S.
   Government. All GIS data attributes and geographic parameters are
   maintained, are fully accessible and editable. Cartography is now faster,
   easier and better than it has ever been. When used together with
   Geographic Imager for Adobe Photoshop, they form the perfect vector/raster
   mapping package for the Adobe Creative Suite.

   Also available in MAPublisher 8.2 is MAPublisher LabelPro. It offers
   advanced labelling capabilities beyond those available in MAPublisher
   Feature Text Label.

   New for MAPublisher 8.2, the MAPublisher Spatial Database add-on connects
   to and imports ESRI Personal, File and ArcSDE geodatabases.
