Glenn Beck Program for December 7th 2009


Two things...


1. I know that there is someone onwho posts Glenn's tv show every day...but is anyone able to like...download the parts and add them in a torrent or something? I can do it...I just am being lazy about it.

If anyone wants to do that, that would be awesome.


2.  As you will hear in today's broadcast, you are polluting the earth. All the CO2 that you are breathing out is polluting the planet. (Don't mind the fact that our plant life relies on CO2 to produce the oxygen that we breathe.)

I think that this is just the politically correct way to say "your breath stinks".
