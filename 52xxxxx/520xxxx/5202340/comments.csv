""there is someone on y-o-u-t-u-b-e who posts Glenn's tv show"""
,syboat,2009-12-08T03:57Z,i would do it dono how 
,YoFoos,2009-12-08T05:11Z,"Not sure if I follow what you mean by ""download the parts""

I have uploaded a couple whole shows via ""mini-nova"". But Netviper and JoeSmuck were the main contributers."
,malagent,2009-12-08T06:12Z,"There was a steady posting of the TV show on mini nova, however, they don't do that anymore.

My situation does not allow me to see the show (or any other broadcast TV) otherwise I would post it."

,joeshmuck,2009-12-08T18:43Z,"I still upload the show daily.
I'm currently posting them at kickasstorrents(dot)com and torrentzap(dot)com
Please go check these sites out. They are not MiniNova...but they are close."

Actually, it is the eugenesists saying ""There are too many of you 'human animals', we need to thin the herd.""
And if they get control of health care, you can bet they will try thinning the herd."
