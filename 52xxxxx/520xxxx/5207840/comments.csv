,maxigawa,2009-12-11T18:23Z,infact who sells the controllers on their own?
,soundsett,2009-12-12T20:15Z,as far as i know you can use the wii fit boards too. and gamestop and such sell the boards.
,Fuck__You,2009-12-13T04:59Z,"i was also told you can use a wii fit. but this game is the worst tony hawk game yet. controls are horrible. when using the board the game comes with, everything is delayed about 1.5 seconds. many other game play problems.

game gets 1/10"

,drewkrew,2011-09-28T13:12Z,"HMV (United Kingdom) are selling the newer Tony Hawk ""SHRED"" board with the Tony Hawk Shred [PAL] game for £19.99 this week (28-09-2011), instead of £49.99, which is great fun. 
I had to buy one at that price..."
,segascream,2011-10-10T18:24Z,"How do I download the board for this game?  (kidding...surprised nobody's asked this yet)

Both Ride and Shred use the same board, which comes with a USB receiver.  So, no, Balance Board won't work.

But for anyone in the US, Big Lots is selling Shred for $20, with 50% off an additional game (Wii or DS title) when buying Shred.  My son just got Shred and Namco Museum Remix for less than $30, and I'm now downloading the only other title to make use of that board peripheral."
