                    April.                                   
                    April has a face that people stare at and a  
                    private life that is kept so locked up no one  
                    can see inside. Will discovers it's April's  
                    birthday and sets about cooking up a surprise  
                    for her, while the mystery of her life is  
                    unpicked. April works in a laboratory with her  
                    best friend Kevin, who insists on involving her  
                    in a game where they try a new experience every  
                    week. Will these new challenges backfire? One  
                    thing's for sure, April's unexpected birthday  
                    party will be a surprise in more ways than one.  
                    Elsewhere, Carrie and Dan's turbulent romance  
                    hits new and unforeseen rocks. The final  
                    episode follows tomorrow.
