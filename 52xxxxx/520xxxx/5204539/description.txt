"Alex welcomes back to the show Lord Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, British politician, business consultant, policy adviser, writer, columnist, inventor and adviser to Margaret Thatcher's policy unit in the 1980s. Monckton is a vociferous critic of the climate scam gang. He reports from the summit.

Alex also talks with special guest Jesse Ventura, former Minnesota governor, retired professional wrestler and color commentator, Navy UDT veteran, actor, and former radio and television talk show host. The first episode of Jesse's new television show, Conspiracy Theory, delivered 1.6 million viewers and was the biggest audience ever for a new series launched on truTV.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
