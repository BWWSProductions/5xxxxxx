[T],tifon,2009-12-08T16:47Z,Besides missing the good stuff ...
[V],bubanee,2009-12-08T19:44Z,how did i find it back? not sure what you mean.. how did i get this is that what your saying?????
,mufckingud7,2009-12-08T23:29Z,Cheers for this when will the Top 40 be available and what other sites do you use as Mininova was the place i had rss feeds to your uploads
[V],bubanee,2009-12-09T00:47Z,the top 40 comes from here under uploader oldsckoolscouse... if you can't find it.. just go to top 100 music and find a top 40 and click on oldskoolscouse... as for me the first place i ever upload a torrent has always been here! and will be until one of us retire! first.... there are other places but what i usually tell people is... just google bubanee. cheers!
[V],bubanee,2009-12-09T00:50Z,"oops... oldskoolscouse.. spelt that wrong!

[V],bubanee,2009-12-09T03:25Z,"everybody asks me the same question everywhere i go. on different torrents on different sites.. as i say to everyone..

i just do.. enjoy the ride!"
,mufckingud7,2009-12-09T21:17Z,"Cheers for the information mate, i will keep that bookmarked"
,w4eed,2009-12-10T10:49Z,TY Bubanee you're doing a great job i love your torrents.
,lovetheherb,2009-12-11T05:46Z,Cheers man by any chance have u got the new vampire weekend album yet not out til next month 
[V],bubanee,2009-12-11T07:28Z,"no.... contra! vampire weekend
i was curious and had a look and all that came up is the 4th to the 8th january.... sorry"
,WhYSoOoSerious,2009-12-12T13:57Z,"Thnx So Much man 4 ur great effort but i have a minor request and i hope that u can do it 

Could u plz upload with Standard Quality ( 320 Kbps ) ? cuz it is so much better and u sometimes upload it , but the majority is 196"
[V],bubanee,2009-12-12T22:10Z,lately a lot of my torrent uploads have been VBRV0 and some VBRV2 and have used EAC or DBpoweramp... I am not changing a thing at all.. and plus due to these torrents that are VBRV0 are well respected away from public sites.. and this may upset you a little more as from next year there will be no VBRV0 for public it will be all VBRV2 as for i am saving the VBRV0 and --FLAC-- for elsewhere.. i was going to remove 'bubanee' full stop.. but that's a better solution i think..
,Dolessus,2009-12-16T01:35Z,"I haven't listened to the entire album yet, but it seems to be very nice. It has all of the songs in the album, and the ones that I heard were very nice quality.
Thank you, bubanee, for this album.
I will be seeding."
[V],bubanee,2009-12-16T05:07Z,^^ Cheers Buddy
,idontcare007,2009-12-16T06:06Z,Thanks BUBANEE! :D
,TowerMac,2009-12-17T04:44Z,320 kbps is the best and i can't fathom why people don't provide that
[V],bubanee,2009-12-18T19:30Z,"@ TowerMac the average bitrate for these songs is 243kbps.. any CD rip over 200 in VBR is Excellent!
i guess the CBR and VBR war is alive and well.. and surely i'm not the only one who ripped alicia on this planet.. this is why i wish skir..... was still around myself at least VBR and CBR would be both covered.... myself i go what is recomended by my peers and people I look up too.... and not 1 uses CBR not 1... and remember unless you have hearing of a dog and myself i can't tell the difference between the 2 really... same as V2 and V0 still can't tell the difference... sounds good in my car and computer.. maybe i should make a VBR and CBR.. and how pointless that would be!

,Nate8727,2009-12-28T15:24Z,You need to put what the quality is for your uploads.  It's annoying having to download it and find out afterwards that it's lousy.

[V],jainmehul,2010-02-11T12:58Z,"people the debut is always on that which better VBR OR CBR but believe me vbr is better bcoz it uses different frame rate throughout the song giving a better result

that is why bubanee provides vbr not cbr

,SamuraiSaga,2011-10-22T20:35Z,This torrent sucks! You can hear static throughout. This is not a CD rip at all! Probably an audio computer recording.
