But how can I put all the 76 .rar files together and play the movie as a one .mkv file normally?
Please answer, thanks."

,puunjab,2010-09-25T06:22Z,"If you believe you need to put highly compressed video into RAR files that can't compress them anymore, you have proven yourself too fucking stupid to know how to encode HD video.

RAR's are all the objective proof I need that the uploader  is lucky if he wipes his ass properly on any given day."
