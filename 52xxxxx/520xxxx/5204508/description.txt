Well, I spent over 2 years trying to find an active torrent for this without success, kept putting off the arduous task of ripping my vinyl, eventually found out it had finally been re-released at some point, gave up & bought the CD.
I suffered so you don't have to - here it is.

The Very Things are pretty left-field & therefore hard to pigeonhole. Probably best described as Alternative, Experimental or Avante Garde. Their music has a Gothic feel and contains elements of Rockabilly/Psychobilly. Apparently they were obsessed with 50's B-Movies and it shows.
'When Father Papered the Parlour' is a cover of an old Music Hall song. This, and 'The Gong Man' were played quite a lot in British Alternative Clubs in the mid to late 80's. I used to dance to it although, listening to it now, I can't think how - I was probably drunk.

.mp3 files, 128 kbps
All files accurately tagged with Artist, Album Title, Year, Track Number, Genre, Title & Source(in 'comments')

I don't have my computer on 24hrs so downloading may be a little on/off until there are others to seed but I try to have my computer switched on for at least a few hours each day so please persevere - thanks.

I do keep an eye on my torrents, so if it's not working properly, please do leave a comment and I will try to fix it.
