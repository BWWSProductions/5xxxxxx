,salkstar123,2009-12-11T12:17Z,okay how the hell do I get these arcade files to play on my 360? With games I obviously extract them to Iso and put them on a dual layer disc.My 360 is modded with the latest firmware.I've extracted th file with win rar and It just looks like a blank file.Do I try burning it to a Dl disc?Please if your going to upload this shit at least give some instruction on how to use.I've tried putting the file onto a usb drive but my xbox dashboard doesn't give an option to play it.It can only be found under music videos and pictures and not the games section of the dashboard.pls pls pls help me I'm frustrated to bitzzzzzz AAARRRRGGGHHH

,anthony073,2009-12-11T15:59Z,is there a other way without opening your xbox or something?

,samljer,2009-12-27T03:02Z,"If using a firmware it will still work.
but you STILL must burn this the same as any ISO.

DVD+DL with DVD-ROM enabled
even at 204mb it will still write 8.5gb (the DVD-ROM) filling it wil 0's ""Like a pressed DVD""

at no time is a single layer disk acceptable."
,mawarm,2010-01-09T00:37Z,"Can you just burn the game to a dvd+dl like normal, or do you have to like do something special to your xbox for these kinda games...?

Can't remember which firmware I have, just know that wave 2 games work on it. :P"
,mawarm,2010-01-09T00:39Z,And btw....there is no .iso-file : /

,Chris_Kadaver,2010-03-15T21:54Z,"this crap sucks. for some reason the game appears for half a second in the game library and then dissapear. I have burned other arcade games before and put them in Content/0000000000000000 but for these titles: bionic commando rearmed and 'splosion man, it doesn't seem to work?!
really annoying"
,apwhitelaw,2011-01-02T20:12Z,Cool so how do you burn this? Do i just burn the file that's in the folder? Cause there's no ISO.
,massivetempah,2011-08-19T18:06Z,"and people wonder why games are so expensive!! have some respect for the devs guys, buy the game!! or watch the industry die :("
