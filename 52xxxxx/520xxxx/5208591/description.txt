"Alex welcomes in-studio G. Edward Griffin, film producer, political lecturer, and author of numerous books, including the indispensable classic, The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve. Griffin is the founder of Freedom Force International, a libertarian activist network. Mr. Griffin appears in Alex Jones' Fall of the Republic and the late Aaron Russo's America: Freedom to Fascism.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
