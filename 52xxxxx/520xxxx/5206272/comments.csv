,trevorcatt,2009-12-10T21:07Z,"I have been seeding this since I put it on here. I'm uploading a few things and downloading as well so it might be a bit slow. use the magnet link, it might be quicker that way. 

I'm new to this so any tips on how to make things quicker for people who are downloading would be helpful."
