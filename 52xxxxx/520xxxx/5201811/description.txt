There are at least five Oscar Petersons on display on this comprehensive 10 CD
Box Set representing Oscars work with the legendary Norman Granz and
celebrating his 80th birthday on August 15th 2005.......the virtuoso soloist, the
leader of a rapidly evolving piano trio, the master accompanist, the indefatigable
anchor of the Jazz At The Philharmonic rhythm section, and the devoted chronicler
of the American popular song.

CD's 1-5 of AVID's re-mastered set focuses on Oscar's rather neglected work
interpreting the Great American Songbook where he and Granz "tried to draw more
people into jazz", including works by Kern, Arlen, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin,
Gershwin amongst many others.

CD 6 features Oscars first session with Granz as he accompanies the legendary
Billie Holiday across 16 sides that show his talent as an accompanist.
CD's 7-8 capture Oscars collaboration with four leading tenor sax men: Lester
Young, Ben Webster, Stan Getz getting fired up with Dizzy Gillespie, and a rare
session with the unique Flip Phillips.

CD's 9-10 features the entire 1954 issue from the Jazz At The Philharmonic,
including Oscar playing alongside such names as Lester Young, Bill Harris and
Ray Brown.

Complete with a fine essay by Dr Richard Palmer AVID's latest release is a
testament to a great pianist whose courage, dedication and sheer will shine
through in his playing and to a great partnership with his friend, mentor and patron
Norman Granz.
