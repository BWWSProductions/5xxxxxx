,digigeek,2009-12-16T02:23Z,"Thank you very much, it worked for me.
The maps and POI data are valid and I was able to use them to update a Magellan Maestro 3225.
But it is not an automatic update. What you have to do is connect the GPS device to your computer with a USB cable and then copy files from the download and replace them in the MAP file on the GPS device one by one."
,FlippyJeez,2009-12-16T04:47Z,"Worked on my Maestro 4250. Thank you!!

I first tried it using an SD card. It was very slow and it didn't update any of the maps. I also noticed it couldn't or it was very slow to acquire satellite signal. I was about to make a comment when I read digigeek's comment and tried it. Worked perfectly! Don't know why I didn't think of doing that before, LOL. 

My base map is now v 35; my detailed map is now v 37; my AAA data version is now 7.0; So far, so good. If I find any problems, I'll come back and update. Cheers!"
,skwerlabusr,2009-12-17T06:07Z,There is a new update for the AAA Tourbook. The new version is 8.0 and I will be uploading the file. It's just an exe file that has step by step setup and guides you through connecting the USB and everything.
,digigeek,2009-12-18T18:20Z,"Thank you for everything skwerlabusr.
However, I must say that as a member of the SPCA, I do not approve of your handle :)"
,ryry101,2009-12-29T04:52Z,Cant get the gps past the magellan boot screen after I copied the files over. I have the magellan roadmate 1470 . Any ideas ??
,Jasonofcompsci,2010-01-11T00:58Z,"It did not do anything for me on the Magellan Maestro 3200.  I'm fairly confident in my tech skills so I would say 50% chance its me and 50% change it just doesn't work on that model.

Although thanks for the reminder to update the firmware.  That is a very good enhancement."
,dude100,2010-01-16T12:57Z,I have a 3225 i did the replace file method and it geezzed out my unit (realy slow) put back old file and it was fast again  i will try the update method next and let you know.
,dude100,2010-01-16T13:46Z,"i tried the sd card way and the unit dosen't use the new map, can You post the sd cards ""disk lable"" mabe that is were the problem is, it may need to see the correct lable to use it. also mabe you could try to use ultra iso and create a disk image for us to try. thanks ..."
,srecinos,2010-02-07T01:57Z,"It works just fine, and it even gets you mexico maps!!!! Thanks"
,srecinos,2010-02-07T02:00Z,"I have Maestro 4250! What you have to do is connect the GPS device to your computer with a USB cable and then copy files from the download and replace them in the MAP file on the GPS device one by one.

,jsup,2010-02-07T17:59Z,does this update work for maestro 4220???
,iirybackii,2010-02-19T18:43Z,"RoadMate doesn't have enough memory for US48.imi and US48.poi

I used the copy and paste method as opposed to the SD method.

I'm assuming since the 1470 does not have enough memory that you have to leave all the US48 info on the SD micro disk and the RoadMate will still be able to read it if you just leave the disk in it?"
,medicweber,2010-03-01T05:47Z,"Not to sound silly, but how do you download this?  I get a 22KB file when I try to download it.  I must be missing a step somewhere?"
,skwerlabusr,2010-03-09T04:26Z,Digigeek: haha that is a long story how I got that name. But don't worry it's not literal or perverted in any way!
,skwerlabusr,2010-03-09T04:27Z,Medicweber: You have to use a torrent program such as uTorrent to open that file you downloaded. Then you have to wait for the actual maps to download... But we all do wish it were that small and quick!
,crash8,2010-03-17T15:47Z,"Does anyone have or know of an update for the Maestro 4050?  It's not on this list, but I hoped beyond hope that it would work anyway, but... well... it didn't... heheh.  After installing the new files, it shows the correct map version number on my GPS settings, but it's kinda screwy.  POIs show street numbers, but no street names and when I try enter a street address, it says the street is not in my database even though I just selected it from a list of streets that included the same street it's saying isn't in the database.  Maybe I'm just doing something wrong?  Can't imagine what it could be, though."
,ackupo,2010-03-22T03:18Z,"Works with RoadMate 1430.  Just overwritten my previous files and tested it.  Toronto, ON, Canada here =).  Just remember to update your firmware before putting this in.  Thanks for upload!"

,gofreemovies,2010-06-06T05:02Z,Has anyone gotten this to work for their RoadMate 1200? I'm having trouble updating mine and now my GPS unit doesn't seem to be working at all. :(
,faheyd,2010-06-08T00:34Z,"@gofreemovies  read the instructions again.
Did you do a back up as per the instructions?
See 4.&5."
,sw33ts,2010-06-09T18:13Z,"I tried to copy these files to an SD card, but when I put the card in my Roadmate 1212 with the latest firmware, it still shows basemap v33.  According to magellangps.com's site, the version should be 37.

Does anyone here who has purchased the SD card from magellan know what the directory/file structure of the official card looks like when you view it from a PC?"
,krazykipa,2010-07-05T06:17Z,"For those of you that can't get this to work: make SURE you are running the latest firmware version for your model. You can find this software at the Magellan site: http://www.magellangps.com/support/magellan_software_download.asp

Then use whichever method (I used copy to flash memory on my Magellan RoadMate 1412 NA) to install the new map files.

As far as I can tell, the SOUNDS and SPEECH folders are extraneous and unnecessary, as they are identical to the ones already on my GPS.

Happy seeding!"

,goglinpl,2011-09-20T16:48Z,"I've Googled high & low, but haven't found this *specific* issue addressed/resolved concerning the MAESTRO 3100:
Has anyone experienced street address range anomalies or 'address not found in database' issues after applying the map updates?  The base map appears to work great, but I get weird behavior with specific addresses.  For example, street address number ranges come up as 100-199 for a LOT of streets - streets I know for a fact that have a lot larger range of addresses.
Was there perhaps another mod to any of the OS config files necessary?"
,Hyperian,2011-09-22T07:54Z,I put these maps in the map folder and it just stays in the loading screen. How do i get it go to the main screen and go to the map?
