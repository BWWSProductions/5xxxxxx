Long lost reggae here at last! Compilation of the sessions Miller recorded with the great Augustus Pablo in the mid 70s.

I tried for about 2 months to get this from a dead torrent of about 6 Jacob Miller albums before looking (for a long time), elsewhere. Enjoy this album and keep seeding - music for everyone!

Recorded in Kingston, Jamaica in 1974-75.
