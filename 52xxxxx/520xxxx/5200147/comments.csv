,BoyoBoss,2010-04-02T20:27Z,"@ Goodman07 ...

Yes, this is the 20th anniversary politically correct version. Just checked this download and the feds are using walkie-talkies, not shotguns. :(

Still, thanks bob5695 for the up.

Cheers!"

,Mathlol,2011-08-29T16:22Z,"Thank for the upload.  This is the stupid 2002 digital remake .  
Please do not list 1982 as the year.  ET is 70%+ CGI and looks terrible."

,JosieQ,2011-09-04T05:45Z,"@GoodMan07:

You are a fucking idiot who should be shot in the face if you think replacing shotguns with walkie-talkies and a CGI E.T. is okay.  Shot in the fucking face."
,PSP12052,2011-09-08T17:28Z,"I second that motion. there is a saying that there is nothing new under the sun......to prove its true, the last 12 movies released were remakes of old classics and they sucked. 

i miss the good old days when you actualy had to have talent to make a movie or sing. now its all autotuned & computerized junk. 

so much for quality of life, but thanks for the torrent, you have made my professors kids real happy lol."
[V],bob5695,2011-09-10T16:08Z,you're welcome.

,aroy924,2012-03-23T22:44Z,"@josieq don't be a moron and keep your stupid comments to yourself. Do you go around telling people that they should be shot in the face when you see them on the street?no, I don't think so or, you're a bigger moron than you've led us to believe.

@psp12052  30 years ago, people were saying that all the movies and music was just recycled from the 50's and 60's. 100 years ago, they were saying that all the books were just old stories rewritten. Open your eyes dumbass! The stories are the same but are just adapted for the times. Otherwise, we'd never have anything to watch. I'll bet you read the same stories to your kids someday that you heard as a kid..."
,jduplaa,2012-07-08T22:40Z,going to love this movie
