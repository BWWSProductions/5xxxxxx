                    Andrea Levy's award-winning story of Jamaicans  
                    and Londoners involved in the Second World War.  
                    London 1948: Hortense joins Gilbert, her new  
                    husband, in England where he is lodging with  
                    Queenie Bligh. The women have both married in  
                    unpromising circumstances. As Hortense   
                    remembers her life in Jamaica and the love she  
                    had for Michael and his betrayal of her,  
                    Queenie also remembers her night of passion  
                    with the same Michael when her husband was away  
                    at war. Will they uncover the secret they share?
