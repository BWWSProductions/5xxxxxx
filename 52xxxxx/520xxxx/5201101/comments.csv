There is a patch, but since it's not cracked, it won't work."
,rebelr,2010-02-04T19:05Z,"hi! i run windows xp black. when i run at.exe it gives me that ""wiindows has encountered an error"" job... any suggestions? please help?"
,Shitpoop,2010-02-13T20:14Z,"@jackieboy8: Unless you speak German or play on a Mac, you won't see Airline Tycoon Deluxe. It was only released on PC in Germany, and only released in the US on Linux, Mac and ZETA.

Not only that, there are only 5000 copies of the German version. It's an extremely rare game."
