[V],GoodFilms,2009-12-08T22:45Z,A DVDRip should never be in the HIGHRES section...

Hi do you upload torrents on any other sits cuz you know Pirate Bay is in trouble for some time now, and you never know what will happen to it, so i was wondering where else i could get your torrents, cuz i really like your work, its exquisite!!!  And keep it coming :)

PLEASE REPLY!"
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-09T16:50Z,I asked Secretmyth for his settings profile and he said he couldn't give it to me because he worked too much at it.
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-09T16:51Z,But he also said that if I wanted to join the Secretmyth group I will get everything that's needed to make the rip like clockwork.
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-09T16:51Z,The thing that I'm not to comfortable about is if I join the Secretmyth group I think they'll just give me a list of movies to rip and I want to make my own selections and rip movies that just aren't in brrip quality out there.I asked him for more information on that matter and after that I'll see what I will do.
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-09T16:52Z,The next movie that I'll upload will be The thin red line and hopefully it will work on WD TV and consoles although I won't guarantee it 100% .If you could test it I would greatly appreciate it.
[V],Team_xRG,2009-12-09T18:09Z,"hey kriss this is my frnds id mine is not working 
im sabby2013
i think u should carry on the good work i can give u example of 3li he started like u now he is very popular and through experiments his quality is becoming better every day 
so keep trying 
and yes secretmyth also kept trying there was little fps problem due to which they did'nt work on ps3 it was till march 
so he is right from his point of view

e.x.t.r.a.t.o.r.r.e.n.t.c.o.m ? "
[V],Team_xRG,2009-12-09T18:17Z,"1 more advice 
do some new movies as well 
would help u to gain some fans :) 
thnx for everything gogp "
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-09T19:19Z,Well the thing is I make these rips for personal use and I thought I should also upload them so other people could see these movies in a higher quality since no one bothered to make them.Initially I wanted to make them only for PC use but then I thought they should be compatible for other devices as well.I might buy one in the future and my movies won't work on it.I'll keep on trying and see what's what.
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-09T19:21Z,Also thanks for the support.I wasn't expecting a lot of people to give a F..K :))
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-09T19:39Z,Let's not hate on the man.He's the best at what he does and I hope I can improve so that my movies could be almost like his. :))
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-09T20:43Z,Well I'm a big movie buff so I try to make movies that are worth it and not just everything that comes out straight to dvd. :))
,VivaAmmar,2009-12-09T21:17Z,Hey Kriss i asked you where else can i get your torrents? 
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-09T22:33Z,On heet I uploaded a few of them.
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-10T19:27Z,I'll give it a try and ask for his advice.I'll also upload on a.h.a.s.h.a.r.e. as well.Thanks for the advice FuGGers.
,Andy2572,2010-03-03T12:17Z,"Thanks loads, but how do i get the English subtitles to come up? hope thats not a stupid question "
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-07-02T09:39Z,"Audio Track: German only

,Ganfer,2010-07-05T02:53Z,"Kriss any idea on how i can get this under 4gb without ruining the quality ,im going to have to change it from MKV anyway to watch on my PS3,Thank for the upload "
