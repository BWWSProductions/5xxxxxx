Anatoly Lyadov (1855-1914) : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyadov

I do not normally upload modern (c19/20) works, but I've made an exception for these as this music is exceptionally lyrical, being inspired by older folk material.  It is not dissimilar in style to much of Stravinsky, but is a good deal less heavy.
