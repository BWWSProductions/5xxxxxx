Satyricon - Roadkill Extravaganza [2001 Ð³., Black Metal, DVDRip]
Year: 2001


Of the third-tier black metal bands, Satyricon are definitely among the most interesting, even if they are notorious for taking tacky photos. Roadkill Extravaganza covers the European tour undertaken in order to promote Satyricon's fourth album, similarly titled Rebel Extravaganza. Along the way, we see and hear interesting anecdotes about the trials and tribulations of taking a truly alternative band to see the world. It is amazing to remember while this footage plays that while RIAA-endorsed music has been slumping in sales for the best part of twenty years, the MP3 and Internet revolutions have seen the record sales of bands like Satyricon increase by thousands of percent. Something their record label at the time, Moonfog Productions, seems hellbent on conveniently forgetting. So whenever I get a chance to recommend something that a label like Moonfog tries to supplant RIAA product with, I grab it with both hands. However, in the case of Roadkill Extravaganza, especially on DVD, I cannot do this in good faith.
Out of ten, I have to give this documentary a three. Aside from one funny reference to Sadistik Exekution during the end credits, Roadkill Extravaganza has very little to recommend it. If you are a heavy fan of Satyricon, then it is worth a look, although the video transfer on the DVD will make your eyes water at times. Those new to black metal or Satyricon are advised to look elsewhere.
