He is best known for developing an entirely original style that incorporates the elements and timbres of Lithuanian folk music. Skirmantas Sasnauskas has been active on Lithuanian jazz scene since 1986. He has performed with nearly all of the most distinguished Lithuanian jazz musicians. Quite a few of the now famous Lithuanian jazz performers have been nurtured in his groups. With diverse stylistic experience in the past, Skirmantas Sasnauskas is now turning towards simplicity and melodic beauty. Voice often becomes his prime instrument, especially due to its instrumental treatment.

An enthusiast of authentic Lithuanian folk music, playing fiddle and other instruments in his own folk groups, he is equally active in other genres bordering on folk music, such as country and world music. Besides, he is well-known as an author of compositions of jazz and pop, as well as academic music; and the special flavour of old Lithuanian folk songs (particularly their unique polyphonic variety sutartinÄ—s) is often present in his diverse work.
