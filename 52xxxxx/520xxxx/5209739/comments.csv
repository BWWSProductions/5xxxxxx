I have never met an atheist that hasn't brought up the topic at some point. I DON'T CARE IF AN ATHEIST DOESN""T BELIEVE IN A CREATOR GOD. If they are that stupid(In My Honest Logic Based Opinion) they need not spread it, yet they always seem compelled to do so. They MUST kill God in the minds of everyone they talk to. There is real anger with them. Real spitefulness when they have no reason or cause to feel spite. Unless they hate God..the very concept. 

Well....if you hate God and religion and don't believe..thinking you will be in the blackness of nothingness when you die(totally illogical), then just SHUT THE HELL UP. No one of faith wants to hear your inane idiocies. You can no more prove God DOESN'T exist than a man of faith can prove he DOES exist(barring a miracle of some type). Atheists don't have miracles. They have the sad fact in thinking they will totally end at death. To me that is a fate worse than Hell. It is also impossible really.

There is infinite space...mankind understands by my guessing about .001% of the Universe and what in reality(very ordered reality) is existence. 

It is only through the human emotionally arrogant mind that one could POSSIBLY completely rule out the existence of a creator being. He may not even be the God of the Israelites...from our history he is, but the bible is vague. EITHER WAY...the universe is far far too ordered to be anything, but a CREATION. Being a creation there would have to be an intelligence behind it. Otherwise the rules of the Universe would be random...gravity..matter..etc.
Chaos would reign in such a Universe without the controls and rules set in place by.....who? The God. The Creator. There is chaos without design. There is no design without intelligence. 

The spiral equation...is in many many things in nature even done to the genetic code of all living creatures. LIFE is too ordered to be anything, but creation. Evolution does NOT overrule the possibility of design and God. For would he not create us this way and guide our path to be the most intelligent creatures on this planet that could voice praise to him if he so chose. What God is..is completely beyond human comprehension. Something without a beginning is beyond our minds. That is why so many question their faith and there are angry atheists trying to enforce their dreadful thoughts and nightmares upon totally happy people of faith(that do not need to have it questioned by the likes of another foolish human who has NO idea the basis and founding of this reality). 

I also submit that you just simply CANNOT...CANNOT get nothing from something. Every single thing be it even a thought is something. The laws of this universe dictate that such things as thoughts ...a mind(not a brain) will transform into something. This is the law. There is no way around this law. Not even with black holes(according to theory) anymore.

So, I hope this will shed some light on things for some of you before you start thinking like an atheist. Why even bother living if you believe you are purposeless and an empty shell when you die? Many would think this if they lost faith..many do now no doubt. For this ""gift"" of the atheist they get depression..anxiety, and a dreadful fear of dying. For many there is nothing worse than being nothing. 

Trust me though. When you die. You will be SOMETHING...and I don't mean worm food or dirt. Your thoughts will transform in SOME way...the energy in your body will do the same.

It's only logical.

Look up the facts. Read your history(from more than one (biased) source). Don't trust my word alone. Look up the laws of physics while your at it. Then look up Quantum Physics. 

We are NOT an accident..sorry. I count people that say we are as total arrogant minded fools. Small little humans with small little minds on a speck floating in infinity and an atheist knows it ALL"

,joeinbham,2009-12-12T11:52Z,"Don't take me seriously.  I was just teasing the previous comment, not to diminish your crack up. "
,Dequlynn,2009-12-12T14:58Z,"I was right. It was funny as hell (or the idea of hell). It almost seemed like a spoof of a Richard Dawkins documentary, but with a really ugly guy who looked like he was going to die any second (and was a moron)."
,Pastafarian101,2010-05-19T00:50Z,"I've always found the idea of eternal torment for simply not believing or following a particular religion to be rather crass, petty, is this the kind of god that you would want to worship? When people believe that a being like this is good, its no wonder that atheists attack the abrahamic god.

But for me, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is ""the alpha and omega"", and you know what, he is well worthy of worship! He's loving, kind and merciful, and no matter if you're atheist, jew, agnostic, invisible pink unicorn follower, as long as you're good to all and stop being an ass you'll be fine :)"

,satakas,2011-09-06T19:22Z,"""But for me, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is ""the alpha and omega""""

dont play with your luck. in certain reasons i have to believe, that at least 1 well known religions might have started of the same sort of mockery as FSM. think about it - for some generations it will be clear, that FSM is just mockery but as some of it's ""followers"" really carry on fake rituals of worshiping him, it may turn into a real religion at some point and then you cant regret your own stupidness, looking down at the earth from clouds, drinking beer with real god.

:-D"
,jonnysolar,2012-01-31T16:56Z,"Aw you Christians crack me up with this - you say about atheism being so dogmatic and forward, but religion has been like a dog with a bone for centuries. And the simple fact that you came on here and spouted the long winded diatribe only goes to prove exactly that - Christianity is one of the most vociferous and combative religions going when in the wrong hands for trying to force its views upon all others. As you just did :)

Pastafarian, can I join you with the FSM then? The pink elephant in my mind has convinced me it's the path!"
