Content for trainz,   this is just for my friend.

Not sure if these will work with all versions,  some of the content is buggy...  

Mainly CN / CP stuff, with north american rolling stock and a few of my unfinished custom routes.

When done, unzip into your 'local' directory in the Trainz program files.  then go into content manager, and let it re-check the database.
