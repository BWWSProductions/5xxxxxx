,z3v3ns,2011-03-13T14:45Z,"You sir, are fucking amazing! I bought all of this a while back but lost it all when my Windows pc caught a virus and I had to wipe it and install Linux. Sure there weren't many seeders and some days it didn't download anything, but I was able to download the whole thing in about 3-4 days. Thank you so much! I'll seed this as long as I can, for anyone else. 

Best music upload to this site (period). xD"

I accidentally deleted the torrent before I could seed, and for some reason, I need to download again just to seed it. Oh well, a small sacrifice from me for such an awesome torrent, thanks so much!!"
