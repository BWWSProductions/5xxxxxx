[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-12-07T18:08Z,plus all the new games are uploaded by too many uploaders so i waste my bandwidth on the hard to find games
,data662,2009-12-08T14:19Z,is it patched?
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-12-08T14:39Z,yes fully patched
,data662,2009-12-09T16:24Z,This game is decent. I used to play the demo a lot. It would be cool if there was a sequel and to be able to build on planets.
,data662,2009-12-09T16:37Z,I wonder if there are any mods for this.
,payback2x,2010-01-07T19:16Z,"hey, great! for thoses who want to ameliorate graphics there is an experimental patch made (unoficially)  by a original developper, it add nice realtime realistics shadows :)

,Darktangent10,2010-03-04T06:11Z,"I'm having a problem with the graphics, it looks like everything is slanted to the right and distorted."
,Darktangent10,2010-03-04T06:16Z,"Nevermind, figured it didn't like multiple displays, and I was right."
,Genema1,2010-11-08T06:14Z,Thank you dude!
