David Leavitt's critically acclaimed novel about a troubled family's crisis with homosexuality is 
powerfully adapted for the screen in this drama. Phillip, a young gay man, falls in love and begins to 
feel the need to tell his parents about his true sexual self. The twist is that Philip's father is also 
gay/bisexual but keeps his yearning closeted from his wife and family. The parallel stories of these 
two men and the emotionally distraught wife and mother caught in-between results in an undeniably 
painful melodrama that is exceptionally sensitive to the issues of homosexuality, bisexuality, coming 
out and familial miscommunication
