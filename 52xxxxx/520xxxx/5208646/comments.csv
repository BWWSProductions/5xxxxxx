,Cancain,2009-12-11T11:21Z,"This is real, and i apologize for leaving. But i am having some problems with my connection."
,Lekarn90,2009-12-11T14:19Z,"Awesome, i knew they would make another after Blue Harvest :D
And its for real, no fake.

Thanks, mate!"
,GasPain,2009-12-11T15:46Z,"B-RaDiCaL, your comments are ample proof of what a clueless fuck you really are.

Lekarn90, you just knew this would be coming?  Wow a true prophet you are.  Oh, and the fast it was announced almost 2 years ago had nothing to do with you prophecy I bet.  Now did the Trailer on the Blue Harvest dvd...

Thanks for the up."
,GasPain,2009-12-11T15:53Z,"Almost forgot about 2cents...  Have you ever though of thinking before sticking both feet in your mouth?  Go play in traffic and leave the oxygen for for those with some semblance of a brain.

Um, B-RaDiCaL Episode 10 was Big Man on Hippocampus ""U DUMB FUCK ."""
,jvbambam,2009-12-11T19:19Z,"were is the rest of the episodes  from E9 and up,
i don't  fine none of them  thats fuck up
from e9  and up  and now  is e20 what the fuck is this "
,Cancain,2009-12-11T19:55Z,"jvbambam: This particular episode has been leaked long before it would have been aired, the other episodes in between haven't been realeased yet."
,hentooth,2009-12-11T21:28Z,"TOTALLY not a Fake dunno wtf happened to eps 11-18 but this is SOOOOOO funny.

A10
V10

Can somebody fill in the gap?

But download it, it's great quality and VERY funny... But I have ONE BIG CRITICISM

WTF RAR FILES F?CK OFF, I thought we'd done with poxy RAR file in torrents.

I'm gonna start a capaign to ban bloody RAR files, Anyone want to join?"
,patrick3876,2009-12-12T06:54Z,"Technically this is to be S08E21 according to epguides.com/familyguy ... and for those wondering what happened to the episodes in between, here's how this is working:

Something Something Something Dark Side is being released on DVD on December 22 2009.

Something Somethign Something Dark Side is being aired on FOX on May 16 2010.

So relax, you didn't miss anything, the episodes in between will start airing after the holidays. This particular episode is just making it to DVD before it airs on TV.

And since the DVD release date isn't till Dec 22, looks like someone got their hands on a copy early :) Thank you!"
,aztonet,2009-12-12T11:13Z,NOT A FAKE!! Just download the damn thing
[T],killerdemon,2009-12-12T13:40Z,"This is fake or incorrect, because there is no S08E20 yet, were even still waiting for S08E09"
,loopmastalarsen,2009-12-12T15:16Z,"yeh i believe this is being aired on tv and classed as a special rather than an actual episode, just like blue harvest, thats why its labeled as ep20 because it wont be in the regular run of eps on the season 8 dvd but a separate ep for extra dvd sales coz there gonna milk it for all its worth being liked by both family guy fans and star wars fans"
,hentooth,2009-12-12T15:21Z,"@patrick3876  Cheers for that, I was wondering, so I can wonder no more LOL.

Why are people still shouting fake, have you downloaded and watched it... I think not or you'd see how dumb you are being"
,upsilon7,2009-12-12T16:56Z,"guys, just grab this. this is real one.
kind of bonus episode i think
don't be talky like a girl"
,dk82,2009-12-12T19:44Z,thanx :) been waiting for this :) 
,jesuslozano101,2009-12-12T23:41Z,"Downloading @ 2.2MB/s This is really nice, thank you Cancain for the upload."
,anilr,2009-12-13T02:32Z,Its real. Its supposed to be on DVD next two weeks. Good post!
,patrick3876,2009-12-13T05:07Z,"@killerdemon - Read my post before reporting fake/incorrect. You obviously didn't read the whole comment thread before posting. I explained why it's tagged S08E20 (and techincally it's wrong, it's going to be S08E21 anyways according to a Episode Guide website)

This is the real deal, I promise you all you aren't wasting your time, and if you are wondering what I'm talking about, read my comment on comment page 1."
,mtsaska,2009-12-16T18:20Z,"Great Quality!! A10 V10, thanks to uloader!!"
,mtsaska,2009-12-17T02:54Z,"I am not sure if it was this torrent, it could've been something else I did, but shortly after extracting the files I got the windows protect virus."
,noob_only,2010-01-01T01:27Z,"I just finished downloading the rar files. 
I can't extract the .avi because it's looking for something like this:

family.guy.s08e20.dvdrip.xvid-reward.r00

HELP!!!"
,noob_only,2010-01-01T01:36Z,"You know as my name implies... well, you get the idea!

Scratch my previous post, I felt so silly after discovering the missing file was separated from the others. I just finished extracting it and started watching 10 minutes after my previous post.

This is the real deal!!! No viruses!!!

Thanks dude!"
