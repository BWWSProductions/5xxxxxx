Debbie ( played by vivid Girl Cassidey ) and her BFF (best friend forever) Shauna ( played by Pixie Pearl ) are working set of a porn version of the video for Nirvana's iconic song "Smells Like Teen Spirit" â€“ with a ribald substitute for the word "spirit." When they meet up with New kids on the block Bambi ( played by Charlotte Stokely ) and her BFF Tammy ( played by Dana DeArmond ) who are eager to check out the scene.
