,jiveclive,2009-12-08T18:13Z,"To be fair to TvTeam, and fairness is very important, I believe. So, for somepeople, a good rating on IMDB is 7 and up. 7-6 is iffy for those same folks. And below 6 is I like, ""ooowww, my eyes, my eyes, I got shit in it."" 

But there are folks that work in the exact opposite way. So anything 3 and lower is totally the best in show. 3-4 is dangerously close to awful, and anything higher than 4 is just not worth the money or the time or the pop-corn. 

So these two types of people are completely separate camps. You know, some people love peanuts others love caviar. Hell some people even love men's nuts. It's the variety that makes it all so interesting and that, innit? "
