THE ALEX JONES SHOW
2009.12.09 Wednesday

Alex talks with Tim Ball, head of the Natural Resources Stewardship Project and who is on the Scientific Advisory Board of Friends of Science, an organization debunking the myth of human-caused global warming. Ball was featured in Alex's Fall of the Republic and The Great Global Warming Swindle, a documentary film that was first aired in March 2007. The film showcased scientists, economists, politicians, writers, and others who disagree with the scientific consensus on global warming. Alex also talks with Infowars' correspondent on the ground in Copenhagen, Patrick Henningsen. Alex covers the latest developments in Copenhagen, runs down the latest news, and takes your calls
