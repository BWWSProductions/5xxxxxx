Profile of the suave actor who became a pop-culture 
icon when he starred in TV's campy Batman series. 
Includes the story of the commercial that helped West 
land his Batman role, and the typecasting that nearly 
destroyed his career after the series was canceled. 
Viewers will delight to Batman clips, West's screen 
test with Burt ("Robin") Ward, and interviews with 
Bill Maher, Frank ("The Riddler") Gorshin, and Julie 
("Catwoman") Newmar.
