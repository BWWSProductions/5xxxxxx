,ntrushn,2009-12-12T23:19Z,would anyone tell me if the audio/video is good or not
,TheAwesome2012,2009-12-15T16:59Z,I must say that I agree with knockX2 with most of his comments regarding your torrents as most of them are drawing attention to themselves with wrong tagging such as DvDrip R5 when there is no such thing as R5 audio is not of the Dvdrip perfection. On the other hand people should not complain about a free movie unless they have limited bandwidth each month and would honestly feel cheated downloading a movie then finding out half way through the sound gets knocked out of sync for the rest of the movie rendering it unwatchable. All in all thanks for the torrent i'll be sure to view this in the week sometime.
,TheAwesome2012,2009-12-15T17:05Z,"I should add on a bit to my comment above about the R5 audio. If line source is available then you can barely tell the difference between DvD audio and line but most of these releases 
(Like 'The Taking of Pelham 123' comes to mind when groups released it using cam audio while even though the picture was great the cinema crowd could still be heard and the dialogue was fuzzy at times.) Then again you can't complain when it's a free movie :)"
