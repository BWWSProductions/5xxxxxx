  Release Description:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Argon offers entry-level 3D modeling without the commitment of high-end 
   professional packages. It contains the same solid and surface modeling, 
   rendering engine and animation tools found in Cobalt and Xenon, but 
   without the high-end mechanical design and extreme productivity features 
   you may not need. For both Macintosh and Windows, Argon lets you model and 
   render with such a straightforward interface that youll forget youre 
   using a computer. Intended for those getting started with 3D modeling, 
   or as a companion product for other CAD products missing these features, 
   Argon offers great design tools at an affordable price.
