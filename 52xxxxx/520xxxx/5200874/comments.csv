This is the most pathetic film i have ever seen. the Print is good, but the movie is very pathetic."

I've been looking for this film. Thank you for uploading it.

People has their opinions. me personally, I think it's a good film. I like it.

It's worth watching, and it has those brief comedy bits, as said, worth watching, especially if you're interested in this kind of things."
