,muckle12,2009-12-09T16:35Z,"Thank you for this! This will hold me over until I can get my hands on the dvd. ;)

I wonder if this is just an extended theatrical cut? Or is this the DC he's been talking about? Might be the same thing but you never know with Zombie, he shoots heavy and makes several cuts. I'd love to see the workprint.  "

,kbowk2,2009-12-12T04:14Z,"Downloaded first half CD1 to c what its like. Now grabbing CD2.  Great quality Worth the download.  Don't know why ppl give these movies stink.  It's watchable and compared to other releases is one of the best horror films atm.  Way better than the new Jason crap.  

By the way, why download from this trusted source go to www.dodgyshit.com and try and get all the latest movies in top quality for free.  There's nothing there just some crap we want you to sign up for with the promise of free movies.  However, once you pay us you get a virus for your reward and a hyperlink to another hyperlink which finally gets you to some other companies website that we also own.  Give it a go andersglw may personally try and steal your bank details if you act fast."
