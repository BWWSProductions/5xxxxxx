Home Plan Pro is designed to quickly and easily draw high quality floor plans, site plans, and architectural designs. Home Plan Pro provides a full array of graphic tool buttons to let you easily pick a tool or action. Once you choose a tool, Home Plan Pro tells you how to use it. You may use the mouse or keyboard, or both, to create your plan. Home Plan Pro gives you many choices for printing your plans. You may select a specific scale, or elect to have your plan printed at the largest size that will fit on the paper you select. While there are a number of impressive and powerful CAD programs available, they are more difficult to learn and use than Home Plan Pro. To preserve its intuitive ease of use and low cost, Home Plan Pro is not designed to compete with full-fledged CAD programs.
