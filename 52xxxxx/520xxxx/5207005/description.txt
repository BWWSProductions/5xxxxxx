                BestCrypt software will create and                   
                will support encrypted virtual disks.                
                                                                     
                These disks are visible as regular                   
                disks with correspondent drive                       
                letters. The data stored on a                        
                BestCrypt disk is stored in the

                A container is a file, so it is                      
                possible to backup a container, move                 
                or copy it to other disk (CD- ROM or                 
                network, for instance) and continue

                Any free drive letter in the system

                encrypted file-container for access.                 
                When the virtual disk is opened, you                 
                can read and write data as if it were                
                a conventional removable disk.                       
                                                                     
                How does BestCrypt work? BestCrypt                   
                creates a pre-encrypted file called                  
                a container. This container is                       
                created by an encryption algorithm                   
                (Twofish,

                In addition, BestCrypt creates a                     
                logical disk. The container is linked                
                to a logical disk, and the disk is                   
                opened for access using the unique                   
                container password. All data stored                  
                in the logical disk are stored in the                
                container in an encrypted form and
