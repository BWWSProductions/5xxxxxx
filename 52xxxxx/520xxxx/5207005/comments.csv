Is there a reason to split the exe to 4 seperate rars, then embedding THEM to 4 zips?

TvTeam, if you don't want me to complain about the packaging, why is part of it missing?
If it's NOT missing, why does winrar want the 4th file?  If you were to look, exa2043d.zip contains NOTHING but an ID file and the nfo file.
If ANYBODY else has gotten the complete file from this torrent, you should leave a comment."

windows 7 x64.
My box would crash randomly and as soon as I would try to load utorrent it would immediatley crash every time.
My BSOD error was Iobuildpartialmdl was called with a virtual address range outside the range of the source mdl.
Some sort of memory progamming bug.
Took me two days before I figured it out."
