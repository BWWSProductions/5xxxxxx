Two kids, a million in cash... What could possibly go wrong?

There's something magical residing in the West Edmonton shopping mall in this fantastic family Christmas comedy starring Patrick Swayze (Dirty Dancing, Ghost), Tim Curry (Ben 10: Alien Force, Home Alone 2) and Carmen Electra (Scary Movie, Starsky & Hutch).

Having just moved to Edmonton from Los Angeles on Christmas Eve, the Saunders family have no friends, no money and, with the exception of the bright-eyed Mary, no Christmas spirit.

But things start looking a bit more like Christmas when 12-year old Brian and 6-year old Mary find a satchel of money at the local mall and they launch a Yuletide shopping spree... That is, until the crooks who counterfeited the money chase them through the mall packed with holiday shoppers.

Packed with seasonal cheer, great villains and laugh-out-loud adventures, Christmas in Wonderland is a fun Christmas treat for all the family.
