,Strikefear13,2009-12-07T07:52Z,"I don't know why but for tv show torrentz, I've been getting ""tracker offline"" in uTorrent for the last couple weeks.  It's not until I add trackers from another site that it starts going.."
,Strikefear13,2009-12-07T07:59Z,Scratch that.  I only seem to be having this issue with eztv torrents :-\
,outpatient730,2009-12-07T08:20Z,You're the best! Love you!! Fuck Yeah!!
,istrain,2009-12-07T08:27Z,"Same thing happened to last weeks episode.

Add these trackers and it should pick up speed.

""Problem connecting to tracker (http://eztv.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce): Timeout while contacting server.""
How do I add other trackers?"
,mmmbeard,2009-12-07T10:49Z,"Thanks EZTV - again!

kbowk2, try reading the post a few above yours relating to adding trackers. Everyone else seems to have managed it without being a dick.
"
,Krakajak32,2009-12-07T11:11Z,"G day all from aussie land,One question where do you put the udp one?

,evilbass26,2009-12-07T11:21Z,"Currently 7 people seeding out of 5978.
That's pathetic.
I also think your torrents are all slow, and the trackers added do fuck all.
Can someone fix this shit?"
,GTA_VC_IS_BEST,2009-12-07T11:41Z,"Thanks The Final moment is the best when trinity says 'hello...Dexter Morgan"""

,DickDickstein,2009-12-07T14:20Z,"OH and this may be a little personal, but you provide a nice service and if I would let anyone do me in the bum it would be you guys."
,kudos2jen,2009-12-07T14:29Z,"Thanks eztv.  I've probably downloaded hundreds of your torrents and they're always perfect.  

i'm trying to compensate for all the whiners on this torrent.  It's amazing how obnoxious people are behind a computer screen. "
,DezurtQT,2009-12-07T15:23Z,"Thanks SO very much!!!! This show is just the best......its a bummer the seasons almost over, it goes so quickly. "
,possum23,2009-12-07T15:32Z,Cheers
,ACSKYDOS,2009-12-07T15:43Z,"thanks dude!
great job!"
,andycadaver,2009-12-07T18:42Z,"I keep getting errors with this and the most recent episodes. The torrent gets a red icon in BitTorrent and has errors in it when I watch it, forcing me to skip erroneous margins. It also will not upload to a USB drive in that state, so I'm forced to also watch it on my computer rather than plug it into my Xbox 360 and watch it on my TV. Lame."
,mortaux,2009-12-07T19:22Z,"youre the best man!
thnks!"
,koka3,2009-12-07T19:31Z,Thanks

,feather22,2009-12-07T22:46Z,hey windowface1... you SUCK!  don't EVER talk to EZTV like that!  EZTV is a hero of mine.  You are some idiot who doesn't know how to use the internets.
,Remcovantilburg750,2009-12-07T23:01Z,"Thanks a Lot for teh up.

,s3xt0y,2009-12-07T23:33Z,wtf seed this or something.

,DickDickstein,2009-12-07T23:54Z,damn...u people must be fucking stupid. Took me only about 10 minutes to d/l this torrent and I seeded up to 2:1. 
,teikyo30,2009-12-08T04:29Z,"I don't get why people are confused. Unless I missed the memo, programs like uTorrent are working exactly the same as before. You click the link, uTorrent starts downloading the file. I would suggest anyone having issues check out Suprbay for help, though. "
,nightcock,2009-12-08T04:31Z,thank you thank you thank you
,codyhedgehog,2009-12-08T06:36Z,"Hey awesome torrents, but i'm just curious whats with the 550mb files isntead of the 350?I find there is no quality difference."
,YASEENEE,2009-12-08T08:39Z,thank you alot
,ACSKYDOS,2009-12-08T09:21Z,"seeeeddd!!!

,johnstone_tm,2009-12-08T13:34Z,"cheers man, good quality."
,johnstone_tm,2009-12-08T13:35Z,"also, the file is in my uTorrent tray but the red arrow is pointing up... I'm trying to seed if that helps."
,rackhamlerouge,2009-12-08T13:50Z,"Great episode I love this season!!!
Thanks a lot uploader!
Stop complaining people!"
,baconcore,2009-12-08T17:22Z,Thanks mate!
,nemozeen,2009-12-08T18:20Z,"So, what happend to ..click download and that's it! I never had to add trackers and all that shit. I do not know even how. EZTV never had this problem. To bad man, you were one of my favorite uploaders. I don't have the time to go in depth why a torrent is not running. It has to be userfriendly for all the dumbasses like me who just want to click and that's it! So I switch to another uploader.... click...and it runs!! I hope you can change it for the future....."
,hinty,2009-12-08T19:00Z,"Nemozeen, you whiny twat. The person(s) at EZTV provide a FANTASTIC service (thank you thank you thank you). It's speedy, high quality and free. And you bitch that you don't have the TIME to deal with it??? What a little bitch you are. It's like a bank giving away free money and you're bitching that they don't have a teller to sort it into stacks for you. Shut up and disappear."
,ACSKYDOS,2009-12-08T19:44Z,"awesome upload!!
thanks thanks thanks!!!"
,jackswag,2009-12-08T20:41Z,wow!!
,Dinsdale Piranha,2009-12-11T01:08Z,"W00t!!!
Thank you guys again =)"
,.FX4.,2009-12-14T05:58Z,"Where is episode 12?!?!  Come on ez! :D :D

Thanks in advance bro"
,DeanMachine16,2009-12-15T00:20Z,"Hm.
I thought it was just me who has problems with some of the EZTV uploads.
Started a couple months ago with me and it's only when there are the 2 Pirate Bay trackers in the file.
I just keep a list of other trackers that do work in a Windows notepad to paste in for my EZTV downloads and it all works fine.

I've noticed lately though, all the EZ files have been packed with good trackers and I haven't been having those problems as much."
,windowface1,2009-12-22T23:47Z,this is gay. why are u like weeks behind all the other uploaders? screw episode 12 dont bother xsaimex did that just get episode 13 plzzz
