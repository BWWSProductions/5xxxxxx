,3r0-vf,2010-02-15T11:48Z,"you may need to download the setup from http://www.e-sword.net/ and then overwrite the installation with this folder. 

it saves the bother of having to install the add-ons one after the other"

The only reason to have the NIV (New International perVersion) is to compare it to show the blatant corruption within it. 

Anyone who doubts me can go read for me Acts 8:37 and tell me what their NIV / NLT / NWT etc version says about believing on Christ before being baptized.

Are you kidding me? The KJV 1611 sucks as a modern translation. It has the Apocrypha in it, and it's barely readable. The KJV that most people use is more readable, but it's also hard to understand. Nobody speaks the archaic language of the KJV any more. Why are you still holding on to it like it's the original manuscripts?
The Bible was originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Every time the KJV adds verses or changes the original meaning of a verse (like Acts 8:37), it is departing from the Word of God. The KJV is only a translation. Get over it. . . 

Good upload. Keep seeding guys!"
