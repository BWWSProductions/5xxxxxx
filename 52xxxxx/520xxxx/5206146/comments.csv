He is a funny fella, erm, man, erm, beachball, erm human pile of flapjacks, heavy on the butter.  "
,VyseN,2009-12-26T23:09Z,"Could anyone explain to me why it says ""High Quality"" in the title, is almost 700 mb big, and even the uploader says it's bad quality? What the heck happened to the encoding?"
,DEC_42,2009-12-29T13:50Z,"How did you make this AVI? 480i and it really shows... If it's from DVD, then I suppose there isn't much to do about it, but damn, this looks pretty bad."
,spiderr,2010-01-05T03:54Z,"The video quality on this was indeed shit... but really, only need audio to enjoy this."
,DancerBabe,2011-08-22T19:09Z,This is not high quality. It looks like shit.
,bassntwo,2011-10-19T11:54Z,"This rip looks and sounds like shit!!!! Do not waste your time downloading it. If you think this is high quality video in compared to what you previously uploaded, I would really hate to see it.  Also the sound quality is pretty bad too.  What program are you ripping with?  If you really want the best quality rips, buy Magic DVD Ripper at www.magicdvdripper.com.  It is 34.97, but you get great quality and can rip anything!  You can even get a version here by searching for it."

A = 10
V = 9

This is actually pretty good quality! "
