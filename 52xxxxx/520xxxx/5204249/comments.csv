,thesolcity,2009-12-16T04:43Z,can anyone tell me if this works?
,nowlit,2009-12-31T08:32Z,"Yes, it does work.

Plus the person who scored down this should do it with good intentions.
This is what I have in my own PC and the quality is great."
,jinXc,2010-01-07T00:47Z,"I've confirmed (with the first four episodes) that this english subtitle package works: 
http://www.tvsubtitles.net/subtitle-205-2-en.html

Use the srt's marked 'NoTV' and NOT 'Dimension'
And for Ep. 9 and 11 you may have to try different ones I haven't tested those

For other languages (No guarentees):

,Archonin,2011-01-07T00:25Z,"Thx for up, and nabs, stop giving suggestions for players when you have no idea what you're talking about.
Use CCCP, if that fails ( which has never happened to me ) you can try VLC even if it is the scourge of the internet, crap software with horrible performance, but it does work now and then."
,metalvegetax,2011-02-12T02:35Z,cccp sucks vcl Rules so does this torrent. will seed
,nowlit,2011-04-08T05:11Z,"@Archonin: try not to be so arrogant when it looks like you don't know what ut taking about. VLC is a great player, small size and plays everything. So next time, just give advice and that's all."
,ToxicInsanity,2011-04-16T18:49Z,"6 mb/s down, and because of this glorious rate I will seed for a very long time. thank you."

,Archonin,2011-06-15T09:29Z,"@nowlit Problem is that I know exactly what I'm talking about.
VLC also has horrible quality."
,brassman,2011-06-16T02:58Z,"@Archonin: No, you dont know what you are talking about. VLC is the smallest, fastest, and simplest media player out there. And i have NEVER noticed any difference in quality, compared to other players. "
,ace0hearts,2011-06-21T05:04Z,Please seed guys! I will reseed!! Please!
,ace0hearts,2011-06-21T16:17Z,Thanks for the seeding guys. I'm downloading now at 2 mbps. I'm gonna increase my upload.

,Archonin,2011-07-28T20:36Z,"Got an i7, with 16GB RAM.
VLC has horrible quality compared to any other players and codec-systems."
,socialoutcry69,2011-08-27T08:58Z,"Thanks for this I really gotta catch up. Oh and VLC is by far the best player out there just give it up Archonin its video quality is as good as any other out there and plays all codecs. its fast, its free, and its easy to use, ive never had any problems with it or its quality your out numbered, you loose"
,spaceballz2010,2012-06-03T12:04Z,"Say what you will about VLC, it is easily attained and plays 99% of all video.  It is free, and as free it has better qualities than most free players.  For instance a major thing with torrents seems to be audio sync and vlc allows you to slow down or speed up the audio to fit it to audio.  Hardly anything in life is free and so lets enjoy this site and if you dont like vlc you dont have to use it.  However when you want to a watch your torrent and dont want to deal with codec problems and pay money for a fancy player than vlc is where it is at."
