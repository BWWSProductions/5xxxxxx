[T],KnifemakerC,2009-12-10T20:25Z,I seeded to a ratio of 900% before quitting

,sooners,2009-12-29T09:24Z,"There was only 1 episode left in this season. Looks like we won't get any closure in this show either. Oh well, episodes for this show deleted too.

Sucks we have no reliable & consistent capper for any of the Canadian shows. Maybe we'll get lucky and the scene won't ignore the final 3 episodes of The Border.

It's a shame too, because Canada is putting out some quality shows. Just sucks that anyone outside of Canada will never get to see them."
[V],err0001,2009-12-30T16:09Z,"sooners:

I'm confused when you say that there is only 1 episode left and that you won't get closure. 

According to cbc.ca/heartland & tv.com, episodes 10-14 will be aired on consecutive Sundays from Jan 3, 2010 to Jan 31, 2010. And I am planning to capture those episodes.

And I also don't understand what you mean by ""Oh well, episodes for this show deleted too"".

As for ""no reliable & consistent capper for any of the Canadian shows"", that is pretty ungrateful. The attitudes of people like cindy25 are much more likely to induce people to capture and upload shows than people who complain."
[V],err0001,2009-12-30T16:14Z,"I appreciate all of the positive feedback (not just cindy25's). And the feedback that tells me about problems, especially when helpful advice is offered - that is how I found out about AutoGK. 

The reason I mentioned cindy25 specifically is that she has been supportive of my efforts since pretty much the start of my time doing this (largely on m.i.n.i.n.o.v.a)

Without her support and interest, I probably would have packed it in with this quite a while ago."
,sooners,2010-01-01T11:29Z,"Sorry Err0001, I had read that this show was canceled. We wouldn't have got any proper endings. But your post sounds like it was just on hiatus or a break. My apologies.

I've seen some great shows from Canada - The Border, Intelligence, ReGenesis, Durham County, and The Guard. And I wish the scene wouldn't ignore these shows. because you guys are giving some of the American shows a run for the money. I think those shows would do well
on American tv.

Anyways, sorry for the confusion. And thanks for the uploads. I've downloaded and seeded several of yours."

,speklap,2010-09-28T16:26Z,"Our daughter LOVES this series and thanks to you we are able to view all episodes in the series. We can catch up before we begin watching Season 4 which has just started airting on Canadian TV. You have given much of yourself and your time in uploading movies for others to enjoy. Thank you, err0001,  from Karen in Canada."
,Norm103,2011-09-27T02:23Z,I have looked everywhere for Episodes 6 and 7 for Season 3 of Heartland. Does any one know where I can find these two episodes?  There are the only ones I have missing and no one seems to know where to download them.  Your help would be greatly appreciated.
