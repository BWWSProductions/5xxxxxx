    It gets more and more difficult as more cars come into the            
    intersection.                                                         
    Features bonus stars: Run over the corresponding star to get an       
    extra bonus point. But don't run over the wrong color star, it will   
    deduct points! You can crash, it's okay, the Accident Indicator on    
    the bottom left will turn yellow, but then red to end the game. (     
    But if you navigate a few cars successfully this will go back to      
    green again.) If you enjoy games such as Flight Control, and Harbor
