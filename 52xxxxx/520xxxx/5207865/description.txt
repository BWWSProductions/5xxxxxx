Rann-Thanagar War
Following on from the Adam Strange 'Planet Heist' storyline (included in this pack) the Thanagarians and Rannians now all live on Rann, and tensions are high between the two groups, as each blames the other for their predicament.  Aware that war could erupt at any time, Strange goes to Earth to recruit the help of Hawkman and Hawkgirl in preventing a war.



Rann-Thanagar Holy War
Following on from Infinite Crisis, Mystery in Space and 52 the Rann-Thanagar Holy War features some of DC's finest cosmic heroes including Adam Strange, Hawkman, Captain Comet and more! As the nefarious Lady Styx continues her galactic pilgrimage to turn every being in the universe into her own personal congregation, the heroes face everything from time travel assaults to the resurrection of an ancient evil force as they battle her pilgrimage of evil. But not everything is as it seems, and the war involving the planets Rann and Thanagar has far greater effect on our heroes than even they suspect!
