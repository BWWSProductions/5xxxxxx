The man is a liar, and his advocacy reporting is garbage. False. Bought and paid for. Google him for god's sake."

,redactedwv,2011-03-11T21:56Z,"ah, stossel and his ""facts"". Brought to you by Fox News....The only 'news' organization to ever go to court to fight for their right to lie:

Doesn't play in the great white north...Canada's Radio Act which requires that 'a licenser may not broadcast ... any false or misleading news.' On March 1, Canadian regulators rejected the Canadian prime ministers effort's to allow Fox News to broadcast in Canada.

Sorry, Koch brothers! Sorry Rupert! Sorry Roger Ailes! You're all SOL.

 But in America, you are free to have your mind poisoned with straight corporate propaganda. Hurray. The framers assumed we'd be smart enough to see through naked attempts to subvert public discourse, but.... Alas. There was a reason Reagan destroyed the Fairness Doctrine (the same reason righties hate it today).... It prevented the airwaves from becoming a propaganda organ of international corporations. No more."
