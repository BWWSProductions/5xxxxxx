This is the first episode of the new Fox Business Network show, "Stossel", featuring host John Stossel in topics of his own choosing.

This episode focused on the present state of the debate on Global Warming/Climate Change and discussed an appropriate approach to the problem, to the extent it may be one, from his noted libertarian perspective. It featured experts from the CATO Institute and one of the authors of the book, "Super Freakonomics"; and studio audience questions and challenges.

John took a page from Glenn Beck's playbook (ala his "Red Phone" hotline to the White House) and instituted a "Green Phone" hotline whose direct number has reported to have been given to Al Gore. John criticized Al for steadfastly refusing to appear before any venue where real debate might occur. Like Beck is for his phone, Stossel appeared similarly skeptical it will ever ring.
