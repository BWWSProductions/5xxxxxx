,Adr33gtr,2009-12-08T00:58Z,Come on guys lets seed this badboy! ;-D
,lostlunarsoul,2009-12-08T11:55Z,"Can anyone confirm this upload doesn't crash every 15 minutes like all the other pirated Ableton apps?

Those who have used it for more than a few hours straight will find out."
,dodamndont,2009-12-08T13:55Z,It says can't register on this computer. I follow the instructions.
,Adr33gtr,2009-12-08T14:03Z,Can anyone help? i can seem to get it to authorise ive copied the live file and .auz file to the Apps folder and when i click on the .auz file it lunches Ableton but a message pops up saying invalid authorisation file for this computer or something along those lines! Anyone help me where im going wrong?
,emrefidan,2009-12-08T15:09Z,"You have to copy the ""live"" unix executable inside the live.app. To do this, you have to right click on the live.app in the applications folder and click show package contents. And then you have to put cracked file in Live.app/contents/MacOS. After that you can run the .auz file."
,PROTOCOLX,2009-12-08T15:10Z,"Is this 100% working? 
"
,dodamndont,2009-12-08T15:38Z,I'm doing those steps. Its still gives me the error...
,strizbiz,2009-12-08T17:44Z,"PROTOCOLX,  its 100% working if you want a demo, as far as a full working version...more like zero% working"
,dodamndont,2009-12-08T19:38Z,Yeah...this is no good! Can't get out of demo mode. So don't bother downloading until a proper crack comes along...
,vicedevice,2009-12-08T21:08Z,A kindergartner could figure this out. It works perfectly. Thank you ArCADE!
,dodamndont,2009-12-08T23:51Z,Well I must be pretty dumb then...Because I've done the steps 5 times and I still get the same results... But I guess I'll try again.
,dodamndont,2009-12-09T01:25Z,"Nope! I'm on Intel and using Snow Leopard. Still doesn't work! Oh well, thanks for the effort uploader! I'll just keep using Logic Studio 9!"
,bojkata,2009-12-09T01:36Z,thanks!!!!
,pReStOn_C,2009-12-09T10:30Z,"worked like a dream for me, used it for over an hour with no problems and no issues. running on iMAC 20"" Snow 10.6.2. read instructions carefully, it took me a few attempts, but it does work. Thnx Uploader"
,bnbasarir,2009-12-09T11:26Z,"Worked like a charm, first try and runs. You guys who couldn't handle the installation are nothing but a bunch of idiots. Easy and clean instructions, nothing complicated. Don't even bother using it if you can not even installing for christ's sake :))
Good job bro, thanks for the upload. You are the man!"
,leemoretouchy,2009-12-09T12:30Z,"I did this:

install
unpack the crack
after install i replaced live file in the content area
after that if If double click on the LIVE app for let it works it doesn't open itself so what i have to do?"
,PROTOCOLX,2009-12-09T15:33Z,"Okay... It seems that the ones who complain that's not working... They aren't reading.. isn't it?

So if you follow the instructions, it should work..?"
,dodamndont,2009-12-09T15:43Z,"No, I'm doing it right. The directions are really simple. I just think for some reason it's not working for me. It could be because I already had a Demo version of Live 8 installed before. Seriously I'm doing everything right. I've applied cracks to tons of things. Cracks with way more steps... I'm sure it is working for some of you guys but just not for me. It just keeps saying the same thing.

It's only two steps really. Replace the the live file with the cracked one. And then click the authorize thing. Yes it's simple but no luck here. Anyway like I said I'm sure it works for some people but not for me. Has nothing to do with ""READING"" "
,anirog,2009-12-09T16:33Z,"dodamndont, did you completely remove the live 8 demo before installing this, I mean trash the ableton 8 folder in /username/library/application support/ & live 8 folder in the /applications/ folder & the plist file in /username/library/preferences/ folder. If you have Live 7 or the live library installed don't trash them. Might not work but worth a try or you may have already done this."
,dodamndont,2009-12-09T18:01Z,"Anirog thanks!! This indeed was the problem! So to anyone else that is having problems make sure all the old files are deleted. (If you already had a demo)

Thanks again man!"
,cachet25,2009-12-09T18:31Z,Ok this is how I got it to work ?. when i copied the crack live file over to replace the original it didn't turn into a executable. It stayed as a text file. So what I did was open the original live app located in the contents/MacOS dir with textedit app and I did the same with the crack version. I then deleted everything out of the original live and replace the text with everything inside the crack version. The save the original file and then replaced back in the contents/MacOS dir. The I clicked on the Authrize81Mac.auz and it worked. Now to verified it save correctly on the Mac just look to see if the icon is a picture of the Terminal app. if not it is still in text format and you will have to just recopy the original Live app back into the contents/MacOS dir. from the cd or the DMG file when you first run the program.
,leemoretouchy,2009-12-09T22:35Z,"From the Content/MacOs folder i open the ""live original"" with text edit. The same with the ""cracked Live"" always with text edit. Then I delete all inside original and replace with the things inside Cracked Live"" inside ""live original"" then i saved but I had the usual problem... the app doesn't start if i click 2 times on the Live logo... really bad :-("
,cachet25,2009-12-09T22:40Z,After everything is replaced click on Authrize81Mac.auz  not the live logo. Authrize81Mac.auz will start it up for you
,leemoretouchy,2009-12-09T22:56Z,"WOW now works!!! Thanks a lot guy!!! I did as cachet25 and now it's works ... just an information... this time Ableton didn't ask me to install the sounds How I can fix it? (it's the first time for me with it)

thanks again"
,cachet25,2009-12-09T23:59Z,"Hmm all the live devices should be there... check under the instrument tab...click on that within live on the left hand side and a drop down list should appear with the Instruments, you should see a Midi Effects tab and a Audio Effects tab to."
,Recktek,2009-12-10T06:57Z,"I have tried all the instructions repeatedly, I'm getting a response of this authorization is invalid on this computer? Is there another authorization patch?

Please help, I feel like it so close."
,leemoretouchy,2009-12-10T09:00Z,"I see :Analog, Collision, drum rack, electric, external instrument, impulse, instrument rack, max instrument, operator, sampler, simpler, tension.... are they all?"
,cachet25,2009-12-10T15:40Z,"when you compare both live app codes in the text edit they will look alike but they're not. just deleted the code out of the original one and then selct all code and copy from the crack then select the original and paste it with the code from the crack one then saved it. That icon should still look like a small tv(terminal) once you save it don't click on the live app, instead click on the .auz file and it will launch it."
,cachet25,2009-12-10T15:41Z,And yes you do unpack the crack zip file
,cachet25,2009-12-10T15:45Z,"Here is another solution I found on the internet if you want to try this one

Posted By: danodee Date: 10 Dec 2009 01:24:54
Install live app in applications (when it asks to drag)
Find live 8 folder/go to live app/right click or click on ACTION /scroll down to package contents this is all new to me
drag or delete the original live exec file ,i dragged the crack.zip file into here (unzipped),which then added the new one.
i also added the same file live exec file again but turned it into a .txt file(just put .txt on the end of the file(NOW THERE IS 3 FILES IN HERE
Now when i came back to click on Authorize81Mac.auz it has a logo in the preview (right hand side)
click on this and LIVE 8 should start running.....click on authorize then ok or updates...its just installing all the samples and plug ins
ITS RUNNING OK SO FAR..SAVING IMPORTING....to get your other AU/VST plug ins you have to switch them on..default is off.

DONT CLICK ON THE MAIN LIVE 8 APP TO GET IT RUNNING,USE THE AUTHORIZE81MAC.AUZ TO DO THIS...NOTICE THE LOGO IN THE PREVIEW WHEN YOU DO THIS.."
,bodegainc,2009-12-10T22:35Z,"@cachet25 sorry I have followed both versions of the crack sequence you posted and I keep getting the same error reading, ""authorization is invalid on this computer"". PLEASE HELP. I am on a 10.5.8 PPC G5"
,renode,2009-12-11T19:47Z,"To everyone having problems getting this to work: I'm an Ableton user since version 4, and a Mac user since 5. I've ran a lot of cracks, and this one is the easiest I've ever used, and so far performs flawlessly. This DOES work. You are either doing one of two things:

1. You might have had a previous installation of Live 8, I'm guessing a demo with a trial activation. You can't just drag that to the trash. There's a reason Windows has an uninstaller component built-in, and it's completely ridiculous that OSX doesn't have that yet. Use AppZapper, AppCleaner or CleanMyMac or some other uninstaller to remove the app AND its dependencies. There are files in the Library used for license/activation that are being left over since you just deleted the Live folder. This is the FIRST thing I did. Restarting is unnecessary - I didn't.

2. Drag the dmg to your desktop from the iso, and the crack folder. Mount the dmg, drag the Live folder to your Applications folder. Open it up, right click Live, show contents. Open contents/MacOS, drag Live from the crack.zip there, overwrite.

3. Drag Authorize81Mac.auz to the Live folder you put in the Applications folder. Double click it to open Live. THAT IS THE ONLY TIME YOU'LL HAVE TO OPEN LIVE WITH Authorize81Mac.auz. After Live opens, DO NOT let it check for updates. Let it install the library sound files / instruments. After it's finished, closing Live then opening Live back up with a Live alias in your dock should work fine, and all instruments should be available, including MAX. This works for me flawlessly on 10.6.2"
,demondroid,2009-12-11T22:17Z,"I followed the steps renode mentioned and still got 'authorization is invalid on this computer'.

I then ejected the dmg and tried again and this time worked!

I'm not an experienced mac user, mabye this is a given. However, a free tip for other mac-noobs out there!"
,eSpace_client,2009-12-12T21:01Z,How do I get Max to work??
,ftyfhgv,2009-12-13T03:08Z,"hey, i'm really new at torrents so sorry if i ask stupid questions. i don't know exactly what to do with crack.zip in relation to live exec file, i know everyone says it's extremely simple but i have no experience with torrents
thanks"
,benboss,2009-12-14T01:22Z,"Here's what I did to get it to work:

1. Run the Live installer
2. Run Live application before patching
3. Let all instruments, etc. load. and say authorize later
4. Once done installing instruments, quit Live
5. Unzip the patch. 
6. You will see the Live executable but it may show as a generic white file.  I used the freeware program batchmod to change ownership and give all users to write and execute
7. After this is done, the file changes to the terminal-like TV icon (showing it is executable)
8. Replace the executable in the package contents per the instructions
9. Double-click the auz file and it will open Live and auto-athorize for you "
,benboss,2009-12-14T01:24Z,The problem is with the executable permissions on the Live cracked file.  What some people are doing by opening in a text editor is inadvertently getting the permissions set back to their user after re-saving.  Use batchmod and you will not run the risk of damaging the file. 
,rodentdp,2009-12-14T02:35Z,Has anyone tried using this from the Launchpad edition of 8? Would the same rules apply to people using Lite/demo versions?
,Saeden,2009-12-14T08:07Z,"I think I fucked up pretty bad. I hit the update button by mistake in Live and the updater launched. What was odd is that adobe acrobat came up as looking for an update. After the window stated there were no updates available i quit adobe and the adobe updater.

Immediately after this my internet browser reverted to demanding a comcast account login.

What is the possibility I will get a copyright infringement bill in the mail? I've only heard of things like this happening and people not being able to use their own internet until the bill is paid.

Until this is resolved I would appreciate all help to my dilemma. I have internet now, I jacked into my neighbors wi-fi with pretty good reception. In retrospect it would have been awesome if I had done this little fuck up on his internet connection."

,Dub1,2009-12-16T14:12Z,"I've only registered just to assure others that this torrent DOES work!!

I too spent a good few evenings trying to work out how to get this to install, and nearly gave up. 

Using batchmod on the live file (tick all boxes on permissions) once that file has its permissions set then you are good to go. I right clicked on the Authorize81Mac.auz and selected open with 'Live 8.1'. At first it said auth failed, but exiting ableton and using the correct Live 8.1 file to then open worked for me.

You will more than likely have to use batchmod, and Follow instructions on previous page and you will get there!!! be patient and take your time. ENJOY!!"
,xdgreat,2009-12-16T19:00Z,"Yeap, how about Max for live Could anyone make it work? Cheers"
,dethbunny,2009-12-17T07:57Z,"I can confirm what skyluke said earlier, unfortunately the live crack does not work for PPC.  The only thing you'll get with this version is the message ""This authorization file is invalid on this computer.""  That means all of you old PPC G5 users are left in the dark -- either switch to Apple Intel or Wintel or you won't be running Ableton 8 unless someone makes a PPC version of the crack."

,rip_richards,2010-01-02T03:50Z,"im sorry for the bad news everyone but it was finally confirmed from the top through a colleague that these AIR Ableton releases are actually from Ableton that is why after 2-3 months or so of use they all of a sudden crash and no longer work! The idea is that you will be in the middle of an important live set and the cracked copy will let you down at the worst possible moment - thus leading to you buying Ableton.  I have used cracked copies of 5,6 + 7 and experienced first hand with 7 this problem.  Read the forums you will see what i mean.  Total shame, i wish this was not the case but i promise you all this will happen... youll see. enjoy it whilst it lasts or buy. RIP"

What the txt didn't specify this but it will solve the problem

1) go to the folder you copied the app to right click on the original Live.app file 
2) click on show package contents it will open up a new window with the folder and you will see a folder called ""content""
3) click on ""content"" to expand it then you will see a folder called MacOS click on that and you will see the live file to be overwritten

,iamscenic,2010-02-04T01:46Z,"This DOES work. It did not work for me the first time through but I deleted everything and re-downloaded the torrent and voila.

Once you've downloaded the whole torrent, follow these steps to guide you through the process:

1. Extract ""arc-abletonsuite81.rar"" to get the SUITE81.iso file
2. Double click SUITE81.iso file and you see ""ableton_suite_81.dmg"" and a folder titled ""ArCADE"". In the ArCADE folder is ""Authorize81Mac.auz"" ""crack.zip"" and ""ReadMe.txt""
3. Before anything, unzip crack to the desktop and you find the cracked ""Live"" application. Set that aside.
4. Run ""ableton_suite_81.dmg"" and you get the terms and then a window that asks you to drag the ""Live 8.1 OSX"" folder to your hard drive. Drag it into Applications and you'll see inside the ""Live"" app, ""Docs,"" ""Legal,"" and ""License""
5. Secondary click ""Live"" in this folder and go to ""Show Package Contents"" then open the ""Contents"" folder and then open the ""MacOSX"" folder. In here you see the uncracked ""Live"" executable file.
6. Open the UNCRACKED ""Live"" file in text editor. You should see a ridiculously long code. Now go back to the CRACKED ""Live"" file you set aside earlier and open that in a separate text editor. Pay close attention here. Remove everything in the UNCRACKED document and replace that ridiculously long code with the CRACKED document's ridiculously long code. File>Save (not save as) and the Live file inside ""MacOSX"" should be overwritten with the CRACKED code.
7. Go back and run ""Authorize81Mac.auz"" in the ArCADE folder and it should open up the program no problems.

Don't get impatient, follow the steps carefully, and let your computer get through each installation/authorization uninterrupted. If it doesn't work the first time, TRY AGAIN!

Thanks for this torrent!"
,Alexstre,2010-02-05T17:56Z,"This is weird. I can't get to launch Live after the cracking. What I've tried:

Try #1
1. Open Contents/MacOSX/ and overwrite Live with the crack'd version
2. Use batchmod to fix the permissions on Live
3. Move the auz file to the Live 8.1 folder and double click'd it

Try 2
1. Run Live, let it install the packages and what not, don't update, don't do anything else.
2. Overwrite Contents/Mac OSX/Live with the crack'd one
3. Move the auz file to Live 8.1 folder, run it.

In both cases the Live logo flashes and closes immediately. I've tried every combination I could think of (things to do, order in which to do them). The crack seems really easy to install and I don't get why the app won't run at all after being cracked. I'm on a MBP running 10.6 btw.

,bluekite,2010-02-19T00:59Z,i can't unzip the crack folder. tried it with various programs as well as on a pc. can anyone explain why? it does the loop thing between unzipping to a cpgz file and a zip file. when i tried on the pc it just came up with an error. 
,Uncle-Pervy,2010-02-20T19:53Z,""""" 1. Extract ""arc-abletonsuite81.rar"" to get the SUITE81.iso file
2. Double click SUITE81.iso file and you see ""ableton_suite_81.dmg"" and a folder titled ""ArCADE"". In the ArCADE folder is ""Authorize81Mac.auz"" ""crack.zip"" and ""ReadMe.txt""
3. Before anything, unzip crack to the desktop and you find the cracked ""Live"" application. Set that aside.
4. Run ""ableton_suite_81.dmg"" and you get the terms and then a window that asks you to drag the ""Live 8.1 OSX"" folder to your hard drive. Drag it into Applications and you'll see inside the ""Live"" app, ""Docs,"" ""Legal,"" and ""License""
5. Secondary click ""Live"" in this folder and go to ""Show Package Contents"" then open the ""Contents"" folder and then open the ""MacOSX"" folder. In here you see the uncracked ""Live"" executable file.
6. Open the UNCRACKED ""Live"" file in text editor. You should see a ridiculously long code. Now go back to the CRACKED ""Live"" file you set aside earlier and open that in a separate text editor. Pay close attention here. Remove everything in the UNCRACKED document and replace that ridiculously long code with the CRACKED document's ridiculously long code. File>Save (not save as) and the Live file inside ""MacOSX"" should be overwritten with the CRACKED code.
7. Go back and run ""Authorize81Mac.auz"" in the ArCADE folder and it should open up the program no problems. """"  


I did what this person said and it seems to be working fine.

,soggybboy,2010-02-24T02:04Z,actually Ableton 7 live is working perfectly but when i try opening Suite 8 it says it cannot be authorized on this computer! i need help!
,DommyS,2010-02-24T18:23Z,"IF YOU ARE GETTING THE 'AUTHORIZATION FILE IS INVALID' error (or similar), then here are a few tips that might help.

I too had the error, but after i did a few things it worked; it's hard to pinpoint which thing is what made it work, so here's a list of everything i did differently;

1. Make sure you have no previous editions of ableton on your computer (including demo's); you may need to download programs like apptrap to make sure you get rid of all the associated files.

2. unzip the crack with 'archive utility' (probably already on your computer); when unzipped with 'zipeg', the crack was coming out as a text file for me and not an executable file.

3. just replace the 'live' file with the crack (the file in contents/macos)

4. place the authorize81mac.auz file in the 'live 8.1 OS X' folder in your harddrive, and run this not the live icon when your ready to go.

from here just install the instruments/ upgrade the libraries etc.

hope this helps.  if your new (like me), then just keep trying. it took me a while to get there but you will eventually, and its worth it."

have I done everything completely wrong?

,ninesevenfive,2010-03-28T18:30Z,"Okay, so here is what i did, and for me it works perfect, and it was quite simple.

1. Unpack the ""arc-abletonsuite81.rar"".
2. Mount the ""SUITE81.iso""
3. Move the folder ""ArCADE"" to your map with the downloaded Ableton.
4. Run ""ableton_suite_81.dmg""
5. Drag the ""Live 8.1"" folder to: Applications.
6. Unzip the crack in the ""ArCADE"" folder.
7. Drag the crack, ""Live"", to Contents/MacOS.
8. Run the ""Authorize81Mac.auz"".
9. Done, should work now. "

however i'm having an issue with the library. it gives an error message saying 'a device is not properly attached or the library has been moved or deleted'

any ideas?"
,queue42,2010-05-02T21:54Z,"disregard that last comment of mine, i've fixed the problem.

if anyone else gets this error message, you just have to go into Preferences>Library and set a new location, after which Live will ask if you'd like to install the default packs.

now running happily on 10.6.2, thanks for a great torrent!"

""the authorization file is unvalid on your computer""
i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong, it might be because i don't know what to do for : 
 3. Move the folder ""ArCADE"" to your map with the downloaded Ableton.

1. Install Ableton as you would normaly
2. Once installed go to the Live 8.1 os x folder
3. On the Live application file icon Right click/ double finger click or what ever you need to do to get  the option to ""show package contents"" option and select
3. Open the Contents folder then the MacOS folder in this folder is the ""Live"" file that you need to replace with the cracked version supplied in the crack folder.
4. Move the Authorize81mac.auz to the Live .1 OS X folder and click on it once its in there to start Ableton live.

I mean a complete wipe out of my system: cannot boot, cannot access via Firewire, cannot do anything. I've worked with computers since 1965, and with Apple/Macs since their beginnings: I have never seen a more comprehensive stuff up with a piece of software. DO NOT USE THIS.

,chaaarbok,2011-07-07T23:46Z,"HERE IS A VERY CLEAR GUIDE ON HOW TO INSTALL THIS TORRENT. IT WILL WORK, I PROMISE.

I realize the ReadMe is not the clearest thing in the world for those of us who don't know all that much abotu directories and contents and crap. I had to do a lot of research, but I figured it out and I'm here to give it to you clearly:

Step 1) After the torrent has completed its download, you'll recieve a folder filled with files with extensions "".r00"", "".r01"", "".r02"", etc etc. Find the one ending in just "".rar"" and double click on it. Proceed with the extraction. (Alternately, I believe extracting the "".r00"" one works as well).

Step 2) Mount the .ISO by double clicking. Most Macs should figure out what to do with it without trouble. 

Step 3) Within the .ISO are two things: The Live .DMG, and a folder called ""ArCADE"". First, double-click the ""ArCADE"" folder. 

Step 4) You'll see a few files. First, extract (double-click on) crack.zip and remember where it extracts to. Leave this window open.

Step 5) Go back to the .ISO folder, double-click the .DMG, and allow it to extract. Follow the installation instructions of the program (ie copy the folder to your hard drive).

Step 6) Go to the folder you just copied and open it up. Find the ""Live"" application icon, right click on it, and hit ""Show Package Contents"". 

Step 7) Click ""Contents"" in the windows that just opened, then go into the ""MacOS"" folder. You should see a little UNIX/Terminal app thing just labeled ""Live"". 

Step 8) Go back to the folder from step 4 (the place that the crack extracted to) and replace the extracted crack (also just named ""Live"") with one in this MacOS folder. 

Step 9) When it asks if you want to overwrite, hit ""Replace"". 

Step 10) Close all useless windows and go back into the ""ArCADE"" folder from step 3 (or was it four...?)

Step 11) Double click on the weirdly named file. ""Authorize81Mac"" or whatever. This should run on its own, open Live, and then take its time loading everything up.

Step 12) Cross your god damn fingers.

Step 13) 

Step 14) Profit

I hope this helped some of you!"

SIX HOURS.  Ugh.  I know I'm a sinner for not buying the program, but what penniless musician can afford ĂÂŁ500??
