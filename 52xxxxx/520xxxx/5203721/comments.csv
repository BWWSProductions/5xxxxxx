Be sure to EDIT your Header information or you will end up with invoices with the ""SNAPPY"" header information instead of yours.

Thanks for a great Torrent!

,reesez_pieces,2011-01-27T10:31Z,"ok, so the program is awesome. I do have a problem though. clicking EDIT to fix the header with my own logo and company name isn't working, so I followed the help steps to open the header in WordPad. (I also opened it in Microsft Word). Neither program will let me save the file so as to have it change my header. And, yes, I did go to where the original header was saved and clicked properties to change it from a read-only file. Even though the properties show that it's no longer a read-only file, I still cannot save it to change the header manually. What I get is a box telling me I have to contact the administrator. Please Help!"
