Unless you have the whole split personality thing going on."

,LeSet,2009-12-25T13:37Z,"For those of you playing SC Demo!

From Digiex!

Dealspwn report it is currently possible to exploit a glitch on the demo of Shadow Complex which allows you to play the entire game for free.

This is what to do.

1) Firstly, download the free Shadow Complex demo from Xbox Live Market Place.

2) Then, as you near the end of the demo, you will come up against a big mechanical spider. When you eventually defeat this boss and it starts exploding, keep hammering the start button.

3) Then, when it lets you, select ?Load Last Save? and this will enable you to bypass the point at which the demo should end and play the entire Shadow Complex game for free.

The only problem is you will not be able to save, however, as the game quite short, it is possible to complete in one sitting.

It worx! Njoy!"
