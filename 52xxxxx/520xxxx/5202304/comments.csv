Thanks"
,CaveHermit,2010-11-21T02:21Z,Sorry.. It somehow ended up in a stopped state.. (everything else was seeding.. just now this one)..
,NeilPatrickGarrus,2011-06-28T19:34Z,"I will seed this as much as I can, though I don't know what sneaky rules my ISP has in regard to uploading/bandwidth use!"
,CaveHermit,2011-08-27T02:22Z,Argh... Why does this torrent keep entering a stopped state.
,Wurflebluster,2011-08-30T18:39Z,Torrent seems to have died again. Your others seem to work
