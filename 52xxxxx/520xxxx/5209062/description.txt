This documentary focuses on the everyday life and daily toil of three elderly rice farmers in the heart of Taiwan's rice-producing countryside. It is an inspiring film which explores man's relationship with the land. Even though the WTO has affected the farmers' livelihood, their fortitude and humanity against hardship remains.
