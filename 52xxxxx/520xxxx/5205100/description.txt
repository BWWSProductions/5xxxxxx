"Deck the Halls" (original English title: "Deck the Hall") is a traditional Yuletide and New Years' carol. The "fa-la-la" refrains were probably originally played on the harp. The tune is Welsh dating back to the sixteenth century, and belongs to a winter carol, Nos Galan. In the eighteenth century Mozart used the tune to "Deck the Halls" for a violin and piano duet. The repeated "fa la la" is from medieval ballads and used in Nos Galan, the remaining lyrics are American in origin dating from the nineteenth century.

An adaptation of "Deck the Halls" was recorded by country music group SHeDAISY that was made for their Christmas studio album Brand New Year and was featured in the Disney animated film Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas. The music video features scenes of the movie. The single was released on November 9, 1999.

SHeDAISY (pronounced /ÊƒÉ™ËˆdeÉªzi/) is a Grammy Award-nominated American country music group founded in the late 1980s by sisters Kristyn Robyn Osborn (born August 24, 1970), Kelsi Marie Osborn (b. November 21, 1974), and Kassidy Lorraine Osborn (b. October 30, 1976), all natives of Magna, Utah. The group's name is derived from a Navajo term meaning "my (little) sister".

The trio was initially known as The Osborn Sisters. Signed to the Nashville division of RCA Records, they recorded one album which was never released. By 1999, they had assumed the name SHeDAISY and had signed to Lyric Street Records. Their first album to be released, The Whole SHeBANG, was issued that year and has been certified platinum in the United States. A Christmas album titled Brand New Year was released in 2000. Knock on the Sky was issued in 2002, followed by 2004's gold-certified Sweet Right Here, 2006's Fortuneteller's Melody and 2008's The Best of SHeDAISY, a compilation.

Counting two Christmas singles, SHeDAISY has charted 15 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. These include the Top Ten hits "Little Good-Byes", "This Woman Needs", "I Willâ€¦ But", and "Don't Worry 'Bout a Thing".

Brand New Year is a Christmas (second overall) album from country music trio SHeDAISY; it was released September 26, 2000. The renditions of "Deck the Halls" and "Jingle Bells" both charted on the Billboard country charts in 2000, peaking at #37 and #44, respectively.
