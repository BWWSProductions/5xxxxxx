,Schwein,2009-12-09T03:12Z,"mak69: S07E10 means season 10 episode 7.
And if it were to be a whole season that would mean less than 9 MiB/episode. Something you probably wouldn't even want to watch on your cell phone."
,Schwein,2009-12-09T03:13Z,"Sorry about that, of course it was supposed to be season 7 episode 10."
