This is my first torrent upload, so hopefully it works out...

Inside here, is the deluxe version of this album, it includes the songs, as well as instrumental versions of the songs, 4 bonus songs, 40 Beta Session versions of the songs, and 2 lengthy audio commentaries by Klayton himself, a very high resolution version of the album art, and a PDF containing the song lyrics, and fan art, along with some copyright stuff. (but who cares about copyrights on this site?)

The song names are:

Eon
Best It's Gonna Get

Seed and enjoy!
