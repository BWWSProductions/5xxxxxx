This file can be downloaded from microsoft themselves. It is microsofts own cd key changing tool.  Us it to change your cd key to a Windows genuine product key (or at least valid one).  Works with most xp versions, black or otherwise.  I belive it will work with vista as well but I have not tried it as I am on a personal anti-vista campaign and refuse to install or recomend it to anyone.  It does report some information back to MS, however nothing more than the usual mac address and such,certainly no more than google has on you already.

Anyway it is a straight executable file just download and run.  You can paste the new key in using "ctl v". Easy as pie. This tool will also validate your windows at the same time.

Please seed!!! 



and remember BACKUP,BACKUP,BACKUP is not just what you want when your computer crashes.
