NO CROWD NOISES

Ripped from the Wii disc as follows:

6-channel .fsb -> 6-channel WAV

If you don't know what the difference between flac and 320KB/s mp3 is, or if you have stereo speakers, do yourself a favor and download the 320 mp3 rip instead.

I pulled every music track from the disc, listened to and named them according to the previous 88-song release, and then figured out what the tracks that were missing from that release were and named them accordingly. Some of the tags are messed up. If this upsets you, PM me and I'll give you a full refund.

For the tracks that are for two players, there were two 6-channel audio files for each player: one guitar track and one DJ track. I mixed the matching 6-channel WAV files in Adobe Premiere Pro and then exported them as single 6-channel WAVs, which I then used when converting to MP3. Some tracks have 1 or 2 seconds of silence in the beginning. You can handle it, as I did not edit these songs in any way and I refuse to do so.

I also found three tracks that are not in the game and are not mentioned anywhere online as being in the game. These are:

* Ludacris vs. RHCP - Ludakiss (this is how the .xml tracklist file in the game referred to this track, so this is what I named it)

* Aceyalone vs. unknown artist - Lost Your Mind vs. unknown song (the name "Bob" was used as the other artist, but that obviously wasn't sufficient to come to any conclusion about who that is)

* Bliss n Eso vs. unknown artist - Party At My Place vs. unknown song (no information in the xml about this track)

This took a long-ass time, but I am a hardcore DJ Shadow fan so it was gonna be for me anyway.

Lastly, the entire soundtrack was mastered at 32khz. This is not a transcode, it was released lossy and therefore will look like a transcode if you don't know what you're looking for.

ENJOY!
