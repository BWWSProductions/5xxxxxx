I Cut Like A Buffalo is the third track from the album Horehound, by the alternative rock group The Dead Weather in 2009. It was also released as the third single from the album (after "Hang You from the Heavens" and "Treat Me Like Your Mother.")

The track was written solely by drummer Jack White. The music video for the song was also directed by White.

The Dead Weather is an American alternative rock supergroup formed in Nashville, Tennessee in 2009. Comprised of Alison Mosshart (of The Kills and Discount), Jack White (of The White Stripes and The Raconteurs), Dean Fertita (of Queens of the Stone Age) and Jack Lawrence (of The Raconteurs and The Greenhornes), The Dead Weather debuted at the opening of Third Man Records' Nashville headquarters on March 11, 2009. The band performed live for the first time at the event, immediately before releasing their debut single "Hang You from the Heavens".

Horehound is the debut studio album by American rock band The Dead Weather. It was released on July 10 in Australia, July 13 in Europe, and July 14, 2009 in North America. The album was recorded at Third Man Studios during a three week session in January 2009. The first single from the album, "Hang You from the Heavens", was released through iTunes on March 11, 2009, and on vinyl on April 18, 2009. "Treat Me Like Your Mother" was released as the second single from the album on May 25, 2009. . The third single from the album is set to be "I Cut Like a Buffalo" and will include a cover of The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band's "A Child of a Few Hours is Burning to Death" as a B-side. The album debuted at #6 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Charts and at #14 on the UK Album Charts.

In January 2009, Mosshart, Fertita, Lawrence, and White got together for an impromptu jam at White's Third Man studio. The session was followed by two-and-a-half weeks of song writing and recording, during which the Dead Weather formed. Said White: "Things just started to happen. We didn't have a direction. We just went a song a day, two songs a day, whatever we could do and recorded them on the fly... There was no time to think about what it was. It just was."

Horehound is The Dead Weather's debut album. It was released on July 14 2009 in North America, and July 13 in Europe. It entered the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Charts at #6 and the UK Album Charts at #14. Three tracks from Horehound ("No Hassle Night", "Hang You From the Heavens", and "Treat Me Like Your Mother") were made available as downloadable content for the Rock Band video game series on the same day as the North American release.

On October 16, 2009, Alison Mosshart confirmed that a second album was "halfway done"
