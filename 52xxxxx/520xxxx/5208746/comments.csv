,Cananda,2009-12-11T01:26Z,There's some skipping around the 18 minute mark
,TyCetto,2010-01-19T09:55Z,"Yes, that's true Cananda. But not much lost from it."
,libertaswv,2010-02-03T00:31Z,"Sorry mate - sound is fairly wretched on this one (tinny, levels rise and fall, buzzing at the highs and lows). Combine that with the skipping mentioned by Cananda, and you might want to seek out another seed. Uncharacteristic low qual from the usually perfect VTV. 

Appreciate all your work, VTV - but this one doesn't measure up to your usual quality. "
