don't listen to zmacdaddy8.

sure the video could be better, but it is ok.
the audio is good.
the movie is awesome!

this movie is what ""kill bill"" wanted to be.
you won't be disappointed."
,zeno600w,2009-12-13T18:33Z,maybe there is something wrong with zmacdaddy8's  eyes or pc...don't listen to him he is crazy
,Assistman,2009-12-25T17:29Z,Someone can release subtitles in english for this film?
,Sarkasmi,2010-01-15T16:08Z,"zmacdaddy8, what the hell is wrong with you? 

Sure, this isn't the best 740mb encoding I've seen, since it's still a little blurry, especially when watched with a big TV but the pixelation you're talking about didn't happen once. 

Don't go shouting shit if your player/codecs act up, ok?

And you insisted on getting a good copy and ended up downloading a  469.27mb version with lower resolution??

wow..

Sure the 460mb rip is watchable too but this does have a better video quality than that one.

So, anyone else, don't listen to this dude, he's trashtalking this rip coz he didn't get it to work properly for some reason. (I didn't have to go through anything, it just played like it's supposed to with VLC player)


I'd say the audio is a 9-10 and video at least an 8. It's not as crystal clear that a 747mb file could be, like some great ones.. and indeed does look pretty gritty when you start watching it, BUT I watched a blurayrip of ""Stepfather"" just before it so the quality caught my eye mostly because of that :) 

It won't bother your viewing experience, unless you want your movies to be exact DVD quality.
