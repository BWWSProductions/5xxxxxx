JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS!

There is NO OTHER PERSON who has this on the web and I've been looking for YEARS so I finally caved in and bought the DVD from the internet (wasn't easy to find BELIEVE me) And thought I'd share it with the world so that noone else has to look much further anymore for:

ARTHUR'S PERFECT CHRISTMAS


This is a DVDRIP, which I ripped using MovAvi Video Converter 8, It's in AVI (MPEG4 Xvid Encoded) I tried to convert it in higher quality like MPEG4 HD 1080p and 720p but kept having problems with the audio codecs in the actual DVD itself so this is STANDARD QUALITY but still DVD Quality and VERY Watchable.


THIS IS THE ONLY TRUE DVDRIP ON THE NET SO I DONT WANNA HEAR ANY COMPLAINING!


AND REMEMBER TO SEEEEEEEEED!!!!




ENJOY!!!!! :D


MERRY CHRISTMAS!
