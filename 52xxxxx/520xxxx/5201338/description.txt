Oh here you are, there's nothing left to say


You're not supposed to be that way


Did they push you out? did they throw you away?





Touch me now and I don't care


When you take me I'm not there


Almost human, but I'll never be the same








Long way down, I don't think I'll make it on my own


Long way down, I don't want to live in here alone


Long way down, I don't think I'll make it on my own








I never put you down, I never pushed you away


You're not supposed to be that way


And anything you want, there's nothing I could say





Is there anything to feel?


Is it pain that makes you real?


Cut me off before it kills me








Long way down, I don't think I'll make it on my own


Long way down, I don't want to live in here alone


Long way down, I don't think I'll make it on my own








I never put you down, I never pushed you away


Take another piece of me


Give my mind a new disease


And the black and white world never fades to gray








Long way down, I don't think I'll make it on my own


Long way down, I don't want to live in here alone


Long way down, I don't think I'll make it on my own
