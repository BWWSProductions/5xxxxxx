,bondaddys,2009-12-12T19:50Z,"yeah had the same problem it was in italian

simple way of fixing it is start up the game then exit it go to: C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\gothic3
then find UserOptions.ini open it up and change
VoiceLanguage=Italian
SubtitleLanguage=Italian

to

VoiceLanguage=English
SubtitleLanguage=English

worked perfectly for me hope this helps"

,warbound,2011-01-11T21:53Z,@bonddaddys I looked through every dir in Win7 and found an .Ini folder in the install Dir. However i went through every notepad and couldnt find a single reference. Two of the pads are in Italian so i would have to change the language to even find it there if it is.. Yes my hidden folders are enabled. Any help would be appreciated.
,Majty,2011-01-17T19:53Z,"Warbound, the file UserOptions.ini wont exist until you have started Gothic 3. Im using Win7 x64 and I found it after starting the game but NOT before."
,warbound,2011-01-20T02:28Z,@ Majty thanks i was able to open up the UserOptions.ini in Win7 64 @ Libraries/Documents/Gothic III now the subtitles are in English.

,blurx1x1,2012-05-11T21:18Z,"For those who followed xflamecrossx instructions to change to English (Open the Ge3 .ini file with notepad, located at Gothic IIIIni, then at the bottom of the notepad change the words Italian to English) This MUST be done BEFORE you apply the community patch. You can tell if it worked because the 1.7 patch will say language English rather than Italian in the installer."
