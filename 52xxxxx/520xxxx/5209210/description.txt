According to TormÃ©, the song was written during a blistering hot summer. In an effort to â€œstay cool by thinking cool,â€ the most-performed (according to BMI) Christmas song was born.

New Found Glory (formerly A New Found Glory) is an American rock band from Coral Springs, Florida. Since their formation in 1997, the quintet has consisted of Jordan Pundik (vocals), Chad Gilbert (guitar, backing vocals), Steve Klein (guitar), Ian Grushka (bass) and Cyrus Bolooki (drums) for the majority of its existence. Influenced by punk revival bands from the 1990s such as Green Day and NOFX, they are renowned for incorporating pop sensibility into a punk rock sound. Subsequently, they are now widely credited as a key pioneer in the fusion genre of pop punk. Also noted for their energetic live performances, the band have garnered a devout following over the course of their career. As of 2007, New Found Glory has sold approximately 2.5 million records.

Having met during high school, the band soon released the debut EP It's All About the Girls (1997) on independent label Fiddler Records. Later, debut album, Nothing Gold Can Stay (1999) was released on Eulogy Records and helped earn the band a significant following. Whilst still in their teens, the five-piece signed their first proper record deal with Drive-Thru Records, and recorded a cover EP of songs from film soundtrack's titled, From the Screen to Your Stereo (2000). Later that year, debut single "Hit or Miss" peaked at #15 on the US Modern Rock Chart, which helped propel the band to a mainstream audience. Subsequently their self-titled second album New Found Glory (2000) spent 21 weeks on the Billboard 200 chart and peaked at #107.

Between 2002 and 2004, the band experienced the height of their popularity with headline slots on the Warped Tour with Blink-182 and a supporting tour with Green Day. Third album and mainstream breakthrough, Sticks and Stones (2002), peaked at #4 on the Billboard 200 chart helped by popular singles "My Friends Over You" and "Head on Collision" (charting at #5 and #28 on the Rock Chart respectively). "All Downhill from Here" reached #11 in the Rock Chart before fourth album, Catalyst (2004) peaked at a career-high #3 on the Billboard 200. Their next album, Coming Home (2006), marked a stylistic change that differed largely from earlier material. Despite a lack of label support it entered the Billboard chart at #19, and was warmly received by critics for its maturity.
