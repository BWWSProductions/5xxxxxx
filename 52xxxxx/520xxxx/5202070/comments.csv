,TombRaiderAddict,2011-03-05T12:16Z,"I think you're pushing your luck with the joystick. Just use regular keyboard.

It would be in the tomb raider setup to configure a joystick."
,valters123,2011-03-31T20:07Z,You can use JoyToKey to make your joystick act as keyboard
,Brokemborings31,2011-06-02T18:24Z,"anybody else having troubles to save the game?
I downloaded from here, the game is working fine, but I can't save the progress!
Why? Am I the only one having this trouble? "
,TombRaiderAddict,2011-09-19T23:31Z,"Run it as 'Administrator' if you have savegame problems. It needs those privileges to write files to the drive.

,StarMatt,2011-09-29T21:48Z,"Hello. I can't install the game, the setup.exe does nothing and the autorun crashes.... What can I do ? Thanks."
,TombRaiderAddict,2011-09-29T23:10Z,"@StarMatt

try running it as administrator, or in compatibility modes via the properties menu. 

Please tell me your system specs."
,StarMatt,2011-09-30T00:11Z,"Thanks for the quick reply. I tried run it as an administator but it doesn't change anything, the compatibility mode seems to be set on Windows XP, and I can't change it.

I try to run it on a Asus EEE 1015px on W7 home prem.
Proc: dual-core Intel Atom N570 processor clocked at 1.66 GHz
and 2 GB RAM"
,arx76891,2011-10-30T02:50Z,"Regards. Thanks for the game, I was playing, but I was unable to save it.
I run windows XP and I only have one user, which means I am the administrator.
When I am trying to save the game, I just click enter or space or any key, and I just can't save it... Please help me!"
,arx76891,2011-10-30T05:12Z,"Thanks! Solve problem: Not using autorun, start TR directly from the start menu"
