[V],Slickinator,2009-12-08T14:07Z,a pre release
,Blaze_Of_Glory,2009-12-09T19:38Z,Could be a false positive but Norton registered a Trojan on install.
[V],Slickinator,2009-12-10T01:35Z,hmmm well then its the vso site that has the problem as i downloaded this right from the vso site and is not tampered with straight from them and i installed it and tested and then directly uploaded so better check what was installed and see where the file came from in the quarintined area it should tell you when it was snagged from could have been just bad timing 
,sheenayanis,2009-12-11T13:04Z,"yap,works nicely and no virus...
