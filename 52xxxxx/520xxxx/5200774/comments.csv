,throbbing-gristle,2009-12-07T10:09Z,"A gem of a film, ending SF may creak a bit after 45 years but the story and performances are lovely. Great for adults and kids. Tony Randal an almost forgotten actor of considerable talent. The upload will renew interest, I have it  on DVD, you can still get it."
