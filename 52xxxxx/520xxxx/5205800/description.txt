Note: We have now released our 6.88GB CD+G versions on the net,  and will have 640X480 Divx to match posted here soon.

This is the zipped file version of our new 5.11GB CD+G Karaoke DJ torrent.
We prefer non-zipped files mainly (in torrents use), however zips can and do save bandwidth which is why we see both cdgs and zips on torrents that are around. If you ever download a corrupt zip file (can happen over time on the torrent system), locate the non zipped folder and get what you need from it.

We plan to post the non zipped torrent here too, we just have to figure out wht theres a system glitch when we try to post it. We do have it on the net though and it is already seeding. 

There are many additions and fine tuning improvements to give a more rounded offering to a DJ setup.

We think this is a great oportunity to set yourself up cheap with a laptop, CD+G player software an amp and a mkie - you got yourself a travelling roadshow!

You could entertain at a retirement home, army base, hospital, school, or even your local pub. Lets bring back sensible tastes in music and people will actand feel better in your communities everywhere our music can be really appreciated as intended.


For DivX needs,our included comverter here will convert a song in an average of a minute and can do the entire folder with just a few keystrokes. 352X240 is the defaul setting for video, use zoom on your divx player for full screen. The CD+G source files should be maintained for porfessional use needs especially.
