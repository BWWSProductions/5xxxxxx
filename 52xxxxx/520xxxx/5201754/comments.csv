You have to burn it, you can use any burning tool, but since serialki11er was nice enough to put in a program for us then why not use it :)

1. Download and install PowerISO.
2. Start PowerISO,
3. Click ""Tools""->""Burn ""
4. Choose CD/DVD writer.
5. Choose the iso file.
6. Choose the burning speed.
7. Click ""Burn"" to start burning. "
,davitodude,2009-12-10T06:05Z,"Worked great! I burned the imagine using brasero which on ubuntu 9.10. Just right/click- burn disc/accept.

I thought it hung a few times on the initial install because it loads up a desktop background and your cursor. That's it for several mins. Be patient with it and everything will go find.

The strangest thing happened to me though. I for some reason cannot use my line out audio to connect to my lg screens audio in. Before it worked on ubuntu.

This had me insane because the drivers were loading and the devices were all showing. Yet no sound. Who would of thought this little bug?"

I did everything how you said. but when i installed it in my Gateway Laptop which had Windows Vista Home Basic previously it got in. and i was able to surf the web and do everything but then it turned off and there was a black screen with a smaller blue screen saying that one of the important file or drivers or whatever was disabled or terminated and that there was a problem.

so i restarted it and it would let me get in. so then i put the cd back in and nothing. Ive tried to install this about 5 times and i havent been successful. so right now my laptop isnt working.

So i downloaded another file, a  windows 7 ultimate upgrade, from piratebay. b4 burning it to disc i thought of checking the setup.exe file. same error about the autorun.dll appeared. is it piratebay? is it bittorrent? i m not sure. i dont thinks its either. pls any suggestions will really help."

even i have my old files in there, also in system says that

i'm lucky guy, so here's the thing maybe if your installing this copy into a
comp that you get with a vista 64 OS from a retail is a good thing, so if you
one like me make sure that your not connected to the net before install it also
turn off your wireless if possible, and when you get to the installation part that
ask you to choose where to install the windows 7 do not delete the partitions of
your old system, just install it where the old system was and wait longer and do 
not worry about if the installation doesn't look like is moving just wait, and the 
last thing i didn't do any update yet i just when to Toshiba and get updates 
to my comp, i have a Toshiba satellite a 305, ohh i forget to say that is 
impossible to upgrade from vista so boot from your cd/dvd and go then choose custom install
your done now and thanks serialki11er for this one"

and people, you do not have to boot from cd or usb. just install virtual clone drive on the comp you want to install 7 on. once you have the iso downloaded, open it with virtual clone drive or search the torrents folders for an application called launcher or setup. run as admin"

,Xcian,2009-12-24T06:52Z,"thanks. installed this yesterday.

had winXP core2duo 1.66ghz 2gb ram.

winXP had a virus it couldnt recover from so i considered reinstalling winXP or trying this out. quite a no-brainer actually.

if youre happy with your current setup then maybe you should think twice before upgrading considering the stuff youd have to do (programs and drivers thatd have to be reinstalled, files to be backed-up). id say im about 70% happier with this than with winXP.

downloaded this. burned the iso on a disc using nero 8 i already had installed on another laptop. could have just mounted it but i wanted a disc-copy.

copied all the files from the burned disc onto a 4gb usb drive following the steps here --> http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd535816.aspx

formatted hard drive during installation.

wi-fi was off. auto updates disabled.

installed daz loader 1.7.7 right after win7 installation.

working well.... so far.

Error code: 0xC000001D""

I'm trying to upgrade from WinXP 32 bit. Oddly, if I mount the .iso file included with this torrent via PowerISO and just run setup.exe through the virtual drive, there's no error message. Of course, I won't try to install this way, as the installation will delete the very mounting program creating the drive that reads the .iso. But can anyone explain how to fix the winsetup.dll error? I've tried looking around for this file, but its necessity for Windows 7 installation seems to be associated with either Vista or computers with very low RAM."

never mind about my question - if you need to activate windows - just use the phone system say its reinstalled on the same pc and you have removed it from the previous one. Works fine then.

cheers 

Thanks for uploading windows 7 - brilliant way to test before buying. A lot better than vista however I still run a dual boot of win7 win vista for work purposes but yeah thanks again.

,thegamma,2010-01-01T17:05Z,I have downloaded several versions of this and after installing them have found that the atapi.sys driver file is infected with a rootkit redirector virus. This virus is nearly impossible to get rid of and makes browsing with google impossible. Has anyone installed this particular torrent and tried browsing the net with google with complete success? Just trying to find a version that does not have the virus.
,kalknagel,2010-01-01T17:37Z,"Ok, I will post this in all 3 equal releases (as mentioned earlier)

For this Windows 7 to work, to be updateable, genuine and activated you need relatively new hardware. With old hardware, or as in my case in a virtual machine that emulates old hardware, you need an extra step.

Install the patch at 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5141013/Windows_7_Slic_Loader_v1.5.6_(29-10-2009)

Install the bootloader, restart (now it may still say it's not genuine), restart again and all is OK!

Thanks @slampy for the bios slic insight.

Ofcourse I can't say anything about the long-term effect, but the fact that Windows says it's activated looks promising."

After doing that i used ultra iso to create a bootable usb drive to install windows 7 on my previous os's partition (xp). Worked out great both ways. would have burned to disk but i may have had a hardware issue that wouldnt let me i tried everything to get on disk:(, so for those of you who are having trouble burning to dvd try this, since youre installing on a seperate partition in the odd event anything did go wrong you dont lose anything. hope this helped someone...................Oh and ive had this for about 15-20 days now still works great thanx serialki11er "

its THAT simple lol. jk i know it was worrisome because it doesn't say Windows 7 on the list of working OSs and it also doesn't say 64 bit.


That brings me to the next point.
This actually has both x64 and x86.
""What about x32?"" x86 is compatible with x32 :D

There is an option for 64 or 86, so choose 86.

,fleetkid,2010-02-14T06:09Z,"@Agnostos:

I use PC tools firewall plus. I have blocked Windows update application from connecting to the internet. Just install it and when it asks you to allow or block windows update choose block (check remember this option). Also go to control panel, search for windows update and choose never update.

Right now this version cannot be blacklisted but as jeepmann4x4 said, Microsoft is planning to use an anti piracy tool which will identify duplicate activations, etc. And once your windows is blacklisted you can either pay online to reactivate it or you can only install a new version. Unless some activation crack comes up (even this would be a prob since that anti piracy tool would have been already installed in your windows)"

,JarrYdd,2010-02-28T06:38Z,lmfao. set ur updates to check for updates but choose wheather i want to install it. once u do that u DO NOT have to install the update that detects pirated product. infact windows reccomends you dont install it just in case. umm and yeh also when u have it u dont need to do any extracting or anything. the file is iso so just burn the image at lowest speed to disc with power iso etc.
,PrettyGeekGirl1978,2010-02-28T10:26Z,I have 2 days till mine expires. Can you do an update with this torrent or do I have to boot nook it?
,JarrYdd,2010-02-28T15:12Z,i wouldnt reccomend upgrade idk. what i did was copy all my stuff i wanted to keep to usb and then formatted my hard drive using format on the disc when installing an djust install clean ;D
,MrTerru,2010-02-28T18:24Z,ANYONE? have ideas why it's doin this? after install it restarts goes to boot from cd..... then freezes and doesn't do anything??????
,PrettyGeekGirl1978,2010-02-28T18:33Z,"MrTerru: Personally it sound like your hard drive went bad during format. This is more common than people realize. 

JrrYdd: Thanks for the tip. And starting fresh sounds good anyway. A good boot nook is good for the system anyway. ;)"
,PrettyGeekGirl1978,2010-02-28T18:40Z,"MrTerru: Also make sure that in BIOS that your computer is booting from hard drive then CD. That could be the problem too. One thing I have found is that through all the torrents, some work on some computers then it wont work on others. My suggestion would be to down load a few of the Windows 7's and figure out which one works for your system. I have been reading allot of comments telling people that they are idiots, because it works on there system, when others are commenting that it wont work for them. Everyone, lets work together and not against each other, isn't that how all of this started? One common goal? Let's help everyone we can! :)"
,MrTerru,2010-02-28T20:05Z,ok i will try that ty :) i notice too that it will run the win7 pre-release vers and run another win7 i downloaded but as soon as i run the activation  crack for it it does the same thing lol freezes right after the boot from cd :)
,MrTerru,2010-02-28T20:21Z,PrettyGeekGirl1978: oh ya one more thing lol i remember when i bought the pc i changed an option in my bios don't remember what it was called lol but to put XP on i had to change SATA to IDE before i could install XP now could that be why too? it needs to be bak onto SATA?
,PrettyGeekGirl1978,2010-02-28T22:17Z,MrTerru: The difference between SATA and IDE the SATA is the interface wire between the mother board and your had drive the IDE is just the identification number of the hard drive the the computer BIOS uses to identify where your hard drive is. So yes change it back to SATA. Windows XP uses the actual interface name rather than the IDE.
,PrettyGeekGirl1978,2010-03-01T08:22Z,"MrTerru: I hope I did not offend you, I re-read my message and it sounded like I was teaching you. I have been a tech for ten years and I have taught allot of people things. I just thought if you did not know what it is, that maybe you would like to know. I love to teach!

,JarrYdd,2010-03-08T14:47Z,this windows is working and genuine. if it says not genuine then you HAVE done something wrong which is: DO NOT SET YOU UPDATING TO AUTOMATIC UPDATING. SET UPDATES TO THE OPTION THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE WETHER TO INSTALL UPDATES. THEN YOU WILL GET THE OPTIONS ON WHAT UPDATES TO INSTALL. DO NOT INSTALL THE UPDATE THAT DETECTS PIRATED KEYS ;D

Let working my laptop for 8hours to seed, installed, run perfect, dowloaded and installed drivers and just when I was going to install Office, appear the most wanted: this copy of windows is not original. Theres nothing to do. Wait for anyone who really kill the validation."
,ceilfisk,2010-04-11T02:39Z,"Thanks to serialki11er, this works fantastic!

I discovered that there is a windows update that you can choose not to download in the update manager. It's code is (KB971033). This update checks whether your version of windows is genuine or not and is called WAT (Windows Activation Technologies). 
To prevent this update from being installed, open the Update Manager (for those of you who don't know, it can be found on this version of windows by clicking on Start > All Programs > Windows Update), find the update with the code KB971033 (it's level of importance will be marked as important, don't worry about that), right click on it and select ""hide update"". Problem solved.

If you have already installed this update, I don't know what to do, that happened to me so I had to reinstall windows to get rid of it."
,JarrYdd,2010-04-14T04:56Z,this works perfectly :) ive had it for a year now and no problems. all you have to do is choose not to install the update that detects if windows is pirated. so dont install this and just right click it and hide it and then its all good

I burnt it slow in my old machine with and my new DVD reader had no problem reading it.  The install with a new M/B and new 1 TB HD, where I had it build a new partition for itself, was very straightforward with the LAN cable off.  That took only about 20 minutes.  Then I installed Avira from a flash drive, and connected the LAN, got I'net access and turned on Manual updates.  In the first batch of updates I blocked (unchecked) and hid (right click) KB971033.  

KB971033 is a patch from M$ which replaces the missing requirements (of this ISO) and thus â€œfixesâ€ windows 7 so that you have to pay for it, or be harassed until you do. Simply choose to ignore downloading or installing or being reminded again of this â€œupgradeâ€ by selecting â€œhideâ€ this upgrade and it will never be an issue.  

The trojan that some have said came in the torrent, the keygen for the PowerISO, is what AVG calls a â€œpotentially unwanted programâ€ (PUP) and Avira also traps it â€“ but you can cancel its quarantine (the exceptions entries don't appear to work). "
