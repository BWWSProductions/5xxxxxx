One of the most gifted and revered performers of our time, Academy Award┬«-winning actor/writer/comedian/free spirit Robin Williams stars in his fifth HBO stand-up special and his first solo TV concert since July 2002. The exclusive comedy event is the culmination of WilliamsΓÇÖ sold-out U.S. tour (his first in six years), and will be taped before a live audience at WashingtonΓÇÖs DAR Constitution Hall.

Moving with the times and his age Robin also focuses on technology, Viagra, prescribed drugs, and his experiences in the past. A few of his jokes were from previous sets, but he always added a new twist, a new dimension that made it even funnier then the past versions.
