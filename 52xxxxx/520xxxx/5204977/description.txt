In FLAC format. This is from the out of print two-disk set, not the single disk recording that is in current release. It took me two years to find this recording at a reasonable price on the used market. The Ormandy recording of Beethoven's 9th that is now in print is seriously flawed. The repeats are edited out in the scherzo and there are dropouts and noise in the recording. This recording has all of the repeats and no technical flaws. It's Ormandy at his best.

BTW, I put this in the "other" category because it has a .txt file with the text to the "Ode to Joy" as sung in the symphony. TPB wouldn't let me upload a torrent with a .txt file in the music category.
