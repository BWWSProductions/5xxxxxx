[T],verifire,2009-12-09T14:50Z,@zmacdaddy8: Thanks for saying thanks. It is a rather great piece of footage and research.. :-)
,sandshreder,2009-12-22T20:05Z,"Before the atheist bashing begins I just want to say,

I love how atheists hide behind things like ""science is truth"". well unfortunately the science in the text books is not always accurate or true. in addition it is sometimes a complete lie. moreover any science that may contradict evolution is often left out of textbooks completely. There is a movement in the scientific community to hide anything that discredits evolution. Lets look at some facts...

evolutionists tell you that DNA mutates and we have these improvements in Biological functions.
the FACT is there has never been a mutation observed that was not harmful to a biological process or function.

Now ask yourself these questions...

How did natural selection develop (over millions of years) ears to hear with when life did not and could not know sound existed?

How did natural selection produce eyes when it could NOT know light existed?

How can the first Male and female sex organs develop in two different organisms at the same time AND work together for the first ever mating process? you want me to believe two similar organism just happened to evolve with two different sex organs that just happen to work together to create off spring?

Now I ask, who is really spreading ferry tales...

God Bless you all, I could go on for hours but atheists are not worth the time.

Jesus says dont throw pearls to pigs... so dont wast time with atheists "

[T],verifire,2009-12-28T21:12Z,"It's true that you shouldn't cast or throw your pearls for dogs and swine, but it's also true that deciding who's who isn't quite as easy as that.

While I do appreciate your thanks, ""sandshreder"", I do recent the notion that ""atheists.. not worth.."" etc. If anyone is to be considered not worth it, I do really think that it should be based on more than simply: ""You don't believe there's a God behind this? Go away.""

However, I do agree that long discussions and arguments belong in other places than the comment-section of a torrent. [I don't go ape on stuff that's not up my alley, so it's really strange to witness the spamming/flaming on Christian torrents..]

So: Peace on earth to men in which God is well pleased.. :-)

,sandshreder,2010-01-06T18:17Z,"Verifire I do understand your point... however I did not say Atheist are not worth it I said they ""are not worth the time"" and Jesus said the same thing in fact he said it with a warning...

""Do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them (the word) under their feet, and then turn and tear YOU to pieces"" MATH 7:6

Atheists are doing just that as they attack you and mock you and curse you on almost all your uploads. Therefore I stand by the Word of Christ. He said it for a purpose.


Jesus is the WAY the TRUTH and the LIFE. 


God Bless"
,sandshreder,2010-01-06T18:28Z,"Oh by the way verifire, you say this is no place for long discussions... however I have read your banter back and forth with those who persecute you (very long I must say) yet there is no mention to them that...and I QUOTE...

 ""long discussions and arguments belong in other places than the comment-section of a torrent""..

Yet when I post a comment supporting you and your uploaded material, you miss quote me and tell me I have no business with ""long discussions"" in the comment section.

well sorry I havent done anything wrong and I will comment appropriately as I see fit.  If you dont like my comments Im sorry but I will always stand up for the Word of Christ.

Maybe you should tell the christian bashers to stop the hatred rather than attacking a Christian brother.

Again God Bless and thank you for your uploads. I enjoy them very much.

[T],verifire,2010-01-18T04:26Z,"I know, ""Sandshreder"", I know about the long discussions. I even told someone along the way to write me personally instead, but... Anyway: That's why I came to the conclusion that long discussions under comments make more harm than good.

And as to me addressing you on the subject, I stand on the same as i did when I wrote it; That it's not good. Sorry you felt trampled upon, but there was nothing going on here as to bombardment, and what you wrote about was creationism and such, and not the direct subject of this upload.

Did you read the ""while I do appreciate your thanks, Sandshreder.."" -part?

And I still feel that I must emphasize that I was once an atheist. I couldn't care less. Someone didn't mind that, and threw some pearls to this swine. The swine got saved..

Peace, mate, and thanks for standing up for me!"
[T],verifire,2010-01-18T04:35Z,"And ""Sandshreder"": The ""thread"" on ""Politically Incorrect Guide.."" is an example as to why I've come to that conclusion. Please don't take it personally. As to attacks; I try not to attack anyone, yet still I do. In this case you. I'm sorry. But ""I was once lost, but now I'm found..""

I was an atheist, drunkard, smoker, junkie.. Someone didn't mind, and threw this dog and swine some pearls of eternal truth.. It worked..

Though I resisted at first.. :-) "

,FMiguel,2011-01-02T12:06Z,"Verifire, sandshreder, For being on the same team you two argue alot. Don't get me wrong either, im Christian. It's just heartwarming that both of you are obviously passionate. Thx.   -A Semi-Lukewarm soul.
Rock ON PB!!!!"
[T],verifire,2011-02-12T12:27Z,"Well, FMiguel.. It's just a gift I have, this tendency of arguing the wrong way and in such a stupid way. I tend to come down hard on people that actually make sense and/or mean no harm and such in comments and forums.
I can't say, really, why I'm such an obvious idiot while at the same time trying really hard not to be, but there you have it..  ;-/

[This was a sort of; ""thanks for bearing with me"" -note..]"
