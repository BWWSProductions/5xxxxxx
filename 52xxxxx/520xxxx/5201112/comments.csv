,tenka73,2009-12-27T15:36Z,I am happy to hear that this game works with Vista. I hate it when old games stop working with newer OS versions.
,VashSnake,2010-01-24T22:34Z,"I'm unable to do anything with it.
When I click HalfLifeKeyGen.exe I get a window that looks like it's asking for a code, but there are already numbers in there.
When I click gENERATE! it just comes up with another list of numbers and when I try to type in other numbers for the list, nothing happens.
Help?"

There is a known bug when uninstalling the ""Sierra Utilities"" that comes with installing Half-Life!

Either update Sierra Utilities or install Half-Life in an extra SUBfolder!
Example: C:\Games\Something\Half-Life

If you have it in C:\Games\Half-Life and uninstall, everything in C:\Games will be removed!"
