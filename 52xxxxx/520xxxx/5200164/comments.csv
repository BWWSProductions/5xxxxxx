,Rayj1987,2011-05-20T11:29Z,I never knew there was a second dragonheart until now so I'm looking forward to seeing if this is as good as the first one is
,bazz991,2012-04-17T17:27Z,"Good quality a/v, movie had nice ideas but seemed poorly directed/acted/budgeted... I still watched it and kinda enjoyed though.

I probably would have appreciated it slightly more if the first one wasn't a legend and I didn't already have good expectations.

I only just found out no.2 exists.

Thanks uploader!"
