I was looking for these videos for myself and although there is already a torrent it would appear that it was never really seeded.
So I decided to rip them from the source.  :-)

I intend to do 2 things. 1) Fully seed all of these 52 vids now that I have them. 2) Learn Spanish.

Note:  These videos are direct copies of the Video on demand streams from the original website. 
Although not very high resolution, they are good quality and ideal for portable media players in whatever flavour.

This is the first time I ever seeded so I hope all goes well.

Enjoy.
