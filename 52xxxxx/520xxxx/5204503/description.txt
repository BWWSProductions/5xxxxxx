The Romford Drum & Trumpet Corps is a Brass Band local to my town (Romford in Essex, just to the east of London, England)
They have won various competitions and played at the Albert Hall in London. More info on them on their website at www.rdtc.org

Track 9, Bullseye was written by the drum section of the Corps in 2006 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Bands formation (Bullseye is a slang term for 50 - the centre, or 'bullseye', of a dartboard having a points value of 50)

Track 15, Green & Gold, was written in 2001 by the then Bandmaster of The Band of The Royal Electrical & Mechanical Engineers, WO1 Clint Bray as a tribute to the Romford Drum & Trumpet Corps founder Dick Bouchard MBE.

Track 16, Highbury Highs was written by Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who and a lifelong fan of the Arsenal football team. Roger performed it with the Romford Drum & Trumpet Corps at the closing ceremony of the last ever football match played at Arsenal's historic Highbury Stadium in May 2006 in front of 38,000 Arsenal fans on live TV. Roger also sings vocals on this recording of the piece.
