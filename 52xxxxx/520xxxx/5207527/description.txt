Miranda is a British television series written by and starring comedienne Miranda Hart. It airs on BBC Two on Mondays.

The show was picked as one of the top 10 forthcoming TV shows for Autumn 2009 by The Sunday Times, but it's very British humour that might not seem so funny outside the UK.

Miranda is desperate to fit in, but her public school background makes her a bit of a misfit down the pub and she's never quite fitted in with Sloane Ranger childhood rival Tilly (Sally Phillips) or the rest of 'the girls' (not least because she's a foot taller than them all).

Due to years of agoraphobic tendencies she can't quite grasp how to behave socially and constantly fails to avoid embarrassing situations, especially around men.

A constant disappointment to her mother Penny (Patricia Hodge), and lacking any real capacity or interest for business, Miranda employs her childhood friend Stevie (Sarah Hadland) to manage her joke shop.

It doesn't matter what Miranda attempts in life â€“ dating, joining the gym, job interviews or simply dealing with her overbearing mother â€“ she always seems to fall flat, quite literally, and is incapable of leaving a room without knocking something over.
