,PhoenixRebirthAsh,2010-03-30T12:21Z,"...as far as I can see s01 is OK ..although a little bit too large for the quality but some of the other seasons have low bit-rate in audio which makes audio bad even on headphones...

tbh this could be much better done ... smaller size better resolution 7 bit-rate ratio quality --- also it might be only 1 pass in some seasons / episodes..."
,NicklasNathan,2010-04-02T23:56Z,"I agree with Phoenix. Does anyone know of any other uploads of the entire series, in great quality? I don't really care about the size, I just want every season in great quality. Love the show and would like to download all the seasons to keep."

,DgBaStA,2010-07-01T11:20Z,"Season 2 Episodes 19 - 24 are named wrong. I found this out when looking for transcripts and since there is some continuity in the show, I thought I should let everyone know.

19 should be renamed 23 Ben Her
20         ""              ""    24 Ben Her
21         ""              ""    20 Girls, Interrupted
22         ""              ""    21 There But for the Grace of Grace
23         ""              ""    22 My Best Friends Tush
24         ""              ""    19 An Affair to Forget       "
