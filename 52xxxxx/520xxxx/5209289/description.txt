"Love Removal Machine" is a song recorded by The Cult. It was the first single to be released from the group's 1987 album Electric. First recorded during a radio session, the song was originally titled "Love Removal". A second version, with a different arrangement and newly-lengthened title, was recorded for the band's third album, Peace. When that album was scrapped, it was re-arranged a third time and recorded for the replacement album, Electric. The main guitar riff is very similar to the Rolling Stones' "Start Me Up."

An extended remix was also created and released on a 12" single. In 1998, Mike Peralia remixed the song for inclusion in the film Small Soldiers. It is featured on the soundtrack of Guitar Hero World Tour. The song was named the 74th best hard rock song of all time by VH1.

Electric is the pivotal third album by The Cult. Released in 1987, the album marked a deliberate stylistic change in the band from a goth to a hard rock group. Rick Rubin, the producer on Electric, had been specifically hired to remake the band's sound. The album was featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

The Cult are an English rock band, formed in 1983. They gained a dedicated following in Britain in the mid 1980s as a post-punk and gothic rock band with singles such as "She Sells Sanctuary", before breaking mainstream in the United States in the late 1980s as a hard rock band with singles such as "Love Removal Machine". The band fuses a "heavy metal revivalist" sound with the "pseudo-mysticism ... of The Doors, the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin, and the three-chord crunch of AC/DC, while adding touches of post-punk goth rock". Since their earliest form in Bradford during 1981, the band has had various line-ups, and the longest serving members are vocalist Ian Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy, the band's two songwriters.

After moving to London, the band released the album Love in 1985, which charted at #4 in the United Kingdom, and which included singles such as "She Sells Sanctuary" and "Rain". In the late 1980s, the band dropped their post-punk sound in favour of hard rock with their third album, Electric, and their fourth album, Sonic Temple, which enabled them to break into the North American market. By the early 1990s, the band was fraying behind the scenes, due to alcohol abuse and off-stage tensions, leading to a split-up in 1995. The band reunited in 1999 and recorded the album Beyond Good and Evil, and they reissued all of their albums in Asia and Eastern Europe in 2003 and Japan in 2004. In 2006, the band reformed again to perform a series of worldwide tours. In October 2007, the band released the album Born into This, on the Roadrunner Records label. According to a July 2009 interview with Astbury, The Cult may never release any more studio albums.
