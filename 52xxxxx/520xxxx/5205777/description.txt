    You've walked into a hedge maze!  Now you have to find all the        
    flags.                                                                
    Finding the flags faster earns more bonus points.  Here and there     
    throughout the maze you'll find items that help you, like potions,    
    a loaf of bread, or rocket-boots.  (Nothing washes down a loaf of     
    bread like a potion.  But trust me: you should wait at least 30       
    minutes before using the rocket boots.)  Beware!  There are a few     
    items that you don't want to pick up.... Features: - Mazes come in    
    six different sizes with up to nine flags. - Mazes are randomized,    
    so every game is different. - Multiple navigation options; touch      
    main maze display, movement pad, or tilt to move. - Tireless          
    animated avatar. - Only have a few minutes to play?  Small mazes      
    can be completed in a minute or two. - The biggest take several       
    hours. Your games are automatically saved so you can always take a    
    break and pick up where you left off later. With Hedge Maze Deluxe    
    you're guaranteed to get hours and hours of "hedgy" entertainment.
