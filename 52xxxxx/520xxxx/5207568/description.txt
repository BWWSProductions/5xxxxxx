Given the sub-Stones boogie of their debut, SHAKE YOUR MONEY MAKER, THE SOUTHERN HARMONY AND MUSICAL COMPANION came as a quietly accomplished body of work, apparently way beyond their relative youth and experience. The EXILE ON MAIN STREET references were still intact, but the predominant swagger and sashay had been abandoned in favour of a soulful interpretation of their roots, rather than a parody of their influences. Chris Robinson's Jagger pastiche was replaced by a more gutsy, honest strut, while brother Rich plays with an aplomb and spirit that struck darkly at the heart of their songs. A very grown-up record indeed.
All tracks have been digitally remastered.
Recorded at Southern Tracks, Atlanta, Georgia.
The Black Crowes: Chris Robinson (vocals, harmonica, percussion); Rich Robinson, Marc Ford (guitar); Ed Harsch (piano, Hammond B-3 organ); Johnny Colt (bass); Steve Gorman (drums).
Additional personnel: Chris Trujillo (congas); Barbara, Taj (background vocals).Rolling Stone (6/25/92, p.40) - 3.5 Stars - Very Good - "...nine new songs written by the Robinson brothers, filled with arresting chord changes, dynamic tempo shifts, snatches of feedback and other throwaway delights and just enough good lyrics to keep your ears tuned in..."
Entertainment Weekly (5/22/92, p.72) - "...a frisky, straight-ahead rock & roll positivism that runs so contrary to nearly everything else in the present singer-guitar-drums category that you can't help but like them..."
- Rating: B+
Q (1/93, p.70) - Included in Q's list of the 50 Best Albums Of 1992.
Musician (8/92, p.89) - "...a simple, gut-busting pleasure....a hot and nasty collection of songs striking in their production and arrangement....one kickass album..."
Village Voice (3/2/93, p.5) - Ranked #37 in the Village Voice's list of the 40 Best Albums Of 1992.
