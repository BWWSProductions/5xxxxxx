 When semiprofessional piano player Nate Holden (Alec    
 Newman) discovers that the lovely coat check girl at a  
 nearby jazz club (Amy Adams) has the voice of an angel, 
 he persuades her to form a musical act with him. As the 
 pair's melodic collaboration at the nightclub starts to 
 gain attention, their professional relationship takes a 
 turn toward the personal. This musical from director    
 Giancarlo Tallarico co-stars Moon Bloodgood.
