There were two hot properties that really define the '80s for many people, including myself: the rise of the direct-to-video market and aerobics.

Killer Workout begins with the tanning bed burning of some poor young lady we learn later to be the twin sister of Rhonda, owner of Rhonda's Gym. Unfortunately for Rhonda, a new series of grisly deaths start happening at her establishment, many through the use of a giant safety pin, no joke. Weird thing though, no one seems to really notice or care. I mean, wouldn't the cops be all over this place, closing it down to look for evidence, interview people and try to solve the crimes? Or even, wouldn't you want to avoid working out on a machine someone was killed on? But no, the gym stays open, people work out, and one cop asks around every now and then. I guess to be fair, no one really notices the killings, so how can you freak out about a crime you don't know exists, right? People are just missing until one unfortunate, vibrant young employee is being chased and finds bodies in rather open environments. I guess we don't watch these movies for their logic...................
