Perhaps the most appallingly cheesy and overacted example of the entire genre of gross 1980s miniseries, this eminently forgettable flick features the standard overwrought script and star-studded cast. Not surprisingly, the only ones who seem to like it (apart from the castâ€™s mothers) are very religious Christians. To them, no respectful dramatization of biblical themes is ever called to task for being bad theater. You have the holy trinity of such fare here: Biblical, Bland, and Boring. You could also add an apocryphal alliteration of being broadly badly written, badly directed, and badly acted. Begorrah!

The rights to the series have been purchased by an umbrella Christian organization, and they have done a cheap job of encoding it for release on DVD. This means it could not be neatly ripped into episodes, that the sound sync is a hair off, and that there are no subtitles. They have also included a PDF study Guide on how your church group can use the film to teach. So, if youâ€™d like to see a historically shaky film on how Christianity became the dominant religion of Ancient Rome, here ya go.
