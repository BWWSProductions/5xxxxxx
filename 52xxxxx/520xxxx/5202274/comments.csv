However, as far as I know only two solid attempts at making films from the books that Luke wrote concerning the life and times of the early church and Paul. Two, and this one is far better, because it back stories the life of two families. The other miniseries out by The Visual Bible says they word for word dramatize the book of Acts and Matthew. 
I think A.D. is far and away better, remembering this is a 1985 miniseries. If you go back and watch Shogun or any of those classic mini TV show movies, they all are a little different than the way I remember them...a little dated.
If anyone has a foreign language copy of this A.D.,with foreign subtitles please post a note. I'd like to make an english subbed version of this."
