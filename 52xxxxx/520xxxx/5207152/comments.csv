,odohvare,2009-12-12T01:01Z,"This is broken.  I have tried mounting the ISO in PowerISO, and burning the ISO.  Setup starts, I go through the first couple of steps, and after choosing the installation type(Recommended, custom, etc) it throws up an error telling me to insert the Adobe Photoshop CS4 Disk into the drive and halts the installation.  The same problems happens both ways, burned to disc or mounted as a virtual drive."
,ericjack,2009-12-12T01:42Z,Is anyone else having the same problem as odohvare is having? I used UltraISO 9 to make the image. I am able to mount my image just fine using Daemon Tools Lite 4.30.4.0027 send me an email to the address listed in the description of the torrent if you are having the same problem
,ericjack,2009-12-12T05:43Z,"Im not sure what happned... odohvare, you are right. for some reason the iso i made isnt working, i'll remove this torrent and post a new one that i will test before posting im sorry about the bad file :("
,ericjack,2009-12-12T06:15Z,ok looks like all you have to do is take the files out of the iso and put them in a folder on your computer some where and run it from there... for some reason it doesn't like to be run from a disc :(
,amphigory2e,2009-12-31T19:58Z,the above commenter is right. just unzip the files and run the install that way-- don't try to mount the file.
,XxNoOneSpecialxX,2010-01-02T23:41Z,It works you just have to run it off your computer so don't mount it or anything.
,greg862,2010-01-06T00:50Z,"Your README.TXT doesn't say that you have to change the PROPERTIES of the ""HOSTS"" file because it's a READ ONLY file. But you did mention returning it to READ ONLY status at the end, so I figured it out for myself when I was at first unable to save the changes I had made. Seems to be working 100%...I've closed and reopened it without issue. I also disabled the PLUG-IN ability to contact the internet. EDIT/PREFERENCES/PLUG-INS. Good seed...thank you...the only one I've managed to make work...and I've tried many, each time, doing a RESTORE to a previous state, just in case. THANKS...I'll help seed this one!"
,0Grav,2010-01-07T04:35Z,"Hi All,
Im trying to install this on Win 7 Pro machine, I did the other comments said and unzipped it right to my drive...but when I run the setup file, and after it checks the""System Profile"" it pops up an error that reads "" SYSTEM CHECK Critical errors were found in setup for Adobe Photoshop CS4: Session has dependencies that cannot be satisfied.
The installer database is invalid: please re-install the product from the original media

Please see the setup log file for details. Click Quit to exit Setup.""

I am new to Windows 7 coming from XP so I dont know if this might be a permissions problem or something else....I am running it from my Main and Only unpassworded system profile, and it is the administrator account.
Any help with this would be apreciated!"
,0Grav,2010-01-07T05:08Z,"I forgot to mention I am running the 64 bit version of Win 7 pro, is this version of Photoshop compatable with 64 bit op sys?...That is actually why I am upgrading to CS4....I get a Error ""This version not compatable"" with my CS3 version of photoshop."

,Squilbo,2011-08-15T06:23Z,"I'm giving up on photoshop.  Every time I try to open a file, it crashes.  It did that on cs5 too.  I could get cs3 again, but why bother with that when gimp is probably better?"
