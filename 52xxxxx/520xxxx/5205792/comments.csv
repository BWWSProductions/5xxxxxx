,Hakan_A,2009-12-10T17:51Z,"Je moet nog wel soft reset uit zetten.
Daarom zal het waarschijnlijk bij de meeste niet werken.

Disable soft reset!"
,Jpeg069,2009-12-10T21:40Z,"Yes, you may have to tap on the green ""R"" in the upper right corner before loading the rom (if using the R4).  Make sure this ""R"" is RED before loading."
,phosfor,2009-12-12T18:02Z,After I get the first stone and the spirit Train I get full white screens and the game freezes on my R4 (already set the R to red otherwise it won't even start). Does anybody else know about this error?

,mxstyle,2009-12-20T16:24Z,"works, but can't load save data. apparently it doesn.t recognize it. 
Im using cyclo ds v1.55"
,tuonier,2009-12-20T21:49Z,"It works, train controls and save function
I'm using cyclo ds with  1.56-BETA_5 firmware.
I'm not sure but you might need to use stealth mode (press start while starting game)
thanks! anyway"
,mxstyle,2009-12-21T11:24Z,"@tuonier.

im trying v1,56 Beta 5 now... it works, until the forest realm that is. In the forest there's no train controls.

,tazzzje,2009-12-21T14:09Z,"I'm stuck at the Snow Sanctuary i go into the tunnel and black screen and it doesn't work anymore
i have a r4 sdhc revolution for ds"
,tuonier,2009-12-21T18:56Z,"@mxstyle

That's weird my girlfriend got a lot further with train controls and everything
did you start the game using stealth mode?
pressing start while starting the game?

goodluck"
,Zpik3,2009-12-22T15:26Z,"I'm running this rom together with CycloDS-card and firmware 1.55 off the official site. It works like a charm. The only problem is the saves, you cannot save the normal way. But if you have a Cyclo card then just use the RTS save states. That still works. Just hold select the first timeyou start the game and cyclo will create a save file. TO save you just hit ABstartselectrightleft at the same time and it will take you to the menu where you can save and load.

Thanks 2 Lions! Great work! =)"
,mxstyle,2009-12-22T16:06Z,"damm i feel like a retard. Anyways, there are no train contols (gearbox), in forest realm...this is normal! I thought i should stop near the tree branches to hear the directions lolz.

Thnx uploader!"
,tienou98,2009-12-27T14:02Z,Works fine Dsi + R4i
,nicolem20,2010-01-01T23:18Z,"HOW TO GET THE GAME SAVING:
1) Open the game first on your PC with DS emulator e.g. DeSmuME
2) create a save file with the desired character name
3) go to file -> export and save the file (e.g. zelda.sav)
4) transfer the save file to your memory card (same folder as the game, and make sure it has the same name as your NDS file. E.g. if your game file is named ""The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks.nds"" the save file must be named ""The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks.sav""
5) boot your DS and enjoy :-)

I'm using EDGE card on DSlite and it works so far like a charm..

Why this was happening - it seems the edge card was creating a save file in size of 512KB, while it actually needs a bigger save file 980KB."
,mariajuliette,2010-01-08T14:38Z,"works fine on my r4 card,, cheers !!"
,Crusader66,2010-01-23T08:26Z,Aside from the splash screen it seems to have all the problems fixed. I'm past the train anyway.
