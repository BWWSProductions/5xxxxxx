Audio 5/10

Audio sounds a little ""Echoey"", kind of like it was filmed in a tunnel... but still not bad. Very listenable.

Video has a little bit of a flicker - worse in some scenes than in others... Similar flicker you see in a video camera when you point it at a picture tube TV.

Overall very watchable for the average person - maybe not for the real picky. If you've been waiting for this for a while like I have, you'll be able to watch it. Enjoy - thanks uploader!"
