        VariCAD is a 3D/2D CAD system for mechanical              
    engineering. In addition to standard tools for 3D        
      modeling and 2D drafting, the CAD system provides         
      tools for sheet metal unbending and crash tests,          
    libraries of standard mechanical parts (ANSI, DIN) and     
    symbols, mechanical part calculations and tools for      
   working with bills of materials (BOMs) and title            
    blocks. VariCAD supports STEP, STL, IGES, DWG and DXF        
        file formats.                                             
                                                             
      The comprehensive CAD software enables designers to       
      quickly create, evaluate, and modify their models. It
