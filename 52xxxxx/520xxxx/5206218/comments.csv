,Yuji1Saeki,2009-12-20T13:54Z,"Its an epic-fail AutoIt-packed executable that has a real tPoRt StyleBuilder 2.0.21 patch AND A C#/VB.Net keylogger, poorly coded too. Creates in the same directory ""Lolled.exe"" (fail). Just end the process and del ""Lolled.exe"". Fuck off black-hats/skiddie-crackers."
,Yuji1Saeki,2009-12-20T13:55Z,"To add onto my previous comment, ""LethalKeyloggerStubFREE.exe"" is the original assembly name. Coded in VB.Net by some poor retard. Now I feel bad, he was a retarded skiddie. >.> Damn conscience."
,Yuji1Saeki,2009-12-20T14:03Z,"Forgot to mention it creates a run entry under HKCU \ Software \ Microsoft \ Windows \ CurrentVersion \ Run and e-mails with subject ""Lethal Keylogs"" using SMTP server ""smtp.gmail.com"" on port 587. Pretty shitty cryptology for the stored password and account name."
