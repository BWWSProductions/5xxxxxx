,Charlie117,2009-12-09T22:14Z,"do i need to install a previous patch before this one?
works with skidrow?
thanks"
,FTL3,2009-12-09T22:28Z,1.02 can patch from any version. works with skidrow
,Grohl,2009-12-10T16:35Z,"This is really just  a crack and a text file with a link to the official patch, plus Folding@home for some reason."
,calvn,2009-12-12T03:50Z,"for some reason the crack doesn't work for me. i get an error message saying the side by side configuration is incorrect when i try to launch the game.

the patch itself seems to have installed correctly.

any ideas?

thanks."
,calvn,2009-12-12T04:09Z,"i take that back. for some really odd reason the patch didn't install properly first time round so obviously the crack didn't work. however the old one still did.

re-installed the patch and the crack now works.

cheers."
,Sirius90,2009-12-12T13:20Z,"uhm, the ""patch"" from the fileshack site was just a ""02[2]-file"" a.k.a unknown file to my pc. Where do i put this (if it's correct)?
Shouldn't be an .exe file?"
,inVINCEab13,2009-12-13T15:00Z,"I have the same problem as Sirius 90 above. I extract from this file and get 3 new folders named  $[33],  $_OUTDIR, and $PLUGINSDIR. 
  I'm not sure how to install this patch, could someone give a quick set of instructions of what to do with the downloaded file DragonAge1.02[1] please and thankyou?"
,Saturdae,2009-12-13T19:57Z,I downloaded this and then downloaded the patch from their site.  I am thinking I missed a step from overwriting the game files with the crack files and I don't know how to do that.  When I try to run the crack i get the error message...>failed to start because fmod_event.dll was not found.  Probably going to start over again but can someone give me some guidance.
,cecil772,2009-12-16T02:28Z,When i try to open the daorigins.exe i get an error message.. i have mounted the iso and everything. can someone please explain what do to from the beginning.. 
,theShoal,2009-12-16T20:48Z,"could someone explain this process to me please? 

The instructions say to install game and patch, then to write cracked files. I can't install the game or patch, because i dont have a key, and i cant run the daorigins.exe because fmod_dll is missing. Help?"
,rpgomg,2009-12-17T11:50Z,"To use the crack:

The crack is ""daorigins"".

Wherever you installed the game, open the folder, ""Dragon Age"". Open the folder ""bin_ship"". Replace the file ""daorigins"" with the crack file ""daorigins"". Enjoy.

If you don't have a key, download a keygen. It should work just fine."

,Lortex91,2009-12-27T15:23Z,"I did what rpgomg said but it just come error when i want to start the game, please help?"
,juniorain,2009-12-28T18:25Z,Gave me some ki8nd of side by side configuration error or something like that. I tried other cracks with no success. Is there a way to uninstall this?
,xellb14,2009-12-30T14:37Z,what the fuck is this idiotic FAH doing in the archive?
,Tideo,2010-01-02T07:52Z,Worked fine after i realized i was supposed to put the .exe into the bin folder thing XD(no im not stupid >_> )
,Svaargod,2010-01-13T16:21Z,"It's working! I'm seeding ,thank you !"
,wantmoerice,2010-01-17T11:14Z,"for some reason i got the same problem as ""calvn"" but when i try to reinstall the official patch it keeps saying it cant find dragon age origins and tells me to install the game...wtf i have the cracked version replaced with my old exe already...thiisss isss pisssiinnng meee offfff"
,Dredin,2010-02-03T03:43Z,"Hey, wantmoerice, I was having the same problem. Just move the crack file from the download into the .bin_ship folder and then run the patch and it should work :-)"
,Dredin,2010-02-03T03:47Z,"I'm sorry for the double post, but I am having a problem. I've ran it all according to the instructions, placed the crack in the proper folder, and when I attempt to run the program it gives me the following error:

""The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log for more detail.""

I do not know where to find the event log. But, I try to reinstall the patch to no avail. It gives the same error when I run from my new launcher.

Any help would be appreciated -- thanks!

,saintof420,2010-02-07T19:01Z,"I have SOLVED the issue with the side by side configuration.
It sounds strange, but, DONT COPY OVER THE CRACK.
If you have the original install for Dragon Age, if you have copied over the crack, copy back over the original daorigins from your original copy you torrented. 
Done."
,rapsodiaverde,2010-02-13T19:06Z,WORKS PERFECT. THANKS!
,d8vs4,2010-02-24T20:25Z,"I downloaded the Skidrow no RAR version of the game, installed, CD key, patch 1.02, and then have tried several of these cracks, getting the error message:

The application has failed because the side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log for more details.

I get this same error message with several versions of the crack that I've tried.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated."
[T],dramacore,2010-02-27T01:50Z,"worked great, thanks!"
,Gorvz,2010-03-02T08:39Z,This torrent is HOT!!! FTL3 Ur D MaNNN!!!
,Syteri,2010-03-10T16:44Z,"Question, do I need to update to patch 1.01b first or can I update straight to 1.02? Will this also work with the Skidrow Release?"
,MasterCronodox,2010-03-11T07:30Z,does it work
,darklordofspawn,2010-03-28T05:06Z,thank you
,LordChen,2010-06-15T10:57Z,"For those of you who have tried to patch over a previously cracked version of the game:

Most of the games you ever try to update will give you an error messages upon attempting so. 

You must use the original files, update and then copy over a corresponding crack."
