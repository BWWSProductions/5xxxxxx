all parts are *.iso and the files in all parts are similar and of same size. it is as if all parts are identical.
Also the individual Iso files are not bootable. 
somebody please tell me how to go about reconstructing the original vista cd from these parts."
,Wous112,2009-12-17T14:25Z,real easy just extract 1 part and the rest will extract to 1 ***.iso file ;)
,ramon06111978,2009-12-20T04:13Z,"Hey thanks for replying but i still dont get it.
when i extract the 1st file it is extracted as a windows vista.iso the second one extracted to same location asks to replace the preivious iso. when you say yes to replace it actually replaces the earlier iso. please elaborate if you can"
