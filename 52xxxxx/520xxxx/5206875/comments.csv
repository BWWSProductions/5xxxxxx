,blackestsheep,2012-03-02T01:35Z,"OK as a regular devoted  metalhead i was listening to decapiataed  and reading up on them on wikipedia as your probably doing right now, then i found out the founding member of decapiated has a side project lux occulta
now not thinking anyone else would be interested in listening to them, i doubted any post would be here..but damn i was wrong..theres some true fans out there
