,Kenste,2009-12-08T02:03Z,"If you are banned from Xbox Live, download and install the free software XLink Kai on your pc and you can play online for free with all games that have the ""System link"" option. About 50 xbox 360 games have that, for example mw2, Forza 2, GoW."
,CivicScootin,2009-12-08T02:55Z,"lol, ya I was banned as well on one of my other 360's (good thing for backups).. 

Kai is a good program as well however there trully isent all that many users on there plus you must have a 30ms PING or less for the program to work well with any system..

Ya'll are very welcome for the app.. Ive had it for a while and was surprised that no one had posted a torrent of it..

Happy you all are enjoying it..

,ankit1991_007,2009-12-08T16:04Z,my console is banned how can i play online with this software with the games which are having system link option
,CivicScootin,2009-12-08T17:54Z,"This torrent is not made for playing any games..

What this torrent includes is a messenger only that will let you chat with user that are on LIVE from your PC (the same can be done from M$ main site as well but this is far more easyer)..

............................

If you want to play any games from system link from a banned system-your going to need a program called ""Xlink Kai""

The main site for that app can be found here:
http://www.teamxlink.co.uk/

............................

Remember this torrent that includes XBLFriends is for chatting only and not for playing any games on..
