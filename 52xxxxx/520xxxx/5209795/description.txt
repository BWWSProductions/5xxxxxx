Teach Yourself Beginnerâ€™s Dutch is the right course for you if you really want to learn Dutch but are daunted by the prospect of complicated grammar, classes and coursebooks. This book starts right from the beginning and explains everything in simple English. There are hints throughout to make learning easy and you can learn at your own pace with plenty of practice of each new point. It is a friendly introduction to the language which will help you to understand and speak Dutch sufficiently well to function effectively in basic everyday situations, both social and business. The course will also offer you an insight into Dutch culture.

The book consists of 14 graded units and a special section on pronunciation and spelling. New language is introduced through short dialogues and texts which are also on the accompanying recording. Two accompanying cassettes are available separately or in a pack with the book.
