,fullhouse251,2009-12-09T17:26Z,It's a book of less than 400 pages.  And should be less than 40MB in pdf.   What's inside this zip actually?
,MyDickIsSoBig,2009-12-10T03:54Z,It has high-quality photos of the pages. 
,parkchester,2010-01-05T04:25Z,Complete waste of bandwidth. Get a pdf instead. DO NOT bother downloading this mess.
,Shadowym,2012-03-01T23:33Z,"Is this some joke?  The download contains a bunch of camera photos of each of the books pages.  I kid you not.  Not sure if all the pages are there but the pictures are not even close enough or good enough quality to try read the book without straining your eyes....lol.

You would think if someone was to go to all this trouble why not just use a $50 scanner which can do 100 times better job."
