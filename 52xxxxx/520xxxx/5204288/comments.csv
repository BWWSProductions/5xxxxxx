Is my system having a conflict or are others having this problem?"
,Zryo,2009-12-16T12:41Z,"Anyone? Is this working for you straight up or are you doing something special? 

My PC can run games like the sims 3 so I am sure it's not that kind of an issue. 

With 245 seeds I can't imagine that this is just a bad version of the game..."
,Duwan,2009-12-16T15:22Z,"You have some kind of problem on your end, had no complaints from others, everything is working fine.
"
,Zryo,2009-12-17T01:25Z,"Duwan: That much I have gathered since there are 208 seeders it's obviously working well for and I am grateful for your upload. However, I am asking if anyone has any suggestions? This is the only version that is going around right now that I can find. I have never had a problem playing hacked games from reflexive/bigfish etc... before. What's the most common cause for the ""crash on launch"" problem if there is one?"
,Bengonga,2009-12-18T06:41Z,"try one thing,download the game from Reflexive arcade(the trial)and download the FFF keygen for Reflexive arcade..read the instruction and then,well... it worked for  me that way."
,Duwan,2009-12-18T15:58Z,Try running in compatibility mode for XP SP2.
,Zryo,2009-12-24T16:18Z,I never figured out what was wrong on my end. I ended up reformating last night though for several reasons and the game is running fine. thanks very much for your help.
,mifuninfla,2010-01-07T09:21Z,"Duwan - ty for the torrent.

Zryo - It's not just you - I have the same problem not just with this torrent but when I dl directly from yahoo games.  I don't know what the problem is but I still think it's safe to assume it's our problem - not the torrent.  Message reads - hardware failed to switch to the specified mode.  "

,critters30,2011-02-23T03:06Z,"I was able to install and play fine, problem is, it is the 1.002 version. With 1.002 you will be lucky if you ever get to finish the game due to a known bug which causes the game not to continue once you beat the volcano level. They now have build 1.004 which fixes this issue, but no one seems to have it available in a pirated form.......so in other words, just buy the game for 5 bucks from Sandlots site and don't waste your time on this download."
