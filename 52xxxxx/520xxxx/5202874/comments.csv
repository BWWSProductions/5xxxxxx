,indie69,2009-12-08T18:30Z,"I just noticed that has to be both the ugliest and cutest cover of all time.

Thanks to the huge numbers of seeders! Look at those speeds! I'm not used to seeing that."

Wow, lot's of seeders this time. Looks like someone is understanding the picture :P

And thanks vaaikie, didn't see you there before. You have a great 2010, too."
,indie69,2009-12-09T17:03Z,Wish I'd better represented The Bear Quartet. Great new album by a great band that is seriously under-appreciated.

,indie69,2009-12-21T16:27Z,Thanks Doc! I think 2010 is going to make 1977 look like 1958.

,prepp_01,2010-04-10T20:50Z,"Oh yeah! ThatÂ´s the way Indie69, really good choises of mixed GOOD tracks. Gonna seed this one for a while. People need to get this fast, and iÂ´ll help them...(100/100 mb)"
,indie69,2010-05-02T10:30Z,"That's what I like to hear, Prep_01 !
Thanks for the great seed. I'm still on this one, too since the demand never seems to slow for it."
,TheBlackRider,2010-09-11T03:44Z,"Yea, I discovered a few gems in here. The other 80% is mostly unlistenable though. Just noodly, half-hearted derivative rich-kid stuff. But, can't complain too much . . . As for 2010 being a ""great"" year of music, I have to take issue with that. I think it was the pits. Compared to 2007 for instance. 2008 was lax as well. It's this oppressive machine.
