This is what I consider to be the best 100 tracks of 2009. Your lists will be very
different in many cases. And I know within MINUTES of upping this, I will be kicking
myself for leaving something I loved out. But you sometimes just have to let go and
let it be.

Enjoy and hope with me that 2010 will be an even better year for new music.
