British Isles: A Natural History (2004) - Smelly-Cat 

With characteristic passion and enthusiasm, Alan Titchmarsh takes an incredible voyage of discovery - from the frozen summit of Ben Nevis to the white sands of the temperate Scilly Isles, and from the rain-drenched tip of western Ireland to the dry expanses of East Anglia.
To reveal the secrets hidden in the landscape, Alan descends a Yorkshire waterfall twice as high as Niagara Falls, climbs one of the highest mountains in Scotland and goes foraging with red squirrels in Formby. He travels back in time to find hippos roaming through Trafalgar Square, an immense forest that spreads from Land's End to John O'Groats, and prehistoric reptiles swimming in Britain's tropical seas.
In an inspiring and compelling series, Alan shoes how the British landscape and wildlife have evolved through dramatic geological, climatic and human change, but he also examines the state of the land today and investigates the fresh challenges and responsibilities we face in a future that promises as many spectacular transformations as in the past. 
Presented by Alan Titchmarsch, this DVD peels back the years and takes us on a remarkable journey through history. Far from the climate we know today, 'British Isles - A Natural History' reveals the swamps, rainforests, ice ages and volcanos, alongside the civilisations and revolutions that shaped the familiar face of the British Isles.
