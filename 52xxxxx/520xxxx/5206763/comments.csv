,FRivera,2010-05-13T09:24Z,hey can anybody confirm whether there's foreign subs here or not?
,thejonguy,2010-06-03T14:38Z,yes i can confirm it has foreign subs hard coded in this one and because of this i will not seed it. why oh why do some idiots do that? it really ruins it for those who dont need them. its not exactly difficult to encode them seperately like most torrents have..
,daveo76,2010-06-07T16:07Z,I agree why those idiots got to do that for. I been looking all over the net for this movie as I can't rent or buy it in australia. All the search says it got Swedish hard-coded subtitles on it.  
,thebreaklook,2010-09-30T04:43Z,i think this is the 1994 movie -.- idiots
