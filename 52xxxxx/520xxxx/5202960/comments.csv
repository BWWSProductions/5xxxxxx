,Riddle0,2009-12-11T20:37Z,"Hi
I am from russia
I love this game, but I can`t download it
Please, give SPEED!!!"
,trace98,2009-12-13T23:39Z,what do you mean mount with toast? an app? or a utility? or how do i get it to see a disc?
,kikobarracuda,2009-12-17T21:41Z,Toast Titanium - it's a burning-cd software for mac os X. Install it and then drag the .dmg file you have downloaded with this torrent to the Toast Window and click Mount. Voilรก 
,myvxael,2010-01-12T03:25Z,I have installed halo then mounted the .dmg file but when i click on the disk it just comes up with the pkg file and the three other things not the game. What have i done wrong???
,M-79,2010-01-23T09:29Z,"The disk mounting is not essential just download & install from here:

http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/13886

This negates the necessity for inserting a disk to play.

The catch is that most if not of the Serial/CD keys you will find are either banned or non-functional on Halo Multiplayer & Microsoft/Macsoft doesn't sell this game anymore therefore it now is almost as rare as a Van Gogh and has driven a legit used copy into the $80-120 range. 

Sucks for us, ironic that this game was originally designed as a Mac port in 2000 before M$ bought out Bungie. 

Only economic option: Buy/Scounge Halo for PC cheap, install Windows via Bootcamp or Crossover. But hey, you can still use at least one one of these SN's for Campaign play! :)"
,blamotoys2,2010-02-10T08:22Z,"im looking for the original release of halo mac, not combat evolved. is this one?"
,palap980,2010-02-15T20:34Z,"Blamotoys2: The first halo game was called ""Halo: Combat Evolved"", there is no such thing as just Halo."

,pushpop84,2010-11-14T04:23Z,"Ummmm guys, go to apple.com and download the halo updater, search halo updater, and then it will be a get out of jail free card for the cd. you still need the serials, but that is already given in the description. Hope this works!"
,JayArgo,2010-11-14T21:35Z,Works great once you install the patcher/updater. Brilliant! :)

,Swiftwinter,2010-12-19T00:22Z,"Whenever I try and create or join an online match, this thing pops up that says ""Your CD key is invalid."" What gives? I wanna play multiplayer!"
,_pieterro,2011-03-12T00:03Z,"hi, when i try to start halo my mac asks the producht key i already tried (ZAXG-FAJM-YEU5-UW29) or (LYXH-RVWA-VND3-4HDS) but it won't work. what should i do?"
,Duardo,2011-03-17T06:07Z,the problem you all are having is that you havent installed the update google Halo Mac Patch and it essentially makes the game free
,PowerWheel6,2011-05-03T22:44Z,I cannot locate Halo Universal. It's on my hard disk but I cannot access it.
,MR.NieNie,2011-05-05T19:26Z,before you update to 2.4 use KCNScrew to het the serials
