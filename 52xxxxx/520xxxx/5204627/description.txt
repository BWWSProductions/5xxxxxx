Remote Desktop Control 
** Work on a remote computer, as if you were sitting in front of it. ** 

 

Remote Desktop Control displays the screen of another computer (via Internet or 

network) on your own screen. The program allows you to use your mouse and keyboard 

to control the other computer remotely. It means that you can work on a remote 

computer, as if you were sitting in front of it. 

Remote Desktop Control is comfortable for any kind of user. Even a "newbie" will 

easily understand basic tasks. Gurus will find many powerful features, such as 

view only mode or remote system shutdown. The main design consideration of Remote 

Desktop Control is "as easy as possible for the user". 

Remote Desktop Control is so fast and comfortable that you might even forget that 

you are working on a remote computer! The program allows you to work with 

different remote computers simultaneously, from anywhere in the world. 


Enjoy :)
