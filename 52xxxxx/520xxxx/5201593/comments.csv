There is no 100% seeders, so people downloading need you to keep seeding this oneÂ´a bit more please.

A tip until next time you upload a torrent:
use smaller block pieces than 1.00MB preferably 256kB or at least 512kB to speed up the distribution,
since then can people with small bandwidth also quicker contribute during distribution.
And like me not having a small bandwidth, I can quicker get to 100% and help seeding with my large broadband.

Torrents with smaller block pieces usually spread more quickly.

Thank's in advance!"

,Juggalo559M,2009-12-09T23:34Z,Don't Download! The Movie Quality is Great! but the Audio has a high pitch noise through the whole movie and has an Echo through the whole thing aswell! might just be me but i wasted my time! when i could of found a better copy which at these days it hard to find with people trying to be funny and uploading movies that have such bad audio! they should be banned if they are doing it on purpose! once is reasonable but after one time they should be banned!
,XoLWoX,2009-12-10T00:22Z,dude stfu and stop complaining your getting the movies for free if you dont like the quality of the sound that all that needs to be said nothing more nothing less
[V],neon,2009-12-11T03:04Z,XoLWoX that guy has put the same comment on lots of uploaders torrents of this movie
,bonghammer,2009-12-25T15:58Z,"Weird high pitched tone above the audio, really distracting. The rest of the uadio is a little tinny. Not unwatcheable but this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5204437/The.Box.2009.PROPER.R5.LiNE.XviD-iLG is better sound-wise."
