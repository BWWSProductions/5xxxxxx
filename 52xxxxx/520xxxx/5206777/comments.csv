ATTENTION, if you have the pirated/cracked version of Red Alert 3, do not install any patches past 1.01

They are useless without the internet..."

Asshole!!"
,twwig,2011-03-15T00:43Z,"ATTENTION EVERYONE!

This asshole, FTL3 has lied, this upload is fake, and has a virus.
Norton internet security 2010 detected a virus in this, and everyone should stop seeding."

,skylar15,2011-12-21T00:39Z,"Scanned it with Avast Anti Virus, no virus was detected, I did not scan the crack yet however."
,evilguy352,2012-07-12T04:39Z,you people amaze me with your retardedness. the crack itself is virus ( a safe one) it causes information that is not authentic to the data itself to pass through its protection so you can play the fucking game.
