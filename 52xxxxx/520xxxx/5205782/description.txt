    The winter is coming. Crazy hamster forgot to store his supplies.     
    Now he has to visit different lands before winter to find food.       
    Hamster is so crazy that he sees nothing but fruits. The lands he     
    visits are full of traps and obstacles he won't even notice. You      
    have to help him and neutralize those traps. There's no time to       
    loose, the hamster has already set off! Control the world Hamster     
    lives in by building bridges, extinguishing fire or putting a         
    ladder. Change the land's slant to accelerate Hamster's speed.
