        WHY REPACK?

        SORRY but seems like the rar was broken during the "movements" :)
        here is a repack. BUT you can still unpack the other if you use
        "KEEP BROKEN FILES" in winrar the img is intact. But we did this 
        repack any way. So no one comes and complain later :)

    | OBSiDiAN did a fine job getting this movie out, and their nfo      |

    | states that all nordic sub's was kept, however 2 other languages   |

    | besides english was kept, and some extras aswell, this causing a   |

    | pretty low bitrate, for such an action-packed movie.               |

    | Therefor we decided to do this as an INTERNAL release in fear or   |

    | getting flamed all over :p                                         |

    | We took out some crappy extras, and of course those other shitty   |
