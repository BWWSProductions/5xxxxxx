And to anyone who says you can't have a virus in a video file, You're an idiot. Viruses don't have to be executable files. some execute automatically when certain files are opened.

Thanks for the Torrent"

,RubberJohnny,2012-07-18T07:05Z,"This movie is based on the creator of this stories real life experience. James O'Barr. His fiancee was raped and murdered by an inebriated alcoholic. On the wikipedia it says his fiancee was killed by a drunk driver but it's false and the source is a dead link. He wrote what happened on one of the sleeves of the graphic novel. He later joined the Marines and eventually wrote the graphic novel ""The Crow"" Which is what happened. He wrote it to liberate his guilt of not being able to help who he loved dearest.

This is Brandon Lee's last and best performance.  Cult classic and a respectable film. "
