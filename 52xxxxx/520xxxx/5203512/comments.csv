sir but 1 request can u plz plz add a sample in which d sound can be judged .."
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-08T15:11Z,"Torrent is already done i.e. is here. I have to stop including samples and ifo because such torrents have been targets for abusive use:
 - simply. if one omits downloading JUST ifo or the sample - he never get reported as ""download finished"" to my server or tracker-server. Such behavior is non-tolerable since my True Blood season pack when 94 people have performed such ""trick"" (I restrain myself from cursing, sometimes).

THIS specific torrent was kind of response to one discussion and not putting [REQ] (request) tag allows all interested to download this movie with usual ""by request"" restrains.

So, sample CANNOT be included in one upped torrent, and concerning sound - it was discussion issue yesterday - it is - decent, maybe 7.5. If my word means something to you (and we know each-other for some time) it is just like I said, decent 7.5 by my standards."
,Critic_101,2009-12-08T15:59Z,"Would like to say that if u consider urself a quality ripper and a seeder who shares quality torrents pls be kind enough to let the the downloader know if the torrent ur sharing is complete or not, coz ur last two torrents i downloaded were not one was extract it did not have complete end credits and there was important plot detail shown in the end credits which was missing from ur torrent and the other one was the box it does not have end credits either as if incomplete suddenly cuts off for extract i then downloaded HR's torrent which was complete. If u give a description its upto the downloader if he wants to download or not coz if i new i would not have downloaded it! Besides that on a lighter note the quality of ur rips for its size are pretty good and even less to or no pixelation when watching black or dark scenes, while i watched the same rip slightly bigger size in file from HR pixelation was visible talking about extract right in the begining when the credits are shown. thanx for uploading but does not the downloader have the right to know if what he is downloading is complete or not!?"
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-08T16:03Z,"Take cold shower Critic.
htctouch have asked and I have answered."
,Critic_101,2009-12-08T16:16Z,he asked abt sample 20 not abt giving description sorry did not mean to upset u just asking 2 mention if complete rip or incomplete thanx 
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-08T16:56Z,"And I answered ""Torrent is already done i.e. is here. I have to stop including samples...""

BTW, read however you like, but I gave answer AND even explained why.

Your ""coz ur last two torrents i downloaded were not one was extract it did not have complete end credits and there was important plot detail shown in the end credits which was missing from ur torrent"" is insinuative, a insult, not just to me, but for the people who try their best communicating in English.

That's why I still think that you need internal and external cooling. "

,sassymoon,2009-12-09T04:02Z,"hi twenty, any chance of upping castle? thank you "
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-09T06:02Z,"@sassymoon: Castle was ready 12 hours ago, but this delayed upping.  56 downloads for such trouble and - 34 Hit&Runs, people who got what they need and haven't shared more than few bytes.
Such shame and such waste...
Castle will be upped today, for sure."
,valu59er,2009-12-09T08:24Z,"Hey 20 40
I got Monk from E10 up and have been seeding when ever my computor is on.
Thanks.
I'm looking for the earlier episodes of this season now.
Will watch the whole thing when I get as far back as possable."
,grayscales,2009-12-10T18:35Z,"Hi 2040.  Glad I found you again after the November debacle.  I really appreciate your quality, small-footprint uploads, and re-seed as much as I can within my ISP's bandwidth restrictions.

Any chance you could upload the 2009 movie Amelia?  Your 2012 and The Box were great.  Cheers!"
