,zeek89,2009-12-17T07:18Z,Please seed!
,zeek89,2009-12-17T10:14Z,Come on! this desperately needs a seeder.
,Gosford,2009-12-20T19:07Z,I'd seed it if I could download it.. These people want to upload but they don't want to seed? makes nooo sense. Great band shame really
,helloseattle,2009-12-21T13:57Z,wow... people need to seed!  thanks to wkndwarz for the torrent.  best band of 09 for sure.
,zeek89,2010-01-03T01:33Z,well i can't really enjoy this because there are no seeders... and that makes it impossible to download. so for the love of god please seed this torrent.
,greyishblack,2010-06-11T18:55Z,"wkndwarz, you need to seed. 
Everyone else seeds for you, why do you refuse to reciprocate?"
