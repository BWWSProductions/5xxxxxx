,bhaskees,2009-12-23T16:07Z,"Do i have to create a bootable cd to insall? It's because i only want sp3. I cant mount the image using daemon or magic-disc, it says that the source file is in an unrecognizable format or is damaged. Help anyone?"
,jkkhop,2010-01-21T07:39Z,"just installed this thinking it is the fresh&clean edition, but IE8 is installed along with Sereby's Updatepack - IE Addon Version 1.0.7"" which i got no clue on. also there's some sort of font-aliasing i never had before, checked if cleartype was on but it isn't. 

i'm not complaining, i know making these takes time and considering it's a non-profit thing, but i could have as well installed my SP3 MSDN version and take choose all the updates i need.
