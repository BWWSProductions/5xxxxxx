,Jackson95,2010-02-09T11:22Z,"Hi

Does this included
Nazi Zombies and stuff like that? Is it Easy to use? PLEASE ANSWER!"
[T],Games4theworld,2010-02-11T12:23Z,"Hi,


   What exactly do you mean with Nazi Zombies? This is just the Original Game, without Multiplayer. You only need to run a Setup and that's it; you can play the Game!"

,F1xy,2010-04-08T14:40Z,is crack included `?
[T],Games4theworld,2010-04-17T10:24Z,"Hi,

  Well, you only need to run a setup, nothing else. After that you can play the Game, so no Cracking is needed."
,kkiilleerrjj,2010-04-19T03:26Z,Nazi Zombies is like a  really awesome survival survival thing in World at War where you kill Undead Nazis. I don't think it would be included in cracked versions with a used cd key.
,PandaPorn,2010-06-08T06:57Z,wait whoa theres no multiplayer
[T],Games4theworld,2010-06-13T13:32Z,"Hi,
