,salkstar123,2009-12-11T12:21Z,okay how the hell do I get these arcade files to play on my 360? With games I obviously extract them to Iso and put them on a dual layer disc.My 360 is modded with the latest firmware.I've extracted th file with win rar and It just looks like a blank file.Do I try burning it to a Dl disc?Please if your going to upload this shit at least give some instruction on how to use.I've tried putting the file onto a usb drive but my xbox dashboard doesn't give an option to play it.It can only be found under music videos and pictures and not the games section of the dashboard.pls pls pls help me I'm frustrated to bitzzzzzz AAARRRRGGGHHH
