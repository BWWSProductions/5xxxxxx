,Woogy,2009-12-12T05:15Z,"Normally I prefer divx format because its normally around 700 mb which cuts down on storage, bit of a quality trade off but I'm ok with this. Not really a fan of rars either

Certainly not going to have a cry about how it was uploaded thats the uploaders choice. 

Appreciate the upload cheers. 

Can anyone comment on quality ?
