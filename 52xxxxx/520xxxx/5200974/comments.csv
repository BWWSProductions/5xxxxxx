,BLACK75sm,2009-12-07T13:17Z,hi globe where are you mainly uploading (beside the pirate bay)now that mininova is gone?
,BLACK75sm,2009-12-07T14:08Z,thanks titikab
[V],globeplus,2009-12-09T09:21Z,"To BLACK75sm : Thank you for your comment , i am uploading in 4 or 5 torrents and btween them pirate bay and torrentzap , i know that everyone is missing the good service from mininova and they consider appeal on the case but life goes on , must be !!! Now that i am using this comment i´ll take the moment to say that i am having a slight problem with the tracker updates because no matter how many seeds and peers i have in the torrent the trackers do the work but reporting low number of seeds and peers and i don´t know if it is bacause any configuration or because any problems with the trackers . Thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2009-12-09T09:30Z,"This comment is exclusively to say to the users that the only thing that you can say about this file is the moment in time the file was uploaded many months after the launch of the game but finally the users and fans of this game like for any other GTA game have a pratical file with everything nice , without any joking i can say that this file is really much better than the 14 gb files ,because the user don´t need installation or doing the login every single time launch the game and is really perfect gameplaying , what i mean with this is if you apply the fantastic razor crack to the 14 gb files , you can play the game but with the game slowing down a little bit times to times , the true is the crack control the camera but don´t really kill the camera , you need more things for that and in my file it is really like a real copy of the game but more pratical because you don´t need to login every single time you launch the executable , just to finish the comment : IT IS BETTER LATER THEN NEVER a pratical file for this game specially if we are talking about GTA games . Thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2009-12-09T09:45Z,"i have a complementary file with secondary personages voices for 1gb and 2 fantastic packs with radios available for download in many links in a pratical way in my blog , link available in the description  ,  please use the blog to get this files and i am shore that this files can be downloaded before getting the main file with 5.62 gb . Thank you ."
,krennyy,2009-12-10T12:56Z,"Can u tell me where to add the radios in the file..?
Appreciate u'r work.. Still haven't tested it but I'd like to add the radios first..
Thnx.."
,krennyy,2009-12-10T18:17Z,"Btw, I tested the game works perfectly good..
Is there anyway to make it fullscreen??
And I'd appreciate the info for the radios how to add them."
[V],globeplus,2009-12-10T23:49Z,"please use the link to my blog and the path to include the radios is inside the downloaded radios files , it is really easy to addicionate the radios or the complementary file , just use my blog , i am using the blog because is so many links to help the users getting the extra files more as possible that was too much include them in the description , thank you for understanding ."
,krennyy,2009-12-11T00:52Z,"I already have the radios, 2gb :[
Isn't there any path inside the folder or the Audio folder to add them ..?"

,goooby123,2009-12-14T14:04Z,pleaase guys iv'e been downloading for 2 days now and i see many seeds and peers but i havent gone above 100kb/s for 2 days its been staying at the same speed of 10-30 kb/s and its real bad when i see the peer list of the downloaders are not seeding though im seeding at my max speed but recieveing crap so if u cud offer advice or seed at a higher speed i would be real thankfull :D
[V],globeplus,2009-12-14T20:52Z,"to danny christ : doesn´t matter , i have the exact formula to have the gameplaying possible .
to goooby123 : i really understand that you said i am doing for a week and it is only improving a little bit day after day in number of seeds but i still believe that this file is not at the correct shape in seeds (at least i hope that !!! ) ."
