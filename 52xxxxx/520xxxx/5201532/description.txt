    One of the administrative tasks to consider when making network         
    design and infrastructure plans is the business's requirements for      
    application availability, deployment, and management. This can          
    involve the need to make desktop environments or individual             
    applications available to remote users or clients, deciding on the      
    method to use for distribution of application packages, or              
    determining the need for and type of an application management          
    product to implement. This course covers the Windows Server 2008        
    Terminal Services role that offers remote desktop and application       
    access, including the capabilities provided by TS Licensing, TS         
    RemoteApp, TS Web Access, TS Gateway, and TS Session Broker role        
    services. It also covers options for deploying application packages     
    to users or computers through AD DS Group Policy and a look at          
    management using specialized System Center products such as System      
    Center Configuration Manager 2007 and System Center Essentials 2007.
