 A complete guide to using ModSecurity, this book will show you how to
 secure your web application and server, and does so by using real-world
 examples of attacks currently in use. It will help you learn about SQL
 injection, cross-site scripting attacks, cross-site request forgeries,
 null byte attacks, and many more so that you know how attackers operate.

 Using clear, step-by-step instructions this book starts by teaching you
 how to install and set up ModSecurity, before diving into the rule language
 with examples. It assumes no prior knowledge of ModSecurity, so as long as
 you are familiar with basic Linux administration, you can start to learn
 right away.
