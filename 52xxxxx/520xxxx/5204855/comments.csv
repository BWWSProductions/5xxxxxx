please seed"
,darklordofspawn,2010-01-02T18:12Z,"i have finally downloaded it

i can confirm that this torrent is virus free and works 100%

note: when you install the patch and try to play the game the voices are all mixed up, thats when you go to where you installed Demigod look for the ""sounds"" folder and click on the update .exe file for your language

thank you uploader :)"
,UnR34LGAMIN,2010-01-02T21:58Z,"Yeah no problem, I use TPB all the time so I thought I'd give something back.

Try Demigod on GameRanger if you don't already, that's why I made this patch/fix."
,Shaamaan,2010-01-07T08:16Z,"There's something very odd about this update. It works fine, don't get me wrong, but I've been to gamereplays.org and it appears that the latest version played is 1.19, NOT 1.20."
,Shaamaan,2010-01-07T08:21Z,"Apologies. Apparently 1.20 replays are also available... it just seems that there are far more new 1.19 users.

Is the 1.20 a beta version?"
,UnR34LGAMIN,2010-01-07T14:50Z,"http://forums.demigodthegame.com/369856

Nope, its the real thing. 1.20 final"
,Shaamaan,2010-01-07T15:38Z,"Thanks, that made me feel better.

If I may ask: any interface issues when playing back replays? The whole thing seems to be very unstable, often switching the skill bars for those of another demigod or the entire info-bar vanishing (usually on death)."
,UnR34LGAMIN,2010-01-09T17:27Z,"Shaamaan:
Well I have to say you're the first person that's had this happen that I know of. I think you should try reinstalling if you haven't already. I didn't make the 1.20 patch as I said.

For everyone else don't let this put you off, it should work."
,Mikuzz,2010-01-18T02:45Z,"Btw LAN works for me
Installed over AVENGED LAN Patch"
,dr23,2010-02-03T02:49Z,"ok, for some reason, i can't get the extra demigods to be available. =/ i see them, but they are greyed out.
what do i do?"
,UnR34LGAMIN,2010-02-03T02:59Z,"The Patch adds the Demigods, the reg files unlocks them. Run the reg file for your system - 32/64bit. If you dont know what your running its safe to add both them."
,dr23,2010-02-03T03:47Z,"ah, i was lookin in the wrong folder for the file. lol
sorry, about that, but thanks for the help anyway."
,VenWorx,2010-02-24T22:17Z,"UnR34LGAMIN

Do you have crack for patch 1.20.147 ?"
,Earthplayer,2010-04-24T12:49Z,"Is there any way to get the newest 1.20.0214 Update? This is 1.20.0211 but newest is 1.20.0214 :/ 

I hope someone can upload it somehow^^"
,VenWorx,2010-04-25T13:19Z,"You can download patch 1.20.214 from here:
http://files.games.1c.ru/demigod/demigod_v120147_eng.zip (file's name says that it is a 1.20.147 but it's 1.20.214 inside)

This patch is for english retail from russian game publisher ''1C''.

But I can't find a crack for it. Maybe you got a crack for 1.20.214???"
,VenWorx,2010-04-25T13:30Z,"I got registry strings in case the patch will not install. You should change the path to the game according to your path. Maybe you should change something else - I don't know. I hope you will understand what values should be changed in your case...

,Earthplayer,2010-04-27T21:18Z,"Well, I can't find a crack but mounting the image of the game into the real drive (virtual CD 9) worked fine for me. ^^ Still a crack would be better :/"
,VenWorx,2010-04-28T00:39Z,Hmm... That's strange. Mounting image dosen't work for me. The game wants to be online activated over Stardock Impulse :(  (in my case)

,eXoflow,2011-05-01T13:06Z,Would be awesome if someone could crack 1.3 :)
,geramul,2011-09-15T18:10Z,"I can't freaking update the sound in the game. I ran the addreg bat and it said it ran successfully, so what's the damn problem? Whenever I try to run the voice update (I tried them all) it says that the old file does not exist. I tried playing through a short skirmish and then running the update again, but it gave me the same error. "
,sumn00b,2011-10-12T07:16Z,"If anyone still paying attention to this torrent i need help im running windows 7 and i have the version install straight from the iso, everytime i try patching i get a black screen so i run the reg file and the it gives me path way errors wat am i doing wrong some one plz help:("
,GreenChaos86,2012-01-08T02:39Z,"If you cant get the sounds to patch make sure you changed the

""""Path""=""C:\\games\\Demigod\\"" "" in the addreg.bat to the directory where you have the main demigod folder, then the sound patch will work

hope someone cracks the 1.3"
,piratebaybff,2012-06-01T17:56Z,How can i open the new demigods
