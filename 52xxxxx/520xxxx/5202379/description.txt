         The banning of Jodie's incendiary rap song sparks a           
          freedom-of-speech revolt among the students. Nick, Rose and   
          Jodie lead their fellow students in a strike and Deloraine    
          counters with the threat of suspensions for all those         
          involved. The dispute is amicably settled through             
          negotiatons with everyone getting their demands met  except  
          for Con who doesn't get the school soccer team he wanted. He  
          does however get Danielle and Steve back together in time     
         for Valentine's Day.tzuk
