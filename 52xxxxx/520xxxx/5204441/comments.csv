,AdmiralKirk1701,2009-12-09T00:24Z,"I'm unable to download any of the Howard Stern torrents from the last week or so that wushdishmeen has posted. When I try to download, each torrent says ""0 seeds in 0 peers."" But I know that other people have been able to get the files.  Can someone tell me why I'm having this problem?  Thanks! "
