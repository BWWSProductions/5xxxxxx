,Riki19,2009-12-13T00:17Z,"If your gonna post, and you like TPB, then post on the quality of the movie, the plot of the movie, or just something that is related to the fucking movie. 

If you think that you have something totally awesome to say, then, before you post, ask yourself this question:

""Does what I'm about to say have bear any relation whatsoever t the fucking movie!""

Sorry for being a dick."
