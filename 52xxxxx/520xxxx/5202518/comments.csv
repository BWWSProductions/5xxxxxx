,landmine76,2010-12-12T17:31Z,"Don't bother with this list. I've tried adding them, and you get marked as a spammer. It looks like most of this email list was compiled in late 2007 or early 2008. So i'd bet that most of these people don't even play Mafia wars anymore."

,MynXe,2010-12-13T04:35Z,"I don't recall ""giving up"" my email address to the entire world for mafia members. Tell me, where was this contract posted that I signed ""giving up"" my information to be shared on a torrent site?"
,MynXe,2010-12-13T04:39Z,it occurs to me that this could be the reason for the crap-load of spam I have received during the last year. Thanks a lot.
,lol9765,2012-03-10T19:49Z,"there's a list of email addresses here, 20 or so. they're from the daily mail and the sun, but if you send email to these addresses, they then send email to ALL of their subscribers, which I just discovered. if you spam these daily mail and the sun emails, you'll be spamming THOUSANDS of email addresses - and you don't need to do a thing.
