,OOKell,2009-12-20T01:52Z,"For some reason I can't unpack this with 7-zip.

It doesn't think that phineas.and.ferb.s02e37.phineas.and.ferbs.christmas.vacation.hdtv.xvid-dvsky.part01.rar is an archive.

It can open the other files though...

I have forced a recheck as well as deleting the file and downloading it again.

Any suggestions?  I'd rather not have to install winRar just for this..."
