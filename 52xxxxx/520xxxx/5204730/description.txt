Lossless/FLAC
Includes: Cue

2009 debut from the young multi-talented singer, musician and Usher's teen protâ€šgâ€š. An old soul is the last thing you would expect to find inside Justin Bieber. But all it takes is one listen to the 15-year-old Soul-singing phenomenon to realize that he is light-years ahead of his manufactured Pop peers. The album features production from The-Dream and Tricky Stewart. The first single, 'One Time,' produced by Tricky, is about one of Justin's favorite topics, puppy love. Usher joins Justin on 'First Dance,' where the two share verses on a song that Bieber describes as ''a slow groovy song that people can dance to.'' On the Midi-Mafia-produced 'Down To Earth,' Justin digs deep to talk about growing up. 'Bigger' finds the teenage singer maturing at a steady rate while motivating his listeners to strive for their goals.
