,yadayadaya,2009-12-08T17:31Z,I hope you are coming back to seed :(  Doubt anyone got the whole thing with it being up under 6 hours.
,PROTOCOLX,2009-12-08T19:31Z,"I DON'T have the files to share...! So I'm uploading what I downloaded so far... That's 250MB for now... 

I only announced the torrent for Hazard cause he didn't have a Piratebay account (it's easy to create one though..)

So we all are waiting for the first one that can share the whole image.. "
,yadayadaya,2009-12-08T23:07Z,I see that from search around on the net...so that said...this would be much much easier if he would dump it to usenet or an ftp site.  I can pull it from usenet and see it then.
,PROTOCOLX,2009-12-08T23:27Z,"Yup... I don't get it also.. But at last the image is downloading... We waited long for this image... And the only link we had was a bunch of part files that can't be downloaded as a free user... 
So that sucked!

So we asked Hazard to make at least a torrent file that's accessible for everyone... If you're in a hurry...  this first week is gonna very bad for your're health...  "
,yadayadaya,2009-12-09T01:28Z,"Nah, not in a hurry...just would hate to wait for an image that won't work on my new laptop, or should I say another that won't work."

,yadayadaya,2009-12-10T13:19Z,"maq...speeed apparently you cannot read.  The reason for the slowness is stated here...it's because no one that actually has the complete files is seeding, rather they are downloading it FROM the person who has the complete files and seeding at the same time.  The torrent was uploaded prior to all this, which is a bad idea I know, but still explained here, so your incessant complaining is pointless."
,PROTOCOLX,2009-12-10T15:32Z,From now on there are 4 seeders who have the complete image... Hazard has brought them the files to upload... So we'll just have to wait till the rest of the files are coming to us.. :)

,HazardX,2009-12-12T17:46Z,Default boot option is 64-bit and if you want to boot in 32-bit in chameleon write this  -v arch=i386
,slimdizzy,2009-12-12T21:31Z,"@maq...speed - On boot try typing this at the Chameleon boot loader:  -v -x -x32 arch=i386

If it doesnt boot with that then your system probably is not compatible.  You should see where it fails by using the -v option and then google that.  Most likely a graphics or ide/sata issue."

The install was a breeze. Thanks a ton. The issue is I have a Win 7 install on one partition. Had Leopard on another (logical part) and installed SL on another partition (same drive logical). Before install of SL using EasyBCD 1.7.2 i could boot into Win 7 and Leopard. But after the SL install I have two issues : Cannot see the Snow Leopard or Leopard install even when booting using DVD with F8. I cannot boot into the existing Leopard. I get the message Loading Darwin/x86 and it just stops here. It seems its the booting config that need to be in place. Can someone advise.

So, first, if I do that, the installer will install everything or does it know that the ripped content should not be installed?

Then, what torrent or download should I use to get the right Snow Leopard Retail DVD?

Finally, what was ripped? Those are 3GB of files!

Its just like installing Windows: you'll have to burn it to a DL-DVD (8.5Gb) or use a bootable USB-Pendrive (8Gb) to install it.
You'll have to either install it on a different disk (on multiboot, so Win7 and Mac OS X Snow Leo) or you will have to replace Windows for this Mac version.

If you are using the test7 kernel, try renaming mach_kernel.test7 in your Snow Install root directory to mach_kernel. Delete the original mach_kernel in your Snow install first. Also, make sure your com.apple.Boot.plist in your /Extra/Extensions directory(Snow) says mach_kernel for your kernel string.  Let me know how it goes..."

[T],lilmjkl,2010-12-19T23:05Z,"IMPORTANT!!!

- Not all hardware is supported, Most intel hardware works fine but there is absolute no guarante for it. Want to know it for sure, google for it!
- MAKE A BACK UP FROM YOUR COMPUTER!!!!!!

Installation Help:

- After downloading unzip the file.
- Burn the unzipped Image on a Single DVD. All kind of DVD's are supported IF your Optical drive supports it.
- Start the computer you want to install Mac Os on with Windows (if not started yet)
In Windows go to START and right-click on COMPUTER. Click on MANAGE or something (Sorry, using Dutch computer)
- Go to Disc Manage and select your drive.
- Make your drive smaller. Like half your Hard drive. At least 20GB
- Place the Mac Os DVD in your computer and shut it down.
- When shut down, start your computer and press F2, F8 or F12, This depends on your Motherboard, and wait untill your computer askes to boot from DVD.
- Boot from your DVD and wait like 5 minutes untill Hazard Snow Leopards is loaded. 
Select your luangage and accept all the rest.
- Then when Mac is asking for a drive to install there is no option. This is normal.
-Go to UTILITY'S and select Drive options or something. Then it's searching for drives on your computer and also detects for at least 2 Partitions on your Hard Drive.
Select the Drive we just made in Windows, Be ensure it's not the partition Windows is Installed on.
- When selected you see NT system or somthing, make this Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and name it Snow Leopard(or something else you remember) and press New, Clean, Fix or maybe an OK button right below.
- Go to UTILITY'S in the left upper corner and select ( stop UTILITY'S)
- Now the drive is founded in Mac with the name Snow Leopard (or what you named it) Select it and press install.

This will take a serveral minutes and its not hard from this part. There are enough movies about how Snow Leopard has to be installed.

Problems? All can be found or asked on the website of Leohazerd (see discription)"

Currently I have this running in a Virtual Machine on my desktop, I tried to make a bootable USB but that didn't work.  So I went out and bought some blank DVD's to use for this *and for my other OS's in case this turns out impossible*.

Anyways; I have an external disk drive I can plug in through USB; I tried to boot from that but it wouldn't.  I've been trying for almost a month to get this working; doing tons of research and downloads and so far nothings worked.  So I'm asking here; hopefully someone will know how to get this working on an Acer Aspire One.

Also, I copied the iso to the disk and burnt it that way; after I did that I've heard that people say I should use something else to do that *downloaded a program for that*, but before I waste another DVD, would that actually be the issue when it comes to booting from the DVD?

I'd rather have this booting from USB, but if that's not possible then the DVD is fine."

,rmpirated,2012-03-01T08:33Z,"Thank you Hazard !! Finally got it to work. It requires patience. I dual booted Windows 7 and Snow leopard successfully. OK so here goes:

I booted from disc, installed, and many time i got ""you have to restart your pc.."". This is a kernel panic. Here are steps taken to prevent this and install and dual boot successfully (I am writing this guide off my head so forgive me if i make mistakes):

-BACK UP YOUR DATA !!

-Burn dvd using any iso burner or if in windows 7, just double click and burn

-Boot from CD

-Press any key quick

-Screen goes to apple logo, installation screen appears.

-ON top bar, click utilities and click disk utility.
-click on your hard drive name on left panel. 

click partition. Under partition, click drop down list and choose 2 partitions. Type a names for your partitons and size them accordingly. (The 2nd partition is for windows 7).

-Choose 1st partition. under format, choose mac os extended journaled. click options, choose GUID table, click ok. 

-Choose 2nd partition, under format, choose NTFS. click options, choose master boot record.

-Finally click erase. This will partition your hdd making it ready for dual boot.

-Turn off pc. i think click 1st tab, exit disk utility. click it again, shut down. or just hold power button 5 seconds.

-Boot from Windows 7 DVD and install to 3rd partition. (Mac created 2 partition for itself, these will show as unknown)

-Pc will now boot to windows 7.

-Power off and reboot from this snow leopard hazard dvd.

-repeat steps to reach installation screen.

-click next until u see the customize button appear on the left. click it too choose various options.

-Now this is the tricky part. ONLY u know what your system specs are. Take note of any IDE drives, ps/2 keyboards/mice, Processors older than Core 2 duos, AMD processors, etc that u have. My only problem was my IDE hdd. Use google to know which kexts u need. The main ones are chameleon etc. NOTE: Dont choose legacy kernel drivers as you may not need them. Also, I have not tried ticking all options but this is corrupt installation as drivers may clash. I cant say which drivers you may need/not need. 

-After choosing drivers, OK, Click drive, Install

-Installation takes about 6-10minutes. Pc will reboot automatically. 

-You will be rebooted into chameleon bootloader and after 3 seconds it will automatically boot mac. If all went well, you will see an apple with and then mac setup menu appears. If not, you will get the ""your pc needs to reboot error"" like me many times right after apple.

-Reboot and at bootloader, quickly hit any key to pause timer. You should see 2 options, Snow leopard and Windows 7. Type darkwake=0 and at the bottom of the screen, you will see bootloader: darkwake=0 appear. Hit enter too boot mac. It will boot as normal but instead of the reboot error msg, you will see a kernel panic code. Wait till you see a kernel panic appear.  look for the line where it says someting about kernel dependancy and a something.kext.

Thats all advice I can come up with for now. Please note that this will not be easy. You are installing an OS not made for a PC onto a PC. Problems will happen as apple has not accounted for all the different combination of specs of pcs out there in the world.
