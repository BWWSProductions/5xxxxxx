 Moodle is a popular e-learning platform that is making inroads into all
 areas of the curriculum. Using moodle helps you to develop exciting,
 interactive, and engaging online math courses. But teaching math requires
 use of graphs, equations, special notation, and other features that are
 not built into Moodle. Using Moodle to teach Mathematics presents its own
 challenges.

 The book will show you how to set-up a Moodle course to support the teaching
 of mathematics. It will also help you to carefully explore the Moodle plugins
 that allow the handling of equations and enable other frequently used
 mathematical activities.
