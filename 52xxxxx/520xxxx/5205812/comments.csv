,welshchick37,2010-01-21T19:58Z,thanx you just save me hours of work. let you know what i think on the quality..............
,wb21,2010-02-06T00:18Z,Oh man... Not only 320KB/s... but AAC and not MP3! Realised all my muse albums i ripped years ago were at iTunes default 128AAC... saved me so much time... 
,.eight.,2010-02-14T08:12Z,"Great quality, great band and above all great torrent.  One of the fastest downloads I've gotten since I started using PB so thanks to all who seeded and thanks to peck for compiling this."
,IW901,2010-02-20T09:50Z,"Thanks a lot, great quality, will seed away Xxx"
,i_reckoner,2010-03-04T23:18Z,"great torrent! but what about ""intro"" song in absolution? it's missing... and you could've also put the artworks inside the folders, that'd be nice!
brazilian greetings!"
,i_reckoner,2010-03-04T23:28Z,"oops, nevermind, found it! =)"
,Stinja,2010-03-09T06:39Z,"great torrent, fast download :)"
,Sptz,2010-03-25T18:22Z,"All albums are normalized? Complete rubbish then. Why the hell would you normalize, it doesn't make any sense! An album is already mastered and you're going to apply a normalize on top of it, not to mention the software you may have used probably used a limiter even MORE on top of that aswell! Seriously wtf... why not rip at 320kbps AND BE DONE WITH IT! It's how it's supposed to be"
,gremlin03,2010-05-22T03:41Z,thanks!
,m00nluvr,2010-08-02T20:27Z,I couldn't be happier with the format and the download speeds.  I will happily seed after download.
,cheeken,2010-08-24T12:06Z,Thank you for the upload. Thanks to all the seeders!
,CocoHalf,2011-01-11T11:32Z,"Thanks for the great upload! However, where is ""Fury"" track 15 from Absolution?"
,gaaraisgod,2011-03-15T16:17Z,"I'm not really sure but I'd prefer it without normalization.

Anyway, the rest is pretty much awesome. So thanks for that."
,zarnaik,2011-06-25T14:00Z,You're my true hero :)
