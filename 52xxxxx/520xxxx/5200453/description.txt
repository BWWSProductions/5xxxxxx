Plot:

When Beijing journalist Ga Yu (Zhang Lei) arrives in a remote Tibetan village, he immediately find himself embedded in a relentless manhunt across the barren wasteland of Kekexili. Acting without the Chinese government's approval, this ragtag group of impoverished vigilantes has sworn to capture or kill the poachers responsible for decimating the sacred anthilopes of Kekexili. As the harsh landscape overcomes them and the ruthless poachers begin picking them off, Ga Yu realizes that it isn't merely a manhunt he is chronicling, but a profound journey of survival and death. Inspired by a people's remarkabke mission, award winning director Lu Chan has created a masterful tale that stirs whitin long after the film has ended.
