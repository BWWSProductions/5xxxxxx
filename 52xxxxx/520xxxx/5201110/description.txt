Ravi Babu surprised everyone by being seen in a positive and intelligent role in his latest directorial Amaravathi. He kept the truth that he was actually the main lead under wraps all these days. He surprised the audience by hogging the limelight for most of the time in the film, which also has Tarakaratna, Sneha and Bhoomika among others.

In the film, Ravi Babu plays a sleuth at the Special Task Force, who leads the investigation into a quirky case haunting many pregnant mothers. Ravi Babu's is a full-fledged role in the movie, and it is not either Sneha's or Bhumika's.

The initial reactions are favourable for the director-actor. He has played a character devoid of cheap humour or wicked villainism for the first time in his career. So, is it re-invention in the case of Chalapathi Rao's son? Time will tell us.
