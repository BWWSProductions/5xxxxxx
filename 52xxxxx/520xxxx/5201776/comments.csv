,prolific_1,2010-03-01T19:26Z,portable v worked for me...do not use live update and it should be fine
,ExternalBleeding,2010-05-11T03:35Z,"Tried even after turning updates off, and Internet off. Serial didn't work, and I don't like the how theres virus comments, yet he has no proof to back up the claim that there is no virus. 
Download speed was decent (50kb/s).

Overall, bad torrent. Download with caution."
,preeceray,2010-05-26T16:31Z,"downloaded in minutes no trojan, does what it says on the tin.........nice download...ty"
,zeroclan,2010-06-19T21:58Z,"Portable works just fine guys, so is the serial w/o live update!!

,zola958,2010-06-25T22:13Z,"Yes. serial works once, but after DL updated driver base serial is useless? Is there any solution for running app after DL later driver base."
,bendlein,2010-07-02T04:35Z,"Many thanks,works fine."
,williamborrill,2010-08-01T12:34Z,"So yes or no?

,Humvee H2,2011-01-11T12:59Z,SERIAL NOT WORKING
,CHTonRage,2011-03-20T05:41Z,"Things to do when installing/using torrents:
1. Disconnect your internet. (Most torrents work fine with, but there are a few that do not work with.)
2. Scan using at least 2 antiviruses. (For best results, DON'T use norton. Use avast instead.)
3. READ instructions. (Don't complain if the torrents don't work if you don't.)
4. Scan your computer for viruses beforehand. (Don't falsely blame the torrent for viruses if you don't.)

Things NOT to do:
1. Using only one antivirus to scan.
2. Not reading instructions.
3. Not scanning your computer for viruses beforehand.

Remember, TPB is for its users and vice versa. Put constructive comments and/or virus-free torrents and everybody will be mostly happy."
