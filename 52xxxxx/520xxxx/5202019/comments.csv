,TheEmpathicEar,2009-12-09T01:51Z,"@zingooo
Do you have English subtitles for V3? I tried the V2 subs and they are not in sync with this release?"
[T],zingooo,2009-12-09T02:24Z,try here http://subscene.com/

I tried there, nothing for V3.

This torrent,  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5200777/THE_TWILIGHT_SAGA_NEW_MOON_[2009]_TS_Xvid_[StB] , contains English subtitles and they are in sync for that release. The video for this release is MUCH better.
I used Jubler Subtitle Editor to try to ""shift"" the t ime for this release, but was unsuccessful. Any ideas?"

Thanks, but I would have learning curve using IRC. [I have avoided it so far...]
Any other ideas?"

Thanks for your download and help. Subsync seems  to be able to ""Synchronize"" subtitles to a video.

And, the process is fairly automated. Well, it worked  for this video anyway..."
