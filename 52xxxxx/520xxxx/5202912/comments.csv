,gordauch,2009-12-09T21:41Z,"H&R Block, in their wisdom, now support Win XP and newer, so us Win2K people are forced to migrate to the other one (TurboTax). Bummer."
,gordauch,2009-12-10T05:48Z,"Aha! TurboTax has eliminateed compatibility with versions older than XP too, so us dinosaurs are outta luck. It must be a conspiracy. Now, repeat after me: }}Bill Gates Knows Best{{"
,researcher70,2009-12-18T04:45Z,"Thanks JungleSweed!

I join JoeRBlack in asking for the Premium edition if anyone has it."
,dnst3,2010-01-04T01:55Z,no offense to you jungle but since this app while deal with very sensitive info. i request a file scan of this. not just anyone's anti viri but put it through the ringer. as in virustotal and the like. its doable. you just need to section the pieces into max uploaded or something. 
,flacowboy1,2010-01-08T12:32Z,Works great!
,leopaul,2010-01-09T06:31Z,"This is Mac version only, right?"
,AnimalGrace,2010-01-13T03:15Z,"Not sure if this is just my problem or not, but I couldn't update by using the program updater. I had to go to the h&r support page and download the current update for this version. Updated fine that way.  Did a test return using my last paystub and looks like I'll be getting around 7k back this year!
Thanks JungleSweed, works great!"

,brazuka331,2010-01-29T06:59Z,Is it okay to register this?
,brazuka331,2010-02-03T05:53Z,Wher is the key code?
,bamboo42,2010-02-23T02:23Z,There is no key included which is needed to e-file. You can still print the returns and mail them though.
,ejidal,2010-04-10T23:34Z,You still need a key code once you have everything filled in before you can e-file. You'll see this at the very last step before e-filing. Tha'ts where HR Block get you for $9.95!!!!
