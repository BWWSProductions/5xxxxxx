V/9.5

This has 2 Audio tracks, first one is FRENCH or RUSSIAN. You have to change to track 2, and it plays it in ENGLISH. It has subtitles for when the movie goes into a the scenes where they speak GERMAN. TY!!!!!!"
,vorpaljim,2009-12-17T06:44Z,what r u talking about? how do you switch audio track on an avi file from the media player?
,partchimp,2009-12-17T19:02Z,"It's easy to change audio tracks using Quicktime Player:

Open the file
Click on Window - Show Movie Properties
Un-check Sound Track 1
Check Sound Track 2

You can even delete Sound Track 1 and re-save the movie.

Simples!"
,CaptainSpike,2009-12-18T05:55Z,"That's great, PartChimp, but you have to pay for the Quicktime (Pro) Player that does that. How about instuctions on how to change the language in a free player such as VLC?"
,CaptainSpike,2009-12-18T06:05Z,In VLC Media Player - go to Audio - Audio Track - check Track 2....to hear Brad Pitt speak in some kind of Texan or other english...
,TwoCents,2009-12-18T14:46Z,"Great copy!

I used AVIMux to remove the Russian audio track.
Easy Peasy... took about 45 seconds.

Thanks for the up!"

V/8.5

Audio is sometimes not loud enough, even with my volumes maxed out. Also, the video is sometimes blurry along the sides. Other than that, a great download."
,wynaki,2009-12-26T15:39Z,"this is a CAM version...
video is good, but audio is verry bad...

V=8
A=3"
,CarnageHeart,2009-12-26T22:13Z,"Excellent quality, I give this one a 10 out of 10 for both audio and video compared to the other DVD rips. This is a dual audio DVD rip so you need a media player that supports changing audio tracks if you want it to be in English.

I suggest getting VLC, it's a free lightweight player that works for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and it plays just about every video and audio file type. Just open up this movie in VLC, right click on the video, hover over Audio -> Audio Track -> Track 2

You can get the VLC player @ http://www.videolan.org/"
,CarnageHeart,2009-12-26T22:16Z,"@ wynaki

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you commented on the wrong torrent. If you really meant to comment on the quality of this one... you need glasses and probably a hearing aid."
,sk8er1183,2010-01-12T23:39Z,I am still having a prob with saving the video file with track 2 as audio any help would be great. and It has great V/A 
,sk8er1183,2010-01-13T03:59Z,forgot to say that im using vlc media player
,phildan,2010-01-14T19:05Z,this torrent is really good havent got it yet but was averaging over 1000 kb/s will comment again about quality
,RunZoneFive,2010-01-26T10:56Z,"Set it up on VLC, switched audio tracks like I learned in comments, works great. Only watched half an hour so far, everythings awesome so far.

@SerGiant: Thanks very much for uploading this, great quality and free of charge. Makes me very happy :)

@Captain Spike: Thanks for your help in the comments with VLC audio switching"
