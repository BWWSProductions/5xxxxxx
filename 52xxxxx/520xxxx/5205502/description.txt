Plot
What happens when life just doesn't turn out as we expect it will? What if you had the benefit of hindsight and could alter those defining choices that you now regret? Welcome to the life of 30-something Erica Strange, where the classic fantasy of revisiting the past offers her a chance to cope with her life and come to terms with her choices, in BEING ERICA.

In BEING ERICA, life changes forever for over-educated and underachieving Erica (Erin Karpluk, The L Word, Godiva's) when she meets Dr. Tom, a mysterious therapist who takes her back in time for a chance to do over those life-defining moments with the foresight and wisdom of seeing how they played out. From prom nights and first kisses to job interviews, Erica's list of regrets has accumulated to the point where she must act now or forever accept her mediocre life. Gemini Award-winner Michael Riley (This is Wonderland, Power Play) is Dr. Tom. BEING ERICA also stars Tyron Leitso (Wonderfalls, Edgemont), Reagan Pasternak (Just Buried) and Devon Bostick (Adoration, The Stone Angel).

After Erica quits therapy, Dr. Naadiah sends her back to a bar in 1998, where she meets a younger, troubled Dr. Tom. A glimpse into his past, and Erica realizes it is her turn now to lend a helping hand.
