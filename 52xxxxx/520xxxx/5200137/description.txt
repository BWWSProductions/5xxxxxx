BlackBerry smartphones have been around for a while, but with record numbers of devices sold and the launch of BlackBerry App World, there has never been a more exciting time to get into BlackBerry application development.

Assuming only some programming background in Java or a similar language, this book starts with the basics and teaches you what you need to know to get started developing native applications for BlackBerry. Step by step tutorials will take you through downloading and installing the BlackBerry development environment, creating your first applications, and exploring the BlackBerry API.

Youâ€™ll learn how to use the BlackBerry user interface components to create the look and feel you want, how to use networking to create applications that can talk to servers anywhere on the internet, how to manage application lifecycle and data storage, and how to use the GPS and mapping functionality included on many devices to create location-aware applications.

Youâ€™ll also learn about the different ways you can package and distribute your application, from deploying an application on your own website to listing your application for sale on App World.
