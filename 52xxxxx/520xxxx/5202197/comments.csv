,pesja,2009-12-08T17:18Z,AVG antivirus detected a trojan when downloading this. Seems to be the keygen it reacts too ... hmmm
,serialki11er,2009-12-09T15:52Z,"Yup it sure will detect as a virus but rest assured it's NOT a virus. Just check out my other torrents; all clean. This one is clean also and once you use the provided keygen that AVG detects as a virus (LOL!) you'll be activated until 2018 :)

Just disable your antivirus when opening the keygen :)"
,gizmogazza,2009-12-10T08:03Z,Some keygens show up as a virus but they are not... research it if you don't believe me. or go out and buy it
,Bamin,2009-12-13T15:13Z,"I've download it.
When I tried to instal it, 
it says;

Local machine: install actions planned
    Installation:
        Error: MSVC Redistributables installation failed. Installation of AVG can not continue.

Can someone help me?"

,snuper325,2010-01-14T02:22Z,The Keygen doesn't open so it is useless. Don't download until there is a fix.
