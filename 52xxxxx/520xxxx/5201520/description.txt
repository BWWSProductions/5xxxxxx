    Active Directory Certificate Services is a built-in Certificate         
    Authority that is included with Windows Server 2008. Certificate        
    Authorities are responsible for issuing certificates that validate      
    the identity of users and can be used to secure e-mail correspondence   
    and for web-based authentication. This course discusses planning        
    considerations for CA deployment as well as considerations for          
    deploying storage area networks. High availability is another key       
    consideration when implementing Windows Server 2008. This course        
    covers planning for availability and scalability through the use of     
    technologies such as Failover Clustering and Network Load Balancing.
