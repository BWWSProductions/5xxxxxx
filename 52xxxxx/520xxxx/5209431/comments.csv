,ziondave,2011-08-30T03:15Z,Thanks for the upload but just watched the first episode and the file seems to be corrupted with a couple of bits missing and gaps in the storyline.  Hopefully the rest will be ok.

,toff36,2012-07-18T10:19Z,"Thanks. Appreciate your work. Some minor problems e.g towards end of episode 1 a little picture ""static"", and episode 7 finishes a bit early but story line maintained. Have yet to check other episodes. I can put up with minor problems."
