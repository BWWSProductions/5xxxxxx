Rename .cbz to .zip and extract. Make a new .zip of .rar file from ONLY the .jpg files and rename that to .cbz/.cbr. 

However, both 'scans' are made by some moron who uses a trail version of a pdf-converter, so all pages are riddled with crap. 

Does nobody check things before uploading anymore???"
,oxbladder,2009-12-07T21:59Z,"Deznaj,

I am the moron. I have to admit I was far too busy to do a through check. I was going to put fully repaired copies in next week's torrent. However, since you feel the need to be so hostile and could very easily have probably gone out and purchased your damn copies of these books I am not going to bother putting the properly extracted copies in next week's torrent.

In fact, since I volunteer to do these torrents I see no reason to take this crap from the likes of you or anyone else. This will be the last SIR torrent I will post and I am shutting the thread down on the comicsearch.co.uk. If you have the nards you can come over to that forum and explain why I am shutting it down."
[T],artrimbaud,2009-12-09T03:43Z,"Hey ox, thanks for all the time and effort you have put in on the SIR torrents since the very first week.  94 weeks is a hell of a run."
,pkreed71,2009-12-10T00:16Z,"Thanks Ox! 

Do you by any chance have the other post-House of M stuff that you can post? Such as Civil War : House of M and House of M: Avengers?"
,RatchetHarry,2009-12-14T13:00Z,"Thanks for all the effort oxbladder ! We really do appreciate your great work :-)
Don't be upset bro...
I do hope that your SIR list will be active soon "
