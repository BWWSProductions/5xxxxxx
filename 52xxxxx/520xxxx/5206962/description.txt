ROYAL CANADIAN AIR FARCE: ANOTHER YEAR OF THE FARCE

Two of Royal Canadian Air Farce's most-requested shows!
Together, it's sixty-six minutes of Air Farce - fast, fresh
and funny!

Canada's favourite comedy troupe (winners of Canada's 
Viewers Choice Award at both the 2000 and 2001 Gemini 
Awards) Roger Abbott, Don Ferguson and Luba Goy, take
one more look back at 2001, with a whack at Osama bin
Laden, George W. Bush's cross-border memory loss, Keith
Richards' Napster rap, Harry Potter-mania, and satellite
time delays at CNN. Plus special guest stars Sean Cullen,
Sheila McCarthy, Patrick McKenna and Sonja Smits team
up for a fast-paced strafe of all things topical, tacky or
tedious in this annual roundup of the year's funniest.
A 44-minute laugh-filled Tour de Farce, it's the original
hit TV special that kicked off 2002.

Plus This Special Bonus Show!

Canada - A Mildly Informative, Not Overly-Long People's
History is Air Farce's celebrated send-up of the ground-
breaking CBC Television series Canada: A People's History.
It's the story of our country told with inspired lunacy,
packed into just 22 minutes. History becomes hysterical,
with guest stars Graham Greene and Rex Murphy, and
the original Air Farce foursome, including John Morgan
as Mike from Canmore.
