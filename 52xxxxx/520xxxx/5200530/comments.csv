,mr357magnum,2011-04-03T14:31Z,"If you get an error saying ""MODE NOT SUPPORTED"" because your monitor or TV does not support the Games Default Resolution, then here is the fix:

All you have to do is, go to your shortcut on the desktop, right click go to properties. There should be text ""Target"" and next to it a line of coding like this ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" 

Change ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" to ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" -w 1024 -h 768 or what ever your Monitor or TV Supports.

That should force it to start up with those dimensions. Also if you wanna skip the video in the beginning, type -novid after -h 768
