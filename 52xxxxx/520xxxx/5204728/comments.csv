I then proceeded to read as much of his stuff as I could find and enjoyed most of it very much."

,Zerp271,2010-02-08T08:25Z,Thank you so much for uploading this at a reasonable quality. Most audiobooks I'm looking for are about 64kb/s.
,Zenophobe,2010-05-14T13:48Z,"I dl'd the movie months ago and tried watching it one night and 1/3 way through it depressed the hell out of me and I stopped watching it.  Every now and then I would ask myself if I was ready to finish the movie and then I finally did...  and then I found out it was first a novel and hailed as one of the best in modern American fiction.   And now I'm pissed off.  There was once a time when I would have been more likely to hear about the book and read it first.  Now I'm a PC using vegetable.  Anyways, thanks for the torrents hahaha....."
