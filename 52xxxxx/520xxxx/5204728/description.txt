THE ROAD
Cormac McCarthy

New territory for McCarthy: a post apocalyptic landscape where readers meet a man who recalls a better world and a boy who doesnâ€™t. With all the trademarks of vintage McCarthyâ€”a man and his young son, a blasted American landscape, sparse prose that is at once brutal and tenderâ€”"The Road" further cements McCarthyâ€™s stature as one of Americaâ€™s greatest living novelists.
