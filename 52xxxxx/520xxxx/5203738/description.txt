+----------------------------------[Notes]-----------------------------------+
|                                                                            |
|  Having introduced the 2.0 version of Tantric on record with 2008's The    |
|  End Begins (with founding members and ex-Days of the New members Todd     |
|  Whitener, Jesse Vest, and Matt Taul all having become ex-members of       |
|  Tantric too), lead singer Hugo Ferreira doesn't seem to have felt there   |
|  was any reason to wait the usual three years before releasing another     |
|  album, and so Mind Control follows only 15 months later. (And really, in  |
|  the music business environment of the 2000s, in which the sales life of   |
|  an album is much abbreviated from previous decades, why not?) His backup  |
|  musicians may have been replaced since 2007 (and the drum chair has now   |
|  passed to a third man, Richie Monica, with Marcus Ratzenboeck joining on  |
|  electric violin), but Ferreira still positions Tantric squarely in the    |
|  post-grunge tradition of peers like System of a Down, Linkin Park, and,   |
|  especially, Nickelback, placing his sonorous, husky baritone over tracks  |
|  that sometimes border on heavy metal, but usually retain a melodic hard   |
|  rock flavor. He sneaks in some of his own piano playing, notably on the   |
|  intro and outro to "Coming Undone," and gives some rein to guitarist Joe  |
|  Pessia, who does Eddie Van Halen-style shredding on "Coming Undone";      |
|  contributes attractive acoustic work on the power ballad "The Past Is     |
|  the Past"; and enjoys his own showcase on the guitar interlude            |
|  "Intermezzo," when he isn't simply crunching big riffs. So, there are at  |
|  least hints that Ferreira and his new bandmates have ambitions beyond     |
|  their genre, but there are also some more potential entries in            |
|  Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart here.                                   |
|                                                                            |
