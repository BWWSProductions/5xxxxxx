,illcadaver,2009-12-27T23:50Z,why does it have to be in .rar?
,Pandora03,2009-12-29T13:33Z,this is the only S03E04 available atm... I want .avi please!!!
[T],an0nimuz,2010-01-02T06:20Z,"What is wrong with you people crying about RAR?

They are not ""bullshit"" nor do they prohibit this release from working. The release *is* legit, and works perfectly fine. Download 7zip (freeware) if you need a program to extract RARs.

noobs really make my head hurt."
[T],an0nimuz,2010-01-02T06:21Z,Pandora03: It is an AVI compressed in RAR. So.. it's AVI. ffs.
,Pandora03,2010-01-15T03:24Z,"an0nimuz: yes, I know. I prefer not to mess with 7zip, just another process to go through.

I'm assuming the other posters are aware of what rars are and what to do with them, but feel the same way I do... just a guess, since you can google rar and get all your answers. They're smart enough to use bit torrents. I don't see a comment anywhere that claims this isn't a *legit* download. The only noobs are the ones that flame (aka pee on things to claim their territory in order to feel superior). Take some Ibuprofen for that headache."
,FTPB,2010-01-25T17:17Z,"I love rar, in my opinion it is greatly superior to zip, and with a little common sense is so much easier to use.

However upon downloading this, I am getting this error at 98%:

Error: Data Error (cyclic redundancy check).

Little help?"
