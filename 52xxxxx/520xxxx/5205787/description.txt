    This software is used to back up data and to synchronize PCs,         
    servers, and notebooks. The settings are stored in multiple           
    profiles, and the software comes with support for FTP servers, ZIP    
    compression, data encryption, and a scheduler for automated           
    backups. On Windows NT/2000 or higher, the scheduler can run as a     
    service - without users having to log on. This file                   
    synchronization tool features the ability to freely select files      
    and folders across the whole folder hierarchy in tree-views and it    
    has support for e-mail notification, profile categories, and          
    various filters.

      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      
      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
