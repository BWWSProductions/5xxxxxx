After a couple of months SFFS starts complaining the evaluating period is over and the keygen doesn't help at all. SFFS needs a working crack! CORE can you hear me?"

I have it up and running just fine now although I am aware that some users experience the ""evaluating period is over"" issue after a few months. I had exactly that on a Mac with the Mac version...
Keep you posted on how this one works out after a few months...
Cheers !"
