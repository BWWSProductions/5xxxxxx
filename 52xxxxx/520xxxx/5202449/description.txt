My first torrent.  Hope it suits everyone.  Please let me know if I'm doing anything wrong.

Since this is a live album, I didn't split up the tracks, but a cue file is included.  Very thin on the artwork; no access to a scanner.  Sorry about that.

EAC log file shows album not in AccurateRip database, but it is a genuine copy!  I bought it from the store myself!

One of the best live albums from the 70s.  Enjoy!
