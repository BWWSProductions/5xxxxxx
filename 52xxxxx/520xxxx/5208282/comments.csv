Thanks, but I'll stick to the scans of #1-2 released by OllietheOx-GreenGiant-DCP (part of the DCP 25/11 pack). It would be nice however to have all the covers in this torrent as a separate download though...

Anyway, it's awesome you loved this enough to scan and share it, but I guess you need to look into how to best optimize your scans. Cheers! :)"

Any tips for future scans??? Thanks!!!"
