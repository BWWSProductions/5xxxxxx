"Kill Audio is the tale of an immortal little man, seeking out his purpose in life by traipsing across a hip musical landscape with his wildly eccentric, sarcastic posse. Created by Claudio Sanchez of the band Coheed and Cambria with art by the up and coming Sheldon Vella."

This scan is all 6 covers and is also cover to cover, so no one misses out on anything they would have got by reading the actual comic.
(I'm just OCD :D)

I tried looking for these online and hoped someone would scan them, but I haven't seen anything yet. So I'm scanning them so I could have them on my computer for easier reading. I figured I'd start uploading them as well to share with everyone. I'm sure theres a few people out there that'd love to have these scans.
This is issue one of six. I wish I had more time to scan but duty calls... I'm scanning issue two right now, I'll probably finish it tonight after work and up it when done.
I hope everyone enjoys!!!
