Practically the same as: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5191265/Prince_of_Persia_4_Mac
except this time there are no annoying .rar files giving you errors when you try to unpack them, just the single .dmg file.

If you already have downloaded the other torrent, try a couple of different programs (like UnRarX, WinRAR, 7-Zip) and make sure you used the correct password: Codez4maccom case sensitive and a dot between the two c's.
If it still doesn't work, then you can download this torrent.

To install:
- Mount the .dmg
- Copy to hdd
- Play (it will prompt you to update, click "yes" and let it install)

The update apparently fixes a graphical problem

No need to worry about cracks or serials.

Thanks to salfanar for the original torrent, to bad about the problems, hopefully this will work for more people.
