,Cajar_Queen,2009-12-20T04:52Z,"Shit of a game
My macs requirements are way beyond the minimum requirements and exceed the recommended requirements as well, yet this game plays like total crap. No matter what level of detail set to the vocals and SFX are noticeably out of sync and movement of the character is sluggish and laggy."
,gunslingerkenny,2009-12-30T22:42Z,did you download the patch? 
,bkar89,2010-02-22T03:24Z,"@ Cajar_Queen... its bad port... use bootcamp to install windows, and get the windows version of the game, it should run smooth there"
