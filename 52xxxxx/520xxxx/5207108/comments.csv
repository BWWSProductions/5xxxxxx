,HR-PiZ,2009-12-12T02:22Z,"HR, if you still haven't watched, don't bother. i LOVE sandra bullock and thought this movie actively blew. after a pretty good start (very funny in parts), it falls off a cliff while screaming. producers and director were doing meth, obviously."
,hagriddenrules,2009-12-12T05:27Z,"holy roses is like a messiah to the people like us with slower connection.

Ya Could you please upload The Descent Part 2?"

,chuac,2009-12-13T09:56Z,Another quality HR upload. Hope you haven't forgot about American Pie: The Book of Love. :D
,hagriddenrules,2009-12-13T15:23Z,"Holy Roses, man i am stuck in 55 percent downloading bedtime stories ....one one your great uploads.
It's enough with the jerks like us asking for the favor from you ....but could you please seed it for some time...perhaps a day only.

If you couldn't it's okay man ....cause it's already been enough you are doing for us."
,hagriddenrules,2009-12-14T06:08Z,Thanks Holyroses and signalboy...waiting for the seed was good idea....it's getting downloaded now....very slow but at least i now hope it will  finish.
,hagriddenrules,2009-12-14T06:12Z,"If holyroses could upload the movie ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in his small sized but great quality style .....it would be great because i always wanted to see this movie but the ones available are like 2 or 3 GB big ones.

Please don't mind....hahaha."
,phony200,2009-12-14T11:18Z,"Thanks a lot, Holyroses rocks!"
,dlectro,2009-12-16T08:52Z,"Nice torrents HolyRoses.
Could you encode Surrogates for handheld in non-anamorphic?"
,dlectro,2009-12-16T15:31Z,"signalboy you misunderstood.
I didn't say HR uploaded any anamorphic films.
I asked if HR could encode Surrogates in non-anamorphic , because i couldn't find Surrogates by HR.
The 2 handheld versions I could find were encoded by others and both were anamorphic, thus looked distorted on the iPod Touch."
,dlectro,2009-12-16T17:21Z,"Again, I didn't say anything about me defining the proper source, so no need for that attitude, HR.

Besides, your torrents are great, thanks for upping."
,JayZor,2009-12-20T15:53Z,"Any chance of getting Zombieland, HolyRoses ?"
