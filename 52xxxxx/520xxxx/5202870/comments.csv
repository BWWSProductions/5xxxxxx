,casaddams,2009-12-08T15:28Z,I confirm: it's E06. Episode 5 is still missing.
,cstever3,2009-12-09T09:27Z,"Confirmed.  This is episode 6.  Still looking for 5.
Thanks for the good work so far though!"
,baconninja,2009-12-10T02:47Z,Anbody know where episode 5 is?
,calluout,2009-12-13T13:38Z,Thank you for uploading! But yes this IS episode 6. Does anybody have 5? I can't watch this ep until I've seen 5 because I don't want to miss anything. 
,spunkster,2011-11-10T20:01Z,"I concur, this is episode 6! I was mislabelled. Very frustrating. Would love to find episode 5. That's where James tells Jennifer (Penny Flame) he wants to rape her, and Kari Ann the kunt paints a portrait of where she was left behind a dumpster and when her b'f held a gun to her head (boo hoo, he should've finished the job). "
,spunkster,2011-11-10T20:07Z,"Guys, I know it's not ideal, but the real episode 5 is available streaming (with fucking ADS) here: http://www.vh1.com/video/sex-rehab-with-dr-drew/full-episodes/episode-5/1626876/playlist.jhtml

Not sure if it will be available forever but it's better than not missing it completely."

,honkyjesuseternal,2012-02-19T06:04Z,"Thanks for RARS, asshole.

Quit putting this shit up and acting like it makes sense to case them like that."
