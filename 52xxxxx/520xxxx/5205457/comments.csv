,rejoice001,2010-01-07T03:59Z,if they ask for any patent activation.. go to program files then to common files after that you will find a Advrcntr4 there u find a patentactivation file rename it into patentactivation.old. thats all.... after that they will not ask u for any patent activation... bye..

,awolfman,2010-01-16T21:52Z,"Hey guys,

i see a lot of people are having trouble with nero 9.

1. Just download nero 9.4.26 trial version and execute the file.

2. It will come up with a text box and a demo serial key. DELETE the key and paste this
9M03-01A5-0WA4-5TAA-KA2P-8WZ5-CLA7-6122

3. Proceed with the installation, its very slow

4. After installation, go to Start>Nero>Nero Control Center 4

5. On the left side, click on license, there you have it, it shows expiration NONE.

I found this key at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5280328/Nero_9_full_version_license_retail_by_ebookking.

P.S. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN ANTIVIRUS cause most people are getting viruses. Its not uncommon to get a virus from a keygen

Thank you and please pass on this info to others having trouble.

Oh and thanks for uploading "

,GRACIE88,2010-02-02T02:20Z,"Like 2 others said ,,,,when you go to use the burner the Patent prevents you from using the program...even though it states in the license its not a trial....changed the patent file name to patentactivation.old. and  patentactivation.old with no luck..i will dl the serial in the torrent and see if that works. If any one can help with a legit copy pls email me  gracie_21_60@hotmail.com...would appreciate it alot...ty"
