        LogPlot has been used by geoscientists since 1983 to      
    display their geotechnical, environmental,               
      geophysical, mud/gas, and mining data as a graphic        
      boring log. LogPlot offers almost unlimited               
    flexibility for log layout via its easy-to-use,            
    built-in Log Designer. With a WYSIWYG, point-and-click   
   interface, LogPlot s Log Designer makes it easy to          
    customize logs for different clients and projects.           
        Field data can be entered into LogPlot s Data Editor      
    using the keyboard, copy/paste, data collection,         
      and/or import tools (LAS, RockWorks, Excel, ASCII,        
      DBF). Multiple libraries of soil and rock types are       
    included with LogPlot, and you can easily customize        
    them to suit your company s needs. Compile the data in   
   to the design at any vertical scale for singe-page,         
    multi-page, or continuous logs. Distribute the free          
        LogView program with your logs so your clients can        
    view and print your LogPlot logs. Or, create HTML log    
      pages or JPG, BMP, TIFF, PNG, WMF and EMF images.
