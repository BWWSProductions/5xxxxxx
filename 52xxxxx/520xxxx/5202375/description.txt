another amazing tubeway army 1979 video


by the way, if you need more Gary Numan there are two excellent things to get: 

1) on avaxhome . ws search for "numan" and you'll find two extraordinary vinyl->flac rips of "Replicas" and "The Pleasure Principle" - they sound superb (user aksman)

2) on sharedmp3 . net there is a flac rip of the truly great "The Complete John Peel Sessions" - get it asap :)


please be patient with this as my upload is slow, and stick around and seed a bit if you can after you get it :)
