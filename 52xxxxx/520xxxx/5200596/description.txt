~~ KAO the Kangaroo by Bart ~~

1. Install the game

2. The game will not run because of the Laserlok protection, to solve this replace the kao.exe with the one from the patch directory.

>> THIS DOESN'T MEAN THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED WITHOUT CD, THIS ONLY SOLVES THE LASERLOK PROBLEM. YOU STILL HAVE TO MOUNT/BURN THE IMAGE. <<

3. Enjoy!
