[T],Dodecahedron9,2009-12-09T10:31Z,"Bullshit, the file is complete, read the info: 44mn 25s. It is compressed because a 350mb filesize was redundant, I compressed it myself. If it is not a HDTV rip, a 350mb file is completely pointless."
,Afsender_Ukendt,2009-12-09T10:38Z,"Well, I just watched it, and it was only 31 minutes, so keep your pants on"
,Afsender_Ukendt,2009-12-09T10:50Z,"I just downloaded it again, and now it's 44 minutes. Seems utorrent f'ed up.

I apologize to you uploader, and thank you for upping it.

Sorry"
[T],Dodecahedron9,2009-12-09T10:51Z,No problem
[T],Dodecahedron9,2009-12-09T22:06Z,"I uploaded Episode 4 here:

,FileError420,2009-12-09T23:40Z,"Thanks a lot for this, was searching forever. 
Not complaining but why did you compress it so much? Ep. 1&2 were much better quality but I guess it's good enough for a reality show.

Thanks again!!"
[T],Dodecahedron9,2009-12-10T00:07Z,"Hi, you're welcome!. The thing is, when you download a 350mb file you expect certain type of quality that these files didn't have. Omicron released the first two episodes but then for some reason stopped doing that. Episodes 3 and 4 are not official releases and also not from a hdtv quality source, they're just standard tvrips. Nevertheless, I can assure there's no more than 5-10% quality loss between the original 350mb files and these ones, even on a big screen. I compared both files from beginning to end and the 350mb ones were just unnecessary bloated. These ones have been slightly cropped but the quality is almost just as good as the original ones."
