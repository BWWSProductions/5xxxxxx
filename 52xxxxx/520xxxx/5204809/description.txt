Call of Duty - Modern Warfare 2 (Wrapper Only).

Need a copy of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 game.

Requirements
Mac OS version: OS X 10.4.11+
Min. Processor: Intel Core Solo
Min RAM: 1 GB
Video RAM: 128 MB
Harddisk space: 12 GB

Installation (These instructions are also in the .rar file)

1.  First, you need to have CXZ Black Diamond Wrapper installed
     -The file needed to install it is included.  Its called CXZEngines.zip.
     -To install CXZ Black Diamond:
           -First, open CXZ Engines.mpkg.
           -Second, Click continue.
           -Third, make sure CXZ Black Diamond Engine is checked (The other engines are for other games. If you want to install them its up to you.)
           -Fourth, click continue.
           -Fifth, click Install.

2. Second, Install the Game inside Windows (or download another Mac Version and extract the game files) and then place them inside the wrapper: 
            -Right Click~Show Package Contents/SharedSupport/CrossOverGames/support/default/drive_c/Program Files/ 
            -Make sure the folder's called Activision/Modern Warfare 2/ and the exe is either a cracked one or a cracked one from inside the NoDVDs folder.
                       -NoDVDs folder is found inside the Extras folder in the "Modern Warfare 2 CXZ Black Diamond Wrapper.dmg"

For people who have NVIDIA graphics cards this should complete your installation.  For ATi graphics card go to 3.

3. For ATi Graphics Card Users
     -Navigate to the ATi Graphics User folder inside Extras Folder which is located in the "Modern Warfare 2 CXZ Black Diamond Wrapper.dmg"
     -Place the 3 .reg files from inside CMW2ATiRegs into:
             -Right Click~Show Package Contents/SharedSupport/CrossOverGames/support/default/
     -This will replace the 3 .reg files already located there.
