http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5161584/modern_warfare_2

so...what file should i put on ""Program Files"" folder?"
,nasius,2009-12-09T18:18Z,"This wrapper does start the game. However in my case I end up with completely distorted graphics. Intro part is ok, but the actual graphics is totally messed up. It's same wether lowest graphics settings are set or moderate or highest.

what did u do in step 2?? im lost in that part"
,nasius,2009-12-09T18:45Z,I copied game files from CoD pack for Nvidia. Moved everything from Program Files/Activision into same directory in a wrapper from this pack.
,jrpp207,2009-12-09T18:53Z,"sorry but what do u mean with ""game files from Cod for Nvidia"" ... sorry could u be more specific ...I Really need ur help "
,mnstrptrl,2009-12-09T19:02Z,"It's not letting me modify the wrapper, so even if I was sure what I had to do in step 2, I couldn't."
,jrpp207,2009-12-09T19:05Z,"""mnstrptrl""


Are u trying to modify it without copying it to ur hard drive?"
,jrpp207,2009-12-09T19:06Z,HELP! with step 2! plz!!!1
,zzanko,2009-12-09T19:32Z,"Same as nasius, intro is fine but graphics are partly invisible. iMac 2,4 GHz, ATI Radeon HD 2400"
,jrpp207,2009-12-09T19:45Z,"""zzanko""

What did u do?? im trying to do step 2 but i cant...i dontknow really what i have to do...can u explain me?"
,jrpp207,2009-12-09T19:52Z,Help with step 2... i really dont know what i have to do... I have Nvidia Graphic card.. stuck in step 2!
,zzanko,2009-12-09T19:56Z,jrpp207 just copy activision folder from game to wrapper: contents/resources/transgaming/c_drive/Program files or Programme
[T],ctang,2009-12-09T20:05Z,"@zzanko

actually you need to put it in:
Contents/SharedSupport/CrossOverGames/support/default/drive_c/Program Files/"
,BW31,2009-12-09T20:12Z,"Ok everything is working fine, except for some ""DirectX errors"" that make the game quit. So far, mission 2 and 5 aren't playable. But jeez, the other one ROCK
If you're stuck because of these error just select the next mission

Step 2 :
The .rar contains a ""Modern Warfare 2 CXZ Black Diamond Wrapper.dmg.zip""
Unzip it, mount the disc image.
In this disc image, you have the wrapper and the ""extra"" file that will help you for the further steps ( or not )

Take the files from your original game contents to the wrapper ( as it said in the help )

ctang, you're my hero "
,zzanko,2009-12-09T20:13Z,"ctang yes that's the path to copy activision folder, but as i said graphics are mostly invisible, but if you turn mouse right or left you can get better view, just for a second"
,BW31,2009-12-09T20:26Z,"Huh ... There's actually a lot of fucked up missions because of the ""DirectX errors""
If someone could find any fix about that... I'd build a temple for him"
,BW31,2009-12-09T20:27Z,Btw : ATI Radeon HD 2400 Mac OS X 10.5.6
,zzanko,2009-12-09T20:36Z,"BW31 same as my iMac, but i'm on 10.6.2... but i can't play anything because graphics sucks"
,stueee123,2009-12-09T21:16Z,graphics are all weird for me too. wat can i do???
,jrpp207,2009-12-09T21:19Z,BUT what files should i put in the wrapper?? form the originla game...the contents carpet? or whats inside of the contents carpet?
,jrpp207,2009-12-09T21:21Z,just for the record... i have Nvidia graphic card
,paperboat,2009-12-10T00:50Z,Can't load any maps due to DirecX error. I followed all the instructions using ATI Radeon HD2400
,awmt102,2009-12-10T02:10Z,"I have a copy of the PC COD MW2 DVD and have installed into crossover, but there is no Activision\Modern Warfare2\ folder. Can anyone tell me where to find the game files?"
,kubasuchy,2009-12-10T09:44Z,"aye, it's working but the graphics make the game inplayable. :("
,BW31,2009-12-10T17:40Z,"@jrpp207

You have to put the files from the original ""Modern Warfare 2"" ( which are in ""content"" ) inside the ""Modern Warfare 2"" in the wrapper's ""content""

@paperboat

You should be able to load at least the first map and some other ones ( The one in the favelas for example ).

For those who are having graphic issues. Have you replaced the .reg files ?"
,BW31,2009-12-10T18:47Z,"I downloaded the game from the torrent in this list and I'm encountering problems with DirectX. But the game still works, at least for some missions...

Maybe our Cider Heroes will upload a fully fonctional wrapper and game as a Christmas gift =D ?"
,zzanko,2009-12-10T19:01Z,"For now it's better to play PC game on Parallels, try SKIDROW realese on win XP, it works, not perfect, in 800X500 resolution"
,BW31,2009-12-10T19:36Z,Huh ... Any link ?
,paperboat,2009-12-10T23:15Z,"Nope, I're tried all the levels. Using SKIDROW and the ATi fixes."
,stueee123,2009-12-11T01:22Z,"graphics are still weird, i def did all the steps. i need help!"
,LakeOfSorrow,2009-12-12T01:08Z,Totally useless... Do not download!
,MPFO,2009-12-12T04:17Z,"Played all the levels, working perfectly"
,BoneCrush3r,2009-12-12T12:15Z,"does this work for intel core duo? i have ATI graphic 2600

does this work for me?"
,BW31,2009-12-12T12:39Z,"@MPFO

Did you have any DirectX error ?
What kind of graphic card have you ?"
,mnstrptrl,2009-12-12T16:46Z,"I'm damn close, but the game had to quit before it reached the first loading screen, and now it quits unexpectedly before starting up.  I've successfully completed all the steps, and am not sure what to do."
,LakeOfSorrow,2009-12-12T17:04Z,"I'm using the mac version uploaded by bigdaddyrob2g. Is that ok? Because I followed every step and it doesn't even start at all (before doing anything, if I click the wrapper at least it opened and icon sticked to dock for a few seconds before closing). Mac OS 10.5.8 in a Intel Core Duo 2,66Ghz, 2Gb RAM, ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro."
,mnstrptrl,2009-12-12T20:04Z,"I played through the first level, and it looks amazing, no graphics problems here.  However, some sort of DirectX error prevents me from playing past that."
,Tazay,2009-12-13T08:01Z,"I spent 3 weeks downloading the first MAC OSX cider to find it doesnt work, now I have to download this? Wow. Why not just upload it all at once as one file, then no one will mess up the steps."
,Tazay,2009-12-13T08:21Z,How do I get this on the Bigdaddyrob version?
,Tomliem,2009-12-14T14:09Z,can someone please tell me what to do in step 2?? and has anyone got it working with the propper graphics? i got the newest imac 3 ghz nvidea 9400

,Tomliem,2009-12-14T18:47Z,ok all works except for the graphics accelaration it's just not using the 3d engine of my nvidea 9400! this way the game looks crap and not fun to play!! anyone thinks there is going to be a solution?? thanks anyway for the effort!
,BoneCrush3r,2009-12-14T18:58Z,"it works, but it doesnt work how i want it to work...its slow the graphic isnt nice...its not fun to play this game like that...sometimes the game ends because of an ''Wine'' error or something like that...this shit realy makes me mad...I saw it working really thought yeaah haleluja! but it works like shit...can somebody make it better?"

,adidassj,2009-12-16T08:28Z,"anyone else getting this error upon application launch?

""Error during initialization:
Video card or driver doesn't support vertex shader 3.0 or better.""

I'm running it on a macbook pro intel core duo, 2.16ghz, 2gb ram and ati radeonx1600 video card.

Figured i can bypass this by changing the game settings, yet i'm unable to get to the game itself. Only startup image displays until error message appears."
,Tomliem,2009-12-16T11:04Z,"@ctang can you also look into the graphics? or is that something that can't be fixt? it seems like i can't use the game 3d engine... no texture details etc.. installed the wrapper etc but still nothing.. can only play in ""normal"" mode.. thanks anyway"
,BW31,2009-12-16T14:23Z,"Thanks Ctang ! Thanks a LOT ! Btw, updating DirectX to its last version doesn't change anything"

,scifygreg,2010-02-08T07:03Z,"@all of the dumbfucks complaining about the graphics problem
           its not something wrong with the program, its the fact that your computer is too shitty to run the program, it doesnt matter how ""amazing"" your processor is, it all depends on your GRAPHICS CARD (you know, that thing you plug the monitor into)"
