,Catfishy,2009-12-24T13:08Z,"To clarify people, this release is NOT his new album he said he was going to release. That album, Relapse 2, is postponed until 2010 sometime. These are bonus tracks that didn't make the original Relapse album, and have been released by Em. An ad-on album if you like.

Thanks for the upload though :)
