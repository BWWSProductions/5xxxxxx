This is power of god stuff.  This is a tiny little app that will closes all open windows. It is an executable so you can pin it to just about anything. I use it on my rocket dock (whitch is where i got it).  You can assign a hot key to it, you can put it on the quick launch bar. Oh well you get the idea.  ENJOy!!
