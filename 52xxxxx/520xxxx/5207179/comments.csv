PLEASE SEED!!!"
,robwind,2010-03-18T22:19Z,Anyone who wants to get this dvd can still do it even though there are no seeders I have 43% and the other peer has 90% together we have 1.3 copies. The problem is we're having really slow (dial-up) connection speed so it going to take a while for either of us to get it. But if other people dl it should come in on a better speed if you can get a solid connection with one of us.
,robwind,2010-03-19T12:54Z,"Nooo! Come back 90% percent dude I.... I love you!!! Seriously come back, it's not the size of your bandwidth it's how you use your network!! Oh shit I guess I'm fucked now. Scratch that previous comment."
,robwind,2010-04-02T22:06Z,Wow finally got it which was freaking awesome... but I 'm pretty sure this file is corrupt or the files that are in the .iso where corrupt before this was made into a disc image. First I burned it using image burn; when I tried to preview the cell for the layer break burn the video was choppy and distorted and then the program crashed. Disc burned OK but it won't load in power DVD and the menus and the video are all distorted. So I extracted the VIDEO_TS folder and all it's contents to my HD and then burn it to a disc and it's still is exactly the same. I will continue to seed but I'm  telling you first that I wasted over 16 GB of bandwidth and two dual layer discs on this torrent so far. I have over two dozen dvd rips on dual layer that work perfectly so I pretty sure this is a waste of time. If you dl this torrent and have the same problems please comment so no one else wastes time and bandwidth on this. Thanks ;)
