         Gratuitous Space Battles v1.25 RIP incl Tribe Expansion Pack       
#

#
   Release Notes:
#
 
#
   Who needs backstory? Who needs resource-gathering? Diplomacy is so       
#
   last year. Gratuitous Space Battles cuts right to the chase of sci-fi   
#
   strategy games, and deals with large, completely unjustified space       
#
   battles between huge opposing space fleets.                             
#
                                                                           
#
   Gratuitous Space Battles combines the visual appeal of an RTS, with     
#
   the addictive unit-placement and design gameplay from tower defense     
#
   games. In GSB, the player does not control individual ships at all       
#
   during battle. The ships fight to a pre-determined set of orders and     
#
   formations given to them by you before the battles.                     
#
