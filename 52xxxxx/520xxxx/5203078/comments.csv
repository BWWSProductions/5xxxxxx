,Quantum12,2010-03-04T18:53Z,"For centuries now, people have been indoctrinated into the notion that competition is BENEFICIAL to the species. It's insane.

People actually believe that working against each other is the best thing for humanity. They are brainwashed into thinking that fighting for the same small portion of resources passed down from the top of the pyramid is the smartest thing to do.

How much longer will people be this stupid? When will they learn that the entire purpose of dividing us is precisely so that we can never rise to facilitate change? There is no trust because everyone wants the same jobs, the same resources and the same small percentage of wealth. Over 95 percent of the world?s wealth is owned by less than 1 percent of the population.

The answer to fighting crime isn?t to put more police on the streets. Crime can only be defeated by removing the inequality that gives people the incentive to commit it in the first place. Politicians know this but are trapped in the system just like everybody else. Political success requires massive amounts of funding to be pumped into campaigns and advertising. I assure you that the poor don?t pay for this.

When will people learn who their enemies are?

Did slavery end, or did it just evolve into something more nefarious and cunning?

I say wake the fuck up. It starts with you, America. Evil happens when good men do nothing. Capitalism must end or the human race will not survive.

P.S. There are three things you can do to help.

1) The system isolates people from one another by giving them conflicting interests from their competition. The way it hides this is by uniting the people in hatred of something else.

Unity is everything provided we face the right enemy. Tell people who the enemy is. They will not believe you, so be patient and persist. Do not let ignorance destroy us.

2) Do not have anything to do with the military.

The military takes orders from the government, but the government takes orders from the banking industry. War is about profit because the system is a business and not a charity. The best way to convince men to fight is to make them want to fight. Think about it. 

Don?t fall for the jingoism bullshit. There are no great pieces of land, just great people.

3) Know your enemy.

The system that lets most people suffer in poverty and a few to wallow in self-indulgence because of bloodline or blind luck is the enemy. This is the same system the Romans used, and will end in the same way. The greed of a few is holding back evolution for the rest.

The heart of the enemy is the banking industry. The banking industry perpetuates debt and most horrifyingly of all, it keeps people static. It weighs them down with car loans, mortgages, personal finance, stock options, credit cards, overdrafts etc..... The point is to keep you in permanent debt, and therefore an employee of the bank until you die. Everybody works for the banks: the only difference lies between those that know it and those that don?t.

Strike the heart."
,Sennec,2010-04-18T18:26Z,What's the password for printing Phil Gordon's little green book?
,Sennec,2010-04-18T18:26Z,For printing any of the pdf's actually?
,hiobazard,2010-04-25T06:13Z,"@Quantum12 your a fucking moron, use the comment space to comment on the torrent not to try and give some great life insight. This is a torrent about poker books not about the government or anything else, so as a summary fuck off."
,The__Dude_,2010-05-15T05:12Z,You seem very naive Quantum. People will be as lazy as you let them be. That's why capitalism works. Look at the hippie communes and tell me you're right
,Brainsnack,2010-06-02T03:11Z,@Quantum12yearold: Please go worship your mother's monobrow.
,flyer27,2010-06-18T07:33Z,Thanks for the book!! Can anyone give me a site to download free Romance ebooks for my wife? Thanks in advance.
,irj2,2010-06-18T21:57Z,"Almost an ecletic collection of books, but for me - SPOILT by the ""HOT-LINKED"" ads for 'party-poker' and 'full-tilt' poker.

The ads' are everywhere, the begining of books, the ends of books and every few pages throughout the books.

One so-called 'book' is 5 pages long - one page of text and 4 pages of ads!!!!!

Question 1. Why so many ads'?
Question 2. Why no warning of the ads'?
Question 3. Why is 'Neurology and Neurosurgery Illustrated' included, also with poker ads' ?
Question 4. Do these poker sites know they are actively sponsoring file-sharing?
Question 5. Mark - are you a co-owner of these poker sites or otherwise involved.

Sorry but too many ads' and hotlinks. I have now deleted all of them.

Any one thinking of using this torrent, think twice.

In summary, this torrent is an abuse of the trust given and expected of TPB members."
,MusiciansDuetBetter,2010-08-03T14:05Z,Thanks for uploading. You're a gentleman and a scholar.
,hollywill21,2010-08-09T20:29Z,Dude this is so sick! I am starting to play poker and this is amazing!
,united_WE_stand,2010-08-22T06:28Z,"@Quantum12 - thank you, very insightful writing at the right place at the right time. 


@hiobazard - what is wrong with you?

@The__Dude_ - you are the naive one sir. "
,bronik90,2010-09-06T05:10Z,"@united_WE_stand - fuck off troll. same goes for your queer friend quantum. as for the torrent, its mainly ads, not worth the bandwidth"
,ichxmir,2010-12-15T15:31Z,"ok guys, how am i gonna find the right download link to finally get the fu**in' download"
,Doowangle,2011-01-28T05:16Z,"Seriously, why does everyone online think people care about their political opinions? Yes we get it, you are a young adult discovering philosophies. Unlike everyone else though, YOU have it all figured out. Everyone is so proud of you and REALLY cares to listen. 

Go die in a fire"
,IQ98,2011-02-24T19:29Z,How can I write out the books on my printer?
,beeftv,2011-11-20T04:56Z,"Not very good.

Some of this is just printouts of websites.

Most of the pdfs are scanned, and not done very well. The words close to the fold can be hard to read. Some have not even been cropped. They include a big black area around them.

All the ""books"" have had an advertisement prepended.

So just don't expect nice quality. It is what it is."
,beeftv,2011-11-20T04:58Z,"Not only are these ads prepended. They are also plastered inside the books, every some number of pages.

Combined with the extremely low quality, this torrent is complete SHIT.

Don't bother."
,MOVIEFREAK5685,2011-12-01T08:03Z,"WARNING !
All books are password protected you can only read them and cannot do any thing like print tmen etc .
What bullshit!!!!"
,khanli,2012-04-11T18:19Z,I found real poker training on this site: http://poker.kirstu.fi Good luck guys!
