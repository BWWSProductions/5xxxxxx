You Rock!"
[T],Dodecahedron9,2009-12-09T23:47Z,"You're welcome. Yes I love the show, I will upload the new episodes as soon as I get them :)"

[T],Dodecahedron9,2009-12-10T12:35Z,"You're welcome. Top chef....I have only watched the past two seasons...and the last one was quite boring. Both shows have similar points but I find Chef Academy more interesting...also, that bread with cheese recipe was priceless :)"
,hurga,2009-12-11T14:35Z,thank you so much for this. I was looking for new episodes for the last two weeks on a daily basis. you are the man!
[T],Dodecahedron9,2009-12-12T11:39Z,"My pleasure. Same here, it was frustrating. All shows are ending now, so maybe Omicron or another group can provide us with HD eps for the rest of the season. In either case, tvrips are likely to show up in time from now on. Crossing my fingers :)"
