,noona72,2010-02-09T15:00Z,Thank you for this!  I've been looking for it for years.  I'm seeding.
,Tropius__B,2010-12-03T01:14Z,"I don't see any AVI files in here.
Just a bunch of those same damned .rar files.

Will try not to have to download this version, because if I do, I sure as hell am not seeding it - I have no good reason to keep two copies on the hard drive.

Also, for files under 1GB, there is absolutely no legitimate reason to use RAR for a torrent in the first place. This isn't usenet for crying out loud."

Are you certain you are talking about the right torrent?

This one has one file in it:

The.Philadelphia.Experiment.[1984].DVDRip.XviD-BLiTZKRiEG.avi	700.2 MiB"
