Fire and Skill - The Songs of the Jam is a compilation of hit songs written by Mod Revival band The Jam. Each track on the album is performed by a different artist or band.

Buffalo Tom singer/guitarist Bill Janovitz was surprised to have the chance to do "Going Underground," saying that his band usually had to be content with doing also-ran songs on compilations such as this. Janovitz said he felt like playing the song in his band's usual style sounded way too much like The Jam, so he and his bandmates reinterpreted it in a slower, less manic style. Janovitz added that this was the first time his band had experimented with loops. 

Fire and Skill - The Songs Of The Jam una un album compilatoria de las mejores canciones de The Jam. Cada canciÃ³n en el disco es tocada por diferentes artistas.
