,davebaxter1989,2009-12-10T19:20Z,Just want to say to anyone that says this is fake (which it could be) its not because its not possible the DVD was released on Monday despite only two having aired. Here's hoping its real.
,baines77,2009-12-10T20:31Z,can anyone confirm these episodes are real before i download?? really want episodes 3-6. hope they are!!
,NandoDando,2009-12-10T22:14Z,"IT IS REAL-- Don't start a scare before anyone's even downloaded and there are only 2 seeders you arse-- I've finished downloading all the these torrents by Rachie85 are real. 

Quality is HD and I've been looking for ages for this torrent(such dicks that think everyone is stupid but them on the internet)(davebaxter1989)"
,cspot78,2009-12-11T00:59Z,what happened to the seed? 
,didak30,2009-12-11T01:16Z,fake could not get to work
,sevilalucard,2009-12-11T03:10Z,"yeah dont listen to didak30, hes got no clue what the fuck hes talking about all these episodes are real just stop your download at anypoint and see for yourself. just need the seed to return and finish upload plz thanks"
,davebaxter1989,2009-12-11T13:43Z,"@nandodando I actually think your that dick your talking about as my comment was in response to a comment that has since been deleted that said ""FAKE"". Also it was posted just as I started downloading and since I have since got 4 to finish I can confirm real. So yeah fuck you too."
,davebaxter1989,2009-12-11T13:48Z,Oh and also if you finished as you claim then seed.
,aestus,2009-12-11T13:58Z,"The DVD of series 3 was released in the UK not so long ago so this is a real dvdrip of series 3. It's a strange thing to do, but with christmas coming, it does make a little sense to do it this way, and shit loads of people will buy it jus so they can see the rest of the series without having to wait.

If you're finished downloading, seed the fucking file until a few others are one you selfish cunts"
,Rachie85,2009-12-11T14:07Z,"Nobody is being a selfish cunt, I've been seeding it all day but its going quite slow. Please be patient. "
,NandoDando,2009-12-11T14:17Z,"dave I care so little, please hold your breath till my next post"
,Rachie85,2009-12-11T14:26Z,lol
,aestus,2009-12-11T15:40Z,"selfish cunt is a bit strong, my apologies."
,klayton88,2009-12-11T17:58Z,"not 1 single seeder? what the hell is going on, surley somebody has it downloaded by now??? im stuck at 71% after 2h 25m with a download speed of no more than 1KB/S

c'mon people"
,yorkiejason,2009-12-12T01:21Z,"Cheers mate, 100% perfect....shame that it is probably the last episode ever...just watched it...gutted.."
,sevilalucard,2009-12-12T01:51Z,"DVD release is stated to be 16 eps and 2 extras, any comments on this? does original seed have the others? would be great and thanks for the upload Rachie85 great show excellent work"
,t0rrent4ever,2009-12-12T17:19Z,"Series 3 is 6 episodes.  If you read that from wiki, it was referring to all the eps that have air for the show so far.  Look now and it says 17 + 2 shorts."
,sevilalucard,2009-12-13T04:43Z,"thanks t0rrent4ever , yeah i saw it after the fact Cheers 20 episodes total theres islands in the stream, and smithy meets the english football team"
,starlys,2009-12-13T09:53Z,Thanks for the upload Rachie85! So sad the show is over.

,bradster1,2009-12-13T22:04Z,this has to be the most overhyped tv program- not worth the bandwidth even if genuine
,joezinho,2009-12-15T18:20Z,"If I play on windows media player it shows video but no audio, on quicktime the time bar will scroll across at the bottom but there isn't any video or audio, even after downloading codecs which I thought might work, does anybody know how to fix this?"
