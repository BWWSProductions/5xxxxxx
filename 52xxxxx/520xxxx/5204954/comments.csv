,ND3G,2009-12-09T15:30Z,Now the real question is when are we going to see the PS2 version.
,Strikefear13,2009-12-09T15:41Z,"Pft.  I wouldn't touch anything but the Wii version.  I get that a lot of people don't have the Wii, but.. I just couldn't see this game being nearly as good without the motion controls."
,manuel88,2009-12-10T02:37Z,the ps2 comes out in jan with the psp version about a week later or earlier but i doubt it will be better than the wii although it has a month more to make the game alil better 
,BigDet,2009-12-10T04:59Z,Markuf do you have the new Tony hawk ride for the wii that you can upload
,syndre,2009-12-11T22:05Z,This is one of the worst games I have ever played on Wii
,Reece71079,2009-12-12T00:05Z,"surely it carnt be that bad, Im looki forward to playin it got 700mb to download. I hope its not that crap because silent hill game are usually good."
,gthyuj,2009-12-12T11:42Z,the game is okay i think
,evilof,2009-12-13T00:53Z,"Have anyone tried this on PAL`? I have never tried NTSC on my chipped Wii, but I don't want to wait until the european (springtime) release to play this game..."
,fuckincrazyness,2009-12-13T08:06Z,"i hope its better than the movie! that was a Buzzkill.

gamma 7 backup ios 249 rev 14 ntsc 3.3u. hope it works"
,DookJones,2009-12-13T13:48Z,Great game. I'd say it's my 3rd favorite behind Silent Hill 1 and 2. If you really take time to get the subtleties in the game you will see that it was created by people who really understand the horror genre.
,gthyuj,2009-12-15T23:20Z,works okay on my pal wii with softmod
,mvinas1705,2009-12-16T04:09Z,"Not working for my NTSC 3.3U softchip, gamma, gecko giving me error 002 i have rev 14 installed"
,NDesaster,2009-12-17T23:52Z,"@ mvinas1705 - Just use a 002 error fix, that's a pretty common problem with lots of games...

Also, thank you!"
,transitvan,2009-12-18T08:04Z,"excellent DL, thanks. This has to be the best Silent Hill of them all. Works perfect no problems. Running softmod and CoverFloader with Rev14. Used WBFS manager 3 to send to hard drive.
Anyone not played Silent Hill before are in for a treat!!!!!
Once again a Big Up for the download."
,paradox707,2009-12-24T13:13Z,I tried this using usb loader gx thing and i get a header problem but i dont think that is the cause of my problem it loads of passed the phychological warning but than it a white screen and plays that creepy music and nothing else happens. so if anybody else has this issue give me a shout or if you know how to fix it thatd be cool thanks

,stuckonthiswretchedplanet,2009-12-28T20:36Z,"can anyone tell me ? after i extract the files , i just burn the iso ? i usually just burn movies . I'm not really sure if i need a specific format for the wii "
,GenEmperor,2009-12-30T09:01Z,"Yes just burn it on a DVD-R disk using IMGBURN at the slowest compatible speed.IMGBurn will tell you the recommended speeds. On my the slowest was at 4x. It will not work unless you have a wii chip installed or have had your wii soft modded which basically means it has been hacked using software. To softmad your wii you will need an SD card and do what they tell you to do in this video tutorial on u tube titled 
""How to Hack Wii 4.2 System Menu"" by iComedy1. That is the video I used to softmod the wii."
,freddyjunior,2009-12-31T10:23Z,"thanking you, scary biscuits"
,koko-goal,2010-01-01T22:58Z,"Works awesomely on softmodded Wii 4.2U

,asleroth,2010-01-07T08:06Z,Good game! Quite short but a very good remake in my opinion! Thanks

I finished the game without any problem

Just use the newest NeoGamma R8 beta 17, without any special confgs

And burn it on a good quality DVD-R, Sony for example. Burn it at the 2X speed."
