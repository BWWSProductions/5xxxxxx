,magic_phil,2009-12-10T15:34Z,Please be patient during initial uploading!
,siwrath,2009-12-11T11:03Z,"thanks for upload, great speed.does not work with acekard 2i"
,magic_phil,2009-12-11T19:28Z,Thanks for your comment siwrath. This version is pre patched for r4 only. The unpatched version should work in the acekard 2i with no patch so long as you have AKAIO 1.5 and the latest loader. But it would not work in the R4 hence this version. You can find a clean rom on many websites.
,magic_phil,2009-12-11T19:30Z,Here's a link to the clean rom no patch uploaded by Cyroms http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5184355/[NDS]Assasins_Creed_2_-_Discovery
,magic_phil,2009-12-12T16:04Z,"I've uploaded the latest DSTT firmware fixes many games zelda, assasins creed, avatar, COP etc.

USE unpatched games with this firmware!"
,kreem,2009-12-12T17:11Z,Still doesnt work with my R4 (using ver 1.12b software from r4ds.co.uk) Just get the same black screen with rom code and message to reset system :(
,magic_phil,2009-12-12T19:14Z,@Kreem Official R4 ceased at ver 1.18 www.r4ds.com. Am i right in thinking you have a R4SDHC? in which case the best compatability is to install ysmenu using the latest unoffical DSTT firmware. Hope this helps
,kreem,2009-12-12T22:20Z,@magic_phil - thanks for the info. I'm a ds noob so bear with me! Yes my R4 is the SDHC version and I'm using the software from the place I bought it. I'm reluctant to start changing the software as the games I've got on the memory stick have all got saves - if I changed the software would the new software create new saves? 
,magic_phil,2009-12-13T00:06Z,"@kreem You should backup any saves you have. Best advice is to backup all the contents of your sd card to a folder on your pc. If things don't work simply copy all the files back! :) Ysmenu is however compatible with your saves. The configuration file for ysmenu is ysmenu.ini this allows you to set the format to .sav or .SAV whichever you have been using previously. I think it should be automatically compatible but as i dont have an r4sdhc i can't say. In either case you can change it. Google ""ysmenu on r4sdhc"" should give you some advice. "
,kreem,2009-12-13T19:08Z,@magic_phil - thanks again. Thing is I've noticed that I can't actually delete the save files off the memory stick (yup - ds noob!) I guess I might be able to copy and paste em to another location but I guess I'd be stuck with formatting the memory stick to get them off. Ah to hell with it - cant be bothered lol!
,billyv,2009-12-14T00:42Z,seems to be working great with my M3 DS simply. thank you so much!
,kreem,2009-12-27T10:39Z,"@magic_phil - I've bought another memory stick, so would I be able to just download the software from the link you provided onto the new memory stick and put it in my R4SDHC card and it should work? I'm kinda getting the impression that newer games aren't going to work with my current firmware and yours seems to be the way to go."
,kreem,2009-12-29T20:16Z,Can ANYONE comment? The R4 cartridge doesn't have any physical memory that this software can 'write' to does it? I just don't want to bugger up the games that are working fine for me now.
,kreem,2010-01-01T15:38Z,Pricks...
,magic_phil,2010-01-01T17:49Z,@kreem apologies been busy with xmas. can u give me anymore details about your r4?? Is it an R4(i)SDHC?? my existing link is for DSTT (different type of card) and would not work unless this is the case. let me know and ill try and help
,kreem,2010-01-01T20:05Z,Thanks for replying Phil - it's just the R4 SDHC - it doesnt say R4i on it - I bought it from www.r4ds.co.uk. I tried the software from the link you provided earlier but just get a little data icon on the top screen of the DS so I just downloaded the latest software from r4ds - but this game doesnt work (or Avatar) 
,magic_phil,2010-01-01T20:42Z,"kreem unfortunately i dont own an r4sdhc but i have looked for you and apparently it is not possible to use ysmenu on one. http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=164359
but the kind folks at http://gbatemp.net will usually try and help if you post a message explaining your problems. . The other alternative is to buy a new flashcart with more regular updates eg. acekard2i or even dstt. try dealextreme.com. sorry i cant be of more help"
,JackBarley,2010-01-03T12:56Z,"Re R4i-sdhc,upgrade to new firmware v1.14b from maker's website and everything works ok."
,praetoriandefault,2010-01-03T14:23Z,How did you patch this?
,kreem,2010-01-03T18:33Z,@jackbarley - tried using the new firmware - I just get white screens. I'm using a 4gb card tho. Might try it on the 2gb card...
,kreem,2010-01-03T18:42Z,Nope - I get the disk error with the 2gb card and the white screen with the 4gb card - I've tried disabling soft reset and dma in the menu too - no deal.  I don't know why I'm bothering - it looks an awful game!
,magic_phil,2010-01-06T02:35Z,@kreem you might want to look at http://irc.gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=193749 and find the latest firmware for your particular r4sdhc 
,kreem,2010-01-08T11:27Z,"Thanks for all your help Phil, but I've wasted too much time trying to get this working as it is - for me it works with the majority of games and that will have to do."
,Fliskor,2010-01-31T05:09Z,WTF DOESN'T WORK! white screen. i downloaded the latest r4 kernal. i go the R4ultra SDHC 4g. 
,magic_phil,2010-02-02T18:55Z,@Fliskor this is for r4 only. R4SDHC is a different card. Check my previous link for latest firmware and hope your card manufacturer has updated. Then use a clean unpatched rom
,ctqsrtq,2010-03-03T22:31Z,"Works great with 1.18 r4 firmare. Wont work with my fav. Ysmenu.
THX"
,ctqsrtq,2010-03-03T22:33Z,"1 more thing

,passerby22,2010-03-22T13:36Z,"who the hell names themselves xenophobia? kinda moronic don't you think? ""I think I'ma go make a nickname! How about homophobia? yeah that's so fucking cool! Oh what about xenophobia? OH YEAH that is so much cooler because it has an X in it! Who cares what it means! YEAH!"""
,Devil_Spawn,2010-03-23T13:43Z,will it work on TTDS

,magic_phil,2010-03-26T09:28Z,@ devilspawn This is prepatched for r4 and wont work on DSTT/TTDS. See my other torrent for latest DSTT firmware and download an unpatched rom.
,ctqsrtq,2010-03-27T21:59Z,"passerby22

,magic_phil,2010-03-30T00:55Z,@D_S extract to your microsd card overwriting existing files
,Devil_Spawn,2010-03-30T11:47Z,"wont that delete my files ??

D_S"
,magic_phil,2010-04-03T00:50Z,your overwriting the firmware (operating system) not your games and saves! make a backup first!
,Meedina,2010-04-26T17:24Z,Not working on a Edge flashcard
,bobj74,2010-07-31T00:23Z,"i know it was a long shot, but doesn't work on my m3"
