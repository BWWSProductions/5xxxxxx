Commercial for 1 computer for 183 days

License validity period expires 5/25/2010 10:59:59 PM

155 days remaining.

Is this what is suppose to happen?

Do I activiate a new license in 155 days?

Thanks!"
,treps_92boy,2009-12-22T18:19Z,"I do not know if these keys will work but the Beta-key will work fine

After the installation do this:

1. Update Kaspersky

2. Then rightklick at the Kaspersky icon down  at the clock and take ""Settings"" then at the left meny take ""Options"". At the top, disable ""Self-Defense"" (uncheck it)

3. Rightklick again at the Kaspersky icon at the clock and take ""Exit""

4. Click ""Start"" and ""Run"" then type ""regedit""

5. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> SOFTWARE -> KasperskyLab -> protected -> AVP9 and then click
at ""environment""

6. To the right you will scroll down and double click at ""ProductStatus"" and change from ""Release"" to ""Beta""

7. Close the Registationeditor and then start Kaspersky again! 
A window will shows up and there you will click ""Activate beta key"" or something then next the hole time

8. DONE!!!

Every 30 days you will need to activate again at the window who shows up!

This worked for me :)"

,davitodude,2010-01-08T21:29Z,Still works for me at least. I did this about two weeks ago and got another 30 day trial. Did it again and it's updated for another 30 days. THANKS!
,paradise23,2010-01-21T16:09Z,"It worked perfectly, Thanks. But, now it's telling me the database is obsolete.  Where do I go to find updated version of kaspersky, they all seem very similar in the torrents list. or should i just try other keys? 

Thanks in Advance."

,kolot182,2010-02-15T22:54Z,why is it that in the website of kaspersky the internet security 9.0.0.736 is 72.7mb and here is 70.17mb only?
,dhruv990,2010-05-22T21:13Z,"will this run in win 7 64 bit?(looka like dell has stopped support for 32 bit, bought a new laptop that's 64 bit without realising it)"
