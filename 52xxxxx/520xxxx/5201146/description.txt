       .  cutting edge of technology.                                  .
       |                                                               |

       |  High monitoring performance without a high price. From a     |
       |  simple ping to more complex SNMP checks, web URLs to         |
       |  Windows performance monitoring. And if you can't find the    |
       |  check you need within our extensive list of available        |
       |  options you can always write your own using our very simple  |

       |  available.                                                   |
       |                                                               |

       |  types. Alerts can be sent to teams or persons, that way you  |
       |  can adapt the address to which the alert is sent based on    |

       |  call, and not on other days.                                 |
       |                                                               |

       |  tags to get great looking web output.                        |
       |                                                               |
       |  * Graphical Results                                          |
       |  Servers Alive uses industry standard RRD (Round Robin        |
       |  Database) to give you great looking graphics of check times  |
       |  and results that you can use in reports or web pages.        |
       |                                                               |
       |  * Agent-less for most monitoring, agents for secure          |
       |  environments                                                 |
       |  Most of the monitoring can be done without special remote    |
       |  agents. However for some secure environments we also have    |
       |  remote agents.                                               |

       |  We exist to serve the scene with quality releases, and       |
       |  to help the scene maintain some vestige of its former self.  |
       |                                                               |
       |  A lot has changed since our last anniversary, and many of    |
       |  the things we have proposed back then seem to be finally     |
       |  getting accepted. The 0day scene is attempting to catch up   |
       |  with today's applications by proposing a new ruleset, and    |
       |  this is a good thing.                                        |
       |                                                               |
       |  Our main concern is still the future of our scene, and       |
       |  because of this we would like to invite and challenge the    |
  __ __|__      talented minds of the young generations. Join the      |
