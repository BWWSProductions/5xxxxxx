,mckinnon1888,2009-12-08T02:57Z,hey uploader cant seem to get these to download maybe free but take hours n i have a 7 mb speed what am i doing wrong 
,tetsaiga,2009-12-08T04:21Z,"Thanks loads dude, great as always, I know you must get sick of requests but could you or one of the others in the ps3 team do the running man with Arnold Schwarzenegger please? 
I was watching an Arny film with my girlfriend and we said about how we love his cheesy one liners but she has never seen the running man Arny has somthing cheesy to say everytime he kills someone in that film lol"
,moegocanes,2009-12-08T04:24Z,aw man thanks.. AOT!@
,ckyskeletor,2009-12-08T04:24Z,you do realize this is a 4 GB file not MB right.  And just because your internet speed is 7 mb does not mean you will download at that speed.  Do a little research and tweak your settings on what ever program you are using to download. I have a 12MB connection and usually finish a movie in 3-4 hours.
,swordHD,2009-12-08T05:30Z,"Hey mckinnon these movies are not only 4gb, but it takes Brick and the rest of the crew a lot of work to put these movies up.  I am talking 12 to 16 hours to convert these movies using RipBot.  So dont complain, its really annoying.  Also, the download speed changes based on how many seeders there are.  

Brick, I finally got RipBot to work with Windows 7.  I did have to use an older version! "
