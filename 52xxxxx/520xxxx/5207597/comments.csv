,shinjukublack,2010-01-11T20:00Z,"Thanks for the upload!

I'm just a bit confused, though....

""There is some gaps in audio which were filled with russian dub. English speech is rather well heard""

What exactly does this mean? English audio stops and switches to Russian? English subtitles? Does this mean it's actually in French?

Just a little confused, buddy :)"
,nabbla,2010-01-15T14:52Z,"Yes, it switches to russian dub. Fortunately, there is very few such gaps. 

It's actually in english but it also have english subtitles. "
,SamanthaSweet,2010-03-06T08:59Z,"Nabbla, thank you so much for sharing this!  The quality is far better than the others.  Also play great on standalone dvd player.  Too bad so few seeders."
,vayaari,2010-05-12T18:27Z,"good quality, and it seems better than the recent dvd that came out. i haven't went through all the files yet though."
,iccyhot,2010-06-08T21:23Z,Does no one have the French Audio version?
,casemods,2010-06-11T07:42Z,"Video is small and looks kinda bad (brightness, etc)

Sound is static at high levels (every 10 seconds at least)

5/5

Don't get..."
,casemods,2010-06-15T06:15Z,"Update: Get this instead of the other ones.

At least it's not the N edits"
,CyGogetenks,2010-09-07T02:37Z,Could someone please help seed this? I'm willing to seed once i get it myself for all those Daria fans out there!
,secretjacqfar,2010-11-12T00:57Z,"Do we know which episodes have the Russian dub on?
Why are there parts with Russian dub anyway? It really makes me question what looks like a good (finally) Daria upload."
,camool,2010-12-08T03:00Z,The audio cuts out entirely in some parts. Aside from that great torrent thanks. 
,neonhomer,2011-10-31T17:01Z,So far.... S02E02 and E03 have russian dubs in spots.
