consideration this is a 2h 11min long movie.

Those 700MB(OMG), 1-1.5 GB rips surely

 have dreadful pictures. cheers"

,enonumus,2012-03-01T04:43Z,"Read your comment about the size, and now I'm still going to make a comment.  I've encoded several HUNDRED 720P and 480P H.264/AVC movies, and I've encoded thousands of MPEG-2 movies over the last 15+ years.  That said, your file is TOO BIG.  Even if it were a 2-hour, full resolution 720P high-def movie (1280x720) it would still be TOO BIG (though not by much).  The first thing I did after I downloaded it was to re-encode it to HALF that file size while retaining 100% of the quality.  If you're not using Handbrake to encode, you should be.  Andi f you are using Handbrake, then you need to learn the proper settings so your files retain most of their quality but at the smallest reasonable file size.

Everybody appreciates the contribution, I know I certainly do, but if you had to leave a comment proactively heading off other comments about the file size, that's the best indicator your file is too big.  That, and a comparison against every other 2 hour, standard-def, H.264 movie in existence.

Thanks again for the upload."
