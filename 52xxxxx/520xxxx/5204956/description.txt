________________________


This is widely considered to be the best recording of this work.  The exactitude of the choir and orchestra if anything could be deemed its only fault - they are so precise that the end result is almost clinical.  As with all of Gardiner's Bach, this was performed on period instruments.

More information about this work may be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Matthew_Passion_(Bach)

I neglect to give a full tracklisting below as the names are somewhat long.  See the freedb entries.  The MP3 files themselves are of course fully tagged in a manner consistent with my other torrent releases.
