     Release Notes:                                                        
                                                                           
     YouTrack (previously code-named Charisma) is a keyboard-centric bug   
     tracker web application. Whatever you do with your issues, you can    
     make the process of bug tracking much faster because most of your     
     actions involve two simple controls:                                  
     Search for issues by typing queries in the search box using query     
     completion                                                            
     Modify multiple issues at once using the Command window.              
     YouTrack offers even more ways to minimize the time you spend on bug  
     tracking:                                                             
     Create new issues by simply pressing Alt+Ins from anywhere within     
     YouTrack.                                                             
     Use extensive keyboard support to create, edit, and navigate between  
     issues  all major actions have easy-to-learn shortcuts. For example, 
     to close an issue, you type fixed, and press Ctrl+Enter.              
     Assign tags to group issues the way you like, regardless of their     
     attributes. For example, you can create a tag like fix it today and   
     associate it with issues from different projects, subsystems, etc     
                                                                           
                                                                           
   
     Install Notes:                                                        
                                                                           
     This release is meant to be used as an addon to an existing tomcat    
     installation.  You should install the WAR file as you would any other 
     tomcat addon/plugin.  Typically this involves logging into the tomcat 
     administration page and navigating to the plugins tab.
     When running the setup, you will have to enter in your license user   
     and key... put in anything you want.
