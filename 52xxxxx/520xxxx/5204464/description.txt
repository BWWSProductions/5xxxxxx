Going nowhere, three losers decide to plan an elaborate kidnapping of a school bus load of children. The sad thing is, they actually go through with it, and things rapidly spiral out of control. The adult acting includes a fine, believable, performance from Karl Malden, as the school bus driver. The non actors, including all of the children, are spectacularly unimpressive. Nevertheless, despite some required "feel good" subplots, the story maintains interest. For those that demand a certain amount of realism in their entertainment, "Vanished Without a Trace" will provide a satisfying viewing experience.
