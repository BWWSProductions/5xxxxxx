,natanaelcd,2009-12-09T23:13Z,what is the diference from the original to the repack?
,thelogicalghost,2009-12-13T19:19Z,"Original, as far as I can tell, contains the entire episode, but the last commercial break isn't edited out, and at the end, the last segment after the commercial break repeats. I'm halfway downloaded and hoping the repack fixed these spots."
