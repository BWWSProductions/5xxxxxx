,stir_fry,2009-12-09T06:24Z,"This is hands down, one of the worst movies I've seen in recent history. At the heart of its failure is the lack of character development. You are given less than 5 minutes to meet each character and then given a crash course in their personality. You are then thrust wildly into the main story. Any ""relationships"" between characters are developed over a few lines of dialog; this is barely enough that you don't wonder why these total strangers are hanging out together.

The plot, even for a sci-fi horror movie is laughable. While the general premise was interesting, it wasn't developed sufficiently. The progress through the story required the characters to discuss what just happened with each other, so you (the viewer) could figure out what just happened.

The most enjoyment I got out of this movie was when the screen went black and the credits finally rolled. "

Some people like si-fi horrors even if the characters don't have depth."

Anyway, thanks!!"
