,Dysreflex,2009-12-14T04:27Z,Good sync and audio levels but the video is real choppy.  It gets around 10 FPS on my computer and my LG BD390 bluray player. Looks like there wasn't enough CPU during the encoding process. Anyone else have this problem?
,marxm,2009-12-27T22:30Z,What player are you using?  Mp4's never play that well on my computer when using Media Player.  GOM player has never failed.

,marxm,2009-12-29T09:44Z,"Hey, I love my gold-leaf, leather-bound Mad Magazine collection.  Also, GOM player can't play this worth a damn.  The only thing that worked well for me was KMP and it was just a little choppy on that.  I would say don't bother with this one unless you have some top of the line hardware."
