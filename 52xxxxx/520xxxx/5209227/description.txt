JohnnyÂ´s first movie from -61. HeÂ´s playing an killer in this one and doing that pretty good. Not an Oscar winner but w.t.f. itÂ´s the Man in black. A must for us Cash maniacs.

Found this on the net and reencoded it from m4v file to mp4 so itÂ´s watch and burnable to DVD players. 

Enjoy and donÂ´t forget to seed. And write an comment what you think of this one.
