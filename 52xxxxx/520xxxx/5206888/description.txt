SCREENING MANAGEMENT
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES
Transportation Security Administration

Transportation Security Administration (TSA) personnel and contractors must use and implement these standard operating procedures in carrying out their functions related to security screening of passengers, accessible property and checked baggage. Nothing in these procedures is intended to create any substantive or procedural rights, privileges, or benefits enforceable in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter by prospective or actual witnesses or parties. See United States v. Caceres, 440 U.S. 741 (1979).
