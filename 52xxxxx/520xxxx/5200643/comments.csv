,molukki,2009-12-07T00:04Z,"Looks legit, they're driving some big trucks on the video and Wikipedia mentions ""inventing the sport of airport vehicle racing"" for s14e04"
,richardgadsby,2009-12-07T00:07Z,GMT not BST for airtime!
,snaketus,2009-12-07T00:09Z,Why people are suspecting that it's fake if something is early in here.
,hvammen,2009-12-07T00:13Z,"because hes just a user here, not trusted or has a pirate mark.
but if it is real, thanks alot pharos :)"
,bkar89,2009-12-07T00:15Z,my bet is that this is the real deal. if you open up the users torrent history you can see that he has put up alot of bbc stuff in the past...
,testersen,2009-12-07T00:15Z,YOU ARE A GOD
[T],Pharos2001,2009-12-07T00:20Z,I have already seeded E01 to E03 I just added piratebay after a ip hiding action. Piratebay was blocked from here ;-) Great quality MPEG custom matrix. XviD 1.2.2
,Nannocrob,2009-12-07T00:35Z,"wow, a British man who can handle half hour changes in tv schedules.  please breed."
[T],Pharos2001,2009-12-07T01:03Z,@ one point I did notice 36 seeders that could not possibly be real because I had not fully uploaded the file yet. I use avast & can guarantee the file I am sending is 100% perfect. (no virusses)
,Treson,2009-12-07T01:04Z,The current Avast version has bug that thinks alot of things is virus infected 
,klakket898989,2009-12-07T02:10Z,"getting 600kb/s download... nice1 
will seed."
,thrasx,2009-12-07T02:50Z,"Legit, excellent quality for the file size.
Thanks!"
,jaywhoo,2009-12-07T06:39Z,"awesome, thank you :)"
