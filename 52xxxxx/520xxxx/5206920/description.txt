========================================


This is a parallel project from Bathory's founder.

Quorthon, the infamous man behind Bathory, decided after the release of six Bathory albums that he would like to try something different, showing a total other side of him. People who have painted him already in a corner were damned surprised with this solo project.

On "Album" he let himself be influenced by heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath and Mountain. Also some punk influences were recognisable (Sex Pistols, etc.) This album was recorded in a low class studio in two weeks, using only a guitar, a bass and a drummachine.

On "Purity Of Essence" Quorthon decided to experiment more and more, showing his more rocking side. On this record his inspirations were bands like Sex Pistols, The Beatles and more bands like those.

Eternal R.I.P.'s for the TRUE founder of the current sound of Scandinavian black metal! I hail Venom immensely, but this man is responsible for what we hear in viking/folk/Odin/black metal today!
