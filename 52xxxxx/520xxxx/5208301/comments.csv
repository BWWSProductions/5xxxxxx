,thenash86,2009-12-28T18:25Z,well..i tried many ways in order to detect the map..one way is by renaming the map as the map already exist in the game..6.65 i renamed as 6.64 and then the game detect it..but in the game the name is changed to the original one which 6.65..it's kinda weird though..i really think u should work in this problem..TQ
