Although Christmas is supposed to be a time of joy and celebration, you just donâ€™t always feel that way. At times like that you donâ€™t want to hear those traditional upbeat Christmas songs you find on every Christmas compilation and radio station, you want something a little different, not moody or dark per se, but different, dealing with issues other than "all you want for Christmas" or "joy to the world". This album, compiling over 40 years of alternative artist and songs in an array of styles ranging from jazz to pop, from gospel to reggae, and from folk to blues, offers you such a selection of songs.
