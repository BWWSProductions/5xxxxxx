And as if this wasn't fucking retarded enough, who the fuck was the moron that then thought of zipping each of these rar files individually?

And to top this off, the whole bullshit is distributed using the TORRENT SYSTEM, which can handle multiple files just supernice by itself?

UNPACK THE ""RELEASE"" BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE SUCH MORON PACKAGINGS AS TORRENTS!!!"

Username 11
program key BYY4-MQPD-A98A-0M0C
dictionary key 140S-TX0T-ZCL0-DY9G
