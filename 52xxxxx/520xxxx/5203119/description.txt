SCENES ADDED:

    Countless extra snippets throughout the Argento cut were added to the 139 minutes Cannes cut. These include a few extra headshots in the mall sequences, as well as various dialogue extensions, such as the bikers in the finale planning their â€œattack strategyâ€ (â€One by one, theyâ€™re gonna knock you off your little bikesâ€).
    One full scene which was previously cut and added back in is a bit of dialogue between Peter and Stephen after they return from â€œshoppingâ€ the first time. Stephen acts cocky while Peter wants him to realize just how lucky they were. This scene contains the line â€œLetâ€™s say the lady gets killedâ€¦ youâ€™d be able to chop off her head?â€ which was used in the English language Italian trailer.

Classic movie of George Romero.
With dutch subtitles included.

Partially, this subtitles I made meself, because it was not available anywhere in Holland with this length!
It is soft subtitles, so you can put it off.
