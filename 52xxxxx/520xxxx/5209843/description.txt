                  Archibald and his friends were near a dump 
                  behind a mysterious mansion of inventor 
                  professor Klumpfus. Accidently Archie fell 
                  down a pipe and ended up in professor's 
                  basement. 

                  In the same time some crazy experiment
                  went wrong and all genetically engineered 
                  creatures escaped from their containment  
                  in laboratories, while paranoid central 
                  computer locked the whole complex up! 

                  Now both Archibald and professor got stuck 
                  in the mansion!

                  it's up to you to help Archie to overcome 
                  all of the pitfalls of the mansion, and 
                  use your skills and wit to guide the heroes 
                  through more than 100 uncanny levels!
