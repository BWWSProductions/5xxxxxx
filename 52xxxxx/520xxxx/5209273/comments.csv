,acidr3flux,2009-12-13T09:23Z,eztv we love you sir/maam. you're surely better than cable. I pay for it and watch tv from you. It's sad. Thank you for being so great at what you do. It's the only way I'll ever stay caught up with It's always sunny and the SAMCRO crew.

you read my mind verbatim; however I specifically choose not to pay for cable and simply fork the $60 over monthly for an internet connection for my SOA and philly needs.  EZTV, you make my life complete!"
