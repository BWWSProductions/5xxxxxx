"Alex talks with John Young, an independent scholar, architect, and webmaster of Cryptome, a website that functions as a repository for information about freedom of speech, cryptography, spying, and surveillance. Young's site came under fire last week from Yahoo's lawyers when it posted information on Yahooâ€™s Compliance Guide for Law Enforcement, a 17 page guide describing Yahooâ€™s data retention policies and the surveillance capabilities it offers law enforcement.

Alex also runs down the latest on the globalist climate change confab in Copenhagen, covers other important news stories of the day, and takes your calls."

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
