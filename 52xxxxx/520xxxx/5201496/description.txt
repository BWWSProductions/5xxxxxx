    Overview/Description                                                    
    Windows Server 2008 introduces Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODCs)     
    which can be deployed by organizations in locations where physical      
    security may be an issue. A RODC will improve security, provide         
    faster login times and more efficient access to network resources,      
    especially over a WAN. This course discusses various policies, such     
    as Group Policies, Default Domain Security Policies, Account            
    Policies, and Password Policies, that are used to implement security    
    in your organization. It also explains how organizational units can     
    be used to apply the Group Policy settings to a specific subset of      
    computers or users, and how Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) can be   
    used to secure Active Directory communications. The course is one in    
    a series that covers the objectives for Microsoft exam 70-640: TS:      
    Windows Server 2008 Active Directory, Configuring. Passing this exam    
    completes the requirements for the MCTS: Windows Server 2008 Active     
    Directory, Configuration certification, and counts as credit towards    
    the following certifications: Microsoft Certified IT Professional       
    (MCITP): Enterprise Administrator, and the Microsoft Certified IT       
    Professional (MCITP): Server Administrator, since both MCITPs are       
    certifications that require more than one exam.
