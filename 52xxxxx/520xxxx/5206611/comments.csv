,wetWeasel,2009-12-10T18:07Z,"Warning: If you see this program listed in your TV listing, or available for download I recommend that you beat your head against a hard surface until it feels good to stop. It will be a better use of your time, and more entertaining than watching this pablum drivel excuse for programming. 

What do you have to smoke to find this kind of thing entertaining? "
