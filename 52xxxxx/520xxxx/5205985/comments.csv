You don't need key for the cd2, only for cd1. What kind of prompt do you  get?"
,benito296,2009-12-24T07:28Z,"hi everybody, and thanks for sharing this great stuff...
I am using cycle 25-2008 and thinking about updating now. I installed succesfully the cycle 25-2008 using the following steps,  but I need to know if the following steps work on this cycle too ???

1.- Install: 
Jeppview 3 Program_disk_-_Terminal_-_Enroute_charts 

   (   download this program at  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3932429/Jeppview_3_(Program_disk_-_Terminal_-_Enroute_charts)_0720_Cycle  )

This is the setup program ...here you must to enter this serial code VNX1-IBYH-E5K1-7G8F

2.-Install CD1 25-2008: 

With this CD1 you must to enter the coverage code:
Worldwide : 253DP18779
VFR Europe : 253DN18778
JMCS- Full WorldWide : 253DM18778
JMCS- Europe-Med/Atlantic : 253DI18782 

(JMCS=Jeppview Military Chart Service)

3.- Install CD2
4.- Don't restart
5.- Activate via Phone 
...use this code R00D KCAB
END.

Note: 
1.- Don't use cracked SETUP.INX (not required)
2.- If you wish you can follow the instructions of JeppView_3_Date_Calc_v1.1a
But don't use the serial and coverage code inside the slide show ...thats codes are not in use!!!

Now if you wish to see you Jeppview 25-2008 like 26-2008 (but not update) 
Go to:
C:\Jeppesen\Common\TerminalCharts\Charts.txt
and write this:

Database_Begin_Date=2454827.5
Database_End_Date=2454840

Now when you star again you Jeppview this change the old date in red for the new cycle date ...just that ...isn't a update!!

AND NEVER UPDATE JEPPVIEW ONLINE!!!

These steps still WORK for this cylcle ????
