,Rhyus,2009-12-13T18:33Z,Is this suppose to be the entire series or just one season?
,3ennuj,2009-12-13T22:05Z,"It is the entire series.

But upload is so slow.... anyway so it gets faster ?

Anyway I'll leave torrent running 'till I have paid back the 60gb."
,3ennuj,2009-12-14T22:37Z,"Few infos : First thanks for the seeder. It is quite an awsome post.

_ After a week , we got 20 % of the entire torrent.
_ Average speed :  15-20 kb/s ( sometimes pikes faster but not for long)
_Mr. Seeder, who I thank again, never went off, which is a good attitude.
_Another thank for the quality  : encode is quite good
_And ,To those who are high prioritying the episode 1 ( ep1s1) : Morons, the series starts with the miniserie ( part1/2 2003). Whats the point in high prioritying it. you are slowing down everything else.

ok it is slow but as long as the seeder stay in seed it will be ok.

Nevertheless , at this rate, I situate the end in more or less 3 weeks, unless dl speed gets faster or unless someone helps the seed."
,penandpike,2009-12-14T23:12Z,Giving higher priority to files really slows the seed down. I seed with 80-90k and have uploaded 30 gb so far. Yet insted of 50% you all have only 20%.
,3ennuj,2009-12-14T23:45Z,"Penandpike : Exactly, dunno y ppl, after several years of bittorent existing, just dont get it.

Also , are you using the first share feature? in ¬µtorrent > right clik on your seed , then properties > first share option.

Basically it gives diffrent parts from the seeder to each peers. Wich means each peers can share with all others, for parts that are not in the swarm yet. 
It avoids as possible redondant parts of the file through the swarm.

WARNING ! This feature can only be used by the seeder as long as there is only one seeder. As soon as there is a 2dn one, you should turn the option off.

Sorry for bad english , I dunno if you understood what I have written.

Thanks for this great post anyway :)"
,3ennuj,2009-12-14T23:50Z,"Oh I might add for everyone to know :) : It is a 1st SEEDER option only, PEERS musn'nt use it."
,penandpike,2009-12-15T22:32Z,"I do it's called ""Initial seeding"""
,penandpike,2009-12-16T17:54Z,"Does that mean that I can not download the full 61gb?
No it doesn't mean that. 
And for the Initial seeding thing, it seemed like uTorrent doesn't work properly
so i changed to Vuze (Azureus), and hope the speed will double."
,3ennuj,2009-12-17T01:00Z,"I believe average speed has increased 

now its about 30 kb/s with pikes that go 70-80.

Most of the time it is > 15- 40 /kbs <

Giving priority to the first files  ( miniserie 1/2 and ep1 ) fucks the whole torrent up.

>> Penandpike , can you turn off/on what you upload to the swarm? Maybe I have a tip :

Either u turn off miniserie and 1st ep , so there wont be any priority issue. 

or , on other hand you can turn off everything but miniserie and ep 1 , Uploading them to us untill we got them 100%. Then you turn them off, leaving the share for those one to the swarm. >> Hoping then we would get what's left faster ?

I don't know tho, if that would work. 

Anyway, im seeding 90-100 k most of the time , its just pain to know half of it gets lost into the swarm with no new files.

People; please , quit high-prioritying."
,3ennuj,2009-12-17T20:29Z,"Average speed still increasing :)

 ~50 kB/s"
,3ennuj,2009-12-18T02:44Z,"faster and faster ~80-100 k :)

Dunno how you did this but nice one."

,ZennmasterM,2009-12-18T04:34Z,"At 36% I finally got a complete episode, and these rips are TOTALLY FRAKKIN' AWESOME!  Thank you SO much for posting this! Once I get the whole thing I'll be seeding for a good long time."
,jman_6669,2009-12-18T05:34Z,Thanks for your help! I haven't had many torrents where I've uploaded 320gbs and have only gotten 37% (22.6gb) If we keep this up we may actually turn this into a pretty quick torrent. If people who have this done can leave it seeding over night for at least the next few days other people can take your place and really help out!
,jimmel,2009-12-22T05:18Z,"Badass torrent, will definitely seed when done."
,ZennmasterM,2009-12-24T10:01Z,"Almost there! 93.8%, and I hope all my companions on this adventure will seed!  I know I will!

Thanks to all who've stuck with it this far..."
,penandpike,2010-01-01T17:43Z,"First: A typical bluray rip is 2.2gb/ per episode, so this torrent must be apx. 180gb insted of 60gb.
Second: The second line of my info says that each episode is 700mb.

,shiftgear,2010-01-11T15:01Z,Great Torrent!! The quality is outstanding.  I just finished downloading and will seed at 400 kb/s for the next couple of weeks.  Thanks to the uploader.
,penandpike,2010-01-11T17:38Z,"Thanks for the comments.
But mostly thanks to the people who understand the great deal of time spent for creating a torrent like this, and the need to seed.
It seems like this torrent is going to die and believe me i will not reseed it.
Don't be selfish as i'm not.
"
,mr1974,2010-01-12T06:51Z,"First off, this is an excellent series. Secondly, the quality of these rips is SUPERIOR to most 720p rips you can download. However I have only watched up to S01E06 where, sadly, the audio is missing. :( (Using MPHC, AC3Filter, Haali, CCCP, etc.) (One other issue is the captioning of the miniseries, but in season one it clears up. "
,mr1974,2010-01-12T07:08Z,"Ignore my comments about the audio. I figured out that a setting got changed in MPHC last night (at about 1am, so I was sleepy) which was causing the issues.

Again: great torrent. (I'm not seeding because my ISP gets pissy about data transfers. I'll seed a bit at a time over the coming weeks and months, just had to leave it alone for a week.)"
,tpb2k9,2010-01-18T00:04Z,"I looked at the image comparisons. They seem comparable. But, something must have been lost in the compression - can anyone who's downloaded a few episodes say anything? Are fast motion scenes blockier or something?

I have the HDTV rips of the whole series, and they're all at least 1 or 2 GB/ep. I figured blu-ray rips would be worth it for the increase in quality, but maybe not if each episode is only 700MB."
,dreadlox,2010-01-19T19:09Z,"@tpb2k9
It depends on which scenes you compare. It's not possible to judge video quality from a few stills from a few selected scenes...

In fast, dark scense these rips are quite bad sometimes... In slow, bright scenes without too much details they look almost the same as higher-bitrate-rips. I suggest you download an episode and check yourself.

These rips are too bad for me.
I'd prefer a lower resolution with such a low bitrate. I think lower resolution looks better than high-res with lots of blocks and artifacts. But that's me :) Others might not agree..."
,tpb2k9,2010-01-20T02:11Z,I agree - I checked out an ep from this torrent - looks a little worse than my current HDTV rips. I found a better blu-ray rip of the whole series (1.5GB/ep) on AceHD (private tracker).
,tpb2k9,2010-01-20T02:12Z,"ALSO, since fast, dark scenes comprise the majority of battlestar galactica... we need as much quality as we can get."
,tpb2k9,2010-01-20T02:15Z,Sorry to keep spamming with comments. Just want to qualify my remarks: this is still a great torrent! Probably the most bang for your buck (quality for your hard drive space) that i've seen. But probably not for the hardcore fans obsessed with quality.

First : great torrent. Ok it's not the best quality in HD but it's just a perfect ratio weigth/quality.

I'm just having a little problem and checking if i'm the only one. 

On S02E02, the picture is freezing at 41:55. And the sound goes on. Not a big deal since it's the end of the Ep, but i'm wondering if i'm the only one and if i can do something about it. 

Thanks again for the great work !"

But this isn't my ship, and it

Took me about a week to get this all down, and am now seeding.

Anyhow, quality-wise, these do run at 720p, but they have been compressed pretty badly. Quality is comparable to scaled-up 480p, and the size of each episode is evident of this. 

If you really want a good 720p archive of the show, I'd recommend hunting down seasonal torrents or looking on a private tracker for a torrent with episodes that are 720p and aren't heavily compressed, with sizes around 1.1GB each."

,nemod12,2011-09-24T20:46Z,"how can this be in the top of the list. its good, but soo slooow,, takes more than a week to download."
,nemod12,2011-09-25T13:22Z,"people , dont complain about the quality, cause for 700 mb episodes the quality is just very good.  better thgan the rest of its amount of mbs,  
Sure the 177 gb torrent here is much better,  but slllooooooow to dowload"
,nemod12,2011-10-04T23:56Z,"ok another update about the quality. and an update about battlestar galactica. So i have a 50 inch hd plasma screen. And its hard to tell the difference between a 2.2 gb episode 720p i download, and a 700+ episode. Ive downloaded them both , cause i am a real bsg freak, And ive seen the show carefully and many times/  Now let me tell you this:  If you compare it to some new HD channel broadcasts, yes! not all the scenes are as crystal clear/ nice black/ as you expected, and they never will be,  not in the 700 mb episodes, nore in the big ones, simply because they where ment to be that way. Dont ask me why,  it just is shot that way.. If you have any questions, mail me at specialistsmeets@gmail.com.

So Say We All!"
,nemod12,2011-10-04T23:59Z,"Nothing that i said before changes anything to the fact that Battlestar galactica is a piece of first class cult that doesn't have anything to compare it with. Its the best thing the human race has ever made, period."
,Elroosi,2011-11-02T14:25Z,"@nemod12
Do u mean that even the 2.2GB episode will not be crystal clear? just slightly better than this 700+MB episode? cuz it doesnt meant to be perfect by the show creators?"
,Elroosi,2011-11-02T14:29Z,"@nemod12

,Night_89,2012-01-11T03:06Z,"@Elroosi
yeah, because I`ve downloaded Epik 2.18GB, Reptiles 3.58GB, Sinners 2.18GB, Ctrlhd 2.18GB releases of the same episode just to compare but there is so much noise in video in all of them. That`s definitely the problem with the source"
,Aim_To_Maim,2012-03-27T10:48Z,Took forever to get it but fraking worth it! Everything 10/10! Thanks!

,Tyestor,2012-06-25T18:12Z,"These mkvs have got to be the worst 720p videos I've ever seen. The quality is utter horseshit, 720p my ass. Youtube 480p quality is is better than this ubscaled garbage. Can't beleive I wasted 2 days on this shit. 

Don't download this unless you're desperate or enjoy grainy video that looks like it was recorded in the 1930s and enjoy blacks that are crushed into dust. Good idea would be to find a torrent with episodes at about 1-2gb. Better safe than sorry."
,Tyestor,2012-06-25T18:13Z,"Should also mention that the audio goes out of sync intermittently, if you're lucky you'll only get it once or twice per episode for about a minute."
