This is the second time I've uploaded this, the first one was hit and run to death in a day. That only happens to me with J-rock stuff, not normal albums for some reason. I might just quit searching for this stuff for you guys. Please at least seed 200% It's a 117MB Cd. Not like some giant discography or something.
