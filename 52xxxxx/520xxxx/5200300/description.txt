 In this book, youll learn all about the Palm Pre and webOS, their capabilities,
 and how to develop for them. Youll learn to write applications that function
 entirely on the Pre itself, and youll also learn to write applications that
 live in the cloud (i.e., keep you connected to the digital world around you).

 Youll spend most of your time looking at Mojo, the framework API through which
 your code interfaces with the operating system. All of this will be presented
 within the context of six fully functional real-world applications that you can
 use on your own Pre!
