Description:
This musical instrument simulator allows hard-rocking gamers to put their air-guitar skills to good use. Guitar Hero is played with a guitar-shaped controller that features five fret buttons, a strum sensor, and a working whammy bar. Gamers can jam along with more than 30 classic and contemporary songs, including numbers by the Ramones, Ozzy Osbourne, White Zombie, and Franz Ferdinand. Success involves both synchronization and style. The game's story mode progresses through six different venues, from the makeshift basement studio to the sold-old stadium concert
