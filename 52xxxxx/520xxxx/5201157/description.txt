      |  .NET Memory Profiler is a powerful tool for finding memory   | /
      |  leaks and optimizing the memory usage in programs written    |/
       `  in C#, VB.NET or any other .NET Language.                    '
       |                                                               |
       :  * View real-time memory and resource information             :
       |  The profiler presents real-time information about all .NET   |
       |  instance allocations performed on the garbage collected      |
       |  heap and all instances that reside on the heap.              |
       |                                                               |
       |  * Easily identify memory leaks by collecting and comparing   |
       |  snapshots of .NET memory                                     |
       |  Snapshots include data about the .NET instance allocations   |
       |  and live instances at the time the snapshot was collected.   |
       |  They provide a lot of useful information and make it easy    |
       |  to identify potential memory leaks, especially when two      |
       |  snapshots are compared.                                      |
       |                                                               |
       |  * Find instances that are not properly disposed              |
       |  The profiler also contains a dispose tracker, which          |
       |  provides additional data about disposable instances (i.e.    |
       |  instances of classes implementing the System.IDisposable     |
       |  interface).                                                  |
       |                                                               |
       |  * Get detailed information about unmanaged resourceusage     |
       |  The unmanaged resources tracker can collect detailed         |
       |  information about unmanaged resources (such as HWND,         |
       |  HBITMAP and unmanaged memory) and present it together with   |
       |  the .NET memory information.                                 |
       |                                                               |
       |  * Optimize memory usage                                      |
       |  The heap-utilization tracker will tell you how the managed   |
       |  heaps are used. Together with the real-time view and the     |
       |  dispose tracker this information can be used to optimize     |
       |  the memory usage of the application.                         |
       |                                                               |
       |  * Investigate memory problems in production code             |
       |  Profiling memory problems in production code is greatly      |
       |  simplified by using the "attach to process" feature and the  |
       |  possibility to import memory dump files.                     |
       |                                                               |
       |  * Perform automated memory testing                           |
       |  The .NET Memory Profiler API makes it possible to            |
       |  automatically detect memory leaks and control the profiler   |
       |  from within the profiled program.                            |
       |                                                               |
       |  * Retrieve information about native memory                   |
       |  In addition to presenting information about the GC heap and  |
       |  unmanaged resources, the profiler also presents information  |
       |  about the native memory of the profiled process or any       |
       |  other process running on the computer.                       |
       |                                                               |

       |  A lot has changed since our last anniversary, and many of    |
       |  the things we have proposed back then seem to be finally     |
       |  getting accepted. The 0day scene is attempting to catch up   |
       |  with today's applications by proposing a new ruleset, and    |
       |  this is a good thing.                                        |
