Chabrol's stylishly perverse variation on the â€˜country bumpkin in the big cityâ€™ story has a provincial student visiting Paris to attend school and live with his cousin. Slowly, he is drawn into his cousinâ€™s decadent Paris party scene. Their rivalries over a girl lead to a tragic end. 'Les Cousins' was one of the early French New Wave sensations and along with 'Breathless', 'The Four Hundred Blows' and 'Hiroshima Mon Amour', catapulted the movement to international recognition. 
â€œChabrol's second film is a riveting and perverse study of decadent Parisian student life with a touch of Cocteau's â€˜Les Enfants Terriblesâ€™. The City of Light is captured by Decae's camera as if seen through the amazed eyes of Blain.â€ â€” HOLTâ€™S FOREIGN FILM GUIDE 

"Contains some of the best orgies on film." â€”PAULINE KAEL.
