First of all, if this even was true, one would call it 
""transcoded"", not ""rendered"". Second of all, I have the 5.1 flac, so getting the 320 KB/s mp3 is just as easy as getting a 128 KB/s mp3 rip (all I have to do is change the setting on dBpoweramp from 128 to 320). So I can just as easily make a 128 or a 320 mp3 rip. So you think that, for some reason, I want to fuck you over.

Second of all, this is the pirate bay. This isn't a private tracker. I don't get anything for uploading this here. I uploaded it here because I care about the community.

Third of all, if you want to bitch about music quality, get a what or waffles account bitch. Never mind that I'm a power user on waffles and an elite on what, so I know what the fuck I'm doing when I upload music. This is my 100th or so music upload.

Fourth of all, fuck you.

That's all.

PS: If you still don't feel satisfied, feel free to PM me and I'll send you a refund.


tl;dr You can be sure that this torrent is legitimate."
,JKaps,2009-12-20T21:41Z,"DaveHavok,

Probably not. I can only rip songs from the disc. I have no idea how to rip DLC. Sorry!"

,JKaps,2010-01-05T13:04Z,"Thanks for the appreciation guys. As corny as this is, I did it to help out the community. I've been torrenting since the very beginning, and TPB, along with many other public trackers (such as isohunt and mininova) really helped me get going. If people who didn't care didn't upload some great torrents, I would have spent a lot of money, and none of this would have happened. I look at this as community service, not being nice. Same to you. If you like this torrent, go around your house and find something that isn't on TPB and upload it, help the community out! Think about all the torrents you download. What would happen if those torrents uploader's didn't care?


""Hey, Elements of life / Satisfaction and Ace Of Spades / Groundhog seem to be somewhat corrupted whiles, WMP can't play them, check those. ""

I just tried playing them in WMP v12 and NONE of the songs I upped will work with WMP. It's probably because some media players struggle with songs encoded at a variable bit rate. WMP is shitty anyway, now is your change to upgrade to foobar/ winamp.

,Mr_Beaker,2010-10-14T22:49Z,"Excellent Torrent.  I'm a big fan of turntablism and these mixes are real interesting.

However, the songs need way more bass.  When I compared the Genesis mix to the actual song Genesis, the bass was very lacking, even with the ""bass booster"" option in itunes.

This torrent is amazing, but is there anyway I can change the mp3s to get more bass?"
,LionOfDoom,2012-05-23T23:44Z,"hey man AWESOME TORRENT wicked clarity and sound downloaded like a baws, only one request: is there anyway you can remove the Cheers at the start of the tracks pretty pretty please?

otherwise awesome torrent, I'm legitimately surprised by the quality "
,violek,2012-06-15T00:08Z,I love this
