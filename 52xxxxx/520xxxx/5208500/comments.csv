Hey Trickdaddy,

Those remarks from the other day that you claim showed Rush is a racist...

""the black frame of mind is terrible.""

Media Matters (and a lot of the mainstream media) wanted to characterize it as if he was the one saying that, as an original thought.  He was reporting that from mainstream media stories and audio sound bites from the Reverend Jesse Jackson.

Then the line, ""and I'm sure Tiger Woods' choice of females is not helping them out with their attitudes there, either.""  He didn't make that up either. 

There were already multiple AP stories chronicling quotes from black women who are just livid about what has happened.  

So all he did was repeat what the media (and a true racist, Rev. Jesse Jackson) have been talking about and offering commentary on it after he repeated it. You wouldn't know about that though, MSNBC and Media Matters don't report on those things.


And whoever it was that said conservatives are nazis...let the record reflect that Hitler was a far-left radical and the nazis were the ""National Socialist Workers Party"". Almost the farthest thing from conservative there is.

Oh, and let's have some replies with actual intellect. Trying to combine my username with the word pussy doesn't make you cool. It isn't witty or funny or make anyone feel sad. 

What it does is it makes you look like an immature child who cannot bring any counter arguments to the table. Just like a child, you whine and call your opponents names, trying to distract from the fact you have nothing productive to say."
