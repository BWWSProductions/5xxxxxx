CEMA Special Markets' Christmas with Bing Crosby is a collection of ten tracks culled from various holiday albums Der Bingle recorded throughout his career. It may not be as coherent as the official Christmas albums Crosby recorded, but it's still a terrifically entertaining collection and is of considerable interest to budget-minded, casual fans. Among the featured songs are "Do You Hear What I Hear?," "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," "The Little Drummer Boy," "I Wish You a Merry Christmas" and "O Holy Night."
