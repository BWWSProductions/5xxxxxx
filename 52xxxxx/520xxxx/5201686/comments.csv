,Critic_101,2009-12-08T16:17Z,Just needed to know why when watching ur .m4v files on ps3 theres always a very slight like .5 second of skip or jerk in audio only not video coz it happens abt twice or thrice and if i rewind it after it happens and then watch same scene again its fine! What could be wrong!? Ur rips are pretty good for their size and ur HR rips are sweet thanx for all the good uploads. By the way does ur videos have 1 pass or 2 passes when u encode them coz 2040 another uploader has smaller file size then urs and the black or dark bit did not have pixelation as ur did talking abt extraction credits start few secs when i compared them is it coz his files are 2-pass they have no pixelation in black bits as urs are showing.
,Critic_101,2009-12-08T16:33Z,"Oh for all u who don't know her work that is HR's 
Her rips are vgood i'd say 9/10 for psp and 7/10 same file if watching on flat screen lcd that is the small files made for psp. Her High-Res rips are of high quality judging by their size to HD quality. I'd say her High-Res rips would be 9/10 both audio and video. That be my own opinion and someonelse could have a different opinion."
,BlueBiggs,2009-12-08T20:39Z,"Thanks for uploading, could you upload wicker park in mp4 format for the zune? thanks"
,zombie_lord,2009-12-08T21:03Z,instead of asking HR why dont yall just convert it yourselves :/ thanks great DL
,Critic_101,2009-12-08T21:41Z,I think the problem might be at my end sumthin to do with the ps3 sorry and its not much of a problem either ur torrents on the other hand are very good. ur the only one i know who pays alot of attention to quality over quantity thats so advent in ur different torrents. coz the same files play properly over the psp. :)
,Critic_101,2009-12-08T23:12Z,I'm sorry abt the pixelation bit i think i got the files wrong it might be the other blokes torrent. Coz i just saw urs again and no pixelation was visible in the black bits my bad should be more careful before jumping to conclusions once again sorry. oh and my ps3 firmware is updated. thanx again for all the gr8 uploads. ps maybe its the latest firmware thats cauzin the problem coz i don't recall havin this problem before that i think. Plus as long as it plays fine on the psp thats what counts the ps3 is bonus. Cheers! 
,truth_or_dare,2009-12-08T23:52Z,I ask why no higres Porn the last one you upped was on the other alias was not higres also not the right aspec ratio but still good watch how about uppin one in the higres porn category. girl on girl action.

,Critic_101,2009-12-09T20:56Z,"First of all whats with the annoying big text when u open tpb always got to select single to make it normal gues have to enable cookies to save settings so don't need to keep changing it.
Oye! HR i think i figured out the problem with the audio, it's as i figured it had somethin to do with the ps3, as it happens the music settings-> output frequency 48khz or 44.1khz. Have to confirm it but one things 100% confirmed nuthing to do with ur video files .m4v coz when i was listening to mp3 stored on the hdd it did the same thing. Have changed the settings and so far have not heard any jerk in audio. So Cheers 2 ur great skills. Ps3 is an advance device thats 4 sure but sumtimes more advance means more settings to figure out! If anybody else is having this problem on their ps3 try changing the above mentioned settings. But be warned u won't be able to browse through ur files anymore with the music playing in the background coz that automaticaly gets disabled. Thats sumthing sony needs to work on in future firmware updates.  "
,Critic_101,2009-12-09T21:07Z,"Hey HR almost forgot for you to be the best of the best, that is if u want to be then theirs just one thing lacking in ur torrents that be soft- coded subs which can be enabled and disabled using the psp and ps3 menu. If u get that right then in my books ud be the best here on TPB, but that be just me. If not for entire video just for the non-english parts would be sweet and what would be sweeter is if u could soft-code it for all 3 platforms that is psp ps3 and ipod. So if u would be watching it on ipod subs for that would be seperate and if on psp that would be seperate. But i dont use ipod just psp and ps3 so just soft subs for these two would be more then enough and the reason soft coz hard subs are annoying u can not disable them. Just my humble feedback.  "
,Critic_101,2009-12-09T21:17Z,Well i don't now i had to change it from 48khz to the 44.1/88.2/176.4khz setting to get the mp3 to play properly have not yet tested ur video maybe when u up sumthing new. I'll check it out but i'm guessing if my mp3 is playin fine so will ur .m4v file coz on either settings when u select the info tab it shows ur file playing at 48khz.
,Critic_101,2009-12-09T21:36Z,your right that it should be able to select it auto but i'm still checking there is another option bitmapping that i have disabled and so far no jerk while using the 48khz setting so might just be the bitmapping option still in the process of checking and for the subs i have to date only used one software thats xsub and succeded in soft coding subs for ps3 that is for a .avi aka .xivid  don't know how to do it for ur file format .m4v xsub does no support it. Hope u can figure out how to change the programing for xsub make it compatible. Plus xsub is very light and does not slow down the pc.
