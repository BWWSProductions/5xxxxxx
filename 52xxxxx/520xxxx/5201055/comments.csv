Lets Define 'Noob'
Contrary to the belief of many, a noob and a newbie are not the same thing. 
Newbies are those who are new to some task and are very beginner at it, possibly a little overconfident about it, but they are willing to learn and fix their errors to move out of that stage. 

noobs, on the other hand, know little and have no will to learn any more. They expect people to do the work for them and then expect to get praised about it, and make up a unique species of their own. Mr Oktan Go to a forum for mainstream idiots to discuss your narrow & pointless ideas. Perhaps if you could at least write the word TEMPLATE without a mistake, you could get out of that noob section too.
