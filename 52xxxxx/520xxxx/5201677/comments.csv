,annoying1,2011-06-02T21:25Z,"hmmmm... how to play gmod??? that's kind of a hard question... ok let me put it this way as easily as i can think of... you ever thought what it would be like to be god? where you can just do ANYTHING withought any storyline you have to follow??? wel basically this is it as the name suggests it's a MOD therefore this game is all about modding GOD MODE all that stuff is allowed here and there is no story.. there's just you and a place... so do what you feel like... run around, make rockets, new characters, change gravity, make a hoverboard, pick up entire buildings with just a click of a mouse... just do what the hell you want... that's how you play it..."

,gkmfk,2011-10-23T21:02Z,the fuck? no instructions on how to install? now thats not worth my time i looked forward to this but no instructions means i aint getting this again.  and im not a noob to computers either i like it though were i can actually see things and look over them but this? ugh im kinda pissed casue i cant find anything on how to intsall i mean hell i even looked on google.
,gkmfk,2011-10-30T14:23Z,"ok sorry for being a jerk before and for double post but i figured it out for anyone who does not know how to play it you just wait for torrent to get done open up the folder use 7 zip or winrar to extract the games folder and then once done extract the garrysmod folder to the game folder  or extract then drag the game folder into the game folder now heres the hard part. to get the game to actually workyou put the whole game folder inside this location C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Garry's Mod if you want though i would name the game folder to Garry's Mod like what i did above then heres were its kinda tricky the shortcut will not work unless you put in your target  and path the one already set is the person that made this torrent so heres what you would put in for 64 bit computers target: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Garry's Mod\hl2.exe"" -steamï»¿ -game garrysmod -appid 4000. or it could be 4001 which ever you put they both worked for me for start in path: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Garry's Mod"" then for the icon, which you should all know just browse for the icon on the folder and put it in abd thats how it should work :) nice torrent by the way bro 10/10!!!"
