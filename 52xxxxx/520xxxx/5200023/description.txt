Nils Lofgren & Grin (2 albums): "1+1" (1971) &  "All Out"(1972)

Grin

Lofgren used the Neil Young album credits to land his band Grin a record deal in 1971. Lofgren had formed the band with bassist Bob Gordon, and drummer Bob Berberich, in 1969 and the group played in the venues throughout the Washington, D.C. area. The band had a strong local fan base, releasing four critically acclaimed albums of catchy, hard rock, from 1971 to 1974, with guitar as Lofgren's primary instrument. Lofgren wrote the majority of the group's songs, and often shared vocal duties with other members of the band (primarily drummer Bob Berberich). After the second album Nils added brother Tom Lofgren as a rhythm guitarist. Grin failed to hit the big time, and were released by their record company.
