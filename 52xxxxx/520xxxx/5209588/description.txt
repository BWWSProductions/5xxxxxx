Professors Iain Stewart and Kathy Sykes take a timely look at global warming ahead of the Copenhagen summit, in this film which explores the world's leading climate scientists' vision of the planet's future. They predict that if global temperatures continue to rise at their current rate, Earth will be one degree warmer within ten years, and three degrees or more warmer before the end of the century. The programme also explores various technologies being devised to offer solutions for a sustainable future.
