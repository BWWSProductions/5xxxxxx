,RuTz101,2010-06-07T22:27Z,"Agamenon9
that key you posted is missing 1 letter at the end. Its a 0, so idk if you did that on purpose or not, but if not it was a really lucky guess on my part.
so the CD key is really:

have fun :)"

@jaszicus
Try re-downloading it. I don't know why, but files can be corrupted/missing with one download, but perfect on another download. You should also bite your tongue since this is a FREE service you're getting, unless you want to buy the game?"

However, some brilliant scholar decided it would be a good idea not to put the CD key on the case or manual, but instead put it on a little slip of paper that falls out very easily. Now I can only play single player only, with a copied CD key."

Alright, anyways, prior to anyone downloading, I wish to heed you warning. When downloading this torrent, there is the chance that you may not download the data3.cab directory, and this makes it impossible to install. Most of the time it will not happen, but it happened to me my first time. I re-downloaded and it was there. So I suggest trying out another torrent if you don't have a high download/upload limit. "
,mihaihen,2011-08-09T15:32Z,"Awesome game and torrent. Easy install and 100% working, i actually played the bought version and it was glitchy, this one is perfect \o/ Thank's a lot eye >:D"

,jonnieeb,2012-02-09T16:16Z,"my mistake. i replaced the file before installing the patches. you need to do it in the exact order. i still can't get it to work, but i think that is a problem related to how i'm running this with wine on a mac, not anything to do with the torrent."

,ulfsarkhuskarl,2012-03-24T12:12Z,"Hello, this is my guide to how to make the game work in multiplayer with all races unlocked.
I hope it will work for you.

Downloads:

1.1d) Download the game: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5206293 (This torrent here)
1.2d) Download the race unlocker files: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4109780
1.3d) Download the race unlocker exe: http://www.file-upload.net/download-1142513/SSRaceUnlocker-v1.1.rar.html

Installs:

1.1i) Install the game.
1.2i) Unzip the race unlocker files (1.2d) anywhere you want.
1.3i) Copy ONLY the next files to your game directoy (e.g: ""C:Program Files (x86)THQDawn of War - Soulstorm""): W40k.exe, W40kWA.exe, DarkCrusade.exe.
1.4i) Open the race unlocker [as an administrator Vista/W7 only] (1.3d) and fill in the Classic, Winter Assault and Dark Crusade with the following codes:
Classic: 4124-350F-AB81-AC52 | Winter Assault: 458b-f302-1b93-d140-8c1f | Dark Crusade: 76c0-6973-cf45-9954-b935
Now click ""Unlock""
1.5i) Install the SS_EN_1.00_1.10_Patch and SS_EN_1.10_1.20_Patch then copy the rsss.dll into your game directory (e.g: ""C:Program Files (x86)THQDawn of War - Soulstorm""), replace the current existing file.

Beware:

You can enjoy the game and play with all races in multiplayer.
You may need to find different CD-Keys in order to play with your friends or you could be kicked/disconnected with a message like ""CD-Key already in use"" but this could be only for the Soulstorm CD-Key, it never happened to me but I heard about it.

Support the developers by buying the game!
