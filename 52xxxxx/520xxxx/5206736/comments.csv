When I didn't get anything useful for long, I asked a question in order to clarify crtain hings. However, my post was disapproved both the times, saying it was ""off topic"" [first time I'd posted it under the topic Requests: ""Things Behind the Sun (2001)"" & ""The Lost (2006)"", while second time, I posted it as a New Topic under the section ""General Discussions"" of the forum]. My post was as follows:

Few days ago, I'd requested for 2 movies by posting a new topic [Requests: ""Things Behind the Sun (2001)"" & ""The Lost (2006)""] at the ""Requests"" section of this forum. One of the users here replied that he had the movies I wanted & was willing to upload it. But the problem was that this user didn't know how to do so, & asked me if I can provide any directions. Since I too have no idea of how to do it, I replied so, adding that someone else here may offer the help. I thought that there will be some response soon from either an owner of this site or someone close to that position, someone whose main task is to upload movies & surely does know the procedure for doing it. However, I'm surprised (shockingly, of course) as there hasn't been any such response as yet!!!

No offense meant, but do the owners or anyone else having authorization over this site, except for the moderators, ever visit this section of the forum? Can anyone tell me approximately how many credible (requests that are in accordance with the ""Forum rules"" which specifically seems to despise LAZINESS!!!) made through this section have been fulfilled within the last 3 months?

I'll very much appreciate it if anyone can provide me the info I've asked for as it'll help me know whether to keep visiting this place to check the status of my request/requests or otherwise. Thanks."
,imrealgod,2009-12-15T23:04Z,"Poor, pathetic KLAXXON banned me from his/her/its forum. As if I was going to use that worthless, shitty forum anymore; especially after the incredible response to my requests & rejection of simple & straightforward posts. All I'd asked for was simple info, but that seemed to have scared the shit out of it as they thought that I was someone out to expose them & their malicious intentions. It's ironical that its guilt itself exposed it & the malicious intentions of its forum."
,KLAXXON,2009-12-15T23:06Z,"besides abhorring laziness the forum also requests that requests and follow ups are made in a polite manner.

we do not tolerate someone who wants us to do them a favour being rude to ourselves our moderators or any of the guests and visitors.

This is simply resolved on our part  by not producing any rips to those that are rude to any of the above.

which is the reason you were banned and removed from the forum."
,imrealgod,2009-12-17T01:48Z,"Will you be kind enough to point me out where you found the rudeness in the post I'd submitted, which was rejected twice? I simply asked for some stats & facts. If that's rudeness in your opinion, I can only feel sorry for you, not say sorry to you. Besides, my posts were being rejected saying they're ""OFF TOPIC"" both the time!!! How was it off topic when I first posted it under the topic directly related to it, namely --> Requests: ""Things Behind the Sun (2001)"" & ""The Lost (2006)""? Similarly for the second rejection too, how can it be considered as off topic under ""General Discussions""? I'm sure you've no answers to these, none honest ones at least. All you did was hide your face like a pussy, instead of revealing (or letting someone else reveal) the stats & facts I'd asked for. ""YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH,"" it seems. Probably because you aren't among ""A FEW GOOD MEN""!!!

So, would you dare to tell where did you find the rudeness in the post I'd submitted?"

,imrealgod,2009-12-20T02:18Z,I wasn't asking about my posts here. I'm asking where did you find the rudeness in the post I'd submitted on your forum (not the ones here) that you decided to reject them?
,KLAXXON,2009-12-20T10:45Z,"so you think you can be rude here and thats ok we will still do you a favour?

you posted exactly the same rude posts here as you did on the forum!!!


what exactly do you think you are going to acheive by debating this with us?
"
,imrealgod,2009-12-26T02:02Z,"I entered the post here, just to expose the facts, after it was rejected twice by you (or mod at ur forum) for unfair reasons. You didn't ignore my request because of my comment here, you ignored it b'coz the fact is that u never really pay attention to them. All you want is traffic to your forum.

Quoting you:
""what exactly do you think you are going to acheive by debating this with us?""

You're right, its useless to bang your head against a wall. So, goodbye & RIP.

PS: If possible, try to be less fraudulent next year!!!"
