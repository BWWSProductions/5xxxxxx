This here is a compilation of several Elder Scrolls scores. Itâ€™s not what one may call a â€˜full music anthologyâ€™, but itâ€™s pretty much everything a man could find surfing the Internet through and through. It proved to me impossible to find complete Redguard score or, say, Oblivion gamerip (if such thing exists). But here is what I eventuallyâ€™ve dug up: Arena, Daggerfall (two versions), Battlespire, Morrowind and Oblivion scores plus a two-disc edition of â€˜The Elder Scrolls Music Historyâ€™ â€“ compilation of the best TES melodies and some cover versions and remixes (thereâ€™s the Redguard title theme as well).

 
On the matter of quality: well, it differs. All of the tracks are decent: at least 128 kbps, mostly 192 kbps (Morrowind and Oblivion are fully 320 kbps). The sound of Arena and Daggerfall, though, is rather DOSish, if I may call it that â€“ it was created as .midi music, and converting it to .mp3 wonâ€™t change that. Still, if you are a hardcore gamer with a history and remember how you roamed the lands to the east of Iliac Bay â€“ then the question of quality wonâ€™t trouble you at all: itâ€™s a must-have release.
