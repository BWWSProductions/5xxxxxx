Description:

Wehbba, known for his talented productions in the techno scene, mixes some of the best tracks he released in 2009 with a handful of new ones coming out in 2010.

He goes on to say: "This is a collection of some of my favorite releases this year with a few hints of what is stored for 2010. I've had a very busy year working on on records and remixes for great labels such as Tronic, BluFin, Audiotherapy, Evolution Records, Stolent Moments, Suara, Eklektish, Missile, NightLight, Lo Kik and many others...2009 also Marks the birth of my label: 82 Recordings on which I have released some of my best work, and which is going really well both on vinyl and digitally, and we are planning some great new stuff for 2010.

I have also joined Tronic, the infamous label from one of the long lasting techno heroes from the past decade, Christian Smith. He has been on top of his game since the 90s, and his label Tronic has had its ups and downs, but came back full throttle in 2009, with many releases topping DJs and sales charts ...and to celebrate that we will be releasing both on CD and digitally a compilation mixed by me in January, plus one new single from me to "ignite" the compilation, more on that soon....
2010 is looking great, so I would like to thank everyone who has helped me develop my work this year in 2009, this mix is dedicated to you :)"

Enjoy!
