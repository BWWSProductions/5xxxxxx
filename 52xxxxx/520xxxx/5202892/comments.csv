,NoAnaesthesia,2009-12-10T01:23Z,"The offline works.

Only problem, I have sound on main menu, but none in game. Also, how do I take off the FPS?"
,NoAnaesthesia,2009-12-10T01:23Z,"Thanks for this btw, it really works besides, like I said above, the sound and well... really just the sound. The FPS is just annoyance, lol."
,raviraj87,2009-12-10T16:04Z,"I need help :P . I'm using Windows 7(x64). But when I run the ""setup.exe"" it gives me the message that ""This version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you are using....."" .
I think may be this ""setup.exe"" is for 32-bit OS. So can any one upload the setup for 64-bit OS so that I can atleast install the game..... Please!!!!! "

Anyone has a clue ?"
,andrewvf,2009-12-20T22:16Z,"@NoAnaesthesia  Yeah, I'm having the same problem as you! Looks like nobody else has been complaining about our problem though.

Does anyone know a fix on the audio problem?  I have full audio and sounds in the menu, but as soon as I start a single campaign after using this patch, I have no sound ingame..  Is there a fix or should I just start all over"

,mr357magnum,2011-04-03T14:36Z,"If you get an error saying ""MODE NOT SUPPORTED"" because your monitor or TV does not support the Games Default Resolution, then here is the fix:

All you have to do is, go to your shortcut on the desktop, right click go to properties. There should be text ""Target"" and next to it a line of coding like this ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" 

Change ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" to ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" -w 1024 -h 768 or what ever your Monitor or TV Supports.

That should force it to start up with those dimensions. Also if you wanna skip the video in the beginning, type -novid after -h 768
