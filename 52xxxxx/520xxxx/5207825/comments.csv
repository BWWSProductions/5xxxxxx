,DrVoltage1,2009-12-12T20:47Z,"I keep having problems  with .mkv files. I can play them fine on wmp, but then there are no subtitles. When I play them thru media player classic they are strangely choppy...Any ideas? Also thanks for all the work putting up these torrents for us all to enjoy! Thx to the seeders as well."
[T],youssef0eddoumali,2009-12-13T12:57Z,"@GracefulEase:in the past i use to stream them through a program that i forget the name

@DrVoltage1:mkv filtyopes or any H.264 stream are suitable to be played with media player classic because this player use hardware acceleration (DXVA) that stands for direct x vido accelearation that use the gpu core as cpu for parallel calculation proecess but still there is this little problem with subs that don't load .
here is the solution to solve this issue go to start =>all programs=>k-lite codec pack=>configuration=>directvobsub then in the tab general at loading switch to always load

eplanation on how o use hardware acceleration:

I always encounter that problem with WMP. Ever since I used VLC I never had a problem of any sort. If I were you I'll use VLC."
