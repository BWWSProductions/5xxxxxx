Do u have Brains ?

Why are u stealing other's Releases & posting as dupe on the same site .

I know that u are chor .. but jab pehle se originial rip site pe ... tum kyun chori ka zimma uthate ho .

Mujhe kisi se koi problem nahin .

Bas meraa cheej .. i.e KaMaL(DDR) ka rip chori karne tu soch bhi mat .

It is going to be very risky for u .

I don't care Wat xRG do or says .

U have stolen our Kurbaan , Tum mile .. etc chori kiya DDR ka .

Aur tum bolte ho ki main pyaar se baat karo tumhare saath .

Is that possible ?"

Hey , Do we have any dupe checking system @ TPB .

Cuz , same content ( same file) can't be shared on a site .

If a Release is not present on TPB . then i see a point in posting tat . But if its available .. posting a duplicate copy with diff file name .. doesn't makes any sense .

Thanks & regards"
