,tospace,2010-05-28T05:59Z,The best rips besides flac. Thanks. The only album I haven't bought is digital shades so I unchecked the rest.  The album is good and the quility is too.  Now I'm thanking about downloading the rest or just reriping my cd's to flac becuase my 320 mp3's suck ;)..
,eatmyskittle,2010-06-07T03:35Z,Great torrent. I give you kudos :)
,ZazProductions,2010-11-18T21:43Z,"Great, totally got it. I have a question, maybe someone can answer.. While WMP (Win7) can play AAC files, they sound rather fuzzy, whereas in VLC they sound amazing. Why is that? 

Also, I was going to try to check the 320kbps (just because you said to) and I can't load any of the files into Audition..

 Audition is completely installed with no problems, but it won't load. 

I understand you said ""aac must be wav"" but I can't put it into wav format now..

I'm SO confused!!"
,kirkteasy,2011-04-24T02:23Z,You know your audio!  Your a legend!  Awesome quality!!!
,StvnWilsn,2011-08-05T20:54Z,fuck yeah baby thank you!
,wolfean,2011-11-06T13:32Z,"Lord, save us from the modern day 'audiophile'....and thanks for making sure you distribute the highest quality you can so people will be less likely to buy the cd's and support the band"
,luvtpb123,2011-11-18T20:24Z,"cheers for this.

,icanhazbits,2011-12-24T02:36Z,"Please release in FLAC

FLAC is actually lossless.

preserve audio fidelity with FLAC

,monkey16,2012-03-06T22:12Z,"Your absolutely right on the .mp3 format being outdated and quite inferior to AAC. 
THANKS! .. for moving with the times and advances in tech. I only wish others would too.."
,USAGIxo,2012-03-14T20:05Z,"i have never, EVER commented on a torrent but i had to for this one. i read all you info in the description and i appreciate not only the information but the time and effort in upload quality torrents."
,spacespacespace,2012-04-01T00:44Z,"I actually have all these cd's except for digital shades.
  Back when I got this I decided to switch to MP4 for my lossy codec (Making a copy of all my flac also in MP4.  However 320 is 320 I think and I don't care about some minor differences that make mp4 slightly better.  Not anymore.   One of the most popular dj software I use doesn't support MP4...   From my point of view 128 youtube rips suck, 256 ones are ok.  320 mp3 is fine. flac is great!  Mp4 is not taking over in my book, its pretty much the same thing but with less support. 

Thanks for the great torrent tho, Iv'e enjoyed it for years."
,Xandror,2012-07-13T22:45Z,"How can it be the ""ultimate"" discography when they are still putting out records? ;). Thanks for the upload."
