Alex talks with John Young, an independent scholar, architect, and webmaster of Cryptome, a website that functions as a repository for information about freedom of speech, cryptography, spying, and surveillance. Young's site came under fire last week from Yahoo's lawyers when it posted information on Yahooâ€™s Compliance Guide for Law Enforcement, a 17 page guide describing Yahooâ€™s data retention policies and the surveillance capabilities it offers law enforcement. Alex also runs down the latest on the globalist climate change confab in Copenhagen, covers other important news stories of the day, and takes your calls.

HOUR 1: copenhagen climate change (notice: not "global warming") conference
has started, environmental war declared against humanity, media clips, 

HOUR 2: News, takes calls, U.S. Northcom is meant for you, history repeating
itself with illegitimate criminal government, gun grabbing and federal legislation,
AJ keeps repeating war is and will be declared against American people - possibly
through a cop killing staged event, training everyone to be spies and to be tracked

HOUR 3: Open Lines - licensing insanity - carbon tax - etc., more copenhagen
conference climate change claim for global governance, everything is being
tracked as part of the control grid, etc.
