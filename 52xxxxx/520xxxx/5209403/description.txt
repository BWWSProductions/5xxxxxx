1. Akuma na Koi
2. NYC
3. Dial Up


And I see this all the time, but the NYC in NYC Boys does NOT mean New York City.  It is an acronym coined from the first letters of the three front-men's last names (Yuma [N]AKAYAMA, Ryosuke [Y]AMADA, and Yuri [C]HINEN).  The New York City thing is totally coincidental.
