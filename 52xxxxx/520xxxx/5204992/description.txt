**** THIS PATCH IS FOR THE MP3 (not flac) VERSION OF THE TORRENT ****

__________


This torrent contains FIVE MP3 tracks only, to replace flawed tracks in :

Bach-St Matthew Passion(3CD)[c18](Archiv/Gardiner)[MP3][twistle] 
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5196403

These tracks are :

CD1 Tracks 09, 16, 29
CD2 Track 10
CD3 Track 09

(The md5 checksum file was included for my benefit, and will not match any files you have) 

Simply copy the contents of this torrent into the folder of the main torrent, overwriting files when prompted.

I think this fixes all the problem-tracks, but if you consider any others to be left unfixed, you can download individual tracks in FLAC format from  https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5204956
and do your own encoding to MP3.

Once again, my apologies for the errors in the original torrent.
