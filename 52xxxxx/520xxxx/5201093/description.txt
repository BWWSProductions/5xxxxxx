--==About==--
This program will browse the selected urls in a minimized, invisible, Internet Explorer browser window. Each url will be opened up in its own tab. It will browse the 4 urls the amount of time you set, close, and start again using a different proxy, if you want to use a proxy.

--==Setup==--
1. Enter the desired urls into the input box, press add ,save the urls if you wish by clicking the corresponding button.
2. Under the "Settings" tab, set the amount of time you wish to browse the urls for in seconds. Recomended setting is between 30 and 60 seconds
3. Also under the "Settings" tab choose if you want to use proxies and if you want to log bad ones.
4. Add valid HTTP proxies using the format given (123.123.123.123:444), save the proxies if you wish by clicking the corresponding button.
   If you decide not to use proxies leave the "Use Proxy?" Unchecked.
5. Click "Start" to earn some cash. 
6. When you are done CHECK the box marked "Check to stop"

-NOTE-
Manually editing the ini file may cause problems, do so at your own risk.

-Proxy Note-
Proxies do not last forever, some may last weeks while others a couple minutes. You can view the log.txt file for proxies that are no longer good. Error codes can be found beside the bad proxies and can be matched up with explanations found in the "Error Code" section here or googled.


--==Disclaimer==--
Use this program at your own risk, I will not be held responsible for anything. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions you can direct them to me on the AutoClickers forum.
