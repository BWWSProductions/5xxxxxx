The story of the campy 1960s sitcom that became 
a national phenomenon with Adam West and Burt Ward 
playing comic-book crime fighters "Batman" and 
"Robin". Viewers loved the wacky villains, including 
"The Riddler" (Frank Gorshin), "The Joker" (Cesar 
Romero), and "Catwoman" (Julie Newmar), but West's 
and Ward's careers were stymied by typecasting. 
Features interviews with cast and creators.
