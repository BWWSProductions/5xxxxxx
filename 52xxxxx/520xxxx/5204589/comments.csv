,asfbr,2010-04-27T03:45Z,"sorry to bother asking this, but how does this work exactly? i'm going to buy the motorola milestone(droid) this week, and i was wondering if you have to 'jailbreak' (ipod touch user) or something in order to use this apps. underbrallan said something about downloading another app (i think) from the market to install them, is it that easy? can i install them from my computer?

thanks."
