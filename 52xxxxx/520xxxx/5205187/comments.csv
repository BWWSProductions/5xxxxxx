,friik,2009-12-12T00:57Z,"Damn this really is a bad movie in every way.
The plot is so bad it makes you wanna cry.
But I was bored. Had some beers. 
This is a action movie with smoking hot chicks kicking ass and making love. If your not in the mood to think and not quite up for a porno then this is the movie for you! "
,real448,2009-12-13T04:36Z,TvTeam please use Repair record next time
,DeanMachine16,2009-12-14T03:20Z,"You know what...?
Screw the nay-sayers, this was one of the best T&A romps for a movie I've ever seen.

If you ever wondered what would happen if Quentin tarentino and Russ Meyer teamed up - this is what they woulda came up with!

I also loved all the over-the-top Hercules/Xena cameos in this.

Definately buying this one when it comes out on DVD."
,cockham,2009-12-14T11:06Z,DeanMachine16 must be one of the producers of this shitty movie who is downloading a pirated version of it for the lulz..
,kaaskop77,2009-12-14T21:12Z,"Good quality download, rubbish film, didn't lose the plot since it never had one.

Tarantino wannabe gone wild!"
,DeanMachine16,2009-12-14T23:46Z,"Not quite, cockham.
I just happen to think as far as cheesy T&A movies with boobs and blood go, this one was alot better than most of the others I've seen.
'Cept for maybe Lesbian Vampire Killers. I thought that one was awesome too.

:-P"
,Assistman,2009-12-25T17:31Z,Someone can release subtitles english for this film?
,Darkstorm1o1,2009-12-28T13:59Z,Question: Who uses CD-size rips nowadays? And who Multi-Rars CD sizes? All the extra work and diskspace used really made me not download this.
,stefany202,2010-01-03T19:45Z,"worst..... movie...... ever!!!!!
the fact that most cable companies are wanting $20 just to RENT this movie is bad enough, but regretting it after dl it for FREE is even worse, lol."
