,JockeStar,2009-12-18T17:17Z,"Thanks!

But remember, FLAC is not as good as the audio files. I do not know why, but it is.

But thanks to this great torrent!!"
,Meafer,2010-01-20T22:09Z,what are you talking about jockestar? FLAC *is* an audio file so what you said makes no sense at all.
,audiodude,2010-09-18T19:16Z,"Flac is an exact copy of the CD audio...
It soudns exactly the same as the CD...perhaps you are thinking of MP3 which is not a perfect copy."
,Tebbi,2010-10-03T16:25Z,FLAC is king oke? if u compare FLAC sound quality to CD sound quality u dunno what u're talking abouuuuut
,Razr92,2010-10-30T02:20Z,"Jockestar, wonder what you are high on"
,danny1991,2010-11-23T01:54Z,flac is audio format and it's lossless it's like mkv is video format and is lossless there both best formats out just need right devices to play and i want a audio converter that does flac as it's the best

Format Factory converts every format under the sky. And back. And juggles them and swallows fire with them. I dunno how that would work, but format factory would convert it to a format that works in this universe. Just sayin'...

Thanks for the torrent man!"
,Enverex,2011-05-02T13:01Z,"@danny1991: MKV is a container, not a video format so your comparison makes no sense. Also 99.9% of MKV files have lossy formats contained within them."
,Berend.botje,2011-06-17T12:12Z,"YOu can also use WINAMP for playing FLAC files! I used a lot of different Mplayers and winamp is one of the few with the decency of standerd including of the FLAC codec, and its a very user friendly player a well "
