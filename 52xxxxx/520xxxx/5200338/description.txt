I quote:

"Vampires' is really a western. James Woods called it "Once Upon a Time in Vampireland". So, in addition to all the heavy breathing horror stuff on the soundtrac,  I composed a Spanish guitar tune riffing off of "De Guello" the Dimitri Tiomkin composition used in "Rio Bravo" and "The Alamo" I played the theme on a Korg Trinity music workstation. Jeff Baxter added the pedal steel guitar.
We needed southwestern bar band blues, so the Texas Toad Lickers were formed. I got to play with legendary musicians. I also got shid-faced drunk with them one night. It wasn't pretty.
This was my second collaboration with	 the Bruce Robb held my hand and led me through it. He also played one mean B-3 organ. Of all my music collaborations, ours has been the best
I really dig this soundtrack. I hope you do too."
