"Alex talks with Tim Ball, head of the Natural Resources Stewardship Project and who is on the Scientific Advisory Board of Friends of Science, an organization debunking the myth of human-caused global warming. Ball was featured in Alex's Fall of the Republic and The Great Global Warming Swindle, a documentary film that was first aired in March 2007. The film showcased scientists, economists, politicians, writers, and others who disagree with the scientific consensus on global warming.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
