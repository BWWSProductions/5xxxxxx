Richard Marx Greatest Hits(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
____________________________________________

Richard Marx was one of the most enduring singer/songwriters 
of the late 1980's and early 1990's. This 1997 "Greatest Hits" 
compilation truly lives up to its title as it includes nearly 
every big hit Marx had during his successful heyday.

Mellow rock classics such as "Endless Summer Nights", 
"Now and Forever","Hazard", "Angelia" and Marx's signature 
ballad "Right Here Waiting" are included here alongside the 
more aggressive hits "Don't Mean Nothing", "Take This Heart", 
"Satisfied" and "Should've Known Better". 

It's telling that Richard Marx broke into the music business 
singing backup vocals for Lionel Richie and writing songs with 
Kenny Rogers and Chicago, for he kept to the straightforward,
middle-of-the-road approach of those acts once he became a 
recording artist in his own right--not that there's anything 
wrong with that. 

A dependable hitmaker throughout the late '80s and early '90s, 
Marx scored with rockers ("Don't Mean Nothing,"-
- "Should've Known Better", and ballads ("Right Here Waiting,"
"Endless Summer Nights" alike. 

Greatest Hits collects those songs as well as the lion's share 
of his high-end chart action--of which there was plenty, proving 
that a devotion to craft sometimes pays off better than fickle 
inspiration.
