A hellow to you 2040.
Thanks for the Bones eps you had I can get larger files slowly.
Am In recovery (I hope) from being unable to move or function for 2 years myself hence getting into tv shows (I'm a outside bush woman normally)
Hope you are recovering fella.It can be a lonely interesting road.
I have little horses as a part of my family.... big hearts I'm sure your dogs the same.
