any assistance?"
,alias411,2010-10-04T23:20Z,This key works on the download trial version of 5.3.1.4
,gabbyd6277,2011-03-16T21:08Z,Works perfectly. Using Windows 7. Thanks!
,jeezy103,2011-09-08T17:52Z,"For anyone claiming this doesn't work, you have to delete the C:\ProgramData\SlySoft folder (*Windows 7) after running the prog for the first time. 
Then rerun the key; it should register just fine.
