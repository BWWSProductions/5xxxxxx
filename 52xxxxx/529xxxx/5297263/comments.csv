,compno,2010-01-21T21:24Z,"Thanks for the up, but if anyone can upload it in a smaller avi format, that would be great!"
,Psylocke83,2010-01-21T23:18Z,"Please upload a AVI version, thank you."
,Psylocke83,2010-01-22T02:10Z,"zmacdaddy8, uh that'd be great except for the fact that I want the WHOLE show in one file and not just the Adam Sandler part, tyvm.

but oh for the love of coco... SMALLER FILES, AND AVI FORMAT PLEASE!!!"
,compno,2010-01-22T09:26Z,"Who cares about Adam Sandler? Thanks for the whole show!
