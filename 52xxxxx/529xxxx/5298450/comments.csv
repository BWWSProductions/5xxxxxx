TvTeam is uploading scene releases only."
,herniator,2010-01-22T06:20Z,"It's pointless to keep an .avi file archived.  It can't be infected, and after downloading, you would have to keep both the .rar files and the unzipped video in order to seed and watch, wasting hard disk space.  I will download, but after I unzip it, I am deleting the .rar files (so no seeding).  This is bittorrent, not usenet."
,herniator,2010-01-22T06:23Z,"Sorry, I meant I will seed until I watch it, then I will have to delete the rar files (hopefully after 1:1).  And thanks TvTeam for the quick upload."
,FreeTibet,2010-01-22T07:38Z,"Scene rule for distributing large files over Usenet, not fucking BitTorrent."
,jachim72,2010-01-22T07:55Z,"Just found the torrent from eztv, no rar! Fuck ""the scene."" This is BT not usenet. 

Stopped downloading and will restart on the raw avi like it should be done."

,einarz,2010-01-22T14:45Z,"thank you.

i unzip and then delete the .rar files. keep the .avi file.

everything else is waste of space."
,koka3,2010-01-22T15:57Z,"Thanks TvTeam, you're quick, clean and have shown to be very dependable, consisantly beating EZTV to the punch. As the comments show most people DO NOT want ""rars"". They're probably recorded as ""avi's"" then rared uploaded the have to be unpacked back to avi's,does'nt seem to make sense. Please please please think about ""avi"""
,jachim72,2010-01-22T19:24Z,"Said before and I'll say it again. Fuck ""the scene"" and fuck rars. It's a pain in my ass to have to extract this shit just because you want to stick to some obsolete rules. If people want fills of rars they got from Usenet, let them go back to Usenet to get them. "

,jachim72,2010-01-28T00:57Z,"adventurjunky: If you're talking to me, it's not the speed, it the waste of my time and effort to have to unpack it for no good reason or benefit.

FYI: My systems include: Quad Core AMD Phenom @ 2.30 GHz w/ 8GB RAM, Dual Core AMD @ 2+GHz w/ 4GB RAM and an Intel Core Duo @ 1.66 GHZ w/ 4GB RAM. I also have upwards of 5TB of storage, all told .

Did some reading about ""the scene"" trying to find out why everything's RARed. Sound like it's about 10 guys sitting around stroking each others' cocks."
,Barroquecore,2010-02-12T00:58Z,"@jachim72
Group cock-stroking sounds like fun.

@TvTeam
Thanks for the upload. I don't get why people are so upset about a few minutes of unraring and 350 extra MB on their terabyte hard drives."
