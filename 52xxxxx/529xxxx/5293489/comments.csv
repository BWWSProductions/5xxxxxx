,durrban,2010-01-20T09:51Z,"This is the updated version.

Sorry it took so long, it wasn't simple.  I actually had to write about 20 lines of ASM to do the job.  The only problem now is that it crashes on exit (it will still ask you if you want to save and successfully do so).  This is a minor flaw that I believe you guys can deal with, I know I can. 

If you make a killer game, add me in the credits :)"
,TheVisitorXY,2010-01-20T10:31Z,"Works like a charme now!! Thanks man, you're great :)."
,adamus888,2010-01-20T15:40Z,"Thanks a lot!
You ROCK!!!!!!
Cheers)))"
,insomnia3d,2010-01-20T20:00Z,thanks durrban.. finally crack out
,mrteasator,2010-01-20T22:57Z,"Thanks!!
But there are some problems with it.
First,  when i try to create new project and import Standart Assets, they are not imported, and manual attempts to import them after are failed too (it says something about permission)
I was able to create new project with assets only from initial menu, if i run Unity with -projectPath key with fake path. If i try to do from Unity Editor itself, it's crashes

Use the unity basic, to switch projects and import the pro asset files.

- get a unity basic license (this one is free btw)
- rename / backup your original unity.exe (e.g unity-ori.exe)
- copy the cracked unity.exe
- if you're creating a new project, use the original unity exe (unity-ori.exe in this example). This will allow you to import the basic and toonshader assets w/o problems. Close unity and open your cracked unity.exe, then on the Project pane, right click and select ""import package"" then select the unity pro package in your unity install directory and thats it. :D U have the pro assets on your library.
-if you're switching projects, use the original unity executable(unity-ori.exe in this example) to open a project, then close. Open the cracked unity.exe and there you have it. (unity opens the last active project by default)

These methods work for me until durrban makes another update on the crack to fix the crash on exit.

Thanks a lot durrban!! "
,Rbn_3D,2010-01-31T12:53Z,"Thanks a lot, Durrban, I have some problems:

At create a new project, i need to make it in the original .exe, because in the crack not works...

And the debbuger is saying every time, a lot of times per second: Missing method exception.

Concretely one says:

MissingMethodException: Cannot find the requested method.
UnityEngine.Terrain.CullAllTerrains (Int32 cullingMask) 
UnityEditor.Handles:Internal_DrawCamera(Camera, Int32)
UnityEditor.Handles:Internal_DrawCamera(Camera, Int32)
UnityEditor.Handles:DrawCamera(Rect, Camera, Int32)
UnityEditor.SceneView:OnGUI()

System.Reflection.MonoMethod:Invoke(Object, BindingFlags, Binder, Object[], CultureInfo)
System.Reflection.MethodBase:Invoke(Object, Object[])
UnityEditor.HostView:Invoke(String)
UnityEditor.DockArea:OnGUI()


In the original Pro trial exe I don't have this problem...

Sorry for my English and thanks again Durrban..."
,mrteasator,2010-02-02T09:51Z,"I was able to create new project from initial menu, that appears, when you run Unity for the first time (""Choose project to open"" and so on)
This menu can be called again, if you start unity with non-existant project path:
Unity.exe -projectPath c:\pr"
,slayer001100,2010-02-18T06:17Z,"I have to say a huge THANK YOU VERY MUCH, durrban. Out of all the cracks I've used in my time, this has to be the most thrilling one. I finally found a reason AND am motivated enough to learn C#.

I have but one question, though. I've been reading lots of documentation and all of them are literally screaming to NOT publish games based on a cracked engine. Now my question is, how high the odds that the team behind Unity would actually realize that I've used a crack? Assuming these warnings aren't there simply for copyrights/monetary reasons."
,chaosmachine420,2010-03-01T01:54Z,I cant make a new project or use my old project without unity crashing on me. I also cant put in the pro assets folder too without unity crashing on me.
,NimrodPSI,2010-03-18T06:10Z,"Perfect, works quick and clean. Thanks man!"
,Jash1,2010-03-24T00:17Z,What about the asset server???
,mibrons,2010-04-12T20:31Z,"Thanks durrban! You are doing a great service for starting indie developers to try if they are interested of game making.

Most people would stop when they see the price tag, but if they can test it out they can decide whether to go on or not.
When people start making proper games they will most likely buy the software."
,Zareste,2010-04-17T17:36Z,quite awesome. This program is just what I needed
,12sd,2010-05-10T15:14Z,"i have 2.6.1f3_31223 version.
i cant import any standart assets while creating a new project ether in basic(origin) exe. (it says something about permission)"
,Zer033,2010-06-26T17:23Z,"Hey thanks this is a really good game engine. I have a couple questions though:

1. Is the no importing of assets thing the only difference between the free download version and this one?

2. When I build my game after I run it and it's time to exit an exception error comes up. It doesn't really affect anything because it only comes up when closing the game, but do you know the cause of this?"
,AvocadoCake,2010-10-16T01:58Z,its saying fmodex.dll was not found... if you have it please upload to media--fire or the likes and link me.... or tell me how to fix this problem
