The Suicide Machines is the third album by the Detroit, Michigan punk rock band The Suicide Machines, released in 2000 by Hollywood Records. It was the band's first album with drummer Ryan Vandeberghe, replacing Derek Grant who had left the group the previous year. The album's musical direction shifted away from the ska punk and hardcore styles of their previous albums and exhibited heavy pop influence, leading many to classify the album as pop punk. A music video was filmed for the single "Sometimes I Don't Mind," which reached #27 on Billboard's Modern Rock charts.[1] The album itself ranked at #188 on the Billboard 200.

The album's closing track, "I Never Promised You a Rose Garden," was originally recorded for the soundtrack to the 1998 movie SLC Punk and was included on the film's soundtrack album.
