No On Screen Instructions, Only That High Pitched Martian Speak That Tells You What To Do... Most Of The Time I Was Just Too Lazy To Understand What They Want...

Also, Whats The Point Of Having The Option To Do Some Errors If U Do 1 U Lose A Life And The Game Doesn't Care If U Make 1 Mistake Or Every Move Is Failed... Game Sucks, Thats All. Gitaroo Man Owns All ;)"
