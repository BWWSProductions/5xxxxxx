Compressed with 7Zip, Both Game Discs was tested and work.


Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded 
      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.


You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.


Game Description:

This PlayStation 2 remake of the Dreamcast's innovative Space Channel 5 follows the continuing adventures of the lovely Ulala, as she sets out to conquer more aliens and rescue more Earthlings with her superior sense of rhythm and great musical aptitude. In addition to the instrument-based battles of the original, Ulala may also need to demonstrate her vocal talents to defeat some baddies in this adventure.
 
Graphics have been enhanced in this special edition, with fully rendered backgrounds and real-time camera work. As in the original game, new outfits earned in the main campaign become available in the Costume Room and rescued hostages may be able to offer advice. The strangely familiar-looking "Space Michael" also returns, to give valuable instruction to Space Channel 5's star reporter.

A two player co-operative mode allows friends to both control Ulala's actions with one player keeping charge of the direction buttons and the other in charge of the 'Hey' and 'Chu' buttons. While a two player 'dance off' can also be played where Ulala and the Morolians must out dance one another. 

Items and costumes discovered in the main game mode and Ulala Dance mode can be viewed and selected for use in the Costume Room. As in the first game, the character profile book referees to all character hostages you've rescued in the game, giving you an in-depth profile on each one. They also give clues on where to get items and where the hidden input points may be.
 

Features:

* Two engaging storylines, groovy techno tunes, fashionably in vogue characters, 
  and gameplay that players of all ages and sexes will enjoy. 

* Take part in 'Rhythm Battles,' in which Ulala takes control of a musical 
  instrument and plays in time with her opponent. 

* Give Ulala's singing voice a workout in the 'Lyrics Battle' mode. 

* Additional two player mode allows you and a friend to play co-operatively.

* 100's of funky levels to get down to.
