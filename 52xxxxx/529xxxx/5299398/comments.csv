1. This is an international torrent site with an accepted common language. When in Rome...
2. If you really, really must insist on duking it out in Dutch, grammar, it helps. I know, writing is hard.
3. This torrent could use some warnings, advise, or better yet, a full blown tutorial. But as noted above, writing is hard.

And that's why it's scam!!"
