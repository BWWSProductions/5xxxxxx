,o2thief_02,2010-09-28T01:13Z,"Can somebody, ANYBODY, seed this im stuck at 99.8%"
,rehtarded1,2010-11-06T02:27Z,"so this was my torrent, i was seeding for quite awhile, until my computer took a shit, sorry for that, and for the life of me i can't remember my password for that username, so as soon as i can come across the newer album and the ones i was missing i will make a new torrent and upload it, so keep checking back for it, maybe within a couple days i will have it"
,rehtarded1,2010-11-07T09:47Z,"@reeferman ive searched and searched for 'stoners reeking havoc' and 'stash box' but there extremely difficult to find, best bet would be to go their site and try to order them if at all possible, ill remain on the hunt for em though"
,Ryan420Blaze604,2011-02-11T03:16Z,fail torrent is fail. goes to 99.9% then back down to 98.1%. EPIC
,Knollex,2011-05-01T11:23Z,"The only reason why I wanted to download this torrent is because I can't find KMK 'Greatest Highs' CD in any higher quality than 192kbps.  Not even FLAC.

Obviously though, not all these albums are true 320kbps.

The 192kbps version of Greatest Highs is about 245mb...so then how come the supposed 320kbps version of it is also 245mb?

Fake and gay."
