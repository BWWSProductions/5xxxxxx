Even tho its Blu-Ray, people seem to fuck it up too many times. Crappy vid quality, crappy audio etc. So no, he aint retarded for askin about the quality ;)"

I've never ever downloaded a bluray-torrent that had bad video audio quality (and i only download bluray movies..)
so i kinda agree with azidtrip"
