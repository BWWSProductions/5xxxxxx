You needed help for cathrina? the richest country of the world needs money for others? if you gather the 7 richest american citizens they can rebuild the whole country. Let me remind you something: Haèª°ti is one of the poorest.And because of you americans..they're starving because of you.Why do you think you are wealthy? because you work more than others? BECAUSE you starve the half of the world,you steal them with criminals economical and  militaryl institutions.So shut your mouth and read books,and then you should wash your bloody hands"
