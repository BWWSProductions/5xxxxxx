,Legion1994,2010-01-23T06:17Z,"nice upload but where is the sample??? why is it so damn hard for you guys to leave that little file alone? if you delete the sample then the release isn't complete, PLEASE!!!"
,BigSniff,2010-01-29T15:57Z,"Hey Legion, this is complete, it has no sample, no other copy has a sample, unless it was added by the uploader.

Get a clue before you start ranting about how you think scene releases should be uploaded."
