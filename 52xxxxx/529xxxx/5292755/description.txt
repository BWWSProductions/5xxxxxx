ITUNES 9:-

During Appleâ€™s music event, the company said that many of the interface changes in iTunes 9â€”besides the new â€œshinierâ€ chrome finish, I assumeâ€”were designed to make the program easier to use and to make it easier to figure out how to get your media. For example, if you donâ€™t have a type of mediaâ€”say, musicâ€”iTunes no longer displays an empty list. Instead, you see a screen that explains how to get musicâ€”download it from the iTunes Store or import it from your CDsâ€”along with links to the Store and to tutorial videos. (Thereâ€™s no mention of Amazon MP3, eMusic, or other services, of course.)

Assuming youâ€™ve already got content in your iTunes Library, youâ€™ll see a progress dialog on the initial launch of iTunes 9 as the program updates your iTunes library. (The new version may also update your Genius information; more on that below.) Then you can dig into the new media-browsing features. For example, the Column Browser view now lets you choose between having the browser on top (the pre-9 approach, with the track list below the browser) or on the left (with the track list to the right). The new on-the-left setting gives you a narrower track list that shows fewer columns, but if you have a large iTunes library, it lets you view more items in each column as you browseâ€”a welcome improvement. You can also choose which columns to browse by: any one, two, or three of genres, artists, albums, composers, or groupings.

There are also minor interface changes that will trip up some users. For example, the green â€œresizeâ€ button in the upper left corner of the iTunes window no longer toggles between Mini Player and standard mode; it now zooms the window larger or smaller, just as it does in other programs. (You can still activiate Mini Player mode by Option-clicking on the green button, pressing a keyboard shortcut, or choosing a menu command.) And in Grid view, the headerâ€”which lets you change the grid groupings (by artist, album, genre, or composer) and adjust the album-cover sizeâ€”is disabled by default; you must enable it in the View menu.

Finally, itâ€™s worth noting that because it now does so many things, iTunesâ€™s interface is becoming more complex. For example, there are now six sectionsâ€”Library, Store, Devices, Shared, Genius, and Playlistâ€”in the sidebar, each of which contains its own sub-items, and each of those displays its content in the main part of the window. While Apple has indeed made progress in simplifying some aspectâ€™s of iTunesâ€™s operation, itâ€™s no longer the dead-simple program the company once touted it to be.
