Jefferson Starship is an American rock band that was popular in the 1970s and 1980s. Although its origins are complex, it is generally regarded as a spinoff from Jefferson Airplane and evolved from a 1970 science fiction-themed concept album by then-Airplane member Paul Kantner entitled Blows Against the Empire.
