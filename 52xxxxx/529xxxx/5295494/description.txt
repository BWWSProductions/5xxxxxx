Erasure Pop 20 Hits(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
_____________________________________

I'm not often enthusiastic about club-dance-techno-pop bands, 
most of which seem determined to copy each other to the point 
of exhaustion. But I'll make an exception for Erasure, 
which has a great deal more going for it than the vast majority 
of music you're likely to hear the next time you hit the dance floor.

Chief among the band's assets is vocalist Andy Bell, who has a 
remarkably rich and passionate voice--but Erasure does not rely on 
Bell pure and simple. It is the combination of Bell's vocals, 
a bouncy beat, and the often unexpectedly thoughtful and frequently 
bitter lyrics that do the trick. 

The result is a consistent sound that crackles with a sensuous passion, 
and at its best creates one memorable cut after another.

POP! suffers from the usual failings of every compilation album, 
which is to say that it generally goes for the obvious choice even 
when a lesser-known selection is clearly superior. But even so, 
it offers a solid overview of Erasure, from the purely danceable to 
the disquietingly emotional playing against the dancefloor rhythm. 
"Ship of Fools," "Chains of Love," and "A Little Respect" are perhaps 
 the side of Erasure that are most recognized--but when the selections 
turn to such intense and lyrically sharp selections as "Drama" and 
"Love to Hate You," you know that you've stumbled into something special.
