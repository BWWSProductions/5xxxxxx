,jauser,2010-10-27T08:51Z,"can it be explained more pls, how do I use it?
As a User, how do I use a CXZ Wrapper? (& if possible, specifically for the TorchLight v1.15, u didn't respond over there =[)

1. Download ÃŠÂ»CXZ Engines.mpkgÃŠÂ¼
done
2. Install Required CXZ Engines
???
3. Download the Wrapper (usually about 20MB)
???
4. Unarchive the WrapperÃŠÂ¼s Archive
5. Mount the .dmg
6. Drag the Wrapper to your Hard Drive
7. Install the PC Game (CrossOver, Parallels etc.)
is CrossOver/Parallels a game or a program
8. Install any required additions such as DirectX
9. Copy the Game Files from C:/Program Files/ to near your Wrapper
what's ""near your Wrapper""?
