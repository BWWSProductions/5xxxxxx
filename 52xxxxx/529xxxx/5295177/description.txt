Imperialism and the Clashes of Empires â€“ A Collection:

Imperialism and colonialism are tightly related to each other. Imperialism can be looked at as the political and philosophical driving force behind colonialism; whereas colonialism is a manifestation of imperialism. So, in effect, this  upload complements the previous one that was about Colonialism.

Imperialism had caused many major wars between the European empires in the 18th and 19th  centuries. These were culminated in the great WW1 in the 20th century that reportedly caused more than 9.7 million military deaths, 21 million military wounded and 6.8 million civilian deaths.

The consequences of WW1 was to create a power vacuum that resulted in the rise of Nazism in Germany and Communism in Russia. These again resulted in WW2 that reportedly caused around 72 million deaths (25 million military deaths and 47 million civilian deaths). This is in addition to famine and turmoil all over the planet.
