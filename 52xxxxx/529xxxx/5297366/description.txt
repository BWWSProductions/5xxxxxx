   Taken from the original movie review at http://twitchfilm.net - 
   "Shot in the classic, yet somehow refreshing 4:3 ratio, Robbie Ryan's 
   cinematography runs the visual gauntlet, altogether breathtaking and 
   decrepit in its suburban decay. Arnold and editor, Nicholas Chaudaurge, 
   shape Ryan's work into textured long sequences, where cutting is frequent, 
   but the flow of time is never halted, natural to a fault, and yet at 
   moments slows down to an almost surreal, lethargic dream waltz."
