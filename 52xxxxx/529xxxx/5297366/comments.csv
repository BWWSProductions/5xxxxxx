,BigSniff,2010-01-23T15:43Z,What's with the bitching about rar's? Fuck off if you dont want it. Like your life is so fucking important you cant wait for a fucking movie to unpack. If you want no rar's go download a renamed knockoff from no talent extremezone

,boring123,2010-03-24T12:13Z,"The problem with RARs is after you unpack it to watch it you can no longer seed it because the file has been changed. You can duplicate the file and unpack the duplicate and seed the original, but its a waste of time."
,mfran,2010-04-12T01:37Z,thanks!
,zerard87,2010-04-18T09:33Z,Thanks! 
,casstin,2010-05-02T03:41Z,"Ok, I'm grateful for the release and all, but seriously, what's with the RARs? And why are release groups still doing 2CD version of movies instead of a single 1.4GB file?? Does anyone ANYWHERE still burn CDs?? It's really damn annoying to have to join 2x700MB files into a single one."
,yoncenator,2010-05-05T08:45Z,"Yes I'm sure that the reason that misuseofyou was whining was because he was upset that he wouldn't be able to seed.

Why don't you consider ever UPloading something biatch?"
[T],dramacore,2010-05-23T01:12Z,"i think some people complain about .rar's because they have to extract the video, then if they want to seed they have to keep around essentially useless files.  "

,Tottster,2011-08-15T01:00Z,"D/L this as started to watch it on BBC2 but got interrupted. Hope this is a good upload as I stopped watching it on TV having missed a chunk of the storyline. If people are slagging off the uploader with complete disregard of the time and effort taken by them to share this torent. It's disrespectful and duplicitous as they are not pepared to spend a fraction of their time looking into a decent playing facility with codecs when their users have politely given them pointers as to how to watch it.............let alone take the time to upload socially relevant and evocative video's themselves. Thanks for the upload, I appreciate it and I am sure many others do x"
