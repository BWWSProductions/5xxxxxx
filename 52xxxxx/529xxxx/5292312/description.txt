Last Chapter - Paths To Always 2002



Last Chapter's second full album.


Last Chapter was notable for employing Solitude Aeturnus frontman Robert Lowe as guest vocalist on their 1998 debut album "The Living Waters".


This is a long forgotten doom classic for fans of Candlemass, Trouble, Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Cathedral, Solitude Aeturnus...


This original album is very hard to find in stores, you dont need to buy that anyways, the band disbanded shortly after the release of this album.


Doom and SEED on!
