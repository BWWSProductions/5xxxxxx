In fact, it is actually worse because every time you try to ""upgrade"" it, you actually lose some in the process.  To get better quality, you need the original source material."
,iSze,2010-01-21T18:58Z,"danger boy is right. Converting ""upwards"" is just like trying to make a low-quality image look nice. It's already shitty, so trying to improve the resolution will just make the shittiness look that much better. Or worse. You know what I mean."
,doradhorror,2010-01-24T02:30Z,"""I have increased the bitrate""

What the fuck am I reading



Bullshit torrent do not download."
,Aerillis,2010-02-01T23:54Z,Thanks for the warning all
,Illanair,2010-02-03T19:07Z,You would be right - unless what he means is that he has ripped the tracks at a higher bitrate from the soundtrack CDs. In which case it is perfectly possible to do without any loss. . .
,Nyctomancer,2010-02-03T23:34Z,"I'm no audiophile, but it sounds alright to me."
,dANGER_boy,2010-02-05T01:06Z,"Yes, that would work, but he didn't rip it off the CD because it isn't out yet!  The only way to get the ME2 soundtrack right now is through Amazon or iTunes by download.  The CD will be out later.  Get the original torrent, not this one."
,dANGER_boy,2010-02-06T04:32Z,"For some reason, the original torrent mentioned early is no longer available from ThePirateBay.org.  I have uploaded the original torrent below:

,LloydChristmas,2011-01-21T06:34Z,"Good files, so so music. Thanks."
,ScoreGods,2011-07-16T03:20Z,"You cant get a better quality if the source is bad
"
,iisthphir,2011-10-21T07:57Z,"actually, if the bitrate you are resampling to is a multiple of the original you won't lose any quality if using the proper method, if not the lower the rate the more quality you will lose. if it is a multiple it depends entirely on your method of interpolation or filtering as to whether you can make it sound better or closer to a higher sample rate original source. both are possible.

however increasing bitrate in mp3 is generally a stupid thing to do decreasing quality and increasing size.
I noticed that both torrents are the same size though??? so i don't know whats going on here..

anyway thanks :)"
