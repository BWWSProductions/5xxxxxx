NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Alvin And The Chipmunks The Squeakquel TS

And YES this is a real TS

We used our version 2 video for this and got the audio with our new toy that we got DayBreakers with.

Because its new and we are still testing to get optimal audio for you ... we had a dead spot in the movie .

So we added Cam audio for that spot. Also have cam audio for 8 secs in the intro . 

Seems the US version is slightly different from the version we have .....ENJOY
