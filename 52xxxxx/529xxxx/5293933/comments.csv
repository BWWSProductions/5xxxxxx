,matbl,2010-01-20T20:42Z,Why is this 2 gig bigger than the metis release? The description links to the metis release info btw...

It is 2gb bigger because it has 2mbps higher video quality. Metis release is 4.4mbps video bitrate, this it 6.2mbps.

Cheers to the ripper and uploader!"
,caliwillbemine,2010-01-21T14:17Z,"What about 1080p ??
I dont get why everyone release 720p instead of 1080 gosh....
We don't all have crappy systems!"
,psprapper,2010-01-21T18:20Z,"caliwillbemine,
what do you think about that they don't have the 1080p yet???
and the release is 30 march, so be happy with this. It's an early release.
and if you want the best quality, like 1080p fkn buy the movie when it releases."
,caliwillbemine,2010-01-21T23:52Z,"psprapper :
What are you talking about ??? They got this copy from a 1080p blu ray! "
,caliwillbemine,2010-01-21T23:53Z,Oh i always buy blu-rays. But they're not released yet.
,DivotDogg,2010-01-22T14:50Z,"Is this really a BluRay rip??  Has this movie been released on disk yet?   I thought it was just in the theaters??

This is just a movie theater recording.  Poor contrast and kind of shakey..  wait for the real rip dont waste your time on this file."
,DivotDogg,2010-01-22T14:53Z,"this took 5 days to download and is really choppy, its too dark, poor contrast, the audio is hard to hear and generally bad quality.  i dont think this is dvd or bluray rip.  seems like someone recorded it in movie theater with a cheap webcam!"
,caliwillbemine,2010-01-22T23:38Z,"DivotDogg :

WTF ? did you download it to claim such non sense ? It has the green pirate logo Hello!
I've watched it today, let me tell you it is a blu ray rip!
There is always a leak in blu ray facilities so we get them early. It happened for every major movie last year."
,aserhasan,2010-01-23T15:49Z,"@DivotDogg don't talk as an idiot i have downloaded the movie the quality is very very good and the sound is DTS do you know what the hell DTS is? search it on wikipedia, second thing a webcam can only be used on computers stpd."
,MuSickFinder,2010-01-23T22:03Z,"Using simple math 16:9 image in 1080p has 2.25 times the pixels that of 720p and needs 2.25 times the bitrate for comparable image quality. So that results way bigger file size for 1080p and usually in lesser detail because rippers don't always think about the resolution but file size instead

f.ex. 1.30hr movie in
720p = 4,37GB
1080p = 7,95GB
to match DVD-R and DVD-R DL media respectively
and therefore the bitrate of 1080p is lacking (only x1.81 bigger and not enough)"
,THECROW1968,2010-01-24T19:32Z,"Excelente,tanto en imagen como en sonido.Muchas gracias!!!!!"
