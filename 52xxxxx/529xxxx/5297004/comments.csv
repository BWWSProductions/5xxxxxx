,kimhongyul,2010-01-22T05:32Z,i was having same out of sync issue. was using haali media spliter 64 beta. i try stop using it. the audio came back in sync. im no computer genius but maybe that will work for you too. 
,rudavites,2010-01-22T06:22Z,THANK YOU ^_^
,Slaxwarez,2010-01-22T09:44Z,"@hitman02021980

I just registered to TPB just to want to let you know that i'm also using MPC and found no problem with the audio sync (so it means it plays just fine including the previous releases like SAW and Law Abiding Citizen)

I haven't tried VLC yet simply because i prefer player that allows me to use specific decoder for it and no i don't use and never interested on using codec pack

and oh btw my MPC setup as follow:

1. All MPC internal Splitter / Parser are enabled (that means i'm using internal splitter to parse the media container not using Haali Splitter but that is for MP4 Container only for other Container i choose Haali Splitter)
2. All MPC Internal Decoder are disabled
3. MPC internal morgan audio switcher disabled
4. H264 Video decoded by CoreAVC (without CUDA because im ATI users) for other codec type FFDshow video decoders are used
5. All kinds of Audio type decoded by FFDshow then going for on the fly encoding to AC3 using AC3Filter so it'll output Dolby Digital to my receiver
6. Renderer using MadVR

That's it basically and no remuxing involved

@Secretmyth

And obviously i want to thank you for all your hard work by joining this site :)"

The people that is having problems with the releases of SecretMyth, the problem is of your players and the lack of codecs ...

Use Media Player Classic - Home Cinema, provided with the ""K-Lite Mega Codec Pack"" and your problems with the viewing of any type of file no longer exists..."

Youre releases are the best!
but they are mp4, with srt wich i like very much but theres one catch, i can't play srt's on ps3 with loss of quality , do you by any  chance or someonelse know a way to mux the subtitels in or something?
sorry for my gramar i'm only 14 years old and i live in belgium , "
,Slaxwarez,2010-01-23T02:48Z,"@to those having audio sync problem

I just found that if you're using Haali Splitter (i tested on the 32bit version) to parse the MP4 file the audio will be out of sync, the easiest solution to fix this is:

- If you're using MPC:
Disable haali splitter and use MPC internal mp4 splitter

- If you're using Zoom Player:
Download MPC HC standalone filters and register the MP4Splitter.ax using regsvr32 and configure zoom player to use MPC MP4 Source and MPC MP4 Splitter to parse MP4 file

@arneblommaert

I dont have PS3 so i can't test whether PS3 can read or parse SRT or TTXT file but ... to answer your question:

If you want to mux the subtitle into the MP4 file you can use Yamb (and you can also convert the SRT into TTXT in case PS3 only support TTXT)

@Mr.Dockz

You could try AVI Mux but i'm not sure whether that would be standard compliant or not and would cause issue in playback or not :)"

,PoshNinja,2010-01-23T18:21Z,"The quality is great, but for those who use Media Player Classic may be a bit disappointed, or perhaps the glitch was only on my side: After about 10 minutes into the movie, the video and the audio may as well have been running an hour apart from each other.

In the VLC Player the English subtitles display the English language, but no other language that I know of, what I mean by this: The majority of the movie is in English, the subtitles are displaying what they're saying in the same exact language which makes absolutely no sense at all.

I haven't bothered to go any further into the movie to see if it actually translates the foreign languages or not."
,ChillyCrossFoot,2010-01-24T04:00Z,"1) How do you Disable Haali splitter for MP4 and use the built in MPC-HC instead? 

2) What else should be done? 

3) Has SecretMyth quality gone down? or gone up? Why are these issues affecting so many movies? ie SAW, Law Abiding Citizen, etc.

4) What's the deal with subtitles for Non English parts? 

Can someone please let me know before I DL? Thanks."
,hplp20,2010-01-24T04:31Z,Don't download. Video stutters for the last 15-20 minutes.
,ChillyCrossFoot,2010-01-24T04:37Z,"Ok, here's what I have done.

1) I use CCCP, so in Settings for CCCP, disable Haali Media Splitter for MP4 files.

2) Enable MP4 under Source Filters in MPC-HC

I did the same for MKV as well. So Now I am no longer using the Haali Media Splitter since this is what was causing the Audio to go out of sync. 

I also disable the Audio Switcher in MPC-HC and use FFDShow Audio instead. 

I hope this helps some of you. "

All of secret myths movies well most of them have the how to file it shows you how watch them on the 360, first you need to find a program called yamb its free to dl, then open yamb and click on the top option mp4 something and then add the mp4 file, when you add this it will have the video and the 6 channel audio, uncheck the 6 channel audio and then go into the other file that you downloaded with the movie torrent and find the 2 channel audio and add it to yamb as well, the edit the output directory and hit next, thats it, just wait about 5 mins or so so and then you can put it on a flash drive or an external hard drive and plug it right into ur 360, note the external has toe reformatted to a mac format for the 360 to recognize it and the program to do that is macdrive 8, you can find it on a torrent site with a keygen and everything just format it before u start loading it up with movies or you will have to move them somewhere first or erase them, sorry this was so long but hope it helps isure helped me alot Secretmyth is the best thanks again myth "
