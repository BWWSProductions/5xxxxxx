Task management has never been this easy.

Our screencast is a great introduction. Learn from our users why Things is different either on i use this or Newsvine.

The big picture. A Leopard style source list lets you easily focus without ever switching view modes or wrapping your head around filter criteria.
A magical tag bar automatically appears when needed and adapts to the currently displayed list. It lets you drill down even the longest list of To-Dos. Hierarchical tags? We got you covered!
Teamwork. Things offers convenient collaboration features. Easily delegate tasks to members of your team. (This is work in progress.)
No columns! Whether it's multiple tags, dates or notes, To-Do items display their information on an as needed basis. No more space wasted by empty or irrelevant column cells!
Out of your head, out of your way. A quick entry HUD lets you enter any idea the moment it hits you. Never let the thought of an unfinished business distract you again.
Things even supports GTD, so if you're familiar and comfortable with GTD concepts, you'll feel right at home.
