[V],thethingy,2010-01-26T07:55Z,"check your hosts file is not read only first, then right click it if you still cant save and select properties, security, edit, your user, take full control by ticking the full control box, click apply, then you can do what you like with the hosts, or if you cant be bothered with that download this one and replace your existing one;

I kept getting the ERROR 130:3 Error after a day... I uninstalled and restarted, and redid the installation, and nothings helping.

I ran the cleanups app, and i think it works... it doesnt seem to do much, it goes byu so quick. Could it be because my hosts file is always like the finalized copy?

I know its not the torrent, its gotta be me somehow, and your the only uploader to seem to respond to questions. Running Windows 7 64bit

I cleaned everything out with your tool set and went through again. You are right, this n00b learned to READ. I missed the last step in the install manual and Adobe smacked me.

A+ Filez, everything works without having to dl the entire Adobe Monster Pack if all you want is to edit and learn at your pace before spending the cash if you like it.

Don't get p0wned like me, RTFM!

i downloaded this torrent today and went though the instructions but by mistake i only edited the ""hosts"" file at the end with the final line included, and not in the middle of the process. This is because I didn't know how to update the file as an administrator and I only found out how to do so after I had done the other steps. now when i try to run the program i get this error:

,pegu06,2010-02-28T21:27Z,I removed all the adobe fonts and did all the things in your other torrent to fix 130:3 but Encore doesn't work at all and Premiere get 130:3 partway through use.

,Hellion87,2010-03-03T09:38Z,Awesome torrent thethingy and clear and ez to understand instructions.  Thanks!   Question however... How do we get the Encore CS4 Library content?   There is no Encore Library in this pack and since updates are of course disabled...  How do we get Adobe's CS4 Encore mistake fixed?
,Hellion87,2010-03-03T09:40Z,BTW Assuming you know but the Encore Library is required for menu choices for DVD creation.. so Encore works with custom menu but its very nice library is not there.  This is an Adobe goof.  Not sure how we fix it since we cant just log into adobe downloads. ?

The installation went just fine, until the very last step that was to open all the apps and then accept licence agreements. (I could not find anywhere to turn the auto updater off, btw) The programs just started to shut down with the ""ERROR 130:3"" , as many here have already commented.

I downloaded the toolkit, and followed those instructions as I should. I made a clean uninstall, and then a new prob appear. When I start the installer again after a clean uninstall, it stops before initializing is finnished, and I get an ""Setup Error - Setup has encountered an error, and can not continiue"" message.

I googeled the error, and found many solutions (which seems to be related to vista and cs3) but they didn't work for me on 7 and with cs4. Can you suggest anything?"

For anyone that installs this in the future (and/or who has problems like javelkjell), Make Sure You Uninstall All Previous Adobe Apps Before Even Beginning With Any Installs!!  I deleted my Premiere Elements and Flash and such.  But for some reason I decided to leave Air.  Big Mistake!  I tried all thethingy's fixes but none worked.  I then tried to reboot my computer with an img.  Didn't work.  Luckily, I was able to solve this with System Restore.  It worked!  After that, I re-uninstalled the Adobe Apps including Air.

,Janed2468,2010-05-03T21:52Z,"Dear thethingy, i have a few questions:

I currently have the cs3 complete adobe suit running perfectly. 

I want to upgrade ONLY the premiere.

so:

1. do i need to clean up only the premiere cs3, or ALL of the cs3 programs (that would suck..)?

2. on STEP 7 of the instructions you write: 

"" Go to the updates folder and install all of the updates in the numbered 
 order""

so again - since i am installing only the premiere, do i have to install ALL of the updates, or just the premiere update? 

3. if i have to install ALL of the updates - will that damage how all of my cs3 programs will run?

Thank you very much for your time!"

1) Just the Premiere update if thats all your installing.

4) I recommend uninstalling Premiere 3 before installing 4"

Also was wondering if anyone knows if there are any compatibility issues when you also have Photoshop CS5 Installed which already comes with multiple CS5 variations of the same types of software, for example I now have both:

Bridge CS4 and CS5
Device Central CS4 and CS5
ExtendedScript Toolkit CS4 and CS5
and Extension Manager CS4 and CS5

Would having both cause compatibility or stability issues and also being that the install process with copying the .dll file for Premier CS4 to multiple directories and the install process for Photoshop CS5 being different not having to change the .dll files, will cause any problems later.

In any case, thank you 'thethingy' for yet another great upload.

Please insert Disc 1 into Drive D:/.

My all installation files are kept on the d drive and the program is being installed at

Please help me!!

Thanks in advance"

I have followed all the steps as issued, but in the middle of the instalation process, it appears that some components have not been installed correctly. whoever, the program itself appears to be ejecutable, then when I try to open it, an error message will pop up, saying I have to reinstal it or contact support.

also, when I try to correct de host file via notepad, it wont let me do it even if i am the adm. or it will say that the file extension dosent match.

Got through the install fine, did all the steps, etc. and most of the software ran fine, with the exception of Premiere (the most important bit) and Encore. It just came up with a message saying the program couldn't start, something about licences (I can't remember the specifics).

So I uninstalled EVERYTHING, even Photoshop as there were various shared Adobe components I was unsure if they were related to Premiere. I even ran Revo Uninstaller Pro to check if there were any bits left over, and finally used CCleaner to wipe any left over fragments in the registry. 

So starting again, got about half way through the install and it just said there was an error with the installation. I clicked ""more info"" and the log told me every component had ""Error 2"", with no further information. 

This keeps happening. Even starting from a totally fresh install. 

The most annoying thing is, I had Premiere working months ago, but lost the original installer in a hard-drive crash, now every one I try doesn't work."

But when i tried to install this one, and double-clicked on setup.exe in (C:\Adobe Premiere Pro CS4\Adobe Premiere Pro CS4\Premiere Pro Install\Adobe Premiere Pro CS4) folder, it shows a chrome dialog box that asks to save or open a file (main.html), i clicked on open. Then it opens a page in chrome with address (file:///C:/Adobe%20Premiere%20Pro%20CS4/Adobe%20Premiere%20Pro%20CS4/Premiere%20Pro%20Install/Adobe%20Premiere%20Pro%20CS4/resources/main.html).

,stualmighty,2011-11-12T18:32Z,"Hi thethingy. I downloaded this and installed a while ago, so I know it works perfectly fine :)

Had to reinstall windows afresh recently and so have fully reinstalled today.

Premiere doesn't fully recognise avi and only imports the audio. I know that adobe has the fix for it available, but obviously I don't want to try the updater. Do you happen to have an update for the avi issue?

I have a work around using another program to covert the avi into a format that works, but when the file in question is over 1GB, it can take a while.

Any help would be brilliant, you are a champion"

,LORDLORD,2012-02-07T19:56Z,does this work for 32 bit windows xp ?
,skulldragon,2012-03-13T04:28Z,"Well, I have absolutely no idea what's goin on..
I'm trying to install Premiere and After Effects CS4, but, Setup.exe-s just hang and eat up my CPU.

Fuck, I remember I once had CS4 Master collection and everything worked, but thethingy's shit doesn't work.

Win 7 better than XP? Hell, do you even know what a computer is?"
,skulldragon,2012-03-13T05:17Z,"Figured it out finally. Debug showed, that Setup program required something via IE, but which was currently not assigned to IE, so I reassigned it and Setup started to work finally.

Ok, this time the problem was at my end and this magnet does work.

But still, XP is better than any newer Win OS! You only choose W7, because it looks ""cooler"", just like women pick men by cock size."
,Stevenator74,2012-03-13T06:47Z,"Love all your torrents thethingy.
I have used this one on a number of machines and installs.
I have now come across the first and only error.
PPRO will not play anything in the project window or the timeline, I can scroll back and forth but nothing will play. I tracked it down to a software conflict and began uninstalling stuff.
Then out of frustration I stopped all windows XP services. Yay I got it working, so began to restart the services til i found my problem.
Windows Audio Service (when it's stopped PPro works as normal, when it's on PPro won't play anything).... but I need that to hear stuff.
Going to try your adobe clean install toolkit and see."
,Stevenator74,2012-03-13T11:26Z,"Yes it is definitely a conflict between 'windows audio' service and PPro CS4. Just tried reformat and clean windows install of XP Pro SP3. Got my drivers sorted, installed Qt and VLC then PPro same prob. Disabled 'windows audio' in msconfig, restarted PPro works like a dream. Machine is HP Compaq dc7100 tower with correct drivers etc installed. 3.0 ghz ht p4 2gb ram asus hd5450 pcie 512mb graphics"
,Stevenator74,2012-03-14T03:58Z,"Ok I finally solved it. Anyone experiencing the timeline not playing should try this!
Open PPro goto edit>preferences>audio hardware.
open ASIO settings, disable the audio device in input and leave it enabled in output. Fixed it for me!"
,mrChe04,2012-03-17T11:23Z,"I really tryed x10 times to make it but just cant get it work, get to the part where is sas one of more apps wont install, you have to restart ur PC and virus and firewall close, but done that, and still it doesnt want to install premier pro and 1 other program, the rest it installs but those two NOP
