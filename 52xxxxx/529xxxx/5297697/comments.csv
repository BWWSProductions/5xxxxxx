,helloci,2010-01-22T00:17Z,Thx! What languages are included in the game?
,helloci,2010-01-22T00:34Z,No Hungarian subtitles? :-(
,Mans20,2010-01-22T00:46Z,"Lehet hogy a magyar feliratos csak 29.-e körül jön ki,akkor jelenik meg nálunk is,de remélem elöbb kijön."
,helloci,2010-01-22T00:49Z,"Hát az nagyon jó lenne, hisz egy ilyen játékot érdemes anyanyelven végigvinni (f?leg, ha a magyarítás olyan sikeres lesz, mint az el?z? résznél). Legfeljebb várunk 29-ig... :-)"
,2002killzone,2010-01-22T09:15Z,Do this game support game pad?
,gamatoinfo1,2010-01-22T11:44Z,i am downloading it from dream-tracker with great speed.
,steve30x,2010-01-22T13:27Z,@gamatoinfo1 good for you but why didnt you supply a tracker link?
,novem212005,2010-01-22T13:36Z,"I don't know why people are downloading here, it's surely gonna take ages due to the lack of seeders and high leecher count..and it's 14GB. lol Best bet is to sign up for www.dream-tracker (yes it's free, just enter email..create username..& pass.. & woola you got a new account with a private tracker). I'm downloading right now at about 800KB/s sometimes it's downloading at 1MB/s, the speeds are incredible. It'll be done in 4 hours for me :) So go sign-up now before they close registration..and remember to seed seed seed back :D  just google dream-tracker thepiratebay wont let me link it for some reason"
,blacklabel67k,2010-01-22T22:45Z,novem theres actually less leechers which means faster download. i was downloading at about 500-800 kb/s all last night and it was done this morning. compared to the 50-100 kb/s i was getting on the other torrent.
,Alaron251,2010-01-22T22:55Z,"oh shi 5000 leechers.

How the hell do you guys do this ROFL.

this was a day one purchase for me, I have to get it for the 360 anyway :("

,novem212005,2010-01-23T08:22Z,"Give it time people..this is a very large file. There needs to be more people with the complete file before the seeder count will go higher, which will = faster speeds. Just keep it running and as time goes by you'll be good to go. Leave it on overnight..through out the day..whatever. You'll be fine don't worry. So no more asking about the speed being slow"

,pedroribeiro124,2010-01-24T19:24Z,"I have seeding this game since around 3 or 4 am.
And will continue to seed for a few more days.
The game for me works fine there was only so far some minor sound problems mostly on conversations it happen two or three times characters skipping their lines and just standing without saying anything and if you happen to use subtitles sometimes appears some black boxes under the subtitles.
Anyway know how to import ME1 char for this game?"
,pedroribeiro124,2010-01-24T19:27Z,Tmvcarlos- it didnt happen to me i played the game for around 8 hours straight and didnt crashed a single time ...maybe it was lucky but so far the game runs great.

,wowme,2010-01-25T23:04Z,"ok, i just installed it with absolutely no problems, graphics are maxed and i created a new game. 

there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with the installation or game. you should be able to install and create a game with no problems, if you have problems it's your mistake or your hardware. 

of course i don't know after this since i just finished, but up to here everything is just perfect. simple mount iso, install, crack and play. 

thanks again for a great torrent, and yes i'll seed although some you out there don't deserve it :-)"
,Lady_Shadowheart,2010-01-26T00:55Z,"Thanks for the upload! I hate it when people upload an obscene number of rar files. That is for FTP, not torrent.

By the way, has anyone had any luck with importing ME1 saves? They're not showing up in ME2, and I'm really annoyed with the choices assumed by a new character (saving Kaidan instead of Ashley (female Shepard), letting the council die, putting Udina in charge, killing the Rachni queen...it goes on). I REALLY want to bring in an old character, but it's not working."
,blacklabel67k,2010-01-26T04:45Z,im having some SERIOUS graphics problems. i mean close up the textures look like garbage.... or theres something wrong with my computer. but the graphics look like a downgrade from ME. barely any graphics options in game so i have max everything in CCC. still looks bad. anyone else having this problem???
,Lady_Shadowheart,2010-01-26T07:29Z,Update: Fixed the ME1 save importing problem. You have to run the config and specify the folder where the saves are kept.
,blacklabel67k,2010-01-26T07:53Z,"ahh correction you need to turn AF up from the launcher, that fixed the texture issue."
,fubart81,2010-01-26T08:40Z,"just wanted to say thnx for the torrent works perfect on my windows 7 (64bit), intel core 2 quad 2.3, 8 gigs of ddr2 400 mhz dual channel, nvidea geforce 9600 gso at 768 mb. Game runs beautifuly with no problems. thnx again."
,fubart81,2010-01-26T08:47Z,oh yeah I'll be seeding for the next couple days.
,Esmad3,2010-01-26T12:57Z,"@NoFakeFiles: This could happen for a couple of reasons, but one of them is NOT that the files doesn't work 'cause they do, perfectly. My first guess would be the corruption occured when u transfered the files from one media to another (i.e. internal/external hd), it happens for me as well once in a blue moon with very large files. Dl again or use the original dl if it still exists."

any ideas?"
,kina13,2010-01-26T17:30Z,"FOR THOSE HAVING DATA ERROR during install:

Just re-download the torrent because you have a corrupted file that cannot be read, so the install fails.

Make sure when you re-download the file, it goes to the same directory where you inicially saved your first download.

You ll probably see a re-check of the download stopping at 99.9%. Wait for the 0.1% that is missing and try installing again.Good luck"
,hevox89,2010-01-26T17:47Z,Hey matusu. Google nvtt.dll download. When you have downloaded the file just copy paste it to binaries. Iam pretty sure this will work.

Totally normal if u have a good connection. It took me 7 hours to dl this and in the mean time i ul'ed about 50gb. Put a cap on it if u don't like it but u have to accept that most ppl have low upload speeds. Its not dissapointing, it's not even surprising."
,Esmad3,2010-02-14T17:34Z,"@ genius_kid: It does have a lot to do with your internet connection. I can dl every item on the games top 100 in hours (not simultaneously though:), not days or months and you will never ever see me whine ""seed pls"""

,DaSpartan,2010-02-19T02:58Z,"Okay, I've got the download completed, I've gotten the .isos out of the files, and loaded them on Daemon Tools- but when I open setup, it goes through an installation process, but only installs a bunch of web page links. Are there files missing from the .isos?"
,DaSpartan,2010-02-20T01:28Z,"Okay, it seems to be a problem with the installation script. It installs some links and other garbage, but when it tries to run the DataSetup.exe, it doesn't find it or somehting. Whatever the reason, it's not actually installing the game data. It doesn't say anything's wrong, either, just keeps installing the little things and says it's done. Any way to edit the script to make it connect or whatever?"

    * - Fixed an issue where weapon icons are re-organized after downloadable content is used.
    * - Fixed an issue where pressing F9 after the mission completion screen reset Shepard to Level 1.

,xiIix,2010-02-28T02:59Z,"0n1n3, where the fuck did esmad say he thought he was downloading this off of a server? All he did was point out how getting a torrent in X amount of time while uploading X GB was a fact of life. I'm quite sure that even the most moronic twat knows that the files are decentralized and rely on people instead of servers, hence all the fucking children in here whining about seeding."
,Esmad3,2010-03-01T11:44Z,"@ 0n1n3: You are allready embarrassing yourself, I will not add to it by childish namecalling, but I will do you a little favor by explaining why I'm right. The better internet connection you have the more simultaneous connections you can handle. It's pretty logical if you do know how torrents work..."

I among other have had problems with the game menu being blurry and the game crashing to the desktop during the Lazerus surgery cutsceen. after going through massive hours of searching through forums i have came across a solution to that problem, you need a file that was missing from the DVD called "" BIOG_UIWorld.pcc "" this will save a ton of headachs and frustration later."

unfortunately, i have been having the most awful time getting this game to run properly. i've downloaded this torrent twice and the same thing has happened on both occasions. everything installs fine, no errors. i crack the exe, and when i run the game it goes to the black screen for a few seconds then crashes to desktop, with only an error reporting box (no specific error that i can tell). any help?"

Try the usual updating of drivers, and installing the latest game patches (1.02 I believe is the most recent). Make sure you have the corresponding crack for the new patch (commonly found paired on this site). That usually cures most of my graphical woes."
