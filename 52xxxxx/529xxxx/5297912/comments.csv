If not, you're either a fool, hence fool proof, or there really is a problem in which case, post here, everyone seems friendly enough here =D )

only thing concerning me now is that none of the adobe apps installed from this torrent show an option to turn auto updates on or off, not even in after effects itself... will I be okay to stay online in that case, or do I need to do something else? thanks again

,alefre,2011-05-29T20:46Z,"Hi thethingy,

I've already downloaded some of your Adobe-torrents. They were great and they worked perfectly. Now I want to install Adobe After Effects CS4. Downloading went fine, extracting too. But when I want to open the setup-file, Windows gives the error: ""The parameter is incorrect."". When I try to open the other file (Windows CleanUp), he gives me the same error. Some programs of Adobe CS5.5 are installed on my computer (except adobe after effects cs5.5 and premiere cs5.5). What can I do?

I'm really looking forward to hear from you soon.

yours sincerely,

ALEFRE"
,nastynasta,2011-06-12T01:30Z,"hey [thethingy] thanks for all your torrent, i downloaded your aftereffects, photoshop, and premiere pro cs4 and i installed them just like in the instruction to change the host file and for each install i did change the host file even though the changes were the same... should i do that or leave the host file after the first adobe program i installed or keep changing it everytime i install each adobe program tnx."
,no.one.man,2011-06-13T04:23Z,"thethingy,

Solution; First download: 
Adobe Clean Install & Error Toolkit V4
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6021456/ADOBE_CLEAN_INSTALL__amp__ERROR_TOOLKIT_v4_%5Bthethingy%5D

1, Go to the HOSTS SET-UP folder and follow the instructions there,
   if you had to edit/change the hosts then restart and check the
   hosts has saved corectly then restart the app and reenter the
   serial if prompted.

1. Go to the ADOBE LICENCE RECOVERY TOOL folder and do the steps.

2. If that fails go to the CS4 LICENCE RECOVERY FOLDER and do the
   steps in the LICENCE METHOD 1 folder.

3. If that fails go to the CLEAN INSTALL folder and follow the steps 
   there.

(I did the license recovery and the 130:3 error was fixed)"

,Dextersd,2012-03-11T13:21Z,"to all who get the message ""licensing for this product has expired""...
.
The error ""The license for this product has expired"" is unrelated to the error ""Licensing for this product has stopped working."" An expired license means that a serial number, which is no longer valid, is still stored in the pcd.db database file.

Uninstall the application or entire Creative Suite package. To uninstall on Windows, use the Add Or Remove Programs feature in Windows. To uninstall on Mac OS, navigate to an application folder (for example, /Application/Adobe Photoshop CS4). Then double-click the Uninstall shortcut (for example Uninstall Adobe Photoshop CS4). 
Important: Before you uninstall the software, make sure that you have the installation media to reinstall it. Replacement media isnât available for previous versions of Adobe software.
Delete the following folders:  
Windows:  
/Program Files/Common Files/Adobe/Adobe PCD 
/Program Files/Common Files/Adobe/caps 
/Program Files/Common Files/Adobe/backup 
Mac OS:  
[startup drive]/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Adobe PCD 
[startup drive]/Library/Application Support/Adobe/caps 
[startup drive]/Library/Application Support/Adobe/backup 
Note: These folders are located in the Library folder at the root of your startup drive, not in the Library folder in your user home folder!
Reinstall your application or Creative Suite package, and enter the serial number from your purchased product."
