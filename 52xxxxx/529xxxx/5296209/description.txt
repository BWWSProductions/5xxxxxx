The true origin of this video....at first glance, it appears to be an R5 mislabeled as Russian DVDScreener... 25fps like an R5, borderline DVD quality, no Scr-marks...

Then I go to sync the audio and realize that the cam audio is 4 minutes too long...
so... what do I do?

Downsample? nah...

Drop frames? nah...

turned the framerate down from 25 to 24...;D

the movie flows much better at 24 frames per second... after trying this, the 25fps looked cracked out in comparison... 24fps fixed the sync issue in one easy move AND fixed a barely noticeable playback glitch at the same time...

now, back to the origin of this vid, 24fps is reminiscent of a screener, and the Russian audio that came with this is perfect... yet the Russian audio syncs at 25fps...

For all practical purposes to the English-speaking world, this is free of markings and has less than perfect audio, so expect the typical R5 experience out of this \"DVDScreener\"...

Oh, and special FAIL goes out to CRYS for taking the cam audio and calling it TS and wasting hours of my time today downloading junk with my hopes up... hey, at least the audio i do have is pretty dope, best out so far...

Overall, it took several hours to get this relatively in-sync due to a few small missing spots in the audio... this is close to perfectly sync\'d...not perfect but close...

P>S> V2 will be out soon with the T.S. audio synced with the r5 video source.
