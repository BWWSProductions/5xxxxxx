,gmbu2000,2010-01-21T11:37Z,This is a clip of the movie It's complicated?????? So is your other upload????
,gmbu2000,2010-01-21T11:51Z,I retract my last comment.While i was downloading it I tried to play it and it was a clip from It's complicated but after it finished it played The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. Weird????  I don't know what happened???? 
,doubledge,2010-01-21T16:49Z,"@gmbu2000:
I'd tell you what happened there, but I'm afraid you'd find the explanation too complicated! - lol"
,iray8t,2010-01-21T18:58Z,"Thanks for the up m8 but rather than DL this one I think I'll wait for your TS sound synch. Being first is great, and you are the man, no doubt about it. But being best is better, so I'll wait for your next version.
With respect."
,onmitt,2010-01-21T19:19Z,"+1 to what iray8t said.
Audio sux."
,sedative83,2010-01-22T17:06Z,"hey, do you know where i can get the version with russian audio? does it have original audio track (with russian dubbing i guess) or also recorded in a cinema one?"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2010-01-22T18:11Z,"So...the correct label should be:

The.Imaginarium.of.Doctor.Parnassus.R5-LINE.XViD-dROPER no rar 

THANKS! 
I'LL WAIT FOR THE DVD rip for the collection."
[V],raymondhome,2010-01-23T05:40Z,help what we can with haiti...the world is ONE big family
,euphorical80,2010-01-23T09:47Z,"thank you so much , with all these movies i was wondering when someone would make this avail"
,hanssonnr1,2010-01-23T15:09Z,"Not so great quality, specially the sound. I'm waiting for a better release. 
If you like watching CAM- and TS-quailty you may see this but else, do not download it."
,Widowlicker,2010-01-23T20:57Z,"Thanks for the up raymondhome.
The audio is not the strongest point, but not too bad.
Sometimes people forget how difficult and how much work it is to provide us with the latest movies.
Again, thanks for your efforts my man. Still I hope for the DVDrip-version soon.

Video 7 / audio 5 / movie 8

Flicks by Terry Gilliam are always worth watching. Specially with Heath Ledger in one of his last movies."
