,jmdr,2010-01-22T10:06Z,"Thanks Wull, that was actually me (I tried deleting it and re-uploading a slightly better package, but I guess it didn't quite work).

Please download (and seed) this torrent (rather than the other one)--I'll be seeding as much as I can for the next little while, but I've already got 70+ leechers, and my poor interweb's getting tired..."

,just_ask,2011-11-24T22:21Z,"eth works fine, but one important thing, i cannot open or import/export any databases with this portable version. 

I mean i have a database from my previous sas  (9.2) and I tried to open a it or import it into this version. but when i open explorer window within sas it does not see any ""external"" database files :/ As well, when i try to export already existing in this portable version tables, eth seems fine, but they are exported only virtually! i can see in SAS that files were exported e.g. to a txt file, but in windows they are not physically created ina specified folder.

btw, when i check access path to the SAS files within the program it says that they are in c:\program files\sas\ but in windows there is no such a folder! ( i saved they exe file to c:\sas\) 

any ideas how to go around this issue? thx"
