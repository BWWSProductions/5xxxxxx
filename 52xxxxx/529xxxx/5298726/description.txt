/* *** UPDATE *** */

I just uploaded a portable version of a newer version--SAS 9.1.3 SP4--see:  
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5375369

/* ************** */


This is the same file as at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4006488/ just wrapped up as a portable app. It *should* work just about anywhere, including Windows Vista and 7 (although I don't know about64-bit systems), I'm no expert and have not tested it extensively -- remember, you get what you pay for ;) -- so give this a try if you're having trouble installing it regularly (from the other torrent). If it doesn't work for you, make sure your system meets the minimum requirements (including Java Runtime Env't 1.3.1 or greater). Also, I've included the two SAS monospace fonts, which you may need to install manually. (And if it still doesn't work, just use R -- "http://www.r-project.org" or "http://www.revolution-computing.com")

*** If this download works for you, please consider coming back and leaving a comment to let others know--thanks ***
