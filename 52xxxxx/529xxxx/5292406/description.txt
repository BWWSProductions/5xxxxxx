Dark Void is a sci-fi action-adventure game that combines an
adrenaline-fueled blend of aerial and ground-pounding combat. Set in a
parallel universe called The Void, players take on the role of Will, a
pilot dropped into incredible circumstances within the mysterious Void. This
unlikely hero soon finds himself swept into a desperate struggle for
survival, joining forces with a rebel human group called The Survivors.
Trapped in the Void, these resistance fighters are battling to hold off a
mysterious alien race that plans to threaten Earth.

Dark Voids unique combination of jet pack-booster aerial dog fighting and
third-person combat brings a thrilling new gameplay dynamic to the
third-person shooter experience. Taking 3D action to a whole new level, Dark
Voids unique vertical combat system allows players to dangle from thousand
foot drops as they take cover and hurl enemies to their doom, bringing a
whole new sense of tension and thrill to the player. Will is also equipped
with a powerful rocket pack which allows for fierce in-air combat, hurtling
through the Void at blistering speeds while shooting down anything that gets
in his path.
