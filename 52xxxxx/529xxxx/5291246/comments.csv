,master_mind,2010-01-19T17:01Z,"HI, MYTH,,,,,,I AM BIG FAN OF YOUR UPLOADS,,,,THANKS FOR ALL YOUR MOVIES,,,,I REALLY DO,,,,BUT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE  REQUEST OF THE MOVIE ,,,CAN YOU PLEASE UPLOAD MOVIE wrong turn 3 and gamer and american virgin ,,plz???"
,Overmind_555,2010-01-19T19:11Z,"secret_myth is the new king!!!

I was, like most of people, downloading only axxo, fxg, fxm etc and their ~700Mb~ rips. They were really great and they deserve all the respect - in one word, they ruled.

But... Now it's time (for me) to move on! By coincidence I ran into secret_myth's BRRip and now I see what I was missing in those 700Mb rips - the quality!!!... which is in comparison to secret_myth's rips like a disaster.

I compared a ""typical"" 700Mb rip of GI Joe Rise of Cobra from one of those popular uploaders and secret_myth's 2,15Gb BRRip, and the difference is like a pickup truck vs Ferrari.

Ok, I'm not stupid to not see a great difference in filesize, but from now on, secret_myth is my first choice. If you people like movies, dont waste your time on 700Mb rips, they were fine in 1999... enjoy the movies in real quality of picture and sound!

And please people, share after downloading!!!

P.S. Hope to see 2012, Cloverfield, Hostel, The Exorcist: Director's cut in Blue ray rip ;))"

,pp_654,2010-01-22T04:43Z,"@Overmind_555:
Obviously they are better, because they're 720p rips; but if you want to have the best experience, try a 1080p releases of CROSSBOW or METIS...... those are awesome. "
,Overmind_555,2010-01-22T14:39Z,"Thanks pp_654, maybe I'll try them with Avatar"
,lb963,2010-01-22T23:43Z,"Thanks for the dl, will seed 'til the end!"
,misiek.bogiem,2010-01-23T22:54Z,"Damn, is it just me or some recent releases of secret_myth have audio out of sync? It happened twice: with dorian gray and zombieland BRRips. Has anyone else encountered such problem?
@secret_myth: have you changed audio encoding? Is it my equipment's fault (WinXP, Asus Xonar D2/PM, K-lite codec pack, media player classic)? Can anyone help me, I don't want to reinstall the system from ground up..."
,snorlax274,2010-01-24T08:50Z,"FIX Audio:-

get YAMB/MP4BOX and extract the audio and video streams from the orig mp4 file.

then create a new mp4 file by adding the video and audio streams you extracted.

10 min job...

good luck... "
,drmaxmyt,2010-01-24T13:43Z,"first time i got problem in audio with mpc but its ok with gom or kmplayer. weird. with mpc, audio is delaying like 10sec.."
,dimmai,2010-01-25T18:36Z,"Secretmyth is surely king
However im having same audio sync problems with some of the latest releases. Playback with MPC and Zoomplayer has problem but not with media player and vlc, but they suck (VlC sucks only cause of the digital out no audiodecoding not working).
I used mkv muxer. That solved it"
,misiek.bogiem,2010-01-27T02:05Z,"I managed to solve the problem with MPC temporarly:
In [Options>Internal Filters>Source Filters] I marked MP4/MOV position and it greatly improved the synchronisation. I then tweaked it [Audio Switcher] by setting time shift to -250ms.
It's a partial solution for it requires to be set for each time you play a movie with this sync problem."
,anyeuha_80,2010-01-29T16:30Z,Thanks! Looking Avatar bluray rip ver.!

Awesome quality, and works on my ps3.

Keep it up the awesome work SM!"
,GirishWinchester,2011-03-18T13:29Z,"Thanks SM. Come back soon. Waiting for more of your rips.
The audio is out of sync of most movies of SM in MPC or K-Lite codec pack. Try using KM player or GOM player. They work fine for me."
