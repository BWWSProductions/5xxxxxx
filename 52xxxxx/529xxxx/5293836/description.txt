Avatar Feature Article Entertainment Weekly HD Scan

I personally scanned this and optimized the quality, clarity, etc in Photoshop. I did not compress the images at all they are in full HD quality (approximately 7.1megapixels).

This is much better than the scans of the same issue circulating on the net at the moment.

I also included this among many other material in my Avatar Media Pack 2.0: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5290123/
