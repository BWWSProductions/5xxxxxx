Anyways, thanks k-k for the upload.

,yesterdays_pirate,2010-04-10T20:49Z,@weerab1981 is right look at his post to get the link for the correct serials. Thanks.
,DarkMan70,2010-04-22T15:19Z,Working great. Thx!
,ILikeMovies95,2010-05-02T22:02Z,For some reason even though I registered it says I'm not a licensed user..
,HamDaddy,2010-06-10T01:12Z,These are all bad seriels for me. Thanks for the up though!
,powercsr,2010-06-16T07:07Z,thx great work

,2tall_32,2010-06-30T08:01Z,can u update this? when u register it says database is from january? 
,vaijiro,2010-07-06T23:50Z,"Ok, I downloaded, installed and unchecked Uptade box at the end of the install wizard. Then registered successfully with provided keys and then updated.

When updating, MBAM actually downloaded the latest version and installed it. And now I`m with v.1,46, non licensed and those keys won`t work.
May be I should go to settings first and disable version updates...

Thanks anyway!"
,weaping_reaper,2010-08-04T17:41Z,"didnt work for me.. it installed, then when i double clicked on the app, it would just drool and do nothing"
,1st2blame,2010-09-18T06:58Z,can i update this?   Thanks
,peewee-hermen,2010-10-03T01:34Z,"after I installed the program, I'll try to start the program so that I can scan my computer, once I click on it it will have a little loading icon next to your mouse cursor, but then the icon will disappear in the program wouldn't even start but thanks for the upload for some reason I have used this before it worked perfectly but now for some reason it won't"
,martian_neighbour,2010-11-05T05:17Z,^^ I think the program found out that you're stupid.
,KyleHardstyle,2010-11-18T03:38Z,"For some reason i cant update, any solutions?"
,KyleHardstyle,2010-11-18T03:40Z,"Oh and for all you people that are saying the serials don't work, reinstall and at the end of the installation uncheck 'check for updates'"
,Infecthead,2010-12-12T03:06Z,"Clean and safe torrent, thanks!
Just remember though, after it's installed UNCHECK the update box. To register you have to type it by hand, you can't copy and paste. The first one worked for me. Again, thanks!"
,scoot9,2011-01-16T12:49Z,download great.  I try to register the key and I get invalid license information
