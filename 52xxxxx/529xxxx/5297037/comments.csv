First of all, whatever you're talking... it doesn't make any sense at all. So it makes you douchebag. 

Secondly about Muslims, If you wanna compare them with Hindus, we need to consider the perspective. If you're from Muslim (Lande) Background your mind is all set about Muslims. Because researches have proven that sperm affects your thinking ability. You need to reconfirm who's your dad.

About Mumbai, if you wanna say it Bombay, be my guest. No one gives a shit about an internet person. You are not gonna make any difference, in real life you'll still gonna say it Mumbai when you're in Mumbai. Unless you have courage to face the guys, there's no point in talking about it from the internet.

About Shivaji... Rajiv... Its a global acceptance and everyone follows it. If you don't know things properly, keep your mouth shut. Because if the next person knows things in it, you'll have to face consequences. You're doing exactly same thing here. You don't know a shit about Maratha warriors and Shivaji so You're not allowed to say a thing about it. Shivaji was a great warrior and he was a nightmare for Muslims. Gimme one example of Muslim warrior who fought for his own people's right. And please don't give me bullcrap of jehad and things. You should know the fact that Muslims are killing your other Muslim guys in Pakistan and I guess you're proud of that. Good for you. :P

About computers, 3 computers doesn't make a different if you're banned. There are generally 3 ways, they ban you. First one is on username, mail address and IP ban. If you have 3 computers and have static IP internet, it doesn't change things if you're using another computer. You'll still be banned because ban is issued on the IP. 

About your vulgar language. If you wanna use it, be my guest. But don't make yourself look like an idiot. Complete the sentences properly and use it like a wise man. Whatever you're talking, you look like an 10 years kid who just learned some new words. I'm myself cyber crime expert and I've authority to take actions against you and I can ask piratebay, xboard, desiproject or exbii for your IP and take legal actions. This is your last and final warning. Refrain from posting against any religion on Internet. Consult your nearest cyber crime office for getting information about penalties you might get doing such activities on Internet.

@OP, I'm stunned to see the release of this awesome movie so much early on Internet. I'll watch it in theater. :) "
