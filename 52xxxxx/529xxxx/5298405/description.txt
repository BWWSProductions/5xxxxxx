First Hour: 

O'Bomba gets a nasty message from "wee tha Peeps" on his one year anny of being "Teleprompter reader and Chief!" We are joined by Jake Witmer from the Joe Kennedy campaign. Joe was the REAL liberty candidate running in this crucial(s)election in Mass. Who was the REAL T Party candidate? What is the REAL T Party movement? Why isn't Ron Paul supporting guys like Joe Kennedy (no relation to Teddy)??? BREAKING NEWS FROM http://WWW.DEADLINELIVE.INFO



Second Hour: 

We are joined by Donna Conroy Executive Director at http://www.brightfuturejobs.com . Donna is an IT lobbiest working to keep IT jobs in the USA, and for Americans. She is champoining legislation to do just this. Lou Dobbs endorses it.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
