[T],rchp,2010-01-21T10:52Z,Thanks!!
[V],2nafish,2010-01-21T13:08Z,I have a program that covers up the logos and I can also mask the titles sometimes.
,goldensun87,2010-01-21T18:19Z,"Hmmm, it seems to me running the videos through this filter is making the videos blurry.  In other words, they're losing their original quality.  If I'm right and that is the cause for the loss of quality, then you don't have to use that filter.  The logos and titles never really bothered me :) .  In fact, I used them as cropping guides."
[V],2nafish,2010-01-22T03:34Z,I use the same program I always have been using but just take the logos off so it still is only edited one time. I've done it with several of my previous uploads so the quality shouldn't be changed.
