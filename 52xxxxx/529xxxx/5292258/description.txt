Sailing to Philadelphia is an album by Mark Knopfler released in 2000. The title track is drawn from Thomas Pynchon's novel about Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon,[1] the two English surveyors who established the border between Pennsylvania and Maryland, Delaware and Virginia in the 1760s. The border later became known as the Mason-Dixon Line and has been used since the 1820s to denote the border between the Southern United States, where slavery continued until the American Civil War, and the northern states.

The album has sold more than 3.5 million copies worldwide.
