,LquidSnak,2010-02-20T11:37Z,"The messed up thing is I paid for these programs a while ago, and they didn't work properly.  I contacted customer service and they basically told me to screw off.  Now I guess the joke is on them.  DOWNLOAD THESE PROGRAMS, the company is shite."
,JeffL4P,2010-03-03T09:50Z,"When I download it, it's already set to never check for updates yet it still reverts to a trial version.  :(

,walsh840,2010-03-04T13:21Z,"Hi JeffL4P,


The problem you are incurring is probably caused by the License Code Validation function put into these programs.

What is license code validation?

When a SoundSpectrum software product is installed, you will be prompted to enter the license code that was issued with the product. After you enter it, the installer will transmit what you entered to SoundSpectrum in order to check that it's a valid license code. SoundSpectrum's validation system does not collect, transmit, or retain any identifying information, and its sole purpose is to prevent software piracy. 

To avoid this problem, simply disable your internet during the installation of the programs. When the installation completes, disable update checking, turn your internet back on, and voila, you have now defeated SoundSpectrum's anti-piracy department."
,mc-elvin,2010-03-15T14:56Z,nice men
,smokey_mcbongwater,2010-03-23T04:05Z,"hey man, I disable my internet and put in the validation code and install it but it says ""validation code error reverting to trial mode"" anyway wats up with that?"
,Faziri,2010-06-20T16:28Z,"For those that get stuck when they have to enter the license key again, simply close your media player and whatever else may be using G-Force. Then go to the program files folder and delete the ""toolbar.exe"" in both g-force and whitecap. Next, open up your freeware firewall (don't rely on windows') and block every executable (.exe) in both folders. Cut it off completely from reaching the internet

the problem that makes it revert, is the toolbar: it requires separate licensing. Simply delete its executable and it'll work perfectly :) "
,Faziri,2010-06-20T16:35Z,"Update on my last post: ok, somehow it still says it reverts after a few times of loading it, but if you watch closely, you'll see that it's actually still the full version. You'll just get those stupid banners and such again :/

i don't get how it's possible though, i've blocked every executable that's part of it from reaching the net"

,DeepDarkerSpace,2010-08-25T16:03Z,"Aww... crap it isn't working for me any more, and I tired to remove that stupid trail message thingy and cound't removed it. Is there a chance you remove that thing it's preety annoying. ;/"

If you're looking for visualizations this is the torrent for you, just remember to install when disconnected from the net and DISABLE THE AUTOMATIC UPDATES before reconnecting."

,Imoen7788,2011-09-24T15:31Z,"Having same problem as the other guys. I do exactly as the instructions says but it still reverts to trial version. Tried following the instructions of Faziri but it didn't work either.
