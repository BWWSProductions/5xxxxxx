,sideteppr,2010-02-01T03:48Z,How do I run this once I d/l it?
[V],FerraBit,2010-02-03T17:18Z,"@sideteppr - I'd recommend a treadmill... (though I don't think Atticus would approve).
Here's my recommendation: in iTunes (free), create a playlist, add these mp3's to the playlist, sort them by track name or number, listen on computer, or sync with iPod.
Or burn audio CDs, and listen old school (tracks nicely labeled for this).
But your question suggests an unfamiliarity with mp3 players or software... or more.

Thank you again seeders!

One of the best books of all time, and IMHO, one of the all time best readings of an audio book - Sissy Spacek gives a wonderful reading (the only book I've ever heard her read). 
The reading is up there with the best of the best - Frank Muller's work (The Hunt For Red October, The Silence of the Lambs, Charles Dickens, etc...), George Guidall, maybe Kate Reading...
