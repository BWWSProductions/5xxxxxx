Storyline: When a dizzying robbery takes place in the Orthodox Jewish diamond district, a flawless 86- carat gem, the size of an infant's fist, is lifted in the snatch. Taking it to London, the diamond's thief and courier, Franky Four Fingers arrives in the city as a stopover en route to New York to deliver the huge diamond to his bigwig crime boss, Avi. But because Franky can't resist temptation and London is a town with its share of illegal trade, a small crowd of miscreants and malefactors eventually ends up chasing each other and the whereabouts of the diamond.
