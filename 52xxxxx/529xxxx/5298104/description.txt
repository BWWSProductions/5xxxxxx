                    Duty Calls.                              
                    DC Jo Masters believes that a man who broke  
                    into a couple's flat is a stalker, but must  
                    find proof to back up her suspicions. Jeremy  
                    Preston is apprehended by Josh Hunt at the flat  
                    Josh shares with Ami Ryan, but Jeremy claims  
                    under police questioning that he and Ami are  
                    having an affair. After Ami says that she does  
                    not know Jeremy, Jo discovers that the two work  
                    at the same place, and that Jeremy may be  
                    abusing his position as a security guard to spy  
                    on Ami. Meanwhile, Superintendent Meadows has  
                    some surprising news for Jo.
