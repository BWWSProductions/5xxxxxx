,TriniWarlord,2010-02-03T12:02Z,Is this the updated release? Or the buggy 1?

,BlockMe,2010-02-12T21:03Z,"Any version released before February isn't the newest version. One of the apparent bug is the additional Entropy skill (Drain Life) slot in every mage skill panel. Seems completely harmless, but with this bug, it is possible to put 2 points into the same skill resulting in a waste of a skill point."
