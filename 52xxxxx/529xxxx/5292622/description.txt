After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.

So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:

http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce                   
  
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce                   
  
http://tracker.torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce

Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. 

Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

I've searched long for the DVD version of Hamlet by Kenneth Branagh.
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_(1996_film)

Finally I found it on eMule.

It was a double DVD edition with English and Italian audio.
Unfortunately for me the only subtitles available in it were in Italian.

But I needed also the original English subtitles: once in my life I wanted to watch the movie with the original dub and with the precise dialogues in english written below.

You know - I can babble in English, but I would be lost to listen to Shakespeare's speech with no aid. So I said: Do it yourself.

I found the english subtitles on Internet.
I demuxed the two DVDs (which were also deprived of their menus) and rebuilt them adding menus and the english subs. A sore task, believe me... but the result was worth the effort.

There you have it:

PAL

For the main movie:
English, Italian audio
English, Italian subs


For the extras:
English audio, Italian subs

There are two ISO, each one fitting a single layer DVD and I added separately the two subtitles files in SRT text format (if there is someone so crazy amongst you who want to try to add his own subtitles: you can use the provided ones to synchronize yours).

The whole task was performed with free software available in Internet (VobEdit, DVD Lab Pro 2) and a small program of mine to shift the time offsets in SRT files for resynch.

If somebody is interested to learn how to demux and rebuild a DVD, drop me a note and I will provide you help.

The 2 DVDs work like a charm on my cheap DVD player on TV... So, enjoy :)
