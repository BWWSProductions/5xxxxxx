Also, I guess I need to get rid of Photoshop CS3 before installing this, because it shares a couple of apps with Illustrator. But is it safe to install Illustrator without removing previous existing versions of Adobe Reader and Lightroom?

,forestree,2010-01-31T22:10Z,Thank you very much for your answer. I have another doubt. Is it possible to install 2 or more of your adobe CS4 apps separately (Illustrator and Photoshop for instance)? Or would I need to download the master collection instead?
,forestree,2010-02-01T01:09Z,"Thingy, I apologize but I have another question for you. I used the windows cleanup tool to uninstall PS CS3 but the program is still there, same goes for Lightroom.

,revolvermd,2010-02-01T16:40Z,"Hey Thingy,
I really tried everything through the instructions and even also did the missing instruction with reinstalls and clean ups with that tool you gave a link for.  The thing is no matter what I do, I still always get a licensing issue where it tells me it's expired no matter how many times I clean and reinstall.  Is there something hidden in windows 7 that blocks me from completely getting rid of the old Illustrator?"
,PhiKap19,2010-02-01T17:10Z,"thethingy,  i followed the instructions and still got the msg ""licensing for this product has expired"" even with my host file matching up.  i assumed i must have messed up the install at some point so retried installing the file at which point i was getting the error that some components were not installing correctly.  so now i figured i did not uninstall everything correctly.  so i tried the clean install/uninstall tool, and now when i try to run the install file I get the ""Setup has encountered and error and cannot continue..."" and to contact adobe after it runs the system profile check when it kicks off.  so it would seem i cant even get adobe to begin an install now.  appreciate any ideas you can offer."

,PhiKap19,2010-02-01T19:58Z,"unfortunately i have followed those steps and is why i am here posting for support.  going to the clean install and uninstall folder and opening the instructions.txt file only states under the ""failure to install in whole or part or updates failing to install section to ""Go to the CLEAN INSTALL & UNINSTALL folder and follow the steps there."" which would essentially create an infinite loop becuase there are no further steps.  i went ahead and ran CS3Clean.ext from 1 CLEAN SCRIPT TOOL, and also ran CS4InstallerDatabaseUtility.exe.  The latter resulted in stating that ""There are no session to delete.  The CS4 Clean up Utility will quit"".  So if i have no CS4 to clean up, then what other options are there to fix this short of reloading the OS (Vista 64-bit)???  The windows install clean up utility also shows no Adobe CS4 apps installed.  I believe running the clean scripts from adobe has someone resulted in removing registry keys that are now preventing the .exe file from even installing (even if i were to buy the software).  FYI...your instructions worked perfectly on my desktop where an Illustrator CS4 trial was previously installed, but this is for my g/f's laptop and under the same circumstances something has gone amiss.  Thanks again for your help."
[V],thethingy,2010-02-01T20:28Z,"have you got system restore turned on?, if so try restoring to before the first licensing for this product has expired installation, if not there is a registry key to delete in the ""Licensing for this product has stoped working"" steps in the toolkit, even if you did buy the software this would still happen it seems the adobe apps that use the adobe installers are useless but the apps like photoshop elements that use the installshield installer work perfectly, if you have the memory, which running 64bit you should then if all else fails reinstall windows and install the adobe master collection first and have all the adobe apps including acrobat 9.3.0 and this illustrator;

,forestree,2010-02-09T00:20Z,"Thethingy: thanks so much for your great adobe torrents! Photoshop and Lightroom are now running fine on my laptop. I did however encounter a problem with my PC. Illustrator was running fine but when I set the date to june 2010 I received the licence has expired message. I tried the adobe cleanup scripts, license recover tool, cleaned the registry with ccleaner. But I'm sure that something was left behind from my previous CS3/4 installs. Out of frustration I used the amtlib.dll file from another torrent and that fixed it. I'm sure that the problem was just with this machine, so I wanted to thank you for sharing these apps and for answering all our questions so quickly. Deeply appreciated!!!"
[V],thethingy,2010-02-09T01:06Z,why did you set your date forward?
,forestree,2010-02-09T15:34Z,"When I install adobe programs I always check if they will be working in the future by setting my date forward. I know that sometimes people have had problems because they were working on a project and suddenly the app refused to open and started asking for a serial (even those who have legit programs). Becase I don't like that kind of surprises, I prefer to check right after installing and try to fix the problem before it strikes. I probably just worry too much, I know...
But sincerely, thanks again for your torrents, they are clean and they do work fine. And mostly, you are the only uploader I know that actually answers questions on a daily basis, which is simply great. Thanks for your effort!!!"
[V],thethingy,2010-02-09T16:54Z,"i see, problem with that is the adobe licencing service, it is blocked from varifing the key by the hosts file but apart from that it still functions and if you do things like seting date forward/back or shrinking partition or cloning hd to another pc then the licence service kicks in and shuts you down, it will function permanantly cs5 will be diferant as adobe wont be so kind when the key cant be varified itll shut down till server authentication happens but ill be hacked within a week though."

,kenjiron,2011-01-06T16:57Z,"people this worked for me when i got the message of licence expired:

get this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4888527
and use the ""me first file""

install illustrator cs4 and run the activation blocker

use de ""me last file""

i swap manually the .dll file that comes with the adobe fix torrent in . . .support files\contents\windows

and thats it, i skipped some original instructions like editing the hosts file.

i let you know if stop working.

thanks to thethingy for great uploads

hey thingy, what happen to your pet?"

,venezolanisimo,2011-01-31T04:12Z,"I think there is a problem with this torrent and the AdobeLM.dll: I changed it with the AdobeLM.dll from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4888527 (thanks user kenjiron) and worked it -at least until the first usage-

I had the problem ""Licensing for this product has expired"" appears before change this torrent AdobeLM.dll for the two ones from the link that I submited

Additionally, I turned back my computer clock before I added the new AdobeLM.dll, following this instructions:

http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/494/cpsid_49485.html

Wasn't easy, I felt very frustrated, but I need the software and I can't afford it right now."
