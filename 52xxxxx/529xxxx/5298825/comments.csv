[T],Ametz,2010-01-27T03:23Z,I get this: Pina3Core.dll is missing from your computer. (Win 7 Ultim~ x64)
[T],Ametz,2010-01-27T08:09Z,Pina3Core.dll missing problem was due to a miss. I accidently added the crack files in the root of the game folder /Venetica when it should have been in the /Venetica/bin/release_optimized folder.
[T],Ametz,2010-01-29T21:07Z,madhatter81 this is an english version.
