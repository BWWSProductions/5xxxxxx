,D_O_M_O_N_A_T_O_R,2010-01-20T11:44Z,"my mistake alot of great torrents
all uploaded yesterday 
thankyou soooooo much!!!!!
:):)
keep up the awesome work"
,TPBRools,2010-01-20T22:45Z,"From another site = ""You just have to unzip ""new konami....zip"" and copy it to your documents folder and then just unzip and copy pes2010.app to your app folder. But not eeverything is as simple as launching the game. Fisrt thing is you can't configure anything starting from resolution, details level, ending with button configuration. That's because settings is the separate application in PES2010 and you can't open it on mac. Second thing is that it runs very slow. I have copied my settings file from my game installed on windows and it reached 20fps. I have Imac 24"" with c2d 2,66ghz and 4gigs memory. The game runs smooth on windows with the same settings. The last thing that eliminates that game for me is that i can't configure my ps3 and ps2 controler. I installed some apps to get it work but the only things that work are sticks. If you have windows and it's not a problem for you to play on that OS, pass this release up. It's not worth downloading...."""

,SaVaGe823,2010-01-25T00:20Z,"I unzipped the Game, put it in the app folder and tried launching it with the different folders of konami. It pops up, but will not launch. can someone help?"

It says I'm online, but when I try to log in with my game ID, it says that the registration code (which was already inserted) is incorrect. This is a great torrent, it would be perfect if this issue was solved. Please help! Thank you!"

,ultraza,2010-02-22T08:43Z,Please help me!
,djoshua,2010-02-23T04:27Z,@ultraza..here are some possibilities....make sure you downloaded the torrent properly..next make sure you copied the new konami folder into your documents folder..not the shared documents...it should be copied to your user documents folder.....also this can happen if your system does not meet the required memory...try upgrading your ram... one of these should work...hope it helps...
,djoshua,2010-02-23T04:34Z,"@wildxchild...found a way 2 edit the button configuration....it should work for the keyboard only i think...havent tried it on a joystick...go 2 show contents of the application...navigate to the controller.ini file in it....open it with text edit...scroll down until you see the buttons that are used for the joystick...type the letters you want in it and your good to go....
P.S please backup coz ur editing the game files..."
,danielmiro,2010-02-23T04:45Z,"Hey ultraza...

I was having the same problem... The solution i found was to use a lower resolution on my screen. Beacause i was using a bigger monitor i was having that debugg shit. once i use the monitor of my laptop in the default resoltution the game just ran smooth. Also was having the joy2 stick problem. Once i deleted the bin files on me konami folder inside the save file... Everything start working beatiful... Give a try...

Sorry for the Experts... But for me thats the meaning of using the Comments... So stupid question will always show up..."

Thank You and please help!!!"
,jafuuu,2011-07-14T04:33Z,"Well.. once you place the KONAMI folder on your documents, it works perfect, only think I don't like is the little arrow above the players.. it kinda skip frames or something, lol, someone knows how to delete that?

btw, controls for player 1 are:

[Keyboard - Xbox360 Controller]

X -> A
W -> Y
A -> X
S -> B
Q -> L1
E -> R1
1 -> L2
3 -> R2

If you explore into: PES2010.app (show package content) > Contents > Resources > Transgaming > c_drive > PES2010, you can find an executable for settings, where you can change the keys and even use a custom controller.. it can be open on Wine, but even when you save won't make any effect on the Cider, does anyone knows how to make the changes take effect on it?

Thanks!, hope someone can fix this, will be great if I find something usefull :D.

Don't forget to post it guys!"
