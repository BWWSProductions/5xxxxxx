         It is the tallest and biggest mountain on earth, as far       
         removed from sea level as it's possible to be--and yet        
         its sedimentary layers contain fossils that were once         
         creatures that lived on the ocean seabed. The Himalayas       
         formed when India smashed into Asia--propelled by plate       
         tectonics. Everest is still rising but its height is          
         limited--extreme erosion counteracts and limits the amount    
          of uplift.
