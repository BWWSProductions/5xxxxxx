In this sci-fi comedy, a high school hood, Michael 
Harlan, procrastinates on his science project until 
the day before it is due. Hastily seeking to rectify 
his predicament, the youth begins scouring an abandoned 
military dump and runs across a strange looking machine 
with a large crystal orb. He has no idea that it 
belonged to a shot down alien space craft and that it 
contains not only the power to generate time warps, it 
can also destroy the world. If he did, he might not 
have turned it on. Unfortunately, he does activate it 
and sends his entire class back in time. The special 
effects are especially notable, as the kids roam Earth 
from the dawn of time, to the future.
