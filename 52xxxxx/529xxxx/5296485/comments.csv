[T],gamerguuy,2010-02-05T15:20Z,no i can't you will have to buy it from xbxo live :( i am sorry
,simpson_d,2010-02-14T15:15Z,hay i would like to no if this is PAL or NTSC please and thank you for the uploads keep up the good work and keep on seeding
,Kronical4,2010-02-21T02:29Z,"I would like to know if its PAL or NTSC as well. Also is the activation disc your talking about, is it for mass effect 2? If so does that mean there are 3 disc needing to be burned? I just got done downloading a copy of mass effect 2 that did not have the right video source, just not wanting to waiste my time again. Thanks for your time."
,Danny111,2010-02-21T06:38Z,Awsome Game !!!
,Powerfool,2010-03-19T08:08Z,"Just wanted to say this is a good download and game is working. For all of you having issues with wave 4, simply research ""360 waves patcher"" on you-tube. Don't need to update firmware or have iso disc. "
,Powerfool,2010-03-19T08:10Z,"It simply allows you to convert the game files to whatever wave you want the game to be. This will prevent putting in a burned game into your modded 360 and all it says is ""play dvd"". "
