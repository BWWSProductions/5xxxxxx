I had the opportunity to work with Shihan Avi in a seminar earlier this year, and he is quite amazing at what he does. He has real-world experience which includes many years in the IDF as offical hand-to-hand instructor and counter-terror, as well as service in the police. Now, he holds a lot of seminars and trains special forces teams all over the place. If you love them an find them useful, please buy at least one of them!"
