This is a Windows 2003 Enterprise x86 version, with SP2 (there is no SP3 for Windows 2003 Server) which is updated upto Dec 2009. No Tools like Nlite is used. Our aim was to create a version which is fairly stable with no flashy content like the other modified Windows running around. Normal Nlite based modified Windows might show some problems when updating/repairing a current windows setup. So about RockStable - Though we got the final aim of having a pretty stable edition, it has just one problem - its huge size. But we feel that this will be worth it.

And one more thing guys, this edition is for those people who want a Rock Stable OS and not for those guys looking for a blazing fast OS. This is not a unattended version. Rather this is a version which is attended and it can be used for repairing an existing Windows 2003 Server installation or for RIS (Remote Installation Service).
