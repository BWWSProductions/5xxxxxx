Thank you. I am sure a lot of work went into the production.
You mentioned that, ""it has just one problem - its huge size"". I thought it might be just related to the installed files, but my experience in trying to burn a CD-R (using Nero) is that I get a message that the burned image is too large and it will not burn.
I tried to put it onto a DVD, but Nero complained that it must be burned on a CD.
So, the question: How does one manage to burn a CD from the .ISO?
