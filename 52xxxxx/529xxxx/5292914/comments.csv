,rodrook,2010-01-25T16:39Z,"I downloaded it, which took a quite a long time. MagicIso in unable to read any longer after burning 27% of the file. PowerIso freezes up even before opening the file. 

Something is wrong with this file. I will try to scan the file with a anti-virus program later. I will let you know if there is any evidence of infection. "

,rodrook,2010-01-25T18:34Z,"I am sorry I spoke too soon. I've been able to burn this file with PowerIso at the speed of x8. Free Avg program did not find any virus infection.

I've not installed this Windows 7 yet because I am waiting of the shipment of a new hard drive. I will let you know if there is problem."
,rodrook,2010-01-26T02:05Z,Upgrading from Vista Ultimate went well until the last step where it asks for the Product Key. I don't know what to do.
,rodrook,2010-01-26T02:15Z,"Since I did't have the Product Key, I simply clicked 'Next' without entering any key, the installation moved to the next step without any complaint. 

No Production Key is required for upgrading."

,dacoi,2010-02-08T23:40Z,"Can someone please tell how the fuck to get rid of the activation countdown?

The installation of this needs no know-how, it almost installs itself. But under the system information, there's still a countdown, saying something like ""Days left to activation: XX"". Anyone who does not have that text, please tell how your computer differs from others."
,dacoi,2010-02-09T22:06Z,"I can also say that the Daz Loader did NOT work on an HP latop. It makes booting up impossible, and the Windows Startup Repair can NOT fix it. Reinstallation of another OS seems to be the only solution."

i noticed you are also spamming on No Religion's Windows 7 and Vista Activator - 32bit / 64bit - Ultimate, etc

,DijitalD,2010-03-15T00:02Z,This installs and works fine just follow the instructions.  I would disable auto update and steer clear of kb971033.  It may work but I wouldn't chance it.  Thanks for the upload!
