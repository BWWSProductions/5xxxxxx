What are UFOs? Are they logically explained visual phenomena, or are they actually visiting alien spacecraft? This video features interviews with a variety of Australian citizens -- ranging from children and housewives to doctors and bank managers -- who have seen a UFO and explain what they saw and what they believe. The program also includes recreations of the sightings and offers a provocative look at one of the great mysteries of our time.
