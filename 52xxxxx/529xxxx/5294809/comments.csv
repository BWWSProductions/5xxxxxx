,darling-model,2010-01-20T23:10Z,why dont u just upload this the normal way dickhead
,littlepuppy,2010-01-20T23:45Z,"Wow, 7 seeders and 551 leachers."
[T],keka_umans,2010-01-21T01:10Z,why is the archive titled 281? are you sure this is a fame girls set and not an FF-model set? and why is no one seeding it? fake?
,darling-model,2010-01-21T01:14Z,yes its fucking fake you idiots
,nepoelif_2,2010-01-21T01:14Z,"The piratebay tracker no longer exists. Use this one instead, http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce, or just upload without one since TPB adds one anyway."
,yarisdude,2010-01-21T02:11Z,"http://www.imagebam.com/image/ee2a4d64571905
It's this set and the files in the archive is labeled v084-xxx-lg.jpg"

[T],keka_umans,2010-01-21T03:00Z,@sandraphile   http://torrentfreak.com/common-bittorrent-dht-myths-091024/ to learn about DHT
,Sandraphile,2010-01-21T07:33Z,"@ keka_umans , thanks for the info link. It is still a bit over my head but I think I have a good general idea of what DHT is now. "
[T],keka_umans,2010-01-21T08:22Z,"7+ hours and only 88%
@holymanpaul...did you read the how to upload section? make sure dht is enabled"
,tngf,2010-01-21T15:20Z,"Finally finished downloading, and it's not a fake upload or anything. Just took forever. Now that we have some more seeders, I think it's moving along more normally."
,darling-model,2010-01-21T18:49Z,still its a dicky way to upload a torrent
,xciterx,2010-01-21T19:33Z,"@darling-model  ...shut up MORON!

Thanks holymanpaul"
,tngf,2010-01-22T08:31Z,"darling-model, if you can do better, please do. You can start with this week's Ella set, since it doesn't seem to be posted by anyone yet. Otherwise, quit whining that stuff you get for free doesn't come fast enough, and just thank holymanpaul for uploading at all."
