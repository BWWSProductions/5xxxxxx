Spirit Caravan - Jug Fulla Sun 1999



Spirit Caravan's first full album release!

It doesn't get any better than this, in my humble oppinion Wino's most underrated release!

Spirit Caravan (first the band was named "Shine") is the band Wino formed after playing in Saint Vitus and The Obsessed, an absolute -very hard to find- milestone for DOOM metal fanatics!

1999 - Jug Fulla Sun

After the band was disbanded Wino did an album with Victor Griffin's Place of Skulls and later formed The Hidden Hand, after this band was disbanded he did a great solo album.
