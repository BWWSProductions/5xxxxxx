Please let me know if you interested, its very easy, you just need Media Player Classic and a Video card that support Pixel Shader"
,10101011,2010-01-22T22:41Z,"ryannining, what are the setting required to get that quality"
,ryannining,2010-01-23T05:16Z,"Well guys, try put this on Shaders (media player classic). You can edit shader for example, Invert.

sampler s0 : register(s0);
float4 p0 : register(c0);

float4 main(float2 tex : TEXCOORD0) : COLOR
{
float3 LuminanceWeights = float3(0.299,0.587,0.114);
float4 c0 = tex2D(s0, tex);
c0=pow(c0,float4(0.68,0.76,0.86,1));
c0=c0-float4(0.011,0.020,0.029,0);
c0=c0*float4(1.148,1.159,1.104,1);
float lum = dot(c0,LuminanceWeights);
float r1=max(0,(0.25-lum));
float r2=1-r1;
float4 c1=float4(lum,lum,lum,0)*r1;
c0=pow(c1+c0*float4(r2,r2,r2,1),1.1);
c0=lerp(lum,c0,1.6);
c0=max(0,c0)*0.9-0.03;
return c0;
}

And then combine with other shader sch sharpness is possible, you will get a better TS screen. "
,ryannining,2010-01-23T05:19Z,"if you dont understand, well, i will try to make some tutorial. Also a tutorial to fix the color permanently using VirtualDub , so you can get good TS Video anywhere (i am reencode to my Mobile phone, so i can watch anywhere)"
,doubledge,2010-01-27T07:08Z,"@ryannining :
(and anyone else experimenting with pixel shaders):
A word of advise - BEFORE you edit one of the preset shaders (like ""invert"") COPY & PASTE the original (notepad works) so that you can restore it if you need to.

@ryannining : Tried you settings, but didn't quite get the results you did - (probably due to different video cards, etc.) 
These settings produce a lot of noise in my red gamma channel - the overall hue leans more toward red/yellow rather than the blue/green effect that you got.  
What pixel shader did you use? there are settings for 1, 2, & 3 - BOTH HARDWARE & SOFTWARE! (My card supports 3.0, but i tried them all - lol)"
,jbailes,2010-01-30T04:57Z,Has anyone gotten past 1.2% yet?
