This is the first ever debut by folk up-and-comers Shane & Jig.
First recorded in a small flat in Petone, these boys have since made it big signing on to do records with DawnRaid (Savage, Deceptikonz, Scribe); one of New Zealand's top and most credible record labels. They have also played numerous festivals throughout Aotearoa including opening for Blindspott at 'Christmas in the Park 2007'
