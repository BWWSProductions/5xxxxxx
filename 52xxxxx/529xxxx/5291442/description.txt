Defamation -  True Stories - Ch4 - UK - Zionism

The True Stories strand, which showcases the best international feature documentaries, continues with Yoav Shamir's controversial, personal exploration which asks, "What is anti-Semitism today?" Is it a real and continuous danger that requires eternal
vigilance or a tactic used by right-wing Zionists to discredit and cow their critics? 

Among those he interviews are Abe Foxman, head of the Anti-Defamation League, who is adamant that anti-Semitism is rife and must be exposed; while Norman Finkelstein, author of The Holocaust Industry: The Exploitation of Jewish Suffering, claims that anti-Semitism
is being used for political gain. 

Opinions differ and tempers flare but Shamir's directness and wry humour, as shown in his other films including Checkpoint, 5 Days and Flipping Out, elevate the mood as he tackles extremely difficult questions.
