Torrent from Demoniod:

This is a quirky, funny, Steampunk Sci-Fi Western series that is a gem which has been overlooked for too long in my opinion.I originally watched this show when it aired and loved it. I purchased some Video CDs off a friend years ago and decided to copy them down to AVI and share them. THESE ARE AT VIDEO CD/VHS QUALITY. There is nothing I can do about as that's the original source I have.

There hasn't been any hint about releasing this show to DVD even though Richard Dean Anderson spoke favorably of it and his time producing and acting in it. This is before Stargate SG-1 was on television and this features Richard Dean Anderson and John De Lancie's return to Television! If you enjoy the show please spread the word about it, seed the torrent and contact Richard Dean Anderson or Paramount about getting it on DVD. ENJOY AND SEED!
