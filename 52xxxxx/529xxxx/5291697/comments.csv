Couple of points XP host file is read only so i had to change that to add the blocks
Go to EDIT,PREFRENCES,GENERAL & UNCHECK AUTO UPDATE BOX
Couldn't see ""Auto UPDATE BOX"" on mine!
So blocked Adobe_Updater.exe in C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Updater6 with firewall hope that works"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-21T06:33Z,"you might get errors doing that, the host file blocks everything for you, disabling the updates is just to be sure you dont update acidently as all adobe apps share 1 updater, you can just change the prefrences in the updater to not auto check."
,digggerydooo,2010-01-21T18:16Z,"Thanks for the reply 
But when i start Flash CS4 and go to  EDIT,PREFRENCES,GENERAL
There is no options for updater visible
Despite having all host file scripts in place first thing it did was try to update 
But firewall seems to have blocked Updater.exe now;-)"

It matches... I copied and paste in fact, the part that was not correct.. as U recommended.
If I may add... during the so 7 updates, 4 and 6 failed... if I can remember, 4 said the update was successful but with errors. 6 completely failed because the update was already installed (I think) I have uninstalled it, so I could start again :) Thanks again Thingy!"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-25T04:06Z,"one of the updates is 32 or 64bit only, the other one you shoudent be getting errors, look through the adobe posts here, youll note that many of the apps share components, so what you need to do is determine with your apps what ones have the same components as this one then remove all of them with the tool then reinstall them, its best with adobe not to mix and match cracks as if one of your apps contacts the mothership then all of your pirate ones will be killed of, all of the posts here share a common patch and host and all work together."
,phdsigns,2010-01-25T04:19Z,"I think Ur right unfortunately :) I will uninstall everything and start again fresh.
This window cleaner... cleans it all, for sure?
A fresh install wouldn't pick on anything left over.. (always does)... and ruin the whole thing :S

,ErowidZero,2010-03-14T21:31Z,"Thanks for the response.  I know they sound unrelated but for a month defender and anti-virus were active and were shut off IMMEDIATELY following this installation.  There was no other activity that could have caused this.

*Also - my Win7 no longer appears to be genuine. Can you think of anything this installation could have done?"
,ErowidZero,2010-03-14T22:18Z,"I'm not gonna bug you anymore beyond this but I had one more detail to add - the antivirus program is running fine but since flash installation windows7 reports that it is off even though it isn't.

I don't claim this issue is your responsibility and I respect your time - if you have ANY ideas of how the flash installation (or supporting files such as the hosts file and toolkits) could have possibly caused this, please offer me your insight."
[V],thethingy,2010-03-15T06:42Z,"win7 action centre is not the most reliable of things, flash doesent interact with it at all, the activation blocker edits the hosts file, the patched dll file is a genuine unmodified file that is taken from a legal copy of flash, so on the basis that nothing in this torent goes near win7 action centre i would have to say the problem is unrelated, there is a website win7 (i think) that shows you how to reset action centre, its a common enough issue."
[V],thethingy,2010-03-15T06:44Z,"or in action centre turn off all monitoring, restart and turn it all back on then restart again, that will reset action centre "
,ErowidZero,2010-03-15T08:01Z,Thanks again for your time.  I should note that the flash program worked great so I'm thinking my issues are an isolated situation.  I did a system restore to before I installed flash and my win7 is back to being genuine and I'm seeing no problems.  I'll attempt flash installation in a virtual machine and see what happens.

,niceworkbuddy,2011-03-02T03:50Z,"Thing, do you know where have the serial numbers gone? I enter the numbers I saw here last month, it accepted it, but when I closed the program and reopened it, it asked for the serial number again, and it didn't always work. Please help. "
,axise,2011-06-15T11:39Z,"Ok. 2 Things Thingy:

Thanks A Lot N It Works Well.

Note: The Host File Didn't Add All The Exceptions After Running The Block. So I Manually Added All The Other IPs Just In Case.

I've Used This Install Method For A Couple Years Now. N I Had Problems With The illustrator Install. It Fucked Up My Licenses For All My Adobe Products. Im Not A Noob But IDK What The Heck Happened. I Tried The Install From Scratch 4 Times N Nothing So I Gave Up On That One. The Error I Got Wasnt Listed In The Folder. [There Has Been An Error With The Licensing Of This Product, Blah Blah.] The SN Worked Well N The Install Ran Perfectly Smooth.
Im Sure It Was Something Related To The Host.

Well To All The Complainers...If U Can't Make It Work, Pay More Attention N Try Harder. Cuz This Works 100%. There Was NO 1 Issue During The Install. Nor During The Updates.

,SumeklamKidd,2011-09-30T04:26Z,"Hi thethingy.

First, thanks for all you fine uploads, you are awesome!!!

I have followed every link you have posted, and all of them say ""Not Found (aka 404)"".

Have you deleted the former links, or is something else up?

I'm asking because I have tried everything multiple times, and the setup.exe works for a few seconds, then goes into an infinite feedback loop: nothing happens. "
,blaba12,2011-12-11T14:40Z,"hi thethingy, can you please please please upload the host file again, I had the same problem with others that i can't save as from the notepad. many thanks for the upload! "
,brodzio,2012-01-21T21:24Z,"Guys... It *does not* work well... You will do most of things here, but I can't believe such expensive software has a bug that makes it impossible to compile animations with external .AS files. It's either not cracked (not cracked at all btw) very well, or indeed Adobe sux. Either way, not worth to download if You make external .AS document class. I would try trial version but i think I'll try CS 3 instead."
,krit01,2012-07-10T10:45Z,"please help how can i do step 8 adding the last line to activate the cs 4
