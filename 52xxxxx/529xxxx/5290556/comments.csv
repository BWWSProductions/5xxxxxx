,filmaddict1983,2010-08-21T16:46Z,"elgrey is correct the audio is off on spiderman 2 on some parts its kinda hard to catch though. The other 2 movies are perfect as far as I can tell.
Thank-you"

,dcutler,2011-02-12T07:38Z,sharing is caring
,filmaddict1983,2011-06-07T14:48Z,@ penandpike Watch the scene at the bank robbery where she is hanging from her cane and realizes the ledge is right there all around that part audio is from the extended. Not a big problem unless you're picky like me the others are perfect.
