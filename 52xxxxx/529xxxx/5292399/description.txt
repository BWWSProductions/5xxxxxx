The Battle of Haditha was a battle fought between U.S. forces and Ansar al-Sunna in early August 2005 on the outskirts of the town of Haditha, Iraq, which was one of the many towns that were under insurgent control in the Euphrates River valley during 2005.

On the first day of the battle, a six-man United States Marine Corps sniper unit in Haditha was attacked and over-run by a large insurgent force. All six men were found dead after the battle.
