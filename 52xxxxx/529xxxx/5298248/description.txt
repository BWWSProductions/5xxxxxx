* Hello PC great games fans ...

* Play this nice action adventure game ...

* MULTI-5

* GAMEPLAY :

* The games make use of a new "vertical cover system", as well as a standard cover system.

The game will include a hover pack, and later, a jetpack, allowing for a quick transition between traditional shooter gameplay and 

flight. It has also been announced that everything unlocked in the first play through will be transferred over to new games.

The game also features "tactical freedom", which is different ways of achieving the same goal. For instance, in the game, the 

player must take down an Archon, a large robotic enemy manned by a Watcher. The first way to take it down is by shooting its leg 

joints, rendering the giant enemy incapacitated. Once this is done, the player must climb onto the Archon's tail, triggering a 

mini-game, and fight the Watcher that's controlling it. A different way of accomplishing all this is by hijacking an enemy UFO and 

blasting the Archon with the ship's cannons until it explodes.
