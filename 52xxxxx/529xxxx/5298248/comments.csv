[V],globeplus,2010-01-22T03:37Z,"I CHECKED THIS TIME EVERYTHING BEFORE UPLOAD , THIS TIME IS ARC COMPRESSION AND I GET LESS 90 MB IN THE TOTAL SIZE WITH THAT BECAUSE YOU NEED CLOSE 1.2 GB RAM TO DO THE ARC EXTRACTION .

THANK YOU ."
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-01-22T06:21Z,"Why did you upload this again, what's the difference? LOL?"
[V],globeplus,2010-01-22T07:29Z,"Thank you for your question (genius of the hole) but unfornatly i get unlucky in the first upload with a couple of files corrupted after i moved the file to upload computer and it was really ununexpected , then i corrected the file , changed the compression type and checked very carefully all the file before upload again , sometimes you get ununexpected situations in your uploadings , thank you for your comment ."
,dileep021,2010-01-22T08:16Z,"Previously 1 got corrupted and now i m downloading this one. again it will take 1 day to download cause of slow internet connection.
Hope this will work..
Thanks 4 the upload.."
[V],globeplus,2010-01-22T08:59Z,"thank you to all the users that like my work and sorry for the inconvenience of the first upload , i´ll have extra care in my future uploads , for the moment get this one fast as possible and enjoy the game ... Thank you for your comments ."
,haco_zdisen,2010-01-22T12:53Z,Ive been using globe torrent uploads since about 6 mounts ago and never had a big problem(always playable) but sometimes it has some deleted items or less fps than the reloaded version so i want to ask:will this be like it(now i ask only about the fps)? Anyway thx!
[V],Shroo,2010-01-22T23:57Z,"Never trust this guy, unless he starts respecting scene, if ya want a proper realease press on my name"
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-01-23T02:31Z,"Shroo is pissed off because TPTB can't compress as good as Globe.

Just knock it off man..., he is better than you all, go suck a cock"
,p2pPirate,2010-01-23T03:13Z,"its so funny, so many years have passed and it seemes that nothing has changed same n00bs, a-holes that do not understan a thing for example Mr The.Genius.of.the.Hole... wont say a thing, globe cant compress a shit, i have compared both versions of so many games.. this self proclaimed douche doesnt have a clue of what hes doing he ripps the shit out of these games and claims that the are full rip direct play, wtf? is he talking about, when he doesnt even know what is Direct play or rip, this is fucking so lame, if i would own tpb this cock sucker would be banned from here! Have fun gay fans! Mwhahahaha"
[V],globeplus,2010-01-23T03:24Z,"Thank you all for your comments and still beeing a pleasure to me give my nice contribution to the games file users , the intention is always keeping the full game more as possible getting a nice size .
Sometimes , ununexpected things can happen like corrupted files with empty data after the uploading and i really getted by surprise by the situation and my attention now is improved in this type of problem and i really have a nice idea about the problem that originate the situation .
to the lovely concorrence guys i say that no matter what they do , i can do better and they simply know that , that´s why they come to comments of my files with this bullshit that don´t takes anywhere , well just life ...
fellow users : all of you can count with my contribution when it is possible and remember :
REALLY NICE SIZES KEEPING THE FULL GAME MORE AS POSSIBLE IS GLOBE@ FILES . Thank you all for your comments ."
,p2pPirate,2010-01-23T03:43Z,"Fuck you and fuck your torrents globe, u must be a turd face if you think you better, everyone can do that same shit you do, removing stuff without explaing users that you did it, it just so hilarious, 

Congrats to Globe@ biggest idiot on the net!"
[V],globeplus,2010-01-23T05:37Z,"TO P2P PIRATE : INEVER ASKED YOU TO PUT COMMENTS IN MY FILES , I DIDN´T ADMIT YOU INSULT ME , YOU ARE JUST ANOTHER BRAINWASHED FOR THE CONCORRENCE GUYS , YOU SIMPLY STINKS . "

[V],globeplus,2010-01-23T21:23Z,"thank you for this latest comments and i thought in this game that you keep more concentrated and more focus passing the missions without the voices , the player is just playing the game without things that slowing down a little bit , the voices can be nice but certainly not obrigatory to play the game and it is just a game after all , well i simply do my work ... in few hours time i will have VENETICA ready , a RPG with nice story that i am shore not only the normal fans of RPGs games can like but also ocasional RPGs users , to the other refered game i need some more time , to take a look and see what i can possible do .
