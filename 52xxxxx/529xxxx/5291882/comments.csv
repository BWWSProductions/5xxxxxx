,tommo39,2010-01-20T10:00Z,"K.K. on installing im asked to use C.D. or d'load from web page another 60MB more, is this correct? please help"
,tommo39,2010-01-20T11:16Z,"looks like they deleted your install.exe and replaced it with ""install platform"" @ 863kb, so you have to install from their web site and NO place to install serials!!"
,bcda12,2010-01-20T21:53Z,"ok, so i managed to install it....however the instructions tell me to register with the serial key but NOT register to Mcafee, i don;t understand this, there's only one way i can activate this and thats through the security center where i type my serial and then a mcafee  username and password :S

anyone help? thanks"
,tommo39,2010-01-22T12:20Z,I LOOKED FOR KK TO MAKE COMMENT TO THESE POSTS BUT OBVIOUS HE HAS NO ANSWERS WITH HIS SILENCE! NOT LIKE HIM
,gamezone360,2010-01-22T18:09Z,Please read this article before installing Mcafee 2010: http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/200938/4469/Is-McAfee-selling-2009-products-in-a-2010-box
[V],kentucky-kid,2010-01-23T10:03Z,"@tommo39
just run the setup file."
,ocyrus70,2010-01-23T13:38Z,"Why don't you just download Heartbugs mcafee's internet security 09, when you run the setup for the 1st time it will go to install and stop but will ask you to let it look online for the latest software updates and will download mcafee 2010 and install mcafee 2010 NOT 09 register.. 12months of mcafee 2010 no crack or keys  legitimate in your name EASY!!.. "
,ocyrus70,2010-01-23T13:50Z,"gamezone360, maybe it is 09 but it will download the new mcafee 2010 interface when the software wizzard looks for updates for the 1st time so it won't be a 2009 internet security as it won't install 09 it will ask you to let it look for updates and will download 2010 and install that!!.."
,Xtr3IVI3sNiiP3r,2010-01-24T14:25Z,Thanx M8 it Works I Just Love McAfee
,Ptilonyssus,2010-01-26T21:28Z,"This isn't my first time installing a pirated program. When I completed the install of this program I was unable to use the serial number provided, that the number was already associated with an account. You can't run McAfee without using a serial. "
,bcda12,2010-02-01T15:39Z,"there is a serious lack of help on this torrent

i can't register the serial key because the key is already registered on someone elses account, how the hell do i get it to accept by key now?"
[V],kentucky-kid,2010-02-01T16:23Z,"@bcda12
hmm, thats weird, cause some manage to get it work, while some don't. i'll try get a fresh copy later on. just keep up to date with my torrents aite. my bad. :("
,MakeFun,2010-02-02T06:03Z,"It works...great...!!!

I don't how to register using serial that you have given...!!

So could you plzz help me..??"
,romaniac85,2010-02-02T18:47Z,"People People!!! The program and registration all works.

As per usual, disconnect from the internet.
Then run the setup file. After everything is done, go down to the bottom of ""THE ADVANCED LOOK"" part of the program and you'll see it is valid til next year Feb. DO NOT REGISTER!!

Then, reconnect to the net and update as usual.

Problem now I'm facing is every time I start the computer it ALWAYS attempts to register...

Hey K-Kid, know how I can get around that?

ps. Nice work too.

pps. Not the best program have ya noticed? Even Norton is better, lol."
,femi_k85,2010-02-03T03:38Z,I need serial key
,nated0323,2010-02-03T04:02Z,"My first question is will this work on windows 7? Second question, does anyone have a working serial key for this or is it pointless to download this?"
,romaniac85,2010-02-03T05:42Z,"@nated0323.
Yes it work on win7 and u dont even need the key... as soon as u install it using the setup.exe, it'l have the subscription already there til next year.

Just disconnect from the net and dont register."
,nated0323,2010-02-03T14:15Z,It needs to be connected to the net to install.. 
,ircaddicts,2010-02-03T23:56Z,YOU HAVE TO REGISTER THIS FOR IT WORK. IT POINTLESS TO D/L SINCE YOU CAN'T
,nated0323,2010-02-04T01:42Z,No good without a serial.. I went with a different program
,Appetite4Disaster-,2010-02-04T02:00Z,"i just installed this program...04.02.10.. AND the key is useless...and have to activate it before 19.02.10.. so shit works for 14 days or so.. DOES ANYBODY HAVE A KEY OR CRACK FOR IT???


Or tell me what to do..


cheers"
,famemon78,2010-02-06T12:25Z,I don't know what people are on about! It installed and is working perfectly for me. Sure u have to disconnect the internet each time the activation box pops up but if u cant be bothered with that much to get a software like this for free i dont think u deserve it :-) .. thanks a bunch kentucky kid u thoroughly deserve ur green skull!!!

thnx"
,Allan Ong,2010-02-10T04:32Z,Guys this program will install but you cannot activate cos it says the serial key belongs to someone else. If you dont activate you only get 15days. So dont bother!
,nandos421,2010-02-10T09:36Z,hi it work the dl and i put the key in and then it comes to a screen saying login so i figured u dont want me to do this but then it will only last a week how do i get around this?
,joelsantos27,2010-02-10T13:34Z,"Torrent works fine, that much is indeed true. For about two weeks it's fully enabled - despite always reminding you to activate - but afterwards it get's inactive.

First things first, many thanks to Kentucky-Kid for his contribution and his torrents. And second, I am utterly sorry Kentucky-Kid but how could someone upload a torrent (which needs activation/serial key + login details) and believe it would remain active without providing that information?
Plus it's been almost a month since the upload and nothing new? No updates on this? No help?"
,joelsantos27,2010-02-10T17:21Z,"My advice to everyone is precisely what I have done now, install the 2009 version, and choose to install/download from the internet (instead of the CD). You will therefore download the latest version, and completely up to date, you won't need any serials/keygens, just register with some e-mail acount, choose a password and you'll get a whole year subscription service."
,Moedreek-05,2010-02-12T17:57Z,Thanks kentucky-kid 
,ocyrus70,2010-02-18T15:58Z,joelsantos27 what have i been saying on page 1 guys read please!!..
,KT_93,2010-02-27T01:18Z,Where is the serial key kentucky-kid?
,sml1ace,2010-03-02T05:38Z,"Hello All ( Good DL ) works great, just download, unpack files to desired location, click install, follow instructions, install from CD and will work with no serial. Will tell you unable to activate and will remind later. Just do a manual update after installed and will work just fine. Free 1 yr subscription!!!"
,vatsa1708,2010-03-04T02:51Z,If this doesn't work for you guys try the enterprise edition.. v8.7i works with Windows 7..
