How do we know the rip was fine without any errors ?"

I used dbPowerAMP CD Ripper.  Rips lossless and perfectly like EAC, but I will be using EAC for future uploads because dlers like to have rip logs and cue sheets.

This rip was not perfect, because this CD was not perfect.  9 songs ripped perfectly.  All other uploads by me are error free, and future ones will be error free or not uploaded.

Remember, it is free, so if you do not like it then do not download it."
