The Cambridge Learner's Dictionary (CLD) on CD-ROM is an interactive electronic dictionary for intermediate learners of English.  Its entries contain sound recordings by both British and American native speakers, as well as a feature that lets you record and hear your own pronunciation.  CLD also has a 'Related Words' feature that works like a thesaurus, and a 'Word Families' feature that provides an easy way to build your vocabulary.  In addition, CLD has lots of study pages, which explore different areas of English language and culture, and interactive exercises based on the study pages, which help you practise what you have learned.  

The Cambridge Learner's Dictionary on CD-ROM is combined with an application called BOOKcase.  BOOKcase is a software program that helps you use CLD and is automatically installed on your computer when you install CLD.  For more information about BOOKcase and how it works, see the section called About BOOKcase 4.0.  NOTE: You do not have to read this section to use CLD.
