,compno,2010-01-21T09:22Z,"Yes, a smaller file would be great! I concur. "
,drcat125,2010-01-21T11:27Z,"DON""T Download it 

the digital feed is messed up all the way through it. Plus the picture and mouth are way off . It is like watching o brien on acid"
[V],err0001,2010-01-21T14:29Z,"would O'Brien on acid be similar to normal Craig Ferguson but less creepy?

On a slightly more topical note, I recorded this episode on my PVR and will try to upload a 350MB avi later today."
,Psylocke83,2010-01-21T14:46Z,"I agree with drcat125 - don't waste your time downloading it! Very messed up.

Hopefully someone uploads a proper AVI version soon because I need my Coco!!!!!!"
[V],err0001,2010-01-21T18:04Z,"I just uploaded a 350MB avi of this episode here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5297061

The sound is in sync with the video. The quality of the audio and video is not up to scene standards, but should be quite watchable.

Enjoy!"
