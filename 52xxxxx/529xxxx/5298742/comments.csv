,sauron111,2010-02-05T19:36Z,"i have downloaded the torrent the extracted it with 7-zip.

,link91210,2010-03-01T16:10Z,"Took 5 days to download, and now there is no real ISO image, unless I am doing something wrong. Which I'm pretty sure I'm not . Anyone get this too work? I'm pretty sure its just corrupt "
,Bozznii,2010-04-22T09:52Z,How do I install this without ISO files?
,AvocadoCake,2010-12-09T00:50Z,"I have 2 folders: DAD 1 and DVD 2, full of  ""rzr-me2b.001"" type files. No executable, no instructions, thankfully no virus but i would like ot have not just wasted 14.3GB of my internet credit and time... any help?"
,mattheusvelosod,2010-12-09T03:43Z,"Here, i downloaded it and gt the same error with the .001, .002... files, so I joined them with hjsplit. But that didn't work, so I had to rename all the files from rzr-me2a(or 2b) to rzrme2a.r00, r01,r02. A great way to do this is to change the first zero to an ""r"". when you finish just extract the first file with winrar. That worked for me.
By the way, if you change the name of the files, you won't be able to upload it anymore, so if you want to keep uploading, just make a copy of it in another paste and rename this new copy.
I hope that helped. Sorry for the english mistakes."
,jimbowjr,2011-03-02T01:19Z,"This torrent sucks! You can extract the files .001, .002, .003, and so it goes, with 7-Zip. But inside there are two other files: rzr-me2a and rzr-me2b. I've tried Alcohol 120%, Winrar, 7-Zip, Poweriso, Demon Tools... and none works. Do yourself a favor and search other torrent. Don't waste your time with this one."
,smrm64,2011-03-14T19:15Z,"Hey guys, this torrent does have some rather strange files but dont worry. I have finished downloading them and I am gonna try to compress them into a .iso file. What ever the outcome may be, just trust me I will figure this out and post a tutorial."
,jeffrkim,2011-03-16T06:57Z,"ok everyone -  those who have problem thinking "".001"" file is not gonna work - do some research! I just googled and got the solution in a sec. and guess what? it works perfectly. this torrent is legit. heres a link to find out how to open .001 file:

,zanakanishi,2011-03-23T14:21Z,"Sorry guys, I tried everything to get this to work, no luck.. The only thing to do really is go to:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5299647/Mass_Effect_2_%5BPC___Multi6%5D_%28Razor1911%29

The comments on that all say it's fine and works, without all this annoying 001 stuff, it just gives the .iso straight up.. I just need to wait another 3 days to actually get it -_- this torrent was an amazing waste of my time and electricity bill.

Even if there is a way to make this work, as a good host you should either give proper instructions on how to install it, or sit back and leave it to the people who know what they are doing."
,zanakanishi,2011-03-23T14:25Z,"@ jeffrkim
No, it does not work properly, I did that and it made different files after using 7zip.. but then it would not work when I used my daemon tools to try and get it to install.

It's not uncommon to have to use 7zip or winrar to get .iso files out of, but when they are meant to actually work after getting them."
,dyjhh,2011-05-11T13:28Z,stuck at 22% please SEDD

,dyjhh,2011-05-13T20:31Z,this fucking thing dosent work its a waste of time i have been downloading this 4 days for nothing
,ytg123,2011-08-27T11:12Z,"To all n00bs who don't even know how to open split archives, you use 7-zip to open the .001 and then extract the iso."
,Morinala,2011-09-19T15:05Z,Do not download this torrent. It is mislabeled and is in fact an Xbox game.
,tsukasa14,2011-09-20T23:32Z,"Hey i just made an account now so i can say that this is an epic fail.
thanks for shit and wasting my time.
and yes- i do know how to unpack split files, but the file i extract isnt even in ISO format. 
fail "
,albertingomes,2011-09-26T18:56Z,"For those with 001 problems do like mattheusvelosod, change the first 0 from rzr-me2a(or 2b).001 to rzrme2a.r01, r02,r03, it will recognize as a Rar file, don't worry if when u get to r30 appear that didn't recognize because it did, after that unzip the first one that all other files will be packed into a ISO file, after that mount and good game."
