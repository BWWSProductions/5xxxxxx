,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:09Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.
[V],dohduhdah,2010-02-04T04:40Z,can you scan such a DCMA letter (where you can use ms paint to black out sensitive info) and put it online on imageshack.us ?
[V],dohduhdah,2010-02-04T04:42Z,uh.. DMCA letter (not DCMA)

[V],dohduhdah,2011-06-07T04:40Z,"Never got a dmca letter, but I'm in the Netherlands.
I did get some copyright infringement complaints via my ISP way back when I was fetching my first TTC courses from demonoid, but that doesn't seem to happen anymore."
