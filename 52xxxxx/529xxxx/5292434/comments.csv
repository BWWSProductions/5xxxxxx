,TwisterB.,2010-02-01T20:53Z,"thanks man works 100%
the only problem im having is that sometimes when i run the game it just appear a white screen and the game is running cause i can hear  the audio and stuff but cant see"
,endrief1,2010-02-07T16:40Z,hey I have the same problem as TwisterB. except that i have it all the time. the program opens but the screen always appears white. Sound comes normal and resolution goes on full screen with letterboxing on the side. Any ideas plz
,MrEddy,2010-02-07T18:35Z,You muse use Split/Concat to reform it to a single zip file. Then use stuffit expander to extract the zip file. Thats how you extract this one. 
,Dubba-C,2010-02-08T04:02Z,Same problem as endrief1. White gameplay area with letterboxing on the sides. Maybe this matters: I use dual displays on a Mac Pro. Also I'm running Snow Leopard. Any ideas out there? Muchos Gracias for the Cider ports to you who do them. They are awesome!
,Dubba-C,2010-02-08T06:25Z,Update: I got the white screen to go away after turning off my firewall. Apparently NFS must connect somewhere to set up it's video the first time. Cool. BUT: In 1920 x 1080 mode the graphics are narrowed somehow. THe cars look really skinny and feel un-natural. I tried messing with the Resolution settings but the screen goes white and I have to trash the preferences to get it back. Can anyone tell us how to fix the horizontal display issue? Muchas gracias!
,ssaadd123,2010-02-08T21:16Z,"can I play the game in high graphic??

okay I downloaded all 48 files, deleted the 'download from demonoid' thing, tried to make all of the archived files into one with Spilt/Concat but it doesn't work on Snow Leopard. So I used HJSplit instead, that worked. Tried unzipping with Archive Utility, error message saying ""Unable to archive ""NFSUndercoverMac.zip"" into ""Need for Speed Undercover"".
(Error 1 - Operation not permitted.)
So I tried using The Unarchiver, that worked until it reached the end of the unzip were it said ""Could not extract the file ""NFS Undercover.dmg"" the archive file is corruped"" I tried to open the dmg but another error message came up saying ""The following disc image could not be opened - Reason not recognised""
This is seriously annoying, if anyone could help it would be ever so grateful : )"

it works fine i took me ages but i did what every1 said and used Split/Concat to reform it to a single zip file. Then i used stuffit expander to extract the zip file but then i had the problem where when i launched it, it didnt open but just before i gave up i moved the nfs undercover app to the same file as the zips and it worked! so yer hope this helps. game worked fine.
THANKS THE NOOBISH!"
,dxbhacker,2010-06-13T20:14Z,"thank thenoobish...its working perfectly..
To make it work you must unzip the files...after unzipping you will one single .dmg file run that file, after running it you will see a drive mount of your desktop ""NFS Undercover"" open the file once you open it.again you will wind another same filename but with different icon...simply drag that file into your APPLICAION folder... and then run the file from you Application folder...
Thanks"

you have to concat the files with split and concat and extract the zip with stuffit expander and skip verifying the dmg, too slow and the dmg is ok.

,ratasticincredidilious,2011-10-24T09:25Z,"You guys have all been blindfolded. Here are the failsafe methods to do it:
1. Download and open the Undercover rar 001 (NOTHING ELSE!!!!!) with stuffit expander.
2. Wait for it to go automatically through all the zip files(yes I mean wait cuz this may take a while)
3. When ALL rars have been extracted, the dmg will be somwhere around 7 gigs, open it and copy application to wherever u like.
4.(This is where Crossover Games comes in) When it's copied, open the game, because this is a port used by wine, Crossover Games will want to open it. If you get an error window popping up ignore it and hit enter. This will happen the first time you open the game.
5. It will work from there on, no error windows, nothing.

So basically, it does work, you just need Crossover Games to run it.
