,Kossy077,2011-03-20T03:25Z,"To all you concerned 64bit users, this will! work on your PC - you just select the C: ""program files"" folder as your install location, instead of the default ""program files (x86)"" dir - this is where all 32bit applications go on a PC ruining a 64bit OS. 

Just one more thing, which may be confusing some people: you don't just copy the crack straight into the ""Mass Effect 2"" folder - you have to click into it and then copy the crack into the ""binaries"" folder. Do that and you'll get the familiar ""copy and replace"" option. Hopefully, you're all good after that."

,Kossy077,2011-03-21T14:50Z,"OK, I need to add one more thing: When I said that you had! to install into the ""program files"" folder if you where running a 64bit OS, I should have made it clear that's what I did only because that game wouldn't install into the default ""program files (x86)"" folder. I can't be sure that it was down to my OS being 64 bit. So If the normal install goes OK for you, then don't bother messing with it."

-14.29gb zipped file that isn't even compressed?
-Instructions say to extract the files, which means you have 28.6gb of files for this shit?
-Extracted files don't even contain iso's, dvd1 and dvd2 files don't exist.

Maybe you're just supposed to mount the files you download and go from there, but once again, all the instructions say to extract the files, and you need the crack from the extracted files. Anyhow, this is a piece of shit, I have no idea why I tried this over the working 4gb torrent just for slightly improved cutscene quality."

,shipz2640,2011-06-11T21:21Z,"@k0ticgood Are you really that dumb?

Firstly, this torrent contains no zip files. Only the image files for both DVDs. Original Razor1911 releases are zipped in a split archive of a bunch of small packs around 15mb each to make it easier to upload to certain non-torrent download sites. Obviously this has been extracted and re-uploaded with the original Razor1911 instructions.

You just mount the image files and copy the crack. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to look at the contents of the torrent and see 2 image files and realize all you need to do is mount or burn, grab a key, install, and copy the cracked files. This is only the same routine that has been used for over a decade now.

Sometimes the intelligence of people on the internet really amaze me."

Dude, i'm having the EXACT same problem, weird thing is, i have had this game installed for over a year, played it many, many, many times with ZERO problems. I'm almost finished yet another play through, right at the last part when you have to take the shuttle to the next mission and just as you said, it gets stuck at the loading screen. I hear the ship sounds, the audio is still working, but nothing is loading... it's just stuck.

I've tried EVERYTHING. Restarting the entire mission, installing a fresh coalesced.ini file, removing all mods... everything. Nothing seems to fix it. I'm wondering if it has anything to do with the nVidia update i just installed... that's the only thing i can think of that's changed on my computer since i've played it last. Any change you have nVidia as well with the latest beta drivers? I guess i'll google a bit more then revert my drivers and try again. I'll post results if it's successful."

I went to the planet where it's supposed to be.

I scan for the anomaly .

The land button is there.

I clicked it and It to a loading screen..

.....and this is where the problem is.

usually when your about to land anywhere you choose which character you will go with, however on my screen it doesn't show anyone else but Jacob. 

It just shows the others as datapads, and there is no add button to select which members you wish to go with. and whats more is it only shows Jacob as add with the crew already (all highlighted, and won't unhighlight)

At this point because there is no add button I can't begin the mission....

,lubu8055,2011-12-21T16:00Z,"oh and i'd like to add a random comment

1. seeding is easy, once the torrent has finished downloading just simply leave the torrent in your downloader (mines utorrent) so then people can download from you, simple :) you can monitor how much you have seeded by looking at the ""uploaded"" amount! try to do atleast a 1:1 ratio.

2. anyone having crashes/starting issues simply try going back to the root of the cause, find out why it happens, when it happens, if you see a pattern to it, try and fix it but if you dont know how simply reinstall the game! its irritating i know but 90% of the time will solve most issues like this! if that fails then a re-download may be needed!

and lastly i would like to say i can admit to not seeding EVERYTHING i download but for things that are 1GB and over i generally seed for a about 8 days :) thanks for the torrent! you're almost a god "

I had the same problem and searching for it got me a solution that works perfectly. This was posted in the bioware forums by user ""bnomad""


""If your PC is running a Intel HD 3000 graphics driver, when you try to open the menu it will result in a crash and will bring you back to windows. there is however a solution that dose not require you to go out and by a new PC the solution is to use the older .2361 drivers.
you can download this from
http://www.wikidrivers.com/wiki/Intel_GMA_15.22.1.2361
once you install that the game will function beautifully. you can hit escape all day long and you won't crash to desktop""


Try it. It might work for you too.

Cheers."

First off, Your downloading at your own risk! keep that in mind. 

Second, 10 times out of 10 razor has some good quality uploads and would NEVER put a virus in just to fuck with you. 

Third, Keygens will ALMOST always be detected by antimalware and antivirus software due to the fact that they need to be able to use md5 or whatever encryption/decryption techniques used for serial numbers of that partiqular program. 

READ the god damn description in ALL torrents before downloading. if you get a virus, its because your a fucking dumbass that doesnt need to be illegally downloading shit and need to go fuck off so you can let the rest of the community d/u in fucking peace. 

thats all. have a great day and thanks razor for your commitment to the community. "
