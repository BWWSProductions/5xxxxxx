This is how I activated my Windows 7 x64 mail (aka: Outlook Express) @ C:/Program Files/Windows Mail.

I searched all day yesterday on google for the msoe.dll but I have found only one that did not work. I got this msoe.dll from my friend who has Vista x64.

Here it is plus a how to!

I will try to find a msoe.dll for Windows 7 x86 and maybe post it later when I find one.

Also... I am not in anyway connected with http://www.sevenforums.com

I just searched through google yesterday and found the link. You can try a search if you want.

Happy Mailing!
