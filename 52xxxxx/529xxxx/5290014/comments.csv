[T],renman,2010-01-20T02:51Z,"Oh and another thing, I wouldn't have pink skull status if I was uploading fake files. Try reading comments on all my other torrents before posting judgmental crap"

,DragonsLover,2010-02-16T04:03Z,"""Fake as usual?"" One must wonder where you get your torrents if the majority of them are fake. 

And why you keep going back. 

Thanks for the upload, renman. :D"
[T],renman,2010-02-16T22:35Z,"I'd like to thank all of you who left  kind comments. The negative comments are normally due to peoples lack of patience and understandably frustration at the increasing number of totally fake torrents uploaded. Other than the movie companies attempting to catch people out, I seriously don't understand the mindset of those who upload fake files, same goes for virus infected files it's just pathetic, puerile and unnecessary.
