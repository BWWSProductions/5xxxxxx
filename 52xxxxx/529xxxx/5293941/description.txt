Meredith`s music is hard to explain so I won`t.Experimental choral music you could call it?This album is part of a soundtrack of a film about a 14th century jewish girl who has visions of the 20th century.She tries to find someone to interpret what they mean but no one understands except a madwoman.To make a long story short,she draws the images on a cave wall;a plague breaks out in her village and everyone dies.At the end of the film,it`s the 20th century and her cave drawings are found.
The instrumentation is beautiful:hurdy gurdy,dulcimer,keyboards,cello plus Meredith`s vocal ensemble all make this a somber but interesting listen.
