Notes by Enchantgy on reseed:

The date is actually July 28th. NOT July 31st as it states on the artwork. This is likely the best Randy Rhoads recording we will ever see. Randy was getting better and better. The further along he was getting in his classical guitar development, the more advanced his playing was getting.
Unfortunately we never got to see how far he could take it. Because of the very unfortunate (and stupid) plane-crash on that horrible day on March 19th. Almost 25 years ago now.
