Product Description
This pathbreaking ethnography of the Indian cinema is concerned particularly with cinema goers in Madurai, South India. The book's core is an analysis of the films themselves and their place in the lives of poor people, who organise fan clubs, and relate these fantasy worlds to their own lives. In addition, it reviews the history of Tamil film, and the structure of the film industry, and presents the perspective of the film makers theselves. It is both an original contribution to the study of film in India and more generally to the understanding of Indian popular culture.
