Anyway thx."

,chitchatid,2010-12-10T08:49Z,"wow. awesome dude. 250 gigabytes ... 
incredible! 
personally i had to download in within say 6 months? shall you still seed?
to download highlander, 6 seasons, about 40 gigabytes, i had to spend 4 months of non-stop dl.
can you provide the voltus v / voltes v?
i guess voltus v is the original idea of transformers. it is the 1970s show."
