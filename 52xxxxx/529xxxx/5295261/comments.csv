However Randolph Winters coverage is supposedly not all that accurate.  I highly recommend  text, which is freely available online - which gives some very basic fundamentals, we can all benefit from.  The only faker is that critic who is represented on the documentary \""The Worlds Greatest Hoaxes\"" which lists Billy Meier - now, if only had they checked that critic out, he would be seen to be a man who lacks honesty in himself.  I generally agree with the Meier material - that I was already thinking that way beforehand - he only takes you further than what you yourself can surmise. eg. World religions mislead us all, with false belief systems, governments have been lying (and withholding evidence) about UFOs and ETs.  NASA too."
