Gotham City's tranquil suburbs are shattered by a string of murders that stumps the county sheriff. Batman steps in and realizes immediately that the murders are more than they seem. Solving them and nabbing the perp only begin clearing up the mystery. Sucked into ritualistic dark magic and pursued by zombies, Batman faces a puzzle that, defying logic, requires him to suspend disbelief.

Written by Steve Niles and illustrated by Scott Hampton.
