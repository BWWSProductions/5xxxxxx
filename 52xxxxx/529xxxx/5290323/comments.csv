,tfizz,2010-01-19T07:44Z,"fuck you Wills, you stupid fucking kunt.  Oh.. and NO. you don't need to wait 1 or 2 days to seed.. you fucking moron.  I can seen as I am downloading.  I was ONE of the first peeps to start downloading and seeding this torrent.

I was maxing out my upload bandwidth when this fucking torrent had 200 leechers.. which was for about 2 seconds after the first few minutes it was up.  Fuck off..

bunch of stingy bastards.

My ratio is 1:4 . your welcome fat lazy fuckers"

,FlamingFuzzbal,2010-01-19T07:59Z,"Thanks eztv. Great as usual!

@ tfizz

If you don't like it, don't do it. So just calm down and deal with the fact that this is popular so there is always gonna be a huge leecher to seeder ratio. And yes there are some people out there who will just download this without so much as a thank you or even think about seeding it.

If you don't like the way torrents work, don't use them"

,yoriver,2010-01-20T00:17Z,As always.. thnaks!!!!
,TheTrekhippy,2010-01-20T00:53Z,"OMG This is free.  How can people complain about something free.  There are no guarantees here about speed, quality, or anything else for that matter.  If you want to be assured of a low leech/seed ratio, go to a private tracker site.  There are hardly enough leechers on those to keep my seeding ratio up."
,DickDickstein,2010-01-24T06:45Z,"Bet most of these stupid fucks that complain about speeds don't even have their connections set up right...LOL

LMAO @ 20 kb/s...I've never had that shit happen with a torrent this popular. There are enough people seeding while they leech alone just to keep the speed up.

oh and if you didn't catch on tfizz. Go fuck yourself. "
