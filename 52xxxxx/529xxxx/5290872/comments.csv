,jameslast905,2010-01-21T16:32Z,i need english subs 2 plz
,jameslast905,2010-01-22T17:55Z,"one on demonoid now with subs
a prophet    :-)"
,hapstan,2010-01-22T19:59Z,"any srt for this?
I had a look at the one on demonoid but they seem to be hardcoded into a much smaller avi file, would like to keep the supposed better quality of this file."
,derrique,2010-01-23T01:41Z,"i can't find english subtitles,
other than this version which i guess is the same as the one mentioned above..
it has hard wired eng subs and is very watchable quality.. (-:"
,imrealgod,2010-02-02T16:33Z,Too bad there aren't any subs. Wanna watch it as it just made its way to Oscar nominees.
,firebird11,2010-02-02T18:38Z,"i don't understand why it's always a dvdrip !
why not place the dvd online"
,irvine.d,2010-02-02T21:56Z,Merci. Prossimamente sub italiani
,cdef,2010-02-03T13:27Z,A great film. The first half an hour is a fantastic quasi-ethnographic description of the shock of the prison.

,Arkanoid808,2010-02-13T18:06Z,"^^^^^^
I think those have to be the worst subtitles I've ever seen...shame cos the film looks good but I couldn't watch it with those awful subtitles."
,egeel4,2010-02-25T18:19Z,"thanks for the movie, if the quality is great i will seed two times ;)"
,Jack_Raiden,2010-02-28T06:50Z,"Subtitles (English): http://subscene.com/english/A-Prophet-Un-prophte/subtitle-306322.aspx

Enjoy. I synced and cleaned up FHD's MUCH higher quality subs to this HORiZON-ArtSub release. Leave a comment at the SubScene upload if there are problems."
