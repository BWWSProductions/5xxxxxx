,john5246,2010-01-22T09:30Z,"god this game is so fucking boring so far

good thing I only downloaded the first disc, i'm gonna give it some more time but god this game fucking sucks"
,_sinner_,2010-01-23T05:10Z,"Hey, John5246! Did anyone here ask for your review of the damn game? No! STFU and seed it so we can see how ""fucking boring"" it is for ourselves. People who get things for free shouldn't bitch so much. Quit eating up our bandwidth and go jack off to some midget porn. Thanks for the upload AiTB!"
,webafella,2010-02-03T22:49Z,"This game is not stealth patched. ABx states ""Stealth status is uncertain"" (with the Yellow lines) Game may be corrupted and data cannot be verified.
Does anyone get the same error and know what to do?
I can't play this game on xbox live. I will get banned immediately."
,webafella,2010-02-03T23:18Z,Game verified. I apologize for my mistake.
,purbi,2010-02-22T05:55Z,"hi webafella,

am also getting the same error. when I load the game, it asks to install an update; but always comes back with a msg saying update failed, can anyone help..."
,livid5,2010-02-23T14:58Z,"abgx360 says with yellow text that:
video partition does not match known data (could be corrupt or a new wave not seen before)

Stealth status is uncertain.

so i don't recommend to play this game."
