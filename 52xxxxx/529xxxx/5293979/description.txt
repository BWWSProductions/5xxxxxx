These are stream rips of shoutcast webradio HARDRAVE.jp


I was quite sad for seeing one of my favorite Shoutcasts beeing stopped, after so long time of lovely hard rave music broadcasting.
So whe I saw that the streams will be switched off turning 2010, I ripped the two streams of Dj Sharpnel. 
According to the website, there must be 170 tracks for Otakuspeed Radio and 129 tracks for Otakuspeed Radio Clasixxx. 
Well, I probably couldn't catch 'em all.

HARDRAVE.JP RADIO(JAPANESE UNDERGROUND HARDRAVE) -> "Otakuspeed Radio" : 27 files
HARDRAVE.JP RADIO(OLDSCHOOL JAPANESE UNDERGROUND HARDRAVE) -> "Otakuspeed Radio Clasixxx": 18 files


As you will see, many files are 10, 15, 30 minutes long. Maybe all Sharpnel's tracks are around 5 minutes long and I've of course got 'em all. Reason: the streams didn't got their id3 tags updated correctly (maybe some tracks didn't got any), so my ripping software kept recording multiple tracks in a single file. Don't worry: I used 2 recording threads a few days long to make sure I got as much as possible before the shutdown.

Files got transcoded in MP3, 96 kb/s CBR.

ENJOY !
