For those who miss the Original Star Wars Galaxies, I am here to save you.

November 11th, 2005 will live in infamy in the MMORPG world as the most callus way to destroy a game, while ignoring the player-base. On that day, the New Game Enhancement (NGE) was released. The NGE was the final insult inflicted on the player community. Many would argue that SOE/LA was trying to draw players from other MMORPG's in order to increase their profits but regardless, it was an utter failure. 

The game IS up and IS running and currently has a 900-1000 player cap and is full all the time as of January 2010â€¦..although a â€˜test environmentâ€™ you wonâ€™t care.

Instead of messing with the slow Nova Test Server updater, I have zipped up all those pesky .tre files AND included the EMU launcher.

YOU MUST OWN THE GAME AND PHYSICALLY HAVE ALL 3 DISKS!!!!

This is NOT an illegal distribution of the game, just the .tre files and all relevant patches to play pre CU !
