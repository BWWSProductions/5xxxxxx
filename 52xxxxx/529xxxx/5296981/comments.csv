,Vigator,2010-01-25T20:59Z,"V=9 1/2
A=8

For audio there numerous times when the sound goes from normal to low and then normal. Thought it was my home theater but after letting a friend view the movie she noticed the same thing through out the movie.

There is a warning about 10mins into the movie that takes up 1/4 of the screen. This happens  again about half way into the movie and near the end. Each times it lasts for about 3 minutes. Which is annoying at best. Video quality for the most part is very good.

For collectors I'd wait for a better version. For those curious about the movie and don't care for the warning interruptions and strange volume inconstancy, then download."

,jabunk20,2010-01-27T14:14Z,one more doubt can i put this inside a dvd and watch it on tv hope for help fanks again Sailo=fucker
,smartbh,2010-01-27T20:07Z,"good effort but the font of the subtitles is not consistent and it is not in sync with the audio

I'm looking for a better version of this movie .. I hope that it will be a ORIGINAL DVDR or a DVDR converted from a BLUERAY with arabic subtitles"
[V],maestral,2010-01-28T18:40Z,"Great movie. It has no errors for me, subs are ok, audio is regular, video is better than some original dvd rips of other movies around.

Video 9/10
Audio 10/10
Subs in CRO perfect

Thats my oppinion

Thanx"
