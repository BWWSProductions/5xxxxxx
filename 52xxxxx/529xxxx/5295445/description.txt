Have you ever tried to quit smoking without manage to do so?

I have smoked for 28 years, and have been allergic to smoke in 10 of them, without managing to quit.

However, did I manage eventually, after listening to this audiobook (of 6Â½ hours) three times in a row while I was still smoking. Then, suddenly I didn't fancy anymore nicotine and quit with no withdrawal pangs what so ever! Now I only feel pity on people who continue to smokeâ€¦

I may seem somwehat slow, who had to listen through this audio book three times in a row before it worked for me? There is something termed the power of repetition: As advertizing unfortunately often do, it worked splendidly for me!

With such a fun and insightful book to listen to, here is no effort what so ever to repeat as long as it takes.
