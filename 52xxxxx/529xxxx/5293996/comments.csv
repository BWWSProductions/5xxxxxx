[T],FatFreddy69,2010-01-20T20:12Z,"to those with ultra slow internet;
don't bother seeding back the 1.0 ratio,
I'll raise you up to 30% very fast, if you finally seed back 0.5 ratio is fine, I never will let die any of my torrents, I often go back to my old torrents to help seeding if I see only one seeder or none. 

Not worth going for a 700 MB avi (generally speaking) just because of your slow internet speed. You deserve better."
