The Bourne Identity (1988)

Mystery | Thriller | Adventure | Action | Drama | Richard Chamberlain

A man is washed ashore the beach of a small French village during a heavy storm.

A retired doctor takes care of the unconscious stranger. 

When the mysterious man recovers, he cannot remember anything - 

He does not know his name, he does not know where flashback memories

 of violence come from, and he sure does not know why the access code

 of an anonymous Swiss bank account is implanted in his thigh.

 As he searches for his identity, things soon become dangerous.

 There are attempts to kill him, he is well known in first class

 hotels all around Europe, and, worst of all, there are strange 

similarities between his memories and reported actions of a high class

 terrorist, Carlos.
