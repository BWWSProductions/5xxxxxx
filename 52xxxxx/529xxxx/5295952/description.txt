Tom Myers is a Rolfer, or Structural Integrator, and has developed a concept of myofascial lines which he uses to facilitate structural bodywork to align the body (as opposed to simple massage).  Rolfing strives to improve a person's functioning longer term, and is fundmenatally different from what is taught in massage therapy schools around the world.  

While Myers has broken away from the Rolf Institute and tried to form his own school, the other more established Structural Integration schools still remain the largest and most widely used for Rolfing-type training.  Myers' concepts have largely been incorporated into the teaching of the work by others and at this time he does not remain the only source for his concepts.


This software is not really about Structural Integration.  It is about human 
anatomy from the Anatomy Trains perspective.  It is a useful tool in visualizing
in 3D human anatomy and has practical application in learning anatomy for 
massage therapists, Rolfing students, and for those in general who want a more
thorough understanding of the body.


I have other bodywork torrents which teach the fundamentals of the Myers' Anatomy Trains concepts and this is meant only to supplement those earlier torrents.  Alone this has little value except for learning some basic anatomy.


This software was originally uploaded elsewhere and as I don't know who originally
made the patch and did the work, I cannot give proper credit to the original 
creator of the patch and torrent.


This program and all of my bodywork & somatic psychology torrents are made 
available for those who do not have the resources to purchase the products from
the regular sources.



The software needs QuickTime or QuickTime Alternative to run. The patch is included in the iso and is also included as a separate file. Works for PC (real computers) and is supposed to work for Mac.
