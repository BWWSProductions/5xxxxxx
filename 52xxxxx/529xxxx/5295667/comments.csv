I never heard of SetupS, it isn't included in the download and besides some vague references and a dead download link, I can't seem to find anything online either. Also, I fail to see the point of making it this complicated. What's wrong with just mounting an iso? You know, I have the bad luck of living in a country where the goddamned internetproviders maintain monthly bandwith restrictions for their users, so it hurts all the more to see 1,6 G's go to waste. Not pleased with this upload."

,kaimles,2010-02-14T08:19Z,"Ok, so I downloaded an app from TPB called ""SetupS.SendTo.Extension_v7_ssApp"" and then, as said in the insctructions, did the 'send to' thing. Apparently that starts installing the game as a backgroud process, invisible to the user. I, for one, like to see a progress bar when I install something. Furthermore, you are not able to choose an install directory, it simply creates two folders on your C drive with ugly names like PPapps and ppGames or something.... I'd very much like to have a say in wheter or not - and more importantly, where - folders will be created. In my humble opinion, SetupS is unnecessary and it reminds me of the days where one had to be an IT-expert himself to get a copied game to work. But this is the 21st century, guys...come on!"

Then it appears everything is working exactly as it was intended ;-)

The folder issue (ppApps/ppGames) is actually done on purpose ? that is afterall the nature and reason for having (p)ermanent & (p)ortable (App)lications or (Games) to begin with. Combined with SetupS it makes for a simplier unattended install ? for which these releases are specifically packaged for those that use these tools. As I?m sure you are already aware, there are plenty of places to find these games and such with their original installers, etc. but that was not the intent or purpose behind these releases meant for unattended installs.

But you?re right that perhaps SetupS is a little too silent and mute about its activities ? and one of the reasons it has been updated to a version that -- while not quite a progress bar (yet) ? now it does give some indication that it is doing something. Check it out here:

,TheFreezerBox,2010-02-22T22:44Z,"sheesh, what an ugly mess with tpb's comment system... my apologies but there's no way to edit these. ugh!"
,TheFreezerBox,2010-02-26T17:39Z,"Anyway, the ppApps or ppGames folder(s) can be moved to any drive of your liking... doesn't have to be limited to your system or C: drive. For example, on another non-system drive or partition even a usb-flash drive. Then after moving, be sure to run the ppApps/ppGames Shortcut generator to recreate new Start Menu shortcuts."
,ousia79,2010-03-01T02:58Z,"Well, I've successfully installed and run the game, but I have 2 issues...
1:  The Resolution - Is there any way to get fullscreen with this game - the lowest resolution I am capable of is 800x600 and it looks a bit goofy like that
2:  I can't save!! The program crashes when I try to save :( 
I'm using Windows XP SP 3
Anyone have any tips?"
,ousia79,2010-03-01T03:00Z,Also - I've tried running the game in compatibility mode for 640x480 resolution but that just crashes the game as soon as I run it :(
,ousia79,2010-03-02T02:47Z,"Update: running the included ""TLJFIX.EXE"" fixed all my problems.  Thanks for the super swell post. :)"
,kaimles,2010-07-04T03:53Z,"@ TheFreezerBox. I was looking to download this game again when I found this torrent. I had completely forgotten that I wrote these comments. I must have had a bad day or something. I'm realise it's a program in development, trying to make a name for itself, with a dedicated developer that probably put some serious time and effort into it. I should support such initiatives instead of being a dick. I apologize."
,Dmaj87,2010-08-08T05:16Z,"thanx a lot! when this game came out I played the demo version and fell for this game. ever since, I've been longing for the day I'd play the full game. today is that day! and I could not be happier! all thanx to you and seeders. thank you all :)"
,linc8485,2010-08-24T10:19Z,"ok...this is really frustrating me..i cant find the SetupS program anywhere...i click on the links in the comment box and a piratebay page pops up saying ""Not Found""..what the hell"
,DoomE.,2011-04-08T17:11Z,*sigh* I can't find a working download link for SetupS anywhere. Does anyone around here know where I can get it?
,xLaNdiNgStRiPx,2011-05-20T23:05Z,"here is the link. best of luck.
