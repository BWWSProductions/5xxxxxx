,Breadbin,2010-01-23T04:25Z,"no problem
yup thats them
gbatemp is the holy grail"
,zxkb4s29,2010-01-25T18:10Z,"does NOT work on wii 4.2e + wasabi dx v3.0b

tried to patch with regionfrii to PAL does NOT work."
,Breadbin,2010-01-25T20:11Z,"do not patch! that is why it doesnt work
if you burn the disc and run it in your loader it will work, i use 4.2 and im pal, just leave the file and bung it in the wii"
,Gunner1110,2010-01-26T00:54Z,"just tried it on D2CKey PAL, doesn't work - wii says the disk is a coaster.

burned with imageburn, on 4x speed.

any ideas why?"
,zxkb4s29,2010-01-26T01:06Z,"@Breadbin: i mean
1) does not work
2) then tried to patch does not work
hence the newline between them."
,Breadbin,2010-01-26T02:41Z,"ah in that case i can only recommend gbatemp, my wii is softmodded rather than hard. I would try the gamer guuy torrent and follow instructions on gbatemp or the link above"
,zxkb4s29,2010-01-28T10:50Z,"@Breadbin: no, thank you. never."

Could someone please seed? I was doing 300KB earlier."
