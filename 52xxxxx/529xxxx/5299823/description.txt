OK Credits first the iso file was taken from gamerguys page, all credit for getting it. This is merely a version with the translation work already done. The good people at http://cameraslens.com/ created the patch that i have used to create this image (using scrubber and partition builder). THATS ALL IVE DONE.
This works if you burn it to disc and so im sure it'll work with usb loaders too
The only downside is that ghost names CAN appear jumbled up.
