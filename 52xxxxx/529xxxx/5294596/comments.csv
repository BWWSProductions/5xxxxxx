,aliomattux,2010-01-26T22:01Z,The server licensing and hotfolder functions do not work. period. There is a crack for the hotfolder program but it just crashes and does not respond.
,en_rysk_kille,2010-02-07T11:06Z,"Please tell, does it work? How about viruses and 15 days limit?"
,en_rysk_kille,2010-02-08T10:52Z,Installed yesterday. Seems no viruses and trial period warnings. The program works fine so far. 
,Thyron.Flare,2010-02-10T15:11Z,"works perfectly, just copy and overwritte. easy and fuctional seeding rigth now!!!"
,31ir8tn,2010-02-12T13:06Z,Yeah for any one who has had it installed for the last at least 15 days (usual trial period) please report if all functions including the ability to save OCR'd files keep working.
,en_rysk_kille,2010-02-25T00:25Z,It's been working OK for 18 days. No flaws detected yet.
,vroom333,2010-02-28T12:45Z,"Apologies in advance!! I'm a Mac user, but stranded on a PC in need of this OCR software. I've downloaded successfully, disconnected internet & ran installation (single user). but when click to start it gives me 3 choices: BUY, SERIAL, EXIT... So no luck there...
Thyron.Flare mentioned ""just copy and overwritte"", but I don't know what that means & what I need to do. sorry for the bother but pls help. Thnx"
,en_rysk_kille,2010-03-02T22:00Z,"Program's been working perfectly for about a month!
To vroom333: Just copy all the Patch folder files to the installation directory (Program Files x86\ABBYY FineReader)."
,kittenV,2010-04-05T11:25Z,"works great!!! cool!!!

thx to nikita200"
,foxelein,2010-06-17T20:07Z,"its work.. many thx nikita,.. :)"
,clashmash,2010-09-02T06:37Z,"No offense, Nikita2000 and I see that you are a high quality distributor, but AVAST! is detecting a Trojan Horse when I try to install Abbyy. 

NSIS:DOWNLOADER-Z (TRJ) it is.

Just a fake alert? Did any one else had this issue?"
,st55-z,2010-10-14T20:35Z,Thanks! 
,cdgaucho,2010-10-25T14:36Z,"I downloaded the torrent, but, like vroom333, I am unable to use the software. I can't overwrite the licence requirment. I have no idea where, or, indeed if, there is a crack included in this download. If there is, I can't find it. If, like me, you're only moderately competent at downloading apps, you'll be unable to use this. "
,reghin78,2010-10-31T12:21Z,"@cdgaucho 
the alleged crack files are inside the rar archive that you downloaded, in a folder entitled ""patch"". To ""crack"" this software you must copy the files inside \patch to your abbyy installation folder (i.e. c:\program files\ abbyy). 
Remember that the first stage of the installation only extracts the files needed for a second stage.
You can only tell for sure that the patch works after 15 days/50 pages OCRd. 
So start printing/waiting."
,Ispanecabg,2011-05-08T10:24Z,Works fine.
,vapy27,2011-05-23T21:26Z,working. no virus with nod. 10x
