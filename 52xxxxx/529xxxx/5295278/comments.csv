,hadouk,2010-01-21T16:07Z,"Hey Mate,

Just to let you know you ain't helping us out. We asked We7 if they could preview our album to the true fans, to help us out. You are not. 

We respect that piracy is gonna happen, but hopefully not before the actual release. Its people like you an music leechers who mean we might not be able to afford to make music in the future.

Respect to all our true fans out there who support our music by buying it, not leeching.

Love you and fuk u....

Hadouken!"
,madmatttbh,2010-01-22T00:31Z,You're just bitter that you couldn't top Not Here to Please You.
,individual6827,2010-01-22T00:43Z,"Firstly, allowing We7 to preview your album track by track shows you have no respect for the cohesive artform of an album.

Secondly, if people want to buy your music, they will. If people don't want to buy your music, they won't. It's a concept that many people don't seem to grasp; that every download isn't a lost sale. These are people who want to hear your music; some have already said they've pre-ordered the album. So why patronise your fans and treat them like they aren't capable of their own decision? People aren't downloading this for any malicious reason, they're downloading it because they want to hear and enjoy your music. Now isn't that what any band wants?

Thirdly, don't see this as something negative. Think of it as free promotion. It isn't like it's being presented in a fashion that doesn't represent it in a way that you wouldn't want it to be seen.. And also, I think a leak will get far better exposure than a promotion on We7. If something happens on We7, it will most likely stay on We7. If a leak happens, it'll spread like wildfire; I came across this from another website. And don't you ever think that some people may stumble across it, download it, like it and then buy it? You've just got a new fan through piracy; is it so bad now? Leaks have done well for some releases, it can generate word-of-mouth and hype for the new album and can in some instances help album sales. An example of this would be Kid A by Radiohead.

I know that leaks can seem bad but they can do good. You should embrace this because you are seeing that people are interested in your music. If you album leaks and no one cares, there's when you have problems.

Just remember this. Don't treat your fans like criminals. And don't treat your fans like idiots.

By the way what are your opinions on people who download the leak but still have full intentions to buy the album?

And why release an album first in Japan when you know that your core fan base is in England? Why make them wait?

Well it's obvious from this leak that they can't."
,NegativeGrr,2010-01-23T00:57Z,"So here it goes. To be completely honest I'm actually quite pissed at the comment Hadouk left, Seriously? Not a real fan? I have preordered this and i'm downloading it right now to see if my money was worth it, and i hope it is. The state of the music industry today makes it to where this HAS to happen, because you never know what you waste your money on. You didnt want it leaked you shouldnt have made that deal now should you?"
,joec99,2010-01-23T01:25Z,"@negativegrr 

i dont think the band are having a go at fans who download the music and then buy it but tbh most people who get stuff on pirate bay never buy it (i do but i kno a lot of ppl who dont) 
"
,altr1,2010-01-25T09:55Z,"i only decided to buy the cd after hering this first. so it was at least a good thing after all for some people. the way the music industry works needs to change a bit in the times we are.
i probbably will hear it mostly in mp3, cd format its a bit obsolete right now for me. i just wanted the signed copy :) (and support the band too) ;)"
,bignelly,2010-01-25T14:18Z,"@ individual6827

Completely agree, if i like this i will buy it......but if it is shite i wont. 

All up mate, good comments."
,tirentu,2010-01-25T20:36Z,"Being from Canada, I will buy this if I ever see it in a store, along with all your other releases. However, being in a rural area, I can't. So I download it in the meantime."
,thatnewthing,2010-01-25T23:30Z,"
""Respect to all our true fans out there who support our music by buying it, not leeching.""

i've bought a number of things from you guys (@hadouk) and after being shafted on the special edition of 'music for an accelerated culture' i have no problem 'sampling' this album.
if it's worthwhile i'll pull out the credit card and hit up your shop but you angered at least one fan with the poor handling & execution of the offers that were meant to go with the special edition."
,Smellson69,2010-01-31T17:41Z,"If you guys actually think thats Hadouken! and not just some random person, ur morons"
,zelius,2010-08-09T12:34Z,"I love how your (Hadouken!) ignorant comment just made you more sale losses than ""piracy"" EVER will... Simply because the sale loss that your label has probably pushed through your heads is simply not there... Things like spotify and the fact that music is a much much wider culture nowadays just brings the cost to question and this is what the labels have trouble getting past. Anyhow, you should honestly take a lesson from NiN who actually seem to have a proper view of how things are. This is the last album I'll buy from you as many more, I had NO idea who you were untill i just found your music randomly in a movie i downloaded, after that I've bought 7 albums (gifts not for myself only) So honestly, this does you only good. Ignorant fucking pricks

Sincerly yours, 
Zelius 

P.S. Please for the love of god, don't do your own press or you will RUIN yourself before you even get started properly."
,NeverNeverNever,2011-01-05T07:50Z,"If you guys believe that troll is Hadouken!, then you're all fucking retarded."
