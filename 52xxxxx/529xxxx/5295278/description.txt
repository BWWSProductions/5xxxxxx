Hadouken - For The Masses

If you like the album you MUST buy it from 
http://hadouken.sandbag.uk.com/Store/DII-1219-1-new+album++presale.html
the band now operate from their own label and it only costs 6 pounds for a signed copy!

The only reason I have uploaded this is because WE7 are putting up new tracks from the album everyday! Ruining the fact of it being an 'album' and spoon feeding it for their promotional needs.

So simple have fun. Buy it. If you don't your a prick simples ;)

@Hadouken

The album is already released in japan. If you don't want it to leak before it's release in england then why make a deal with WE7 to do just that.
