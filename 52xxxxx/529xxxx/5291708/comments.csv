P.S:There's a serious hater here who wants to dedicate his life to ruining my quality status on TPB.:))"

Thanks G"
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-20T14:04Z,"Agreed.Cliche` driven plot,wooden characters and cheesy one liners don't make avatar a movie that's worth 2 golden globes,especially best motion picture and best director but I won't say I didn't enjoy it for what it was,a visual spectacle and nothing more.If I would have seen it at home instead of the cinema I would have thought much much less of it.Also I think it's gonna win an oscar for FX which is fine by me but it's incredibly overrated."

,_shorty_,2011-06-14T00:26Z,"Very annoying that you used the .mp4 contqainor for this, since the .mp4 only supports aac. Just dumb to use this folder when it's a movie in 5.1 sound, and then use a sound format that no reciver can handle.. (witch the .mp4 require) If you had made a .mkv insetead you could have used the ac3 standard, witch every reciver understand, instead of uploading a torrent witch actualy is just in sterio... mp4 is just for the apple idiots, and do they need 5.1 on theyr ipads?  Luckely, conwerting this to .mkw is easy. -just realy annoying"
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-09-28T11:32Z,"dont matter what they up in some tool will always moan-mkv? dont think so=-standard torrent tools are dvd shrink & auto gordian knot.simple generic codecs that everyone can hear ,cheers for the up"
