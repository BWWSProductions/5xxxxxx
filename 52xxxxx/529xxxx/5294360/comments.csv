[V],trfkad,2010-01-20T21:13Z,"What the hell means ""locked""?
and what's wrong with this torrent ?"
,roger.fed,2010-01-20T23:10Z,"Thanks,Great album!!"
,hamiltonfelix,2010-01-27T02:38Z,"Indeed, Monserik, what is this 'locked' of which you speak?  "
,heymopho,2010-01-28T02:27Z,"These files are not mp3, they are mp2... (yeah, this format exists)

Tried to transfer it to iPod and iTunes says I can't."
,blueboy2419,2010-01-29T11:54Z,"Although the file extension says mp3, this is not in mp3 format. Please be clear in your posts."
,shinOUU,2010-02-02T03:24Z,Mp2 and quality sounds like a blown speaker.
,Stimey33,2010-02-04T14:27Z,"thx 4 the mp2 warning.  was just about to download, but something told me to chk the comments 1st.  Keep up the epicness TPB users!!!"
,woodrowwilsonsmith,2010-02-07T12:23Z,"Did NO ONE read the MS Word file accompanying this? The one that says ""Read this before playing""? THIS TORRENT IS BOGUS.  You're told to go to some jerkoff's website and fill out forms for a ""14 day free trial"" of some product in order to get a ""password"" which will allegedly let you unzip what are described as .zip files mislabeled as .mp3 files...a track at a time. I repeat: THIS TORRENT IS SPAM.  Would all 601 seeders please stop seeding it? I have. I'd rather take the hit to my ratio than pass it on to innocent strangers."

,meddoc21,2010-05-09T16:29Z,"Some peeps are simply TOO STUPID to dload from these sites.

USE A FILE CONVERT PROGGY YOU DUMB $H1T$ TO CONVERT TO mp3

if you don't want to convert then play using VLC Player
NOT THE PIECE OF $H1T WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER.
GREAT UP trfcad plays and sounds just like it should"
,scjrpb,2010-05-28T05:06Z,"just dl ed and it works . no alternative web site or ""locked issue"" transfered to itunes and it plays."
,les907,2010-09-12T00:22Z,"Thanks trfkad. I don't know what original drama revolved around the MP format. All of these tracks came out in MP3 format, playable on my iTunes player AND MPCStar/TigerPlayer. Quality is just fine. Maybe the low softness of the 1st track threw some off as the entire audio quality but I took that as intentional, since the other tracks work fine."
,biggles888,2011-07-28T13:04Z,Many thanks for this
