"What started as two young men playing spontaneous shows in parking lots for the sheer joy of playing music, has now been cultivated into something much more. The two highschool friends, Orie Rush and Lee McIntosh, realized that they had stumbled onto something beautiful, and their love for music grew throughout their next two years of college. By sending short song ideas, riffs, and beats to each other, they began to assemble a very rough skeleton of an EP. When they seriously started considering the idea of self producing an album and playing shows, they decided that they had to find a steady bassist, which is when they discovered a third brother by brain, Alex Montgomery. Excluding random bits of caveman-esque curiosity, their focus remains steady, and they continue to forge ahead on completing their first album."
