Most applications installed on your PC are built with these installers. Each installer has its unique install database, which makes it difficult to find all the changes programs' make to your computer.

To solve this problem, Your Uninstaller! has an advanced feature called: SmartUninstallâ„¢. SmartUninstallâ„¢ knows more than 100 installer data format and could search the entire disk for traces left by normal uninstaller. It performs system level monitoring and scanning to get good result.

Sounds complex? No! You do not have to know this, for all these operations can be done in a few clicks, it's transparent to end users.
Completely Uninstall

Your Uninstaller can list "hidden" programs that you can't view using the Windows Add/Remove program. The standard Add/Remove program often can't uninstall applications completely-leaving broken registry keys and unused files on the hard disk. Big registries and large numbers of unnecessary files make system slow. Your Uninstaller! clears broken keys and files in seconds using SmartUninstallâ„¢!
