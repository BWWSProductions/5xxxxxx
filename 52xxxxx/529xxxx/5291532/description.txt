[::Review::]

Back in Black is the 7th studio album (in Australia, 6th in the rest of the world) by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released on 25 July 1980. Back in Black was the first AC/DC album recorded without former lead singer Bon Scott, who had died at the age of 33 on 19 February 1980. The band considered disbanding following Scott's death, but they ultimately decided to continue and shortly thereafter hired Brian Johnson as their new lead singer and lyricist. Producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange, who had previously worked with AC/DC on Highway to Hell, was again brought in to produce. The recordings were done at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas.
The album was remastered and re-released first in late 1994, then again in the Bonfire box set in 1997, and as part of the AC/DC Remasters Series in 2003. In addition, a Dualdisc version was released in 2004, featuring the album in enhanced LPCM Stereo format and the video documentary The Story of Back in Black.
It sold an estimated 45 million copies to date, making it second behind only to Michael Jackson's Thriller as the best-selling album of all-time as well as the best selling album ever released by a band. On 13 December 2007, the RIAA certified it 22Ã— Multi Platinum, recognising sales of 22 million in the United States.
Back in Black contains some of AC/DC's biggest hits, including "Hells Bells", "You Shook Me All Night Long", and the title track "Back in Black." According to Angus Young the album's all-black cover was a "sign of mourning" for Scott, as black is the traditional Western colour of mourning.
Despite its massive commercial success, it is not AC/DC's highest charting album in the U.S, peaking at #4; their next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, hit #1 in 1981 as did the band's 2008 album Black Ice.
In 1989, it was ranked #26 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80's. In 2003, the album was ranked number 73 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[8] VH1 named 'Back in Black' as one of the biggest comeback albums of all time and also rated it as #2 in VH1 Greatest Hard Rock Songs.

The song Have a Drink On Me was in the 2006 movie Beerfest.

American Death Metal Band Six Feet Under covered the album in its entirety on their album Graveyard Classics 2.
