,Bobthedeadly,2010-03-31T05:10Z,"Works for me... sorta. Few notes:

-The requirements are STEEP. I have a brand new White Unibody MacBook with a 2.26 GHz processor and 4 GB of RAM and it lags like shit even when I turn everything all the way down.

-The controls are awful, and you can't remap them. Also, unless you have a 2 button mouse, you're screwed. The freerunning requires holding down the right mouse button, it is very difficult if you're trying to use a laptop like me.

Also, the reason the video gets out of sync with the audio is because your computer can't render the moving people fast enough, and the audio always plays normally. You can make the cutscenes run a little smoother by turning the graphics way down.

This game does technically work, but it's very difficult because of the combination between lag and bad controls. I know that I don't have the fastest computer ever, but every other game I have works fine and so should this game. The Ubisoft games always have this trouble. I have Prince of Persia for the mac, and despite not being any more graphically impressive than, say, Bioshock, it lags like a bitch. Also, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed has very steep requirements, and even though I havent played it on my computer, I doubt it'd run."
