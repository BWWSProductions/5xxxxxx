,sugardaddyLL,2010-01-19T15:42Z,"I saw you guys had some of BBC's Eastenders torrents, any chance you might have some more or be able to do a few seasons? Feel free to message me maybe we can work something out brokenwingz81@yahoo.com"
,BigSniff,2010-01-19T18:35Z,"I guess people don't understand the concept of PEER TO PEER in this place, they bitch and moan that downloads are slow yet at the same time limit their upload speed to 1kB/s and stop the torrent as soon as it's done.

I've been watching peers get to 100% then poof, they're gone, never to be seen again.

,sonews,2010-01-20T05:25Z,"I sometimes set my upload speed to 256kb/s because it slows my download speed when i'm downloading at 25 kb/s and uploading at 800+ kb/s.  But yes,  I agree with you.  People who set it at 1kb/s should be banned..."
,dudelaw,2010-01-21T01:08Z,"I always keep my down and upload on unlimited works for me. One thing is really frustrating that i dont get is that sometimes the download is slower than the upload, why is that? It can be a big difference..  "

,didthedash,2010-01-23T11:56Z,"To the uploader and all downloaders...

Van Diemen's Land (the movie) is an independent film made by film makers, who received absolutely no financial support from commercial or government sources at all, and made this film using there own funds. I'm aware that the film makers haven't broke even yet, and therefore no-one except the distributor has been paid as of yet.

It might be ok to download films and music of large, powerful studios that can soak up the loss of revenue from piracy. This however is not one of those films. Van Diemen's Land is made by a group of passionate film makers, who have made a difficult film the best they can with limited resources. I think its time they got paid.

Please, if you value independent films and if you like this film please buy an official copy of the DVD. You can order it online here...

,mr.eddy,2010-01-24T12:20Z,didthedash  you're a silly little piece of sh@t...
,dudelaw,2010-01-30T03:38Z,"To:didthedash.
Nice of You to mention that the filmmakers are not making any money.. Or havent broke even yet.. Did You buy the movie after You downloaded it? Do You really think that they care that much about the money? I mean if they couldt raise the money from someoneelse to finance the movie to begin wth they probably are pleased that Pirate Bay and alike sites are putting out theyre work to a bigger and wider public... They didn´t have any fundings creating the movie? We´ll this is free so it would be right up their alley! If You are so full of insight about this movie and it´s creators let them know about Your comment here and let them comment here instead.. I liked the movie and would never heard about nor seen it if it wasnt for The Pirate Bay.."
,smoogE,2010-05-16T21:14Z,Wouldn't mind paying for it. Release it in the U.S. as an NTSC DVD and I will !
