Thunder - Ballads by Thunder(mp3 320)ICM369 
___________________________________________

Thunder are a very underrated rock band from the UK. 
They were formed in 1989 by singer Danny Bowes and guitarist 
Luke Morley, who had previously been together in a band 
called Terraplane.

The singer has an excellent and very powerful voice and Bowes 
is a great guitarist, they specialise in quite commercial and 
catchy songs, and are known for the quality of their ballads 
hence this album which is a collection of their ballads from 
over the years.

It is worth mentioning some of the standout tracks, though, 
as they deserve a place in any rock fan's record collection.

Love walked in leads off which is quite apt since it's one of 
the best and most known songs. 
 
Castles in the sand is brilliant, Its about feeling that love 
has passed you by, that you keep building castles in the sand 
only to see them washed away.

Low life in high places is a very well written song, the theme 
is pretty self evident from the title its about how some of the 
worst of human behaviour comes from people who have risen to 
powerful positions, especially politicians. 
It includes some nice acoustic guitars and Bowes voice is in 
good form.

A better man as with a number of their ballads, its a song that 
you could wallow in if you were in a mood to just wallow in ballads! 
It does have a positive outlook though; it's basically saying that 
when I look in the mirror, I see a better man and thats because of 
the love that he feels for the woman in his life.

I picked this album up very cheap in a sale so am very happy with it. 

However, they never managed to achieve huge commercial success but 
have been feted by many people in the rock business as one of the 
genre's hidden gems. 
I'm sure that Axl Rose once said they were a band that he liked and 
that they were once picked to tour with Aerosmith.
