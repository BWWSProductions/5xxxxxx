Thanks"
,MICR0S0FT,2011-02-22T01:01Z,"Asked for internet access *DENIED IT*

Installed fine after skipping that part.

Went to OPEN the program to enter the serial...
PROGRAM CRASHES...

Help would be good from this point on. Oh, if I grant
access to internet, it throws up the message:
""this is an illegal copy and legal action can now be
taken against you""

Waiting for reply from someone who got this working
with STEP-BY-STEP instructions on how to get it
to function correctly. I used to have and use this
program on my old laptop, and now this program
just seems to not want people to install illegal copies
of it.. what a joke.. STEP-BY-STEP instructions pls."
,MICR0S0FT,2011-02-24T23:52Z,"********************************
