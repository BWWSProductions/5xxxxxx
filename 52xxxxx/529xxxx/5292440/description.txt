Spirit caravan - Elusive Thruth  2000


Spirit Caravan's second full album release!

Spirit Caravan is the band Wino formed after playing with Saint Vitus and the Obsessed.

In my humble oppinion Wino did his best work in Spirit Caravan, this second full album release prooves Wino's brilliance once again!

After the band was disbanded Wino did an album with Victor Griffin's Place of Skulls and later formed The Hidden Hand...after that band was disbanded he did a great solo album under his own name.
