I can change computer date and restart the trial but does anyone know where the trial date check is kept?  Have tried to remove all traces of program from computer but still says trial expired when reinstalled.  BTW, thanks for this."
,kendeats,2010-01-21T19:38Z,I wish folks would describe what these applications do.
,TheStich,2010-01-22T01:30Z,"Thanks man! Great app to help parents on their new mac (currently iChating, asking how to import photos - again)

@kendeats - Google it you lazy shit! If you don't even know what it is, you probably won't be interested in it."
,papawillie,2010-01-22T06:33Z,"@classy35- Do not download the trial from Camtasia. If you did, uninstall immediately. Use the app. from the torrent better. When asked for serial close the app. Open Patch then drag and drop Camtasia app to patch. If anyone needs help installing feel free to email me at                                mikecarona@live.com"
,kendeats,2010-01-24T01:13Z,TheStitch is a flamethrower. I suppose we are all supposed to google each and every submission here to find out what it does.

,Tragedy773,2010-01-27T14:25Z,"How to fix the Problem with the ""Trial expired"" warning:

1) Download the torrent
2) Unzip
3) Open Setup Folder and Camtasia
4) Replace it with your old one
5) Change your date to somwhere before you downloaded the trial
6) Follow the other Steps (crack the app etc.)

Hope this works for you! "
,papawillie,2010-01-28T08:31Z,"THANKS TRAGEDY773,
YOUR SUGGESTION DOES WORK."
,Wuzafish,2010-11-22T18:16Z,"Thanks dude, will seed!"
,MarkGibbons,2011-01-25T18:01Z,"I lost camstasia from my PC when I move to mac, hopefully this works. Downloading now, Speed is slow though, I'll comment again later if it works or not. "
,MarkGibbons,2011-01-25T18:19Z,"Works beautifully, thank you. Extreme slow speeds though, 10KB/S"
,timirod,2011-06-19T19:20Z,Works perfect! Thanks Papawillie!
,remicornelissen,2011-07-12T17:29Z,"The software is working fine, but I do have one problem. Like... Today... From the 43 minutes which I record, Camtasia makes a video of only the first 9 minutes and 32 seconds! So not the whole recording!
In the complete 43 minutes which I want to record, my laptop is getting filled with megabites (so until I press the 'stop recording' button), so you would expect that Camtasia makes a video of the complete 43 minutes, but sadly this is not what happened.
Does anyone know how to fix this? Any help would be appreciated, thank you."
,windlea,2011-10-16T10:49Z,How come it only records the mouse. The rest of the screen is black. How do you fix this? Thx
