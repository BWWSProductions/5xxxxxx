           Fourteen-year-old Tyler encounters an alien ship which         
           makes him appear older, inexplicably turns him into a          
           "Skyrunner" with incomprehensible powers. This turns his       
           high school life upside down, and may enable him to help       
           his slightly clueless older brother's love life. After he      
           is abducted by beings who intend to takeover of Earth, he      
           must depend on his inept, lovelorn, and goofy brother to       
           rescue him.
