Game Notes

Glory and Adventure await as you return to save Ancient Egypt from certain
doom in Luxor: Amun Rising. The sequel to the runaway hit action-puzzle
game, you must defeat the rebellious Princes of Megiddo before they
overthrow the Pharaoh and plunge the Two Lands into chaos! Once again, the
challenge will not be an easy one as you battle through 88 awesome, all-new
levels. You must use your mystical winged scarab to shoot magical spheres,
making matches of three or more to destroy the approaching colored spheres.
Stop them all before they can reach the Pyramids at the ends of the
paths...or all of Egypt is doomed!
