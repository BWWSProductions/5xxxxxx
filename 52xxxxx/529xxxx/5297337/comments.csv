,eleventy4,2010-10-21T23:13Z,Thank you!  My CD got all screwed up and many of the versions floating around the interwebs are very bad quality with a very low imprint.  This is exactly what I need.  Rock on
,disimagery2,2011-01-02T20:57Z,"To do  FLAC at 100% quality should use-

EAC [secure mode], creating a Noncompliant
Cue sheet  [this allows us to reassemble the original cd image; with correct gaps between tracks] and supply us w/ a log sheet which verifies 'All Tracks Accurately Ripped, No Error.'

Maybe redo [please]."
