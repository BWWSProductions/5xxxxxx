The Last Don: Live [CD & DVD] was also nominated for "Urban Music Album" at the 2005 Latin Grammy Awards. He is currently signed to VI Music and Machete Music through Universal Music Latino.

Omar's May 2006 album King of Kings, became history's highest ranking reggaeton LP in the top 10 US charts, with its debut at #1 on the Latin sales charts and the #1 spot on the Billboard Latin Rhythm Radio Chart with his single â€œAngelitoâ€.[2] Omar was also able to beat the in-store appearance sales record at Disney World's Virgin music store previously set by pop star Britney Spears.

In April 2007, Don Omar received the Latin Billboard award for "Reggaeton Album Of The Year" for King of Kings.[3] The songs "Los Bandoleros" and "Conteo" were featured in the movie The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift in the ending credits.

On September 18, 2007, LandrÃ³n was briefly under police custody in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, when a local company sued him after he canceled a concert scheduled for earlier that year in La Paz, Bolivia as part of an international tour titled "Up Close".[4] The organization claimed that he had stolen $70,000 due to the cancellation.[4] LandrÃ³n responded that he canceled the concert because the company didn't provide air tickets in time.[4] After the case was presented before a local judge, both parts reached an agreement.[4] LandrÃ³n was allowed to leave the country in order to comply with a previously scheduled appearance in Buenos Aires on Argentine television and returned the next day to hold his concert in Santa Cruz's Tahuichi Aguilera soccer stadium.[citation needed]

[edit] September 2004 arrest

On September 2004, LandrÃ³n and three companions were detained by police personnel in Puerto Rico.[9] He was subsecuently charged with drug and weapon possession, after being allegedly found by policemen Arnaldo HernÃ¡ndez and NeftalÃ­ Molina consuming cannabis in a white Hummer.[9] On June 30, 2008, LandrÃ³n attended the first court hearing in the drug case against him, accompanied by Guerrido, his brother Luis LandrÃ³n and his mother, ToÃ±ita Rivera. The charges were reviewed by the judge and several people were interviewed as potential members of the jury.[9] The jury was selected on July 8, 2008.[10] Two days later, Judge Angel RamÃ­rez RamÃ­rez of the Tribunal de Carolina denied a prosecutor's request to extract a DNA sample from a marijuana cigarette, noting that if a previous test done in June brings back negative results the charges against LandrÃ³n may be dropped. [11] The hearings had to be posponed on July 10, 2008, because one of the prosecution's witnesses was unable to attend due to pregnancy.[12] The DNA tests were "inconclusive".[13] On July 22, 2008, the charges against Landron were dropped by the prosecution, after several inconsistencies appeared in the witness accounts.[14]
