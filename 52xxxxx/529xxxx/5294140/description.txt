This is a reseed of all 5 torrents combined into one, originally downloaded from the cranky authoritarians over at TheBox.bz. Not only did they ban me twice, for no good reason, they also banned the original uploader of this great show! Nice one. Great way to run a community! I just want others to be able to enjoy this show.

This series cannot be purchased and only exists on VHS rips. Sadly, this is as good as it gets. Thus it is not exactly being 'pirated', but preserved.

Torrent 3 comment: This third episode misses the last five minutes.

Torrent 4 comment: This fourth episode only has the first 11 and a half minutes.  However it does include a hilarious sketch on 'scientologee' from mighty boosh's Rich Fulcher (Bob Fossil). I have found another full episode that I will upload next.

British sketch comedy show


Comments from IMDB:



I can understand why many people would be bewildered and possibly almost frightened by this sort of comedy; it was raw and it was completely uncompromising.



Comedy Nation was a platform for new talent to break into television, it was a very jumbled sketch show with many writers and performers adding pieces; it was completely un-linked and totally unrefined. Yes there were some dodgy pieces, but there was also a great deal of genius on show; it seems everybody currently producing alternative British television comedy had a part in this show and it served very well as a stepping stone for some of the best acts on TV. The likes of Kevin Eldon, Julia Davis, Peter Serafinowicz, David Mitchell, Robert Webb and Johnny Vegas; to name a few.



The most acessible character from COMEDY NATION is Bulla played by Ricky Grover . Bulla is based upon a real life British prisoner called Charles Bronsan who`s widely regarded as the hardest man in the British penal system. Bulla`s catch phrase " I`m a lovely guy but I get a little bit naughty " did become something of a cult item in the late 1990s.



Comedy Nation contained the kind of sketches that left you stunned; The Divine David, a kind of beat up, bitter transvestite, Simon Munnery's 'league against tedium', and of course, the Gaa Haa clown, the embodiment of insanity. I suppose you either like it or you don't, but if you don't, I think you're really missing out.
