Hood dedicated the album to Arthur Alexander, Sam Phillips and Jerry Wexler.

After the release of Pizza Deliverance the band began touring some 150 dates in as little as six months. It was during the beginning of the tour that Brad Morgan replaced Matt Lane on drums due to Lane's decision to focus more on his own band, The Possibilities. Most of Drive-By Trucker's breakthrough album, Southern Rock Opera, was written while the band toured in support of Pizza Deliverance.

Pizza Deliverance saw guitarist Mike Cooley's first major contributions to the band (aside from Gangstabilly's "Panties In Your Purse") as his songwriting and lyrical style continued to develop.
