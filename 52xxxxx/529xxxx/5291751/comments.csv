,Video_Veg,2010-07-06T03:20Z,"A side of Bush's War that should be told, I suppose; and for people like to darken up a sunny afternoon with a depressing human interest drama - this film is for you.  Not  my preference for movie entertainment and fast-forwarded through it before delete.  
Not that it's bad, just not my ""Cup of Tea""."
