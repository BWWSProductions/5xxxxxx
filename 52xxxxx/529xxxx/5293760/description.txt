Padme and Jar Jar are captured while searching for a secret Separatist bio-weapons lab, sparking Anakin, Obi-Wan and Ahsoka to try and save their friends and halt the release of a deadly virus.

118 - Mystery of a Thousand Moons

Wat Tambor's Separatist forces invade Ryloth. Anakin's fleet is sent to penetrate a space blockade to clear a path for ground troop landing. Ahsoka disobeys Anakin's orders when she leads blue squadron for the first time and loses most of her squadron, prompting Anakin to help give his Padawan a lesson in respect for authority - and the opportunity for redemption.

To sabotage a powerful Separatist weapon, Obi-Wan and a small clone force enter an occupied town, and discover that its Twi'lek residents are being used as a living shield. Two of the troopers, Waxer and Boil, stumble upon a little girl named Numa and take it upon themselves to keep her from harm.

With his forces stretched thin, Mace Windu must convince Twi'lek freedom fighter Cham Syndulla to help him save the capital city, and the planet, from the droids' destruction.
