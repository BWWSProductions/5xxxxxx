Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil Zero exposes the back story and internal
tyranny of the Umbrella Corporation and lets players discover the origins of
the T-Virus in an epic storyline that tells the horrors leading up to the infamous
mansion incident. Only available on the Nintendo GameCube until now,
Resident Evil Zero brings Rebecca Chambers - rookie member of S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team
- to Raccoon City, where she must investigate a series of gruesome murders.
Almost immediately she stumbles upon a military transport truck filled with corpses
and her journey of horror begins. Rebecca encounters Billy Coen, an ex-Marine
convicted on circumstantial evidence for the murder of 23 people. Players will get
to control both Rebecca and Billy simultaneously using the Partner Zapping system,
as they fight their way out of Raccoon City.
