Install this for it to work with Windows 7. Use the x86. x64 is for XP 64bit. If you can't run this on XP properly, try installing the 64 bit patch in the zip file.

,elturbo9077,2011-04-05T23:33Z,is this a rip or repack or a full version that is compressed to fit in a dvd 4.7gb come on guys comment so people can know the other 7 gig version links are dead so i am going to download this to see what is missing  or its full 
,elturbo9077,2011-04-06T21:47Z,"OK FINALLY I HAVE DOWNLOADED IN 12 HOURS AND THIS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WANNA DOWNLOAD IT 

@kauwlette

WHAT kauwlette SAID IS WRONG THE ONLY VIDEOS MISSING ARE THE INTRO VIDEO AND THE VIDEO AFTER U PRESS TO START A NEW GAME 

THE ACTUAL VIDEO CUTSCENES ARE LOACTED IN A FOLDER CALLED [WHERE EVER YOUR GAME DIRECTORY] SCENES/LOCATIONS/ THEN U FIND FILES NAMED M01_2  M02_3 AND SO ON THEN CLICK WHICH EVER THEN U FIND A A FILE NAMED Loader_Sequence.zip AND Loader_Sequence.WHD AND VIOLA THERE IS YOUR CUTSCENES 

THE PROBLEM IS THAT IO INTERACTIVE USES TEXTURE CUTSCENES [ SAME AS GAMES HITMAN NINJA] NOT COMPUTER GENERATED TEXTURES LIKE THE INTRO VIDEOS WHICH ARE IN BINK U CAN NOT PUT TEXTURE VIDEO IN A BINK VIDEO 

THE ONLY THING THAT THE GAME IS ENGLISH AND CAN NOT CHANGE THE LANGUAGE AND THIS IS MEANT TO FIT ON A 4.7 GB DVD DISK THANKS UPLOADER NICE GOOD I AM VERY HAPPY ABOUT THIS AND WORKS ON VISTA/7 64 BIT 

IF U WANT THE VIDEOS INTRO GO TO YOU TUBE AND THERE THEY ARE"
,elturbo9077,2011-04-07T05:35Z,IN OTHER WORDS ITS A REPACK BUT WITHOUT THE INTROS VIDEOS AND THE LANGUAGES TAKEN OUT
,hurka79,2011-06-12T13:23Z,"Look's like fast. I hope work.
Thanks from Hungary!"
