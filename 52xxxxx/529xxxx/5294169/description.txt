After  the  tragic  death  of  his son, Kane leaves his family and
becomes a member of The 7 - an elite mercenary group.  After years
of  being  at  the  top of their game, a mission in Venezuela goes
terribly  wrong.  Kane escapes with the loot as the only survivor,
but is caught and sentenced to death.

But  not  all  of  The 7 did die. They want the loot back and they
want to deliver the punishment due to a traitor - death to him and
his  family.    Kane is busted out of the prison van and offered a
deal by The 7.  His wife and daughter will be spared if he returns
the loot. He will still be killed.

Lynch, a medicated psychopath sentenced to death for the murder of
his wife, is busted out of prison with Kane to be his watchdog and
make sure he fulfils the deal.

Kane - an experienced mercenary with everything to lose, and Lynch
-  an unpredictable psychopath with everything to gain, are thrown

hating each other every step of the way.
