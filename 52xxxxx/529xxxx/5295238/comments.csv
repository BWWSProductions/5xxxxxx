,Danteus,2010-02-04T00:59Z,Thanks for the books. I was wondering if you could re-release these books like the 2008 books. The 2008 pdfs you posted without the book covers had a small file size but still loaded instantly. The books in here seem to lag a bit in loading on my computer. Scrolling gets glitchy.....
,EnemyOfFun,2010-02-04T06:58Z,"Most of the 2008 stuff was OEF (Original Electrinic File) from WotC. They have since stopped producing pdf files, so now we have scans of the books, which are larger and more cumbersome.

Such is the way of the world."
