The recipe for vocalist and harmonica player Kellie Rucker?s music includes a big bowlful of blues, a spoonful of rock, a pinch of zydeco, a zest of swing, a half-cup of Americana, and a dash of soul music. The result is deliciously irresistible! Over the course of a professional career that has spanned more than 25 years, Rucker has appeared on the bill or onstage with such legends as Dizzy Gillespie, Stephen Stills, Albert Collins, James Cotton, ZZ Top, Dan Hicks, Warren Zevon, Little Feat, and B.B. King.
