,kingoearthworms,2010-01-19T08:33Z,"NOTE: For anyone who has followed my weekly TDS/TCR packs, this release marks a venture into some exciting new encoding territory, one which should yield some very noticeably better results, but which is also [b]NOT ipod compliant.[/b]  For me, the point of doing this was always about disseminating the shows in a compact format for bandwidth-challengeds and archivists.  The ipod compliancy was an afterthought; ""as long as I'm doing it anyway...""  Plus that's what frantik was doing.

But by disallowing some advanced encoding devices, ipod compliancy has a destructive impact on those two main purposes.  File sizes go up and/or quality goes down.  I know that's pretty big talk from someone who only just realized during this process review that most ipods have been capable of playing full SD resolutions for the last three years thanks to a firmware update that came like a month after I concluded my research on it.  But it still makes sense to me to put my efforts into the best encodes possible.

I mean, I don't actually own an ipod, so it's a struggle to keep up with this stuff, and to establish methods that actually work; to dot every i, as it were.  Feel free to come by SoS and school me... If there's an easy way to dot the Is AND cross the Ts, I'd love to hear it.  Anyway, I'm not really sure how many people care about this particular quality of my encodes at all... Not many at SoS, it seems, so come by to register your complaints and talk shop if you do.  I will otherwise assume no one cares much, and direct you to the regular ipod TDS/TCR postings on Usenet (which are about twice the size of mine), and the many free software tools for encoding video for ipod.
