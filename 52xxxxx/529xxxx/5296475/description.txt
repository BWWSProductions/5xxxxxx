Preface

Welcome

The goals of this book, the third edition of Mathematica Navigator: Mathematics, Statistics, 

Graphics, and
Programming, are as follows:
â€¢ô€€to introduce the reader to Mathematica; and
â€¢ô€€to emphasize mathematics (especially methods of applied mathematics), statistics, 

graphics,
programming, and writing mathematical documents.
Accordingly, we navigate the reader through Mathematica and give an overall introduction. 

Often we
slow down somewhat when an important or interesting topic of mathematics or statistics is 

encountered
to investigate it in more detail. We then often use both graphics and symbolic and numerical 

methods.
Here and there we write small programs to make the use of some procedures easier. One 

chapter is
devoted to Mathematica as an advanced environment of writing mathematical documents.
The online version of the book, which can be installed from the enclosed CD-ROM, makes the
material easily available when working with Mathematica.
Changes in this third edition are numerous and are explained later in the Preface. The 

current edition
is based on Mathematica 6. On the CD-ROM, there is material that describes the new 

properties of
Mathematica 7.



â€¡ Readership

The book may be useful in the following situations:
â€¢ô€€for courses teaching Mathematica;
â€¢ô€€for several mathematical and statistical courses (given in, for example, mathematics, 

engineering,
physics, and statistics); and
â€¢ô€€for self-study.
Indeed, the book may serve as a tutorial and as a reference or handbook of Mathematica, and 

it may
also be useful as a companion in many mathematical and statistical courses, including the 

following:
differential and integral calculus â€¢ linear algebra â€¢ optimization â€¢ differential, partial 

differential,
and difference equations â€¢ engineering mathematics â€¢ mathematical methods of physics â€¢
mathematical modeling â€¢ numerical methods â€¢ probability â€¢ stochastic processes â€¢ statistics 

â€¢
regression analysis â€¢ Bayesian statistics


â€¡ Previous Knowledge

No previous knowledge of Mathematica is assumed. On the other hand, we assume some knowledge 

of
various topics in pure and applied mathematics. We study, for example, partial differential 

equations
and statistics without giving detailed introductions to these topics. If you are not 

acquainted with a
topic, you can simply skip the chapter or section of the book considering that topic.
Also, to understand the numerical algorithms, it is useful if the reader has some knowledge 

about the
simplest numerical methods. Often we introduce briefly the basic ideas of a method (or they 

may
become clear from the examples or other material presented), but usually we do not derive 

the methods.
If a topic is unfamiliar to you, consult a textbook about numerical analysis, such as Skeel 

and Keiper
(2001).


â€¡ Recommendations

If you are a newcomer to Mathematica, then Chapter 1, Starting, is mandatory, and Chapter 2, 

Sightseeing,
is strongly recommended. You can also browse Chapter 3, Notebooks, and perhaps also Chapter 

4,
Files, so that you know where to go when you encounter the topics of these chapters. After 

that you can
proceed more freely. However, read Section 13.1, â€œBasic Techniques,â€ because it contains 

some very
common concepts used constantly for expressions.
If you have some previous knowledge of Mathematica, you can probably go directly to the 

chapter or
section you are interested in, with the risk, however, of having to go back to study some 

background
material. Again, be sure to read Section 13.1.



â€¡ Introduction, Files, Graphics, Data, Dynamics, Expressions, and Programs

The first two chapters introduce Mathematica and give a short overview.
The next two chapters consider files, particularly files created by Mathematica, which are 

called
notebooks. We show how Mathematica can be used to write mathematical documents. We also 

explain
how to load packages, how to export and import data and graphics into and from Mathematica, 

and how
to manage memory and computing time. You may skip these two chapters until you need them.
Then we go on to graphics. One of the finest aspects of Mathematica is its high-quality 

graphics, and
one of the strongest motivations for studying Mathematica is to learn to illustrate 

mathematics with
figures. We consider separately graphics for functions and graphics for data. In addition, 

we have
chapters about graphics primitives and graphics options.
New in Mathematica 6 are the built-in data sources, covering topics such as chemistry, 

astronomy,
particles, countries, cities, finance, polyhedrons, graphs, words, and colors.
The main new topic in Mathematica 6 is dynamics. This allows us to easily build interactive 

interfaces.
The user of such an interface can choose some parameters or other options and the output 

will be
changed dynamically, in real time. This helps in studying various models and phenomena.
Then we study various types of expressions, from numbers to strings, mathematical 

expressions,
lists, tables, and patterns.
We have two chapters relating to programming. The first studies functions and the next 

various
styles of programming. Four styles are considered: procedural, functional, rule-based, and 

recursive.


â€¡ Mathematics and Statistics

In the remaining 12 chapters, we study different areas of pure and applied mathematics and 

statistics.
The mathematical chapters can be divided into four classes, with each class containing 

chapters of more
or less related topics. Descriptions of these classes follow.
Topics of traditional differential and integral calculus include derivatives, Taylor series, 

limits,
integrals, sums, and transforms.
Then we consider vectors and matrices; linear, polynomial, and transcendental equations; and 

global,
local, and classical optimization.
In interpolation we have the usual interpolating polynomial, a piecewise-calculated 

interpolating
polynomial, and splines. In approximation we distinguish the approximation of data and 

functions. For
the former, we can use the linear or nonlinear least-squares method, whereas for the latter 

we have, for
example, minimax approximation.
Mathematica solves differential equations both symbolically and numerically. We can solve 

first- and
higher-order equations, systems of equations, and initial and boundary value problems. For 

partial
differential equations, we show how some equations can be solved symbolically, how to handle 

series
solutions, and how to numerically solve problems with the method of lines or with the finite 

difference
method. Then we consider difference equations. For linear difference equations, we can 

possibly find a
solution in a closed form, but most nonlinear difference equations have to be investigated 

in other ways,
such as studying trajectories and forming bifurcation diagrams.
Lastly, we study probability and statistics. Mathematica contains information about most of 

the
well-known probability distributions. Simulation of various random phenomena (e.g., 

stochastic
processes) is done well with random numbers. Statistical topics include descriptive 

statistics, frequencies,
confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression, smoothing, and Bayesian statistics.
