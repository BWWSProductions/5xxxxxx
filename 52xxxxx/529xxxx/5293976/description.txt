Survivors (BBC)
Based on the original 1970s cult show, Survivors, the current series takes place in present day and has been re-imaged by writer Adrian Hodges. The drama focuses on the struggles of a small group who survive the aftermath of a devastating virus, one that wipes out most of the world's population.

Series two picks up moments after the conclusion of the first series. Abby has been taken to the Lab in an attempt to find a vaccine, based on her ability to survive initial infection. Meanwhile, the others scramble to find medical supplies to save Greg.
