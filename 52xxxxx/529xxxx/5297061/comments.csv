Don't care if it's not HD and missing a few seconds, as long as it's watchable unlike That Other File avaliable. :)
*hopes wednesday's episode will be avaliable soon too, hint hint*"
[V],err0001,2010-01-21T18:34Z,"One more thing included in this episode: very creative/weird animated ""explanation"" (from Hong Kong) of Jay Leno/Conan O'Brien situation."
,compno,2010-01-21T19:11Z,"Awesome, thanks for the smaller version and any more of this week's eps to come!"
,Lemberg,2010-01-21T19:16Z,"Thank.
You.
Very.
Much."
,Lemberg,2010-01-21T23:47Z,"Oh fuck, it's in the 4:3 format. Sides of the show are gone. I don't understand why it's shown like this anywhere? is someone chopping off the sides intentionally or by mistake? It's odd. And the 720p files don't work on my computer. Not even with VLC. Whap-whap."
[V],err0001,2010-01-22T00:19Z,"I taped a 4:3 broadcasted episode. Who cares about what is on the far left and right of the Tonight Show set?

Feel free to upload your own torrents and then let us critique your efforts!"
,Psylocke83,2010-01-22T02:17Z,"err0001, people always have to complain when the file isn't as perfect as they want it to be. :(
the video runs smoothly and that's all i care about so Thank You once again!!

Is there any chance you can tape & upload tonight's and especially tomorrow night's episodes? Got a feeling they won't be provided as avi's by the other provider(s) and I really need to see them.
It would be highly appreciated if you could do that! :)"
[V],err0001,2010-01-22T02:34Z,"Psylocke83,

I know, I know. Just sometimes ...

I've got last night's ep and assuming it is a decent copy, I'll upload in 5 or 6 hours (other stuff to do first). I fiddled the encoding a bit and it looks like the video quality is a bit better than this one

I'll also tape the remaining eps (in 4:3) in case the scene doesn't create 350MB avis and upload them on a timely basis."
,earlyre,2010-01-22T04:31Z,"i've got this ep recorded in hd  in .wtv & .dvr-ms
formats( windows media center recorded, both about 3.8 gigs,) but i lack both the software to edit the commercials out, and the upload bandwith to do an effective upload. 
darn DSL!!!

Suggestions anyone???
"
