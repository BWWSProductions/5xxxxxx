,dg3,2010-03-15T06:52Z,"If I try and save an image file through the windows version not dos it is incredibley slow. 20mb/MIN max. If I try to retrieve a saved image it says file is not a valid image file. I have another version of active@ disk image that is an app only, not a boot disk and that will save/ retrieve the saved files Aok. I dunno I think this is a dud for active disk image, the other programs may work? Any help here?"
