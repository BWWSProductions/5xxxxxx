,LLite,2010-01-22T12:02Z,"I did...I know you upploads god things, so its not you :)"
,kaitwoo,2010-01-23T19:07Z,"Sorry, as a total admirer of your excellent torrents, I tried this and every combination of key entry. Even birdmans theory didn`t work. Love to run this system, as the Eset security system you thought would run til mid March, has unfort expired. Have now resorted to Kasperspy secuity on a months trial, as you offer the keys. Would you recommend I run the keys now, or at the end of the trial? I am running this on win7, your excellent uload, so I don`t want to sound disresectful. Keep up the good work and I`m sure I`ll find a security system from you that works looong term. Cheers."

,VaKaDi,2010-02-12T12:25Z,"Hi kentucky-kid...
1st of all thank you for the support... Truth is instructions in torrent as not good as it can't lead you through the process.
I am having problems with the activation as well ...
I try to activate the product and it asks for ""installation code"" and e-mail.
--
1) I put code ""MHP1F4-46105287""  you given above (names and password are not asked and not work as code either)
2) I put e-mail shown on instructions
3) at the next screen i choose no (not an older customer)
4) I push next and it shows me error:""0006-0906"" and the message ""try gain later""...
PLEASE HELP!!!"
,Duurtje,2010-02-22T22:34Z,"Name: CCF229TFNH 
Pass: KK9F7C4W 
e-mail enot344@mail.ru

Doesn't work:
First of all you have to enter an activationcode,
then an e-mailaddress.

Next screen: Existing client:yes
Finally a clientnumber.

After that the system is contacting the Panda server and it ends in a fatal error.

So, my question is: what is the activationcode and what is the clientnumber.

I really don't know how to fix it."
,rst123,2010-03-02T14:54Z,"Hi im not new to this but i cant figure it out could somebody tell which code goes where because i've tried and failed 
I.e. 
Name: CCF229TFNH 
Pass: KK9F7C4W 
e-mail enot344@mail.ru

because it asks for codes and client number not name and pass Thank you Rst123"
,dusanrado,2010-03-02T15:41Z,"Hello, any news on this activation issue, I'm still waiting for some solution to this problem, thanks a lot!

,Deutscher_B5.5,2010-05-06T23:44Z,"I've been using this site for many years now, although I've gone through several accounts. I would think by now that if you were gracious enough to share with us, you could at least follow through by providing us with legitimate serials, keys, or whatever is needed for activation. Please try not to waste our time in the future. "
,vikkymaxx,2010-07-28T12:18Z,Serial not working we need a client id plz give us...Thanks
,JKorso,2010-11-11T12:02Z,"Can't activate the app...
