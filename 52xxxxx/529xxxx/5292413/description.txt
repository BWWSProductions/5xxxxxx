These are the ROMS files you need for using with Virtual-TI.

I know the other torrent on here for the Texas Instruments ROMS is not being seeded so I gathered up the ROMS I have and decided to share them for those who are looking for them.

Anyhow, the TI-92 ROM is in here.  So are the 85 and the 83 and some others.

They work fine with Virtual TI.

To use them just drop them in the Virtual TI root folder.

Ok, enjoy.

And by the way... please SEED these after you download them.  Nothing worse than getting stuck at 96.4% and never getting a file.
