I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

,uribelarreaj,2010-02-28T08:43Z,"http://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce, which i have used dozens of times before without a problem, is telling me that this torrent:

""Failure: Do NOT download this file. It is fake or virus.""

but at the same time i haven't seen any comments complaining about viruses or fake files.
i don't know what to think. did anyone else download this file? is it ok?"
