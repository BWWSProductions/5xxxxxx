This is the Unrated version so there's deleted scenes, special features and other scenes you didn't see in the theatrical version.

This is a DVD that I bought from my local HMV in Canada yesterday for $6, it's stripped of all Regional restrictions and copy protection.  Since its in a standard ISO format it can be burned on any blank DVD with any burning software program, or you can mount it in any computer (such as PowerISO)

Nothing has been stripped from this DVD...I don't to deprive people of those awesome special features to just have improve the video and audio that some people do (I don't see a difference anyway)...

Enjoy!!
