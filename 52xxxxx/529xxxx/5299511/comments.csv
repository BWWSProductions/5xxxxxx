As soon as copyright laws were invented all those creative types started making interesting stuff - just so they could earn shit loads of money!!!"

,krrazyps,2011-10-08T06:36Z,"wikipedia states that running time for Part 1 is 32 mins and Part 2 is 44 mins..
This torrent contains only 1 file with run time of 44 mins... So how is this part 1 AND 2?
Have you edited both films together into one?"
,butttfukirr9,2012-02-09T21:30Z,"I agree 100% that file sharing has opened up so many innovative ways to learn from what others are doing.

Imagine, 30 years ago if I wanted to share my VHS tape with my Uncle in Stockholm, I had to send it via Fed x at huge cost or USPS that could take weeks to get there.

This concept has the potential to take humanity to capabilities that otherwise might take centuries to achieve.

Besides, not everyone shares the same Neoliberal Capitalist view that 1/2 the human race are the only one's worthy of being able to enjoy a movie, a song, a documentary, which BTW is only because the other 1/2 who don't living on 2 dollars a day or less have been exploited of their natural resources in order that the 1st half can have the money to do so. What barbaric & primitive ideology of money & profit comes up with this deranged crap."

They probably lost only a couple thousand dollars to us, and they spend more on the lawyers trying to hunt us down."

Fight the Power."
