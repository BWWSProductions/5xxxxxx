Thanks for your help"

On your piratebay upload torrent page
goto --> Image tag from bayimg - - - click on the bayimg link which will open a new page.

Click the browse button to find your image on your computer.--you can search google images for what pictures you need
Goto --> Removal Code and enter a password [one that you will remember]
Goto --> Tags, I dont bother with tags 
Goto --> Settings and click on it. A sub menu opens. Click on Resize image, and highlight --> 300 x 300 TPB - Image Torrent

Now click UPLOAD

After a minute or less, your image will be uploaded.

Here is an example of what you should see

http://bayimg.com/oADpmaacI

all you need is the last 9 letters/numbers on the image [just copy them]

--> oADpmaacI

Now go back to your piratebay torrent upload page and paste in Image tag from bayimg box--->thats the 9 letters/numbers

When you have finished making your torrent and uploaded it, you should have a picture on your uploaded page.

hope thats helpful for you
any problems let me know :o)"

,ross13,2010-01-24T19:41Z,"hey dude,i had a problem with uploading the pic
it's saying ""Error: Database overloaded, try again in a little while."" even if i had tried it several times after a while"
[V],neon,2010-01-24T23:36Z,"ive never seen databaseoverload there...once your on the upload torrent page,click baying and the baying page comes up,then click browse and your computer documents come up on screen,go to where you have stored your pictures on the computer,double click the pic you want and it automatically goes into the slot next to browse button,put in a removal code,leave tags slot blank,click on settings to 300x300,click upload,you should see similar to this http://bayimg.com/LAJInAacO...copy last 9 digits,go back to upload page,paste the 9 digits into baying slot,and when you press save to upload your torrent a pic should appear
thats all i can tell you bud,once you get it its a piece of cake"
