Free were an English rock band, formed in London in 1968, best known for their signature song "All Right Now". Lead singer Paul Rodgers went on to become lead singer of the rock band Bad Company along with Simon Kirke on drums. Lead guitarist Paul Kossoff, a much revered blues-rock guitarist, died from a drug-induced heart failure at the age of 25 in 1976.

The band was famed for its sensational live shows and nonstop touring. However, early studio albums did not sell very well â€“ until the release of Fire and Water which featured the massive hit "All Right Now". This album brought them to full status as one of the top rock bands of the 1960sâ€“70s. The song helped secure them a place at the huge Isle of Wight Festival 1970 where they played to 600,000 people.

By the early '70s, Free was one of the biggest-selling British blues-rock groups; by the time the band dissolved in 1973, they had achieved an uncanny level of superstar success: selling more than 20 million albums around the world and had played more than 700 arena and festival concerts. "All Right Now," remains a rock staple, and has been entered into ASCAP's "One Million" airplay singles club.

Rolling Stone has referred to the band as "British hard rock pioneers".The magazine ranked Rodgers #55 in its list of the "100 Greatest Singers of All Time",while Kossoff was ranked #51 in its list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".
