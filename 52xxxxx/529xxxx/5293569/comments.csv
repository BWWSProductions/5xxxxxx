Tsk, tsk.

I'll pop back with a little review, but I'm pretty sure the quality will be good. I've seen Bone's work before, always been decent."
,PoshNinja,2010-01-24T20:07Z,"Oh! Right, almost forgot.. Great quality.
The video can be a bit grainy in some spots, but it's nothing that I haven't seen before, it definitely doesn't ruin anything.

The audio is pretty decent as well. No complaints here."
