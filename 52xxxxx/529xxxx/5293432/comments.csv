LOL!

Rars are standard for releasing for some reason, even though they don't make the file any smaller, since its already compressed into avi..


Thanks for this, still haven't seen it yet.."

,Nabarun,2010-01-21T01:20Z,"knockX2,
Sorry for sounding rude, but what you are saying is meaningless. You can get corrupted files from rap!dshare or even ftp, but not from torrent (unless the original file is bad). In torrents transfers, the file is transferred in tiny packets, which are further transferred in small pieces. Each of these pieces have hashes which are verified after each transfer. So, unless you are plagued by millions of viruses (in YOUR PC), even a TERRA BYTE long file won't be corrupt after a complete download.

RARs made sense for the scene which used ftp in the stone age. Some still do so for the... ahem... ""feel"". For p2p it is plain damn annoying. Just fragments the drive unnecessarily.

BTW, TvTEAM, thanks :)"

First watchable copy."
,Nabarun,2010-01-22T01:47Z,"knockX2,
I'm glad you understood. As far as your experience of ""being saved by rars"" is concerned, I can assure you that - even if it was a single, very large file, you wouldn't have any problem getting it right - provided the file was good in the first place, and that your side was good too. For bad connections, it is possible to get some ""failed hash checks"" and hence some (few MBs, no big deal) wasted bandwidth, time. There's also ""self-assumed-good-guys"" from international movie distribution giants who work relentlessly to screw our lives. In any case, UTORRENT will always re-download each corrupted piece from a ""legit"" peer, when it's necessary. It's how the bittorrent protocol works in the first place.  RAR files make sense when downloaded via a different source, such as FTP or a HTTP file hosting site. As a matter of fact, always prefer multi-part rars when getting stuff via non-torrent warez sites etc."
,rmontondo,2010-01-25T21:57Z,Quality? The reviews on this one is; watch it for the effects so bad A/V would kill it. RAR's are dumb.
,jh3141,2010-01-28T21:59Z,"Re RARs: while it's not exactly hard to uncompress them, I'm not going to keep them around after I've done it.  Therefore anything I download in RAR format is only going to get seeded to 100% and not beyond.  Sorry, if you want me to seed, put the file in a format that's not going to waste extra space on my hard disk.

That said: can anyone tell me whether this file has hard subs for the non-english scenes?"
,jh3141,2010-01-28T22:01Z,"knockX2: you know that if you have a torrent download that's been corrupted, you can tell your torrent client to redownload it to the same location it's already saved in, and it'll do a hash check and only download blocks that don't match the hash from the .torrent file?  At least, that's what uTorrent does, not sure about all others."
