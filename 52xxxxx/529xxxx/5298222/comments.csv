,Sr.Real,2010-01-22T23:06Z,I didn't see the complete movie yet but i skipped trough it and the video/audio quality seems good. Thanks for the upload.
,davidbisok,2010-05-10T01:48Z,Works perfect. Awesome film! Eye opening!
,xmassacre,2010-07-24T19:08Z,"tell you what zmacdaddy8, unrar it, pop it back online in uncompressed avi format using your own bandwidth for us all to share instead of bitching bout free stuff... mm k"
,cdlftw,2010-07-25T06:22Z,"This movie is full of propaganda.  However, these guys are doing alot of good for all the wrong reasons."
,dlldmn,2010-07-25T19:33Z,xmassacre: agreed. People need to stop bitching about rarred files and just enjoy the fact that they're getting it at all. Nobody's gonna waste that much bandwith for a bunch a whiny wankers.
,xenu678,2010-07-25T22:29Z,Pro-Global Warming propaganda... ignore it...
,c_programmer,2010-07-25T23:00Z,"The title of this movie is deceptive. It is not about the pranks they are doing, it is a anti-corporation environmentalist documentary that features pranks on businesses they don't like. I spent more time hearing their opinion on the environment and the evils of corporations than on the pranks. They are honestly not that funny.

If you like watching that type of propaganda, give it a watch because that is what this mainly consists of. But if you do not, just keep walking."
,Pink_Bob88,2010-07-27T09:49Z,Great film. Definately worth the watch.
,whakapai,2010-07-27T15:33Z,"Pro-Global warming propeganda?

I didn't see that.  It looked more like it was anti corporate profiteering from flushing hydro-carbons back in the sky.  Must watch again to see if they leave clues to speeding up global warming.

Propeganda?  Everything is propeganda.  Corporations are propeganda, governments are propeganda and this is proeganda, honstly what proganda do you wanna buy."
,McStroker,2010-07-27T16:12Z,"What do these guys think is going to happen to their right of free speech when they get their wish and central planning controls every aspect of their lives? Maybe they'll be the lucky ones who are among the first against the wall when the revolution comes. Carry on comrades! If you can't be a good example, be a terrible warning!"
,scothuman,2010-07-30T00:15Z,"@xmassacre, @dlldmn:  First off, RARs are a bitch, and VASTLY ILLOGICAL in this context.  Movies and other large files are generally split into chunks for Usenet so that one download going to shit doesn't bork an entire 700MB+ stream.  Torrents are already transferred in ""pieces"" (check that section of your beta BitTorrent client with the custom skin that is completely pointless, yet utterly 1337), and so it's not important if one peer fails to deliver a complete chunk.

Your claiming that this AVI in un-RARed form would waste bandwidth just proves how stupid you are.  When you downloaded and decompressed it, what happened?  Oh, that's right: The cumulative RAR file size of 713MB shot ALL THE WAY UP to ... 716MB.  That's because this (and just about all movies on here) are already compressed.  If WinRAR could really compress them much further, then you could be sure that WinRAR would be richer than a shitmonger on sloppy joe night.

I for one was glad that this was RARed so that I could waste all my HDD bandwidth decompressing it for 5 minutes rather than download that extra 3MB at 30mbps.  Damn, that extra 2 seconds or so of my life would have been a waste -- the WinRAR progress bar was so much more entertaining.

I suppose you must have a 28.8kbps modem, and so that 3MB is an additional eternity of waiting for you, huh?

Secondly, ""don't bitch about it because it's free"" is a completely dick-ass POV.  If we were just supposed to accept things being shitty simply because they were free, we'd all be downloading Chinese shaky cams with off-sync audio and watching it on a PIII-300 that we picked out of the garbage, whilst eating some bullshit that we picked off a tree on the way home from the hippie commune.  Also, the video would be encoded in RealMedia at 200kbps, and would have no seeders.

We, as a community, need some kind of standards (not *rules*, just standards), and when someone wastes our time with an obsolete, irrelevant, inappropriate,  ass-pointless, and sub-standard double compression of a file, we should call them out on it.

Do it well or don't do it at all."
,framk20,2010-07-30T05:09Z,"probably the greatest film ever
remember bhopal"
,mariannal,2010-11-24T14:50Z,tnx for your work
[T],Djofullinn,2010-11-27T18:34Z,"Seeds really well.

Rars arenÂ´t really a problem for me, perhaps a little nuisance. Great post by scothuman tho. Regards."
,fp98,2011-09-29T14:27Z,"Thank you for the movie
and don't forget to help fix the world!"
,butttfukirr9,2012-02-15T21:47Z,"Most people today have been subjected to ""Mfg. Consent"" and therefore have become transformed into ""authoritarian"" personality types found in any DSMVI manual psychiatrists use for diagnosis, but what that means in essence is that the oligarchial powers who created the formatted model of western civilization that is fueld by chep oil which transcends every thing humanity does across the planet is on its face, a finite resource.

 Given the billions of barrels we use very day, & the Asian pop. following our cheap energy model , means the entire global infrastructure that accommodates the use of this oil in how we live, will not accommodate any other cheap energy source that can meet the energy needs of what everyone uses now-because there isn't any. Biofules, ethanol, & hydrogen especially-imagine crash testing automobiles with a tank of that cannot be produced without using some other source of energy to make it. And what's that-Oil!

Every reputable scientist I have written to, including Professor Lovelock will tell you, there is no other energy source we can pull off the shelf when the oil is gone that can meet the entire energy needs of the planet. We'll have over a billion automobiles alone parked when the decline of peak oil begins its decent along the bell curve. The sooner you face reality that your current lifestyle is unsustainable and begin adapting & preparing for it now the lesser the impact for survival. MAD MAX made back some 40 years ago was a movie 50 years ahead of it's time depicting gangs of motorcyclists & roving car gangs killing everyone in the way to get gas to survive.

If you can't figure the arithmetic using exponential function on that much, then you'll die just like the rest of the ignorant fucks who deserve it anyway for not having done anything to turn it around when it needed to. You reap what you sow Motherfucker."
