Place of Skulls - With Vision (2003)


Place of Skulls second full album release.

None other than Scott "Wino" Weinrich appeares on this doom classic.

Obviously for fans of Candlemass, Saint Vitus, The Obsessed, Trouble and the likes...

Doom is the most underrated sub-genre in the rock/metal spectrum, so more than ever i'd like to say:
