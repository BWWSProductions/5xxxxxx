[V],thethingy,2010-01-24T04:05Z,"hello there, try uninstalling with the tool in the torrent then running ccleaner to clear the registry, seems like your installation is corrupt, adobe are crap for installing and uninstalling."
,ki59sr4,2010-01-27T18:35Z,"Hi, and thanks for your good work.
No problems downloading and extrakting, but
when I, according to step 4, open the activation blocker there is no host file. There is only a message saying hit any key to continue. When I do so, the window closes. What should I do?"
,forestbayer,2010-01-28T01:08Z,"I need to re-download, since something messed up the adobe acrobate.  All I can say is you do know your stuff and not afraid to get back to people who really are stressed with detail ways of correcting the problem...Anyway, I only choose to download from you.  I would put you up there hirer than Shadyman and couple of the others.  Keep up the great work and thank you"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-28T05:13Z,"ki59sr4, press any key to continue means finished, go to your host file at;
C: windows system32 drivers etc
open it with notepad and check it has added the entries.

[V],thethingy,2010-01-28T05:27Z,"forestbayer, thanks, what acrobat were u using?"
,forestbayer,2010-01-28T23:30Z,"9.2 

I haven't upgraded to the 9.3 yet....Since, I had to do some major clean-up from uninstalling old adobe programs.  I could not use the Adobe clean-up or the Windows clean-up tools to clean up the old adobe programs.  I don't understand why?  I used this tool in the past with no  problems.  When the program installs, I am asked English or Japanese and then after my response it quits...Strange....Then right after,  I suffered problems with my Office Professional Program...

Anyway, u keep up the good work for all! Thx

Anyway, so I am using ""Force Uninstall"" and the CCLeaner.  Now, I will be installing some more programs hopefully with success...."

TheThingy,
Thank you for taking the time and making programs like this accessible to those who just want to learn. If I were to use this in a professional/commercial setting then I would not have a problem paying for it.

Thank you again.

I'm now tracking your RSS Feed."
,jchester,2010-03-26T02:28Z,"thethingy...you are awesome.  Just one more question.  Which application loads LiveCycle.  I loaded Fireworks, Illustrator, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Lightroom and Indesign.  But somehow LiveCyle Designer starts then says it encounter a problem and asks to send a dump to microsoft.  I want to reinstall it but dont know which application loaded it.  Any suggestions?
Thanks for all your help!"
[V],thethingy,2010-03-26T14:55Z,"jchester, let it send the dump file, windows will then give you the soloution, most probabily its a conflicting ms app"
,jchester,2010-03-27T11:21Z,"thethingy --- You were right, I let it send the dump and clicked on the more info links. It told me that I had uninstalled Visual Studio 2005 and that Visual Studio 2008 was conflicting.  Then pointed me to a Microsoft patch to make it work.  Installed the patch and LiveCycle took off like a sprinter.  Once again...You Da Man!!!"
,fuzzyfelt30,2010-04-26T18:00Z,"Hi I downloaded this about a month ago and it worked wonderfully, today I tried to open it up and it came up for registration and then wouldn't open at all.

,isexy4u,2010-05-12T13:43Z,"Is there anyway to install only Indesign?  I already have Adobe CS4 Suite (downloaded sometime last yr from adobe website using masteruploader torrent) and Adobe Lightroom (downloaded a few days ago from thethingy).  I don't want to mess up what is already installed or have to reinstall.  I just want to add Indesign as a program.  I am not sure whether to use the serial I already have for Adobe CS4, alter the host file and use serial in the txt file, or run a serial crack!  Help.  It took a long time to install Adobe CS4 and I really don't want to uninstall and install that again.. big program!"

I have the same problem that when I try to edit the hosts file it won't let me save. I tried to open the http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5323279 link you said to try but it doesn't exist anymore! Please please help! 

Thanks so much :)  "
,bouncybob,2010-11-11T04:05Z,"Thanks for the torrent and the clear instructions. However, when I use the windows cleanup tool (I have some old apps installed like Air and Premiere) it lists nearly every program on my machine and there is option to only select a couple. I am not going to run it if it uninstalls 60 programs! I just want to remove the couple of old Adobe ones. Any thoughts? Thanks!!!!"

,fouzzman,2010-12-09T16:25Z,"Hello thethingy,
I have the same problem than aimee_b_4 , I can't save the hosts file. So I just strated using InDesign yesterday and it was working. But today, it's does not. It says ""Licensing for this product has stopped working"" Error 130:3. It also says that I have to restart the computer, and I did, but it changes nothing. Help me please! Thanks a lot."
,awthum,2011-01-13T07:15Z,"Hey thingy thanks for the torrent and all, but I made a mistake. I forgot to do Step 9 part 3 and now i get an error whenever i open indesign that says ""licensing for this product has stopped working"". what can i do to fix this?"
,gshorey,2011-10-05T11:06Z,"@thethingy, thanks for all the great uploads. I have a slight problem. I'm getting an AMT error 130:3. Your post mentioned something about not modifying the host file propoerly. I've done that but when I installed Photoshop CS5 (also from you) I had to change the host file again as per the PS installation instructions. Would that have caused the error? Can you please help. I was working on a very important personal project and i can't access my files at all. Thanks again for the great ups."
