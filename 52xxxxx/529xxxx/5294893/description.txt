STV -BOM N/A

Walter Weed is an unassuming desk jockey at the FBI when the Bureau
uncovers a plot to assassinate him...

2pass x264 @ 5593 kbps
English 5.1 DTS + English and Romanian Subtitles

NOTE
This is the unrated version from the disc. Why they even include the
rated on a stv disc is beyond me.

Loved the first, plus Vinnie makes my nips hard.

Enjoy :)
