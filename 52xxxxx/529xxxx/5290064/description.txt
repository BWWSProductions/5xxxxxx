Most modern hard rock bands miss the mark by over-emphasizing great riffs and neglecting the importance of complementary vocals. Luckily, such is not the case with Staind, who owe some nods to Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst for career guidance. Durst encouraged vocalist Aaron Lewis to sing more and scream less, which proved to be a key factor in the band's development. The appeal of Staind lies in the purity and fierce emotional integrity of their music, traits seldom seen in heavy rock since Suicidal Tendencies and Pantera ruled the roost.

Lewis's moonlighting as a solo acoustic performer in the band's lean years serves Staind well as BREAK THE CYCLE boasts a well balanced set of thrashy material ("Open Your Eyes" and "Safe Place") offset by more gentle rock ballads ("Fade" and "Suffer"). It is the impact of those ballads that sets Staind apart from their new-metal brethren. The radio-bound "It's Been Awhile" and full-band treatment of "Outside" strike universal chords, effectively capturing the bitterness of regret and facing reality with brooding hopefulness.

Multi-platinum 2001 album includes the smash 'It's Been Awhile' & the studio version of 'Outside'. 13 tracks. Flip/Elektra.
