Info:

A Newbery Honor Book, as well as an ALA Notable Book, The Cricket in Times Square has become a favorite with readers across the world. Comfortably snuggled beside the remnants of a liverwurst sandwich, Chester Cricket fell asleep in the picnic basket. When he leaps out of the basket he is far from his Connecticut meadow home, in the middle of the Times Square subway station in New York City. Making friends with the street-wise mouse; a tomcat with a soft-spot for opera; and a small boy named Mario; Chester discovers a talent hidden deep inside him. Just maybe this little country cricket can teach these tough New Yorkers a thing or two. When it was first published The Cricket in Times Square, Seldenâ€™s most famous book, was the first animal fantasy story to take place exclusively in the city. Now considered a classic, this whimsical story about the friendship between a cat, a mouse and a cricket has been read and loved by several generations.
