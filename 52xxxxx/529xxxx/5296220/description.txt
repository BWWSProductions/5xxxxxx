Batman: Year Two is the title of a four part story arc featuring Batman written by Mike W. Barr and illustrated by Alan Davis, Paul Neary, Alfredo Alcala, Mark Farmer and Todd McFarlane. It originally appeared in the American comic book Detective Comics #575-578, published by DC Comics.

Batman by now is an established vigilante in Gotham City. Captain Gordon has recently succeeded Loeb as Police Commissioner, and is addressing local media stations on his new stature. Then on the anniversary of the final sighting of Gotham's first vigilante, The Reaper, he reappears and starts dishing out his own brand of justice.

Also included is the one-shot sequel, Batman: Full Circle, also written by Barr, and illustrated by Alan Davis. It was set many years later, and centered on the son of Joe Chill assuming the mantle of The Reaper. The story reunited most of the cast of Year Two and incorporated Robin into the story.
