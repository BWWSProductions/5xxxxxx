Johnny (played by Sikandar Agarwal), 
the title character is a migrant kid 
who makes his living in Mumbai serving 
chai. His daily routine brings him closer 
to a few of his customers â€“ a drug 
addict, Vishal (Karan Nath), a model
/ actor, Preeti (Soha Ali Khan) and 
Parvez (Neil Nitin Mukesh). Johnny 
hopes that someday one of his 
customers would help him find a 
better life and facilitate his goal 
to work in Dubai. Sudhir wastes no time 
in providing rich topographical details of 
Mumbai, exposing the vagaries of a city 
fractured by the socio-economic class system.
