,minalsuri,2010-01-21T11:51Z,xrg please add a short sample video in the folder of the movie...ur print is always good there is no doubt but if u add a sample video it will really help us..thanx....
,zameer86,2010-01-21T12:36Z,hey xRG plz rip your movies in divx format as u rip before. 
,sumeshbar,2010-01-21T13:28Z,upload better print
,swexpert,2010-01-25T14:33Z,"I'm afraid this torrent has slightly diminished xRG's reputation. Nevertheless, I am sure it will be restored soon. 

This is a cam rip
A/V=6/6
Movie truncated at some points(probably due to interruptions in cam).

Better to wait for a better release, maybe an H264 one, as xRG usually does.

SG"
,swexpert,2010-01-25T14:34Z,"I couldnt edit post, so a new one. I meant x264 above. The title does say x264 but it does not match with the usual x264 quality.

Its all On Source"

,Dragonite_9,2010-12-08T03:20Z,"For you interested in this great movie, here is a torrent I'm seeding.
It's the best torrent you could find, I have compared them all, and it's not perfect, but it has the best sound and best picture too:

Enjoy!

PS. Took me forever to get a descent copy, so after going through over 50 torrent sites, I finaly found a copy with 1 seeder, and took forever to get it home, so now I changed it a bit and uploaded it here, with ~ 5Mbit/s line, because I want to share this great movie, a version that accually is possible to whatch, without any out of sync Subs (as Vomit's version has). Thanks to the from beginning whoever posted the source that the BDRip is made from, here is it, seeding as much as I can!
