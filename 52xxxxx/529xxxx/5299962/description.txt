Coup De Torchon (1981)

An inspired rendering of Jim Thompson's pulp novel "Pop. 1280".

Bertrand Tavernier deftly transplants the story of an inept police chief and his mistress (and his wife and her lover) from the American South to French West Africa. 


1938, in a French african colony. Lucien Cordier is the cop of this village, populated with blacks and a few whites (usually racialist and lustful). He is a washout, everyone (including his wife Huguette) humiliates him. He never arrests anyone and looks at elsewhere when a dirty trick occurs. But one day, he turns into a machiavellian exterminating angel.

This was an NTSC format DVD - I don't know if that is carried forward to the ripped (AVI) version. It certainly plays on my PC.
