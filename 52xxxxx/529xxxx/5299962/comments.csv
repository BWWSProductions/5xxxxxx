First heard of this from NYTimes 5/6/2010:

""...the Frenchman Bertrand Tavernier?s 1981 film 
?Coup de Torchon,? an adaptation of the novel ?Pop. 1280,? 
which many people, consider by far the greatest of the Thompson 
movies. Now Michael Winterbottom, another 
Englishman, hopes to join the list with his new 
version of ?The Killer Inside Me,? which stars 
Casey Affleck, Jessica Alba and Kate Hudson 
and opens in theaters on June 18. 2010"""

*By the bye, have you seen Ferreri's 'La Grande Bouffe' (1973)? "
