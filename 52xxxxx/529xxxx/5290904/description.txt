Probably the most well known canadian death metal band aside from Cryptopsy. Persistent and hard working, slowly changed their style from brutal, technical and a bit chaotic music to rather mid-paced, melodic and full of groove. One way or another, they kept their albums highly enjoyable and quite original. Good quality, covers included.
