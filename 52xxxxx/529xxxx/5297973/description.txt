MD.45 was Dave Mustaine (from Megadeth) and Lee Ving's (from Fear, an LA punk-rock band) side-project.

To get the strange name that the project went by, Mustaine and Ving each reversed their intitial's to form one part of the band name (Dave Mustaine's reversed are MD and Lee Ving's are VL which is 45 in Roman numerals giving us the name MD.45).

A remastered version of the album was released in 2004 where Dave Mustaine re-sung the vocal parts himself.
