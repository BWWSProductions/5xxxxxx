,sli1que,2010-01-29T00:25Z,I am trying to install on my Mac into crossover 8. Install script just dies and says see adobe support. Any other settings that I need to do before I start the install? I am putting this into a winxp bottle
,sli1que,2010-01-29T00:56Z,Looks like the issue just maybe with crossover. I can install on VMWARE Fusion.

,racerjim67,2010-02-06T21:04Z,"Hey all, I guess you could compare me to the village idiot, but I need some help. I downloaded this dreamweaver CS4 and am going through the instructions and when I modify the hosts file I need to do it through notepad but it wont allow m to save it as notepad, what do I save it as? Later I need to replace the existing adobelm.dll file with the included but I only have adobelm_libfnp.dll is this the correct file? help please!!!"
[V],thethingy,2010-02-06T23:30Z,"your not going through the readme for this one, this torrent does not use the adobelm.dll. "
[V],thethingy,2010-02-06T23:39Z,"racerjim67, that last comment was ment for another post, host file info is here;
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5323279
adobelm_libfnp.dll is a diferant file, go tothe locationspecified and youll see the file, if you cant find it highlight the address and paste it into the address bar of explorer and youll go straight there."
,horrorkitten,2010-02-08T02:49Z,"So I'm having the same problem that racerjim67 is having. It will not let me save the modified hosts file. 
I opened it in note pad and everything but when I went to go save it it said I didn't have permission of the administrator and asked me if I wanted to save it in documents instead. What am I doing wrong?
Also when I start up the program it gives me an error message and shuts it down. Is that because I was unable to modify the hosts file?
Hope you can help. Thanks."
,longgonefishin,2010-02-08T05:41Z,"In the Activation & Instruction directory after extraction there is a file called Instructions.txt.

Step 6 refers to the AdobeLM.dll which you say in your comments is not used in this torrent but is mention in the instructions. Do we have the wrong instructions?

Step 7 refers to the updates folder to install all of the updates in the numbered order? Where is this meant to be as it isn't in the extract?"
,Fisalidas,2010-02-08T23:31Z,Nice Jobs ! Like !! :D :D
[V],thethingy,2010-02-09T00:04Z,"horrorkitten, yes it wont work if your hosts is not set, use this one;

[V],thethingy,2010-02-09T00:07Z,"longgonefishin, that comment u r refering to was posted in the wrong torrent, the next comment does say that.
you have the right instructions for this, the updates are extracted with the rest of the stuff in the updates folder."
,dannzio,2010-02-10T18:46Z,"When i try to install update 4 creativeserviceinfrastructure1

,mnm1235,2010-02-26T18:32Z,"So i have a bit of a problem. 
I downloaded the file and everything went smoothly until it came to the updates. 
It seems that I can't update the file under folder:
4 creativeservicesinfrastructure1
as it does not contain Adobe drive CS4 1.0.1 and Adobe drive CS4 x64 1.0.1. So it does not allow me to continue with the installation. However the other folders in the directory: updates installed seamlessly.

Please do advice me on the next step.
Is it absolutely necessary to install the adobe drive extension as i don't need for it to connect to the version cue server. 

Please reply as soon as possible. 
Thanks"
[V],thethingy,2010-02-26T19:47Z,"its not really required to install any updates, buy they should all work, one of them is only for 32 or 64 bit so wont install on some pc's but i cant remember what one it is, if your on xp try the restart and retry method, or in the toolkit there are instructions for failed installs if its bugging you and you want it installed;

,jaynaidoo,2010-03-06T20:18Z,"im having a problem with this.
you say to go to C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc and open the ""hosts"" file, and i do that but, i try to copy the infor that you give in there, and i cant save it, so nothing changes.
ive done everything else, but when i start it this appears:

'Licensing for this product has stopped working'
""This product has encountered a problem that requires you to restart your computer before it can be launched.
If you continue to see this message after restarting your computer, please contact your IT department or adobe for assistance.

I have obviously restarted so im sure the problem comes with the step going to the host file.

Please advise me what to do.
Thank you"

But to idiot proof your instructions you have to change permissions on the host file before you can write to it.
