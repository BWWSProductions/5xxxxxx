FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOGLE SKETCH UP IS ALL ABOUT... 

It is a sketch-based 3D-modeling program which offers a suite of powerful drawing tools that add an intuitiveness many design programs fail to achieve. On first impression, Google SketchUp may look like it sacrificed function for simplicity, but that's not the case. Despite the extremely user-friendly interface, SketchUp offers a suite of powerful 3D-drawing tools that let you experiment and play with new designs.
