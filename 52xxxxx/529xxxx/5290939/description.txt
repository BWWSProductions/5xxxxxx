    Bitterly divided by politics and religion for centuries    
    this is the infamous story of how Scotland and England    
    came together in 1707 to form Great Britain. Over time   
    the Union matured into one of the longest in European     
    history, but it very nearly ended in divorce.              
    Exploiting the Union's unpopularity, the exiled Stuarts   
    staged several comebacks, selling themselves as a        
    credible and liberal alternative to the Hanoverian        
    regime. Neil Oliver reveals just how close they came to    
    succeeding.
