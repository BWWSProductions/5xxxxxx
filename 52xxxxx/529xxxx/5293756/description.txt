"Furry art is quite frequently amateurish and focuses on bizarre sex acts and interspecies mating. Often characterized by a tenuous grasp of anatomy. There are a few professional artists squandering their talent by drawing fox-cat-goat women having sex with horse-men with several penises."
 -- Encyclopedia Dramatica, Furry art
