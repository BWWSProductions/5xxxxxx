,timb1234,2011-02-06T07:19Z,"If someone can explain the point of this movie to me that would be great. Five different cab drivers in five different cities. So fuckin' what. I just told you the whole plot right there; if you're still interested, then go on and download away. 

Granted, I don't like the Hollywood bullshit, but I do like to get something out of an hour and a half of my time. I really got nothing out of this film. "
,yobar23,2011-11-19T23:12Z,"Thanks, LT!  This movie rocks!  timb1234 is clueless.  5 human stories in 5 world cities all occurring at the same time.  The Rome taxi ride had me laughing to tears.  My appreciation of pumpkins has risen!"
