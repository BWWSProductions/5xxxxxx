2010 stand-alone single disc release that contains all the bonus tracks featured on the second disc of the Deluxe Edition release of this album (ie: does NOT contain the original album, only the rarities associated with that release). Perfect for collectors who may have missed the double disc version or for those who are in search of all the great tracks that were initially exclusive to the Deluxe Edition. Marvin Gaye's What's Going On was the masterpiece which forever changed the sound and subject matter of black and Pop music, This rarities edition includes a live version of the album, recorded at a 1972 Kennedy Center concert, the original singles versions of 'What's Going On,' 'God Is Love,' and 'Sad Tomorrows,' along with 'Head Title,' a previously unreleased tune recorded when Motown initially rejected the 'What's Going On' single, redeveloped later as Gaye's hit 'Distant Lover' for the Let's Get It On album.
