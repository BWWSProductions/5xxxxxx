TOXOR MINIMAL COMPILATION

The following compilation is made by me, 4 ALL those Minimal-Like Fans, who are familiar with this stuff and are ready to be kicked by the huuuge dose of bass kickin' ass from the speakers. So I recommend to listen on at least medium-powered sound system with sub-kikker to provide the full range of the low frequencies - makin' the experience more delightful... believe me, the neighbours love when it makes a "lil' earthquake" on da block... ;D
