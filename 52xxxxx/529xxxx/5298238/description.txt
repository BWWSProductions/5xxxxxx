           In 1936, the Wollners - a German family living in rural        
           Town Creek, Maryland - are contacted by the Third Reich        
           to host a visiting scholar, Professor Richard Wirth. In        
           need of money, they accept Wirth into their home. Wirth's      
           grand occult project seals the Wollners off from the rest      
           of the world and makes them players in a horrifying game       
           of survival. After 71 years, in 2007, Evan Marshall's          
           life has stalled at twenty-five years old. Left without        
           answers after his older brother Victor's disappearance         
           from a camping trip near Town Creek, he has tried to move      
           on. But when Victor returns one night, very much alive         
           and having escaped his captors, Evan asks no questions -       
           at his brother's request, he loads their rifles, packs up      
           their boat and follows him back to Town Creek on a             
           mission of revenge that will test them in every possible       
           way...
