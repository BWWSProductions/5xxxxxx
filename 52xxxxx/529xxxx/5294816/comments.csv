,M4lvaD0,2010-01-22T10:44Z,"The Fix works fine, thanks for the upload!"
,AzertyCed,2010-02-02T21:46Z,"For those who hadn't used the fix BEFORE installing the game :

extract zip.exe (the fixed one), data2.zip and make a bat file with these 2 lines :

zip.exe x -y data2.zip >nul
del /F /Q data2.zip >nul

So you don't need to reinstall all the game. ;-)"
