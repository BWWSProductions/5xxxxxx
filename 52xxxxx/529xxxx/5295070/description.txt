"Tokyo Tapes" was Scorpions' first live album, recorded at Sun Plaza Hall (Tokyo, Japan) on April 24 and 27, during the band's Japanese tour in 1978. About the gigs in Land of the Rising Sun vocalist Klaus Meine said: The screaming and shouting was incredible. It was total star-cult.

These shows were guitarist Uli Jon Roth's last performances with the band. He had announced his departure after the release of the preceding album "Taken by Force" and bid an impressive farewell with "Tokyo Tapes".

"Tokyo Tapes" includes songs from all Scorpions' albums, released before 1978. The group delivering brilliant versions of hits like "In Trance", "Pictured Life", "Speedy's Coming", "He's a Woman - She's a Man" or "We'll Burn the Sky" and new song "All Night Long", which wasn't release on any Scorps' studio album.

The songs "Hell-Cat", "Catch Your Train" and the Japanese national anthem ("Kimi ga yo") were also performed during these shows but were not included in the official album. On the 2001 EMI re-mastered CD, "Polar Nights" was disappointingly omitted so as to fit a single CD, although it was included on the re-mastered version of "Taken by Force".
