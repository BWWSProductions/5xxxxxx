Brilliant, high-energy performance from the late 1970s.
Ripped from official CD release.
Audio quality is a bit below standard for the time, with some tape warble. Band sounds somewhat distant from the microphone.
Nevertheless, my favorite Hooker live recording.

Sorry for the VQF audio, but this was ripped in an era when VQF was a viable and state-of-the-art codec. I've included the Winamp VQF plugin for those without a VQF player.
