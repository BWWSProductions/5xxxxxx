Game information :

As Torek, a young Klingon warrior inducted into the prestigious Klingon Defense
Force Academy, you are instructed by General Chang the most esteemed living
Klingon warrior. There, you must learn the code of honor, battle tactics and
the rigors of warship command. Boasting rich graphics, new weapon systems,
tactically diverse environments and Interactive Space Terrain, Star Trek:
Klingon Academy is a true test of a warrior's spirit and endurance.

starboard, and aft) while your helmsman maneuvers your warship into position.

from the Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Tholian, and Gorn races as well as
