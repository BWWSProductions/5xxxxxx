A great book about the unknown and improbable. This is my first upload so constructive criticism would be appreciated to let me know what I'm doing wrong. Also, any comments on problems with the files would be great, this way I can fix them and re-upload the fixed version. I listened to the whole book and didn't hear any problems my self, but that doesn't mean there isn't any. Hope everybody enjoys the book.
