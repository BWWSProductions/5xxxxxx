,BoonesFerry,2010-01-19T23:54Z,Thanks for the up
,pg285,2010-01-20T00:30Z,"VLC ftw, thanks."
,gustafp,2010-01-22T02:12Z,"What in hell is wrong with you uploader???

Why in hell do you upload this show in small clips form??

Not worth it bad clusters of tiles in the files. Better waiting for someone to upload it in good quality or just goto  www.mtv.com and look at it in HDTV for free!"
,movietrailer,2010-01-22T06:07Z,"I appreciate what you've done here, but there's no fucking way I'm downloading it like this.

Why the hell is Episode 8 taking so long? Isn't ep 9 almost out now? I'd watch it on mtv.ca but I'd like to watch it on my tv. "
,john5246,2010-01-22T11:25Z,"Anyone else notice MTV is not releasing the latest episodes as soon as they air like they used to? 

Now you have to wait a few days for it to be available online."
,blankax,2010-01-23T10:51Z,"Oh shut up whiners, all you had to do is create a playlist with those files, took me like 10 seconds :/ Thanks buzzinhornets!"
,Kyle2k12,2010-01-24T00:20Z,"only download the following parts:

1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15
