,GayboyHAHA,2010-01-22T22:18Z,"Hi thanks for ths
I'd love it if you could upload it a little bit sooner!"
,JJammin1,2010-01-22T22:31Z,"Thanks.  Unfortunately, the encoding settings you are using are not compatible with Windows Media Center and most, if not all, standalone media players."
,aappleshampoo,2010-01-23T01:35Z,Thanks so much for this one and last week's! Any chance you'd release them in 720p also?
,deeteedub,2010-01-23T02:03Z,"Thanks for the upload!  BTW, I don't know why everyone else seems to be having issues with your encoding.  I don't have (and never have had) any playback problems with your uploads.  I use WMP and everything is perfect."

,sooners,2010-01-23T23:34Z,"Yeah, Autogk will solve all the audio & standalone dvd player issues."
,Panda229,2010-01-26T09:22Z,"Your audio encoding is a little screwy it's only putting out right channel audio. It's an easy fix in MPC though right click on the video go to audio>options then click ""enable custom channel mapping"" make sure speaker configuration is set for two input channels then in the grid that un grays itself in the front left and front right boxes make sure the boxes labeled 1 and 2 are checked then hit apply and your done "
