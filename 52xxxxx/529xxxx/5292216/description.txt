What We Made was the first studio album released by Example:. The album was initially due for release in June 2007, as stated on the back of the "We Didn't Invent The Remix" sleeve, however the album was delayed and was finally released on September 17 2007.

It includes the singles "You Can't Rap", "I Don't Want To" and "What We Made", all of which were released in the previous year. Though "I Don't Want To", "Birthday Card", "Today I Met Myself" and "So Many Roads" (another track previewed on his MySpace and live) feature samples of old songs, Example stated in a Metro interview that he does not want to be seen as a rapper who merely covers songs and thus will try to distance himself from simply doing covers and remixes after the success of his mixtape. The album is written and performed entirely by Example and Rusher though many tracks feature additional backing vocals. The track "Milk Your Goat", about spiking girls alcoholic drinks with diamond rings, features the vocals of Jixilix, "Me & Mandy" features the vocals of Darren Gallagher from indie band The Natives, whom Example met whilst on tour supporting The Rifles. "Posh Birds" features vocals from Tomi Adeosun, a schoolfriend of Example's from his days at ADT College.
