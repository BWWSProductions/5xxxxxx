Sent directly to video, the fourth installment in the Critters series picks up the action with Charlie (Don Keith Opper) about to destroy the last of the critter eggs. A holographic apparition warns him, however, that every species must be preserved by galactic law; the eggs are transported into deep space, and Charlie is accidentally carted along, beginning yet another freaky adventure.
