[T],hjsn1,2010-01-20T15:03Z,"Mordechai07: I did put here two weeks ago part 2 of Critters (Critters 2) but I can not be accused of not seeding because if you look at my list of torrents you will see a gap of 56 hours between Critters 2 and the next one I put up. My computer is on 24/7 uploading at 190 KB/s so you do the math. I seed every movie I upload til I see at least 20 seeds. In this case, just for you, I seeded it at least 4 times as long. Its not my fault that people don't seed back what they download. I have to get rid of movies every now and then to make room for new ones to be put up, therefore, I do not have this movie any longer to reseed it......

And by the way, to the 4 people I just saw seeding this movie earlier today, thanks."
