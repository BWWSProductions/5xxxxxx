Storyline: Nick Wells is ready to retire from crime. He'll settle down with his girlfriend Diane and focus on running his legitimate business: a Montreal jazz club. But Max, his fence, friend and financial partner, has other plans for him. Persuading Nick to violate two of his most important rules- always work alone and never operate in the city where you live -Max teams him up with Jack Teller. A young, aggressive and talented thief, Jack needs Nick's safe-cracking talents to make his first big score: a prize worth millions locked behind the walls of Montreal's Custom's House. It's a volatile combination in which egos clash and sparks fly, but the thrill of the heist has a grip on all three men, who won't give up no matter what the risk.
