On the record, Timbaland sings , instead of rap: "It's not like it's incredible singing, but it made sense for me and it fits my voice," he explained. "To get somebody else to sing it, it might sound too overdone. I like it better with mistakes : I make mistakes. With me singing it, it gives it a different kind of swagger to it".
