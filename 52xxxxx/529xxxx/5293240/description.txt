The continuing mystery and controversy over UFO-sightings and their explanations are explored in the second episode of a four-part mini-series. In 1947, what may have been an "alien spacecraft" appeared above a ranch in a remote part of New Mexico and is said to have exploded. Dozens of self-proclaimed eyewitnesses maintain that they saw a ship and its alien crew be recovered by the U.S. government. A recently discovered film supposedly shows autopsy proceedings on what appear to be "alien beings" at Roswell. More than 50 documented cases of alleged "flying saucer" crashes and retrievals have been reported. Formal, informal, official, and scientific investigations have often produced inconsistent or inconclusive results. This program examines persisting questions about puzzling bits of evidence and how they might be interpreted.
