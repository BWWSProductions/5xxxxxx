,zero0560,2010-05-15T23:13Z,"hopefully this helps, it helped me
""Mount the CD with Daemon tools or extract it on a folder. Go to Device Manager and see what device is unknown. Right click on that device and choose ""Update Driver Software"". A new window will appear and choose ""Browse my computer for driver software"". Next step is to browse for the mounted image or the folder where you extracted the image. """
