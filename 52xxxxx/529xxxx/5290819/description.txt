[1] Jessica tease.

[3] First complete performance.

Notes: This was the first solar-powered Phish show. Reba included Brazil and Popeye teases and was unfinished. Though last played on March 25, 1992 (291 shows) during a YEM vocal jam, this is the only complete performance of the sing-along Setting Sail. Ice featured a Page-led jam that was unlike most versions. Bowie included a full Jessica tease during the jam
