Based on the real events of The Donner Party tragedy. The
Donner Party was a group of California-bound American
settlers caught up in the western expansion of the 1840s.
After becoming snowbound in the Sierra Nevada during
the winter of 1846-1847, a number of the trapped settlers
joined together in a final effort to reach California and
organize a rescue party.
