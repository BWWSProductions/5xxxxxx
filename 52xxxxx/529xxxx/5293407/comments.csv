,deadheadtrea,2010-02-02T02:26Z,"They had Indian guides that tried to push them on and then stayed with them at what is now Donner Pass.  The Indians tried to lead them through the snow covered pass to help and they ended up on the menu in the mountains.  Very tragic.  There is a great episode of the PBS series ""The American Expreience"" about this."
