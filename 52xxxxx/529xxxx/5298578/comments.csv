I usually watch sailo rips, and all are fine, but the sound in this is very bad. 

Picture is good though, movie = NOT GOOD."

Ha Ha, the reference for good sound couldn't be worse. Are there any speakers at all in a Samsung 32"" ;-). "
,sunny2008,2010-03-08T13:27Z,"The picture quality could have been a little better if the directors commentary could be taken out. Hopefully in future rips, will be thankful. Cheers!"
,ohrton,2010-06-27T08:02Z,"The audio feels like its got more noise or something in it. That fuzz sometimes, feels like Im watching a TV show. Especially in the oval office with the girl brings in the newspaper. Its like fuzzz during quiet then the fuzz cuts down during dialog. Also in the camping tent scene the sound is fine while he is talking to the daughter then before he starts talking to the son FUZZZZZ. Same scene. Im using headphones. VLC. "
