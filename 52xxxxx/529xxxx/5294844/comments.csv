,GetHo,2010-02-04T06:03Z,Thank You!!! My first and favorite series from childhood years back again.
,Noodley,2010-08-09T15:10Z,"Are they all done by that same guy? 

I think I might prefer the abridged versions (2 cassettes) just because of the persons reading the previous ones did much MUCH better than this fellow. Doesn't put enough feeling into it in my opinion."
,ThreeHalves,2010-08-31T08:57Z,"Is anyone else having problems unzipping the .rars, they say something about being read only. Any advice?"
,jeekt,2010-09-07T02:47Z,These are great.  After hearing these (with his many voices) it's hard to listen to other books.  Thank you very much :)
,ThreeHalves,2010-09-09T03:54Z,"Never mind. Sorry. It was my stupid mistake, I hadn't reinstalled a rar program. These work just fine. Thanks for the great upload."
,harbonah,2010-11-12T05:39Z,does anyone have Bearers of the Black Staff?
,honunet,2010-12-08T05:18Z,"How does anybody know if they are abridged or unabridged?  The ONLY info we have is author, series name, and number of titles.  THats crazy.  Does TPB charge by word in the description box uploader?  I mean, don't get me wrong thank you very much for this effort I do appreciate it.  But really, just one more word will clear up so much mystery.  UN or Abridged.."

Torrent works perfectly. Downloaded @ 1.3MB/sec wich is max for me. Also it had nice sound quality and no viruses.

Also love the books. Worth reading(or listening to in this case) for anyone intrested in the fantasy genre.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannara for more info regarding the books/author.

Regards :)"

Is anyone else coming up blank on the ""Files"" section of their client/manager? I'm using UTorrent, if that makes a difference? Any help would be greatly appreciated."
,Rob93,2012-06-19T17:32Z,"Anyone else getting nothing in the ""Files"" page of their torrent manager/client? I'm running uTorrent, & I have got NOTHING in the Files section & I can't figure out why. Thanks for any help."
