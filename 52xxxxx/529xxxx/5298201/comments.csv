,Swamp_wateR,2010-07-05T04:42Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT.
the video quality is great but there is an odd popping and crackling in the audio.
BAD TORRENT."
,EvilMosquito,2011-01-20T06:27Z,You do know it's from 1973...popping and crackling? I don't think they had high def recording.

,xobelly,2011-08-28T09:52Z,english subtitle..
,enonumus,2012-02-08T11:53Z,"To suggest that it's normal to have popping and crackling noises in a movie less than 40 years old is ridiculous.  Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz were made over 70 years ago and they don't have loud popping and crackling.  The fact that this film was made in the 70's, a few years before Star Wars has nothing to do with it.  "
,pds2009,2012-03-06T17:25Z,thanx for this
,michaelrwatson,2012-04-04T22:11Z,"I believe there's popping and crackling--this ripper obviously doesn't know what he's doing. 776MB? Why not 699 so it's burnable to CD..? No answer? That's cause you don't know what you're doing. 

Really, you don't need more than 500-600MB with h264. You can get excellent quality in about 400MB. So, 776MB? No thx."
