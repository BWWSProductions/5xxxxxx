        What killed Australia's megabeasts?

        Long   after   the   extinction   of   the   dinosaurs,  other
        extraordinary species of giant  beasts roamed the earth-  they
        were the megafauna. In Australia  some of the most bizarre  to
        roam  the  earth  existed including  a  giant  wombat, a  huge
        kangaroo, a massive lizard and the earth's biggest  flightless
        bird. For hundreds of thousands of years these were the  heavy
        weight champions of the animal kingdom.

        But suddenly, inexplicably  they vanished. Something  happened
        which wiped them off the face of the planet forever.

        While  there  have  been  several  mass  extinctions  of large
        terrestrial   animals   throughout  history,   the   death  of
        Australia's megafauna is  relatively recent. It  occurred less
        than 60,000 years ago and no one knows why. It remains one  of
        the longest running and hotly argued debates in palaeontology.
        For decades scientific sleuths from around the world have been
        trying to solve the mystery.

        Now in a unique corner of the world, a team of top  scientists
        from around the world attempt  to crack one of sciences  most
        enduring mysteries - what  killed the megafauna in  Australia?
        Their discoveries could  not only help  solve the mystery  but
        also offer insight into environmental problems which  threaten
        the world and all life today.

        As  the  scientists  begin  their  quest  this   extraordinary
        prehistoric world is brought to life using the latest in  high
        quality 3D animation.
