Step 1)
Unzip the installer.

Step 2)
Create a new database for ikiClassifieds on your web server.

Step 3)
Open iconfig.php in your favorite text editor and fill in your database details.

Step 4)
Place the ikiClassifieds files in the desired location on your web server:
- If you want to integrate ikiClassifieds into the root of your domain (e.g. http://www.itechjunky.com/),
 move or upload all contents of the unzipped ikiClassifieds directory (but excluding the directory itself)
 into the root directory of your web server.
- If you want to have your ikiClassifieds installation in its own subdirectory on your web site
(e.g. http://example.com/blog/), rename the directory ikiclassifieds to the name you'd like the subdirectory to have
 and move or upload it to your web server. Then please update .htaccess and /admin/.htaccess as follow:
In .htaccess file, change from "RewriteBase /" to "RewriteBase /your_subfolder/"
In /admin/.htaccess file, change from "RewriteBase /admin" to "RewriteBase /your_subfolder/admin"

Step 5)
Change the following folders chmod mode to 777 so that they are writeable.
a) templates_c
b) images_upload
c) logs
d) /admin/templates_c
e) /admin/tmp
f) /admin/images_upload

Step 6)
For proper operation of the script, output buffering must be enabled.
- Go to your Cpanel and turn "output_buffering" On.
The procedure depends on your Cpanel. For instance with Hostgator Cpanels: click the "Php.ini Quickconfig" link. Next to "output_buffering" select "On". Some Cpanels don't have the "Php.ini Quickconfig" link. In this case you need to click a "PHP Config" icon and then a button to Install php.ini Master file. Then open php.ini file at the root of your server and turn "output_buffering" On.
- If you don't have Cpanel, check php.ini file at the root of your server. Turn "output_buffering" On.
- If you can't find php.ini, please contact your Host to request to turn "output_buffering" On.

Step 7)
Open the following link on browser to start install:
http://www.yourdomain.com/admin/install

If you are installing under subfolder:
http://www.yourdomain.com/subfolder/admin/install and follow the on screen instructions.

That's it! ikiCLassifieds should now be installed.
