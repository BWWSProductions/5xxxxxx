,S3nd41,2010-06-17T14:32Z,Maybe if you didn't compress this crap into .rars there would be any goddamn seeders. People just uncompress this and delete the original files on their disk.
,Saki33,2010-12-31T17:25Z,"Well, then, the problem is with the seeders, innit? They should be sharing the original files. I have uploaded some files of popular tv shows that weren't available. It wouldn't be long before there were many downloaders and I was sharing 100% of my up bandwidth. By the next morning there would be like about 20 seeders with 100% downloaded. By the end of the day there would be only two seeders left besides me. You could see them dropping like flies after they had gotten 100%. I have done this for several tv shows and it's always the same story. It just pissed me off and I stopped uploading. Too many ingrates. For myself I don't care if it's a rar or not as long as it's available, and I always share at least 100%, usually at least 200%. I normally don't remove a file until I see that there are many more seeders than leechers. The problem isn't rar files; it's the goddam ingrates."
