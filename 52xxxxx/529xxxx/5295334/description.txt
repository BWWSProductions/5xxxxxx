English subs are included but not embedded.  The subs are FULL English subs however.  Less than 1% of the movie is foreign language.  It isn't very much, just a few short scenes.  113 lines I believe, out of 1890.

If you feel like modifying the subs use Aegisub, best program I have seen for the task.

If you wish to embed the subs use Subler (mac only).  Open video with Subler, drag sub file into Subler, change sub language to English, save.

-----------------

Here are Partial English Subs you can use with this release.

You can embed both the full and partial subs using subler on Mac if you want them for your iPod or Apple TV, or quicktime, itunes, VLC, etc.

Make sure in Subler that you assign a unique name to each sub and set the language to English for both.
