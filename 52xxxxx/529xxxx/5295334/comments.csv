,binur,2010-02-08T22:45Z,"@eleni19

Any video can be played on a computer, provided you have the appropriate video and audio codecs installed in your system and your video player application support that particular file format (and obviously the required codecs).

Popular video codecs are Xvid, DivX, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MP4, M4V, H.264, WMV, AVC, etc.

Popular audio codecs (used in a video file) are AC-3, AAC, M4A, WMA, MP2, MP3, etc.

Popular video file formats (these are container files in a particular (compression) format that can accommodate one or more video and/or audio tracks that are encoded as per the above mentioned video/audio encodings in a single file) are AVI, MPG, MP4, VOB, M4V, MKV, ASF, 3GP, etc. and generally these file formats are specified in the file extension itself.

When it says PSP, iPod, Zune, etc. , it just means that the particular file is having the video and/or audio encodings and file format that can be identified by these devices. Generally for such hand-held devices, suitable video file formats use to be MP4, M4V, AVI, 3GP etc. with video encoded in H.264, MP4, M4V, Xvid, etc. and audio encoded in AC-3, AAC, M4A, etc. and the video resolution very much reduced to suit the screen size of these devices.

Surely these videos can be played on a computer, but the quality would be very less for a computer screen (as it's very big compared to an iPod or PSP screen) and so the file size.

VLC Player is said to be supporting most of the video/audio encodings and file formats."
