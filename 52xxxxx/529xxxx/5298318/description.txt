Clyde Allison aka ( William Henley Knowles ) James Bond parody For Your Sighs Only 1966 Ember Library

This book has all the usual William Knowles/Clyde Allison madness.  The story starts with a nude Alpine ski chase, which has to be my all time favorite opening to a novel.  The language in the book is hysterically overblown and the sex scenes are just intended to be silly.  There is a 4-5 page passage towards the beginning of the book where Agent 0008, Trevor Anderson, just deals with his female co-agents breasts.  Knowles had his own style in the vein of Terry Southern and some of the other post-beat writers of the â€˜60s, and it was really quite funny.

For an incredible biography of William Knowles by Mr. Lynn Monroe go about halfway down the following page.  The article is called William Knowles: The Life and Death of Clyde Allison.

I have to recommend the book Gorgonzola, Wonâ€™t You Please Come Home? Which Knowles wrote under the pen name Clyde Ames.  It was written for Lancer books and I get the feeling he was paid more for writing this one or he took more time because itâ€™s really the best of his spy parodys. I'll try to scan it sometime and upload it here.
