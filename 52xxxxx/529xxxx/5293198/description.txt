About File Juicer:

File Juicer doesn't care what type file you drop onto it, it searches the entire file. If it finds a JPEG, JP2, PNG, GIF, PDF, BMP, WMF, EMF, PICT, TIFF, Flash, Zip, HTML, WAV, AVI, MPG, MOV, WMV, MP3, AIFF, AU, MP4 or text file inside, it can save it to your desktop or to another folder you choose.

This means that it works not only on Safari's cache files, but also Internet Explorer, FireFox, Mozilla and OmniWeb. It also works on files made with the other applications in Microsoft Office.

You needn't enter an organization to register the program.

System Requirements:

MAC OS X.4.11 and up
