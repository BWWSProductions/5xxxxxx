,GMB863,2010-02-26T15:53Z,leave comments people! people lke to know that what there downloading is good or not....
,Berend.botje,2010-03-01T17:25Z,"Indeed
so much seeders (64)  and just two comments, "
,gatortail1248,2010-03-09T01:17Z,"Perhaps there are so few comments because the *actual* torrent's name is ""T-Racks Delux-Sonnox Oxford-Namd Blue Tube.zip.zip""
instead of what is stated in the title here. Strange discrepancy. You may want to make these names come into compliance, or explain the difference, as well as the extension ""zip.zip."" these are all red flags to downloaders.
Anyway thank you and I will try it. "
,hershe,2010-03-09T03:20Z,"I like being able to choose what plugins that I want, not one big old zip file"
,soad811,2010-03-21T06:42Z,"this is a collection of some of the most seeded VST's on TPB at the moment, nothing new"
,SD_303,2010-05-11T10:55Z,"@hershe

You say you like to be able to ""choose what plugins you want""??

Sorry I'm gonna go off on a long rant:

Ungrateful assholes like you on torrent sites  make me sick. People like GMB863 are taking time out of their busy lives to save YOU thousands of dollars you selfish fucking asshole.And all you can say is, ""gee I wish you'd spent many MORE hours uploading these 20 or 30 plugins individually instead of all at once because MY time is so valuable.""
Go fuck yourself.

The reason I'm so mad about this is because pro audio isn't some fucking little hobby to me. 
It's my income and livelihood. And it saves me the money I need for hardware and mastering.
Ethical or not I don't care in the current economy. I'll buy it later when I upgrade.

So uploads like this are invaluable to me and my business and if fuckers like you keep dissing the good uploaders, then nobody will upload these tools anymore because selfish assholes like you can only complain about getting FREE SHIT instead of just being grateful and saying, ""well I won't use it all but thanks for the stuff that I WILL use.""
fucking fucker

And thanks GMB863 from me.I really DO appreciate it."

,jmz93,2010-10-20T21:32Z,"Thanks for making this available. I'm taking Berklee's online mixing course right now and am curious to try some of these.  

I'm showing 6 seeders and one leecher ... but can't seem to download. what's up?  
I'll seed for awhile after I manage to get this, so others can still grab it.
But, first I need to be able to download..."
,iferhat,2010-11-02T06:56Z,thanks for this awsome work puting this together guys. ur all legends. 
,gaysexisfun,2010-11-05T20:20Z,"This was a great download. the oxford and wavearts plug-ins are really good. can't believe i haven't heard about them till now. really good update on the waves plug-ins too, considering i had the diamond bundle b4. I didn't install any of the antares stuff, am i missing out on anything. i don't use vocals. 
maybe i couldn't find it, but where's Izotope ozone?"
,Achmed2007,2010-11-14T16:19Z,"WOW - all the best on one platter.
You make the days really easy for many mastering pro out there.
THANKS"
,GMB863,2010-12-12T16:28Z,Thats what im talkin bout... Thx for the thx people i do it for yall!
,Oystersun,2011-02-13T17:20Z,"Hi guys, keygen.exe is infected by Trojan Generic17.BKHR according to AVG free. "
,kaderben,2011-03-10T07:42Z,Thanks; upload like you want ; I download it.
,sidsimon,2011-03-11T22:22Z,"I for one am grateful for all uploads. Thanks to the entire community! Keep doing what you're doing!! 
1000 thanks!"
,zionroad,2011-06-16T15:31Z,@SD_303: Amen bro people take things for granted i wish whoever made that comment would have to take their happy ass to go and actually buy each one of the plugins then you can get picky ungreatful bitch
,willyedz,2011-08-18T21:49Z,"Everything worked except for the T-Rack thing.

i opened fruity loops, refreshed my VST list and BAM, 303 new plugins found. thanks for a great upload. These plugins are GOLD!"
,FiZZ52,2012-01-19T13:18Z,Will these Work with Ableton ?
,p1zL3,2012-02-14T07:22Z,"@FiZZ52

Yeah, they should be Ableton Live compatible. There might be small issues sequencing them with other plugins or using them with MIDI-Tracks, but even the full-paid software would have a few flaws here and there.  "
,zeekmfa,2012-03-05T09:23Z,"Ok Here is how to innstall this:

1. Just install normally

2. Open Keygen.exe

3. Select the T-racks deluxe v3.x

4. And push generate

5. Then you get the serial number witch you enter when you open T-rack for the first time.

6. Then it asks you for authorization code

7. Now go back to the very first page(just push back back back)

8. Then push the upper option

9. Select to do this on same computer

10. Select that you are not a costumer(whatever)of IK multimedia.

11. then you will get 2 codes the first on is crap a the second one is the Digital id code HURRAY!

12. Copy the digital id code that you see there into the Keygen.exe Digital id filter and push generate.

13. Now you have everything you need just re-peat 2 3 4 5 and 6

thanks for flexx-sequence for writing this, although there is how to file in there, i guess most people miss cause it's not in the same folder."
