Genre: Action

Tom and Jerry: War of the Whiskers is a fighting game of sorts. It's even rated T for Teen due to its comic violence. Nevertheless, with cute characters like Tom the tomcat and his mouse pal/archenemy, Jerry, the game's target audience definitely isn't the same as the one flocking to the latest iterations of Tekken or Virtua Fighter.
