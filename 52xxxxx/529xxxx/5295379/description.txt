Created for CSE 335 at Michigan State University.

This appliance is a full Ubuntu 9.10 installation plus Eclipse (with Galileo), and Bouml, configured for development in CSE 335.

OVF 1.0 format.

Though it can be imported with any OVF-supporting VM software, it has the VirtualBox Guest Additions installed for VirtualBox hosts, so it will only work well under VirtualBox.

Configured with one user
username: cse335
password: class

UPDATE:
Eclipse will still need one more configuration option to be fully configured for use in CSE 335.
Go to Window -> Preferences -> C/C++ -> Code Style and select BSD/Allman from the drop-down.
