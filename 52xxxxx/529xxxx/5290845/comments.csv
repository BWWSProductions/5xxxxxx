,kevpirate,2010-01-24T13:08Z,"Hi. I love these films thank you.
I have a problem when making a dvd with vso convertx or winavi convert, as the film becomes jumpy. My cheap dvd player plays avi and most stuff you can throw at it, any advice as my family love your uploads......."
,kevpirate,2010-01-24T13:10Z,"Maybe any ideas for mp4  converter, I have tried lots but not much good so far."
[T],frankie-boy,2010-01-27T04:42Z,"Sorry you have trouble with the mp4 format. I have not tried it, but I think you could use Roxio Toast to create a DVD from an mp4 file. If you try it, let me know how it works.

I almost always just play movies from my computer, so I don't know too much about creating video-DVDs. Maybe that is a solution for you: you can usually figure a way to plug a laptop into a television to share the video."
