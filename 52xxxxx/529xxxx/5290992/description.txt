Following on from the hype surrounding his fascinating and exciting live
performances, Ben Darvill has produced an album of tremendous life, vigour
and effortless cool. In a genre often seen as somewhat dull and with very
little variation, 02 manages to bring South American Delta Blues to a
whole new fan base, and ultimately a whole new generation.

02 is filled with all the emotion you would expect from a traditional blues
record. You can feel the passion through every note of his harmonica, and
the groove seeps through with consummate ease. In this respect, Darvill
maintains all his roots in raw, low-down rhythm and blues.
