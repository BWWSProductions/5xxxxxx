Mobile phone ringtone from The Unit tv-series.
I captured it from S02E09 - Report by Exception, where Col Tom Ryan has conversation with his wife in the morning, approx. 30:04 in.
I removed also background noise between the "peeps".

Two files. One only with the sound, so you can make your own Unit ringtone and one with 1.6 second long silence added.
