F1 2009 delivers an authentic and accessible recreation of the 2009 Formula One season, including, for the first time in a Formula One title, the stunning Singapore night race. The first Formula One release on Wii, F1 2009 will offer a variety of race modes, including a full racing season and individual arcade-style challenges. Customizable driver aids will be offered to individual players, so both novice and expert drivers will be able to keep their car on track. In the game's multiplayer mode, driver aids will enable friends and families of different abilities to play together in wheel-to-wheel split screen co-operative and competitive multiplayer races. F1 2009 marks Lewis Hamilton's debut in a videogame and will enable players to take to the wheel of his McLaren MP4-24 Formula One car and battle to retain his FIA Formula One World Championship crown. The 2009 FIA Formula One World Championship promises to be one of the most exciting and closely fought, thanks to new regulations on aerodynamics, slick tires and the introduction of the KERS boost system, which is designed to aid overtaking.
