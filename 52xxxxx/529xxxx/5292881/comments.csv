,blackpath,2010-01-20T12:25Z,Trojan.Crypt-292 FOUND
,Munkoli,2010-01-29T20:59Z,"Well, I was worried after I read what blackpath said about the Trojan. So I downloaded a new Virus Scanner for both my mac and pc partitions and scanned the file. Nothing was found. So I tried an online Virus scanner. NOTHING. So I figured it was safe to try. I can 100% confirm this works and has no virus. It is a program based on what Djavdet found with Avid 4.0.2. It uses a windows .exe (which is where the suspicion naturally arises) to manually patch the SuperPro32 and AvidMediaComposer files that arrive pre-patched in the previous Medicine. Test it yourself. The Crypt Trojan isn't even a Mac Trojan, so no harm in downloading it. If you don't trust it, your loss. But take it from me, blackpath is either working for Avid or the torrent has been cleaned.

enjoy"
