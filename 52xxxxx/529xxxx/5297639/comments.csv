[T],keka_umans,2010-01-22T02:15Z,"Appreciate the attemp to share however i can't stress this enuff people..please read the how to upload section of the forum...... i show 0 seeds and over 100 leechers....Duke is correct you need to seed the file first or everyone stays @ 0.0%
Please seed or delete this waste of the piratebays space"
