,Pixelmari,2010-01-23T05:36Z,SEED ya'll this game is AWESOME!!!!
,RazorAim,2010-01-23T19:05Z,I could not find a serial. I wish Real Flight would just release a darn demo for G5 already!
[T],thenoobish,2010-01-23T19:45Z,"like it says in the description ""This does not have a serial or emu yet."""
,alex-rybakk,2010-01-26T22:14Z,do you have serial nr ? 
,RazorAim,2010-01-27T03:06Z,"I know, I read that, but I tried to find a serial online. I bought Phoenix RC instead. It seems better than ReaFlight G5 anyways."
,SandmannSchneil,2010-04-17T04:27Z,"Awesome Game xD

seed please "
,matzahbawllz,2010-04-24T22:40Z,"i tried to launch Realflight G5 using the launcher 
and i got an error...    

KEError 21051: Unknown Product Code
 can u plz help me ?"
,xiIix,2010-05-16T01:40Z,"For all intents and purposes Phoenix will serve you just fine, but the physics engine is not as advanced or robust as Realflight.

Also, guys, why not just use the ""upgrade"" file on the realflight site instead of trying to install G5 standalone? Might not work, but it's worth a try. If not, then we'll just wait for a real release to hit that has the emu and crack."

,_Stormy,2010-08-01T15:19Z,"emu V3.3 does not work with RealFlight G5

Neither could I locate the mentioned V3.4 anywhere.

Can someone confirm the latest emu available for G5 ?"
,capt.sam,2010-08-05T19:02Z,"i get an error ""no authorized interlink found.Make sure your interlink plus/inter link elite is plugged in and try again""
can any one please guide me how to run this game"
,xiIix,2010-08-09T01:52Z,"Damn, it's taken twee forever to do this new emulator. I hope he's in fact working on it, because he's the only one that does it in software. For now I guess it's back to 4.5"
,Green24,2010-08-30T08:30Z,"Hey all...

I DLed the torrent, mounted the ISO and am now stuck. The setup.exe keeps failing before it starts up. It seems like the installer is basically crashing before its getting a chance to launch. Anyone got any suggestions for making this work?"
,d12323,2010-09-07T05:59Z,Anyone going to seed expansion pack 7?
,leezaal40,2010-09-14T20:28Z,"Installs & runs fine, many thanks.
If you already have a valid realflight G4 controller & serial this G5 will work for you. G5 has some bugs though, sound effects cause the sim to stutter some times which is really annoying"
,red_oct,2010-09-25T20:13Z,"@leezaal40 Please tell us how did you make it work? I get this error: ""no authorized interlink found.Make sure your interlink plus/inter link elite is plugged in and try again"""
,richi3670,2010-10-03T19:03Z,can some one tell me how to install this?
,leezaal40,2010-10-20T01:50Z,UPDATE: Serials no longer work. box labelled OK to activate stays greyed out. Plus it tries to phone home to verify serials too now.
,gfburke,2010-11-02T17:12Z,"hehe.

,jeffb,2011-01-14T14:39Z,"Thereâ€™s a cheap hardware solution for a missing Interlink dongle/controller:

USB 2.0 Almighty Flight Simulator Dongle

It plugs between the trainer port of your transmitter and your USB port, and has a 4-position switch which lets you select between RealFlight G4/G5, AeroFly, PhoenixRC, and XTR dongle modes.

It actually comes with 2 discs in the box: DVD 1 contains installers for the full versions of PhoenixRC, Reflex XTR, AeroFly Deluxe. DVD 2 contains the installer for RealFlight G5 and a crack so you donâ€™t have to register in order to use it. :)"
