My specs are as follows...AMD Athlon 64 dual core at 3.2 Ghz, 4gigs of PC800 RAM 8800GT 512 meg video Like I said it runs beautifully until I get to that part where the two characters are separated by a boulder then it crashes. Hope you can get an updated crack or something. Thanks... "

[V],Shroo,2010-01-22T23:24Z,"Hey, guys the game does work i have tested it on several machines. So here are simple solutions that may help you, 1. Download latest 7z or latest winrar 2. Rename our archive to a simple name 3. Extract the game 4. find reg.exe and run it as an administrator 5. Update all drivers like GFx card, physx, games for windows live 6. make sure you extract the game some where in a short location like c:/DARK VOID 

Hope it helps."

,mleene,2010-02-08T06:43Z,nothing happens when i start from the launcher....tried updating everything. still nothing happens..........is there any fix for this?
,brodazunino,2010-02-09T01:42Z,"knight

1. I think my computer comfiguration have no problens to run this game setting everything in HiGH

2. This is a full game, just a compressed mode, but after extrac the files (setup.bat) you will have same size as original

3. Did you buy your game?

TPTB continue doing your great job ripping all the greatest games

unfortunately, this one did not work in my machine

PS: Sorry for my Bad english"

I click the laucher adn that's ok. then when i clik Lauch dark voi, under language option, it says the exe file has problem.. that same old thing several guys replied before.
I've already tried ALL the advices from the comments pages, including yours.. nothing worked.
the only thing i couldn't use was the noDVD fix that some guy posted some comments before, because i couldn't figure ou what to do with it, since it's in russian language...
