,capthightop,2010-01-28T19:49Z,what the hell? you uploaded this great compilation then did'nt seed! SEED THIS JACKASS!
,capthightop,2010-01-29T23:45Z,"Hey bruno why did you create these torrents if you werent going to seed them? I have been dling since the day they were uploaded and I have seeded at least 10,000 times more of your own torrent than you! There are 4 DVDs in the compilation with 0 seeds! What a giant waste of peoples time! If any one can upload or link to season 1 DVDs 2&3 and season 3 DVDs 4&7 since bruno is to big a fag or to busy sucking cock to seed his own torrents that would awesome. BRUNO I HOPE YOU CHOKE TO DEATH ON THE COCK YOU GARGLE!"

However, it is in full DVD9, not DVD5 like this one. Let's hope someone could rip it into DVD 5 for us."

,cachele,2010-02-12T07:43Z,"so, is anybody going to finish this ?
the ""seeders"" donÂ´t deserve such name !

,x4skill,2010-02-22T19:59Z,Do the seeders come and go or is this just a lost cause?  Right now it's at 0 seeders and has been for a couple days.
