1. Install the application. 
2. Exit the application. 
3. Block in your Firewall ""Xilisoft DVD Creator 6 Update.exe"" and ""dvdcreator.exe"" following the path to your folder, something like: c:\program files\Xilisoft\DVD Creator 6. 
4. Open DVD Creator again > click on ""Help"" > click on ""Enter license code"" > enter whatever in ""User name"" and copypaste the serial in ""License code"".

Here's a screenshot of my registered copy for this product:
