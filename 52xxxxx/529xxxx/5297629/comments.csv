,k2pikachu,2010-01-22T03:37Z,Thanks! Team Deathmatch works perfectly for me! I haven't tried the other game modes yet.
,flyingazn,2010-01-22T05:10Z,"Thanks yo! This works perfect 100% but I have one question. Let's say I am hosting a 3rd person and I do these commands in console...

   sv_maxclients 18
   party_maxplayers 18
   scr_dm_timelimit 1
   map_restart

Then it goes back to lobby with 18 people and goes into game again, but it is a 18 player 3rd person deathmatch. WTF?! I then type in

g_gametype war
scr_thirdperson 0
map mp_terminal
map_restart

but it does TDM but everyone is one the same team and ""it shows the enemies as red but you cannot kill them and no one can win"". how do i fix this?

other then that GREAT job and keep em coming.. i think 1.0.177 is out but idk"
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-22T14:48Z,"yes I know that bug, you have to restart the map, sometime you have to restart it one time and other many times, it's buggy lol

enter this commands

playlist 0
scr_thirdperson 0
map mp_terminal
map_restart"

,abeesh666,2010-01-22T18:51Z,its not working anymore. it just leaves me in the lobby searching for a game... it never finds one... IT NEVER FINDS ONE!!!
