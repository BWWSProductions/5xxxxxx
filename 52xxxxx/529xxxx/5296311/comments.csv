Obviously yes its faster, thats coz its one pass, vs 2. However, its only a bit faster, the first pass only takes a fraction of the time for the full pass.( As long as you dont add your filters in yet)

One of the advantages of using 2 pass is the difference in the way it distributes the bitrate throughout the file.
EG, High bitrate areas with lots of moving objects on screen will get the extra bitrate they need, and low bitrate stills will get the reductaion they can accept.

Whereas CBR will keep the bitrate CONSTANT, hence the name  Constant bitrate."
