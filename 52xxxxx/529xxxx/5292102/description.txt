Saturday 7 February 2009 will forever be known as Black
Saturday. On this day the worst bushfires in the history of
Australia caused devastation across Victoria like never seen
before. The effect this terrible tragedy had was felt not only
here, but worldwide. Almost simultaneously Queensland was
undergoing its own tragedy, with the state experiencing
widespread flooding.

In response to our nation's greatest ever natural disasters,
Australia's music community, along with some of the biggest
music names internationally, banded together for two stadium
benefit concerts that ran simultaneously in both Melbourne and
Sydney under the unified banner SOUND RELIEF. The final result
of over $8.00 million raised is an achievement that everyone
should be proud of.
