Description..

Described as a very personal record (even though it's a covers album), 
the twelve songs were performed only with orchestral instruments and voice. 
To help craft the recording Peter enlisted John Metcalfe as composer/arranger, 
the expertise of producer Bob Ezrin (Pink Floyd's 'The Wall', Lou Reed's 'Berlin') and the engineer, 
mixer and producer Tchad Blake (Suzanne Vega, Sheryl Crow, Tom Waits). 
'Scratch My Back' was recorded at George Martin's Air Lyndhurst Studios 
and the Real World Temple with further editing back here at Real Worlds Studios in Wiltshire.

Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
Cheers, Bubanee
