,black francis,2010-02-16T09:11Z,"Similar artists. U2 and Yes? 

That's impossible. U2 and Yes cannot be similar to the same artist. One is horrible while the other is ingenious. 

Bono clocks in at 9.5 courics while Yes (at least the early stuff) is pure musical excellence.

I'm sorry, I just really really loathe U2. 

Thank you so much for this though. I can't wait to hear the versions of ""Philadelphia"" and ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"""
