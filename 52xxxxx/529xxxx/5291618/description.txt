        Saturday  7  February  2009 will  forever  be  known as  Black
        Saturday. On this  day the worst  bushfires in the  history of
        Australia caused devastation  across Victoria like  never seen
        before. The effect this terrible tragedy had was felt not only
        here,  but  worldwide.  Almost  simultaneously  Queensland was
        undergoing  its  own  tragedy,  with  the  state  experiencing
        widespread flooding.

        In response to our  nation's greatest ever natural  disasters,
        Australia's music  community, along  with some  of the biggest
        music names internationally,  banded together for  two stadium
        benefit concerts that ran simultaneously in both Melbourne and
        Sydney under the unified banner SOUND RELIEF. The final result
        of over $8.00 million  raised is an achievement  that everyone
        should be proud of.

        It is fitting that such a tremendous event can be immortalised
        on DVD and the generosity  of the artists involved must  again
        be acknowledged and commended. Thanks should also be given  to
        all the individuals and companies that contributed their  time
        and resources to make Sound Relief such a resounding  success.
        After 4  long months  of clearing  the project,  every artist,
        record  label  and  publisher  have  donated  100%  of   their
        royalties and all profits from the sale of this DVD will go to
        fund Red Cross  Disaster Preparedness Projects,  which develop
        programs  and  resources  to  better  prepare  communities for
        disasters such  as Bushfires  and Floods.  9 hours  of footage
        over 4 discs. featuring every artist, documenting the  biggest
        concerts in Australian music history.
