Even if its set to something very low, at least your not being a total leech-  When downloading, I have uTorrent set at only a 16 kb/sec upload, but when its done, I have it set to unlimited, which is around 300kb/sec

Come, on, seed everyone so us firsties can finish and start seeding while watching this shit"
