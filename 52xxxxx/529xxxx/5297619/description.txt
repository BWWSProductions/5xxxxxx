This is another movie which, rather than me playing it here without audio, should be viewed on the big screen at a theater. It is that good. I have given you the director's mainstreamâ„¢ name. Search for him on the Internet Movie Database.
Georgina Spelvin portrays Kate, an obsessive woman. Clair Dia portrays Elaine, who is married to Charles Hooper (Mark). They have two teenage children: Stacy & Ronnie. Kate lives in the house with the four of them. Elaine does not know Mark is having an affair with Kate, who is trying to convince Mark to leave Elaine and marry her. Kate & Mark's sex scenes are flammable.
One evening aboard the family yacht, Kate strikes Mark with a bottle, who falls overboard and drowns. This leads to pangs of guilt for Kate, which she transmits to Stacy & Ronnie. This triggers a chain of sexual activity. The family is ultimately gutted. You will remember the ending.
This movie has superb acting, a comprehensive story, realistic character development, and passionate, erotic scenes. The lesbian shower scene between Kate and Elaine has been emulated by??-level Hollywood directors [you will see what they can't show without losing their contractually-obligated "R"-rating ]. This is better than the unrated movies which play Friday nights on CinemaxÃ‚Â®, and 95% of what you find at second-tier video stores. [Because the first-tier spurns movies in this genr]
