[V],-jonny-,2010-01-20T15:50Z,You see that green skull? That means you don't have to ask about its legitimacy.
,pacman11,2010-01-20T16:24Z,Thanks for the clarification Johnny... Much appreciated :)
,bradford3,2010-01-20T17:09Z,seeeeeeeeeed pleeeeease
,reazonable,2010-01-20T18:24Z,I'm waiting for 1080p 13gig rip for this one :)

A video doesn't always have to be available for purchase before you see it on here :P

@mysteryed
That's what private trackers like demonoid are for - go join them and gtfo :P

@walidbj
It's extremely rare that you will EVER see a 720p release at 1280x720 resolution. I've been watching 720p releases pretty much since they were available and only saw about 2-3 that had that exact resolution. Probably because the scene that gives you these releases has rules that make them change their video to look uniform with all their other videos or they change the resolution as a part of cleaning up the footage."
,iComet,2010-01-21T02:41Z,"Thank you!!
720p is probably the best your going to get.... won't seem much of a difference if you were to watch from a laptop or w/e anyway....

Please people, if you've already completed downloading, SEED ;)"
,caliwillbemine,2010-01-21T13:59Z,Why not releasing 1080p as well ???
,verbose2,2010-01-21T14:53Z,"alternate ending?!

This is 2012 mother fucker! It only ends one way!"
,wordondastreet,2010-01-21T18:48Z,"lol @ trolkan

2012 was shot in 2.35:1 aspect ratio. So according to your ""formula"" the resolution of this video should be 1280x545. So much for trying to be a smartass :P"
,fantasypc,2010-01-21T21:22Z,"Does anyone know if I split this video will it reduce the quality, because I have a 4gb usb flashdrive but I want to get this on my PS3, thanks."
,justin131,2010-01-22T01:06Z,"I have to say idiots saying it's not 720 or 1080 because they don't understand aspect ratios are getting a little to common. I mean is it really that hard to understand? There is no purpose to having the black bars in the encode. It's wasted space.

@walidbj If these releases are stretching on your tv, change the settings. If you can't change the settings, get a tv worth watching."
,OEM,2010-01-22T02:59Z,"The ""scene"" groups rip to non-standard resolutions/file sizes because they are a bunch of elitist asssholes who doesn't want people to burn these movies to DVD's and play them in stand-alone Blu-ray players.

Removing the black borders break compatibility with stand-alone players (including the PS3), yet it does not increase quality or reduce encode time at all.

While there are some Blu-ray discs that has black borders that aren't pure black, the encoder can remove them then reinsert pure black borders. It's just a simple matter of changing the encode parameters."
,pakicraze,2010-01-22T07:23Z,"every one arguing please SHUT THE FUCK UP and stop making the comments pages so fucking long...

fantasypc *** search for * MKV2VOB *  on google and read whatever u can about it... it splits the movie to parts depending on what file size you need the files to be... ITS THE BEST WAY TO WATCH MKV movies on the PS3"
,crimson85,2010-01-22T22:49Z,What Format is this in? There is another one bye METis that says .MKV at the end so is this a mpeg or avi?
,Dave70x,2010-01-23T00:36Z,"Brilliant picture and sound quality. Thank you for the upload but, really shit film. Probably one of the most awful films ever. Never seen so many cliches in one movie."
,buba1,2010-01-24T16:54Z,"thanks to the uploder,i'm waiting for this for a long time. To all other seeders, i'm downloading this for almost four days and i get only 50% till now. There was 7500 leechers, now there's 2755. Where are the fck seeders gone?There are only 450 and they give nothing. Where is your sense of shareness?There should be unwriten rule:if you download something, you should be grateful and return that to others with max. upload!"
,justin131,2010-01-25T17:40Z,"@OEM

Yet I watch all the blu-ray rips I want on MY ps3 with no problems, stretching, or anything whatsoever. Maybe it's a special ps3. Are you fucking retarded? How the hell does the resolution ""break"" compatibility? Change the settings so your player isnt stretching everything to fullscreen. If your bd player cant play this because it doesnt have the black bars encoded into it, you need a GOOD bd player. Period."
,Krpano,2010-01-28T20:39Z,"@ Dave70x, ....... +1"
,fibonacci89,2010-01-29T14:17Z,What the f.ck is .MKV ?
,dukenukem47,2010-02-02T22:36Z,"No sound!

I use PowerDVD 9.0 Ultra, installed coreAVC 2.0 for hardware driven video playback in PowerDVD. Tried installing ACS Filter for Win 7 64, still no sound. Playback in VLC works fine, with sound, which makes me think that there is some sort of sound codec problem?

Would really appreciate some guidance on this.

Thanks"
,simoncww,2010-02-08T01:09Z,MKVs are for homos...
,foxelein,2010-06-21T09:02Z,many thx... :)
