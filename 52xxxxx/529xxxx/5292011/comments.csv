,Ruyuk,2010-01-19T19:01Z,Will you stop posting torrents that are already on here?
,ionlyknow,2010-01-19T19:06Z,"There aren't any instructions how to run on ATI at the bottom of the post :S When this is fixed I will download and seed for a month or so :) 
And why are there so many files? Non of them are big enough to be the real game... 
Answers please!"
,langweiler94,2010-01-19T21:26Z,"the files are split, you'll need to download all files, and then u can join them together and voila you can unrar the game"
,hurukhan,2010-01-21T15:56Z,So does this work with an ATI graphics card? Cause I don't feel like donwloading this game again if it's not going to work on my computer!!

,CrAcKed-OuTT,2010-01-22T16:39Z,"Had this going for about 3 hours until it crashed and is unable to start up again. Got as far as the first loading screen then had to force quit. Don't download, and don't expect it to work. Its a PC game converted to Mac. "

ISEE THIS COMMNT COULD BE YOUR CASE ;)

 Phillakied at 2010-03-14 23:57 CET:
Gus stop saying the hole ""if you don't got Nvidia graphics card then it don't work cause I don't have Nvidia graphics"" I have ATi and i can play it.

For those with ATI download Crossover games. When it is done downloading (With this torrent you should have Cod 6 folder when done downloading)
Go in the folder, instead of just double clicking the app just right click and go into ""Show package content""
Content/Resources/Transgaming/c_drive/Programme/Activison/Modern warfare 2

From there you should see two things one says ""iw4sp.exe"" or ""iw4mp.exe"" click on iw4sp, crossover should show up and install it into a bottle. then you should either see a blank box or one with mw 2 either way it should work. enjoy playing everyone. Questions?"
,Phillakied,2010-03-16T21:16Z,lol it's me

,Lord-Fear,2011-08-01T23:22Z,Does this work anyone? and how do i find out how much free memory i have? i think I'm looking in the wrong spot because it said 1 free GB but it has no problem running a 6GB game that i just got on here (call of duty 4)
,Lord-Fear,2011-08-02T18:34Z,"WOW seriously? took all my time yesterday to get this and it doesn't even work, thats just insulting.

says ""invalidVersion"" when i try, and randomly quits.

I'm on os x Lion if that has anything to do with the problem"
,Lord-Fear,2011-08-02T18:39Z,"Pmmmp: it means you don't have any room on your computer, this file is 11GB so thats a lot for used computers that have apps on them.

Try getting MW1 instead its only 7GB (get the one that says Call Of Duty 4 Mac [k'd][game])

oh and also, this torrent didn't work anyway, i got it and its invalid..."
,Lord-Fear,2011-08-02T18:43Z,"one more thing to comment: those of you that have trouble, use UnRarX, its good for extracting the files for this torrent"
