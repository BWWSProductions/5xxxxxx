When Gotham Citys hospitals, homes and streets begin filling with the undead, the Dark Knight is the only one with a chance to discover the secret behind their continued animation. Ras al Ghul has left a world filled with miserable, self-aware, reanimated corpses for the Batman to face. In order to do so, he must follow Ras al Ghuls centuries of secret world travels.

Written by Devin Grayson and penciled by Paul Gulacy.

This two-issue mini-series was published simultaneously with Year One: Batman/Scarecrow to coincide with the release of Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins.
