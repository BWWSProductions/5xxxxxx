I don't think I've seen such ridiculous drawings in years and certainly NEVER in a Batman comic/graphic novel (but I gotta admit I'm a bit of a n00b so there might be other ""gems"" like that let looose in nature). 

Of course I'm not implying you're responsible for what's in it, Brodahisou, don't take it personal. It's just that I was so excited about this one that it feels like disappointment just litteraly punched me in the face.

At least now I know what names I don't want to see on the cover of my comics anymore."
