,the_shroud,2010-01-22T11:40Z,"Hi 20-40,
Just asking, will you be adding Caprica to your weekly list. Its starting today, gonna be awesome.
Thanks anyway"
,littlebluebox,2010-01-22T11:50Z,"thanks for the upload, twentyforty! are you doing 'Burn Notice' by any chance?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-22T12:17Z,"@shroud: Absolutely!

@littlebluebox: After this one goes Fringe, Gray, Burn Notice, The Mentalist, Bones. Everything is encoded and ready to go - but when - depends not on me but the people. Please guys, please, DO NOT put your upload speed AS LOW AS CAN GO. True leechers will be kicked out, and any tampering with speeds (just during the download) would be appropriately ""rewarded"".

This shitty behavior cannot go forever. I can go, some morons can go - but who will that be, depends on you."

[V],twentyforty,2010-01-22T14:25Z,@danbye79: As always. Do not worry about.
