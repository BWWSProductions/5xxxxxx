,lokiman,2010-01-25T06:23Z,"Thanks, NoExcuses.
This is first time I have notice a thinned one by you.
Have you used xenocode ?"
[V],NoExcuses,2010-01-25T21:46Z,"@lokiman
I've already used Thinstall/ThinApp with a few applications that was too difficult to make them portable in the usual hand-made way. I've already downloaded Xenocode but I've not yet tried to use it. Too lazy in the last times... ;-)"
,lokiman,2010-01-26T02:55Z,"Thanks for the info. Some thinned ones work well for me
but I have have several total failures.
Almost no failures with portables, none with yours."
