,justnewbie,2010-01-21T06:19Z,Thanks a lot. Very nice quality. Worth the time and effort. Will keep seeding. Until the next 720p BRrip. 
,PoshNinja,2010-01-24T20:39Z,Are these subs for only the non-English portions or are these subs throughout the entire movie?
,anonim1979,2010-02-04T15:32Z,"!WARNING!.

This video has BADLY coded keyframes making BIZZARE quality driops (more blured / LQ frames) every few seconds. (They looks like a sudden brightness changes)

I HIGHLY recommend

instead!
