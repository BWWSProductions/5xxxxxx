,interpleXity,2010-07-09T08:18Z,"THIS WORKS. LISTEN THE FUCK UP.nnDownload: ** ULTRA ISO***nnAnd mount it with that, its an .img file not an .iso u stupid fucks. then run autorun and install."
,ZeldaKrazed7,2010-07-15T00:28Z,"WTF, all you guys are stupid, this installed fine for me (I used Daemon Tools), but is there a land generator? \'Cause i can\'t use it, the option just doesn\'t show up. pretty gay"
,Craized,2010-08-23T23:10Z,"Does this work with Windows 7?  

Also, does it work online?"
,Craized,2010-08-24T03:16Z,"Well I decided to not wait for an answer and tried this.  It seemed to install fine but whenever I try to run the game it tells me to insert the CD.  It's weird because in the installer it even said that this version lets you play without the CD. 

And yes, I have it mounted still.

Anyone know how to get around this?"
,Craized,2010-08-24T03:30Z,"Well I figured out that the no CD error only occurs AFTER installing the 3.6.29.0 update (the latest version.)  

This torrent is 3.6.28.0 but appears to run on Windows 7 if you don't install the 3.6.29.0 update."
,Craized,2010-08-24T03:35Z,"From the Worms Armageddon support site:

""Trymedia versions will not work with this update. If you download this update and apply it to a Trymedia version then the game will request a CD and you will have to re-install the game.""


So I guess this torrent is the Trymedia version."
,pjtms,2010-10-27T03:15Z,"Game works fine.
If you have W7 or vista you can get some color problems but if you install the patch to correct that problem the game wonâ€™t work. 
But the solution is simple. The color error occurs because some incompatibility with W7 explorer.exe . If you close se explorer before running the game you wonâ€™t have any problems. But it is kind of annoying doing that all the time you want to play. In order to do that automatically do the following:
1- Create a text document in Notepad
2- In that the document. txt paste the following information:
--------------------------------------------------------

@echo off
@echo ================================================
@echo WA Colour Fix! v1.00
@echo ================================================
@echo Simply place this BAT file into your Worms armageddon folder and execute it,
@echo this will close all instances of Explorer.exe then start the game, when closing
@echo the game, Explorer.exe is reloaded.

@echo off
taskkill /f /IM explorer.exe
WA.exe /nointro
Start explorer.exe
--------------------------------------------------------

3- Save the file, changing the extension â€œ .txt â€ to â€œ .bat â€œ (example Worms.bat)
8- Go to the folder where you installed the game and paste there  the file you created (Worms.bat)
9- Make sure that the executable file to run the game is named WA.exe (yes in uppercase letters)
10- Make a desktop shortcut for â€œworms.batâ€ and there you go. The game will close explorer.exe automatically before start and open it again when you close. No more problems  :D "

So far, i haven't found an update that works :/

Anyone got any suggestions ?"
,incompetence,2011-08-04T06:52Z,"Notice this is a .img file and not an iso which is not recognized by power iso by default. Open power iso > options > configurations and check the box next to .img. Hope this helps, enjoying having worms!"
