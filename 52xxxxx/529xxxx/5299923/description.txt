Formerly a Theresa double LP, this single CD contains all ten of Pharoah Sanders's performances from the sessions.  As usual, Sanders shifts between spiritual peace and violent outbursts in his tenor solos.  The backup group changes from track to track but often includes pianist John Hicks, bassist Ray Drummond and drummer Idris Muhammad.  Sanders really recalls his former boss John Coltrane on "After the Rain" (taken as a duet with pianist Joe Bonner) and a romantic "Easy to Remember"; other highpoints include "You've Got to Have Freedom" (which has Bobby McFerrin as one of the background singers) and the exotic "Kazuko" on which Sanders is accompanied by kato, harmonium and wind chimes. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG
