keep the BRRIP @ H264 coming mate.

@imrealgod
why would you want to go back to dvdrips when there's bdrips available?? however im sure you mean for him to go back to XviD but lets be honest H264 is the future and is way better than everything else.

@every one else
700mb rips can not serve justice to any movie with a decent resolution."
