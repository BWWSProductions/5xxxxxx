,dlectro,2011-01-20T15:29Z,"The actual resolution of the content here is 1920x752, so there are black bars at the top and bottom.
There's a rip by EuReKA that has no black bars, the picture quality is the same, the file size is less than 3GB, and that's an mkv.
You can find it on BTjunkie and Torrenthound, or with Torrentz dot com."
