"A New Day Has Come" is the lead single from CÃ©line Dion's comeback album A New Day Has Come, released on March 11, 2002.

The song was written by Aldo Nova and Stephan Moccio and produced by Walter Afanasieff and Nova as a piano-driven ballad. However, the midtempo radio remix co-produced by Ric Wake was released as the lead track. Both versions are included on the album.

The "A New Day Has Come" music video was directed by Dave Meyers and premiered in March 2002.

"A New Day Has Come" was very successful around the world. On the U.S. Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, the song broke the record for most weeks at number 1: it stayed on top twenty-one weeks. The previous record holders were Phil Collins' "You'll Be in My Heart" and CÃ©line Dion's own "Because You Loved Me," both of which lasted nineteen weeks at number 1. However, as of today, the record has been surpassed, as "Drift Away" by Uncle Kracker featuring Dobie Gray remained twenty-eight weeks at number 1 in 2004. Ironically, it was CÃ©line Dion who almost took the crown from "Drift Away," but "Have You Ever Been in Love" stopped at number 2 for fourteen weeks, which is another record. In the U.S., the single appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 because of airplay only, reaching number 22 (also number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay).

The DVD single was released four months later in the U.S., peaking at number 11 on the Top Music Video and number 16 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales. It has sold 45,000 copies and was certified gold. "A New Day Has Come" CD single was also certified gold in Australia (35,000), Greece (30,000) and Norway (10,000). In the United Kingdom it has sold 110,000 copies.

Dion performed this song five nights a week during her show A New Day... at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas and released it on the Live in Las Vegas - A New Day... DVD in December 2007. In October 2008, "A New Day Has Come" was included on My Love: Essential Collection greatest hits.
