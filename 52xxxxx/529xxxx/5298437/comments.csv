But thanks for uploading all the same."

,takehiro12,2010-01-23T02:46Z,"I was disappointed too.  A clip show?  Are you kidding me?  I stopped my DVR recording, erased it, and walked away to do something else.  But then I found myself back in the room toward the end of the show, and they did a wonderfully edited and very moving history of the relationship between Pam & Jim, and to a lesser extent the office as a whole.  I was in tears.  I tried to re-record the show, but the next one had started so it wouldn't let me.  Which is why I'm here.

I don't download many episodes of The Office, but that ending makes it worthwhile."
