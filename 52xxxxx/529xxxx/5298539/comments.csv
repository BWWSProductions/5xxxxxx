,mahkok,2010-01-23T06:47Z,"Hi. Any chance you could just reveal the serial? I already got the setup and downloading another 1GB+ just for the serial doesn't look like a good deal. =|

Help a brother out, my connections is not amazing.

Thanks."
[V],thethingy,2010-01-23T06:52Z,"you need the right serial for the setup and the right .dll patch and the right host blocker, best deal is to help all of the other brothers out and download this and seed for a while, but if you want to take a chance and just get the serial then post another comment."
,mahkok,2010-01-23T08:23Z,"Ya, I know what you mean, but it's like that: I got that tam/core serial generator that gave me valid keys for every single CS4 product plus Photoshop Elements 8.

On that keygen, the only ""new"" product missing is Premiere Elements 8, which I had downloaded from Adobe previously (the trial setup that can be activated with a valid key).

My hosts file is already blocked (the tam/core keygen did it), so I just need the a valid serial.

But I see your point here. I'll DL the torrent and seed for a month or so. Thanks for the upload mate."
,blitzseed,2010-01-24T00:20Z,so do i just run the exe and thats it or do i have to do some other stuff as well? or is there a crack/serial?

,semych,2010-01-28T09:32Z,"google says that:

in 64bit systems it's necessary to create MANUALLY a folder etc in windows system32 and windows will automatically create the necessary files: hosts, lmhosts.sam, networks, protocol, services.

the problem seems is solved. i will check up in the evening"
,semych,2010-01-28T21:40Z,"at last i have understood. may be to somebody it would be useful. 
i could not get access to a folder ""etc"", create it too. but in windows 7 64bit this folder exists, it's hidden. ""hosts"" needs to be opened directly from a notepad (enter manually full path to it).

[V],thethingy,2010-02-03T13:53Z,"reasons for this;
1; Outdated hardware, you should have more than the adobe recomended requirements for video editing, at least 20gb free space, pagefile of at leat 1gb. check your drivers.
2; Outdated firmware. In particular, and outdated version of Quicktime.
3 The software did not take properly when installed.

whats your specs?"
[V],thethingy,2010-02-03T13:55Z,"4; File fragmentation, defrag your hard drive."

[V],thethingy,2010-02-03T15:52Z,"fwhcascade, 32bit is the operating system for this, so try defragmenting your drive and updating your video driver (gpu), if you have Nvidia gpu try just uninstalling the 3d driver, if that fails uninstall it with the toolkit and try installing again."

,lightfrommoon4u,2010-08-13T23:35Z,"Thethingy, am I correct that the adobe premier 8 does not include any of the extras that you get from a ""PLUS"" account, such as the title menus, etc.  Is there another d/l that I can get to add these without paying adobe for them? If so, can you point me in the direction of which torrent to download.  

Thank you much for all the time you've spent with your torrents.  You da man. "
