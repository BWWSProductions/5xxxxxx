Tomohisa and Endo arenâ€™t either so handsome or ugly; they are just normal boy students. Theyâ€™re looking at Mizuho, the senior student, and Mikura, their classmate. Mizuho is a returnee student, and she attracts all the students by her beauty. Mizuho notices their eyes, and she gives Tomohisa a suggestive look.

One day, Tomohisa finds a note in his desk. It says, â€œIâ€™m waiting in the ladiesâ€™ room on the third floorâ€. He goes there and finds Mizuho is waiting for him...

The next day, Tomohisa canâ€™t help recalling the event the day before. He happens to find that Endo is gone, and also Mikura , whom he loves secretly, is missing, too. Heâ€™s afraid that theyâ€™re doing things. However, exactly, theyâ€™re doing things on the fire escape.
