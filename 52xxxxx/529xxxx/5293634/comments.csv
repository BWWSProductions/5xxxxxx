,htctouch,2010-01-20T13:38Z,"hello sir . hw ru ?
r u gonna do 2012 2009 BDRip XviD-iMBT ??
was waiting for this 1 for so long ."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-20T15:06Z,"@mrhinter: Yeah, that's one of the shows I watch. Good cliffhanger from  ep 7, tough.
And... shows I personally watch are certainly ones with lowest number of downloads (as was Monk, Castle, Lie to me). Should I be surprised? I guess not.

@htctouch: I have done and upped 2012 three times. Last was R5 and was pretty good. That torrent is probably dead or semi-dead (as usual) but if you want I can resurrect that one, since no new 2012 will be re-encoded by me.

[V],twentyforty,2010-01-20T17:25Z,"@htctouch: With VirtalDub
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualDub
open first avi file than click on File>Append AVI segment for the next avi, than the same for the next and so on.
Set Video>Direct stream copy and Audio>Direct stream copy. At the end, save such new file, comprised of smaller avi files with File>Save as AVI.
VirtualDub can join AVI files with ""normal"" MP3 audio track. For avi files with VBR mp3 audio tracks you should use Avidemux
http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/download.html
and do very similar things.
For joining avi files with AC3 audio one must install AC3 ACM codec.

All is free and zillions of tutorials exists on line. Just Google."
