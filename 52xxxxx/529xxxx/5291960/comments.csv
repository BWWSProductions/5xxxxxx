,twistquist,2010-01-19T19:55Z,Hell yeah!
,twistquist,2010-01-20T10:15Z,"Works pretty good overall. I am just playing it on my little 13' macbook pro 2.26 GHz Core 2 Due with 4 GB ram.

Like the description says, it crashes everytime you try to exit to main menu. I have almost everything minimized just so I can keep the framerate up to where I want it. Even so, it looks like the graphics are still almost up to par with the cider port of L4D 1 when maximized... and the intro movie is in mexican or chinese or slovakian or something, I have no idea why

This is the first time iv played this game and I gotta say, it is kinda bullshit that this wasnt released as DLC but considering I am playing it for free I aint bitchin. Good torrent!"
,carlo.magno16,2010-01-23T12:58Z,nice torrent works for me thanks!
,Rowanard,2010-01-24T05:07Z,"Works great both online and offline. There's a lack of servers supporting 2.0.0.7 though. That first link to the russian server list doesn't work, btw."

,LeeS.,2010-01-25T23:48Z,"Can see HUD and ammo/guns/temates, but not the rest of the surounds. Its just pitch black with a couple random things here and there. I tried adjusting the setting, but it keeps happening. Any suggestions?"
,valdukin1,2010-01-27T04:05Z,"hey the command console isnt the key above tab maybe your using a different keyboard to the one I am, can you tell us the actual key thanks for the help mate"
,kimmo1599,2010-01-27T22:43Z,"hey guys,i wanted to trie to get the console up, but    
there is no key for it. so i tried to go into Left 4 Dead 2/show package contents/contents/root/drive_c/program files/left4dead2/left4dead2/cfg/config_default.cfg and also config.cfg
in both of those files there are many keys listed, and if you scroll down, you`l find   

bind ""`"" ""toggle console""

I`ve tried to edit,change and delete. But nothing is changing, maybe you guys can find something.
Just a hint:-D "
,bravernat,2010-01-28T05:27Z,works perfect except for the whole not being able to close single player without crashing it factor...

,Wietse,2010-02-11T16:34Z,"When I click ""Single Player"" it keeps showing the loading screen and I hear chirps, just like zewiseone had... Can someone help?"
,palap980,2010-02-15T00:16Z,"Downloading kind of quickly (compared to others) right now, but just a quick question, what does CXZ mean?"
,Bobthedeadly,2010-02-21T20:58Z,"Took way too long to download, (was never getting above 10 Mb/s) so I got it from my friend who already downloaded it. Few things:

Intro is is Russian, no problem though, it's not very important

Runs very well with slightly lowered settings (turned down resolution) on white unibody MacBook (2.26 GHz, 4 GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce 9400M Graphics Card)

Sound has a .5-1.5 second lag, depending on what's happening. Don't know why.

Game does crash when exiting to menu from Single Player.

LAN works, I was able to create a game through the console and my friend's game automatically detected it and it appeared at the bottom of the main menu. Game crashed when I exited to main menu from LAN game, just for me though, not for my friend.

Instructions on how to create LAN game:

On main menu, press ` (under esc, above tab) to open console.
Type ""sv_allow_lobby_connect_only 1"" and press enter.
Type ""sv_lan 1"" and press enter.
If you want a difficulty other than Normal, type ""z_difficulty [Easy, Normal, Advanced, Impossible]"" and press enter.
Type ""map "" and scroll down to the one you want (They are in order). Press enter.
The map will load.
Your friend, on the main menu will see a server pop up on the botton of his screen. They should click it, and then select ""Join."" Works perfectly.

I can't figure how to change my name from N00b, but that doesn't matter much.

Also:
""the intro movie is in mexican or chinese or slovakian or something, I have no idea why""
I lol'd."
,shat666,2010-02-25T20:59Z,"i downloaded CXZ
how do i play the game?"
,Bobthedeadly,2010-02-27T01:00Z,"@shat666

You just double click the Left 4 Dead 2 icon. That's all there is to it. What happens when you try to open it?

If you don't have a system that's compatible, it probably wouldn't open. What's your box?"
,rezdog21,2010-02-28T16:53Z,"i have the same problem as a couple of other people, single player fully loads, then glitches and freezes and all i can hear is continuous chirping, i think the first sound in the campaign, any ideas?"

,dr-ludvig,2010-03-20T19:19Z,"My problem: 
I need to play a lan game, so i need the console.. However the console can only be brought up when in a game. the only game i can join without the console is a singleplayer, so i make a singleplayer game. then i type all the things for a lan game, and it works fine, however before starting the lan game, it disconnects from the singleplayer game and goes back to the menu, which causes the game to crash, as stated in the info.. 
So im pretty much stuck here?! How have you guys done? i can't bring up the console without being in a game.. and when starting a lan game you need to disconnect from your current game..
but since singleplayer is the only i can join, it crashes..
How can i join a multiplayer game without the console, so i can start a lan game without it crashing?!?! please help me!"
