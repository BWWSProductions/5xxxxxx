Port Thanks to n3wf0ld3r

Like the original, Left 4 Dead 2 is set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, and focuses on four survivors fighting against hordes of the infected. The survivors must fight their way through levels, interspersed with safe houses that act as checkpoints, with the goal of reaching a rescue vehicle at the campaign's finale. The gameplay is procedurally altered by an artificial intelligence engine dubbed the "Director" that monitors the players' performance and alters the scenario to provide a dynamic challenge for the players as they progress. Several new features have been introduced, such as new types of infected, melee weapons, and a story-arc that connects each of the game's five campaigns together.

Doesn't work for some people( 2 people reported black/white anomaly's on different machine specs, 1 report of non working on Mac Pro 8 core with ati4870)

System requirements:
Mac OS version: 10.5.6-10.6.2 (not tested on 10.4)
Min. Processor: Intel Core Solo 2.0Ghz
Min RAM: 1024
Video RAM: 256MB (may be slow on 128)
Hard-disk Space: 7.42GB
Requires CXZ Black Engine

Languages
English/Russian (change Language in rev.ini)

What works
Single Player
Playing on cracked servers
Lan (Was able to create a LAN game using the console, but since there is no one in my LAN - probably working)

What doesn't
Steam servers(obviously)
Exiting to main menu from single player, causes crashing( use "disconnect" to quit multiplayer, no crashing there), seems to be a conflict with the steam crack and crossover itself.
Restarts finder and closes all apps (happened only one time in 30 launches). So save all work just in case.

Performance
Since its officially supported by Codeweavers, the performance is pretty amazing
Loads and plays faster than the L4D cider.

Runs silky smooth on 1280x800 with medium settings.
Also works in windowed mode.

Additional info
To change name :
Use either "name" command in the console or
1.Open config_default.cfg file located in Left 4 Dead 2/config
2.Find bind "n" "setinfo name Powered_by_CSmania.RU" and change the key and nick
3.Press ingame :-)

Servers list
Many of them are still older version so you will see the protocol error when connecting.
Not all of them work
