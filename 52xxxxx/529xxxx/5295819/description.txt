Diamonds on the Inside (2003) is Ben Harper's first work without crediting the Innocent Criminals in almost 10 years, although all the touring members continue to support him on the album, with several additions. Shortly after going on tour to support this album, Marc Ford, formerly of The Black Crowes joined Harper's band.
