,theoquda,2010-02-06T05:46Z,Why only 5.5 on imdb ? This movie is very underrated. It worth at least an 8.
,michaelrwatson,2010-12-29T22:12Z,"I agree, good flick but the flashback-based chronology probably could have been done better."
,michaelrwatson,2010-12-29T22:13Z,"oops, i think i meant to say the flashback-based narrative."
