,Ryanz15,2010-01-20T23:55Z,"In fact there is a way of unbaning your console but it has to of been banned about a year or so ago. Basically you flash the NAND with a different one and it changes something and then you can go on live, but its complicated, and i don't know that much about it. Might look into it, not sure."
,KING_XXX_Rated,2010-01-21T05:35Z,"Tanks Ryan. Mines actually got banned the second week after release date for COD MW2. My girlfriend  bought me a PS3 for Christmas and its awesome. So i just play backups on the 360. Screw the pricks that ban.
