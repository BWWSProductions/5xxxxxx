your ps2 must be modded, the disc must be not rewritable

use Imageburn"

Thank you so much."
,bad-and-ugly,2012-03-23T19:56Z,"I haven't been able to properly burn it yet...

I used a DVD-R that accepts up to 16x.  I burnt it with the native Windows 7 DVD burner.  The final disc was empty!

Then I followed the instructions here ;-) and burnt with ImgBurn.  It could not burn at 1x, so it burnt at 3x.  The final disc was empty again '=(

What should I try next?  Any suggestions?

Thanks a lot!"
,bad-and-ugly,2012-03-27T03:19Z,"It worked on the third time! '=P  I don't know what I did wrong, by the second time, I burnt at 3x using ImgBurn.  The third time - when it worked - I burnt at 4x using ImgBurn."
