,T1mmyD,2010-01-22T13:44Z,"video is great, screener quality.

 you can definitely tell it's cam audio though.  immediately on start you can hear static, with people coughing occasionally.

only watched first minute or so, so can't rate movie

,bigghands,2010-01-23T20:12Z,"damn, another mislabled torrent.  this is not a dvd screener.  r5 with crappy cam or line audio, is what it is.  for newbies, that just means picture is OK quality, but sound is like a.m. radio playing in your toilet. shitty and VERY hollow."
,akief,2010-01-24T02:32Z,Please Seeds
,AlfredYLeVolcmp,2010-01-24T05:57Z,The audio is crap.  This is prolly a TS not a dvdscr.

,godswallops,2010-01-24T18:16Z,"Video is good, but the sound is poor.

I really appreciate the chance to watch this - thank you.

The movie is so good I decided not to watch the last 2/3rds with the audio sounding like it was underwater and in a pipe.  Rather wait until I can get another copy with better sound; the movie is worth it.

Thanks for the upload; your work is excellent as always."
,redpearl07,2010-01-25T00:45Z,"V:5
A:4"
,Torgard,2010-01-26T19:04Z,"You morons, read the description!

""Here's the dvdscr with english cam audio""

The original audio was in German I think, so they replaced it with cam audio instead.

@pawn3d shut the fuck up, go watch it in the cinema instead, you moron.

Also: Donate to Haiti people! Most of you should have a little scrape of decency left in you.

Oh, and thank you for the upload, I already had the out of sync one, this is somewhat better, more in sync at least."
,away1,2010-01-27T22:55Z,"V = 6
A = 2

Shitty quality, but it actualy matches with the quality of the movie itself -> also shitty :)"
,jh3141,2010-01-28T22:13Z,"torgard: ""You morons, read the description! ""Here's the dvdscr with english cam audio""""

Which means it should be tagged R5, not DVDSCR, as it isn't a straight DVD rip."
,Superbus,2010-01-29T21:44Z,"Too funny people dont even bother to read dvdscr vid / ts sound and then still dl it it and complain.

Must be the same assholes who make american idol so popular.
