The Story of Maths (2009)
Part 3

Without mathematics, there would be no physics, nor chemistry, nor cosmology. Oxford professor of mathematics, Marcus du Sautoy, explores the 30,000-year history of maths, examining the development of key mathematical ideas and shows how, in a multitude of surprising ways, they underpin the science, technology, and culture that shape our world. Four-part series about the history of mathematics, presented by Oxford professor Marcus du Sautoy.

The Frontiers of Space
By the 17th century, Europe had taken over from the Middle East as the world's powerhouse of mathematical ideas. Great strides had been made in understanding the geometry of objects fixed in time and space. The race was now on to discover the mathematics to describe objects in motion. In this programme, Marcus du Sautoy explores the work of RenÃ© Descartes and Pierre Fermat, whose famous Last Theorem would puzzle mathematicians for more than 350 years. He also examines Isaac Newton's development of the calculus, and goes in search of Leonard Euler, the father of topology or 'bendy geometry' and Carl Friedrich Gauss, who, at the age of 24, was responsible for inventing a new way of handling equations: modular arithmetic.
