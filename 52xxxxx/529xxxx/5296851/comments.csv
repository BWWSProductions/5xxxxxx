,khurrraam,2010-01-22T07:20Z,"Just wanted to say, you're doing a fantastic job. I've looked around at many rippers, fanatically analysed their rips, and I'm throughly satisfied.

I like your preference for the audio selection, stereo and ac3. I did like the fact that you used to provide aac 5.1 audio as well, but that's just my personal preference, since my iMac can playback aac 5.1 using my firewire sound card attached to my 5.1 system.

But then again, I have ac3 which is pretty much the same. I like your approach to keep the size in between 3-4 gig, keep the video nice and crisp.

I should also mention your tagging is a very nice touch, and I use an app called iSubtitle to create chapters in a second, insert subtitles, sometimes I use Subler to mux them as well. 

Now, only if had the time and bandwidth, I would joined you to give you a hand ripping and uploading releases with the exact specifications. 

Maybe sometime in the future. I have collected, organised, tagged a lot of tv shows perfect to be used along with iTunes & AppleTV, which size around 400 gig.

Anyways, keep up the good work."

,intobearzz,2010-01-27T01:38Z,"this M4V KIND OF SUCK.  i know u give us some great BR-Rip as good as SecretMyth. M4V does not record or burn in straight Divx or any scorce except convert and wait for an Hr and Half. so yes,can only watch in PC and not burn. Sorry guys."

A DVDr (not DVDrip) is always around 4.7 gb, which is a Full Dvd as you are referring to.

For Blu-ray however, the whole disk is 25GB, which would be rediculous to upload. This is a rip of a Blu-ray disk (BRRIP), which creates a file anywhere from 3GB all the way to 15GB, depending if it is 720p resolution (1280x720) or 1080p (1920x1080). A standard dvd is only 480p (720x480).

And if you don't have an HDTV, don't bother with 720p/1080p releases. Regular TV's cannot display these resolutions, so you might as well save some file space."
,Tomato9876,2010-01-29T02:29Z,"And also, x264 is the video codec, just like for most other releases Xvid of Divx is the codec. This is now the preferred codec for High-def releases, as it plays on all the devices listed in the description, and has very high compression rates."
,lando520,2010-02-13T22:59Z,Hey HR thanx for the upload man great quality and sound but I wanted to put it on my zune but when I drag the file into my collection it says media file type not valid so how could I sync it to my zune?
,The_Legend_Roy,2010-02-26T16:00Z,"Thanks, Holly Roses[HR] for this great quality rip.

I've downloaded this movie 3 times from different uploaders to get the best quality rip.
And I'm very much satisfied with ur rip. Keep it up...

GreaT Print:

Video Quality: 9/10 - Better than other 720ps or even 1080p's. Secretmyth's version is 10/10
on picture quality but frame-rate drops drastically at the end.

Audio Quality: 10/10.

I've a request, pls upload Avatar 1080p at this or better quality when bluray will be available.

Thank you in advance...!!!"
