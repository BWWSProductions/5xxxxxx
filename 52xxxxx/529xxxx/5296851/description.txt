-------------------------------------------------------
Designed for direct playback on Apple TV, PS3, WDTV, Xbox360, Popcorn Hour, VLC.

WDTV users change extension from .m4v to .mp4

Apparently there is a sync problem with MP4 for WDTV Live with the latest firmware.

It is discussed here 
http://wdtvhd.com/index.php?showtopic=8778
and here 
http://community.wdc.com/t5/WD-TV-Live-Firmware/1-0-17-MP4-Audio-Sync/td-p/6146

and suggested to rollback firmware to revision 1.01.00

PS3 user may need to rename to .mp4 also if you are playing from USB device.  Should be fine if you are just streaming with the .m4v extension.

Apple TV user ensure running firmware 3.0.1 (this firmware plays video much better than old firmware).  Use custom movie sync option "Automatically include the 10 most recent movies along with selected movies."  Streaming is possible but for best result always play native.  You may experience slight frame rate loss while streaming under certain conditions.

Regarding the subtitles;

English subs are included but not embedded.  The subs are FULL English subs however.  Less than 1% of the movie is foreign language.  It isn't very much, just a few short scenes.  113 lines I believe, out of 1890.

If you feel like modifying the subs (stripping all the english spoken language) use Aegisub , best program I have seen for the task.

If you wish to embed the subs use Subler (mac only).  Open video with Subler, drag sub file into Subler, change sub language to English, save. (This will take about 5-10 seconds.  It will break Front Row playback, but works with VLC, Quicktime, iTunes, Apple TV, iPod).

-----------------

Here are Partial English Subs you can use with this release.

You can embed both the full and partial subs using subler on Mac if you want them for your iPod or Apple TV, or quicktime, itunes, VLC, etc.

Make sure in Subler that you assign a unique name to each sub and set the language to English for both.
