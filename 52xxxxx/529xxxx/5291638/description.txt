This was an exceptional episode of the BBC production: Silent Witness http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007y6k8

Harry and Nikki try to remain professional when they find themselves on opposite sides of a high-profile case, but it's not easy as they're both brilliant at what they do, and they soon show that every piece of evidence can be interpreted at least two ways. (part one & two = 110 minutes)
