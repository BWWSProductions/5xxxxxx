wallpapers , screen saver or a theme ??"
,truckersim,2010-01-21T20:51Z,This is a THEME for Windows 7. Read the INFO!!!
,Cavi Mike,2010-02-14T22:15Z,"If this is really a theme and not just a wall-paper, could you please provide a screen-shot?

Why does everyone think I give a shit about their damn wall-papers anyways? I'm not gonna use it, I'm gonna use my own."
