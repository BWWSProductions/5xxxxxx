Livi is a Latvian hard rock band, that was influential in forming the Latvian rock music culture. Their signatures are poetic lyrics and guitar solos.

The band debuted in 1976, when it was founded in Liepaja by Eriks Kigelis and Juris Pavitols. They started out as a pop-rock band and played in various gigs around Latvia, whilst trying to find their own specific style. Thus the period of 1977-1985 was largely a chaotic time in the groupâ€™s music â€“ it varied from pretty pop to heavy rock. But one thing never changed â€“ their anti-soviet propaganda, their patriotism and their monumentalism.

After the death of Livi leader Eriks Kigelis in 1986, Ainars Virga joined the band, thus starting a new era â€“ the era of anthemic ballads, hard hitting heavy rock tunes and rebellious philosophy.
