FIRST RULE OF WINDOWS XP CD ""BUILDS"":

-- If they don't support ""repair-install"", then they are:

SHIT.

Why? A clean-install of XP is the biggest fucking pain in the ass if you have anything newer than a Pentium III, because you'll be missing half the drivers, and it'll be a goddamn chore to hunt all the fuckers down.

And every uploader who doesn't say whether repair-install is supported needs to be punched in the head until he shapes up.

(Been looking, for years, for a clear repair-install capable CD of Media Center which does NOT demand a serial half-way through.)"
