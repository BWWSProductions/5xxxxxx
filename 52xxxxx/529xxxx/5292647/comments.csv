,geoffd,2010-02-20T03:40Z,Has anyone had any success with this on a 32 bit machine? thanks
,geoffd,2010-02-20T19:24Z,hmm i do everything as said but there is a problem with the license when I start it and it won't run. It may be my fault because the first time I ran it I clicked ok to all the preamble and I think at some point there was a box selected with some sort of network connection thing that i should have unchecked since the license is for a non-server computer. anyone know how to fix this?
,geoffd,2010-02-21T06:30Z,ok got it to work. i didn't realize you had to include the hifens in the host id
,infoaddict,2010-03-24T03:31Z,Does this include the CAM tools (manufacturing)?
,threemile,2010-05-10T17:31Z,"I can't seem to get this to work.  I installed ProE and Mechanica yet when I run the crack, the crack says, ""path file not found, ProE and ProE mechanica not installed"" or something to that effect.  WTF?  I know it's installed I can run ProE, it just says, license inconsistent and shuts down the program."
