Another rare upload I found on the web that is missing on TPB.  This is PTC's Pro Engineer 4.0 (F000), which means this is not a post production or beta, this is the final release of 4.0.  

I installed it and ran it, seems to work fine.  The crack for PROe and Mechanica will register as a virus variant with NOD32, but rest assured that it caused no harm and is a false positive.  

This is not my work, I am just uploading this torrent on TPB so users can have acces to this great release.

Please seed this great release, all the ones I see on here are pre-production releases.

Forgot to mention, tested and works on Windows 7 final, 64-bit.

Create folder in My Documents called "ProELicense" and place the license.dat and ProEWF3MxxxWF4_crk.exe files here.

After burning ISO images to CD, start the installation of ProE. NOTE: the first install screen will contain your Hostname and HostID information at the bottom. Write this down before continuing! Do not continue install until step 4.

Open "license.dat" (the one you just put in ProELicense) in any text editor and change all strings "YOURHOST_ID" with the HostID that you copied from the first install screen. Save and close this file.

Continue install of ProE WF4 F000 using "license.dat" as "Nodelocked License File (No Server running)" - you will have to browse to the new folder location. You can choose to install ProMechanica with this install. Complete insallation.

After install is complete run ProEWF3MxxxWF4crk.exe

Wait for system messages "Pro/ENGINEER 3: successsfully patched!" "Pro/Mechanica 3: successsfully patched!"

Click OK That's all..

P.S. If you did not install Pro/Mechanica you will get a message "Pro/Mechanica 3: product not installed or files not found!"

Click OK
