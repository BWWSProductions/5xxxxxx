_________________________________________

Here for your musical enjoyment are 18 classic hits 
from that magical decade of the sixties, an era when 
the "baby boomers" of post - World War II finally grew 
up (if they ever did) and came into their own, and when 
their motto, in the words of a classic Cole Porter
standard, could have been "Anything Goes", 
and proberbly was (just kidding).
