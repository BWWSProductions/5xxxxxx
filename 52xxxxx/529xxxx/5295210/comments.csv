[M],vicerock,2010-01-22T18:27Z,"zzzonked yeh after that movie the collector myself it should be released this month because it was in cinemas about october and it takes about 3/4 months to come out on dvd i think looks a good film the cam was to dark to watch but you could get the idea of the movie plus i removed 2012 because i dont think it was a dvdrip because the dvd for 2012 is not out untill march so sorry to the people who dl 2012 and i have noticed the pproblem i,ve been having i,ve tried differant ripping programs but still have a problem but when i view these movies on the tv using portable harddrive usb they seem ok on the tv o and zzzonked have,nt came across cabin fever 2 yet mate i have a couple of movies converted like the red baron wich i will post next it seems ok to me"
