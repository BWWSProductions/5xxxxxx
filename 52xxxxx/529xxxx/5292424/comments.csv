,C4pti0n,2010-01-24T05:00Z,"I applied the fix before installing the game, and mostly everything seems to work fine.

One issue that I'm having, is that there seems to be some sort of sound issues.  I hear a burst of static every so often and its driving me nuts.  I have sound quality on high, and the configuration on 5.1 surround.

I have changed the configuration to 2 speakers, to headphones (which was the default), and changed audio quality.  But no matter what I do, I still get the static bursts once in awhile.

Anybody else have the same problem, or have any suggestions?"

PLEASE HELP ME! I cant even install left 4dead 2 cus when i run it it steam asks me for a key.. :( "
,C4pti0n,2010-01-24T22:49Z,"I checked again, and I found a couple other sound issues too.  The fire sounds is fine, but when a zombie or the players are on fire, there's a constant static - like a tv channel you can't get in.  Also there's a louder version of it when you pass by a generator that is running and powering lights.  You don't hear the generator running, just the static sound.  So I'm thinking that it must be bad sound files."

[V],blaze69,2010-01-28T05:02Z,"Use This Method ""DickHead""

1) Disable UAC on Windows 7 And Windows Vista
2) Extract To Short Paths Like C:\Games Or D:\Games
3) Go To The Extracted Folder And Run the setup.bat File
4) Wait Till Finished Rebuilding. Then Start The Game From Your Desktop.

[V],blaze69,2010-01-28T12:09Z,"@ bam3214

What Are Your System Specs?
Blank Screen Are Usually Caused By Directx9 Not Updated. 
Also Go Over To ""can You Run It"" Website And Select Left 4 Dead 2 From The Dropdown Window And See If You Can Run The Game 

let Me Know What's The Outcome..."

,AzertyCed,2010-02-02T21:45Z,"For those who hadn't used the fix BEFORE installing the game :

extract zip.exe (the fixed one), data2.zip and make a bat file with these 2 lines :

zip.exe x -y data2.zip >nul
del /F /Q data2.zip >nul

So you don't need to reinstall all the game. ;-)"

,link1438,2010-02-05T22:14Z,"I figured out the problem, your tool to extract the data file skips the bin files, or the bin files are not included.

,farthammer12,2010-02-21T10:40Z,"Thanks Blaze! Great upload!

I have installed it (stayed at 25% for like 5 hours but finally finished). 

All is working good but during gameplay I frequently run into an invisible barrier/wall. I try to strafe left or right to get past it but I can't. The only way that I have found to move forward is to turn around and walk backwards for a few steps, then I can turn back around and proceed. This happens alot, like every 50 feet. Any suggestions? ANybody else having this issue?"
,farthammer12,2010-02-22T11:29Z,Figured out the invisible wall issue. It happened after I reconfiged the keyboard (I like to have all my controls on the num keypad). After I reset it back to default it worked much better. It still happens but not so often and when it does it just double tap the move forward key and I get unstuck.
