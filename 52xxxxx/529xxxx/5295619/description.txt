Bureau of Alien Detectors is an American animated series that once aired on the UPN network's weekend-morning cartoon block UPN Kids. Repeats of the series were aired as part of Jetix on Toon Disney.

Bureau of Alien Detectors was a animated show that aired in 1996 on UPN as part of their Saturday Morning Programming Block, UPN KIDS, which is now defunct because of apparent problems from UPN. This show only aired for one season and no second season was made. The producer of this show was Saban International. There hasn't been any word on if the show will be in reruns or on VHS or DVD. Also I'd like to add that this show aired on Fox Kids U.K. in 2004 .
