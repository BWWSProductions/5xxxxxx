This is the latest single from Example the LDN rap/electro/grime/jungle/dub artist. Different to his previous style of material, with an air of Calvin Harris apparent to the song. As of the 19/01/10 it was #5 in the UK charts, what position will it be this Sunday when the Official Top 40 are announced?
