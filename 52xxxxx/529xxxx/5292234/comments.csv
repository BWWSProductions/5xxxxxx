,Netot12345,2010-04-08T11:57Z,"nvm, 2 min google fixed it, all working now. You were right and i am stupid. (CD drive latter needed to be the lowest of all cd drives )"
,ZeMovinPixxle,2010-05-09T14:09Z,"now.. how do i get it to work anyway?
there are two files (.mds and .mdf). I renamed the .mds to.mdf and the mdf to mds. the game works know but the music doesnt. do i have to burn it on cd or what?"
,sharpnova,2010-09-16T14:04Z,"Stupid nigger.. why the fuck would you upload the Australian-Asian version?

At the start of the install it told me this version will not install on my language version of Windows.

I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit set to English I guess.

Dumb fuck. Don't upload dogshit."
,vinax522,2011-01-07T18:50Z,"just download/ update your O.S. language pack i guess... c"",)"
,sijodk,2011-01-17T21:50Z,"sorry if this is a n00b question, but can anybody direct me to an appropriate language pack for WinXP pro? From what I find with google it seems Microsoft wants money for it and I can't find a torrent."
,juhz,2011-02-01T14:05Z,I thought you aussies speak English. Apparently I was wrong. A waste of time.
,LizardGamer,2011-06-06T02:32Z,"juhz, your an idiot fag"
,gxfjlvg,2011-07-12T17:56Z,@sijodk AFAIK Win Xp does not support language packs. Try other torrent of quake that will work just fine on your XP machine.
