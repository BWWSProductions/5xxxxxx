Thanks"
,The_Nude_Monkey,2010-07-30T12:30Z,You say it can encode FLAC-files. That's not true. 
,artificia,2010-08-27T01:36Z,doesn't work for flac
[V],ill88eagle,2010-09-03T02:54Z,"Works just fine for flac when encoding flac to * (provided you have installed the codec somewhere on your system). You just gotta change filetype to *.* in the browse dialogue when selecting the source (flac) files. 

What the heck do you wanna convert mp3 to flac for anyways???

Also, to encode uncompressed PCM (.WAVF) to FLAC use the official FLAC tools: http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html

Its free and a whole lot simpler than any other GUI I've seen in my time"
