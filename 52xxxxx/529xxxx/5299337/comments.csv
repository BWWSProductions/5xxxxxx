,honunet,2010-01-29T04:29Z,"hey listen, sorry to post off topic but I have written TPB and got no response.  Does anybody know if the site https://www.thepiratebay.com is legit?  Note the secure protocol tag and the.com at the end.  I was directed to it once, but have heard nothing since.  It looks identical to this site, only when i go there I get a warning from y browser.  Anybody know the deal?  thaks in advance"
[S],velvet.,2010-01-29T04:47Z,"@honunet:

Preferably, use either https://thepiratebay.org or http://thepiratebay.org to access our site.

Using www and/or .com will work, but that is not how the staff and most regular users are logged in, just in case you want to copy and paste the URL to a torrent posting page."
,honunet,2010-01-29T06:25Z,"Okay fantastic velvet thanks thats some good info.  I didnt even notice the www was grayed out in my address bar either.  So no more www or .com and I will have access to a greater amount of material.  And https and http makes little difference since we are not sending any financial details out anyway right?  Thanks, good form"
