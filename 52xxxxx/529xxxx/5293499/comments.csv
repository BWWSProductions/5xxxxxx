I just downloaded this primavera software, but i get an error when i try to install on my windows vista 32 bit it. It says primavera 6.0.msi not found. I checked this same file and it is in the primavera disk that i mounted. I tried to open this file (primavera 6.0.msi) and gives me error again.

Can anyone help me?

Thanks in advance."

Anyone know how to use Primavera P6 without an actual server?  Any help would be appreciated!"
,jbrad2,2010-10-09T17:21Z,"It may not work for any regular desktop OS. It is meant to work on a Server, like 2003, 2008 for a larger organization. So it may work for any 64bit OS but don't look for it to do everything."
