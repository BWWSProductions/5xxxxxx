Product Description:
Rabbids Go Home is a comedy adventure like no other. Departing from the mini-game centric action of previous Rabbids games, Rabbids Go Home features open-world style mission gameplay centered around the Rabbids harebrained scheme to get to the moon. In true Rabbids form this entails over-the-top single player and multiplayer gameplay built around creating a pile made up of everyday and not so everyday items stolen from the consumer-crazed humans of planet Earth, that is literally tall enough to reach the edge of space.
