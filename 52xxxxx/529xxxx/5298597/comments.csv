,Pothead808,2010-01-23T10:15Z,"hey globe, thanks for this :) always trust your rips. will you be upping mass effect 2 any time soon?"
[V],globeplus,2010-01-24T05:43Z,"to pothead808 : i am really sorry forthe incident with the first upload in the dark void game but i didn´t get any error message at the time of the compression and that´s what fouled me , for the moment i started another fantastic RPG with a really nice work absolute complete just the voices missing but in this case giving you a total sensation of freedom playing the game like the player is part of the scenario with all the fantastic ambience sound available like you are really in there , so now i started uploading VENETICA then i will take a look at new games and if everything be ok you can count with a file from me for that game too . Enjoy what you have to play for the moment and soon as possible maybe that one too . Thank you for your comment ."

,evilkabeavil,2010-01-31T10:04Z,yeah i followed the intructions and when i try to run the game i get a error about physxloader.dll please help would like to play this game have heard good things bout it 
,animejester,2010-02-09T17:57Z,"couple of questions:

1. when i start the game I get this message in german (even though the rest of the game is in english as i wanted):

drachentoter die anwendung hat die installierte physx version analysiert und unterschiede mit der zum veroffentlichungs zeitpunkt  aktuellen version festgestellt.

sollten wahrend der ausfuhrung absturze besucht bitte die support-seiten der homepage oder kontaktiert den technischen support. Weitere informationen halt das readme pergament fur euch bereit.

which translates to:

The application has the dragon dead physx installed version and analyzed differences with the published work zeitpunkt current version detected.

should crash during the execution please visit the support pages of the homepage or contact technical support. For more information stop the readme parchment ready for you.

-------

All my physx drivers are upto date - so I am not sure what the issue - perhaps someone that actually speaks german can tell me.

2. There are updates for this game available (1.03 at the time of my writing this).

Which version do I download? the german version? I wonder - because the game is talking to me in german - but then in the readme you are also speaking about other languages so do I have the multi-lang version (ie: english / spanish / italian)?

Also is it a DVD version or a digital version because the patches are again different in that regard.

That is my only gripe with people making rips like this - not enough information about the original files.

If you could answer those - that would be handy thanks."
,animejester,2010-02-09T17:59Z,"Sorry for the double post - but I just wanted to say:

,animejester,2010-02-09T21:15Z,"Ok I tried to go ahead and use the Eng/Ita/Spa patch from the official site - 400+ mb later - the patch won't even run because it can't detect the install.

Is there no way to patch this?

As this game REALLY needs to be patched to be playable.

I mean the game installed fine and I can run it - and if you piss about with the graphics settings you can even get it to look proper.

But there are a shit load of bugs in this game."
,r29mitdude,2010-02-14T19:48Z,"hey globe do you think you can upload a new and improved version cuz this one is very glitchy, i can understand if you dont because you seem very busy, thanx =D"
