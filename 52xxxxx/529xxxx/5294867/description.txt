[::Review::]

Who Made Who is a hard rock album by Australian band AC/DC, released in 1986 as the soundtrack to the Stephen King movie Maximum Overdrive. King would allude to the album's title song in the 1990 revised and expanded edition of his novel The Stand, where a survivor of the novel's flu pandemic changes the lyrics to "Who Made Flu." Three tracks on the album â€” "Who Made Who" and
the instrumentals "D.T." and "Chase the Ace" â€” were newly written and recorded by AC/DC. The rest were taken from the band's previous albums. Only one song, "Ride On," is from the Bon Scott era; the others all feature Brian Johnson. The album has sold 5 million copies in the USA. The album reached #11 in the UK and #33 in the US. Along with the album, the band released a video tape which contained music videos for the songs "Who Made Who", "You Shook Me All Night Long", "Shake Your Foundations", "Hells Bells", and footage from a live performance of "For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)" which was filmed in
Detroit in 1983. The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.
