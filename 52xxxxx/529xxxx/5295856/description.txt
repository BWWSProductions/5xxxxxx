[QUOTE]After spending two years in prison, hijacker Nino Peralta (Gemma) decided to â€œjump smoothâ€. With hidden â€œstashâ€ he managed to start his own business â€“ a small grocery booth. But in the cradle of Italian mafia, Palermo, one just canâ€™t stay away of gangland-style showdowns. In the course of war between two families Nino finds himself put by mistake in the list of the sentenced to death.
In Sicily there has been dominating â€œomertaâ€ law long since â€“ solidarity of silence: going to the police is not allowed, asking pitiless dons for mercy is useless.[/QUOTE]
