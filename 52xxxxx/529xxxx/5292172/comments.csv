If you open the SFX file with WinRAR, and click on the ""Comment"" icon of the WinRAR Toolbar, you can modify the Command list. You can modify it also during the SFX creation, but I regularly forget to do it, so I modify it later...;-)"
,zigzag77,2010-02-22T17:06Z,Clean one. I have installed it on Win7 64 bit and it seems that it runs fine. Thanks a lot!
,janniekjk,2010-02-22T17:39Z,wooow nice! it worked via cammand button (not via fsx command that sucks)

Unfortunately the government has blocked access to TPB from my nation. Using some tricks I can reach it again, but I can't upload torrents anymore. It always say that it's not a .torrent file and I'm stuck there. If I don't find a way to make it work I think I must pass to something else... :-("
