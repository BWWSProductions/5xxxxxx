,Bambikilr,2012-06-03T11:42Z,"Thank you very much. This is a very well done  documentary in a good balance, between both first hand accounts by survivors, as well as actors reenacting reactions and stories of some of the people who have kept journals during this abominable act of violence, far from every rule of humanity towards civilians during warfare. The debate about the Nanking (Nanjing) massacre is still hot and infected, being denied and diminished by many Japanese authorities and ""historians"" to this day. Sadly, this atrocious act done by the invading Japanese troups, is a very much forgotten and ignored part of the modern history, and I can say that there was not one single word in swedish Historybooks about any modern Chinese history, except for the condemnment of Tse Tung's rein. The genocides committed by Cambodia's regime under Pol Pot (roughly 1/4 of the country's population slaughtered, 1.7-2 million people), Rwanda by the majority ethnic group Hutus (20 % of the country's population massacred in a blood bath without comparison in modern history, over 10000 slaughtered per day, by recent counts likely close to 1,2 million people, during a period of only 100 days), are like the Nanking massacre forgotten and ignored events, which should be retold and retold and retold. I have been to Rwanda (2005) and I will never recover completely from the scars of a country that I have seen. I will tell what I have seen as long as I live, to ignorant westerners who do not care about what happens anywhere else in the world. I recommend deeper interest in the Rwandan (1994) and the Cambodian genocide (1975-1979) for everyone. Sorry for the long text. 

Thank you to uploader for a good documentary."
