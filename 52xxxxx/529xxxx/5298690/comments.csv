[V],twentyforty,2010-01-22T12:04Z,"Who else can seed my torrent than me?
Usually, first ones to complain are morons who think that I am stupid enough. I share - but not with anyone. My torrent, my rules. 
Things are not bad, but have reached monstrous proportions. 

So... please... shut up and simply avoid me, this page and my files. Just go."

What goes around comes around. Give and you'll be given.

I am a sort of refugee from ""minimalistic-was-a-star"". Many of my friends, my ""Regulars"" came on TPB following my torrents. It takes a long time not just to make people to ""recognize"" my small-sized stuff, but to adopt specific models of behaviour, when they interact, cooperate one with each other, exchange and, at the end, enjoy shows and movies. 

One thing I have always repeated: Solidarity. We, people from ""Developed countries"" seem like have forgotten too easy what was only five-six years back when majority was on dial-up, wrestling with 2-4 kB/s. 

We also forget how hard is to live far away from all cultural, sociological ""cushions"" our societies have provided for us, be surrounded with unbearable hardness of life, live surrounded by unimaginable poverty, diseases - and a feeling of total disconnection from the rest of the ""shiny"" world, where obviously, no one cares about anything else but themselves. We, who have ""more"" must share with the ones who have less"". Must. Other ""types"" of behaviour are not welcomed - here. People who cannot share could go away, doors are open. Trespassers and punks will be escorted someplace else.

We are the rebels by nature, that's why we are here on place called ""Pirate bay""? not to eat each other's hearts out. We are here because world around is a dark place. People who come here are not the enemies, most of us struggle to survive, and taking just that and that much we need not to feel deprived by injustice. We are here to fight unrighteousness, but not amongst us. Never forget that.

ISSUE has been addresed last week:


Read carefully how someone's kindess makes him a victim.

@htctouch: I bow to your kindness, but, my brother, this is too much, Your ratio should be 1:1 or slightly above, but that looks really sad, seeing you as victim. OK, LIMIT your upload speed, in ALL similar cases.

During the download your ratio should be max. 0.5-0.6. Rest you make later, when you are at 100% - staying as seeder. If you stay to seed some unpopular torrent, IF no one pops-up for 48h you can stop the seeding and remove the torrent. 

If you find the content valuable (some rare movie or show) you can stay as seeder as long as you can, to give others opportunity to find and download something.

what had happen was ..
i had to download some hindi movies at night and also ur release the road .. so the downloadin speed got distributed .. but i limit d hindi movies upload speed n made ur torrent unlimited upload [as i promised sir]
now m done with other movies n nw waiting only for ur releases[movies]
ryt nw m only downloading smokin aces2 n the road [unlimitd upload]""

CONCLUSION:
After someone has done this to htctouch (who struggles with 10 kB/s upload AND download speeds - because that is what he has and he gives to others) expect zero tolerance from me. I was awake the whole last night trying to catch up/nullify TPB's 38h downtime? and didn't see this. 

If I did, down-time would be much longer, and not caused by TPB. 

Also, in the future, if I spot something like that, kind of gang-banging of innocents, you'll feel my response, I promise. If you are not satisfied with things I've just said, please - go away. Internet is a Big place for all of us. And don't come back. Please.

Look, many people - even if they think otherwise - cannot make a distinction between ""normal"" swarm and the swarm where initial-seedeing is performed. They say ""OK, 1 seeder""; but inf"

[V],twentyforty,2010-01-22T14:21Z,"@saxmaster: Not as in US, but in Ireland I guess...namely, meaning of ""chips"" is quite different. Anyhow, in any case, message has been given. Take it or leave it."

Look my friend, I know what you meant by that, but I do not need nor want to be admired. I just want to be treated back, with respect I have shown to each one of you who has been able to write a comment comprised of more than one word.

This first guy spoke plain rubbish and in that time was 30 Rock up with 24 early grabbers, 88 downloads and 19 seeders ? but with 68 Hit&Runs. I cannot wrap my mind how evil one must be to even say such thing, but they have urge to click on button and leave their greasy mark?

Till 12 AM (local noon) I had three torrents up ? my ratio was over 32? something that these guys can only dream about.
I rarely finish the day below 60 ratios, and on busy days as today (Tuesday and Friday) I usually hit 80 or even 100 ratios. Right now I have 72 ratios, and ?they? complain ?bout seeding. Yeah, I kicked them out and they are angry. I hold my promises, you know me from ?back then?, good ones and the bad ones.

These Hit&Runners and hard-fisting morons can go someplace else, anytime, anyhow, right? Eztv swarms are full of them ? only problem is: ETA is there 12 hours. 

I need 2540 seconds to bring file ?up?, what means that I can EVERY hour let out one H264 for people to enjoy. I demonstrated that many times on our old site.

However, I need up to five hours for that ?job? and I cannot understand why people prevent ? themselves. In start their ?financial? gains are substantial and allow them to download as fast can go, BUT they can hold dignity by giving back by seeding afterward and on that way show the respect to other human beings ? including me."
