This is a sermon preached in October 2009 during a Celebration Church service in Hatfield Harare by the former senior pastor Brian Zinatsa who has since moved on.  It is about God's timing in our lives.  He knows when we are ready for certain things to change in our lives.  He is not subject to time, He is not concerned when a lot of time has passed by.  God plays His part in our lives and it is up to us to recognize when our kairos time has come.
