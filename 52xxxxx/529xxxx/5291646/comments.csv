[V],kentucky-kid,2010-01-22T05:22Z,"Ninja_Squirrel
yup. :)

prolly because other languages was only installed on ultimate, since most uses prefer ultimate, compared to the rest. :)"

@Varcalox
Clean install means formatting your Hard drive and installing the OS on a clean partition. When you do this you will loose all your information on it, so its best you back up your files before doing a ""clean install"""

If the Windows 7 does not install or gets all the drivers for your laptop, it doesn't mean your laptop components (cd drive, card readers or usb ports) are spoil or gone for good but you would have to go to hp website and download the drivers for your laptop based on the specified OS you are using (Windows 7).

Just some question.

How it is with version of this Windows 7. Is there only one version and then just updates? In Vista there was some build number.

Is this official version, or just some beta (I am seeing July release while installing)? Official W7 was published in Oct.

,chuckmamuck,2010-03-05T00:45Z,"people asking wether its the final version cus the files are dated 7/14/2009 and not 10/22/2009. it was available for retail on 10/22/2009 and win7 was signed off as finished and RTM (release to manufacture) on 7/14/2009.
basically its the final version, its not going to be dated 10/22/2009 cus it was finished before that date. the os was finished in july so then they had to burn it to disk, create the packaging and do all the shit to get it produced and into retailers hands for october. millions of copies had to be done worldwide in only 3months, its not an overnight process where they finished the os on 10/21/2009 then created millions of copies by magic so you could buy it on 10/22/2009. after july 14th no changes were made to win7, any changes after release are in the form of update, hotfix and service packs.
its the build number that counts, not the date on the files. use regedit in windows and check the build and you'll see its retail build number."

If you have a job of doing that you probably are some sort of an IT konsulant or support guy.. If you are you also should know that the way this version is cracked is ilegal..

For those having trouble, make sure you have burned the ISO to disk accurately.  If you don't know how to do that, do a google search, and you will learn, and you will become a strong and noble pirate, just like God wants you to be. ;)

,gurumarkb,2010-07-28T18:26Z,"To Anirudh345:  You probably have a bad burn, for example I burned a WIN7 DVD last summer with build 7600 and it still works perfectly today, another DVD burned a few months ago comes up with install errors (file can't be read) so I threw it out and burned a new DVD from the ISO.  The brand of DVD disk can be a problem with some DVD drives, I use Imation disks in my Samsung SuperWriteMaster drive for best results but other brands/DVD drives combo's may work for you.
To Xtra1979:  I use Nero 8 and it works great for me.  Any program that can burn ISOs and other image formats should work too.  Just don't do any multitasking while the recording is running to avoid errors.  Yes, I know all DVD burners support overrun/underrun protection and will resume burning automatically but I still don't want that happening so I always wait till the burn is done.

Question?  Does this Windows 7  have the WAT remover by Hazar slippstreamed into it or does anyone know what the method of pre-activation is?  Just curious as I have used both the Hazar RemoveWAT 2.2.5 and the Windows 7 Loader eXtreme Edition v3.502 with success so far.

My computer was just updated 4 days ago, and I'm having no problems at all.  

Anyone know what's going on?"

This was installed on two machines, with Windows update set to manual.  I have discovered that Windows update somehow reset itself to full Automatic on both machines.  [how the hell did it do that???]

My wife's machine updated itself yesterday and the OS was flagged as an invalid copy.  In order to restore full functionality she now has to buy a licensed copy from Microsoft.

My machine is still working fine, but it hasn't updated since 4 days ago.  I have turned Automatic update back to manual.

Does anyone know how to restore my wife's machine to a valid copy and/or prevent my machine from being flagged as invalid?"

I hope I didn't kill this torrent with my earlier comment, because it's an awesome upload.
