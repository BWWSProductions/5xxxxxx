O frabjous day! Calloo! Callay!

(Insert assorted happy dance and squeals of glee icons here)

Thank You, jerry!

Sharing episodes of Season 2 (which you were kind enough to make available to us) with young people, it's fun to watch them go ""Oh, so THAT's where (this or that) came from!""

The series is chock-a-block with little reminders of just how much every comic actor - every comedian of any flavor - is indebted to Walter Brennan - whether they know who he is or not!

At the risk of offending apologists who will prefer to consider him a ""product of his culture,"" there's also plenty of pondering potential in the paradox of the immense, awesome talents of Brennan the actor - and the unabashedly bigoted, proudly ignorant, intractably wacko matrix of attitudes, opinions and beliefs possessed by Brennan the man (or possessing him, depending on one's own AOB collection).

Yes, like D.W. Griffith!

Those who like their irony extra-wry with a twist will enjoy reflecting that in the demographic cyber-reality that is Modern Today, the lion's share of those who, thanks to your generosity, have the opportunity to discover and delight in Ol' Grandpappy Amos - that 85 or so % of global population - are those of us whom Brennan the man - had he had his way,  would today still be  relegated to separate entrances, restrooms and water fountains! 

Anyway, Thank You, Jerry, and if you are still reading, Thank You again - for your patience and tolerance of the Brevity Impaired! :D"

I have 24 episodes ripped and named. Perhaps another week I will have the last two discs to rip. You see I get the DVD s from a popular movie club and I get them one at a time. See everyone soon! "

Thanks for the upload Jerry!"
