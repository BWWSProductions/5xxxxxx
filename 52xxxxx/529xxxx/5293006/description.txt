NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

Here we go this time with the book of eli......for our video we used LU's (thanks) as it was the best todate.

The video itself is nothing special, low bitrate, small res etc.....also the colouring is weird on it in some parts, but i believe thats how the film is made (same as daybreakers weird colouring).

The audio is our own, and sounds pretty good...loving the new toy

We've done some work on the video and then basically synced up our audio.....which wasn't easy due to the video quality, but never the less we got it done.

Enjoy until our V2 comes out (once better video is available)

*****IMHO...i would wait for a better copy (the movie deserves a better copy) but this is the best out so far...so for those who can't wait...enjoy*****

OR WE CAN GO TO THE CINEMA & SUPPORT THIS MOVIE :)
