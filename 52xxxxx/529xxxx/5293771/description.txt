Lucky People Center International takes us on a journey around the world through human souls. Music's rhythms and the film's pulsing form reminiscent of the music video aesthetics and gives the documentary a new face. The film traveled around the world for two years to find people and lifestyles that reflect the world before 2000. The people we meet in the film gives us the various entrances to faith and vitality and shows different approaches in a world that is changing at a fast pace. Dreams, searching and critical thinking becomes a matter concerning all life on earth. We meet voodoo powers, a brain researcher's investigative methods, Buddhist view of death, a former porn star's thoughts on the pleasure, a bank official's ecstatic needs and much much more bound together by the music's rhythms and the gibbon monkeys song.
