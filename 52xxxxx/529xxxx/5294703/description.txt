Kyokon densetsu: Utsukushiki nazo

Funny movie about a (private?) army in Japan, where the young recruit Shinohara is assigned to the older soldier Takizawa. They learn that the country is more important than then live of the soldiers. This is best shows with the very nice line in the movie: "Japanese of origin do not just love. They have a passion. They yearn and sacrifice their body.". 

The older soldier learns the recruit everything and they share a room. At night the master uses the services provided by the recruit, even they aren't gay, which is common in this army. At night this is a lot of action in the beds, which is very proper displayed in this movie.
