For me, the best of Eliot's plays. More natural -
less stylised - than the others. This production
flows along quite nicely.

Superficially a comedy of manners, a party host's
spouse has gone missing, guests are arriving and
appearances have to be maintained. The uninvited
guest, a psychiatrist, arrives, sets things to
rights, and the host's mistress moves on.

The deeper theme is that, having made commitments,
we should make the best of things. Which seems to
me to be Eliot's conscience playing up about his
troubled first marriage. Here matters are resolved.
In life his wife died in the lunatic asylum to
which he'd had her committed.
