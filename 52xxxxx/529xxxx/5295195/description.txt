Alex welcomes back to the show Godfrey Bloom [2nd hour, into 1st part of 3rd], a member of the European Parliament for Yorkshire and the Humber for the United Kingdom Independence Party. Mr. Bloom last appeared on the Alex Jones Show on December 28, 2009. On the show, he stressed that the global warming controversy is a scam and accused the UK parliament giving away legal powers to the European Union.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
