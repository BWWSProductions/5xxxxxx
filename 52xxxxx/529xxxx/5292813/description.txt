The Buried Life S01E01 WS DSR Xvid-Dodecahedron [Dodecahedron]

Episode 1: Attend A Party At The Playboy Mansion

"The Buried Life: What Do You Want To Do Before You Die?" tells the story of four friends who make a list of 100 things to do before you die and their journey across North America to accomplish it. The film was shot throughout Canada and United States including: Nevada, California, Oregon, Idaho, British Columbia and Washington. The idea for the name originated from an 1852 Matthew Arnold poem entitled "The Buried Life".

On April 18, 2009 an article in The New York Times announced that a serial television version of their documentary entited "The Buried Life" was chosen by MTV for development. The show has been selected as a flagship reality program that will usher in MTV's shift away from the superficial content currently dominating the network's programming towards the production of more socially conscious media. The network has ordered eight weekly half-hour episodes.

About this episode:

"We never expected this episode to see the light of day. It's one of the more "Hollywood" items on the list and required a ridiculous plan to attempt to cross off. When Playboy found out what happened, they didn't want us to air it. Our last hope was a hand-written note to Hugh Hefner. It took us 4 hours to write and with it we sent a copy of the episode you'll see tonight. It took a while to get a response, but eventually he said yes."
