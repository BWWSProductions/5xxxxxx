Sometimes people choose the wrong virus scanner to use, that's not very good at detection, and so this is good for when your virus scanner fails, OR your working on someone's computer, and they DON'T EVEN HAVE A VIRUS SCANNER INSTALLED!!

and the computer is so badly infected that you can't install a virus scanner, so these are good, for that too. :-) 

PS: inside the autoplay directory, there are some other small programs, I wasn't going to keep, but forgot to delete, but they work too, they just aren't on the main program."
