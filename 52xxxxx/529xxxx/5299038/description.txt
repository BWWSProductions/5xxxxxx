        Southern Texas. Savannah and  Cooper, a young couple  in love,
        drive through the desert in a black 70s Cadillac  convertible.
        Unaware that they are being followed, they check into a  motel
        at the Mexican border. When Savannah leaves to buy food, a cop
        sneaks into the room, pulls his gun on Cooper, accuses him  of
        murder and tries to arrest  him. But Savannah, who had  become
        suspicious, manages to turn the tables: She surprises the cop,
        ties him  up and  frees Cooper.  But just  as the young lovers
        jump into their car, a  stranger steps out of the  shadows and
        kills Cooper at point  blank... 
        
        Three weeks  later. Hollywood,  California. In  a hotel  suite
        overlooking the Sunset Strip, a  man is being water boarded by
        a private detective. The information he needs is: "Who  killed
        Babyface?" When the man refuses to cooperate and shows nothing
        but contempt for his  captor, the torture continues.  Layer by
        layer the truth about Cooper alias Babyface is revealed.
