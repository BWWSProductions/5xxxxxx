"Black Angel" is the top gun pilot who reigns supreme on F-16 training flights. Unfortunately, he is also a psycho and he takes off with a full load of nukes to usher in the apocalypse. 

From time to time, U.S. fighter pilots have been known to develop a messianic complex. Trainee Eddie Gordon (William O'Leary) goes a bit farther than that: he begins fantasizing that he's the Angel of Death. Armed with nuclear weaponry, Gordon flies toward Las Vegas, intending to bomb "sin city" back to the stone age. It is up to squadron leader Matt Ryan (Peter Strauss) to stop him.
