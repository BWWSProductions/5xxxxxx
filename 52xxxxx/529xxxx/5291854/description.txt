In the same way that Ubisoft converted Prince of Persia: Warrior Within to Prince of Persia Revelations for the PlayStation Portable, so too has it released an updated version of Two Thrones for the Wii and PSP with Prince of Persia Rival Swords. Rival Swords retains the essence of what made Two Thrones such a great game in 2005. But rereleasing a game at full price a year and a half after the original doesn't come without expectations, and the added motion-sensing controls do little to justify the lack of a graphical update or the omission of meaningful extras.
