Maybe you only should add in the end of the simplified setup info (step 19) that the OS 9 must be installed to newly created volume. BTW I copied the System Folder from OS9 image at first boot. Works very well for now, but I haven't fully checked it yet. I guess it might be some shorter version. Isn't it? "
,subnet_mask,2010-01-22T19:47Z,"Sorry, I just noticed the UPDATE to step 18 in your torrent description. Forget the suggestion and question in my first post. "
,subnet_mask,2010-01-22T20:12Z,"One more note. In the longer version of Setup Manual can be found 
For ?Ethernet Interface? enter ?slirp? 
but in the shorter version it is ""slurp"""
,Iso_Soul,2010-01-23T03:22Z,"To subnet_mask:

Sorry about the typo, it is spelled  slirp
:)"
,subnet_mask,2010-01-24T02:45Z,"Thanks Iso_Soul. ""slirp"" was my final choice also. 
I wish you success with this project! "
,dropacid,2010-01-31T06:49Z,"thanks a lot for this, i deleted my copy awhile back to save space, and have been looking for this again

this worked for me only when i didn't follow one of the last steps to delete os9 from the pref file + it also works without the .iso locked

does anyone know how to install applications onto this, where is the web browser?"
,Iso_Soul,2010-02-07T08:12Z,"To dropacid:

OS 9 doesn't have a default browser but you may use the program, ""Classilla"". http://www.floodgap.com/software/classilla/"

,julialy,2010-08-28T22:14Z,This is not fake...
,reynira,2011-03-03T20:13Z,"Thanks, I love this! Thanks to this, I got OS 9 up and running on my Mac Mini on OS X Snow Leopard or 10.6.6."
,beth286,2011-05-15T04:05Z,The application just closes as soon as I open it. From what I've read this has something to do with the ROM file not being compatible. I was super excited for this. I hope I can get it to work. =(
,beth286,2011-05-15T04:32Z,"Okay, I had to drag the ROM file out of the ROM folder in order to get the app to start-up. It works great now! Thanks so much!"
