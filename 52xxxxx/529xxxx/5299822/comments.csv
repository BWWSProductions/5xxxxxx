,RDaneel20,2010-09-01T12:37Z,Why? What is this? 
,XacTactX,2012-02-21T06:19Z,"The user ^^^ wrote smashed because (I didn't download it, but 99% chance I'm right) the dynamic range has been made nonexistent and it clips like crazy. I just downloaded Sade Ultimate Collection, and the thing pops every time the music clips. These reissues don't mean ""better"", they just mean ""louder"". Avoid them like the plague.

BTW as I wrote above this album is not for me, but major thanks to the uploader for writing that it is a reissue in the comments. I like to see this, it saves me from downloading the torrent for no reason. Thank you. :)"
