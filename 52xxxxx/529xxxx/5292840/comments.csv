,scoper156,2010-01-20T05:03Z,"jpineda23 first you must plug your phone or ipod into your computer (itunes). Then extract the game. It will show as an mp3. Which will then go to your apps section. Then you must go to cydia (jailbroken ipod/phone only) then install OPENSSH, or Installous. Then you extract the ipa. Then it will be in itunes. So with OPENSSH install the ipa. (via itunes!) I KNOW THIS ISNT MY TORRENT BUT WRITE A COMMENT AND I WILL REPLY! (seeding for 3 months top)"

1. Jailbreak your iPhone with blackra1n.
2. Download and install Cydia
3. Open Cydia, goto Manage, Sources, Edit, Add, and add cydia.hackulo.us
4. Click done and search for App Sync for 3.1 and install.
5. Download the Torrent
6. Open one of the .rar files and extract to your desktop
7. Double click the Grand Theft Auto - Chinatown Wars 1.0-poedgirl[C4iD].ipa.  This will add it to your iTunes application library.
8. Sync your iPhone/iPod Touch and your good to go!

Enjoy.  Thanks for the great torrent and saving me $10."
