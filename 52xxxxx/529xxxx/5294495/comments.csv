Good upload, this will be most interesting.

I'm intregued as to the phenomena mentioned, indeed.

I have my 'theories' already so putting them up to this will be enjoyable.

Needed something a bit more stimulating than the majority of material recently, National Geographic is certainly good intellectual fare but sometimes not as stretching as i like.

Splendid, splendid, splendid."

But very interesting nonetheless.

Some aspects to follow up on from Australian prehistory definitely.

Good programme. ****"
