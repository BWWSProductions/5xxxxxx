VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
SPECIAL EDITION
SEASON 4 VOLUME 2 DVD 5
NTSC


We've all waited impatiently while a certain video company, stuck in the last century, put off the release of the final season of Voyage, and we've waited some more for the second half of season four.

Well... THE WAITING IS OVER!

The Seaview first sailed across American TV screens on September 14, 1964.
Now, 45 years later, TooleMan TV presents the final 13 episodes of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.
All episodes have been remastered from excellent broadcast recordings for the best video and audio.
These are FULL RESOLUTION NTSC DVD's.

Included:

- all 13 full-length episodes of the second half of season four
- ABC-TV's "In Color" opener before each episode
- uncut season four opening theme including "brought to you by..."
- previews of the next episode, where available



DVD 5 contains two excellent episodes that span the range of Voyage plots, from an alien invasion to cold war espionage, in fantastic productions that only the genius of Irwin Allen could bring to the small screen.


ATTACK!
