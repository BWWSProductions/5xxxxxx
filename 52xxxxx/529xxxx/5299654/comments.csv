,BigPD,2010-02-09T03:52Z,"You're going to have a missing dll error the first time you run the game, but don't fret. This website has the missing dll for download.

http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?d3dx9_30

Just download the zip, extract the folder to, well, doesn't matter, then copy the dll in the folder into the games directory. 

Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\CAPCOM\Resident Evil 4

I'm running 64 bit, that why it program files (x86). Anyways, GREAT torrent, enjoy! :)
