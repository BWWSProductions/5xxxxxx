,waterbaby1701,2010-01-20T05:10Z,How do you play a .mov  i can only play .avi and no one is uploading cbb in .avi right now.
,theredbarronsf,2010-01-20T05:29Z,"Good upload, thank you :)"
,jaidi,2010-01-20T09:19Z,Thanks again to the uploader. I am sure that I speak for all the downloaders when I say that we are very very grateful for your efforts. 
,jaidi,2010-01-20T09:29Z,Waterbaby - don't know what operating system you have or movie player but I would suggest that you download another player - there are many good ones that play all file types. Good luck!
,I_Like_Toast,2010-01-20T17:36Z,"waterbaby1701 - Like jaidi said, try another player. I suggest trying VLC player."
,datalink,2010-01-21T05:57Z,Don't ge me wrong I appreciate the upload and many thanks to the Uploader but I too find myself having to change to an AVI through a lengthy process.  Not all of us watch this on a PC - my media player does not play .mov I prefer to watch it on my tv rather than have the family stand around a laptop screen.   There is also synch issues is the U/L able to rectify this yet?
