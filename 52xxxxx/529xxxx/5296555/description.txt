[::Review::]

AC/DC Live is a 1992 album by Australian hard rock band, AC/DC. It was released both as a single album and as a double album (known as AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition). The album has been considered the closest thing to a greatest hits album in the AC/DC catalogue. A AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition was released a month after the single-disc version, in a slipcased two-disc "book" (similar in shape to old CD longboxes) and containing an AC/DC dollar note.

The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.
