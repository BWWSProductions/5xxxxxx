I sometimes wondered if all the images in the movie were just movie scenes or even real news scenes from 1995. The difference is hard to tell!!

It's also super that big parts of this movie were indeed filmed on location in South-Africa.

This soundtrack with the african music influence must be one of the best ever made for a movie!"
