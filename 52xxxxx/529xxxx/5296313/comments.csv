,Goldwingerjk,2010-02-01T15:12Z,Avast report that Keygen-invisible is infected with the worm named Win32:Malware-gen
,PoDuck,2010-02-21T09:11Z,I get the same virus warning from Avast.  Win32:malware-gen
,Claude99,2010-03-17T18:57Z,"The Torrent is infected with the infosealing worm
in the keygen"
,3r1c,2010-05-07T21:53Z,"There is no virus in this.

Its a false positive.
Bad antivirus companies label every crack/keygen as a virus even if its safe.

See this threat expert report from a good company that actually reviews the files, you see it makes no changes to the system.
