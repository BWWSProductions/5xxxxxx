Fourteen-year-old Tyler encounters an alien ship which
makes him appear older, inexplicably turns him into a
"Skyrunner" with incomprehensible powers. This turns his high school life upside down, and may enable him to help his slightly clueless older brother's love life. After he is abducted by beings who intend to takeover of Earth, he must depend on his inept, lovelorn, and goofy brother to rescue him.
