Anata-ga suki desu, dai suki desu 

What no one ever though happened. A Japanese movie about boys being gay, uncensored, and explicit. It is a hit: the movie is not only a must for Japanese gays struggling with their coming out, but also a great drama. The cast plays very natural and it is a movie to watch over and over again without getting bored. The use of light and darkness makes it a kind of Rembrandt-like picture.
