,Asuraku,2010-01-24T21:14Z,"Yeah, it doesn't take 3 days for a tracker to pick your shit up... k'mon now."
,Dondigital,2010-01-26T10:35Z,"For everybody who's still waiting for this to be seeded, don't bother. Take a quick walk over to http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/697 and down load the latest version of Blue Crab. This will be a demo version. Download Serial Box and Serial Reader, if don't have it already. Plug in the serial for 4.9.18 and hey presto, you have a fully working one! Use Little Snitch to stop it phoning home but if you like it that much it is only $25!
Life made easy."

[T],Mac-Sparrow,2010-01-29T10:16Z,"@Dondigital
Nice advertising. Do you think people were in here, if they wanted to pay for the apps?"
,Dondigital,2010-01-31T13:08Z,"To Mac-Sparrow

It was no advertising just a much quicker way of getting a working version of Blue Crab than waiting for you to seed the bloody thing!
The comment about paying was me being ironic, if you understands what that means!

I realize you left your comment about 2 years ago, but you used 'ironic' incorrectly then called someone else out for not knowing what it means. You will never see this but i feel better now. Bye"
