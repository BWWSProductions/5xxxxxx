This is just a collection I threw together, in hopes others may find one of the greatest artists, I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. It contains most of his videos as well as lyrics and MP3s, along with his album.

For more information about Dan Bull or if you just want to contact Dan, please add him on Facebook, Myspace, or Twitter. I also suggest checking out http://www.freshnut.co.uk/index.php?p=shop where you can donate to Dan or buy his album. (As well as download it but if you're reading this you've probably already downloaded it.)
