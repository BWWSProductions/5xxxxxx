,Barb15,2012-01-24T17:43Z,"Already bought his album, downloading your version to help seed anyway though.

Anybody downloading this for the first time: If you really enjoy the music, please consider helping him make more by donating a little something, even if it's only a dollar or 2, here: http://itsdanbull.com/shop/

Every little helps :)"
,JackOfSparrows,2012-01-29T03:08Z,I love this guy. I just donated 10 British whatevers to him (pounds or Euros or whatever) specifically because he gives his shit away for free.
,sike246,2012-04-25T10:51Z,Cheers for this. Will carry on seeding for a couple of weeks
