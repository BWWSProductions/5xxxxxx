Southern Texas. Savannah and Cooper, a young couple in love, drive through the desert in a black 70s Cadillac convertible. Unaware that they are being followed, they check into a motel at the Mexican border. When Savannah leaves to buy food, a cop sneaks into the room, pulls his gun on Cooper, accuses him of murder and tries to arrest him. But Savannah, who had become suspicious, manages to turn the tables: She surprises the cop, ties him up and frees Cooper. But just as the young lovers jump into their car, a stranger steps out of the shadows and kills Cooper at point blank... Three weeks later.
