Why didn't you post a separate torrent for each movie instead?
Then you could have kept the block size much smaller."
,Bombardem,2010-01-20T07:58Z,"Agreed if that were true, but this is 109 files and you can pick and choose whatever you like or dont like from the list, whether you want the art or not, etc. I'd much rather see something like this than him spam the site with 50 piece of shit B movies like some of these asshole do..."
,happytanker,2010-01-21T16:46Z,i would just be grateful for some seeders as i love these films and i am stuck on 0.5% downloaded!
,TVS-DIVINE-LIGHT,2010-04-14T07:37Z,"To velvet- If you don't want it don't use it and go away.
To Bombardem-These movies are not shit they
kick ass and are cooler than snake skin.

I am always amazed when some people bitch at things that are free.

To everyone else-This torrent is going strong
and I hope you have a good time. 
Special thanks to the seeders you are the
kindred spirit. Thank you
