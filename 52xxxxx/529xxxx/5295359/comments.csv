If you use the activation.iso you'll be fine.  The xbox will stay in unstealthed mode until it is either power cycled or just switched off.  Swapping discs won't cause a problem.

Its the same as forza 3 with the disc swapping in there."

has anyone encountered this problem - when launching the game it says ""a system update is required to play this game"" - it then tries to do an update and fails.
I have the latest dashboard version (i downpatch to ixtreme v4 all my games as i dont go online and its easier than updating a liteon drive) all other recent games work fine (darksiders for example)
I had this problem with dragon age origins but i updated to latest dashboard version then and it played fine - thing is i now have the latest version!

*yoyoyoy. I had that problem with tekken 6 . Since the wave 4 thingy, there have been many ways around it. 1 patching 2 new firmware 3 activate.iso disc. when I patched tekken 6 to wave 3 it kept trying to install an update and would not work. It would seem then this game is gonna do the same thing. so stick to the activate.iso disc. there is some more detailed and alternative advise on the tekken 6 torrent page. good luck

There are two discs in this file... ergo you will need two DL discs to burn it on. Each disc is about six and ahalf gigs. Unrar Disc 1 and then copy to your first disc. Then do the same with disc two. Simple as that!

I think you need a ""Active Iso"" disc to insert first before all the games that where released after november 2009. Just search Active Iso, dl it and burn it to a DL disc. Then you just insert that disc before the games and you would see another development. 

Good Luck m8. "
,Spectus,2010-01-26T08:52Z,"Come on everyone who see them selfs as the ultimate experts... havent you been there once when you asked about how to get things right? 
The reason why anyone keeps asking is because one one gives a shit to learn out. Just write answers and you may have been contributed to something instead. I´m not an expert, but i do know a great deal about this. 

- Its 13 gb, use 2 discs for it to fit 
- Wont start up? Try to use Active Iso before inserting the disc into the console (search net for it - dl it and burn it to a disc)
- Language - i will tell as soon as i have tried it out. 

Dont be afraid to ask questions, there is not any question wich is a dumd question. We ALL had questions at the beginning and were greatful for ANY help we could get.  "
,Spectus,2010-01-26T08:56Z,"killcorekid -->>
Yes, you need a DVD-R Dual Layer disc and you need to specify the layers in your burning app. 
(serach the net)

About 13 Gb, you will need two discs in order for the game to fit and be playeble. 
Burn disc 1 on one the first disc and disc 2 on the second. 

I will confirm language and/or real deal when i tried it out. 

We ALL needed help at some point when we started out, so dont be afraid to ask. "

,chamee,2010-02-16T16:25Z,"I've read through all the comments here and I can't find answers about the disc swap. First disc works fine, but when the game asks for disc 2 and I insert it.. nothing happens, except an Xbox popup asking again for disc 2.
Also in the Xbox dashboard it says ""open tray"" when disc 2 is in, is this normal or am I supposed to be able to start the game with disc 2 also, or is it atleast supposed to be recocnized as Mass Effect 2; disc 2?

I don't use activate iso, I use 360WavesPatcher, which has worked until now. I patch all isos to wave 2 since I have iXtreme 1.5. I patched disc 2 to wave 2 also. So I shouldn't need the activate iso disc, but patching to wave 2 didn't seem to work in this case.

Does anyone know what to do with the disc swap?

Disc 1 was burned with ImgBurn at 2.0X or 2.4X (can't remember which speed I used) using a Maxell dvd+r dl. I ran out of discs in between so disc 2 was burned at 2.0X into a Verbatim dvd+r dl.. this shouldn't matter, right?

For the people having trouble burning this game, I wont be able to help much, but I can confirm that disc 1 works. Check the iso with abgx360, I recall abgx360 did some auto fixing on the isos when I ran them through. Use ImgBurn and try 2.0X and 2.4X speeds, Verbatim is propably the best media for Xbox 360, Maxell has also worked for me, though not as reliably. Make sure you use DVD+R DL discs. And maybe you could also try 360WavesPatcher instead of activate iso, if your Xbox can't read the discs. 360WavesPatcher should be used only after checking the isos in abgx360.

Thanks for the uploader and seeders!"

I tried that, but it didnt worked.

When starting the game i put in the activation dics and then disc 1 and everything works fine.

Middle of the game, it asked me to insert disc 2. So I; eject disk 1 -> put in activation disk -> get incorrect disk massage -> put in disk 2 -> get the same incorrect disk massage.

I tried skipping the activation disk when changing from disk 1 to disk 2, that didn't work either.

Before the game starts, the game asked me if I want to update, i picked NO. Should I update my Xbox? wont the updates mess up the modded firmware? "
