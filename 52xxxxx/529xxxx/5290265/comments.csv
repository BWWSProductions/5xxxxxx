[V],twentyforty,2010-01-19T07:30Z,"@prasan: Dear prasan, only you can control your upload speed. I cannot. It is technically and on any possible way - impossible.
Now, my friend, keep going - away, from ne, my torrents and stop to spam with stupidities or I will mail moderators. Enough is enough."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-19T07:47Z,"addendum @prasan:
If you have so awesome download speed and know 'bout torrents, you certainly know that:
Download speed is proportional to your upload s?eed. 

I told you that I measure speed settings of anyone connected - there are no mistakes and people can say what they want, but I know are they telling the truth.

Now, do the math. Please. You cannot put/have your upload speed at 1-3 kB/s and expect something in return. No one is so crazy... well, at least I am not."

[V],twentyforty,2010-01-19T12:37Z,"@pothead: After the How I met.... Chuck was first down (as 720p) and re-encoded as first, but I was throttled down (my upload) by some ungrateful idiots. I was practically choked till I cleared them out. You should watch your swarm, 'cause when 24 season starts, nasties become active more than usual."
