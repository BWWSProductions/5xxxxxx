Instead of getting the other one, I'll buy it when I come across it."

you said that ""there are often encryption issues""
what do you mean? are you using correct codecs?
try VLC player, it plays this movie perfectly! A10 V10"
,Woozy3000,2010-11-16T14:38Z,"is there a reason to seed, if there are no comments and no feedback?"
,OrpheusDude,2011-02-22T04:15Z,"Thank you!  A very important and - as of February 2011 - topcial film for Americans.

Excellent transfer except for minor digital glitch which occurs throughout the entire film (only a small distraction)."

I got a copy from my local library, gonna rip at and post a new clean copy in h264 here within a day or so."
