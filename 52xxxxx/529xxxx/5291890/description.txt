â€œSt. George Shoots the Dragonâ€ is set in 1914 in a village in Serbia on the bank of the river Sava, the natural border with the mighty Austro-Hungarian Empire. The population of the village is divided between two radically opposed factions â€“ the able-bodied potential army recruits and the invalid veterans from the previous two Balkan wars. There is bitter animosity between the two groups.
