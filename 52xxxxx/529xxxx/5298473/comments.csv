I hope that the office isnt drawing to an end as this episode is mostly reflective on the moments throughout the series."
,ady22,2010-01-22T12:45Z,"im confused.com on ABC website it says that s06e13 is called ""secret santa"" but people are saying that this one is reflective of past moments? im looking for s06e14 called ""the banker"""
,Janiac,2010-01-22T13:33Z,"Thanks uploader, great one

In relation to ady22's comment this episode is The Banker which premiered 1/21/10. For NBC it is ep 14 because episode 4 was an hour long ep, part 1 and 2, which they labelled as ep 4 and 5, but as far as internet numbering it is ep 13. Always think one ep behind"
,mrbobtherubberrat,2010-01-22T15:25Z,"Yep this is the episode called the banker. BUT i am afraid its a dreaded clip show.
Thanks VTV excellent quality etc
but if your a fan of the show dont bother downloading. i'm just going to pretend this episode does not exist lol"
,DrBhup666,2010-01-23T00:13Z,"Thanks for the great upload VTV, as always!

Thank you to you too, Janiac for clearing that up. It was absolutely correct and well stated!"
,ady22,2010-01-23T01:29Z,ok cheers people! thx to VTV
,nestleq,2010-01-23T05:04Z,"Internet labeling is retarded. The Banker episode is S06E14, no S06E13. 

Come on people, don't be stupid.
