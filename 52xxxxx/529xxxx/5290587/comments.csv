Not Fake.

352 x 264 is a little small for a 1.53 GB file imo, but it is Bebe's kids."
,Taedeush,2010-08-28T18:26Z,"it`s not a fake, but  carefully read the description. This is a CARTOON. Director Bruce W. Smith, not Thomas Balmes. If you are trying to find it http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1020938/ - try looking elsewhere"
,Taedeush,2010-08-28T18:32Z,THIS IS CARTOON
