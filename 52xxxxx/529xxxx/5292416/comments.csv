,thebadwolf,2010-01-23T14:26Z,Downloading now. Will comment back on how it works.
,thebadwolf,2010-01-23T21:26Z,"Great game. Works like a charm!

1. Just remember to use BetterZip for extraction. For some strange reason the game did not start if used anyther tool to unrar the file.

2. Use the updater to patch the german language to English.

Thanks a ton thenoobish"

,hamerica,2010-01-29T19:41Z,"Hey man, downloaded the game and it works great. It's totally awesome, except that I cannot change video settings options. Any idea what I can do? Also, I can't play online because of CD-Key problems. I had BF2 for PC a while ago, and thus a CD-Key, but I don't have a PC anymore to change the cache data like you proposed. Any suggestions? Btw, will seed this awesomeness!"

,Arnoniem10,2010-03-13T15:18Z,"I also have problems to play online, it tells me that my CD key is not valid or something like that..
Anyone ????"
,Arnoniem10,2010-03-13T15:20Z,"to change the language in english you have to open the file battlefield 2G updater eng. and than he asks to select te file battlefield 2 than you have to put the icon of the game itself into the window of the updater... than he should do it..
i hope you understand it a bit cause my english isn't that good..."
,AFlea34,2010-03-13T16:23Z,"Plz help
I got the game and everything and seeded, but I dont get the updater. I open it choose the Battlefield 2 g file and it closes and the game is still in german"
,Arnoniem10,2010-03-14T12:46Z,"@aflea34: you have to drag the icon of the game (bettlefield 2 g) into the window that opened when you clicked on the updater.. there is a kind of square where you have to drag the icon of the game in... and than you just have to click OK
i hope it's clear!
it worked on my computer... (macbook pro) 
but i still have the problem that i can't play online because my CD key is not valid! "
,k-torrent,2010-03-29T11:03Z,"I found out every problem, from why people can't log in to changing the resolution.

sorry for my bad english"
,MAXIMOLIDER,2010-12-27T18:46Z,The game works perfect! The language patch didn't work at all. But I followed the instructions to change the language in a different way and it worked. But the only problem i have is that I can't play online. When i'm going to join a server it says: CD-Key is not valid. I read that you can join cracked servers but how do I identify those servers? Anyone can help me with this?.
