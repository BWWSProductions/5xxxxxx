GERMAN VERSION For engl. Users I include a little but raw patch for english localisation text
Sorry:
The iPatch finally ends with the message: There is a loop in the chain of patches!
But the modified Program Battlefield 2 e works fine!!)

First TIP:
If you want to modify BF2g to see TEXT in your own native language right click with mouse the game icon to show the package contens.
Then go to the following folder:

trash the files inside the german folder and copy the files from your native language folder INTO THE empty german folder.
(available Text: chinese, dutch, english, french, italian, japanese, korean, polish, spanish, swedish and thai)
For engl. Users the Battlefield 2 g_Updater engl. does this automatically (see above)

Second TIP:
If you dl additional BF 2 Maps from the Internet so control-click/right click w/ mouse the Battlefield 2 icon to show the package contents. Open the folders until you find the following Folder:
ContensResourcestransgamingc_driveProgram FilesEA GAMESBattlefield 2modsbf2Levels
Put additional maps in the Levels folder.....

IF you want to play he BF 2 mod Allied Intent Xtended (AIX 2.0) look at

put the AIX2 MOD and the stats folder in the BF 2 "mods" Folder - Boot up BF 2 and when the menu appears click on "COMMUNITI", then click under "Eigene Spiele/CUSTOM GAMES" and select AIX 2

I`m not an online gamer and I dont have a CD Key there is a solution for online gamers:

1. Install a Windows Version of BF 2 with your valid CD key (Bootcamp or Parallels)
2. Then search for the "cache" folder -> My DocumentsBattlefield 2modsbf2cache
3. Copy this whole cache folder fom Windows to your Mac (USB-Stick or otherwise)
4. Control click right the Mac Version of BF 2 to see the package contens
5. Open the folders until you find the %USERPROFILE% folder
