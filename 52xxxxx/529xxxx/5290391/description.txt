Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (1983)

Monty Python's The Meaning of Life is a 1983 musical comedy film by the Monty Python comedy team. Unlike the two previous films they had made, which had each told a single, more or less coherent story, The Meaning of Life returns to the sketch comedy format of the troupe's original television series, loosely structured as a series of comic skits about the various stages of life, roughly based on the Seven Ages of Man.
