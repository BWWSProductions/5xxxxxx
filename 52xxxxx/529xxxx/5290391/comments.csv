,thewanderlust15,2010-08-13T04:05Z,Audio?/Video? Anyone???  There's 159 seeders on this and no one can comment on anything?  Anyone know if this is the version with The Crimson Permanent Assurance Warning skit at the beginning?
,art_fargunkel,2010-08-31T16:30Z,"It has the ""Crimson Permanent..."" as intro. Good quality, everything's fine."
,Newb787,2011-01-09T23:25Z,"Video very good, a little dark though. 7.5./10
Audio scratchy, somewhat distorted. 4/10"
,efeffess,2011-12-15T02:07Z,"This is completely watchable, indeed. Comments that the video and audio are lower than today's standards, considering this was produced in 1983, are completely inane and should be ignored if you, the prospective downloader, have any desire to retain even a shred of your sanity (or, have you such a thing at this stage in your own life, reputation).

Adding to the fact this particular endeavour has lots of boobies, it is this writer's opinion that, unlike this film, such issues are completely meaningless."
