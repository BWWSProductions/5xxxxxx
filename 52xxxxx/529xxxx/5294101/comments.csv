right now, instead of this."
,karateman77,2010-01-28T19:27Z,"Jahnee - I am currently employed by DeMontfort University in England as a Professor of Chemistry and I think 2012 is a fantastic film...scientifically illiterate i am not, however, you, in contrast, are a narrow minded fuckwit. "
,u2r1u4s3,2010-01-30T05:46Z,"You can not compare 2012 and Creation. 2012 is a fantasy story while Creation is a true personal story.

I watched both and loved the Creation a lot better.
Very good movie both in terms of content and direction."
,Fender409,2010-03-20T07:21Z,"just because something has been ""proven"" to exist, doesn't mean its 100% true.  you have to consider all possible aspects of origin, not just believe the preferable one such as evolution or creationism"

owned lol"
,jimmyg4life,2011-03-04T03:42Z,"Evolution has been proven and is proven, creation is for the week of mind who do not want to search and find answers that can be based on facts. Religion is much like football, you root for your home team largely dependent on the geographical location you were born in much the same way you pick which god you ""root"" for depending on where you were born. Unless of course you have a strong and courious mind then you realize all religion is man made just like the gods :-( "
