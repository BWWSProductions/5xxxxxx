         In the post-apocalyptic world, man's mysterious relics        
         meet very different fates, including those in a site in       
         the U.S. called the "Crypt of Civilization". Other crypts,    
         safes, and time capsules are exposed to new threats. An       
         abandoned Mental Hospital in Connecticut offers clues         
         regarding man's ability to preserve records. Can the          
         military training given to Marine Corps dogs help them        
          succeed in the wild?
