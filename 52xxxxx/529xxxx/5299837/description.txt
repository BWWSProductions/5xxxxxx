A sequel to the Star Wars parody "Blue Harvest," this special episode of the unabashedly off-color animated series features the dysfunctional Griffin family and their friends as the characters in The Empire Strikes Back. Peter begins sharing the story with his family during a power outage, and, in this retelling, he stars as Han Solo, with Chris as Luke Skywalker, Lois as Princess Leia and Stewie as (who else?) Darth Vader.

This torrent is a full resolution blu-ray rip. Black bars were cropped out automatically. This is the best looking rip I've ever seen and hopefully everyone agrees. The program did not detect subtitles, but it does have the commentary track. Enjoy.
