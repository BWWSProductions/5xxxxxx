ZOEgirl was a Christian pop rock band. It was formed of singers Chrissy Conway-Katina, Alisa Childers and Kristin Swinford-Schweain. In 2002, ZOEgirl received a GMA Dove Award for New Artist of the Year. Before disbanding, the band released three more studio albums, as well as a remix album and a limited edition single

ZOEgirl's first, self-titled release was released on August 15, 2000. While most of the songs talk about their relationship with God, "Give Me One Reason" is about refusing to choose someone else over God, and "Stop Right There" is written to Satan about not being his property, and instead walk towards Jesus.

"I Believe" and "Living For You" both obtained the #4 position on the Adult Contemporary chart, while "Anything Is Possible" obtained the #8 position on the Contemporary Hits chart. The album itself peaked at position #8 on the Billboard Heatseeker's Chart.
