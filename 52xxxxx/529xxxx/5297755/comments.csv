,protongeek,2010-01-22T06:46Z,But then again the burningrabbit kinda answers my question doesnt it ?
,protongeek,2010-01-22T06:49Z,For all my conservative brethren out there what did you all think of the Mass election ? Im smiling from ear to ear. Obama is effectively a one term president IF he doesnt reevaluate his leftist views. If he does he will win a second term if he doesnt hes done. I would go so far to say Bart Simpson could run against him and win if Obama doesnt changed his direction.
