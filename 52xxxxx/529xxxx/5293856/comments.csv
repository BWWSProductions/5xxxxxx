,rumbarumping,2010-02-01T09:54Z,Thank you. This show sounds interesting :)
,k3nd00d,2010-02-02T05:38Z,This week's Man vs. Wild looks like it will essentially copy Apocalypse Man. Dangerous and stupid stunts and all. Lame.
,TrashCompaqtor,2010-05-07T04:19Z,This is the only source I found on the internet for this show.  Thanks!!!
,cormaczoso,2012-05-26T01:18Z,"thanks for the review ... you saved me an hour or how ever long this piece of tripe is and haven't wasted a minute more of my life on it ...

and yes, as you say, this is the problem with most of these shows ... it's some guy trying to act like charlton heston in, well, pick 'em ... omega man or planet of the apes ;) lol ... 

sewers ... really ... lol ... how about juts finding a plane and trying to teach yourself to fly so you can get around faster (without anyone around to call 911 when you pile it up at the end of the runway)? gee, that seems to be an equally bad idea 

thanks again :)"
