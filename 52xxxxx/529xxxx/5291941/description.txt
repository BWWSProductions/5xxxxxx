From Recorded Books:

Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Battle Cry of Freedom, James M. McPherson - acclaimed as Americaâ€™s greatest living Civil War historian - has garnered critical praise for his compelling narrative style. Tried by War brilliantly explores how Abraham Lincoln - struggling with feckless generals, fickle masses, and his own fearful demons - expanded the role of Commander in Chief amidst a war that defined him.
