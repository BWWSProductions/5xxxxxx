,anoldgoat,2010-07-22T21:09Z,"Thanks for this, but can't see the subtitles anywhere?"
,anoldgoat,2010-07-22T21:15Z,where is the subtitle file?
,deaths_handmaiden,2010-08-30T21:16Z,I'm guessing the subtitles are embedded in the video file. I didn't do the subbing as stated in the summary. They appear fine whenever I play the video in WMP & VLC
,tor142,2011-02-06T13:51Z,Any chance that this could be seeded for a bit? Thanks!
