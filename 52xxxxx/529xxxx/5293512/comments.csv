,trkerjim,2010-01-20T23:57Z,yeah file size is perfect for a trojan
,packhater,2010-01-21T01:01Z,"This doesn't appear to be a hacking tool!

If you READ the description it says that it will list all the keys that ""your computer as successfully connected to"".

This means if your computer knows the key and it connects successfully, this program will be able to read your registry and retrieve those keys from it.

This is handy if you can't remember a key to a certain wireless network. "
,Nishinoran,2010-01-22T07:18Z,"The program works fine, just like in the screenshot, although it seems to have issues with devices that keep their own records, it only detects wireless connections made through the Windows Wireless controls"
,datanet77,2010-03-21T15:15Z,please do not download this is full of trojan
,jandejoop,2010-06-08T14:46Z,"you guys are so stupid!

@trkerjim ""yeah file size is perfect for a trojan"" < doesn't say anything.

@all stupid guys who think this is a trojan: IT'S A HACK!!! so your virus scanner things it's a trojan. Makes clear, doesn 't?

@YIFY: thanks for uploading!"
,yelloo,2010-09-15T12:41Z,Thanks YIFY.
,doneyhtc,2010-10-12T23:23Z,"hello YIFI i did not downloaded your file not because its not good or something but this isnt a hack this program is a recovery tool for lost password or something. acualy i am just wrighting this comment because they keep talking about hacks. my opinion if u dont even know the software to do it just stay of of it. i use all the programs that you use exept i work with backtrack4 this is much better because this leeves no trails on the user pc.
for the rest of you ho is gonna ask stupid questions just read everything on this page.
especialy above this comment because he is giving you the good link for the hacking tools.
sorry for the bad english but its not my best language. peace out YIFY"
,thmz,2010-10-13T21:52Z,"This does NOT contain a virus. Scanned with newest AVG. It says ""possible hacking tool"" but that's what it does, it hacks the Windows wireless tool and shows you the key. That's why it shows Trojans etc. Worked after I right-clicked and pressed ""run as admin. Showed all wifi networks my laptop knew. 10/10. Light and fast. Thanks!"

,Lorddavo3,2011-07-12T03:50Z,"first thing skull and cross bones trusted uploader you could download a 2 k exe from this guy and it would be what he said it was and just to clarify a ""hack"" or the act of ""hacking is making a piece of hardware or piece of software work in a way it was not intended to so in all technicality this is a hack"
,downloader29,2012-05-11T17:16Z,"YIFI puts alot of great quality films on here, hundreds may be thousands,so i know a few of you have said there is a trojan in this,your dicks get your facts right before you start criticizing his work"
