,sgtdisturbed47,2010-02-20T10:40Z,"After the installation, it asks you to create a password for admin settings. Well, after that it tells you to hit cntl+alt+shft+x to bring up the user interface. Upon pressing that key combination, a little box pops up asking for the password you put in. 3 fucking times I had to uninstall and resinstall, create a new password each time (used my same password), and when that stupid admin box shows up, it tells me that my password is incorrect. WTF? This shit is busted."
,bergslag,2010-02-21T18:22Z,"thanks works great, really well with smtp (email)
easy, small.
bad:in process you can see the program (winsrv.exe) so it is rather easy to find the the spy directory.
keygen works, seems that it is activated in the program and not internet wich is good. works win win7, thanks kentucky-kid"

,bellafreenx,2011-11-10T18:31Z,"I just downloaded and installed and entered the password I wanted to use to unhide. When I press Ctrl-Alt-Shft-X to bring up the program- it gives me a ""password error"" I know exactly what I typed and this is really frustrating.  Now I can't even uninstall this....."
,bellafreenx,2011-11-10T20:04Z,Can someone please tell me how to uninstall this crap.  It keeps giving me a password error. This is the worst fking torrent.
