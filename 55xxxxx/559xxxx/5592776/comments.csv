,kaarma33,2010-06-07T06:50Z,"It looks like I'll need 2-3 more weeks to get set 9 together.  

All the one pagers that could be scanlated have been added into new versions of comics.  I put those new comic versions into a CBDA comics update folder for Set 9.  Then I went through all the one pagers and found 2 DD issues that didn't have the one pagers added in and then updated and put those issues in the CBDA comics updates folder. 

For a Set 9 bonus, I have just finished putting together the DD US One pagers CBDA cbr comic.  

Ghost in the grotto 1974 version is in the mail to me.  So, I'll update Ghost in the grotto and use it for the DD and Nephews Abbeville reconstruction.

So, if someone picks up the recent Quack Up for scanning, then Luck of the North could be updated, too.  Otherwise, there's the scanlation possibility from the european DD comic."

Just in case my hard drive crashes or I'm unable to do more scanlations, here's all the Carl Barks European comics I could find.

Check the CBDA comics request list for updates. I'm still working on updating the request list for Set 6, 9 and 10.

Post a message if you'd like to do a scanlation for uploading.  Thanks!"
