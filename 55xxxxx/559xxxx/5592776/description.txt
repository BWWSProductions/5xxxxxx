Set 5 Bonus:

An Informal Biography of Scrooge McDuck by J L Chalker CBDA


Set 9 will be ready in 3-4 weeks.

*************

I am still putting together set 6,9-12.

I found 20 HQ comics in Italian for Set 9.
Then I found 50 HQ comics in German, which has comics
for Set 9, 10 and other stories.
So, if I can't find an english HQ comic for Set 9,
then I have the option to do a scanlation.

1 page scanlated takes me 20-30 minutes!
The titles and sound effects words take the most time.
(Tekton pro ex and Tahoma (italic), 20 pts, bold)

I updated two one pagers (Mystery of the Swamp) and Jonah Gyro
(Many faces of M. DeSpell) for Set 5.

I'm not sure if I can find the patience to do any of the
longer stories such as Rug Riders or Luck of the North.

Maybe a group scanlating project?
I can upload an organized un-scanlated italian and 
german DD comics, if anybody's interested.
I'm hoping that more recent english scans show
up though.

The US german one pagers (7 of them) will be 
scanlated and included in Set 12.

If I get any longer stories scanlated, then
I will include them in the final CBDA complete set gigatorrent

**********

The excellent free disney comics website is available if you just
want to read the un-cropped comics online.

Much thanks goes to that guy who has posted many more recent
scans of wdc&s stories. It gives me a quite a few more comics
to update though.

The CBDA collection will be complete, 
but if you can find better scans than posted within this 
collection, then please leave a message and post up your comic scans.

I will update this request list as I go along.
Thanks for helping!
