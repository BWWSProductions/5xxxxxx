and so that's whats bullshit

,demonsun,2010-06-10T02:32Z,"geek10102 you are a bloody moron, MKV is soo much better than AVI, supports all those nice HD codecs and much more than AVI.

,blind202,2010-07-02T07:28Z,"Even newer TV sets can play MKV, with subs and all."
,SantanaBanana,2010-07-15T05:24Z,find it hard to play mkv..rnbuild urself a home theater pc..rnrnthat\'s what i did... i got sick of muxing files to play on my ps3..  and the quality was obviously degraded afterwards...rnrnso HTPC is the way
,mrpras,2010-07-26T05:31Z,"geek10102 you are the worst geek in the world

avi is an ancient format, and if you love it so much go and remux the mkv into an avi..

How come you can't play mkv? Don't have a decent player? Try Shark007 (for noobs) and Mediaplayer Classic Homecinema (for DXVA).

as a geek you should embrace and understand new technology. mkv is sweet, and whatever you're playing it on should have an mkv player."
,Glock40clbr,2010-10-06T00:03Z,geek10102....fuck off you whining pissant loser...your daddy should have rolled over and shot you on the wall.
,kithylin,2011-04-08T04:28Z,"@geek10102: Downloaded this, put it on my usb 3.0 flash drive, stuck it in the front of my set-top Samsung Blu-Ray Disc Player's USB port, selected it, played flawlessly.  Also works on my dual core laptop, and my intel Q6600 desktop perfectly fine.  MKV is an awesome format, and we don't need super amazing hardware to play it.... Just your hardware is OLD MAN! UPDATE IT AND SHUTUP!"
