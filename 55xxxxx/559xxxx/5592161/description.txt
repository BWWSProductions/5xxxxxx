GÃ¶teborg Wind Orchestra, (between 1992-2007 GÃ¶teborgsMusiken) consists of 21 full-time musicians (according to the orchestras website) and its concert hall is the historic Crown House in the centre of Gothenburg, built in 1642-1655.
GWO's history began in 1905, when some employees at the Gothenburg Tramways Company, GÃ¶teborgs SpÃ¥rvÃ¤gar AB, started a brass sextet. The band grew during the years, as the Band of the Gothenburg Tramways Company, and gradually was allowed to play employed by the company.
In 1997 GÃ¶teborgsMusiken was commissioned to perform as the Band of the Royal Swedish Air Force. This commission ended last year.

STRIKE UP THE BAND! 
This wide-ranging collection of favourite marches from around the world spans a period of 100 years, from Schubertâ€™s Marche militaire No. 1, indelibly associated with Christmas Eve, Disney and Santaâ€™s workshop, to Coatesâ€™ The Dam Busters used in the 1954 film of the same name. Other favourites include Sousaâ€™s The Liberty Bell, used as the signature tune for the BBC comedy Monty Pythonâ€™s Flying Circus, Alfordâ€™s Colonel Bogey from the film The Bridge on the River Kwai, and Under the Double Eagle by â€˜the Austrian march kingâ€™, Josef Franz Wagner.
