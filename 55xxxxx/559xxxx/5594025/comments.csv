You should deactivate your AV and let it complete the D/L. Keygens and Patches are often detected as trojans, but not all of them are so. For sure these two do nothing else than what they are supposed to do."
,jersson,2010-05-28T00:02Z,There's a new vers out of PC Booster 7 from Inkline Global Inc. I have PC Booster 6 and it's fantastic. Could PC Booster 7 be made portable ?

Didn't found any crack for the new version 7. The only Inkline version that I have is from 2008, not really recent. Let's see when it comes around with cracks or licenses... :o)"
,jersson,2010-05-28T21:21Z,"I would love if you could upload latest Nero( I guess it's the 9 vers) cause I don't really trust the other ones on PB. Your uploads are the best my man, thank's"

Personally I still use Nero 6.6.1.15 that's still a good and small version, and for my needs is more than enough, as I use it mainly for creating my Backup DVDs, and doing .mp3 files from music CDs.
The last version is 10, but looks like a bloated piece of software, and if you don't make your own BDs or DVDs it's exaggerated, you mostly will never use the most of its options, but the same thing can be said for Office... :o)
Depend what you are looking for, even Nero 9 is quite big (about 200 MB) but if you are interested in the basic functions I have some Lite or Portable versions that being about 55 MB or less look interesting.
Also, on Nero site, you can get Nero 9 Lite for free. It has the basic functions and it's free and legal... :o)"
