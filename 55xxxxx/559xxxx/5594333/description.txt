This is the third offering from emerging hip-hop talent sugaspott. He has refrained from creating endless mixtapes prefering to do well thought out compilations or EP's if you should call it that. 9 Tracks that feature production from another array of unsigned and yet very capable producers to name a few D-Vocalist, Teunzeist, MJD, Demozilla and Sunny P. A very interesting mix that combines not only the raw edge of hip hop, but an acceptable and enthusiastic commercial pinch too. Definitely one for the hip hop connoisseur.
