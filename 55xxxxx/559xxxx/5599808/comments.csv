,famemon78,2010-05-31T16:42Z,MinOdrol while other people were putting in their requests i figured i ll pitch mine too :-).. any chance of getting a reseed on This Sporting Life? just Disc 1 the movie would be good enough for me and it doesnt have to be uncut DVD 9 you can even compress it to DVD 5 .. Thanks ever so much again!
