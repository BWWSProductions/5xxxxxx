Heaven 17's first album Penthouse and Pavement released in 1980 was
a landmark in UK pop history combining electronica with pop hooks. Due
to technological constraints the band were unable to perform the album
live at the time of its release. However, to celebrate its 30th anniversary
and with the advances in technology, the album was performed for the
first time to a sell-out gig of over 2000 people at the Sheffield Magna
Arena on 6 March 2010. Along with their hits Temptation, Let Me Go and
Come Live With Me they perform Penthouse and Pavement in its entirety.
