Amazon.com - Excellent 2007 two CD anthology from the '60s Pop/Rock legends featuring Mickey Dolenz, Davy Jones, Peter Tork and Michael Nesmith. Although they were put together for the sake of a TV show, The Monkees were one of the most successful bands in the world during their mid-'60s heyday. This 36 song collection features hits and album tracks, proving to be a wonderful introduction to the band. Includes 'Last Train To Clarksville', 'I'm A Believer', 'For Pete's Sake', 'Daydream Believer', 'Pleasant Valley Sunday' and many others.
