oh fuck, what do we fucking do! 6 Tracks are messed up on here? Oh, say it ain't so, fucking please say it ain't so! This is some apocalypse-level ass-shit. Forget the world burning, that ain't shit compared to the destruction these incorrectly-tagged tracks are going to bring. FUCK! The world is ENDING! I've just added the album into my iTunes library and... oh GOD, it's horrible! Noooo! Leave my playlists alone! Wha-hey! What do you think you're doing? Stop eating my music! OOH... oh God. That's... (turns away) just brutal. Gonna... throw up... n-- (barf!). Oh. Fuck... gonna (burp!) never mind. (Spits out a piece of leftovers on the keyboard) You... you bastard... you sick fucking bastard (chime: USB Device Connected) GASP! (stops. looks up. what. the. fuck.) No. no. OH NO. Please, please don't go in there. Not him. Not my 120 GB. He's just a child! FOR GOD'S SAKE HAVE MERCY! (iPod syncing....) NOOOOOOO (iPod syncing) ...OOOOOOOO (iPod syncing) ...OOOOOOOOOO (iPod syncing) ...Ooooooo....ooo....oo....o (iPod syncing) oh, just fucking finish already! (iPod synced). Are you... alive, iPod? Can you hear me my sweet little caramel apple pie lov'em motha fuckin dumplin'.... yes you do! I'm gonna eat you all up... your love that is! Nom nom nom... (iPod ejects itself from cord... it starts glowing red... it shits out something red and liquidy.... like that red matter from Star Tr-----------

(BOOM)

Note: This wasn't a dramatization. The wrong ID3 tags will make iPods shit out the red matter from J.J. Abrams ""Star Trek"" movie. You will die. And Spock will be fucked again!

Have you learned the error of your ways?"
