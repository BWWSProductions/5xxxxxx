Rob throws Sasha out after hearing her and Riggs talking on her mix tape. Hurt, Sasha temporarily moves in with Riggs, but problems soon arise after she accidentally shrinks one of his favorite T's, and she sleeps at Nicki's for comfort. She threatens to create trouble for Rob when he starts looking for a new roommate, who ends up being Mark, Alex's former bisexual boyfriend. Alex is a little freaked out about Mark getting into his friends's lives, but still fancies him enough to kiss him.
