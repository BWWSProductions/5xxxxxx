GAME NOTES
As you crest a hill on your noble warhorse, a bleak sight unfolds before you: Cormyr, the land of your birth, is scarred and ravaged by a creeping blight. Once-green fields lie brown and dead, and smoke rises from farms and village homesteads that have fallen ramshackle and decrepit.

You have returned to your home with intentions of aiding your family in rebuilding their s from the ashes of wars past. Yet though peace seems to have finally returned to this troubled land, outlaws still lurk in the wilds and a strange silence has descended over the Hullack forest.

A silence that warns of encroaching darkness.
