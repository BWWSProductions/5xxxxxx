,dandeak,2010-12-09T22:13Z,this torrent is just a big empty archive. waste of time.
,stillgame,2011-01-24T00:02Z,This is a blu-ray ISO so you will need a blu-ray player (hardware or Software) to read this. Windows will mount but won't show the contents of the image.
,wetmouse,2011-05-06T01:12Z,"""I also edit out all the idioticly inserted ""10 years later"" updates at the end of the episodes""
First off, learn to spell. Second, don't edit stuff out that absolutely belongs there. This ""10 year later"" stuff updates the episode to make it less dated, you unrepentant moron! You have made a completely useless disc. Well done! And yes, don't waste your time (or more importantly: ours) with a version 4. You'd probably cut out the ""idioticly inserted"" English audio."
,edzi07,2011-05-09T16:55Z,"dont get this, stupid, he took out the 10 years l8er bit"
,ndjr,2011-05-13T01:42Z,"I have nothing against the 10 year later updates, but they should have been placed AFTER the end credits, as now it cuts the scen and music straight off!!! it`s a complete robbery to this great documentary and was not part of the original broadcast editing.

But even if I wanted to keep them, there was not enough space on the blu-ray disc.

46.4 GB (49Â 909Â 858Â 304 byte) is VERY close to max what you can fit on a dual layer disc, some brand of BD-RE 50GB blanc discs dont even have enough room, and I did not want to compress the video or audio one bit!

By the way....The original 7 NTSC DVD ISO`s are 50.1 GB

Just take it or leave it, I dont force anyone to download anything.

...one more thing, some scenes have some judder when playing on a PC (I dont know why) but everything plays absolutely smooth on the PS3 or the Philips BDP2500 and probably other standalone blu-ray player as well"
