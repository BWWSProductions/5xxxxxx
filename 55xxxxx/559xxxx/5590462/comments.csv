,trooprm02,2010-10-15T01:05Z,"this torrent includes ALL episodes (01-22) and is NOT out of sync.

thanks uploader!"
,darkscale,2010-12-12T00:57Z,"@fail0: The only way a tv series is NOT going to have ""watermarks"" is if the show is ripped from disc format... which means having to wait until it gets released to the public. This could take a year after the show/season is over. "

,pirator11,2011-01-24T01:47Z,Much appreciated BONE.. Any chance you could upload the first season aswell? :>

,Blavorn93,2011-03-27T09:33Z,"Hey everyone who is saying that there are episodes are missing namely like 10, 21 and 22 they are there but the creator as put them into 1 video so the videos that are like 350MB or bigger are those particular videos"
,thebigwn1122,2011-03-28T15:05Z,"anyone who cant see the ""missing episodes"" in the discription are just retarded..."
,evilbrent,2011-04-28T10:08Z,I think that there's an annoying watermark-free version available at not-for-free.com
