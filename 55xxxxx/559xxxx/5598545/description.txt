BBC R4 - J B Priestley's 'Lost Empires'
Adapted by Bert Coules
Music by Chris Monks
Directed By Kate Rowland
Broadcast in three episodes September 18 & 25,and October 2, 1994
Coded from tape at 128/44.1

Priestley adrift in time again. Superficially a murder mystery,
but really a fond look back to the pre-WWI music hall. Chunks
of the play were recorded live at the Oldham Colluseum.

Tom Baker is superb as 'Ganga Dun, The Maharajah of Mystery'.
Worth listening to just for the mind reading turn he does with
Tommy Beamish, 'The Clown Prince Of Chaos'.
