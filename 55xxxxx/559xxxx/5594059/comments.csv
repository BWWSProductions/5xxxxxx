unfortunately didn't spot yours earlier, tried searching, but had no result, so I uploaded the one I got from Usenet, appearantly quite the same you uploaded.

Thank you for your trouble anyways!"

Thank you again!!"

Who knew being in the navy would be quite this exciting!! Love the show; the writing is much tighter this season. Thanks for the opportunity to catch it. :D"
