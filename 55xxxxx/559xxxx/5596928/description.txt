[size=4]4-CD, 100 tracks, a musical document of hardships encountered by black people across the country by politics and social programs from the late 1920s through the '40s. This is some more of the real stuff: blues during the Great Depression and then later on. There are many seemingly obscure names on this remastered compilation of country blues from the 30's, 40's, and 50's. What a perfect set for the times in which we are currently living! The guitar artistry is impeccable; the piano playing tinkles through the glum mood; the vocals smooth and real; the remastering is very clean and brings the music back to life. [/size]
