Caving to public outrage, BP agrees to webcast the â€œtop killâ€ attempt to stop the leak. The operation began at 2pm ET. Watch it here, here  or here.

Outrage of a different stripe is in order when it comes to the cozy relationship between government regulators and Big Oil.  From porn, meth and job interviews, to the 500 million dollar grant given to the current Energy Secretaryâ€™s former lab.

And let the outrage continueâ€¦

BPâ€™s chairman to US critics: remember, we are â€œbig and importantâ€. Watch BPâ€™s CEO barking orders at a cameraman.

As a savvy caller pointed out a few days ago, BP has a very real financial interest in low-balling the amount spilled, as they could be fined up to $4,300 per barrel. Hiding the evidence of how big the spill may also be one of the driving forces behind BPâ€™s use of hundreds of thousands of gallons of toxic dispersant.  That same dispersant is creating a toxic soup underwater, breaking the oil into droplets capable of passing into the flesh of fish and birds (video below).

An internal BP memo shows a â€œ3 Little Pigsâ€ cost/benefit analysis used to save cash at the expense of worker safety. And like Greg Palast told us weeks ago, BP was unprepared for the Exxon Valdez spill (which was their responsibility) just as they were unprepared in the Gulf.

And on the immigration front, the perils of racial profiling: an American citizen with his â€œpapersâ€ is detained for three days and only set free after a congressman intervened. Obama will be sending 1,200 National Guard troops to the Mexican border to deal with Mexicoâ€™s sham of a drug war; John McCain wants more, of course. And as usual, a new poll shows America divided down racial lines.
