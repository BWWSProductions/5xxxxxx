,TheFesta,2011-05-04T12:54Z,"Just to let people know, i've tried a few different downloads for alcohol 120. This one seems to be the best. Although the install instructions are in german-its not really hard to figure out-and once it installs all you have to do is copy in the serial from the notepad (supplied with the download) and Shazam, it worked like a charm. No firewall blocks, No patching, No other funny buisness - just a simple serial number! Thanx ""bigwimpie"" : )"

Thanks!"
,Cracker_Jak,2011-06-01T21:49Z,"Thank you, great up, works perfectly, so far and yes, the setup installation is in German. Although you would have to be an idiot to not figure this out. Just a general comment on Keygens/cracks/patch. I am constantly reading "" my antivirus (usually AVG) says keygen is a trojan"". To these people, first read, read, and read all instructions, click on the up-loaders name and you'll see all their ups. Look for the scull logos besides their names, and above all else if you don't know what your talking about shut the hell up. Just had to say it,  Peace to all out there. "
,kclubb,2011-06-03T19:42Z,for those that are having issues I'd reccomend u trying out virtual CD 10.x.x.x (any version) torrent it's better and works w/ rigged (copy proof) cd/dvd combo's  I'm sure there are several torrents available out there.  Just make sure during install to uncheck lincense monitor and automattic web updates

,Dr.Mastermind,2012-01-03T21:35Z,"Works!! : )

BUT the fuckin’ German installer is a pain in the ass at first.

To install run the .exe as normal until you get to the big install button (it’s in German) you will then get some bullshit message where you won’t be able to go any further.   Just restart your PC and run the .exe again and you should get to the next step.

Thanks for the upload btw!"
,Snorkel76,2012-01-04T12:49Z,works great..tnx

It turned out the reason i was having issues with this one was because i hadn't restarted my computer. Once i did that it took all but seconds to get this installed and registered. DON'T get any other copies people, GO WITH THIS ONE."

,nr14,2012-06-26T00:16Z,"At first it was all ""Oh, german, whatevs, I can guess some.""
But then it said something about uninstall (I think) and I simply went ""fuck that"".
Later I tried installing it again but now it simply says ""After previous action, you must now restart"".
What the fuck? No actual company would make a product where if you canceled the installation you would still need to restart the computer.
I'm calling bullshit."
