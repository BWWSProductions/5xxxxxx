,hkoraddi,2010-05-28T20:49Z,well first season was rocking...but it pushed bit back with its second one( Story was odd and uneven was more like a porn)
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-28T21:14Z,"LOL, say ""cheers"" to HBO."
,hkoraddi,2010-05-28T21:58Z,well would gladly as its one place where u can get everything
,madtown4,2010-05-29T06:44Z,hi 2040 i was wondering if you checked out the Prince of Persia The Sands of Time TS XViD IMAGiNE . if you have how was it and are you going to upload it. thanks for your time
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-29T09:22Z,"@madtown4: Yes, I have downloaded IMAGINE 1440 MB big crap. Watchable, but: WRONG aspect ratio - after all these years I haven't figured out why this guys ain't capable of writing 640x256 resize, but are quite able to get wrong 640x272 (what IS proper 2.35/1 - but not in this case).

Also, any movement is ""ghosted"" and made of 'barrage' of duplicated frames.

Picture is over-saturated by insane 36% (measured).

So, if anyone wants to burn 1440 MB, be their guest. I am sure that you would not."
,jjabrams,2010-05-29T11:08Z,"I agree you should only concentrate your bandwidth on good r5 / dvd releases and possibly the best top notch TS ones. People that cant wait should go to the cinemas anyways. Of all the countries I know/ been to it cant be too expensive to see a few movies a year. Plus if everybody pirates, you cant blame the studios for putting out crap movies."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-29T11:15Z,"@madtown: I cannot ""fix-it"". But I can do ""Delete"" - as I just did."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-29T12:16Z,"@jjabrams: I agree to some extent... However, regarding good vs. bad release and my eventual encoding - I must download almost all out there, to check out the quality - and by that I want to say that technical stuff is not on the first place.

More important is the title (I do like something more over other, ya know?), availability, size (1.4 or 4.34GB is pretty damn big for plain TS, right), size as The Size (you can find any title on TPB in several MultiGiga incarnations), 'fix-ability' factor (if something IS available, but SHOULD/MUST BE and could be fixed for public use) and if someone search&asks and couldn't find something I have or can find.

On your second part of the comment, I should say you that I have 76 cents per day for food, not just for myself, but for my 78 years old mother and my three dogs. By that fact alone I CANNOT afford even one ticket for cinema per year. And - I CAN guarantee you that 90% of regular visitors here are in deeper shit than me. Some of the people do not realize their personal bankruptcy and all people find very hard and humiliating to admit that they are broke or poor. 
From pure hedonism and blindness most people would rather buy whatever they feel as needed, spending last cent on download of some favored movie or TV show in biggest possible form than - to give others in need, buy a can of food for some stray-dog or even - pay their own bills or buy something nice to their own flesh and blood.

And, even if I have money, I cannot left my house. And even if have money and can leave - I would not stop making my encodings and doing torrents, for two reasons:

1st. I know, for sure, from my own ""all the countries I know/ been"" that my personal burden is not the heaviest one. I should consider myself as - lucky one. I have something to eat, I have a bed and roof above my head. I have experiences and have gained knowledge. Lot of people have not either.

2nd. I think, that by buying tickets for cinema people actually support two things: rich industry to become richer AND by giving the support to Hollywood/Bollywood hyper-production, massive amounts of crap and nicely wrapped fantasies, lies about the world which never have existed. 

Avatar earned over 100 billions of dollars. My country can't do that in whole frikkin year.
Whose money is that? Our money. Now, some of us want few bucks back. As refunds."

long before the internet existed.If people
are willing to pay for crap,hollywood will 
provide it."

,Up4Pastry,2010-06-14T11:23Z,Is may be a stupid question but why are some True.Blood.S01E01.BluRay.720p.H264 1.4 Gbs and this one is only 500 Mbs?
