Im downloading it right now and i will let you know if i can patch it in ESR or not."
,hank266,2010-05-30T15:47Z,Well it didnt work to patch this either. I guess you must convert it to a dvd to patch it whith ESR. Anyway thankyou for upload and nice try^^
,theblasphemousbear,2010-05-31T21:23Z,"I'm sorry it didn't work. My other games are natural ISOs, so I think they'll work.
Sorry again, and good luck in you future endeavors ;D"

Save before entering Madril Sewers, the first dungeon, and if this occurs, try the binary unaltered and on CD rather than DVD. OKAGE is a blue-CD disc.

Excellent game, worth the effort. Thanks for the binary too, TBBear."
