KISS SONIC BOOM OVER EUROPE LIVE 2010

This is a live DVD of KISS playing live in the Glasgow SECC on the 9th May 2010.

I have collected together in crowd footage taken by fans and edited it together to create a multi-angle live DVD.

The quality is pretty good. And at times the quality is very good.
This DVD contains all the songs played by KISS when they performed at the SECC except for 2 songs I'm An Animal and 100,000 Years.

If you were there at the SECC then this is something you're going to want to see. If you saw KISS play anywhere in the UK, you will also want to see this. This was a great show and any KISS fan will love this DVD.
