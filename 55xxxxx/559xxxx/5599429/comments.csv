,keggs01,2010-06-06T05:26Z,"@THORA This is an excellent copy but why no DTS-ES audio like on your Evangelion 1.11 Torrent? (which i have, thank you) It still sounds great though, with its Dolby Digital EX. Very good torrent A9 V9 Thanks dude! I've been waiting AGES for this! voted up          "

,jamesnine,2010-06-30T09:35Z,"FYI, this has english subs."
,miggelsson,2010-07-20T17:39Z,THE SUBS ARE RETARDED! when there was a really important dialogue going on in the end the subs only transferred the sonf lyrics and not the dialogue about wtf was happening to shinji and rei inside the eva (spoiler alert btw). now i have to download another version of this movie just to know what was going on in the end
,miggelsson,2010-07-20T17:41Z,"i mean 'TRANSLATED the SONG lyrics"""
,ultamanl,2010-09-14T21:48Z,"any luck on mp4 format?.. wanna play it on my ps3

How abt external subtitle?, so i can convert it with subtitle?"
,NeroStorm,2010-09-29T22:37Z,"Can't say that I'm able to find any subs in this download? Using GOM-player, no subs show up."
,thescientist_vx,2010-12-04T17:55Z,"@miggelsson The subs are working just fine, baka!

To clarify things:
Spoken language: Japanese (some English too)
Subtitle language: English

Since it's in .mkv format, subs are soft-coded (optional) on the video file. Just play it in VLC and everything will be tip-top. Excellent release and a true masterpiece in anime!"
