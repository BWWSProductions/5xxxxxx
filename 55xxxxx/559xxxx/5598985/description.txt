Naive corn-pone skiing wunderkind picks up beautiful hitchhiking bimbo on way to ski competition. Once at the ski competition he is taunted in the daytime and laid at night, by different people. Four letter words, stoopid ethnic stereotypes (the Asian skiier's dancing looks like martial arts, of course) and skinny naked women with badly dated hairstyles abound. Not worth seeing except on cable -- the nudity is the big selling point and if you're not embarrassed to rent a movie with this title, you might as well go a little further and rent something honestly labeled as smut, instead of off-and-on nudity masquerading as "comedy."
