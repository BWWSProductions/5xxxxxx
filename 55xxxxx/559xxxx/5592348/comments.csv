did u get these vids from eztv or did u just use his name to get ppl to download these?"
,PurityDeath,2011-03-14T12:09Z,"Holy shit this is taking forever to download. I'm at 45% and have only uploaded 0.028 ratio.

What's going on here? 100 people at 45% and no one at 100% to seed it out to the rest of us?"

wtf, why would you say so?
Fucking lack of manners, no one can behave with respect to each other, fucking shame you are such douches..

Would like to know that too, is it eztv  collection or just thanked him anyways? (assuming it's a collection of eztv's uploaded, various LOL, 0TV, FQM etc?)
Nothing bad at all with that, really great to get em all in one pack, just want to know for subtitle finding once that fits, to make it easier, if you know what release group created the files!

Anyways, thx a lot!

PS: What you think of it? Do you like the show mates?"
,midurix,2012-02-04T11:14Z,"Love the show.

Some of the episodes finish a bit early though, sometimes mid sentence, which is a bit shit. "
