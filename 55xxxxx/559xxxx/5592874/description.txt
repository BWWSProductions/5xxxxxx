FLAWL3SS NOTES
first of all thanks to elektrika and PriSm. not a bad cam but defenitelly needed some tlc. first of all there was this red tint all over it that needed to go. then it was on to the red of it to much oger looed red and not green. then it was to denoising, saturation, chroma, brightness, contrats and finally a sharpen filter over it. for those that asked here it is. for those that didnt enjoy it.Hope you all enjoy.
