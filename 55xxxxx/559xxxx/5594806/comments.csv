[V],mothergoose56,2010-05-28T01:28Z,"As it stands I got 2 votes to cut the intro entirely (""Enough of this palaver""), 2 votes to cut just Ecstasy of Gold, and 3 to keep as is. A few others said either way but I only counted firm opinions. I'm not sure what I'll do. 

I started with ""Enough of this Palaver"" (unless I noticed they referenced a clip in the intro then I would keep the reference) when I was doing the 64k's because it was the quick-and-dirty upload and the HQ one would come later. Back then especially I would edit the 64k's a bit tighter and tend to leave a smidge more in the 128k upload. Plus I've been doing it the same way for so long it seems weird to change, although when I usually listen I FF in around 4 minutes most times so I understand that frustration. I guess even with that frustration I want a clear majority before I go and make a change. And don't you just fucking know if I did change it I'd immediately get people bitching?! 

I mean I know R&F changes up their intro a bit more but if they go back to using ""Let's get down to it Papi"" (or whatever she's saying) regularly again do I start cutting that too? 

God-damnit I don't need to edit it O&A just need to change it up more! "
,dwindle,2010-05-28T02:30Z,"Goose, you do enough work. Just leave the opening on there. Its more complete, and its probably less work for you. I dont think anyone wants you to burn out. Your releases are the best out there."
,steelcity,2010-05-28T04:35Z,"please don't edit out ecstasy of gold and definitely don't edit out the intro before ""enough of this palaver"".

i ""collect"" each intro."
,steelcity,2010-05-28T04:37Z,"in summation, i strongly vote for ""keep as is""."
,go_yukuri,2010-05-28T05:05Z,Good on ya.  Thanks MG
,go_yukuri,2010-05-28T05:06Z,Just keep as is.  Why fix it if it ain't broken? 
,darkzephix,2010-05-28T06:38Z,"Personally... I would like the intro removed.  I listen when work begins at 8am, and just scroll threw to the live talking... 

IT would be nice if they changed the intro a bit... but as of now... it is just 4 mins of a the same thing everyday... and FF is a bitch cause I can never time it right.  Would be nice to start when the rage music begins.  

Just a chore to do when I start my day by FF to the live feed.

Either way I am happy with the uploads.  Just a suggestion

Love Ya MG"
,iux0xui,2010-05-28T14:36Z,"I'm OK with cutting the intro... I usually fast forward through it. But if it stays the same I'm ok with that also, THANX AGAIN FOR THE UPLOADS.

((( LONG LIVE mothergoose56 )))"
,steelcity,2010-05-28T22:27Z,"they seem to be changing the intro more often lately (4 times since march).

i enjoy hearing the new intros and it would be a pain in the ass to ask MG to keep track of whether or not it gets changed.

it's perfect as is.  keep up the awesome work, goose."
,Satruas,2010-05-29T05:08Z,Just leave everything in. It's easy to just fast forward to 4:00 minutes or so. Thanks for all the uploads goose.
