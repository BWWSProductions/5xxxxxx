- The Studio Albums (2003-2010) -

It's not easy to get oneself into this strange music and more difficult to describe it: Dissonant chords, purely agressive droning, on the other hand bitter sweet and nearly shy textures, a mixture of death-metal, post-rock, ambient, modern classic and jazz.

WTF is that?

That's the music of Toby Driver's second project (after Maudlin Of The Well) Kayo Dot. Really not for everyone, K.D. is one of the most interesting and demanding prog acts of the last decade. During K.D.'s development their style changed more and more from heavy metal influenced apocalyptic trips to notable calmer post-rock experiments.
