2d left..
Thanks for the upload tho!"
,Actionjackson1,2010-06-07T06:02Z,any one have a virus report for the dll file that the other threads seem to have a trojan in them? I believe its call skidrow.dll. It's a keylogger. Thanks 
[T],DjAligator14,2010-06-07T10:47Z,"Some anti-virus it detects ilegal files as a virus not as a ilegal file so that people who see it they will think it's a virus and will remove it.

It's a clean file don't wory. I'm not uploading viruses."
,Actionjackson1,2010-06-07T17:57Z,"@djaligator14: I'm just concerned because all of the other skidrow stuff I've d/led never gave me issues with my AV program. I'm not attacking you personally, as I always appreciate uploaders efforts. without them we'd all be screwed. 

Anywhoo, I'm waiting on skidrow to come out with one that doesn't come up as a verified keylogger(this one does come up as a keylogger on virustotal)"

I thought SKIDROW was fully legid....
Disapointed"
,Verinoloth,2010-08-31T12:34Z,"The crack fix got reported as a Trojan horse Boxed ACM by AVG 8.5.441.

Does anyone else know of a clean crack? i highly doubt that a crack would be identified as a trojan horse unless it shared some similarity."
