,yoncenator,2011-08-29T10:40Z,"HOW THE HELL IS THIS 10/10  I'm only 4 1/2 minutes in and there's been 4 MAJOR glitches that nearly crashed my vlc player besides cutting out some jokes/lines. 

WTF??"
,MitsEvX,2011-09-01T00:44Z,"@yoncenator: I don't know where you are talking about, but I didn't notice them! Reinstall/Update VLC, reinstall/update codec pack (using K-lite or Combined Community?), graphics card driver error present (reinstall/update driver), weird setting in VLC?........

Cutting out some jokes/lines??????"
