,raichu11,2010-06-16T06:53Z,lolz dont complain mayne its all good
,a_of,2010-06-16T21:02Z,"@unqjohnny
Uhm, perhaps because that's the aspect ratio the anime was originally made, and what you find in DVD and Blu Ray?
Good Lord, what an idiot...
Thank next time"
,unqjohnny,2010-06-19T13:47Z,You're a fuckin' loser!
,jjy491,2010-06-21T04:04Z,Thanks for your work! Downloading now and can't wait to watch.
,Tobias314,2010-06-23T06:26Z,"@a_of
The point of Kai was recreating the anime for the future, and cutting the cruft. Backgrounds were reused and new artwork was created to recreate the series in 16:9, and that's how the Blu-rays come (16:9, 1080p). So either someone actively decided to reformat these to 4:3, or this is an upscale job from another source (TV?)."
,Narrat0r,2010-06-23T08:53Z,Only change I noticed between this and DBZ is the Opening and the Ending...
,Tobias314,2010-06-24T23:20Z,"@Narrat0r

Well the story difference is pacing. The original Sayian saga was 35 episodes (that is, the first episode, to the point were Vegeta is defeated). In Kai, a lot of the unnecessary gesturing is gone, so the entire Sayain saga goes from 35 episodes to 16 (less than half)."
,PirateTopboy,2010-06-26T11:21Z,Thanks man!
,imspeed,2010-06-26T17:57Z,"Firstly, thanks to Farmill for upping a great torrent.

@Tobias314: The update involved remastering the series for HDTV, rerecording the vocal tracks by most of the original cast and re-edited it to more closely follow the manga.

All the Blu-Rays both English and Japanese have an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 (4:3). This is what they were remastered to and the 16:9 versions you see on TV have been cropped to get this widescreen aspect ratio."
,infuriated_rain,2010-07-04T23:50Z,Thank you SO much for this! I can't wait to watch and see how the quality is!
,dbz_kai_fan,2010-07-05T07:34Z,Thank you SO much for this! I can't wait for you to put up more!
,shinron,2010-07-10T21:34Z,Thanks for this awesome upload Farmill. you people made the pirate-bay great as it is today. hope there are more like you. and thanks goes to the seeders too
,vooicpd00,2010-07-17T06:54Z,"To those arguing that these are supposed to be 16:9 try doing a little research next time.  The original series was 4:3 and so are the remastered versions.  The only reason you see 16:9 mentioned anywhere about the series is due to the fact that Japan has laws requiring anything show on TV to be broadcast in wide-screen.  Therefore, the versions shown on TV over there were cropped to make them 16:9 please see this comparison to see just how much is lost: http://comparescreenshots.slicx.com/comparison/57200"
,monkeyboi85,2010-07-30T21:12Z,"this is great, if ya find the next set of episodes please post it up :) thanks again though =D"

,Winds666,2010-12-27T16:48Z,The proper aspect ratio of this release (as it appears on the Blu Ray) is in fact 4:3.

thnx so much :D"
,manoman455,2011-03-15T16:59Z,"Going back on the topic of the aspect ratio, and let me make clear that im on  niether side.
The 4:3 is indeed the original aspect ratios but the film masters still had information on the left and right sides. In the 16:9 version those left and right sides where digitally remastered and restores producing new frames basically refilming the entire series over. The fact still stands that there is cropping but isnt as bad as a complete crop. if you look at the comparison you will notice there is more of the scene to the left and right in the 16:9 version then there is on the 4:3 version, in contrast the 4:3 version has more of the scene on the top and bottom. So either way both versions are Cropping something, and personally I have both versions (downloaded) and love them both, If you guys can wait, I Plan on making a remaster of my own, combining the 16:9 and 4:3 versions together and also replacing the intro to the original (i think the new one sucks).
My Encoder name is TizzyT. Im not the wide yet but working on this series might spread me around LOL."
,mini1guy,2011-03-30T13:33Z,"Hey everyone, I have a very important announcement,
apparently the guy who made the original dragon ball z kai is plagiarizing dragon ball z, now from what i read they are going to stop production of the dragon ball z kai series, ending with the Japanese episode 97, but I don't know if they will keep dubbing episodes into English or not."
,apsmax,2011-04-17T00:07Z,Thanks so much!!!! 
,nielsx1,2011-04-28T21:44Z,"Hey gast hartstikke bedankt voor deze upload, is alweer een tijd geleden maar ik dacht net pas aan dragon ball kai en ja hoor, hij staat er!"

,LurzKesh,2011-07-04T04:44Z,"Thanks so much for this upload i loved the original and this version, and thanks to all the people that seed these"
,Volomon,2011-09-18T08:07Z,"@mini1guy  Ohya I heard about that guy (his names funimation), that fucking hobo hired a bunch of voice actors and animators in his garage to make Kai or as you misuse the word plagiarize (the word your looking for is copy infringe).   What even fucking weirder is you say it ends on episode 97, which is fucking bizarre considering that Kai doesn't follow the originals episodes and instead follows the manga.

Weird dude weird. "
,Horror_movie_lover,2011-10-01T21:16Z,"Great torrent, thanks.
