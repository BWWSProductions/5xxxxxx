RELEASE INFO

A Saucerful of Secrets was the transitional album between the psychedelic
beginnings of the band with original front man Syd Barrett to the more
focused progressive rock that defined the band s later work and the arrival
of David Gilmour. This comprehensive film documents the turmoil of recording
during the breakdown of Barrett and the shaping of the cohesive unit that
was to be the shape of Pink Floyd for the next ten studio albums. The DVD
draws on archive performance footage and interviews with the band alongside
the candid insights of Floyd insiders and members of the original production
team. The DVD features highlights from: A Saucerful Of Secrets, Interstellar
Overdrive, The Scarecrow, Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun
Astronomy Domine, Careful With That Axe Eugene

Featuring candid interviews with the likes of Duggie Field, Pete D'Arby
Norman 'Hurricane' Smith and Nick Tauber and highlights from 'The Scarecrow'
'Interstellar Overdrive' and 'Set Controls For The Heart Of The Sun'
A SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS is the ultimate treasure trove for any
self-respecting Floyd fan
