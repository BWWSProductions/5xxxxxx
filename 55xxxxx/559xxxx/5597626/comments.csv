[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-29T17:23Z,"@kzrockz 
So far nobody could make a keygen for Norton 2009 and Norton 2010. But I've got a great idea: howabout if you make one ........?


@black47
Requests are welcome, but better is to use the request section from the forum:
http://forum.suprbay.org"
,black47,2010-05-29T20:44Z,well i tried http://forum.suprbay.org but the web page doesnt load so i will just request a crack for windowblinds 7 because there is no working crack availablel for it yet and a crack for bluebeam pdf revu 8 (www.bluebeam.com) its a great pdf software and people are ignoring it. i will leave it to ur convenience and thx for your great work

Sorry, I've got no keygen for Norton Antivirus 2010 + Norton Internet Security 2010 with 1 or 2 or 3 years subscription. I've only got a keygen for 5, 10 or 20 years subscription, but that's too short ....."
,brianxxx,2010-06-03T03:39Z,"Thanks as always to Sir Robbing! lol

Just some feedback for my experiments with NIS 2010 17.6 and 17.7.

I have seen this not work at all on some Dell and HP laptops. Don't know why but it causes immediate expiration and NIS 2010 stops functioning. Does not matter if they were clean or previous installs.

Have seen this not work correctly under VMWARE. Usually Safe Mode is the way to go. Has failed when tried for me under different OSes (Tested XP, Vista, 7 - 32&64bit) and on diff. Hosts running the guests. BUT sometimes it obviously failed, then everything was fine after rebooting! lol 
Running it under normal mode has seemed to worked out fine. Whether fresh install, clean or not clean VM or uninstalling older NTR like 2.5, 2.6 or 2.9 then installing the new version and getting 165  days.

Your experiences may differ - the point is that given a chance, it might work even though it seemed to fail."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-06-03T06:21Z,"@brianxxx

Thnx for the feedback. From all the trial resetters by BOX for different programs, only the trial resetter for Norton has always been kind of buggy. 

Groups are working on other cracks for Norton, and hopefully there'll be another crack soon. In a while Norton 2011 may be coming with a new sort of crack. Probably it won't be a keygen like the one from EDGE for Norton 2007 and 2008, since nowadays less keygens are used for cracking av software."
,Professoriz,2010-06-06T22:37Z,"Hello RH ;P

I overall like your torrents, but there is sumthing i want to know, pretty much all good av's spot this and the older ones as trojan.refroso . And, i assume that as they say, trojan.refroso is made to make a security hole (backdoor), so does this trial resetter make like hole in the Norton for hawkers to get in or to system ?

This is only my conclusion :P - waiting for reply :)"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-06-07T01:45Z,"@Professoriz 

The most simple way to explain false positives is seeing it like this:

If you've lost the key of your house you can do a few things, like:

1. Call the police to break into your house legally.
2. Call a burglar to break into your house illegally.

Both do the same, but only the police has official permission and legal tools. 


In a way each crack is a virus, cause it has been modified or modifies the system without official permission or tools.
Only bad viruses will cause harm to the system, while good viruses break ""into the system"" without causing any harm.
So there are good and bad viruses, and antivirus software doesn't make a difference between good and bad viruses.
Besides antivirus software there are many options to check what a crack does, and if it's causing any harm."

I was wondering if you have experienced this problem or if anyone else has and what to do about it. Any advice you have will be appreciated, you probably get newbie questions like this and for hinder you with this i am sorry."
,a1adin,2010-08-21T12:30Z,"yes, same here, only work for 2-3 days then subscription expired and this ntr 2.9.6 does not work anymore. I guess we have to wait for the new NTR"

I have run NTR 2.9.6 on three of my systems. All three work great and provide 165 days of protection. On day 86 with my desktop.

At the end of the subscription uninstall and install the NTR again."

Only thing I did was to turn off temper protection in Norton (which was cracked with old crack few months ago), run new crack, and when it ended instalation, I have 165 new days of subscription. Easy as that.

Cheers mate :D"
,jorei12,2010-09-15T19:25Z,@RobbingHood Hello Robing Hood.The 2011 version of NIS has been released.Please make a request to box for a new trial resetter.
,lemon714,2010-09-16T20:00Z,"It gave me 30 days then went to 60 days within 24 hours and is counting down from that after 5 days.

Nortons is working,so I aint bitching."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-21T01:34Z,"@jorei12 

NTR2011 v3.0.0 is already released (for NIS NAV 2011) and will probably soon be posted.

The newer NTR2011 v3.0.1 was pulled back by BOX because of issues, so don't use that version if you've got it."

It's not sure if there'll be a new trial resetter for Norton 2010 v17.8.

Right now already three trialr esetters are released for Norton 2011, of which the latest is NTR2011 v3.1.0

If you stick with Norton 2010 then don't expect a new trial resetter for v17.8"
,Frontline3920,2010-09-26T01:26Z,"@ RobbingHood

A total of three trial resetters are available for Norton 2011, where are they?!? Can't find... Google just redirects to pay sites.

Thanks mate."
,dk.1190,2010-09-26T02:26Z,"@RobbingHood
Norton internet security 2010 17.8 may be the last update of Norton 2010 bcoz 2011 is already released. Isnt it??
So plz update trial reset 1 last time. :)"
,Frontline3920,2010-09-26T03:22Z,"@dk.1190

correct me if i'm wrong but I bet it's a lot of work to create a TR, especially since BOX has already created 3 NTR'11 versions. I liked NIS2010, but 2011 is better, trade up. You'll get used to it pretty quick.

Also, I have other computers that still have 2010 installed, with NTR 2.9.6. I just checked and they have updated to 17.8 without any problems. So far IMHO NTR 2.9.6 seems to work with NIS 17.8"
,dk.1190,2010-09-28T02:19Z,"@RobbingHood, Ok thanks. But where can we find new releases of trial resets. Only trial reset available on torrents is 3.0.0 no release after that is available !!!"

,TheBest7,2012-07-12T00:45Z,"If anyone is still interested in the old NIS10, you can get it (17.6, the latest intaller version) directly from Symantec from here:

http://buy-download.norton.com/downloads/CLT/NIS/US/2010/17.6/ESD/NIS-ESD-17-6-0-32-EN.exe

This crack works perfectly for it, and its not that outdated after you update the definitions.
(Latest offline virus definitions updater here: http://us.norton.com/security_response/definitions.jsp , you still need to update the engine up to 17.9 and other definitions from LiveUpdate)
(If you go to http://www.norton.com/nis10 you get an ""Upgrade"" version, which I don't know which are the differences)."
