[b]Quote[/b]
This here is a story about the west.
The old west. And the new west.
And about how one became the other.
How the men packing guns became the
tools of men holding wads.
When the dollar bill became mighty.
And the pioneering days was over.
It happened in a town called Union,
Just west of the Mississippi,
But it could have happened anywhere.

Written by a New Zealander who is now
a barrister in London.
