Platform: PlayStation Portable (PSP)
ISO Supplier: ???
Language: Japanese Only (Partly Translated English version is available by 3rd party ISO Patch)
Developer: Sega
Compatible With: PSP (Custom Firmware required)

In order to play this game, you need to have a custom firmware installed onto your PSP. I recommend the 5.50 GEN D3 Firmware. The game is excellent - working 100% on my phat PSP (PSP-1002), running off the Memory Stick (via an ISO Loader).

Seed the ISO, go buy a beer and enjoy! If you like the game please don't forget to support the software developers by buying a GENUINE copy of it! However, you can always try before you buy! :)

Enjoy this fine release.
