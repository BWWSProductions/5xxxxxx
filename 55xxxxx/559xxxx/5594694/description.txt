A brutal Survivor-style reality show produced by the
publicity-obsessed promoter of the Paris Hilton sex tape
was shut down suddenly in September 2005 when a
contestant was critically injured. Closely following the
train-wreck production and the industry that spawned it,
this film documents the human cost of popular entertainment.
