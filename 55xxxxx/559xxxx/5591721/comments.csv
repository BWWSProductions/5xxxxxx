Get your seeds up, or I will shut down mine for good!"
,anotheraccount123,2010-06-21T14:30Z,"bye then Teempla

hate people that dont seed but hate the whiners complaining about it more "
,1c1a,2010-06-29T20:33Z,Well it worked fine for me. Thx saffordpc!
,freespirit_10,2010-08-10T02:59Z,I agree 100% with Teempla.....it seems like there are ALOT of people who grab and run. It supposed to be about sharing the torrents.
,freespirit_10,2010-08-10T03:02Z,Thank you for the download....my daughter loves this show. She will be so excited.
,freespirit_10,2010-08-11T04:04Z,"I have been downloading this since 9pm yesterday. Its at 97.3% and has been since 8pn tonight. Please seed.
Thanks again saffordpc.....looking forward to getting them up and running."
,saffordpc,2010-08-11T20:41Z,@freespirit are you getting hash-fails? if you are try doing a re-check(noobs tend to watch videos while they are still uploading witch changes a small portion of the file) if not im going to restart my seed which should help
,fail0,2010-08-14T20:42Z,"the most annoying thing is to suffer through a watermark on the screen for any show, and the poster failed to provide this small tidbit. ""season premiere(this changes), cartoon network, hd' in bright gold along the bottom. this was a waste of my time honestly."
,saffordpc,2010-08-15T00:31Z,@fail0 almost all of these are the original eztv releases they all have the logo because thats how it was released. don't know how you watch any of your tv because their is always some kind of logo on a screen
,darkscale,2010-12-12T00:47Z,"Ppl need to understand that things need to be DLed before others can start seeding them, so no use complaining that that there is no seeders. Just be patient. Also realise that there are other torrents out there that might be offering similar content."
,lilmodDLK,2011-01-09T05:04Z,I agree with darkscale
,kkbb3000,2011-06-03T14:02Z,"fail0 you're being rather fussy about a free product, I think you meant thanks."
