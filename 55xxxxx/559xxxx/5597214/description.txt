From Wiki:


Broken Social Scene is a Canadian indie rock band, a musical collective including as few as six and as many as nineteen members, formed in 1999 by Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning. All of its members currently play in various other groups and solo projects, mainly based around the city of Toronto. The band refuses the label "supergroup," based on size or the ubiquity of their members, claiming that in the indie scene everyone is involved in more than one project. The group's sound could be considered a combination of all of its members' respective musical projects, and is occasionally considered baroque pop.[citation needed] It is characterized by a very large number of sounds, grand orchestrations featuring guitars, horns, woodwinds, and violins, unusual song structures, and an experimental, and sometimes chaotic production style from David Newfeld, who produced the second and third albums. 








Feel Good Lost 2001


Feel Good Lost is the 2001 debut album by Broken Social Scene. It was written and recorded primarily by founding members Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning. Unlike their better known 2002 outing You Forgot It in People, Feel Good Lost is a predominantly instrumental, Post-rock, ambient album, although it does feature some vocals by Leslie Feist and Kevin Drew.

You Forgot it In People 2002


You Forgot It In People is a 2002 album by Broken Social Scene. It followed Feel Good Lost, and was the band's commercial and artistic breakthrough. You Forgot It In People features intricate, experimental production techniques and a large number of instruments coinciding with the band's vastly expanded size.

Music videos were made for a number of tracks, including singles "Stars and Sons", "Almost Crimes", "Pitter Patter Goes My Heart", and "Cause = Time". The album also features "Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl" and "Lover's Spit", two songs that went on to become the band's biggest "fan favorites."[citation needed]

Many of the songs that didn't make it onto the album were featured in a B-sides compilation titled Bee Hives, released in 2004.

It won the Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year in 2003.

In Chart's 2005 reader poll of the 50 greatest Canadian albums of all time, conducted just three years after the album's release, You Forgot It In People ranked fourth, behind only Sloan's Twice Removed, Neil Young's Harvest and Joni Mitchell's Blue.

In 2009, Rhapsody (online music service) ranked the album #9 on its "Alt/Indieâ€™s Best Albums of the Decade" list.[1]

The album also placed 27th on Pitchfork Media's list of the 100 best albums from 2000 to 2004, 23rd on their list of the 100 best albums from 2000 to 2009, and 28th in Bob Mersereau's 2007 book The Top 100 Canadian Albums.

Stylus Magazine placed it seventh on their Top 50 Albums: 2000-2005.

The songs "Cause = Time" and "Stars and Sons" are listed at #145 and #275 on Pitchfork Media's Top 500 songs of the 2000's.

Broken Social Scene 2005


Broken Social Scene is the third studio album by Broken Social Scene, released on October 4, 2005. The album was originally to be titled Windsurfing Nation.[1]

The original artwork was to be a cartoon rendition of Pangaea, which was later scrapped in favor of the current artwork drawn by lead singer Kevin Drew.

In addition to the musicians who contributed to the band's prior release You Forgot It in People, new contributors on Broken Social Scene include k-os, Jason Tait (The Weakerthans) and Murray Lightburn (The Dears).

The initial domestic pressings of the album were issued with a seven-track bonus EP, EP To Be You and Me, a play on Marlo Thomas' children's record album Free to Beâ€¦ You and Me. The Japanese release is still issued with the EP. The vinyl pressing was released on two records, the first three sides being the album and the fourth being the EP.

The song "Ibi Dreams of Pavement (A Better Day)" refers to Canadian novelist Ibi Kaslik, a friend of the band.

At the 2006 Juno Awards it won the award for Alternative Album of the Year. It was also shortlisted for the 2006 Polaris Music Prize.

However, the album divided critics more than its predecessor, 2002's You Forgot It in People. Whereas the earlier album had received almost universal critical praise, Broken Social Scene's looser, less structured songs were praised by some critics, but derided by others as self-indulgent and sloppy. Nevertheless, the album reached the number one position on American college charts and received widespread critical acclaim in the U.K.

Broken Social Scene Presents: Brendan Canning â€“ Something For All of Us 2008


Something for All of Us... is the debut solo album by Broken Social Scene co-founder Brendan Canning. The album is the second in a series entitled Broken Social Scene Presents:, with each album in the series being a particular member's solo efforts, assisted by fellow Broken Social Scene membersâ€”the first being Kevin Drew's Spirit If.... "Hit the Wall" is the album's first single and was made available as a free download on the Arts & Crafts website on May 5, 2008. The album was released to retail on July 22, 2008.[1] Due to the leak of an unmastered version in mid-June, Canning has released the album as a digital download.[2] Quoted on the Arts&Crafts website[3], Canning said:

â€œ	It has come to my attention that an unmastered version of my album has been leaked through the internet. With the retail release being six weeks away, I've decided to correct the situation by releasing the album digitally myself, because I can. So this is for all you early birds who just couldn't wait for July 22nd. But you know, it won't be like going to your favourite record shop and getting a copy in your hot little hands, or sitting in your basement downloading it to your iTouch [sic] phone while playing Grand Theft Auto, it merely corrects the situation that is...a messed up version of my record floating around on the internet, and this is not how I wanted my record to drop. Believe me, this is not a minor situation. We're talking recall here folks...With all of this in mind, please note: 'Something for all of us...' will be available at all fine retail and digital outlets in North America July 22nd with some additional artwork inside and slightly later for the rest of the world.	â€

The album has been generally warmly received. The album currently has a score of 70 out of 100 on Meta Critic[4] with high praise from Boston Globe, Almost Cool, Delusions of Adequacy, Billboard and No Ripcord. The album has also sold fairly well reaching the #17 spot on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.
