WinRAR 3.93 for x86 and x64 already Registered (Corporate).

Install it as the regular one and it works without need to use any KeyGen or Patch.

Only added the rarreg.key to the original setup, so you don't need to search for it. All the other files inside are the original ones, not patched, so you should not have any problem with Antiviruses.

If you don't trust it, download the original Setup from RarLabs Site and copy the RarReg.key file in the install Dir (usually C:Program FilesWinRAR).


                WinRAR - What's new in the latest version


   Version 3.93

   1. Bugs fixed:

      a) in WinRAR 3.92 -xd:pathfolder switch could also exclude folders,
         which path does not match the path specified in the switch
         and only the folder name is the same as specified;
      
      b) switches -y -or did not work correctly together. Switch -or was
         ignored in presence of -y.

SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal
 
http://virusscan.jotti.org/
 
http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:
 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
