,DofusOctopus,2010-05-29T02:41Z,is this game worth downloading ... 5gb still a big thing .. lol even doe im on unlimited .. 
,Corpselight,2010-05-29T07:06Z,I do not think this is legit the website says release date is june first
,Heretic1808,2010-05-29T07:41Z,"and the skidrow release has been out for a day now, with a 100% working crack. plus ive downloaded globe@'s stuff before and it always works. i say definitely trustworthy, thanks globeplus (:"
,Likeadidas95,2010-05-29T09:37Z,"@ DofusOctopus  : 
omg ur still whining ! actual size is 10 gig ,and globes has done a really huge job and u dont like anything ?! get life !

thanks for another good job globe :) for sure going to dl this, cuz ur torrent always works :)"
[V],globeplus,2010-05-29T11:10Z,"very pertinent observations my fellow users , this is a sega game and the structure of the game is alomost all the time high compression ratio , that means that you don´t get to much compression in 10 gb , i was about close 24 hours , step by step working until i get this 5.38 but with the game absolute complete , it was possible maybe 100 mb less if i cutted the languages but that it will ridiculous for not too much size , they worked the game with the unreal engine and most of the things using this engine are already nice compressed then the videos are in type of videos for sega games that have a different little structure than usual with a need of a nice coordination of the sound and picture of the video , they prefere to use this type of videos and not the more common .bik files , some files , sound for example maybe was possible a more deep work but only with the unreal engine to do the new packing of the files , basically they have the 10 gb already with a very nice compression , so it was a long work and tough , when the users with more attention to the generality of the games that comes out see a sega game , knows immediatly that probably it will be a tough task to make the work and almost the all the game is already nice compressed , another example before this one was alien vs predator , if i didn´t get by luck the possibility to divide the 3 sectors with missions it was a very long file too for what normal be a very nice pratical file , i put the marines campaign in the main file then the aliens and predators missions in part for a relativily nice size , what i mean with this is : if the users see a new sega game can expect a hard work even for who made the normal nice pratical files ."
,goku_dbz,2010-05-29T12:45Z,@globeplus-hey globe nice work bro.thank you.i have a curiosity.you mentioned that it is hard to compress sega games like AvP.but the lossy repack version was only 3.63gb plus all the 3 mission packs were included in it plus no video was removed only downgraded to 50%.And was working fine.How did they do it in just 3.63gb?
[V],globeplus,2010-05-29T15:02Z,"the version mentionated wasn´t complete and with problems , i din´t download it bit is easy to guess that .
the uharc is a nice compressor but can´t compress as much as the freearc , only in some specific type of files can happen little oscilations in the possible compression but not enough to the generality of the files , i can give more 10 or 20 compressors names , some of them can do better but taken a much longer time to make the decompression , so analising all the factors the freearc is appropriated to the work ."
,deathtrooper30,2010-05-29T15:24Z,"@ Corpselight

U are truly a fucking moron!"
[V],globeplus,2010-05-29T16:30Z,"No problems running the game , no need of deleting the register , no worries with the firewall , no turn back to the menu after the 1st cinematic , no ughs constantly and without sound , just the game with normality with everything ok , i hope the hassles putting negative comments download the 9.98 gb files ."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-29T16:32Z,"when i said negative comments , i mean negative votes , of course the 9.98 gbfile work but with some cares that sometime are not that easy but with some patience probably the user can bypass that , anyway i have all the game in normal quality for 5.38 gb ."
,pop101,2010-05-29T17:42Z,GREAT MAN DONE A GREAT WORK.. I LOVE GLOBE
[V],globeplus,2010-05-29T19:55Z,thank you the las comments and what i mean is that certainly this file can be a valid option to download this game . thank you .
,goku_dbz,2010-05-29T19:56Z,i had high hopes from this game but the ratings are terribly low on gamespot.but still i will try this after downloading.?@globe-that version worked perfectly after appropriate settings.?Anyways thanks for this globe.cheers!?@h3x0r-hey are you also into ripping games and uploading?
,Doomtrigger1,2010-05-29T23:28Z,lol the only reason why the ratings for this game are so low is because they throught this game was going to be epic like mass effect 2 and to some ppl it is this is a great game there will be patches that fix the bugs and if you are useing a shitty video card the game is going to look like crap. now I WISH THE PPL SEEDING would seed lol i dont like 5-10 kbs -_-
[V],globeplus,2010-05-30T00:59Z,"The beneficiates with a nice seeding in the file is always the generality of the users , for me i did a very tough work , close 24 hours in total with everything nice for the possible nice size and the user don´t need to make corrections or little tricks to use the game ."
,AgnosticWatermelon,2010-05-30T01:25Z,Does this have the lag problems too? 
[V],globeplus,2010-05-30T01:39Z,"I don´t know what you mean by that , but normally , lag problems have the tendence to happen in some particular video cards but the game run anyway , with me the game works normal that´s all ."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-30T01:50Z,"you are nice guys , worried in play nice the games , so i will write this new comment about the lag stuff : certtainly can happen with some video cards in some games some lag stuff , i recognise that one or another game can really have specifities suggesting a little lag problem in some gameplay but more concern lag problems we can say that users of the online xbox360 or playstation network can have more lag issues specially with the online stuff , some game producers already started showing some concern about the situation too , just to finish the comment i leave a link to the interested users in this type of issue take a look or maybe just for curiosity :

,AgnosticWatermelon,2010-05-30T02:23Z,"@globeplus

there was an lagging issue with the skidrow crack fix"
[V],globeplus,2010-05-30T02:28Z,"Thank you for explain , i didn´t get the idea straight , i know that and i have everything perfect in the file , i made the necessary corrections and putted the file ok , as i know total normality ."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-30T02:33Z,"just to finish the before comment , if you are refering to the consecutive borring sounds clicking in the keys and in the start of the game that is corrected , i didn´t played the all game yet but the strange noises keeping the player a kind of borred was corrected , i think only in the start of the 1st video but without interfering with the game run correctly you can listen a couple of sounds but beside that the game goes with total normality ."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-30T02:45Z,"ok , i checked the crackfix and comparing with what i already have in the file i didn´t noticed a thing , some files , the dll with extra 10 kb but inside the game , the way the game goes looks exactly the same , maybe this fix was for issues with some other situations because for this file really don´t look like make too much difference ."
,Doomtrigger1,2010-05-30T03:27Z,the stuttering in the skidrow was because they forgot about the DRM and the new crack fixed that but ; ; the speeds are beyond slow :(
,Corpselight,2010-05-30T07:41Z,oh i see Eu release
,Corpselight,2010-05-30T07:45Z,"@ deathtrooper30

Go crawl in a hole and die you tink!"
[V],globeplus,2010-05-30T20:56Z,"to h3x0r_c0d3 : thank you for attention ansd i am shore you did that with the best of the intentions but i think they don´t have any problems with the freearc , the problems they get circunstancially is from background applications consuming ram or interfering with the extraction and many of them after the computer restart get the extraction , what they need to know is that they need the freearc that is a program like 7zip for doing the extraction and that they need close 1 gb ram to make the extraction ."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-30T23:55Z,"This last comments makes me thinking in a possible minitool to the users that want a arc extraction in a pratical way , i tought that with the freearc program the users do the arction and can make compressions too but anyway an easy tool to make arc extractions in a nice way maybe can be useful too , ok i have now a minitool to the users of the files that have a easy use with full instructions inside the tool :

[V],globeplus,2010-05-31T01:35Z,"Thank you for your nice work h3x0r_c0d3 and your intention is positive but some of the included files are not useful for some games , like that beside the idea is nice the execution don´t look too much pratical , my conscience was despertated by you to create a easy tool for the arc files , need a little work and follow instructions but after use this minitool 1 or 2 times you will ready for 30 or 40 extractions , i never thought in this because the program is freeware and work nice and the users can use it for compressions or extractions , so never ocurred me this but after reflecting in your nice effort it was time for me to do a minitool for this type of files extraction , i didn´t did this minitool for put something for myself and because must be me to do the tool but as recognise for your effort in a nice work but in the pratic not totally pratical beside the intention , so forgive me for this minitool but you didn´t give me any other option than make one for my own in appreciation for your work , maybe you can improve your tool , that is funny too and maybe me with some more time can improve mind too but i think this way after a couple of uses the user of the minitool really get all the picture and with the extraction executed in correct conditions without other background applications perturbating the extraction , this minitool will work probably in 100% of the arc files , just a little pratic and it will be ok , the conversion work inside the files when necessary will still like that because i need to appropriate the work to the file that is beeing worked but just for the normal extraction of the arc files this minitool will do the trick . thank you very much for your effort and consideration to my work and i hope you still downloading my files when you want , i always do my best shot with a correct analysis of the games , keeping the gameplay more intact as possible in a nice way , i like to get the best size possible and that make sense if you are working pratical files but i do the work without beeing obcecated in get every single mega that i can get , if to keep the gameplay more nice in the videos for example or sound or leave the languages or not i get more size , no problem , that is acceptable and the users are more happy but i do this of course analising the circunstances of the game that is beeing worked , this is the sections of the work that can oscilate a little bit in the work but one thing is for shore : the gameplay must be 100% nice and normal , no doubt !!!  
see you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-31T03:15Z,"After verifying with more attention the globearc minitool i find out that the extraction is perfect but the sound playing at the end of the work needed a little afination and i tested and i think that i corrected that little situation , here is the link to the arc minitool with everything perfect .

1 - extract the arc file then move the extracted file to the desktop

2 - open the game folder and go to the next path :
