You help Gwen as she takes care of seven families in their fantasy homes, looking after babies, teens, seniors and pets, each with their own wants and needs. Luckily, Gwen has some tricks up her sleeve â€“ literally! You can use the 10 magical spells at her command to make things a little bit easier, such as entertaining the babies with magic bubbles, making the dishes wash themselves, or stopping time for a quick breather. Youâ€™ll also unlock special items to help Gwen with her workload.
