DVD Description
It's Piglet's very first movie - and a big one at that! In the grand tradition of Winnie the Pooh animated features, you'll delight in Piglet's Big Movie, a wonderful story of friendship, fun and appreciation in which everyone learns it doesn't take somebody big to do big things! Piglet disappears into the Hundred Acre Wood after hearing he is "just too small" to help Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore, Roo and Rabbit with a hunny-gathering scheme. To find him, everyone makes a plan to work together and use Piglet's scrapbook for clues to his whereabouts. While searching, they realize how big a part Piglet has played in their many adventures together. Then, when Pooh finds himself in a precarious situation, a superhero just the size of you-know-who shows up, and with a lot of courage and a little luck just might save the day! Filled with adventure, laughter and heart, and five new songs, Piglet's Big Movie will have everyone in the family singing, smiling and sharing over and over again!
