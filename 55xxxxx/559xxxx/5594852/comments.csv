,thunderbum,2010-05-27T23:40Z,"@jwhitt: would you have (or be able to get) David Horowitz's book 'Alliance Radical Islam and the American Left'?

I've looked for it but came up empty handed. PS: I'm learning a lot from 'The Complete Infidel's Guide to the Koran' (And a big thank you! for sharing).

What i find endless fascinating and amusing is how all the muslim nutjobs come out of the woodwork to slam any attempt at understanding what a homicidal religion they obey. They'd prefer the doctrine of taqqiya any day and keep the rest of the world in the dark than to let on what their real intentions are (global domination/global caliphate).

Many thanks again jwhitt for the interesting, education and very welcome books and torrents! Cheers! :)

@ ThunderBitch, below you could pick up this book on Amazon.com unless are one of those welfare recipients Dumbo Limbaugh keeps talking about?...Next, time Dumbo blasts people looking for a hand out...He needs to look closely @ his own followers....END

,booboo332,2010-05-29T07:05Z,"Still playing that old, confused tune, littletrick?

Asking if someone has an audiobook to share on a file-sharing site is not the redistribution of wealth.  There is no taking what someone else has away and giving it to another.  What about this confuses you?

It is true that this not what the copyright holders want but it is in no way taking away what is already possessed. While digital duplication is a major issue in the digital age for content producers, you are applying fallacious comparisons.

Also, many people like to review a book before purchasing it to support the author and cannot find it in their local library.  You are far too eager to contend and insult and that betrays your true motivations."

If someone lends you a CD and you put it on your harddrive as MP3s, it is most certainly not ""stealing"".  These torrents aren't any different in principle.  Sure it is a violation of copyright laws but it is not taking the property of another away and giving it to someone else.  The diminishment of profits through piracy falls under such laws but the laws of the theft do not apply.  It is a copyright issue not theft.  Break it down, sparky. COPY RIGHT.

Also, trying to bring healthcare and the housing crisis into the argument is just plain absurd.  Your weak attempts to equate piracy with the abuses and misuse of confiscatory taxation and wealth redistribution only make sense in your own mind.

littletrick - ""Im just exposing the hypocrisy of conservatives...As we speak the produce(r)s of the Hurt Locker is(are) looking to sue pirates for download(ing) his boring movie""

For the record, the lawsuits regarding filesharing thus far have focused mainly on people who upload data and operate file sharing sites not downloaders.  If someone is stupid enough to get caught I have no sympathy for them.

You claim to download files with torrents from this site, declare it is stealing and then try to hold others to a moral standard.  Take the time to look up ""hypocrite"" in a dictionary, wouldja.  Like myself, not everyone who listens to Rush or downloads these torrents are conservatives.  Even if someone calls themselves a conservative and morally superior while breaking copyright laws, what is it to you?  Democrats are no strangers to self righteousness and self appointed moral superiority when they are as flawed as anyone.  You are living proof.

littletrick - ""you(r) assertions that this is harmless and is not stealing is just crap and you should shut up because you dont know what you are talking about""

I never said it was harmless. In fact I clearly wrote ""duplication is a major issue in the digital age for content producers"".  I also never said I cared one way or the other. 

I have been a pirate for nearly three decades so your childish claims that I don't know what I am talking about are really quite amusing."
