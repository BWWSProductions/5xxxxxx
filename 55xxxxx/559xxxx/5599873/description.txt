Yet another Tetris game has been announced for release on Nintendoâ€™s Wii console and DS handheld, this time called Tetris Party Deluxe and following on from Tetris Party, which I quite enjoyed when I downloaded it as a WiiWare title, Tetris Online Inc. are set to release Tetris Party Deluxe which will build on the previous title adding new modes and features to the game.

There will be six new modes added which will include a game called â€˜Bomblissâ€™ and another called â€˜vs. Sprintâ€™ that will allow up to four players competing against each other to be the first to complete 40 lines. You can create your own shadow puzzles in an edit mode within â€˜Shadowâ€™ and youâ€™ll also be able to fight it out online via the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection as well as local multiplayer games.

As with â€˜Tetris Partyâ€™, youâ€™ll again be able to use the Wii Balance Board as well as the Wii Wheel and Wii Speak and integrate your own Mii character to customize your own Tetris games.

I quite enjoyed the first one, and if thatâ€™s anything to go by, then Tetris Party Deluxe could be another hit for the Tetris name. Itâ€™s no AAA title, but it should be great fun and keep you entertained for hours on end.

Tetris Party Deluxe is set to hit the shelves over in the States in June but no release date has yet been released for the European version of the game, but I canâ€™t see it being that far behind.
