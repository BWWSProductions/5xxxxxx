,albokid89,2011-03-04T07:58Z,why is there 52 files for this? shouldnt it be just one .avi or something???????
,vivatpb5776,2011-03-20T12:38Z,"@albokid89 - The multiple files within the .torrent are the individual compressed files. I still don't understand why people feel the need to compress the file into a .rar or .zip before uploading but whatever.

This is a much better version than anything I have seen. The video is clear and, best of all, wide screen. Unfortunately, I do not see this file streaming well to a large HDTV but it looks great on a mid to large monitor. Thank you"
