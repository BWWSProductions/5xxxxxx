,Ch4m4rt1n,2010-05-28T17:17Z,"As you may know by now, ABC made a terrible decision and chose not to renew our favourite sci-fi-drama series, FlashForward for a second season.

If you want to bring it back ------> http://saveflashforward.tumblr.com/

Please visit the above mentioned site and help to save Flash Forward!"

Still, there were enough interesting bits to make it worthwhile."
