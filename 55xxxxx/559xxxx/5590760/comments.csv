The one that works... ;o)
Apart the puns, four of them are more or less the same thing with different interfaces, for what I can see. Every some days they throw out a new update, and the newer one isn't asking you to D/L the newer version. Apart this, they are working all the same, but remember to use them only to access sites that you can't reach otherwise, for normal ones there is no reason to use a proxy, as it more or less slows down your connection speed. Never bothered before to use such programs until my country decided to block access to TPB, and now I must if I want to be here. There are proxy sites that allow you to reach blocked sites, but the only way I've got until now to upload files here was using such programs. I keep all of them, and when one doesn't work I try with another until I get it working, and then I go looking for updates..."
