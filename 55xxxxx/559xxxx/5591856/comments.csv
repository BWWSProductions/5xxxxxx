Your minds are being warped off the plane of reality within these topics and subject matter, don't you.

Just like the bible itself cannot be taken literally, it require knowledge in symbolic, knowledge in translating metaphor, decoding of the subtext etc, etc.

If you are not an intellectual and biblical scholar yourself, it's very easy to be manipulated and led astray by those who are and use the bible as a weapon and tool to their own ends, to have others do their bidding to very questionable agendas.

The material presented by some of these people is so far off the mark it should be illegal, because all too many people soak all this stuff up like sponges and think they are being guided into truth.

But it's anything but truth, only elements of truths and reality, spun and presented in certain ways.

Many of the people try to say they were involved in dark occult, like in the Prophecy Club, but how sure are you all that these people ever became good people, how do you really know they just denounce in order to lead others astray?

Some of you people want to try taking some advice from people outside tight Cristian circles, because whilst you are keeping in them or kept in them, you can only perceive from that single viewpoint.

Were you to ask about these things by talking with an atheist psychologist for example, you'd have it explained how your minds are being manipulated, sometimes with very negative results.

However many people i know will have strong minds and will view things objectively and be discerning, this sort of material can have terrible consequences on the minds of all too many.

Please remember, the people who release material such as this are very clever and know exactly what effects it is likely to have, especially upon members of Christian cults, where followers are being brainwashed into acting against establishment and status quo as compelling them that such are evil aliens and satanic masons etc.

No, i mean really, do not take everything from those saying they are good Christians for granted.

I don't know them, i am merely saying, question their motives as much as you are compelled to question that of those with beliefs alternative to Christianity and those in governments, they people telling you to accept what they say blindly and call everybody and everything outside of themselves are dangerous people, they cite the bible chapter and verse and ask you to unquestionably accept their words as translations of the word of god.

But i can tell you, far from rejecting the bible, Satanists know the bible off by heart, they assimilate into churches and Christian groups and to those unknowing, will seem so knowledgeable about the bible it compels unquestioning belief in what they say, because they seem to know so much, but the reasons they are so schooled in the bible, is so they can manipulate others by it's use, there's none so knowledgeable about the bible and biblical affairs than Satanists themselves.

Your own book warns you about these people who create the untold amounts of this sort of material in this information tech' age, but you do not seem to question it, like your bible says to do.

I'm not just saying that to turn you against it, i want you to simply question it and their motives before you follow blindly.

Don't take my word for it, find out for yourselves.

Again, i don't mean everybody downloading this stuff, many will do so out of simple interest, be of strong will and mind and see this stuff objectively, but as i'm aware of what cults are like and i know they use the Internet to disseminate to others and much of this stuff is dodgy when presented in certain ways and compulsion in communities and groups, i say this to those in tight christian communities who are asked to listen to nothing but what their shown and given to read by other so called christian intellectuals.

They are in very real danger of being brainwashed into believing things w"

It never ceases to amaze me just how much total garbage these zealots spew out as absolute ""truth"".

Completely psychotic IMO."
