[V],twentyforty,2010-05-31T11:17Z,"@zmacdaddy8: You should ask - politely. Your Comment sounds as one you've got from your ISP. First some ""spanking"" and ""Thanks"" at the end, right? 

I would ask you to look rest of my answer. There, pay close attention on Date: and Size: line.

So, you should ask yourself: ""Where is that torrent when is needed?""

My answer is: Dingoes ate it. As I remember, I found PROPER version (downloaded THREE of several GB each, REMOVED (before anyone else) nasty watermark and lost about 5-6 hours in total. Why more than a month torrent is dead and therefore was removed you can figure by yourself.

What was the date of your ""objection""?
Jesus... SMALL VERSION WAS ENCODED AND UPPED IN APRIL.

Is there any difference between that one and new one?

Yes, there is - a size. Pluto even said that to you."
