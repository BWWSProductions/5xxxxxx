Any knowledge you wish to share would be great.. thank you.."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-29T08:37Z,"@pluto999: I did. Anyone persistent enough can still find my articles all around the net. My software too. Unfortunately, my two sites are down, one went history three years ago and one get down last year, when ownership of domain couldn't be payed by me anymore. Hosting cost money, and honestly, I go to bed hungry, almost every day. 
And what is more important, I do not have energy or motives to do so anymore. 
I started to watermark my releases just half year ago, when people made serious money by uploading my stuff on MU, RS and HF and on few places else, earning the bucks-for-clicks just by that.
I never have profited money-wise even by one cent, never ever.
And - few people thanked and hundredths have insulted me on any way imaginable."
,ltorrentstorm,2010-06-04T07:27Z,"Very nicely written and explained.  I admire the time and effort to educate.  I've played mp4 movies with my Media Player HC, standalone even, and they all work perfectly.  

I'm learning about mp4 and mkv more and more, because I like the small sizes and my bandwidth allowance is limited.  So, many thanks, and will visit your pages daily.

I apologize for the uncouth and rude behavior of those who did not appreciate your fine work and effort. I've been in the same boat many times. Still, they say the World is a better place because of us.  But like you, sometimes I doubt.  I just don't see it, if you know what I mean."
