Game Notes

Blur is the ultimate powered-up racing experience,
dropping you into electrified action with a mass of cars
targeting the finish line and battling each other as they
trade paint in both single player and multiplayer action.
Travel the globe from L.A. and San Francisco to Spain, the
UK and more to take on the best the streets have to offer.
Utilize an arsenal of power-ups like nitro speed boosts,
shock attacks, efensive shields, and landmines to beat
your rivals across the finish line. You choose how and
when to use your arsenal of powerups for ultimate impact
in a race where the outcome is never certain. In Blur the
storyline plays out in the single player campaign. Here
players assume the role of an up-and-coming racer who is
looking to make a name for himself in the underground
racing scene, but the competition is fierce. As you take
on the series of races, you'll meet a bunch of recurring
characters. Some of these characters will be rivals,
others perhaps will act as mentors, and some may be
something else entirely. The only thing that is certain in
the world of Blur is that in a race there are winners and
losers, and racers will do anything to reach the finish
line first.

Just an update, i uninstalled the game again, did a fresh install, appied the new vitality patch + new crack and it seems to be working fine now, it juddered once then carried on, so cheers for the up.  I think its a good game."

Copy and Paste the Blur exe in the backup folder from Update 2 into the Blur Dir then update.

It all updated for me but still I may have done something wrong as I am getting a couple odd graphical issues with the game.

1:-Pictures of won cars end up being two gray boxes.

2:-When hitting a wall at very high speed small black cubes can be seen in the blur effect during impact.

Other wise the game appears to be running pretty much smooth."

,JackAsses,2010-06-14T03:38Z,"To anyone really into racing games, this may only merely tickle your senses... The concept is enjoyable, but the physics are horrible in my opinion. Doesnt even compare to games like Dirt2 or gran turismo. The graphics are nothing special. In fact I think Dirt2 has more eye candy all-around then this game and it was released what a year ago? Anyone who says this game is amazing is crazy... But like assholes, everyones got an opinion. If youre a casual gamer, you'll probably enjoy this. If youre a serious racer, you will definitely be disappointed... Fun, but definitely not addictive like some of the other racers out there. Again, just my opinion... killfate, you are one annoying motherfucker..."
