[color=deepskyblue][b]Hereâ€™s a KMS activator for the recently released Office 2010. Via this method you will have to re-activate this every 180 days. Twice a year ainâ€™t too bad ;) . Enjoy!

Description:
Microsoft Office 2010 gives you powerful new tools to express your ideas, solve problems, and connect with people. Office 2010 lets you work how, when, and where you want, letting you get things from a PC, the Web, and even a smartphone.

Use Office 2010 virtually anywhere: PC, phone, browser
With Microsoft Office 2010, you can review and do minor editing on Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote 2010 documents, virtually anywhere, by using Office Web Apps from more locations on more devices.

Keep your people productive on the go. Office 2010 lets you access and edit documents stored on a server while youâ€™re offline with SharePoint Workspace 2010, and then automatically syncs these changes when youâ€™re back online. So you stay productive while on the go.[/b][/color]
