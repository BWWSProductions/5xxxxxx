,shilalydawg2,2011-02-14T17:38Z,"@my_brain_hurts

KMS activators show up as a Trojan Hacktool.Backdoor on most anti-virus solutions. (AVG, MalwareBytes, and Norton for sure.)
It's a false positive of course. Good anti-virus programs almost always pick up crack programs as a virus because the coding is very similar. You've nothing to worry about; however, if you're still sketchy, don't download the program. The KMService.exe will go away whenever you uninstall the KMS program.

There's a reason DibyaTPB has a green skull and his torrent has 1000+ seeders. If you don't trust it, don't download.

Thanks for the up, Dibya."

Steps:
1) Remove any old versions of Microsoft Office
2) Download mini-KMS_Activator_v1.053.exe (contained in this download)
4) Run mini-KMS_Activator_v1.053.exe and validate
5) Re-run the activator after 180 days (you can do this every 180 days with no limits)
6) Sit back and enjoy the fact that Microsoft is slightly less rich for you not giving them money for their shitty software

,cldocx,2011-03-10T17:26Z,The activator does work.  Be warned though it does jack up your registry.  Took me 2 1/2 hours to fix the problems it caused.  That's the nature of the beast.  Keep in mind you now have a 400 dollar office suite for free.  Well worth the time.  Great upload DibyaTPB.  Thanks a bunch. 
,slowtyper,2011-03-14T04:56Z,"Sorry to sound like a noob but I'm having a huge problem that a few other people on here have also had, with no solution that I've read.

I installed the Office Professional 2010 from TBP, I download this torrent however I can't run the file!  I run the file and nothing happens.  I have downloaded a few other torrents that supposedly have the same file and the same thing...nothing runs, no popup, nothing.....I have turned off AVAST and also shut off my windows firewall and same thing.  

Please help!"

,JubJub1991,2011-04-21T17:52Z,"For those of you who are getting the copying files error, UNINSTALL YOUR ANTI-VIRUS.  Some A-V still block the activator from working even when you close them out.  Especially AVG.  Should work like a charm if you uninstall it"
,setotitan,2011-04-23T00:09Z,"*** EVERYONE GETTING THE 30 DAY TRIAL READ THIS ***

I was having the same issue, apparently it stems from starting off the process with bunk key and trying to jump right into the KMS activator. I think a major issue comes from lack of description on what the buttons themselves do, so I'll run that down quickly then address the fix to the 30 day issue."
,setotitan,2011-04-23T00:10Z,"""Install / Uninstall KMService""
This is pretty straight forward, it installs the KMS Activator. If you try and run any of the other processes it will kick it over to an emulator. Which should work fine, however installing the prog is a surefire way to avoid emulation glitches.

""Activation Office 2010 VL""
Clicking this button is what creates the dummy keys and faux activation which gives you the 180 day trial.

""Activation Check Office 2010""
This will check the status of your activated keys, letting you know how long you have left on your trial period. So if you're not sure if you have the 30 or the 180 days, or if you're wondering how many more days you have before you need to run the activator again click this button."

,setotitan,2011-04-23T00:12Z,"""Key Manager Office 2010 VL""
This button will take you to a menu that will let you delete active keys for each Office product. If you find yourself in the situation you need to delete keys do so according to what package you installed. i.e. If you just installed Word, delete the Word key. However if you installed the Office suite, delete the Office key. Don't go line by line deleting Word, Excel, etc.

""Rearm Office 2010""
When your 180 days are up, or if at any point you want to go back to a fresh 180 day trial, this is the button you'll need to click. Think of it as a reset button. If at any point you want to get back to 180 trial, you'd click this first, then the ""Activation Office 2010 VL"" button."
,setotitan,2011-04-23T00:13Z,"Now based on the above explanation if you're only getting the 30 day activation you should know what to do. However if you're still somewhat of a n00b and or you're high, I'll spell it out for you ;) You're only getting the 30 day activation because your original keys suck. You need to click the ""Key Manager Office 2010 VL"" button to delete your bunk key. I for example had the ""Professional Plus 2010"" suite installed, so I just selected that option and the keys were deleted. Then you chose the ""Rearm Office 2010"" button to reset everything, and lastly select the ""Activation Office 2010 VL"" button to implement your 180 trial. To verify that all worked, click the ""Activation Check Office 2010"" button and if it says 180 days, congrats. If it still say 30 days, you fail at following instructions. Re-read this information from the beginning.

I hope this clears up some confusion."

great application, MSE indicates a virus ( keygen) but it doesn't mean any harm to me. "
,liftedoffkaya,2012-01-17T14:21Z,"To answers any questions about: HackTool:Win32/Keygen is the detection for a tool that generates keys for illegally-obtained versions of various software products.

There are no obvious symptoms that indicate the presence of HackTool:Win32/Keygen on an affected machine.
Alert notifications or detections of this malware from installed antivirus or security software may be the only other symptom(s).

Microsoft Security Essentials detects malware: Hacktool:Win32/Keygen which it thinks is the  KMS application and then removes it but just re download when you need to activate again! anyway Thank You for you work!"
