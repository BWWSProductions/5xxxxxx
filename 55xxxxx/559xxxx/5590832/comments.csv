Corrupt governments are corrupt. Way more people die every year from prescription drugs than all of the illegal drugs combined by far.  On the other hand, doctors can prescribe you Marinol which is thc in pill for so why would they let people smoke it legally when they can just have a drug company manufacture it and make tons of money? You can always move to holland and go to a cafe and smoke whenever you damn well please."

,rchard91,2010-07-28T03:16Z,i dont really know why they say weed/pot is bad... i smoke pot for 1 year and half now... it makes me feel good.. not like alcohol... it makes me depress..
,27825634,2012-03-17T03:38Z,"we all know the hydro is a true gift from on high, but we all need to disassociate the ""high"" word from our vocabulary and even thoughts if we wish to accomplish anything with this great power of marijuana movement; we need to change the world, and to do that we need to change ourselves first. First by thought, then by action. If we can completely disassociate the ""criminal stoner"" vibe and look, their will be actual hope for this ignorant world that at the moment is quite difficult to bear through even despite this shitty economy. We smoke cannabis to feel BETTER, not intoxicated, not because im a ""slave to the drug""(addicted), but because life is simply depressing sometimes, and we all need healthy releases. and to a conclusion, if it was true that ""DRUGS"" are all bad, then why do all of us use them so erratically, coffee for one, is THE BIGGEST ""gateway drug"" of them all if the gateway theory was accurate. TOGETHER WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLDS UNFORGIVABLE IGNORANCE AS IT SITS TODAY; WE HAVE TO, OR ITS NOT A WORLD I TRULEY BELIEVE ANYONE OF YOU WHO ACTUALLY CARE ENOUGH TO BELIEVE IN SACRED PLANTS SUCH AS CANNABIS AND LIFE AS WE SHOULD KNOW IT, WOULD WANT TO LIVE IN."
