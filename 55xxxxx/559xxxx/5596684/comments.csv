:-("
,LordMarbury,2011-09-28T15:19Z,"You upload the sample as an AVI, but put everything else in about 15 RAR folders. Ridiculous waste of time. Either upload the rip as it is or leave it alone. No one wants to have to unzip that many rars just for a movie. It's not rocket science mate, don't make it more complicated than it needs to be. "
,RaphSai,2012-01-20T21:09Z,"the only reason to RAR is to spread virus's. Come on, you have a pink skull. You should know better."
