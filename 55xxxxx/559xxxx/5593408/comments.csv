,blu-momo,2010-05-27T11:08Z,ok. I was looking for your usual kind of size (350-400 Mib). Thanks for link i will try to manage to get it. 
,D07792,2010-05-27T11:32Z,"i really appreciate the link. I cant use the TPb search engine. It is showing over loaded. Try later.

Thanks"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-27T11:56Z,"@blu-momo: I get that when I've seen your question and I tried to give best answer I can without saying the obvious: I can't. I have at least 50 encoded movies waiting to be upped. It is like that for months. 

I hope you can understand my choices, I try to avoid whenever I can, upping the torrent for movies that are already here, within reasonable boundaries of sizes and quality. I am well aware why you and anybody else asks for my encode and it eats me inside whenever I must decline requests."
