,Blumiere,2010-06-06T02:22Z,"I'm pretty sure you're going to have to force PAL if it's anything like NTSC or NTSC-J. Just wait for the PAL version to be uploaded like I am. Too many things go wrong if you try playing one with a different region. You could always attempt to patch the game with regionfrii if you have a modchip, though."
