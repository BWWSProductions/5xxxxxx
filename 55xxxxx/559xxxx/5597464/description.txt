In his debut album, Anoop Desai does something very few pop-R&B artists would dare to attempt - to craft an entire album with his richly toned, booming vocal in the front and center. Unlike so many of its contemporaries, the production in this album is rather understated, even minimalist at times. Instead of flashy production and excessive bells and whistles, Desai's booming voice are intricately layered to hold the entire album together in a simply commanding, yet extremely sensual, manner. This album is for those of us who have been longing for a return of rich, yet contemporary pop-R&B voice on our iPods as well as on the radio.
