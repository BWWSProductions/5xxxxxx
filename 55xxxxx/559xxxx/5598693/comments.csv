You are totally an unreliable cry baby. People like you don't belong in TPB. You should even stop uploading all you sucky uploads. When you upload read the comments to learn and shut the fuck up! If you are uploading so people can tell you how good you are blah blah you complicated unsure of self low life, you can take you shit elsewhere. So fuck you!

Come on guys why are you begging him! I'm a big fan of F1 for years and have been to many circuits, but if this baby is not going to do it let him be. We now know he doesn't belong here.

albiondean you suck our dicks for forgiveness.

More to follow..... "

,PI22,2010-06-12T17:30Z,"Audio sounds a big pumped up, plus out of phase. Are you using something to process it like a compressor plus some kind of enhancer?

Video is fine. Thanks for all the effort anyway to keep The Doctor in the air and all the best."
