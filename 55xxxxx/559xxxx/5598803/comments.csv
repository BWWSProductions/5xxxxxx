You guys rock! I've been trying to dld this torrent for quite some time, and while there are several trusted individuals, with green skulls, it doesn't mean there torrents are burnable to dvd. Axxo, Raymondhome, FXG, lions team, extremezone, are just a few who leave there movies encrypted, and I find that very disturbing. Your movies are the only ones that I've found to have consistant quality, and burn tested! PLZ keep up the good work.. I have but one request, could you PLZ put up a copy of ""gang of roses"" would really appreciate it! There's only one available on TPB, and it's RARs - don't like 'em! Any way will check out this dld from you, and as usual, I'm sure I won't be disappointed. Thanks again for all the great movies!"
