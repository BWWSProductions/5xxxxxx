can't imagine what kind of SICK f. mind you should have to enjoy anything like that...
seriously, this is made by totally f*d-up degraded perverts... 
the poor girl should've just screwed the other one with tons of ""normal"" toys and get creamed would be more pleasant to watch, but not this...
***** I'm gonna have f. nightmares now for don't know how long..... sssshhhhhiiiitttt..... 
So, this is NOT for normal fucking guys (and definitively NOT for girls....LOL=)"

But, you see they took three gaps in that? That's so's she can talk about it. So long as it's an isolated supply (100v and a few tens of mA max) and you don't touch their chest or head, it's safe. But it is uber kinky and I like it! :P If you want to mess around with it, buy a TENS unit; it feels almost exactly like buzzing, vibrating, pins and needles. If you mess around with where the pads are, it can feel incredible and like nothing else. NEVER fuck around with anything else electrical. Especially anything that plugs into the mains. If it has a wall plug, forget it! The mains is an entirely different animal and can easily hurt or kill you. A battery powered TENS unit attached to a girls pussy won't. Buuzzz, tingle... urgh! :P"
