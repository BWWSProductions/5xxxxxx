Wikipedia - The Very Best of The Stone Roses is a compilation album released by Silvertone Records in 2002. It features most of their singles plus album tracks including "Breaking into Heaven" and "This is the One", all of which were remastered for this album. It charted at #19 in the UK and spent nine weeks in the Top 75. Silvertone has been derided for supposedly cashing in on their famous signing. However, The Very Best of is a fairly comprehensive compilation in that it gathers all the Stone Roses' best known tracks in the versions that are generally regarded as best. The tracklisting was decided upon by band members. The previous compilation The Complete Stone Roses had been criticised for not including material from the group's second album, whilst including inferior edits and alternative versions of many songs.  Not only does the compilation contain six songs from their 1989 debut but the album is structured to open and close with the same songs in their album versions.

Amanzon.com - The Very Best of the Stone Roses is just what the world needs--another repackaging of the best of a band whose meagre album output (just two albums) inspired not only a whole host of indie rock bands across the UK, but also a generation of record company execs intent on making new money for old rope. To be honest, there's nothing to be found on The Very Best of the Stone Roses that doesn't already exist on the aforementioned albums--their seminal self-titled debut and their long-delayed (and inferior) follow-up The Second Coming. Granted, it's always a pleasure to hear some of this band's biggest songs, including "I Wanna Be Adored", "Made of Stone", "I Am the Resurrection", "Ten Storey Love Song" and "Love Spreads". However, all but the most die-hard Stone Roses completists will be hard pressed to justify shelling out their hard-earned money for some new John Squire artwork on the cover and a rare interview transcript in the liner notes. --Ted Kord Description 'The Very Best Of The Stone Roses' brings together for the first time tracks from the bands eponymous debut and their follow up album 'Second Coming'. Charting their rise through the 'Madchester' scene of the early nineties with their distinct brand of 60's influened indie rock, the album also features the singles 'Sally Cinnamon', 'Fools Gold' and 'One Love'.
