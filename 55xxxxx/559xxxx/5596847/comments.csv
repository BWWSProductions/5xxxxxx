,orvil58,2010-05-29T20:50Z,Is it ntsc or PAL ?
,Blumiere,2010-06-06T02:27Z,"Pretty sure it's NTSC. The file name is virtually the same as another ISO I downloaded, except instead of ""smg2-ind.iso"" that ISO was called ""ind-smg2.iso""."
,MrSan.,2012-06-05T18:14Z,I have a copy of this game and the disc doesn't works on my 4.0U Wii. But I don't know if the files are exactly the same of this torrent.
