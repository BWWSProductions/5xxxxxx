I Always split my shows after i got my hands on the tracklist and then I listen through the show and then to set my own cut-markings.. So how big is the chance that your files are exactly the same as mine? 
Not so big I presume..
So do your own splitting before stealing other peoples work instead.. 
The Actual real torrent:

[T],-inspiron-,2010-05-28T11:01Z,"sorry to tell u that ur wrong , ;) , i used to split ASOT for more than a year , was uploading them to mininova before the distribution content thing , so i couldn't upload them there anymore , and i used this profile to do it , so before accusing for stealing , i download the cue file ready http://cuenation.com/ then split them , so if u do the same and the same cut was for both of us , doesn;t mean stealing , so i've been doing my own splitting and sometimes i don't need the cue file , and for your knowledge , i've been uploading and splitting other asot 6 hours earlier than u did , check and u'll know ;) , nice to meet u by the way"
[V],IndexTrance,2010-05-28T11:48Z,"Yeah, I know you have splitted them before me earlier, but this one you obviously have taken from me.. But anyway you can't be inspiron because his name on TPB is 'Captim'.. 
But keep stealing my torrents, this is the pirate industry after all... "
[T],-inspiron-,2010-05-28T11:59Z,"who is captim!!! i heard he stopped uploading along time ago , this one has nothing different from the other , i'm already new here and these are my torrent and told u how i split them , and i don't need to steal especially from u , i do my own torrents and no need to be that mean but obviously u split the tracks the same way i do , and i copied the track list from that site , after all we're all here for the same reason , and if i knew there's someone uploading them split i wouldn't bother But i'm fan of that"
