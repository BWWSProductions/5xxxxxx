Welcome to the lubuntu project. The objective of the lubuntu project is to create a faster, more lightweight and energy saving variant of Ubuntu by using LXDE, The Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment, as its default GUI. The ultimate goal of the lubuntu project is to earn official endorsement from Canonical. Members of the lubuntu team take care of LXDE and other packages that are part of the lubuntu installation. Please join us and contribute creating a lighter, less resource hungry and more energy-efficient Linux Desktop. It is our goal to make Linux run on more cost-effective machines and MIDs besides Intel CPUs based on ARM and Mips.

We are coordinating contributions to lubuntu through Launchpad here: https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-desktop
