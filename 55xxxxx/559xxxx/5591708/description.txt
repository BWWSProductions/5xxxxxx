1944 - The Nazis had kidnapped a professor of physics and his daughter to construct a time machine. Years later, in the 21st century - 3 explorers detect the hidden laboratory and try to reactivate the time machine... A crazy film from and with WELLE:ERDBALL that takes you along on a trip through the time.

The Movie is what you call a Scene Film , its a Gothic Movie for the Gothic Scene by one of the gretest Bands ever.

Its a B-Movie so if you like Welle and you like Gothic , european gothic that is , you might love this.
