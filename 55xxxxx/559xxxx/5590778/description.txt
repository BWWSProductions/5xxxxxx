         There is evidence that suggests we experienced 20th century   
         alien contact. In 1942, the Battle of Los Angeles involved    
         the US military and Air Defense allegedly fighting a          
         UFO. WWII Allied Air Force planes were buzzed by balls of     
         light that some think could have been extraterrestrial. And   
         the alleged crash of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico   
         in 1947 propelled the world into the age of UFOs. For         
         decades, some people have been searching for the sounds       
         of extraterrestrial intelligence, while others have been      
         sending messages out into deep space. What would happen if    
         aliens answered... or came calling? What protocols exist      
         to determine who would speak on behalf of mankind, and how    
         might we communicate? What happens if they return? Some       
          believe they already have.
