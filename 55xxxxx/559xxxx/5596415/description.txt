1 0 C C - First Line-Up (1972-1976)

In the first half of the 70s 10CC attracted attention with their fresh and jaunty pop-music style. The group consisted of two strong songwriting teams with different approaches: The more commercial part Goldman/Stewart and the artistic couple Godley/Creme. "Somewhere in Hollywood" or "One Night in Paris" prove the four guy's ability in creating not only nice ditties but also complex and astounding pop-jewels.
After the departure of Godley and Creme in 1976, despite the band's further commercial success, the demise was inevitable.

To some albums rare bonus tracks had been added later. I call them "The Holy Crap", but nevermind, they're hard to find and i don't have them in FLAC. They are located in a separate MP3-folder.
