The only thing you have to do is using this version und putting all previously uploaded files in  the new torrent folder. Then force a re-check (Âľtorrent). If your last download was complete, you should have an availability-ratio of 97%. Now you are able to get the missing file (previously damaged) from this new torrent. "
