,290408,2010-05-27T10:21Z,"I would appreciate if some people could help me seed this, even if a few only want to do it for 24 - 48 hours. I'm the only constant seed, as soon as people get to 100% downloaded they just remove the torrent and fail to upload.

Comments on the torrent are welcome, let me and others know how you found it."

,290408,2010-06-12T15:10Z,"What are you using to play the film? I have no problems playing it and I've just checked again and watched from 08:00 until 12:30 in the film and found no problems at all including from 10:40 onwards.

Perhaps you don't have the required codecs."
,290408,2010-06-12T15:12Z,Just had a look on Google and it looks as if it's a common problem that you get if your using the AVS Media Demo version to play these files. Try getting a crack and having the full version or playing in a different program. Just attempted it in Windows Media Player and no problems. Check your codecs also.
,Thermo18,2010-07-01T06:27Z,"14stone is right after 30 minutes you get a constant repetitive voice which overrides audio. It has nothing to do with the codecs it is overwritten into the video. Seems to me maybe someone fucked up this version and is spreading it to the others. I have played it on several players and have almost all the codecs you could expect, I would advise not downloading this one. Good while it lasted tho."
,290408,2010-09-05T01:39Z,"It would be pointless to purposely fuck up a version and spread it, what kind of idiot would do that, and waste their bandwidth doing it? The only reason it's not working is due to something to do with your end. The film works perfectly here and I have downloaded it on a work computer as well and a few of my friends have downloaded it and it works fine. Get the required codecs and don't use AVS Media Demo version or your going to get that repetitive voice on ANY film because your DEMO has expired."
,lovetowatch,2010-10-09T11:31Z,"This appears to have been encoded by someone using the demo version of AVS. The audio warning is Hardcoded into the audio track. Do not download. 
@290408 You made a mistake own up to it and take down this file before you cause any more grief."
,290408,2010-10-10T02:35Z,"I never encoded it, I downloaded it a while ago like I said in the write up. It appears maybe there is a problem from what your saying, which I'm not disputing because obviously I can't see what's appearing when your playing it on your PC, but what I don't understand is why I do not have any problem at all watching it and I don't have AVS or anything?"
,F110,2010-11-06T18:41Z,"Just downloaded (and seeded to 122%). I've never heard of ""AVS Media,"" but I too get that constant voice-over on both Windows Media Player and VLC Media Player. I'm also using K-Lite codec pack v500f. Great to see an extended version, but the voice-over does kind of ruin it. If you're thinking of downloading, be warned.

,Pirate_singer01,2011-05-17T21:54Z,290408 I will download this and help you seed it!!!
,skatanafate,2011-09-18T20:07Z,"Don't bother with this release, and stop seeding it. After 10-15 minutes, a constant repetitive female voice says ""AVS Media demo"" or something, every few seconds (a bit like the voices that ruin the music in some promo albums). Repeat, STOP SEEDING AND DOWNLOADING IT."
,Lockers1234,2011-10-12T06:56Z,"Thank you for uploading this, you really can't find an extended version for this movie that much. However, I'm troubled by the (possibly) hardcoded voice that says ""AVS Media Demo"". But, other than that, it's all good and, luckily, the subtitles are correct. "
,maTTTen,2011-10-15T13:27Z,"Dont dowload this one! The fucktard ho uploaded it has added a voice that says ""AVS Media Demo"" all the time after like 30min. "
,bobusboy,2011-10-19T04:38Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD

Around the 30 minute mark there is a voice which speaks over top of the movie over and over and over reminding you that a demo version of some software was used to compress the video. 

I wish I'd read the comments before downloading. 

and @290408  Assholes like you fuck up videos just to piss people off."
,Sheol_,2011-11-07T15:44Z,"Too bad about the voice over, I would have really liked to have seen the extended version but it's not available anywhere."
,ticha44,2011-12-03T02:02Z,"Video very good; Audio only with voice-over
So indeed skip this; WORTHLESS
This is no fun to watch"
