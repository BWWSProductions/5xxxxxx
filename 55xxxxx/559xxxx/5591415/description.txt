'The Fisk Jubilee Singers' choir was formed (in 1871),
from former slaves, to raise money for a school. They
toured Britain in the 1870s. British audiences loved
them. In particular the Welsh.

This is the story of their tour of Britain, and of their
rapport with a Welsh journalist.

This is the last completed work by Adrian Mitchell, who died last year.
