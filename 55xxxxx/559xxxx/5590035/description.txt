This contains music by Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915) from my personal collection. This isn't your retarded classical top 100 mozart collection, this is real repertoire.

All of the preludes and piano sonatas are here, as well as other miscellaneous pieces.

Encoded in FLAC compression-level 5.



**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"



If there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.
