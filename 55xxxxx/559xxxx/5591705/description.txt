Love can be painful. Very painful. The intriguing-on-the-outside, twisted-and-tortured-on-the-inside Tara sets her sights on the unassuming guy-next-door Ray. Their innocent flirting turns into a regretful one night stand which he hopes to put behind him. Tara has different plans for their relationship. It becomes horrifically apparent that she refuses to be cast aside and is willing to go to sick extremes to keep her man as people in Ray's life are met with torturous ends. Amidst this violently twisted love story unfolds a profound social commentary on love and the effects of violence.
