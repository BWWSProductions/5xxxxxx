[V],globeplus,2010-05-27T22:49Z,I´D LIKE TO ASK TO THE USERS OF THIS NEW UPDATE IF IS WORKING THE UPDATE OR NOT . THANK YOU .
,Ahroo,2010-05-27T23:52Z,I put these 3 files in place of the files that match them and I haven't had screen blacking out issue yet like I did before I replaced them. I don't get the update screen when I start either so this seems to be the real deal. One file is a replacement crack and the other two go in the cache folder. I have the old crack and cache files on my desktop in the case I need to revert back to them but I think I'm good to go and can delete them.
[V],globeplus,2010-05-28T00:14Z,"The question is : YOU GET ANY UPDATE MESSAGE AFTER LAUNCHING THE GAME ? PLEASE , I´LL BE THANKFULL IF YOU ASK STRAIGHT THIS QUESTION . THANK YOU ."
,Ahroo,2010-05-28T01:19Z,No I don't get any update message after launching the game now.
[V],globeplus,2010-05-28T02:57Z,"Thank you very much for your infomation , to me was ok too and i hope the next update take some time because from yesterday for today was a new update available and it looks that the game can be beeing updated with frequency and every time they have a new update you get the reference to that in the launch of the game , so if that happen later in sometime , you know that is normal , the indication to a new update will appear in the launch of the game but you can play the game anyway without that . thank you again for your straight answer and happy game ."

[V],globeplus,2010-05-30T14:01Z,"THIS UPDATE STILL WORKING TOTALLY FINE , TODAY 30/05 , ABSOLUTLY CHECKED AND COMPROVED , I THINK IT IS SOME VICIOUS GUYS OUT THERE PUTTING NEGATIVE VOTES FOR NO REASON WHAT SO EVER !!!
LIVE AND LET LIVE AND DO WORK FOR YOURSELVES AND STOP TRYING TO PREJUDICATE THE OTHERS WORK .
I REPEAT TODAY STILL WORKING FINE THIS UPDATE , IS IMORAL THE NEGATIVE VOTES ."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-31T18:01Z,"i can guarantee to you :
today 31/05 , still ok this update removing that update indication , in my file i can give you 100% of shore of that . i tested again today ."
,DevlinXIII,2010-06-01T22:10Z,"Hello, this update isn't working for me, before installing the update the game was running fine but now it exits abnormally after opening, what can I do ?? please advice"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-02T03:38Z,you should backup your file before trying an update but for my file this update works perfectly beside that i think you are lying because don´t make sense what you are saying but independtly is always reccomendable backup the files before trying anyway and finally you can download the crack again if that is really true that by the way is the same work that with what i am presenting in this update .
,DevlinXIII,2010-06-03T09:17Z,"woah globe, to come and say that I'm a liar, i'm a big fan of your work and u practically insult me, i was indeed telling the truth, I didn't make a backup cause all the other comments said it worked perfectly and cause I trust you, well not anymore if u jump out on anyone that says ""it's not working i need help"", way to let ppl down, nicee..."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-03T17:35Z,"Well , maybe you don´t have a card of associate on the concorrence and i apologyse myself for that , the true is that i get too many negative votes to a perfect work in a update that you can really install anywhere and adequate for a directplay file , in my file i tested the update almost everyday after what happen with the update 1 that only a take a day or something before a new update was needed but this update , really update game and remove the necessity of a update indication , with me still working , so we can say that is a more stable update than the first one and i believe to much more users of my file too and what happen to you really doesn´t make sense and i thinking you was spreading bullshit in my really nice working update , please check what really happen because certainly , today June,3 i tested again and the game still running perfectly without a new update indication and i really can guarantee you that , i hope that you have in mind that in case of this update get any problem he was removed immediatly like i did on the 1st one after the constation that a new update was available and update was remaining because of that , so first i suggest and you probably already did applied the original crack and if you try the update again backup first , the update is really hat 3 specific files well applied in the game folder , that´s all and with worked always absolutly perfect and i still recomend this update because he is perfect for directplay and even for real copys , the user of the game don´t have the obrigatority to have game installed in program files or program files (x86) , you can really apply anywhere you have the game folder on the computer , the installation update have the same content but the game folder must be in program files or programs files (x86) , well maybe i make a wrong judgement of you but rthat what you said didn´t maked any sense to me , that´s for shore , irepeat , today : june,3  a week later after having this new update available  , THIS UPDATE STILL WORKING PERFECTLY ."
,deepak_rokz,2010-06-05T15:38Z,do i need to download update 1 also
,joonior83,2010-06-20T01:19Z,"Downloading now, but to be honest ALL of Globe's torrents have worked for me, so I have faith in this.

He does a hell of a job, and conveniently enough most of his torrents will fit on my 4gb flash drive so I can transfer them to my laptop :-)

Sometimes, guys, you need to make sure you're doing everything properly. Maybe you didn't perform a step right?"
