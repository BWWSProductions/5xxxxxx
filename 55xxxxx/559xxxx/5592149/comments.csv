About 50 years ago I watched Battle beyond the sun in the original Russian version (which I would like to download) and now thanks to you I can watch it again in this bastardized version by that film student Coppola, at least it reminds me of the other film and its funny naive propaganda. KEEP IT UP, through you IÂ´m re-living my long ago youth and all the SF movies I used to watch..."

I am far from done!!"
