,vivatpb5776,2011-06-23T14:34Z,"Per this website:

http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=21581

Sharepoint Designer 2007 is FREE from Microsoft. I cannot confirm whether or not this was available for free from Microsoft at the time that this .torrent was uploaded but it is FREE now. I would recommend getting the software straight from the source... "
