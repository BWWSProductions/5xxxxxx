CLASSIC!
Personally, my political stance is based on a concept generally known as reality - a very alien concept  to those within your movement.
And going by your conspiracy-theory laden, black and white thinking nonsense designed to pull in the most ignorant, low to no-info voters in America. 
Reality is not even a choice on either side of your invented line."
