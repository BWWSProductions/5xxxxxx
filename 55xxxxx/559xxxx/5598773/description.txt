THE CURE'S CLASSIC 1989 ALBUM REMASTERED WITH AN ADDITIONAL EXTRAS CD OF 20 PERIOD RARITIES AND NEWLY REMIXED LIVE 1989 'ENTREAT PLUS'

Comments Stuart Braithwaite of Mogwai: â€œDisintegration by The Cure is one of the greatest records of all time. It has the feel that only a tiny amount of albums have, that it exists completely in its own universe, immune to context or fashion. I literally cannot imagine the band members in a room playing these songs for the first time, its as if they've always been there. From stunning opener â€œPlainsongâ€ through to â€œUntitledâ€, it is unrelentingly beautiful and achingly sad. Disintegration is a simply wonderful record.â€
