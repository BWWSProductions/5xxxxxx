,tewwyd,2010-05-27T00:57Z,"Thanks as always goose. I love the O&A intro, so i'll vote for keeping it. I'd prefer 128k for R&F, but i'm totally okay with whatever works for you.

Thanks again."
,clauge,2010-05-27T01:03Z,"thanks mg! I am happy w/ the 64k and don't want you to have to do extra work. Regarding the O&A intro, it's fine the way you've been doing it."
,KungFuKane,2010-05-27T02:50Z,"Whatever you decide is OK with me,after all
beggars can't be choosers."
,fuct2000,2010-05-27T03:20Z,"Im just happy as shit to come here everyday and see some R&F love. Whatever you like is what I like Goose!

You're the best."
[V],mothergoose56,2010-05-27T03:46Z,"blackirishlad - yea the VBR 128k is probably overkill for the talk. I A/B'ed it with a 96K though and could tell a slight difference music-wise. I have been told several times that ""the channel only streams at bla bla bla rate"" but it's also a much more efficient more modern codec. The VBR mp3 files are big but are the best way to get HQ and compatibility for everyone. Also I like doing the HQ as a choice for the people seeing as it's usually not going to be the earliest O&A upload. A higher quality R&F won't be more difficult, it's just going to go up a bit later. Some time in the near future I'll be grabbing a seedbox again so I can properly seed some long-overdue archives and the shows will start seeding out much quicker too. "
,punching_munchkin,2010-05-27T05:20Z,All Hail MG... also will be great to get some archived older shows upped. Thanks so much for the time you put into this.
,mserr,2010-05-27T05:40Z,do what you think is best dawg diggity. I dont mind the current setup but I do enjoy the 128k OnA.
,djskittles,2010-05-27T07:50Z,"I like the O&A intro except Ecstasy of Gold everyday. 
As for quality, I'm just looking to get early ups. I do Shu for O&A which lasts me till evening when I can get your R&F. 64k is fine by me and it seems easier on you, so I like it."
