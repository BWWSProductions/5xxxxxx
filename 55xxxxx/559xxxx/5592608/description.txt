Ron and Fez XM/Sirius show commercial-free uncensored 64k mp3 
Rip&Edit by mg56

I need to know if the buddays want me to keep upping in mono 64k 
or switch to something else? Here's the deal, I do from 6 to 3
in WAV, and then I can take my time encoding from quality or
do a quick and dirty mono 64k encode like I do for R&F. 

From here on out, I'm gonna do my best to up the weekend 202 
content that people want. I would really appreciate if maybe a 
couple of peeps can tell when there's repeats and new shows, 
etc -  I don't want to be upping the same torrents (I know 
Weird Medicine will run a ton or repeats between new episodes 
for instance) and I'm not trying to make this a full time job. 

In order to save drive space and encoding time (and to make 
this possible) I will be doing live mp3 encoding for the 
weekend content. My choices are stereo 64k (muddier for 
talk than the R&F mono) or stereo 128k (CBR, a bit bulkier
than my O&A VBR's and definitely better than any 64k). 

If I was to switch to 128k (I could do 96k VBR?) for 
R&F (they play alot of music, it would help in that area)
it would be from WAV's not live (I do the whole thing WAV
for those instances where O&A run over). That means it 
will take longer to re-encode post-recording and could 
slightly delay my uploads. But I'd hate to be doing 
weekend content in nice stereo 128k mp3's and have R&F 
in "good enough for talk" 64k quality. 96k VBR might
be a good compromise. 

Decide what you want. Also should I cut O&A intro at all?
