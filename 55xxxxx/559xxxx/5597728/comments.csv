[V],catflap,2010-05-29T05:01Z,"FAKE!

this is not the first time tvteam has
posted a fake axxo file this week.

axxo's home is the darkside RG website.

there is no mention of axxo returning, and
this title is not listed on axxo's releases page.

@TVTEAM: WHY DO YOU KEEP POSTING
FAKE AXO FILES? VIPS DO NOT POST FAKES!"

,arthoheen,2010-05-29T06:48Z,The file is not FAKE. It is perfectly alright. TVTeam has never let me down. It's just the fact that they have mis-tagged the torrent as an aXXo release.
