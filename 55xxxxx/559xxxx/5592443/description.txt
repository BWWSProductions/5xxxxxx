Wednesday, 26 May 2010


[sebaygo1]


NOTE: Something of a strange first five minutes in today's show [seems like they weren't quite ready to start], but then it gets on schedule.

Ted Anderson -- owner of GCN Radio Network -- is in studio for a few minutes beginning at about 13 min. into hour 3, doing a "live commercial" for his gold business: Midas Resources.

Alex talks with Ron Paul [2nd half of hour 1], a physician and Republican Congressman for the 14th congressional district of Texas. Paul is the founder of the advocacy group Campaign for Liberty and his ideas have been expressed in numerous published articles and books, including End The Fed and The Revolution: A Manifesto. Ron Paul has the most Constitution friendly voting record of any member of Congress since 1937.

Alex also talks with Walter Burien [2nd half of hour 3, through hour 4], an advocate for government fiscal accountability and budgeting. Bubien's documentary, The Biggest Game in Town, exposes government theft behind Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
