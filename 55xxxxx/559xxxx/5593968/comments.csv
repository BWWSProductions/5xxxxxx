anyone else?"
,hachibill,2011-05-15T19:22Z,has audio but no voices...
,blueeyesnoir,2011-06-27T02:09Z,"No idea what the guys talking about no audio are on about, this is perfect.. really I am impressed. How on earth did you manage to get such high quality in a 1.45GiB AVI format?! I can't wait to try this out on my TV (my media player only plays AVI under 2GiB so my range of high quality films is very limited to say the least). Thanks dude! I will be checking out your other uploads.
