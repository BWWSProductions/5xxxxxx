,bubba1991,2010-05-28T02:36Z,Hey Dcrack i am wondering did you want the qualitywings 757 i have an installer and serial but it needs to be cracked
,DCrack,2010-05-28T02:40Z,"@bubba1991 
I'll let you know my friend, we should make a most wanted list, that way when I have some free time I can check it out."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-28T02:55Z,"a top 5 hitlist should be quite easy as everyone seems to want the same few items.
this is a cracking torrent DC, theres some nice props in here, especially the realair beechcraft and the cessna 441, i've put some serious hours on those two this last week."
,gikar,2010-05-28T04:38Z,Most wanted list? Well..EZCA addon should be on the top:)
,DCrack,2010-05-28T05:21Z,"@chuckmamuck 
lol just finished flying the duke, very well made plane! I love the dynamics, gonna be flying it a lot more!
@fsxdude98 
Nothing yet bro, haven't had the time... The little free time I had today I used it cracking the Citation X. I'll let you know.

Good night everyone! And please report back on the citation x crack.. Cheers!"
,aarque,2010-05-28T17:15Z,"Crack, for the life of me I can't illuminate the primary displays. Granted I am not big on checklists, but I really gave it a go, gave up when I couldn't find the DC volts gauges. Seems like all my random flicking and switching should have produced something so I think it is not working. I also have the FS2004 CitationX which does work, so I could use a panel editor to swap in those instruments...

On a side note, this torrent doesn't show up in search, perhaps if you changed your category from ""other"" to ""games>PC"" more people could find it."
,aarque,2010-05-28T17:20Z,"Ok, apparently it is the Pirate Bay search that is letting us down because I also didn't see hitchup's latest torrent..."
,PyrateStyle,2010-05-28T17:37Z,"*Duplicate* @DCrack

You da Mang! Thanks a bunch...Citation X fix works great!. Flew from KLAS to KSFO with no issues except my approach really sucked :) --Pilot Error--
"
,DCrack,2010-05-28T17:44Z,"@mickyfinnnny
I'm confused, does it work? Or does it need cracking?"
,DCrack,2010-05-28T17:46Z,"@PyrateStyle
Thanks for the info! :)"
,DCrack,2010-05-28T17:47Z,"@aarque
Did you see the ESDG documentation about dll.xml?"
,DCrack,2010-05-28T18:06Z,"@mickyfinnnny:
Awesome! Thanks for the info dude.

@everyone:
Bring the next one on the list!! :D"
,gikar,2010-05-28T18:14Z,Ezdok Camera Addon would by great.
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-28T18:28Z,"just read the comments on hitchups UT2 and some say it works and others disagree, be good to know for sure.
the dvd version is large too, 3.3gb, the installer i dl'd was 1.39gb, is that the one that you've been working on DC?"
,DCrack,2010-05-28T18:32Z,"@chuckmamuck
Yup... well the one I worked on for a bit. UT2 is not easy to crack, if there's a working version out there, even if it is 3Gb in size, I would rather crack something else than invest my time in something that's already cracked... Let's keep UT2 on hold for now until we know if hitchup's version works."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-28T18:40Z,"good good, ul'ing 2 of the same dilutes the bandwidth pool and also treading on others toes aint good. 
i'm sure hitchup wouldn't upload it if it had problems anyway or he would of stated it in the description.
i'm ul'ing it now, 2.7% in 90mins, al let ya know next week how it go's. ;)"
,gikar,2010-05-28T18:45Z,I can confirm hitchup's version of UT2 works. Its mdf file+SP1+power pack. It doesnÂ´t require serial number or any activation process.
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-28T18:51Z,"thanks gikar, thats good news."
,DCrack,2010-05-28T20:47Z,@gikar I'll check out EZdock addon ;)
,gikar,2010-05-28T21:13Z,"@DCrack: Great decision:) Thank you. I have link to unwrapped installer if you want. It can be installed, but non of its functions work. It needs some kind of license file, probably based on HW ID."
,DCrack,2010-05-28T21:17Z,"Someone please check the cracked EZca addon and tell me if it works, I don't have time right now to go through all the documentation to see how it works. Here's the link:

,DCrack,2010-05-28T21:18Z,"@gikar
Just saw your comment bro, this one hasn't been cracked.. just the installer, so I guess it's not gonna work.. Try it and let me know, also if it doesn't work tell me what it's supposed to do so I can start somewhere..."
,gikar,2010-05-28T22:06Z,"I tried, yes, its not cracked. Just go to the addons menu if FSX, run that ezdok studio (FSX have to be in window mode) and light up all that buttons."
,gikar,2010-05-28T22:12Z,"If it works, you can walk around virtual cockpit with cursor keys, you ll have head movements, motion effect etc. You can also look around VC with your middle mouse button."
,DCrack,2010-05-28T22:31Z,Is there any other sign?? Is the active label in your EZdok activated in yellow?
,gikar,2010-05-28T22:38Z,"yes, its yellow. Sign? well..just taxi your plane and you surely see the difference. There are many vids on their homepage. im not able to post any links."
,DCrack,2010-05-28T23:02Z,It's cracked! w00t w00t! I'll post the link in a sec

,chuckmamuck,2010-05-29T00:43Z,"same here DC, looks like the EZCA is working perfectly. i can actually hold down my mouse wheel and look around and roll it to zoom in and out.
love the motion movements when charging down the runway and in flight.
nice work man, this is excellent. thankyou.
its like xmas round here. "
,DCrack,2010-05-29T00:55Z,"@chuckmamuck
Lol... Well keep them coming my friend... You know that if I have the time I'll crack it."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-29T02:09Z,"you're a cool guy DC, cheers man."
,fsexer,2010-05-29T03:37Z,"Yea DCrack you ROCK man, thanks again for the CX750 - works just fine here ('cept the throttles act wierd on this bird, almost need to go to cruise thrust to even taxi and when you come up from idle the engins will spool up then die.  This happen to anyone else?)

If you're still takin RQ's  how about the latest 
FSUIPC to go with the Citation and maybe we can get the fadecs working right??  

@aarque, to get the PFD/MFD to display you need to check Page 4 quick start manual.  You need to initialize both FMS to your current position then use mode select unit, turn both to nav and press test button on both sides."
,aarque,2010-05-29T03:52Z,"DC, no I had not read the documentation. Thank you on behalf of Eaglesoft for doing their tech support (of course shame on you on their behalf for giving away the product) and sorry to have taxed you, as if you don't stoke us enough already.

I wish I could return the favor. Perhaps there is an older (FS9) aircraft you would want me to convert and share here."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-29T13:49Z,lol.  ;) 
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-29T19:25Z,"DC
if you want to have a go at the latest FSUIPC as fsexer suggested then you can dl it from the developers site. 
just google FSUIPC4 4.6 and its top of the list, the peter dawson site. 
should be an easy 1 for you dude if you get the time. ;)"
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-29T19:31Z,"i've been looking for the files for the VRS superbug for you to have a go at but i cant find them anywhere. the problem now is finding the uncracked files for you to crack.

has anyones got the vrs superbug?"
,aarque,2010-05-30T20:01Z,"I have the FS9 VRS superslug...and fsexer, thank's for the tip. I am sure that your suggestion will clear the attitude/heading warnings that appear in the display's that DC cracked for us. That is of course if I can figure out how to initialize both FMC's to Friday Harbor or wherever I test the thing. 

I tell you, I have both the FeelThere CitationX and the FS9 ESDG CitationX and neither is as wanky, probably not as accurate either..."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-30T20:08Z,"aarque
could the fs9 vrs superslug be converted to fsx?"
,DCrack,2010-05-31T05:47Z,"Thanks guys, I'll take a look at FSUIPC as soon as I have some time.."

,aarque,2010-06-04T14:57Z,"chuck, sorry I'd missed your question. The VRS Hornet would probably work fine after making a thumbnail (I haven't actually tested it) but I believe there is some implementation that was made available for the ""new"" FSX release. This could be determined by reading the product description for each version.

Bottom line is that it - as FS9 - is new enough altogether that the basic systems (like gauges and animations) would work in FSX; no promises though."
,DCrack,2010-06-06T09:17Z,"I'm back! It's been a crazy week! Good news.. FSUIPC is cracked, I just don't have it with me and I forgot to post it, next week you'll get it for sure!
Also, I cracked something today I think you're gonna love, this one I did for myself and decided to share it with you guys, it's Reality XP WX500 and GNS WAAS for FSX!
I need you to test them for me, so I can be sure they're properly cracked in order to publish them as a torrent.

,DCrack,2010-06-06T15:43Z,"@pd1995:
That's weird because the installer is the one giving you problems and it shouldn't, it's not even modified, it's the original Flight1 installer, let's wait to see if more people are having the same problem. Try installing as an administrator.

@dylan1980:
From the torrent.. I'm sorry bro, I can't solve specific installation problems as they are not in the scope of the crack. Many people have tested the concorde and it works, try solving things from your end (uninstall and reinstall as admin, try another computer, etc)."
,pd1995,2010-06-06T15:59Z,"Okay. It's weird indeed. I just click install and then it say's : creating directories

Is this happening with both installers?"
,DCrack,2010-06-06T16:10Z,"Ok, if you're getting error with the trainer, just download it from the GNS installer... I posted it in the release in case the Reality XP folks blocked their servers, give me a sec and I'll fix this. Install everything as told in the readme except for the trainer, but when installing the GNS also install the trainer (don't do it manually from the trainer folder)."

,patq911,2010-08-17T03:27Z,The Eaglesoft Cirrus SR-20 Crack does not work.  The MFD and the PFD are just blank grey screens.
,patq911,2010-08-19T23:07Z,"The file ""essr20avidynesX.gau"" is not recognized by FSX, so it doesn't load."
,Bartrash,2010-08-21T06:35Z,"DCrack thanks so much great work.

I am also having the blank PFD/MFD displays. Any Fix for this yet? 

thanks"
,dandan01,2010-08-22T09:55Z,"Very nice work credit to you man.  i just have a problem with concorde, it says i need to enter the serial (when not connected to interweb) but when i am connected ti works, but the flight controls are very slow to respond and i cant get the instruments to come alive.  Any advice?"
,Eggbeater,2010-08-31T00:08Z,"After installing and cracking the concorde x, FSX freezes. Anyone know's an solution?

Btw: Some have problems installing it, try to edit the .bat file and put the whole the location of the .exe and the .bin file in front of it. so edit ""FSLabs_ConcordeX_v1.0.exe"" to something like ""D:\DCrack's MegaPack for FSX\FlightSim Labs Concorde X FSX\FSLabs_ConcordeX_v1.0.exe"", or wherever the files are located. Worked for me."
,Wallboy19,2010-09-02T09:29Z,"I'm trying to get the Citation X 2.0 for FSX to work. Everything seems to work fine, but I'll be flying along and the plane will automatically just completely shutoff... engines, aivonics, etc all just completely turn off. Anyone else having this problem?"
,bajhoj,2010-10-21T09:09Z,"the concorde is infected, take care."
,chuckmamuck,2010-10-21T20:06Z,"bajhoj
its not infected, your bigtime commercial AV will detect an infection, as they do with all cracks and altered files. try scanning with malwarebytes or eset scanners and its clean.
weve been using it since may and its fine.
i use AVG 9.0 internet security and detects a virus in every cracked application i use, its called false positives. 
just add the files it states as infected to your AV's exceptions list.
scan cracked software with real AV products, the big commercial AV's are all supposed to state cracked software as infected to help put you off downloading pirated material so the rich get richer.
DCracks a good guy, he cracked this himself after we asked him if he would.
most cracks and keygens are stated to be infected by the likes of AVG, Norton, Kaspersky etc even tho the files are clean. scan it with malwarebytes and ESET online scanner, i trust those over any commercial AV."
,chuckmamuck,2010-10-22T08:47Z,"if you're getting errors when trying to install the concorde x by clicking the ""install using this"" file, you have to disable your user account control and restart your computer.
then click ""install using this"" and it will work."
,pappy.,2010-10-24T23:48Z,"Im also having the same problem as Wallboy

everything is cool untill i get to cruise and it will just randomly die.

any ideas?"
,minipilot22,2010-11-08T22:13Z,"hi DC you are the best 
do I have a chance to get you crack VRS superbug??? 

or someone else send me a link or something 

If you do ill create a ""DCrack"" T-Shirt and post a photo on my fb profile(well i hope i sound desperate enough to get it :P) 

ok now despite my as sliking comment you are the BEST"
,MajorWales,2010-11-20T23:40Z,"hi guys, im having a little problem with Concorde X. once installed, it says this:

Concorde-X - Validation error                       [X]

Error 1082:could not install/verify security validation engine. please contact Flight Sim Labs for support on this problem. Flight Simulator will now exit. 

                               [OK]

the crack is installed after installation (as the installer overwrites the cracked files) but i cannot resolve the problem. any ideas? these consist of emptying the registry for FSLabs data and uninstalling FSL Concorde X. these however, do not work. any ideas?"
,MajorWales,2011-03-29T21:01Z,"Could someone post a SP2 crack? it errors out as there is only one crack for the esellerate thing, which is gone :("
,brulner,2011-06-18T11:55Z,"Guys, the gauges in the Citation X 2.0 don't work because there's presumably a hash checker built into the installer. It says so in the manual.

DCrack, do you think you could ""fix"" this? Or is this impossible?"
,brulner,2011-06-18T12:17Z,"^ disregard my comment above, i was being a numpty and didn't even see the ""Crack"" folder :)"
,brulner,2011-06-18T13:15Z,"^ hmmm, crack didn't help much, still black displays. have also gone through the FMS INIT procedure, no change."
,brulner,2011-06-18T14:21Z,"here's a version with cracked esftchk2.dll file, but it's for FS2004/FS9. maybe this can be adapted to FSX?

Is there a fix to the Citation X esftchk5.dll problem?  The plane works great till it shuts down 30 minutes in.  Thanks.
