Danny Flynn is released from prison in Belfast after fourteen years for his part in IRA activities. He determines to avoid the bloodshed that was inherent in his political past and to build a new life in his old home. He starts a gym to train young boxers like himself, with no political or sectarian ties, and renews his relationship with the woman he left behind when imprisoned. But his relationship to the past refuses to let him live a life of peace.
