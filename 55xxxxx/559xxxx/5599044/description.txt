How to do a Power Hour
Grab some friends, some beer, this playlist, and a shot glass for each person playing. Fill your shot glass with beer and prepare to play. After each clip is played, finish your shot. After drinking, refill the shot glass as you watch the next clip. Repeat this process for the entire hour.

By the end, you should have drank between 5 to 7 beers depending how full you fill your shot glass.

I've included a codec pack (CCCP) that will allow you to playback the files if necessary. Also included are 4 standard playlist files that have the correct order for the clips/songs. Just load one of the playlists into your media player.

I put a lot of work into making this Power Hour. Many of the clips were hard to find. I hope you enjoy it!
