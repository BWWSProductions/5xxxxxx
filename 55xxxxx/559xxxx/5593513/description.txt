Plot:  A hit man turns against his former boss after witnessing a nuclear weapon being smuggled into the US.

side note about the movie:

During the first week of production the film s star (Shane Wood) hurt his
ankle while shooting a scene. After the scene Shane showed Director Brad
Jurjens an ankle that had swollen to twice its size. Knowing with the
tight budget a medical leave could scrap the project altogether, Shane
waited till after wrap, three weeks later (still doing all his own stunts)
to see a doctor and a MRI showed multiple fractures
