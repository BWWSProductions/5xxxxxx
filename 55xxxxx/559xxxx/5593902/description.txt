The Jacobian was a back-up story that ran through Detective Comics #746-757 (2000-2001).  It was written by Jordan B. Gorfinkel (Everything's Relative, Editor of Batman) and pencilled by Jeff Johnson (Wonder Man, Way of the Rat).

The Jacobian is about a private investigator with no memory of his past, but an uncanny knack of having incredible hunches when under pressure, who is hired by a mysterious woman to find her husband. However, she knows nothing of the man and cannot even prove that he exists, she just knows that she has a husband and that he is missing.
