Wikipedia - Nirvana is a compilation album from the American grunge band Nirvana, released in October 2002. Nirvana was the fourth Nirvana album to be released following the death of singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain in April 1994, and the first to feature studio material. It contains the previously unreleased "You Know You're Right", a song recorded during the band's final studio session from January 1994. The album also includes a selection of the band's more popular songs, pulled mostly from 1991's Nevermind and 1993's In Utero, but also containing three pre-Nevermind songs and two recorded during the band's MTV Unplugged set in late 1993. Nirvana opened at #3 on the Billboard 200. The album sold more than 6 million copies worldwide and by early 2009, it sold more than 2 million copies in the U.S. alone according to Soundscan.

Amazon.com Review By Kim Hughes - Essentially a greatest-hits collection with one previously unreleased song, "You Know You're Right," and producer Scott Litt's 1994 remix of "Pennyroyal Tea," Nirvana the album is nevertheless a welcome addition to the band's canon. Crisp, elegant liner notes by Rolling Stone writer David Fricke put us squarely in Kurt Cobain's mindset as he entered a Seattle studio in January 1994--a full two days later than expected--to record what would be his final session with Nirvana. The resulting "You Know You're Right" locates Cobain at the apogee of his disenfranchisement with tongue nevertheless planted firmly in cheek. Bawdy, raucous, and venomous, "You Know You're Right" could have been lifted from Nevermind. A mix of tracks from that album ("Smells Like Teen Spirit," "Come as You Are," "Lithium," and "In Bloom") sits opposite stuff from early EPs and the Bleach disc ("About a Girl," "Been a Son," and "Sliver"), plus two from the MTV Unplugged sessions and several more from In Utero. Not the Nirvana treasure chest we hoped for, but solid nonetheless.
