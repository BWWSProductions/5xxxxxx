,TKOG13,2010-05-27T01:55Z,is there a way to encode stuff like this using handbrake? (and by that I mean what would my settings have to be?)
,chrbrck,2010-05-27T03:57Z,you should consider getting Mystery Team
,souls2deny,2010-05-27T19:43Z,"@.M1K3Y., ""I'm on the other hand getting closer and closer to ur picture quality"" 

Not usually one to rain on someones parade but your encodes are NO WHERE NEAR the encodes of PT's and Holyroses. See the thing is why yours may look comparable on a tiny 3 inch ipod screen, Many of us don't view these on a handheld device. 

The difference between pretenders and contenders is how the quality is while viewing on a say a 60 inch TV via a PS3 or iphone hooked up to a tv via a/v cable. PT's and HR's appear flawless on a TV while I found your encodes to be grainy, pixulated, and second rate.

Keep trying though, Not a single person can criticize your hard work and effort but please don't compare your quality to the mighty PT and HR.

Thanks poppedtart for yet another great release. "

u goota be kidding me! "
,Toxic_Data,2010-05-27T20:44Z,"PT, Could you by any chance upload the movie Brothers with Tobey Maguire? I can't seem to find it for handheld anywhere on TPB. I would appreciate it, Thanks."
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-27T21:03Z,"Ya I dont quite understand watching these low def movies on a  60"" tv either.  I have a 60"" LCD projection (older 768p TV) and my chair is 13 feet from the TV.  The movies are watchable but they sure don't pop or anything.  If you have an older SD TV then they should be ""ok"".  But if you have an HD TV i strongly suggest you get the HD versions of the movies."
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-28T00:07Z,"@.M1K3Y. keep on doing what you are doing, I certainly don't mind.  I hope to inspire others to contribute quality materials.
