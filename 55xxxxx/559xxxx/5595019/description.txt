Electro-dancehall duo Major Lazer has partnered with English synthpop outfit La Roux for the creation of Lazerproof, a mixtape both acts will release for free on Wednesday (May 26) from Mad Decent.

On their self-titled debut, La Roux front-woman Elly Jackson channels her new wave and pop influences and projects them onto a backdrop of intricate electronic musings co-produced by Ben Langmaid. Major Lazer's brain-trust (Diplo and Switch), partner with them to bring the newest mixtape that was put together while on a recent trip to Jamaica.

Lazerproof plays on both groups' styles and the result is a project that is only vaguely recognizable as the sum of its parts -- ska, dubstep, hip-hop and pop stars aligning to create a synth-Britania meets dubstep dancehall gem.

The 14-track tape boasts guest appearances from Gucci Mane, Drake, Gyptian, Rusko and Amanda Blank add the infamous Mad Decent touch.
