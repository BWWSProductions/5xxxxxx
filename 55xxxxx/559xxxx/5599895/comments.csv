For season 4 of squidbillies, the first 1 to 10 are posted but since the 10th was posted, they have aired the 11th, 13th, 14th,  and 15th 4th season episodes but NO ONE is posting them. Yuo have to niche of having a HUGE amount of TV SHOWS, so I thought you would be the one to make a request. I'd post them myself, but I don't have a DVR or TIVO to catch them so I can put them in an upload-able format. I lack the ability or I would post them. PLEASE HELP. Thanks truly, dlarrym1"
