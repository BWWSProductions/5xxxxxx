I already have 200 uncensored, but 201 only aired in Canada uncensored.

Please, Please, PLEASE say yes!

: )"
,killerbunny2009,2010-05-26T05:47Z,It is from the Comedy Central ... as far as i know 201 It was only aired censored in North America
,afkuser,2010-05-27T14:25Z,"This is completely censored.
They bleep out Muhammad.
They cover up Muhammad with a black rectangle.

The file is also in mpg format and about 3x as large as it needs to be.

This torrent is worthless!"

,zenitram3,2010-09-19T19:41Z,There are no uncensored versions of episodes 200 and 201. You can thank Islam and Comedy Central for that.

,Army_Combat_Ninja,2010-09-20T06:02Z,"OK, I'n a noob to bit torrents, I found a program tp unzip rar files but what doI need to play them? cause my windows media player isn't doing it."
