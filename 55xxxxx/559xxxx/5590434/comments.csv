I seem to have forgotten...are there non-english speaking parts that require the subtitles?"
,Highlander009,2010-08-15T11:41Z,The VobSub subtitles included in this package don't work (with any player) because they're corrupted/badly ripped.  Just go to http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-eng/idmovie-55358 and get the SubRip (.srt) file for the Diamond Rip; it works just fine with this movie.
