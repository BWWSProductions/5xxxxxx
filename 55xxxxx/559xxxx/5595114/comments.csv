Ever thought of leaving the patches and instal the game without them?"
,Amaximus,2010-06-19T16:52Z,"@ El Noodle,

No dude, I know that. I always check with Virus Total and note that normally the false positives have a ""usual suspects"" list. However Avira is almost never a false positive with the good crackers - Avira knows normally when it's a game crack and when it's a real virus etc. This is the first time Avira gave me a positive since I Dled some video editing stuff that had a real virus. That's all. Well....one other time it happened and a Avira update took it off it's list about a week later. This has not happened yet with this program. That's why I posted. "

The executable provided in the crack is acess.exe instead of aces.exe.
