Hey guys,,this is one of my another uploads,,which I thought to share its in very good quality,,I hope you will enjoy it

Captured live in front of a sold-out London crowd, Ronnie James Dio delivers a truly memorable performance on this truly memorable night. Dio has been hailed as one of the finest voices in Heavy Metal for over 30 years now and for good reason. Due to his stints in Rainbow, Black Sabbath and as a solo artist, Dio is one of the few people in the history of music that can honestly say they have played on three classic albums, each under a different moniker. "Holy Diver Live" features the classic "Holy Diver" album in its entirety, from start to finish, recorded live for the very first time. It also features, among others, Heaven & Hell, Sign of the Southern Cross and Mob Rules from his Black Sabbath days, Tarot Woman, Man on the Silver Mountain and Long Live Rock â€˜Nâ€™ Roll from the Rainbow days and We Rock from his solo career.
