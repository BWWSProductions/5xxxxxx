Storyline In a small Texas enclave,
highlights the rites of passage on the last day of school in 1976 for
the new, incoming freshmen at the hands of the class of '77 at Robert
E. Lee High School. Freshman boys are physically punished, while the
girls largely face the brunt of verbal abuse and humiliation. Two main
figures emerge. Incoming freshman Mitch Kramer comes to a new
realization in his role as a major target of senior hazing. And, among
the seniors is Randall "Pink" Floyd, the school's star quarterback,
who moves with facile grace among groups of greasers, nerds, stoners,
and athletes alike
