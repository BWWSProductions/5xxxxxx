John Candy and Eugene Levy charge into the world of private security in
the outrageous action-comedy Armed and Dangerous. Unfortunately, they're
usually charging in the wrong direction. When Candy, a bungling cop, and
Levy, an inept lawyer, lose their jobs, they wind up together at the Guard
Dog Security Company. After thorough training in the use of firearms (for
two hours), they're raring to go. But even as security guards they can't
cut it, and rip offs take place right under their noses. Eventually they
figure out that the robberies aren't coincidental, and that their company
is in cahoots with the security union's mobster president (Robert Loggia,
The Jagged Edge). Eager to snag the crooks, Candy and Levy set out as
spies, and in a wild car chase turn a million dollar heist into an armed
carnival! When the dust finally settles, Candy and Levy save the day as
the hilarious rent-a-cop duo who are never more funny than when they're
Armed and Dangerous.
