  Artwork by visual artist Han Leese


 Note from the artist :

 "Mostly inspired by the melancholy breakcore of Kamikaze Deadboy the lofi 
 happy tender breaks in Glixxpistols "Dramalove" and the absolutely wacko 
 Dramacore.com website i was driven to produce a small album with complete 
 akw-art crazyness. Not caring about bpm, genre or build up i decided to 
 create a little story filled with liquid splatterings of fast paced emotions.

 In the form of naÃ¯ve screaming synths, deep crawling machinery that produce 
 sounds like if they are slowly busy decomposing and penetrating beats-bizarre 
 you are invited to singalong this sweet n sour piece of mu-sick designed 
 especially for the mind of the twisted but highly creative Dramacore label.
 When you are able to hear beyond you will find that far into the chaotic 
 bio-digital jungle lies a fairytale, one that tells the story of a waiting 
 heart, screaming for a more healthy life with daylight, sports & vegetables."
