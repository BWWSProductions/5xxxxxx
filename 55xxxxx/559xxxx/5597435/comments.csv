Yes Pluto in India we do have decent ISP's like BSNL, Airtel, Relience etc. Reliance provides speeds upto 16 Mbps. But the affordable range is usually low bw 128 Kbps to 2 Mbps. For example i use a BSNL connection of 256 Kbps bandwidth which gives a maximum download speed of around 30 Kbps. So your ripping files within 400 - 450 Mb comes really handy to us. Thanks man ! Can i ask which country are you from ?? .........:-)"
