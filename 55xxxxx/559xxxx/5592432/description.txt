Key Benefits

Securely access business applications on UNIX, Linux, or VMS from Windows PCs Ã¢ employ the rich emulation support for VT100/102/220, ANSI, SCO ANSI, Wyse 50/60, Xterm, and Linux console.

Configure, manage, and customize 1 to 5,000 sessions with full control over scrollback, key mappings, colors, fonts, and more.

Access your full array of network devices from one client with SSH2, SSH1, Telnet, Telnet/SSL, Serial, and other protocols.

Leverage the high-productivity UI with time-saving capabilities including multi-session launch, tabbed sessions, cloned sessions, a button bar for repeated commands, and mapped keys.

Depend on the open standard Secure Shell protocol for encrypted logon and session data, flexible authentication options, and optional FIPS 140-2 -approved ciphers.

Automate repetitive tasks in SecureCRT by running scripts using VBScript, JScript, or PerlScript. The Script Recorder builds your keystrokes into a VBScript.

Transfer files between network devices with SFTP or Xmodem, Ymodem, and Zmodem protocols.

Save steps with the close integration of SecureCRT and the SecureFXÃ‚Â® file transfer client, which share sessions and settings that let you run SFTP, FTP, SCP, and FTP/SSL file transfer sessions without reentering passwords.
