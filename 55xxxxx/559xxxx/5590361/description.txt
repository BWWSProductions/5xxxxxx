This torrent contains all episodes in seasons 1 - 3 of "The Big Bang Theory."

=====From WIKIPEDIA=====
The Big Bang Theory is an American situation comedy created and executive produced by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, which premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007.[2]

It concerns two male Caltech prodigies in their twenties, one an experimental physicist (Leonard) and the other a theoretical physicist (Sheldon), who live across the hall from an attractive blonde waitress with show-biz aspirations (Penny).

Leonard and Sheldon's geekiness and intellect are contrasted with Penny's social skills and common sense for comedic effect. Two equally geeky friends of theirs, Howard and Rajesh, are also main characters. The show is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions.[3][4] The Big Bang Theory was recently picked up for a third and fourth season by CBS.[5] The Big Bang Theory will change timeslots for its third season and will now air at 9:30 EST following fellow-Chuck Lorre-produced Two and a Half Men.
