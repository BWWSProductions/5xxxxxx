,austin19,2010-06-15T07:53Z,"Hey boomkin, thanks for the great upload.  FYI, we can't download any guide data without your email address that you put in when you signed up with this serial.  If anyone submits a ticket to Elgato, the serial will probably become inactive.  I swear I won't spam you or anything if you want to tell me your email address at my old email (austin-r_o_x@hotmail.com).

Found that out here: http://forums.elgato.com/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=7649"
