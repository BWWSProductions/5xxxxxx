CARP & CATFISH ADVENTURES EUROPE DVD - REVIEWS & FEEDBACK:

"...What seperates this from other DVDs are the amazing underwater scenes which show Tony and a pal swimming with huge carp - it's awe inspiring stuff seeing carp of 50lb, 60lb and even 70lb swimming with humans! ... Tremendous footage as we follow a group of anglers who battle with catfish to over 150lb. The power of these fish makes you ache just watching!" - CARP-TALK magazine

"...I am speechless, those DVDs are fantastic...!" Florin, USA.

"...Incredible, to say the least! First class Tony, well done...!" Gezza Floyd, UK.

"...You have once again provided a remarkable peice of work and for me the underwater material was first class. The quality of this set is superb and the filming second to none. I look forward to the next chapter..." Gerry Richards, UK.
