............. ARTERY
French metal band created in April 2005.
Line up : THIERRY (guitar), FRED (guitar), SIMON (drums, since May 2008) , and MANU (bass and voice).

Influenced by traditional heavy metal and thrash metal bands, with a little bit of death metal influences too.

With hammers instead of picks, ARTERY keeps the die-hard metal flame up. With its heavy and powerful riffs, its tenacious melodies, ARTERY is a real indestructible and infernal engine, generated by four arteries who can only make the heads shaking.
