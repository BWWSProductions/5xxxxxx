IMAGiNE NOTES
First off many thanks to ELEKTRI4KA for the video source and PrisM for the synced line audio... Thanks both :)
We took the new russian cam and added prism's audio to this release. First off this was a very dark source, so the contrast is a little higher than we would normally like it to be.
Otherwise this is a nice TS. We changed the colors a bit as well as the contrast, along with adding a few other filters to touch it up a bit. Also had to change the AR from 2.5 to 2.35...

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
