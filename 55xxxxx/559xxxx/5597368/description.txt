Eight years on from the gentle and acoustic Missing You, Baaba Maal has at last recorded a new studio album, packed with messages aimed at Africa and new musical styles aimed at the western market. Dominated by the vocals and keyboards of Sabina Sciubba and Didi Gutman of New York electro-dance exponents Brazilian Girls, and the guitar work of former Compass Point star Barry Reynolds, it's a brave, unexpected set that veers between the brilliant and the occasionally dreadful. When the mixture works, it works very well indeed - as on the title track, which is based around a brilliantly infectious hook and builds like a classic pop song. When it doesn't work, as with the embarrassing Cantaloupe, it sounds as if one of Africa's great voices is being swamped by technology and an over-simple western melody. Between those extremes, the album veers between the gently driving A Song for Women, the mildly annoying International (in which Sciubba intones a list of cities), the breezy and tuneful English-language pop tune Dakar Moon, and the gently exquisite Tindo Quando, which serves as a reminder of Maal's own sturdy guitar work. It's worth checking out - but be warned.
