Amazon.com - Ashley Tisdale, the singer and actress known to millions as the star of the blockbuster High School Musical series, releases her album Guilty Pleasure, an authentic reflection of a girl growing up and speaking her mind on songs like the first single â€œItâ€™s Alright, Itâ€™s OKâ€ â€” a break-up anthem about being single and in control of your life for the first time. Working with a host of top-flight producers and songwriters, such as Kara DioGuardi (Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood), Toby Gad (BeyoncÃ©, Fergie), Billy Steinberg (Madonna), Emanuel Kiriakou (David Archuleta, Nick Lachey), and Swedish production team Twin (who co-wrote the headstrong singles â€œNot Like Thatâ€ and â€œBe Good To Meâ€), Tisdale co-wrote several tracks on Guilty Pleasure, including the feisty â€œActing Outâ€. She also co-wrote the propulsive â€œOverrated,â€ about not changing your personality for a guy, and two ballads â€œWhat Ifâ€ and â€œMe Without You.â€ Another album highlight is the slinky, confident â€œMasquerade,â€ perhaps the most sophisticated song Tisdale has recorded to date.
