This is just a custom RIP of the CS B52 BUFF with a merged C-5 galaxy VC cockpit as the Captain Sim VC is still in the works.

Also included:

*custom paint from Mcphat and some others
*custom VC and panel (C-5 Galaxy from Area51) not the best VC but meh....
*awesome freeware JT8D sound package.
*corrected engine smoke trail 
*custom 3D light effects
 
A2A Swlights utility v1.2 installer included for those who dont have it yet, extract and run the exe otherwise your 3D lights wont work.

just drop the files in ur main FSX folder and you should be ready to go, this my own RIP so i hope it works, please let me know
