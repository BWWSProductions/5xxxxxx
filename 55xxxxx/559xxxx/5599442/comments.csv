,lyko,2010-05-30T18:01Z,"Hi!

Pleese seed!!!!"
,aarque,2010-05-30T20:40Z,"sunburst, no offense, but how do you add a VC when it is not defined in the .mdl file? I have seen a few airplanes with a separate mdl for the VC (default 747 is one I believe), but that would bring about other issues, no? 

hitchup: can you provide any details? The dark areas look like bounding boxes, perhaps for lights or lighted areas, is that a possibility?"
,sunburst31,2010-05-30T21:40Z,"aarque, the VC is defined in the model.cfg but its only possible when its a FSX native model cuz FS9 has interior and exterior in one MDL file, hope that explains it.

Hitchup, it looks like ur missing some rotor downwash effect from ur effects folder otherwise its corrupted, try running the FSX repair disk and see if it will replace the missing file...i had that once happend with smoke and got all square boxes "
,hitchup,2010-05-30T21:43Z,aarque.....the dark boxes show with dust landing effect [together].
,porch_monkey,2010-05-30T23:47Z,omfg frame-rate killer!!!
,aarque,2010-05-31T03:34Z,"yes hitchup, it sounds like sunburst got it right. I wouldn't run repair, however. Search your aircraft.cfg for the named effect, then check your effects folder. You can probably substitute a dust or smoke effect from there. I myself have 13 effects with ""dust"" in the title, the Ka-50 one would probably work perfectly. I'll upload it or email if you want."
,hitchup,2010-05-31T07:52Z,"Thanks guys for help.....

aarque my mail : slavi_70@yahoo.com"
,hitchup,2010-05-31T22:41Z,"aarque...thanks for the effects..

I fix effect,main FSX special effects smoke afterburner was corrupt. I found this:http://www.rikoooo.com/en/flight-simulator-x/divers/gauges-recovery-pour-fsx-v1-2.html"
,aarque,2010-06-01T05:37Z,"all good hitchup, glad to be able to help and glad you got it."
,aarque,2010-06-01T08:45Z,"sunburst, you know the Alphasim B-52 has a functional VC which I have, wouldn't that make a better merge than the Area51 Galaxy?"
,udidwht,2010-06-01T10:38Z,Seed please.
,sunburst31,2010-06-01T20:58Z,"aarque: yes that would be a better merge, but is the the Alpha B52 a native FSX model otherwise it wont work? pls check that there are two seperate mdl files in the model folder one for exterior en the VC..."
,aarque,2010-06-02T08:16Z,"ok sunburst, the Alpha B52 is FS9 and only one .mdl; so that means we're screwed, right?"
,mst63,2010-06-05T20:08Z,i'm looking for the Cessna O-1/L-19 Bird Dog by Sibwings 
,olicornio,2010-10-04T19:51Z,"New at simMarket, Patrouille Suisse Extension has new missions for owners of Patrouille Suisse X from FlyLogic.
