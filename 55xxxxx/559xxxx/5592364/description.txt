These are all the tracks I could find on the wayback machine from Sonic Mayhem's official site. They're all low quality (128kbs mp3), but good luck finding better ones. Not sure which of these are unreleased and which are available, so I included every one I found. The composer apparently doesn't want to release them, but I happen to want to listen to them, so yeah.

Tracks:

Action Radius
Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned
Arms Bazaar
A.E.X
Antilogic
Audio Adrenaline
Confrontation
Disclosure
Evil Approaching
Freqency
Interference
Invisible Enemy
Operation Skynet

Quad Machine
Redemption March
Speed Junkie
Synthetic Machine

T3:War of the Machines Remix
The Waste Land

Whatever else I happened to miss.

I'll be seeding whenever I'm not playing video games online.
