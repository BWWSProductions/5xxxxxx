,w!dde,2010-05-30T21:04Z,why so big filesize? will there be a smaller release or should i download this one elsewhere?
,bi0sh0ck,2010-05-30T22:08Z,Grt upload
,ajkalla,2010-05-31T00:21Z,"Because if you read properly in the description part of the movie it says BLUE RAY DISC, it comes under high quality print which occupies greater space.
you can try downloading a DVD version,which will occupy less space."
,powderedwater67,2010-05-31T03:00Z,"I'm sure this is a great rip being FXG, but why the dramatic change in source material and video container?"
,upendiTPB,2010-05-31T03:40Z,"I know it would be of great quality but i stay in a region where download speed is slow...30kB/s (average), it would take 3 days to finish download:(

BDrips are the next big thing and the shift was expected but still could you upload DVDrips(700mb) alongside BDrips as long as they are available...
Thanks"
,ajith19,2010-05-31T04:29Z,"i think its better we should go for this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5572012/The_Book_Of_Eli_(2010)_720p_-_1280_536_-__500MB   its BRRip and less size,only 500mb.."
,feartruth,2010-05-31T08:46Z,"I hope FXG is not shifting to uploading only BDRIPs (like ZEKTORM did). I was waiting so eagerly for FXG's release of this movie, but now when it's done......................... x-("
,cleborb,2010-05-31T09:22Z,"Nice job messing up the aspect ratio. The AR should be around 2.35:1 (check other rips) and not 1.90:1, that's a pretty big fuck up LOL"
,echoey,2010-05-31T10:21Z,"After aXXo stopped uploading, something seems to be amiss amongst the good old trusted uploaders. Sporadic uploads(FxM), Big file sizes(ZEKTORM) :("
,feartruth,2010-05-31T15:54Z,I'm gonna go for MXMG's DVDRIP if it gets enough seeders.
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-31T16:10Z,a lot of people don't seem to care about bad AR or stretched/morphed people.  Thats just the sad truth of it.
,pogogogo,2010-05-31T16:25Z,"what d fuck is wrong with d people.

@ feartruth

u begged fxg for this movie with so many pleases.
n now when he has uploaded it in just 5 days of ur request, ur not happy? so what its a bdrip? good for u, it'll clearer.

@ the rest of the guys.

the fxg rips r really good as compared to other shit floating around at tpb. 

if u keep crying about the fxg rips being not upto ur standard, then probably u can upload a better rip, if u cant, stop complaining.

who knows someday fxg gets pissed off reading ur stupid comments n decides 2 take a break.

n this is not for the comments for just this rip, but all rips of fxg in general. 

Thanx fxg for all ur rips.

stick around.

,free2flie,2010-06-01T02:18Z,"boo hoo
too big a filesize
please upload a dvdrip FXG!!!
LOL hahaha"
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-01T06:18Z,"Whats the point of keeping this video going FXG?  You know its flawed.  Delete it and proper is the sensible thing to do.  I have been looking at a lot of your videos and it seems your AR's are all willy nilly, like you make them up on the spot.  Seems like you don't know how to calculate them from source material and just guess at it.  There are very simple formula to calculate AR's from source.
"
[V],FXG_team,2010-06-01T09:43Z,"@poppedtart ,
Sorry man , you are propably right ,
all my AR's are from 1,8 to 2,5 max ,
But i think they are really watchable !
If you dont like them , your opinion is respected from me."
,feartruth,2010-06-01T14:29Z,"@pogogogo: mate, it's just that my system can't play BRRIPs. Or else, many BRRIPs from trusted uploaders were already out there. I'm a fan of FXG & I can only hope that it's not a permanent change. But I can't help it if they do, they must surely have their own reasons. I'd surely appreciate it if they provide us the reason behind this change, not that they owe me one."
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-01T18:15Z,"fxg, i can give you a spreadsheet that can help you determine AR's if it would be of interest to you.  My interest is improving peoples works is all.

@everyone else, if you can't play this then buy a new player, like a popcorn hour player."
,feartruth,2010-06-02T05:50Z,"@pogogogo: and ya, I was requesting (or begging, as you'd prefer to put it) for this from FXG for quite long, but little did I know about FXG's plans of drastic changes. If you'd read all my requests, you'd have noticed it long before why I'm not so happy. Quoting my comment from FXG's release of ""The Wolfman"" (at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5575071/The_Wolfman%5B2010%5D%5BUnrated_Edition%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D-FXG):

""@Minty_Winty: I know, but unfortunately BRRIPs don't work on my system :'(
There are also some DVDRIPs out but because of my bandwidth limit, I've to wait for reasonable size uploads.""

Hope I've made myself clear enough. Amen."
,arjun_519,2010-06-03T13:24Z,"i can't believe i am still fucking downloading it 8 hrs and 70%...
it takes 2 1/2 for a 2 gig file for me...
this torrent doesn't have speed still after 3 days!!!"

,maqsmihil,2010-06-05T05:56Z,"Hey! FXG I have seen something different about audio of your bdrips.

 Sound is not balanced or its not in good what do you say contrast the subtle changes in music we can't hear. I watched hurt locker as well may be you should change the audio rip of your bdrips.
I'm compairing your ones to secretmyth's ones. Good job though the aspect ratio problem I have seen in couple of FXG films.It's not a problem use gomplayer and set aR to 2.35:1 "
,Phazzed,2010-06-13T20:38Z,Great download. Great resolution. Great file container. Thank you FXG.
,VORONGM,2011-01-02T12:25Z,"MKV is the best file format, thanks!"
,VORONGM,2011-01-02T12:30Z,Thanks for the MKV
