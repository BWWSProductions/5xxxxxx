This is the first poker-based show that features cash games instead of tournaments. In High Stakes Poker we get to see the very elite in the poker world and some rich amateurs battle it out at the exclusive casinos in Las Vegas. No final table at the World Series or at the World Poker Tourâ€¦ More features this many professionals at the same time. The players can buy in for any amount ranging from $100 000 to $1 000 000 and can then reload if they would lose all of their money.
