        Mind of a serial killer

        Inspired by a true story, a small independent news crew,  made
        up of reporter  Maria and her  camera man Tom,  investigates a
        series  of unexplained  disappearances in  a small  Midwestern
        county. The story  leads them to  the isolated town  of Arkham
        Heights, where they  find themselves interviewing  Emmett, who
        possesses an all too intimate knowledge of the details of "The
        County Line Cannibal" - Cyrus.

        As Emmett inter-weaves the macabre life tale of Cyrus with the
        story of his last three victims, Maria comes closer and closer
        to the  greatest story  of her  life -  or what's  left of it.
        Filled with reenacted  documentary footage of  actual forensic
        experts,  serial  killers  and  police  authorities,   "Cyrus"
        presents a simultaneously  beautiful and horrific  examination
        of the destructive nature of  cause and effect leading to  the
        creation of the most prolific serial killer in the history  of
        the United States.
