**Note - I had to archive the App directories and Language Packs in order to make the .torrent file an acceptable size for certain torrent sites.  The files should expand out to the appropriately named directories, but if there is any confusion, see directory structure.jpg.  Please do not delete the archives, as you will need them to seed the torrent.
