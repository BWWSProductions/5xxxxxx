Thanks you once again, jwhitt! :)

Quick question - anyone else find Mark Steyn a bit too much of a giggle puss? Even with the most serious items of the day he just guffaws his way through the program. I find it irritating and distracting.

Last year Rush had some guy filling in for him on July 4th, and the guy was just plain boring: kept carping about how he wasn't going to celebrate July 4th, and repeating that ad nauseaum. I quit listing after the first hour.

Anyone else remember that program?

So I made up my mind not to bother with fill-in hosts."

As far as I know, he's the only truly funny political commentator on the right.  The left has them a dime a dozen.  Daily Show, etc.  

Dennis Miller has his moments, but Mark Steyn is hours of hilarity each program.  But the great thing about him is, his humor is based on SUBSTANCE, unlike the left."
,thunderbum,2010-05-27T21:57Z,"Weel, maybe I'll give Steyn another listen or two. I think that part of the problem is that Limbaugh is more serious and enjoys picking the left apart (and doing it deftly!), whereas Steyn just treats everything like an audition at Yuk Yuks. I guess I should treat Steyn's observations more like Miller! (love watching him on Oreilly, just wish he wouldn't interrupt his guests so much!)

I appreciate your input, darkencypher! :)"
