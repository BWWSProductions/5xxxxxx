,xiIix,2010-05-28T05:09Z,"This isn't really comparable to Split Second or Blur, but I would have to say that both SS and Blur are both soul-less games that won't last long. Alpha Protocol is basically Mass Effect set in a different universe. Based on entertainment merit and playability over long periods I'd say Alpha Proto blows away both of those arcade racers, unless you have the attention of a fruit fly, then maybe you'd want to choose the racers to spend your time with. Have to admit, Blur is a nice new take on battle racing, and is fun, but I can't see myself playing it for hours."

Run regedit.exe. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE and find the SEGA Corporation folder and Obsidian folder and delete them. If your on a x64 system these folders will be found in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node. Also, delete the SEGA Corporation folder found in C:\ProgramData. Enjoy!"

,StefanGavrila,2010-05-28T18:04Z,"After playing the game for several hours I can clearly say that this game is not worth all the hipe that it has gotten over the time. It is an above average game at best.

Even though it uses the Unreal Engine 3, it does not show it. Graphics and level design are above average, some character models (especially the common soldiers) and movement look like they have been taken from 8-10 year old game.

In the 5 levels that I played, character interaction was minimal (mostly during mission briefings) and nothing like Mass Effect as some people expected it to be.

Gameplay wise it has many problems (in my point of view at least): weapons that can only hit a target at point blank range (like the Uzi), narrow field of view, the ability to save on;y at checkpoints, very poor AI, lack of an indicator to show you how stealthy you are, nausea inducing motion blur and many more.

Hopefully the game get's better later on, but so far i'm very disappointed with how it looks and plays.

6/10 (and I think i'm being generous)"

,AZkiller7,2010-05-28T18:37Z,"How to change language in Alpha Protocol

If your version of Alpha protocol runs in any other language than English (and if you want the game to switch to English), try the fix below.
Go to X:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Alpha Protocol\APGame\Config\APEngine (where X: is your system drive, usually C:) and open the APEngine.ini file with a text editor. 
Scroll to the [Engine.Engine] section and set Language=EN. Save and close the file. 
Go to X:\Program Files\SEGA Corporation\Alpha Protocol\Engine\Config\BaseEngine and Open BaseEngine.ini file with a text editor. 
Scroll to the [Engine.Engine] section and set Language=EN. Save and close the file. Now start the game. 

If you want to change the language to any other language than English, you may try a different language string. For example to switch it to Russian set Language=RUS. For this to work your copy of the game must be a MULTILANGUAGE version.

How to Fix Crashes, weird menu sounds, game exiting to main menu after the first cutscene, etc

We?ve received several E-mails from our readers who all seem to have run into a very weird issue. Whenever a menu item is selected/hovered on, the game would emit a strange moaning sound :D Apart from that it would crash to desktop or go back to the main menu after the first cut scene. From what I have found so far, this happens when you try different versions of the game in your machine. For example if you installed a leaked copy of the game earlier and then tried installing the legit version (or a different exe) later, these problems may materialize. To try and resolve these issues, follow the instructions below.

Note: Be careful when making changes to the system registry. Deleting/modifying wrong values may cripple your system.
Open the Windows Registry Editor ? this is usually done by typing RegEdit.exe in the run/search box and pressing enter. 
Expand the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and then expand SOFTWARE 
Right click the ?SEGA Corporation? Key (under SOFTWARE) and hit delete. Press yes to the confirmation message. Close the Registry Editor. 
Navigate to X:\ProgramData directory, where X is your system drive (usually C:\). Delete the SEGA Corporation folder located inside it. Now run the game. 

If the above does not work, try uninstalling the game, repeating steps 1-4 and then reinstalling a fresh copy.

How to improve mouse controls and mouse movement in Alpha Protocol

If you are annoyed by the way your mouse behaves in Alpha Protocol (sudden mouse speed variations when FPS drops), you can try the following fix to improve mouse handling. Full credit for this fix goes to user MirkoOdora on NFoHump Forums.
Go to X:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Alpha Protocol\APGame\Config & open DefaultInput.ini file with a text editor. Set  bEnableMouseSmoothing=False in this file, save and close it. 
Go to X:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Alpha Protocol\APGame\Config & open APInput.ini file. Set all occurrences of bEnableMouseSmoothing variable in this file (there should be 2) to bEnableMouseSmoothing=False 
Go to X:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Alpha Protocol\APGame\Config & open APEngine.ini file. Set the following values in appropriate sections 
[Engine.GameEngine] 
bSmoothFrameRate=FALSE 
MinSmoothedFrameRate=1024 
MaxSmoothedFrameRate=4096 
[SystemSettings] 
UseVsync=False 
Open X:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Alpha Protocol\APGame\Config and make all ini files in this folder read only (note ? after making these files read only, your changes from the in game menu options may not get saved. If you need to change any settings from the in game menu, it?s suggest that you do it before this step)"

I don't normally tell people what they should or should not be playing but this game is horribly unpolished. If you want to deal with crap controls and consoley menus with the bare minimum of work done to make it even remotely functional on a PC (think Borderlands menus without the good shooting and combat engine), then have at it. Short of a miracle patch this thing isn't worth bothering with.

looks to me that u know as much for computers as my grandmother. What u think ? that ppl make cracks for u to play because u have a nice ass or something? If u think ur computer is not infected i totaly lol u, and no i dont want to nuy the game but also i dont fool myself that something is safe, i dont use any superloaded money credit cards from this pc or doing anything else valuable, worst case ill lose some savegames so i play with cracks and download games. 
AND THIS IS A VIRUS. EVEN ESET CATCH IT NOT IN A CUSTOM SCAN, BUT AFTER CHECKING FOUNDING IT CLEAN, AFTER ME COMPLETING THE GAME, AFTER 10 DAYS AFTER THAT WITH TOTAL INACTIVITY OF ALPHA PROTOCOL (I DIDNT RUN IT ALL THOSE DAYS) SUDENLY A POPUP FROM ESET NOD32 THAT ALPHA PROTOCOL SKIDROW.DLL TRIED TO ACCESS A WINDOWS\WIN32 FILE (TROYAN/BACKDOOR).

why u ignorant kid TACOSTEVE skidrow.dll after 10 days of alpha protocol inactivity remembered that it has to access a win32 folder file?

Movie Makers today are better at making good flicks than before, back in the shit VHS scam ur money era 3 out of 10 movies was worth watching/renting or going to the cinemas.

Today it's a different story, 8 out of 10 movies are worth my time, You know what I mean, Your choice and Its not so easy to scam ppl anymore with über reviews and pictures on the back of that fkin rent movie.

Anyway, the 2 latest games I've tried out was total fkin garbage, 1st was metro2033.. Could hardly get it going, fucking game kept crashing every 5 min, but i struggled through all that shit til the end. POS game. And now this, Alpha Protocol, what a joke, done everything I know, and what others know on forums /google ftl, but still no luck.

As soon as I hit apgame.exe it says ""runtime error"" bli bla bli bla.. pos.

- Check online for a solution and close the program
- Close the program.


after that the ""SEGA Corporation"" folder is automatically created inside the ""C:\ProgramData"".

There's no difference when I delete or keep the ""Sega Corporation"" folder.

,Celetis,2010-07-18T23:55Z,"I can install it and transfer the crack just fine, and it'll run immediately after I install it, the first time. But when I try to play it again later, it won't even open, as soon as I try to it just crashes and I get the message that it failed and windows had to close the program. Any ideas? I've tried reinstalling, but that just lets me play once more and when I try to reopen it afterwards I still can't."

I deleted SEGA folder in ProgramData.
Also cleared my reg. Run regedit. find Sega Folder and delete. Then apply the SKIDROW crack.

Now its running fine on Vista."

,Dirk4three,2010-09-28T15:05Z,Every time I try to run a game from SKIDROW the instalation runs fine...then I try the crack and it always turns to be a virus... on this case it was a trojan horse ... I dunno if it is from SKID or my Pc...if it is me ... just tell what I have to do to finally run a game ...
,salty88,2010-10-08T10:53Z,"FIX FOR MOUSE LAG-
even trying every fix i could find, the mouse always was buged! My solution is to give the APGame.exe (in your command console) a higher priority! Check it out and comment!

,Zaherir,2010-10-13T23:46Z,"@Dirk4three

i've heard a lot about people having this problem, not only with SKIDROWs cracks. Mostly this is not a problem with the crack, but the anti-virus program that you are using... personally i use AVG 9.0 free, and i've never had a problem with cracks.

- Zaherir = Damage -"
,Zaherir,2010-10-13T23:47Z,"and the bright side is that AVG is free, if you download the free verson ofc :P"
,Zaherir,2010-10-14T06:44Z,"@Dirk4three

ok... nvm what i said about not having problem :(
now that ive dl'd it and installed it, i also have  a virus problem with the SKIRDOW.dll file :("

,Patecatli,2010-12-23T06:05Z,"I installed it and copied over the crack, AVG said the skidrow.dll file was a virus so i looked back here to see if theres any fixes. A lot of the comments are saying to delete the SEGA corporation folder in ProgramData so i looked in there and noticed a random photo of the Niagara falls o.O anyone explain that? lol"
,doiselldrugs07,2010-12-25T04:19Z,anyone know how to get around the crack being detected as a virus? I have tried taking it out of the quarantine but it just redetects it right away. This has happened to a few other cracks for me so I really need to find out how to get around this. Thanks
,kaliver,2010-12-29T06:52Z,do yoruself a favor: go slam your testicles in a car door instead of downloading this game.
,Camizzle,2011-01-04T07:55Z,The game isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. It's just one of those games you have to play longer then 15min. It isn't as good as mass effect BUT it's woth playing. I totally enjoyed it... am still enjoying it.
,Farseli,2011-01-17T08:55Z,"The reason anti-virus programs label cracks as viruses is because they are using something called heuristics. Basically, it looks kinda like a virus, enough that while it isn't on any of the virus lists, it is going to get rid of it just to be safe. Chances are, you can stop your anti-virus from removing the files by finding the option to turn off heuristics."
,tommo020,2011-01-18T08:26Z,"WTF!?...
So first, I download the game, which takes over a week.
Then I installed it, ""looks promising!"",
Then I go to the Skidrow folder on the CD, and immediately, it picks up SKIDROW.EXE and SKIDROW.DLL as a virus.
Why are these two files even on the CD, when they are not part of the crack??
And why did your SKIDROW.exe try to automatically launch and access its dll??

Then when I tried to play a new game.
I only get as far as the intro video, then it exits back to the main menu after the intro movie plays... This is F#cking retarded...

DONT DOWNLOAD THIS!"
,tommo020,2011-01-18T08:41Z,Anyone got a working crack for patch 1.1?

,MN121MN,2011-08-10T11:54Z,"@everyone who posts here : Clearly you have little knowledge of Asian gaming scene. It's different from Europe or America, so try researching some more into Asian games before you bitch about the game. 

As for graphics, this IS the average graphics in Asia. Games such as Splinter Cell, Assassin's Creed, they have more amazing graphics because the publisher focused solely on EU or NA demands, not Asian, while SEGA is trying to appeal worldwide.

Game is pretty fun, though stealth is almost impossible, you always get caught which is uber lame. Can't stand lag and may just try and get off ebay for $10? Though I doubt games worth it?

As regards to virus, stop complaining: a) its not a virus b) you ran that risk by downloading free stuff off the internet c) if you restart the computer and it no longer works your anti-virus probably vaulted the files, duh..."
