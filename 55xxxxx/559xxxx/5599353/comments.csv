,Blastcat2,2010-06-15T03:56Z,"Thanks a lot, gay guy, spoilers are really not appreciated. The comments are for the quality of the torrent, as to the content, leave it alone.

I'm trying to think of a different name to call you than stupid, but that will do.

Calling people with the balls to go into an octagon ""cunts"" makes you incredibly insignificant and again, stupid.

Please dont comment again. Your comments are not welcomed. "
