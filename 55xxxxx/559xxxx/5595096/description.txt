                               ===================





Three-quarters of Earth is an alien world, lying beneath the surface of the oceans. And although it encompasses over half of the worldâ€™s species, we know more about the surface of Mars than the bottom of the ocean. Itâ€™s only recently that science has penetrated this world, revealing extraordinary life forms and vast sweeping landscapes on a scale that defies imagination.


If we could remove the water, what would we see? Using CGI animation, based on the latest scientific research, Drain the Ocean explores one of Earthâ€™s last great frontiers as never beforeâ€”revealing unimaginable landscapes more dramatic than anything on dry land.
