"Rockstar 101" featuring Slash is scheduled to be the fourth U.S. single from the album Rated R. The song was performed on American Idol on April 7, 2010. It will officially impact both Mainstream and Rhythmic radio on June 1, 2010. The song will be used for the new CW show Nikita. The show will debut in the fall of 2010.

Rated R is the fourth studio album by Barbadian R&B singer Rihanna, released November 20, 2009 on Def Jam Recordings. Recording sessions for the album took place during March to November 2009 at several recording studios, and production was handled primarily by Chase & Status, StarGate, The-Dream, Ne-Yo, and Brian Kennedy. Conceived after Rihanna's assault by her then-boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, Rated R features a prominently foreboding and angry tone, in terms of musical and lyrical direction, and incorporates elements of hip hop, rock, and dubstep.

The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 181,000 copies in its first week, making it Rihanna's highest-selling debut in the United States. It became her third consecutive platinum album in the US and produced four singles that achieved chart success, including Billboard hit "Hard" and international hits "Russian Roulette" and "Rude Boy". Upon its release, Rated R received generally positive reviews from most music critics. As of February 2010[update], the album has shipped over two million copies worldwide.

Dream and Tricky flew out to Paris and played a few songs for Rihanna which included the songs "Hard" and "Rockstar 101." The song "Hard" stood out from all the songs because she felt that it had such an arrogance to it. In the song "Rockstar 101," British and American guitarist, Slash, contributed a bass guitar on the track while "Photographs" is a duet with will.i.am.
