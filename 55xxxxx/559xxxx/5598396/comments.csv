I teach at a tiny school with horribly limited resources, and the students have shown great interest in the writings of Arthur Conan Doyleâ€™s Sherlock Holmes. It has been an inestimable treat for them to watch many of these faithful recreations of the classic stories. By making these available, I can attest that you have brought joy (and perhaps some actual love of literature) to some deprived young minds. You are to be commended. Thank you!"
