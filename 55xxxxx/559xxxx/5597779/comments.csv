,Pikey2Mikey,2010-06-09T01:41Z,"Hi can you help me I downloaded the free trial first for original.. and then uninstalled it before i installed this one but it still only gives me a 1 minute trial whats goin on?

thanks!"
,Pikey2Mikey,2010-06-10T01:41Z,Hi any reply for me thanks!
,supz,2010-06-11T15:08Z,When I finish a game and it tells me my score (offline) there doesn't appear to be any way to get back to the title menu other than close the game and reload.  This happening for anybody else?
,supz,2010-06-11T17:37Z,"@pikey2mikey, this is Bejeweled Blitz.  You only have 60 seconds per game."
,figureouturself,2010-07-04T00:45Z,"As supz said, after a game, it displays my score, and gives me the option to buy boosts, and that's it. There's no way to go back to the title menu or start a new game without restarting the program..."
,P3X-252,2010-07-06T03:26Z,"I would not even bother with this one, I mean like people say you complete the 60 second level it says your score and there is no way back to play again, so i close it and reopen and then my score and coins have gone again so there is no point because you cant compete with your own high scores or save up coins for boosts. "
,P3X-252,2010-07-06T04:13Z,This is the un cracked version this is why we are having problems i have downloaded aother one and it has the crack and it works great!
