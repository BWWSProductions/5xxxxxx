,hyster13,2010-10-07T03:26Z,@sofiajabbar - You have to extract them with WinRAR.

[T],Coolguy33,2011-03-03T21:19Z,"thelad53 has a purple skull which means he is a trusted uploader, so believe me that this is the movie. 

For anyone that don't know how to open / watch it, you must first use WinRaR. You can get it here:

http://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-32-bit/3000-2250_4-10007677.html.  Run the program and folow instructions. 

Once it has installed, go into the movie folder where all those files are located, right click on any the files that look like a book and then click on where it says (Extract Here). It will start to extract the movie into the same folder and you will then see a yellow folder at the top where the movie is located.

Hope this helps"
