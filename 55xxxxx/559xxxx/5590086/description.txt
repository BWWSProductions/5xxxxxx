Wikipedia - The Best of: Volume 1 is the fifth compilation album by British group Depeche Mode. The album was released on 13 November 2006 by Mute Records (see 2006 in British music).[1]  Other compilation albums by the band include Catching Up with Depeche Mode  and People Are People (both North American-only releases) along with The Singles 81>85 and The Singles 86>98. The current collection consists of selected Depeche Mode singles from their twenty-five year career. Along with two recent singles from the Playing the Angel album, a new song "Martyr" - recorded during the Playing the Angel sessions - is also included in this collection and was released as a single in late October 2006. The album has sold over 1 million copies in Europe alone and has been awarded the IFPI Platinum Europe Award.

Amazon.com Review By Alan Wiley - By their very nature, best-of collections lend themselves to nostalgia, and Depeche Mode's instantly identifiable sound and string of pervasive, catchy singles are undoubtedly the soundtrack to many memories--memories served well by this fine collection of beautifully remastered songs. If you've heard any of the band's double-disc rereleases, you'll have an idea of just how good their remastered songs can sound. While there are some obvious omissions ("Somebody," "Policy of Truth"), compiling a career-spanning collection of Depeche Mode's best would be considered a challenge for just about anybody; and as this is Vol. 1, it seems obvious that there's more to come. There are a couple odd choices in the mix ("See You," "New Life") and the obligatory new track ("Martyr"), but the non-chronological mix makes these classics sound fresh and better than ever.
