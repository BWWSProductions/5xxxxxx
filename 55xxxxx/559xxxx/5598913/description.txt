Come to the Sunshine: Soft Pop Nuggets from the WEA Vaults  is a 2004 compilation album released by Rhino Handmade, one of two new compilations using the Nuggets name. The title comes from the first track, performed by Harpers Bizarre. As the title suggests, all 24 tracks were taken from the library of the Warner Music Group. The labels represented in this release are Atco, Colgems, Cotillion, Jubilee, Loma, Reprise, Valiant, and Warner Bros. Records.
The compilation was produced by Andrew Sandoval. The album was later re-released with a slightly revised track listing under the name "A Whole Lot of Rainbows", the title referring to the song by the Salt.  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
