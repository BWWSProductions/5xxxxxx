First off you're an idiot, Jake Gyllenhaal isn't Jewish or from Israel,  he's dutch, which is predominately catholic practicing. 
Secondly i hope that when you die you're reincarnated as a cow that gets slaughtered and sold to a grocery store, then bought by an old Jewish lady and turned into brisket for Passover diner, then digested and turned into something(that is in my opinion too good for you) and that is Jewish Shit. "
,thunderx7,2010-05-31T02:24Z,"@irishwristwatch:
From Jake's Wiki page:

""Gyllenhaal's father was raised in the Swedenborgian religion and is a descendant of the Swedish noble Gyllenhaal family. His last native Swedish ancestor was his great-great-grandfather, Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal.

Jake Gyllenhaal's mother is from a Jewish family from New York City, and Gyllenhaal has said that he considers himself ""more Jewish than anything else.""

Gyllenhaal's Bar Mitzvah celebration took place at a homeless shelter because his parents wanted to instill in him a sense of gratitude for his privileged lifestyle.""

Maitreya's real PURPSE is to teach people Dharma, but ONLY once everyone in the world has forgotten about it, and that means EVERYONE.. So not until then will anyone see him/her or ever hear any words from him in person.
