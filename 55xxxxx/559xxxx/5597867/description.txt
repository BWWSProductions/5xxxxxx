IMAGiNE NOTES
Well here we have a very nice Telesync for you to enjoy this weekend. On the OPENING DAY in the USA HeHe
First off many thanks to Relizlab for the great video and TA for the great audio, which together make this a great release.
We fixed the AR first, then we also balanced out the rgb colours, altered the contrast (made it darker), lowered the chroma, and cleaned the video noise.
Then on to the syncing of the audio which is very nice line audio. This was not an easy one, but we got it done... :P 
Enjoy :)
