Zoey is a cute, innocent-looking, 18 year-old from the infamous â€œOCâ€, aka Orange county, California. She grew up with very strict parents and that has put her in a rebellious stage of life. She tells Tony that she got her tattoos as her first act of rebellion, when she was in junior high, from a moonlighting tattoo artist because she want to prove she that she didnâ€™t need permission. Now she is into getting involved with older men and that is how she hooked up with Tony. Tony made the mistake of calling her â€œcute and innocentâ€ when he first saw here and Zoey told him off but he was able to turn it around and flirt with her.
