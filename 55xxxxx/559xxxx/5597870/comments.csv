,memphis100,2010-05-29T08:18Z,"Thanks DCrack. Unfortenetly there are no seeders. Maybe you can put the torrents in GAMES>PC, so everyone can find them,"
,DCrack,2010-05-29T18:49Z,"Done!
But I think it's a tracker problem, because I'm seeding and at least 7 more people have downloaded  the addon, so there must be more seeders."
,memphis100,2010-05-29T19:09Z,"I think you are right, I'm seeding all day and the ratio is still zero."
,DCrack,2010-05-29T19:36Z,Anyone knows how can I fix this? What trackers should I use?
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-29T20:29Z,"http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce

i always use that and openbittorrent"
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-29T20:35Z,"and i always add both trackers so theres 3 including thepiratebay.
 and make sure in your bit torrent client you've enabled enable dht, enable peer discovery and enable local peer discovery and any others available. 
dont know it works in azureous but it should be similar to utorrent."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-29T20:41Z,"http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce

http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce

thats the 2 i use DC."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-29T21:02Z,"just started the torrent and you've got peers on DHT and peer exchange so thats ok, theres just no connection to your tracker. have you done it as a private torrent in your bit torrent client cus that box should be unchecked, it shouldnt be private.
theres something not right DC cus these are excellent torrents and they would normally be loaded with activity from all the linked torrent sites.
i've always used utorrent so i dont know how azereous works man."
,DCrack,2010-05-30T03:53Z,"Thanks for the reply bro, I'll check it out in a bit"
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-31T01:33Z,"DC
i've just been reading about the openbittorrent tracker being down for legal reasons, i know it went down last week so looks like it could have problems.
just add the dennis stalker to ya torrents dude and it'll be fine. still got DHT also."
,DCrack,2010-05-31T05:47Z,"Yup, already did it, thanks"
,er01,2010-05-31T16:38Z,anyone get this to start downloading?

add that tracker to your utorrent or whatever bit torrent client you use, the uploaders added that tracker and it has seeds on it so it should work."
,aarque,2010-06-03T07:03Z,"Hey DC I think you got it going on, the search problem is a Pirate Bay issue IMO. I saw it happen before, right before they did a big upgrade then sold the whole schmeel.
 We were getting the same issues then, ""search engine overloaded"" and ""no items match your search,"" ya right, my search term is ""FSX"" and I was always and only getting results that didn't include anything past a certain date.
 This time I was lucky and happened to click the FSX in your tag description of the old mega, mostly because you were referring to some ""new mega"" and lo and behold, there was your new pack, hitchup's Cork and sunburst's Buff. So, for whatever reason, that ""search"" works and is what I will use until they upgrade yet again. 
 We already got talking adds from the last one, wonder what this time will bring; ads that reach out from the monitor and grab your wallet maybe? "
,chuckmamuck,2010-06-05T19:06Z,"aarque's right, the search function has been screwed so the usual method of typing FSX aint been revealing the latest uploads. seems to be sorted now tho cus i've just searched FSX and the latest uploads are now showing so hopefully its back to normal.
what happened to ogargen? he's not upped anything lately and his torrents are now showing as anonymous uploader."
,DCrack,2010-06-06T09:17Z,"Lol, yeah, tpb is getting really messy, it's a shame cause there's so much people here.
Anyway, check out the MegaPack comments, I posted a present for you guys :)"
,Tess_T_Kohls,2010-06-16T18:00Z,"EZDock Camera is one of the single most useful and fun FSX add-ons of all time, THANK YOU Dcrack!  

Not only is this the the latest version of EZdok, but Dcrack's programming mastery has yet again rendered a perfectly working, flawless, fully functioning version of the original.    

I've never encountered someone with so much skill in the FSX cracking world.   The man is a true Phenom, my goodness.    :)"

,runningdeer,2010-06-23T00:47Z,"Hi, thanx for all of your uploads.

What is the best way to make a request for an addon? There are a few that I really want.

Thank you."
,Majorsnipes,2011-01-04T16:28Z,@Dcrack: Can you crack Citation X 2.0 for Fs2004 pls???
,Emb170Capt,2011-02-01T03:47Z,"Sorry guys, it is just frustrating how you guys keep talkin about connection, peers, etc, rather then the software itself :/ sorry again i know it may be jus be thats annoyed but, the software to me does NOT work...why? well  here is why, i installed it, and first off lol shitty british manual, anyways the camera is fixed***** fixed as in, when you try to move in the vc or any view it goes back to one view* for example: Spot view, u try to move it goes back to the tail view.. VC view, if u try to move it goes to a corner of the VC and stays there.. it literally is annoyin, i know im not spendin 30, 40$ on this.. but same time i seen it in videos online and it looks so nice.. tell me guy(s), how did u get this thing to work >."

,Juppie902,2011-05-21T19:21Z,"Hey DCrack, I got my pretty hands on Captain Sim Weapon for FSX, I need someone to crack it.
I've already uploaded it on TPB. Go ahead and please try to crack it, so far F.B.I only extracted the files but it doesnt works that way with Captain Sim products. theres some reverse engineering needed to be done.

,fsaddonsgeek,2011-12-26T22:02Z,Please can you crack the VRS superbug
,escobarseason,2012-01-26T15:13Z,"hi,

I got this problem....
everytime I start FSX, with ezdoc 1.15, my processor goes 50%+

90% times when I hit the ''fly'' button FSX would crash stating an error...something about dinput8.dll, also ezdok camera crashes (not to mension it crashes everytime you close FSX)

I do have a lot of addons, q9550 OC-ed...etc....eyecandy..blah blah :)

I am aware of the fact that reaching for ""eyecandy"" graphics could cause app's to crash.

Do any of you folks know something about the ""dinput8.dll crash"" ? how to get rid of it...I do not want fly without ezdok neighter I am willing to let go of all my addons I've installed....

are such problems solved in the new 1.17 beta?
if so can we make DCrack do something about it ??? ;) :D

thanks in advance, best wishes from LZIB"
,escobarseason,2012-01-26T16:31Z,"alright, did a few reinstalls of ezdok 1.15....started fsx in windowed mode, everything seems to be fine....
just for the info if anyone else encounters similar problem....

PS: its odd, but after like..4 reinstalls (using config tool removal before system uninstall) I still had the key mappings, I've edited before the problems started.....which means, you have to delete them from the a/c config file after uninstall probably in order to REALLY uninstall everything including the mappings...."
,fuzdemon,2012-01-31T14:09Z,"ive donwloaded hundreds of torrents over the years but this is one im most grateful for, thanks a million."
,LostOblivion,2012-02-05T13:03Z,Req. 1.17!
