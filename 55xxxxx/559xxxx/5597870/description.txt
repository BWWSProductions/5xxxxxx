Flight One Software, in partnership with EZdok Software, is excited to offer EZdok Camera for Microsoft Flight Simulator X.

EZdok Camera (EZCA) is a camera and effects system and manager that enhances the pilot experience in FSX. It offers view control in Flight Simulator for easy navigation throughout the virtual cockpit and cabin, around the aircraft, and around the Flight Simulator world. But also very exciting are the effects exerted on the pilot, immersing the virtual pilot in a more realistic physical simulation of aviation. We believe EZCA is one of the "Must Have" technologies for FSX.

EZCA is a tool that incorporates visual effects of both pilot and camera shake, caused by aircraft accelerations, surfaces, and turbulence, that makes flying in Flight Simulator more immersing and realistic. EZCA is also a great tool that can be used by flight sim movie making enthusiasts to make their videos more exciting.
