Avira says that this file has a trojan in it. I hope that someone can prove that it's wrong.

[DETECTION] Is the TR/ATRAPS.Gen Trojan

The only detailed information that I could find about it with a quick google search was this:

"" TR/ATRAPS.Gen, also called as trojan ATRAPS or ATRAPS.Gen is a  trojan infostealer that deactivates Windows system functions and installs further malware onto the infected computer. Normally, TR/ATRAPS.Gen infects Pc's through porn content web sites, corrupt filesharing music and movie downloads or through video codecs and ActiveX updates.  After ATRAPS has sneaked inside the system it will activate corrupt wrm32.dll, new29.exe, kildh3l.dll files and download further viruses. The TR/ATRAPS.Gen is a disrupting trojan threat that can steal private information and harm computer files!"""
