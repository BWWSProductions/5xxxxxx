At least 15 attempts were made on Adolf Hitler's life. None succeeded, but one came close...

History  tells the story of the men who sought to change history by their own hand, introducing the personalities, detailing the plots and revealing the oversights and errors that made them fail. While historians and scholars provide a framework, it is the extraordinary testimony of surviving conspirators and bodyguards that brings these stories to life. Hunting Hitler centers on the events of July, 1944, when a party led by highly placed Nazi officers nearly killed their leader in the infamous ''Wolf's Lair,'' where he spent 900 days directing the German war effort. The program also uncovers never before released evidence of a top secret plot hatched in London to kill the Fuhrer.

Through luck, planning and paranoia, the most hated man on earth defied those who tried to take his life.
