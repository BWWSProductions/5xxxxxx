,zubbex,2010-11-27T04:35Z,is dvd-rip?.. thanks to the uploader.. plese tell me!!
,Thizzy007,2010-11-29T00:35Z,"@Zubbex, It is not a DVD rip, but the quality is there. It is a TV rip. It has the annoying CBS logo down at the bottom, the PG-13 rating in the top corner, and every once and a while you get the TV ads flashing at the bottom of the screen. A:9/10 V:9/10. Good torrent, but when I find a DVD rip of this season I will download it and trash this one. Thanks for the upload, Cyberpiraten!!"

,beebeerubi,2011-10-06T19:53Z,"I'm guessing it's just me since no one else made comment of this but 03x02 is only 2 mins long and then it stops and all you hear is audio. I'm watching it on my 360 so maybe that has something to do with it. Either way here is a link: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5103690/The_Big_Bang_Theory_S03E02_HDTV_XviD-XII_[eztv]
In case someone else has the same problem."
