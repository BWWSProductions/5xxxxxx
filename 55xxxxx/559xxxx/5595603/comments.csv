,The_Wizard_99,2010-05-28T16:17Z,"Maybe you should check out the forum to learn how to upload a torrent.
Tutorials are at http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=60880 and http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=60770"
,nuggetboy,2010-05-28T23:41Z,"Already done.  Followed it to a T.  And I've done this before.  Quite frustrating.  Changed ISPs recently, but the NAT checker indicates positive.  I'm puzzled.  I'll look closer when I get home."
,nuggetboy,2010-05-29T01:28Z,"The suprbay links are not working for me, although I know they were working last night when I posted the torrent.  The instructions I followed used openbittorrent as a tracker, which I used here.  I come to find out, the DNS for OBT was changed recently to 127.0.0.1, rendering it useless.  I wish there was a way to test this s**t before posting and wasting people's time."
,nuggetboy,2010-05-29T15:57Z,Working now with no changes on my end so it must have been something else in the pipe these last couple days.
,The_Wizard_99,2010-05-30T11:11Z,"Working how? It still shows no seeders, so it isn't working. D/L the torrent yourself and point it to where you have the files stored."
,nuggetboy,2010-05-30T20:07Z,"The ratio is up over 3.0 so some people have been able to grab this, but I don't think this is using the tracker (DHT?).  The TPB tracker resolves to 127.0.0.1 now, so ...

Sorry if you can't get this.  It's set up correctly (at least according to the forum instructions).  If you're still needing this album, it's on demonoid.  Beyond that, I can't help."
,nuggetboy,2010-05-30T20:26Z,"OK, I added publicbt.com's trackers and that seems to have vastly improved the situation.  As this is not using the TPB tracker(s) at all, I'm guessing seeders up above will always say 0 (unless they get those trackers back up).  Good luck."
