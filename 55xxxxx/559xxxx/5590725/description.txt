With the release of the Perfect Stranger album "Free Cloud", 
Israeli Yuli Fershtat once again established himself as one of the most 
influential progressive producers in 2008.
Using a fusion of melodic progressive and psychedelic trance with pumping techno grooves, the album was not only an interesting crossover album for the connoisseurs, but also a broad a success.

Proud to present a follow-up EP for the album, 
with remixes for the two tracks "Stardust" and "Free Cloud". 
The first "Stardust" remix is from the Russian brothers in the duo Moonbeam, 
who have had huge success in the last couple of years with a repertoire ranging 
from progressive house to melodic techno and deep minimal releases on labels 
like Traum, Proton, Black Hole, Armada, Ultra, Songbird and Tribal Vision Records.

Tracklist:

01. Stardust
02. Stardust (Moonbeam Remix)
03. Stardust (Eitan Reiter Remix)
04. Stardust (Felguk Remix)
05. Free Cloud (Perfect Stranger & A. Balter Remix)
