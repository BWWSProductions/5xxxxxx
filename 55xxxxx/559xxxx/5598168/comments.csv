,act378,2010-05-29T20:16Z,"Nice movie. I don't care about the entire story (as a matter of fact, I guess, no one does), but most fighters are extremely hot. It's a shame there are no deathmatches, but most knockouts are shown pretty juicy, with loser's faces big on screen.

The girls look trained, pretty, and show some good moves. It looks like most of the actresses are professional stunts.

The main difference between this film, and most all the other underground tournament movies: NO one SNIFFS AROUND and tries to call the police. The main character is not some undercover agent. the woman just wants to win the 16 women tournament, and that's what she finally does.

Hope the low-budget guys to wake up and do much more films of that kind. They're cute, stupid, and very exciting."
