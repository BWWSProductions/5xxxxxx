,gaaraisgod,2011-08-08T18:55Z,"It's an .iso file; Just use your favorite CD/DVD burning software and make a disc. Or better yet, use daemon tools or UltraISO to mount it. That way when it asks for the CD, you can just point it to the mounted image and keep your disc as a backup copy."
,gaaraisgod,2011-08-08T18:57Z,Thanks jkbulan. Lots of memories of me playing this game with my cousin :D

,GassySerbian,2012-07-10T01:10Z,"Ok i will make it easy on you noobs. Just download DAEMON Tools Lite, google it and install. then download the virtua tennis .iso file. The easiest way to mount the iso is to right click it > Open with > DAEMON Tools. If you dont hav daemon tools in that list go to Choose default program and then select daemond tools and just click OK. The game setup should run then."
