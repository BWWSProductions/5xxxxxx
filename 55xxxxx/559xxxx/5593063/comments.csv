the serial is worthless and the Reg file is worthless"
,kayzzar,2010-07-28T16:15Z,Does not work. Invalid serial.
,kheady,2010-12-19T14:21Z,"Works 100%

To the other comments who say this doesn't work.
IT DOES!!!!

You just have to read the instructions! If you don't find the string value ""FC"" in the registry, then take a look at Step #7 and try again.

If it still doesn't work for you. Then try downloading a torrent called ""Hooked on Phonics"", because your a moron and can't read simple instructions.

THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD!!!!"
