,xan1242,2010-06-29T20:57Z,"This actually works.For some idiots,when you patch the game you have to have an original exe."
,jsps13,2010-09-21T14:41Z,"Works perfectly!
Grateful!"
,xsaintzx,2011-01-23T10:27Z,"Thanks it works without problems, if you follow instruction.
I don't know what changes include in this update, however I realize the ultra fps drops during loading has been fixed, at least for me."
,StrikeFromAbove,2011-05-08T11:01Z,"If you get CRC error it means that patch can't find path to the game.
Add or alternate this registry keys:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE-SOFTWARE-Activision-Blur
""InstallPath""=""app""
""EXEString""=""appBlur.exe"""
