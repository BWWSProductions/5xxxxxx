Plot:

Amir is a heartbreaker...literally. As a relationship termination
specialist, he provides dumping services for disgruntled daters and
spends his days delivering the bad news to unsuspecting lovers across
Los Angeles. Though Amir claims he is just the messenger, the job makes
him cynical and, as a result, the last bachelor in his group of friends.
This becomes clear when his recently-engaged best friends tells him he
can no longer be his Best Man because of bad relationship karma.

When Amir returns to his family's home for Thanksgiving, he is reunited
with his long-lost cousin, Zara, who decides to hitch a ride back to LA
with him. As a joke, the two cousins pretend to be a couple in front of
Amir's friends and their charade comes dangerously close to going too far.
