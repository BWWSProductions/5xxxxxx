        Wilson Rawl's unforgettable classic story about a boy and  his
        dogs,  which  has  been loved  for  generations.  Now all  the
        adventure and simple wisdom of the cherished novel come  alive
        in the all-new  movie Where The  Red Fern Grows.  What 10-year
        -old Billy Coleman (Joseph Ashtonn) wants most in the world is
        a hunting dog. After two long years of hard work, he saves  up
        enough money  to buy  a pair  of redbone  hound pups, and it's
        love at first  sight! Before long,  Bill trains "Old  Dan" and
        "Little Ann" to be the  finest hunting team in the  valley. As
        the  inseparable  trio  chase  the  wily  "ghost  racoon"  and
        confront danger together, Billy learns the meaning of loyalty,
        courage  and  perseverance.  Featuring  songs  by  Wynonna and
        Alison Kruass, and starring  Ned Beatty, Dabney Coleman,  Kris
        Kristofferson  and recording  sensation Dave  Matthews in  his
        film debut,  Where The  Red Fern  Grows is  a timeless tale of
        love and frienship that will entertain and inspire the  entire
        family.
