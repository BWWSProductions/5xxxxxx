Hardball - 2001 - DVDRip - BlueDevil


Conor O'Neill (Reeves) is a down-on-his-luck gambler in debt
to dangerous loan sharks. Desperate for cash, Conor reluctantly
takes a job coaching a youth baseball team. The "team" turns out
to be a ragtag group of tough-talking kids from Chicago's inner
city. Secretly, Conor plans to desert the team after he wins a
big bet. But the stakes are higher than Conor imagined: The kids
need someone to believe in. As Conor wrestles with his past, the
kids start to teach him some lessons that will forever change his
future - that responsibility and trust must be earned and hope
can appear in the most unlikely places.
