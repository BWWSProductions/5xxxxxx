Aqua teen hunger force season 7. High Quality Video. Each episode is in 2 parts. I usually just open up my playlist in media player classic HC, and add both files. Also, each file is in FLV format, since I haven't had the time to find a decent converter. The ones I tried left me with AVI files of much lesser quality.

The original source is FLV anyways, so you're getting the original shit with no fucking with. All you need is the K_Lite codec pack, just the light distro will do.

Noobs: With this description, you should easily be able to watch these files on Media Player, or MPC-HC. If you cannot figure it out by now, then chances are you have the money to buy the DVD when it comes out. (People lacking common sense and street smarts tend to have jobs behind desks with money to spare.)

Enjoy, and Long Live The Pirate Bay.
