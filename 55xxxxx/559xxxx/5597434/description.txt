Throw Down Your Heart chronicles banjo virtuoso and 18 time Grammy award winner Bela Fleck's musical journey to Africa to explore the little known African roots of the banjo. Bela's boundary-breaking musical adventure takes him to Uganda, Tanzania, The Gambia, and Mali, and provides a glimpse of the beauty and complexity of African music. Using his banjo, BÐ¹la transcends barriers of language and culture, finding common ground and forging connections with musicians from very different backgrounds.
