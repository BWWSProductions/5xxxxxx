Caleb is an ex-marine who's drifting through life, moving
around, jumping from one pointless job to another, trying
to find answers. He moves back to his childhood home to
escape his nightmares and get his life back on track. He
finds that everything's different. His high school
sweetheart is now engaged. His parish priest, to whom he
always turned for support, is struggling with his own
crisis of faith. And instead of getting better, the
nightmares start getting worse. Then they start coming
