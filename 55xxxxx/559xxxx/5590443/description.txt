Notes::::::::::::::::::
well, here's a mint V2 TS of shrek 4, the video is pretty awesome if you ask me, really nice...was typical
day later better version comes out :P, anyway...lowered the red quite alot, as it was really heavy, used
a medium video denoise, and slight sharpness filter, contrast and brightness and some other bits, overall
it's pretty damn good...audio is our own filtered also, audio + video both great, included sample from
1 of the darker scenes, and sample from lighter scene, Enjoy! //prism
