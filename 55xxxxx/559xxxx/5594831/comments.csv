,forgetaboutit,2010-07-01T07:29Z,"Thanks for the huge upload zenthor!

Some of the episodes have the wrong audio in season 3 and 4 have the wrong audio. 

Also season 5 and 6 are TV rips in (I think) 1080, the others are 720. 

Would you please upload the affected episodes in another torrent for us? I would like to have a complete collection. I think there are three episodes in season 3 (which have the audio of the previous episode) and one in 4 (#13 has the commentary track).

I can cornfirm that Episode 5 of Season 2 has the wrong subtitles.
Episode 13 and 16 of Season 3 do indeed have the wrong audio.
I'm currently at Season 4 Ep. 11.
So far this torrent is perfect ;]

Would be incredible if you could upload the affected episodes and mayby a Blu-ray rip of season 5 and 6 (like forgetaboutit said)"
