You have to make .dvd file by yourself.

.dvd file name should be ""Need for Speed Most Wanted (XBOX 360 - PAL).dvd""

Text in .dvd file should be:

LayerBreak=1913760
Need for Speed Most Wanted (XBOX 360 - PAL).iso

[T],thenoobish,2010-05-30T19:23Z,I recommend downloading Utorrent! You wont get any padding file with that one!
,pickled_egg,2010-05-31T00:26Z,"Even uTorrent sometimes gets padding files from torrents by crap uploaders who just nick from other sites & then claim credit here.
It's usually a way for the original site to show where the files came from when uploaded elswhere"
,neCso,2010-05-31T07:32Z,"Yeah, I agree, if you feel better."
,neCso,2010-06-01T07:13Z,"99.8 % is 100 %, because .iso file is downloaded and all you have to do now is create a .dvd file."
,DJCoolkat,2010-06-01T19:37Z,"You can download but no one seed ????

"
,neCso,2010-06-02T07:28Z,"Because no one has .dvd file, so there is no 100%. Yes, you can download the game allright, just wait for 99.8% and you're done."
