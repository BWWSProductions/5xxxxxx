,jasiono,2010-12-18T06:10Z,"I got that error message like everyone else so what I did is run it as administrator. It gave me the option of adding another email/serial number in so I did that. 

It works when I run it as an admin now. This is honestly the best converting software for apple products and videos in general. 

Everything else is crappy compared to this. "
