,Reisende Mac,2010-09-29T14:04Z,"SERIOUSLY, can people start seeding once you've downloaded the episodes?? I've been seeding this and the other episodes for a good while now, and I have a sharing rate between 70 and 90, BUT - everyone else seem to just hit and run, since there are constantly just 1 or 2 seeders.

If you do like the show and want other people to watch it, then stop being leeching fags and keep the torrents alive."
