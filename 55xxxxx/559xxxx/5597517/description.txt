        Since the Age of Enlightenment, the gap between the known  and
        the  unknown has  shrunk considerably.  We have  mapped every
        corner of our  planet and explored  our universe, but  despite
        this countless phenomena still remain unexplained.

        The Unexplained is a breathtaking new series from The  History
        Channel  that  probes the  mysteries  of the  world.  From the
        shocking voodoo rituals of  the Caribbean to the  secret alien
        research centre  at Area  51, from  the shadowy  doings of the
        Skull &  Bones to  terrifying vampire  myths, The  Unexplained
        will separate fact from fiction.

        Prepare yourself for a chilling journey into The Unexplained.

        Studies show that  almost 20 percent  of Americans believe  in
        UFOs.  And,  as  the much  publicized  Heaven's  Gate incident
        pointed out, some of these  people will go to extreme  lengths
        in the name of their  belief. UFO CULTS AND GROUPS  traces the
        history of Heaven's Gate and compares it to another UFO group,
        the Unarius  Academy, looking  for insight  into this  growing
        phenomenon. Why do people join  these groups, and why do  some
        abandon  all logic  and reason  in doing  so? Interviews  with
        former and current members of the groups offer a  first-person
        view of what they are like, and point out the vast differences
        among them. Some are  truly cults, which indoctrinate  members
        and force  them to  embrace new  beliefs and  behaviors, while
        others are simply people joined together by a common interest.
        From the tragedy of Heaven's Gate to the remarkable number  of
        people who belong to UFO groups of all descriptions, this is a
        thought-provoking look at a ""fringe"" belief that may not  be
        as far from the mainstream as most think.
