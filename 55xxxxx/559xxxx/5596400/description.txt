It has been my pleasure sharing the stage with Joe Redner many times at the
Night Moves Awards Show. He is a gentleman , entrepreneur, and freedom fighter.
He singlehandedly turned an eye-sore into an attractive gentleman's club, even
raising the real estate value of the surrounding neighborhood. Joe is a classy
guy and this documentary chronicles him beautifully. ---Ron Jeremy

He dropped out of school in the 10th grade! He has been arrested 150 times!
He earned his GED in jail at the age of 40! And he has run for local public
office 8 times! Take a journey into the life and career of the man who came
from poverty, got into the strip club business, ended up owning the most
notorious strip club in the world, the Mons Venus, and then continued to
build a real estate empire, became a multi-millionaire and a 1st Amendment
freedom fighter! Described as the Larry Flynt of the South, Joe Redner is
the classic American- Dream story come true!!
