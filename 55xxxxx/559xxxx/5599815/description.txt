Most commended firefighter Steve Lockwood misses his
accident)killed wife Molly terribly. Taking risks not by
the book, the hero gets suspended. His kid brother Frank
Lockwood fails to help him date again. Then Steve saves
freelance-author Grace Harding's life 'accidentally'
passing her house on fire. She's encouraged to thank him
in person, but already engaged with businessman Cliff
who would be perfect if he weren't almost constantly on
business trips
