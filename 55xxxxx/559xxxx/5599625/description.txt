  â€¦And Then There Was X is the third album by American rapper DMX, released 
on December 21, 1999. The first single of the album, the club banger 'What's 
My Name' was released, which got heavy rotation on both radio and television.
The album sold very well selling roughly 698,000 in its first week and went 
on to be certified 5x Platinum making it DMX's best-selling album to date. It
also reached #1 on the Billboard chart yet again, firmly ranking DMX within 
hip hop's only artist to have all 3 (eventually, leading up to 5) of their 
albums reach the #1 spot.
