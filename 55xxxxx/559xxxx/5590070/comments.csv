,theRealOnes,2010-07-06T02:28Z,Download a single episode and see for yourself. Most of them have similar quality. I'd say they are pretty good.

,kambic,2011-02-09T08:30Z,"Overall, I am glad to be able to download all the episodes together, but a number of the episodes (seems like this mostly started around season 3?) seem to have some glitching. This occurs on my desktop and netbook (tried with both WMP and VLC) and on my Droid X (using the RockPlayer Lite app). To double check I re-downloaded a single episode and the glitching occurred in the same places. On some episodes there is as much as ten minutes (accumulative) which will not play.

A bit disappointing, but still nice to be able to get everything all together. If I am doing someone wrong and someone can point out to me that this is on my end, then I'll correct this, but between various media players and systems, it seems to be the files themselves."
,Jaguar0616,2011-02-20T16:46Z,Watch out for this one. I dl'ed all of season 4 and none of the files were viewable.
