Notes

Used Relizlab video Plus Imagine line audio(thanks to TA for 
making it possible) great sources!
Cleaned video up a bit by fixing AR to 2.35:1.
Also thought there was too much Orange and yellow base so i
fixed the colors. Also fixed the contrast and brightness Turned 
out pretty good i think. well watchable. Wish all sources were
this nice on first days! Also added a slight sharpen filter to it.

Looking for cam video/audio, direct line audio, pre released
r5s, ntsc and pal dvds, dvd/screeners, anything useful
