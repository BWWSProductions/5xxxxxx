,Saiurie,2010-06-08T06:04Z,Hell Yeah worked great thanks
,Gloryeagle,2010-06-08T21:12Z,"works great, just like most of cracks, you download and replace the .exe in program files with the one give."
,hootieman,2010-06-19T21:00Z,so does that mean I get webcam support finally?
,Seer666,2010-06-21T21:38Z,This is awesome.  Thank you for this!  Now astra finally loses that eye-scalding shade of blue.
,Minimanser69,2010-07-07T22:16Z,Why is mine not pro??
,FJRoberts,2010-07-10T00:45Z,"you are the best, you make it so easy, and virus free!"
,forumsfeedback,2010-09-05T08:24Z,mine starts updating automatically and then won't sign on. i've copied the crack and I don't see a way of stopping the updating. so for me this doesn't work.
,thenext8seconds,2010-09-30T09:15Z,"same problem. all the sudden the same version of trillian just suddenly has the ability to update itself and taking away the pro features, otherwise you can't login to it anymore.

wtf!"
,biggblack86,2010-10-28T07:17Z,i can also confim. whenever i open it just starts to auto update. try to cancel it and it will no longer let you sign in >_
,GSmoke827,2010-11-01T04:59Z,"Okay, here's the deal.  It worked for me, not sure if it will work for everyone.

1.) Completely uninstall the program.
2.) Remove the downloaded torrent.
3.) Use CCleaner to clean registry and drive. (You may not need to do this.
4.) Disable AntiVirus software
5.) Download the torrent again.
6.) Install Trillian with AntiVirus still disabled.
7.) Move Crack to program folder.
8.) Start up Trillian.

The update should run smoothly and you will be able to log in.

It is now safe to enable AntiVirus software."
,paradox137,2010-11-07T16:58Z,"@Gsmoke

that didnt work :/

how do we make it NOT update at all? i like this program, wish it would work."
,heiden6,2010-12-07T22:13Z,"Updates automatically after cracking, no pro version. Does anyone know how to crack this without this problem, or how to stop automatic updating? I have checked all the preferences and searched online but no solution..."
[V],phatwarez,2010-12-25T20:04Z,"Yea, phones home =\"
,Pluffy,2011-01-21T18:57Z,"Guys, here's what I do to keep my trillian cracked:

I leave it update, and at any moment (like 1% or 68% of the update) I press cancel, then sign in again. The update starts again, and then the custom theme n archive n all are available. 

The only thing is that you can't make any changes after all to your astra account and there will be a an annoying banner there with ""Astra is disconnected"" though the services of yahoo , google, msn , they all work.

I'm sure waiting for a crack for the new version as well."
