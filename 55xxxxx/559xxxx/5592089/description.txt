Wikipedia - Snoop Doggy Dogg's Greatest Hits is a Greatest hits album that includes his hits and also includes 6 never before released songs from Snoop Dogg's Death Row Records days. It was released on October 23, 2001 by Suge Knight. It was re-released on March 20, 2006.

Amazon.com Review By Dalton Higgins - Chuck D of Public Enemy once prophesized that if artists didn't own their masters (tapes), the masters will own the artists. Well, hip-hop's fave gangster CEO Suge Knight owns most of his former high-profile label mates' master tapes and continues to issue collections of dated works by Tha Dogg Pound, Dr. Dre, and now Snoop. Originally entitled Dead Man Walking to scare the willies out of Snoop, this release comes with a big fat greasy caveat emptor. Sure, this is a ghetto fab collection of the Doggfather's finest pre-No Limit and Doggystyle Records moments dating back to his brilliant cover of Biz Markie's "Vapors" on Tha Doggfather album. That said, Snoop wants nothing to do with this release because he won't receive any proceeds from it and has urged his fans not to buy it. Contractual shenanigans aside, this release is off the hook and contains most of Snoop's finest career headbangers, from "Gin and Juice" to "Who Am I (What's My Name)." A great purchase if you can live with your conscience.
