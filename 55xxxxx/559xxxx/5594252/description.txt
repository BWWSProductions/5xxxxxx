         bu Dhabi will set out on the biggest project to date -        
         a new micro-city with a round skyscraper taller than          
         the Statue of Liberty and curved glass skin covering the      
         area of four football fields. The spherical design and        
         the proposed site pose numerous challenges, including         
         design stability and a location that is half a mile out       
         in the Persian Gulf and 25 feet under water. On top of        
         everything, this skyscraper must be completed in just 30      
          montmonths' time.
