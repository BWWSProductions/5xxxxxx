The Covenant Four Quartet has been ministering in West Coast churches and Christian conference centers since 1963.  It began its ministry with members of the San Francisco Covenant Church but the new members are from a variety of church homes.

The Quartet's musical style is their own version of â€œSouthern Gospelâ€ with barbershop blends and harmonies.
