plz upload Solomon Kane

thank u."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-29T20:21Z,"@fourty80: I did Solomon Kane twice, DVDrip maybe seven days ago. I deleted the torrent when number of Hit&Runs went sky-high. I announced that to peers in Comment section, gave enough time to change their behavior and when that didn't happened - ""Delete torrent"" button was half clicks away.
My work and my torrents should be treated with respect. That's the minimum I expect from total strangers who get something for free from a guy who sit beyond the keyboard half world away."
,lilars26,2010-05-29T21:09Z,"Thanks 20-40.
I need a good laugh."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-29T21:39Z,"This torrent exceeded 80% Hit&Runs right now.

So small, good encode and funny movie, but obviously treated like garbage.
From majority who treat everything as themselves."

[V],twentyforty,2010-05-31T21:53Z,"@fourty80: I cannot. TPB does not allow re-uploads, such torrents are rejected by database and uploading mechanism."
