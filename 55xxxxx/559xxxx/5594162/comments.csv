Just to let you know it is a fantastic quality upload. Thank you so much to rbft. Took almost a week to download due to selfish leechers buggering off once that they had finished downloading. I will continue to seed. Looks like there's just 4 of us doing so. PLEASE do NOT stop once you have downloaded. Let's keep this superb torrent alive for others to enjoy."

Still I'll give it a try. Jeez I remeber the Saturday afternoon movies. 6 pence to get in. 20 cartoons, buck rogers serial and a tom mix or lash larue movie."

I LOVED that show sooooo much as a kid!
And I'm always thinking 'Bidididididid', 'Oh-oh'! *LOL*

Thanks and yes, I'll seed. (Btw - some people aren't dl'ng and running because they r selfish, rather they are paranoid that they'll get into trouble)."
