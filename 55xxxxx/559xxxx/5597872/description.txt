        Clowns are usually the last people you'd suspect of committing
        crimes, so Jupiter,  Pete and Bob  - The Three  Investigators 
        -  hardly pay  attention when  a clown  sneaks into  Jupiter's
        birthday party and  tries to make  off with something.  Though
        they don't catch  the clown, they  retrieve his booty:  it's a
        tape of Jupiter's parents, who died several years earlier. The
        only thing that's clear in the garbled tape is that  Jupiter's
        parents were also investigators, and on the trail of something
        big...  Jupiter vows  to solve  the mystery  his parents  were
        working  on.  The only  clue  they have  is  the name  Stephen
        Terrill,  a  once-famous inventor  who  lived in  what  is now
        called  "Terror Castle."  The boys  soon found  out how  aptly
        chosen the name is: doors open by themselves, gates slam  shut
        as  if  by  magic,  things  move,  slide,  crash,  appear  and
        disappear. Plus there seems to be a ghost! It would all be too
        much  for the  hardy trio  if it  weren't for  the ethereally
        pretty Caroline, a little girl who claims she is a psychic and
        fells a particularly  strong bond towards  Bob. Unfortunately,
        Caroline is also the daughter of the local sheriff, who  shoos
        them away  from Terror  Castle. It  takes more  than a  narrow
        -eyed,   ill-tempered   sheriff  to   shake   off  the   three
        investigators,  however, and  soon the  boys are  back in  the
        house,  determined to  find out  what Jupiter's  parents were
        looking for - something that  is supposed to be hidden  in the
        house. Fearlessly defying the mysterious machines that seem to
        make the house itself come alive, they penetrate to the secret
        heart  of  Terror  Castle  and  come  upon  Stephen  Terrill's
        invention: a  diamond-making machine!  But there's  no time to
        admire the stones, for  the ghost of Stephen  Terrill appears 
        - and he doesn't like intruders...
