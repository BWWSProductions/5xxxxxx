[T],tifon,2010-05-26T17:46Z,19/05/2010 TPB tracker is not good. Looking for another tracker to it. 
[T],keeybee,2010-05-26T18:31Z,"OK! Now I understand.
But the tracker, I suppose, is added when I upload the torrent. Anything I can do, to maybe make it better?"

Thanks for the Del Shannon.  Nice sound on this cd.
Mostly mono.  Stereo ""Sea Of Love"" sounds really
nice.  First time I've heard Del on SOL.
