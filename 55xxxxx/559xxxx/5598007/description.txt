The Sims 3 Complete Store (May 2010)


This release contains all sets/objects released till 29-May-2010.


There is only a single .exe file which is a self-extracting archive (FreeArc) which doesn't contain any viruses/trojans/malware so please don't comment until you try. This method gained a highly superior compression ratio compared to traditional methods (RAR/ZIP).

1. Unpack release
2. Copy the resulting folder to: (My) Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/Downloads
3. Install the using the game launcher
4. Enjoy and keep seeding!

Version tested: 3.2.8 (it should be compatible with any version above 1.5)

PS: All the packages included in this release are decrypted and can be installed using the Sims3 launcher, which was impossible till now due to the recent updates (patch 1.8+). There is no need to modify resource.cfg or to install .dbc files.
