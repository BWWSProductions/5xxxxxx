,simsandwhich,2010-06-03T02:34Z,"Great download, one glance at the list of files and everything seems to be there (well, the worthwhile shit anyway). Having no problems installing with launcher at version 4.0.87 (Ambitions). Thanks very much!"
,MrFisse,2010-06-03T08:23Z,"Yeah installs fine using ambitions. To bad it doesnt go further than that. None of the content shows up ingame. Anyone got this to work IN-game, with ambitions?

Thanks for the up though viper. How was the encryption bypassed btw if you have any idea about that."
,Viper666.,2010-06-03T08:56Z,"@MrFisse

By using ""Decrapify"" and a few personal tweaks.

I really have no idea if it works with Ambitions cause they updated the launcher again and i didn't test it yet."
,Liman_Bot,2010-06-03T09:52Z,Viper i cant Download This can u tell me why It says that everything is inactive i just Update it but nothing Hapens what should i Do

,Viper666.,2010-06-03T14:10Z,"@Liman_Bot

1st of all stop spamming comments, put everything in ONE comment

secondly, check your torrent client settings cause its 100% an issue on your side (be sure DHT,PEX are enabled)"
,MrFisse,2010-06-03T17:33Z,"I see Viper, had no idea it could do that. But runing it now again i see there is a switch for just that :P Well nice job again, installed the whole thing again just because i saw your torrent and that ambititions just was released. But like i said dont seem to work with ambitions. Says installed and everything in the launcher but still a no-go ingame. Hope this is something you can fix! :) cheers"
,Liman_Bot,2010-06-04T00:11Z,Sry it was my faulti but yes it doesent see m to work with ambitions :S
,Viper666.,2010-06-04T09:56Z,"hmmm i got everything installed just before i installed Ambitions and they are still there...

i deleted them and tried to reinstall... they appeared installed in the launcher and they also appeared ingame (after i turned the custom content on, cause apparently the game update turned it off in my case). Maybe this is the problem you guys are having.

If not... back to the ""drawing board"" for me..."
,Liman_Bot,2010-06-04T20:32Z,"Lolz yes Thank u very much It worked For me 2
xD i thought it wouldnt so posted that comment But thank U mu sister Loves it :)"
,Icyyoo,2010-06-06T06:13Z,How do i unpack it?
,Liman_Bot,2010-06-06T11:12Z,MAybe u can download freearc i did it with that!
,Viper666.,2010-06-06T15:05Z,...just double click it like any other self extracting archive...
,Valcorian,2010-06-07T16:30Z,A few things - This does not have the ultra lounge kitchen and bath.  It also might be missing the new beach clothes from May - it has the furniture.  That or neither of these things are installing properly.  My first install also messed up the vehicles.  May have something to do with the Renault.  I had to remove all custom content and start over from scratch.  I didn't install the renault though.  All that is noticeably missing is the Ultra Lounge Kitchen and Bath and some bathing suits.  Otherwise great work.
,Valcorian,2010-06-07T16:53Z,"Ok - Double Checked - Definitely missing the Ultra Lounge Kitchen and Bath.  The Surf, Sun, and Sand says it is the Swim + Sleep...but it is just the Sleep.  I installed it with nothing else installed and all it put in was the Furniture, no outfits.  Everything else seems to be ok, except it says I have a motorcycle installed, I just can't see it in the game or where the motorcycle came from.  Only one I see is the one that came with Ambitions."
,admilius,2010-06-09T11:22Z,is bahaus there?
,Valcorian,2010-06-09T17:06Z,Bauhaus is there.  The only two things missing is Ultra Lounge Kitchen and Bath and the May Swimwear.  I found the motorcycle (It was just a toy one hahaha)
,Rozensky,2010-06-12T14:27Z,does this have all store items? 09-may 2010?
,Valcorian,2010-06-12T17:42Z,No - read above - It is missing the swimwear but not the swim furniture.  It is also missing Ultra Lounge Kitchen and Bath.  Everything else seems to be included.
,Rozensky,2010-06-12T18:48Z,"more awesome than you have that set, im just not sure about the swimsuits. i would also like to know if all May items are here already so i would know what to download next, if i should start getting the June items or if there are still items missing that i need to get."
,Rozensky,2010-06-12T18:52Z,oh yeah sorry for double posting but i just wanted to know if this are all paid items or the free and bundle pack items are included aswell? 
,Valcorian,2010-06-13T01:08Z,"It has EVERY item released in the store, paid/promotional except for the May Swimsuits and the Ultra Lounge Kitchen and Bath"
,Valcorian,2010-06-13T01:09Z,"It has EVERY item from the store promotional/paid EXCEPT for May's Swimsuits, everything from June, and the Ultra Lounge Kitchen and Bath"
,Rozensky,2010-06-13T06:31Z,"oh ok thank you, i already have every store item till present June. thanks for this!!"
,lynei_marie,2010-06-14T23:39Z,is tehre a faster way to install this other than one by one
,Valcorian,2010-06-15T07:02Z,"Run the Sims 3 Launcher and then choose downloads - All of the items should be there if you extracted them to the correct place.  (The extractor should handle that for you)  Select them all - then choose install.  They will all install at once.  I recommend having no previously installed Downloadable Content before you do this...as my first install didn't work so well and when I did a clean install, it worked much better.  Notable conflicts are the Earth Day Cars - since there is a british and american, I think it didn't like the original british copy."
,havanagoodtime,2010-06-15T22:01Z,hey im using a mac running snow leopard and the file doesnt extract. what am i doing wring?

I'm so happy with all this stuff but It does not appear en my game. I already checked if it was enabled (the ""run without CC"" checkbox). The items appear to be installed... They appear under installed content in the laucher... can somebody help me?

Thanks."
,exclusteve,2010-06-18T21:55Z,"hey man,
will this work with ambitions? im not able to make custom content show up in game ever since i tried installing high-end loft stuff. and i think it is because of the update. ea seems to block custom content that has been downloaded, not bought, from the game. it shows up in the launcher though, it shows as installed but it doesnt show up in game. 
custom content works with world adventures still but after high-end loft stuff it wont show up in game. i dont know about ambitions.
ive been researching/""googling"" for a solution, found some forums thats talking about the same thing, but i found no none. so is there any way, by any chance, to make custom content to show in game with all the expansion pack? itd be wonderful if there is.
thanks ^^"
,Helen72307,2010-06-24T02:28Z,I was just wondering if i'm doing something wrong cause some of the full sets aren't downloading right there showing the cardboard boxes. If someone knows what i'm doing wrong please tell me. thanks!

,xxmeegs20xx,2010-07-20T00:06Z,"Is anyone else having an issue with the store items not showing up in the game? I'm running Ambitions, and I have downloaded this torrent, another torrent to test, uninstalled and reinstalled all my games. All the items worked with the base game and WA.

Everyone Else: If you're having issues with your CC showing up in-game after the latest patch - please look up ""decrapify"" - I followed the few web pages and I was able to get my items up and running.

Thanks for the torrent Viper"
,DraGirl,2010-07-24T08:42Z,I have no problem with these items showing in my game and i didn't decrapify any of it. Why is this happening? I think Viper's torrent is fine right? Unlike some others is totally not showing
,SC4922,2010-08-07T19:44Z,"I only have Sims 3-- not the expansion packs (I don\'t want them). Can I use only the items that work for the original game? Will the launcher be able to tell which items don\'t need the expansions?

I don\'t care about using every item. I just want to use the ones that don\'t require expansion packs. "
,DraGirl,2010-08-10T06:33Z,Actually all the sets ARE usable without any Expansion Packs. As long as you have the latest update installed with your base game and the items will works fine  
,SigPwnUuuu,2010-08-12T11:52Z,Downloading now hope it works

Ive updated it using the ea launcher to the latest version now every download i try to install using the launcher the message appears sims pack..(number of the package) FAILED.
SO im unable to install new stuff like cars and clothing and other sets. will it let me install this store-may2010 items?"

,Neelg,2010-09-11T00:45Z,ok i think viper's dowloads are the working ones.. the old downloads even if they are from pbay and working ones no longer show up in the game after installation coz of the new ea updates that blocks pirated software and only accepts stuff purchased from store... so all downloads should show up on the primary versions of the game the updated ones... after 1.14 onwards start the blocking thing..u cant get anything to work if u dont get a fresh download im trying this one now..

Thank you. Will keep an eye out."
,xlivE13x,2010-09-17T16:05Z,"don't download this. it's not really worth it. 
if you know anything about the sims, you'd know about delphy's dashboard tool, and you'd use it a lot. it's a tool to check .packages for corrupted files, conflicts, disabled, sims2 files, and empty files.
so of course, I used it (after converting the files to .package ) 
there are lots of conflicts and corrupted files, as well as some empty, disabled, and sims2 files.
corrupted files are the problem, as they are what can keep your game from working, and some attach themselves to objects you upload on the exchange, or else where, and it just spreads like a virus. so don't download, unless you know how to get rid of those

(no offense to the uploader of this, I'm not saying you purposely did it, I'm sure you didn't)"
,chobitscrazy,2010-09-20T03:54Z,I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but nothing is appearing in the download section of the launcher all the files are in C:\Users\\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Downloads\COMPLETE STORE ITEMS MAY 2010

So if you actually BOUGHT ambitions or high end loft stuff... 
I'm pretty sure you're out of luck. 
Due to new updates EA is blocking ""not bought from the store"" downloaded content.

You can extract it, install it but as soon as you play the game. Nothings there. You look back at the launcher and nothings installed ( though before it was )"
,reckoneer,2010-10-04T01:18Z,"First of all thank you poster, it works perfectly and its really simple.

Secondly everyone who said it dont work with expansions is ether a liar or just had problem with pc or his game version. I installed it after world adventures and high end loft stuff and i installed Ambitions after and it works and all items are there.

And just one question to the poster. Will you be making additional torrents (May 2010-now)?"
