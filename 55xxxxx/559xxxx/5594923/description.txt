Greetings!

I'm the author of these images, and the artist who created the oil paintings, drawings, etc. that these images portray, and hereby release these files under the Creative Commons "Attribution Share Alike (CC-BY-SA)" license.  This represents most of my artistic output since 1997- for some images I either don't have photographic documentation, or the image quality is subpar. I'll be putting these up on Wikimedia Commons, also, or someplace like that. Inspired by Negativland.

Please let me know if you have any questions, comments or suggestions- I can be contacted through my website, http://buckwheatandgrits.com, also interesting, relevant, or kind words can be made in the comments section of The Pirate Bay.

Thank you for looking!
