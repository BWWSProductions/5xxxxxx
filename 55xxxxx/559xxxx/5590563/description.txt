         SUMMARY:
         
              What if life on Earth began in outer space? Millions
              of people accept the theory that intelligent life
              forms visited Earth thousands of years ago and were
              worshiped as gods by primitive man. Are monuments like
              Stonehenge and Easter Island the last remains of an
              ancient alien visitation? From unexplainable super
              structures, to knowledge of the solar system,
              mathematics, and even the ability to make electricity,
              this special explores evidence of super-human
              influences on ancient man and embarks on an
              around-the-world search for answers. It's an
              investigation into a theory some believe cannot be
              true, but many agree cannot be ignored.

         RELEASE  NOTES:
         
              This was the pilot for the current show. Note that
              the first 6 minutes is straight from the Ancient
              Aliens special from a little over a year ago. After
              that new scenes are in this ep. My guess is after
              watching it about 50% is new and 50% direct rom the
              Ancient Aliens special.
