IS there any way you could upload the ""Sold Out [In Stereo] 2002"" album by itself? My copy is bad. For some reason only half of each song plays, then skips to the next track. It's only this album and ""Selections for Friends"" 2007. I got a new SFF '07 from www.archive.org. The rest are fine. Otherwise, any advice? Thank You!"
