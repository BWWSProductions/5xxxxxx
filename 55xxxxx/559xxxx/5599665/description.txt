Storyline:

In his internet-distributed miniseries â€˜Dr. Horribleâ€™s Sing-Along Blogâ€™, Joss Whedon puts his chorus where his comic books are,
uniting once and for all his loves of sci-fi and musical theater.
Broadway vet Neil Patrick Harris stars as the titleâ€™s cut rate supervillain, a wannabe whoâ€™s always one step behind his preening nemesis, Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion).
The hero thwarts Dr. Horribleâ€™s schemes and courts his dulcet-voiced, do-gooder crush, Penny (Felicia Day), a sad fate the evil doctor laments via blogs
and hilarious, brokenhearted ballads.
