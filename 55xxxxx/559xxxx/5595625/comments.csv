Still though, dumbing down awesomeness this way is just eating shit through a straw. 

PeEace OUT!"
,Maoxx,2010-06-16T05:23Z,"YAAAARH! It's UNBEARABLE! Holy shitting motherfucker, some of these tracks are the most insanely pathetic ""remixes"" I've heard in my life, it's so amateurish it's cancering my brain inside out with a flaming fucking dildo.

Still, fucking props to the uploader!

Hey, does that make me insane?"
,Maoxx,2010-06-16T05:33Z,Some of the tracks: OK! Gotta look for them though.
,Maoxx,2010-06-16T05:58Z,"Ok, I take some of it back, but that may be because I'm drunk and say shit I don't remember, but some of the tracks are ok. First CD sucks ass, next one kinda ok."
,Maoxx,2010-06-16T08:31Z,"FUCK. THAT. SHIT.

All is forgiven, sorry my drunk, but god damned, some of these tracks.. Like... At least ONE, is so motherfucking god damned analraping ass-to-mouth-dangling pube licking good I'm gonna play the SHIT out of that fucker for midsummers. 

Cheers mate!"
,Jokkkk,2010-07-04T20:02Z,"Holy shit Maoxx, from your monologue it seems that you're tripping balls instead of a little tipsiness."
,MadeOfFake,2010-07-07T00:08Z,"Maoxx is havin a good time and his words make sense.
The first song SMack my Bitch Up Noiseffects or whatever was like taking it up the ass with a spikey dildo"
