Music Club. 2005 - Ian Dury, like Ray Davies and Paul Weller was a very English talent. The colorful, metropolis-inhabiting characters like Billericay Dickie or Plaistow Patricia he sung about, and the ever so cockney music hall accent he chose to sing in, were a big part of that. But mostly, it was the detailed, poetic way he cataloged English life and the melting pot of musical styles he used to do so, from punk and funk to jazz and rock'n'roll, which left no doubt that Dury's work could only come from one place: the very heart of England. So few were surprised when after his death Sir Paul McCartney, Robbie Williams, Madness and more all lined up to pay their respects with cover versions of some of his best loved songs. You'll find plenty of them here, in their original versions, culled from his entire career from the mid-'70s with pub rockers Kilburn & The High Roads through the golden years with the majestic Blockheads right up to the last studio recordings at the start of the '90s. 2 CD set is comprised of 34 tracks.
