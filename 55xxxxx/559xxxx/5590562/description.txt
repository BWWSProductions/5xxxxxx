Here are a couple of recent programs by the iconoclastic Vyzygoth from Beyond the Grassy Knoll:


Stuff and Things, No. 4 - May 21 FR
and
That Was the Week that Wasn't, No. 20 - May 24 MO


Beware.  This is visceral stuff.  Punches are not pulled and "adult language" is not beeped-out.  Contains content that may not be suitable for some listeners.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for infoabout what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:
sebaygo1_torrents_info_PLEASE-READ.txt

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
