[V],r3dcat,2010-06-02T14:13Z,A lot of forum comments suggest that this is a non-working bad dump  ...  http://gbatemp.net/t229599-wii-2053-samurai-warriors-3-europe  ...  Can anyone confirm?
,drewkrew,2011-01-22T23:46Z,"Didn't work for me with ANY usb loaders.
I assume it's an IOS-reloading game, which can't run on USB Loaders as the communication to the USB ports is lost during the IOS reload command :-(
Should work from Disc Loading tho...

Thanks!
