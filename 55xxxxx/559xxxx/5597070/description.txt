|  At age seven, Oakdale's Mystery Team was a band of kid detectives       |
|  dedicated to solving child-sized mysteries (like who put their finger   |
|  in the pie, and who stole the tricycle), and the town loved them for    |
|  it. Now they're eighteen years old, about to graduate from high school, |
|  yet they're still storming the playground to bust little kids, and the  |
|  town of Oakdale is sick to death of it.                                 |
|                                                                          |
|  When a little girl sees their sign advertising "Mysteries Solved, Ten   |
|  Cents," she asks the gang to find out who killed her parents. The Team  |
|  embarks on a mystery that takes them deep into a violent conspiracy     |
|  that sees their lives threatened, their friendship strained and tests   |
|  their claim that they're "real detectives."                             |
