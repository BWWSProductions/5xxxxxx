,garsen,2010-06-01T07:52Z,"two problems:

1. can't resize wineskin window or blow up game resolution.

2. can't get rid of mouse pointer on top of crosshairs in-game, and the mouse responds to the system speed, so gameplay is affected/slowed.

help!

(new-enough imac, up-to-date system, etc.)"

,hurukhan,2010-06-10T16:13Z,"Hello thenoobish! Apparently you have many games!
I'm looking mostly for oldies!
Can you get Alien vs Predator (the original one) for Mac OS X? I used to have the game, and I loved it, but lost the CD, eventhough I still have it installed on my computer... Can't play it without the CD :(
Also someone uploaded Majesty (another oldie) recently but it was taken off the site (eventhough I downloaded it and it didn't work..)
If you could get both those games on TPB I would be soooooooooooo grateful!!!!"
,Ianmac1,2010-06-17T01:43Z,"noobish, many thanks for uploading this torrent.

,SethAbel,2010-09-04T10:30Z,"Thanks for this large upload, but I am battling to get this game running, is there no other online resource to walk us through ? 

When I click on the app, 2 invisible icons start popping up and down, then one goes away.

I know wineskin works, because Fallout 3 GOTY worked.

But on this one, I keep getting a ""program error Wolf2.exe has encountered a serious melt down"" (;

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

- Peace
