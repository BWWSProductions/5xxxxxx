,wolfbane,2010-05-28T00:14Z,"Also works on the first torrent

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5589928/Alpha_Protocol_PC"
,AshEnke,2010-05-28T00:18Z,"on the first torrent, the language is on russian.
How do I turn it on english ?? (the localisation files are in the installation folder)"
,lampa023,2010-05-28T00:20Z,thanks..it works but it is on russioN for me...:( how can I change language
,DaniVegaz,2010-05-28T00:20Z,"Is there a way to change the language settings in a config file? And is it normal that each time you click on something some random guy says ""ugh"" ""Augh""
over and over and over again? lol"
,AshEnke,2010-05-28T00:21Z,"Found the solution : 
BaseEngine.ini in /Engine/Config
Change Language=RUS to Language=INT "
,szioul,2010-05-28T00:22Z,"BaseEngine.ini in /Engine/Config
Change Language=RUS to Language=INT"
,cos13,2010-05-28T00:28Z,ENG not INT !!!
,AshEnke,2010-05-28T00:29Z,"The game does the ""Uggh"" sound, and it goes back to the main menu after the intro video."
,Gometzler,2010-05-28T00:31Z,@AshEnke same here
,AshEnke,2010-05-28T00:33Z,"I'll take a look at the skilltree while waiting, it looks really nice =)"
,Tilatus,2010-05-28T00:39Z,"Yeah, the crack doesn't work. ""Ugh"" sounds and after intro it goes back to main menu."
,StarmanX,2010-05-28T00:39Z,I'm also having the 'ugh! agh! sound problem as well as it returning to the main menu after the intro movie.
,galggod,2010-05-28T00:39Z,"you can also use bri for british english but the ugh
and the return to main menu remain  "
,lampa023,2010-05-28T00:40Z,thanks...but when I choose difficulty ...and after that move... and nothing ...he set me back ON ...AGENT HISTORY
[V],Mbb15,2010-05-28T00:47Z,"Hmm weird that you guys having trouble... will try to install the skidrow release later, see if that works, otherwise wait for a proper."
,StarmanX,2010-05-28T01:02Z,"@Mbb15  

Then are you saying that you're using the crack with no problems? If so, which release do you have installed? I can't find a torrent for SKIDROW's release anywhere, only the crack."
[V],Mbb15,2010-05-28T01:03Z,"Full game:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5595108/Alpha_Protocol-SKIDROW-[tracker.BTARENA.org].iso"
,wolfbane,2010-05-28T01:36Z,"I used the first Russian version, changed Language=RUS to Language=ENG in BaseEngine.ini in /Engine/Config

Copied in the files from this crack and played 1 hour without any problems(except the camera but that is a problem with the game and not the crack). "
,darknessglow,2010-05-28T01:42Z,@wolfbane Seems odd then because I have the Russian version and I'm getting strange sounds when scrolling through the menu and it loops back to the beginning after the intro.
,LawiH,2010-05-28T02:01Z,"Hoi!

When I am executing APGame.exe nothing happens. Please help me.
Alpha.Protocol.CLONEDVD-ELiTE with SKIDROW crack.

OS Windows 7"
,LawiH,2010-05-28T02:18Z,"PROBLEM IS HERE! ViRUS! ViRUS! DETECTED!

28.5.2010 3:05:20	Quarantined	virus HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic	File		H:\Downloads\sr-apd-mbb\SKIDROW\Binaries\	Skidrow.DLL		

KASPERSKY!"
,darknessglow,2010-05-28T02:23Z,"@LawiH

My bet is on a false positive. People are actually getting to the game menu and its rare that a person making a virus would go through the trouble to crack the game, even partially, just to do it."
[V],Mbb15,2010-05-28T02:30Z,"@LawiH 

False-positive, turn virusscanner off"
,AgnosticWatermelon,2010-05-28T02:39Z,"*Fix with the Russian iso*

I did a reinstall and changed the ""RUS"" in the ini file into an ""ENG"" (instead of INT)"
,LawiH,2010-05-28T02:42Z,"Ok, I hope that it really was false positive, added Skidrow.dll to trusted zone.

Game works like a charm!

I am using Alpha.Protocol.CLONEDVD-ELiTE with SKIDROW crack.

Thank you!"
,darknessglow,2010-05-28T02:45Z,"@AgnosticWatermelon

Already did that. Course I had to save the ini somewhere else then move it to the folder but I did it.

Still get the grunt sounds and the game still doesn't go beyond the intro movie."
,StarmanX,2010-05-28T03:01Z,"@AgnosticWatermelon 

Is that all you did? I just tried it and it didn't work for me. "
[V],DibyaTPB,2010-05-28T03:07Z,Damn it man how can you be so fast ?? LOL just saw that you already upped this
,TrademarkTM,2010-05-28T05:13Z,Crack worked fine except I can see any of the conversation choices. anybody else having this problem?
,RMJ13,2010-05-28T07:01Z,"I just got finished testing both ""CLONE"" and"" SKIDROW"" The both Crash at the same spot trying to create game save! It cannot create the very first game save ! So it crashes! NOTHIN FIXES THIS! GAme save directional code was not put in! SO THIS GAME WILL NOT START untill a PROPER CRACK is released '

SKIDROW DROPS THE BALL AGAIN!"
,AgnosticWatermelon,2010-05-28T07:16Z,"@StarmanX

I can only think of 2 things I did differently

1-I used Revo uninstaller to fully uninstall the game

2- And I forgot to turn off norton so I ended up starting the ap.exe crack without the skidrow.dll. After it didn't load up I turned norton off and copied over skidrow.dll 


Every since then Alpha Protocol plays perfectly (no grunts and the intro doesn't dump me at the title screen). This is on windows 7 btw"
,wolfbane,2010-05-28T08:27Z,"@RMJ13/darknessglow

I'm using Windows 7 and installed to a non-standard location(ie my D partition)  and no grunt sound and I can save my game."
,AshEnke,2010-05-28T09:32Z,"@AgnosticWatermelon

So you didn't block the game in the firewall ?"
,AshEnke,2010-05-28T10:05Z,"I tried a full reinstall, every language, with or without the firewall blocking the game, still the ""Ugh"" problem"
,AshEnke,2010-05-28T10:36Z,"100% FOOL PROOF GUIDE FOR THIS SHIT TO WORK (BOTH CLONEDVD AND SKIDROW VERISONS)

1. CLEAR YOUR REG. Plenty of people have posted how. Do it. You also MUST delete the Saga folder from C:/ProgramData (Hidden folder)
2. Apply SKIDROW crack
3. Install a firewall, or use Windows Firewall, add Alpha Protocol.
4. (CLONEDVD Only) Go to /engine/config/baseengine.ini Change RUS to INT
5. Run game. Enjoy."
,Omiee,2010-05-28T12:57Z,im getting this sound problem where it says ugg all the time and wont go past the opening cynimatic
,StefanGavrila,2010-05-28T18:06Z,"After playing the game for several hours I can clearly say that this game is not worth all the hipe that it has gotten over the time. It is an above average game at best.

Even though it uses the Unreal Engine 3, it does not show it. Graphics and level design are above average, some character models (especially the common soldiers) and movement look like they have been taken from 8-10 year old game.

In the 5 levels that I played, character interaction was minimal (mostly during mission briefings) and nothing like Mass Effect as some people expected it to be.

Gameplay wise it has many problems (in my point of view at least): weapons that can only hit a target at point blank range (like the Uzi), narrow field of view, the ability to save on;y at checkpoints, very poor AI, lack of an indicator to show you how stealthy you are, nausea inducing motion blur and many more.

Hopefully the game get's better later on, but so far i'm very disappointed with how it looks and plays.

6/10 (and I think i'm being generous)"
,Isti01,2010-05-28T18:20Z,"same here AshEnke, did reinstall, changed languages, firewalll block... still that fucking Uggh.. sound -.-"
,Omiee,2010-05-28T18:37Z,i get send back to main menu after film intro and i have this ugg ugg ugg sound after each thing
,StefanGavrila,2010-05-28T22:58Z,"After playing through the Rome missions I have 2 things to say:

1. The story becomes more interesting
2. The gameplay still sucks

So i'll give it a +1 for the story..."
,siema87,2010-05-29T00:47Z,Everything works for me just fine except that I have problems in game with camera which is really choppy. It is almost unplayable as I can't aim because of that. Any1 has any idea how to fix that ?
,urbanAssault,2010-05-31T20:10Z,"if every1 skkipped the 1 delete reg step before running the game it wont work, no rneed for we-install , after having the grunt an not getting apst the intro i just clolsed trrhe game and deleted the hidden folder an the game runs fine now"
,marmellade,2010-06-12T00:44Z,"Well I am gonna post about this because I seem to be the only one getting this problem: when I copy skidrow.dll from image to folder, windows 7 freezes having to restart the PC manually. I moved the skidrow.dll into the game folder from another computer with Vista with no problem, but If I launch the cracked executable w7 still freezes. I know is still the .dll doing this. No Anti Virus active at that time, I also tried disabling windows defender, but no luck. Soooooo wierd! Anyone getting this?"
,Danne234,2010-06-12T22:47Z,"Crack works. But tryed to start the game to day and it was saying it was a virus in the .dll file. Knowing most of skidrows cracks give these false posetives, i was wondering how you can bypass the file deleter in Nod32?"
,lothos73,2010-06-20T16:00Z,"I'm struggling still with this title. ugh sounds and drop back to main menu after intro.  Yes, I've done the fool proof method. Even uninstalled and cleaned and redid from scratch again with the same problem. Using the skidrow version I even did the ini change from INT to ENG just in case."
,anonymoususer111,2010-06-23T01:15Z,"Help! When ever I try to copy and paste or drag and drop the Skidrow.dll file from the torrent to the binaries folder, it shows up in the folder for 3 seconds or so, then disappears.
I'm using Vista x64 and McAfee AV."
,sdnl1j2,2010-06-27T14:28Z,"@Cloudo9

to fix this  uninstall Nvidia PhysX then reinstall"
,roar2482,2010-07-12T17:39Z,"I cant find a C:/ProgramData at all. Um.. Still got grunt sound, cleared registry.. Installed crack with Antivirus off.. Any suggestions?"
,bbt4,2010-07-30T04:25Z,this game blows

,KimBsuH,2012-01-17T12:19Z,"Okey i tell you how i did get it work.
