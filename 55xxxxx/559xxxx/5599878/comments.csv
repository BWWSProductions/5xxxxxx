,arwan,2010-05-31T20:54Z,"I don't but I get this from the uploader

Rus DVD has been fucked the whole shit..

LJB are: 1) to join the files first, 2) then use DVDFlick to ""author"" and 3) then burn.
Manono: 1) DGIndex (joins? and demux) and 2) Muxman (reauthor) and 3) burn.
Sambat: 1) Simple DVD Creator and then 2) burn."

This DVD is working!

Guys at first deleted this files :

VIDEO_TS 8 KB
VIDEO_TS.BUP 8 KB
VTS_01_0       66 KB
VTS_01_0.BUP 66 KB

I have here the fix it video_ts and Vts,   

download ifoedit > click on created IFO's and than you get a other screen.

Click on your first VOB than ok.

and you get the full DVD with full chapters.

IFo's and bup are maked well done.

IF you have any problem p.m uk402@hotmail.com"
,Lawjon,2010-06-01T16:06Z,"done what you specified using ifoedit,
but now all subs are green en very blurry...
what went wrong?"
,arwan,2010-06-01T17:14Z,"ifo edit is the problem, is better you removed the 

VIDEO_TS 8kb
VIDEO_TS.BUP 6kb
VTS_01_0.BUP 70 kb
VTS_01_0 66kb

and download the other orignal again from the torrent, seletecd only for files.

And put them back into your DVD-file.

or else take those 4 vob's and burn them with nero...

I tried everything Quality is very good.
but it came from rus DVD.

still not succes to a DVD.

If there was a DVD-9 from USA NTSC was easy to make a NTSC format....

if you find a other solution let me now ok?"
