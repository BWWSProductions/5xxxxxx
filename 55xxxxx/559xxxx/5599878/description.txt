+ Re-coded with 3 passes


Members still claimed that all encoded DVD's were PAL.
The can't play in their DVD-player...

Subs were totally out of sync, subs were hard encoded....

This the real proper enjoyz.

Ohhhhh, yeah we did remove the menu menu was RUS design.
That was only the bad news.

We have fix subs...
- subs can be on/off

- I would not buy the orignal you will be regret it, if you do bought it, don't waste your money.

-This 1000 x miles slight better, 1000% NTSC
 Buy a few empty's DISC 4,7 GB.

-All files from PAL were all compression to format it to DVD-5.
 At first the two/three files all should be mostly 1 GB.

-CCE was claimed by DVD-rebuilder. Here is the M/CCE Proper!
 If you was not glad with your PAL DVD, replace it! Into NTSC

- Make your neightbours glad with this release!
We have added more bitrate.


The best MANUALLY ENCODED DVD-R is here.
Do not be fooled by KNOCK-OFFS. Some claim to
have manually encoded, but it was actually through
DVD-ReBuilder. THAT can be easily proven. Our release
also does NOT have duplicate frames. Consider
this to be a PROPER of others. TDBB quality here
will not be beaten by anything else that has
been released.
