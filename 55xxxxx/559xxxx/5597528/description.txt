        Since the Age of Enlightenment, the gap between the known  and
        the  unknown has  shrunk considerably.  We have  mapped every
        corner of our  planet and explored  our universe, but  despite
        this countless phenomena still remain unexplained.

        The Unexplained is a breathtaking new series from The  History
        Channel  that  probes the  mysteries  of the  world.  From the
        shocking voodoo rituals of  the Caribbean to the  secret alien
        research centre  at Area  51, from  the shadowy  doings of the
        Skull &  Bones to  terrifying vampire  myths, The  Unexplained
        will separate fact from fiction.

        Prepare yourself for a chilling journey into The Unexplained.
