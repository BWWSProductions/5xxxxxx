Daring Adventures is an album by Richard Thompson, released in 1986.

After sales of his 1985 release Across A Crowded Room had not met expectations, Thompson was under pressure from his record label to deliver with his next album.

The first Thompson album to be recorded in the USA, Daring Adventures is a marked departure from its predecessors with a slicker, more commercial sound and backing provided by American session players. It marked the start of a controversial five-album collaboration between Thompson and new producer Mitchell Froom that was regarded, in some quarters, to have "Americanised" and commercialised Thompson's style and sound. The album is variously seen as a sell-out under pressure from a record company, or as an attempt to reach a wider audience.

It also saw a shift, with songs like "A Bone Through her Nose", "Baby Talk" and "Valerie", in Thompson's songwriting away from the seemingly personal and towards the character portraits for which he has become renowned. "Al Bowlly's In Heaven" and "How Will I Ever Be Simple Again" are two of Thompson's best loved songs and concert staples, the latter also one of the more frequently covered Thompson songs.
