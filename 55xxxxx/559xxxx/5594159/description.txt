         Abu Dhabi is famous for its extreme engineering, but now      
         one project could surpass them all - the world's most         
         inclined skyscraper, Capital Gate. Capital Gate is a tower    
         that spirals out of the ground at 525 feet and tilts almost   
         five times more than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The tower     
         will include a five-star hotel on the top 18 levels, an       
         infinity pool, a restaurant hanging 300 feet above the        
          ground and a helicopter pad on the roof.
