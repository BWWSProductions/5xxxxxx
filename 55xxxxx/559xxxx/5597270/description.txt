Metamorphosis is the fourth studio album by Iron Butterfly, released in 1970. Though it did not do as well as Ball (1969), the album charted at #16 on the US charts. The album features two new members, Mike Pinera and Larry "Rhino" Reinhardt (Larry is called El Rhino on the Metamorphosis album) on guitars. The duo replaced Erik Brann, who left because of band disputes. They had a minor hit with Easy Rider (Let The Wind Pay The Way) which reached #66 on the Billboard chart. The album is noted for having one of the earliest uses of the Talk box on a rock album.
