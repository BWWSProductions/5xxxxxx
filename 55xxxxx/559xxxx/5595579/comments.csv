You having been given a green skull'n bones does not give you the priviliege to be an asshole, correct?

I can confirm that on Win7 this release will, most likely due to its age, result in a ""wrong disc"" message upon installing.

I have earlier had perfectly cracked programs go apeshit on me, due to the combination of age and Win7, so no surprise this.

Shame as I have good memories from this game."

[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2010-05-29T04:45Z,all my future uploads will have not tested on win7 in the description.
