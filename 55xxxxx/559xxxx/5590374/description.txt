This is a 1950s propaganda film produced by the Ford Motor Company to promote the suburbanization of America and with it the use of personal automobiles for all transportation. These neighborhoods of tract homes sprang up all over the US as a direct result of the GI Bill making home loans available to WWII veterans. This is an excellent film for political science class looking at the massive political and cultural change in the quarter century following WWII.
