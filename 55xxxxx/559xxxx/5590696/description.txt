==WHAT IS THIS?==

This torrent contains two lossless compressions (FLAC and Apple Lossless) of "The Great Gig in the Sky" based on HMVinyl's latest vinyl rip of Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of The Moon". These files have been processed with BIAS SoundSoap (v2.1) to remove the crackles and pops inherent in vinyl playback.


==WHY ONLY ONE SONG?==

This is simply meant as a demo of the benefit of SoundSoap in processing vinyl recordings.  My hope is that HMVinyl will be sufficiently impressed by the difference that he will make it a part of his workflow. ;-)

However, I also hope others who are interested in hi-fi rips of vinyl recordings will download and offer comment.

BTW, the audio is still not pristine. Some crackling is occasionally audible, but in quieter segments of the song (when the vinyl artifacts are most obvious) I think the quality is much improved.

If you enjoy this file, please comment.

==WHY TWO FILES?==

Mostly because playback of FLAC files using VLC on my Mac sounds like absolute shit. But also, in my experience, unless you have a special soundcard or an external DAC and a lot of expensive hi-fi equipment, the cleanest digital audio source available to most people is an iPod with a good set of headphones. FLAC doesn't play on iPods, but ALAC does.
