"Manteca" is an Afro-Cuban song by Dizzy Gillespie first released in the 1940s. It brought greater prominence to Latin and African music in jazz and pop music. Joe Cuba's "El Pito" appropriated its phrase "I'll Never Go Back to Georgia."
The song was written by Chano Pozo while playing in Gillespie's band.
