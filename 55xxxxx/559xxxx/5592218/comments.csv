[V],globeplus,2010-05-26T22:34Z,"All of you can count with a perfect work with the game absolute complete but the multiplayer that i really don´t know if it works to be downloaded on part in nice link for 130 mb withy easy integration in the main file but as usual and i can say a kind of normal always look a kind of tough to use the multiplayer but if the users think that have a shot using the multiplayer download him in a nice link probably in less than 10 minutes depending on the downloading speed and certainly will be on time before get the mainfile because is only 130 mb , i repeat perfect work , complete game with the multiplayer optional with easy integration in the main file . "

,TheRealMoot,2010-05-27T05:43Z,"Am I doing somthing wrong with FREEARC? I tell it to extract the files to a specific location and half an hour later its still at o% So what did i do wrong? Even if i tell it to take out a tiny little file instead, it never unpacks it! Can someone tell me whats up? Running WinXP if its a compatability issue."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-27T11:39Z,"TheRealMoot : ok i will explain to you the basics , you need close 1 gb ram for extraction , then some background applications can be consuming necessary ram or interfering while the extraction , so you have to do the next 2 things for safety :
1 - reeinstall the freearc (less than a minute)
2 - make the extraction again browsing the arc file , you have to like 7zip an integration factor but this time after a computer restart to evitate interferences from background applications
Happy game !!!"
,killakoop,2010-05-27T12:03Z,can any1 tell me if the xbox 360 controller is compatable with this game thnaks 
,nkm10gt,2010-05-27T12:18Z,"@ Globeplus.
Thanks for the rip. Why you people can not upload the torrent of the update? Because from the sites you given have to slow speed. And in torrent it takes less time"
[V],globeplus,2010-05-27T12:19Z,"THE CONTROLLERS GO OK I THINK AND I THE MENTIONATED CONTROLLER IS ONE OF THE MOST USED , SO I CAN´T SEE WHY NOT OK ... GIVE IT A TRY !!! 
WHAT´S IS IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A CONTROLLER WITHOUT AXIS PROBLEMS THEN IS UP TO THE GAMES PUT THE USE OF THE CONTROLLERS OK . "
[V],globeplus,2010-05-27T13:55Z,"To nkm10gt : i don´t do that because is quick in the nice link to get the update , it is only 30 mb but if someone want to do that , be my guest , for me is ok ."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-27T14:35Z,"To nkm10gt : well , i uploaed in a nice torrent the file you requested the name is :

[V],globeplus,2010-05-27T14:36Z,"Just correcting the before comment with the name of the file , it is :

BLUR EASY UPDATE - update anywhere

... now it is corrected the name of the file ."
,Cssfreak133,2010-05-27T17:16Z,so let me get this straight.. no multiplayer?
[V],globeplus,2010-05-27T18:55Z,"To cssfreak : you can read for shore , it is optional for 130 mb , no guarantee that it will work , like in any game not bought and downloaded in the torrents , you can download and try to use it , it is complete and with easy integration and can be downloaded in a nice link for 130 mb ."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-27T19:44Z,"this comment is just for saying that unfornatly we still having the same jealous guys trying to borring competent work with negative votes , i ask myself when this guys will stop beeing like this because one thing is for shore : they always make a try to don´t play fair , fo rthem is tough to repect the others work and that conception in uploading files is not good as that for shore !!!
Sorry , friendly users but my conscience tells me to say this . thank you for understanding ."

,leechgod,2010-05-27T23:14Z,hey globe can u upload at torrentbits.ro???vitality does there but his rips are double the size of urs.........
,leechgod,2010-05-27T23:19Z,and when is prince of persia forgotten sands coming.......how can i come to know that u uploaded  one of ur releases on a particular day?
[V],globeplus,2010-05-28T00:19Z,"To leechgod : the torrent you talked need registration and the game you talked is a ubisoft game probably with complicate DRM , can take time to be available with no problem "
[V],globeplus,2010-05-28T01:28Z,"Analising the work  that i did in this file i have to say that it was the correct work to put the game with a nice size with everything pratical , i think that many users out there can appreciate this type of work in the way that they get the full game anyway for a nice size with everything more nice as possible and normaly complete game no doubt , this refection have the intuit to explain that first prejudicated when a file don´t have the correct help is the users of the file and is matter to ask if this type of work can be appreciated or not in the correct way , is the users interested in see more nice pratical files in the future , because putting the files like this is hard work and when the work is prepared , i have in mind to respect the users more as possible , only working things that can be worked in a nice way , i do this type of work for hobby without wanting anything from the users and many times i only get borrings , i don´t think that users of this type of files don´t like to have the files ok , my work it is beeing always more correct as possible and even myself play the games many times with the file that go to the users .
This is just a refection from a little apreensive uploader that sometimes have the feeling that the hard work done many times not correctly recompensated with the correct help for a nice pratical file .  "
,pratik911,2010-05-28T06:59Z,pls rip and upload alpha protocol. Thx for this rip. Globe rulez.
,Nuggs,2010-05-28T08:40Z,Thanks man!
,natforce4,2010-05-28T08:49Z,Antivir reported Blur.exe as TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen trojan. It could be a false positive. Just a heads up.
,nkm10gt,2010-05-28T09:32Z,"Thanks globeplus for the easy update.
You people are the best!!"
,nkm10gt,2010-05-28T09:37Z,"@globeplus.
I have downloaded your GTA Episodes from Liberty City and follow all the instuction you have given in it or on torrent but when I start the game the menu appears but when I start the new game it hangs there. Can you tell me whats the solution of it?"
,nkm10gt,2010-05-28T09:42Z,"Globeplus.
I have downloaded your GTA Episodes from Liberty City and followed all the instructions which are given in it or on torrent. My problem is when the game start I click on start new game it hangs at there. Can you tell me the solution of it, please?"
[V],globeplus,2010-05-28T13:44Z,"this comment it is just to say that alpha protocol have a DRM uniloc that means that is a DRM not so tough maybe as the ubisoft teorically speaking but still probably not that easy and what the differences between the ubisoft DRM and the uniloc : the ubisoft DRM need a permanent online state from the player in order to make the saves , the uniloc need to be registered in the start of the use of the game , so only at that moment you need the online state then to play the game is normal offline , now if anyone ask me if can be easy or not bypass the inicial identification to play the game that i can´t answer , so maybe not so tough in theory as the ubisoft DRM but can be tricky to work anyway .
