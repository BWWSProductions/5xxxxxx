A web release from Bowers & Wilkins Music Club.

Justin Adams (Robert Plant, Jah Wobble) has been described by the Guardian as "one of the most intriguing, enthusiastic musicians in Britain" and together with Gambian griot and master of the ritti, Juldeh Camara, has recorded a follow-up to their critically acclaimed album "Soul Science" which won a BBC Radio 3 World Music Award.

Mixing up raw blues, electric guitar and African roots, the reference points for this release are recordings from the 1950s by the likes of Bo Diddley and Muddy Waters.

To acheive the rawness and slight distortion meant a live feel was very important, Justin decribes the recording process: "The way weâ€™ve gone for that is to record in a very live way in the Wooden Room at Real World Studios. Youâ€™ll hear the sweat and blood of the live performance, and all the scratchy bits!".

With all B&W Music Club albums, we try and bring you something different and very special and would love to know what you think of it.
