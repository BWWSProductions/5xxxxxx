,Abdulmumit,2010-05-29T03:19Z,"You sick bastards call this ""XVID"" quality? The guy holding the camera when screening this movie must have been totally drunk. Quality is below anything acceptable.

Stop wasting peoples time and bandwidth with such crappy torrents, stupid fucks. CALL THEM PROPERLY, include info about movie being a screened one and it will be ok. WITH BIG FUCKING LETTERS.

A: 2

This torrent is a waste of time if you want a good quality. The poster is a punk that doesn't care to warn you about ""his"" torrent being a screened one of shitty quality."
,Abdulmumit,2010-05-29T04:02Z,"It really doesn't matter, as there is simply NO INFO about the movie quality in the description of this torrent. And there should be, as the quality is crappy.

For a mysterious reason people like to know what they are about to download."
,scamius,2010-05-29T05:40Z,"A: 2 The sound isn't sinked up and there's a lot of back ground noise.  Sounds as if you're in a drive in and standing outside of your car.


V: 4 Not to bad for a cam, watchable for the most part.  A little bright.  It's also out of focus from time to time but not to often.

Didn't feel like putting up with the sound being a good 20 to 30 seconds off.
I'm going to wait for a better version of this torrent.  
Thanks for the upload and I hope it didn't sound like I was complaining.  Just trying to give a heads up."

,Niles,2010-05-30T01:02Z,"Abdul you are making a complete idiot of yourself. 

""Stop wasting peoples time and bandwidth with such crappy torrents, stupid fucks. CALL THEM PROPERLY, include info about movie being a screened one and it will be ok. WITH BIG FUCKING LETTERS.""

The torrentname is : ""Robin.Hood.2010.TS.XVID-PrisM""

The important bit being ""TS"" and it is in BIG FUKCING LETTERS you moron. It means telesync, which is basically a CAM but with a different soundsource. So not only did the uploader state that it is a CAM in the FREAKING TITLE, he also provided you with no less than 8 screenshots. 

How about you refrain from commenting untill you get a clue. Calling the uploader a ""stupid fuck"" because you don't know what the hell you are talking about is pretty embarrasing."

,bhylls,2010-06-04T13:36Z,What the hell do you want for free?---this is one of the best cams i have seen--I blew it up to DVD with convert to DVD X (get it from the bay for free ) and we watched it on a 42 inch flat screen --trust me its that good-- colour is a little wishy washy but hell most of the film is in darkness anyway - in terms of cam v9 a9 many many thanks to the uploader ----keep em comming
,minalear,2010-06-04T21:25Z,"Abdul you are a complete fucking idiot.  This is the EXACT reason why raymond released a sample with the torrent.  Download that small file instead of the full 1.39 gigs to to see if you like the quality.

If you dont, go spend 5 dollars and see it in the theaters, and GTFO."
,minalear,2010-06-05T04:33Z,"Probably not the best capture ever, at times bottom of screen gets cut off, but the audio is just ridiculously awesome.  I mean this is like i am sitting in the movies man thanks."

@ raymondhome your uploads rock and dont listen to tards like Abdulmumit keep up the good work"

,-rens-,2010-06-08T15:02Z,"Movie was a bit disappointing. We all know Robin Hood, we know why he is what he is and what he does. They take it very slowly, starting from the very beginning. They should have just jumped right in and then start taking it from there.

In cam terms:

A: 6,5
V: 7

Very watchable.
Thanks raymond."

,chico32,2010-06-11T21:38Z,"First of all, just to calm down the most fanatics; thanks for all the upload and all the work you lay down to share the goods with us!

My point of view; I cant believe people who wanna watch a movie with quality like this. Since you are so eager to see it, I guess you have been waiting for it just as long as I have. And then you go ahead and destroy the piece of art which this movie is. Amazing.
Maybe the quality even piss you off while watching it. How lame is it possible to be?
For those who dont care about quality, and never will; enjoy."

V:7

Thanks for the Upload. As for the story of the movie I didn't really find it that great of a movie. "
,guenloie,2010-06-19T11:37Z,"even if it's not watchable, thanks for the effort! 

haters should keep their comments to themselves and don't deserve the other perfect quality stuff raymondhome does have. so shhhhhsh! "

,richto,2010-06-20T23:58Z,"Another good reason not to buy the PS3, a Bluray player, or anything else made by Sony..."
,ellpee2010,2010-06-22T13:30Z,"this goes out to all tha fuck wits that sit behind a computer all day jacking off to gay internet porn sooking about not being able to get a dvd copy of a new release movie. 
if you want quality of a new release pay the $7 on a tight ass tuesday and get ur faggy ass to a cinema.
other wise keep ur mouths closed and just wait until another copy is uploaded. Its not the end of the world. Thats why we hate fucks like (abdul) crying and writing absolute shit. 

To the uploader (raymond) all your uploads are great i know i can get great dvd rips when posted. thanks
keep up the good work."

I don't speak French or Spanish (as do most of the Americans who will download this), so you've really but fucked us here. 

Excuse my French (see how I used a common expression to also sarcastically comment on your previously established idiocy), but you seriously are an asshole.
