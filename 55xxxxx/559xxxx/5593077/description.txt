PrisM Notes::::::::::::
here we go, typing in the irish accent this time :P, well, source is nothing special to be honest..some scenes are quite bright, and others not, so increased brightness a touch and lowered contrast, then changed the midtone colours, and the background colors, added a deblock filter onto it, because it seemed blocky also, ive checked through and i did'nt see any more blocky scenes...added a slight video denoise filter, and touch of sharpness not wanting to bring the blocky scenes back... also used a perspective filter on the left hand side because the video seemed stretched that side. Overall it's a nice cam easily watchable...audio is our own...filtered and synced, was not the easiest movie to sync so May go slightly out of sync but it comes back....Enjoy!

credit PrisM & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
