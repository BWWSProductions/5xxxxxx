,aerfos,2011-02-16T23:53Z,"doesnt work for me. not recognized by any player, the extension is .avi.bc! NO GOOD"
,Chuckfist,2011-09-10T08:58Z,"@aerfos - okay n00b, let me explains things on how to put 2 and 2 together. (probably doesn't matter since your message is 7 months old) I am guessing you are using Bitcomet to download this right?

Bitcomet puts the extension .bc at the end of the file whenever its download something.
BC = BitComet
When the file has FINISHED downloading, .bc is removed. If you are trying to play it, it means it HASN'T finished downloading.
If you want to watch it when it hasn't completed downloading, use VLC or make a copy of it and remove .bc (you don't need to remove .bc when playing with VLC)
Or another easy way, turn off ""add .bc extension"" under settings in BitComet. or use utorrent which is better.

And use players such as VLC and MEDIA PLAYER CLASSIC. 
So before you say its no good, learn about torrents and programs"

,hatchetninja86,2012-03-13T16:30Z,vlc is the best player to use for most media.. usually when the other players wont read it...... vlc will.. or you can also use a program that will unzip certain files as well.
