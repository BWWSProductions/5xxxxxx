,barometerrising,2011-04-20T10:11Z,"Would it be possible to seed this film for just a few hours? A couple of us started downloading about six days ago, and we have now downloaded about two-thirds of ""Rotation.""  We'd like very much to get the rest of it. We'd be very grateful."
,barometerrising,2011-04-20T11:41Z,Seeding seems to have started again. Many thanks. I hope seeding goes on long enough - another day or so - for those of us who have reached almost 70% to get the rest of the film. It looks like it's a film really worth watching.
,barometerrising,2011-04-21T11:18Z,"Thank you for seeding yesterday, even for a few hours. That allowed us to get up to around 73.5% of this film. The download speed was pretty slow, however, because there are so few seeders and leechers, so it may take another 24 hours or so to get the rest of this file. It would be great if someone could seed it for that long. Those of us who want to watch this film would be really grateful. (Normally a download speed of between 300 to 400 kB/s is possible, but with this file only between 2 and 5 kB/s.)"
,barometerrising,2011-04-22T10:39Z,"Many, many thanks for continuing to seed this film. We've got about 85% now, and at a rate of between 5 and 10kB/s it should take two or three more hours to get the complete film. We hope the seeding can continue until then. Again, many thanks."
,barometerrising,2011-04-22T15:33Z,"Okay, we've got 99% of the film. 700 out of 706 MB. Getting to 99% took longer than expected. It would be great if seeding could go on for just a little while longer so that we could get the rest of the film and start seeding ourselves."
