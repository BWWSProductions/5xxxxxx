    Game Notes:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Akimbo chronicles the tale of the titular Kung-Fu hero of the same name,
    who enjoys a life of peaceful contemplation until a note in a bottle
    washes up on the shore of his beachfront home. The note summons him to
    Turtle Island, where an evil dragon named Fang is wreaking havoc. It
    seems that Fang has used dark magic to enslave the peaceful inhabitants
    of the island, bending their wills to his own. The twenty shamans that
    call Turtle Island home are the only ones unaffected by Fang's spell,
    and have gone into hiding. Akimbo must journey through six different
    sections of the island, collecting the pieces of another magical spell --
    one that can defeat Fang and return peace to Turtle Island.

    Though liberating the hypnotized populace of Turtle Island may seem a
    daunting task, Akimbo is a master of Kung-Fu in addition to being 
    exceptionally agile. He has several fighting moves, ranging from a simple
    punch or kick, to a roundhouse or a double back flip. Despite these 
    formidable offensive capabilities, Akimbo is rather fragile, only able
    to withstand one hit from his foes. As with many of the great platform
    heroes, he is better off avoiding enemies using his leaping talents. If
    the worst should happen, however, Akimbo receives three lives per game,
    represented by vials filled with red liquid. He also has limited stamina,
    which is used up as he delivers his martial arts maneuvers. Akimbo can
    stay in good shape by collecting various food items such as apples,
    bananas, and cherries, that are found scattered throughout the levels
    he'll progress through. 

    Our hero's impressive abilities can also be augmented with a variety
    of powerups found on the island, hidden in chests or in plain view.
    These include weapons, such as the katana sword, throwing stars, and
    exploding vials; while other powerups grant Akimbo special powers such
    as flight or the ability to somersault in mid-jump, adding height to his
    leap. In addition to these items, Akimbo can collect gold doubloons, one
    hundred of which will reward him with an extra life. Players will also
    encounter friendly animals that will aid them in their travels by
    helping to overcome obstacles. For example, in an early stage, Akimbo
    will come across a pit of deadly spikes. In order to pass them, he must
    awaken his turtle friend Bobby Bump, who will then carry him across.
    The aid of these items and animal companions is invaluable as Akimbo
    explores the vast landscape of the island.
