Wikipedia - To coincide with his new autobiography, Complete Clapton  is a two-disc career-spanning compilation for rock artist Eric Clapton, released on October 9, 2007. As with The Rolling Stones' Forty Licks, each disc has been compiled by different record companies: disc one, virtually identical to The Cream of Clapton by Polydor, and disc two by Warner Bros. Records. The compilation debuted at number 14 on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 45,000 copies in its first week.
