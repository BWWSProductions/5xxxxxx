IMAGiNE NOTES
First off many thanks to ELEKTRI4KA for the video source and PrisM for the line audio... Thanks both :)
We know this is a bit late, but we wanted to release this to those that may be waiting on it :P
Just a quick note on this... This is an okay video source, it has some spots that are dark and light so be warned.
Audio is nice so did not need to do anything but fix the sync issues with it. It lasted for around 1:45 minutes.
Also had to change the AR from 2.2:1 to 2.35:1

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
