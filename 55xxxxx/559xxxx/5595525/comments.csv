,ownage9999,2010-05-28T15:31Z,"the only comments are about leechers... keep in mind you're one of them.
i doubt any seeder here.. actually complains about them.
i bet the only ones that complain about seeders.. are actually the leechers, who end up not seeding, and complaining about them not getting it within a few minutes.
how bout u guys go fuck off and pay for a dedicated upload instead of complaining, just wasting bandwidth."

,Neversin,2010-05-29T09:02Z,"Sweet, been lookin' for a watchable copy of this for a while now ^^

So glad I had raymondhome's page Bookmarked lol, he uploads some good stuff and for some reason thepiratebay's search isn't showing up a lot of the stuff... this torrent for example. The latest torrent that shows up when I search for Robin Hood is from the 24th... anyone have any clue why? o.O"

Slightly shaky in the beginning. Periodically too dark. Subtitles aren't in English, but they are very sparse and you don't miss much. It's a watchable copy, overall. If you haven't seen it before, you probably will want to see it in the theater first. It's a cam. Enough said."
,maximus25574,2010-06-13T17:06Z,"thanx,to all those tho who slate the torrents.either put up or shut up!! these guys provide a service and deserve a bit o grattitude.cheers again."
,Beast_Rider,2010-07-14T04:45Z,These cams are pointless why waste the time uploading them theres like 30 of the same shitty quality cams i think people do it just so they can put their name on it and think theyre cool... well your not. Just stupid
