,ninline,2011-03-15T13:56Z,I don't get what problems people have with rar's.  It's .wmv files that usually give problems.  Half the one's I have dl'ed here are encrypted.  Usually rar's are used on usenet along with pars to ensure a complete download.  While pointless in a torrent they don't cause problems.
