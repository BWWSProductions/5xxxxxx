,mechula_2006,2010-08-17T03:31Z,"So far it's the best copy I've been able to find...audio cut out for the first minute when playback with Windows Media Player, DivX Plus, and Power DVD...so I don't think it's the player.  I think someone forgot to turn on the audio in the beginning.  Not a bad cam version though.  I'd give it a A:6 and V:8"
