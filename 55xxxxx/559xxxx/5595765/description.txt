Kim Kadarshian has been knocked off the top spot, as sales of Kendra Wilkinson's sex tape beat Kadarshianâ€™s.

Wilkinson's sex tape features her with boyfriend Justin Frye, and has become a hit even before its release - with pre-order figures completely overshadowing the raunchy film sold by the model-and-party girl, reports News.com.au.

Both videos have been released through pornographic video company Vivid Entertainment.

While Justin was paid 100,000 dollars for the X-rated movie, Kendra is to receive up to 50 per cent of the profits made from sales.

Wilkinson had initially tried to block the release, but after realizing that she could rake in a lot of moolah, she entered into negotiations with the video company.

The 24-year-old star, who is married to American footballer Hank Basket and has a five-month-old son Hank Baskett IV with him, started dating Justin in high school, but split from him shortly before she embarked on a relationship with Hugh Hefner and moved into the Playboy Mansion
