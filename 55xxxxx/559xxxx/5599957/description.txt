From Wiki


Belinda Jo Carlisle (born August 17, 1958) is a Grammy Award-nominated American singer. After beginning her career as a drummer or backup singer for some Los Angeles music groups, she achieved international recognition in the early 80s as lead singer of the new wave group The Go-Go's. The Go-Go's made history as the first all-woman band that both entirerly wrote their own songs and played their own instruments to top the Billboard album charts.[1]

In 1985 the group disbanded and she started a successful solo career. Her first solo single "Mad About You" (1986) reached the top three in the U.S. and topped the Canadian chart. In 1987 Carlisle started working with producer and songwriter Rick Nowles and she changed her music and public image to a more mature style. Her most successful single to date, "Heaven Is a Place on Earth" (1987), reached the number one position in several countries among which the U.S. and the U.K..

After the 80s her career started to decline but she returned to prominence in 1996 with the Album "A Woman and A Man" that spawned two top 10 singles in the U.K.. In 2001 she rejoined the Go-Go's and since then she has been touring regularly either with them or alone.

So far Belinda Carlisle has released four studio albums (and eleven singles) with the Go-Go's and seven studio albums (and thirty-one singles) as a solo artist.
