R.I.P. Ronnie James Dio


This is the Fresno 83' show. Not to be confused with the Santa Monica Show earlier in 83'. This has really good sound quality and top notch performance. It's the best overall quality Holy Diver show I've heard! All thanks goes to a guy known as Hard2Handell (H2H). He is the original uploader on another site. Enjoy.
