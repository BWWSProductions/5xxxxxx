Hi lilars.

Your suggestion made me thinking: why not?
Now, I came up with following text (I'm not quite good right now and probably my English need more corrections - feel free):
------------------------------------------------------------

Somebody logged-in under my screen-name ""twentyforty"".
He uploaded two torrents in two weeks using my account.
Now, he obviously have changed my password.
Now that pink skull doesn't mean ""Trusted uploader"". It's a joke.
I never have logged out. By simple logic no site would allow log-in if specific user-space (screen-name) is occupied.
BUT anyone who log-in just once, under your user-name CAN change one's password
(pretending to be you he simple do ""Old/New password"" swap.
And - you DON'T know the new one, right?
Last night (GMT TZ) he has uploaded third torrent using my account - ""Movavi.Converter v.8.0"" from 178.32.78.153 (ovh.net)
That torrent was deleted by someone else, not by myself. 
My regular visitor (sanyam) informed me about and made a screen-shot.

Now - I cannot log-in, write something, inform people, nor upload.
Beauty of TPB is: no one is there, IRC works in bot-mode, forum is down,
password retrieval mechanism is broken too.
Please, please: HELP ME.
