,KickassWashingMachine,2010-05-29T16:25Z,"Definitely not a good movie, but like me you're probably not expecting that anyway. It's got heart though, and it clearly wants to be a movie, there's humor and honesty along with the obligatory blood and gore. Likeable personas, too, which really matters a lot, so all in all worth watching, if you're into this kind of filth ;)

Quality-wise this is pretty OK for the size, on par with the upper half of standard 700MB rips out there, but the audio is a tad out of sync, you'll want to delay it by about 500 msecs.

Thanks for the up!"
