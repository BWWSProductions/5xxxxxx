,xXExcaliburXx,2010-10-02T12:22Z,thanks been looking for this for awhile 
,sillykumquat,2010-10-08T06:45Z,"Great, thanks! This made my day at school even more superb."
,KevanGC,2010-11-20T11:15Z,"This isn't the album. It has different tracks then the original album, and the tracks are mixed up.

It's low quality anyway, so don't bother with it. Get another torrent."
,bleach622,2010-11-23T04:43Z,"@KevanGC
read the title dumba$$... this is the US release... it has some different songs and in different order than the UK release"
,ThaPyratBay,2011-02-20T16:53Z,"Just 'cause it's the ""wrong"" torrent for you, ""KevanGC"", doesn't mean it's not the ""right"" torrent for us. Don't post something completely ludicrous."
,iAaronHD,2011-04-28T08:41Z,Thanks! Right on time so I'll have this to listen to while taking my final exams.
