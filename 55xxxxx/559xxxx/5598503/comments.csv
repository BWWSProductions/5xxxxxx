,anakinattack30,2010-06-10T09:30Z,4th time i have downloaded this from different sources. I can confirm this movie is cut. Scream 1. The scene where tatums arm is slashed in the garage has been removed.Scene at( the beggining where casey is stabbed and lying on the ground. (killer throttles her neck) then she kicks him off. removed. And at the end the stabbing scenes removed. Uk boxset has all these scenes in it.looks like i will have to wait and hope the uk blu-ray set hasent been edited. Anyways great video/audio 10/10

,hahahafr,2011-08-07T17:26Z,why the nfo says runtime: 111min then? 111min is the uncut version.
,Tygoger,2011-08-16T00:39Z,"Thanks for the up, great quallity.

But in Scream even little cuts are made. Like when Randy gets the phonecall at the party:

Listen up. They found Principal Himbry dead.

and all this is cut ""He was gutted and hung from the goal post on the football field.
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go over there before they pry him down!"""
