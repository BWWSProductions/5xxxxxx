But why is this in 50 rar files? it is already compressed, putting it in a rar archive doesn't make it noticably smaller, and just means I need two copies of it on my hard drive it if want to keep seeding (one in rar, one extracted to watch..). stupid. you'd probably get more seeders if it was just a video file."
