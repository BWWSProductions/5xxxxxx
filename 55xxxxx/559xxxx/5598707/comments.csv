,Miika270,2010-06-11T18:24Z,How is this game supposed to be installed?
[V],Subzero!,2010-06-16T08:31Z,"unrar and play, no install, no extra software needed"
,Miika270,2010-06-18T21:42Z,But theres no file to run it with!
,Miika270,2010-06-18T21:45Z,Or nothing to unrar...
,LucifersWrath,2010-06-23T12:44Z,i didnt get any unzip folder either just a bunch of loose files that i cant do anything with
[V],Subzero!,2010-06-26T04:13Z,"is it really that hard to read this file

/teamTPTB.txt

which is included in this download, hell..."
,Miika270,2010-06-26T19:19Z,"There is no use for directions like ""Extract with 7zip or equivalent"" If thereÂ´s nothing to extract."
,Miika270,2010-06-26T19:22Z,ThereÂ´s just a picture the TXT file an NFO file and 8 split files. None of those is very useful.
,lozza_dearnley,2010-10-05T01:36Z,"Use a program like 7 zip to extract the TiltedMill.7z.001 file, it will automatically unzip all the 8 numbered files. Then open up the 'Tiled Mill' file you have just made, open up the 'Hinterland' file and press the 'Hinterland' program (make sure its the program and not the same-titled icon. It worked fine for me."
,Zeozaas,2010-10-16T18:54Z,Works perfectly...thanks :) too bad its got -29 quality...too many people dont know how to install things >.
,rosebutt,2010-12-05T11:01Z,"Game worked fine, using hinterland.exe
Too bad that after running load.bat the game doesnt work anymore and a window with useless (and apparently overrated) tptb s**t opens :/ 
After removing files and unzipping again: game doesnt work anymore.Thank you very much :("
,Livor,2011-07-07T11:00Z,"Had problems opening the file with both winRAR and 7zip, both programs said it was corrupt or otherwise invalid. Tried opening with winmount and it worked perfectly"
,BlaargHonk,2011-07-17T05:39Z,"Whatever happened to the good ole days when people uploaded things in a common format, like winRAR? I've used half a dozen programs on this and all fail. YOU fail. Try resubmitting with a non-stupid format"
[V],Subzero!,2011-07-18T01:39Z,"@BlaargHonk 

i'm oldschooler as well dude, i know from whatcha talking about, but hey, there comes a time in life where you need better appz to crunch games, so i suggest to download 7zip v.9.20 at 7zip . org and be happy. btw. winrar is out since years!."
,Kamianbu,2011-07-30T03:07Z,"...it's sad when people complain 'without' reading the provided readme or nfo file.

Your torrents are usually rips, so may I ask what has been ripped out of this?
I'm still downloading so I haven't got the chance to look at the nfo."
,Kamianbu,2011-07-30T22:36Z,Nevermind. it already finished and I read the little readme :p
,Zylak,2011-10-07T08:51Z,"Working fine, after a few mins figuring how to operate with no rars. :) 
If you dont have 7z920 ( I didnt have it :P ) you can download it, its free to use.
