,libertaswv,2010-05-28T21:15Z,"generally, sync issues drive me insane....i can't ignore them. This one though, isn't too bad....There IS a bit of a problem, but it (probably) won't be too terribly distracting for most people. Shame it isn't perfect, but it's close.

 Quality otherwise is what you would expect from FxG. A/V/Subs....All good.

Thx guys - much appreciated."

Thanks for this, we enjoyed the movie. 
Good Visuals, Audio & Sync.
For the guys with sync issues I converted & burnt with ConvertXtoDVD4.
Thanks to Seeds & Peers too."
