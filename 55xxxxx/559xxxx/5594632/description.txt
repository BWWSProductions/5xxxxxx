Vapor Drawings (1983) is the debut solo album by the American trumpeter/synthesist Mark Isham.

It was the first album released on the Windham Hill label to belong to the electronic music genre. This album focuses more on Ishamâ€™s talents as an electronic composer than future releases. â€œSomething Nice for My Dogâ€ is purely electronic and â€œMen Before the Mirrorâ€ only features a brief segment of trumpet at the beginning.

The tone of the album ranges from sweeping and melancholy (â€œOn the Threshold of Libertyâ€, â€œIn the Blue Distanceâ€) to light and humorous (â€œSomething Nice for My Dogâ€, â€œMr. Motoâ€™s Penguinâ€).

The most experimental piece on the album is â€œSympathy and Acknowledgementâ€, the full title of the song being "Thank you for your Sympathy and Acknowledgement of my Disease". This piece is centered around a complex arrangement of electronic sequences and processed trumpet and piano recordings.

The most famous piece on the album is a military-style march titled â€œOn the Threshold of Libertyâ€. Over the years this piece has appeared on several Windham Hill samplers. A reworking of this piece was used as the theme of the 2000 film Rules of Engagement starring Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones. â€œOn the Threshold of Libertyâ€ takes its title from a 1929 painting by the Belgian surrealist RenÃ© Magritte.

All instrumentation was performed by Isham except additional electronic percussion and snare drum by former Group 87 drummer Peter Van Hooke.
