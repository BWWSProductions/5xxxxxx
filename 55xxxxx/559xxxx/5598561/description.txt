Totsi, which translates to "Thug", is the name of the title & main character in Gavin Hoods breakout film about the coming-of-age story of a young black South African boy trying to survive it in the slums of Johannesburg. 

Hood started out making educational films for the South African government but has since moved into the realm of the feature film, and with this film, was showered with awards: from Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards, to the People's Choice Award at TIFF and the Audience Award at the Edinburgh Film Fest...to name a few.

We follow Tsotsi and his rag-tag crew of petty thugs as they wreak havoc in the city, using crime as a means of subsitence. His crew consists of Butcher, an ice-pick happy psychopath; Aap, Tsotsi's childhood friend who'd do anything for him; and Boston, a former teacher become alcoholic. They hang out at a local pub where the beers are cheap and credit is good, run by a kind well-to-do woman.

We follow them on their daily tasks which includes, strolling around the city, playing a little dice, and of course robbing and murdering an eldery 'Sape' on a crowded subway train. As the evening progresses Tsotsi makes a decision that will change his life. He stakes out a residence in a wealthy neighbourhood, gun in hand and waits. When a car arrives and waits for the electric gate to open, he jumps out of the bushes, holds it up, throws the woman out and speeds off. A minute later he hears a cry from the backseat....only to realize he's just kidnapped a baby!

Totsi panics, and seeing as he did this job alone, he decides he will take the baby back to his house and keep it there, in a box, hidden. After a day or two he realizes that he has no idea how to take care of a baby, and a change starts to occur. He forms an emotional attachment with the baby and starts to care...

But the streets is all he knows. So he figures he will put the baby in a bag, and walk around till he finds a single woman whom he directs at gunpoint back to her house, and forces her to take care of the baby along with her own. 

This continues for some time, as we also follow the family of the baby- a local politician- and their attempts to find their son. We watch Tsotsi transform from an egocentric petty thug to an emotionally connected and compassionate person. The film truely shows us how a single choice you make can lighten your heart and change your character. A warming film with an edge, that will surely satisfy your viewing pleasure.
