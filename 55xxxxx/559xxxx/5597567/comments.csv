,marmellade,2010-06-12T00:44Z,"Well I am gonna post about this because I seem to be the only one getting this problem: when I copy skidrow.dll from image to folder, windows 7 freezes having to restart the PC manually. I moved the skidrow.dll into the game folder from another computer with Vista with no problem, but If I launch the cracked executable w7 still freezes. I know is still the .dll doing this. No Anti Virus active at that time, I also tried disabling windows defender, but no luck. Soooooo wierd! Anyone getting this?"
,sauerkraus,2010-06-17T09:18Z,"Who is this 13 year old RMJ guy? he's like a retarded homophobe. Is that even possible?

But on topic, this crackfix works great."
,hexrei,2011-06-21T21:34Z,"marmellade, that can't be caused by the .dll, as the .dll is not in any way being put into use by your system simply by moving it from one location to another. that's something larger wrong with your OS."
