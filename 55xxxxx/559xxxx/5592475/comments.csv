,rizla12,2010-07-20T14:03Z,"Thanks for this.

Are there any other good performances of his symphonies, besides Ashkenazy? Although I think he does a superb job, I am sort of an audiofile and would like to have a modern recording with clearer audio (and in flac format or other lossless).

Any tips?"
,rizla12,2010-07-20T16:16Z,"Just had to say this is a really great torrent, it?s gonna take me years to listen to this catalouge, thank you so much :)"
,rizla12,2010-07-20T16:21Z,"Although, listening to Horensteins conduction makes me realize how excellent the Ashkenazy & Previn performance is :)"
,Hopf,2010-07-25T08:11Z,"Did you mean concertos?

The library at my school has two modern recordings which may be of interest:

Nakamatsu/Seaman on the 3rd/Paganini Rhap.
Trpceski/Petrenko on the 2nd/3rd.

I will check these out on Monday and upload them if they are worthwhile performances"
,tight384,2010-08-13T19:29Z,"Excellent, excellent collection. Great copy as well. Thank you very much for this. I plan on checking out your other Classical Music torrents. Again, thank you very much."
,PeterHell,2010-11-27T23:46Z,"Fourteen Song Op. 34 has a lot of pops in it
It's so beautiful but kinda spoiled by the pops :(

There are some pops in Isle of Dead too"
,Hopf,2010-12-08T01:20Z,"Oops, the 3cd orchestral set with Jansons was a bad rip. I will re-upload that set. Thanks"
,Hopf,2010-12-08T01:35Z,"Here are the fixed versions of the bad files.

,Sus7,2011-03-17T22:39Z,"Nice work. One thing bugs me though, why did you use different recordings from different orchestras for e.g. the second Piano Concerto? Because you like this particular ones the most? Regards"
,Thorwick,2011-04-25T15:46Z,Thank you so much! Great performances!
,john4815,2011-07-24T19:10Z,Thank you!! Will seed forever
