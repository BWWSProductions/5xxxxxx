you will upload any old garbage from other sites,
do a search first"
[T],thelad53,2010-05-30T14:10Z,"........not sure if its escaped you, but the search function has been dodgy at best for quite some time, as the thread in suprbay states.

One mans garbage is another mans gold."
[T],johnnyrep,2010-05-30T14:28Z,"i found that link in 10 seconds,you couldn't be bothered"
[T],thelad53,2010-05-30T15:08Z,"Johnny you woke up on the wrong side of bed mate, your link works fine, but it doesnt show up in search for me. 

Not really why you want to come on here and call me a liar and trash my torrents, but each to there own."
