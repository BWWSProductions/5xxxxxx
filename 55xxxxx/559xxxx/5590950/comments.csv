,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-05-26T12:03Z,why y dont add more audio and more subs?
[V],BOZX,2010-05-26T12:20Z,u can always search for subs
,badboy420,2010-05-27T16:52Z,"Original Bluray contains only English and french audio channels.

Obviously watching in French will sound more like dubbing.

@LAMBORGHINI38
Adding extra audio tracks increases file size that makes it difficult.

Be happy that its released in the best quality as possible.
for extra subs just visit 
www.subscene.com 
or google it up for lots of multi language subs"
