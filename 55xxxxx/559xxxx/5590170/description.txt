Harry Potter is a seemingly ordinary boy, living with his negligent relatives,
the Dursleys. On his eleventh birthday, Harry learns from a mysterious
stranger, Rubeus Hagrid, that he is actually a wizard, famous in the
Wizarding World for surviving an attack by the evil Lord Voldemort when
Harry was only one year old. Voldemort killed Harry's parents, but his attack
on Harry rebounded, leaving only a lightning-bolt scar on Harry's forehead
and rendering Voldemort powerless. Hagrid reveals to Harry that he has
been invited to begin attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
