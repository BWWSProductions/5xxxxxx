Sonic Syndicate - Revolution, Baby


Yet another great song by Sonic Syndicate!
This is the single released to promote their upcoming album "We Rule The Night" which have a release date in August 2010. Cannot wait! :D

This file is a rip from the bands myspace page, so the quality isn't the best.

Enjoy!
