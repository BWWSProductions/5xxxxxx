Visual C# 2010 Recipes Problem, yadda, yadda, yadda...

As usual, if you like/use the book buy it. 

I have a library full of Wrox/Apress/O'Reilly books, but I hate paying for the fucking thing twice (hard copy + pdf).


I compressed this with rar because it means you can download it and seed it faster (9mb to 6mb) plus it's got 2% recovery should it get corrupted.

Oh, I don't seed this forever so help a brother out. The only thing I keep seeding is VS 1.0 for the other nostalgia freaks.

Ciao :)
