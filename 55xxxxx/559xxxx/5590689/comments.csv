,hey4769,2010-10-05T08:31Z,"How do I get the sinhala subtitles to display? When I play the movie, it only shows some squares as the subtitles(.str file that came with it). Do I need to install some special type of font first or something? Thanks."

Sinhala subtitles are in Sinhala Unicode. 
Unicode should be installed and the media player/subtitle handler should support Unicode. 
VLC doe not support Sinhala. Media Player Classic, Jet Audio and even Windows Media Player support if you have installed VobSub or K-Lite codec pack.
