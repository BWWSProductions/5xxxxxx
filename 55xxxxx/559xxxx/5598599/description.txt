Synopsis
Winston Watson chronicled his incredible 5-year journey with Bob Dylan in daily personal diaries and in home video footage with his Video 8 camera. Now Watson shares it all in a never-before-told insider account, revealing behind-the-scenes details of the thrilling and challenging journey as drummer for the legendary Bob Dylan.

A skilled storyteller, Watson paints an intimate, insider portrait of the inner-workings of Bob Dylan's band, life on tour, and the mercurial and brilliant Bob Dylan himself. Watson lived a 'rock and roll dream' - as celebrity guests joined Dylan on stage, including Bruce Springstein, George Harrison, Neil Young, The Rolling Stones, Santana, and The Grateful Dead - though Van Morrison's appearances would prove fatal to the journey of the unknown drummer from Arizona. From his amazing story of joining Dylan's band, to the rehearsals, the stadiums, MTV Unplugged, and Woodstock '94 - to the hardship of family separation - Watson holds nothing back as he invites you along on his incredible journey through continent after continent as a warrior in Bob Dylan's 'Never Ending Band'.
