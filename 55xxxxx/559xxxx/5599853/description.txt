DRM-free, properly indexed e-book (PDF, not scanned or OCR'ed)

This used to be a DRM'ed e-book, but I stripped the DRM and provided this version for other people because I don't want to own an e-reader for every webshop I buy from.  Nor do I much appreciate the possibility for the webshop to be able to revoke my book at a later time.

In short DRM sucks: http://www.defectivebydesign.org/
Thus I fixed what was wrong "by design" with this particular PDF.

Either way, if you like the book, buy it (e-book or paper).  The author deserves it.  This torrent is intended only as a convenience for those who don't want to go through the hassle of stripping the DRM themselves.
