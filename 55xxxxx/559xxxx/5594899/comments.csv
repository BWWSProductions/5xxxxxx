[V],r3dcat,2010-06-02T14:10Z,A lot of forum comments suggest that this is a non-working bad dump  ...  http://gbatemp.net/t229599-wii-2053-samurai-warriors-3-europe  ...  Can anyone confirm?
,blfc,2011-04-21T20:18Z,"I confirm it is a bad dump. To load this one you need to force-pal-50, 002 fix, ios 223-mload but it still freezes after selecting save data file. Without these options you got black screen after loading. Not usable anyway, so I will try zer0 dump instead (read it is a proper dump)"
