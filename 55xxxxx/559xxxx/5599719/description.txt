Breach was created in 2005 by Bob Harras (Avengers) and Marcos Martin (Amazing Spider-Man) and was originally intended to be a modern reboot of Captain Atom, until management at DC decided not to revise the character, who was last rebooted during the late 1980s.  With the development of Breach already underway, the decision was made to partially rewrite the plot and characters and create a brand new superhero. Evidence of the change remains in the first issue, where the protagonist, Major Zanetti, is called "Major Adams" twice.

The series is centered on a US Army Major named Tim Zanetti, who gains superpowers in a scientific experiment gone wrong. Breach was cancelled by DC and the eleventh and final issue was released in November 2005.

The Infinite Crisis limited series revealed that if the Multiverse had survived up to the present, Zanetti would have been a native of Earth-Eight as its version of Captain Atom.  In Adventure Comics vol. 2 #'s 4-5, Breach is reanimated into a Black Lantern along with the other heroes killed by Superboy-Prime in Infinite Crisis.  In Superman's Pal: Jimmy Olsen Special #2 Tim Zanetti Jr., son of Tim Zanetti, joins the military-funded Project 7734, aptly named Project Breach, under the command of General Sam Lane.
