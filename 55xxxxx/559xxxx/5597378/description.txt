Mark Erelli - Little Vigils (2010)


Mark Erelli (born 1974) is an American folk singer/songwriter from Reading, Massachusetts. He currently resides in Massachusetts. Erelli is a 1996 graduate of Bates College, where he majored in Biology, and holds a Master's Degree in Molecular Biology from the University of Massachusetts (UMass).

Erelli was discovered in 1997 by Mark Thayer of Signature Sounds at the Northeastern Regional Folk Alliance Conference after an artist pulled Mark into a Signature Sounds open jam.




"This record really explores the notion of 'scale,'" Erelli muses, "these are intimate and detailed songs about bigger, more universal things." While life endures on a grand scale, the details are ephemeral and we can miss them if we are not paying attention. Likewise, we can lose touch with parts of ourselves we take for granted. A rich life, as Erelli reminds us with LITTLE VIGILS, is one in which we are fully engaged, bearing witness to the little details that might otherwise slip away, unnoticed and unappreciated.
