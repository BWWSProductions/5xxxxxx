The Dangerous World Tour was the second world concert tour by Michael Jackson as a solo artist, covering Europe, South America, Mexico and Asia from June 27, 1992 to November 11, 1993. The tour, sponsored by Pepsi-Cola, who also sponsored Jackson's previous tour, included 69 concerts to 3.9 million fans. The tour grossed up approximately $125 million and all profits were donated to various charities including the new Heal the World Foundation that was set up by Jackson.
During the tour's third leg in 1993, Jackson decided to end the tour due to, as he announced, illness which ultimately resulted in hospitalization. Jackson had become dependent on painkillers and suffered from dehydration, migraines, back aches, frequent ankle injuries and stress following the child molestation charges made against him.
