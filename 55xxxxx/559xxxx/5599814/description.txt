Richard Thompson...Hand of Kindness(1983)[FLAC]

Hand Of Kindness is an album by Richard Thompson recorded and released in 1983.After the "Tour From Hell" to
promote Shoot Out The Lights Richard Thompson resumed a solo career as a recording and performing artist.Hand Of Kindness is a distinct departure from the albums that preceded it. Thompson biographer Patrick Humphries
observed that with this album Thompson "left the darkness behind him and walked out into the light". This is one of the
most straight forward and up tempo rock albums in the Thompson catalog. The mood is generally exuberant and Thompson's
vocals and particularly his guitar playing are confident and extrovert. The one exception is the very dark and
melancholy "Devonside", a track which Thompson rarely plays live, occasionally joking that he doesn't want to depress
the audience.Several songs feature the dual saxophones of Pete Zorn and Pete Thomas, and for about 18 months
after the release of Hand Of Kindness Thompson toured with his "Big Band" that featured the two sax players
prominently.The album opens with "Tear Stained Letter", which was later a Top Ten hit on the country music
charts when Jo-El Sonnier recorded it on his 1987 album Come On Joe. A second country music cover of this song was later
recorded by Patty Loveless on her 1997 album The Trouble with the Truth.Track listingAll songs written
