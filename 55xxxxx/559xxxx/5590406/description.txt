Highway to Heaven is an American television drama series which ran on NBC from 1984 to 1989. It consisted of 111 episodes produced over five seasons. The footage of Jonathan walking before being picked up by Mark was filmed in Tucson and along Soledad Canyon Road near Acton, CA. The theme tune for Highway to Heaven was performed by David Rose.

It starred Michael Landon as Jonathan Smith, an angel sent down to earth "on probation", and his human companion Mark Gordon, played by Victor French. Jonathan and Mark are given "assignments" by "The Boss" (God) where they are required to use their humanity (and sometimes a little bit of "The Stuff") in order to help various troubled souls to overcome their problems. 

While dealing with situations with sensitivity, Highway to Heaven also used humor â€“ particularly between Jonathan and Mark, who would often goad each other. Jonathan's mission on Earth was to do enough good so that he could 'earn his wings' and presumably, ascend to heaven. Due to the close relationship that builds between Jonathan and Mark, this becomes a contentious issue as Mark doesn't want to lose his friend to "The Boss", and sometimes tries to prevent it from happening.

I'm still waiting for the 4th & 5th season. So I'm giving you what I have for now.
