,shango,2010-05-27T18:30Z,This is one of the best scifi movies of all time. I love the monkey. I saw this movie one night at like 2am years ago and instantly fell in love. It wasnt on dvd back then. I have a copy now and thanks for sharing this movie with others.
,HaremScarem1990,2010-05-28T08:09Z,Thanks a lot for your torrents man! Do you think you could possibly re-upload Run (1991)? I've been looking for that movie for a while...
[T],minOdroL,2010-05-28T09:39Z,"Good to see that my uploads are appreciated. Thanks for your comments guys :)

HaremScarem1990: No worries, will re-upload Run after this torrent is fully seeded. :) I too had been looking for it for quite a while before I bought it. "
,famemon78,2010-05-29T16:19Z,MinOdrol while other people were putting in their requests i figured i ll pitch mine too :-).. any chance of getting a reseed on This Sporting Life? just Disc 1 the movie would be good enough for me and it doesnt have to be uncut DVD 9 you can even compress it to DVD 5 .. Thanks ever so much again!
