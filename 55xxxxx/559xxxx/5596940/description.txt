This is a classic in the West African popular music genre, perhaps because of its defiance of "pop." Baaba Maal has become famous as one of the great popularizers of Senegalese music, with big productions and illustrious stars peppering his records. But Baayo was a major change, as he dug deep into the roots of the music and came out with a deeply moving, sonically gorgeous acoustic recording. The interplay of the guitar between Maal and longtime compatriot Mansour Seck is rich and clear. Other acoustic strings and percussion lend it warmth and depth, and a very light touch on the synthesizers enhances a few tracks by remaining almost unnoticeable. Not since the now historic Djam Leelii (a set of guitar duets with Mansour Seck in the early '80s) had Maal reached as deep into the well of time for inspiration. For the traditionalist this is Maal's essential album; for his longtime fans, this is the revelation of the music's long history.
