,Mysterious2k10,2010-06-09T07:49Z,"Put it all in my DLC folder, went in-game, and nothin.. I have the Steam version of this game, but I doubt that's the problem."
,BloodZero,2010-07-03T18:57Z,"Works like a charm. Thanks a lot!
The Air Propulsion Gun is soooooo cool!!!!!"
,kransefa,2010-07-18T23:45Z,do i need the steam version or will a torrented version work too?
,Atacknun,2010-08-04T21:39Z,"Doesn't work. I put it in the DLC folder and tried it with the Dropzone folder for the hell of it, but still nothing. Running it on steam if that matters at all."
,coolix,2010-08-18T04:56Z,"Worked for me, just dropped everything into the ""DLC"" folder."
,acer40,2010-09-26T21:18Z,can i use this for ps3?

Trust 

These 

People

Don't trust any anonymous torrent with a bunch of comments from people with no torrents.

2+2= You better find out if there are any viruses  or 'false positives' before opening..."
,angimanu,2010-12-13T17:08Z,no virus and works just make a dlc dir where you installed ur game and put all these files in this dlc dir
,OneTwoWilliams,2010-12-31T22:39Z,"Real and works well, just create folder called ""dlc"" in install directory and paste files from zip, some really cool stuff.

@crazy4logick stfu"

,Trollaaja,2011-05-16T15:45Z,"When I read stupid comments here ia have to confirm that this works, you have to make directory named ""dlc"" in the installation folder and just copy these there, simple as that.

Theres no viruses and this is good torrent. Sometimes, like mine avg antivirus, antivirus programs give false alarms.

People, dont listen dumb fucks here and do a little research if you doubt something.

Ps im not using steam version of the game and this dlc just unlocks guns etc. but you have to earn the money for it."
,StudentGR,2011-07-18T13:19Z,"This doesn't work with the Steam - original version of JC2. :(

I paste the files onto dlc folder but i can't find the DLC items in the black market.

I have only the Chevalier Ice Breaker, Chaos Parachute and Tuk Tuk Boom Boom from Steam."
,likeabossD111,2011-08-02T07:07Z,"Works great, create a DLC folder under the Just Cause 2 folder inside program files and drop the files into the DLC"
,heli3,2011-09-15T22:46Z,really good thank you!!
