Pianist Ray Bryant solidified his reputation with this outstanding 1957 trio release.  It displayed his facility with the blues, speed, gospel influence and interpretative abilities on such songs as John Lewis' "Django" and Clifford Brown's "Daahoud."  It also contained Bryant's funky originals "Splittin" and "Blues Changes," and was punctuated by Ike Isaacs' careful bass work and Specs Wright's loose, in the groove drumming.  This set has recently been reissued by Fantasy, and the remastering provides a fine sonic framework for Bryant's heady, unpredictable, and often exciting playing.

Ray Bryant is a great blues pianist, yet this early recording has only one blues piece on it - and the album is still one of the best he ever made. BLUES CHANGES is the blues composition, and it's done slow and way down-home. The best tune on the album, however, is SPLITTIN, an up-tempo swinger. Bryant works well with Isaacs and Wright - the drummer uses a very light touch, especially with the brushes. The CD is a great success. Highly recommended. ~ Bomojaz
