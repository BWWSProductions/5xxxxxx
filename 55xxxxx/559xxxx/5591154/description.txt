Storyline:
A personal aide to the U.S. Ambassador in France, James Reece has an enviable life in
Paris and a beautiful French girlfriend, but his real passion is his side job as a
low-level operative for the CIA. On his first senior-level assignment, he meets his
new partner, special agent Charlie Wax - a trigger-happy, wisecracking, loose cannon
who has been sent to Paris to stop a terrorist attack. Wax leads James on a shooting
spree through the Paris underworld. But when James discovers he is a target of the
same crime ring they are trying to bust, he realizes there is no turning back...and
that Wax might be his only hope for making it through the next 48 hours alive.
