    Sachiko Kobayashi .... Herself                                           
                                                                             
    In this taboo-smashing documentary by Kazuo Hara, the filmmaker turns    
    his camera on his former lover, Miyuki Takeda. The strong-willed         
    woman -- crusading feminist, bisexual, mother of an interracial baby     
    with an African-American GI -- was a maverick figure, particularly in    
    1970s Japan. Hara captures his subject in excruciating detail over a     
    period of several years in this keenly personal work, which caused a     
    scandal when it was released.
