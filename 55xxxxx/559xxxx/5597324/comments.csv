,Tehkril,2012-02-04T23:09Z,"Okay, so you guys know that you can check up on the uploader, correct? I just did a search for this ""lordi9610"" and found that either he is german/dutch or likes people to believe so. He seems to have uploaded this file onto at least 2 other websites and who knows how many under other aliases. I would be delighted to track and locate his ip if anyone would like."
