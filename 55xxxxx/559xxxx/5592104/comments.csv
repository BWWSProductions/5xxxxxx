,MosesMagnum,2010-05-28T08:41Z,"Thanks for the upload. Do you have Powers #4 by any chance? It released 3 weeks ago I believe, and I haven't found it online anywhere. My LCS has it though, so I know it actually got released and not delayed.

Thanks."

,MosesMagnum,2010-05-29T00:55Z,"Okay, thank you."
