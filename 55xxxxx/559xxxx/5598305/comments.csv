,HardUpActor,2010-05-29T17:13Z,"@ plugboi
Nearly all video formats will run on ps3 if you run it from a usb stick or download it on to the HDD. if you're having problems streaming your videos from other media in the house PC etc... then that's what i would suggest. P.S this video should work perfectly"
