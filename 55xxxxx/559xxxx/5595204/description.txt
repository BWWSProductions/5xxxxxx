PLOT
Lisa Vidal of ER delivers a stunning performance as Deborah Martin, a former photographer turned stay-at-home mom who moves her family into a strange old house filled with cut-glass windows and mirrors. But when Deborah begins seeing chilling visions within the reflections, she will become obsessed with trying to capture the truth behind the house s dark secret. Has Deborah accidentally discovered an alternate reality that unleashes a homicidal evil, or is she trapped within the terrifying recesses of the female mind? David Chisum (One Life To Live), Lupe Ontiveros (Real Women Have Curves) and Christine Lakin (Valentine) star in this provocative horror thriller with a killer twist that became a smash hit on IFC Festival Direct.
