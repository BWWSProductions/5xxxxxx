"Kissin' U" is the lead single by American recording artist Miranda Cosgrove from her debut studio album, Sparks Fly. It was produced by Dr. Luke  and written by him, Claude Kelly, and Cosgrove. The song was released digitally on March 22, 2010, and will impact mainstream radio on May 11, 2010. "Kissin' U" appeared in the teaser trailer of Yogi Bear.

The music video was shot in Santa Monica, California and debuted on March 19, 2010. The video consists of Cosgrove on the beach singing and walking to meet her love interest, who is a sidewalk artist. They go to his house and she sees all the paintings he has painted, as well as trying to teach her how to draw, and later washing his car in front of her house, she splashes him with the hose and he chases her around the car. Later they are seen at a party where it seems they kiss. When she wakes up that morning she looks out the window to see a drawing of a butterfly with images of her and him in the wings on the sidewalk. It was directed by Alan Ferguson.

On its first week of charting, "Kissin' U" debuted at number sixty-six on the U.S. Billboard Hot Digital Songs chart, the following week making its debut on the Billboard Hot 100 at number eighty-seven, dropping out the next week, then re-entering at number ninety-five and rose to its current peak number fifty-four, then falling to number ninety-one, and dropping out again, making its chart run four weeks long.
