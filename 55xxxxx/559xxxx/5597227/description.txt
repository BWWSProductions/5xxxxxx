An eerie psychological drama based on the true story of two sisters, Christine and Lea, who were maids in a provincial French town in 1932 and gained fame when they brutally murdered their cruel employers. Christine and Lea live and work in the house of Madame Danzard, a widow and the domineering mother of young Isabelle. The sisters have minimal contact with the outside world, no social life, and are continually berated and badgered by Madame. In this hothouse atmosphere, Christine and Lea develop an incestuous relationship. The tension between upstairs and downstairs comes to a head one day when the sisters, having blown an electrical fuse, murder Madame and Isabelle so as not to be chastised, once again.
