Through the end of 2009 and into 2010, released a series of fourteen studio updates chronicling the progress made on the album. Each update touched on a certain part of the album process, such as "recording guitar parts" or "mixing the album". The last studio updates confirmed that the album recording had been completed. In their last studio video update, Richard Patrick showcased two clips from final mixed songs on iTunes that listed track listing and track lengths. While the video is legitimate, it is not confirmed that it is the final tracklisting, only that it was a collection of new Filter songs on a playlist.
