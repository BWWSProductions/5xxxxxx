Wikipedia - Catatonia's Greatest Hits is a compilation of the bands best known songs, mainly the singles, but also included collaborations between Cerys Matthews with Space (on "The Ballad of Tom Jones") and with Tom Jones himself (on "Baby, It's Cold Outside"). The album was released as a 1CD and 2CD limited edition. The second disc of the two CD edition included lesser known album only tracks and some B-Sides, where although 10 tracks are listed, two hidden tracks are included at the end; "All Girls Are Fly" and "Blues Song". Despite the band having not releasing any new material since their splitting following their last album, Paper Scissors Stone, yet another compilation was released in 2006, Catatonia's Platinum Collection.
