,StrikeFromAbove,2011-05-08T11:01Z,"If you get CRC error it means that patch can't find path to the game.
Add or alternate this registry keys:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE-SOFTWARE-Activision-Blur
""InstallPath""=""app""
""EXEString""=""appBlur.exe"""
,DeadSOL,2011-09-26T09:48Z,"HOW TO UPDATE:

1. Download Blur Updates 1 AND 2.
2. Extract both updates to a folder.
3. Update 1 needs to be further extracted. Right click the file with the .001 extension and open with WINRAR. Now, click the ""Wizard"" icon in WINRAR and extract the files to any folder (to make it easier, just extract it in the same folder).
4. If you have already replaced the original/retail Blur.exe file, go to the Update 2 folder and copy Blur.exe from the ""Backup"" folder to the folder where the game is installed.
5. Apply the first update. It will work.
6. Go to the Update 2 folder and, once again, copy Blur.exe from the backup folder to the game folder. This time, also copy the ""gamedata"" file to the ""cache"" folder where the original game is installed.
7. Apply the second update.
8. Copy the Blur.exe file from the Update 2 folder (NOT its backup folder) and put it where the game has been installed.

The game should run fine now! :)"
