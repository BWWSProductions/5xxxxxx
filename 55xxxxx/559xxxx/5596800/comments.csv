,lydonit13,2010-05-28T16:21Z,"I'm just curious, how do you get such a small file size out of 720p resolution?  It seem that people who use x264 in a mkv container keep the file size over 4GB.  What's your secret for 400MB files?"
,johnmbot,2010-05-28T16:44Z,"i noticed the video bit rate is 576 Kbps... normaly it's around 5,000 kbps."
[V],pluto999,2010-05-28T16:47Z,@johnmbot: Normally its not 5000 kbps. But Bluray bitrate is kinda +- to that..
[V],pluto999,2010-05-28T16:49Z,@lydonit13: google it mate.. You'll know the tips & tricks.. Just for example the audio is 2 channel there i saved a lot of megabytes..
