Description:
Disneys "Story of one of 'Hitlers children as adopted from Mein Kampf":
"Topping the eye-poppingly outrageous charts of historical cartoon propaganda is without a doubt Disney's regrettable vignette, Education For Death, which graphically details the life and times of Hitler youth.
The narrator solemnly intones the distorted text of Gregor Ziemer's The Making of The Nazi. German adults are portrayed in classic Disney "sinister bulldog" style: barrel chest, small rear end, bowed legs, and no neck. The bellowing, red-faced instructor's jowls flop around like coattails as he berates a kindergarten classroom full of Bambi-eyed waifs in lederhosen, whose pluckish heads are delightfully oversized.
