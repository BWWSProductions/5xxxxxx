,typ050212,2010-05-29T13:09Z,"If this is activated, permanently, why is there a folder called activation?"
[T],FRITZBox,2010-05-29T13:25Z,The crack will permantly activate it.
,me_kk_,2010-05-29T20:29Z,thanks dl now will let ya know
,umim,2010-06-02T01:30Z,"Why is that big? 9.72 GB? Why is that other ""extra applications"" crap inside? Every1 who need it can find it."
,Galvatron999,2010-06-06T22:59Z,"@ umim - this has both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions included. Uncheck the versions you do not need before downloading. I am downloading the 64-bit office, and the total size is 5.29 GB. I will post further feedback here after I have downloaded and installed the torrent."
,umim,2010-06-09T18:24Z,"I'm talking about  ""extra applications"", not other edition! BTW it is waiting for last 2% of download for 5 hours. It looks like another BS."
,Baz2017,2010-06-20T04:25Z,"This is volume edition, right? Why don't it require KMS activator? :S"
,crimking,2010-06-20T04:33Z,"Please help! Even after following your instructions, installing the 64-bit version of Word 2010 errors out during install saying, ""Setup cannot locate the file word.WW\word.WW.msi"" 
Again, this is after following the instructions to do a custom install and selecting ""Run All From My Computer"" during setup. Any help and or insight would be deeply appreciated. Thanks!"
,crimking,2010-06-20T05:15Z,"Never mind, this torrent is a waste of time. You do in fact have to activate this. It is not pre-activated as it claims. You will need a KMS actiavtor to use it. "
,faruq_raj,2010-06-22T07:45Z,is there business contact manager? Pl confirm.
,iauoloom,2010-06-25T23:43Z,"is the great volume because of including many languages  ? no one use all languages !
seeds are very better than  ""NLUPPER's office 2010 version """
,unscathe,2010-07-06T16:43Z,works like a charm.. no need to use activators.. simply install according to instructions. thanks to the uploader. great stuff

,Focuscar,2011-01-23T23:33Z,"I wonder if this really works ""now = 24/01/2011"" ?

If yes, why is it not ""popular""? Why do people prefer the ""VL KMS-Activator"" to this one?"
,Focuscar,2011-01-24T01:32Z,"From a google search + a guess I think:

""This Edition is Permanently Activated 'and does not require' a Mini-KMS Activator to activate it.""

=

This Edition is Permanently Activated 'by' a Mini-KMS Activator to activate it."
,skullcandy14,2011-03-09T02:44Z,People NEED to seed this! I've been downloading for 5+ hours!
