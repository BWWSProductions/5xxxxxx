,renison7,2011-08-21T09:16Z,"i like ur uploads a lot but for this one i guess riddlerA  has a better one with smaller size, subtitles and extras. keep up the good work."
,renison7,2011-08-21T13:43Z,There is something really wrong with the RiddlerA upload as the MKV files don't play on VLC and I use it to watch everything. I think it some encryption or something dunno. I am sorry for the earlier comments and I guess I will try the YIFY ones. But hey the extras are AVI so they work fine.

,OMGnigga,2012-02-09T14:40Z,do you not know what HDTV is? Compressing and downscaling an HDTV encode does not equate to an HDTV product... these are not 720p. Stop fail describing these releases.
