        Since the Age of Enlightenment, the gap between the known  and
        the  unknown has  shrunk considerably.  We have  mapped every
        corner of our  planet and explored  our universe, but  despite
        this countless phenomena still remain unexplained.

        The Unexplained is a breathtaking new series from The  History
        Channel  that  probes the  mysteries  of the  world.  From the
        shocking voodoo rituals of  the Caribbean to the  secret alien
        research centre  at Area  51, from  the shadowy  doings of the
        Skull &  Bones to  terrifying vampire  myths, The  Unexplained
        will separate fact from fiction.

        Prepare yourself for a chilling journey into The Unexplained.

        For years, people have claimed that the government has covered
        up proof of the existence  of UFOs. For years, the  government
        has denied the rumors as groundless. Spaceships versus weather
        balloons. Aliens versus mannequins. Both sides claim the other
        is  lying  or  misguided;  both  sides  present   considerable
        evidence. Examine  some of  the most  famous UFO  cases of all
        time  in an  attempt to  get to  the bottom  of this  ongoing
        debate. Does the secret military base in Nevada known as  Area
        51 house the  bodies and vessel  of aliens who  crashed in the
        desert 50  years ago?  What happened  in the  night skies over
        Rendlesham Forest, near London? Numerous interviews provide  a
        balanced  look  at  these and  other  famous  cases. Witnesses
        including  highly  decorated  military  pilots  tell  of their
        encounters with craft that they could not identify, while  the
        world  s  most  experienced  UFO  investigators  offer  their
        opinions of what really happened.
