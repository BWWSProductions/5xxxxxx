Ok so this is on my personal "Top 5 Fav Movies" list I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND YOU WILL TOO!!!

For the longest time i've been searching for this film. I happened to catch it on LATE night tv once in my whole life (1998) and I couldnt stop talking about it for months... years even. So after some "international" searching (Melbourne, Australia) and $19.99 later I HAVE IT!! and now the internet does too, so please seed this amazing film, cause as far as i know (and i'v been looking for a long time) this is the only english rip thats on the net.
