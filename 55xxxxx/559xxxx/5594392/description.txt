"Banned In America" shows video clips of the darkest elements of human nature
society, and life; the very things that bring fear and disgust into our collective existences
Whether it be live executions, live suicides, or miscellaneous forms of evil
"America" shows us that a sinister world of death lies right outside our door
just waiting for our number to be called
