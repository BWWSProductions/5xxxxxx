Originaly posted by Jakobsson,


 now fixed the porblems with the "readme.txt" on disk 1 
and the "sdat.viv" on disk 2.

the trojan in the "crack" folder has been removed.

.bin files have been converted to .iso
 



fixed both of the disks from being disk 2 (my fault)




Enjoy!!
