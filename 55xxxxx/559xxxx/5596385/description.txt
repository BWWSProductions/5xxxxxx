NOTE: 272p = frame-size 480x272 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, playable on all kinds
             of MP4 capable devices/players/playback systems
      360p = frame-size 640x360 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, middle-format, playback
             as for 272p (except streaming)
      480p = frame-size 720x480 pixels for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV) or 720x304
             for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR)
      720p = frame-size 1280x720 pixels for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV) or 1280x544
             for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR), hardware intensive
      
      Most problems people have are with frame-sizes 1280x720 (720p). I recommend 
      and have used one system for years - CoreCodec for H264 and part of DivX7 
      for AAC. 
      Both are proved perfect, fastest and provide seamless playback up to 1080p 
      on new generation of computers. Newer NVIDIA graphic cards processors (GPU)
      decode H264 using dedicated subroutines directly served from CoreCodec 
      (I have an ATI card, just in case you were wondering).
      
      Problems one can have may come from either one of the following 
      and/or a combination of these â€“ the playback system itself, a 
      malfunctioning device or lack of knowledge. 
      
      For instance, any so called "jerky" playback of "system-heavy" 720p comes
      from insufficient CPU and graphic engine power or simply - overloaded 
      computer. Use of ddshow filters and "codecs" is suicidal. This is not 
      Russian 720p Matroska format ("official" 720p) and completely different 
      setup is required (extremely high bit-rates of .mkv 720p to some extent
      "hide" bad encoding style). In low bit-rate H264, such as mine, 
      those errors and bad technique cannot be hidden and therefore are avoided as 
      much as possible.
        
      Any 'blurriness' of video comes from less-than-recommended media player. 
      VLC  and a few other players are the most versatile and, generally speaking,
      good - but quality is 10-20% lower.
      Any â€˜blockinessâ€™ comes from 'system-too-slow' situation, when decoding 
      engine of ones device become over-capacitated and cannot process all frames 
      as it supposed to.
      On "I have no video" and "I have no sound" I don't waste my time as this 
      is generally a complete lack of knowledge and/or understanding. 
      RTFM is the best response I can give.

      MP4 is absolutely ISO 14496-1 compliant. There are no B-frames, no CABAC 
      entropy in 272p and 360p, no strange filtering and no AV weirdness of 
      any kind.

      Recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768 (no matter frame-size).
      PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.
      I am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system 
      and proper loudspeakers (connect Line Out of Soundcard or standalones 
      with Line In of any Stereo rack).
      
      I encode H264 for six years and I have experienced (first-hand) any problem 
      one might have or imagine. I have heard almost every â€˜complaintâ€™ out there 
      and would, if asked POLITELY, be happy to answer questions and give as much 
      help as humanly possible   
      I always have.

     ">>>...... at 2010-05-26 17:04 CET: 
    ...your 720p format is unique - For some reason no one seems to think
    doing it, which is why people go into spastic attack in your comments. "
     "...the quality is much higher than ANY other 350mb rip."
     
    Please Others, don't go "spastic" - just go away instead spreading Insanity 
    and Evil.
    We have enough of that. On TPB alone every single title is usually 
    available in many torrents.
    Nobody forced you to use mine, right? 
    But maybe.... no.... anyway, I'll ask "Who was that?"
