Sister Dee has a special room that she likes to use for entertaining her guests. It is not pretty but it is perfect for her. Everything about the room screams out its purpose. It is dark and windowless, with implements hanging from the walls and sitting on shelves. The walls look flimsy but are not only strong, but sound-proof, too. The bed in the center is the foreboding kind from horror movies. 

The frame is rusting and the paint is peeling away but it is sturdy. The mattress is bare and covered in stains. It completes the psychological element of her entrapment. Once that is done the pain and humiliation that follow will be that much more powerful.
