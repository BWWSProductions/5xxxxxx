BLUE BLOODS is a drama about a multi-generational family of cops dedicated to New York City law enforcement. Frank Reagan (Tom Selleck) is the New York Chief of Police and patriarch of the Reagan brood, which he heads as diplomatically as he does the force, even when dealing with the politics that plagued his unapologetically bold father, Henry (Len Cariou), during his stint as Chief. A source of pride and concern for Frank is his eldest son Danny (Donnie Wahlberg), a seasoned detective, family man and Iraqi War vet who on occasion uses dubious tactics to solve cases. The sole Reagan woman in the family, Erin (Bridget Moynahan), is a N.Y. Assistant D.A. and newly single parent, who also serves as the legal compass for her siblings and father. Jamie (Will Estes) is the youngest Reagan, fresh out of Harvard Law and the family's ""golden boy."" However, unable to deny the family tradition, Jamie decided to give up a lucrative future in law and is now a newly minted cop, a career change seemingly supported by his beautiful girlfriend, Sydney Davenport (Dylan Moore), a first year lawyer. Jamie's life takes an abrupt turn, however, when he's asked to become part of a clandestine police investigation even his father knows nothing about, and one that could impact the family's legacy. Emmy Award winners Mitchell Burgess, Robin Green and Leonard Goldberg are executive producers for CBS Television Studios.

,lilars26,2010-05-26T13:30Z,Nurse Jackie?
,jjabrams,2010-05-26T14:23Z,20/40 are you going to be doing mad men / dexter / weeds as well when they come back? in 720p?
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-26T15:12Z,"@jjabrams: I honestly have no idea. I wish I could make such promise, but it would be stupid."
,jjabrams,2010-05-26T17:04Z,"ok no probs 20/40, imo those are the best upcoming US summer shows (also true blood) and your 720p format is unique - For some reason no one seems to think doing it, which is why people go into spastic attack in your comments."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-26T18:08Z,"LOL jj, in lost hour, after your and mine comment on Lost 720p same guy logged in and out four times - adding ""-1"" to his ""spastic"" opinion before."
,laptopdog,2010-05-26T18:21Z,"@JJ I agree with you about Mad Men and Weeds  - they're both great shows (especially Mad Men). But Breaking Bad is also brilliant... from what you've said so far, I think you'd love it (if you're not watching it already).

Never got into Dexter, myself.. and it seems too late to start now."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-26T19:50Z,"@laptopdog: No hard feelings, but - I do not exist so long as I am on TPB. So far, someplace else, I have released ALL seasons of Weeds (but they were [micro] back then) and ALL seasons of True Blood (season Two as [nano]). As I have repeated here when I got here, to my regular visitors or friends, I have managed to save maybe 10% of my earlier encodings when old place was blown-up... and for number of years I never have money to even bought empty DVDs and burn copies on. Well...

So last few hours I was ""calibrating"" my response to both jj and you.

I came up with following:
- ""Weeds"" absolutely. 25 minutes make them suitable for small-size (this what I stand for) as 272p AND 720p (720p approx. 252MB, as XviD ones).
- ""Dexter"" was long (55-59 minutes) and was and would be encoded ONLY as ""jump-in"" (so far it happened frequently). Dexter never made into my schedule and I have fat reasons for that (in domain of ""never bite the feeding hand)
-""Mad Man"" started good, but interest in my encodings dropped below any reasonable level during past season, went out and probably never would come back. Maybe as jump-in, maybe.

To recapitulate: Only ""True Blood"" and ""Weeds"" have green light - BUT: two ingredients are crucial - I should be alive and my PC too. In that sense chances are slim, very thin and more in domain of science-fiction and wishful thinking."
