,afkuser,2010-05-26T03:31Z,"With utorrent, you can set priority to high on the episodes you want to watch first (normal on the next one, then low on the rest).  That's how I usually get through multiple seasons of shows.

This torrent is set up with individual files so you can do just that.

It may take a long time, but I don't watch them as quickly as they download."
,afkuser,2010-05-26T14:33Z,"If this has ALL the episodes, wouldn't that by default make the other 100 torrents with anything less redundant?"
,leptossomico,2010-05-26T18:10Z,hahahaha... 141.12 GB. No way... 
,Asteao,2010-05-27T03:40Z,"I think this torrent is a good idea, it consolidates all the seasons into one torrent. Now that the series is over you can just download the whole thing all at once. This should become the definitive Lost torrent."
[V],pluto999,2010-05-27T09:11Z,@all i agree with GoodFilms this is totally a bad idea
,soulfake,2010-05-31T09:37Z,I'll try to download :)))
,afkuser,2010-06-03T13:57Z,"121 peers right now...

It's a large torrent, but I'm still seeding."
,mosmooth,2010-06-03T18:18Z,"These are all good. The seeder is just 1 person who has taken a lot of time and effort to supply these 720p HD TV versions-they are not .iso files.

As for Trolkan's stupid comment (no seeders) well, he's just an imbecile with no torrents of its own.

And ThievesFilmsBecile's comments-IT is a torrent thief and a vindictive imbecile. Ignore it.

afkuser-Thanks for your upload. And the file sizes ensure quality viewing (higher than deathmules 700Mb DVD structures.)

Ignore the imbeciles that frequent this site-they are nothings."
,mosmooth,2010-06-03T18:21Z,"Oops-Trolkan has STOLEN a torrent (21 seeds already-and uploaded this morning!). An 11 Mb screener!

He is trying to emulate ThievesFilmsBecile (but it has a long way to go in torrent theft terms!)
"
,MacGuyVer1,2010-06-08T21:02Z,"Thanks for the torrent.
Please Seed.
First piece of s01e01 seems to be missing from my swarm at least.

Suggestion for afkuser,
make an individual torrent for each season as well. (for those with limited disk space, inferior torrent clients and/or ignorance of how to use it, etc.) You should be able to seed for all torrents from same source files simultaneously. I have seeded torrents this way.

I use an external disk for large torrents so I don't worry about space. I also understand how to use multiple torrent clients on different platforms.

Thanks Again."
,MacGuyVer1,2010-06-15T19:19Z,"Finally got to preview the Pilot episode.
Excellent Quality no Watermarks :thumbsup:

Happy Enough To Continue Sharing. B-)

Keep On Seeding. ;-)
"
,afkuser,2010-06-22T01:52Z,"Currently 225 peers.  Still seeding.

Note:  If you want to watch them in order, use utorrent (or similar torrent app).

In utorrent:
Click the torrent.
Click the files tab.
Highlight all the files (Ctrl+a).
Right-click, set priority to low.
Choose the episode you want to watch, say the pilot.  Right click it and set priority to high.

It will download first, and when it hits 100%, double-click to watch it.

Repeat until you've seen them all."
,MacGuyVer1,2010-08-20T03:50Z,"Just Curious where people are at.

95% +
1.3 + share ratio
40/115 files complete"
,afkuser,2010-08-21T17:28Z,"Got about 35 people at 97.7% complete.

Funny how these torrents work.  I've uploaded well over 200GB for this 140GB torrent and it's not yet at 100%.

I uploaded / downloaded other tv shows which used my bandwidth a bit.  From now until this hits 100%, i'm giving it all my U/L speed.

Shouldn't be long now."
,MacGuyVer1,2010-08-21T22:11Z,"I would be one of them.  98.1%
I opened up my throttle as well today.

I've downloaded over 141 GB uploaded over 190 GB

BTW 1-3% is normal for 'overhead'. ""super seeding"" is a method to alleviate the load for the Seeder, 1:1, 1 piece is fully seeded 1 time only. Its not a perfect science, since individuals use and settings effect overall performance of the torrent. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-seeding
I will continue to seed after 100% completion. But I will throttle back considerably."
,MacGuyVer1,2010-08-23T23:21Z,"Missing piece # 29758
S05E12 - Dead is Dead.mkv

Last piece needed. Have not downloaded a single block of that piece for 12+ hrs. No seeds reported in the swarm.

It would be ironic if this torrent dies because of this missing piece, but mostly disappointing."
,MacGuyVer1,2010-08-24T02:26Z,";)
nevermind the seeds are emerging."
,afkuser,2010-09-14T00:28Z,"No.  I don't speak Deutsch, so I wouldn't have the files if they had dubbed German audio.
If they do, in VLC Player, right click the video, go to audio, then select the English stream."
,Rohan82,2010-10-01T15:52Z,"Just curious, what's everyone's avg DL time for this. I have the standard def lost series and it's only ~40GB. I'd love to have this quality but it seems that it would take quite a while..."
,areadyex,2010-11-17T13:15Z,Season 6 is missing episode 4 - The substitute. Can anyone confirm this?
,i2ainb0w,2010-11-19T17:54Z,Thanx this is epic! all in one :d! 
,textxet,2010-12-05T16:32Z,"I'm at 75,9%, uploadet 438 GB..."
,ODBC,2011-01-08T14:36Z,Thank you for sharing.
,MEplayer,2011-01-21T00:49Z,Don't be scared by the file size; there are a lot more seeders than it says.
,enders9,2011-03-26T14:43Z,Are these videos a little darker than they should be for anyone else?
,enders9,2011-03-26T15:11Z,"Nevermind, it was my monitor making them darker. Not the actual video's themselves being dark"
,Dogger55,2011-04-30T21:42Z,"The frame rate is 25 fps, which makes the video a little choppy on my WDTV live. Kind of suck for a download this large."
,afkuser,2011-06-20T23:42Z,"It is ~24 fps, but works fine on my WDTV Live Plus.

are people still seeding this and is a torrent this old even worth bothering with?"
