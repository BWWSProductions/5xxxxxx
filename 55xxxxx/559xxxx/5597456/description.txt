Alex talks [hour 2, 1st half of hour 3] with respected Middle East expert and former BBC presenter Alan Hart. Mr. Hart has broken his silence on 9/11 and has revealed that the worldâ€™s most prominent civil engineering company told him directly that the collapse of the twin towers was a controlled demolition.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
