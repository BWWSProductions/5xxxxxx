Thx jerry "

I havent watched the last 4, but if theyre all like that, i dont want to. Like i said, good torrent, material is correct, and audio is a 10. but if the flashing black screen continues throughout, then im not satisfied. Ill try the other torrent, and comment on that as well. Its an ISO torrent. Hopefully its all 1 file."
