Ron Bennington unmasks Colin Quinn

I am going to to attempt to get Unmasked, Ron Bennington Interviews
and Special Delivery shows up in the future in 128k. 128k is 
probably overkill, but my choices are stereo 64k or 128k. I will not
be using the "high-quality" record to wav then re-encode slowly to 
VBR 128k method but instead live to 128k mp3. I am also going to 
try to grab Jim Norton's new show this Thursday, but that will go 
up in 64k as it airs on ultra-compressed XM 150.
