,bobb5,2010-05-26T21:23Z,"this is awesome! thanks.

don't mean to sound greedy but any chance of upping the unmasked of jimmy fallon. i heard it was pretty good."
[V],mothergoose56,2010-05-26T23:24Z,"I can't up what I don't have, and from here on out I'm only upping my own encodes so I don't have to hear whining. At some point the Fallon unmasked will be re-aired, and I will up it in 128k quality when it does. And yes, I will up Weird Medicine as well. "
