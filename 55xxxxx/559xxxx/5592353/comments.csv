[T],insinuendo,2010-05-26T22:32Z,"This is really confusing.

Your imdb link is for: Per qualche dollaro in piì²« (1965) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059578/

Your titles refers to: Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo. (1966) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/

Your image is: ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1998) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129695/

So what is it?"

trolkan, you some kind of hallway monitor?  also your an idiot for posting comments like that.  dont like the torrent, dont download it. and yes it is a good idea to post ""dupes"" i garuntee you in a few days this torrent will have atleast a 200% better seed:leech ratio than that other previously posted torrent(which was posted in 2009).  bozx uploading stuff that is already seeded but his seed:leech ratio always stays higher than most others. seriously common sense should tell you if there is two of the same torrents, which one you gonna download? the one with the highest ratio and seeing how this was posted a day ago the torrent hasnt had a chance to be properly seeded yet."
