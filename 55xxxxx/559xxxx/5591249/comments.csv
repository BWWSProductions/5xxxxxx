,djdlux2005,2010-06-16T06:49Z,"Thank You FXG team for all your superb uploads!  As a 100% disabled combat wounded veteran with PTSD, Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Nerve damage, and Degenerative disc disease, living on disability, you have helped make my quality of live a bit better.  As I cannot go out to the store or the movie theaters or anywhere else for that matter, you have helped keep my mind off things with great quality movies.   I don't even have to read the comments for your rips!  If you are the upload er, I already know that the quality is good and the movie is real with no viruses embed-ed!

So thank you for all your rips!

this one is 10/10/9 A/V/M

thanks a TON!

as a side note, I have a large collection of M9-M10 DVD and Blue Ray movies and would like to contribute also, but I don't know how to rip/upload.  If someone can show me how, I will put up 100s of DVD/BR rips of the finest quality.  I just got a new computer with dual 750G hard drives and a DVD ROM/burner with 6 gigs of ram and a dual processor, so I have plenty of memory to put up movies, I just don;t have the know how.

Normally I just download, but you and a few others have inspired me to contribute!  plzs show me the way!

(compared to blue ray)

perfect as a reg DVD, speach is a bit soft, and action a bit loud, but if u stream to a ps3 or extender it levels out to pretty good 5.1 surround and video is also better (seems to be common on your rips)

but I always know that any movie uploaded by you will be more than just watchable....sometimes I have to hang on to the volume remote if I burn them, but streaming they are always top notch.  I will seed ur movies for sure!"

If you haven't seen it already than search it and check out the other reviews if you don't take my word for it. Otherwise, it basically deals with things like in this movie. The title says lot."

I am not sure if this was one of the best movies of the year or one of the worst ever and a complete waste of time to watch. I am still trying to figure it out. I am leaning toward a real waste of time. It's very creative writing, I must admit, but still a waste of time."

,Ozzy_fan,2011-01-18T01:26Z,"Hey FXG_TEAM, 
I am fairly new to Torrents compared to most people on here. Let me start by saying Thank you Very Much for all of your hard work on all of these quality ups of yours!!! Your u/l's are always top quality & I never have to read the comments for A=?, V=?. if it saysâ€¦ By  FXG_team, Itâ€™s golden! I always trust your d/lâ€™s !!! I was wondering if you & your team accept donations of any kind? I myself donâ€™t think seeding alone plus a polite comment here and there is thank~you enough. I do seed as often & as much as I can however. If I may ask another question. My G/F wants to see  â€œFlicaâ€œ & ""Flicka 2"" in a bad way, Would you happen to have them? I would love to have both for her to watch back-to-back. When sheâ€™s happyâ€¦ Iâ€™m happy :o)~ I will give you my email addy so you can answer my first & second questions, if you get the time. I appreciate you sharing all of these quality torrents with everyone. Thanks once again for all of your hard work...it is very much appreciated!!!  Ozzyfan
