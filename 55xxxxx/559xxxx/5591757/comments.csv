 A/V quality 10/10?

or maybe:

 ""Hey, thanks, uploader, for putting up such a great copy! We really appreciate your efforts!""

You friggin' putz. 

PS: Yes, I used a Yiddish term because I knew you'd like it so much."
,Deznaj,2010-05-27T02:45Z,"No worries man, the US doesn't have enough money anymore to invade Iran..."
,FallenXx,2010-05-27T08:24Z,"You think America needs money to wage war? You should fear the fact that they've run out of money. That's the goal of whatever invisible group that wants this war. Create 3 economic classes in her people. The filthy rich, the rich, and the very poor. The very poor have no choice but to enlist into the military as means to feed their families. The ultimate goal? Globalism. Zionists have their hands in every single government in the world and those that resist..? Get snuffed out. Expect another illegal war in Iran this summer, and perhaps a civil war in the United States. The peoples' unrest grows. Our right to bear arms isn't just for show. Meanwhile.. Israel is committing genocide against Palestine and no one even bats an eye.. (here in America, at least) "
,sirakon,2010-05-27T13:19Z,"hey, V9 A9 pretty good movie
only gripe is the very last part of the movie has stuffed up and skips back and forth. annoying but doesnt spoil the movie. 

ps. shut up and watch the movie."
,drlouies,2010-05-27T16:15Z,"God Bless u FallenXx and holohoaxu r dame right

,kurnis2,2010-05-28T06:07Z,"1. im american. it is awesome. not having to worry about food, internet or how to speak properly = YESPLZ

2. all you haters like holohoax, you make me laugh so hard!  its like you people think all of America supported the war...how ignorant can you be?  maybe turn on the news or read about our internal politics a little bit before broadcasting your stupidity.

Holochode, its obvious after reading your posts that you are either 5 or have no idea what youre talking about.  ""zionists""...really made me lol.  Youve been watching too many ""end of the world"" movies.  Always good to hear from some poorly educated child sitting in an internet cafe who is lashing out due to envy and jealousy.  

anyways, thanks for uploading the movie! 

HATERS GONNA HATE!"
,mikeyjoe80,2010-05-28T23:04Z,"As a true born and raised American, I can say that am sick and tired of all you fucks that say screw or fuck America. You retards base all your hate and views from your jealousy and lack on knowledge of whats really going on in the world. While I do have to agree that America is not perfect, this great nation has done and does alot of good in this world. We have done everything from protect innocent people from asshole dictator's like your Saddam and other fuck heads who choose to kill, starve, rape, and genocide. We feed more than half the world, if America decided to stop exporting food to your broke ass, 3rd world countries, you would all fucking starve! Alot of people are quick to point out faults and wrong doings, but forget or look pass the good. You should all be thankful that this great country pulls its weight in helping out fucktards like yourselves. Funny thing is, all you assholes would bitch if America did nothing in this world as you bitch if we do, so its a lose lose situation. I for one am proud of my great nation, god bless America!!"
,ticktock_man,2010-05-28T23:55Z,"horrific skipping right at the end of the movie. 
if you waited this long, id wait for a proper. it doesnt seem like a big deal that the last couple minutes skip every 3 seconds, but trust me its f*cking annoying as hell. "
,FallenXx,2010-05-29T00:48Z,"http://www.endtheoccupation.org/

How informed are you? American media is deregulated. Meaning: It is monopolized and controlled by ONE facet. We protect Israel, but ask yourself this. If the tables were turned, would they protect us? The Muslims hate us because we defend them. Zionists were the same people in power when Christ was alive. They feared him and rejected him because he wasn't a vengeful prophet. He was supposed to help them commit genocide.. when he didn't they turned his ass over to their oppressors. Now they pit us against the ones they oppress. Hitler wins is all I can think. Because of him, the jews get a free pass to do whatever the fuck they want. 

Help change US foreign policy before it changes us. peace"
,sekoilutohtori,2010-05-29T00:51Z,"First about rip: A/V both 9... but something weird on the end 5 min, bumps like hell, but still can get the closure. More weird is that only music bumps when they find the last bom, not the rip?? ment to be this way??

Never commented before on the movie, but man did the other top 100 get the people shouting! Good movie in my opinion. Good start, bit lazy in the middle, and the lazyness explaned in the end. Worth watching!! 
Major opinion seemed that this was political and against some religion. Once again took place in US as the target, but between the lines I saw a film about the question: who determines the line of how much violence can be used to protect the innocense?
In the end nobody knew who was the bad guy. Probably was the idea, and a good one in deed nowadays. Bless me for living in country whos not a major player in crysis operations, would be hard to chose a side...  "

,kryptois,2010-05-30T06:46Z,The american people have no say so if our country wants to attack someone they will do it we dont have any say. So remember that
,pjthunder,2010-05-31T23:44Z,Look you antisemitic jackoff...get a fucking life...lemme guess you're a shit for brains neo-nazi dickbrain that should be sterilized and slapped between the legs with a meat hook...?

,pjthunder,2010-05-31T23:51Z,"Anti-Semitics should be slapped and sterilized... haters and war mongers the same...oh and we don't need money to launch a nuke on Iran and turn it into the kitty litter box it should be along with Paki, Iraq, and all those lame ass shit starters... fuck all you lame asses that use this forum for your limp dicked politically correct half witted thoughts!!"
,Ocir,2010-06-01T18:01Z,Thanx extremezone!! I enjoyed the movie.  A=10 V=10. I have not downloaded a bad quality movie from extremezone.

..... Because the US gave Israel nuclear weapons, other countries NEED them too....
Get your facts straight, France gave Israel nuclear weapons under the guise of electric power generation."
,jmdowney,2010-06-02T02:17Z,"All these comments lately on TPB are fu@kin pathetic. The comment section is for just that comments about the movie and its quality. Some of you must have absolutely nothing to do if you sit on TPB and bitch about politics and world issues. I will be the first to admit America is not close to perfect but who really is? Where would the world be without America, look how far we have come in just over 200 years. K I'm stopping now so I don't sound like all the other a-holes. Good movie V-8 A-8 M-8. Thanx extremezone!!"
,T4,2010-06-02T13:58Z,why the hell the search results dont show this torrent? i found it by searching it in google...
,Helmet507,2010-06-02T22:14Z,best comments ever!
,ItsNotYouItsMe,2010-06-05T06:25Z,"Wow! Crazy how much political controversy can be sparked by a few innocuous comments. I think it would be so much better if we could restrain ourselves, and restrict our diatribes to our opinion of the specific subject matter (ie: The Torrent) but those days are apparently somewhere on the horizon behind us. 

That said, the only thing I originally objected to was the fact that I have seen so many nearly identical posts by Holohoax on so many different films on differing subjects, which (to me) smacked of a ""cut-and-paste"" attitude toward films of this type of subject matter. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm a frequent downloader, and he's a frequent offender.

However, after reading the comment directed at me from ""drlouies"", I find that I have no choice but to rethink my position. You, sir, have shown me the error of my ways.

Aside from the fact that you are, apparently, a doctor - a position well deserving of the respect of us all - you are obviously also well-versed in the political arena, as evidenced by your lucid and informed rebuttal of everything I stated. My apologies; I should have considered what I was saying before I rendered such a banality in a public forum.  I salute your intellect, and humbly thank you for deigning to descend to such a level that I may learn at your feet.

In the spirit of such an exchange of knowledge - and considering that English is most likely your second(?) language - ""Shithead"" is spelled as one word. Just thought you'd want to know."
,redking17,2010-06-07T08:37Z,"Movie starts skipping at 1:28:20

Shame me and my wife really enjoyed this movie.

It was a great relief after Valhalla rising and all the other crap being pumped out of hollywood.

Ending is great if you can skip through the glitches, I wont spoil it though.

But it is pretty crazy."
,ritual_funk,2010-06-08T04:43Z,"The ENDING of this movie is corrupted, as in it starts jittering like some fucking avant-garde scratch movie, didnt the ripper check the movie afterwards or what the fuck. I dont know about you but to me ENDINGS are quite important in movies... you know kinda like reading a book and find the last pages been ripped out ? .. useless. 

p.s I saw another user report this problem, im using the latest vlc and im on a good comp 
so I assume this is in the encoding, if im wrong then my apologies

,hanoncs,2010-06-08T06:10Z,Skipped the last minute or so. Still understandable though. The terrorist is a great actor!

,nikrusty,2010-06-29T19:26Z,"Excellent movie...but u need the stomach for it and tough morals!

Anyway...there is a technical error at the end of the movie...really at the end when all scenes start repeating like ""Deja Vu's"". But it's right at the end when the whole movie gets over and the credits roll but has like 1 min of the story in NO conversation just action ."
,Orthomun,2010-07-01T21:57Z,Nice quality rip many thanks extremezone much appreciated 
,iccyhot,2010-07-03T00:33Z,I thought the DVD version was supposed to have a different ending.
