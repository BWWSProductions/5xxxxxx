i'm not a big fan of proprietary formats and try to avoid using them as much as i can."
[T],metalcore.,2010-05-30T17:01Z,"well, im no expert but doesnt it depend on the codec used? isnt avi just a contaner or wrapper? i always use xvid , as opposed to divx (xvid is open source as far as i know)...and the avi container is MUCH more compatible. though i do use ac3 audio, not sure where that stands. not all of us have super sweet computer set-ups like you may have and prefer to watch it on our standalones, and i dont see the harm done with xvid and avi seeing as they provide superior rips."
