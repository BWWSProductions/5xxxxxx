If you could please increase your upload speed as (at least on my end) Im getting just 25k.. Im uploading at over 150K my way with only 937MBs downloaded while I have 5GB's uploading (WTF)..

Come on people and increase your upload speed.

Later,
Civic/Scootin"

That's as fast as I can manage at the moment, as I am currently seeding five other games. I do appreciate how much you've uploaded, but this is the best I can do right now."

I do thank you for the replie as many uploader do not comment on there torrents - so thank you for that..

I gave up after being around 45% complete and uploading over 15GB's..

However you may want to upload 1 file at a time as Im sure your other uploads are going just a slow.. Plus its not good on you HDD ither..

Just my $0.03~
In the end great upload and hope to see more in the future.."

Yeah, I kinda picked up on that... I'll have to slow down on my uploads, eh?
Seems like my other torrents have been doing alright without me for now. Sorry you couldn't download it, though. Maybe it's somewhere else on the internet...?"
,supz,2010-06-12T10:47Z,"@theblasphemousbear - That's not what Civic is saying at all and your sarcasm doesn't help.  The fact is this - if you had seeded them individually, all your uploads would probably now be well seeded, but as it is, you have a load of uploads that people have been waiting for weeks to complete.  That's the point he was making and a good point it was.  He's not saying he doesn't appreciate it.  I also wanted this, but ended up getting it from another source.  If this is the way you upload, then fine.  It would just be quicker to do them individually, because then others will be seeding it for you while you concentrate on another.

That being said, we do appreciate your uploads; we just feel you could prioritise your torrents in order to speed the process along."
