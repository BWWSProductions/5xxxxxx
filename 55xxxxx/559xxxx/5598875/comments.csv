I had to concatenate the two movie segments together, demux the audio and video, and ran the audio through a slowdown process to 23.976 fps to correct the pitch.  Then I muxed it back with the video, also changing the fps to 23.976 and it played fine after that.  I won't dock you quality since it was my own preference to hassle with all that.  The movie kind of sucks though, honestly, but thanks for the upload just the same."
