,Masterpiece90,2011-01-03T18:35Z,"I had same problem, that in Two Towers I did not had sound. I mounted it with Daemon Tools and watched it with VLC media. Then it worked!"
,Masterpiece90,2011-02-07T18:47Z,"If you are going to burn this movie to DVD, do not download this. There is no sound at all. Yes, you can get the sound by watching it via VLC media, but if you try it with XboX 360 or normal dvd-player, there will not be sound.

How I know? I tried."
