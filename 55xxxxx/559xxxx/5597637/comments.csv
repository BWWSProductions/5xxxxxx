,thunderbum,2010-05-29T01:42Z,"Thanks once more for the Limbaugh! Much appreciated! 

The Ovomit administration's penchant for telling lies upon lies upon lies that it's getting increasingly more difficult to sift the subterfuge from situation ethics! 

If not for people such as Beck, Limbaugh, Malkin, Hannity, and Coulter I'd just say 'screw it' and shut off the TV. 

Have a good, safe weekend everybody!
