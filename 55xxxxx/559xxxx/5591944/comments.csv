[V],Subzero!,2010-05-26T17:00Z,"another lightspeed Multi kulti rip for your gaming entertainment.... nothing missing, unlike in other  suspicious versions coming up soon..."
,Omiee,2010-05-26T17:08Z,why add another one this is like the 5th already others have way more seeders
,sjaam,2010-05-26T18:23Z,awesome thanks TPTB!
,AZkiller7,2010-05-26T19:47Z,"Subzero! why zig-zagging, you could have directly said "" globe's rip "" instead of "" other versions ... "", stop hating, this ain't a competition. Let's assume by doing rips you're helping those with low bandwidth, so stick to the cause. And by the way your work is appreciated, so will globe's."
,Likeadidas95,2010-05-26T23:16Z,"@ subzero : 

AZkiller7 is right ..i appreciate globe's work ! you are both good rippers, but dont blame others !
mby globes version is smaller and have more seeders ! i dont wanna say that you guys are shit !
u both rock dude ;) .. let's just be friends and everything will be okay :) im right ? :D

thanks anyway ! :)"
[V],Subzero!,2010-05-27T04:09Z,"@whining childrens...

me just said that Another version is coming up (as usual) , claimed to be full (as usual), but then there is stuff missing(as usual).
and later users get forwarded to ""one click Hosters""(as usual)...etc etc.
if thats not suspicious, then i dont know!.

greets to your beloved mr.caps'a'lock!"
,jSuraj,2010-05-27T12:44Z,"he he he he

,theOogmer,2010-05-27T15:20Z,"FACTS:
you cant finish the ballad of gay tony in globes rip

he is using a glitchy freearc instead of using command line exe's to extract the bin folder...."

[V],Shroo,2010-05-27T19:13Z,Globe says he never comments under our torrents thats true but what he does is comes here and adds these Quality negative score ;D pathetic...

But the game sux balls, the controls are awkward and you cant even change them, you cant change or see the splitscreen multiplayer controls."
,mfczero,2010-06-10T10:57Z,"for the peeps with control issues as far as not being able to change in game settings if you have a gamepad or something get xpadder you can define a games controlls to your gamepad example ones that do not normally have these little features. now as far as some people having vid issues or whatever make sure to read the ""note"" in torrent description. if that is the issue than instead of just complaining and not helping with it give your system specs like windows 7 x64 with ati 5xxx gfx card. that is an example. this makes it much easier to determine if it is a rip issue or a system issue.
