[V],pluto999,2010-05-28T17:18Z,I have a question which tv show you prefer the most?
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-28T17:37Z,"I followed few recent: Monk, Castle, Lost, ""24"", FF, Ashes to ashes, Mentalist and In plain sight. TBBT of comedy-shows.
But, they wasn't my 'all-time-favored', these are ""dead"" now - Firefly and Veronica Mars. Followed by Life on Mars, 4400, Journeyman, BSG and StarTrek Enterprise. Pretty colorful, right?"
,hkoraddi,2010-05-28T18:12Z,well i'm really interested to see out for 4400 but all big files together will make around 20gb do u know any small file rips........
[V],pluto999,2010-05-28T18:34Z,thanks..
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-28T19:11Z,"@hkoraddi: Yeah, but I wanted badly enough to split downloads during three months. Back then, I payed by the traffic. I can send you a .dlc of DVDrips, alive, and upped by on of my favored uploaders.
I hope you can open some junk-mail account where I can send attachment (few kB .dlc) for free and fast as hell MU."
