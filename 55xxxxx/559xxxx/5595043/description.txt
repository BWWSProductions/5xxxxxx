This isn't a personal favorite list.
This is from the CD top 100 Techno.
I have spent weeks to get all the CDs in place but here U got it.
The reason I didn't put every Vol in one torrents is beacause it was to big for a reason.
Then I tried Vol 1-9 and that was also to big.
Then I tried Vol 1-6 and that worked :D
So I will put a link here for U who wants Vol. 1-6 7-12 and 13-18 : )
