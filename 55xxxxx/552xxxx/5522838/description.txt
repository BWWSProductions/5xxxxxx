Hunting The Zodiac by John Mikulenka

A new team is on the case.

Hunting The Zodiac is a 63-minute time capsule of the unsolved serial-murder case that has haunted investigators since the late 1960s.

Shot in 2001-02 â€” and featuring more than 8 minutes of rare archival footage from the earliest days of the Zodiac investigation â€” the film chronicles a turning point in the hunt for the psychopath who killed at least 5 people in the San Francisco Bay Area and mailed more than a dozen bizarre letters and coded messages to local newspapers.

HTZ includes extensive interviews with the last two homicide detectives to be assigned to the case. But the film's main focus is on a new breed of Zodiac investigator â€” retirees, nurses, librarians, massage therapists, bakers, factory managers, pilots, interior decorators. These amateur detectives are dedicating vast amounts of their time and money to pursue a killer who, so far, has kept his promise to never be caught.

After decades of frustration, hunting the Zodiac is barely a part-time job for the professional detectives. But for the amateurs, it's a full-time obsession.
