Python is a remarkably powerful dynamic programming language that is used in a wide variety of application domains. Python is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Ruby, Scheme or Java. Some of its key distinguishing features include:

    * very clear, readable syntax
    * strong introspection capabilities
    * intuitive object orientation
    * natural expression of procedural code
    * full modularity, supporting hierarchical packages
    * exception-based error handling
    * very high level dynamic data types
    * extensive standard libraries and third party modules for virtually every task
    * embeddable within applications as a scripting interface
