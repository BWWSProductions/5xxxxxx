Man, I know a bunch of programs that do that but why is it split in the first place? Can U explain the reason? Please try and then give advice. Thank you.

@ HyacintheR

Confirmed!"
,pr0w3ss,2010-05-09T01:20Z,its split because these are the scene rules.
,Nickotak,2010-05-14T17:16Z,"It's split because....well because the uploader felt like splitting it. Nevermind why it's split, just fix it yourself if you want to. Dont complain about a free movie with good quality"

Quite the little bitch, aren't we. 

Didn't you notice that sconlan was trying to help instead of giving the ""stop bitching, it's free"" line? sconlan must have mistakenly thought you could figure out all by yourself why it's split in 2.

I'll try to explain it to you, and will type real slow, since you prolly cain't reed too fast.

A C/D is 700Mb. 2 C/Ds give you 1400Mb of storage, or 1.4Gb, which is enough to fit 1.37Gb of data.

Why not compress the movie to 700Mb and be done with it? It's a question of quality. 

There's tons of 700Mb movie torrents out there, so why not try one of those? 

So, stop bitchin'; it's free!

BTW, thank you uploader. "
