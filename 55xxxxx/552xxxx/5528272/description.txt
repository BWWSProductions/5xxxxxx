          :::::[ PLOT SUMMARY ]::::          
       5150 ELM'S WAY is located at the        
       end of a quiet street in a small       
          town. When Yannick fell off his           
           bike, he knocked at the door of            
           the Beaulieu residence so he could         
           clean the blood off his hands. But         
           Jack Beaulieu and his family had           
           other plans for Ian. Beaulieu is a         
           righteous psychopath and fanatic           
           chess player who wants to rid the          
           world of evil. And even though Ian         
           has done nothing wrong, he is              
           beaten, tortured and tormented             
           before Beaulieu makes him an               
          offer: win at chess and he is free         
         to go. And so Ian is now a pawn in         
     Beaulieu 's game.
