,lavato,2010-05-07T03:19Z,one suggestion: The slider of the page is black and hard to see. Il will be good if you can make more visible like a red. Thanks for your great work

,altoiddealer,2010-05-22T17:42Z,^Please disregard my comment above. Just noticed this is for MAC... and its probably  a full installation of normal iTunes w/the skin anyway
