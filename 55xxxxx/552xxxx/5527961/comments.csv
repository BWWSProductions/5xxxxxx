,jon4fun,2010-05-03T04:14Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the [warning] and the eoncode/upload.

You are LEGEND! A 1GB screener to 158MB quark. You are the Man, the Legend, the genius, the 20-40.

Now.... Only hope the movie has been worth tht wait  BUT that is not your issue.

Thank you.

Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-05-03T04:27Z,"@ ALL Moderators. Please the uploader a green-skull OR at least give him the chance to prove that he is not one of the spammers or DOSA or whtatever has been going on for the last week.

@ FANS of 20-40 - Please contact moderator and ask them to give green skull (VIP STATUS) to 20-40. 
Only do this if YOU believe he deserves to be a VIP member of TPB and so won't get blocked , with hundreds of others, as happened on week of 26th April. At least 3 times for upto 48+ hours.

I have contacted them through the [Conact Us] area and then [Fan Mail]. If anyone knows a better way please post every few posts so it isn't missed.

I am a massive fan and I think it is a disgtrace that he couldn't upload BUT that is ONLY my opinion.

For the invention of the [quark format] alone they should be handing out live time membership and awards.

Cheers
Jon"

[V],twentyforty,2010-05-03T08:46Z,"@MeInc.: [quark]s never have Sample, on weird way - they are - the sample. 
For what is worth, I watched Eli [quark] last night on my system: Windows Media Player/Haali splitter/CoreCodec/DivX7 AAC on 1024x768, hooked to stereo rack. Everything as I have recommended before for any MP4 playback. I moved in the sofa, 6 feet away and - enjoyed every minute of the movie and  - [quark] encoding.
However, I hope that one (and you) can relate ridiculously small file-size of 157MB with what could be expected and benefits for the people on 5 kB/s download ""speed"" or very limited budget."
,Lovejam,2010-05-03T08:48Z,"WOW!
Looks pretty damn good for being such a small file.
Watched it on a 15.6"" screen and it looked kinda like old film quality but not pixelated.
Thanks. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-03T09:00Z,"@Jon: Just one thing - Life on Mars S01E01 input (BluRay.720p) was 3.03 GB.
My encoding (720p.H264) is 0.348 GB.
Well, size ""gain"" is even bigger. And no degradation at all - in quality AND frame-size (both are 1280x720)."
[T],houruoha,2010-05-03T09:30Z,"@moderator 
Green Skull for 2040"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-03T10:49Z,"@zmacdaddy8: Yes, this week as [quark] because of the duration (double)."
,cecile77,2010-05-08T19:57Z,"Great movie, I will recommend and as usual great quality and fast download.
Thanks 20/40!!!
ps: sent a mail to ask for the green skull, you so deserve it!!!"
