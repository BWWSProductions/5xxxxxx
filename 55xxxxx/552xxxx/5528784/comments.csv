,BinaryIctus,2010-05-03T18:24Z,Works like a charm. Thanks!
,Norrisade,2010-05-03T18:55Z,"Are there any torrents with After Effects serials?

Can't seem to find any."
,RitchieRich,2010-05-03T19:05Z,"@iluvwarez
You should install it as a trial first.

@BinaryIctus
You're welcome. Enjoy it.

@Norrisade
Download After Effects as a trial then when you open it try to use one of the Master Collection serials. That has worked for some people."
,Norrisade,2010-05-03T20:37Z,it worked! thanks man
,RitchieRich,2010-05-03T23:56Z,"@Norrisade

You're welcome!"
,hiddepolen,2010-05-04T00:04Z,"Thx, works great!
Nice upload, seeding now..."
,RitchieRich,2010-05-04T02:42Z,"@iluvwarez

I believe the Live won't work because as you have found out it checks to see if your valid when you try to connect to Live. 

Are you upgrading from CS4? If so, you need to completely remove any hint of CS4. I would try to uninstall everything and start again fresh. This time don't try to connect to Live. If that still doesn't work I'd recommend http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5523885/Adobe_Creative_Suite_CS5_Master_Collection__32_amp_64bit_Keygen[WL. His method has worked for others. "
,sk1nnycowboy,2010-05-04T03:44Z,Works as advertised. Thanks RR!
,RitchieRich,2010-05-04T04:45Z,"@iluvwarez

I have confirmed, if you try to use Adobe Live it will check your serial to see if it's valid. As for right now if you want to use cracked/hacked Adobe software don't use Live.

I hope everything else works out for you."
,RitchieRich,2010-05-04T05:07Z,"@iluvwarez

This torrent is not garbage. Why has it worked for everyone else except you?? When you uninstall software there are still traces of folders and files in your computer. You must remove those remaining files and do a fresh install.

May I recommend you try http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5522760/ADOBE_CS5_CLEAN_INSTALL_TOOLKIT. It may help remove all those unwanted files left behind."
,yautja47,2010-05-04T14:12Z,Thanks ritchie. it works except for illustrator. iluvwarez is right. something wrong with illustrator but who uses that? as long as dreamweaver flash and photoshop work i can live with that
,sffhsnsfnsfnsfg,2010-05-04T19:02Z,"hey. my xampp doesnt work after i run the .exe !! how can i fix this??
thx"
,RitchieRich,2010-05-04T20:36Z,"@iluvwarez

I saw this torrent on Demonoid and had yet to see it here on The Pirate Bay so I thought I'd be nice and bring it over. I had no idea that it was already posted. I take no credit for this but like I said i was just trying to help you guys out."
,sffhsnsfnsfnsfg,2010-05-04T23:15Z,"sry. my first post wasn t really informativ.
i try to connect to localhost, but every time a message pops up. it says that the browser is unable to connect to the server. would somebody help me, pls. i need this for my school...."

jo have to comment out the line with localhost in your host (C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\ or %systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\) document if you have the same porblem with xampp.

so, works fine...."
,sffhsnsfnsfnsfg,2010-05-04T23:36Z,"fixed the problem!!

C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\ or %systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\

delete the line 0.0.0.0       localhost 
or comment it out. (host-document)"
,sffhsnsfnsfnsfg,2010-05-05T18:42Z,iluvwarez you are a boon. this works fine. the problem is the user and not the crack.
,RitchieRich,2010-05-05T19:19Z,"@sffhsnsfnsfnsfg

THANK YOU!!!! :)"
,sffhsnsfnsfnsfg,2010-05-05T20:44Z,"XAMPPPPPPPPP
not your problem, or? 

Perhaps it is not a Activator, just a activation-blocker. But thats good enough for me. if you want the whole complexity, BUY IT!!
as it would be possible to use online-services with a cracked software. i never found something that does this."
,Thooty,2010-05-09T01:03Z,"Works it!
Thx man ;)"
,drap54,2010-05-15T06:25Z,"thanks, it works!!!"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-05-24T07:45Z,thanx for the up RitchieRich ...worked flawlessly on my Win 7 x64 Ultimate (ppl remember to run as Admin)
,ltmayo,2010-05-27T15:37Z,"I can confirm that on Windows 7 64bit Illustrator is not activated, everything else works fine, even After Effects. As soon as you bring focus to the Illustrator window it crashes and when it's launching it says ""Tryout"" in the title."
,LordVeldrin,2010-05-28T13:07Z,"@sffhsnsfnsfnsfg: ""as it would be possible to use online-services with a cracked software. i never found something that does this.""

actually, my CS4 master collection is working 100% AND i can use it's own updater to have it update itself. and i got CS4 from this place as well. and that ain't the only software i've seen fooling the server. so i wouldn't be surprised at all if eventually someone would make it happen on CS5 too. just need to keep looking."
,suprem kite,2010-06-02T01:36Z,"I have windows 7 64bit Professional and all tools are working on my end. Including Illustrator and After Effects. 

On the other hand the updater is now saying there are updates for some programs in the suite. Is it safe to update or not, it was with my cs4 suite so I am hoping that this will be able to also."
,handelaar,2010-06-03T17:58Z,"If you google with this:

@ ltmayo
it only says that it's a tryout on the splash screen when i start the program,but when i opened it and i hover my mouse on the icon on the taskbar it just says Adobe Illustrator CS5."
,Eastcoast_pirate,2010-06-12T21:11Z,"I'm running Windows 7 32 bit and mine works PERFECT! I even updated it and everything works great. You just follow the instructions and make sure you comment out localhost with these // before and after it and you should be all good.

Thanks a lot RitchieRich you da man."
,ggdogg,2010-06-20T02:05Z,"Thanks for uploading on TPB. worked perfectly, i used a master collection serial for premiere pro because there weren't any other serials listed for it. may i ask why master collection serials work for single adobe products, if anyone has an idea why? "

,bullit199,2010-09-15T04:49Z,Works! I had CS5 programs telling me the trial period was over. This program runs and does all the work for you. AVG didn't pick up any viruses or malware either. I'm back in business.
,lobitaychase,2010-09-18T08:47Z,"uhm .... why state to ""have to comment out the line with localhost in your host (C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc""

and yet NOT say WHICH file ""exactly"" to edit by commenting out

Can you specified which file to edit (comment out)??

Quick question: On the mac version you recommended to run the script before installing adobe. With this version you wrote to install adobe first and then run the script. Is this correct?

Thanks again for the awesome share!"
