(1981) Steven Bochco had racked up over 15 years of writing and producing credits when he practically revolutionized the cop drama with this groundbreaking series, an ensemble serial set in an unidentified inner city precinct. Daniel J. Travanti stars as Precinct Captain Frank Furillo, Michael Conrad delivers the show's trademark like â€œLetâ€™s be careful out thereâ€ at the end of every morning roll call, Veronica Hamel and Barbara Bosson are women in Furillo's life, and the squad is filled out by Michael Warren, Charles Haid, Bruce Weitz, Joe Spano, Taurean Blacque, Kiel Martin, Rene Enriquez, Betty Thomas, Ed Marinaro (who joins the cast mid-season) and James B. Sikking.
