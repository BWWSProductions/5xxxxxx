Another in Albert Collins's series of fine 1970s and '80s releases on Alligator Records, Frostbite gives Collins fans more of what they've come to expect--raw, rootsy blues and unparalleled guitar playing. Collins's approach to the blues guitar is distinctive, and he alternates between high, singing leads and echoey, low-end motifs, manipulating space and drawing his phrases out with unusual rhythmic variation. His tone, too, is unique; it is heavy, dark, and somewhat cool (which gave rise to his "Iceman" moniker). All of these characteristics are on full display here.
