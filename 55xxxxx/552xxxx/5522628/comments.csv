Lame guys......"
[V],pluto999,2010-04-30T22:23Z,@RiddlerA: Could you tell me the mod who gave you green & pink skull?
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-01T03:18Z,RiddlerA doesn't make these files.  they are just posted here after he grabs them RS sites and such.  So asking him to make 360p is useless since they aren't made by him.
,vrthenite,2010-05-01T07:03Z,"Really been looking for this. Thanks for uploading. But 720p is distorting the image. Just take the sample and play in 50% zoom down and see the difference. A 360p would have been better for this size. The same for your avatar bdrip too.

It would be great if you can do it as 360p."
[V],pluto999,2010-05-01T07:38Z,@poppedtart: Completely agree with you but still he is doing a good job..

,Allgood79,2011-01-15T13:34Z,"Thanks for this Riddler.

Since I read The crow graphic novel, I've been searching all over for this and now I've started watching samurai 7, I wanted a bit more of the original back story.

This d/l is way quicker than all the others I've found.

Will return with a review for you all!"
