 can u explain pls how can i open a dat file?"
,scbjmshpv,2010-05-28T03:47Z,You guys should look at the seeders since he's the only one seeding atm you will get stuck at the max of how majority of ppl have downloaded so give it some time and you'll be able to finish it. and by the looks of it it might take a week or so depending on how many are downloading it. i suggest stop downloading for one or two days (the one who are at max of 55 or so %) and restart and you'll give everyone more and faster chance of finishing including saving your bandwith.

,rawluck,2010-12-01T13:04Z,"At least be appreciative to the person who is putting lots of effort in uploading contents so that everyone can enjoy. Complaining of speed, first we should check our own seeding (uploading) speed. Until we all start uploading at a decent speed, we are not going to get the SPEEEED that you always want. So, plz seed after downloading as much as you can."
