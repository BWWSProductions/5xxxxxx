,WiK1d,2011-03-06T19:08Z,Hi Ekarth22. Any chance you could upload the crack for v4? I'm struggling to download it off the only site available.

,acceptthis1,2011-04-10T23:16Z,I downloaded the demo from the link which takes you to the website. I downloaded the business trial demo and installed it. I then downloaded this torrent and copied and pasted both the .exe file and the additional dll file. I di this twice and it came back with a message 'missing ter15.dll file' and suggested reinstalling it. So it clearly does not work!
