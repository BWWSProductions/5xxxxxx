When I installed this on a ''fresh''' installation of
WinXP pro,AVG detected malware,
and I can't log in as admin...
The system is not running very well.
I am sure that I typed right my pass,
caps lock,numb.lock,change lang. ect.
I don't know if it is a false alarm,
the uploader is trusted,right ?
but sth is going on ...
I am willing to hear other users to comment ...
