The film is a brilliant narrative about a man whose life was not only full of sorrow, but also of awesome will power and, mainly, great artistic splendor.

By the the time such wonderful story-telling ends, you find yourself with an immense urgency to seize all the opportunities of life - before it's too late.

The interesting point about this movie is that, although comprising the story of a pianist, in fact one does not even have to like classical music to feel completely elated by it. If you are a Bach fan, however, I tell you the music is so fantastic that it alone would be certainly worth your while.
