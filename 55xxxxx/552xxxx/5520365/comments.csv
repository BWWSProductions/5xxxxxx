,gkotse,2010-04-30T11:56Z,"IPIIMIP, one solution is to install K-Lite Codec Pack Full.
If you do it, you will be able to play MKV files with Media Player Classic Homecinema, which will be installed too.
And once you have watched an episode in 1100MB MKVs, you won't go back to 350MB AVIs."
,b00g,2010-04-30T14:13Z,the best solution is to use VLC media player...
,roua-mat,2010-04-30T15:44Z,I have installed K-Lite etc and it was ok with Media Player Classic.  The only problem is that I can't adjust the subtitles I want (greek) There wasn't any problem with VLC and the subtitles so far.  Any ideas?
,Mahgoul,2010-04-30T18:58Z,@IPIIMIP Get VLC Player... its the best it plays anything
,Mahgoul,2010-04-30T18:59Z,@roua-mat VLC player... never had trouble with subs there
