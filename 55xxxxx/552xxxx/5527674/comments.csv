I want to ask though, why is this torrent the save size (2.7GB) like the TvTeam one? This is your own capture, right?"
,mgicptato,2010-05-02T20:48Z,"lol, yes, this is my own capture. completely dirrefent from the tvteam one

audio on this is DD 5.1 tvteam is 2.0 stereo according to their description

framerate on this is 59.94 tvteam is 29.97

is was a coincidence that video and audio bitrates are similar but completely different files

i only upload my own caps"

this is 1 hour 28 mins, tvteam is 1 hour 19 mins
