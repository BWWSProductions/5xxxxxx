Look for it in the show info text file.

It is simply: 
my username

blogspot
dott
com"

No, no vacation.  Those things cost money!

The reason I wasn't uploading here was that TPB was having a problem with their CAPTCHA process, which made it impossible for me to upload.  I was upping the Jones torrents elsewhere [as I typically do anyway] but it is grand to be back here.

Check out the blog I have launched to help keep up with where my torrents are uploaded, etc. It is at

CAPTCHA was fixed as of 10-12 hours ago, and I was able to upload this torrent.

Unfortunately, right now it is once again not working.

I'm hoping it will be fixed, again, soon enough for me to upload today's show here in a timely manner.  But if you DON""T see it here when you would normally expect to, do check my blog.
