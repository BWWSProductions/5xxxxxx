Great Torrent!"
,LumFan,2010-09-06T06:11Z,"Character Generator is a program that needs to be installed on your computer to work properly, and it is free to use up to character level 3.  After that you need to subscribe with Wizards of the Coast (paid subscription).

And there should be an up to date file for the 2008 D&D Rewards cards that does not have a password.  That file is freely available on the Wizards website.  The password for the old file is RPGARewards08 (case sensitive)."
