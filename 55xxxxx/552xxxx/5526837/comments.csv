,iwilleatu,2010-05-02T22:12Z,hey man! don't be a dick to the uploader! he doesn't have to give you (or anyone) shit! so be nice! thanks djdevastate
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2010-05-03T01:29Z,repacks will come in time just be patient im busy with so many games at the minute i just aint got the time plus being a lone parent with 2 girls aged 1 and 3 i do a miracle just getting these games to ya 
,iCE_DiCE,2010-05-03T17:20Z,"Why are you that pissed off like that? I'm just only saying that a big pack with these little games would be much more easy for everyone. djDEVASTATE would seed just the pack, and everyone would take exactly what they need from there. But that's just my opinion, do as you like."

if i did that mate i would be the only person seeding 100% of the torrent.
i ask people to seed because if i get a hard drive failiure or a bad virus then these torrents will be lost and all my work with it  ive looked at your user profile and noticed that you have never uploaded a torrent if you want to make packs of my torrents and upload them feel free to do that it might earn you a skull you never know"
,BIGJUICYWORM,2012-04-14T08:55Z,please someone seed im stuck at 42% from over a month ago.
