Stakker Humanoid is an acid house track by Humanoid released in 1988 by the London based label Westside Records.

The project behind the track started out with Stakker, a collaborative project by the video artists Mark McClean and Colin Scott. They needed music to support their video and contacted Brian Dougans. They sent a demo video tape containing graphics and some music to Morgan Khan who (although didnâ€™t appreciate the video) invited Brian Dougans to record 2 demos at his Dance Studios in Ealing London. He probably made use of the Roland TB-303 synthesizer and the Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer. The Evil Otto sample â€œHumanoidâ€ from the videogame Berzerk provided the name of the track.

The track was originally called â€œHumanoidâ€ to be put out by Stakker through Morgan Khans label Westside Records, though Morgan released it as â€œStakker Humanoidâ€ by â€œHumanoidâ€ to avoid copyright issues. A dispute had arisen between Brian Dougans and Colin Scott / Mark McClean and before the record was in the shops, Stakker and Brian Dougans split, ending their working relationship which had lasted just over a year. However Mark McClean and Brian Dougans were to continue working together on The Future Sound of London project.
