The depth of their love runs so deep that it continues to
penetrate her soul long after he is gone.

Emily's husband Brian passed away two years ago, but she
has not been able to move on with her life. She is still
haunted by his ghost -- she sees him watching her, she hears
him calling her, and she feels him inside of her. Emily is
tormented by An Eternal Love.
