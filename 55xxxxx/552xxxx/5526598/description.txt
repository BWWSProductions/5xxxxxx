The Sword in the Stone is a 1963 animated  fantasy comedy film, produced by Walt Disney originally released to theaters on December 25, 1963. The eighteenth animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics, it was the last Disney animated feature released while Walt Disney was alive.

It is part of the 'English Cycle' of Disney animated films, which include Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, 101 Dalmatians, The Jungle Book, Robin Hood, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and The Rescuers.

The film is based on the novel of the same name, at first published in 1938 as a single novel. It was then later republished in 1958 as the first book of T. H. Whiteâ€™s tetralogy The Once and Future King. From Merlinâ€™s statement that The Times will not come out for another 1200 years, it may be extrapolated that the film is set circa A.D. 558.
