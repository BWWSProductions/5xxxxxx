,apertur3,2010-05-18T20:08Z,"The CD burned correctly with IMGburn, but I can't get the CD audio to play in a normal CD player, like I used to be able to with my TIM 3.0 CD.  Any idea what might be wrong?"
,elektronik_supersonik,2010-05-20T14:24Z,"Hmm, that's strange indeed. As far as I understand, it's just a regular Mixed Mode image, that is, Track 01 is the Data track and the following ones are Audio.

So you get the audio to work with a CD player software and the game?"
,elektronik_supersonik,2010-05-20T14:33Z,"As far as I remember, newer CD players skip the data track automatically. Some interpret the data track as audio, resulting in very nasty noise. And others play the data track, but don't output any audio.

I'll take a look at it when I return from my trip."
