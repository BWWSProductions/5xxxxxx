,jersson,2010-05-01T19:25Z,"Yepp, this is the best uninstaller of them all, thank you, very good"
,giorgiof59,2010-05-01T20:17Z,"May I have a bit more instructions? What is the sequence of which programs to run? After installation of yusetup2010 (in the Exe prog folder) if I run urmain I get an error 126 (cannot find import;DLL, file rtl70.bpl). When I run the Keygen program the key is not accpted. 
What am I doing wrong? I am on Win 7.
Thanks in advance"
,mygirlscock,2010-05-02T02:51Z,"Thank for the best uninstaller,"
,giorgiof59,2010-05-02T18:24Z,"Thanks a lot, I managed to install it. I was actually running the patch, not replacing it in the program directory. I did not understand the instructions, very short for me.

Thanks a lot for your help"
,nodules,2010-05-07T11:12Z,"First, thanks a lot DeGun for all your torrent files !

Then concerning this one even if I followed all the above instruction I still have some troubles.

I had same error message 126 as giorgiof59 and so install Delphi 7 Package with D70_Installer.exe from your link. Tells me installation is ok, excepted that I'm not able to find the 3 files in systems32 where it was supposed to installed them.

So, now when running the pach I obtain a new error message : ""Access violation at 0x77118663 (tried to write to 0x00090FC8), programm terminated""

Does someone know how to avoid that ?
(on windows7-64bit)

Thanks in advance !"
,nodules,2010-05-07T11:31Z,"One more question :
I'd better use YourUninstaller or TotalUninstall ?"
,whome1010,2010-05-09T11:29Z,many tnx....i also needed to install Borland Delphi 7 Package Installer....now working perfectly :-) 
,danpharoah,2010-05-09T14:14Z,sorry if im being thick but which file do i copy/paste to directory please?
,nodules,2010-05-11T17:39Z,"Thanks degun works well now !
Actually I switched the urmain copy in program folder that's why it didn't work at all.

,murrambingi,2011-01-19T01:45Z,"posting back, after a week i was looking through my quarantined apps in Malwarebytes and it so happens that Malwarebytes has quarantined a file from this program, it may be nothing but it says it is a Trojan agent, nothing suspicious has occurred but i will keep an eye on it, and yes Malwarebytes is a very good anti-malware/adware program.
