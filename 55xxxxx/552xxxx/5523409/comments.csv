,tiki-tiki,2010-05-01T15:13Z,i have a problem too.. it doesnt work with either exe's.....any solutions?
,Fidellio,2010-05-01T16:36Z,"Yep, same problem here. First off my system wouldn't let me copy the .dll file, so i had to manually move it. If you get that same problem, do that. Haha

Second, i tried to run it from the conviction_game original, and it ran the game just like it did without the crack. Required the entry of a key and a login. 

Third, i tried it with the cracked .exe. Instead i got a Ubisoft Game Launcher Error: Error code 2.

If this helps anyone, or if i can get some help, it'd be greatly appreciated."
,nielsvv,2010-05-01T16:57Z,"It works for me.!!!

copy the crack files in the ubisoft folder (src-> system)
Look out!! keep the original and the cracked conviction_game.exe in the folder!!!

go to ubisoft game launcher and replace the ubiorbtapi_r2.dll from the crack.

go back to the system file and press the gu.exe

ENJOY!!"
,nielsvv,2010-05-01T16:58Z,fidellio go to ubisoft game launcher and replace the ubiorbtapi_r2.dll from the crack.
,Kapoon,2010-05-01T17:02Z,"Niels what do you mean with keep them both in the folder, you can't or you have to rename one of them.


I have the dame problem here if replace the original exe and copy all the cracked files i get a "" ULA has stopped working ""  crash.

And if i don't and keep the original exe and copy all the other cracked files (besides the cracked exe) it will ask me for a key.

I hope i'm not beeing ignorant here and missing something."
,Kapoon,2010-05-01T17:05Z,"My god niels ur a lifesaver, thx bro"
,nielsvv,2010-05-01T17:07Z,"you have to rename it indeed Kapoon,  so you have conviction_game1 and conviction_game2

i cant explain the crash, this worked also with my friend so it does work"
,Kapoon,2010-05-01T17:27Z,Oh my god niels thank you you're a lifesaver xD
,Kapoon,2010-05-01T17:28Z,It's working now everyone who has the crash replace all the files expect the original exe and then do what niels said.
,JuggernautOfWar,2010-05-01T18:59Z,This doesn't work for me. I replaced the game files with the crack files. I replaced the ubisoft game launcher files with the crack files. No dice. Error code 2 or a missing .dll file when it's clearly right there in the folder.
,Heindrik,2010-05-01T20:40Z,How to manuel put the Dll file in the folder? because it keeps saying i dont have permission and im only user / adminstrator on the PC
,Heindrik,2010-05-01T20:45Z,"okay managed to get the DLL in...

Starting to get ticked off..."
,TheGumz,2010-05-01T22:34Z,"Niels, what do you mean when you say Ubisoft game launcher, i cant find any folder named that"
,markokv95,2010-05-01T23:30Z,Does the crack has viruses
,Smellykimchi,2010-05-02T05:50Z,Game and crack work but i have a issue with sound. Sometimes when they talk i can't hear them. can any1 help me out?
,sus2912,2010-05-02T07:51Z,"hey guys what the diff btw these two cracks??
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5525467/
and this one 
plz tell me somebody can i play sp in both crack or sp in this one and multi in that one"
,Fidellio,2010-05-02T08:45Z,"I did as i was told, placed the .dll file in the game launcher folder... I even reinstalled the whole game and repeated the process in listed order - still nothing.

I get the Game Error 2 again. :("
,Fidellio,2010-05-02T08:46Z,"Also, TheGumz, it's completely outside of the Splinter Cell folder. It should be inside of the Ubisoft folder in Program Files(x86 if you have a 64 bit OS). Once in there, probably the last file, will be the launcher. Hope that helps."
,sus2912,2010-05-02T13:55Z,"its working perfectly thanks a lot 
skidrow u rock"

I have the same problem.can u tell me how to move it?thnks"
,centu233,2010-05-02T16:30Z,ok done it..sorry
,AndyKiller7,2010-05-02T16:36Z,"The skidrow crack for Conviction is virused.The .dll file is a win32something virus.Is there any clean crack?
This crack was released with a virus with intention or by stupidity?
The same thing happened with Just cause 2 and Bionic commando.A crack without a virus has never appeared for them.
If somebody knows something please tell."
,Fidellio,2010-05-02T17:58Z,"Because of what the crack does (and i'm not playing smarter than i am, i have no idea what that is) often times virus protection software gives it a false positive. The cracks are indeed NOT viruses, most of the time."
,AwTin,2010-05-02T19:25Z,"SOLUTION FOR ERROR CODE 2:

1. Disable antivirus software or add path exceptions to c:\program files\ubisoft under the settings for your antivirus program.

2. Only copy the .dll file of the crack.  The GU and .exe files are not necessary.  

BUT: make sure you copy the .dll file into BOTH the 'system' folder and the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder.

Yay!!!"
,Heindrik,2010-05-02T21:58Z,"The GU.exe does nothing... Some window pops up and away in like a half second but nothing ever happens..

When i press convection_game.exe it ""approves system"" and when its 2 blocks in the loading bar windows says ""Convicion_game.exe stopped working"".

Im kinda stuck now.

I replaced all files... Also in the Ubisoft launcher...

I put in both the original and the new crack of Conviction_game.exe and none of the 2 works. they both crash when approving system.

I tried shutting down Anti virus and launch but dident make a difference...

So now im stuck.. And it seems no one else are having my issues.."
,AwTin,2010-05-02T22:36Z,"@Heindrik

I'm guessing there's a compatibility issue with your computer.  Make sure you meet the minimum system requirements."
,tomashek,2010-05-03T19:16Z,"i have same problem as Heindrik

my pc: i7-920, 4gb ram, GTX260"
,AwTin,2010-05-04T00:22Z,@Heindrik / Did you just shut down your antivirus without doing a clean install afterwards? It's worth a try I guess.  Antivirus programs can block access to files.
,beetlespin,2010-05-04T00:24Z,"Has anyone experienced a problem with the game actual loading, but you get to a black screen where 3 little round circles in the lower right hand corner rotate in a triangular pattern? For 45 mins I waited and the game never came to a menu screen. I have followed all various ways of trying to start the game. "
,AwTin,2010-05-04T04:04Z,@beetlespin / Perhaps make sure your video drivers are up to date?

can some one help us"
,Fredrik-88,2010-05-04T18:00Z,To everyone woth system approve problems: Delete or rename systemdetection.dll in the system folder. Worked for me but the game freezes from time to time but it starts again after a while.
,rmbsvas,2010-05-04T18:52Z,Fredrik-88 i have the same problem with heindrik and ghaonhao.i renamed the dll u r saying but it doesn't even start when i've done it!!!
,rmbsvas,2010-05-04T18:53Z,i have 1 question tho...should i copy the dll file from skidrow into the system file of the dvd and the game launcher or only to the game launcher?
,Fredrik-88,2010-05-04T21:04Z,"rmbsvas Well it should come up a file missing thing but then the game should start, it worked for me. I can't say anymore because i don't know more. maybe you have a program that is incompatible with the game. "
,MoXo8,2010-05-04T21:07Z,"i too am having the same problem as Heindrik and some other guys... apparently, if you have avg as av, like me, you might as well forget about playing this game... at least in my case i won't disable avg, unnistall the game, and then reinstall it and keep avg disabled just so i can play it...."
,icecold87,2010-05-05T13:58Z,"here what you need to do.
just copy the ubiorbitapi_r2.dll
in the games folder. if you can`t, thats because of your anti virus program.
here a hint for dose ho have AVG.
open avg-hit tools-advanced settings-excluded files-add there a ubiorbitapi_r2.dll file-applay it-
ok.and its done,enjoy."
,MN121MN,2010-05-08T17:15Z,"So let me get this straight when I have AVG
Install as normal
Copy dll. only or copy all of the cracked contents?
Then what???"

Blank page when entering (running gu.exe)
Running the normal exe only gives the same error (Ubisoftlauncher 2 or something)

,MakahNation,2010-05-11T04:05Z,"@MN121MN

Don't worry bro, your not alone. I got the same bullshit error and followed the directions exactly. This is my second skidrow crack I tried using and both time an error reads Ubisoft Game Launcher Error: Error 2 right??? I don't know what the fuck is wrong but it's pissin me off and the people on this website don't like to help."
,Yenrock7,2010-05-24T14:46Z,"I can't seem to get this game working! am i missing something here?

*i copied the SKIDROW crack into src/system.

,Yenrock7,2010-05-25T15:53Z,"Got the game running, but it was short lived.
The game IS freezing every 10seconds or so, and then it moves again.

@Fredrik-88
did you found a way to fix this? please let me know if something came up, could really use some help."
,JAA0506,2010-05-29T14:57Z,"Those of you who are having ""Ubisoft Game Launcher: Error Code 2"" problems which ARE NOT fixed by re-installing the Ubisoft Game Launcher app, nor by updating your video drivers, it could be your AVG antivirus. You will need to set an exception path (see here: http://www.setupswarm.com/main/games/installation-guides/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction) so that AVG lets it work properly. DON'T blame SKIDROW, their patch works!"
