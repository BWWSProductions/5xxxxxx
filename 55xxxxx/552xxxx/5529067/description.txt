Abstract: Computer viruses are programs with the power to spread to millions of computers and carry out a number of unwanted tasks. 
The Internet is the worldâ€™s first global network and it is open to everyone, every moment of the day. Because the Internet is open 24 hours 
a day a number of different viruses can be carrying out attacks on computers all around the world at any given moment. Viruses are written 
for a number of reasons but most virus programmers are motivated either by financial or technical gains. A discrete and professional 
programmer can make large amounts of money for designing and programming a virus. A lot of computer viruses do not seem that bad and will 
only send messages to the user as a joke, but the prank computer virus is a thing of the past. The most dangerous type of virus is 
financially backed, well programmed, and will infect millions of computers without giving the computer users the slightest clue. What most 
people do not realize about computer viruses is the extent of their destruction and their unseen benefits.
