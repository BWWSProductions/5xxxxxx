PLOT
The Prince of Thieves encounters sorcery and CGI dragons in this action-fantasy hybrid, which aired on the SyFy Channel. The dragon in question is really the enchanted form of a woman (Katherine Isabelle) from another dimension, and in her scaly form, she killed the father of young Robin Hood. Flash forward a couple of decades, and the grown Robin (Robin Dunne) suffers a serious hitch in his take-from-the-rich-give-to-the-poor arrangement, courtesy of the evil Prince John (David Richmond-Peck) and the even more wicked Sheriff of Nottingham (Julian Sands, who consumes the scenery with relish), both of whom use the lady/dragon against him and his Merry Men. It's a novel idea, but executed with dreary pacing by actor-turned-director Peter DeLuise, rickety special effects, and dreadful acting by all save Sands and Erica Durance (Smallville's Lois Lane) as an action-ready Maid Marian.
