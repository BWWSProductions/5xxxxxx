"The psychology and life of Brazilian hitmen, common in the Northeast part of the country. In this particular case, the story 

revolves around a young and idealistic politician from Salvador, whom the enemies are eager to eliminate."

"When watching "Tocaia no Asfalto" you consequently ask yourself: Where has Brazilian and specially Baiano Cinema gone? It's 

a simple naive story trapped in a beautiful movie. The characters are crude and the theme is kinda dated, but everything is 

recognizable. The beautiful landscape from Salvador appear as never seen since previous "a Grande Feira" in all it's beauty. 

The innocence of the Hit-man - that won't shoot his victim and consequently save his life because he is inside a church - is 

very humane. After seen this very significant piece of Brazilian Cinema, I wonder if there shouldn't be more of it. Why has 

it stopped? It looks promising - maybe even more than other cinemas from other countries - but where is it? It faded, just 

like the life of the hit-man. Perhaps that's the problem. We where as innocent as he was." Quotes from IMDB.
