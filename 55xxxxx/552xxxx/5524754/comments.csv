,DASFF,2010-11-23T10:17Z,"Hey a WHOLE SCENE is missing - between Danny's vision and family's drive to Overlook hotel there is no scene with Danny, his mother and a doctor!"
,ad.rien,2010-12-23T02:08Z,This is the european version. Cut by Kubrick. Shorter than the US version. (3 or 4 shot missing and the doctor's scene missing)

Don't download if you're looking for the North American version."
