The reason people are repeating seed is that it's the only English word these people have learned.

TPB really should introduce an auto-banning system triggered on any word beginning with the letter 's' followed by two or more 'e' characters followed by one or more 'd'-characters. 

Users which type such words more than three times per month should be kicked from the system and have their IP blocked from creating new accounts for 3 months. 

That would solve two things:
1. Getting rid of idiots
2. Speeding up the torrents since the banned idiots (likely also leechers and/or non-valuable peers) no longer consume limited network resources in swarms."

now click on the exe file of splinter cell and play the fucking game....if u need and want to play co-op or multi then u need to have a real account in ubisoft if u have one then open ini file of skidrow and change the name and password there with ur account details after that u can play multi also but remember lan will not work so go to join match and then host a private match in that invite friends to play with u
to add friends in the menu click add friends thats it
if u are gettin the server error that means u havent copied the crack correctly and if u r gettin the error 2 code problem that means ur antivirus is stoping the r2 file from running add it to the list of allowed program and it should work

I can run most any game on high settings at nice FPS but this, even near the lowest of settings, runs worse than anything I've ever seen. It doesn?t even let me choose a resolution above 420P and no FPS over 15 can be achieved on my system, not to mention epic lag....and I can run MW2 maxed out fine. Only thing I can say is, FAIL!"

,bLoWsMokE,2010-05-10T19:03Z,"Yeah i have the missing textures problems that a lot of ati users arte having only I have Nvidia. One forum suggested puytting the executables on the exceptions list for IZ3D for that worked for him.... howebver I cannot find anything that even comes close to being IZ3D on my comp-uter ANYWHERE....

When I installed the 1.02 patch from skidrow it made th9ings worse.... it gave me an 800x600 resolution and when I change it to a high o0ne it changes but it stayes ion the same position as if it were still on 800x600 down to one corner of the sc4reen leaving the rest of the monitor empty........

DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR GETTING THE TEXTURES TO SHOW UP AND/OR know where I can find the properties of the IZ3D driver so I can try that o0ut...... I hear tghis is thye problem with nvidia users but I cannopt find anything related to an IZ3D driver. I tried updating my sound card my graphics card I even rolled back my graphics card NOTHING WORKS....

This is wat happened when I first got GTA IV until they came out with a patch that fixed it.,... the 1.02 patch has a bunch of fixes for ATI users maybe I will have to wait for the patch that helps people who use NVIDIA.... dammit ubi soft I LOVE your games but lately with the assassins creed 2 bullshit and now this I'm starting to get pissed.

ALSO according to ubisoft my computer meats the minimum AND recommended stats to play AC2 yet I get tremendous lag that doesnt change A BIT whethger I have all graphics on all the way high or all the way low indicating that it has to do with the way they port their games or maybe even this stupid online DRM either way I'm fuckin angry at Ubi soft.

This is the exact reason I think you have to be MENTAL t0o BUY a pc game before you pirate it to try... Shit I'm even hearing AC 2 lags for people on PS3. I think Ubisoft was dropped on it's head recently with all of their ridiculous actions and inactions... they've been coming out with new game after new game after new game but they ALL SUCK (they all suck meaning theya re buggy and or have an online fuckin DRM that didn'[t do much except ppiss BUYERS off and make the release date a month later for piraters. it's retarded)"

,wim1313,2010-05-15T08:07Z,"it is the best way to install the game thanks to Heroin

Installing & CrackingFirst you need to download and unpack and mount the game. It took me around 2 hours to download the entire game. I stood at around 1.8MB/s and the unpacking took almost 5 minutes.

1.Turn on Daemon Tools Lite.
2.Mount the file ending with .iso
3.Access the folder to where you mounted it and doubleclick the autostart file.
4.Install the game
5.Go back to the mount folder and access the ?Skidrow folder? or extract the crack from the rar file we provided.
6.Copy all of the content from that folder into the Splinter Cell game folder (something like C:Program Files..)
7.Access the Splinter Cell Folder and run the crack, gu.exe, you copied into it (.srcsystemgu.exe).
8.Play!
Known ErrorsError Code 2 ? Caused by AVG
1.Open AVG User Interface.
2.Go to Tools -> Advanced settings -> Resident Shield -> Exceptions -> Add Path
3.Find and select both the game folder and the crack folder.
4.Apply -> OK.
5.All files should now be moveable from the crack folder to the game folder and ?Error 2? should stop as well.

If you guys have any problems or don?t understand feel free to leave a comment or a question or even a thanks. Also props to Skidrow, the true champions of cracking"

Just Cause 2 from skid row inside the image in the skidrow folder JustCause executable = trojan... Skidrow Splintercell conviction the DLL Ubiorti (or something like that... the DLL that bipasses the ubisoft game launcher sign in screen 'I think is what it's purpose is) = Trojan.

Why are these crackers all of a sudden lacing their torrents with viruses!?!?!? These arent the kind of popups you get that say it could be a virus because of what it has to do behind the scene to bipass the DRM's these are Actual Trojan viruses they are putting in these cracks..... WHY??? I don't know...

I have NEVER had this problem with SkidRow until Just cause and NOW Splinter Cell

Why all of a sudden!?!?!? Are people pretending to be Skidrow???? Is reloaded putting virused shit out there as a Skid row torrent for a competetive edge.... is skidrow doing this because they are anti pirate or iust it just some asshole who thinks himself clever???

WHATEVER it is this SUCKS!!!"

He creates his own Installation Setups in some cases, which doesn't give you the option to uninstall the software later and adds it to a folder with his own name (as in The Last Remnant and Metro 2033), or puts a giant personal logo with an annoying music in the center of the screen everytime you manage to open a game (as in Bioshock 2 and GTA IV). What the hell? Do you REALLY need ALL this attention? 
RAZOR1911 RAZOR1911 RAZOR1911 RAZOR1911 RAZOR1911 popping up everywhere, in setups, folders, .txts and even before the game itself starts!

I KNOW who the hell you are, and I could've known in a better way if it was just because of your good work. I'd search for you when trying to find a crack instead of AVOIDING your name, which is what I actually do. All this crap ruins the original game experience.

(it is a brazilian site. on the first topic there is a link with an update patch and a new crack, download it)

NOTE: There is NO problem if you have already changed the exe's and stuff, you WON'T have to reinstall it in order to apply the 1.2 patch.

2. Create a folder in your desktop, and if you have AVG, add an exception to that folder (AVG User Interface > Tools > Advanced Settings > Resident Shield > Directory Excludes > Add Path)

3. Also, create an exception to your Splinter Cell instalation folder.

4. Unrar the content into your exceptioned desktop folder.

5. Patch the game. (through the patch you just unrared)

6. Apply the new crack and stuff into your installation game.

7. Rejoyce!

YES Sam Fisher IS in the game YES it is an addition to the splinter cell series, NO it is NOT splinter cell anymore!. It's a TOTALLY different game altogether. You don't get the SK rifle you DON'T get goggles until like the end of the game and tey are sonar goggle ONLY. The onl;y ""Gadgets"" youp get are hings like grenades flashbangs emp grenades and a sticky camera... the portable emp and the sticky camera are the only things that can be considered ""Gadgets"".

There really isn't any showing up and taking bad guys out without other bad guys knowing your there. It sort of remidnds me of the stealth gameplay in Bat man Arkham asylum. 

No more random interrogations anymore (which was one of my favorite things about splinter cell, however the new techniques in which you do this is awesome but there are only certain parts of the game where you can.... all interrogations are scripted)"

1. I downloaded it in about 8 hours
2. unpacked it and installed it
3. copied the conviction_game over the original
4. then i ran the autorun and it did some things and started to download the patch and installed it 
5. then it asked me to log in to the ubisoft page and i registered and logged
6.i pressed play and it said: Falied to connect to Ubisoft master servers check your internet connection.
7. so i put internet back on and pressed play and same thing again... 
Please help"

,MrAbelin,2010-05-27T02:10Z,"Don't know if anyone already posted this but...

This is for everyone with AVG who gets the ""Error code 2""

1. Open AVG
2. Go to ""tools"" and select ""advanced settings""
3. Select ""excluded files""
4. Click add and choose all files (except for the skidrow file"") from the ""skidrow""-folder.
5. Click ""apply"" and then ""OK""
Now you will be able to move these files if you weren't before.
6. Put the files were they need to be in the installed game folders.
7. Repeat first 5 steps by choosing the same files as before but select them from their new locations.
8. Done! Have fun!

Hope this helped! It worked for me.
The dll. file from the skidrow-folder needs to be coppied into the splinter cell-game-folder AND into the Ubisoft game Launcher-folder. Thus it must be selected twice in step 7 but from their different locations.

I'm using Windows 7 and the newest free version of AVG. Don't think it will make much difference from Xp or Vista but just so you know."

,comet.vermont,2010-07-25T18:06Z,"I'm a f$#^*!g ""noob"" & I can even get these games to work.  I'm REALLY sick & fucking tired of you assholes not READING THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!

All you have to do is what it says on the fucking screen right in fucking front of you.  Not to mention that it's a torrent & instructions at it's simplest fucking level!

You download an .iso disk image...SIMPLE!

You install the game...SIMPLE!

You copy the ""crack"" folder to the install directory, the one with the same name as the folder that SKIDROW named it...SIMPLE!

If you claim that you cant find the ""crack"" folder, it's usually inside the folder that is usually named after the person/persons you got the FREE FUCKING GAME FROM e.g. SKIDROW.  Or it's in a folder named ""crack"" you fucking morons.

Make a desktop icon from the cracked application you JUST copied...SIMPLE!

Play...SIMPLE!

As far as the virus (.dll) thing is conserned, I use Avira free & NOD 32 & yes they found the ""virus"".  Being a ""noob"" (I hate that fucking word BTW) as I stated earlier, I am extremely worried about obtaining torrent virus.  It happened before from a ViTALiTY file, which in turn fucked up my computer for days.  Yes, i've read many, many, many of the super-computer-hacker-genius-i'm-smarter-than-you'll-ever-be-you-stupid-nOoB-Ha-hA-HA-DArW!n!eN/H-1-9-4-2-4/L!FE! comments about False Positives & how my Anti-Virus sucks & how all noobs suck but to me, a virus is a virus.

YES, I understand that in theory all cracks are a type of virus but I've downloaded many other files with application cracks that I've checked with Avira & NOD32 & no issues arose so I don't understand the virus issue.  All cracks are different but still. YET, I digress,

I quarantined the virus, folowed the instructions as stated, copied the crack & you know what? the game works FINE!

Finally, & most importantly, STOP ASKING STUPID FUCKING QUESTIONS WITHOUT AT LEAST TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Google something for fucks sake! or Bing it, or yahoo it, for the love of God do all three & cross reference!!!!

If your screen in black, LOOK IT UP FIRST, it's prob. your video card, if the game wont install, put the error message into a search engine & look it up, it's prob. something you could download or figure out from the Microsoft website.

I don't know shit from shit about hacking, computers, torrents, anything, but I'm learning as I go & the only way to learn something is to TRY TO FIGURE IT THE FUCK OUT!  If you can't, THATS when you ask a question.

Oh, one more thing, to all you fucks bitching about ""you suck (insert name here) this torrent doesn't work"" or ""Fuck you (insert name here) it's missing a .dll file""  THESE ARE FREE FUCKING GAMES GIVIN TO YOU BY PEOPLE WHO ARE SMARTER & OBVIOUSLY MORE GENEROUS THAN YOU OR THE COMPANIES THAT MAKE THESE GAMES. APPRECIATE SOMETHING FOR FUCKS SAKE.  God damn, American's as well as most of the free world are a bunch of spoiled fucking brats.

fuck off."

First of all dude you could try to explain things to people a little bit better if your getting so fucking frustrated with people asking the same question instead of being a douche and pretty much saying that everything in your matter is fucking simple. Cause its not. Apparently your not a fucking noob if you get it and no one else does. Prick.

To everyone else who had problems copying the crack and couldn't find answers because douchebags like comet.vermont don't know how to help people, after you've installed go to the files located on the iso. The crack is located in the file labled SKIDROW. All you do is copy the file that is labled 'src' and then you go to your program files and look for Ubisoft. Once your in ubisoft click on Splinter Cell Conviction, then paste the contents. Easy, but not so easy if you don't know what the hell your doing. Hope that helped.

For those of you looking for KeyGens or having trouble with System Validation you should just read a few of the earlier comments then follow the instructions exactly as they are given.  I found it best to install the 1.02 update as well so all you have to do is:

1. Mount the ISO and install the game:
( Tom.Clancyâ€™s.Splinter.Cell.Conviction-SKIDROW.iso = http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5522885 )

2. install the update :
( Update-SKIDROW.rar\splinter_cell_conviction_1.02.exe = http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5541367/Tom_Clancys_Splinter_Cell_Conviction_v1.02_Update )

3. copy ""src"" folder from the 1.02 update torrent into the game's installed directory :
( Tom Clancys Splinter Cell Conviction v1.02 Update-SKIDROW.rar\SKIDROW\ )

Thanks again Mbb15..."

1.Download the game and the skidrow crack (Tom.Clancys.Splinter.Cell.Conviction-SKIDROW.Crack.Only)

2.Open the file with Daemon tools and install it.

3.Let it update, when its done it will ask you if u wish to run the game. Press No

4. Unrar the crackfiles youÂ´ve downloaded and copy them ( should be 4 of them that ur going to copy ).

5.Then you just paste the copies in the two folders inside the ubisoft folder. (depends where youÂ´ve installed the game).

6. launch the game and enjoy it. Worked for me, I hope it works with you. I have AVG antivirus and Windows 7 64-bit."

I added my own ini file with the extension and everything and named it exactly what it's supposed to be and put the lines in and nothing. I tried putting the lines in to fix my sensitivity in every single .ini file in the games folder. Still nothing. From my understanding the game doesn't even fucking read the .ini files in the folder because I can change all the controls in the game, then go to look in my .ini files and nothing in them has changed.
