The failure of Argentina in 2001



   Here you can see a shocking video with Greek subtitles, which describes the events that brought Argentina to a state of bankruptcy.
   What is striking is the fact that the state of Argentina is very similar to the state of Greece.
   Argentina was a long and rich resources in the country. But the evil and corrupt manipulation of governments, in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, pushed the majority of its people in misery.

To more easily understand the film, highlighted the following:

- The constitution is exactly the same as in the United States: Federal Presidential Parliamentary Democracy
- The President is elected directly by the people, forms a government, setting Ministers has executive power and no prime minister.
- The House of Representatives consists of the Congress and the Senate.
- The country is federal, comprising 23 provinces and independent region's capital Buenos Aires
- The judiciary is independent.
- The country had a long tradition in social and labor rights, much more advanced than Greece.
- In 1930 he was one of the 10 richest countries on earth.
- The country did not participate and was not influenced by the two world wars.

- Government:
1946-1955: President Juan Peron
1955-1958: Military dictatorship
1958-1962: President Arturo Frontitsi
1963-1966: President Arturo Igia
1966-1973: Military dictatorship
1973-1974: President Juan Peron.
1974-1976: President Isabel Peron.
1976-1983: Military dictatorship
1983-1989: President Raul Alfonsin
1989-1999: President Carlos Menem
1999-2001: President Fernando de la Roy
December 2001: Democratic rebellion forced President de la Rwanda, and resignation of Carlos Menem to withdraw his candidacy for reelection to the presidency.

The film lasts two hours, but really worth to see. I'll never forget.
