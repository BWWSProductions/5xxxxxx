I appreciate all of the torrents you have provided me with. My brain can't contain all of the knowledge I've gotten from you. I know some asshole will comment on this and call me a kiss ass. You know what I'll say to that, ""fucking right!"""

,huttate,2011-04-11T20:31Z,"The Workbook Manual to accompany this is available at http://www.thegeeks.bz [free sign up].

Actually the whole torrent is there.

I tried to upload the torrent for the book but could not because:

a: I am obviously not 1337 enough
b: I am too old to fight the world
c: I am on a very slow connection
d: It isn't my fault"
