Plot:

The story begins with a new English teacher 
Rahul Prakash Udyavar (Shahid Kapoor) joining 
Swaraswati Vidya Mandir school, situated in the
 Mumbai suburbs. He strikes instant rapport 
with students and teachers alike.

When Rahul Udyawar unifies the teachers 
(Ayesha Takia, Sushant Singh) against the 
atrocities of school management, the 
Principal Aditya Sahay (Nana Patekar) 
defends the management decision. This 
comes as a shocker to the teachers as Mr. Sahay 
is known for his dedication as an educator 
for the last 32 years which has built the 
school's high reputation. The situation 
becomes graver as school management becomes 
overambitious with its growth and involves 
media planners in the extracurricular 
activities. This demands the involvement 
of students in TV reality shows and many 
other media PR activities used for building 
up the school image in public which starts 
reflecting on the students' stress levels. 
The pressure on young minds increases 
incredibly, leading to unexpected and 
grim consequences.
