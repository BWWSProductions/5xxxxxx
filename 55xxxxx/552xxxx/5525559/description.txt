I figured that some of you don't know how to install wads, so I wrote this guide for you. just follow these steps:

(make sure you got the Homebrew Channel already installed! â€“ Google for more information if you donâ€™t)


Wad installation guide:

1. Download Wad Manager 1.5 â€“ Here: http://filetrip.net/f5964-WAD-Manger-1-5.html
2. Create a directory named "apps" in the root of your storage device
3. Unzip the downloaded file and copy the WAD_Manger_1.5 directory with its content into that "apps" directory
4. Create a directory named "wad" in the root of your storage device and copy any desired wads into that directory
5. Go into the Homebrew Channel and load Wad Manager 1.5

In Wad Manager:
