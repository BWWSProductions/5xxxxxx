This movie was encoded in such a way that it doesn't play in all video players.

If you can hear the music but aren't hearing any voice over or dialogue it's because this download doesn't play correctly in some players. For example, it doesn't play correctly in VLC Media Player for some reason.

Download Final Media Player (google it) for free and it will play perfectly."
