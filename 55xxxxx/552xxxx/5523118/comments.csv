[V],poppedtart,2010-05-01T19:48Z,"yea ill look around today.  problem with this movie is how often it switches from hindi and english.  Without leaving the subs on all the time I think its too hard to watch, even with forced subs.  I did encode the dvd9 though, just waiting to sub it."
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-01T20:22Z,"is this the way hindi speakers speak?  half the sentence is in english then flip to hindi, is sort of confusing."
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-01T20:39Z,whats also weird is in someplace they are speaking english and then they overlay it with hindi.

[V],poppedtart,2010-05-01T21:06Z,ill release it this evening or so.  I found the correct sub for the full dvd.  The one Team_xRG recommends had some of the video chopped or something since the subs were delayed and it was missing the full subs.
[V],Team_xRG,2010-05-02T10:26Z,"to be honest i have full dvd of this 
and did'nt needed the sub cos i know hindi 
u can check my profile my team member ripped it
and yes many people talk like that
adding english in hindi sentence lol "
