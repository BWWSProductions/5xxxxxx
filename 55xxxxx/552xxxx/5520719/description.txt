With their second album, Your Majesty, the Anniversary deliver on the left-field emo pop they crafted on Designing a Nervous Breakdown, both expanding on some of their artier tendencies and keeping the playful, hooky songwriting that made their debut so refreshing. And while Your Majesty has an aptly lush sound thanks to Rob Schapf and Doug Boehm, the groupâ€™s inherent, slightly awkward earnestness shines through at every turn. Itâ€™s an intriguing contrast, particularly on the albumâ€™s more experimental moments â€” â€œHusam, Husamâ€ sounds like a pocket-sized Pink Floyd epic, complete with a prelude, spacy keyboards, breathy backing vocals, and slightly embarrassing lyrics (â€œDrink motherâ€™s milk and be free!â€), but the band pulls it off through sheer guilelessness and talent. The similarly prog rock-influenced album closers, â€œDeath of the Kingâ€ and â€œFollow the Sun,â€ donâ€™t fare quite as well, if only because the rest of Your Majesty is so solid. The sweet harmonies and playful keyboards on â€œPeace, Pain and Regret,â€ â€œThe Siren Sings,â€ and â€œNever Dieâ€ sound like what the Rentals shouldâ€™ve gone for on their second album, while driving songs like â€œCrooked Crownâ€ and â€œTu Whit Tu Whooâ€ are two of the Anniversaryâ€™s finest rockers. Throw in the sweetly folky â€œGhost of the Riverâ€ and Your Majesty shapes up as a diverse, accomplished album that manages to be unabashedly emotional, playful, and ambitious all at the same time.
