           Jack Sullivan has been discharged from the military after      
           a lengthy court marshal for striking a superior officer.       
           Along with his 9-year-old daughter Charlie, the two move       
           back to Jack's childhood home of "Mentor Headlands", a         
           small town located in Northeastern Ohio's marshlands. As       
           familiar as the Headlands are to Jack, he is struck by         
           all the new development and the loss of woods and marsh        
           he used to play in as a child. Shortly after arriving to       
           the house he inherited after his father passed away, Jack      
           is reunited with his old friend Bob Perkins, who is now        
           the Sheriff. Bob is in the midst of trying to figure out       
           what has been killing and mutilating the local animal          
           population. Several deer over the last week have turned        
           up ripped to shreds and with the help of Park Ranger           
           Sandy Parker; the two have concluded that a bear must          
           have wandered into the area. This theory makes sense to        
           Jack until he sees something standing in the fog - a           
           Bigfoot. Naturally, everyone thinks Jack is out of his         
           mind. But, when some of the local residents meet the same      
           fate as the deer, suspicions start to arise. This is not       
           a story about the cuddly, misunderstood giant living in        
           the Pacific Northwest. It's the story of a clever,             
           murderous monster living in the marshes and woods of           
           Northeastern Ohio. This Bigfoot is a victim of                 
           deforestation and urban sprawl and he is fighting back.
