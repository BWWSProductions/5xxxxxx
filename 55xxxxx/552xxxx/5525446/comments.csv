[V],twentyforty,2010-05-02T06:38Z,"@htctouch & ALL: Whoever doesn't have my e-mail could follow the instructions on latest Gossip Girl torrent and send me even one-line message containing TPB nick-name in Subject. I have few encodings from latest black-outs (two Craigs, htctouch) and I wont put them up as torrents but are available on different way.
So guys, find and contact me (what is good idea if these black-outs start to happen frequently).
Thanks."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-02T08:24Z,"PLEASE - DO NOT HIT AND RUN!!!

Seed - just for a while, as much as you can.

But - NOT like that: I have 13 with 100% and twenty minutes later - TWO!!!

I am nice but not stupid. No matter praises - I have and I would DELETE any torrent treated like that. Who can download (for free) can upload (give back, share) too!!! There is no excuses for blatant Hit&Run!!!"

,Asher_jk,2012-04-28T10:37Z,+1.. Thanks for this mate.. but I think you shouldn't go below 480p.. It degrades the picture that ways and doesn't look good on the big screen tv otherwise. Even on a normal comp screen it degraded the quality when I maximized the vlc player. My two cents there :) and thanks for the upload.
