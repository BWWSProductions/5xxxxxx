,n4sc3nt,2010-05-18T12:58Z,@moldybudz i prefer to play everything on divx... gave vlc a try... video stops every now and again... when i play it on divx or mpc the sound skips...   i really prefer .avi over .mkv and these other stupid file types... i wont be downloading any more of these mkv from holyarrows
