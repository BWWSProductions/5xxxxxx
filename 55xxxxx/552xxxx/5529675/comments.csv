,dallanlee,2010-12-07T22:42Z,"This is not a ""complaint"". I am always a grateful pirate. This is to inform. I'm fine with big files ... But I expect better quality for larger size, obviously. Personally, I give this file 6/10 V. The picture is pretty bad, as if ripped from a VHS! This movie is from 2003, why can't I find a good copy of it. If anyone knows of a good copy, please post a link. Thanks raymondhome, regardless. I just don't think the compression on this was optimal. 720x400 but looks like 360x200."
