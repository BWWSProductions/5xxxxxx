,AlJeron521,2010-07-21T07:27Z,"Full name of torrent - Microsoft.SQL.Server.2008.R2.DataCenter.Edition.x86.and.x64-ZWTiSO. So, it has ??? team keygen or not?"
,khurambz,2010-09-02T20:37Z,"well am sure its fake... guess why... 

SQL 2008 R2 was never build or released for x86(32bit) .... why its says in name?????"
,osanda009,2010-10-26T16:44Z,stun whats this person[khurambz] is telling is that truth??????????????
,MonkeyManCoco,2010-10-30T22:53Z,"Just ignore khurambz, he doesn't know what he's talking about. I've used this exact release. It is the data center edition and it includes both x86 and x64 software on the disc. It installs fine and even includes what appears to be a working license code."

,munishk,2010-11-23T12:28Z,"After downloading I got number of zip files named ZMSSR2DC.RAR. After extracting, an ISO file is obtained. Please suggest where is setup.exe or how to install. I'm new to sql server R2  "
,munishk,2010-11-23T12:32Z,How to install it 
,munishk,2010-11-23T12:33Z,I got ISO files after extracting all zipped rar files. Where is setup.exe or Tell me how to install it
,osaka35,2010-12-06T03:57Z,"munishk: an ISO is a disc image. You can burn it using a good burning program (I use cdburnerxp. it's free =] ). You can also use a program such as Winrar and...unzip the ISO, for lack of a better word.

You can also use  MagicISO (MagicDisc) to mount the ISO as a virtual disc. If that makes no sense to you, I'd suggest just using CDburnerXP and burning the ISO. =]"

Thank You Uploader!"
,einarz,2011-01-04T16:25Z,"I'm installing and everything looks good.

Thanks!"
,brianxxx,2011-05-14T17:19Z,"Thanks STUN!
Nobody seems to like to upload SQL SERVER releases. So hard to find a simple 2008 Enterprise version!"
,cameltoe69,2011-07-10T12:42Z,"If you already have another SQL Server 2008 R2 download e.g. Standard - you can re-run that setup, go into the maintenance option and choose edition upgrade - Use the serial below and voila! 100% Data centre :-)

,xd1,2011-11-29T12:13Z,"I've it installed just fine (default instance) on a 64 bit Win 7 laptop. The only problem I'm encountering is logging into the database engine. I previously installed a version of SQL EXPRESS and thought I had completely uninstalled it, but that was the first option to log in when I went to the SSMS.  It had ZEUS/SQLEXPRESS as the default login.  I changed it to the default instance ZEUS/MSSSQLSERVER, but still no luck.  Also, I was unsure how to configure all the service accts when I installed it so I set them all to something/NTWRK.  Perhaps this is the problem? Can someone be so kind as to help me out on this? TIA!"
,KoryLifyddhb,2011-12-06T10:56Z,"It doesn't work, guys.
I installed it on Windows 7 Ultimate x64, Management Studio can not run (writes ""Management Studio package can not be loaded""), and any attempts to connect to it with connection string from other software doesn't work."
,Afrok,2011-12-15T15:26Z,WORKS PERFECTLY
,delecaty90,2012-01-09T14:12Z,how do i install it? ._.
,xd1,2012-03-16T12:39Z,"I'm now trying to install it on my desktop (Windows 7 64 bit), but I can't find an iso file.  Can someone please explain how I find/get to the iso file?  "
,xd1,2012-03-16T12:47Z,"munishk, if you're able to obtain an iso file then all you need to do is mount it on VirtualCloneDrive and the setup.exe should just pop up. Hit the internets for the free program."
