,Bird-Man09,2010-05-03T11:17Z,"Dude the problem is you are using an OLD version of bitTorrent that does not do a hash check. The RIAA or the record companies DL's new torrents, then they screw them up. But if you do a hash check then it will REJECT the RIAA's screwed up seeds. I downloaded 7 torrents to be sure and all were fine. No disrespect to you but they were all good. No blanks or any of that nonsense. Go to the PB forums if you need help. "
,NBr00klyn,2010-05-04T01:41Z,Oh shit your so right! I feel like such a douche! I reinstalled uTorrent and check off hash check. Now I'm downloading those torrents and there all good. I will read up on the forums when i get the time. Thanks birdman!
