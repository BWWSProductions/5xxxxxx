,davthepunk,2010-05-02T12:23Z,The video is a little 'soft' - but it's watchable. Sound seems fine too.
,Raene,2010-05-02T13:26Z,going off the screen it does look real...however i would love if anyone could confirm this...spent way too much time downloading fakes the past few days...i dont need to add another to the list>
,davthepunk,2010-05-02T13:48Z,It's real. I'm watching it now.
,garb77,2010-05-02T18:30Z,"I want divX

,junkman,2010-05-02T19:54Z,"It's genuine. Same torrent I downloaded from Demonoid yesterday. DVD-R format. 

And it's SICK SICK SICK SICK SHIT. Be warned.

,chikasu,2010-05-02T20:04Z,"I probably sound like a noob here, but how do you make these files into one movie? Ive never dealt with a .bup, .dat. or .ifo before."
,junkman,2010-05-02T21:50Z,"This film is the most badly acted, badly directed, most utterly incompetent peice of trash outside of Ed Wood's z-grade output. Total amateurish inept garbage.

However it is pretty disturbing, only because of the vomit inducing concept of the ""Human centipede"". The concept is so gross that the movie could be regarded as being sicker even than much of the ""torture porn"" of recent years, such as the Saw series and Hostel etc. Even though it is not very gory at all. It's probably not as gross as ""Cannibal Ferox"" or the equaly vile Chinese film ""The Men Behind the Sun"" detailing Japanese atrocities during WWII. (worth a look if extreme nastyness is your bag.)

Worth watching once just because of the gross-out concept, but you'll never want to see it again as it is so third rate and badly made."
,junkman,2010-05-02T21:52Z,"@chikasu

It's a DVD-R, just burn the file onto a blank DVD and it plays the same. If you put a bought DVD in the DVD drive of your computer the files on it are all .vobs, .dats and .ifos."
,snakeFisher,2010-05-02T22:23Z,"The quality isn't the greatest (in terms of video and audio), but it's not a horrendous rip. It's good enough if you want to see the film, but if you want a better one, you should wait out a bit."
,thefunnyman78,2010-10-12T21:54Z,A little soft?????...quality isnt great???....quality sucks!!...not to mention the sound....definitely NOT worth watching at ALL...specially when you've seen the trailer...in HD ..Atari had better quality...
,STEPHEN97,2011-03-07T22:23Z,"hey guys if you want to burn any piratebay film to disc, download convert x to dvd 3 or 4, with a keygen or serial code. and this program will convert and burn almost any format and then burn to dvd and the dvd will then play in all dvd players"
