This is a compilation of different sources of stuff for MSX-1 and MSX-2 home computers.

MSX were 8-bit home computers developed by ASCII and Microsoft in Japan. MSX begun producing in 1983 year, MSX-2 in 1985 year. Many big companies (http://www.passionmsx.org/msxgamesbox/museum/index.php) produced their models of this computer: Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, Philips, etc. These computers were popular in Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Netherlands, Spain, France, USSR, but almost not known in USA. More than 1500 games were made for it, but many of them have no English language versions. From 1988 year 8-bit computers and MSX specifically loose interest to them, being exceled by 16-bit computer systems becoming cheaper. There were sold about 5 million MSX in the world, quantity comparable to Apple II and Atari ST, and more then Amstrad CPC.

=Technical specifications=

MSX-1 (1983 Ð³.): CPU Zilog Z80A 3.58 MHz; RAM to 64 KB; videochip TI TMS9918, 16 KB, 256x192x16 colors (palette 16 colors), hardware 1-color sprites; 40x24 text; soundchip AY-3-8910, 3 channels + noise; ROM with BASIC; cartridge slot for programs and expansions.

As an addition many users installed MSX-MUSIC cartridge expansion. MSX-2 have the best graphics capabilities among 8-bit home computers (among 8-bit platforms Sega Master System is close).

Some games were ported from ZX Spectrum to MSX-1 and look the same ugly as at Spectrum. Games that were specially developed for MSX-1 and especially MSX-2 look with a noticable difference.
