,vivaldi0,2010-05-02T19:33Z,"actually...why doesn't the EU focus their efforts on stopping pirated material to spain instead of England or Sweden?..seems spanish people, whether it's spain, south america or mexico seem to have a dominance in the pirated movie area.  Or just give them a section for spanish torrents, so i don't have to go through the bull sh** of weeding out junk?"
