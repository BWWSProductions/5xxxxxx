PLEASE SEE Torrent files for TRACK LISTING

Took me a farcical 28 days to download this one from a single seed who was off line more than on.   Oh Well thanks anyway for the ISO disc image which without altering the quality in any way is now here in useful track format for busy Video Jocks or VJ's.  NO AVI XVID OR MP4 on this download.   I don't mind people who think they are doing the world a favour by shrinking the file size.   They want to upload RUBBISH that is there lookout, but when some of them do this WITH MY ORIGINAL SEEDS..I do get annoyed.  What is worse they get a bigger swarm downloading the now poor quality sound and video, than my original HQ seed did and the downloader's also it would seemthink this is cool!  HELLO Nothing for nothing in this World.

COME ON GUYS WISE UP!

It is 2010.  If you don't have the hard drive space or bandwidth to do this then get the heck off the POT and go back to the land of Audio Only and dial up speeds where you belong.

ONCE AGAIN 'Sigh'.   If A MUSIC VIDEO FILE IS LESS THAT 50 mega byte in size FORGET IT.

Don't go there and maybe... just maybe this rubbish will stop wasting our bandwidth.
