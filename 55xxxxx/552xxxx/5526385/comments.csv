Must say, your encoding to filesizes is excellent.

Encoders who provide larger filesizes at similar quality have a lot to learn.

You should get some sort of award matey.

Maybe the guys at TorrentFreak could arrange Torrent awards covering sevral catagories or something, will suggest it sometime.

Peace. : )"
