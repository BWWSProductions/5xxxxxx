Thanks for your recent uploads, it's very much appreciated. This album is exactly the same as Ten Years After - Premium Gold Collection, except the tracks are in a different order.
I've just started uploading again, as my up speed has gone from 25kB/s to about 65kB/s. Check out my Buddy Whittington upload, with more to follow."
