Alice in Ultraland is an 2005 album by experimental electronica group Amorphous Androgynous, which is a side project of The Future Sound of London.

It is in the same vein as the previous record (â€œThe Isnessâ€) with a psychedelica feel but has more electronica tracks than the last one, as much as the last album had in progressive rock. Particularly in an extended version of discarded Isness track â€œYes My Brotherâ€ (confusingly titled â€œThe Prophetâ€ here, with another track called â€œYes My Brotherâ€), it features more of a funk and blues influence than The Isness, alongside the aforementioned electronic sections.
