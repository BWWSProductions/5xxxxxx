When I used this crack and I tried to wiev uplay or friends it would tell me that ubisoft servers weer down. It also searched forever for games.

And I found the solution. Look into your hosts file, and DELETE all lines which contain the urls to ubisoft servers. You might have them here becuse you used AC2 crack. If you keep the lines, it will prevent your computer from connecting to the ubi servers, thats why it doesn't work! So just delete them and it should work :)"

,sus2912,2010-05-05T08:16Z,"ok guys everthing is working perfectly so stop crying
all u need is to download the game iso and install with net connection off and then copy the contents of the multi crack provided my skidrow and copy all the 5 files in the system>src folder and dont copy the r2 file in the c drive ubisoft game launcher just copy that file also in the src folder of splinter cell....
now click on the exe file of splinter cell and play the fucking game....if u need and want to play co-op or multi then u need to have a real account in ubisoft if u have one then open ini file of skidrow and change the name and password there with ur account details after that u can play multi also but remember lan will not work so go to join match and then host a private match in that invite friends to play with u
to add friends in the menu click add friends thats it
if u are gettin the server error that means u havent copied the crack correctly and if u r gettin the error 2 code problem that means ur antivirus is stoping the r2 file from running add it to the list of allowed program and it should work
u can even unlock and buy upgrades with the point u earn with a real account"

,r2007uk,2010-05-09T11:36Z,"@ people with start up erros-

check/update: sound, graphics, directx drivers etc.

ofc make sure your pc spec  is up to par (for me when i initially loaded the game I had black screen, however it became visible when it got to the 'push any key to start' bit... once I changed resolution and gfx settings in game this problem resolved.

another thing people when you invite somebody sometimes when they click accept they will get an error such as server down or unable to connect.. this happened to me a few times now so if people dont join dont assume they are ignoring you just send a another invite a few more times..

when that happens to me i usually quickly host a game myself and invite that person who just tried to invite me instead which more often or not seems to work

,Cadaurny,2010-05-24T08:56Z,"For some reason no matter what I do every time I try multiplayer it gives me the Splinter Cell servers are down error, but I have a real account I copied the ini file along with the r2 file just not the exe since I'm using 1.02 but it still gives me that error and I've tried with 3 accounts and it still gives me it. Can anyone help me because I really wanted to play multiplayer so if anyone can help I'd be very thankful otherwise I guess I'll try hamachi."

After changing ur account in the ini file your previous saves will not be available, this is how game works and has nothing to do with our crack, different saves for different profiles, if you restore account name to Skidrow your old saves will be there again."
,scamInc,2011-01-19T23:30Z,"@Jimzq
that is because, in general, this dll file is a virus, but it's a harmless one. the dll file is doing what viruses normally do... but this one is harmless because skidrow made it, and it affect only the game launcher, nothing more. i trust skidrow cracks, but i don't trust the uploaders, so i always look for the scull icon next to the uploader name. this means that the uploader is trusted, and i always read the comments.

,LazyAmerican,2011-02-12T07:37Z,It really is sad when you guys more then likely have a more stable game then the paying customer does....fucking ridiculous that Ubisoft basically is telling me to redownload their game cause their own shit doesn't work online.

Instead of askign a dumb question like what hamachi is, google it, google has answear to just about anything.

this is a multiplayer crack if u want to preserve ur single player move or copy ur current install and use a fresh install of the game for your multiplayer, it's not that fuckign stupid and the isntructions are there."
