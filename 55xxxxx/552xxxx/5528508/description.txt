"Brotherly Love"

Acting as his brother's wingman, Rallo gives Cleveland 
Jr. a few pointers on how to win over the girl of his 
dreams Chanel (guest voice Taraji P. Henson). Although 
when Cleveland Jr. finds out her boyfriend is local 
rap star Kenny West (guest voice Kanye West), he 
challenges Kenny to an epic Stoolbend rap battle to 
compete for Chanel's heart.

Enjoy :)
