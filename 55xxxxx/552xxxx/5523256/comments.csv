Just wondering , if we have a request to make, do we just put it on ur latest upload now, or what do we do because it seems that the torrentbucket.com doesn't work. I doubt it's just me because ive tried it on multiple computers so if you could just give me a bit of insight on things, that would be great man , again, thanks for all the uploads. :)"
