,icantfindafuckingusername,2012-06-29T11:58Z,"I was so excited when I found this torrent, 320kbps! But... idk, when I listen to SSTB I can tell the quality is better (I'm comparing it to the slightly lower quality version I have) yet there is this annoying cackle I can make out... it's very sad, because if it weren't for that the quality is definitely much better.  I haven't noticed this on any other albums yet, hopefully I won't.  

Anyway, the torrent is still awesome, I'll seed forever!"
