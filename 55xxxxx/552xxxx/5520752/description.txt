British rock act Keane is set to return this spring with its fourth album, "Night Train." Due May 11 via Cherrytree/Interscope, the set contains only 8 songs, but features collaborations with rapper K'Naan, Japanese MC Tigarah and a rare lead vocal performance from Keane keyboard player Tim Rice-Oxley.
"Night Train's" title and material was born out of Keane's world tour for 2008's "Perfect Symmetry," of which the band'sfavorite method of travel became taking trains between gigs. "The idea was to chuck out a single, or at most an EP in October," Keane vocalist Tom Chaplin tells Billboard.com. "But it turned into something more. I think we see it as a body of work that we made during touring. Just a document of different places and moods.
