[T],FatFreddy69,2011-01-06T18:02Z,"Who enjoys this horrid sick non-sense must go to a doctor.

  Average/healthy people can't watch it to the half. 

If you want to lose your girl-friend I recommend you to watch it together to the end, lol."
,vanga123456,2011-01-10T21:37Z,"relax dude it's just a movie and go to a doctor and say what? hi doc I'm a psycho-maniac,care to help me?! ''average/healthy'' LOL yeah only people with cancer can watch this! its a movie pull your puss* as* self together and stop writing sh*t that make no-sense we ain't care! geezus"
,Seddah,2011-02-06T15:09Z,"I'm actually specifically downloading this to watch with my boyfriend.  It was my idea.  I think you're the crazy one if you really think every single girl would leave her boyfriend over a movie, even if it is ""horrid non-sense"".

Also, just asking, is English your second language, or are you just really bad at it?"
,justregged,2011-02-12T15:32Z,I hope you had a good comedy lined up to watch afterwards lol
,nofences7,2011-03-29T03:15Z,This movie is amazing. If you can't see past the necessary violence to see the genius of this movie's story then stick to mainstream movies that lay everything out for the average dumb*ss and you shouldn't have to worry about peeing your pants while watching a movie with your gf. P*ssy :P
,Snowing23,2011-04-25T06:06Z,"Thanks so much for including the original french audio. You sir are a gentleman.

Haven't downloaded yet to comment on quality. Will do so when I have."

A new study by the American Red Cross obtained exclusively by The Daily Beast found that a surprising majorityâ€”almost 60 percentâ€”of American teenagers thought things like water-boarding or sleep deprivation are sometimes acceptable. More than half also approved of killing...

I'm not surprised any more...and it's because more and more people and more and more younger kids watch horror movies. Not to mention the bloody games some of you play. More blood the better, later you find the games boring then rather go to school and shoot in real life. Causing pain someone with no reason is sick period."

,Dave70x,2011-07-05T00:59Z,"Jesus Christ mkvonly, it's a movie and I'm bored of comments like the one's you posted, so I'm off to blow up a hospital or something now."
,BunBun4life,2011-09-07T15:55Z,"McVonly, screw you faggot.  I'm 47 years old and i think waterboarding and sleep deprivation is for pussies.  They should be slicing some skin and jamming some salted pig meat into the open wounds of those islamic pissbags.  

It has nothing to do with video games and movies.  OH AND ALSo at your FIRST comment months ago about how you gotta be sick and lose your girlfriend BLAH BLAH weep (pussy)   I am a girl.  If I dated a guy who couldn't handle this movie, he would be gone instantly.  I don't like weak french faggot pussies."
,mokakeyk,2011-10-22T17:54Z,"i didn't like the fact that ""anne"" couldn't have her beautiful self again in the end of the movie and i really thought that it'll be a happy ending with the protagonist being free, but i was wrong, it was fucking disappointing, lucie and anne shouldn't die, they should break free and hack those sick fucks who tortures innocent young women by locking them in basements, feeding them rotten porridge and sending a bald faggot who beats little girls for a living.

my favorite part was when lucie barges in and killed the family at their breakfast with a double barrel shotgun."
,mokakeyk,2011-10-22T17:58Z,"and oh i almost forgot the quality rating
A=10
V=10
M=7
-3 on movie because of the stupid disappointing ending"

A=10
V=10

My only issue is that the subtitles are hardcoded.  Normally I wouldn't care too much, but there are literally dozens of spelling errors.  If this were an .srt file, one could go in and fix these errors.  Alas, they shall remain.

However, the most egregious sin of these subtitles is the failure to provide the translation of the coda to the film.  The definition of ""martyr"" which comes up on the screen before the credits roll.

martyr: nom, adjectif
du grec ""marturos"":
tÃ©moin

martyr: noun, adjective
from the Greek ""marturos"":
witness"
