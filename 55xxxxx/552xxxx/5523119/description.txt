├óΓé¼┼ôHotel Originaldo: Dream daVinci├óΓé¼┬¥  
	It├óΓé¼Γäós the 21st Century, right here on Earth....so what├óΓé¼Γäós new?  High atop Mount Sinai-Saint Louis, beside the Hotel Originaldo, you├óΓé¼Γäóll visit the ICBM Cinema...and that├óΓé¼Γäós how, for better or worse, you├óΓé¼Γäóll find out whats new..and not so new.  Singlehandedly, except for a little help from his screwball Kansan cousin and two palavering Dachshunds, your humble host will introduce you to the age of Greed...and of Genuis, where any soul desperate enough can still make a difference...or at least try to.
	  Re-opening after a twenty-year medicated stupor, the ICBM Drive-In retains all it├óΓé¼Γäós ☻artsy-fartsy splendor.   But what still appears to be the Hotel Originaldo remains a cramped apartment studio cluttered with optical masterpieces and uncensored remarks on the sense, and nonsense, of so-called modern civilization.  Our peg-legged artist├óΓé¼Γäós gold-crowned cousin and palavering Dachshunds add lively fun to this otherwise deadly serious allegory of the real Hotel originaldo...Mother Earth.  
	And how can Earth Angel help us save Mother Earth?  It├óΓé¼Γäós simple.  Join in the ambillectual adventures of Richard, Sparky, and Pip Krause, a one-man, two dog project.  The first feature film ever to receive the prestiguous 21st Century Richard S. Krause Award of Ambillectual Excellence.  DVD Covers are posted at www.originaldo.com/hotel_orig_covers2010.jpg
