,scottsasse,2011-08-09T01:44Z,"@ raymondhome, I can not THANK YOU enough for this!! This is my all time favorite movie. The world is a a sadder place without John Candy and John Hughes and none have been able to replace them. I'm not one to get teary eyed watching movies but this one almost always gets me at the end. Also many THANKS to those who seeded this torrent, without you there would be no torrents!! Peace And Love, DrScott "
