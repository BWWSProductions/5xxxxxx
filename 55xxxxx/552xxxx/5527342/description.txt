Robots (2005) Movie

Robots is a 2005 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Blue Sky Studios for 20th Century Fox (the same companies behind the film Ice Age), and was released theatrically (both in normal theaters and in IMAX theaters) on March 11, 2005 (along with a teaser trailer for Ice Age: The Meltdown). The story was created by Chris Wedge and Bill Joyce, a well-known children's book author/illustrator. The two were trying to create a film version of Joyce's book Santa Calls but instead they came up with a movie about robots. Joyce served as producer and production designer for the film. The DVD and VHS of Robots were released on September 27, 2005. Robots is also the last 20th Century Fox animated film to receive a VHS release. The MPAA rated the film PG; in most countries, it is suitable for all ages.
