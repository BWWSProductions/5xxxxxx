,hatebreeder80,2010-06-01T10:25Z,"hey thanks for the up RiddlerA

i dont think i downloaded one of your torrents till i got the first 2 seasons of 24. i was a bit worried about the quality, especially watching it on a 26"" hd monitor because of the file size, but for less than 120mb each file the quality is 10 times bette than i expected.
honestly i have like 25 5 minute music videos that are bigger than these files and these are all over 40 minutes.
if you have the other 7 seasons on tpb im gonna dl and seed them for a while.
and if you dont have them is it possible to upload them in mkv format? my 500 gig harddrive is quickly running out of room, and less than 3 gigs for 24 eps of 24 is fucking awsome.
thanks again dude"
,appeltje456,2010-09-26T11:31Z,"good, I download with 500 kb/s"

,Fan1,2011-05-16T11:55Z,Can u imagine what this guy can do in a year?
,enectrixx,2011-07-05T00:08Z,"as always, you get what you download. extremely bad quality (you can see how blurry it is even when sitting a 3-4 meters from a 21"" monitor) and bad sound."
,Topazskillmauler,2011-07-23T23:11Z,The video quality isn't very good.
,abhijeetsingh07,2011-08-10T20:24Z,"RiddlerA:  Hey Ankit, I'm surprised to see such good speed of such old Torrent. Will definitely upload till 1:1 

I have noticed that your 1 Episode is 2 minutes shorted than the previous torrent I had.  But I was getting proper download speed in that so searched and found your torrent.

Hope you have not cut important parts?

Keep Seeding, Cheers!!"
,abhijeetsingh07,2011-08-10T20:25Z,Edit of Previous comment: I wasnt getting proper speed in my previous Torrent so downloaded this. *
