,yodafox1,2010-05-02T21:49Z,"Regardless, Thanks so much, andremo for putting these up, as you are one of the few that upload these in a format other than .mkv.

Thanks again!"

I'd like to know what DVD software is appropriate for creating a DVD without re-encoding the files though? I have Nero 8, but it seems to want to re-encode the files."
