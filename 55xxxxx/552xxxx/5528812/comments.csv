,john5246,2010-05-03T12:50Z,"How are the graphics compared to Halo 3, I saw the beta being played on IGN but I don't see amazing graphical improvements, looks like the same ""last-gen"" halo graphics. I understand it's the beta but still....

apparently they were raving about how they have more pixels to work with and rebuilt a lot of the engine....

we'll see about that I guess..."

XBOX 360 is on the market for 5 years now and there is not much more that can be done to improve graphics."
,casron,2010-08-15T20:06Z,if my xbox is flashed would this work too or does it have to be jtagd?
,neblin7,2010-09-03T04:18Z,"Not true about graphical capabilities.  This game was made around the new revamped and much stronger 360.  Sorry all you 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gen purchasers."
,beastlypanda,2011-01-23T22:20Z,I'm just curious as to how nobody has told @neblin7 that he's a moron yet. SAME GPU AS DAY ONE.
