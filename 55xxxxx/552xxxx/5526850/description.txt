This happening right here is a resulting product of two people who think, generally speaking, that yet there is more to experience than to be absorbed all over again by this evidently obtrusive acts of today's music mainstream scene. 

The focus here is more directed on artists that are mostly rather unknown or deserve more attention, deserve to be heard, to be observed by you and we want, through this medium,  provide you that possibility. This not an actual playlist which you may be used to.

Multiple genres are featured, some older unknown tracks, something newer and great local bands from both of us have been included.

This is a compilation which is made by analizing the single tracks and putting them in a specific order how we think it would fit together.

One more thing to say, support the artists themselves, not us. The playlist makers are not supposed to be sponsored in any kind for what they are doing.
