,rrmerlin51D,2010-05-01T18:04Z,Thank you 20-40.  You provide a great service with great clean downloads.  Read your statement about providing the shorter versions (which still play great on must players) for those on dialup and/or using older equipment.  Brings back horrible memories.  You're the best.  Thanks.

@believenu: Castle was on the break last week. Fortunately. Find me as ""prescribed"" on latest Gossip Girl torrent, if black-outs came our way.
