[T],Magash,2010-05-03T09:15Z,Put it up then don't seed it. I'm guessing TvTeam must mean dumb-fuck in some other language.
[V],cenkota,2010-05-03T10:32Z,harsh
[T],Magash,2010-05-03T10:58Z,Your right that was to harsh. You shouldn't put up a torrent if you don't have plans to seed it is what I'm trying to say.
,BoonesFerry,2010-05-03T13:39Z,"TvTeam is a VIP member and has provided thousands of perfect torrents.

In this case the dumb fuck is Magash"
,Dr_Science,2010-05-03T14:32Z,"I sort of agree with Magash.... TvTeam does not seed thier uploads for long, but if you notice this team puts up dozens of stuff a day.  It's hard to seed stuff when that much upload traffic is going on.

TvTeam depends on other people to seed their stuff.  I know that I have had a hell of a time getting old episodes of cops but that's ok.

god bless tvteam. oh and f%$k cable tv."
[V],TvTeam,2010-05-03T16:57Z,"Magash, you should be more polite next time.
It takes time to start seeding."
,TechnoMax,2010-05-04T09:15Z,thanks a lot for this TVTeam :)
,Temptation,2010-06-26T20:08Z,"thanks for this and all your other numerous torrents, TvTeam.

Ignore rude, dumb-fucks and ingrates like Magash above.  People these days take everything for granted and show no appreciation for uploaders."
