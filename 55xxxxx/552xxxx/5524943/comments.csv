,xpgrl_uk,2010-05-02T08:57Z,"@righthand666: Thank you, I was thinking the exact same thing. After all it's not like 14 year old angsty female teens read comic books. Who makes this stuff?"

I don't know why people would make comments on things they don't like or why they were here in the first place but I for one appreciate what you've done."

And for those of you that left bad comments why even bother to look for the item if you hate Twilight SOOO much. Oh i know, because you looked for the comment because you are a secret fan girl/boy and just wanted to seem tough so you deny shit. GROW UP PEOPLE!"
