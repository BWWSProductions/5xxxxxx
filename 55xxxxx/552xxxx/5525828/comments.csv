,skinnypimp419,2010-05-08T06:49Z,fxwg: i would but someone told me that TPB only allows 1000 files inside a torrent file.. i tried for a week to upload the torrent without raring it and it would always goto a blank white page then i rar'ed them and it worked just fine.. sorry i dont like rars myself.. 
,skinnypimp419,2010-05-08T06:51Z,HELP.  i want to move the file that im sharing to another harddrive so how do i update the torrent so that it doesnt screw anyone up?
,john2009,2010-05-10T16:53Z,"skinnypimp419 I will tell you how to move the files using utorrent
just copy the files to the new hard drive (new location) and add x before the name {e.g. XWorld Trade Center Photo's [High Quality].rar}. in utorrent rightclick on the torrent name and choose delete. Do as if you were going to download the torrent again but uncheck start download and don't forget to choose to save it in the new location ( or new HDD). close utorrent and remove the X from {xWorld Trade Center Photo's [High Quality].rar} then start utorrent again and right click on the torrent and choose Force re-check. after finishing checking start the torrent to begin seeding or downloading if it wasn't complete."
