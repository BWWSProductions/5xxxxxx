,Shotmaker9,2010-05-23T11:52Z,"For some reason, I'll get sound the first time I try to use a patch with audio, but after that no more audio will work unless I restart my computer. Other times, the audio just doesn't work, period. The DSP Status window will say audio is on, but I can't hear anything when I know I should. Did I do something wrong? Is anyone else having this problem?

@defkif The torrent info doesn't say anything about Jitter...."
,i_kill_bombs,2010-06-01T23:13Z,"use this one then. It's a common problem. This one works in Snow Leopard too. If it doesn't work, you followed the instructions wrong. So read the fucking instructions.

,namnac,2010-07-05T09:51Z,"@i_kill_bombs

this version of max/msp will not let me use audio after the first time unless I re-install it. The other version you have posted I cannot get working as I have previously run through my trial period. 

Im running leopard btw.

Is there anyway you know of to get around this? 

not to keen to reinstall osx lol

thanks very much for your help and torrents

cheers"
,pinklemon,2010-09-10T02:59Z,"I'm having the same problem as Shotmaker9 and namnac. Audio just shuts off once I start making a patch, and won't come back on unless I restart the program, only for it to happen again.

This is a shame."

SAME SHIT!"
,Sojio,2011-04-05T19:17Z,"So it seems the problem most people are having is that they're trials have expired.

Not the v5 trial however. The problem people are getting with the audio only working once is a bug apparently written into the software encryption, of an earlier version, to limit usability once the trial has expired. 

I heard that apparently this crack only removes the first layer of encryption (or some such thing) and returning the software back to an older trial expiry system. 

Audio will only work once. Once it is adjusted in any way i.e changing it's connections or turning it off. It will remain off until the patch is restarted.

I read this on the comments of a different website hosting the same torrent. I am paraphrasing so please don't quote me on this."
,haohmaru12,2012-01-22T19:38Z,"alright here is how i did :
1.i've installed trial version Max5_48561.dmg
2.replace launcher MaxMSP with this one 
3.everything works "
,syoukhan,2012-03-21T01:19Z,"When i load ppoll patch in max it crashes... i followed the instructions for the 5.06 (and the fuckin' crack doesn't works!) and this. No one works. I think is due to updates...or to your mistake

i'm very sad...i'm fuckin' poor and i need max for my studies i really want to buy it but now i can't afford... help us!"
,damnrichppl,2012-04-21T17:43Z,"Thank you, i_kill_bombs. Worked just as promised. I chose this one over your newer version simply for ""NO TIMERS!""
If everyone would please follow the goddamned instructions provided then I'm sure you may each grow to be less of a dumbass than you already are: ""MANUAL: Simple overwrite the MAX MSP app with the one in the DMG.""
or that of Haohmaru12 in the comments ""alright here is how i did :
1.i've installed trial version Max5_48561.dmg
2.replace launcher MaxMSP with this one 
3.everything works""
If you really do NEED it, buy the license. I promise you will find a way to pay if you really do care that much."
,syoukhan,2012-05-10T11:56Z,"It doesn't work on 10.6.0, 10.6.9 and also 10.7.4.

Please update! i really need max but i'm a poor student, i swear i buy it but now i don't have the money"
