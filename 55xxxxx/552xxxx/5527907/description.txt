Roman Britain Radio: It's 55AD and Iceni Gold is playing the hits for the Ancient Brits. But the Romans are coming.

Dark Age FM: It is 500AD, history's most miserable period. Britain is being invaded twice a week and a bloke called Arthur is running the country, but at least there's always Steve in the Afternoon to count the Britons down to the end of the world.

Christian Crusade Roadshow: Join DJ Steve in the Afternoon on his AD1200 Christian Crusade Roadshow, as he gathers up an army of children and the plague-ridden to find salvation and a sun tan in the Holy Land.

Headless - Civil War Radio: Tune in to Britain's darkest hour: the English Civil War, AD 1645, revealed as a silly mix-up with DJ Steve-in-the-Afternoon and King Charles I.

Mad - Georgian Radio: It's the Age of Enlightenment and Britain is going Enlightenment crazy.
Tune in to Regency FM with Steve in the afternoon. With Enlightenment update and Thomas De Quincey cooking with opium.

Steaming - Radio Victoriana: Meet other dandies on the Dandy-Line, early Victorian ankle-pornography is exposed, and science is praised for inventing a gun that only works on non-Englishmen.

A number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.
I have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice
I was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.

There is little point in downloading a "Torrent" and then recreating a "Torrent" using the same files.

The fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,

All you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the "same" files and make both have less seeders.
