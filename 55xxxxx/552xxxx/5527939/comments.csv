One remark - just to be sure - before you try to burn the VIDEO_TS folder: delete the reach for a peach.md5 file in it, becourse some burning programs cannot handle that... the first time i tried to burn - with Nero, it crashed at 99%... several hours & 3 programs later i found the .md5 (checksum) file, removed it and finally could burn and watch the disk :)

Thank you and Happy Sharing, GoRinNoSho

Feel free to try one of my other torrents at http://thepiratebay.org/user/GoRinNoSho/"
