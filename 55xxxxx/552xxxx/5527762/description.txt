Revolting People is a audio situation comedy set in colonial Baltimore, Maryland, just before the American Revolutionary War. The series is written by the British Andy Hamilton and the American Jay Tarses, with Tarses playing a sour shopkeeper named Samuel Oliphant and Hamilton playing a cheerfully corrupt, one-legged, one-eyed, one-armed, one-nostrilled British soldier, Sergeant Roy McGurk.

The story revolved around the imposition of martial law in Baltimore and the springing up of a torrid, though also chaste, love affair between Oliphant's daughter (a notorious anti-British pamphleteer operating under the pseudonym Spartacus) and an officer of the local British garrison, Captain Brimshaw.

A number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.
I have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice
I was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.

There is little point in downloading a "Torrent" and then recreating a "Torrent" using the same files.

The fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,

All you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the "same" files and make both have less seeders.
