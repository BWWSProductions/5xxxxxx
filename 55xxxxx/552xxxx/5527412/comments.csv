,burt2010,2010-12-17T02:43Z,States missing rar00; will not allow .exe to download without it.
,mister.guy24,2011-04-30T20:03Z,"@burt2010 It does work. You need to unzip all the .zip folders and they have files called ""mesmerize.rar"", ""mesmerize.r00"", ""mesmerize.r01"" and so on. Put all of these into one folder and then extract ""mesmerize.rar"". This torrent works perfectly"
