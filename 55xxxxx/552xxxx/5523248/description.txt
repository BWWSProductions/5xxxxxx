Superman has left Earth in the hands of Nightwing, Flamebird, Mon-El and the Guardian. The tensions between Earth and New Krypton are slowly rising. The winds of war are stirring. As our very own Dan DiDio has teased numerous times, 2010 is going to be a huge year for Superman. But just what is going on has not been revealed. Until now. Welcome to the WAR OF THE SUPERMEN.

This lovely piece of J.G. Jones artwork is the cover to WAR OF THE SUPERMEN #0, which will hit stands 5/1/10, as the DCU FREE COMIC BOOK DAY title, and will kick off an event that is sure to change Supermanâ€™s status quo.
