        Since  the  debut  of  the  Dragon  Ball  anime  series,  Toei
        Animation  has  been  producing  feature  films  based  on the
        franchise  since  1986.  Over  seventeen  feature  films  were
        produced, including three films  based on the original  Dragon
        Ball  anime, thirteen films based on the sequel series  Dragon
        Ball  Z,   and  seventeenth   film  commemorating   the  tenth
        anniversary  of  the  series.  The  films  were self-contained
        stories  that  did not  follow  the same  continuity  as their
        television counterpart.

        Fourteen years after the events of the Frieza saga, the  Earth
        is in ruins, terrorized by  a pair of Artificial Humans.  Goku
        is long dead  of a heart  disease and shortly  after, Piccolo,
        Vegeta, Krillin, and the other Z fighters were killed when the
        Artificial  Humans first  arrived. Now  the only  surviving Z
        fighter is  Gohan, who  trains Vegeta's  now 13  year-old son,
        Trunks. Gohan  seems to  be strong  enough now  to take on one
        Android,  but against  both, he  still has  trouble, and  when
        Trunks always  gets in  the way,  it doesn't  get any  easier.
        Finally, Gohan  sustains serious  injury, and  not long  after
        he's healed, he takes on both Androids again. Gohan is  killed
        in battle, finally giving  Trunks the necessary fuel  to reach
        Super Saiyan. This is  the story of the  future.....that never
        was.
