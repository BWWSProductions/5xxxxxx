           At 14 my grandmother's sister disappeared from her home        
           in Israel. Years later, she started sending my family          
           letters with a desperate plea for contact, from a refugee      
           camp, where she lived as an Arab. My Jewish family chose       
           to turn their back on their Arab relative. I discovered        
           her letters after my grandmother died and I set on a           
           painful quest, uncovering the past. I search for my lost       
           family in territories occupied by my country and reveal a      
           story that could only be told in the war-torn Middle           
           East, about one family, on both sides of a conflict.
