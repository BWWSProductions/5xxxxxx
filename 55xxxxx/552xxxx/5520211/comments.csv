,sumit2405,2011-12-11T11:36Z,"I've fallen in love with this movie. What great performances!!!!Hats off to Morgan Freeman for playing one of the most charismatic role of his career. Just a small complaint to the FXG Team....quality could have been a tad better for a 900 MB package(especially in the climax, where the movie sometimes seems to skip a fraction of seconds between frames)....still worth watching a 100 times....kudos for the good job!!!"
