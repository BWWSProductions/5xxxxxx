,blueblood95,2010-04-30T08:23Z,Is this PS3 friendly? Size etc? hanging for a bluray ps3 rip.
,yesbos,2010-04-30T08:41Z,"Guys only different is torrent hash code, since this has no subtitle like in following release.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5512490/Avatar.2009.720p.BDRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON

Anyone need more info, refer above torrent. There is no other different between them in content.

But this release is speed, more seeds actually connect. 
looks at the comments of that release, I tried it for 6 days but at 25.6%. But this one I finished in 1 day and 13h."
,iAMstatic,2010-04-30T12:02Z,a10/v10 legit 720p
,MakMan06,2010-05-01T01:39Z,"""Trust me this is super seed release and u will download this withing a day, Bcos now i'm seeding too. :)""

I'm downloading at 1-5KB/s on a 1.5Mbit/s connection, care to explain that?"
,MakMan06,2010-05-01T02:21Z,"To the person from ""SPCGlobal.net"" in the USA, seeding to me at 150KB/s - I LOVE YOU!!! If you are a chick I'll shag you!"
,yesbos,2010-05-01T08:42Z,"Guys, in pb, we had only 2 releases of this Vision release , ""4.2GB"" (excluding this one). 
One is SUBBED and other is http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5512490/Avatar.2009.720p.BDRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON

So,I tried the above torrent. But after 6 days I was only finished 25.6%. To my luck i found this release and I cud finished 100% in 1 day and 13h.
So Mr. MakMan06, i hope u now maths, but if u cant count hw many time u shag per day, u cant resolve this too. 
U can visit that torrent n jus check the comments, U can find the problem. If i try it, it'll take 24 day for me, via my 512kb connection. But i had in 1day n 13h. 
That y this z super speed.
Jus wait for few hrs, u'll c difference. Bcos this has trusted seeders from Extratorrent."
,MakMan06,2010-05-02T02:27Z,"yes i found a difference - hence my second comment a few hours later. been downloading for 17h and its now finished! - avg speed 65KB/s - not too shabby.

how come the speed of this torrent is so good, compared to others - i see that this one has less leechers though"

,zirali,2010-05-24T15:30Z,hi guys can anyone confirm if this will play on a ps3 and what format is it. As I downloaded an 8gig version that I couldn't transfer to my ps3 thanks. 
,yesbos,2010-06-07T13:06Z,"@zirali,
as original source said, this is ps3 compatible. But i never checked it.
ps3 most compatible with M2TS format, try www.videohelp.com/ for converters."
