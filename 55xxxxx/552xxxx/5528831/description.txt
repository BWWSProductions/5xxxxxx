        Since  the  debut  of  the  Dragon  Ball  anime  series,  Toei
        Animation  has  been  producing  feature  films  based  on the
        franchise  since  1986.  Over  seventeen  feature  films  were
        produced, including three films  based on the original  Dragon
        Ball  anime, thirteen films based on the sequel series  Dragon
        Ball  Z,   and  seventeenth   film  commemorating   the  tenth
        anniversary  of  the  series.  The  films  were self-contained
        stories  that  did not  follow  the same  continuity  as their
        television counterpart.

        The end of  the world is  fast approaching, in  the form of  a
        giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth.  Not of  Goku
        has anything to  say about it!   Goku and Krillin  race to the
        rescue.  Using their incredible powers, they narrowly  deflect
        the asteroid from its deadly course.  The Earth is  saved...or
        is it?

        A  dark  vessel descends  from  the surface  of  the asteroid,
        carrying a powerful new enemy -- the evil overlord, Lord Slug.

        His forces have  come to take  control of the  Earth and steal
        its natural resources, only in the process they intend to wipe
        out the entire human race!   And when Lord Slug discovers  the
        seven  magic  Dragon  Balls,  it  seems  nothing  can  stop is
        diabolical plans from coming to pass!

        Now that Lord Slug  has the power of  the Dragon Balls in  his
        grasp,  can  even Goku  save  the Earth  from  this mysterious
        invader?
