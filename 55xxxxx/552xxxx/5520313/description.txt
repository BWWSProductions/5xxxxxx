SilentNinja NOTES
ok this has been very much a experimental project as i have used sony vegas for about 98% fo the adjustments for colour etc did the angles and straighters etc first though. but due to learning about a new sharpening tool, as i wasn't happy with how mine looked compared to imagines, that's what took a lot of time up as i wanted it to be right.

so after a lot of faffing about, loads of hours spent...oh and i didn't get the files until weeks after imagine released theirs hence why i'm so late with this.

well couldn't get the sharpener right. so used what i normally use but had to use the filter about 4 times to get it near .

i've corrected the colours enough so that its a more natural area, but it was hard, and several scenes were different in the day time.

so i hope you enjoy, and yeah i know there's going to be a lot of bitches out there, but i dont care...go for it..i'll still be here doing what i'm doing

and a little help from a friend to sync imagine's audio to my video because somehow my video was 2 secound shorter.
