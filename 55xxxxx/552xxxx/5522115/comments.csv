The movie plays fine, the problem is on your end.

Use ""VLC Media Player"" or sort your codecs."
,flikflik,2010-06-21T16:10Z,mk2vob can convert this to high def .avi file if you want that. I only download .mkv s anymore and just convert them.
,LytseBarg,2010-06-30T21:12Z,Excellent RIP video/audio is ok. Best seeded flick on the Bay. TY

,afitna44,2011-01-30T19:49Z,"works fine 
THX"
,eatshit2,2012-01-25T10:37Z,Sound is completely messed up. Music is boosted and sound effects are so loud there is digital distortion. Speaking voices too low. I recommend you get another version.
,spifkitten99,2012-03-07T22:43Z,"VLC is shit for some HD movies. If it doesn't play smoothly in VLC, try the GOM player. Also comes with build in codecs, but plays many formats better than VLC."

Obs: for such a big file size I thought the resolution should be 720p, I think you're not using x264 at its full capacity.
