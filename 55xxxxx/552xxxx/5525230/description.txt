Poor Righteous Teachers were a Hip Hop group from Trenton, New Jersey, founded in 1989. Often referred to as PRT by their fans, Poor Righteous Teachers were known as pro-Black conscious hip hop artists, with musical content inspired by the teachings of the Nation of Gods and Earths. Wise Intelligent, as the lead MC, was the most visible and well known member of the group. Culture Freedom provided backing vocals and production and Father Shaheed served as a DJ and producer. Its discography, for the most part on Profile Records, is out of print, and Profile Records is now controlled by Arista Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment.
