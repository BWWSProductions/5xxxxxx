,Cespur,2010-05-02T01:01Z,Thanks! Any chance you will be uploading 5 in m4v or mp4? I gotta convert every single episode now to make it play on my Apple TV/iPhone/iPad.
,grandy88,2010-05-02T21:56Z,"I won't be doing mp4...mkv is a smaller container and most prefer it that way.

Please help me seed guys, doing as much as I can but I'm not getting much help."
