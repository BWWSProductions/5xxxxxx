        Since  the  debut  of  the  Dragon  Ball  anime  series,  Toei
        Animation  has  been  producing  feature  films  based  on the
        franchise  since  1986.  Over  seventeen  feature  films  were
        produced, including three films  based on the original  Dragon
        Ball  anime, thirteen films based on the sequel series  Dragon
        Ball  Z,   and  seventeenth   film  commemorating   the  tenth
        anniversary  of  the  series.  The  films  were self-contained
        stories  that  did not  follow  the same  continuity  as their
        television counterpart.
