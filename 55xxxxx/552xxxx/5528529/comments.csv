Many thanks RitchieRich"
,subsquare,2010-05-05T12:05Z,"PS.

after reading the post above it looks like the user may have done things in the wrong order.

You MUST run the activation crack BEFORE running the program.

When you run the program it'll ask for a serial, put one in and, if you've run the crack at the beginning like it asks, it'll continue to run. sweet!"

Thanks!"
,76dragon,2010-05-05T16:23Z,"For all of you that have problems with installation
I thought it would be useful to post step by step installation instructions. I already posted them at the ""Adobe CS5 Master Collection [MAC]"" torrent on The Pirate Bay and thought several commenters in this thread would find it useful. In particular read the ""REMOVE....."" section of this post if you have problems with your Adobe installations. With respect to where to go for your installation packages: I prefer to get them from the torrents. They are the same as what you download from the Adobe website. However, there has been some discussion on Demonoid about Adobe matching registration info with your IP address when you download the package. I'm not sure about the validity of this claim but I prefer to play safe and get the packages via torrents.

If you follow the steps below you will not have to run the ""Block Activation"" script included in this torrent. Basically the ""Terminal"", ""TextEdit"" and ""Finalize Adobe CS5 Installation"" steps below guide you manually through the automated ""Block Activation"" script. Please install CS5 in the way that you prefer.

You may notice below that I recommend to ""turn off Airport"" during installation and to run ""sudo dscacheutil -flushcache"" after updating the /etc/hosts file. I'm not sure if these steps are necessary but I recommend to do so anyway. Also notice the link to Acrobat 9 Pro at the bottom of the post:

REMOVE OLD ADOBE INSTALLATIONS (IF APPLICABLE) BEFORE INSTALLING ADOBE CS5
Remove the following Adobe applications, folders and files before installing the Adobe CS5 Master Collection (but check notes below this list first):
/Applications/Adobe... (everything with Adobe)
/Library/Application Support/Adobe
/Library/Application Support/FLEXnet Publisher
/Library/Preferences/com.adobe... (everything with com.adobe)
/Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher
~/Library/Application Support/Adobe
~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Acrobat
~/Library/Preferences/Acrobat
~/Library/Preferences/Acrobat Distiller Prefs
~/Library/Preferences/Adobe... (everything with Adobe)
~/Library/Preferences/com.adobe... (everything with com.adobe)

A few notes:
- / is the system root folder (which you can find in Finder by clicking on the hard drive icon at devices)
- ~ is the User folder (which you can find in Finder by clicking on the home icon at places)
- I strongly recommend to delete the ""/Library/Application Support/FLEXnet Publisher"" and ""/Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher"" folders if you have old Adobe applications installed. Keeping an old version of this folder can cause a variety of licensing errors. It will automatically be regenerated with the CS5 installation.
- Obviously, if you're attached to your old Adobe application preferences, don't delete the preferences files in the system and User libraries. There is no harm in doing so, they'll be automatically regenerated but by deleting them you will loose your user preferences. I prefer to start with a clean system but that may not be the case for everybody.

INSTALLATION OF ADOBE CS5
Disconnect from network/internet (Turn AirPort Off). Double click ""CS5_Master_Collection.dmg"" to install the Adobe CS5 Master Collection. Whilst installing CS5, ensure that you choose ""Install this product as a trial"" and DO NOT enter any serials. If you've already installed CS5 applications using a serial, load any of the installed CS5 applications and select Help > Deactivate. Quit all of the installed CS5 applications.

TERMINAL
Launch a Terminal window (in /Applications/Utilities) and copy and paste:
sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts

Hit return and type your admin password.
The ""hosts"" file should automatically open in TextEdit.

TEXTEDIT
If the following lines are already part of the ""hosts"" file close it and continue with the ""Finish"" section. If not hit return (in the opened ""hosts"" file) and copy and paste following lines:
127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 ereg.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate."
,76dragon,2010-05-05T16:28Z,"One more comment, there is NO such thing as a crack in the activation block script, which is provided in this torrent. The script simply blocks a list of Adobe servers by adding them to the ""/etc/hosts"" file on your Mac to prevent communication. Read my big post for details."
,RitchieRich,2010-05-05T18:19Z,"@iluvwarez

Yes as you may have realized, this crack is for MAC OS X! This one works PERFECT! I still have it on my MacBook and have NO problems! I'm truly sorry that you have been having problems with my WINDOWS torrent but nothing in this world is 100% affective.There are going to be some people that just won't be able to get it to work. I sorry that you fall under that group. The only thing I can tell you now is to get a MAC then you will be happy with a crack that works! "
,RitchieRich,2010-05-05T18:20Z,"@subsquare

Thanks for the comment!!! I'm happy to see you know what you're doing. :)"
,RitchieRich,2010-05-05T18:25Z,"@g-roid

That is correct. If you already had blocked CS4 than you don't need to worry about running the script.

@76dragon

You are also correct that this torrent isn't a crack and it says nowhere that it is. It provides you with serials and it AUTOMATICALLY edits the host files for the person so they don't have to. It's all about streamlining the process. :)"
,76dragon,2010-05-05T19:31Z,"@RitchieRich I agree that streamlining the process is useful. However, I also think it's useful to point other users to the simple manual method and lay out what really happens. Moreover, if you have any trouble follow with your Adobe installations read my big post, in particular the ""REMOVE..."" section."

,Tanishk,2010-05-06T16:44Z,Do I have to delete CS4 or CS3 before I install this
,76dragon,2010-05-06T17:58Z,"@Tanishk You don't have to remove old installations. However, I strongly recommend to at least delete the ""/Library/Application Support/FLEXnet Publisher"" and ""/Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher"" folders and re-enter the relevant serial upon opening an Adobe application. By keeping your old FLEXnet Publisher folders you may run into licensing errors. "
[T],g-roid,2010-05-07T13:49Z,"@76dragon

Yes, there is no crack. I was mistakenly calling the Activation Blocker Script a crack.

Think of Akamai as a download manager for Adobe. When you go and download a trial from Adobe it makes you download that piece of software to download from their servers. After you download the trial you can delete Akamai from your computer."

To get just a lil political, our world leaders are trying to push through a Copyright Treaty (written and supported by MPAA and RIAA and others like them) which will bring forth a sort of ""Three Strikes"" law with regards to downloading anything that infringes copyright.. on that third strike your ISP will drop your service... no more internet for you or your household.

This hasn't been set in stone yet, but with just an IP address from the trial download on the Adobe website, they WOULD have access to you and your information.

Proxy sites will be a MUST in the years to come..

I hope this doesn't come across as sounding too dim, but I can't seem to get the torrent to download.

anyone got any ideas?"
,76dragon,2010-05-13T17:43Z,"@cwgd You must be new to BitTorrents.

- Definition: BitTorrents are a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. BitTorrent relies on each user having a piece of the file to be downloaded and sharing those pieces amongst the other users who are downloading (and uploading) the same torrent.

- You need to get a bittorrent client to open the torrent and start downloading (and sharing). On a Mac Google and install ""Transmission"" or ""uTorrent"", I can recommend both. On a Windows machine I recommend ""uTorrent"".

- Open your torrent after installing the client to start the download (and sharing). Many other sites (e.g. demonoid & btjunkie and many others) use BitTorrents and often share the same torrents.

- The healthiness of a torrent will depend on how many Seeders it has. Seeders are users that fully downloaded the torrent but still share (upload) it with other users. Leechers only have part of the download and can therefore only upload that part to other users. These details can be found in the torrent description."

You probably couldn't download it because you don't have a program that downloads torrents. I would recommend uTorrent. Once you download that free piece of software you will be able to download this torrent just fine."

,RitchieRich,2011-03-04T05:30Z,"@18days
Yes you can remove the entries that the script puts in the hosts file. Simply open the terminal app which is located in your utilities folder by default. Next, type this in the window without the quotes ""$ sudo nano /private/etc/hosts"". Then when prompted type in your password. A new window will open which will be your hosts file. Simply delete all the Adobe entries then save the file. After you save reboot your computer and everything should be back up. "

This torrent works with Adobe CS5 and not CS5.5. Adobe changed things in their 5.5 update which renders these serials invalid. "
,Peregr1n,2011-07-23T18:18Z,Can anyone confirm if this works with Lion? Thanks
,RitchieRich,2011-07-24T04:05Z,"@Peregr1n

Works just fine in Lion. "

,ewave,2011-07-25T05:28Z,"Does anyone know how to hold onto the CS5.5 version of Adobe Master Collection? My trial version is counting down and it appears as if they've put in a ""call home"" line that won't let the software activate without connecting back to the mothership. Anyone on this? I wish I knew enough to help!"
,tt62,2011-07-25T10:01Z,"Has anyone installed this, and then tried to update the software when the Adobe Updater Manager says there are upgrades?

What were the results?"

,fredfrenette,2011-09-10T01:53Z,"Finally! Thanks a million RitchieRich for your kind help. For over a month now I was desperately trying to find a way to unlock the Photoshop CS5... I tried hundreds of serial numbers; I tried to play with the ""Terminal"" without destroying anything. Nothing worked so far. But, thanks to you Richie, I can now enjoy the whole Master Collection.  The script works perfectly. I strongly suggest to download the Master Collection directly from ADOBE (like I did) and take the time to get the full collection locally. With the script activated, everything works perfectly.
Don't hesitate to download Ritchie's Torrent. It works (for a change!)"

Thank you for the kind words! If you ever upgrade to Adobe CS5.5 check out my other torrent with has serials for CS5.5."

If you want CS5 you can download it from here on the Bay. If not, then download CS5.5 and use my other torrent listed below.
