,boy_india,2010-05-04T09:35Z,"very slow seed, please update"
,spurs4ever,2010-05-04T23:56Z,"@ boy_india - the seed is not very slow. I managed to download it in approx. 1hr 30mins here in London. I'd suggest upgrading your 56k connection and getting a proper router instead of using that cabbage you call a modem.

Anyhow...

File-wise don't bother downloading this.

The video looks like it was recorded in a cinema with a camcorder - it probably was judging by the wobbly/shaky video. The quality is about the same as a VCD.

The audio is pretty bad. You can hear everything but it has this constant static/hiss in the background.

Worth a download? No, unless you are desperate to see this movie. I'm not even sure why xRG bothered uploading it when he'll eventually upload a proper DVD rip.

I appreciate the time and effort xRG spends providing us with Bollywood movies and would prefer it if he could upload DVD rips of less recent movies. Maybe some quality music video collections too?

xRG's rips are pretty damn good. His BR rip of Rocket Singh was excellent. So why bother with mediocre Pre-DVD rips?"

,msaadn,2010-07-23T00:26Z,"Video quality is not all that great, and the audio quality seems to be low or somewhat ok. And I'm not sure about this, but I think the subtitles are out of sync.

Thanks for the share Team_xRG."
