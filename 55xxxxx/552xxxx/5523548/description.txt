Dear Warrior Friend,

You are about to find out exactly how I make over 10k per month online. 

I have refined and developed my system over the past few months and you are about to see my simple yet deadly approach to making niche content sites.

I do what works and discard the rest. I have no time for activities which do not add anything to my bottom line. OH and I love FREE TRAFFIC. 

Here is what the system is NOT about:

- No spending money on expensive PPC ads.

- No time wasting on so called WEB 2.0 crap and spamming the hell out of them.

- No posting ads on Craigslist or other classified sites.

- No making 100s of sites hoping each will make you 50 cents a day. 

- No writing hundreds of articles building somebody else's business.

- No piggybacking off product launches to make money for a week and then have the sites die out.

- Nothing BlueFart

We crank out sites that take a few hours to make and promote and get our slice of Google's traffic. I like this idea so much that I call it "Google Slicer". How creative am I?

We are not talking about little traffic either. Slicer sites get thousands of visitors a month bringing in long term hands off income.
