Olivier Messiaen's world renowned 20th century masterpiece Turangalila-Symphonie, and his less well known yet almost as brilliant L'ascension are presented here by Antoni Wit and the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra in all their glory. Easily the best performance of Turangalila ever recorded, from the conductor to the musicians to the recording quality and subtle integration of the Ondes-Martenot (an electronic instrument which Messiaen championed in many of his works).
