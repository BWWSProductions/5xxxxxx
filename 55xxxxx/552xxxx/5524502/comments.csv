,m00nman,2010-05-13T12:44Z,VERY VERY VERYYYYY good collection. I love every track and it brings nostalgia. I only wish this came in better quality.
,Jompman76,2010-06-15T02:20Z,"I love you!

2 h till downloaded...

I have found some titles that I had forgotten that I love and when I glance through the list it's all familiar.

The work you have done is great. Ok, maybe the 128 songs can't be played in clubs but now my slow brain have names to look for.

Tnx for making the world a little better!"
,manmachine1,2010-06-17T01:57Z,"Thanks for support fellas!Sure there are tracks that are no strictly dancefloor killers but surely are masterpieces and worth putting.The fact is that (this kind of) music was my whole life back then...I neglected my further education in favor of partying,waiting for late night radio shows with my cassette deck on standby,smuggling dj sets and mixes(also on tapes),rented,stolen and borrowed CD compilations(pretty shitty situation in Croatia these years),thinking only on new records and tracks every weekend,following our DJs wherever they played...ah these were the days...we were in a way pioneers in techno and rave culture over here...and to cut the crap...the fact is that the pirate bay community deserves to have such a collection! Keep on groovin!"
,splatmonki,2010-07-16T12:33Z,"Awesome collection. Whilst you were misbehaving in Croatia, we were doing the same in South Africa. Thanks for the uploadnn"
