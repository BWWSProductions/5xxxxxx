I remember having read once that hundreds of years ago a christian mission of some monks went to muslim Spain to try to convert those people and after patiently listening, the muslims confounded the monks by saying: how can you believe that god can be born and die, like a man, thatÂ´s absurd... They went back to France frustrated and disheartened. IÂ´m an atheist but I enjoy listening to those who believe in invisible things display their superstitions and confront one another."
