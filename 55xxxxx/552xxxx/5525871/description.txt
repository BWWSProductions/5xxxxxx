Plot 
Talking heads. A look at the art of ventriloquists. The first half examines basic issues, such as establishing two clear personalities for "vent" and dummy, the importance of not moving lips, the range of comedy that's possible, and the doors that opened when Jim Johnson appeared on "Soap" with his dummy.
