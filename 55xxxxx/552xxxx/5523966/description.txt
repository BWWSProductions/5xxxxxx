Richard Hammond journeys into the parallel universe that 
lies beyond the limits of the naked eye, in Richard 
Hammond's Invisible World, part of BBC One's Science & 
Nature programming. Using state-of-the-art imaging 
technologies, Richard discovers that it's as much the 
things we cannot see as those we can that shape our 
lives. From spectacular natural phenomena such as vast, 
superfast lightning clusters, to one of the wonders of 
the living world - the hidden aerodynamics of bats - 
and our own technological achievements such as the 
awe-inspiring aerial work conducted on high-voltage 
power lines, Richard explores the hidden secrets of 
the invisible world around us.

Episode 1: Explores the world of 'invisible light' 
that surrounds us at all times.

Episode 2: Delve into the invisible world too quick 
for the human eye, with advances in imaging technology 
that can enhance human visual perception as never before.

Episode 3: Explore the invisible world unfolding on too 
small a scale, or at too remote a distance, to be seen by 
the naked eye; an entirely microscopic realm - and a 
miniature world.
