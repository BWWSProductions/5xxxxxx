Memtest x86 v4.0 



WHAT IS MEMTEST
----------------------------------------
Memtest is a small image that you burn to a cd, and boot to a computer with to test its ram. The test does not have a finish, although it loops through the ram checking over and over for bad address spaces. 

Personally after one hour if Memtest hasn't found a bad sector in your ram, your ram is good!


HOW TO USE
----------------------------------------
Burn to an image, and boot to the cd from any computer you think the ram is bad and want to test with.
