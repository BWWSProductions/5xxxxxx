The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night 

PS2-DVD NTSC 2007

The end of Eternal Night's predecessor, A New Beginning, left Spyro mostly bereft of his powers and the Dark Master on the loose. This time around, Gaul and his Ape army are up to no good, holding Cynder captive and seeking to revive Spyro's archenemy. The titular hero is again joined by Sparx the dragonfly, this time annoyingly voiced by Billy West. Gary Oldman and Elijah Wood are back as well.

This is a combat-heavy platformer, so you'll often need to handle a good number of cookie-cutter enemies at once. Spyro's tail attack is your basic combat move, though over the course of the game, you'll gain access to new elemental attacks in four different categories and string them together into various combos. The special attacks will likely elicit dÃ©jÃ  vu for returning fans, with the exception of the newly introduced bullet time--or if you want to be technical, dragon time. Indeed, you can now slow down time for a few moments. You'll need to use dragon time often, sometimes for solving a handful of simplistic puzzles, but more often than not, just to stay alive. 

When things kick into high gear, there are some entertaining moments to be had when you manage to string attacks together while kicking into slow motion. The visuals are colorful and full of particle effects. Some environments are lovely to look at, while the pretty soundtrack does an admirable job of setting a properly fantastical tone. 

Seed people - this was made especially to keep it alive - hard to find in NTSC format.
