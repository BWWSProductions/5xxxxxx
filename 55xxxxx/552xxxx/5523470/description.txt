Real Time with Bill Maher: 2010 04 30

Interview guests: Former UN ambassador John Bolton and Rep Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.).

Panelists: Commentator Chris Matthews, columnist Ross Douthat and economist Laura Tyson

The resolution is 608x352 and the video quality is quite watchable in my opinion.
