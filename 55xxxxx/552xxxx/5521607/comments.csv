,Lightishere,2010-04-30T13:50Z,"Oh really nice genius, you Atleast you didn't take all the credits, next time you should give the credits to where you find it."
,Lightishere,2010-04-30T13:51Z,"It does work, but crack is far from complete, so you will have to wait a long time until it is finished. "
,plufi,2010-04-30T13:57Z,"UBISOFT is a bitch, everyone boycott it
well kinda obvious i guess since we are all on TPB :D
But i mean this in a very real way, boycott, tell your friends, don't let them buy ubishit software, they don't want to share their work with us, so we'll vote with our pockets"

Don't worry about it, that's the way the server emulator works, if you check ACII's emulator you'll see that you need to change this hosts file

,DrDean,2010-07-30T22:14Z,"It doesn't appear to be working for me, but that may be my fault from fucking with so many cracks and updates etc.

Here is the error I'm getting.
""UbisoftGameLauncher.exe - Entry Point Not Found

The procedure entry point ?StartSavegameSync@Proxy@orbitdll@mg@@QAEXIW4TestMode@SavegameStorage@23@PAVITestStatusCallback@523@@Z could not be located in the dynamic link library ubiorbitapi_r2.dll"""
,DrDean,2010-07-30T23:26Z,"Okay, so I've gotten past that error I just posted. It appears like this should work, but the maps aren't appearing ingame. I think the problem is the crack I'm using (SKIDROW) has an .ini file that contains my login information for Ubisoft's thing, which isn't letting it use my real account for some reason. "
,VpS_Serenity,2010-12-07T19:46Z,"How did you fix the error: 

StartSavegameSync@Proxy@orbitdll@mg@@QAEXIW4TestMode@SavegameStorage@23@PAVITestStatusCallback@523@@Z was not found in the ubiorbitapi_r2.dll

I can't get rid of it, it's really bothering me, please help!"
