,L4rk3m0n,2010-05-04T09:45Z,"I downloaded this torrent yesterday and got a nasty trojan, i didnt get it from this torrent tho, google chrome popped up saying this page may harm your comp, i stupidly ignored the warning... i got rid of the trojan masquerading as an anti virus prgram but now i cant browse any pages in google chrome, firefox, opera or InternetExplorer (6,7 or 8).. thnx for the torrent upload, but shame on TPB for allowing this trojan on what i once regarded an awesome site.

IF ANYONE CAN HELP ME BROWSE AGAIN ON MY COMP AGAIN I WOULD APPRECIATE IT ALOT (anyone else have this problem yesterday?)"
