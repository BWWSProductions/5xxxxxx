[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-05-03T02:01Z,"Don't worry, you guys will eventually get sick of the repetitive, droning voice of Mr. Jones. Additionally, you'll get tired of the ""buy my videos"" ranting and over-the-top clowning (literally) around.

More importantly, hopefully you will see that they paints a picture of an illusive, shadowy enemy without really targeting the real culprits behind this world conspiracy 

Jones has already admitted he supports the illegal state of Israel. Most of his radio and website advertizers are Zionists, his wife is a Zionist, his friends are Zionist, Hollywood is Zionsit and Jones has many Hollywood friends. Now, the Zionist owned Sirius radio broadcasts the Alex Jones show.

Time to wake up folks. I mean, really. You should have clued into this a long time ago. What is your excuse?"
