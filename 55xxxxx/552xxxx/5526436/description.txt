This release is an accomplishment of weeks of investigating, experimenting, testing and lots of hard work.


Our work does not construct any program deviation or any kind of host file paradox solutions. Install game and copy the cracked content, it's that simple.   


The cracking method is still the same for each title. It's the handling of the data being sent/received between the Ubisoft servers, and the decryption methods of it, that takes time to do properly.


Real cracking is done by The Leading Force!
