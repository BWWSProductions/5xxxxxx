Sci-fi sitcom about Robin Lightfoot, a confirmed bachelor who wakes up one day in a parallel universe where he is married with two children

Robin Lightfoot is a confirmed bachelor with a successful architectural business. One day however, he wakes up to find himself in a parallel universe where he is married to Leslie and has two children: Ned and Maxine.

Robin discovers that the version of Robin in this universe is a horrible man - a cad, a womanizer, a swindler and possibly even a murderer. The only person who believes that he comes from a different universe is his 'son' Ned, because he reads comic books set in parallel universes.

While Robin tries to deal with adjusting to married life, he must also come to terms with the other differences in this new universe: he is living in a world where the North-East of England is economically prosperous while his home county of Surrey is depressed; Tony Blair is the leader of Conservative party but the power is in the hands of the Lib Dems; and a world in which Arthur Smith is a children's entertainer.

A number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.
I have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice
I was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.

There is little point in downloading a "Torrent" and then recreating a "Torrent" using the same files.

The fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,

All you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the "same" files and make both have less seeders.
