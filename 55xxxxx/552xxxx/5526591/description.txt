Tell Ol' Bill Recording Session

This 72 minute CD starts part way into an early take of the song and continues through twelve more takes. This is a fascinating release for those interested in the mind of Bob in the studio, as you get to hear how his ideas progress from song conception to the finished product. This is how many artists record in the studio. Dylan has long been known to avoid spending a lot of time in the studio, and has let many mistakes be printed to tape because of his 'one take' philosophy and disdain for the studio process. That makes it doubly nice that such a tape as this exists. This is an incredible quality recording, and is sourced from the same master as the Rattle Snake release.
