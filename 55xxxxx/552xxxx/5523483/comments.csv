heres a shot captured http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/7206/vlcsnap2010050914h49m11.png

theres a black bar only at the bottom. And the hardcoded subtitles are placed in a strange way like u see in the above snapshot.

Cant watch it like this, too bad. Downloading an other torrent"

,true_evil,2011-01-08T16:14Z,"yes, this is cropped wrong. get another copy."
,nehoc,2011-04-28T17:37Z,"Agree with previous comments, very strange cropping, subs hardcoded on black bottom of the screen..."
,bwv812,2011-05-15T17:07Z,"Have no idea why this is the most popular/seeded 400 blows torrent. The quality is pretty bad, it's not a rip of the Criterion, the hardcoded subs are way below the picture in the bottom letterbox area (explaining the weird crop necessary to have them appear, since the top letterbox is cropped), and it's a larger file than the other one. Avoid."
