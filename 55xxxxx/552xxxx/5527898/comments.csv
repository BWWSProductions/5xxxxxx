,oldtimer48,2012-07-10T02:39Z,"@martyhow44, I had the same problem, it appears is ISO or IFO, convertX did not recognise the file, eventually I tried AVS7 video converter which converted it to dvd, however .mp4 files are small and the actual viewing area is minimised to a smaller letter box in centre screen about half screen size. The Quality is A/9, V/9, black and white and the movie is also one of John Wayne's best, despite the setbacks I quite enjoyed the movie. Thank you alien99, and thank you seeders. I hope one day someone will upload a full screen copy, the movie is worth it."
