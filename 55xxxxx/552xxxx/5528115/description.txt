These three pieces are examples of the kind of American classical music that Charles Ives railed against.  The composers are American by location, but thoroughly European in training and style.  The Canning, for example, takes an American hymn tune, but gives it a treatment much like Vaughan Williams.  Ives notwithstanding, this is still lovely music, and well worth a listen.
