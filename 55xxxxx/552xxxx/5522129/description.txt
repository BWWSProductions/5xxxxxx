I love Chinese characters, so I did something fancy: 

a poster with 10000 somewhat Chinese characters ordered by frequency. 

Even if you can't read and understand them all, you'll surely appreciate the unique artistic pathos of this little artwork. 

Measurements: 

it's big. 130 wide x 187 high cm.
every character is 1 x 1 cm.

Note that these characters are standard Chinese = traditional characters.

educated people are supposed to know 3000-4000 characters.
So on this poster you have the opportunity to enjoy the visual beauty and insanity of "some" very rare Chinese characters.

Enjoy!
