(Also: wrong category!)"

Thanks for reminding! I changed the category to E-books. Actually it's just a poster. Anyway.

Again, I am sorry, I can't add the English translation for all of these 10000 characters. :) 
This is supposed to be art, it doesn't have an educational purpose. 
Have a nice day!"

Btw, I just can't understand why someone gave you a -1. If you get to this page, than you're interested in 10,000 Chinese characters on one single PDF, and that's exactly what you get. So this person either came here by accident, or just because he hates seeing 10,000 Chinese characters on one single PDF.
So the way I see it, he gave another person -1 because HE is the idiot around here.

So I'm giving you a +1 to get rid of it.  "
