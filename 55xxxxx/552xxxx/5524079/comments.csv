First off, you have to be part of their affiliate program that costs money, (but after two sales, you make back that money).

Then it says no startup cost, and yet it has you subscribe...What happened to the no start up cost?

Another problem I've run into is that people won't buy shit off of facebook so good luck making ""sales."" I didn't quite get what exactly are we supposed to sell...

Compounding that, if people see ads for stupid shit (see sales above), they'll just immediately block you.

This sounds good in theory, but I doubt it will work the way you want it to..."
