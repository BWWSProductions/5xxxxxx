DIVADOWN is a dutch emorock band, founded at the start of 2007. Inspired by bands such as Emery, Saosin and Face Tomorrow, all members bounce up and down the stage with a tight and energetic set.

"Risen Thoughts & Fallen Feelings", their first official E.P., was well taken by the media. The E.P. contains eight tracks and was released at the close of 2009.

The band has already performed  at venues such as â€™t Paard van Troje, Waterfront, Xinix, De Groene Engel, Wantijpop and Bibelot, where theyâ€™ve supported bands like The Hot Stewards, Failsafe (UK), Malkovich, This Beautiful Republic (USA) and Face Tomorrow.

DIVADOWN also set some steps outside of The Netherlands, and played in the Ancienne Belgique, Belgiums biggest venue.

Some songs of DIVADOWN can be found on the promo cd "Schoolâ€™s Out vol. 4." due to the fact the band reached the finals of the "Highschool Music Competition 2008". The band also made it to dutch finals of "The Next Stage 2008/2009".

With emotion and creativity incorporated in their songs, and over half of the band studying at the Dutch Popacademy, there certainly can be spoken of a passion for music!
