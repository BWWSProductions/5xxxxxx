,nico.fury,2010-05-06T12:09Z,"thecbreiny11,

I am super new with torrents and I know this may sound not smart at all. But once you are done with the installation, It asks you to register. There are only to options, ""register now"" or ""register later"". I used the latter. I am assuming we are not suppose to ever register or update correct? ... By the way, your torrent is awesome and very easy to install. Thanks a lot."

,mr_dobolina,2010-07-18T23:31Z,"Super awesome file, but I'm having a couple minor issues. It's a .dmg file. I've installed the main programs just fine but it still keeps asking me to insert discs to install any of the add-ons. Also, I keep getting feedback when I try to use the software instruments in Logic Pro. My MIDI set-up works just fine with any other program. Any help is greatly appreciated. And thanks for the awesome and quick torrent!!"

,SellSoultheMachine,2011-02-12T15:56Z,well it DL for me in less that 9 hours so not bad.. ill let any one know if i have issues... have toast.. 
,SellSoultheMachine,2011-02-12T17:39Z,"ok.. let me tell you why piratebay is the best god damn website ever.. i was using logic 8 in a studio application which i legally bought from apple. my mac got fried. nothing to do with viruses or anything, but i had to reset everything. this douchbag stole my copy of logic 8. then dissapeard. when i rebooted my mac it was like bran new i had to reinstall the entire mac osx. but no logic. the only recording periphrial i had to use was garageband. and i couldnt afford to purchase logic 9 at this moment. so i got reason and various movies (download district 9 look for the mp4 file its amazing) from piratebay and i desided to give logic 9 a shot i mean what the hell right?? so it took me about 8 hours to completly download. and i downloaded toast. now i have no idea what im doing. i do music i dont hack software. i followed the instructions listed below and put the serial number in. when it prompted me to install the next disk i noticed my mac was rapidly opening files so i left it. wouldnt you know the numbers game demo song pops up and i open it. logic 9. everything. it runs perfectly. i closed the please put in the next disk thing i cancelled the install yet everything is there. the whole program from what i can tell. this torrent download works. it is perfect. heres my system specs 2.66 gig intel core duo 2 gig 800 mhz ddr2sdram running osx 10.5.8 (before you open make sure you have 10.5.8) but it works perfectly. thank you guys sooo much. if you can tell me how to open the files up in utorrent ill seed. i was seeding but i had to restart mac. you guys rock. and for anyone unsure about downloading and running it works its virus free according to sophos and if i managed to do it anyone can.. THANK YOU PIRATEBAY!"

,Klatu666,2011-08-10T06:50Z,"To those who has the audio content discs when it asks for them under installation. You donÂ´t need to buy expensive DL DVDs to burn them. To install them, get hold of Toast Titanium. Toast can mount disc images and .dmg files and it shows as a dvd mounted drives. Mount them through /utilities/mount Image and the Logic setup automaticly installs them. Mount second content when it asks for them and so on.. Easy squeezy.."
