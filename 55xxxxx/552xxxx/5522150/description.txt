         NOVA presents "Behavioral Economics," an exploration of       
         why mainstream economists failed to predict the crash         
         of 2008 and why we so often make irrational financial         
         decisions. The mysterious and surprising nature of the        
         two most powerful forces on the planet: the human mind        
         and money are exposed. Complelling experiments reveal         
          controversial new arguments about the world of finance.

         We're not sure how a progam shot in the US by a US crew       
         managed to have such a shitty mix of 24, 50, and 60Hz         
         content, but somehow WGBH managed. We elected to leave        
          this at 30fps because RePal would just fuck it up worse.
