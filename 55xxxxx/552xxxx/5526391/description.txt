Inside the Battle of Okinawa (The Pacific)

An inside look at the battle of Okinawa, which became one of the biggest battles in the Pacific and had the highest number of casualties in WWII. (quoted from HBO Canada website)

Various footage (historical and from "The Pacific") dramatizes the words of Eugene Sledge, Tom Hanks, several members of the 1st Marine Division and some historians.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. The video is 9:14 in length.
