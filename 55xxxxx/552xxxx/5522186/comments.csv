I think v9.0.0.190 is the latest? I mention this because the software will try to update the program before allowing the driver DB to update??"
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-05-01T02:56Z,This is *** v9.0.0.190 ***! I just finished downloading! It's just ML having some fun with us...

,honunet,2010-05-10T11:37Z,"great program great up thanks, serial and everything works great.  Your instructions are for shit though lol.  I suspect it is the language barrier as English is not your first.  For newbies who dont knowhow to instal programs like this, pay attention to all his instructions except the part about copying.  Do NOT copy the dribergenius.exe in the install directory (C:program files:driversoft etc..) instead copy it from the crack subfolder after you extract. THEN paste it into the instal directory.  This is after you install it first of course.  And remember to disconnect internet.  That should solve a few of your probs those of you who say it does not work.  Once again thanks Murlok"
