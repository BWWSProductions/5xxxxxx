      Richard Hammond hosts another episode of TV's stupidest,
      brightest, most insane game show. Richard's co-host Amanda Byram
      is course-side in Buenos Aires as 20 foolhardy Brits tackle the
      purpose-built Argentinian course. There is 10,000 pounds for the
      winner and the additional plaudit of being crowned the Total
      Wipeout champion. To get there all the winner has to do is
      master the Sucker Punch, the Big Red Balls, Crash Mountain,
      Dizzy Dummies and the Wipeout Zone.
