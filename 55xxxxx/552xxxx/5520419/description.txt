Not to be confused with the like-vintage Brazilian film Besame Mucho, the Italian-Spanish Besame  is a confusing melange of several genres. Sara Montiel, Maurice Ronet, and Franco Fabrizi are the most recognizable faces appearing on camera during the film's 101 minutes. Per the title, which translates to "Kiss Me", the film spotlights plenty of romantic entanglements. These are subjugated to a dizzying progression of espionage activities, wherein no one is able to separate the good guys from the bad guys. Films in Review magazine used to refer to international spy flicks like Besame  as "kaleidescopes"-as apt a description as any for this almost indescribable romp.
