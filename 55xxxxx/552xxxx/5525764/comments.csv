,The Hawk,2010-05-06T16:19Z,"POSSIBLE VIRUS!  WARNING!  

Just got hit with a nasty virus after installing this.  Program ""n2base.exe"" fired up and nailed my laptop.  I'm not saying this program has a virus in it, but my computer got infected right after I installed this program and it was clean before I installed.  I just want to warn everyone, if it happens to you also, then maybe it does have a virus.  "
,The Hawk,2010-05-06T16:25Z,"DEAMON TOOLS USER WARNING!

REMOVE DEAMON TOOLS BEFORE INSTALLING!  

Some how the program damaged SPTD.SYS, or was it the virus?   Anyway, computer wouldn't even boot into safe mode!  Had to boot into DOS than use NTFS4DOS to mount the drive, than delete SPTD.SYS manually to get the laptop to boot up.

Just wanted to throw this info out here in case it helps someone.    "
,The Hawk,2010-05-06T16:31Z,"It WILL install.  It is VERY slow.  

When you first run it, it will hang for about 5 minutes, but than it will start working.  

I'm very suspicious about that startup delay.  I think the installer might be infected with some sort of stealth virus."

,Yondering,2010-05-09T09:25Z,"re: Virus ""N2base.exe""

The Hawk is correct!  
My firewall blocked this program...
Shows as ""Installer 1.4.4.5""

Where is this N2base located, and how do ""we"" get rid of it?
"
,Yondering,2010-05-09T09:39Z,"The Hawk is correct, re:  N2base.exe

Firewall blocked n2base.exe, 2+ hrs. after Nero install. 
Firewall also shows it as ""Installer 1.4.4.5""

I'm trying to isolate the offending file...
Any help would be appreciated."
