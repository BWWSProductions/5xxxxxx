Description:
â€˜Diamond Eyesâ€™ works the way good records used to; each song carries you a little further away from your bad day until finally, youâ€™ve been transported to a place that feels a wass* lot better than where you started. Thereâ€™s also a newfound sense of purpose that makes Deftonesâ€™ sixth album stand out. The band recorded the album after their best friend and bassist Chi Cheng sustained a debilitating brain injury from a car accident in November of 2008. The tangle of Stephen Carpenterâ€™s woozy, undulating guitar work and Morenoâ€™s soaring then secretive vocal style is the bittersweet dynamic behind each of Deftonesâ€™ records, including â€˜Diamond Eyes.â€™ The friction drives the music as much as it does the players, though it doesnâ€™t always make life easy for childhood friends Carpenter and Moreno. â€˜What makes us work?â€™ asks Carpenter. â€˜Chino will give you the exact opposite answer that I do. Thatâ€™s the way it is with us-we contradict each other constantly but itâ€™s also what makes our music what it is-intense and different.â€™
