,uberdoku,2011-03-10T05:26Z,"not a big fan of the narration--it sounds like she's breathing into the microphone at times, and thus isn't often very clear. just finished listening to Brave New World and the narrator was exquisite, so perhaps i'm just spoiled. sounds like this just needs to be edited.

nonetheless, thank you infinitely for the access, VoxRatio."

Today in the US economy, it is mixed, and more people are hurt by unchecked corporations and a government that loves them and does their bidding. That corporatism and or ""crony capitalism"" and it isn't the same thing at all."
,Barkingspyder,2011-11-29T20:37Z,"I think Anthem is the best place to star with Rand's fiction.  It can be read in a few hours, and the main speech given by the main character made me weep.  I think her other novels were too long but still count as works of true genius.  Nobody had ever put forth an entire philosophical system in a novel before Atlas Shrugged.  The non-fiction books, such as ""The Virtue of Selfishness"" are tremendous intellectual ammunition and are highly recomended."
