Compatible With DivX DVD Players (720x400 Resolution).

Method used:
VirtualDub MKV Plugin:
Lanczos3 Resize Filter and Saved uncompressed @ 47.4GB
Compressed With DivX 2-Pass @ "Insane Quality" Setting
Resolution: 720x400
Bitrate: 2125
Audio: AC3 ACM 5.1 Channel @ 256kbps @ 48,000hz

Note: I switched resizing from the encoding step to the uncompression step, which made it possible to use the better Lanczos3 resize filter. I wasn't resizing first since it cuts the uncompressed data by just over 100GB. Which to me, didn't sound good, but I think it actually does look better.

So feel free to let me know how you think it compares to my previous rips.
