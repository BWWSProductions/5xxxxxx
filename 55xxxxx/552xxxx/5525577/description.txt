"The Wreck" can equally well describe the car crash that is the plot of this movie or the movie itself. If you read the plot it might sound interesting at first: man and pregnant woman are stuck in a car after a crash. You might think to yourself that sounds like a good start, and the plot should take off from there. It doesn't. That one line plot is the whole movie. It starts with The Wreck and ends with The Wreck. The rest of the time they are waiting to get rescued, with vague hints that something sinister might happened in between. Admittedly, the beginning is more like a preview of what is to come, rather then the start of the movie, so you could equally well call the story of what happens before The Wreck either the beginning of the movie or a flashback. In any case, this part is pretty thin. The main objective is to introduce the disgruntled bother whom the woman left for the man.
