,7itanium,2010-05-01T09:26Z,"Thanks for letting me know, the offending files will be removed next time I release this torrent (if ever).

And yeah, I know.  But I figured someone smarter than me could use this material, so why not?"
,guerrebear,2010-05-01T16:33Z,"What a great collection, many thanks to you Mr. 7."
,qhugh62,2010-06-03T08:05Z,Interesting collection! thanks for sharing
,7itanium,2010-06-10T20:23Z,"Spammers basically took over the entire board.  Phrixus is changing its format for the most part in the coming months, and we finally have a new board that will allow e&w discussion, and will hopefully be our new home.  I should talk more about it in the next few days.  I also have designed a new system with other members submitting files, which I will add to this account.  So that is why I am not uploading a whole lot for the time being, I am just waiting for this new website to be fully functional.  And for future reference, I don't check my older torrent's comments too often, so from now on, post in the newest torrents I have if you ever have questions.  It will greatly increase the probability of me reading and replying to them much sooner."
,7itanium,2010-06-14T10:23Z,"Eventually yes.  But for the time being, I will probably be uploading nothing but individual files, to increase the memberbase of our forum (by referring people to the website in a text file included in the torrent).  I have a lot of new content, and that is literally dozens of hours of sorting it, and then verifying the material is indeed accurate to the folder it is in.

We have a lot of plans for this site, but are only a few man team as staff, so stay tuned..."
