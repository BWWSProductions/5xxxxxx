Lovers of jazz fusion and devotees of the possibilities of the electric bass have reason to thank the heavens for the arrival of THUNDER. A collaboration between three of the genre's reigning heavyweights-Stanley Clarke, Marcus Miller, and Victor Wooten-THUNDER offers up a cornucopia of low-end sonic playfulness and mastery. With tracks that range from orchestral (opener "Maestros de Las Frencuencias Bajas) to moody, spaghetti-western film music ("Los Tres Hermanos"), the album mixes jazz, funk, ambient, light jazz, and classical elements. Clarke, Miller, and Wooten weave their instruments around each other, creating plenty of varied interplay, and making this enjoyable set a bass-lover's dream.
