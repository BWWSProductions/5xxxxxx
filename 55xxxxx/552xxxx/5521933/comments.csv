,Girmi007,2011-03-03T22:37Z,"Do not download.
High pitched sound and popping in the audio."
,Girmi007,2011-03-05T13:59Z,"^
Never mind, it was just a faulty codec"
,FRivera,2011-04-27T00:53Z,I'm having the same as Gitmi and Codec Tweak doesn't help. WTF is up with the sound? Crackles on both MPC and WMP.
,FRivera,2011-04-28T13:52Z,"VLC plays the sound fine however, and picture quality is superb (9). 10x PetaFOX!"
,frogmelodies,2011-05-22T23:27Z,"@master2pc
that's the best spoiler ever :D

great upload though,sound works just fine [K-lite mega pack codec is what i have] :)"
,downaccs,2011-07-26T13:48Z,Girmi007 is right DO NOT DOWNLOAD! the sound has problem!!
,Vicar in a Tutu,2011-09-04T14:30Z,"The sound doesn't have a PROBLEM, it works fine and the film is watchable because of that. However, it is extremely LOW QUALITY.

The bit rate info says 'AAC 196kbps 48KHz 6channel', which works out to be 32kbps per channel (and sounds that way or worse). This is unacceptable for a Blu-Ray rip. It should at least be in 2ch stereo at around 196kbps.

Fortunately the video quality is good, but the audio should be stereo at that size or matched with one of those awful 350mb film rips for people who don't care and put up with piss poor AV."

,vsjane,2011-09-14T17:21Z,Thanks for the problem-free download!
,sun2244,2011-09-21T20:02Z,this is not problem free. the audio is messed up.
,sun2244,2011-09-22T02:53Z," Dont tell me I have codec problem, i have hundreds of movies working fine except this one. Video is good tho the audio is bad.

I extracted the video file from this download and  the audio from another download.  Then I remuxed the two files, turned out great.
