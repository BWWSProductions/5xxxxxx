i'm asking because 99% of your torrents are on that site.  the torrent names, tags & file names are identical to the torrents on RockBox.

just wondering."

[T],zombifuzz,2010-05-02T23:59Z,"i figured it was you grabbing their stuff or someone stealing yours.  either way it's ok man.  you are providing people with stuff on TPB that might not necessarily get posted here, but only on RockBox.

uploading on RockBox is very hard.  i was originally on there and switched to TPB because TPB makes it easier to share your stuff with people.

please don't think i was being rude by asking, that was not my intention.

have a great day man."
