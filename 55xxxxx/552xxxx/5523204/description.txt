Bone Thugs-N-Harmonyâ€™s blockbuster album, â€˜Uni5: The Worldâ€™s Enemy,â€™ is its first release in more than 15 years with all five members in tow. Though â€˜Uni5: The Worldâ€™s Enemyâ€™ updates Boneâ€™s signature sound and style into a less abrasive, more reflective incarnation, the groupâ€™s potency has only been heightened.

Although Flesh-N-Bone was arrested in the late 1990â€™s and sentenced to more than a decade in prison, having all five group members working in unison on â€˜Uni5: The Worldâ€™s Enemyâ€™ gave the collection more significance in a robust effort. The unity of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony shines throughout â€˜Uni5: The Worldâ€™s Enemy.â€™

The piano-accented â€˜Facts Donâ€™t Lieâ€™ features the group coming together to document its history and cement its status as the rap gameâ€™s original thugs, while the melodic â€˜Pay What They Oweâ€™ details how Bone changed the music world.
