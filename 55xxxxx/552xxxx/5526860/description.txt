Australian Crawl (often called Aussie Crawl or The Crawl by fans) was an Australian rock band founded by James Reyne (lead vocals/piano), Brad Robinson (rhythm guitar), Paul Williams (bass guitar), Simon Binks (lead guitar) and David Reyne (drums) in 1978.[1] David Reyne soon left and was replaced by Bill McDonough (drums, percussion).[2] They were later joined by his brother Guy McDonough (vocals, rhythm guitar).[2] The band was named after the front crawl swimming style also known as the Australian crawl.[1]

Australian Crawl were associated with surf music [3][4] and sponsored a surfing competition in 1984.[5] However, they also handled broader social issues such as shallow materialism, car accidents, and cautionary tales of romance.[3]

After their 1980 debut album, The Boys Light Up reached #4, Australian Crawl had two #1 albums; 1981's Sirocco and 1982's Sons of Beaches.[1] Their early singles reached the top 25 but none broke into the Top Ten;[1] their best performing single was #1 hit "Reckless" which showed a more mature approach than earlier hits, and came from their 1983 Semantics EP.[1]

Upheaval within the band occurred from 1983 onwards. First Bill McDonough left, then his brother Guy McDonough died in 1984, then various other members left.[1] Their 1985 release Between a Rock and a Hard Place was expensive but sales were disappointing;[1] and they disbanded early in 1986.[6] The band's status as an icon on the Australian music scene was acknowledged by induction into the 1996 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame.[7] Founding guitarist Brad Robinson was unable to attend the Hall of Fame induction in person, as he was hospitalised with lymphoma and died two weeks later.
