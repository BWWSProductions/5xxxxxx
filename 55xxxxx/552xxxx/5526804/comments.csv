,Thinyman,2010-05-14T21:59Z,"to the uploader, GREAT WORK man.

i want to ask you, its called .... Structure, But i guess Architecture version is inside ,right ?"
,mayfire,2010-09-15T10:15Z,"Thanks for the upload, but during the install, I got this error ""the file'/download/2011RST/Content/.cab' could not be downloaded. The server replied with error code 0""
How do I go ahead with the install?"
,wiedeler,2010-09-22T23:23Z,guys wenn u whrite a comment say if its good or if it shit how hard can it be ? is this revit structure or revit architecture?
,XSR,2010-10-03T09:13Z,"For anyone wondering, it's the real deal. Although the picture says Revit Architecture, it's in fact Revit Structure Suite and everything works like a charm. Thanks Stun for a great upload!"
,Death-Dude-72,2010-10-15T00:27Z,"So if I have windows 7 64Bit, I need only download DVD1 and DVD3 right?"
,murelit0,2010-11-07T03:29Z,"Thanks for uploading.
I can't install :-(
I'm supposed to ""insert disk 11""
I tried everything, any suggestions?
Thanks in advance"
,elcapizzo,2010-11-09T03:24Z,"@Thinyman  I am wondering the same thing, seems misleading?

@Death-Dude-72 also thinking the same thing, it seems that y0u would only need disk 1 and 3 if you are using x64 OS and 1 and 2 if you are using x86 OS."
,spacerox,2011-01-15T00:45Z,"x86 version worked great.  It had a cabinet error on the initial install, but on startup it installed properly.  Top notch work, uploader!"
,jpineda23,2011-02-13T20:44Z,Has anyone found a keygen to work with revit 2011? any help would be appreciated
,noivan,2011-04-01T16:00Z,"Trying to use the Keygen: After the installation process, A-Revit does not generate a request. Click on the link for licensing info, and there is a key there, but it's too short: if you use it in the Keygen, 2 blocks (2 x 4 characters=8 characters) are missing, and it won't activate. What am I missing? Thanks."
,HookWeel,2011-04-02T18:32Z,"I have exakly the same problem like ""noivan"" 8 characters are missing. what to do?!?"
,noivan,2011-04-02T21:21Z,"Looks like the one Stun'd here is...me. Sorry. I had to follow the instructions EXACTLY, and activation worked. If you get an ""activation failed"" error, you have to close the program, AND the keygen, the start again. In the words of Elmer Fudd, ""Be vewy vewy cawful"" when putting in the response code. It's a pain, but worth the effort since I have 1 stinkin' job to do in RevIt and will never use it again.  Thanks Stun. "
,noivan,2011-04-02T21:22Z,"I should also say that there WILL be two vacant boxes in the response code area. In fact, if you enter spaces, it'll go on for a looooong time. Just ignore the other two boxes despite what 1 respondent said and put spaces in there...that's a recipe for...starting over!"
,ramonyemaya,2011-06-15T14:05Z,"Excellent, Good Job!

Install and works like a charm

Thanks"
,elcapizzo,2012-02-06T12:50Z,"ok a little confusing but I got it working. just follow the instructions properly. you have to load up the program and go to manually activate, then open the keygen as admin and click on patch memory, then paste in the activation code into the keygen and then paste the response code into the program. will not work otherwise."
