Check Crack/install.txt on DVD1

No Lame Patching, no problems with updates, no problems exporting
to a "legal" version, no trial patched, no files modified etc
The one and only way to do it - KEYGEN - fully activated

Enjoy!

NB: We DO NOT ALLOW anyone to use our files or cracks for any purpose
Just for the record, our files and cracks got hidden tags
So to all those punk heads packing our keygen with leaked uncompleted trials
spend your time on learning how to crack and how to earn some respect.!

And what's that group nanozipping Deployment pre-configured images
as 0day releases. Dont you have skills do do a real rip, rebuilding the cabs
and fixing the ishield insaller ? Maybe we should do it
We miss the good old days, when it was quality over quantity.
