LOOK AT UR---------------FRAME RATE----------- !!! its at 10 frames per sec !! what were u thinnking encoding this movie at such slow frame rate..... 
i appreciate ur efforts....          
but u simply cannot encode a movie into 300 mb AVI !!!! !! do it in MKV or MP4 format !!! "
,anaoluser,2010-12-11T22:30Z,"same with shutter island, i watchd it coz did it, n the movies frame plays like jelly fish, less the smoothness. mp4 is good option ask pluto999 about it. lol"
