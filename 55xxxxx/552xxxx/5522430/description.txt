Re : It├óΓé¼Γäós time to leave the old internet behind. The new internet is here, its name is ├óΓé¼┼ôFacebook├óΓé¼┬¥, and it├óΓé¼Γäós carrying a great big bag of cash on its shoulder!

Fellow Warriors, 

I├óΓé¼Γäóm back again and this time I├óΓé¼Γäóm here to tell you something straight: 

The OLD DAYS of internet marketing are over, done, KAPUT! 

Now, there├óΓé¼Γäós going to be some IM dinosaurs, ahem, I mean ├óΓé¼┼ôgurus├óΓé¼┬¥ who├óΓé¼Γäóll get their panties all up in a bunch over what I├óΓé¼Γäóm about to tell you. 

But you know what? They can whine and complain as much as they want and it won├óΓé¼Γäót change the fact that the methods they are preaching are antiquated, slow, and ineffective. And, it won├óΓé¼Γäót change the fact that they are all overlooking the most simple and powerful way to make money online.

Let me ask you a question├óΓé¼┬ª 

Say you wanted to catch 100 fish. How would you do it? Would you: 

A. Drive all over the countryside and find 100 rapid rivers that each had a few fish swimming down them. Take the time to set up a fishing line at each one. Then, run back and forth from river to river, checking your rods, re-baiting hooks and hoping that every line would catch one fish each.

OR 

B. Find ONE still, calm lake with 100,000 fish crammed into it, take one great big net along and scoop up your entire 100 fish in a single swipe.

If you answered with option ├óΓé¼┼ôA├óΓé¼┬¥, then you are probably an old school internet marketer, slaving away over the hundreds of websites it takes to pull in a decent haul, trying to find the time to tend to all of them and catching a few sales or commissions here and there from each. 

If you answered with option ├óΓé¼┼ôB├óΓé¼┬¥, then unlike some, you are not stuck in the past. You are ready to drop your net into the waters of real opportunity and scoop up major rewards, instead of stubbornly fishing where the good catches used to be ├óΓé¼┼ôback in the day├óΓé¼┬¥. 

You see, most of the online money strategies the ├óΓé¼┼ôgurus├óΓé¼┬¥ bang on about are actually straight out of the 90├óΓé¼Γäós. Now, there are better and smarter ways to make $$.


Sure, maybe the same old techniques that you hear about over and over again used to be the best way to make money online, ten or fifteen years ago. 

But hey, saddling up and riding horseback used to be the best way to mosey into town to trade corn for chewin├óΓé¼Γäó terbacky. 

Just because something used to work , even if it still kind of works today, doesn├óΓé¼Γäót mean it is the BEST way to get the results you├óΓé¼Γäóre looking for now.

It├óΓé¼Γäós Time To Change Things Up A Bit├óΓé¼┬ª


In the beginning, search engines were so easy to fool that you could pretty much throw up a website spammed full of keywords and expect to pull in a stack of traffic and cash. 

Then, Google came along and decided to throw some fancy algorithms into the mix that would make it harder for sites to get rankings. Suddenly everybody became consumed with trying to figure out the latest and greatest Google tricks and how they could be beaten. 

All these years later that fixation with ├óΓé¼┼ôbeating├óΓé¼┬¥ Google hasn├óΓé¼Γäót eased up one bit. 

Here├óΓé¼Γäós the bad news for those going with the ├óΓé¼┼ô100 lines in 100 rivers├óΓé¼┬¥ approach to internet marketing:

You can├óΓé¼Γäót ├óΓé¼┼ôbeat├óΓé¼┬¥ Google, ever. They will always be one step ahead and it├óΓé¼Γäós only going to get harder.


But, here├óΓé¼Γäós the good news for those who are ready to get ahead of the game and start enjoying more rewards using simple, up to date strategies:

You don├óΓé¼Γäót need Google anymore. They used to be the King of the Internet, but now their throne is crumbling ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£ and they know it!


Have you wondered why Google├óΓé¼Γäós been making such massive changes lately? We all know about the recent events with their unfurling of Buzz and their use of profiles, friends, groups and every other thing they can tack onto their service. 

I├óΓé¼Γäóll tell you what I see when I look at all of these additions. I see a company that used to be the biggest shark in the water getting nervous, because it knows there├óΓé¼Γäós a younger, stronger shark that has just outgrown it and is looming over its shoulder.
