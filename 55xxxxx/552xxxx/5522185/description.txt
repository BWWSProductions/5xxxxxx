Being thin, pretty and sexy brings happiness. Young girls receive these messages daily hundreds of times. But who sets these impossible beauty standardsâ€”and how can they be changed? In this eye-opening documentary, filmmaker and former Elite International fashion model Nicole Clark, now a champion for young girls and their self-esteem, calls for a necessary change: integrity and responsible media for our youth. 

COVER GIRL CULTURE pairs images of girls and women in television and print ads with footage from the catwalks and celebrity media. Clark is given rare access to women editors from major magazines like â€Teen Vogueâ€ and â€ELLEâ€, who provide a shocking defense of the fashion and advertising worlds. The film juxtaposes these interviews with revealing insights from models, parents, teachers, psychologists, body image experts and most importantly, the heartfelt expressions of girls themselves on how they feel about the media that surrounds them. 

With an insiderâ€™s view, the film addresses issues like todayâ€™s increasingly invasive media, heightened advertising to tweens, the sexualization of girls, and consumer cultureâ€™s disempowerment of young women. An up-to-date inquiry into advertising and the cult of celebrityâ€™s deep and negative impact on teens and young women, COVER GIRL CULTURE also suggests how to educate young women to think critically about the media.
