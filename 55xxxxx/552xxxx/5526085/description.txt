ASAP Utilities is a powerful Excel add-in that fills the gaps in Excel and automates frequently used tasks. Since 1999 it has grown to become probably one of the world's most popular add-ins for MS Excel.
 
In my humble opinion I believe this excel software utility is a must in every office. I use it myself on a daily basis and it saves me (and many others) an incredible amount of time.


A few of ASAP Utilities' popular macro tools that will speed up your work in Excel: 

- Deselect cells in your selection | video 
- Apply formula to selected cells | video 
- Conditional select cells: for example select cells greater than 12 or all red cells 
- Advanced sorting: for example sort by color | video 
- Copy a worksheet's page and print settings 
- Vision control: view workbooks, sheets and easily change their settings 
- Print multiple sheets 
- Color each n'th row or column in selection (color banding) 
- File import and export tools (txt, csv, dbf, xls, gif, jpg, html, etc.) 
- Export selection as HTML table (including formats, colors etc.) 
- Assign your own shortcuts to the utilities you use the most
