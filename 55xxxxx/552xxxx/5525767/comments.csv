[V],poppedtart,2010-05-02T07:13Z,"I don't follow bollywood releases so I cant say that will happen.  It was hard to not notice this one though.  Normally only release from DVD, so it was hard to figure out all the strange pre dvd releases of this film.  I found a retail dvd disc though and made it."
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-02T07:18Z,"This film is strange at times.  You can see at times when they are obviously dubbing hindi over english.  Why are they doing that?  Times also when they used hindi when it made zero sense to do so.  Like when khan was speaking of sam in the church to all the parishioners.  No one at that church would of known what he was saying even.  The constant switching of english and hindi midway in speaking was all strange.  I think the director didn't know when he should use hindi and when he shouldn't and then changed his mind sometimes.

When khan and mandriva's friend spoke to her class, the obviously dubbed over he english with hindi here, what was the point?  There is also a whole scene in the kitchen that I am sure was dubbed over later."

,Critic_101,2010-05-02T12:02Z,"Hey PT just discovered that I'm getting both audio tracks 1 and 2 on my ps3 that is the ac3 2.0 and dolby digital 5.1 all the way back to pandorum. first they it was only one track now both so I guess you need to update your technical specifications and include ps3 also in the 2nd audio track listing, Now ps3 can also play both tracks not just apple. There were some updates recently for ps3 that must have enabled the option for both tracks. Just so you know. ;)"
,trax100,2010-05-02T13:04Z,Ya  got to agree with you on the language problem.The director never anticipated the humongous international business the movie got and thus had made it keeping the mainstream Indian audience in mind.A full english version of the movie is expected to hit theatres in USA this May. Lets hope you upload that version too. Anyways great job!
,Mac Genius,2010-05-20T00:42Z,"Karan Johar (Ze Director of ze movie) was NOT confused, it was made for the Indian audience in ze mind & he had to ensure that Non English speakin Indians are able to get ze msg, even without reading ze subtitles.

talking about ze church scene, I think whn someone is emotional, would he be in enough senses to remebr wht language he is speaking in?
or shall I put it this way... one'd blurt out things in ze most spokn language whn undr SUCH stress."
