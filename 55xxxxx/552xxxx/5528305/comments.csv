,life256,2010-10-24T15:09Z,"If that inf file is missing it's because your anti virus thought it was a powerreg scheduler malware. nothing dangerous in this particular one though.
clean download.
I just can't get it to run because of securom is blocking me... ugh. any ideas? i've already run the removal tool"

,solutioN-Ghost,2012-04-10T16:39Z,"No, this is not the classic version. The classic version which runs in Windows 98 is below 2D but more funny sounds and actions by the tokens.

This version is a newer version which is in 3D graphics and a lot more fun ! works perfectly, just a false positive ! Thanks.."
