,zen29,2010-06-04T17:25Z,"NO This is a great film!
The Director even came to my film school, screened and talked about it. A wonderful film that took years in the making.
PLS SEED!!"
,bomath,2011-01-21T07:48Z,"Smart, very smart: create a movie torrent split in archives, for „scene” stupidity and for the ones that cling to obsolete file systems that don't accept files larger than 4GB. Newsflash: those ones will still need to unarchive that, on compatible drives.
Now try to guess: if people wouldn't need to unrar it, would they seed it longer?"
,chiletpb,2012-04-16T17:24Z,"PLEASE PEOPLE, SEED!!!!!
I PROMISE TO KEEP SEEDING UNTIL THE END OF DAYS IF I CAN FINISH IT"
