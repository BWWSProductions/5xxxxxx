,Xinriu,2010-05-01T01:27Z,"FIRST OF ALL! THANK YOU SKIDROW!! 

some people claim that you guys stole the assassins creed 2 crack, others even tell that the dll that you guys made is a server emulator masked...

BUT what I know is that thanks to you guys i could play the game, without a server emulator or even have to register in ubisoft! ( and i don´t want to register !! ) 

i understand that reloaded and other groups are pissed about skidrow, this was a mega challenge and one of the most difficult drm´s to crack, but far as i know you guys were the first to release the dll, yes the simple drag and drop dll instead of server emulators and that other stuff.

i believe houver that skidrow may have learned something over the server emulator or the other cracks and i think that instead of the cracker groups argue they just can chill out and play the games!

thanks SKIDROW, RAZOR, RELOADED ETC..

you make possible for all of us play our favorite games, for free, and many of us, if you guys didin´t exist,  would just to spend like 60 ? ( or dollars ) to play a game that is only possible to play wen connected to internet, and thats just wrong! 

and here in PORTUGAL the minimum SALARY IS 475? AND ASSASSINS CREED 2 COSTS  59? ON THE PC AND 69? ON THE PS3,XBOX 360 ;) 

SO, MANY PEOPLE CAN´T AFFORD ASSASSINS CREED 2 OTHERS MAKE THE ""SACRIFICE"" AND BUY IT JUST TO DISCOVER THAT THEY JUST SPENT 60? ON A GAME THAT DOESN´T LET THEM PLAY ANYWERE ( LAPTOP ) AND IT MAY FALE DUE TO SERVERS ERRORS!!

So when you copy only the gu.exe and conviction_game.exe it will give you the error from above.So in conclusion when you unpack the Rar. you have to DISABLE YOUR AV...That's what happened to me and im sure that's what happened to all the other who had this error."

I've followed the directions, added the cracks to the appropriate folders (GU and .exe into system folder and ubiorbitapi_r2 into Ubisoft Game Launcher folder). I've also read that it sometimes only works with the original .exe, I've tried that and still no luck. I've also tried putting the ""ubiorbitapi_r2"" file into the system folder, still no luck. I've tried putting it in both folder, and STILL no luck. I'm raging really hard.

My problems alter. One time it'll go black and look like it's about to start up and then it'll just close (this is when I run the ""conviction_game.exe file). When I try and run ""GU.exe"" it says I need an internet connection, when I'm clearly connected to the internet. Also, sometimes I'll get that annoying ""Error Code 2"" message. People say that ""ubiorbitapi_r2"" gets caught by antiviruses, but I have BitDefender 2010 and it doesn't show up as a virus. As a precaution I've even added an exclusion to the whole Ubisoft folder, yet it still won't work.

This is the only crack I've ever had a problem with, and it's driving me absolutely insane. Could someone PLEASE help me?"

,jalatif,2010-05-02T22:48Z,"works 100% thanx skidrow u r a life savor
this is how it works 4 me firstly i downloaded clone dvd and then this skidrow crack then do this
1.u need only to copy dll files to ubisoft launcher and gu file to system don't copy other conviction game.exe if u get 
error code 2 and if u have avg disable resistance shield befor using dll files
2. no need to be online anywhere
_______------------------___________
for those playing ac2 and scc both
here is how i got mine assassins creed 2 and splinter cell conviction to work simultaneously on skidrow crack
before installing scc ,copy crack's dll files
or have a copy of ur previous skidrow ac2 crack dll files then switch ur dll files for playing respective game 
i.e. if u wanna play scc copy its dll files to ubisoft launcher and when over copy it to another location to save it and after that if u want to play ac2 copy its dll files to ubisoft launcher and replace scc's one and play it and after over save it dll files and keep on switching dll files for playing both games simultaneously.  
if u r using avg switch ur resistance shield disable 
or 
go to tools>advance settings>resistance shield>excluded files>add path of dll directories
and if u have ati cards upgrade catalyst to 10.4a for graphics issues
hope all this information works 4 u as it did 4 me"
,r2007uk,2010-05-03T00:07Z,"I would like to futher add comment to those that had the same talking/sound issue I had (with realtek hd audio).

I fixed this earlier today it took me quite some time but what i basically did was disconnect all the speakers and cables and cleaaned the jacks (don't overlook simple things like this!)

I then uninstalled all audio/realtek associated program % drivers then downloaded the latest ones which can be found easily on google (mine was actually from gigabyte)

having installed the latest drivers/reboot i then  proceeded to launch the realtak audio manager and THEN connect all my speakers etc back to the pc associating the speakers witht he correct jack i.e centre/front/rear.

made sure that I set my option to 5.1 and THEN enabled 'speaker fill' and 'bass  management'. then i went to the sound effects tab and picked one which sounded ok (for me generic).

the next step was to go to the room correction tab where you can increase the individual volume levels for each speakers, in this circumstance i only increases the 'rear' speakers volume.

Now once all that is set when i tested my sound I WAS getting sound from all speakers, therefore i loaded the game and then went into audio settings, changing it to 5.1 from 2.1 (default) and again tested it.. and this time I WAS able to hear sound in each speaker.. 

Now the last thing was I lowered the ingame 'background/music/etc' so that the speaking would not be 'overpowered' by the rest of the game noise..

Hey presto!! I got sound and am fucking loving this game thus far!!
