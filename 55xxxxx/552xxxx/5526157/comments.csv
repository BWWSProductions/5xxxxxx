,shaban96,2010-05-02T09:41Z,"thnx alot dude.
it would be even awesome if we could have a 720p upload.
anyways thanks again for ur awesome effort"
,8o8cr4ne,2010-10-13T17:45Z,"Yes, I'm surprised that there isn't a single 720p episode to be found anywhere."
,darkscale,2010-11-08T04:23Z,"Ultimate only started in April as a new series, thus no 720p version yet. You need to wait for a BR release which won't happen until at least the first season is over. Until then, its only going to be whatever gets broadcast on cable/dish/internet quality."
