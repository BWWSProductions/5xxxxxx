Plot: The graduating class at Miss Aversham and Miss Cronstall's School for Girls find that they have - in defiance of the natural laws of probability - all blossomed simultaneously. Capitalizing on their unique status, and intent on teaching high school boys to NEVER take girls for granted, they issue a challenge to the boys of Easthill's rival private schools, Selby and Lancaster. The winner in a series of designated competitions will be awarded exclusive rights to the girls as prom dates. Like the capricious and meddlesome gods of Greek mythology, the ACS girls pit the boys' schools against each other in a (secret) Prom War.
