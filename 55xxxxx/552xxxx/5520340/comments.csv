,demo69ca,2010-04-30T04:54Z,why do people keep sharing the same movie file. this is the 4th one with the awful audio.
,edorfx,2010-04-30T22:50Z,"The Video is good. About the sound: if you are very eager to see the movie NOW, it helps to use a good headset with the volume High.

Or worst case scenario, PAY to see it in the cinema!"
,allrockedout,2010-04-30T23:45Z,i just watched it and listened to Dark Side Of The Moon
,edorfx,2010-05-01T00:21Z,"I guess ""Money"" would be a ok soundtrack to most parts of the movie...The parts where Ewan and Jim is fucking does not really need any sound..."
,Fingers123,2010-05-01T19:34Z,"its still watchable with the bad sound, people are over exaggerating. i watched it and i could hear everything, maybe some of u need 2 book a hearing test "
