,ChAlain73,2010-05-06T07:19Z,"Vamos hermanos Latinos, asi nunca prosperaran uploads como este Region 4!!! DVD Clone completo, no se encuentran muchos de estos en la red, compartanlo lo mas que puedan!! Si se puede!! apoyen!! 

Muchas gracias al uploader de este torrent, ojala hubiera mas de estos, los que se encuentran en ""espaÂçòol"" casi siempre resultan ser ""castellano"" y algunos ""audio latino"" estan para llorar!!"
,ChAlain73,2010-05-06T07:36Z,"Here my comment in english 4 the rest of the world...

Come on my Latin brothers, uploads like these R4 DVDR Clone will never get bigger and prosper, they are just a few outhere in the net, share it all u can and more, you can do it, support the cause

Thank you so much to the uploader, I wich that could be more like this, the only one's you find in ""spanish"" almost every time they result to be in ""Spain Spanish"" not Latino or Neutral, and some ""audio latino"" torrents are really lame.

I think the real problem is that we don't have the culture to get our computers running all day and night long

And some others finish download, burn to DVD and then delete the torrent, also the most of them have the lame Telmex DSL @ 1 Mbps (128 KB/s) internet speed but that's 256 kbps (32 KB/s) upload speed that doesn't exist... this have to change!!"
,ChAlain73,2010-05-06T09:54Z,"By the way, greetings to another great DVDR uploader [djfred], because the DVD was ment to have at least audio & subtitles options, everything else take us back to the limitations of a VHS (DVDRips, DVDScr's, CAMs, TSs, even some BDRips) but not the SecretMyth or Lifechanger 720p BDRips they are awesome cristal clear image and audio

lol, some readers will not have an idea of what a VHS is, lol. Nor even a Betamax, They born in the DVD era..."
