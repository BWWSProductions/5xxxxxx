[V],twentyforty,2010-04-30T08:57Z,"@fame0203: Shows that I usually do and went missing during the latest ""Black-out"" would be available only as direct download. Procedure how to get my e-mail have been explained in last Gossip G. comments.
Learning from past similar occasions, tries to bring up the missing torrents ended as real nightmare. So, this time - I wont repeat such mistake.
Send me an e-mail and I will respond."
