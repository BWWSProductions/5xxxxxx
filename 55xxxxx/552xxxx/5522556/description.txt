For five years, 18 year old Takumi has been delivering tofu in his fathers obsolescent Toyota AE86 every morning. Not only has he become a good racer, but he has also unwillingly perfected the art of drift. he was never an aficionado of hill racing until he is asked to drive this AE86 in a David and Goliath race against Night Kid's GTR. A glorious but unexpected victory awakens the competitive genes in his blood, while his overnight fame inevitably leads to hell raising races one after another, each one more perilous and exciting than the previous.
