[V],raymondhome,2010-05-02T16:04Z,"THE ONLY REASON I AM UPLOADING THIS RELEASE IS BECAUSE OF THE HARDCODE ENGLISH SUBS FOR THE NAVI PARTS...IMHO I THINK THE FLAWL3SS RELEASE IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER QUALITY :)

FLAWL3SS RELEASE

[T],kn5150,2010-05-02T17:53Z,how do you make a blu ray rip to divx?
,Questionmarq34,2010-05-04T20:34Z,"I think your screens are amazing. I've been looking all over for the best quality with reasonable size, and I think I've found it. I think this will be the best Avatar upload on TPB. Thank you very much."
,arian25,2010-05-19T14:33Z,"Thanx. I D/Led this & the one Life_Changer uploaded. IMO this is the 2nd best Rip of AVATAR(LC's one being the best). Though there were some nut-job whining about the brightness(obviously i had no such complaints). That one had hard Na'vi subs too. Lucky for me, i grabbed it in time(before it was deleted).

@raymond- Thanx for the U/L. BTW i found this one better than FLAWL3SS's copy of AVATAR. And one more thing, would you be kind enough to Rip ""The Dreamer"" for us in 720p?. Thanks again."
,shockleader,2010-09-05T19:34Z,I was waiting for someone to upload a copy that is a great compromise between file size and quality. This is it. The hardcoded subs are also spot on. Thanks uploader. How anyone could have sat through a TS all those months ago is beyond me.   
,tushar,2010-09-15T08:39Z,please seed........ guys
,PCVIRGINCRACKED,2011-03-13T13:43Z,Thanks for this upload Raymond. I've just started downloading today as i've been looking for a copy with hardcoded subs and only just found it. Please keep this seeding for a few more days guy's and then i'll continue to seed to a 1 to 3 ratio. Thanks again
