Alex welcomes back to the show [hour 3, into early hour 4] James Traficant, a former Democrat Representative from Ohio. Traficant was railroaded and imprisoned for seven years after a tax battle with the IRS. He was featured as a guest speaker at a Tea Party Protest in Ohio and is currently planning to run for Congress as an independent in either the 6th or 17th districts of Ohio.

Alex also talks [2nd half of hour 4] with Wayne Madsen, a Washington, D.C.-based investigative journalist, author and columnist. A former commissioned Navy ensign, Madsen worked as a government consultant on contracts for the National Security Agency and later joined the Electronic Privacy Information Center as a senior fellow. In late January 2005 Madsen left EPIC and began his career as an investigative journalist.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. NOTE: The material here is made available
 strictly as information. Do not assume support or endorsement
 on my part for all of the contents. 

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
