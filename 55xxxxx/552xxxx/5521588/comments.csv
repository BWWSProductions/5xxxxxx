,Pilot7777,2010-05-02T15:42Z,"@ habeijer You have to delete the version you've installed, then install the old Jeppview and Flitedeck again and set the clock for the proper data cycle, type in the code and start the programms to verify that they are registered on your omputer, after that set your bios clock to 31.12.2008 and install the first datacycle of 2009 which you can find here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5158807/Jeppview_3_Airac_0901_complete
(you have to rename the Label of the cd or the file if a error message pops out and says: unrecognized disk)
After you installed them run and activate the programms again on your computer.
Now you should be able install the new datacycles without any code and don't  forget to change the time settings."
