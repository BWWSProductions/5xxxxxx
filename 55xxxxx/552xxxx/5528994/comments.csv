,wonder_a7,2010-05-07T15:15Z,"This game is for Play Station.

To run this into PC this was a Challenge to me but i've done it with my some another emulator with some settings.

That's why it is running some fast because of some miner settings to the emulator.

But it is fast in XP only in Window 7 it is running perfect.

enjoy"

Finally I got the way how to run this at normal speed as some people say that this game runs very fast.

So you just have to download a video plugins name ""P.E.Op.S. Soft Driver 1.17"" or newer.

Basically it is a .dll file so copy this file to ""plugins"" folder of the emulator and then goto ""Config >> Video"" menu option and select the video plugins dropdown as ""P.E.Op.S. Soft Driver 1.17"" and then click ok and run your game. Now it is in normal speed.

Have fun!
The world of wonders!"
