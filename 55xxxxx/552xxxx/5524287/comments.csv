[T],headdock,2010-05-01T21:40Z,"Hi there Nomerecy and Tifon,

Thanks for your comments.

I think it`s a good idea to include all the original tracks unmixed within the torrent. The size will be bigger, but I will seperate the tracks and the mix into different folders, so you can choose the way you would like to download.

My next releases will be in that way.

Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts with me!

Cheers."
