Link for the codec and player : http://www.free-codecs.com/download/k_lite_codec_pack.htm

Tell me if it works."
,Deputy276,2010-05-14T15:34Z,I'm not so sure it's synch problems or the actors who play vampires having trouble talkng with the prosthetic teeth in place.

,Vader--,2010-06-04T15:29Z,It's likely the file as FXG's stuff has ran out of sink for some time now....I won't even dl their files because they seem either unaware or do not care.

,hikurashi83,2012-03-20T02:28Z,"@avatarjokumo lol, you do know it also depends on your internet speed and what internet plan you have which determines the max speed you can download from the internet. ""Fast"" torrents mean that you can download at your max speed like the speed you download movies or things from m-e-g-a-u-p-l-o-a-d (sadly they got taken down)"
