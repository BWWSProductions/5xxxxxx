,whitey85,2010-05-01T01:19Z,wassup wi the fake shit? ironman 2 and nightmare on elm street? no wonder your green skull is gone. dumbass
,AddyTzu,2010-05-01T06:03Z,"he still has his green skull and did not kept it for nothing. so i think the best explanation (like was saying dont know who before) is that he got his account hacked or something like that. 
if thats the case, welcome back raymondhome."
,hamlott,2010-05-01T11:27Z,"Thanks Ray you are a legend. 

If the account were hacked it would still be a green skull, but if someone made a account whit a similar name it would not be a green skull. 

DonÂ´t mock Raymond he is one of the top uploaders here and make a good contribution to us all.  "
,rachyb,2010-05-01T11:40Z,"omg someone else has ob uploaded fake stuff,in raymondhome name,thats y it wont have had a skull,raymondhome has never even lost his skull,doh"
,Mainers,2010-05-02T05:23Z,"Cheers again raymondhome, how thick are peeps on here,, get with the programme,, you must be retarded if you downloaded torrents from a raymondhome without a green skull,, the system aint excactly new, and come to think of why the fuck would one of the top uploaders suddenly lose the skull. Beatnik feckers."
