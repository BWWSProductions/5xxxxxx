I hv a doubt ,,,
this 720p comes with 4.42GB and its a dvdrip.
Then what is the original source of dvd size. 
If it is less than 8.5 then y v need a dvdrip of size of 4.7gb.
Dont u think this size z too much, cos u know that lifechanger (SM) release avatar 2.68GB , 2h and 41 min in 720p. But this z 1h and 52 min yaar. I knw this has super quality, but... 
If u can discuss abt this with DDR's.
Thanks."

,pshergill,2010-05-11T00:45Z,"Hey Sam I love all of your rips, but I am suggesting that you keep these 720p files right at 4gb for 2 reasons:
1) People have FAT32 hard drives that only hold files at a maximum of 4gb and can't go higher, so we can't download these movies(ps3 is also FAT32)
2) To watch this on my blu ray player I have to convert to an AVCHD disc which is a m2ts file that increases the size and it is then not able to fit on a single-layer dvd disc

Just my suggestions!!!"
