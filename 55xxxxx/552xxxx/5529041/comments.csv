I've seen worse quality telesyncs.

I thank raymondhome and all he supports

,d2004,2010-05-04T01:50Z,Dont watch it is realy poor quality  audio and video: (
,AuRteam,2010-05-04T02:24Z,"Not trying to bash raymondhome's torrent but if you are looking for better quality the IMAGiNE release does infact have less of a blurry picture. However, to thank you both for uploading this movie, seeing as both you and TvTeam's releases have hit TPB 4 days before official US theatre release, I am downloading both your release and TvTeam's as well. I will also upload for a long time as come Friday the movie on here will obviously be under huge demand (thats the official release date for USA).

Again, thank you raymondhome for providing us with what looks to be an amazing movie an incredible 4 days before it even hits theatres. Same goes for TvTeam, thank you both.

{AuRoRa Team}"
,michaelrwatson,2010-05-04T02:58Z,"Well.... i gotta say, this is amazing video for the filesize. Just goes to show you that there's no reason whatsoever for all those 1.4 GB files (except perhaps for a movie like Avatar). Unfortunately, the audio here is poor--full of low noise, echo, etc. Running it through a highpass filter (45Hz cutoff) helped, but my God, why didn't the uploader do that instead of making five hundred thousand downloaders do it..?

V 9
A 4 (both on a *cam* scale)"
,michaelrwatson,2010-05-04T03:02Z,"correction:  V7 A 4 (cam scale)

The video has some odd flicker in many places, and doe suffer from over-compression. Still, very watchable. The audio is the problem."

---------------------------------------------------

Nope, no virus here. You must have already had one before you downloaded. Anyways, thanks to the uploader, it is a pretty decent copy of the film. Aside from the slightly muffled audio, the occasional crying baby and squeaking theater seat, it is a good copy.

Telesync IS a cam nobody is lying. Your just mis-informed.

""A telesync (TS) is a bootleg recording of a film recorded in a movie theater, often with a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth (but the video is often just cam video), with a direct connection to the sound source"""

if....

you don't mind an occasional baby screaming,
you don't mind very bad audio,
your to cheap to go to the theatre..."
,skeetskeetmf,2010-05-05T05:52Z,"Being ""too cheap"" to go to the theatre has nothing to do with it.

1. I refuse to spend anymore money on shitty movies. I'll download it, and if I like it, I might go see it.

2. Hell is other people. The theater is always full of candy wrapper crunching loud mouth morons who talk and text through the entire movie. It ruins the entire thing.

3. The only snacks at the concession stand are for lard asses. Popcorn with liquid butter, imitation cheese sauce, icees, and a fucking gallon of soda.

Unrelated to the theater.....

The distribution method is completely fucked. Like I have to buy a magic box, then go to the store to buy plastic disks to put in the magic box when I want to watch a movie. If the magic disk is lost or stolen, Fuck me, I have to buy another one. Then the DRM gets screwed up.....and I can't even watch the stupid disk I bought on the magic box I payed over 100 dollars for.
