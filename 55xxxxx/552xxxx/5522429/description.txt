So, Maximillion @ SHM Forum set me a copy of SHM @ Ultra and Axwell @ Mansion and got them yesterday. 

SHM came in three parts and i used [url=http://handbrake.fr/]Handbrake[/url] on all of the parts and then joined the parts with [url=http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/]MKVMerge[/url] and even separated the audio from the video.

I left the video untouched, just because it got a really good and special feeling to it!
Might be 2 small glitches because of the joining of the files. Tried to noise down the audio a little bit but the quality of the whole show would be terrible, not worth it. So the bass will loud!

Anyways this my friday gift and enjoy! I did atleast! The video takes some sec to load but it works. If there are any errors i can't help you guys tonight. Beertime tonight. The only thing i want from you guys is to PM [b]Maximillion[/b] @ SHM Forum on the forum and say thanks!

Both video and audio!

Axwell @ Mansion will be up in some days too!
